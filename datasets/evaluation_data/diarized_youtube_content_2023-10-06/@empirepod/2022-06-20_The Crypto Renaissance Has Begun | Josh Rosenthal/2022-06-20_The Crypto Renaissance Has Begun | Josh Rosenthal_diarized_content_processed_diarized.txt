00:00:00.200 - 00:00:07.758, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various dexes. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:07.886 - 00:00:37.184, Speaker B: This is the crazy part about it. It wouldn't have occurred to medieval you that you were permissioned. The idea of being permissioned means, you know what being permissionless is like, that, you know what agency or the ability to do other things is like, that was your world. That was the air you breathed. You're like a goldfish in a bowl. It never would have occurred to you that that was wrong or even that that was the case. And so sometimes I make this comparison and say, hey, you know, medieval, you what a chump, right? Like, it didn't even occur to you, but, like, what will future historians say about us?
00:00:40.804 - 00:01:19.564, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we have another special episode. I really feel like I say that for every episode, but this one is actually really, really special. The history nerd in me is the most excited I've probably ever been for a podcast episode in the history of doing these things. A lot of people don't know I was a history major, and my friends know that when I'm not talking about crypto, I am talking about history, which makes me a really, really boring person to hang out with for people who don't like either of those things. But today we have Josh Rosenthal, who is a PhD. He has a PhD in, I think it's medieval and early modern history, if I got that right. He is a historian turned vc.
00:01:19.564 - 00:01:27.400, Speaker A: And I'm just so excited to talk to Josh about both crypto but also the Renaissance. So, Josh, welcome to empire.
00:01:27.592 - 00:01:46.200, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me here. Big fan. Appreciate all you do on number fronts. And I did not know your history mate. It's funny, there's a definite flavor group of people that are into humanities, not just arts, but more kind of storytelling and generally qualitative humanities type things that are into crypto more than you might know. Most of us don't talk about it, though. It's still kind of.
00:01:46.200 - 00:01:48.744, Speaker B: We're in the closet on it, so I'm glad you're one of the members.
00:01:48.904 - 00:02:06.902, Speaker A: Well, I actually think there are a lot of folks in crypto who studied, whether, whatever you want to call it, humanities or liberal arts. Mike and I, we just have to. We're, like, starting at this base level of just knowing. Mike was, I think, psychology and classics. I'm pretty sure it was. That was history. And so we never learned finance, right.
00:02:06.902 - 00:02:12.486, Speaker A: And so we're learning everything from the ground up. And I think it just gives you this more open view of the world.
00:02:12.590 - 00:02:26.208, Speaker B: No, that's crazy. My minor field, my PhD, was actually classic. So that's it teaches you a different way to think about problems. The web, two guys call it kind of first principles, but it's definitely a different way of thinking about what's happening and what might happen, so.
00:02:26.256 - 00:02:26.464, Speaker A: Good.
00:02:26.504 - 00:02:27.360, Speaker B: Wow, that's crazy.
00:02:27.432 - 00:02:28.488, Speaker A: Yeah, super. Exactly.
00:02:28.576 - 00:02:31.272, Speaker B: Now that we've ostracized 98% of the.
00:02:31.288 - 00:02:57.234, Speaker A: Audience, I know a lot of finance majors listening to this being like, damn. Damn. All right, turning off the podcast now, I think a good place to start would just be, can you set the scene? Can you take us back to medieval life? Actually, take us back to medieval life, pre renaissance, during the Renaissance. Take us back to what this, like, permissioned life during that period of time when looked like. And I think we can use that as a kicking off point.
00:02:57.314 - 00:03:15.130, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, sure. Like, I'm not into crypto, just to be totally clear. That's, like, not my thing. I'm more into kind of, like, cultural and societal transformations, and mostly from a historical perspective. So call it renaissance, especially, like, these shifts between the late middle ages and the early reformation. And Renaissance was an epic change. And so I'm into those kind of things.
00:03:15.130 - 00:04:02.278, Speaker B: And. And it just so happens that crypto is an iteration, a recycling, a retelling the next chapter in the story. And so for folks who aren't into spot trading or finance or into kind of weird, pixelated cats, like, if you're into, like, history and particularly, like, what happened in the past and what might happen in the future and, like, how we can mitigate unintended consequences, and, like, at the end of the day, like, I see this as a giant story, one in which we're actually players. So if you're even remotely into. You don't even have to use a c word or call it crypto, if you're remotely into the way the different changes and how people work together, how money might work, how your work might work, how you might do governance, any of these things, like, crypto, is just the natural extension of that, the transformation from the late middle ages to the Renaissance. We call it a renaissance. That basically means it was a rebirth or a recreation.
00:04:02.278 - 00:04:30.624, Speaker B: It was the death of the old world and a recreation of a new world and the old world. Sometimes I trick people and I say, hey, just imagine medieval. You, what would your life have been like? And essentially, the word that comes to mind is permissioned. It was fundamentally hierarchical, but for you, experiencing it, it meant that everything you did or wanted to do was permissioned, you need to ask someone else in authority for permission to do something. So, like, statistically speaking, you're a farmer. You've never been more than 5 miles away from your farm. You can't read, you can't write.
00:04:30.624 - 00:04:44.068, Speaker B: Your life is very difficult. You work from dusk until dawn every single day, and it's back breaking work. You've done that. Your parents did that. Their parents, their parents, their parents, their parents, their parents, their parents. About four more sets of those. That's what your kids will do.
00:04:44.068 - 00:04:58.944, Speaker B: Your name might even be farmer. That's who you are. And if you ever had an idea to change that, if you said, hmm, this authority, I don't quite think it's legitimate. I think these institutions are failing. That idea probably never would have occurred to you. Ideas aren't transferred around. There isn't mass communication.
00:04:58.944 - 00:05:25.122, Speaker B: You can't read, you can't write, and those ideas are sealed in documents of power. So it's very difficult for you to have a. A different idea. Occasionally, things bubbled up from time to time. Ideas that rights and values should be different. And those were brutally smashed down, partially because it couldn't grain enough critical mass from the community, because you couldn't share ideas, and you didn't have capital to pursue those ideas. Wealth was permissioned.
00:05:25.122 - 00:05:46.526, Speaker B: It was concentrated. Most wealth was in land and animals. That seems crazy until you realize most people's wealth is in their house. Today, it's land and animals, but you didn't have access to that, just statistically speaking. And yeah, there was some coin and currency, but that really wasn't for you. And you couldn't spend it as you wanted to anyway. There are things called sumptuary laws, and so you didn't have access to wealth.
00:05:46.526 - 00:06:13.286, Speaker B: You didn't have access to spend your money as you wanted to. You couldn't communicate at scale. New ideas wouldn't impact you. And like, these two things, like fuse to form your identity, the idea of the new wouldn't have occurred to you. It was so effective in terms of hegemony. Like, for them, religion wasn't just private belief, it was the structure of their, like, cosmic reality. And at the top of it, there were authority figures, pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, archdeacons, subdeacons, priests, prelates, all the way down.
00:06:13.286 - 00:06:33.346, Speaker B: And you. And the same thing with you, the political apparatus which was interwoven, Holy Roman emperor, imperial electors, all the way down. And then there's you. And you're at the bottom of both of these things. And so as a historian, and I'm kind of an odd one, in that I look at complex systems and even kind of modern events, we pull on these threads. One was value. All your value was permissioned.
00:06:33.346 - 00:06:46.266, Speaker B: One was communication. Your communication was permission. And one was identity. These two things stick you. They put you where you are, and you're not going to change that. Your stars are set. You are a farmer, you will die a farmer.
00:06:46.266 - 00:07:14.654, Speaker B: Your kids will be farmers. Don't even think about anything else. You can leave your land without permission, you can accumulate wealth without permission, and most of the time those people in authority would deny you access to that. That was your life. The kicker about it is, and this is the crazy part about it, it wouldn't have occurred to medieval you that you were permissioned. The idea of being permissioned means, you know what being permissioned less is like that you know what agency or the ability to do other things is like, that was your world. That was the air you breathed.
00:07:14.654 - 00:07:56.366, Speaker B: You're like a goldfish in a bowl. It never would have occurred to you that that was wrong or even that that was the case. And so sometimes I make this comparison and say, hey, you know, medieval you, what a chump, right? Like it didn't even occur to you, but like, what will future historians say about us? And so I kind of walk through those same threads and say, value. You think you control your own money, right? Maybe, unless it's worth less and less every year and you don't even know how much less it's worth. Do you believe the CPI or that you can spend it any way you want to? You're not subject to those like medieval sanctuary laws, right? I mean, I tried to use a credit card to attend a crypto event and that credit card denied payment. And they said, we know the content is not fraudulent. We just don't like those ideas being discussed.
00:07:56.366 - 00:08:28.820, Speaker B: We're not going to run it on your rails or communication. Like, obviously they can, they can deplatform you, right? Like that's just for the crazies. Historically, it tends not to work out real well for the rest of us when you start deplatforming the crazies. Or they could cut the cord, there won't be another arab spring like we saw in Egypt. Like they know how to cut the cord now. And so things like decentralized broadcast and DVPN is incredibly important. But worse still, they may let you keep talking, which means like a medieval, they may transmute your time and attention into their product and web two and faang like a medieval lord.
00:08:28.820 - 00:08:59.836, Speaker B: They'll harvest the fruits of your interaction and you don't even know it. And they might use a magical incantation to shape your reality, what you see and what you respond to called an algorithm. And so, in many ways, we're very similar to our medieval twins. Our life is permissioned in a number of ways, and we're not aware of it. So that's kind of the setup. So when I look at what's happening today, I say, hey, value being concentrated, communication largely commissioned, and, like identity, the point is, it never occurs to us is very similar to what we saw in the middle ages, if that. That makes sense.
00:08:59.836 - 00:09:01.084, Speaker B: It's a crazy thing to say.
00:09:01.164 - 00:09:19.580, Speaker A: It does make sense. It does make sense. So, I mean, there's so much to unpack there. And I think one point to maybe double click on is just identity. And within identity, just the idea that you could have new ideas that really started to shape what a new identity looked like. I was a farmer. My father was a farmer, his father was a farmer.
00:09:19.580 - 00:09:44.288, Speaker A: And now, for the first time ever, you have new ideas. And I think it's important to just explore, like in crypto, paying homage to the matrix, we call it. Like, did they take the red pill? Right? Are they red pilled? Are they down the rabbit hole? And what allowed people in the renaissance to go from farmer to farmer to farmer to farmer to. I'm taking the red pill and I'm expanding my mind. Like, what happened here?
00:09:44.456 - 00:10:04.382, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. In some ways. I mean, it's one of the craziest transformations ever. Like I said, there are a number of renaissances before. When we say Renaissance, we think of, like, cutesy angels or Michelangelo or this or that. That's because that's one we remember. There were a number of renaissances before that, kind of known to historians today, but we've forgotten about all of those because they didn't last.
00:10:04.382 - 00:10:39.450, Speaker B: They didn't have staying power. They really didn't transform at an epic scale. And the one we think of did, partially because it succeeded where all other renaissances failed, because communities use two different type. They use decentralized technology. So it kind of gets to what drives history. Do you think it's means of production? Do you think it's great? Men with ideas actually think it's like communities using technology, and they used a particular type of technology, not just Silicon Valley kind of hedge funds say better, faster, cheaper, like, specifically decentralized technology. And this decentralized technology had a generative function baked into it.
00:10:39.450 - 00:11:11.434, Speaker B: And so it kind of didn't need adoption, it created its own adoption. And so, specifically, if we pull on those same threads, so they started using for value, there was a new protocol. It was called double entry bookkeeping. You may know of it as, like, ledger based accounting, right? And so one of these families out in the middle of nowhere, you hadn't heard of them at the time, they're in the Styx in the south of France. They did the Renaissance thing and went ad fontes back to the sources, dusted off this book, and they came up with a new way to do accounting. Instead of doing transaction reconciliation. Transaction reconciliation.
00:11:11.434 - 00:11:43.406, Speaker B: They did debit and credit. And so that allowed them to. To create all sorts of new financial fundamentals to increase speed and to unlock capital, which there wasn't enough coin to handle credit in any way. And so it just exploded and transformed, like, the nature of finance. And so that meant new players won. This family called the Medici, went from nobody to taking the papal seat and the throne of France. But they also, along with everybody else, started disseminating that capital in these new financials, which weren't available previously without this ledger based protocol.
00:11:43.406 - 00:12:26.340, Speaker B: And so now you have loans, tens of thousands of loans, hundreds of thousands of loans. You could have left your farm, but now you can. You can get a little loan and you can't read or write, but you kind of keep a little ledger, and you can make these chicken scratches in it and kind of know what's going on. So you actually, financially can leave. But then, like, would the idea have ever occurred to you? At the same time as that permissionless financial protocol was taking over the world by storm, so, too, there was a permissionless communication protocol, and that was the printing press, which in the Internet, everybody says, oh, the printing press is like the Internet, blah, blah, blah. I'd say the Internet might have been that, but it kind of followed this false fork to where now it's reaggregated what I was talking about, the medieval lords being able to control it. So, at the time, the printing press was crazy.
00:12:26.340 - 00:12:41.996, Speaker B: Like those documents of power, not just ideas, but access to capital, access to rights. You didn't have access to those. Those are sealed on manuscripts. They're incredibly difficult to get ahold of. They're geographically proxied. You'd have to travel somewhere. Someone would have to let you in.
00:12:41.996 - 00:13:13.402, Speaker B: And writing a little thing would take, like, a year, basically, to copy. Right. Super expensive. And the printing press was, like, crazy. Like, by all objective of standards, it was a horrible idea. Right? Like, Gutenberg would have got kicked out of every venture capitalist office, because he's taken out this protocol where only 5% of the people are eligible for, like, only 5% of people read, right? You can't take that protocol to market. And yet that printed protocol had this generative nature, where it not only created its own market, creating literacy, it created new types of interpretation, communication that we couldn't have otherwise imagined.
00:13:13.402 - 00:13:40.934, Speaker B: And so you're printing, and it's very decentralized. Like, you could set up a print shop in the back of a store, and, like, no one would know it. Some cities tried to KYC printers, but it didn't take a lot to skirt that. And sometimes they complied. But the point was, it was everywhere instantly, and it proved unstoppable in a number of ways. And rather than when we say printing press, we think of, like, Gutenberg's Bible and these long textual based things that take forever to print. That wasn't what you saw medieval, you moving into Renaissance, you didn't see that.
00:13:40.934 - 00:14:04.130, Speaker B: You saw Pflugschrift in a giant broadsheet, right? And it had an image on it, a woodcut image or a copper etched image. And so you hadn't seen art before medieval. You had seen, like, you know, art was 2d, flat and symbolic, but you hadn't seen it. It hadn't made its way to you. And now, all of a sudden, you're seeing art at scale. So the printing press allowed art at scale. And it wasn't just art that was pretty.
00:14:04.130 - 00:14:35.404, Speaker B: It was art that communicated meaning. It had semiotic impact, that these symbols meant something, and they meant that the reality you were experiencing was only one of many possible realities. You could change your stars, if you will, and those things had snappy taglines on it, so you might not be able to read, but you get your buddies together, and you're doing it down at a public, you're doing it at a bar, and you can kind of figure out what's going on. And it basically was a sharp knife that just pricked authority. Some of these are crazy images, like demons pooping out authority figures. To us, it'd be like money, printer, go, brrrr. You see that thing and you go, oh, wow.
00:14:35.484 - 00:14:37.848, Speaker A: They're the memes, the memes of the Renaissance.
00:14:38.036 - 00:14:58.816, Speaker B: They literally were memes. I mean, there's always symbology before, but it was symbology plus mass media where you could do it at scale. And so now these things are flying all over the place. And farmer, you says, hey, the authority that keeps you permissioned is illegitimate. You can do something else here's a bit of capital to get you started. These things is the birth of proto mercantilism, the birth of capitalism. So that was crazy.
00:14:58.816 - 00:15:39.912, Speaker B: And then also there was a mind shift, too, that was communicated in those ideas where previously, like the sacred, was purely religious, and that was all that was worth being commemorated, and the common and profane and mundane wasn't. So you see the art shift and the technology is baked into the art, which is worth noting. It looked weird and odd to the power holders at the time, but to the people who were seeing it for the first time, they understood the meaning and the symbolic unpack. And part of that symbolic unpack was that being apart from the world wasn't the only thing that was worthwhile. So in medieval, you, you are a farmer, you're worth nothing because you're toiling away in the world. The people that had value, they were outside the world. They were often a monastery or cloister or nunnery.
00:15:39.912 - 00:16:16.916, Speaker B: And now these images come along and they say, hey, what you're doing in this world with your family and your friends and your community members and even your work, you can work in finance, and that's a glorious, amazing thing to do. That was radically transforming to say not only are you not subject to authority, which says you can't be participating in this world, you have capital, you have ideas. And one of those ideas is that that cosmic hierarchy is flattened and what you do in this world matters. And that was enough to get a lot of people to leave the monasteries and you to leave your farm. And you started all these crazy new economic models thanks to these new financial fundamentals. That's a long answer, but it's a big question. Yes.
00:16:16.980 - 00:16:40.144, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I think the two most important things there are just that. There's the creation of two different things. You had double entry bookkeeping and the spawn of the Medici family, right? And then you also had Gutenberg. I love the Gutenberg story, right? Because I think, if I remember that story correctly, it was really technology that was invented in China, but Gutenberg builds it in Germany. I might be wrong about this. He builds it in Germany because he thinks there's a market for this.
00:16:40.144 - 00:16:58.284, Speaker A: But when you actually look back at how Gutenberg talks about the printing press, he just. The market size, the Tam was so, so, so off, right? He thought he could produce books by. It was like the hundreds or the thousands. He never thought. It was like. He never thought. I mean, how many books are out there? Billions of books probably now, right? He was just orders of magnitude off.
00:16:58.284 - 00:17:16.772, Speaker A: And it just reminds me so much of. I want to draw analogies to crypto, but also just analogies to the Internet, right? Like the total addressable market of what people thought the Internet could be. And now what. What folks think crypto will be is just orders of magnitudes off from what most folks think it will be.
00:17:16.908 - 00:17:35.716, Speaker B: Now, that's one of the things. Like, when you tell the story, you kind of shorthand, but you could. None of these things were new. There were iterations, you know, print, chinese, double entry bookkeeping coming from roman, from plenty north african communities. The ad fontes piece was kind of the Renaissance thing. Going back to sources was rediscovering a lot of this. And your point to the tam is really important.
00:17:35.716 - 00:18:18.978, Speaker B: So if you view web two. So I kind of view history as a pendulum swinging back and forth, broad strokes between aggregation, consolidation, which is tam, total, addressable market, big as you can get, own, all of it, and decentralization. And maybe it just swings back and forth, maybe it ratchets up and thesis, antithesis, synthesis. But either way, you know, the world we're now is very hierarchical in terms of permission and value aggregation. And part of that is our business models reward that, right? You want as big a total address mark as you can get, and you want as much of it as you can get. And that's kind of like Fang's playbook, right? And so, like saying crypto is saying, hey, I can take pieces of that Tam and pull them out and redistribute them to the little people along the long tail and part of that ownership economy. So it's a different fundamental, like, model towards that.
00:18:18.978 - 00:19:00.494, Speaker B: And that's actually what Gutenberg, like, ran into. He thought Tam was one thing, and the ability to scale that, to take those pieces of value out and distribute them, scatter them, like, seed them all along the long tail, it can grow, it can compound infinitely in ways you can't imagine. An example of that. He thought he could only sell a few thousand books, and he was probably right. It only was at the time, books were not what sold. It was this new form of media which he couldn't have otherwise imagined. This giant broadsheet that was what went tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, like Luther in any given years, accounting for, like, 50% of the things printed with these broadsheets, right? And so, like, the decentralized technology created or recreated the tam in a fundamental way.
00:19:00.494 - 00:19:44.000, Speaker B: And so we look back and we say, hey, renaissance was highbrow, and it was hoity, and there definitely was a bit of that because it was remaking institutions. But mostly it was a common, it was a commoners, it was a lowbrow phenomenon, right? It was in the bars with these images. And that's what Gutenberg couldn't quite figure that out. And part of that is kind of what we see in crypto too. Like, if you really believe that this decentralized technology is generative, if, I mean, it can create like, it can solve perverse incentives, it can create like virtuous cycles out, not just through smart contracts, but through social coordination, like in fundamental ways we haven't seen before. It allows you to do amazing things. And at the Renaissance, it was a couple memes were doing what hundreds of thousands of imperial mercenaries couldn't.
00:19:44.000 - 00:20:00.068, Speaker B: They're taking down these hierarchies. Same thing today. One of the other good questions, historians, if you want to get super advanced, go into the AP class. You always look at continuity versus discontinuity. How is it similar? How was it different? In some ways, yeah. The Internet for sure. You have this in mass, you have this in scale.
00:20:00.068 - 00:20:21.434, Speaker B: The difference was, right now, you don't own what you create. For the most part. That's a medieval Lords fang, aggregators, harvesting that. And with the printing press, that wasn't the case. The people actually owned those copies and were able to sell that. So the value, the ownership, was baked into the communication. And it wasn't just anytime you have that happening in a cultural recreation, it follows this pathway.
00:20:21.434 - 00:20:46.074, Speaker B: It starts with finance, because it's the most valuable. Then it goes into identity, which we see with nfts and things like that. Then you go into work with those, and then you go into school and education for propagation. And then you go into people who aren't interested in the movement, but just in the benefits. In that case, it may be like crypto as a business model, not just metaverse, but turning cost centers into revenue generators. And so what happened with the printing press was people were participating. Art became more fluid.
00:20:46.074 - 00:21:19.802, Speaker B: It wasn't just an artist ticking off a box. People were participating in different ways. And by having the ownership layered on to the object of sociality, they could participate in ownership in different ways. And that's what opened up all sorts of things, whether you're a printer or you're an artist and you're now getting paid for that, or whether you're a disseminator or distributor. The thing you see is a layer, an image of the underlying social coordination. Not to get too crazy and philosophical on it, but all these things if you look at the Web 2.0 philosophical darlings like McLuhan and those guys, like, they say, hey, mass media.
00:21:19.802 - 00:22:08.874, Speaker B: And you have the advent of it and the media, and the message is tied to the media. It's like McLuhan's first book was the Gutenberg Galaxy, right? He starts with Gutenberg for a reason. And we've been kind of talking about this as we've been reaggregating into kind of modern, kind of federal fang tam aggregation. Our philosophers have been starting to say, hey, imagine a world, or science fiction writers, imagine a world where you basically can have media where it's owned, or where you have consensual interaction on technological rails like McLuhan loves Chardin, and that's like news sphere, which we'd call the Internet. And so, like, now you have, for the first time in history, the technological capabilities to take this renaissance further than we've ever seen before. The last Renaissance worked where the other ones failed because we had technological capabilities, double entry bookkeeping and printing in a way that we hadn't before. And now we're engaging in this quantum leap.
00:22:08.874 - 00:22:21.344, Speaker B: We started with ATT and Ck and said, oh, we can do the Internet. Maybe we can do a bit of this, like, digital banking stuff. And now we have these underlying primitives. And, like, it's not just arithmetic. It's not one plus one. And now we get two. It goes hyperbolic.
00:22:21.344 - 00:22:53.976, Speaker B: All this could be wrong, but this is kind of what tends to happen in history. If you look over these long epics, and that's the last thing I'll say, is that it's this weird irony or paradox. It's an inverse correlation that the people that are witnessing the greatest transformations in history are the least likely to recognize at the time. If you read the medieval historians or they're in a place, they just don't recognize what's going on. And one of the images in history, I always use a metaphor, is waves or the ocean. And so these deep waves, you don't notice those. These currents, maybe you kind of see, but you see the little ripples on top.
00:22:53.976 - 00:23:11.426, Speaker B: And so it's just too difficult for us to, like, notice as waves. What you do see is you do see the destruction and you see the chaos. Like, to the people in the Renaissance, they didn't think it was a glorious time with gilded angels. They thought it was the end of their world. Their currency was largely worthless. They thought their institutions were crumbling. It was super volatile.
00:23:11.426 - 00:23:33.202, Speaker B: They thought they were done. And that's one of the things that history can do to kind of, like, help guide us is to allow us to say, hey, is this the end of the world? Or is this part of the deconstruction and the recreation? And, like, everything I see, and this isn't just me pontificating. This is like years in the archives looking through, like, the source code, if you will. It looks really, really, really similar to what we're seeing today.
00:23:33.338 - 00:23:51.804, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels. It feels very. It feels like Neil Howe could have had a field day. It feels like the fourth turning could have been written in the Renaissance as well. You know, there's a lot of fear and, like, you know, you have this big, like, just a lot of spook. Like, just everyone's basically spooked and basically this mass fear in the market. And every.
00:23:51.804 - 00:24:04.764, Speaker A: Your way of life is changing. And to you, the person who your life is changing, it's scary. But to us, hundreds of years later, looking back, you say, what a glorious time. And I do feel like folks could look back on today and think something similar.
00:24:04.884 - 00:24:18.422, Speaker B: Yeah, this isn't like when stuff really dies historically, it doesn't die with a bang and market chaos. It dies with a whimper. And you don't notice it. It's like fall of the roman empire. The historians, like, wait, was it this date or this date? We don't know.
00:24:18.438 - 00:24:22.438, Speaker A: Unless you're Luna, unless you're Doquan. And you really end with a bang.
00:24:22.526 - 00:24:34.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Even that. It's just from a historic perspective, we've been doing this, what, like, a few years, right? I mean, like. I mean, we're so early in this. Like, I know it's not pleasant. Like, we're deeply affected by this.
00:24:34.570 - 00:24:46.906, Speaker B: Right? Like, we have our guts punched, too. But it's like, you have a choice. You can either, like, be suckled by these, like, medieval institutions, and that's, like, super soothing. They're playing lullabies for you, and that feels good. You go to college, you get the office. You work in finance. Da da da.
00:24:46.906 - 00:25:10.066, Speaker B: Or you can kind of go out on your own. If you go out on your own, you do get punched in the gut. That happens every single time. But, like, if you're not experiencing that volatility, someone else is doing it on your behalf and they're arbitraging you. And, like, the risk is actually staying in a failing, like, status static system. That's when, like, things go bad. This stuff, as crazy as it sounds, is actually a leading indicator of it working out.
00:25:10.066 - 00:25:31.154, Speaker B: Doesn't mean you're not going to take losses short term. But this fits the rhyme, it fits the pattern. It fits. The general rubric of what happens is things are massively transformed from a pascalian wager. What do you get if you lose? You participate in crypto, you lost some money, not good. You wasted some time. You met some people that are nutty.
00:25:31.154 - 00:25:45.336, Speaker B: You learned some other technology, fine. You saw a glimpse of what the world could have been. And if you win, like, it's just asymmetric, though. There's nothing else out there. So I think it's worth making that bet. But, yeah, it doesn't feel good. But honestly, this is just part of it.
00:25:45.336 - 00:26:13.446, Speaker B: It doesn't make it better, but this is what it looks like during a renaissance. Like, historians always wear these rose colored glasses, and you're like. You talk about all the people that kind of kept their hand and kept their cool and blah, blah, blah. You forget about, like, you can either beat the market or beat reality by, like, betting against it, which is very difficult to do, or getting in big on something early. And, like, this has all the tells of being something early, including the volatility, is actually a tell, which is kind of a crazy take, but at least historically speaking, tends to be true.
00:26:13.550 - 00:26:32.408, Speaker A: No, I tend to agree with you. So if I'm speaking it back to you, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, basically, the Middle Ages could be described in one word, which was just aggregated, right? Like, both value and information were centralized. Culture was top down. The church held the power. The church centralized and guarded information. You were a farmer. Your dad was a farmer.
00:26:32.408 - 00:26:47.624, Speaker A: Your kids are going to be farmers. You didn't travel far from your farm. You didn't read, you didn't write. You farmed, right? And identity, therefore, was very permissioned. It was this strict hierarchy. You were born into this, like, rigid system where farmers stayed. Farmers otherwise put.
00:26:47.624 - 00:27:07.438, Speaker A: Maybe you have, like, a lack of identity, you might want to call it, or maybe just a very permissioned identity. And I think you also mentioned something around just literature, right? Like, information. And writing was often very esoteric. It was maybe in Latin. It was stored in private places. Literacy was extremely low. And boom, you get two technologies.
00:27:07.438 - 00:27:35.644, Speaker A: You get the double entry bookkeeping, popularized by the Medicis. It increased the money velocity. You had these new financial products and loans and maybe what feels like defi today or bitcoin or ETH. That's kind of what I'm hearing when you say these things. And it led to this economic rise to power through this new ledger based tech. It feels so similar to today. And then you have the printing press, and for the first time, ideas could be spread permissionlessly in a permissionless manner.
00:27:35.644 - 00:28:15.042, Speaker A: Huge threat to the church. Sounds like they tried to kyc it, couldn't shut it down. Only 5% of the population was literate. So maybe a bad idea, but no, we get memes, and memes make it into the bars because of the printing press. And now these ideas that used to be challenged behind closed doors, they could now be printed, and the velocity of the memes increased. And what this did is it basically just unlocked. It turned Italy, I think, Florence maybe was the hub into this cultural center of Europe, and that brought new art and new jobs and new ideas to the table, and that sparked what we know as the Renaissance.
00:28:15.042 - 00:28:22.664, Speaker A: And. Oh, my God, even as I'm just saying that it sounds so similar to today. It really does. So, I mean, I'm curious, how did we do there?
00:28:22.824 - 00:28:33.120, Speaker B: No, that's pretty good, man. You were a history student. That's better than I could have rambled on. No, that's like, that's so good. That's the thing. For them, Renaissance was a recreation. Like, literally, the word means rebirth.
00:28:33.120 - 00:29:01.008, Speaker B: It's like death of something, recreation of their society. They thought their world was going to end, and they were right. It was destroyed and recreated at every level, military, economic, political work, social art, identity, philosophy, ontology, epistemology. Anywhere you want to go, we could go into that. That's 1000% correct. The technology was decentralized, which had this generative nature, which meant that it kind of created it. Literally created it.
00:29:01.008 - 00:29:30.626, Speaker B: Renaissance things, if you want to use that as a verb. Stuff that shouldn't have worked. When Gutenberg says, I don't think it'll work, or somebody thinks it won't work, it did work because the decentralized nature of it allowed different people to share in the ownership and created these virtuous cycles along the tail that wasn't possible before, versus just aggregating Tam. And it tended to work in ways that we couldn't expect. If you look at history of innovations, it's always two folds. One is same thing as before. Better, faster, cheaper, fine.
00:29:30.626 - 00:29:49.904, Speaker B: And then there's the next fold, which is something we couldn't otherwise imagine, which wouldn't have been not only possible without this tech, but we couldn't have otherwise imagined. And so you're essentially unlocking communities to work together, which sounds so simple, but it's like, if I want to get you to do something, or if we want to work together, I can pay you and I can share ideas and coordinate.
00:29:49.944 - 00:29:50.096, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:50.120 - 00:30:12.732, Speaker B: And without those two things, that just wasn't there. So it was really crazy. And like, yeah, that your identity was given to you. It was top down. And so it was something you were given, and you could say, the church just wasn't the church. It was the whole structure, right? So that's, like, what you were born into. And like, those religious links were socioeconomic links essentially, too, right? Oaths of fidelity and obligation and the reason why you'd honor a contract.
00:30:12.732 - 00:30:40.208, Speaker B: And so when those Luther came along, Satoshi just forked all that, and all that giant pyramid just goes tumbling down instantly. And so now the question is, what do you want to do? Which is crazy to say, hey, he essentially forked their reality at every conceivable level. And so that kind of smashes your world apart. But now you have these other tools in hand, and you can work with other people in the same situation. So totally scary. You're out of the nursery. Super volatile craziness ensues.
00:30:40.208 - 00:31:11.392, Speaker B: Lots of people point out, like, there's craziness afterwards, wars of religion, all sorts of stuff. Like, yeah, totally true. But the interesting thing about it, like, is if you play the story forward, so that's kind of where we are. Same thing. The reason why the tech is generative, too, is because it was a sandbox. They're experimenting with fundamentals, right? Financial fundamentals, governance fundamentals, like these little things that became our constitution or became edict of nantes or something. Like, all these things were up for grabs, and they played around in the sandbox, and, like, a thousand flowers were blooming, as crazy as that sounds.
00:31:11.392 - 00:31:43.610, Speaker B: And so we play it forward. What happens? Renaissance. Good times. And then stuff starts aggregating again, right? Like, the pendulum swings back again, and, like, it aggregated through really specific means. It aggregated through, like, three kind of things. It aggregated through, like, identity. The power holders came and said, okay, so the decentralized technology put the power holders in check because they could either ignore it and lose ground, or they could participate in it and thereby legitimize it, right? Are you going to let these Protestants run around with printing press? No, you need to kyc it.
00:31:43.610 - 00:32:02.050, Speaker B: That doesn't work. Okay, so we keep ignoring it, and they keep graining adherence. Or we participate and thereby we legitimize not just the technology, but the idea that a different reality could be valid as well. And so that's kind of what happened. That didn't work out so well. And then they started re aggregating, and they did that part partially through identity. They said, hey, you didn't know this.
00:32:02.050 - 00:32:19.602, Speaker B: You always thought you're part of a family or part of a geography. You're part of this, like, nation. You didn't know that? Congratulations. Nation means we have certain abilities to, like, look at you, to observe, and you have all these obligations to us. Surprise. They also, like, monitored very carefully. Language, too.
00:32:19.602 - 00:32:42.990, Speaker B: And then finally, they really nailed down property rights. Like, the great Achilles heel in the Renaissance was property rights. You could take your currency with you. You could take a little ledger, which represented value, broadsheet in your sack, but you couldn't take your house or your thing. And so that's one of the differences, like doing that historical compare and contrast. One of the differences that we see with this renaissance is same thing, very similar. You're 1000% right.
00:32:42.990 - 00:32:58.694, Speaker B: The difference this time is that we have property rights on chain. We call them nfts. You think of them as pixelated cats. It's fine. But it's property rights on chain for synthetic things and irl things, which is crazy. And that's like. Again, it's not just arithmetic.
00:32:58.694 - 00:33:21.070, Speaker B: That's a hyperbolic unlock, the likes of which we've never seen. So we're facing much stronger hegemony, like we're permissioned. And when I say much stronger, they're more sophisticated at it. Just like medieval Lord windowed your identity, so you couldn't think of anything else, like Overton window or what have you. Our permissioned structures are much more subtle. They're much softer. We tend not to notice them.
00:33:21.070 - 00:33:41.610, Speaker B: Right? Just like medieval you. If you're a nation state and you have to use four center people, you get an f. If you have to threaten it, you get a c. If it never occurs to them to do that, you get an a, you've done a good job. And so those are the tools that we're seeing. So we're up against that with these new weapons or tools that we can use at the same time. Back to your Neil Howe and things breaking down.
00:33:41.610 - 00:34:07.618, Speaker B: We are starting to see that really fundamentally. So it's really interesting. Our world is static. We have these institutions. We're born in this blip, right? You and I are born in this blip, where there's these pathways and playbooks that tend to work, go to school, get a job, things tend to work out for you, maybe, depending upon who you are, all that is coming unwound institutionally. So it's a really weird time. And what crypto did back then is what it's doing.
00:34:07.618 - 00:34:45.174, Speaker B: Now it introduces a new variable in the mix. It splits the reality. So previously we'd have these clan warfares or we'd have these national conflicts and we'd be friends with somebody and enemies with somebody. You'd have an xy access on the political spectrum, conservative and liberal, fiscal and social. Maybe it doesn't match up, but you at least knew what it was. Now, Crypto gave them this z axis, like, are you closer with somebody who has your values and are in crypto? Are you closer to somebody who has non crypto values that are outside of crypto? It split everything. And so, post Bretton woods, in our reality, we have not first world, second world, third world, rich and poor.
00:34:45.174 - 00:35:09.886, Speaker B: It really is who's for us, who's against us and who's undecided. And so crypto is splitting that. And just like you said, with Florence popping up and little city states that were in the middle of nowhere, there were other things on the global scene, too, by people who adopted that. It gave them access and rights. And so we're seeing the same kind of thing. This enemy of my enemy is my friend. And the political lines being redrawn, not just social and fiscal, conservative and liberal, but also crypto.
00:35:09.886 - 00:35:37.918, Speaker B: Are you into, like, independent, call it sovereignty, basically. And that kind of got hijacked a little bit by crypto anarchists, which is fine, but we're starting to see the development of this sovereignty as community, which is like, all that's long story short to say, as you play this forward, we reaggregate. We're at the eve of the middle age, or we're in the middle ages. We're on the eve of the Renaissance. It's very similar. Now we have nfts for property rights. And the crazy thing about it is, what are we going to do with it this time? History will judge us by what we do.
00:35:37.918 - 00:35:48.594, Speaker B: So these blips and volatility, that's what we should see. The question is, what are we going to do? And you just don't get these chances in history that often. It just never happens. That's the point we're at.
00:35:49.734 - 00:36:14.366, Speaker A: All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Paris. Swap, the best platform to stake. Swap, trademark farm and more. Paraswap just launched. Gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in Defi or maybe it's just starting out.
00:36:14.366 - 00:36:38.192, Speaker A: You know how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get. The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time, and now you can get those is entirely refunded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp. Big shout out to the Paraswapdao for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just. It's tough to beat Paraswap right now. They give you the best prices.
00:36:38.192 - 00:37:16.506, Speaker A: They save you money. You've got this gas refund if you stake PSP. They've got a smooth and really user friendly interface, fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a defi platform if you don't use them already. Check out Paraswap today at Paraswap IO. Now let's get back to the show. I can't help but think my biggest takeaway from everything you just said is that what happened in the renaissance was there was an excitement around identity for the first time in maybe hundreds of years or thousands of years, right? You have excitement around your identity because of the freedom that you have.
00:37:16.506 - 00:38:13.468, Speaker A: And I actually see a lot of similarities to today. Right? Like, no matter where you're born into, in, let's call it America, you kind of have this almost predetermined path, right? If you're, like, very low income, born into poverty, you kind of have. That's your identity, and that's your path, and hopefully you can break out. And the same thing exists if you're born into, like, a very wealthy family, right? You're born in Greenwich, Connecticut, or, like, Upper Eastside, New York. Like, you're going to be a lawyer, you're going into finance. Like, you're going to be fine, but, like, man, that's not that exciting of a life, right? And so when I think about what's happening in crypto, like, when I hang out, the reason I love hanging out with all my weird Internet crypto friends is there's this just, like, palpable excitement that exists, you know? And there's just so much optimism and enthusiasm and just excitement around what you're doing, which really what you're doing becomes your identity. And it feels like there are a lot of similarities to the Renaissance.
00:38:13.468 - 00:38:36.000, Speaker A: And I'm so curious to get your take around identity. And especially when I think about what's happening with, I mean, paradigm, like, paradigm, hired a high schooler. That has never happened before. That's not something. That's not that high schooler's identity. Like, they're high schooler, and then they have to go to college, and then they get internships, like they're breaking the mold of identity. And it feels like the last time we saw this was maybe the Renaissance.
00:38:36.192 - 00:38:58.756, Speaker B: No, that's exactly right. Like, you actually get to choose, right? You couldn't choose where you were born. You couldn't choose your lines of patronage and allegiance. You couldn't choose any of that. And with the Renaissance, you actually could choose. You could actually choose your beliefs actually determined your identity and the symbols you wore. And are you this group or that group that unlocks certain things? It made you the enemy of these people.
00:38:58.756 - 00:39:41.764, Speaker B: It made you friends with these people, and that had different opportunities for employment, for finance, for spread of ideas. These things forked, and then eventually, it became political and military as well. You could actually choose for the first time, which was really. Which was really crazy previously, your identity was set, and then you could kind of go up or down a ladder, depending upon the degree to which you participated in institutions. The birth of that privileged knowledge, and geographically gating it, that's the birth of the medieval universities. You're behind this thing, being able to say, hey, you don't have to go to a specific location to be exposed to an idea. In the Middle Ages, you can actually see the same idea in print anywhere.
00:39:41.764 - 00:40:06.892, Speaker B: You are in the middle of nowhere. That opened up different worlds for them. They could participate not just in the exchange of ideas, but opening up different types of profession. It fundamentally toppled who they were. A lot of the movements adherents were from lower classes. Why? Because they actually had the opportunity to not just accumulate wealth, but change what they did, but also how they thought about themselves. That's why that ideological impact.
00:40:06.892 - 00:40:57.880, Speaker B: To say the most valuable thing isn't outside the world. It's you participating in this community, doing something together. I mean, the same thing with crypto. To say the most important thing isn't, like, private bank this or that or elite arter behind these gates, but to say, like, anyone has access to this, and it's not just like, something you a sticker you put on your VW bus. There's, like, there's real economics tied to that, because you have ownership baked into the media, and you can experiment with these fundamentals. And so, like, you being able to control your identity, that's the fifth bucket. You know, you go from finance into identity, and then you go into working and then into education, that last bucket to say, hey, and this is, again, uniquely, with this renaissance through these property rights, to say you could actually work wherever you are, not just remote work, but you can work in a synthetic world, right? And you can earn in a synthetic world and enjoy the fruits in the IRL, and arbitrage the difference, which is craziness.
00:40:57.880 - 00:41:49.520, Speaker B: Or you can work in like IRL, enjoy the fruits in a synthetic world where if you're careful, they can't have access to that property. Nfts acting as these bi directional doorways that allow you to enter these synthetic worlds. This gets a bit esoteric, but this is not something you teach to undergrads. But you often say, hey, the idea of imagination and invention and synthetic worlds, a lot of that is spun out of print. For the first time, you're exposed to not just morality tales, but these ideas of different worlds that aren't yet print is really the advent of the synthetic, showing you what's not real and what could be that allows you to participate in it and change your fate and fortune and alliances here in this real world. And that's literally what we're seeing. The same thing, even down to the art looking weird and odd, because that art is baked into the tech, which has monetary value on it, and semiotic, meaning you're unpacking this meaning to it.
00:41:49.520 - 00:42:17.332, Speaker B: So, yeah, really unlocking these new worlds. And that wasn't just european, it was global, and you could extend it around that, but we're seeing very, very similar things take place. And yeah, you can still find the outliers and say, hey, you're under this regime here, and you don't have access to is here. And that's true. But we're starting to see a dislocation, the Irl slip and slide from the synthetic. And you, as your identity, be able to say, hey, in this plane, my identity is determined. In this plane, it's not.
00:42:17.332 - 00:42:41.450, Speaker B: And now this one can generate into that one. And so it gets real dicey, like the historical way you always tell this is, oh, there are these wars of religion, people crack down. The history was really more complex. It was slipping, it was sliding. There were little pockets of geographies that popped up maybe near you, my enemy, and my enemy could be a friend. A geography that took advantage of it. Early days would become a powerhouse for the next few hundred years.
00:42:41.450 - 00:43:15.202, Speaker B: And so, yeah, we're seeing that dislocation of identity and identity that's kind of the superset, and NFT allows you to do that. Where I spend my time mentally is a function of who I talk to, messaging and communication, and how I spend my money with assets or property or currency. For things or helping others. Like, it all kind of goes together. And just like at the last renaissance, we saw this explosion of governance. If now I'm not being told what to do in hierarchy, if I can have representative functions in different ways. And these are new fundamentals, we see new fundamentals in finance, but so too, in governance.
00:43:15.202 - 00:43:45.126, Speaker B: You know, pluralism, federal republicanism, like all these, like, governmental experiences that are, like, unfolding. So we say we speed run art, fine. Like, down to the details. Like, I'm generated, I'm on chain, I'm a participant. We speed run finance, we're doing that. It's bumpy for sure, but that's what happens. And now the next phase is speedrunning this governance to say, how does it work? And what I would predict in this unique historical moment is as our globalization deteriorates for a variety of reasons, see Peter Zion.
00:43:45.126 - 00:44:37.580, Speaker B: And as our institutions fail, atrophy for a variety of reasons, crypto, by being decentralized, allows us to instantiate our identity and retract it in different ways in different places. Just like the renaissance wasn't a spectrum, it wasn't highbrow art here and low brow art here. So to identity, like your Kyc state issue, identity versus your anon, tied to an address where you have proof of experience or expertise or accomplishment, and you're a high school kid. In paradigm, we hire anon kids all the time. It changes the nature of saying, I'm not a byproduct of credentialism from external party, it's from the community and my accomplishments, which is really much more meritocritous and kind of balkanized, allowing multiple things to coexist at the same time. In a aggregated world where TAm is everything, there's one thing only one can win. Maybe two trad VC's will talk about duopolies, maybe two.
00:44:37.580 - 00:45:14.164, Speaker B: In a crypto world where I'm taking pieces of TAm and scattering it, now, multiple things can win with different design choices, right? It might be CFI and defi, this chain, that chain, and like, rather than a mono ism, where there has to be one thing that wins. Like what we've seen historically with crypto, is that a pluralism where different design choices, which fail in different ways at different times, actually create a broader generative lift than what we've seen both economically and socially. It's a crazy time. That's why I say it's a renaissance. It's like, literally, we're seeing communities using the same types of technology in the same ways, reinventing the fundamentals, we're not aware of it. Sure. It's super volatile.
00:45:14.164 - 00:45:21.744, Speaker B: It's not dying to slow death. It's chaotic and chaotic. Fine. It fits the pattern really, really closely.
00:45:21.844 - 00:45:45.936, Speaker A: Hmm. Judge, let me ask you something here, which is in the renaissance, people, it's not that people in the renaissance weren't religious. They were, they didn't. They didn't oppose God. They didn't oppose religion. They opposed the harsh rules of the church. And it kind of reminds me of, and I might be getting that wrong, but just to go with the question, like, it kind of reminds me of today, we don't necessarily oppose government.
00:45:45.936 - 00:46:09.896, Speaker A: We don't oppose finance. We oppose the harsh rules that the government can put in place. We oppose some of the harsh rules that some of the financial institutions put in place. Do you see parallels in that sense? And maybe the secondary question would just be like, is there anything we can do? If you're the government or your finance, like these financial institutions, can you stop it? Or is there anything that you could.
00:46:09.920 - 00:46:32.764, Speaker B: Do that's such a good take, man. That's a history major in action right there. That's exactly. That is not condescending at all. That is spot on. I'm always hesitant to go into this cause people get ruffled. But you have to distinguish the institution from the ideology, the content of belief, from the physical apparatus in time and space that controls you.
00:46:32.764 - 00:46:53.606, Speaker B: Those are different layers. One layer is, what do you believe? Should there be a church? Should there be a government? And then you can also distinguish the idea of government or a church or authority, for sure. You need authority. You can't have people drive on both sides of the road, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, for sure. But then you're saying, like, then the next layer is, are you actually opposing this instance of it?
00:46:53.630 - 00:46:53.790, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:53.822 - 00:47:49.744, Speaker B: And what in particular are you objecting to this instance of it in terms of institution? And, like, for a lot of people, that institution is just because it's calcified, because there's no other alternative. It's virtually impossible to, like, to change the nature of, like, two party system in the, like, it's super difficult because of, like, a variety of forces. And, like, it's not like there's a bad guy. I mean, it's not like you're telling a story and there's a villain, right? This is just a function of the historical time we're in. Cruft accumulates and calcifies over time, and then it gets so heavy and it crumbles under the nature of its own weight, right? Some of that's demographic you can talk about, workers to retirees, some of it. And that has, like, implications for education, for finance, for all these things, right? Like, if I'm a victim, if I'm in that specific situation, I'm a pension fund manager, I'm not getting my 7% unless I bet on something like this, right? So I get out of these things, I jam into VC, VC gets hyperinflated, I go into tech. Like, it's not that anyone's being bad.
00:47:49.744 - 00:48:33.390, Speaker B: I'm in a complex fallen system where, like, wheels, like, grind, basically. Like, the only person that took down the Holy Roman emperor was like just institutional cruft, right? Even Napoleon after that, it's like the bureaucrat, the guys at the desk, he could beat anyone except for, like that. Like, it's a function of that. And then eventually it crumbles. And so, like, you as a government have a choice, like, how do you want it to crumble or how do you want to remake it? You're going to have to remake yourself at some point by pleasantly or unpleasantly, like, do you want to control and participate in that system? Which is where it gets, like, really interesting and, yeah, from the church perspective, like, it wasn't. We say church, and everybody's like, we put on our modern filter, we say, oh, like, my church, what? I believe that's not what was going on. That was like, that was the largest landowner that claimed temporal authority.
00:48:33.390 - 00:48:58.734, Speaker B: They said they were the ones that controlled the sword in the armies, not the military, and they largely won that fight. The Holy roman emperor is like kneeling, begging, contrition, basically. They won that fight. And so what happened? This is crazy. And there's a crypto analogy in here. What happened with the Renaissance was, as they went back to the sources, they found that a lot of those sources, particularly the documents that had led to this accretion, this piling up, were false. They weren't legitimate.
00:48:58.734 - 00:49:24.466, Speaker B: These are even, like, roman catholic guys, like Erasmus is reading this donation of Constantine, right? It's this document where, like, the whole. Where the roman emperor Constantine says, hey, I give you the armies, pope, here you go. And they find out that the thing's a forgery, right? And so now they're like, oh, wait, my document is false. They're using, like, scientific technique. They're going back to the code and they're auditing the code of authority. Like, that's wrong. What else is wrong? And, like, we see a lot of stuff going on with that.
00:49:24.466 - 00:49:49.524, Speaker B: I think part of the I don't want to call it the problem of crypto, but it's a reason for the volatility, which is why it's a leading indicator of its power, is that we're actually seeing what's behind the scenes for the first time. We're seeing, oh, someone can front run a market. Oh, wait, so, yeah, somebody in crypto does that a little bit, and it's awful. It's like you're just seeing that for the first time that's been going on the whole time. Or somebody. Or you say, like, oh, this gives unfair advantage to whales. Yes, of course it does.
00:49:49.524 - 00:50:08.068, Speaker B: It's always been that way. Like, now you're seeing that. And so, like, now for the first time, when you take those blinders off, it's not pretty, but you start getting the ability to play with it, right. You can say, hey, maybe we do different types of voting, maybe do quadratic voting, or you do. You can play with these, like, fundamentals. So, like, the church wasn't just the church. It was their military and economy and university.
00:50:08.068 - 00:50:29.368, Speaker B: It was everything. It was their culture, if you want to use the word, the state. The state was subservient to the church. And like Luther unraveling that unraveled every single layer. So everything was up for grabs. It can get dicey wars of religion, craziness, or it can be kind of managed. And what tends to happen is you tend to have some hierarchy and you tend to have some decentralization.
00:50:29.368 - 00:51:02.072, Speaker B: In a complex system, it's not as if it's CFI or defi or KYc or Anon. You tend to have, like, in a healthy, complex system, it tends to be pluralistic. We kind of forgotten about that. Where you have different people making different design choices that aren't just accepted and okayed, but you hate those people over there where they actually reinforce and help generate in the system. So when DeFi goes this, Cefi does that, when Cefi does this, you get some balance out of it. Right now, things are still super correlated, but that's how a healthy system tends to unfold. What will be super interesting back to your fourth turn, is what happens on the political scene.
00:51:02.072 - 00:52:02.998, Speaker B: Now that you have x and Y and now that you have x and Y and you have a z axis on it, how do people realign for a while? I'd say just putting on the poli sci like history hat, we've kind of had a mismatch where fiscal social and fiscal conservative conservative, social conservative, fiscal, that boxes for parties tend not to work. So cleanly anymore. And now with somebody entering crypto, entering like, a z axis, saying, hey, what about self sovereignty? What if you can create your own world in your own way and start from the ground up? It's not just a threat to nation state in terms of fiat or currency. If you ask a political scientist, if you ask PhD and poli sci, they'll say, hey, a nation state is like an imagined community, their words, not mine, instantiated by currency and contract. And you look at crypto and you say, that's currency and contract, and imagine community is consensual identity. It might be a re emergence or an iteration of what a nation state actually is. It might look very different in the future to come.
00:52:03.096 - 00:52:03.650, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:52:03.762 - 00:52:07.498, Speaker B: A long answer, but you're asking these short questions, but they're like really big.
00:52:07.546 - 00:52:37.010, Speaker A: Questions, so I'll hit you with another one. So we're drawing all these big parallels between the Renaissance and web3. And I'm almost honestly one of the things I'm thinking about, Josh, is like, we're so zoomed into web3, but when I'm hearing you talk, I'm like, the Internet, web3. In the arc of history, it's all one thing. It's not like this decade was the Internet. This decade was crypto. Like, if I'm 200 years in the future, I'm just saying, like those, like 30 years was like this new thing, you know?
00:52:37.202 - 00:53:05.002, Speaker B: That's so good. Now, that's like, back to that, like, ocean analogy. You see when the currents change, right? You know those ripples, you forget about them. Oh, there's an Internet, you don't even remember AOL or Netscape or geocities right now, right? Like, those were dominant, Tam, and you've kind of forgotten about them. Like, in this big picture, when you look back, the further back you get, the more you only remember the more significant changes. Right? And everything else gets compressed. If I were to go esoteric on you in the renaissance, I'd say, well, there's early and late, and it was distinguished by.
00:53:05.002 - 00:53:22.002, Speaker B: And you'd be like, what are you talking about? I only want to know that this thing changed. And that's what we're going to see, the Internet. We're going to see, hey, we had the ability to do zeros and ones, to do digital communication at mass. Cool. We did that for 40 years, and then it got reaggregated. We're like, oh, that's not good. Why'd that happen? Because ownership was ripped out of communication.
00:53:22.002 - 00:53:58.926, Speaker B: Fine, then we're going to look back, and we're going to say, hey, crypto is you controlling and owning those zeros and ones and being able to instantiate what they mean about you, what they mean about value, what they mean about an idea as you so choose, and whether those zeros and ones reflect a monetary signifier, whether they reflect pixels for an idea, or whether they reflect a call to who you are as a wallet, you instantiate or retract, you're going to forget all that. So they're going to say, the Internet. They're not going to remember the Internet. They're only going to see crypto, and we won't talk about it that way. The same thing with they won't talk about web3. They'll be like, what are you guys talking about? And be like, that doesn't make any sense. They'll only see crypto.
00:53:58.926 - 00:54:25.336, Speaker B: And communication, of course, will be part of crypto. We just won't remember anything else, and we probably won't call it crypto. It's just like back in the day, there's an Internet fund and an Internet company, and it just becomes the fabric of reality. So we'll say, yeah, in this new world, where people actually control their own abilities to do these different things, this is how it works. Doesn't even make sense. You won't even know if it succeeds. You won't remember the nomenclature, which is one of the tricks of history.
00:54:25.336 - 00:54:41.110, Speaker B: The biggest changes tend to be forgotten. But, yeah, you're 1000% right. You zoom out and, like, this is the big thing. And just one other thing. Historically, there are all these little false forks before big transformations. You forget. I mean, like, you as the historian, I say, luther, you're like, yeah, but if I were to say Wycliffe and Huss, they did some of the same things.
00:54:41.110 - 00:55:00.734, Speaker B: You wouldn't really remember who those guys are, even though they did similar things, right? Like, they got burned. You don't. They were like losers. You don't remember about that, right, but they were doing similar things. Like, why did Luther succeed where those guys didn't? Well, because he had, like, a permissionless print protocol and ledger based accounting to help him, like, propagate it, right? So you have these little false forks that. They were big. They rocked the world.
00:55:00.734 - 00:55:17.834, Speaker B: We've just forgotten about them because they aren't big enough. And that's what's happening with a crypto renaissance. We get these tremors beforehand, and now we have the tech rails to work at scale bottom up. So it's very tight. We could go down to even almost the source code of it. It's super crazy how well the analogies hang up.
00:55:19.454 - 00:55:20.974, Speaker A: When was the fall of Rome?
00:55:21.134 - 00:55:40.714, Speaker B: Depends how you're looking at things. This sounds super postmodern, but it's true. It depends. You could say, hey, like, when the republic fell and it went imperial, lots of people would say, that's like the fall of Rome, the Roman Republic. It goes Caesar, right? Like, maybe it's that. Okay, maybe it's when there's no more caesars. But wait, that barbarian guy, he became Caesar, right? So now you have a barbarian caesar.
00:55:40.714 - 00:56:02.648, Speaker B: Is that real? And then, like, globally, even in the Mediterranean, you'd say the thing never fell. Like, I mean, basically there was always, like, an eastern half of it. And then we kind of talked about it this way. And so, like, it gets really, really tricky and it, like, forces you. That's why these threads are super important. Like I say, value, communication, identity. But what threads you pick what question you ask, what you mean by the question.
00:56:02.648 - 00:56:08.968, Speaker B: The details, like, determine your answer, which is crazy. So you can say, yeah, like, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
00:56:09.016 - 00:56:18.552, Speaker A: I was going to try to make a bad analogy between the fall of Rome and the fall of web two, but I'm going to pivot my question. Actually, I'm going to pivot my question and say, it's not a bad analogy. I'm going to completely pivot.
00:56:18.568 - 00:56:23.680, Speaker B: No, but it is. Did it die with Fang? Is it dying with web3? When does it die? It's a really good question.
00:56:23.792 - 00:57:16.076, Speaker A: So we're drawing these big analogies between the Renaissance and web3. I think one thing that feels different to me, though, is so in the Renaissance, you have this civilization where you have enough money that's left over to create these great works of art. And when you create great works of art, you create culture. And Italy, unlike a lot of other european countries at the time, their culture didn't really disintegrate, whereas a lot of other places in Europe had a, it feels like in America, culture is kind of disintegrating. So it feels like America might be opposite today. And then, b, you talked about these, like, the expansion of markets and, like, exploration and things like that. And, like, I just think of, you know, Columbus going to ask Queen Isabella to sail west to go try to find India, right? Because they figured out the world might not actually be flat.
00:57:16.076 - 00:57:40.356, Speaker A: And, like, Vasco de Garna in India in 1498. And, like, I just think of, like, this great period of exploration. When I think of America, I think of, like, we kind of stopped doing that 50 years ago. I think of, like, Panama Canal in the early 19 hundreds. I think of the Hoover dam in the 1930s. I think of the GI bill in the 1940s, the Marshall plan after World War two. I think of, like, creating the highway system in the fifties and sixties.
00:57:40.356 - 00:57:57.044, Speaker A: Sixties. And even DARPA in the fifties, which led to the Internet. Right? We don't do any. And obviously the biggest one, like the Apollo space program in the sixties, we don't do any of that anymore. And that feels like a big, big difference between now and the Renaissance.
00:57:57.204 - 00:58:33.630, Speaker B: Yeah, now there's so much, man, you ask these short questions, but there's like ten different ways to tackle this. It's like a really powerful question. We could do kind of the philosophical or down to the detail. Okay, so one way to think about it is like form versus function, right? And so, like, if you on what happened was at the Renaissance, it did when you teach this to undergrads. And, like, this is like, I don't even mean undergrads. When most people think about this, we always think about things in terms of being binary, right? It's like, there's high culture, there's low culture, there's wealthy. There's not wealthy.
00:58:33.630 - 00:58:49.390, Speaker B: That, like, helps us place things in our head. There are categories. It's like we're victorians. Like, in a room with a parlor and an eating room and a sitting room. And, like, that helps us think about it. But really, the Renaissance, like, really undid things at both levels. The highest culture and the lowest culture.
00:58:49.390 - 00:59:13.928, Speaker B: And, like, we tend to remember the high culture now today, partially because, like, the high culture, the university is, like, largely one. So that's why. And they're high culture by nature. So they're telling you about, like, Michelangelo and blah, blah, blah. So that's why it's helpful as, like, in the past 50 years, historians have started to say, hey, what do the people on the ground actually think about this sort of stuff? So on the high culture, it was radical. It was a transformation. Even in Italy previously, you have a religious scene.
00:59:13.928 - 00:59:32.952, Speaker B: You don't have a pagan scene. You don't have a scene out of your own mind and your own creation. That was craziness for them. That was flat out craziness to say, you don't need permission to paint this content, even at the height of this. So too, can you paint these other pieces. And, like, that was a process. So church gets feisty with Michelangelo, and then he weaves things in subtly and da da da da da.
00:59:32.952 - 01:00:04.358, Speaker B: But even in Italy, it would have been complete craziness. And that's one of the reasons why, to validate these changes, they used the form of what had been done before as much as they could. Even the emperor is the Holy roman emperor. So when you say, hey, when the roman empire fall, if you ask Charles, he's like, it doesn't fall. I'm sitting right here, or whatever, they retell the story as a piece of it. Even the images that we see that were like high culture, those are radical to them, like the oil paintings you're seeing or the Sistine chapel where they're using. That was like, you hadn't seen that before.
01:00:04.358 - 01:00:43.790, Speaker B: That was like Ar and VR. And even that painting was a technology which was rediscovered from, like, back to the sources, the Dutch, right? So that was going on. And that was fundamentally the people in power, the smart ones, who were writing the wave, grabbing on to, like, the new institutions as they were reforming them, changing, like, what it was and what it meant for them. And then at the same time, there was a bottom up, not just a high, but also a low. And that was what you would have seen. You would have seen these images and these, like, woodcuts and these copper etchings that aren't so realistic in perspective, but are much more, like, much more symbolically oriented. And those symbols weren't just like for the dum dums that couldn't read.
01:00:43.790 - 01:01:13.556, Speaker B: They were like. They were powerful. They caused something in you, like, emotively to say, hey, this is my try, this is who I'm with, this is what I value, et cetera, et cetera. And so that really, the italian city states are like, they're in the middle of nowhere, they're in swamps. They did well financially, and that's one end of the spectrum. They were able to reinvent themselves to renaissance themselves from that old world, to not only persist in power, they were early adopters, and they gained asymmetric advantage on that. They're fighting off France and what, they took over France subtly.
01:01:13.556 - 01:01:50.480, Speaker B: Right. They did a really good job at that. And so, yeah, for the US, part of that also was. So their disruption changed the way we would think about that. And that's kind of what we're heading into now with, like, we're on the demographic decline, basically, just in terms of numbers, along with most of Europe and the world or what have you. So our exploration, probably, it might not even be physical for them. A lot of their exploration was, like, synthetic, and I don't mean metaverse, but it was like these ideas and these books actually became more real, and it was those ideas in books that actually drove the change in the real world, whether it was age of discovery or exploration or what have you.
01:01:50.480 - 01:02:23.772, Speaker B: And so I think we're going to enter a period like that where, as our demographics invert, we're going to get more interested in the synthetic, and most people say metaverse. Metaverse replacing reality. I don't mean that. I mean the synthetic world. Call it a metaverse actually augmenting reality and driving a new age of discovery, not in the sense where I have to throw just human power at it, but where I'm able to pick and choose different places, as it has a generative function. If you were to zoom out into world history, you'd say, hey, the Ottomans did this. And that's what kept Charles from stamping down Luther.
01:02:23.772 - 01:03:05.494, Speaker B: One of the things I think we see in the renaissance is that enemy, my enemy is my friend thing was really different, right? Because now I might have people I'm traditionally aligned with, but as they choose to differ on this new forking of reality, we'll call it crypto, but call it pluralism or whatever, I might have new friends and allies that I had never imagined before. I think one of the reasons why we're in the middle ages, there wasn't a lot of that going on, right? And then the Renaissance allows this blossoming and, like, going forth. That's kind of the point we're at. We're only now just stepping into the renaissance. When you're right, when you look back and say, hey, we've kind of been, you know, haven't been doing this or that part of. It's like, when the whole thing gets retooled, you have to go through that process before you explode out.
01:03:05.534 - 01:03:22.008, Speaker A: I mean, maybe the funding. Maybe the funding comes from different places, right? Like, maybe. Maybe it's daos creating these great works of. Of public funding, right? Maybe the next space program doesn't come from the american government funding it. It comes from a Dao led by Elon Musk, you know? So.
01:03:22.096 - 01:04:13.678, Speaker B: No, no, those things are literally. I don't know if you were talking about the same ones I'm thinking of, but those things are going on as I speak, right? And so, like, those are. And not just funding. That's kind of what I mean, when crypto actually starts taking on more of the nature of the state. I mean, you know, exploration, space exploration, like education, economic development, even public goods, right? If you look at that, like, full disclosure, not financial advice, I'm super biased if you look at what helium did in San Jose, where they're like, hey, state city, you're not providing broadband access to your people. We're going to do it for you literally in that fifth bucket where crypto starts acting as a business model rather than a technology that allows you to turn cost centers into revenue generators, which means things that aren't financially feasible in the real world actually can work. And that also means that you can incentivize public goods and exploration, all the stuff that gets cut out of aggregation or only for their own ends.
01:04:13.678 - 01:04:19.430, Speaker B: Now, you can do it all along the long tail. So, no, I think that you're exactly right. We're just opening it up right now as we speak.
01:04:19.502 - 01:04:27.474, Speaker A: I've got my helium set up, my Nebra right here, so I don't want to move it because I've, like, positioned the little signal at the exact right thing.
01:04:27.974 - 01:04:40.990, Speaker B: That's exactly right. You're starting to see that on, like, the public goods. That's like a really good tangible. It's like, we're still super early. You're only seeing, like, crypto as a business model, like, unlocks right now. But I think you're going to see a lot of it over the next couple of years.
01:04:41.062 - 01:05:15.006, Speaker A: Well, it starts to get really fun when, you know, at a certain point in time during the renaissance, the institutions had to say, these technologies are just better. Right? The institutions had to say, maybe the Medicis are onto something here. And they had, like, they said, okay, our way of creating books and written word is, like, very archaic. Like, let's just do what this Gutenberg guy says to be done. And I think it starts to get really interesting when institutions, they never like new technologies, but eventually they're forced to participate. And that's what I'm excited for with crypto.
01:05:15.110 - 01:05:24.998, Speaker B: No, that's a thousand man. Me too. That's actually the heart of the historical. So right now, super volatile, everybody's losing it. That's fine. That's what happens. I see that as a leading indicator.
01:05:24.998 - 01:05:47.138, Speaker B: A slow death would be like, you don't know, when the roman empire fell apart. This is much more pains of rebirth and renaissance. And so what happens, at some point, the institutions adopt it. They just do. Technology is better. You can't keep doing manuscripts right, or you want, or financials or what have you. And so then it gets really interesting because your early adopters are usually zealots.
01:05:47.138 - 01:06:17.754, Speaker B: If you want to write crypto, twitter, super tribal, because you need those folks. You need the 15 year old boy who's yelling at people on Twitter. If you're going to be a zealot and you're going to do it when there's nothing there yet and you see the future, more power to you. The tribalism serves a really important historical function. But then as you start getting institutional adoption, it starts to cross right. So then it gets, like, really interesting when the institutions start doing it. Then if you do it well, you end up with pluralism, which means a lot of things for a lot of use cases, and they're generative.
01:06:17.754 - 01:06:44.830, Speaker B: A lot of the early adopters will say, no, we don't want this other thing. It doesn't have these values. I personally don't take that side of maximalism on anything. Even maximalism on crypto values, decentralization, it's great. If your thing is the best thing ever in the world, more power to you. But in a complex system, and this is like, my PhD was at, like, the institute for grant studies in Paris, like at the Sorbonne. Like, I promise you, complex systems work better when there's different points of failure.
01:06:44.830 - 01:07:13.800, Speaker B: So somebody may make a worse decision by your values and maybe even an objectively worse decision. In a complex system, it's stronger. And so, to your point, when you start layering institutions in there now, it gets interesting. If you. If you say, hey, I have the best chain or the best dao, that's the most crypto value, blah, blah, blah, do you want 100% of that, or do you want it in a mosaic or a patchwork of other stuff? I choose a pluralistic representation every single time. It's a different. This isn't like something I say a lot out in the crypto world because everybody goes batshit.
01:07:13.912 - 01:07:36.708, Speaker A: No, I mean, something that I just pieced together is like, crypto is. Everyone thinks of crypto as a technology. You could see crypto as not as a technology, but as a new way of organizing communities. And if you extrapolate that out to, you know, I asked this question about, like, or I said this thing about institutions. When do they get on board and stuff like that. It's like, okay, step one. Like, crypto is not a technology.
01:07:36.708 - 01:07:54.004, Speaker A: It's a new way of organizing communities. Communities are historically always the ones that create history. Institutions don't create history. Institutions participate in history. So crypto, new way of organizing communities. Communities create history. Institutions participate in history.
01:07:54.004 - 01:07:55.684, Speaker A: I don't know. Never thought about it like that.
01:07:55.804 - 01:08:39.144, Speaker B: No, it's a different way. And then you say, well, wait, what's the nature of that technology? Like, is it just better, faster, cheaper. That's why Internet, false fork, better, fast, cheaper. Find that just aggregates Tam and like, plays demonstrations. And you say it's decentralized, where you have, like, different communities organizing and decentralization allows plurality. It doesn't just allow one or two to win. It allows esoteric interests all along the long tail to be financially and socially viable, right? In a Tam world, I have to wipe out that long tail and crush it up to my tam to get a stock like value that's worthwhile, right? That's my business model is aggregating that long tail and crypto is an economic model or social coordination model that allows me to have all these little flowers growing along the long tail.
01:08:39.144 - 01:09:10.408, Speaker B: And like this little one that wouldn't have been economically viable. Now all of a sudden, it is economically viable. That's why I keep talking about this as a business model. Turning cost centers. Look, this building or a coffee shop down the street, if I want to listen to music on Spotify for you, it's $9 for them, I have to pay BMI 30k or 15k for somebody else. And then if I'm processing, I'm paying 5%, and then I'm paying for a lease. If I take every one of those things and I flip over the crypto model where I'm creating ownership, all of a sudden I'm packing up like I'm listening to Audius, I'm using Solana pay, I'm using helium.
01:09:10.408 - 01:09:44.316, Speaker B: Pick whatever you want, I don't care. All of a sudden, like, that coffee shop becomes viable, right? And I don't need, like, a coffee chain aggregating it. And so now all of a sudden, I have all these different things all along the long tail that I can participate in. And, like, these things might not have the same values. One might not be as decentralized as the other. And like, from a complex system, that makes a better failure point and just from worldview of what you want the world to look like, I want people to be able to express obviously false ideas in terms of design decisions it actually generates and makes it more valuable. With me, you're saying the institution's coming in for sure.
01:09:44.316 - 01:10:05.977, Speaker B: That creates that mosaic. Then what tends to happen, if you really believe in the technology and you don't have to pound people into it, is that those values tend to stick on, and slowly the institutions adopt, and then all of a sudden, their people become part of the communities. And now what's happening, it sort of changes. Like, that's the way that communities make history. It's a. It's very much a bottom up co opting, like, institutions. And this is super.
01:10:05.977 - 01:10:08.625, Speaker B: This is the most I've ever gone into historiography. This is crazy.
01:10:08.769 - 01:10:27.902, Speaker A: I have another one for you, which is just thinking about money. Money there. What the renaissance did is it made it so that the florin, what? Like, the florin was the currency of one city, was the currency of Florence. Right. But yet it succeeded where. What was the currency back then? Like the euro? Like, I don't. I don't.
01:10:27.958 - 01:10:28.457, Speaker B: Everybody has a different.
01:10:28.457 - 01:10:29.942, Speaker A: I guess everyone had a different one. Yeah.
01:10:29.958 - 01:10:30.814, Speaker B: It's craziness.
01:10:30.934 - 01:11:07.386, Speaker A: Maybe the analogy, like here. What's my question? I think the Renaissance made it so the Florin became this widely accepted currency, right? And now, in the maybe late 14 hundreds, you had this, like, global currency that was kind of this, like, global reserve currency, maybe for the first time ever. I don't know. I wonder if we see crypto, if we do the same thing with crypto, whether it's a USDC or it's some decentralized, stable coin that is so far from getting built because of all. We're just far away from building that. But I wonder if something like that happens and if we really do recreate.
01:11:07.410 - 01:11:27.736, Speaker B: Money, it's like to go really deep into. On the eve of the Renaissance, there wasn't enough coin for, what is it? One fifth, one 10th? What's needed there is a bottleneck in terms of the actual money production. They couldn't print like we could print. We knew how to print stuff. They couldn't do that so well. And then there are all sorts of issues. Are you taking it off the edges? What are you doing? Blah, blah, blah.
01:11:27.736 - 01:12:04.734, Speaker B: But, like, the point is, even in, like, an. Even if you had an aggregated economic world, they couldn't have generation, because there's a bottleneck on the production. Until you have that, on a ledger to say, hey, I give you credit for this and you have debit for that. If I have a credit and you have a debit, or if I have it both, that's two less, like, instances of coins I need. So, like, that literally allowed. That's the birth of proto capitalism or mercantilism, partially because the old financial rails in the medieval world weren't technologically proficient enough to allow commerce at scale. And so with Defi and crypto, we're doing the same thing.
01:12:04.734 - 01:12:23.878, Speaker B: We're having commerce at scale in different ways. Part of that is access. Part of that is synthetic versions. You want to do something on synthetic stocks, whether you're geofenced. And then to your point, there's different winners and losers out of there, but those winners look different. It might not be the same paper piece of money. It might actually be like something that's a digital implementation.
01:12:23.878 - 01:12:47.742, Speaker B: That's the backing on that. Whether that's a digital USD, it tends to look different than you would otherwise expect. But, yeah, it's an unfolding in a way that we haven't seen before. The first is the same thing, better, faster, cheaper, synthetic. The second is a new fundamental that we couldn't otherwise imagine. Maybe it's Alchemyx or something. No affiliation, but just like I give a loan to myself so I don't get liquidated.
01:12:47.742 - 01:13:13.464, Speaker B: Different weird stuff I couldn't have ever. Or a synthetic version of apple I can buy in China on a defi exchange or something. And then to your point, how do you want to play the early adopters? It's always innovators dilemma. You want to disintermediate yourself. No, nobody wants to do that. At some point, that tends not to work out so well. You have to participate in it, otherwise you lose too much ground.
01:13:13.464 - 01:13:40.860, Speaker B: But if you participate in it, you legitimize the other's action. So it'll be really interesting. The way I think it'll work out is not crypto versus non crypto, but whose crypto do you want? And I probably see that layered in terms of a pluralistic overlay where you have centralized currencies and then you have other back stable coins, then you have other things on top of that. At the other end, you have complete anon. I don't think people will participate in one level of the stack. I think they'll participate in different ways, just like we kind of do today.
01:13:41.012 - 01:14:02.344, Speaker A: You said something interesting about when we were talking about the Florin about. And, yeah, I completely agree. You'll participate across the identity stack. You might have, like, three different identities. But you said something interesting about the florin, which is that capitalism is basically created during the Renaissance, and capitalism was really created in Florence. You get the Florin and things like that. Yeah.
01:14:02.344 - 01:14:34.626, Speaker A: Like italian city states during the Renaissance were really thriving. Right. It creates this merchant class, aka the middle class. It kind of either creates, maybe recreates, let's say it creates the middle class. And what that did is then the merchant class, which was our middle class, created this demand for clerks who could read and write. That created this need for education, for mass reading and mass writing. Today we're really struggling in America with the middle class like the middle class is really dying out.
01:14:34.626 - 01:14:55.098, Speaker A: And I do wonder if crypto, like, if the Renaissance, a, created the middle class and then b, leveled up the middle class, like, taught them how to read or force the need to read and write. I do wonder if crypto is maybe like the savior of the middle class here and could really be something that levels up the middle class. But maybe now I'm drawing too many analogies between the Renaissance.
01:14:55.146 - 01:15:20.664, Speaker B: No, that's my take. I mean, that's my take. I step softer on the italian side because the North Renaissance. So, no, that's absolutely my take, is that as institutions fit, when I say institutions fail, I don't mean they go out of business. I mean they stop serving the role that they were designed to. Right? So if I say, hey, here's a college, it's going to cost you five, six figures, you have a 50% chance of graduating. And, like, and I'm not really going to hire you on it anyway, do you want to do it? Like, it stops serving that role, right.
01:15:20.664 - 01:15:44.272, Speaker B: And part of that is just demographic reduction and what have you. And so, like, so what happened was the italian city states are like the great exception because they were very decentralized. They were like a federal. They were like little independent nations we don't even talk about in Italy. They were like these little things. And so, yeah, you had some universities, but it was usually, it was very decentralized in terms of how they were doing it. And they were at this hub.
01:15:44.272 - 01:16:11.634, Speaker B: And so a lot of the stuff came out of there just because of the nature of how they were interacting. And when it gained scale, largely through print. So now I'm reading, like, how to do double entry bookkeeping. I'm like, oh, hey, that's great. And now I read that up in northern Europe. And when it hits northern Europe, like, yeah, a lot of historians will say, will say, and it's hotly debated, but I tend to put myself among them to say, like, yeah, the Renaissance created, like, capitalism. Sometimes they qualify it and they say proto capitalism because it's not fully fleshed out.
01:16:11.634 - 01:16:37.524, Speaker B: Or sometimes they call it mercantilism, which is like another way of saying capitalism, and for all intent purposes. But yeah, no, absolutely. And part of that was because they had the tools. When it hit northern Europe, it went at scale. Bam. And then part of it was also, and I can't emphasize this enough, but this idea that you could take independence, you could do back this ideological thing, right? Like, this is like Max Weber and like, spirit of protestant work ethic. Or whatever.
01:16:37.524 - 01:17:13.412, Speaker B: I'm not doing something holy by being outside the world and by milking a cow in, like, some monastery where there's like, 20 guys there or whatever, right? Like, I'm actually doing something by, like, working in a shop, in a center of commerce, doing that with my family and my friends. And that's not bad to do. I can do that to the glory of, like, I have this calling to do it. What do I like and what am I good at? I've been divinely put in that spot, so I'm going to work hard to do it. I can literally interact with this world. And not only is it not evil, it's actually great to be doing. So you have people with tools which are coming up out of the italian city states for sure, and they're hitting these centers en masse.
01:17:13.412 - 01:17:28.632, Speaker B: And these people are saying, whoa, I don't have to kind of apologetically do this behind the scenes. I can go all in and make this my identity. Like, I'm a merchant. And I'm not, like, taking shit from, like, you know, the prince down the street. I'm saying, I'm a merchant. I'm funding you, right? Like, that's crazy. Just to give you a sense of, like, the economic change.
01:17:28.632 - 01:17:47.080, Speaker B: Like, when one of the Holy roman emperors, like, right before Charles, like, he couldn't. He didn't have enough money to buy his wedding dress, right? He goes into a city, he goes into Nuremberg, and they're like, we're not going to give you credit. Like, I'm the Holy roman emperor. You're not giving me credit. I'm not going to give you credit. Like, I don't believe so. Like, that idea of, like, that unlock of credit, I can't emphasize enough how crazy that is when that hits.
01:17:47.080 - 01:18:17.792, Speaker B: No, absolutely. And one of the reasons if I'm aggregating stuff, one other question you could say is, hey, why didn't these big financial houses do all this stuff? Because it's not worth their time. It's not worth their tam. They're aggregating Tam. They're only doing big deals. I'm not going to do all this little stuff all over Europe, here, there in the middle of nowhere with the technology, literally allows me not to do two things. One, to make it economically viable, to do this small stuff you can think about as the unbanked today.
01:18:17.792 - 01:18:34.088, Speaker B: And also it means I can do that. Even being out in the middle of nowhere, I don't need this guy's permission at the head of the curve. I can do this. On my own. And so you have an explosion of all this stuff. And capitalism comes from that bottom up, basically. It's very difficult to dictate from top down.
01:18:34.088 - 01:18:59.670, Speaker B: And so now your take on that, I see that as absolutely correct. It wasn't just the italian city states as the model. What happened, it was always very small percentage middle class with them anyway. They were a player, don't get me wrong. But when it hit at scale through this new technology, that was the birth of the middle class, as we call it. And then the deconstructionalist historians get feisty and you go back and forth debates with them. But the point of the story is, that's the birth of the middle class and not an accident.
01:18:59.670 - 01:19:36.690, Speaker B: When you say, hey, I'm middle class, my beer costs me more, my gas costs me more. Not just inflation, but education costs me more. I have this predefined track, and now what am I going to do? Like, the problem that, I mean, the bitcoin guys will say, like, back in the seventies, like Eric Weinstein, they say, I have this problem, right? Like, I can't continue this hyper growth if I have five partners at a firm and a law firm. And then more people come on, I can't keep replicating partners, right? So there has to be a contraction. Like, there's, like, strong reasons why that tends not to scale in terms of an aggregating tam. It can only get so big until I over leverage, because there's nothing else on, because I'm running a pension fund. Hence, like, Nasdaq right now versus crypto.
01:19:36.690 - 01:19:49.404, Speaker B: Like, it is crazy, but it's a different kind of crazy. It says there's an economic model where I can take from here and do here, which is like, if I'm middle class or anything, but, like, ultra wealthy. Like, that's what I'm betting on.
01:19:49.524 - 01:20:14.944, Speaker A: This might be my last question here. I don't want to extend the analogies too far, but the last thing to think about is, like, tying it back to the very beginning of this conversation. Farmers and farmers and farmers and farmers. And then. So you basically. Okay, so Martin Luther is like early 15 hundreds, publishes the 95 thieves, right? Like, the power of indulgences. And that started the reformation, right? And the reformation starts to dissolve the monasteries.
01:20:14.944 - 01:20:28.988, Speaker A: Or maybe it, like, hurts them or something. It hurts their business or something like that. And so maybe when businesses get hurt and the monasteries get hurt, I'm assuming, like, ten or 20 or 30% of the people working at the monasteries, they go into the workforce, they leave the monasteries, huge.
01:20:29.076 - 01:20:29.868, Speaker B: And that's good.
01:20:29.996 - 01:20:59.828, Speaker A: I just wonder if, like, if that's, like, people working for daos today. It's like, today, like, what do you do if you go to a good college? Like, you go work in consulting or, like, you're a lawyer or you're a banker, or, like, you just do you follow the path, and that was the path you, like, when you were either a farmer or you went and worked at a monastery, and then the reformation comes around, and Martin Luther, and he's got his memes, and then you could go do what you wanted. And today we have crypto, and you can go work in a Dao, and you can work in multiple daos. And I just. I don't know. Maybe I'm drawing too many analogies.
01:20:59.876 - 01:21:35.098, Speaker B: No, that's, like, I think that is, like, historically spot on. If it overstates the case, it only you need to overstate the case, because it's difficult for modern you and me to understand the nature of that transformation that is at 1000%. I mean, it's funny, I don't know if you remember that from your history, but, yeah, it's a dissolution of the monastery, right? So if I'm a medieval lord and I give away 10% of my estate every generation, I do that for ten generations. Guess what? All that's super concentrated, right? And, like, what I do with this church, I give it to a monastery. And so I have guys running around. They're doing stuff, and so dissolution of the monasteries, all that land goes back up for grabs, number one. And then that workforce, they're all these people.
01:21:35.098 - 01:22:06.560, Speaker B: So Luther, like, Luther's a monk, and he gets married. He defies his vow because he says that vow is illegitimate. And who's he marry? Mary's a nun, basically, right? And he says, like, there's nothing. Like, there's nothing less holy. Like, milking or sweeping up is, like, what you're doing off there. In fact, he says, I'm actually being more holy here because I'm helping people instead of being off in the middle of nowhere. And so, like, this workforce explodes, and, like, this idea of, like, merit, like, it explodes the population, and, like, this other idea that I want to do it for myself, capitalism, blah, blah, blah.
01:22:06.560 - 01:22:28.168, Speaker B: But there's always baked in this, doing this for your neighbor, this idea of, like, capitalism, too. I'm doing this so, like, I can help my community. I can help my neighborhood. I can help my neighbor. Who needs that? And so, like, that's like, a really interesting, like, point that, like, with this asymmetric opportunity also comes, like, asymmetric obligation. There's a lot of people down the distribution curve that, like, would like to help their neighbor but don't have the means to do so. And, like, now you can.
01:22:28.168 - 01:22:59.324, Speaker B: Right? Like, now you can work in these different daos and do these different things. If I'm outside my traditional path, which might not be working for me in the future, I can do these other things. And, in fact, like, here's the real mind mender. Maybe I can make helping people as financially viable or more so than just, like, working for myself. And so the idea of public goods and 501 c three as just something I do over there, because I've already done my real stuff over here changes, just like with Luther doing my real stuff here and then helping out over here, like, maybe these two things get interwoven. And I think we're starting to see, like, pieces of that. So, no, I don't think you're far off.
01:22:59.324 - 01:23:06.504, Speaker B: I think you're not even going far enough as I describe it. Yeah, we've lost, like, 99% of the people here. But this is so good.
01:23:06.544 - 01:23:08.804, Speaker A: Surprise if anyone's listening to this at this point.
01:23:09.784 - 01:23:10.480, Speaker B: This is great.
01:23:10.552 - 01:23:30.792, Speaker A: Nobody's listening at this point, but, Josh, this has been truly such. I just. I went full history nerd on you. And just, like, it's really rare, I find the. Someone who has as much is as interested in cryptos me, and as is way more interested in history, probably. I mean, freaking PhD. That's like.
01:23:30.792 - 01:23:38.976, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's just this has been such an interesting conversation and a fascinating conversation. I'm sure people dropped off, like, 30 minutes ago, but that's okay.
01:23:39.160 - 01:24:18.144, Speaker B: No, it's fine. Like, the thing is, if anyone's listening, like, I'd say, like, I mean, honestly, I'm not into crypto for crypto sake. I'm into it because I think it literally is all the tools. It may amount to nothing, but it's the very best chance we get for a fundamental change and a fundamental redistribution of the way we work, the way we create value, the way we communicate, the way we represent who we are, and our own beliefs, too. Philosophical, religious, ontological, epistemological. It gives us this opportunity to do anything. The thing I'd like people to take away is that when you're in the middle of a transition, you never recognize as a transition, and it always looks chaotic, and that's exactly where we are right now.
01:24:18.144 - 01:24:31.012, Speaker B: I'll just say you never get these opportunities to witness transformation, much less to do so knowingly or even to participate in it. So take advantage of the moment for yourself and for others. So thank you very much.
01:24:31.068 - 01:24:41.906, Speaker A: I think that's such a special way to end. Josh, this has been an amazing conversation. We will link to your twitter in the show notes. It's at Joshua Rosenthal. And as always, be well, my friend.
01:24:42.010 - 01:24:43.114, Speaker B: Thanks so much. Really appreciate it.
