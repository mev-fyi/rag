Joining this roundup, we have David and Ren from the blockworks research team. So, Santi, how you doing? Wren, David, how you guys doing?
00:00:27.384 - 00:00:29.616, Speaker B: Hey, Anna, doing good, how are you?
00:00:29.800 - 00:00:31.924, Speaker C: We're good. We're as good as we can be in this market.
00:00:32.264 - 00:00:32.792, Speaker D: Good.
00:00:32.888 - 00:00:34.240, Speaker A: Santi, how you living?
00:00:34.392 - 00:00:56.136, Speaker D: Feeling good. You know, I'm still processing the regulatory pod that we did, and there's a lot of thoughts we came out of that. So that's going to drop probably later this week. So, yeah, it's always really good and encouraging to talk to real experts because there's a lot of fod these days on crypto, Twitter. It's also, maybe it's a Twitter feed, but my Twitter feeds has just gotten really bad as of late.
00:00:56.320 - 00:00:59.688, Speaker A: You know, the 40 dark out there. So I was dark.
00:00:59.816 - 00:01:26.044, Speaker D: And the algorithm is like, God, like, someone has, like, whoever's punting AI, like, my God, go look at the for you tab and really seriously think of this. This is the future of AI. We're doomed, folks. Someone was thinking about writing a script so that we totally, like, don't see the for you tab and just go to, like, the follower tab. So, anyways, if someone out there has figured this out, please, I'm in a dire, desperate state at the moment.
00:01:27.244 - 00:01:28.092, Speaker A: I'm with you.
00:01:28.188 - 00:01:30.664, Speaker D: Anyways, I'm feel other the wise feeling great, you know.
00:01:31.164 - 00:02:05.780, Speaker A: By the way, we got a, we got a lot of messages after last week's roundup, which, which was like, very, seemed like kind of a bearish roundup. We're talking about finance, Coinbase, and I will say, I don't know, I'm feeling uber bullish this week about things. It feels like we just hit that part of the market where, like, anyone who is not completely locked in on crypto is gone at this point. There's no one remaining who's, like, not very, very, very locked in. And what that does, actually, to the market and to startups is focus is at an all time high. So, like, the way I'm feeling right now, prices at an all time low, focus at an all time high, and.
00:02:05.892 - 00:02:13.384, Speaker D: Cool, like, prices are not at an all time low, sir. I'm just, I just need to clarify this, because sentiment, when ETH hit like.
00:02:13.804 - 00:02:17.092, Speaker A: 100%, let's just like, reframe the.
00:02:17.148 - 00:02:48.174, Speaker D: Like, it's important to say this because when ETH hit a thousand, it felt like the sentiment was much more positive than what it is now. And I'll tell you why. Because the market is rallying, the broader market is up. And nothing hurts more than seeing this uncorrelation where everything is ripping in tech land. The market's back up. Fed is supposed to come out in a few hours, presumably going to pause the rate hike. But still, ETH is at holding at 1750 and bitcoin at 25 and change.
00:02:48.174 - 00:03:18.948, Speaker D: That's like up 50, 65% from the lows, folks. I mean, let's just like zoom out for a minute because it's important to contextualize that, like, ETH can quickly go back to a thousand and, you know, bitcoin could be back at sub 20 easily. Like, this is the nature of the space. And so take your wins, like, when you can get them, you know? And I suspect there's also a salty crowd with it that was sitting in cash. And nothing hurts more than seeing something rally and you're sitting trapped in cash and then you play.
00:03:19.126 - 00:03:32.000, Speaker A: So it's the worst feeling. And the Wall Street Journal published this like four days ago. S and P starts a new bull market as big tech lift stocks. So we're back. We're back. And I mean, we'll see before I.
00:03:32.032 - 00:04:07.528, Speaker D: I mean, I'm not a trader, I don't ramble about these things, but someone made interesting observer. I think it was a solid said back when the s, P is back to its pre COVID levels in the Nasdaq at that time, ETH was at 3000 and ETH is not at 3000, folks. So that, that's why people are hurting. And that's what, you know, there's a bunch of traders still that are looming around and it's like people want the market to do something. And when stuff's not doing something. I've seen a lot of the commentators in crypto Twitter just migrate over and say, you know what, this, this market's too crabby. I'm gonna go back to my roots and trade because you see much more activity in Techland.
00:04:07.528 - 00:04:11.102, Speaker D: And so anyways, yeah, moving on.
00:04:11.248 - 00:04:25.290, Speaker A: Yeah. S and P is up 30% since pre COVID. Ren David, let's talk uni. So, Santi, you are, you are biased here. So I think we'll acknowledge the bias because you were angel in uni. I think one of the early.
00:04:25.442 - 00:04:27.370, Speaker D: Yeah, paraphy, we participate in the round. Yeah.
00:04:27.482 - 00:04:28.258, Speaker A: Okay.
00:04:28.426 - 00:04:32.614, Speaker D: Not seed, but like because it was paradigm that did the seed. We did.
00:04:33.874 - 00:04:52.470, Speaker A: Do you remember the first time you met Hayden? Because my understanding of the story of Uniswap is so Vitalik put out almost this call to action saying, hey, someone needs to build this thing. I've got this idea for how it can be built. And Hayden was a developer and built this. Do you remember kind of like the early story there at all?
00:04:52.662 - 00:05:14.838, Speaker D: I do. Hayden was not technical, actually. And so he took Vitalik's post and then built on it this amm idea. And it was pretty fascinating, sort of. Hear that? I think it conceptualized really some of the best parts of this ecosystem, which is, you know, anyone can join, get trained. There's a lot of resources because it's open source and people are willing to help you. Like, if you join these communities.
00:05:14.838 - 00:05:23.502, Speaker D: Like, everyone has a personal story where we're very lucky and grateful I am that along the way so many people help me and so I pass it forward.
00:05:23.598 - 00:05:23.974, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:24.054 - 00:05:58.214, Speaker D: And when someone wants to join the space, you know, I take time and I always, you know, part of Empire is doing that, right at scale. And so Hayden, like, learned solidity, built uniswap. He was showing up to, like, meetups and whatnot, I think, in New York and, and then just built it. And this sort of really quiet time in the market where you didn't have much volume and default wasn't even a term, but Jesse built it. And then he certainly got a lot of help from paradigm, like Dan Robinson there, and you helped him. You know, I think architect v two and then v three and then v four. So you certainly got a lot of help from, from paradigm.
00:05:58.214 - 00:06:37.746, Speaker D: But, yeah, I think it's one of the best stories in crypto that really shatters a lot of notions that it's really hard to enter the space. You need to be super technical. And lo and behold, I mean, Uniswap is the most widely used protocol, I think, in crypto terms and volume. And, yeah, it's a great success story in my mind. And also particularly because the last thing I want to say is, I remember looking at the round and there was a cohort of investors that said, amms are never going to work. They are fundamentally not as efficient as order book models. No one in their right mind that is sophisticated is going to want to do this.
00:06:37.746 - 00:07:20.342, Speaker D: The market is really handicapped. It's small, it's never going to get traction. And now you're in a state of the world where Uniswap, there have been days where the volume is higher than centralized exchanges, mind you. It has a fraction of the workforce. It is highly scalable. And I think what people realize is sometimes when you come from a financial background, yeah. Like, order book models will always be more efficient, but you sort of, like, fail to appreciate that there are other things that, like, people might provide liquidity and be willing to accept the trade offs of providing liquidity because they might be indifferent between USDC and ETH or whatever the two pair assets they're supplying.
00:07:20.342 - 00:07:56.364, Speaker D: It also is a good mechanism to, like, cost average in or out of a position. And so these are kind of the things that a lot of investors, like at the time, were looking at. Amms, were highly critical of an amm or even defi in general. And it's an important reminder when you're comparing, like, yeah, a lot of the things that you're building in DeFi are look and feel very similar to what exists in traditional finance. But there are new primitives that kind of expand consumer preference that you need to bear in mind. That kind of opens the. The window here for some, like, uniswap to get scale right and build a very successful kind of enterprise.
00:07:56.364 - 00:07:57.876, Speaker D: So, anyways, I'll stop rambling.
00:07:57.980 - 00:08:09.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I'm going to put this link in the show notes. It's the uniswap. Uniswap history. And it's one of my favorite pieces that exists in crypto because it's just the story of Hayden getting laid off. He got his first job out of college. He's working at Siemens.
00:08:09.980 - 00:08:17.116, Speaker A: He gets laid off. He messages his friend Carl, who's working at the Ethereum foundation. Carl's like, you got to learn how to code a little bit.
00:08:17.260 - 00:08:19.180, Speaker D: Same Carl that is now at optimism.
00:08:19.332 - 00:08:55.772, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Exactly. Exactly. So, all right, let's get into the big news of the week, which was Uniswap announced v four. And maybe, Ren, if I could pick on you for this, I actually want to start with v two and v three for a quick second to determine the problem that v four was trying to solve here. So my left bell curve understanding of this is that uniswap made it so that anyone could be an LP, right? Anybody could, like, open any sort of liquidity pool for any token. Then v two was like, okay, maybe these pools are, like, more optimized for, like, funds to be an LP.
00:08:55.772 - 00:09:20.844, Speaker A: And then V three made some updates, and it basically was almost impossible to make money as an LP and V four. There was a lot of problems that they were trying to solve. Internalization or, like, leaky Mev leaking value through MEV. The fact that like had become very tough for LP's to actually make money in v three. But maybe, Ren, you can walk us through and kind of contextualize and set us up for this conversation around before.
00:09:21.384 - 00:10:06.428, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So V one and V two of uniswap started off as super bare bones amm model where anyone can create a liquidity proof for liquidity providers to come in and provide full range liquidity. And so that basically means it supports any price from zero to infinity. Obviously, most assets don't trade at the price zero and infinity simultaneously. Especially for example, for pegged assets such as a stable coin. More often than not it trades between say ninety nine cents and one dollar and one cent. And so in order to increase sort of like that customizability and improve the liquidity efficiency, so to say, unisol came out with V three, their big innovation there was concentrated liquidity.
00:10:06.428 - 00:10:39.752, Speaker B: Right now, rather than your liquidity being provided in the full range of zero to infinity, you could choose a specific more narrow range. And that liquidity is kind of amplified. It moves the entire reserve curve outwards and provides more liquidity for sops that are being done in that range. That does a few things. A, it provides a much better execution for traders. But at the same time, it also vastly increased the amount of impermanent loss that liquidity providers experience. Nowadays, impermanent loss is termed as loss versus rebalancing.
00:10:39.752 - 00:11:36.994, Speaker B: And I think as the Univ three operation continued, a lot of people became more aware of sort of mev leakage from liquidity providers. So there were a lot of mev bots or arbitrages doing top of block sex to Dex arbitrages, or just for example, back running transactions. And the thing is, neither the people making the swaps, all the liquidity providers were basically making any profit or capturing any value from all of these arbitrages. So I think a big portion of V four is sort of tackling that, right, how to increase profitability back to liquidity providers. And furthermore, basically providing more customizability for these liquidity pools so that protocols can sort of own the liquidity. We had this big notion of protocol owned liquidity when Olympus down came out during the peak of the boom market. And I think uni V four is kind of a return to that, right? Or going back to sort of that customizability.
00:11:36.994 - 00:12:13.506, Speaker B: You start off with the bare bones, everyone got the building blocks. The way I see it is that univ two basically provided two things, x and y. Commonly known within the XyK sort of invariant. After that, uniswap, v three gave one more additional layer, xy and price granularity. And v four adds another dimension on top of that, x y price granularity. And now you get time granularity or free granularity. And it's sort of these building blocks that Uniswap has been providing that basically enables all of this.
00:12:13.506 - 00:12:19.706, Speaker B: And I think David would give a great rundown of what the specific features are of Uniswap that have enabled this.

00:13:06.356 - 00:13:09.704, Speaker A: Today, it's veloraapp.com empire.
00:13:14.044 - 00:14:04.520, Speaker C: I think Ren did a really great job explaining exactly what V four is really to think about. It is it's essentially v three, which is this contrary liquidity model that they created, which kind of like mimics like an order book. So it is an amm by the end of the day, it really is really just an order book. Because if you look at it today, the people that are really predominantly providing liquidity on unity v three that are at least doing well and making money, are our professional capital allocators just because of how complex it is. One thing that v four does is it takes v three. Whereas every single liquidity pool in v three needed its own smart contract, v four houses all liquidity pools in a single contract, something that they're calling the singleton. And my understanding is the way balancer works today is every single liquidity pool in balancer is housed inside one contract.
00:14:04.520 - 00:14:51.634, Speaker C: And this does a couple things. What this allows is if you're trying to do like multi hop pools, where I'm trying to transact from Ethereum to, let's say, arb token, and let's say there's no ETH arb pool, what happens today is uniswap tries to find the perfect route optimization to go from ETH to USDC. And then if there's a USDC aRb pool, it goes from ETH, USDC, USDC ARB to get you that token. Because all of these pools are housed in one transaction. This actually drastically reduces the amount of gas costs, because every single time you hop between a new pool, it requires additional computation and additional gas. So what Uni V four does is tries to optimize gas expenditure on behalf of the user. It vastly improves multi hop swaps from a gas perspective.
00:14:51.634 - 00:15:41.440, Speaker C: It also decreases the cost to create a new liquidity pool by like, I think I saw it 99%. It also does something that is, or it leverages something that is currently not integrated in the Ethereum protocol, which is called EIP 1153, which is supposed to be in Cancun's upgrade sometime this fall. And with that is like flash accounting. The way I think about it is like flash memory for your computer. It pretty much is something where it does calculations in transaction that essentially does not need to be saved to the state of ethereum after the transactions are done. And really what that does just again optimizes gas utilization to perform like very complex calculations without actually having to incur that cost on behalf of the user. So there's a lot of gas optimizations.
00:15:41.440 - 00:16:45.544, Speaker C: I think that V four focuses on that V three lacked, especially with its additional complexity. And really, I think the main thing to take away from V four's announcement is this idea of hooks. Pretty much what that is, is it allows customization at the pool level and really just gives complete customization, like Ren was saying, especially with protocol and liquidity, it gives complete customization into the hands of the pool owner to do literally whatever they want. One of the interesting things is around mev internalization. So I know we've seen app chains like Osmosis and the cosmos ecosystem try to leverage its app chain architecture to actually be state aware. So it is aware of in block like what the ordering of transactions are. And then based on the ordering of transactions, it's able to actually calculate how much MEV opportunity is there and then capture that MeV opportunity for itself, like arbitrage or back run its users, not front run its users, back run its users, and then provide that protocol revenue back to its OsMo token holders.
00:16:45.544 - 00:17:35.940, Speaker C: What hooks are able to do is actually somewhat internalize MEV and allows some type of transaction ordering preference. I think one of the shortcomings is because the hooks are smart contracts and are not baked into the protocol layer. Osmosis is an app chain, so its MEV preferences are baked into the chain. Because Uniswap is sitting above Ethereum and doesnt actually own the block space. There are some limitations about what MEV ordering and preferences that Uniswap can have. Its not fully understood, honestly what those limitations are yet. I was speaking to some people in the SCIP team, which is one of the leading MEV researchers in cosmos and a couple other MEV researchers, and the understanding today is that uniswap can be like, can be begin block aware, but not end of block aware.
00:17:35.940 - 00:18:11.592, Speaker C: So what that means is that it can know like the first, it'll be able to timestamp like the first X transactions in a block, but it doesn't know like the last transaction in a block when that last transaction is. And because of that, it can't actually optimize MEV revenue if you don't know exactly what's in a block, like the full contents. So I mean, I said a lot right there, but I think there's a lot of improvements at V four made over V three. It allows a lot more customizability on behalf of like the liquidity pool owners. But I think with that additional customizability comes a lot of complexity that we don't really know, like what the long term effects of that are.
00:18:11.768 - 00:18:56.724, Speaker D: I remember looking at V three and I said, it's incredible. You can limit kind of where you want to participate in the curve. But then I funded like two startups that like mellow and another that would allow like for this essentially for liquidity providers. Most liquidity providers are not active and don't have the complexity and don't want to do it. And so there are services that my bet at the time was that there would be, these services would be built on top of uni. It feels like there's now an expanded possibilities with v four to do all kinds of different strategies like t whopping and a bunch of other things. I am curious what you think would be the, what are kind of the, for people that are using uniswap, right? Like concretely, like where do you see the killer use cases that are going to get the most amount of traction with this greater flexibility and customization?
00:19:01.024 - 00:19:45.744, Speaker C: I think. I mean, there's a couple of things. I think in general, this just kind of gives the tool we believe in, obviously open source innovation that like will lead to like ideally the most capital efficient financial systems over time. And really what this does just put tools in the hands of the developers and the pool owners or liquidity owners to decide, like, how do you want to leverage your liquidity provision? I don't know exactly where this is going to lead to. I think one interesting thing is that this could actually have some detriment effects where you might end up actually having segmentation of liquidity. So you might actually end up seeing KYC pools versus not permissionless pools. And hooks are going to be related to that if you're not a KYC participant on chain, that you can't have access to this specific liquidity.
00:19:45.744 - 00:20:31.524, Speaker C: And especially today, when a majority of liquidity providers that are profitable on Uniswap are like, I think I saw something like less than ten lp's on uniswap make up like 80% of liquidity. And I think one issue of that is like, a lot of permission liquidity could be like, or I'm sorry, a lot of liquidity on Uniswap can be in these permission pools. And you might actually see this, this fragmentation of liquidity. But I think, like, those are major innovations. And one other thing that I thought was really interesting is that Ren talked about out of range liquidity, specifically with concentrated liquidity. Today, there's a lot of liquidity that sits in Uniswap that is stale and not being used, and it's just idle capital. One interesting thing that my understanding is hooks can do is actually leverage that out of range liquidity to be used in lending markets.
00:20:31.524 - 00:20:41.652, Speaker C: So what Uniswap V 4 may do is not only just become make uniswap a platform for exchanges, it could actually make Uniswap like a Defi super app, whereas you might take all this greater utilize.
00:20:41.748 - 00:20:57.954, Speaker D: But I thought that was possible, V three, where you could take that idle liquidity and use it in other places. And if you get called, if it hits the range, then it, you know, it gets ported back. But maybe that was a misunderstanding, but I thought V three allowed some of that. But maybe there's greater flexibility here.
00:20:58.614 - 00:21:30.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's really what it is, because, like, I think infinity pools, like a lot of other teams that are building on top of, we're building on top of unity V three. I think it planned on using some of this out of range liquidity to create new financial primitives. And my understanding is that unity V four just puts, I think, more tools in their hands to build, like, additional primitives and make it maybe simplify, like, how they actually build those primitives on top. So it really could make Uniswap this not just a Dex, but like this entire super app of applications built on top of the liquidity layer that it houses.
00:21:31.154 - 00:22:11.810, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to add on to what David said, there are like, a decent number of protocols these days are building on top of univg. For example, panoptic gamma swap, infinity pools. I think previously what you would have had to do was provide liquidity into Uniswap, take that NFT, and then basically pass it along to the protocol and perhaps deposit that into one of their contracts, or for example, deposit your liquidity through their contract. But what uni V four does is allow you to sort of like, abstract and simplify that process. Right now, rather than doing all of those complex actions, you can just deposit into a liquidity pool that was, for example, designed by one of these protocols building on top of Uniswap. And that's it.
00:22:11.810 - 00:22:21.406, Speaker B: All of the other sort of logical execution is handled by the hook that the spark, that sort of like points to the smart contract that handles everything else for you.
00:22:21.550 - 00:22:24.094, Speaker A: It feels like. Go ahead, Santa.
00:22:24.174 - 00:22:53.504, Speaker D: I was just curious, like, with greater customization flexibility, you could argue, does this increase the surface area of potential things that could backfire? Like, if you build a faulty hook, what's the worst that can happen? I'm curious, like, yeah, people can build on top of this, but, like, who's vetting? And can you create like these if a hook were to fail? Or just backfire? Like, what does that actually like? What kind of risk does that introduce to the broader kind of ecosystem of liquidity pools within uniswap?
00:22:54.404 - 00:23:30.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there are a few immediate risks that come to mind. The first of all is like a rugging risk. I'm not sure if this is possible, but, for example, you could deploy liquidity pool with, like a hook that points to a certain smart contract. And then after a while, you ask you to point to another smart contract, and that smart contract has a withdrawal fee that's, for example, 100% rather than 0%. And suddenly everyone wants to withdraw. The liquidity gets value. I think another sort of attack vector is you're asking a protocol to develop a lot of custom root sets and sort of logic within that smart contract for the hook.
00:23:30.480 - 00:24:04.210, Speaker B: And for example, if you're asking some random protocol to build their own hook contract for internalization of MV, for example, they want to run an MEV auction for the first transaction within their pool. I feel like not a lot of teams have expertise on that. And perhaps there's going to be a new type of business that provides a service sort of like hook templates. Out there for these people to build on. I think those are a few risks that come to mind. But yeah, at the end of the day it is an additional sort of attack vector and additional layer of complexity.
00:24:04.362 - 00:24:31.106, Speaker A: Yeah. Ren, is it fair to say that Uni V one, V two and v three was really all about like just liquidity and trading? And now this is what we are seeing here is Uniswap making a push into developer tooling. And because like the way that you guys are describing this is, it's not just, I mean, funds building on top of Uniswap now and like playing around with it, but really this is going to be a developer platform. It's, it's infrastructure for other people trying to build, trading infrastructure. Infrastructure.
00:24:31.290 - 00:25:23.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with that take. I think one of sort of like the common takeaways from the web two world was that everything either becomes a platform or it became a marketplace in the end. And I think we're kind of seeing that similar trend as defi slowly matures. Uniswap V for is now acting as a platform in the past rather than, sorry, currently, rather than sort of like building your own Dex, building all of that smart contract architecture, you basically just plug and play a super easy hook contract to point towards. And I think that's something that will or perhaps would change like a lot of vc investment thesis right now, rather than building your own like super cool amm, you're going to build your own like custom volatility fees or sort of like custom order models. Uniswap provides all of that tooling. You can build dynamic fees if you want, based on volatility.
00:25:23.186 - 00:25:50.604, Speaker B: You can build internal volatility oracles, you can build like an internalize mev amm, you can build your own custom orders with these hooks. And like David mentioned, you can provide out of range liquidity to lending protocols. And there's not much reason to go build your own Dex and sort of have to regain all of the liquidity that Uniswap already has. And these days I think developers would much prefer to just go build on the set of tuning provided by Unisoft.
00:25:52.224 - 00:26:11.008, Speaker A: Does this kill the idea that anyone can be an LP in Uniswap though? Like, it feels like these hooks are a really interesting idea and they're very innovative. But now, um, like liquidity provisioning is just, it seems like incredibly tough. It's just not tough, but complicated. Right. And so it seems like professional liquidity provision.
00:26:11.056 - 00:26:22.534, Speaker D: Sir, this is a left list of left curve take, which is you think that v two was the best version of Uniswap. Cause I've seen that meme. Like, guys, like Univ. Two was the best. Which is a fair statement, I guess.
00:26:22.834 - 00:26:45.134, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it's the best for what, what are you trying to optimize for here? Right. And I think Uniswap is, is opt, uniswap. The first Uniswap was optimizing for like, this open platform that anyone could provide liquidity. Individuals loved it. Retail loved it. This is moving uniswap into a open platform that developers can build on top of. But on the liquidity provisioning side, like, you need to be a professional.
00:26:45.134 - 00:26:50.410, Speaker A: You need to be a professional fund to get involved here. That is, that is my understanding. I'm curious if you guys.
00:26:50.602 - 00:27:18.700, Speaker D: I mean, like, that's the, it's a great point because the, the, when I talk to traditional people in finance, like I was a, uniswap allows anyone to be a market maker. But the question is, like, should anyone, should everyone be a market maker? Like, I would say, most people would say uni v two is great. Like, you know, super simple. It still is my understanding. It's still easy to deploy and provide liquidity. It will actually be easier in v four, primarily because you. The gas fees are much lower.
00:27:18.700 - 00:27:34.344, Speaker D: And so that from a, from a user standpoint, I think most people would look back and say, oh, it's just way cheaper to provide liquidity. And so it opens up the possibility if you want to provide less than $100 of liquidity, you can do that. The question becomes much more nuanced. Sorry, what was that?
00:27:34.684 - 00:27:35.700, Speaker C: No, go for it.
00:27:35.812 - 00:28:07.034, Speaker D: Yeah. The last one I want to say is, I want to hear your thoughts, David and Ren is, I think most people like, impermanent loss is an opportunity cost, and it is harder to conceptualize and track for most people. And it has been the case since day one for amms. And I don't think any of this changes, to be fair, but that's more of a per user kind of consideration. Some people feel it and are more sensitive to it, others are not. But. David, run.
00:28:07.034 - 00:28:07.906, Speaker D: Yeah, jump in.
00:28:08.010 - 00:28:59.478, Speaker C: Yeah. I was going to say one interesting thing that we haven't confirmed yet, but if you read the documentation for Unity four, one of the things that hooks say they can do is it can allow liquidity being provided across invariants. And it's plural and what that potentially means. And we don't know exactly what the implications are of that yet. Like, maybe uniswap governance will have say over what type of amm invariants are going to be allowed on the platform and can be used in hooks? So one of the interesting things, like, I agree, Univ. Three today is extremely hard to become a good lp, and maybe not everyone should become, maybe not everyone is a market maker. But you actually see two different approaches today, where Uniswap kind of obviously created its toolkit or its liquidity provision system in uni V three specifically for sophisticated market makers.
00:28:59.478 - 00:29:45.826, Speaker C: And then curve V two took a completely different approach where they had like passive concentrated liquidity, where liquidity, every single time a new transaction happens, a user wants to do a transaction on curve, has to pay extra gas cost for the liquidity in the pool to follow wherever the oracle prices of the pool. And it kind of moves, it shifts the liquidity for the user on behalf of them. And one of the interesting things is like, can hooks potentially allow passive, contrary liquidity pools on uni V four? My gut says yes. So it actually serves all users, serves professional market makers for like the institutional, maybe KYC pools and for the non KYC pools, if that's even going to be a thing for pass trade, passive concentrated liquidity, it really is loud. It democratizes market making pretty much for all, depending on what your skill set is.
00:29:45.970 - 00:30:17.720, Speaker D: That's a great point, David. I just want to conceptualize this for a lot of listeners that may not understand kind of the invariant that David's talking about. So basically you have a constant price kind of relationship, x and y. When you try to trade an asset, what these amms have innovated, like Uniswap created this invariant, xy that is basically, think of it like a law curve. Like it just basically looks like this. So it creates, just like, it depends on however amount you want to trade. It creates sort of like these ranges, right? And that was kind of highly innovative, right.
00:30:17.720 - 00:30:40.550, Speaker D: When you want to trade, basically, it allowed to trade a tail end of assets and you could provide liquidity on, then you had different kind of. So you think about the slope of the curve. That's kind of the invariant. And for instance, curve, which was an innovation of a type of amm, it just created like the stable swap invariant, was just like flatter within a particular, more concentrated range.
00:30:40.582 - 00:30:40.774, Speaker A: Why?
00:30:40.814 - 00:31:24.878, Speaker D: Because when you're trading a stable coin, like a type of stable coin, if it's dollar denominated, shouldn't fluctuate. Usually the volume is much reduced. So you can feel comfortable creating a flatter curve within a concentrated range where you're going to be trading like USDC with USDT as an example and uniswap. I think V three allowed for this, creating the range where you want to provide, but it was still the same kind of curve. The slope was the same, but you could just say, I just want to provide liquidity. I guess my hand for people on this range of the slope. What you're saying now, and correct me if I'm wrong, is v four adds more flexibility because you can change the slope of the curve or just shift it.
00:31:24.878 - 00:31:34.314, Speaker D: Is it changing the slope or also just kind of shifting the curve? It feels like. I just want users to kind of appreciate what you just said, but let me know if I got it wrong.
00:31:34.654 - 00:32:15.634, Speaker C: No, what you said is 100% correct, it sounds like, and we don't know for sure, but in the uni v four documents, it pretty much said that you can have multiple invariants. So that tells me it's not just x times Y equals k, it's not just the normal constant product mark amm invariant. It potentially can start whitelisting. Or maybe it's going to be permissionless. It's going to allow different invariants that are allowed. Whereas again, like curvy two and stable swap pools. That curve invented for exactly what you said before, where you have different pairs, assets that don't have high volatility to one another, they relatively fluctuate within one to one price variance.
00:32:15.634 - 00:32:58.414, Speaker C: If you're allowed to have multiple different types of variants depending on the pool, that obviously opens up the floodgates for passive retail users like myself, let's say, to provide liquidity. And maybe one of the pools just automatically moves my liquidity around wherever the mid price is of a given asset. If that's true, honestly, you're really like what Ren said, you're really not going to see, you're not going to need new amms to be built anymore. You can just literally create a hook that creates a liquidity pool that mimics whatever new functionality that the latest amm to get a seed round is claiming is their secret sauce. Uniswap v four pretty much allows any pool to be its own secret sauce, and you create whatever you want.
00:32:58.754 - 00:33:35.404, Speaker D: And I am curious, for instance, when v three launched, a lot of people saying, well, what does that actually mean for curve? And will liquidity migrate from curve to uniswap? That hasn't been the case. I think. Still, stablecoin swaps, people go to curve, or like, for like swaps, you go to curve. It has incentives. And you could argue that without incentives, maybe the game would be different, but lo and behold, hasn't been the case. What does this mean for a curve? Like, now that we have v four, what would you say would happen to curve? And maybe other amms? But I'm interested particularly in curve, because curve is just such an important piece of the ecosystem that I'm curious to get your thoughts on what this means for them.
00:33:36.024 - 00:33:50.024, Speaker B: I want to say that curve still has its role within deFi. Obviously it has this whole sort of ecosystem with V curve convex and everything that's happening around it, especially with the recent launch of Curve USD and sort of like the lamb.
00:33:50.064 - 00:33:52.924, Speaker D: This is their stable coin for folks that don't know, right?
00:33:53.424 - 00:34:27.244, Speaker B: Yep, the new stable coin and then llama is they're basically borrowing a lending protocol for that stable coin. And also, curve has recently undergone a slew of updates. Right. Curve launched their sort of new v two pools, and that greatly decreased the gas cost that needed for these pools to rebalance based on the oracles. But now Uniswap has also come in with their sort of like gas efficiency improvement. Right. With these singleton contracts, the cost to deploy a pool is going to decrease by 99%.
00:34:27.244 - 00:35:03.822, Speaker B: With a singleton contract, multi hop transactions will likely be cheaper too. And so I think curve is still going to be able to compete. Maybe a lot of the investment thesis behind curve and sort of the new like v two poos, curve USD and llama, especially if uniswap goes out and like builds their own borrowing. Lending market may be gone, but I think curve is still the de facto home for, you know, stablesofts. And the curve USD seems to be doing pretty well so far. There's probably around, I want to say, 2020, 5 million of curve USD minted so far. And the llama is a very innovative model that people are picking on.
00:35:03.822 - 00:35:14.834, Speaker B: You know, soft liquidations perform very differently to hard liquidations. And for now it just seems like a better borrowing lending mechanism for both sides of the trade.
00:35:15.974 - 00:35:57.656, Speaker C: Yeah, I think ultimately, though, the only, I don't want to say the only thing, but what curve has going for it is that a lot of protocols are dependent on curve success. A lot of protocols own the curve token. They need curves liquidity. And unless Uniswap somehow starts catering to individual protocols and offering some type of liquidity mining program, which I don't think is going to happen, like curve is still going to have its use case for those specific protocols. And if those protocols end up doing well in finding product market fit, you can see curve kind of not piggybacking off like their success. But curve still, like having a dominant market share in the industry. Obviously Uniswap still has 80% plus market share today.
00:35:57.656 - 00:36:37.684, Speaker C: But I think outside of curve, I don't see any other decks in the, at least in the Ethereum ecosystem really doing well. What's happening right now is uniswap started with a consumer facing application and it's starting to build deeper into the protocol layer and obviously offering these tools, tool sets and becoming more infrastructure at this point, I feel like the next obvious step for Uni V five is to own an app chain. Like, I don't understand how that isn't the next logical step because they can pretty much do anything that an app chain can, except they're not fully state aware from like an mvv perspective. And to do like full, full customization. So I feel like that has to be the next step for uni v four. I mean, I can't imagine next v five is.
00:36:37.724 - 00:36:42.292, Speaker A: Yeah, David, I'm shocked we made it 35 minutes into this. Before you brought up, I was going.
00:36:42.308 - 00:36:47.472, Speaker D: To say, I mean, it sounds like we talk about app change more. More and, you know. Yeah, I agree with you, Jason.
00:36:47.568 - 00:36:55.964, Speaker A: David's our, David's our Cosmos guy in house. So, David, maybe can you lay out this app chain thesis a little more and tell us why this makes sense for uniswap?
00:36:56.984 - 00:38:10.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I think ultimately the app chain thesis is when you have developers where you have a community owning the entire stack, from the blocks to the consumer facing application, to maybe even some of the middleware, not only can you potentially monetize at every layer of the stack, but because you own that full stack, you're actually able to have like full, full customization of your application. Your application and your chain are actually aware of each other. So there's application specific logic that you can bake into how your chain actually comes to consensus. A really good example as to why, like, I think this makes sense is going back to EIP 1153. I want to make sure I say it right, which is the transient storage that is potentially going into Cancun for Uniswap. So for uniswap Singleton contracts, for them to actually have like the most optimal gas efficient routing and pool creation, for Singleton to really be the best product it can be, it needs transient storage to be baked into Ethereum. The problem is that not maybe there's some political side to this where like, maybe it doesn't make sense for Ethereum to be catering to a specific protocol because then it starts losing its credible neutrality.
00:38:10.310 - 00:39:08.514, Speaker C: I'm not sure exactly what the potential cons are of including transient storage, but a few months ago, when this was brought up in conversation, there were a lot of takes on why Ethereum should not be like kind of bending the knee to Uniswap as the most powerful defi primitive on its ecosystem to change its roadmap and maybe prioritize one or the other. If Uniswap was an app chain and its community was like, well, we want to just build the best product. I don't necessarily care that, or I don't necessarily like, I want to prioritize this specific thing, and I want it to be built into now because I want to make sure I'm building the best product for my users. If you own your own full stack, you can do that. You're not. You don't have to start like politicizing or lobbying for a reason why your specific opcode that you want in Ethereum needs to go ahead of others. So I think that kind of owning the full stack from a monetization perspective, from building the most mature product, I personally envision that the future of all of crypto is going to be an app chain model, because it really gives the community ownership of the application.
00:39:08.514 - 00:39:14.214, Speaker C: Whereas right now, everything that's built on Ethereum is really at the mercy of Ethereum.
00:39:14.714 - 00:40:26.170, Speaker B: I'm going to come in with a slightly hot take here, actually, I think the v four to me kind of signifies that unisoft may not go to an app chain model. The reason I say this is because a lot of the reason why a DeFi protocol will move to an app chain model is value capture, right? That value capture happens through two ways. One, either the internalization of MEV, or two, kind of turning on the feesage from soft fees that LP's currently gather. And with Univ four, you're kind of allowing these protocols when creating the liquidity pools and setting these hooks to internalize the MEV to some extent, right? And that's being like publicly pushed as a narrative by uniswap themselves, by Dan Robinson saying, hey, go and internalize the MEV, build interesting solutions to do that. And if that happens, then maybe there's not so much need for nav chain itself. Sure, there's certain problems with trying to internalize MEV due to how Ethereum is built right now, but that's like partially being self. I think another thing is, from a value capture perspective, definitely if Uniswap wanted to capture more value, they will want to move to an apt model.
00:40:26.170 - 00:41:01.254, Speaker B: But a lot of what Uni v four was about was trying to provide more fees to these liquidity pool sort of protocols, right? These people that are launching these liquidity pools, now you have withdrawal fees, now you have swap fees, and the protocol that's launching the hook can capture that withdrawal fee. The protocol that's launching the hook for that liquidity pool can also capture a portion of the soft fees. Right? If Uniswap's allowing all of these liquidity pool launchers to do that, then perhaps maybe they aren't that concerned about value capture and sort of like the whole app chain.
00:41:01.334 - 00:41:07.870, Speaker A: Thesis, Ren, how does this inform your thoughts on what they should do with the fee switch?
00:41:07.982 - 00:41:17.060, Speaker B: I think it makes it an even harder discussion for them because previously the only entities to decide between was LP's and unitoken holders. Right?
00:41:17.092 - 00:41:17.332, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:17.388 - 00:42:14.204, Speaker B: Now you're adding an additional layer of complexity to that. I think for now it doesn't matter that much because, for example, 50% of units of volume is ETH USDC, and no one's going to sort of get that fee assumed because no protocol launches the ETH USDC pool. But I definitely think that basically, products coming in, turning on their own fees, which are going to have to compete with Uni and the LP's, and it's hard to say. Maybe there's an argument here for protocol on liquidity, right? For example, rather than having to pay liquidity providers, which is something that you can do these days with uni V four hooks, you might as well just say, all right, screw it, it's not worth paying uni liquidity providers anything. I'm just going to do protocol on liquidity. I don't have to tip them, I don't have to donate to them, I don't need to think about this entire fee switch to LP's, to unit token horse. I'm just going to take everything for myself.
00:42:14.324 - 00:42:48.360, Speaker C: I kind of struggle with this idea because I think at this point, Uniswap has such a commanding lead in the entire defi space, not even just Dex. They could easily create a lending market tomorrow, and I guarantee you it's probably going to take 75% market share. I very much think that crypto is really going to create digital monopolies over time, just because they're. They can really just expand indefinitely with really no limited, limited to no friction because they're so Lindy in their brands. I think that eventually a fee switch will happen for Uniswap. I honestly, at this point, don't see the need for them to do it. I like this.
00:42:48.360 - 00:43:18.864, Speaker C: There's a piece that I could share with you guys called, I'm sure you've read it, the hyper structure piece that pretty much you keep building until you grow so much that the entire economy is dependent on you and just the very nature that uni token holders could potentially eventually hold a fee switch. Just having that power alone makes the uni token valuable. And you can think about like Amazon shareholders. Amazon still, to my knowledge, does not distribute dividends, but the entire world's economy is pretty much dependent on Amazon and their supply chain and their logistics.
00:43:18.984 - 00:43:23.724, Speaker D: So like, I mean, certainly Amazon wasn't profitable until AWS came into the right.
00:43:24.934 - 00:44:04.494, Speaker C: Well, yeah, but even without that, right, like they kind of just took this approach and a lot of tech companies did this where it's like growth at any means necessary. And I think with crypto protocols you can even take that like the nth degree, you can kick out cash flow as long as possible because these pretty much these things could essentially like eat all of the financial world over time as long as they could scale with their users. So I think, you know, short end of it is, I don't think this necessarily has any impact on whether or not uniswap is going to add a fee switch or not. But I do like the idea that it kind of puts the ownership in the liquidity pool owners. Like it gives them the flexibility to decide whether or not they want to add a fee switch at the pool level.
00:44:06.754 - 00:44:30.286, Speaker A: Run. And David, how do you guys think about. I saw some push. Here's the counter argument to all of this, actually, there's a couple pieces I want to start getting into that maybe a little bit. One of them was, I'm just going to read this tweet from zero x relativity. They said crypto and Twitter has the most literal psychopaths I've ever witnessed. Uniswap literally just looked at crocswaps white paper and medium blog posts and was like, all right, I'm a control c, control v.
00:44:30.286 - 00:44:42.034, Speaker A: That shit. That shit looks good. With no credit to crocswap. I've seen some other pushback that like they basically just took the balancer v two model, copied it, but they've got Uniswap's brand. What's your thought on this?
00:44:43.594 - 00:45:09.894, Speaker B: I think that's the power and authority that Unisoft does have. I mean, if you're the market leader and other people have better features than you, yeah, you bet your ass I'm going to copy them and integrate them into my protocol and then sort of launch it as a platform model so that I don't need to do any work. Other people will launch sort of poos on Uniswap that mimic your protocol and tada. Suddenly I own everything.
00:45:10.634 - 00:45:45.642, Speaker D: They were on the other side of the stick with sushi and basically every other. I mean, and you could argue that everyone copied Vitalik's post and God knows where Vitalik got it from. So, you know, turtles all the way down. But I think what was the, the concern was this idea that it's like the licensing component and whether you want to adhere to the license. You know, big if, but that was, I think, where people saying they are painting this narrative that is open source, but when you actually look at the license, it is not. There are degrees and types of licenses and this is more on the restrictive side. So that is, I think, where the criticism came about.
00:45:45.642 - 00:45:47.354, Speaker D: I don't know if you guys would agree with that.
00:45:47.474 - 00:46:20.206, Speaker C: I. No, I was literally going to say the same thing. I think unfortunately, I mean, fortunately, unfortunately, there's a double edged sword with this open source innovation. It's incredible. You speed run all of financial technology history with everything, everyone innovating out in the open, but at the same time, it allows yourself to kind of do the great work. And then I'm not saying, you know, ripped off them or not, but rip off of great work, paste it as your own. The problem, though, is, well, now you're putting a license on it saying, I can't actually use this innovation for four years.
00:46:20.206 - 00:46:44.590, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, like, ultimately, that's why I think crypto is going to create monopolies over time is because it really comes down to brand first mover advantage. If you could just take an innovation from someone just putting it under the uniswap brand, it's immediately going to be a ten x better product, not just because it's technically better, but because it comes with the brand and the overall power and clout that that brand has.
00:46:44.702 - 00:47:14.188, Speaker D: Yeah, it's Lindy. Right? I mean, you talk about, like, sushi, like, who's sushi? I mean, Maki left, and then, you know, it's kind of like been a. They haven't innovated. And, you know, these guys have. And I think they're always at the cutting edge of trying to innovate new kind of new primitives and expand on what they have already, which is a lot of liquidity, a lot of brand recognition and the users. And so, you know, it's, it's hard to to just create a fork. And then I think countless forks, like, people have tried to curve, fork, curve a number of times.
00:47:14.188 - 00:47:48.004, Speaker D: It just failed. And so I guess more of a question to you, David, because you spent so much time the cosmos ecosystem, like, how do you envision the world? Like, with, in a multi chain thesis, if you believe that to be true? Like, you have, like, Uniswap is deployed, and, like, you can have base. So you have l two s, right? Theorem, but you also have different EVM compatible chains, non evm chains. What is the role of Uniswap here, and how does that world look like from a connectivity standpoint and bridging liquidity and whatnot? I'm curious to get your thoughts on that.
00:47:49.904 - 00:48:21.276, Speaker C: Yeah, I've thought a lot about this. I think ultimately, it really depends. I honestly don't think atomic composability is that big of a deal. I think a lot of people thought Ethereum is, like, one of its main innovations was like, oh, atomic composability. You can borrow from something and then buy something in the same transaction. You're guaranteed transaction inclusion. I actually think asynchronous composability is probably good enough for, like, 99.9%
00:48:21.276 - 00:48:39.794, Speaker C: of use cases. And eventually, we'll kind of get to atomic composability with, like, gk roll ups. Yeah, right. I honestly don't see the allure. Like, who cares about flash loans? Like, that's great. That arbitrager can flash on $200 million and get a $3 arb. But, like, is that really financial innovation? Not really.
00:48:39.794 - 00:49:18.280, Speaker C: Just kind of like a cool feature. So I think in the short term, really what you're going to see is uniswap is obviously deploying across all these l two s. I think ultimately, the entire innovation, the entire crypto space needs to converge on one interoperability standard. I think that is probably the major thing that's holding the l two roadmap back. And obviously, I'm a Cosmos Maxi, so I'm going to talk my book. But I think the innovation, the main innovation for Cosmos and that entire ecosystem was IBC. Once you have a set standard on interoperating with one another, you kind of remove trust assumptions, or at least you make it as trustless as possible.
00:49:18.280 - 00:49:40.384, Speaker C: And I think what the. There's a lot, there's gonna be a lot of developments, I think, over the next year or two that the Ethereum L two space is gonna battle with, and they're gonna be kind of going back to lessons learned from the cosmos ecosystem. And I think one of my issues, or one of my concerns is that the l two space is gonna get more fragmented, more pvP, and really look ultimately like what the cosmos ecosystem does today.
00:49:40.504 - 00:50:08.754, Speaker D: I mean, people should go back and listen to the episode we recorded with Jack and Zaki from the cosmos ecosystem. And one of the things this is right, that around where they were announcing IBC or in some other features, and I asked I can, and he said something, and David, correct me here, or you believe differently, which is ultimately, IBC is going to be helpful, even for the Ethereum ecosystem, as a communication between l two s. And so that tech can be used within Ethereum, but also to communicate with cosmos chains. And so maybe that is the standard, right?
00:50:09.414 - 00:50:39.202, Speaker C: Yeah, I fully believe, and I know Ren and like, the analyst team on the research side, probably sick of me saying this, but there the industry has to converge on interoperability standard. And today there is no better interoperability standard that's more battle tested than IBC. And it has, like, the least trust assumptions possible. And there's already a lot of great teams like polymer and a couple. I think Ethereum research is actually funding some ZK IBC work. Like, I. There's already a lot of work that's being done to make a lot of the l two s IBC compatible.
00:50:39.202 - 00:51:07.790, Speaker C: So I'm really excited to see that happen, because then we actually have, like, a real super chain where, like, everyone talks one another. I fully believe in the multi chain thesis. I also think, like, a lot of communities are never going to leave their ecosystem. Solana ecosystem is probably going to say Solana until it's actually proven whether or not Solana is, like, a viable product or not. Same thing with Avalanche, same thing with cosmos. So instead of hoping that all your users and liquidity come to you, you got to kind of bridge to them. And I think, like, having interoperability standards is the way to do that.
00:51:07.790 - 00:51:33.528, Speaker C: And I ultimately think what's going to happen is, and you're already seeing this, like, uniswap is just going to have, like, output. They're going to have official front ends on every single l two. They could be able to talk to each other asynchronously, but ultimately, all that multi chain world has to be abstracted away. And I think IBC is the best way to do that. You can actually abstract away, like the multi chain thesis, so that there's one front end and the user doesn't even realize that when they do a swap, it's routing liquidity across all these different roll ups and app chains.
00:51:33.656 - 00:52:38.214, Speaker D: If you're the Uniswap BD team growth team, then it sounds to me that what you're saying is the go to market should be dominate the front end, dominate the user like brand, and then just plug in with IBC. And then just wherever they are, whatever liquidity is, just route it in the most efficient way in an asynchronous manner for 90% of use cases. And so I guess, you know, from an IBC standpoint, like, how far? Because I remember, like, looking at Cosmos 2018 and it was like I would be going to like the, the Berkeley conferences and it's like IBC's around the corner and then of course they had some like, internal, like, splits and whatnot that probably delayed the roadmap. But, like, how real is it? Like, is it ready to go? Like, is it battle tested enough? And an important distinction. I think it's not the same as a bridge because bridges have gotten a lot of criticism, rightfully so, because there's been a lot of hacks and user funds have been lost. But, you know, where is IBC in your mind, in terms of readiness and, like, prove, like, building Lindy so that more and more protocols and more and more kind of chains are comfortable using it?
00:52:39.154 - 00:53:32.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's probably, I think it's good enough today. I don't think it's obviously ready for, like, mainstream adoption yet. I would say, honestly, within the next twelve months, though, you're going to see a lot of interesting developments of IBC that are going to really make the entire cross chain experience, at least in the cosmos ecosystem, and other IBC compatible chains, like, completely seamless. So one, there's a couple of teams that are doing a lot of great work, like Strangelove, which is Jack Samplin's team, the stride team, which is like the major liquid staking provider in the cosmos ecosystem. They've done a lot of great work. So that you can actually do like, cross chain swaps with like one click, you can move tokens or you can move like, atom, let's say, from one chain to the other, liquid stake it, deposit it back, back to the cosmos hub in like one click transactions. So there's a lot of IBC abstraction, I'll say, and cross chain abstraction that has been done over the past three to six months.
00:53:32.194 - 00:53:59.466, Speaker C: And I think we're probably another, like six months away until you actually see app chains deploy official frontends on individual, like, generalized smart contract platforms in the cosmos and having that entire experience be abstracted away to be like just one front end that the user is going to be interacting with. I think it's like, I think everyone outside the cosmos ecosystem is completely, I don't say ignorant, but has no idea, like, how far IBC has come over.
00:53:59.490 - 00:54:19.434, Speaker D: The past six months. Well, I mean, cosmos, like, like, no bd team and Zaki would say, like, no, we're just pure tech guys. And you're like, fair. But yeah, yeah, it's a sort of interesting state where, like, we are in crypto, which is people have an opinion on, like, VHS versus Betamax. It's like, no, guys. Like, no one had an opinion on HTTPs and some of these standards in the stack. Like, you mean you.
00:54:19.434 - 00:55:24.574, Speaker D: It sort of like reflects the state of the industry, which is, it's. It's these hobbyists and, you know, tech enthusiasts that have a very strong opinion and affiliation to a chain and has sort of missing the broader picture, which is, you know, as these use cases get built out, the real users are not going to care, have any affiliation to Ethereum or Solana or Cosmos. All they will have a. They will care about, you know, the user experience, right. And if you're playing a game and if that requires making multiple hops and interacting multiple chains, will so be it. As long as the game is fun to play, you know? So not a lot of games in crypto today are fun to play, but, you know, we'll get there, hopefully 100%. This has been a very thorough discussion on Uniswap, and of course that took us into a tangent here, but I'm curious if there's anything else you guys would add or things that you're looking for, like, what is the timing? When does uni v four come out? How are people going to notice it? And how does it phasing out of, like, I guess because technically you can still use v three or you still going to be able to use it, right? So what does that look like for users? Like, what's the timeline here?
00:55:26.594 - 00:56:06.280, Speaker B: I want to say it's going to be a slow migration, like unit v two to v three. That was a slow migration. I suspect that v two to v four will actually be an even slow migration because deploying concentrated liquidity pools where that complexity is just sort of left to the user to choose. The range is very different from having to write an entire new smart contract auditing that, making sure it's battle tested, making sure you've thought through the entire mechanism design. Right. And I think one interesting thing that I would look forward to is where the protocols are going to build their own smart contracts for these hooks to point to. Or these are going to come as like, hooks as a service.
00:56:06.280 - 00:56:17.280, Speaker B: Right. I think not every protocol wants to spend their time thinking through all of these mechanisms, writing that additional complexity for the liquidity pools. And, yeah, we'll be very interested.
00:56:17.392 - 00:56:25.964, Speaker D: I haven't checked the governance form, but will there be incentives like, you know, could they, could you create a incentive where you get uni if you migrate?
00:56:27.344 - 00:57:06.836, Speaker B: I don't think so as of yet. But actually, interestingly, I think around two weeks ago, Gauntlet put out an liquidity mining stash incentive study that they were doing with uniswap on optimism, if I'm not wrong. And they basically did a super quantitative analysis. It showed that liquidity mining does work in some, to some extent, and in some cases it was fairly sticky. They did like the whole like, statistical regression analysis. And from what I've heard, Uniswap has been sort of doing these experiments. So maybe that's tutting of something that they may be considering to do for v four to promote migration, because what.
00:57:06.860 - 00:57:33.494, Speaker D: You don't want is for users to forget about it, don't migrate. And look at Aave, for instance, different experience, but Ave still has plenty of liquidity on v two, then v three, you know what I mean? Like, I think it's v two, v three, v one still. So like liquidity is sticky and users like sometimes are not as active. So you need to incentivize them to kind of migrate over. So gauntlet is, my understanding, is one of the top delegates in the Uni governance committee. And so, yeah, I mean, they carry a lot of weight, certainly.
00:57:33.834 - 00:57:34.146, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:34.170 - 00:57:55.294, Speaker B: I think one last thing that I want to sort of look forward to is how protocols will think about donating to liquidity to providers and incentivizing liquidity, because now you can directly do so through these hooks. So maybe they'll think about donating to very specific in range liquidity providers and they'll be interesting to see how they sort of structure those incentives.
00:57:55.854 - 00:57:57.782, Speaker D: Mm hmm. Awesome, guys.
00:57:57.838 - 00:57:58.006, Speaker A: Hey.
00:57:58.030 - 00:58:18.558, Speaker D: Well, it's really nice having you both on. I mean, David, I think we're due for a much deeper discussion on Cosmos at some point. And, yeah, so maybe you are the de facto business, you know, BD head of. Unofficial BD head of Cosmos. Yeah, I was looking at your profile, by the way. You know, I told Jason, but, wow, I so clearly haven't made it because you don't follow me. So it's great.
00:58:18.558 - 00:58:26.138, Speaker D: Go out and follow David. He's a way better follow than me. And, um, I just followed him. And so, yeah, I followed you back.
00:58:26.266 - 00:58:26.762, Speaker C: Okay.
00:58:26.818 - 00:58:28.162, Speaker D: All right, great. Awesome.
00:58:28.258 - 00:58:29.014, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:58:30.634 - 00:58:35.386, Speaker D: Not that we care about followers here, folks. I've been basically stuck in, like, the same number for Santi.
00:58:35.410 - 00:58:36.298, Speaker C: We're battling.
00:58:36.386 - 00:58:39.122, Speaker A: You know that? You know that we are, I think, tied right now.
00:58:39.258 - 00:58:40.162, Speaker D: Oh, no, let me go.
00:58:40.258 - 00:58:40.530, Speaker C: You're.
00:58:40.562 - 00:58:43.094, Speaker A: No, you're a 101 four. I'm 101 two.
00:58:43.714 - 00:58:44.410, Speaker D: Well, let me go.
00:58:44.442 - 00:58:45.574, Speaker C: I just unfollowed.
00:58:47.314 - 00:58:51.228, Speaker A: So when Mike and I were working pretty closely with pomp, you say you unfold me? Come on, man.
00:58:51.306 - 00:59:00.080, Speaker D: Guys, please. I'll make the. You always do go to promotion by. I'm like, guys, go follow me right now. Okay? If you're a bot, I don't care. Just go follow me at Santiago.
00:59:00.152 - 00:59:00.392, Speaker A: Okay?
00:59:00.408 - 00:59:03.844, Speaker D: And then there'll be, I don't know, wink, wink. Maybe an airdrop. No, I'm kidding. No airdrop.
00:59:06.024 - 00:59:07.336, Speaker A: That's it. That's the app.
00:59:07.400 - 00:59:29.642, Speaker D: That's it. That's the app. Guys, we're not going to talk about anything else other than next time. When we tune in, we're going to start who has more followers? Maybe this is going to become a thing. Whoever has more followers between now and permissionless, whoever wins, I'm calling it now. Jason, if you want to meet me in this kind of competition, let's see who gets more followers between now and permissionless. And then after missiles, whoever loses will have to do something like sponsor, like, what are we?
00:59:29.658 - 00:59:30.214, Speaker A: Better.
00:59:34.594 - 00:59:37.214, Speaker D: Shave your head. I'll shave my beard.
00:59:39.154 - 00:59:40.814, Speaker A: Hair than anyone does.
00:59:41.194 - 00:59:51.494, Speaker D: I haven't shaved my beard in, like, 15 years. Since I've. At JP Morgan. Yes, guys, I'm that old. Um, so why don't. Why don't we do that? Whoever has the least amount of followers. You shave your head.
00:59:51.494 - 00:59:52.798, Speaker D: I shaved my beard.
00:59:52.926 - 00:59:54.310, Speaker A: That's a horrible bet.
00:59:54.382 - 00:59:55.174, Speaker D: It's a symmetric.
00:59:55.254 - 00:59:56.794, Speaker B: That doesn't seem fussy.
00:59:59.174 - 01:00:01.254, Speaker D: No one said this was an equal playing field.
01:00:01.374 - 01:00:06.414, Speaker A: All right, we'll give it a week. We'll come back. I'm down to make this bet. But we'll. We'll think of the bet in the next week. Thanks for listening, folks.
