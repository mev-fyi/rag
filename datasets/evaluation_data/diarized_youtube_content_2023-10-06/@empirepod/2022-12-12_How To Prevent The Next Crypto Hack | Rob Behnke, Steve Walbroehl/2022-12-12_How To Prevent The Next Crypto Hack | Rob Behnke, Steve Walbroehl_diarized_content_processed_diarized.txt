00:00:00.200 - 00:00:13.714, Speaker A: We're still in the pioneering stages of all this. And when code equals money, and when you're. Your money is theoretically locked up in these contracts, they're only, as. You know, the other thing that we say is like, you're only as strong as your weakest line of code.
00:00:15.414 - 00:00:26.774, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. You got me running this one solo. Santi's taking this one off. He's traveling. Today we are joined by Rob and Stephen of Halborn. Welcome, guys.
00:00:26.894 - 00:00:27.782, Speaker C: How you doing?
00:00:27.958 - 00:00:43.754, Speaker B: Howdy. Howdy. Rob, man, this is joking before. This is a long time in the making. I think the first time we ever spoke, you had two employees, which you duly noted out was just you and Stephen. So congrats on everything, man. How big is Halbourne these days?
00:00:45.294 - 00:01:01.130, Speaker A: Last time, I think we're about 140 now. Globally distributed around the world. We have about a third of our people are based in the United States. A third of our people happen to be in Spain, and then another third, definitely distributed throughout the, you know, kind of throughout the globe.
00:01:01.282 - 00:01:21.418, Speaker B: Nice. Awesome, guys. So, just for context, for folks who don't know, Hellborn, Stevens, CTO. Rob, your CEO, both co founders. You guys announced this $90 million Series A in the summer. Summit partners, Castle Island, DCG. I think it was Brevin, third Prime, Sky Vision, Fenwick.
00:01:21.418 - 00:01:41.842, Speaker B: You guys have hundreds of clients, I'm pretty sure at this point. And to my not, I wanted to bring you guys on because in my mind, you guys are the leading cybersecurity firm in crypto. But I think it'd be helpful. We usually don't do this at the beginning of episodes, but maybe just because you guys are a little more behind the scenes, can you just give an overview of what Halborn is and what you guys do? Sure.
00:01:41.938 - 00:02:12.522, Speaker A: Absolutely. We'll make the quick version. Halbourne is a cybersecurity company for the world of web. Three, we're all B two B. We focus on major enterprises as well as major blockchain foundations and Defi protocols. I think people tend to lump every security company in the space into smart contract auditing. And while we do smart contract auditing, what really focused on is what we call security advisory.
00:02:12.522 - 00:02:54.714, Speaker A: And it's this idea that basically there's so much more that you can pwn besides a smart contract. And we've seen that time and time again in sort of all the headlines that you folks at blockworks and many others publish about. And so we're really just here to help secure the whole stack. And so we really have a fundamental focus in what is, what's really just called, like, end to end security. So all the web, two assets, all the on chain components, all the off chain components. And while we are. While we've made a name for ourselves in this space in a really short amount of time in sort of professional services and consulting, we have a pretty extensive amount of products that will be dropping throughout the course of next year.
00:02:54.714 - 00:03:03.030, Speaker A: Actually, about six to seven of those products throughout the end of the next year. But, yeah, I'll stop there. That's a little bit about us.
00:03:03.142 - 00:03:43.092, Speaker B: So it's interesting, because I wanted to bring you guys on after some of the hacks were happening, and I feel like we kept punting on this episode. There are over $2 billion of hacks this year. Right? 100 million, and I'm gonna maybe botch some of these, but, like, 100 million BNB chain, like 600 million in Ronin, like 325 in wormhole, 100 million in harmony. I'm not even sure if I'm getting all those correct here, but basically a ton of hacks. But you guys wanted to. When you pinged me about this episode, you wanted to focus, you wanted to kick this off, talking about the systemic risk, and you said, we're highly opinionated on this topic, which I'm just curious. I think we should start there because you guys want to go there.
00:03:43.092 - 00:03:58.724, Speaker B: But I thought you were going to want to talk about smart contract risk and hacks. But I think you want to go broader and talk about the systemic risk in the system. So, Rob, can you just let, like, I'm going to tee you up. Super broad question. Like, why, like, why. Why do you want to talk about this? Why do you guys feel so strongly about this?
00:03:58.804 - 00:04:07.012, Speaker A: Well, security and risk go hand in hand. And so, you know, when you. When you talk to major enterprises, you know, there's first departments, compliance and security.
00:04:07.108 - 00:04:07.412, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:07.468 - 00:04:32.218, Speaker A: And so, you know, it's funny, like, we were also going to. Pardon. We were going to have a conversation, and then all the FTX stuff started to happen. And really, that's just, that goes into sort of the core thesis about, you know, there's so much more at risk, both on chain and off chain. But I'll, you know, Steve, what do you. What do you.
00:04:32.306 - 00:04:58.848, Speaker C: Yeah, so, yeah, I could totally talk about systemic risk. I think it's. Rob and I have long conversations about it and looking at it as a whole, because you can be very prescriptive and go on wrecked and talk about what went wrong with Ronin, what went wrong with poly network and BNB bridge. And so on and so on. And they're all. There's specific issues that impact them and we check for that. But broadly, we care about security of the entire space.
00:04:58.848 - 00:05:19.330, Speaker C: We want to see it succeed. All boats rise with the water here. And we want to. That's the reason why Rob and I got into it, is because we like what crypto and blockchain can do for technology and for people. And we want to secure it to build trust. So you do that holistically. It's about eliminating systemic risk.
00:05:19.330 - 00:06:06.984, Speaker C: And there's a lot of it that we see right now. Rob just mentioned what happened with FTX. And before we could look at Celsius and we can look at Terra and some of these large impacting things that are just like lowering trust for everybody that has, whether you're very knowledgeable of it or you're new to it, and it really kind of hinders the growth and adoption by consumers and lowering the trust. And it's something that really. It's hard to secure that. Because a lot of the issues happening with that is things that go against really don't have anything to do with the core of blockchain and what's trying to solve people issues. It's auditing issues, it's fraud.
00:06:06.984 - 00:06:40.628, Speaker C: But that's systemic risk around not really the technology at all. But some of the large things that are happening that I think is in the wrong direction. That we see that eventually leads to it, is this search for super high apy. And that can't sustain itself over time. And we look at bitcoin, I'm a big bitcoin maxi. That's what I got started into it. It's about sound money and 21 million cap and deflationary asset.
00:06:40.628 - 00:07:19.140, Speaker C: Yet a lot of things we're doing with even that is derivatives and synthetics, and wrapped assets, and then staked assets of the wrapped assets. And you have these layers and layers, layers. It really reminds me of some of the risks that we were taking on with 2008 financial crisis of like these derivative contracts and synthetic CDO's and CDO's. Just eventually when the shit hits the fan, sorry, it becomes chaos. And there's systemic risk that just can't be controlled. And it eventually happens there. I think we've seen a couple times right now.
00:07:19.140 - 00:07:34.506, Speaker C: So I think that's where we get into it. Just with around Defi and stuff. Not even looking at the code or the vulnerabilities on that. I think that's one of the things that we really, really look at just from principles on the outside, not picking on any particular protocol.
00:07:34.610 - 00:07:58.324, Speaker A: Mike, we look at it from the foundational perspective. We really got into bitcoin for all the purposes that most people on this podcast got into it with. And then we see a lot of the same mistakes happening right now compared to what bitcoin came out of. 2008 financial crisis. Now, all of a sudden, we're reinventing this idea of synthetics and cross chain synthetics and so on. It's like we're not learning any lessons there.
00:07:58.784 - 00:08:50.850, Speaker C: Yeah, and it's interesting, too, because DeFi is amazing. There's so many things you could do to solve some problems, like lending and borrowing, for example, giving mortgage loans. You could have people be able to use smart contracts to execute and, you know, buy real estate much quicker or get a loan much quicker, do it more transparently, do it, you know, using, like, escrow payments, and use the technology for improvement and truly move into, like, a web. A web3, so to speak. And. But we get to become obsessed with, like, this, the value, like a token value for something, and just like, value chasing on things. And it's like, almost like human greed pushing it forward rather than human improvement and process improvement and enabling new things.
00:08:50.850 - 00:09:47.484, Speaker C: I think we should focus on that much more because cryptocurrency is one aspect of it, but there's so many things that are just beyond, not just currency, the actual technology used for it. So I think if we open our minds perspective on what it can do, then it's going to be a lot brighter future. And of course, we're always there to now look at the code vulnerabilities around that, rather than financial or environmental issues that can happen. So that's like one aspect of systemic risk, and then another one is coding of things. We could go down that topic again about, like, one vulnerability is found, but everybody's forked the code, and we see it. Let's just say we found the metamask Zero day a while ago, published and released how many people had forked Metamask's code. And then just now, you have the same vulnerability with every solution.
00:09:47.484 - 00:10:04.420, Speaker C: There's no diversification with that because of the nature of open source. So that's another systemic risk type. It's not really financial, environmental related, more to code issues that you can see where it just impacts everybody. There's no diversification in the technology sometimes, especially because of how new it is. Yeah.
00:10:04.452 - 00:10:38.954, Speaker A: So these are the topics that Steve and I and our executive team are talking about all day, every day. And just by. By working with dozens of leading layer ones and defi protocols and enterprises. We get this more macro overview of the whole space from these conversations stems. Okay, well, there should be a product there. There should be something to help solve that. We've recently out a concept called Serif, which is a blockchain security notary solution, which is supposed to be able to help situations like this.
00:10:38.954 - 00:10:40.874, Speaker A: So. Yeah, and that's all.
00:10:41.974 - 00:11:09.426, Speaker B: So I think that. I think the. Stephen, I think you hit the nail on the head, which is there. There are really two main issues in the industry. In the industry, I would say one is on the leverage side of things, and one is on the security side of things. Basically, in bear markets, leverage is probably your biggest nightmare because everything unwinds really, really quickly. So if you even look at, like, Genesis loan books three years ago, in Q four, they had like 50 million of loans outstanding.
00:11:09.426 - 00:11:45.492, Speaker B: Last year in Q four, they had 50 billion. Right. 100 x increase. And so that unwinds really, really quickly. And everyone right now is, if you look at all the podcasts and the news stories and the Twitter threads, it's like, what's the contagion? And really what people are saying is like, okay, like, what's the next domino to fall? I would love to actually focus on the other one here, which is, in bear markets, leverage is the biggest nightmare. In bull markets, security and hacks end up being the biggest risk. And it's really obvious why, which is there's so much money going around, everyone trying to capture market share.
00:11:45.492 - 00:12:01.821, Speaker B: They end up moving really, really quickly, and hacks start happening. And that's why you see a lot of hacks in bull markets. Less owned bear markets. At least that would be my thesis. I'm curious. One thing I am not technical. So when I look at all these hacks, it really feels like you're playing whack a molecule.
00:12:01.821 - 00:12:27.494, Speaker B: Right? I'm like, oh, this bridge hack happened because of this. This bridge hack happened because of this thing. Okay? So then people learn how to solve that, and then it's like, okay, well, then this l one went down because of this issue from 2018. Okay. Boom, we solved that. And it's like, it really does feel like playing whack a mole. So I'm curious, Steven, what do you like when you look at the security landscape today? Like, what do you think are the biggest issues? What do you like, basically, how do you think things are going today?
00:12:27.574 - 00:12:51.792, Speaker C: So, yeah, you're right. I love the bear market and bull market thesis because you hit the nail on the head as well. Where during bull market people are in a rush. And it's not just like developers, it's users as well. So I think the two biggest issues on the first, the user side is just awareness. People are excited. They don't know what to trust.
00:12:51.792 - 00:13:42.932, Speaker C: They just want to get their fomoing. And they just like, we'll go in things. So it's like social engineering phishing. We see so many ICO, like Twitter, telegram, like chat rooms of like fake tokens or duplicating that, and they lose their money right away, and they're not doing their research, they're getting scammed, losing their private keys. And it's just user awareness, which is not dissimilar to like normal security for people on the developer side, which is what we interact with more because we're auditing and doing the reviews of the code and the technology solutions. Yeah, it's developers trying to go to market faster, rushing through code. And again, that systemic risk too, of reusing something that may be vulnerable.
00:13:42.932 - 00:14:13.084, Speaker C: And just like, okay, well, it's an ERC 20 contract. Everybody uses it, it should be fine. And then all of a sudden you see an issue in ERC 20. It's like, oh, crap. And now everybody's there. Now everybody's effective for it. And because in relation to the normal web two world, it's still new, it's still small, and we're finding issues that are very novel and like zero days very often.
00:14:13.084 - 00:14:46.158, Speaker C: That's why it seems like whack a mole. It's like, okay, this is a new issue we've never seen before. And that's a new issue we've never seen before. And we have these new classification of issues that have never seen before. Security has a thing called OWAsp top ten, and it's like the top web vulnerabilities like SQL injections. And it's almost like, oh, that's boring now because you see it all the time. And here it's like the top ten is defining brand new things that we have our own categories we use internally that are very, very novel.
00:14:46.158 - 00:15:27.080, Speaker C: And we're like, oh my God. So, like, here's integer sanitation for rust buffers. And like, okay, that's. How do we classify that? I don't know. So because it's moving so fast, you can't take security for an afterthought because people's money is like on a line right away, everything moves extremely fast, including hacks. And in traditional security, if you find a vulnerability or you phish somebody, you're inside the network and moving around. Finally, after maybe a week or a month, you extract credit cards from the database.
00:15:27.080 - 00:16:00.468, Speaker C: Here, you miss one line of code, and there's one flaw. Some very creative hacker finds it, they can immediately extract millions of dollars, you know, just get away with it. So the stakes are way higher, the timelines way faster, the security issues are way more unique and unresearched. And it requires a lot of time and attention from engineers and people like us to do that, do research and work with developers to think about logically, how, you know, what could go wrong with this stuff and think like a hacker.
00:16:00.596 - 00:16:26.548, Speaker A: And it's not an easy conversation when we're talking with Defi protocol founders and layer one founders. You know, I typically say, like, look like web. Like, if you're coming from the web two world, like, web two is move fast, break things. But in web3, it's move fast and lose all of your investor money. So it's really like, you need to have that discipline. When code equals money and code equals value, it's. There's so much more on the line.
00:16:26.548 - 00:16:56.626, Speaker A: It's so much more visceral and so, like, we're. We're typically the. We're typically the bottlenecks with our clients on purpose. Look, I understand that you're working on this deadline. It's very great that you're working on this deadline. We need this much time in order to make sure that we feel comfortable to be able to say that you should go out and launch. We're frankly proud of that, having that ability.
00:16:56.626 - 00:17:13.992, Speaker A: It's been sort of our rationale and our mindset that has been able to, you know, that's why we've kind of gained the reputation that we have throughout the last two, three years that we've been out there. You won't find our name on the rec list. I mean, it's like, it's pretty, pretty specific, actually.
00:17:14.048 - 00:17:32.076, Speaker C: We won one time, and it wasn't something we missed. It was, you know, we. We found the issue. We, you know, they just chose to accept the risk. They accepted the risk, and nobody, you know, most people don't read the report. There's like, oh, hack. They audited it.
00:17:32.076 - 00:17:34.268, Speaker C: That's it. It's like. But we found it. We should be.
00:17:34.356 - 00:17:43.684, Speaker A: Yeah, it's listed right there. It's literally listed right there for all the black hats to go out and PWN because we found it. The person just.
00:17:43.724 - 00:17:44.036, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:44.100 - 00:17:44.444, Speaker A: You know.
00:17:44.484 - 00:18:15.922, Speaker B: Yeah. So, guys, so, so Steven just used this word like, we audited it. And one, the. The way that I know that I understand a lot of the security happens today is smart contract audits. When I speak with folks who are in your positions, and like some of the smartest people I know on the dev side, they're like, smart contract audits are like a total band aid solution. It's long term, a horrible solution to solving some of these security risks. I'd love to hear your guys take on like, I know one thing you guys do is smart contract audits.
00:18:15.922 - 00:18:20.594, Speaker B: But I'm curious if you think that's a long term sustainable way to keep, to keep defi safe.
00:18:20.754 - 00:18:49.076, Speaker C: Here's my take on it. In security, there's different types approaches to security. You have really preventative ones and reactive ones. And with smart contract audit, what you're doing is you're doing preventative, which there's not too many options. We have a tool I'll talk about in a second. That's the first preventative tool. But an audit is a prevention mechanism to say, okay, we're preparing for it.
00:18:49.076 - 00:19:22.708, Speaker C: We want to eliminate the future issues from happening. And, you know, it's a service. And the problem is you're trusting that it was complete and there's no issues, and you put it out there on the blockchain and after that it becomes reaction. It's okay, it's getting hacked. Pause the contract or freeze the USDC. You're responding to it because it's decentralized. It's very hard to control it and not be decentralized.
00:19:22.708 - 00:19:38.916, Speaker C: That's the thing. It's out there. It's transparent, it's open source. And the code is law. They often say. So. That's why auditing is valued and why I wouldn't say it's a band aid.
00:19:38.916 - 00:20:12.024, Speaker C: It's a layer. There's defense in depth. You should be doing many things. There's not one trick pony for anything, not even like normal web two security. You should always have layers and layers of security and layers of prevention and monitoring and everything, until you feel risk has been reduced to an acceptable level. That's what it comes down to with anything. With cybersecurity and with the uniqueness of blockchain being decentralized, it's hard to have secure controls that are preventive and not overstep into centralization.
00:20:12.024 - 00:21:00.714, Speaker C: So that's why with Serif, which Rob had mentioned before, that's one of our first solutions that we've launched. It's adding a notary, a trusted third party that can be somebody else, or it could be Halbourne that will just on chain in a non custodial way be able to notarize just critical transactions like a withdrawal of funds or something. That's like a huge. An upgrade of an admin or something. That shouldn't happen too often, only under particular conditions to get some sort of control on it and prevent edge cases or unexpected results. So that's what we've built. And I think auditing has been the only thing really to provide that preventative aspect.
00:21:01.934 - 00:21:05.754, Speaker B: Stephen, what were the two buckets? You said there's preventative and then there's. What's the other bucket?
00:21:06.794 - 00:21:16.778, Speaker C: Prevention and reaction. Reacting to a hack. Like, oh, we're getting hacked. Like let's freeze it or just monitor it or let's. Yeah, this, you're acting to something already happened.
00:21:16.906 - 00:21:29.394, Speaker A: Some, some security folks in the space have focused on insurance protocols, so things like that where, oh shit, you get hacked and now here's some money back. So that's, yeah, that's, that's an example of a reactive solution.
00:21:29.554 - 00:21:54.344, Speaker B: I mean, how, like when I look at how folks have been reactive today, it's so, it's interesting, right, because governance makes some decision making pretty slow, right? You need like four of seven or five of seven to change something to change like a base layer of a protocol that's really, really good when you're building like infrastructure, but really bad when there's money that needs to be stopped from flowing. So I'm curious, like, how do you advise on the reactive side of things to set things up?
00:21:54.464 - 00:22:41.312, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the balance. So if you look at compare centralized finance to decentralized finance, the problems with the decentralized finance side that you just pointed out is slow reaction time. You know, it's up to governance to make the choice. What if it's malicious governance that's like on there and you have to respond quickly and people don't participate, maybe there's a flaw. So there's the reaction side of it. And also the transparency of governance itself can be an issue. On the centralized side is like now you have loss of control as the user and you trust that the developers, the owners or the custody, the bank, so to speak, is going to make the right decisions on your behalf.
00:22:41.312 - 00:23:16.792, Speaker C: And they're not transparent, but you trust they are because of their reputation. So there's good and bad on both sides. So we sit right in the middle with our approach. We're objective and we tell the truth. We are trying to find the balance between CFI and DeFi. So the tools do that to see what makes sense. We're providing a method to react quickly while controlling it, but also doing it in an objective spirit of decentralization and provide transparency.
00:23:16.792 - 00:23:32.614, Speaker C: Be a kind of a third party witness, so to speak, or notary, to help even governance can make a decision on whether to include it. It's a bridge right in the middle to get the benefits of both sides.
00:23:33.514 - 00:23:38.134, Speaker B: What is this notary product you guys keep mentioning? Rob, can you.
00:23:38.674 - 00:24:01.734, Speaker A: Yeah, we soft launched it last, really, like last month. And by soft launch, we're just, we're just approaching, really, our current clients right now. So there are a couple of defi protocols that are going to be launching Janfeb with it. It's called serif, which is serif co actually. And we've been, we've been building this out for the last, probably close to twelve months at this point. And, you know, excited to finally.
00:24:02.034 - 00:24:19.810, Speaker B: So it's a. So when you say it's a notary, and I'm. So it's basically a completely on chain notary, I would assume. Right, so it's a. You're. So you now introduce a third party witness who, like, in an off chain world, the notary would. If a third party witness to like, recognize important events, that's what a notary does.
00:24:19.810 - 00:24:26.214, Speaker B: So, like a notary in the on chain world would be someone who like, recognizes the signing of important on chain actions. Is that.
00:24:26.354 - 00:24:37.374, Speaker C: Yep. Think of it as a transactional level audit as well. Like, you. You're. It's on chain. It's not, it's not a multisig signer. For example, like you said, like five of seven signers.
00:24:37.374 - 00:25:30.638, Speaker C: Like, what if the on chain action is to change it from, you know, five of eight signers, and they upgrade the amount of signers? There may be that, that actual function can be notarized by a trusted third party, and that trusted third party can be any serif notary. So it's a way to only pick in advance, like identify the functions, like an emergency withdrawal. Say that we should never take all the money out of the vault for whatever reason, unless this happens. So that's like a runbook, like an instant response playbook that you meet the expected logical conditions or business reasons. So you say, okay, this is like the, you know, the break glass situation where we would use it. We're going to protect that function. If it's ever executed, then the notary gets alerted, they look at the call data or they look at the reasons why.
00:25:30.638 - 00:25:43.454, Speaker C: And if it meets, you know, okay, this isn't like going to tornado cache. It's not a hack. It's approved on chain and then it executes just like it does a normal transaction.
00:25:43.574 - 00:25:49.090, Speaker B: And you're just. This would be like the implementation would just be you add some lines of code to a smart contract.
00:25:49.222 - 00:26:05.930, Speaker C: Yep, exactly. Yeah. The technical term would be to add a modifier to the, you know, just like we have only, you know, reentry, non re entrancy and safe math. All of the these like, libraries. It's another contract. You import and only owner or with serif, pretty much.
00:26:06.002 - 00:26:12.334, Speaker B: And then you. I'm assuming you can define. Define things that you want to allow or not allow.
00:26:12.634 - 00:26:13.786, Speaker C: Yep, exactly.
00:26:13.930 - 00:26:26.142, Speaker B: Interesting. Very cool. All right, so, Rob. What? So I want to. Ten minutes ago, you were like, you mentioned insurance. You're like one of the, one of the ways that folks have been. Unless there's anything else to add on serif, but I'm assuming we'll talk about it throughout the conversation.
00:26:26.142 - 00:26:54.064, Speaker B: But on the insurance side of things, I feel like one, I feel like we have not, not, I feel like we have not been able to achieve a big insurance company or protocol or fund. And different people have tried to do insurance, like Nexus mutual tried to do this. Can you just tell me how insurance has gone in crypto and do you see insurance being something that pops, like on chain insurance being something that pops up in the next cycle or it's just too hard, like, what's your thesis on insurance?
00:26:55.364 - 00:27:33.174, Speaker A: I'm bullish on the concept of insurance, and I think we need a lot more at that in the market to get to the place where we need to be. It's not ever going to be something that Halbourne focuses on, because 99% of the general web two security, publicly traded markets is preventative security. We focus on preventative security, but when it comes to, you know, like, we definitely need to have that as part of the stack of. Part of a proper defense in depth strategy. But, you know, it's not. Not really going to be for us.
00:27:33.334 - 00:28:08.102, Speaker C: My take on it to try, because I actually used to work at insurance company as a security architect a long time ago. Insurance is. It's all about risk again, just like security and actuaries, they calculate what's the premium that we should provide to cover this level of risk, whether it's a person or a contract. And the risk is just way too high right now. So the premiums don't make sense. And the liquidity went back to the systematic impact of things. When something bad happens, it happens big.
00:28:08.102 - 00:28:37.610, Speaker C: And even the insurance providers are just like, we can't cover this much loss right now. I just think that we haven't been diversified enough to see it. And when bad things happen, it happens to the insurance defi insurance providers as well. So then, all right, well, let's increase the premiums for that. And then now it's like, well, the premium is too high now. Nobody wants to get it anymore. And so it's like, that's why we need, again, the higher level.
00:28:37.610 - 00:28:50.986, Speaker C: Like, the systematic approach. Like, we need to, like, eliminate possible loss exposure per incident to make the insurance, you know, contain the blast radius when it does happen.
00:28:51.130 - 00:28:53.894, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you see anyone working on insurance in the right way?
00:28:55.674 - 00:28:57.594, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. There's some good projects we have.
00:28:57.674 - 00:29:00.778, Speaker B: Rob, you're shaking your head no. And Steven's saying yes, so I got.
00:29:00.786 - 00:29:33.916, Speaker C: To work the concepts. Great white paper. Now, there's some solutions. There's, like, really two approaches for it. One is, like, holding collateral aside for it and then paying for that in reserves. The other one is doing one of our clients, fairside, for example, they're taking a different approach of having a way to really open a dow type of approach, where people determine what is a fair coverage or not based on per incident. And, you know, it's the loss.
00:29:33.916 - 00:29:47.024, Speaker C: You know, is it fraud? Is it a private key exposure? If this is a rug pull, you know, we, you know, should we provide or not, and let the people kind of decide on that and what the premium should be, which is a pretty. Pretty great, you know, kind of take on it.
00:29:47.324 - 00:29:50.264, Speaker B: Yeah. Rob, you agree with that?
00:29:50.564 - 00:29:51.780, Speaker A: I do. I do.
00:29:51.852 - 00:30:10.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Can we talk about bridges, guys? Because my. I just think they need. Yeah, I just think they need to be talked about because. All right, so, flashback. A year and a half, and we were. People were still asking the question, like, are we going to live in maybe two years ago, but, like, are we.
00:30:10.630 - 00:30:34.796, Speaker B: Are we going to. Are we going to live in a monolithic chain world or, like, a multi chain world? And then one of the things that happened kicking off with, like, Solana, summer, and, like, all these l one. Like, the l one wars, and then we got into 2022, and everyone's like, oh, okay. Like, confirmed, we will live in a multi chain world. And everyone's like, great. Like, we've got all these cool l one s that work, and then the bridge hacks started happening, and everyone's like, oh, crap. Like, there's a this.
00:30:34.796 - 00:30:49.160, Speaker B: Like, it's pretty complex to build a multi chain world. So can one of you guys at, like, my five year old developer brain, like, can you try to explain. Can you explain just like, why bridges are so tough to actually implement?
00:30:49.332 - 00:31:19.754, Speaker C: Yep. Two reasons and why they're. I'll start with why they're hacked. If you were a hacker, would you go and try to, like, pickpocket every single person and get a little bit change, or would you just go straight to the vault and just take it all? Probably go to the vault, just. Just take it there. Right. So that's one thing is like the, the target, the bridges, you know, most often they're implemented either with, you know, burning and minting on each side, or vaulting and holding it all in like a master, you know, vault that you can go and take, call it about.
00:31:19.754 - 00:31:56.244, Speaker C: So that's why a huge target for it, for hackers. And why are they hard to implement? It's because these protocols, they're often in different languages and they don't really talk to each other. There's not a standard to say if you're doing Solana to Ethereum. Solana is written in rust code and Ethereum is written in EVM and with, like, solidity contracts to get compiled. So how do you take those two functionalities and connect them securely? It's really hard to do in a decentralized way. There's not many really decentralized. Thor chain is one example.
00:31:56.244 - 00:32:42.174, Speaker C: It's the most complicated but awesome bridges I've seen before. Chad did a great job on doing all of this building for keeping it decentralized. But now sometimes you'll have, okay, we've connected the two, but there's a master key or some bookkeeper or vault or guardian, various flavors, and then that has a weakness, and now you have a central source of liquidity is just going to be stolen. So it's just like escalating privileges like poly network is that way, and many others. So it's really complicated to implement logic on both sides of the bridge that are fully functional without creating gaps. It's complexity is enemy security. It's a very common term here.
00:32:42.174 - 00:32:48.454, Speaker C: And bridges are complex and there's a lot of value targets. So people spend a lot of time researching how to break them.
00:32:48.534 - 00:33:07.754, Speaker B: This is. I'm probably going to embarrass myself with this question here, so bear with me for, bear with me here. So my understanding of a bridge. So let's say I want to move ETH, I want to move bitcoin to avalanche using the avalanche bridge. I'm going to put bitcoin into a contract. They're going to turn it into, they're going to basically take that. They're going to give me a one to one equivalent of, like.
00:33:07.754 - 00:33:14.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know what they call it, though. Like, a BT. They call. They have a different name for their bitcoin.
00:33:14.594 - 00:33:16.202, Speaker C: It's a derivative. It's a derivative.
00:33:16.258 - 00:33:51.534, Speaker B: Yeah. But it's basically a synthetic, one of those bitcoin that now is able to operate on. On the, on the avalanche network. And I see the issue here, which is like, okay, well, you're leaving a bunch of bitcoin in this contract, and that's usually, like, the honey pot. My question, again, this might be really dumb, is, like, I leave crypto in contracts all the time. Like, I leave crypto in a contract on Aave, or, like, I leave my, like, ETH in a metamask, or I leave my, like, ETH on compound and that doesn't get hacked. So, like, why is this bridge, why is that smart contract on a bridge such a hackable zone?
00:33:52.234 - 00:34:43.226, Speaker C: Because when you leave it there, are you leaving, you know, millions and millions of dollars? I don't know how rich you are, but that's it, the thing. And it's more simple. Like, if you're just sending it to a wallet or your own contract or your own, like, ledger or something on chain, it's, you know, transfer, withdrawal, send, you know, pretty simple functionality with bridges. I'll use my favorite one, the poly network one that was, that that was on there. Polynetwork was $611 million that was stolen. And it's. There's, there's so many functions in that to make it work, to mint the tokens, to update the bridge admins or bookkeepers, to send transactions with commands.
00:34:43.226 - 00:35:36.394, Speaker C: It'll take a message and parse the message out and say, okay, I don't speak your language, Solana, so I'm going to send you a text, string a, parse it, and when it arrives on the other side, it'll be in a format that you know how to process. So that's really, like, there's so many different, like, variations that people have tried, and, you know, there's always unexpected flaws with that. You know, this one happens to be, you know, a hash collision. So, you know, the same function that exists when one place collided with another one. Somebody figured it out and they, you know, pretty much escalated their privileges to become the bridge themselves, which was novel, never seen before. So it's just new technology, new vulnerabilities, and high value at stake.
00:35:37.894 - 00:36:19.728, Speaker A: I will also say, too, like, we're all used to working very fast in this space. Ave has been around for what, three, four years now? Maybe a little bit longer. There's this concept called security through obscurity. Just because it hasn't been hacked yet doesn't mean that it's capable of being hacked in the future. There still needs to be more time and so on put into this. Look, you say that your funds are safe in Aave. I wouldn't call it a hack, but it looks like someone exploited one of the vaults or so on Aave and was able to take out, what, like, maybe like, maybe like 500k or something like that?
00:36:19.776 - 00:36:20.120, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:20.192 - 00:36:58.420, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's like there's still, like, we're still in the pioneering stages of all this. And when code equals money, and when your money is theoretically locked up in these contracts, they're only, as, you know, the other thing that we say is like, you're only as strong as your weakest line of code. So all it takes is one upgrade and one, and one systematic upgrade, like an upgrade on Aave. But then that affects this other thing systematically that no one else has thought about. That's actually the once again, going full circle goes to the concept of systematic risk that actually is involved with having your money on Aavet.
00:36:58.612 - 00:37:44.428, Speaker C: And here's another thing, too, to touch on your example of having a bitcoin and then a wrapped version or synthetic version of that. So when you do this, the only way to redeem it, or you're essentially making it an IOU, saying, like, I'm going to use this representation of this here you have essentially double the amount in two environments. Just, you can't do something with one on one side. If something happens to that bridge and you can't cash in your IOU, then what? You know, you're stuck with a synthetic that's like, you know, worthless. And on the other side, it's just locked in the. In the blockchain or stolen. And now it's.
00:37:44.428 - 00:38:14.186, Speaker C: It's either you have double money or you have nothing. So that's where, like, the, the synthetic part of the. The world is just very, very risky. And this, we saw this again, they talked about earlier, the. The financial crisis. Back then, you had complex financial models like mortgage backed securities and CDO's and synthetic assets, like swaps and options contracts. And you had leverage.
00:38:14.186 - 00:38:57.548, Speaker C: You had volatile collateral with loans that were being to high risk people. And Defi. You see that again, we have complicated financial models with staking and APY. You have synthetic assets, like wrapped assets and liquid staking assets. You have leverage, like even more ridiculous leverage than we've seen and way higher APY expectations on that. And when it all unwinds, when there's an issue that all that over leverage and people try to get out through the bridge or redeem it, it just can lock up, you have everybody's trying to rush for exit door at the same time. And the windows like that small.
00:38:57.726 - 00:38:58.032, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:58.048 - 00:39:02.200, Speaker A: And this is all, I mean, this has all happened in recent memory. I mean, with the FTX stuff.
00:39:02.272 - 00:39:02.672, Speaker C: What was it?
00:39:02.688 - 00:39:43.534, Speaker A: Was it, please don't quote me here, but I believe it's something like Solette bitcoin or like something on the bitcoin derivative on Solana, you know, completely de pegged and was completely like, you know, really me, really worthless. But then also when the wormhole hack happened, none of the Ethereum derivatives on none of the synthetic ethereum that was sitting on the Solana blockchain was backed by anything in that moment as well. So even in recent memory and recent history, we see pretty large scale versions of it, that the industry then comes in like it's then the centralized world that has to come in and like, all right, no, actually, here's all the Ethereum back. It's actually worth something now.
00:39:44.594 - 00:40:20.352, Speaker C: And the amount of liquidity is small in comparison to things like. So allegedly, I don't know for sure. Nobody knows for sure, really. Like gold, for example, trading gold, like if you trade gold like GLD or something on the stock market. And yeah, you're supposed to own gold, but you don't really own the gold. And if everybody at once said, I want my real gold, I'm cashing in my GLD IOU, is there enough gold in Fort Knox to give that to everybody, or is there more? And can they control price with that by making it. I don't.
00:40:20.352 - 00:40:32.136, Speaker C: Speculation, you never know. But it's the same thing as doing it. You're hoping that there's enough collateral available to provide in times of crisis, and that's what leads to the cost usually.
00:40:32.320 - 00:41:11.664, Speaker B: All right, so let me get back to this poly network hack, actually, because I think it's so my understanding of it was you had the ETH cross chain, these two really high performant smart, or I think you had the two smart contracts. One was like ETH cross chain manager and ETH cross chain data. The ETH crosschain manager was an owner of ETH cross chain data and therefore could execute these privilege functions inside of the ETH cross chain data. I think I'm getting that right. And then there was another issue, which was there's this field is like the method field. Yeah. Basically it was set as user defined, so therefore it could be set at will.
00:41:12.804 - 00:41:41.254, Speaker C: Yep. User input. Yeah, user input. It's just like web applications. When you provide or take in user input, you have to make sure it's sanitized and is not. Format code injection is a big thing in web two hacking or SQL injection, you're inserting user is inputting SQL code where it shouldn't be to control the inside of the application. That's what that method was there, the user input method.
00:41:41.254 - 00:42:16.930, Speaker C: What happened was there was ethereum does something called hashing and it'll hash a function call. So what it does, it just takes a small amount of data and the hacker was able to find a collision with that input to point it to that function that should have not been able to be executed or accessed. And that's what that it was put Con, I think put epoch Con, pub bytes or whatever. That was the name which then demands.
00:42:16.962 - 00:43:13.514, Speaker B: The attackers public key to be registered as the keepers. And, okay, basically what I'm trying to get at here is less of like, how did this poly network hack happen? But when I see this, I'm like, again, it just feels like there's whack a mole and like one. So one thing that's really cool is that DeFi, has it gone like, okay, all these c five platforms are down and everyone's like, you know, like, you know the narrative. And even I say this is like, well, look, what operated really well is like, is DeFi went really well. And on the leverage side of things, Defi's got like, there are two, like on the leverage side of things, on the, on the capital markets front, DeFi has gone really well. I know, Rob, you were mentioning Ave, but like that's pretty minuscule problem that they had, I'd say, in comparison to some of these c five platforms, like the block buys and celsiuses of the world. But when I read about Polly and what happened here, I'm like, man, there are just an infinite number of ways that this stuff could go wrong.
00:43:13.514 - 00:43:36.342, Speaker B: So yes, hypothetically, I could move all of my capital from, if I'm a regular user, from blockfi to aave. But there is no possible way, if I'm a user, to make sure that this public key injection of code doesn't happen. So I don't know, just like that's.
00:43:36.358 - 00:43:47.214, Speaker C: Why we're here for like trying to find edge cases. You know, it's like there, it's such new technology, there's so many ways of doing it. Like we haven't found, like the best practice, like the best bridge standard for.
00:43:47.294 - 00:44:32.172, Speaker A: And there, and there needs to, there needs to be a substantial. So look like web two security, regular cybersecurity, just regular run the mill cyber security. There are over 4 million unfilled positions around the world. There is a drastic need for fantastic and just general cybersecurity practitioners in web3 and in web two. So, like, like you have the bull market moment of everyone running fast, but then the only real security practitioners are, like, checking on their smart contracts, and that's it. Whereas what we just got done talking about is way more complex than one smart contract audit is going to get you.
00:44:32.308 - 00:44:58.178, Speaker B: So in. When you go public, when you're a public company and when you become public, you have to go through all these, like, you basically go through all of these checks. So, like, you have to get, you have to register with the SEC, like, you have to. You now have a security, you have to get audited. You have to report quarterly financials, you have earnings, you have to, you have an s one when you go public, all that kind of stuff. Right. Do you think that we end up living in a world where once your TVL.
00:44:58.178 - 00:45:22.644, Speaker B: I know TVL is a bad metric, but, like, once your TVL reaches 100 million, you have to basically, like, you have to do a certain set of things. Or do you think this will basically be completely user defined where if I'm so, like, aave and compound are competing. Aave has all these. Basically, Aave works with Halborn. Aave uses serif, like, all these things, then, like, the user's just going to end up picking aave. How do you think this ends up looking?
00:45:23.544 - 00:46:12.086, Speaker A: My personal opinion on the matter is that the three of us right now are Americans. And I have this. I keep noticing that there's this huge tendency of us Americans to just think about America centric. And when you have a DeFi protocol that touches every aspect of the world, it's going to be very, very, it is going to be a game of whack a mole of, like, all of the different jurisdictions are going to have their different kind of regulations that they start throwing into the mix. It's really just going to be on us as a community to kind of come together and create standards. And if there is some sort of standardization, and frankly, that tends to happen in the form of the market just working its way out. And, like, we're still very, it's like we're very early.
00:46:12.086 - 00:46:53.544, Speaker A: This is still early days in general. And over the next decade, hopefully the community has enough bruises on its face to realize that, hey, we should probably be asking this of a DeFi protocol. We should probably be asking this. And the more that we can come together to create standards together, the less the regulators are going to be able to kind of do guesswork like that. Now, that being said, as an american, I do actually hope that regulators can kind of get their heads around some of this and pass some form of good regulation. That being said, I'm extremely reluctant. Like, you know, Steve and I, we all deal with it all the time.
00:46:53.544 - 00:47:00.176, Speaker A: Like they're just trying to wrap their heads around bitcoin still. So it's very. It's very. It's going to be very, very difficult.
00:47:00.360 - 00:48:19.392, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the standards and regulations and policies, you know, you think of this three different things. I think standards is going to be the best thing for code security. In like, a global perspective where you have IeE right now, they make standards, like, everybody adopted certain the way a 20 volts plug works, or like the UPC barcode that, you know, bluetooth versus HD DVD, like, which one becomes, like, the most used, and people kind of gravitate towards so we could build defi standards. And Openzepp is a great company that made some smart contract standards that are used as templates and built out, and they've been vetted and they've been used and trusted and tested. There could always be risks in that as well as the future. But when we have standard approach to security from that whole defense in depth, again, from the code standards of the language, the proper use, the role based access controls, the way to separate maybe value at risk from user inputs and all the way out to proper distribution of the environment. So controls around defi composability.
00:48:19.392 - 00:48:42.894, Speaker C: So with Aave, like, lending and borrowing, what are they relying on? Are they distributing their oracles price feeds to be diverse enough so it can't be controlled and manipulated by one? Those are standard kind of like thought patterns and code patterns and practices that are still kind of being defined because we're in the very beginning stages of this development.
00:48:44.034 - 00:48:50.894, Speaker B: You guys see a bunch of different languages and ecosystems. What is your take on solidity versus other languages?
00:48:51.634 - 00:49:09.094, Speaker C: I think it's. Oh, yeah, I think it's been successful because it's the community. It's very easy to understand code. There's tons of tools to support it, and it's just grown because of the tools available to learn and to adopt it.
00:49:10.194 - 00:49:11.494, Speaker B: Rob, were you gonna say that?
00:49:11.834 - 00:50:07.248, Speaker A: Just ultimately, that we admittedly so, are typically reactive in that sense. We let the market sort of decide what, what smart contract language or coding is really taking off. But for us, we saw rust really starting to take over a lot of the sort of emerging protocols as well. And so, I mean, without a doubt, all the metrics will show you that solidity is still kind of here to stay and king now, but there's no reason why in the near future that couldn't be rust or. And funny enough, Steve and I are tracking governments around the world with their CBDC initiatives, and we're seeing that a lot of that's being built in c. So we'll see. But we're pretty clear on we want to be able to still specialize.
00:50:07.248 - 00:50:22.962, Speaker A: And so there are plenty of protocols and languages that, like the entity of Halborn, like, won't touch. And like, so we just. We just are, like, really important. It's really important that we just focus and focus on what we're best at.
00:50:23.098 - 00:51:06.928, Speaker C: Yeah, and, like, ethereum, like, solidity took off because you can do EVM in many different languages. You know, there's Viper, there's Yule, there's fe. Solidity just happens to be the one that people gravitated towards because of the, you know, the robust tool set. Do it. And it's hard to get started with development for this when you're a coder coming in, even if you're technical, you go research things and you kind of start using things like remix and brownie and so on and so on. It's tough to get going, but once you learn it, you don't want to let go. You want to keep on doing that because you're good at it and you understand it.
00:51:06.928 - 00:51:45.634, Speaker C: I think that's just the one that's been kind of like, led the race and is pretty here to stay for EVM, actually, we have. Zion is an operating system that Halbourne made to solve that problem, too, get people started with blockchain. It's a free operating system that we give it to our own employees to get ramped up pretty quick. Has all the tools, all the frameworks for Rust and for Golang and solidity, things to, like out of the box. You don't have to worry about, like, figuring it out and making the libraries work together. So Zion, Z I I O N. It's like a Kali Linux for those security testers out there.
00:51:45.634 - 00:51:48.394, Speaker C: It's a great. I use it every day.
00:51:48.854 - 00:52:24.280, Speaker B: We released an episode with Anatoly and Ben Spreno at Solana last week. And obviously, they've had a ton of success not building with solidity and with Rust and stuff like that. Do you think that there's too much momentum, though, behind solidity and too much? Like, basically, there's two approaches. And if you look at the two l one s that had really, really big 2021s, it was Solana and Avalanche, and they took two really different approaches. Right. Which approach, do you think? Like, when we look back in five years, I'm assuming you work with either one or both of them. So I'm not sure how much you can say.
00:52:24.280 - 00:52:29.804, Speaker B: But, like, when we look back in five years, who do you think will come out as having taken the better approach?
00:52:31.064 - 00:52:52.354, Speaker C: I'll say I think, you know, with blockchain in general, there's not. You don't need to have only one chain to rule them all. There's a lot of purposes that one chain can be better than the other. Like, Solana is extremely fast. It uses only rust, and it doesn't have smart contracts. It has programs. Everything is compiled and lives on chain.
00:52:52.354 - 00:53:13.684, Speaker C: There's not two layers. There's no consensus layer and contract layer. It's all together in one, and it's extremely fast. And rust is a fast language because you compile it and then you deploy it. That's not how solidity is done. Usually it's bytecode. And avalanche has c chain and p chain, and they have different things, too.
00:53:13.684 - 00:53:33.074, Speaker C: Salon is one chain. So if you want something fast, maybe for, let's just say, like, decentralized streaming of video need high throughput. Okay. Salon is a great chain for that. If you want to do something for. All right, I want to use NFT marketplace. I want to interact my front end app with it.
00:53:33.074 - 00:53:58.248, Speaker C: Easy to have new contract. Maybe avalanche is better for that, too, because you can use p chain and c chain for it. So I think there is a multipurpose, multi chain world. Bitcoin has its own unique property of one trick pony transfer, store value. So I think they both have a lot of potential. We do work with both, and they're different tools for different jobs.
00:53:58.416 - 00:54:41.324, Speaker B: I want to get both your essays take on this next question. There's a big conversation right now happening, which is, what's the best way to scale? And I think the three ways that people are talking about would be roll ups, roll ups on ETH. Second way would be bridges between different l one s. Like, we have a couple different l one s in the future, and there are bridges between the different ecosystems. And then the next way would be IBC and, like, app chains and what's going on with cosmos? And those are kind of the three places that, like, people are planting their flag. Maybe it's not like, how do we scale, but just like three different ways that this industry grows. Rob, can I throw this one to you? First of, just like, when you think about those three ways to grow the industry, which one seems like the best option these days.
00:54:44.464 - 00:55:55.104, Speaker A: At this moment? I mean, we just got done talking about bridges and how absolutely frightened we are as security practitioners with them. So the systemic risk involved with bridges, I think, could actually lead to more people losing money and therefore walking away from web3 in total. So I don't think that interchange, you know, like multi chain or cross chain bridges, are going to be the way that we scale. In general, scaling solutions will help, but also fundamentally creating layer ones from the ground up that interact with one another and fundamentally creating new protocols that interact with one another will inevitably succeed. And that is why I'm certainly bullish on everything IBC and cosmos that I keep on seeing. And there's a lot of choice there as well. So you can choose whether or not you implement cosmos smart contracts within your IBC chain and so on.
00:55:55.104 - 00:56:42.448, Speaker A: But also because of what we were just talking about with how Ethereum has really taken over this whole idea of decentralized applications right now, this is why people keep on talking about L2 scaling solutions, and now we're starting to hear about layer three scaling solutions and so on. And I think it's going to keep getting meta in that sense. But I also think that due to just Moore's law, I think we're in for a blockchain disruption in the next five years. I think there's something that isn't out yet that no one's talking about yet, that's probably just going to supersede all this and take, take the world by storm. It's basically what I'm hoping for at this point.
00:56:42.616 - 00:56:44.032, Speaker B: Say more, say what you mean by.
00:56:44.048 - 00:57:26.454, Speaker C: That new technology that's not one of those three that can solve it in a better way for speed. Scalability. Yeah, you look at the trifecta I really like. Vitalik talked about that blockchain, trifecta, trita, trilemma, trifecta, scalability, centralization and security. You know, you kind of like trade one versus the other depending on where you fall with it. My take on those three solutions, I agree with Rob the bridges, probably like my least favorite. I mean, I say that, you know, I like them because they do create a lot of business for Halbourne.
00:57:26.454 - 00:58:23.382, Speaker C: So they're great in that sense. But as far as usability, I really like zero knowledge proofs, zero knowledge roll ups, and optimistic roll ups. I think if you find a way to use lightning for bitcoin, or a L2, that can take the off chain computational resources and do it in a decentralized, secure way to make validity proofs, you can scale really well if that's done, because it's using cryptography, which is the whole point of crypto, is the crypto part. So, cryptographic assurance, I think, is always the most sound for everything. That's why I fell in love with bitcoin in the beginning. But application specific blockchains, like IBC, and what they're doing, it's a different approach. They're essentially doing it at layer one, the way Ethereum does smart contract composability.
00:58:23.382 - 00:58:57.150, Speaker C: You're making composable, application specific, like layers in the blockchain stack, so each part can be forked and improved, and each part can do without losing the compatibility. So it's microservices in a way, for blockchains. And you're adding the simplicity, which is great for security. This blockchain does only this. You're not trying to morph it into something more complicated to interact and force interaction like a bridge. You're just saying, okay, you do this, you do this. And that's great.
00:58:57.150 - 00:59:26.314, Speaker C: Now, if there's something wrong with that, you're containing the blast radius again. So you're doing this microservices way of it. I think if you want to go the cryptographic route, zero knowledge, really like that tech, we see tons of emergence there. Application specific blockchain, it's great. But the speed, size of it. I mean, the whole reason why they're trying to do L2 anyways, it's just like the execution speed, right? You know, imagine playing a game like on Ethereum without L2. It's like swing your sword transaction, mining.
00:59:26.314 - 00:59:37.494, Speaker C: And it's like, okay, and I have to pay like $5 every time I make an action. You need like a L2. You need like the ronin network or something to do that.
00:59:38.234 - 00:59:53.554, Speaker B: So you guys are both. You guys both think that something is coming in five years, and a new blockchain or something five years from now, that will be better than ETH, Solana, avalanche, Cosmos, all that stuff. Yeah. You both agree better at what.
00:59:55.334 - 00:59:55.910, Speaker C: Just.
00:59:56.022 - 01:00:02.834, Speaker B: I mean, is more secure, solves the trilemma better than anyone else has been able to.
01:00:03.414 - 01:00:28.652, Speaker C: I think that. Yeah, I think that I think there will be either an evolution of something that exists now into, you know, like Ethereum just went to proof of stake for whatever, whether you view that as an improvement or not improvement, but they are changing. So it could be one of the existing ones that have emerged and been morphed into something much better and improved.
01:00:28.708 - 01:00:52.488, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know if you guys can answer this, and this is one, obviously, I don't even have to say this at this point, but this is not financial advice. How do you, if you like, that's a thesis I haven't really heard, heard many other folks say on the show. Usually people are like, oh, I love cosmos, or like, oh, like, I'm all in on ETH. Like, how do you guys allocate your personal capital if the thesis is that what the space currently looks like today, like, none of these are going to.
01:00:52.496 - 01:01:01.924, Speaker C: Be the long term solutions, personal capital and crypto. I like bitcoin, so. And Monero.
01:01:02.344 - 01:01:05.204, Speaker B: That's what happens when you see too much, too many hacks.
01:01:06.254 - 01:01:35.864, Speaker A: I was going to say, when you sit in our seats and you see kind of like the really ugly version of everything and just really, like, how risky things are, and then there's like, the war rooms that we get pulled into that no one else ever, like, really hears about or knows about where learn about this. That's why, like, on a personal level, and even like, halbourne, treasury related, like, like, we don't, we don't touch anything. Like, we are exceptionally risk averse in that sense. But you, on a personal level, Steve and I are certainly both bitcoin maxis in that sense.
01:01:37.644 - 01:01:43.420, Speaker B: Were you always like that, or did working closely in Defi make you. Make you not want to touch Defi?
01:01:43.572 - 01:01:55.584, Speaker A: I interact with it a bunch. I'm a big NFT collector with Ethereum, and I interact with Defi plenty. But I'm not going to say that it's a sizable amount of my personal savings.
01:01:56.564 - 01:02:13.418, Speaker C: I personally, I am. There's. There's like some, some token utility. Thing is, there's like a real use for it. I think I'll be. I'll be bullish on it, but I. What I'm not bullish on is when you do anything that goes against the, like, the principles of why blockchain exists.
01:02:13.418 - 01:02:25.594, Speaker C: Like self custody, self access. Like, I. I personally don't like to put it into, like, essential, like, entities. Like, what's. What's the point of even doing defi if you take the d out?
01:02:26.054 - 01:02:46.294, Speaker A: Yeah, but I also take it. So that's definitely that perspective. And then again, not financial advice, but, like, my personal perspective on investing in the space will always be like, is there a real business model? Is there a real way for this thing to actually make money? And if it's just a speculative asset pump, it's like, there's no way I'm touching it.
01:02:46.374 - 01:02:51.662, Speaker B: So you guys don't own much ETH. You're all in on bitcoin changes a lot?
01:02:51.798 - 01:02:57.726, Speaker C: No, I say all in. You know, I get comic books, too. I got gold, real gold, like a dragon.
01:02:57.870 - 01:03:04.470, Speaker A: I very, very diversified. But as far as Halbourne is concerned, we don't touch any of that.
01:03:04.622 - 01:03:07.270, Speaker C: Yeah, well, yeah, we don't have a token yourself either.
01:03:07.422 - 01:03:32.944, Speaker B: I would say there's a. There's defi and then there's, like, tier one defi, which is, like, maker Aave, compound, uniswap, like the Defi from, like, the 2016, 2017 era. Do you think, like, will you touch, like, if you want to get a loan on your ETH or something and you don't want to sell your ETH? Like, will you touch a nave or compound? Or, like, if you want to trade, like, will you touch uniswap or you're staying away?
01:03:34.524 - 01:03:54.434, Speaker C: We do some. I like uniswap. I think it's probably the best smart contract in Defi that when it changed the game for doing things, for swapping. But, yeah, it depends. Are you investing in the idea, the hype, the protocol? Do you believe in it? I think there's a lot of great.
01:03:55.614 - 01:04:03.670, Speaker B: I'm not saying investing, I'm not saying go buying Aave's token or something. I'm saying, will you go take a loan? Let's say you have 100.
01:04:03.782 - 01:04:09.826, Speaker C: I would liquidate more on Aave. I would be the liquidator if I want to do something. Yeah.
01:04:09.850 - 01:04:34.874, Speaker A: But we interact. I mean, let me be clear. We both, Steve and I, personally, as well as Halbourne, we do interact with Ethereum, defi, Solana, defi, on a constant basis, you know, because sometimes we're paid in, like, a USDC, you know, something, or sometimes we'll get paid in a token something, and we'll go and we'll swap it for sure. But, you know, so we're interacting.
01:04:34.914 - 01:04:35.400, Speaker B: We're.
01:04:35.522 - 01:04:45.452, Speaker A: It's important that we are users of the technology that we're. That we're trying to understand. You know, the best way to break something is to understand how to build it and take it apart.
01:04:45.508 - 01:04:45.772, Speaker B: Right?
01:04:45.828 - 01:04:49.064, Speaker A: So we. We do that pretty consistent, consistently.
01:04:50.804 - 01:05:21.604, Speaker C: So, yeah, I used to like that for me, I was doing a lot of, like, liquidity, providing, like, you know, putting it in pool pairs and pools in your swap and doing that. I think that's one of the. This. The more safer ways with the exposing yourself to opportunity and liquidity mining, you know, I don't know that some of that can be. It's like, what is your. How many layers deep are you in access to your money? That's, like, what always scares me is, like, if it takes more than, like, four transactions to recover the funds, then, okay, I'm in too deep.
01:05:21.904 - 01:05:35.702, Speaker B: We were doing. I was doing some real d gen stuff. In 2021, it was like, you'd go, like, on this avalanche protocol, and it was like, all right, you got to move it here to here, here to here. Bridge back over to ETH. I'm like, oh, my God. It's taking me, like, six days now. Yeah.
01:05:35.758 - 01:06:16.460, Speaker C: Yeah. That's the scary part of it all. And it's like, you know, when you look at. And when you know what you know about security and you look at how many layers, like, if you're doing investment on a, like, a cross chain liquid staking something, and, you know, it's like, okay, I have my ETH, and then I put the ETH in a contract, and it mints a raft ETH, and I take the wrapped ETH, and I put it in a bridge vault, and that'll make a wrapped soul ETH on one side. And then I take that, and I put it in defi protocol to do some yield farming on, like, whatever. Like, you know, new defi things. Like, all right, now I'm like, I'm a six contract vulnerabilities, possibilities, and a bridge between, like, my.
01:06:16.460 - 01:06:21.284, Speaker C: My core redeemable asset now. You know? So it's like, that's. That's pretty. Pretty dangerous.
01:06:21.864 - 01:06:38.168, Speaker B: You lined me up nicely, Stephen, for the last topic I want to talk about, which is liquid staking, I would have to assume you guys do not. Are not fans of liquid staking, based on everything that we've talked about. But if I'm right about that, Stephen, tell me about your thoughts on liquid staking. Let's start there.
01:06:38.256 - 01:07:13.794, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I believe in, you know, like, the true value of things, and you're. When you do liquid staking, you're essentially, like, kind of cheating away, right? You have what is proof of stake supposed to be. It's like you lock your value in the network to help consensus, and that's your sacrifice for the network is like, I will put this in here, and I'll stake it and I won't take it out. And that's going to, like, what makes me validate the network. Just like bitcoin is like, you're providing your electricity power when you do liquid staking.
01:07:13.794 - 01:07:36.774, Speaker C: You're like, you're bypassing that. That sacrifice doesn't exist anymore. You're like, okay, well, I'll put it there. But, hey, guess what? I'll still go use this synthetic acid to do whatever I want with it. So I'm not a fan of liquid staking. I think that it creates, when it happens for too long, for too much, it creates issues like we've seen with just recently with some platforms.
01:07:37.234 - 01:07:38.374, Speaker B: Rob, what do you think?
01:07:38.794 - 01:08:11.754, Speaker A: I have some less. Yeah, I mean, Steve puts it way more eloquently than I would, but it's, liquid staking is kind of a grift in that sense. It's really not supposed to be the case that you're allowed to do that now because it's code. And because any of us have access to write some lines of code and create a synthetic version of this asset that's staked, that capability will always be there. But it's, you know, it's a grift. You're not supposed to be able to do that.
01:08:11.874 - 01:08:30.174, Speaker B: So do you put liquid. Do you put. There are like, two camps of liquid staking. There's like the. I would say, like, the more centralized providers of liquid staking, and then there's like, the more decentralized providers of liquid staking. Do you put both of those in the same bucket? Like, you don't like Lido, for example?
01:08:31.954 - 01:09:01.536, Speaker C: Centralized liquid staking would be, do you trust the people to be honest with you, or is it going to be what we're witnessing now with SFX, if they're true to their redemption, they're saying, hey, you're liquid staking. Your ETH is safe with us. It's one to one. We're not going to do anything with it. And then they start doing a bunch of stuff with it. That's the risk of centralized. That's, you know, it can be issue.
01:09:01.536 - 01:09:07.856, Speaker C: And also the amount of liquidity, too, because you can do this in, like, traditional financial markets is like, yeah, it's.
01:09:07.880 - 01:09:08.928, Speaker A: All, that's all they do, right?
01:09:08.976 - 01:09:09.616, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:09:09.640 - 01:09:40.909, Speaker C: Have your money in the bank and then take a line of credit against the cash that you have in the bank to use for things. And you have, like, a margin ratio. You have, like, a certain thing, and, and that, people do that a lot. I do that and you. But you're trusting in the large, you know, liquidity of the US dollar or whatever, fiat. And it's audited and regulated a lot more, and it happens a lot slower. The vulnerabilities are not within the code.
01:09:40.909 - 01:10:18.492, Speaker C: The vulnerabilities come within the economy or government policy. So it's a bit more nuanced. And I would say it's safer. So if you can put controls around liquid staking to make it more safe, I would say, dare I say, regulate a little bit more, but then you're not decentralized anymore. So I think we have seen the very bad use of non regulation just here recently with us, with SFX coming here. So that's what gets you in trouble.
01:10:18.618 - 01:10:24.804, Speaker B: Yeah. Anything else that we miss, guys? No.
01:10:27.344 - 01:10:28.924, Speaker C: I could talk all night if you want.
01:10:30.824 - 01:10:34.284, Speaker B: Stephen. I hope people are watching on YouTube so they could see your insane setup.
01:10:36.064 - 01:10:41.080, Speaker C: Yeah. If you guys are watching here, this is. Yeah, this is how I diversify my investment.
01:10:41.232 - 01:10:53.760, Speaker B: How did. You were a guitarist in a band, right? And then you became this, like, CTO of a cybersecurity company. Was that. Were you a. Were you a. Were those. Did those happen at the same time or you were a, like.
01:10:53.760 - 01:10:57.024, Speaker B: How did you learn how to code like this when you were also a guitarist in a band?
01:10:57.144 - 01:11:22.592, Speaker C: I think it's like the one side of the brain, you know, music. To me, I listen to music. I enjoy it, but it's like a math problem in a way. I listen like crazy time signatures, and I like complicated stuff, and I look at audio, you know, for. So engineering, you know, I actually. I play guitar, but I like producing. I like creating music is more like, you know, recording and making.
01:11:22.592 - 01:11:38.284, Speaker C: Making songs from it. And I think that it's still in front of a computer. Doing. Doing stuff with an application comes down to it. But how I got into it was just, I suck at sports, and I wanted to play guitar to be cool in elementary school.
01:11:38.694 - 01:11:41.182, Speaker B: There you go. It's about as good of a reason as any.
01:11:41.318 - 01:11:56.038, Speaker A: Steve's being super humble. All right, so he used to be signed to Capitol Records. He's opened up for a ton of major bands like Metallica and Bon Jovi. He's written songs for Britney Spears. He's written songs for Lil Wayne. And while he was doing that, he.
01:11:56.086 - 01:12:00.646, Speaker B: There's a record 500,000. Oh, there's that Britney Spears song.
01:12:00.750 - 01:12:04.434, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then that's my old band.
01:12:04.854 - 01:12:06.406, Speaker B: 5 million streams. Wow.
01:12:06.470 - 01:12:08.714, Speaker C: Actually, I have nine, so I'm waiting to get the double platinum.
01:12:10.374 - 01:12:11.154, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:11.774 - 01:12:32.742, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean, Steve and I, that's why we got along so well, is I'm a way less accomplished musician. And, like, we just look at start, you know, we just look at building out the Halbourne, like, building, like, the best rock band or the best, you know, album possible. It's creative all day, every day. We have new challenges every day, and it's just, you know, it's a lot.
01:12:32.758 - 01:12:48.414, Speaker C: Of fun working on a project right now called Dead Code. Haven't released things yet, but the long term thing is to make it an immersive, kind of web3 integrated music project. So I'll leave it at that for now.
01:12:48.534 - 01:13:04.470, Speaker B: Here we go. All right, well, I'm excited to see anyways, Stephen and Rob. This was awesome. I appreciate you guys coming on. I know Santi who wasn't able to join this, and I talk about security side of things all the time, and we're like, if only we could have some security experts on the show. So this was it. Super helpful.
01:13:04.470 - 01:13:06.782, Speaker B: I learned a ton, and, yeah. Appreciate you guys coming on.
01:13:06.958 - 01:13:08.254, Speaker C: Great. Thanks for having us.
01:13:08.334 - 01:13:09.118, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
01:13:09.166 - 01:13:09.878, Speaker C: Appreciate it.
01:13:09.966 - 01:13:10.454, Speaker B: Of course, guys.
