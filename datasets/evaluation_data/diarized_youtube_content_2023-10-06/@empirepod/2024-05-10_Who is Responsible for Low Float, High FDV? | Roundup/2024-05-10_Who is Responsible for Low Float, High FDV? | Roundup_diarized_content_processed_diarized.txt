00:00:00.360 - 00:00:22.354, Speaker A: Fast forward to two years from now. Two and a half, three years from now. What are we going to be saying about this particular moment in time? It was so obvious, right? We had an ETF, like, why are you overthinking it, man? You had the most defining moment of the industry to legitimize this asset class. You have a president that is a presidential candidate that is talking about, like, crypto has become presidential now.

00:02:28.384 - 00:02:37.244, Speaker A: I'm in New York. I emailed Yan. I'm like, I'm ready to go. Like, I'm excited about this. He's like, can we delay for an hour? I'm like, God. Anyways, I'm nervous.
00:02:38.024 - 00:02:39.392, Speaker B: How's the network trip?
00:02:39.568 - 00:02:42.444, Speaker A: That was great. Really, really productive.
00:02:43.144 - 00:02:44.364, Speaker B: What are you doing here?
00:02:46.064 - 00:02:50.346, Speaker A: Nothing, man, I just came to see you. Like, do I need another reason to be here?
00:02:50.480 - 00:02:51.154, Speaker B: Likely.
00:02:52.894 - 00:03:26.944, Speaker A: No, I had to be in Mexico for I'm the godfather of my best friend's son. And so I was here, I got invited to be at the Solana office yesterday to talk to the cohort of apps like founders, startups that are there. I can talk about that. Really exciting. But it also. Yeah, I've been caught up with Ben from parafy, Mike Dudas from six man Ventures, a bunch of teams that are here. We're obviously hosting the meetup today, Thursday.
00:03:26.944 - 00:03:30.296, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, new York's great. It's my favorite city in the world.
00:03:30.440 - 00:03:33.724, Speaker B: Nice. Why don't you live here if it's your favorite city?
00:03:35.584 - 00:03:48.374, Speaker A: Because I've lived here before. I've lived here for six years, so I like coming here for like a month or two at a time. Like I'm always here in the summer and then I come for the marathon. It's just, you know, I like where I live now.
00:03:48.494 - 00:04:01.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Fair. Yeah, dude, I mean, we get like twelve days a year that are like this week, I feel like with the, you know, 72, sunny and then it's just fucked.
00:04:03.774 - 00:04:13.634, Speaker A: Yeah, look, if I were to ever come back, I would. Or just move, it'd be New York for sure. Yeah. Feels like a second home to me.
00:04:13.794 - 00:04:14.954, Speaker B: I went to the Knicks game last.
00:04:14.994 - 00:04:17.610, Speaker A: Night, which I was gonna go, dude.
00:04:17.682 - 00:04:23.538, Speaker B: I went, yeah, what a game are you, when do you leave town? We should go to game five if they, if they, if the pace.
00:04:23.586 - 00:04:32.386, Speaker A: Well, that's next Tuesday. Yeah, no, I leave, I think I leave Sunday. But they've been, wow, it was popping.
00:04:32.450 - 00:04:41.818, Speaker B: It was crazy, man. It was like, ah, they were down ten and then they came back and Brunson got injured and they came back. So, yeah, it's cool.
00:04:41.866 - 00:04:45.294, Speaker A: I mean, when was the last time the Knicks, like, were playing good?
00:04:46.274 - 00:04:55.666, Speaker B: Couldn't tell you. Couldn't. I'm more of a football and baseball fan. I don't follow basketball that closely, honestly. But like, I love, it's my favorite sport to go to in person. I just get fired up in person.
00:04:55.770 - 00:05:05.978, Speaker A: Mine is hockey and then basketball. Monaco has a good basketball team, but yeah, I bought like this shirt. Like there's this brand that I like, New York or nowhere.
00:05:06.026 - 00:05:07.666, Speaker B: Monaco has a good basketball team.
00:05:07.730 - 00:05:20.094, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, they're european champions. A lot, a lot of like retired us players end up going to Monaco. But I bought this. This is a New York NOAA brand. They have the new Nick's version. I bought a shirt.
00:05:20.134 - 00:05:20.966, Speaker B: They did a collab.
00:05:21.110 - 00:05:23.326, Speaker A: Fired up watching the game in my hotel room.
00:05:23.350 - 00:05:32.126, Speaker B: Put the shirt on. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. They did it as a cool collab. There were so my. Actually, my wife looked. I went to the game with my wife, and she looked at me last night.
00:05:32.126 - 00:05:39.594, Speaker B: She's like, I think New York or nowhere is not cool anymore, because there's all these, like, banker bros wearing New Yorker nowhere. She's like, I think that brand is out.
00:05:41.294 - 00:05:42.710, Speaker A: Okay, I'm gonna return it.
00:05:42.822 - 00:05:44.174, Speaker B: Yeah. So just a heads up.
00:05:44.214 - 00:05:44.406, Speaker A: That's.
00:05:44.430 - 00:05:47.734, Speaker B: That's the fashion insight from my advice from. From my wife.
00:05:47.774 - 00:05:53.754, Speaker A: What is it? Like, sporty and rich is now, like, the thing that's. That was cool. Like, six months ago.
00:05:54.174 - 00:05:55.926, Speaker B: That's cool at the US Open now.
00:05:56.070 - 00:06:07.286, Speaker A: That's right. I sympathize. It's like the attention span of crypto is like that of a fire, like a, you know, of a fruit fly. And, like, I think the same is true for brands.
00:06:07.390 - 00:06:14.474, Speaker B: I was talking to Alex from Nansen last night, the founder of Nansen, and we both kind of were just like.
00:06:15.774 - 00:06:26.958, Speaker A: Nansen for content data intelligence company. They like mine. Like, they'll like surface insights if you want to understand. Who's the person fund behind the wallet. They're pretty good at it.
00:06:27.046 - 00:06:59.206, Speaker B: Yeah, we were just talking about how, like, this. It's a very weird cycle right now. It's a very. So, in the last couple of cycles, basically the firing gun was shot for the cycle. So, like, all of 2017 was just like a ripper of a bull market. March 2020, Covid hits March, black Thursday happens. And then prices, obviously, prices crash.
00:06:59.206 - 00:07:38.622, Speaker B: And then I think from, like, that, from, like, a week after that, especially starting when, like, you could probably say the firing gun was, like, Paul Tudor Jones calling bitcoin the fastest horse in the race. I think that was around May of 2020. It was just a ripper of a bull market for a year and a half. And this cycles felt very odd because there hasn't really been, like, a firing gun. I would say there's probably the bitcoin ETF stuff in December and, like, leading into. In December, leading into the new year and then into January is like, boom, bull markets back. And now there's this, like, consolidation choppiness that I think is making some people, like, a little uncomfortable.
00:07:38.622 - 00:07:47.070, Speaker B: But I'd be curious how. How you think about that, because I can share how I feel about it from the operator's perspective. But like, from someone who's seen many cycles from the investors perspective.
00:07:47.222 - 00:08:35.498, Speaker A: Let's talk about it. Look, I'm. I think there's this phenomenon where the mind plays tricks on you. Looking back on the prior cycles, it looks like it was a ripper. In the moment, it doesn't feel like a ripper as much throughout 20, 212-020-2021 cycle. Paul Tudor Jones I would have thought compound liquidity mining was more like also a very defining moment of the cycle where like kickstarted Defi summer, then you had renaissance of nfts because you had the wealth effect of, you know, Wifi and all that stuff. But in the midst of, during that moment, I'm trying to think like it wasn't, like it never feels obvious.
00:08:35.498 - 00:09:21.384, Speaker A: You're always on the edge, you always have PTSD, you're like Covid. And then, you know, people now looking back will say, well, yeah, you know, there's a huge liquidity injection. People had time, they were in their homes. We fit this narrative as to why the cycle happened. We look at the data and it all fits really nicely. But you still had drawdowns, at least five to ten drawdowns of 1015, 20% of these assets. And in that moment, a lot of people were questioning how long the cycle would last, how sustainable it was, how other things might impact it.
00:09:21.384 - 00:09:53.396, Speaker A: And look on the margin. This, I would agree with you, is a little choppy. It's a bit like have and have not. And you're also exhibiting, seeing that in traditional markets, right, you have, the returns in the s and P have been concentrated in a set of, there's a magnificent seven or whatever, and everything else has been muted. It's very much a have and have not. The return disparity is also in crypto been pretty noticeable. ETH has oscillated in a very tight range.
00:09:53.396 - 00:10:39.074, Speaker A: It hasn't done anything really. Bitcoin is certainly rally because of the ETF, as you said. And then you've had Solana, which has been front and center in just the price action and ordinal activity and whatever. But I don't know, maybe the question is perhaps more interesting is fast forward to two years from now, two and a half, three years from now. What are we going to be saying about this particular moment in time? It was so obvious we had an ETF. Why are you overthinking it, man? You had the most defining moment of the industry to legitimize this asset class. You have a president that is a presidential candidate that is talking about like, crypto has become presidential now.
00:10:39.074 - 00:11:07.442, Speaker A: It is a, for, like, the ETF moment is a defining moment, perhaps the most impactful of this industry, because it legitimizes the asset class. People can buy it through their retirement accounts, the type of buyer, you know what I mean? Like, that might be the thing that we look back and like, why the hell did I overthink that? I should have just bid, gone play basketball and chilled? Because this is a secular trend and like, don't try to play cute, man.
00:11:07.498 - 00:11:10.134, Speaker B: Oh, the life of an investor. Sounds nice.
00:11:10.474 - 00:11:57.306, Speaker A: No, I'm saying, but like, it doesn't sound, it's not easy, right? Because sitting on your hands and doing nothing, and I tweeted about this last week or like a couple days ago, is extremely hard. It doesn't get easier because you have the opportunity cost, you have the ability to invest in a number of things, different asset classes, you make more money. The aperture of the things you can invest in also goes up, like, and so it's not easy to sit on your hands, right. And I just think that I put it differently. I've had, there was a podcast that we recorded where I was visibly stressed about that morning, like selling a position in with, for instance. And we went through it and I didn't do anything. And I was just on the flight here.
00:11:57.306 - 00:12:43.204, Speaker A: I was thinking about, look, there have been specific moments over the last couple of months where ive wanted to make drastic changes to the portfolio because of macro, because of crypto, because of price action. When price does x, you kind of. But im constantly now going back, what is the core thesis, my core thesis cycle and its X Solana is the most retail friendly chain, its the most advanced. Therefore, memes will do well, like I'm doing other stuff, but on the margin. And I was talking to Ben about this, like at parafy, we got one thing extremely right. We were early in Defi, we owned it. We, anytime there was like a company that wanted to raise money in Defi, they called us.
00:12:43.204 - 00:13:16.656, Speaker A: We were top of the list and we owned it and we went hard at it and we were early. We did many other things. But when you think about maybe in your portfolio, too, and I'll stop talking, is I think going back, you have to get one or two things very, very right in investing. And I'm not talking about time. It could be, but you know what I mean? What is the thing that you're going to get extremely right this cycle or in the next couple of years beyond, like what you're doing in blockworks.
00:13:16.680 - 00:13:16.912, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:16.968 - 00:13:27.274, Speaker A: Like, from an investing standpoint, what is it? I have one that I continue to go back and doing it in size.
00:13:30.174 - 00:13:39.114, Speaker B: I would guess, for you, your two things, you could get everything wrong this cycle, but your two things are meme coins and Solana, I would guess.
00:13:39.854 - 00:14:06.846, Speaker A: Yes. Well, specifically Solana. I am of the mind that Solana should. Like, I don't see a compelling reason, and I haven't from teams or investors, as to why Solana should not be at parity with Ethereum. That's the. That for me. And again, none of this is whatever, advice or whatever, but that's my thesis.
00:14:06.950 - 00:14:07.542, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:07.678 - 00:14:29.430, Speaker A: And I keep hammering it. I was yesterday at the salon offices, I'm like, every time I talk to a team, I'm like, what do you get building an XY network that you can't get in Solana? I'm monitoring fire dancer and their progress there. I'm monitoring the spam issue. I'm like, I'm very focused on that. I'm doing other investments, of course. I'm interested in other ecosystems. Of course.
00:14:29.430 - 00:14:49.126, Speaker A: It also feeds. I'm paying attention to aptos. We just had them on the pod. I'm paying attention to why? Because it also influences and monad, like, these things influence my thesis and so on. And I will invest there. I'll hedge part of it. But that's just the thing that I have the most conviction on.
00:14:49.126 - 00:15:13.804, Speaker A: Like, that's the thing that I'm most focused on. And it does take a lot of time. Like, not doing anything doesn't mean, like, stop, just pencil down, you know, go travel and do shit. No, it's like, constantly, like, revisit the thesis. Like, when the Solana spam issue happened, how many people did you talk? And they're like, game over. Like, look at Bates. Like, shit works.
00:15:13.804 - 00:15:35.544, Speaker A: You're like, I agree. Let's give it a couple weeks to see how the devs come together. And, like, you had a herculean effort from the Solana Geeto and the rest of a bunch of other teams, and you're like, holy shit. Like, that's actually came more bullish out of that incident than. Than before, you know? So I don't know. What is the thing that you're trying to get right?
00:15:36.484 - 00:15:56.048, Speaker B: I mean, for me, it's just, like, extreme focus at blockworks right now. Like, I told you, I messaged you this week, you sent me a really good deal, and I was just like, I'm going to pass on this. I need to. I'm basically stopping most angel investing. I'm not really trading around the portfolio at all. I'm just like, I'm 100% focused on blockworks right now, I think. I don't know.
00:15:56.048 - 00:16:29.876, Speaker B: I was talking to some couple founders recently, and they're really chasing this restaking narrative, and they're not restaking companies at all. They have nothing to do with restaking. And they're like, yeah. Like, a lot of them are like, we think we're going to try to grab a piece of the restaking market. And, like, I don't know. You've got Eigen layer launching, and I don't know, I just, like, don't like that strategy at all because I don't know. If you bring up what you mentioned about parafy, it's like, parafy probably lost a bunch of deals in gaming, or they lost deals in NFT.
00:16:30.020 - 00:16:34.564, Speaker A: I brought, like, illuvium seat around a parafy, and Ben was like, you know, game is not a thing.
00:16:34.684 - 00:16:58.964, Speaker B: And I act and I think. I think I remember you guys passed on axie. I'm pretty sure, too, but which, like, sucks. But also, I understand the decision to pass on that, because if you did it, if you did all of them, you're just a general. You're a generalist fund. And the way to build something when you're just kicking off is like, I think you want to own one thing. And that's how I think about it at block works is like, there are.
00:16:58.964 - 00:17:31.570, Speaker B: There's going to be a huge wave of retail that ends up coming into crypto in this cycle, probably, let's say, back half of this year, maybe more likely into 2025. We get the ETH, ETF narrative, whatever, second half of the cycle, we will not dominate that game. Like, that is coindesk, cointelegraph, bank lists. Like, I will give, like, I will cede all of those retail people to them because, like, I want to own the crypto native audience. I want to own the information stack for crypto native. So, like, that is what I'm. What I'm 100% locked into right now.
00:17:31.602 - 00:17:42.334, Speaker A: But, yeah, I want to pick your brain because you recently acquired Nathaniel's podcast. Yeah, I've been on that podcast. He's been in the space for a while. Like, what was the thesis there? I'm just curious if you're willing to share.
00:17:42.714 - 00:18:02.728, Speaker B: There's. There's three elements of this. There's the personal element. There's the very, like, um, so the per. The. I'll talk about the breakdown, specifically, like, the breakdown podcast, and the asset, and then it'll, I'll zoom out into the broader block work strategy and how I think about media. So the breakdown is solving this issue where I don't think that there's a really good daily crypto podcast.
00:18:02.728 - 00:18:34.842, Speaker B: If you look at all the best crypto podcasts, whether it's block work shows like Empire, Lightspeed, Xerox Research, um, on the margin, like thousand x, I'm going to get in trouble, because I'm sure I'm forgetting some. Like, they are Xerox research. Like, they're these. They're usually like twice a week, you've got an interview show, and then you've got a roundup at the, at the end of the, at the end of the week. Ford guidance, same thing. Other, even other shows, bankless, on the brink, I don't know other crypto. They all follow the same format.
00:18:34.842 - 00:19:09.884, Speaker B: I really believe that there needs to be a daily crypto show where it's like, you wake up, you're on your 15 minutes subway, you're commuting to work. It's just like, what are the two news stories that you need to know? Nathaniel's the only one who's been able to nail this. It's six days a week. He's done it for years. It's got kind of this, like, Lindy, effective podcast where it's been around for a while, and it has a, it really drastically increases the size of our podcast network. So it kind of does a couple things for us because it's a massive show, because it's been around for so long. It gives us more advertising capabilities so we can go to different advertisers.
00:19:09.884 - 00:19:39.744, Speaker B: Some of the big players, some of the big players, like the Krakens and ledgers of the world. Like, they have such big marketing spends that even if something like Bell Curve is really good content, they need to deploy big budgets. It's like being a billion dollar fund versus $10 million fund. Even if there's a good opportunity, you need to deploy in size. So the breakdown is kind of like, gives us that inventory. The second thing is it gives us distribution for other shows. It opens the door to other channels at blockworks.
00:19:39.744 - 00:20:00.576, Speaker B: So it will be like this big daily podcast, and then we can drive into Empire or Bell Curve, whatever, and then it gives us the ability to create more talent at blockworks. So we'll start. So Nathaniel's going to keep posting it, but we could bring on a reporter. We could bring on Byron, the newsletter writer. We could. And you can start elevating different talent.
00:20:00.640 - 00:20:07.004, Speaker A: Yeah, theoretically. Like, Byron writes a newsletter daily. He could. There's no reason why I couldn't do it.
00:20:07.424 - 00:20:16.096, Speaker B: So this is the plan. So the. So the daily newsletter of block works and the breakdown will end up becoming the same brand? Yeah, that's exactly.
00:20:16.200 - 00:20:21.464, Speaker A: This is. This is the. The only newsletter I read Daily Byron's. Yeah, he's good.
00:20:21.584 - 00:20:22.800, Speaker B: Let's go. That's great.
00:20:22.912 - 00:20:23.584, Speaker A: It's great.
00:20:23.704 - 00:20:52.100, Speaker B: The malavine of crypto, baby. Yeah, I think it's the best daily, daily newsletter in crypto right now. So the breakdown and the daily newsletter will. Will become one and the same. Maybe the daily newsletter will end up becoming the breakdown by blockworks or something like the branding will end up being the same. Byron will start going on the show more. And that gets me to like the broader block work strategy, where if you look at media is, media is dying, like, media is dying, as we, like, traditional media is dying.
00:20:52.100 - 00:21:14.744, Speaker B: And there's only two media types of media companies that are going to end up working. There's like a couple of the biggest players, like the New York Times. They'll actually end up working like their business model. Even though people on crypto Twitter hate them. They're one of the most successful media companies in the world today. They've done an amazing job pivoting away from display ads on their website into products. And then there's very traditional b, two b.
00:21:14.744 - 00:21:40.938, Speaker B: Not traditional, but b, two b, digital media companies. So this is how I think about blockworks is not b, two c, very b, two b. I only care about, like, crypto professionals and crypto natives. The problem is, once you scale big enough, you start creating more and more generalized content. And then you sit in this messy middle of media, and the messy middle kills you. Vox vice, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post. Like, you're not big enough to compete with social media.
00:21:40.938 - 00:22:10.578, Speaker B: You're not small enough to have a niche audience. You're screwed. So what blockworks is going to end up turning into is essentially a house of brands. And when you see our podcast, like Lightspeed, Xerox Research, Bell Curve, like, the long term goal for these is like, they're not just podcasts, they're brands that we're building. And you're going to have these, like, die hard communities and, like, cult. Like, we have like, a cult following around lightspeed. We have, like, I don't know, we have like, a kind of a cult following around empire.
00:22:10.578 - 00:22:14.410, Speaker B: When you go in person, you see these people. They like, they just love empire. These will turn out.
00:22:14.442 - 00:22:17.174, Speaker A: How many people are showing up to the event today.
00:22:18.274 - 00:22:56.794, Speaker B: I mean, we've got like, we tweeted out one link one time and we've got, I think we'll have like two, like 200 registered. So that's like one link, one time and I don't know, probably got, could have gotten like over a thousand if we really pushed this thing. So eventually all of our podcasts will get newsletters and then they'll all get in person activations as well. So kind of giving away a little bit of the secret sauce here. But like you'll have, let's say a light speed podcast, a lightspeed newsletter, and then like a light speed stage at the permissionless conference. That's an example of what it could look like. So the daily newsletter of Blockworks was missing a podcast and that's where the breakdown slots in.
00:22:57.374 - 00:22:58.390, Speaker A: That's nice.
00:22:58.582 - 00:23:01.414, Speaker B: Yeah, we're excited. 1st. 1st acquisition.
00:23:01.574 - 00:23:27.344, Speaker A: Yeah. Should we pivot to? I mean, there's been a lot of new stuff. We can talk about the emergence. There's been really interesting activity on social fi. You had pumped up fun. Fantasy has just been interesting in its own way. We obviously can talk about Trump and the comments that he made yesterday at a dinner in Mar a Lago.
00:23:27.344 - 00:23:31.144, Speaker A: I mean, there's other stuff that we can comment on.
00:23:31.484 - 00:23:53.934, Speaker B: Let's do social fi stuff. So there's probably three apps to focus on here. There's like social fi slash consumer. So this week, the context for this conversation is this week, fantasy. Two big things happened. I would say there's fantasy, which, are you an investor in fantasy? I think we're both investors. We're both investors in fantasy.
00:23:54.094 - 00:24:23.134, Speaker A: I love the, love those guys. I mean, they're just electric as a double click here, I'll pause. Yesterday I was talking to the founders as a cohort of founders in Solana, and I was like, I talk very specifically of things that I look for in a founder because it's a people business you're investing in early stage, their ability. And I ended up passing in founders that don't speak fast and both the pump fun and the fantasy guys, both of them speak at lightning speed. And I was like, okay, yes, sign me up. I'll invest on that basis.
00:24:24.714 - 00:25:16.076, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I met them at the Alliance Dao. I went and gave this talk to the alliance Dao cohort and met them and they're electric. So friend Tech launched their token and did their Airdrop fantasy top, which is like you can essentially gamble or bet. I don't know the right word to use here, but you can bet on your different, on different creators on crypto Twitter. They basically went live and a bunch of people started betting on different crypto Twitter influencers or people, whatever you want to call it, and then pump fun, I think. Did they launch their token and they launched like a chat and social feed to see what your friends are trading? I didn't follow pump fun as closely, but anyways, a bunch of big stuff happened. I remember last summer when friend tech was launching and I was talking a lot about it.
00:25:16.076 - 00:25:27.984, Speaker B: You were pretty anti friendtech, I think is fair to say. I never got, yeah, you never got on it. I'd just be curious to get your take on updated thoughts around social fi about a year later.
00:25:28.344 - 00:26:05.444, Speaker A: Yeah, I had this great discussion with a few folks yesterday, including Ben and Mike about it. I'm not dismissive of the category. I think there's nuance to it. Friendtech is extremely close to, it's like you saw with the airdrop. You had big name accounts dumping small airdrop amounts. You're like one. Maybe you're not as you're larping, as, you know, generational crypto wealth, but like, you're dumping $12,000 airdrop on, it's like, what are you doing, man? Like, you mean like it actually is.
00:26:05.444 - 00:26:43.858, Speaker A: I would argue that the benefit of doing that, it's like, it doesn't, if you're that wealthy, doesn't compete in your wealth, then why are you doing. Because it's hurting your reputation. It's very confusing to see, actually, these big Twitter accounts do that. And it goes back to my initial skepticism with something like, French is there is this component where sometimes you do things without expecting anything in return, financial return. And I appreciate crypto as an area where we're trying to financialize everything, see what sticks. This is an area where I feel extremely strong about we shouldn't be doing it. I don't want to understand.
00:26:43.858 - 00:26:59.650, Speaker A: If you're buying my token and then selling it creates a very weird, awkward relationship. You would argue, well, what's the difference between fantasy, these cards, right? I have a card that represents, it's like the World cup. You're collecting these cards.
00:26:59.762 - 00:27:06.654, Speaker B: I would argue that, and I would argue, as someone who's been very pro meme coins of just like, let the market do what the market's gonna do.
00:27:07.314 - 00:27:26.686, Speaker A: Yeah, true. Although it just feels really, it feels very direct and personal with friends. It doesn't feel as direct, personal a step remove a fantasy. It's fun. And maybe it's just this idea that there's like, this image and the card.
00:27:26.790 - 00:27:27.950, Speaker B: I think it's the trading.
00:27:28.102 - 00:27:52.264, Speaker A: Trading card that makes it very related. Like, just. And I don't know how to explain it other than it feels less in your face. I think that if someone sells my card and is trading it, then I'm like, yeah, that's fine. If someone's, like, dumping my key, I'm like, yo, man, what's up? Like, are we friends? Like, what's going on? Like, yeah. Did you appreciate that or am I.
00:27:52.344 - 00:28:12.232, Speaker B: I know what you're saying. I mean, one is very purely just like, it feels like a game. Fantasy feels like a game friend. I think the other thing with Friendtech is, which I'm still on friendech and stuff, and still, like, sometimes, occasionally there. But like, you have. You basically then have to put out for your key holders by. Because there's this chat feature.
00:28:12.232 - 00:28:15.618, Speaker B: So there's. Because there's utility baked into buying the key.
00:28:15.816 - 00:28:16.462, Speaker A: Great point.
00:28:16.518 - 00:28:22.414, Speaker B: You know, then it makes it like, I don't want to put out for you guys. No, no, I don't want to.
00:28:22.494 - 00:28:32.478, Speaker A: So I've basically, you've gotten yourself into a situation where all of a sudden you're, like, created another job for yourself.
00:28:32.566 - 00:28:49.314, Speaker B: And to be fair, you might DM's after this. I'll send you a screenshot. It is probably at this point, 50, maybe, maybe 75, maybe 100 DM's of people being like, why didn't you tweet this weekend? I bought your fantasy card. So. Yeah, like, I bought your fantasy card. Why didn't you tweet this weekend?
00:28:51.334 - 00:28:52.110, Speaker A: I was like.
00:28:52.222 - 00:28:57.462, Speaker B: I was like, dude. I'm like, I took the weekend off of Twitter. I'm sorry. I didn't respond to that.
00:28:57.478 - 00:29:33.914, Speaker A: I was at my buddy's baptism in Mexico, and in the weekend, over the weekend, I was like, I wake up and I'm like, what have I done wrong? I don't have DM's open, but people are like, this guy's not tweeting. It sucks. And I pinged the fantasy guys at Travis. I said, yo, man, did I do something wrong here? No, I just. Tom Schmidt apparently has, like, this rubric of, like, best practices for fantasy influenza or whatever. I don't know. It's.
00:29:33.914 - 00:29:39.694, Speaker A: I don't know. It just feels different. It's more fun.
00:29:40.314 - 00:29:42.618, Speaker B: So let's talk about maybe.
00:29:42.706 - 00:29:44.274, Speaker A: Well, on this point, though.
00:29:44.354 - 00:29:44.730, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:44.802 - 00:30:12.314, Speaker A: What is. The last thing I want to say is, it's interesting also in the sense that they're in three different ecosystems. Right. You have fantasy on blast. You have Frentech on base and you have a pump fun on Solana, right? Yep. And that in and of itself, I think will be a really interesting experiment as how things unfold.
00:30:13.574 - 00:30:56.358, Speaker B: Here's the big takeaway I think, to have there is, this is the first time in history we've seen these breakout consumer apps have this. I think it might have been Chow who was talking about this, have this big impact on the chain that they're built on. Right. So if you think about base, base was nothing until friend tech brought a ton of it wasn't farcaster that brought all those users to base in the early days, it was friendtech then blast, like, blast was just a bunch of like crazy speculative stuff until fantasy, like brought. Now fantasy is probably the biggest driver of users to blast, I would assume. And then Solana. Solana is already very like diverse ecosystem, but pump fun, you could, you could argue, made a pretty big impact here in the last couple of months as well.
00:30:56.358 - 00:31:25.404, Speaker B: So I think you're going to start to see these chains like you remember in the last cycle, chains were really fighting to get like Starbucks and Nike and you had some of these like ridiculous, like $10 million deals to get those people on. Those people realize doesn't those don't make a difference. Obviously, people realize those don't make any sort of impact. No shit. But there's going to be like all out fights, I think, to get these world class developers and founders to come build on your chain because that's where the impact matters.
00:31:25.904 - 00:31:29.244, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It'll be really interesting.
00:31:29.664 - 00:32:03.066, Speaker B: Okay, here's, here's, I got the data. Shout out Ali Zak, who is at Pantera. It's been one week since the launch of fantasy. In that time, the platforms onboarded 33 and a half thousand new addresses seen over eight and a half thousand eth in trading volume. For reference, during Frentex first week, it onboarded 27,000 new addresses. So fantasy has already added 33 and a half thousand new addresses. And then I saw the some folks in the slack blockwork slack channel were commenting about the fees that were generated.
00:32:03.066 - 00:32:16.094, Speaker B: In the last seven days. Fantasies generated over 9 million in fees. Friend text generated 5 million in fees and pumped up funds over 3 million in fees. These are real dollars for startups.
00:32:17.384 - 00:32:18.760, Speaker A: Quite a lot, actually.
00:32:18.912 - 00:32:19.644, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:20.224 - 00:33:03.612, Speaker A: We'll see if we can run rate those figures into, you know, for the rest of the year. But because, you know, Forentech, I'm curious to get your thoughts of someone who was on it early, you know, with the airdrop and everything. And v two and the team, it's had sort of its ups and downs, but like, out of all three, like, or like, which one are you most bullish on? Which one? You know, updated thoughts. And Friendtech, like you said, you kind of are. It sounds like the frequency of you using it is slightly lower. And maybe throw in forecaster into that equation too. I appreciate it's like a bit more generalized, but like, you're also, I think you're one of the most active in the category.
00:33:03.612 - 00:33:05.716, Speaker A: So. Yeah, maybe throw in.
00:33:05.900 - 00:33:25.928, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so let me, let me maybe explain to you how I view. So there's like friend tech, fantasy. Farcaster, our head of marketing was asking me about lens yesterday. I bucket those in two different categories. So there's like Friendtech and fantasy. Those are a lot of the users there, people who view crypto as just this speculative asset.
00:33:25.928 - 00:33:49.364, Speaker B: That's a thing to gamble on. And my take on why those are taking off right now. So if you think about it, Friendtech took off during peak of the bear market. It was, I think, summer 2023. We were just like super chop. Like things were slowly starting to come back. And I don't think it's any sort of surprise that fantasy launched during this weird, choppy consolidation period.
00:33:49.364 - 00:34:40.503, Speaker B: I think the friend texts and fantasies are going to do really well when people just need to get their inner gambler out, basically. Then there's this other group of people who really like this. It's more the Andreessen cohort of, like, we have these web two monopolies and we're breaking down those barriers. And that's where you need to build these censorship resistant protocols that enable you to control your own data and build a competitor to Twitter. That's the bucket where I see Farcaster and lens and things like that. The group number two oftentimes views group number one as negative to the industry. And group number one says that group number two doesn't like misses, misses the forest for the trees, and like, it's all just speculation all the way down.
00:34:40.503 - 00:34:52.111, Speaker B: But both of them, I think are, those are very negative takes on the other group. And it's. I think that they're both doing great things for the industry and like, both very value added. I just think they're like two very different groups, actually.
00:34:52.207 - 00:35:50.448, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And actually, before we move on to other things, there's. There's this recurring discussion that is percolating in front and center, polarizing in crypto right now that I'd like to just address quickly, which is this idea of high fdv, low float coins and why people are interested in meme coins. And to your point, I was reminded of that because of what you just said, which is there's a camp of people that are very critical and dismissive of meme coins and there's others that are complaining as the reaction of the community is where we're tired and fed up of these protocols that launch at high ftvs, low flow. It's like down only. And I just think I've seen the most crypto twitter has terrible takes always. But like, in this particular area, it is you constantly see people that try to come out ahead with specific narratives that are just factually incorrect.
00:35:50.448 - 00:36:15.184, Speaker A: I'll give you an example. Someone says, oh, you know, it's the fault of VC's. I'm like, no, it's not. It's a fault of teams that come out with a high valuation. I'm like, wait a minute, do you understand market dynamics? It's not like the team sets the price, the market sets the price for the token, idiot. Oh, yeah, but market makers, I'm like, you think the team controls, like, what the token does? It's like it's actually really challenging. Like you, of course, you need to have market makers in the mix.
00:36:15.184 - 00:36:18.040, Speaker A: Like, obviously, like this is look at traditional market.
00:36:18.192 - 00:36:22.644, Speaker B: Whose fault are you saying that it is for the low float, high ftv stuff? And what are your thoughts?
00:36:23.244 - 00:37:11.964, Speaker A: It's like, it's just the thing of the market. It's like you can't. Two examples, Solana and Ethereum. Ethereum did an ICO at a time where it benefited because there was no precedent and you just could got away with it, so to speak, on the regular, you couldn't do that in today's environment. After Ethereum did the ICO and after you had the wave of icos, you can't do an IC like your lawyer would scream at you, right? And so unfortunately, projects like Solana and then every other project right now has to raise from venture funds and do it in a way where it's like equity with a token warrant. And that's kind of the best model that lawyers have kind of agreed on given the current regulatory environment. In a perfect world, probably, yeah.
00:37:11.964 - 00:38:18.786, Speaker A: Do an ICO, right, allow people in the community to invest, distribute token that would allow greater distribution of tokens. But at the same time, investors, VC's and teams don't own much of the tokens, right? And they carve out a big part to the community to decentralize in large part, but also to compensate people for participating in the network, for taking smart contract risk, because that's a core principle of crypto, which is you make your participants owners in the network in a more equitable matter. Fine, I get it. But it's like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place here. And in large part it's because of regulatory ambiguity. And if we can update credit investor rules, then maybe, hopefully we can get to a place where you can bring in the community and participants earlier and then therefore have a token that is more distributed out of the gate and the float is higher. But it's kind of like you can't control that.
00:38:18.786 - 00:38:32.466, Speaker A: And so I would just caution people when you hear these people talk about, so VC's fault. It's like, no, man, VC's take a lot of risk. Early stage. That's. That's the nature of the game. There always will be a place for VC's. Now, can community members become VC's? Absolutely.
00:38:32.466 - 00:38:58.918, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. But, you know, it's challenging. So, yeah, I don't know. Every cycle there's always this idea of like, VC's are evil and whatnot. I'm like, as someone who is an investor, I'm like, fuck off. We take a lot of risk. Not everyone is created equal, but, you know, people, a lot of times the influencers that are commenting on this are guys that are butthurt because they didn't get allocation in deals.
00:38:58.918 - 00:39:00.470, Speaker A: And that's the reality of things.
00:39:00.622 - 00:39:05.804, Speaker B: You've got the wrong brand for yourself. You can't call yourself a VC. It's got to be institutional angels. That's the.
00:39:06.704 - 00:39:14.244, Speaker A: By the way, no one's ever. I'm an institutional angel. I don't write your 25k checks. No, I'm like a fund, but I'm an angel too.
00:39:15.344 - 00:39:17.328, Speaker B: That's a better brand for you, Santi.
00:39:17.496 - 00:39:24.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I've seen it all over the timeline. You're seeing this. This is why we hate FTV coins. I'm like, I get it.
00:39:26.104 - 00:40:00.454, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by, say, se's belief about the world, I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world. Agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what say has done with their V two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today, they've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 million milliseconds.
00:40:00.454 - 00:40:38.008, Speaker B: What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest EVM L two s on the market today. Save V two is now live on public Devnet with mainnet scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with, say on X at say network Sei Network big things to say. This episode is brought to you by Aura Online. Crime is growing at an alarming rate, and cyber criminals continue to find crypto investors like the empire community lucrative targets.

00:41:06.266 - 00:41:35.924, Speaker B: Check them out. Aura.com blockworks free 14 day trial hey everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of Empire. Marinade is a staking protocol in Solana. I remember when they launched, I think it was back at a Solana hackathon and they were funded with this 80k grant. It's super cool to see how far they've come. They're the only stake pool today that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards, and automatic downside protection.
00:41:35.924 - 00:42:15.682, Speaker B: With their new protected staking rewards, you can stake natively or liquid stake with marinade and get the same high performance delegation strategy that thousands are using already to stake your soul to over 100 of the best Solana validators. Marinade has been live for over two years and they have audits completed by four of the top security firms in crypto. The delegation strategy is a first of its kind. So if you're staking your Solana, if you want to start staking your Solana, if you want to get some yield from your soul, start staking today with marinade, go hit the link in the show notes. Big thanks to Marinade for everything that they've done in Solana staking land. Go check them out. Go stake your Solana with marinade today, everyone.
00:42:15.682 - 00:42:57.658, Speaker B: Jason here. I know you've been hearing a lot about the intersection of crypto and AI, and that's why I'm really excited to share our newest partner and sponsored empire, Skale, a high performance modular blockchain that's revolutionizing gaming and AI. With zero fees and instant finality, Skale's unique architecture allows for massive scalability and has already saved users over 6 billion in gas fees. The five main takeaways that you need to know for 10 gas fees. Two, Skale has instant finality and lack of mev. Three, the zero gas fee model of scale is really important for blockchain gaming adoption as gamers don't have to pay transaction costs or have the SKL token. Four, scale is multi chain.
00:42:57.658 - 00:43:26.582, Speaker B: This design allows for nodes to be combined to create chains and for individual sub nodes to actually be removed and relocated, which creates greater security and collusion resistance. And five, Skale has become a really good fit for AI dapps because they're fast, automated zero fee transactions. Big thank you to scale for sponsoring Empire. We're excited to partner with you guys. Bridge over to scale. If you're listening to this at scale space forward slash ecosystem, follow the journey along with scale on x. At scale network.
00:43:26.582 - 00:43:57.642, Speaker B: That's at scale network. Big thanks again to scale for sponsoring empire. Yeah, I mean, there's another half that's calling out the operators for launching at these high fdv low flow tokens. My, there's a, there's, there's a couple things going on. There's an overbear, there's a, there's the SEC, the SEC, let's like the SEC is basically restricting the ability for startups to raise capital and distribute tokens. The whole reason that there's like, I saw a bunch of people commenting this week about like the points meta. So stupid.
00:43:57.642 - 00:44:24.712, Speaker B: Like points, points are forced on points are being forced on operators and founders. Because the SEC is tell is if, if you are a company and you give tokens to someone in exchange for dollars, you are fucked. There is no way around it. You are screwed. So what you have to do is go points, points, airdrop based on these points like points give and then I.
00:44:24.728 - 00:44:28.176, Speaker A: Work at that point is sufficiently decentralized in some capacity and you know, you.
00:44:28.200 - 00:44:34.248, Speaker B: Further, it's like obviously this points thing is dumb, but like I don't have time.
00:44:34.296 - 00:44:36.244, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think it is some ways.
00:44:37.144 - 00:45:07.294, Speaker B: Well, I think I, here's here's why I think it's dumb. Tokens used to be about incentivizing early users, right? The thought was like, and I really did believe this was like the early users of Uber. This is like the common example. Like the early users of Uber should get, should benefit in the same way. And like uniswap, right? Like, who did Uniswap give their tokens to? Like is the early users of Uniswap. Like, is the liquidity providers. And that was awesome.
00:45:07.294 - 00:45:36.264, Speaker B: Okay, so step one of tokens was like, well, first off, it was about raising capital with these tokens. But then moving beyond that, it was about incentivizing early users. Then it became a customer acquisition game. It was like, we don't need to incentivize these early users. Let's use tokens to acquire new users. And now what we've moved to is stage three where they're now an investor acquisition game. So we've gone from using tokens to incentivize early users to customer acquisition game, to investor acquisition game.
00:45:36.264 - 00:46:03.628, Speaker B: And it's causing these, like, there's a lot of reasons. There's a lot of reasons for it, but like, there's the overbearing regulator with the SEC. There's a lack of new entrants in retail people. Like, we can look at some coin, Coinbase had earnings. Like, there's some really interesting data around retail people we could pull up, or lack of retail people, I guess I should say. But then there's, there's this overabundance of VC capital and it is leading to there. It's no one's fault.
00:46:03.628 - 00:46:04.508, Speaker B: It's no one's fault.
00:46:04.596 - 00:46:12.532, Speaker A: The operator's fault in the day. Have agency, no one's forcing you to buy world coin at 100 billion FTV is not a meme.
00:46:12.628 - 00:46:14.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not saying that.
00:46:14.292 - 00:46:26.420, Speaker A: Look at the stats. No, no, I understand that. Look at the stats and make a decision for you. That's also, I mean, that's the last thing I'll say at this point. You know. Yeah, it is a challenge. You know, I, in a perfect world, absolutely.
00:46:26.420 - 00:47:08.084, Speaker A: Let's bring in, let's actually, instead of airdropping 50% of people that just, you know, for the sake of it, no, allow them to invest because I think a lot of them may want to invest, put skin in the game, have a lockup for a year. Yeah. You know, and so I'm all for that. It's just, it requires, you know, new updated accredit investor laws and whatever. When we get there. Well, you know, I don't think anyone disagrees with the idea that we should update those rules, not just in, but outside as well. Then the other thing, I wrote a piece now on AI, and I've been talking about, like, a lot of deep end projects, which has, like, led me to this realization, which is tied to this.
00:47:08.084 - 00:47:43.544, Speaker A: I've heard a term that I want to share in the podcast because it's so nice. I think it's called participatory networks, and I think it was the founder of Geonet who referred to that in industry conferences. And I think the way I've started to explain crypto, like in New York, I've had meetings with people outside of crypto. I'm like, listen, look at networks. Networks are extremely capital intensive to this cold start problem. In order to bootstrap supply, incentivize demand, think of Uber. Right? So, so capital intensive.
00:47:43.544 - 00:49:06.728, Speaker A: And I think the key takeaway is crypto is creating a new type of mechanism to bootstrap networks in a very capital efficient way, whether it's bitcoin or deepen, and for the simple reason that the cost may be the same, but you're offloading that cost away from the company protocol into the participant, meaning the do it yourself enthusiast that is expending their own resource time, compute hardware. And so the company doesn't have to spend that capex hundreds and millions of dollars to do it themselves. And I think that if, like, I think when I've started to explain that to people, they understand networks and the capital intensity of it, and you're like, well, yeah, of course these networks are going to actually be able to get off the ground and compete against traditional networks that are very monopoly like in a credible way. And it sounds dumb and obvious, but like, yeah, when you give participants a greater incentive because they're earning part of the ownership in the network, then it's gonna work. It should work. It should displant or displace an incumbent that is not sharing that wealth equitably. So anyways, a ramble, but I wanted to share that because it's something that I've started.
00:49:06.728 - 00:49:07.644, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:09.384 - 00:49:11.124, Speaker B: Did you look at the Coinbase earnings?
00:49:11.664 - 00:49:14.484, Speaker A: I did, I did.
00:49:15.744 - 00:49:42.468, Speaker B: All right. Retail Q 420 21 177 billion in trade volume. Retail Q 120 24 56 billion. So for retail, we're only at 31.6% of all time highs. So where we're at today for the retail trading on Coinbase is 31.6% of what the retail high was for Coinbase in the last cycle.
00:49:42.468 - 00:49:59.852, Speaker B: Institutional, we're at 69% of the all time high. Right. We're at 256 billion today versus 371 billion in Q 420. 21. Really interesting data points. So institutional, we're 70% back. Retail, we're 30% back.
00:49:59.852 - 00:50:13.584, Speaker B: And that is exactly in line with what it feels like today. I would say, like, that quantifies exactly what it feels like on, on crypto Twitter today. I just. I don't know. I really. It was really interesting seeing that data.
00:50:14.284 - 00:50:41.610, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of, uh, a lot of the market participants were focusing on, like, when Coinbase reports earnings, they focus on the, like, of the last month to run rate. Right. Because to your point, like, this quarter has been a bit iffy, right. In the sense of, like, markets have cooled down a bit and so you're trying to, like, run rate earnings guidance into the, you know, into the rest of the year. Like you're looking at the last month. But, yeah, I mean, the volume in Q one was like, pretty strong.
00:50:41.610 - 00:50:46.014, Speaker A: Then it's come down a bit. Yeah. I wonder what it.
00:50:46.434 - 00:50:58.568, Speaker B: Net income is fucking insane. Let me just read these numbers for you guys. Revenue, 1.6 billion. So revenues, 1.6 billion. Net income is 1.2
00:50:58.568 - 00:51:12.304, Speaker B: billion. So revenue was up 70%. Net income was up 330%. Quarter over quarter adjusted EBITDA 1 billion. Opex, less than a billion. .9 cash.
00:51:12.304 - 00:51:22.206, Speaker B: They're sitting on 7 billion of cash. USDC on the platform doubled quarter over quarter and number of base developers is up eight x quarter over quarter.
00:51:22.350 - 00:51:25.718, Speaker A: Like, say that again. Revenue and net income 3 billion.
00:51:25.806 - 00:51:30.474, Speaker B: Revenue was 1.6 billion. Net income was 1.2 billion.
00:51:30.854 - 00:51:41.194, Speaker A: That's crazy. Yeah, I mean, run that forward. Like, what's stopping Coinbase from becoming top three financial institutions in the US and the world?
00:51:42.714 - 00:52:05.774, Speaker B: There was a chart that went around Twitter this week and I heard it on the. My first million podcast, which is like a big tech podcast. And they were talking about how everyone was talking about how Nasdaq and New York stock Exchange are these like, amazing, amazing, amazing businesses. And there was no mention of Coinbase anywhere. And I was like, guys, like, just wake up to the next biggest exchange.
00:52:06.314 - 00:52:23.474, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of wild. Obviously we saw the stripe announcement on accepting USDC. They're expanding internationally. Obviously. We've been talking about Coinbase in the pod very publicly and locally. I have a position in Coinbase, of course. And yeah, it's really impressive what they've done.
00:52:23.474 - 00:53:07.272, Speaker A: The market share growth of USDC is also quite interesting. And we're going to have Justin son later on in a couple of weeks, you're really talking about, I think, how you think about USDC's continued dominance and growth in payments and maybe with stripe kind of becoming more involved in the fold. But yeah, it's been pretty impressive. And I think the market, again, this is a name where the market just doesn't understand all the nuance and components of their business model. I remember last year and they were so focused on, oh, fees are just going to come down on retail trading fees. That spread is going to come down. They're just sort of missed.
00:53:07.272 - 00:53:08.004, Speaker A: Just.
00:53:10.144 - 00:53:17.324, Speaker B: Yeah. Santi, how do you size a position of, like, two things you're very convicted on, Solana and Coinbase.
00:53:20.184 - 00:53:21.684, Speaker A: Like, buy as much as I can.
00:53:22.744 - 00:53:44.444, Speaker B: Like, how do you know, let's say you had a hundred, let's say you had a $100. Like, and I know, I know how convicted you've been on both of those for a long time. Like, how do you allocate dollars into those two things? And, like, how do you actually, how do you actually put on that trade? Because there's obviously you could just buy Coinbase spot and Solana spot, but, like, there's different ways to play it. Like, how do you, how do you think about that?
00:53:45.104 - 00:54:34.264, Speaker A: Coinbase was different because obviously it allows you to do different things with derivatives and whatnot in a more efficient manner with options and whatnot. But Coinbase is a multi. It's a different strategy for me because that part of my portfolio outside of crypto is like relatively smaller. But I want to capture yield for the reason that I always want to have cash. So my strategy is I want to capture a lot of yield outside of crypto to then take on way more, insulate my lifestyle, and then take on way more risk. So if I'm creating a lot of cash flow that is not correlated to crypto, I will have the capital to invest in times where no one has the capital or you have dips and you have cash. And so with Coinbase, I did these, like, Phoenix notes or reverse autocall converts where, you know, I was, you know, clipping a very high coupon.
00:54:34.264 - 00:55:08.192, Speaker A: I'm talking like 30, 40%. And basically all I. All that had to happen, like, when Coinbase hit $30, my bet was like, there's pretty decent margin of safety here. Have we bottomed? Reasonably speaking? Can it go down another 20%? Maybe another 40? God, like, it just feels like a stretch. Feels like it was oversold. And the reason why I felt it was oversold is because the coupon that I was being paid because someone on the other side was probably short and whatever. They were giving me like a 45% coupon on an annual basis.
00:55:08.192 - 00:55:30.632, Speaker A: Basically, my bet was Coinbase will not go down more than 30% at that level at $30 if it goes above the strike price, which is the spot I get called. But I get called in six months. So I'm basically earning 20% in six months. Right. And you can change the callability date. Like, you could be called like every quarter.
00:55:30.768 - 00:55:31.112, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:31.168 - 00:55:58.034, Speaker A: Basically, if spot goes above the strike, you get called, but you get paid the coupon, whatever it was, right. It was a quarter, it was six months, nine months. In a best case scenario, you don't get called for the year. Coinbase doesn't go down more than 20%, but doesn't go up at the issue price. So you get paid 40% on the position. And I'm not trying to get cute on the portfolio that I have outside of crypto, right. Because I have a ton of exposure to it.
00:55:58.034 - 00:56:20.844, Speaker A: But I do want. I'm interested in earning a yield higher than treasuries. I'm taking more risk, but I understand the name. So I've done that. I've staggered it throughout the year. When Coinbase is 30, 40, 50, basically every time it got called, I would, you know, recycle recycling, you know, and the coupon is very compelling. Right? I mean, you could earn 5% on treasuries, or you can earn, you know, 2030 40% on Coinbase.
00:56:20.844 - 00:56:54.208, Speaker A: And it's a name in the worst case, where I don't get called and say, coinbase goes below 30%, I get settled in shares. I'm fine owning Coinbase down 30%, but in the meantime, I earn that coupon. Right? So in the worst case scenario or not, worst case, like Coinbase goes down below 30%, I'm happy to own it at that level, or I might even have the shares to settle it. And so for me, it was just a way to express a view on Coinbase where I didn't want to get overly cute on going, like, just uncomfortably.
00:56:54.336 - 00:56:54.696, Speaker B: Right.
00:56:54.760 - 00:57:31.062, Speaker A: But I was very. I could do that in size and earn 40% in size is pretty awesome, I think. And that cash with that coupon, I use it to reinvest into higher beta stuff. I go and buy sole spot or memes or whatever, right. But it's just the. The coupon, the yield component, the cash flowing component is always something that I've learned over multiple cycles. You always want to insulate your lifestyle and have cash flow that is allows you to not only cover living expenses, but give you the ability to invest in really high beta risky stuff.
00:57:31.062 - 00:58:22.114, Speaker A: That is startups with duration risk, with execution risk. And that for me has just been, I have a traditional portfolio that I optimize for cash flow that I then funnel everything into Sol with stuff like that. And with Sol, I mean, it's actually an interesting exercise. Obviously you can buy the spot. There's the FTX kind of estate sales that were really compelling and interesting. Again, they have higher duration, right? Because a lockup is, you know, multiple years out. If you're earning and if you have in your life cash flow component, then you don't worry too much about duration, right? You're like, I'm happy to be patient.
00:58:22.114 - 00:59:15.488, Speaker A: I'm happy to hold. So like, so differently. So the sole math was like the FTX, the state math was very interesting because the thing that it doesn't apply just to Seoul, but let's put it, I'm going to use Seoul as an example. Say Sol is sitting at 100 and you could buy for a 30% discount or whatever, say 50% discount. And you're unlocking 50% of the position in a year. So basically all you have to believe is absent staking rewards, not add complexity, is all you have to believe is if you're getting at a 50% discount and you're unlocking half of the position, all you need to believe is its sold stays at that level, right? So it stays at 100. And you're like, the question that I asked myself was, well, in what version of this world, if Sol doesn't hold 100, say it goes down to 70.
00:59:15.488 - 00:59:45.380, Speaker A: What does the rest of crypto look like? Okay, you could apply that to bitcoin too. But for some, like Sol, I do wonder, like what is the meme coins on Sol? What is ethereum do? And for me, it was my thesis that like, that's sometimes like, looking at it from that perspective for me was useful to size that position in particular. Like, well, if sold doesn't hold this level, we have bigger problem on our hands.
00:59:45.412 - 00:59:45.876, Speaker B: Votes.
00:59:45.980 - 01:00:16.290, Speaker A: Yeah, but I'm comfortable owning it for multiple years. Like in a scenario where really shit hits the fan, I want to be owning stuff that I'm comfortable holding for ten years. And the last thing, like I was talking to Ben about this, it's like this cycle different from others. I've gone extreme left, extreme right. There is things that I can't change. I've had positions in networks and startups that, you know, I'm, I'm comfortable holding. But in the liquid part, I'm shifting more towards liquid.
01:00:16.290 - 01:00:35.690, Speaker A: This part of the cycle, I'm shifting more towards just concentrated extreme left, extreme right. We had, I'll credit Joe McCann, shout out to him in November, we had him on the pod, and people should go, listen to that pod. We talked about Bonk. And the question that I asked them, you remember, it's like, all right, we're all here. Soul is going to. You're a soul bull. I get it.
01:00:35.690 - 01:00:40.118, Speaker A: Gun to your head. Do you own soul or do you own bonk? You can pick one. And he said, bonk.
01:00:40.166 - 01:00:40.470, Speaker B: Bonk.
01:00:40.502 - 01:00:50.794, Speaker A: And I agree with that. I kind of, again, I'll say this. I'll preface this like, none of this is, just don't do this. Right. Like, just. But I'm. I agree with that.
01:00:50.794 - 01:01:09.596, Speaker A: The. Because. And so my thesis for Bonk was different. Like, I obviously, like, rallied. Like, I bought Bonk then I then understood that a lot of the contributors were unlocking their bonk. And, you know, you've just. It's been down lonely.
01:01:09.596 - 01:01:29.564, Speaker A: It's been challenged. Right. Wif doesn't struggle with that. And so for me, I was lucky to have discovered waif early on. And I think Waif is like, again, the thesis that you need to get very, very right is, for me, my core thesis is Solo's retail chain, memes, will do well. Problem with memes is it's like shooting. It's.
01:01:29.564 - 01:01:46.726, Speaker A: It's a parallel. It's. It's like, most memes will go to zero. Most people will. It's like, it's tough to bet on these things. I just think if you look at. If you look at the strength and down days in the market, just the whiff is just, like, sort of, like, stronger than solar.
01:01:46.830 - 01:01:48.846, Speaker B: It's crazy. How resilient is crazy?
01:01:48.870 - 01:01:54.594, Speaker A: Like, soul is down. Whiff goes down 15, but then rebounds. The strength in the name is like.
01:01:54.894 - 01:02:04.028, Speaker B: It'S crazy right now. So what, so, Santa, you have a, you have a $100 meme coin position. What? How are. Is it all in whiff? Is it whiff and bonk? Is it with bonk?
01:02:04.076 - 01:02:15.012, Speaker A: No, all my bunk sold all my bonk when I realized, like, a lot of contributors were vesting and selling, and I was like, I want to part of this. It's just. Whiff is the pure expression. It's, you know, it is what it is, right?
01:02:15.148 - 01:02:19.784, Speaker B: There's $100 memo coin position, $100 in Wif, and you're just sitting in with.
01:02:23.164 - 01:02:30.472, Speaker A: Like, well, it's appreciated a lot. Dollars invested is a question you're asking.
01:02:30.608 - 01:02:36.084, Speaker B: Like, how did I. I'm actually not asking about dollars invested. I'm asking about. Oh, I see.
01:02:36.504 - 01:02:41.084, Speaker A: Because I put in way more in soul than I did in wif. Let's just be clear.
01:02:41.824 - 01:02:51.366, Speaker B: Let's take your position, like, snapshot of today. Meme coin position. What, just meme coins. Is it all in whiff? Or is it like Wif and bowdoin? Is it.
01:02:51.560 - 01:03:00.854, Speaker A: No, 90, 97% of it is with. Yeah, I just. I'm comfortable. I just. I bought other stuff.
01:03:01.954 - 01:03:03.858, Speaker B: Who runs with who's behind with?
01:03:03.946 - 01:03:05.094, Speaker A: No idea, man.
01:03:05.874 - 01:03:07.058, Speaker B: Isn't that crazy?
01:03:07.226 - 01:03:08.374, Speaker A: Rather not know.
01:03:10.874 - 01:03:15.974, Speaker B: But my DC has the smart. Who. Like, who has the keys to whiff? Who has the smart.
01:03:17.824 - 01:03:18.208, Speaker A: So.
01:03:18.256 - 01:03:19.816, Speaker B: And you don't. And you don't care about that?
01:03:19.920 - 01:03:37.544, Speaker A: No, I don't care about it. I just think it's a cute dog with a hat. And the. The. The anchors that I have are. Okay, Sol, I think, can do a five to six x, then with has higher beta. It will be extremely volatile.
01:03:37.544 - 01:03:49.664, Speaker A: It would be hard to own. Like, you're gonna get punched in the face. You're gonna have stomach wrenching volatility days. But the reality is, like, hold the line. Like, I'm holding the line. I haven't sold with. I haven't sold, sold.
01:03:49.664 - 01:04:17.256, Speaker A: I'm selling other stuff to fund private deals or whatever. But there's, like, clear comps in the market. I think everything's kind of relative, Val. Like, for instance, you look at shib trades of, like, 20, 18 billion, 27 billion. No, it's like 18 billion, I believe. Let's look. Those are the comps for me.
01:04:17.256 - 01:05:10.904, Speaker A: Like, I think, obviously, doge is king of memes, but Shib, I think, offers an interesting comp as a sort of a. Where I think things can go like, shib is trading out 22 billion, fully diluted, 13 billion market cap circulating. So 60% of the tokens are in circulation, and, you know, it's down 70% from its peak. Assuming things stay the same. I just think that, to me, would be an interesting kind of anchor for something like whiff. If it's the most dominant meme in Solana, hypothetically, and Solana continues to do what I think will do, then whiff should do well, and it should probably converge on something like shib. And with is sitting at, you know, 2 billion, 3 billion depends on the day.
01:05:10.904 - 01:05:36.566, Speaker A: Yeah, 2.8 billion. So, you know, it's a ten x. I think solar is a six. Wif is a ten. Maybe 20 x in extreme scenario. So, yeah, I appreciate, like, the relative component of, like, my portfolio might go up dramatically, and so at that point, that might be a reason why I might take, you know, I might rebalance it.
01:05:36.566 - 01:05:42.558, Speaker A: Right. If wif becomes, like, 90% of the position, like, you know, it can't. You know, it's like, no matter how much.
01:05:42.606 - 01:05:46.154, Speaker B: I don't know if you're comfortable sharing this. What percent of the portfolio is Wif right now?
01:05:51.894 - 01:05:57.310, Speaker A: It's high single digits. High single digits. High single digits.
01:05:57.462 - 01:06:01.354, Speaker B: The better question is what percentage of the Wif network is? Santiago.
01:06:03.294 - 01:06:04.314, Speaker A: Next question.
01:06:06.054 - 01:06:10.446, Speaker B: No good, pod man. This is good. I don't know if you have anything else. I'm pumped for the empire.
01:06:10.590 - 01:06:34.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really pumped for the empire. You know, this is. Yeah, it's. It's really nice to. I usually don't like conferences, but I think after going to the ass and then token 2049, the idea that now, like, we can meet these people that are listening to the podcast is really cool. So, yeah, it's exciting. I'm really excited to go out tonight, and hopefully everyone listening here lives in New York or close by can stop.
01:06:34.424 - 01:06:49.600, Speaker B: By and say, hi, we got a little treat. So the multi coin guys invested in this company called Baxis. They're a. Oh, yeah, yeah. They're doing. They're like a whiskey platform, basically. Like, I think digitizing a bunch of, like.
01:06:49.600 - 01:06:54.654, Speaker B: So the whiskey market's crazy. I actually know this because my old manager, this guy Cooper from the company I worked at, Pompey.
01:06:54.694 - 01:06:57.110, Speaker A: Are we going to be serving Pompey von. Von Winkle?
01:06:57.262 - 01:06:59.834, Speaker B: Well, von Winkle. Yeah, you know the game.
01:07:00.814 - 01:07:02.926, Speaker A: I don't drink, but yeah, yeah.
01:07:03.030 - 01:07:22.162, Speaker B: So he used to buy whiskey and actually was bourbon. He's from Kentucky. Used to buy bourbon on these, like, Facebook marketplaces. And it was these, like, crazy auctions. They'd all happen on Facebook marketplaces. And there's, like, you'd send your money and just, like, hope that someone sent you a bottle of bourbon. Sounds like man Gox a month later.
01:07:22.162 - 01:07:31.450, Speaker B: Yeah, literally. And I think I really haven't looked into backs as much to that much. But, like, the founder, after they raised, they raised from Solana, I think.
01:07:31.482 - 01:07:32.178, Speaker A: I spoke with them.
01:07:32.226 - 01:07:44.562, Speaker B: A lot of ventures, multicoin, bunch of folks, $5 million, and they're. The founder is going to bring some whiskey in. So shout out to. I honestly don't even know his name, but his name is Whiskey Titan on Twitter.
01:07:44.698 - 01:08:05.000, Speaker A: What you're saying is, don't come to me to us. Come for the whiskey. You know, come, there's free pizza, and you just show up because you're a broke college student. That was a free whiskey. So it's been a while. I was excited, nervous after. Felt like, you know, we hadn't done this in a while, so it was good and, yeah.
