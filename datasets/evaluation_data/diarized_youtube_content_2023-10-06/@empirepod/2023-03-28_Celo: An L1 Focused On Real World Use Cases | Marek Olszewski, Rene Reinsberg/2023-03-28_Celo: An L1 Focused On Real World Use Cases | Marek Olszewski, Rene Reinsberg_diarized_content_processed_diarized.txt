00:00:02.360 - 00:00:11.806, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. You have Renee and Merrick, the two co founders of Celo, joining us. Really excited to have this episode. Merrick and Renee, welcome to the show, guys.
00:00:11.990 - 00:00:13.166, Speaker B: It's great to be here.
00:00:13.270 - 00:00:15.246, Speaker C: Thank you. Yeah, it's really great to be here.
00:00:15.430 - 00:00:53.834, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the first place I want to start, I've been following salo since, like, the very early days and have never had you two on the show. And I think you two have been a little quieter in the, like, what I'd call the crypto native crypto Twitter sphere, but maybe bigger in some of the real world ecosystems, maybe outside of the Twitter sphere. So maybe I'll pick on Renee to just give a quick overview on the last couple of years in Celo at a very high level for maybe crypto Twitter sphere people who are listening, who maybe don't know Celo, and then we can get into some of the fun stuff you guys are working on, if that works for you.
00:00:54.244 - 00:01:53.854, Speaker B: Sounds great. Yeah, I mean, this is a good prompt to just even, like, go back in time to when we first started thinking about, you know, Celo. And we recently looked back at the old white paper, and we're actually like, wow, we're actually, you know, this, like, this exists now. This has been built, and some of the stuff the core team build, some of the stuff people in the community built. But it's interesting because what really got us into the space was, I think, a realization that Ethereum, smart contracts, just generally, web3, would potentially bring a huge change in how people are able to access the digital economy. And I think, for us, was exciting to play a role in that. And the first thing we did is build a wallet on Ethereum and put it in front of real people, people that weren't deep in the space, and try to get an understanding of what would be required to make this stuff work for everyday people.
00:01:53.854 - 00:02:29.860, Speaker B: And this is going back five, almost six years ago at this point. And there was a big gap. And I think the gap, to some extent, still exists. Right. But it's been closing, and I think Celo has played a pretty big role in helping close the gap. And you now have people really, all over the world that are using products built on Celo, often realizing that it's powered by an open, permissionless public blockchain under the hood, but bringing them real value in their day to day lives. And so, in many ways, this was and has been our focus of all these years.
00:02:29.860 - 00:03:18.658, Speaker B: And as much as I think, personally speaking, I have Merrick chime in. I'd love to chime in on a lot of the Twitter arguments that are happening. There's 24 hours in the day, and we, we like to spend those time on product with founders in the ecosystem and moving the puck forward. And I do think that has led to sello being a little less known than some of its peers. But I think that's also really changing this year as there's the shift and focus on, hey, how is this stuff actually worked? How is this used in the wild? Does Webstery. It's kind of the moment. Does Webstery have reason to exist? And I think this has led to a lot of people starting to look at sello now, and maybe sometimes taking a second look and saying, oh, wait a second.
00:03:18.658 - 00:03:26.174, Speaker B: Like, wow, you guys are actually delivering against not just Sello's initial promise, but I think why a lot of people got into the space.
00:03:28.594 - 00:03:51.124, Speaker A: I actually want to go pre sello for a second. I was doing a little LinkedIn stalking and saw that you were both at MIT. And then it looks like co founded a company together, got bought by GoDaddy, and then spent, looks like maybe three or four years ago. Daddy, did sello come out of some of the problems that you guys saw inside of GoDaddy with how that world worked or two totally unrelated things?
00:03:52.184 - 00:04:23.164, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I can take that. I would say it's unrelated, but you're right. Renny and I met at MIT. Actually, we met a funny story. We met in the class taught by Tim Berners Lee about the original web3. So back then, 2010 timeframe, Tim Berners Lee was working on the semantic web and linked data. And for a while, people were calling that the third version of the web.
00:04:23.164 - 00:04:37.844, Speaker C: And so actually, our first company, Loku, it was primarily a machine learning company in the data space. And it had those origins in Web three, which is pretty shiny.
00:04:38.984 - 00:04:43.844, Speaker A: Wait, what was the third web? I don't know that story.
00:04:45.664 - 00:05:33.124, Speaker C: There's this effort to create open databases using what's called the semantic web, or link data. This idea that you have documents that represent data that are linking to each other, much the way that documents on the web link to each other. And so this is the idea behind the semantic web and the web. Three w, three, c foundation and Timber news. Lee have been working on standardizing this now for a while. And for a while, people were calling that the third version of the web. So this idea that we could do to data what timber has, leave it for documents, namely, make them open, make them accessible to everyone.
00:05:33.124 - 00:05:57.314, Speaker C: Fast forward to today, it turns out that, yeah, having open data is really valuable, and the semantic web was one way to achieve that, but another way to do that is permissionless public ledgers. They're clearly, I think there's been just a wealth of activity around this way of representing data in a fully open and transparent manner.
00:05:58.174 - 00:06:46.844, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just to add super quickly, to add to this, I think there's some perils here. And in many ways, for me, what kind of drew me to the original Webster, the semantic web are some of the things that I think drew us into web3 now, which is really giving power to the individual, to a community of people, versus centralizing power. And this is back in 2000, 920 ten. Even then, people were talking about, hey, what is happening with big Web two conglomerates? The power they're amassing over their users in many ways, some of the discussions back then were a precursor of what I think people are discussing now is as they look at what web3 architecture can enable.
00:06:49.624 - 00:07:05.840, Speaker A: I want to tie this into the l one wars, I guess id call them, and that happened in 2020 and 2021. And maybe id just zoom out and talk about the l one ecosystems in general. So when you guys launched Celo, my memory is you launched sometime mid 2017, if I remember that correctly, or late.
00:07:05.872 - 00:07:08.048, Speaker C: 2017, sometime in 2017.
00:07:08.096 - 00:07:49.954, Speaker A: You can correct me if im wrong there, but what happened is you had all these other l one s that took advantage of. I'd call the ico boom. A lot of those didn't actually work out, but you did have these other l one s, like the Solanas and the avalanches and kind of the nears and phantoms that did really well in the kind of 2020 days. And some of those are still doing well and others aren't, I'd be curious to hear. Now, I think all the talk of the town are these l two s, like optimism and arbitrum. I've kind of taken the narrative. I'd be curious to get your take on where you all sit in the ecosystem and what is the value prop of celo relative to all these other things that are getting built right now.
00:07:52.094 - 00:08:54.052, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I start high level Americ. Feel free to jump in on some of the, I think this is also maybe a good opportunity to start talking a little bit about the Silo roadmap and Silo 2.0, which we recently announced. But I think at a high level, we were from the beginning very driven by what does it take to achieve a certain use case. And for us, that started really from the end user experience and then going all the way down the stack to recognize certain areas where at the time, Ethereum was falling short. And I think even today, you will be hard pressed to find an infrastructure that can accommodate a micropayments use case and easy cash in, cash out without the need for multiple tokens in a local community somewhere. For us, I think really zooming in on that use case at the center of what has become a much richer ecosystem and set of use cases, I think has really led to differentiation.
00:08:54.052 - 00:10:40.844, Speaker B: I think a lot of the stuff that you see on sello that you see working and growing is very different than the things that have worked on some of these other chains you mentioned, where there's, I think, a lot more similarities in terms of how people are engaging with those and what some of the use cases are, which oftentimes are much more driven by whale defi activity, for example, versus peer to peer payments in a local market, or people creating these really native new kind of digital economies. So to me, that in some ways has kept us out of those layer one wars, because we've been just focused on those use cases. But I think increasingly we get pulled into that because people are saying, hey, wait a second, I can build all the things on sallow, that I can build on a polygon, on an avalanche. Why should I not pick solo? The answer is, yeah, actually there are good reasons to so big sello. In fact, we are increasingly, as we're also seeing more and more projects launch and transaction volume increase and projects becoming more successful, I think that has led us to think about, okay, from a roadmap perspective, what are the things that are actually necessary to help those projects grow with an on celo, rather than starting from this, hey, let's build a thing that no one will really know how to use, but that may be useful ten years from now and will sound really sexy. Let's just build something pragmatically that works, that achieves a lot of the things that we're looking to achieve and is future proof in a way that it can be extended over time. And the way sello is set up is that through on chain governance, sello holders can vote on changes to the protocol.
00:10:40.844 - 00:11:06.864, Speaker B: There have been several hard folks. There have been tons of proposals to bring changes to selloffs even since mainnet launch, which, by the way, was in 2020. So we're coming up on our three year mainnet anniversary on Earth Day this year. There's been a lot of change to the core protocol, but, yeah, I'll let Marek chime in on some of more of the specifics, but that's how I would think about high level.
00:11:08.444 - 00:12:54.584, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think first and foremost, we were big believers of the Ethereum ecosystem. We started our journey in the ethereum ecosystem by first building a wallet on Ethereum. Actually, the reason we ended up working on seller the platform itself is because, as Rene mentioned, we wanted to have some functionality that made it really easy for non crypto native people to use wallets and address their real world use case needs. That took us down the path of thinking, okay, well, we need, we need a consensus protocol that is secure and decentralized, but also that offers one block finality, so that when you send the payment to someone, you don't have to worry about that payment being rolled back. When you make that decision, you end up creating a proof of stake protocol that is, in our case, it was new and novel. When we launched almost three years ago, installer was the first proof of stake, like major proof of stake EVM compatible chain, which was really exciting. And then we also added other features like the ability to pay for gas with tokens natively in the platform without third party bundlers or meta transaction relayers, which ended up being really nice, so that if I send you a stable coin, you can send that on to someone else without being stuck, which I'm sure many of your listeners may have personally even experienced.
00:12:54.584 - 00:13:57.250, Speaker C: And then we added phone numbers as a way to, as an identity layer. It's an optional identity layer. It's something that wallets can opt into, and it allows folks to send payments to phone numbers and to people in your contact list in a fully decentralized way. And that, I think, is probably one of the biggest enablers for p two P payments on Celo. And we wanted it to be core and a first class citizen in the platform so that it worked across different wallets, so that it was truly a standard. And so those are some of the decisions that took us down the path of working on a new layer. One, I think critically, I think we saw, I think, just how far ahead the EVM was compared to every other idea at the time.
00:13:57.250 - 00:14:19.494, Speaker C: And we're glad that we made the right bet. I think we've been really close to the Ethereum ecosystem, and as Renee mentioned, we have some pretty exciting plans up ahead with solo 2.0 that bring us even closer, one of which will be the ability to pay for gas with wet soon on Cello, which will be, I think, really, really nice. Nice.
00:14:20.434 - 00:15:08.194, Speaker A: You talked about phone numbers. Like, when I think about Celo as maybe an outsider looking in, one of the first things that comes to mind is mobile first. And you guys have this lite client that uses CK snarks, I think it is to help users sync with the network with only a few kilobytes of data. Um, and then you also have these like, like you mentioned, Merrick, you've kind of securely mapped phone numbers to wallet addresses, which is a really clear, like, gives people the ability to send crypto to, obviously friends and family in your contact list before you even sign up for a wallet, which is a, which is a really nice feature. What is the, um, like, what's been the uh, impact of building this like mobile first layer here?
00:15:09.814 - 00:16:24.318, Speaker B: Yeah, jump in a little bit and maybe just even give some stats. I saw this recently, one of the Amms, the Lancelo, posted the distribution of their usage and there was, I think over 80% of people that were accessing it were doing so from mobile devices and then likely signing transactions with mobile wallets like Valora. And that's a fundamentally different user behavior than your typical user connecting on a desktop with metamask or some other setup. That's really, I think, where to your original question, hey, why in this world of all these layer ones and L2s now, why should people care about cells? Is a fundamentally different audience that you're able to reach when you're building a dapp. You have really a lot of the mobile tooling, you have SDKs to quickly build mobile dapps. You have best in class mobile wallets. You have the ability to really streamline the user experience by allowing people to pay, for example in stablecoins or soon with.
00:16:24.318 - 00:17:24.431, Speaker B: And you have on and off ramps in a lot of markets where really regular people want to easily cash in from their mobile money account. And they don't want to jump through like four or five hoops or go through an exchange, but they just want to fund their wallet and then use, adapt and go on with their life or cash out from a payment they got for doing some work in an online marketplace. So I think by focusing so specifically on mobile and making sure that people that are building on sello can have really tight, great experience on mobile, I think that's led to a fundamentally different user base. And in a way is also, I think the reason you have a lot of dapps that have chosen to deploy on sello. Maybe they start in Ethereum or another VM, but they're looking to grow their audience and sello is a really great way to do that. Yeah.
00:17:24.447 - 00:17:55.255, Speaker C: And when we started, nobody was talking about mobile. I think everything was desktop based. Everything was basically through metamask as a browser extension. I don't think there were any real major mobile wallets out at the time. Certainly, there was no Solana phone being talked about. And I was going around talking about how we have this backwards. Web three should be leading Web two.
00:17:55.255 - 00:18:32.102, Speaker C: Web two moved to mobile, like, ten years ago already. There's this famous book called just Mobile first. That's just an amazing read, and I think it's by Luke Rubelski, if I remember correctly. And Web two. That book took Web two by storm, and web two transitioned. But somehow Web three was behind in this really, really important way. Part of the focus around mobile was just to get that evolution right.
00:18:32.102 - 00:19:31.936, Speaker C: But part of it was also this belief that for the advantages that crypto and Web three offer, the people who need those advantages the most are mobile devices. And so we should be building mobile. And that's what took us down the path of coming up with a consensus protocol that used threshold cryptography and BLS twelve 377, which then enabled us to actually create snark based clients, which no other protocol has, certainly no other EVM compatible protocol has. And that's amazing. Clients are critically important for security and decentralization, and we worked really, really hard to create something that allows you to sync with very, very little data. Yeah.
00:19:32.040 - 00:19:33.084, Speaker A: What's been the.
00:19:34.144 - 00:19:35.600, Speaker C: So, I mean, one of the main.
00:19:35.632 - 00:19:56.464, Speaker A: Reasons I want to have you guys on Empire is to. I think we're at the heart of this bear market, and I think there are a lot of people, maybe, who aren't deeply embedded in crypto land saying, what are we all doing this for? What are the use cases here? Can you guys talk about the actual real world use cases here and what you've seen the impact of some of these technical decisions that you've made?
00:19:57.524 - 00:20:38.936, Speaker B: Totally, yeah. I would say today a lot of what has been in sort of broader web3. Right. Where what's actually working is in gaming. Right. And then you mentioned Defi as an example, but we've really not seen sort of a lot of real world use cases. And so I think this is why it's interesting to take a bit more of a deep dive into the cello ecosystem and look at projects that are solving real world problems and sometimes connecting, really just using sort of the kind of the cello chain as a settlement layer.
00:20:38.936 - 00:22:01.642, Speaker B: Right. For what they're building, but sometimes also smartly connecting those applications into the broader ecosystem, digital economy, whether that's for liquidity and connecting global capital markets to small scale farmers in Mexico, which is something that, for example, ethic hub is doing with coffee farmers, allowing folks to basically do loans, peer to peer loans, to small scale farmers, which otherwise would have no access to those loans. And capital generally. There's an element here, of course, leveraging a broader defi movement, but then tying it to real world use. Case, I think the other area, and this is something that sello has really been getting known as the home for refi regenerative finance. Maybe for those who are not familiar with the term regenerative finance, the way I would define it is really kind of derived from regenerative economics and decentralized finance, but sort of having a financial system that has positive externalities. So imagine you're participating in a financial system, but by doing so, you're not actually extracting more from the environment or from people, but you're actually having a positive impact.
00:22:01.642 - 00:23:06.234, Speaker B: So by transacting more, that has a positive impact on the environment or on the community. Some examples for that, which are life on salo and have been growing quite nicely. It's things like, for example, having currencies backed by natural assets. And by doing so, the more those currencies, local currencies, often community currencies, the more they're used, the more they lead to a preservation of those natural assets. An example of that would be a project called Collectivo, which has developed a whole framework for that and has started rolling that out, bunch of different places. Starting in Curacao, where you have a community currency, the Curacao guilder, that's unchained and backed by natural assets. Starting with food forests, local food forests, coral reefs in the future, and other assets that as you imagine that economy growing and more of that currency circulating and being used, more of those assets being preserved, that's quite powerful.
00:23:06.234 - 00:23:50.432, Speaker B: But you also see it by really, by starting to bring connectivity, in a sense, beyond information, but with value to communities. You start seeing people really, all over the world, suddenly be connected to this digital economy. You have artists, creators, that can create things and access a global audience. You start seeing people that. One of my more recently projects I've been spending some time with is plastics, where people are pretty familiar now with the concept of carbon offsets. And it's widely discussed. And in fact, the big challenge with carbon offsets is greenwashing.
00:23:50.432 - 00:24:50.598, Speaker B: And web3 actually helps because it brings more liquidity to those markets and it brings more transparency. And so you actually, over time, you'll see a flight to high quality assets. Because a corporate who wants to offset their carbon footprint and purchase those credits and doing so on chain will bring transparency to the market, to those projects that will straight on address that kind of issue. And there's other benefits too. But what's much less known is that this is really just the tip of the iceberg when you think about climate assets and taking positive climate action. So you now have a team called plastics that has created sort of a similar concept for offsetting the plastics footprint of an organization or a community, and basically providing a mechanism for people in the local community to collect, for example, plastics, bring them to recycling centers, and get monetary value in a form of a token directly for that. That can be used again in this digital economy.
00:24:50.598 - 00:25:07.174, Speaker B: Right. And all of these things are building blocks in this broader regenerative digital economy that people can now build with. My hope is that this year people also will start more engaging with that and seeing a totally different side of web3 and crypto.
00:25:07.674 - 00:25:17.094, Speaker A: Merrick, before you jump in, I'm curious, Renee, where are or Merrick, you can take the answer to this, but where is this activity actually happening? I'm assuming it's outside of the United States.
00:25:18.634 - 00:26:06.644, Speaker C: Yeah, great question for a lot of p two p payments activities. Certainly we're seeing a lot of that happening outside the US, a lot in LATAM, a lot in Africa. And I think Rennie mentioned Collectivo. They're based in Curacao. There's other protocols that are giving out ubis, universal basic incomes on Celo, like impact market, good dollar. And these are also operating primarily in emerging markets. I think impact market is focused heavily on favela communities in Brazil, communities throughout West Africa, and even places like Afghanistan after the US withdrawal.
00:26:06.644 - 00:27:16.254, Speaker C: So real adversarial environments where it's very difficult to get any sort of payment to someone in a cost effective way. And they found that with, with Celo, with the ability to send value really cheaply to anyone using the same rails in every country that they operate. They're, I think, about an order of magnitude more efficient than something like give directly, which outside of web3, has been the leader for doing really, really low overhead and efficient cash transfers. But what's really great about impact market is they disperse those funds to these beneficiaries. They've dispersed millions and millions of dollars. Now and then the money circulates in these communities. People use mobile wallets like Veloura, which I spend some of my time on, which is kind of the evolution of that wallet that we started on Ethereum.
00:27:16.254 - 00:28:10.844, Speaker C: They use it like people in the US use Venmo. And the money just circulates in these communities. Again, you can pay for gas with tokens on cella, so you can send stable coins and you can send it to people in your contact list, and it just circulates. There's another project that's been planting trees in Kenya called Silvi. They're incentivizing, it's a whole protocol incentivizing the planting of trees around this one rainforest that's being deforested over there. And they have an interesting protocol which incentivizes the planting of the trees. But what's really cool to see is once the trees are planted and once people verify that other people have done the work, naturally you need some game theoretic elements to make sure that are doing this well.
00:28:10.844 - 00:28:22.204, Speaker C: But the end result is this. Money lives in these communities, in these farmer communities, and starts to circulate in these farmer communities, which is just incredible.
00:28:23.584 - 00:28:25.164, Speaker A: I feel more like you're making.
00:28:25.624 - 00:28:26.872, Speaker C: Go ahead, Renee.
00:28:27.048 - 00:29:28.658, Speaker B: No, I just think there's, I think a lot of the examples we've given and described are really oftentimes grassroots projects that are starting in a community and that grow from that community, then grow to other communities. So it's a different timeline than you have your big Nft drop and it gets a bunch of people to pay attention for a moment. But this is really sustainable engagement that grows over time. And I think to me, um, you know, and I guess when we started this, like, we had a very long time horizon, sort of that we kind of felt we would be working against. Just given some of the technical challenges, a lot of the stuff actually, you know, happened faster. But I will. I mean, you know, I'm very bullish that the first chain to really, or ecosystem, to really onboard and truly onboard, not just like a one off, but really sustainably onboard.
00:29:28.658 - 00:30:13.744, Speaker B: A billion people to web3 is sello. And that's like, probably truer now than it ever was, just given a lot of the amazing projects that are happening at a grassroots level. And then I think, also supercharged with things like Deutsche Telecom, which has 250 million people in their global user base that are also taking a deep look at Webstrino. They're already validating on Celo. They're running Oracle. They're actually an exceptional team. Now that I'm in Europe, I'm spending a lot more time with their team and them just impressed by the expertise that they have in house around Web three, which is five, six years ago for a corporate, you would not have expected that.
00:30:13.744 - 00:30:44.254, Speaker B: All that makes me really bullish that over the next few years we're going to get really close to actually bringing real people in big numbers into this digital economy, giving them real world value every day. So that continues to be sort of the North Star and why we're here. But it's really encouraging to see the diversity also in approaches and projects that are contributing towards making that happen.
00:30:44.674 - 00:31:00.012, Speaker A: Do you guys think that is the veloura kind of the holy grail here in terms of the first. Do you think that'll be the first real world use case that gets to, I don't know, whatever number, big number that we want to call it. 10 million users, 100 million users.
00:31:00.068 - 00:31:00.812, Speaker C: Billion users.
00:31:00.868 - 00:31:03.544, Speaker A: Is it velour or are there other things on the horizon?
00:31:05.004 - 00:31:44.234, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly lots of things on the horizon. But veloura, I'm biased. I work there as well. Very, very excited about it. I think it does a really good job of showcasing all of the really amazing features that solo has to offer and just creates just a really, really easy to use mobile wallet. And if you look at the homepage or the home screen for the wallet, yes, there's a whole dapp browser. You can sign transactions within Dapps and that's quite elegant.
00:31:44.234 - 00:32:20.774, Speaker C: But the two primary actions on the home screen are send and receive. And so it's really, I would say, catered towards this kind of payments use case. And again, that's what we're seeing in emerging markets, people using the wallet for. So yeah, I'm very, very excited. If you haven't tried velour, I highly recommend checking it out. And yeah, I don't know, Rennie, are there any other exciting things coming down that we can talk about?
00:32:21.754 - 00:33:21.488, Speaker B: Look, to me, I see Valora and also some of the other wallets as key fabric. And I think the better Valora, the better the experience as you use a lot of the other products. Halo five used to be called good ghosting, just rebranded and it's super popular right now. It's non loss lottery group savings. And I think obviously some of the use cases we talked about, I think to me, I actually, maybe this is where America, I don't think it's a disagreement, but I actually think it's going to be a collection of different applications in different places, really growing, all finding product market fit, or some of them have found product market fit in. They're growing week over week, month over month. And so it's not like this one big moment where suddenly it's like, wow, this thing.
00:33:21.488 - 00:34:31.414, Speaker B: But it's a lot more sustainable in that sense. Now, you do have obviously some bigger organizations part of the ecosystem. I mentioned dutch telecom, T Mobile, Kickstarter announced they're decentralizing doing that with cello. So there is definitely when you have sort of someone who brings a big existing audience and is able to successfully actually onboard them, often that requires to actually abstracting a lot of web3 into the background and just giving people a great user experience, then I think those can be all big drivers. But to me, the power of sello really comes down to a lot of these building blocks just working really well together. And this is something that I also personally, really, I mean, I enjoy working in this ecosystem where people are just very collaborative, where people are very aligned towards the, what's the North Star. And so you do see a lot of collaborations, partnerships, projects, teaming up and doing interesting things together.
00:34:31.414 - 00:35:20.574, Speaker B: So to me, yeah, I think it's probably the combination of a few things that just, just are on their path and are growing. But yes, certainly helps to have really strong wallets. We talked a little bit about the fiat connect standard and the connect the world program of just making on and off boarding just super seamless, which I think that's really what's been holding back web3 adoption more broadly. It's just too painful today. We discovered that pretty early, just by trying this out and realizing the pain ourself. That's been a big focus for the foundation, but also for Valora and for a lot of the key ecosystem projects that are working on this. And it's truly a joint effort of the ecosystem.
00:35:20.574 - 00:35:49.032, Speaker B: And when we crack that, I think it will dramatically accelerate adoption, because today that's the hurdle. Someone gets to the point where they want to bring money in or take money out, takes time or comes at a prohibitive cost. For small payments, I think we've solved it for bigger payments, but for small payments, that's something that's really only now getting much better. And I think that's key differentiator for sell on the seller ecosystem.
00:35:49.208 - 00:36:51.772, Speaker C: Yeah. And this is something I feel really passionately about, so maybe I'll jump in real quick. But if you think about it, right, we've solved the ability to send payments to anyone in the world, I think not just with veloura and solo, but I would say as a broader web3 ecosystem, we have enough scalability, we have enough functionality. Now, certainly on sello, we have the ease of use to send stablecoins to anyone in the world, to literally any phone number, and have them receive it, like, within, like, 2.5 seconds on average, without the like, and be able to then send it on to someone else without having to go and buy gas. So that's great. But, you know, we haven't seen this explosion of payments the way that, for example, when WhatsApp kind of launched, kind of took over the world, when they basically made sending a message to any phone number in the world free and instantaneous.
00:36:51.772 - 00:38:14.554, Speaker C: And we hypothesize that this is because the value is not immediately useful for everyone in the world unless you can cash out instantly or until all payments become web3 base, which I think, I would imagine a lot of your listeners think is going to happen. And hopefully soon we're in this transition period until that happens, where you need to be able to move back and forth between fiat and crypto really, really easily, and not just in one country, but in every country in the world. And the only way we get there is if we have hundreds and hundreds of on and off ramps that all have their licenses and local banking relations in each market to be able to offer that service. And increasingly, we're seeing dozens and soon hundreds of these on and off ramps in all, all kind of markets around the world launching. A lot of people are really excited about this business opportunity, but the one thing that's really holding back the whole ecosystem is the fact that everyone speaks a different language. Every on and off ramp has their own API, their own web widget, which is a pain to integrate for wallets and a pain to maintain. It's not feasible for wallets to have hundreds and hundreds of these bespoke integrations.
00:38:14.554 - 00:38:39.912, Speaker C: And so when this happens, a very standard solution is to create a standard. And so that's what fiat connect is. You can read more about it at Fiat connect.org dot. But if you launch a standard, all it does typically is it becomes like an extra thing that people have to integrate. And so Renny mentioned connect the world. That's what we launched.
00:38:39.912 - 00:39:34.114, Speaker C: The foundation launched a $20 million incentive program to effectively incentivize the adoption of the standard. And that's been going well. There's, I think, 50 different. There's about 50 markets that are currently in flight to launch soon, of which the first six launched just a few weeks ago. I think we have Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, India, and the Philippines are all live, using a number of different providers integrated into Veloura and soon into other wallets in the cellular ecosystem. And critically, it's a native experience. The user doesn't even know that they're using a third party, certainly it's mentioned in the app, but they don't have to go through a custom login screen in a web browser.
00:39:34.114 - 00:40:03.084, Speaker C: It just all feels very, very native to the wallet. And yeah, this is, I think, the power of crypto, right? That we can have incentive models that we can organize as a group to solve really big and ambitious problems. And I think solving on and off ramping globally is extremely ambitious, extremely big. And luckily, crypto is just very amenable to doing that really, really well. Yeah.
00:40:05.274 - 00:40:23.494, Speaker A: How come you guys don't just, what's the decision behind not just being a roll up on ethereum? I feel like that would remove the cost of needing to bootstrap and maintain this validator network while being able to provide the capital and the users on ethereum. What's the thought process behind not going down that route?
00:40:24.514 - 00:41:54.270, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. I think part of it is roll ups were invented long after sello started, and so we've invested heavily and done that bootstrapping. We have a really great consensus protocol that has only really had one hiccup over the last three years and otherwise has been just absolutely rock solid. The other thing I would say is some of our use cases require very low transaction fees and one block tonality and short block times when people are, for example, dispersing UBIs or using p two p transaction, just using it for p two p transactions in emerging markets, they can't really pay more than a 10th of a cent for a transaction before it starts becoming not economical to use a public blockchain. And sadly, with rollups today, you can't say on Ethereum, you can't achieve that cost. I think the reality is, until bank sharding comes out on Ethereum, you won't be able to store your transactions on Ethereum at scale and be able to deliver those low costs. So we're big believers in rollups.
00:41:54.270 - 00:42:53.078, Speaker C: I think we agree that it is by far the most secure way of scaling a chain horizontally. I think the kind of the organic cosmos like model, I think has some appeal. But from a security perspective, I think you're definitely making trade offs. You ultimately end up having to trust the validator sets of all the chains that are sending you messages. And so as a full node, you have to basically run all the chains, which doesn't really scale. And the sharded model that Ethereum two started with, I think has a very similar problem where full nodes have to run all the shards to be able to trust what's going on in any one chart. So from that perspective, rollups to be able to only have to trust that there exists one on a civil node or in the case of ZK rollups, you don't even have to trust that.
00:42:53.078 - 00:43:16.194, Speaker C: That is extremely appealing. And we're really big believers of that strategy. Yeah. How it fits into Stella's long term plan with regards to Ethereum, I think is something that the community is talking about. But right now there's not much to be decided on because the gas costs would just be prohibitive for all the use cases happening on zillow. Yeah.
00:43:16.934 - 00:43:24.194, Speaker A: Awesome guys. Well, I appreciate you guys making the time here. Renee and Merrick, anything else that we missed that you guys really want to talk about?
00:43:27.054 - 00:43:59.146, Speaker B: Look, I think we've covered a lot. I would say for anyone who's listening who is a builder and you haven't checked out sello yet, definitely give it a look. Sello.org dot you know, we're coming up on a quarter billion transactions processed mostly on the network. I track about a thousand, a little bit over a thousand projects. Active projects, try to be in touch with many of them. Over 100 of those have raised venture funding.
00:43:59.146 - 00:44:28.400, Speaker B: I think that's a little known fact as well. Q three Q four of last year is over 100 million in venture money going into projects built on top of celo. So not like Celo itself, but into the ecosystem. So it's a very vibrant community. Lots of investors all over the world as well. So there's a bunch of folks also running ecosystem funds and projects are getting funded right now. I think real world use cases are really top of mind for a lot of people.
00:44:28.400 - 00:45:14.014, Speaker B: Regenerative finance as a concept too. If folks are new to that and haven't heard, I highly encourage to take a closer look. You I think it's really a big shift that we're seeing from a year ago where no one really talked about it to now. It's becoming much more something that every dapp developer is thinking about. Hey, what does it mean to build in a regenerative way? And I think it's something that users also really appreciate and gravitate towards. I would just invite everyone to check Celo out, come to one of our events meetups. We're very friendly community, so just come and say hi at the next event.
00:45:15.234 - 00:45:33.932, Speaker C: Yeah, and we have community centers in San Francisco, in New York, in Berlin, in Buenos Aires. And so it's a great way to meet people in person. So if you're in any of those locations or if you're traveling to any of those locations, then definitely come knock on our door. Nice. Awesome, guys.
00:45:33.988 - 00:45:36.704, Speaker A: We'll appreciate the time, and I will talk to you guys soon.
00:45:37.204 - 00:45:39.260, Speaker B: Thanks so much for cutting. Bye.
00:45:39.292 - 00:45:40.004, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
