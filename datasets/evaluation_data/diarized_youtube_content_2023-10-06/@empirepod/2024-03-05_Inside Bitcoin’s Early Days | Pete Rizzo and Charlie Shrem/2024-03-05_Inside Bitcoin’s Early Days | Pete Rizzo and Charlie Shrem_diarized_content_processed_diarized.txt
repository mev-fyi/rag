00:00:00.320 - 00:00:23.590, Speaker A: Back then, the idea of disrupting money was still youd be laughed out of the room. There was only the incumbents, which were Paypal, basically. And then you had the banks. So that picture that you see there was the first money 2020 conference which took place in May 2012. That room was all incumbents. It was. No one knew you couldnt disrupt money at all.
00:00:23.590 - 00:00:29.264, Speaker A: There was no the concept of sending money from purchase person to person didn't exist.
00:00:30.044 - 00:01:06.520, Speaker B: Hey everyone, if you have been listening to Empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on Arbitrum. Whatever you're doing, you can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to portal Arbitrum IO and check it out. What's up everyone?

Talking about paralyzing the EVM and the news of the topic de jour, I would say, of the week. And this is actually a look into the earlier days of crypto. And actually, when I started to get into the industry, it wasn't really even called crypto. It was just bitcoin.
00:02:19.230 - 00:02:41.064, Speaker B: I was just interested in bitcoin, and that was really it. Two close friends who have been in the industry for a while, we have Pete Rizzo, who helped build Coindesk in the early days, I think you could say did build Coindesk, came into the industry in 2013. Rizzo, controversial topic. I know. There, but that's all right. And then lawyers, you ask, for sure. Yeah, exactly.
00:02:41.064 - 00:03:03.526, Speaker B: Exactly. And then we have Charlie Shrem. And Charlie came into the industry in either 2010 or 2011. Builtinston, which we're going to hear about as he went off to jail, which we will eventually hear about. If you're okay talking about it, Charlie, then RZA will step in and talk about the kind of 2013, 2014 to 2017 days. So. Yeah.
00:03:03.526 - 00:03:04.434, Speaker B: Welcome, guys.
00:03:04.854 - 00:03:05.902, Speaker A: It's good to be here.
00:03:05.998 - 00:03:10.194, Speaker B: Oh, and we have court. Court. Charlie, can you put the camera on? Court? What's up?
00:03:10.534 - 00:03:37.360, Speaker A: Hi, everybody. She's been through it all since day one as well, so it's been 2013 a lot of times. Like, we were just sitting in a story the other day and forgot where we were. And Courtney goes, remember when we were sitting there in the park and Vitalik was eating grass? And I totally forgot that whole story. And I was like, thank you for being there, because, like, for the book and everything. I forgot to write that. That story down and everything like that.
00:03:37.360 - 00:03:37.968, Speaker A: So I don't know.
00:03:38.016 - 00:03:38.240, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:38.272 - 00:03:40.472, Speaker B: So, like, literally eating grass.
00:03:40.568 - 00:04:08.850, Speaker A: Yeah. What happened? Do you remember that situation? We were at Ulysses for the first crabs? Oh, you were getting lobster Ulysses. We were hanging out with Nick Spanos. Nick Spanos from the bitcoin center when the bitcoin center was around, and. And we were sitting on the ground and waiting for the food or something. And he was just, like, sitting there eating grass and convincing us that. But, yeah, he was, like, telling us the whole story, that it's good for you.
00:04:08.850 - 00:04:26.484, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like all this protein, like that. We used to have the ability to digest grass, and if humans could digest. He got this whole thing. If humans can digest grass, then we could superpower grasses. All the grass is right there. It's everywhere. And then cows can.
00:04:26.484 - 00:04:29.144, Speaker A: Cows can completely. It can live off of grass.
00:04:29.964 - 00:04:48.102, Speaker C: This is a great Vitalik story, by the way. Yeah. And there are many there. What my favorite thing about Vitalik is there's a phases of Vitalik. There's, like, different eras of Vitalik, but, yeah, this was the nice schoolboy kind of bitcoin magazine writer, who was just, like, really chipper and happy to be there. I think I'm correctly right. He was.
00:04:48.102 - 00:04:49.674, Speaker C: He was the good student.
00:04:50.814 - 00:05:02.742, Speaker B: So maybe we can. Maybe we can start there. We can start with, like, what the space looked like in Charlie. I'll throw this one to you. Like, 2011 to 2013. Like, I just paint. Paint a picture for us.
00:05:02.742 - 00:05:15.210, Speaker B: Like, who are the players, like, who are the people? Where were they located? Was it San Francisco? Was it New York? Was it New Hampshire? Because the talk show, like, paint a picture for us of like what the industry looked like in 2011 and 2012.
00:05:15.302 - 00:05:44.646, Speaker A: A lot of these Satoshi emails just came out, actually, which is really interesting. And I know Pete has dissected them a lot more than I have. I just read a kind of a few off of your thread, so thank you for constantly putting that out there. And so starting with those with the Satoshi email days, this was like the era of 2009 to 2000, I would say. I think he disappeared in April or like March or something like that, of 2011. He disappeared April. There you go.
00:05:44.646 - 00:05:53.198, Speaker A: April 20. Eleven. And so to give context, I joined the forum, I was around lurking, but I joined the forum May of 2011, like one month after.
00:05:53.366 - 00:05:57.358, Speaker B: This is the top, this is the bitcoin talk for him. And how many people were. So you joined two weeks, and I.
00:05:57.366 - 00:05:59.834, Speaker C: Would have been the top of the 2011 bubble.
00:06:02.894 - 00:06:16.134, Speaker A: That's why I lost all my money originally, because I bought bitcoin like $30 and it went up to 36. And I was like, I found gold and I'm going to dump to like $2. And I'm like, all right, I need to work in this industry and figure out a way to make this price go up again.
00:06:17.114 - 00:06:34.974, Speaker B: So I found this great, great thing that you posted. December 28, 2011. Charlie, you said with digital currency, like bitcoin, being broke is merely a technical issue. December 28, 2011. So what was, yeah, take me into the mind of like December 2011.
00:06:35.334 - 00:07:06.280, Speaker A: You had the pre satoshi. So you had those like, that's kind of like the era, like pause point of when Satoshi disappeared. Everything pre that Satoshi was kind of like running the community. Everyone can, everyone was on form dot bitcoin.org. And it was a website that him and they most started. And, and there was an IRC network which was like bitcoin, hashtag bitcoin on a free node, hashtag bitcoindev, hash bitcoin, OTC, and then a couple of other ones. And that's kind of like where more the technical discussion started.
00:07:06.280 - 00:07:52.060, Speaker A: And that's where they still actually take place. And that's where originally connected with bitcoin was in the IRC, because I was hanging out in some different IRC rooms at the time. And that's how originally connected to bitcoin. But once Satoshi disappeared, it was a very, it was a society based on what contribution the, what people respect you had within the community. On the forums of bitcoin was, what contribution are you giving it? Like, was very anti rent seekers. So it was like, what contribution are you giving towards larger bitcoin community? People who are, like, buying and selling things on the forums, only taking money, you know, pro for products. And bitcoin, you have people running little websites.
00:07:52.060 - 00:08:19.842, Speaker A: Like, there was a little GLBSC, which was like a website where you can go public, bitcoin only, which is how shape shift and Eric Voorhees took. He made a lot of money. Like, dude, they took thousands of bitcoin. And some other ones, like, this guy actually passed away, was this romanian guy. He kind of ran that, too. And there's a lot of these little historical connection points, but it was a lot of misfits. There was a lot of people who were kind of, like, on the fringes of society in some way or another, but who are highly technical.
00:08:19.842 - 00:08:23.770, Speaker A: And there's a word. Is it merit? Meritocracy.
00:08:23.802 - 00:08:24.562, Speaker C: Meritocracy.
00:08:24.658 - 00:08:29.054, Speaker A: Meritocracy was a very, like, was that the right, like, accurate way of describing it where like.
00:08:30.354 - 00:08:48.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I can add mostly from my recollection. Well, I wasn't, you know, I joined in 2013, so I've kind of mostly know this era from doing archival research and things. But, yeah, it's very different than today. Right. Today you have the idea that bitcoin is this, like, secure investment. It's where you'll keep, like, long term savings. And back then it was the opposite.
00:08:48.010 - 00:09:20.852, Speaker C: Right? Bitcoin was just as Charlie's tweet showed, it was like a funny Internet money. And people sort of believed that their value that they were giving to the network was actually supporting it. Right? Like, they thought that the value of bitcoin was based on the users, the number of people accepting it. So it was this huge cultural pressure or not for, but force to reward people who are doing good for the network. Expanding the number of merchants, convincing people to accept bitcoin, spending bitcoin, right. It was about going forth and spreading the message. Right? And that was a tone, I think, post Satoshi leaving as Gavin Andreessen kind of takes over as lead developer.
00:09:20.852 - 00:10:02.824, Speaker C: And he was the one who. He invented this website program where you could go and you could just claim bitcoin for free. So he was even just giving away bitcoin. So the culture is very different from what you think of today, where it's more like, oh, you don't want to spend your bitcoin. Bitcoin super valuable. Back then it was, hey, we need to build and get more people into this industry by any means necessary. And that came and kind of incubated a wave of startup businesses that by 2013, when I joined and started reporting, it felt like a maturing industry, right? They felt like a zeitgeist thing that was happening because in the early days of the 2010s, Facebook had just gone from a frat house to a billion dollar company.
00:10:02.824 - 00:10:20.324, Speaker C: Skype had gone from a protocol that was kind of niche to. People were using for conversations. You had Google hangouts. So there was this whole tech explosion. Tech was eating the whole world. And bitcoin was a part of that story. And so you asked, well, it was just a four year old currency.
00:10:20.324 - 00:11:20.988, Speaker C: Why did everyone have such sky high expectations? It's because, well, that was the mode of the times, right? That was really the era where in the late stage, social media, you could be like a dorm room company that then was on the s and p 500 in like, two years, right? So there was this when bitcoin really kind of crystallized in early 2013, early startups like Charlie's, I mean, they were like a rock band, right? Like bit instant was like, you know, I remember seeing the early pictures of, like, Charlie and Eric Voorhees and Roger Ver and the people, Ira Miller, who was also involved, right? But they looked like t shirts, scraggly guys, you know, product that's like eating, you know, hundreds of users making millions of dollars off of nothing. So it felt really just like something that was happening. Like, by the time I joined in mid 2013, you know, you really have bitcoin as several hundred dollars. Cyprus, this country that was kind of chains. Yeah, they stole a bunch of people. Well, they conducted a bail in. So the government, you know, sort of seized money from the populace.
00:11:20.988 - 00:11:26.452, Speaker C: This was kind of like a big macro moment of the time, right? So you really had this idea that bitcoin was going mainstream.
00:11:26.628 - 00:11:40.148, Speaker A: They heard the whole country's assets. Like, everyone had money in a cypriot bank account. Like, lost, like, ten or 20% of all their money. They, like, did a bail in. Like you said, it was crazy. And Argentina was going through hyperinflation.
00:11:40.196 - 00:12:03.788, Speaker C: So it was mainstream, like, in the way, like, where you think about today, like, you know, CNN was talking about, like, Charlie was on CNN. I remember seeing, like, Bloomberg was talking about it. Like, it was, you know, it permeated Internet culture. I don't think it was mainstream. And the way bitcoin today is, like, mainstream. You know, people on Wall street are talking about it, but it was very much. It went from like the fringes kind of the early days where Charlie kind of joined to being a part of this Internet story.
00:12:03.788 - 00:12:06.116, Speaker C: You know, in the 2013 era, it.
00:12:06.140 - 00:12:12.504, Speaker A: Definitely, like, fell into the Internet part of the Internet history by, by that time. 2013, 2014 for sure.
00:12:13.244 - 00:12:52.308, Speaker B: Charlie, what about 2012? So when I think about 2013 as a very defining year, because you have a lot of, like, these YC companies, the first, I think, is blockchain.com dot. You have Coinbase, you have the whole Peter Smith and Brian Armstrong and Fred, and they come into the scene in 2013. But there's this 2011, 2012 where there's still, like, I found this fundraise announcement. Brooklyn based bitcoin startup Bitinstant raises seed round, a startup that provides temporary credit in order to make bitcoin transactions faster. Raised an undisclosed sum of seed funding from an angel investor. We sold 15% of our company to Roger Ver, CEO of memory dealers, which is probably the largest used computer parts site on the west coast.
00:12:52.308 - 00:12:53.340, Speaker B: Co founder Charlie Schremmer.
00:12:53.372 - 00:13:04.568, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a crazy. That's when things got real for the first time, because I met Roger and he basically forced Eric Voorhees to join the company too.
00:13:04.656 - 00:13:09.352, Speaker B: What was bitinstant? Let's start there. Tell me about founding bid. What was this company?
00:13:09.488 - 00:13:40.696, Speaker A: So, prior to this article, Bidinstant was a company that I founded in my basement with a co investor. This guy I met on the bitcoin Talk forums, Gareth Nelson, who was this autistic guy, spoke with a very heavy welsh accident, never met him in real life. And he came up with this idea. Buying bitcoin at the time was very hard. You have to wire money into one of these very few exchanges. You have these exchanges, modern day, that we know now. You can connect your ach, you can your debit card, your credit card, or Apple Pay, but you couldn't do any of that back then.
00:13:40.696 - 00:14:18.292, Speaker A: You have to wire money. You'd register for an account and they give you wire details, and you have to wire money to there and then placed like a market order. And it wasn't like retail friendly. So we saw a way to connect all the bitcoin companies and all these exchanges to retail users and started a company called Bitinstant. And it allowed people to like walk into their local bank, whether it was like a Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Chase, or walk into like a 711 at Walmart, at CV's, during the US and the UK and a couple of other countries. And the process was a little bit like cumbersome. You had to go to the website first.
00:14:18.292 - 00:14:36.052, Speaker A: We didn't have an app. There was no web app. This was early Internet time. Still. It was like 2011 saturation. There's no smartphone saturation. You go to the website, you'd type in your information, you'd get a barcode, not even a QR code, like a barcode.
00:14:36.052 - 00:15:02.392, Speaker A: And you'd go to the location and they'd scan it, you'd give them the money, but you'd have, like, this was pretty quick. That's what it looked like. You'd have the money. Or you can choose to actually buy bitcoin from the website directly, like bitcoin sent to your email address. So you'd get, in 20 minutes, you'd get an email saying you have 1.3 bitcoin for your $20 purchase or whatever it was. Or some people bought 2000 bitcoin for a couple hundred dollars.
00:15:02.392 - 00:15:16.060, Speaker A: Yeah. And we also offered arbitrage between all the exchanges, which I'm surprised isn't a business today. No one offers that, like be able to hold balances on all the crypto exchanges at once and do some sort of arbitrage. Like, no one.
00:15:16.132 - 00:15:18.044, Speaker C: That's tethers business, isn't it?
00:15:18.124 - 00:15:32.284, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you can tether in and out of it, but there's still like, you know, it takes time to send, to send transactions and get it confirmed in a exchange. You can front run a lot of different type of trades if you can have instant balances or so, Charlie, anyone.
00:15:32.324 - 00:15:49.636, Speaker B: Anyone watching on YouTube, I guess, can see this in podcasts. People are just going to have to listen. But we've got the bid instant website pulled up here. So you basically go to the site, you've got pay from Mount Gox coupon, vouchex coupon or BTCE coupon. Pay to mount Gox, bitcoin to email. Paypal is on here. Bit stamp, ver walks.
00:15:49.636 - 00:15:57.420, Speaker B: I don't know what that is. Or bitcoin address. So this was basically, bit instant was essentially the best and easiest way to get bit. To get bitcoin back then.
00:15:57.492 - 00:16:10.072, Speaker A: Yeah, most people did the cash deposit option and we go to like, a physical location, infamously use like a red phone, and they'd be able to buy bitcoin. It would go into their wallet within like 20 minutes. And that was a good deal.
00:16:10.128 - 00:16:26.680, Speaker C: I would just add that it was super hard. Even when I joined, by May 2013, people were like, oh, you know, why didn't you buy bitcoin? It was $50. It was, it was difficult. I mean, you know, the only other options, like, I think other than bid instant was like, people. You would meet people on the street. You go to local bitcoins. You know, you could find some local dealer.
00:16:26.680 - 00:16:55.254, Speaker C: I remember going like, bitcoin. These were like local meetups where people would sell you coins. Coinbase was a wallet then. They weren't even selling bitcoin until late in 2013. They had a waitlist. And then if you were using one of these exchanges, the alternative to bit instant would have been like, I remember funding BTCE. So, like, I would have gone onto this website, had this, like, sketchy third party russian payment processor, and it's like, I'm going to send $5,000 to, like, a.
00:16:55.254 - 00:17:04.018, Speaker C: A website that I can't even read and, like, hope that it ends up on a financial exchange in Japan so I can buy this Internet money. Like, there's just, you know, you're lucky.
00:17:04.066 - 00:17:09.098, Speaker A: To lose money on BTC. It was a crazy exchange that came back from that. That's another story.
00:17:09.186 - 00:17:16.162, Speaker C: That's a whole other thing. But yeah, that was an exchange where, like, on the main homepage there was just a chat box where people were.
00:17:16.178 - 00:17:35.930, Speaker A: Just like, yeah, the troll box. That's another thing that all exchanges had. And I really, truly miss the troll box because you can get really good trading alpha from the troll box. Every exchange had it. You have to have an account there and people would just post and it would just be like a rolling chat of like, yeah, I mean, it seems.
00:17:35.962 - 00:17:40.826, Speaker C: Janky as all hell, like right now. Like, like saying, so what were people.
00:17:40.890 - 00:18:07.414, Speaker B: Okay, so you get the bitcoin. What were people doing with the bitcoin? Did people want to, I would assume there's kind of two buckets of people with the bitcoin, or maybe three buckets. There's the, like, there's the very technophile people who just like, want to participate in this, like, funky network that's kind of taking off. That's one bucket. There's another bucket maybe who could, who wanted to do this for an investment purpose, and then there's another bucket who wanted to actually spend it on.
00:18:08.514 - 00:18:10.922, Speaker A: That's a whole other bucket of what they want to spend it on.
00:18:10.978 - 00:18:25.234, Speaker C: There's a big narrative at the time. Maybe this digs a little bit into the Satoshi emails, right? Where like, essentially because the network was small, it was free to send transactions basically free. Right. So this idea really kind of took. Payments were free, right.
00:18:25.274 - 00:18:27.642, Speaker A: I never took fees seriously to later on.
00:18:27.738 - 00:18:59.922, Speaker C: Well, yeah, it's funny actually, from the emails that came out the news, Toshi emails, you know, you can kind of see him in the background, and he actually even takes steps to, like, reduce, you know, the presence of fees within the app. So, you know, we have this idea now that fees are super important for bitcoin, that they're super important for the health of the network. I think that's all well reasoned, won't rehash that. But, you know, essentially, people thought the network was free. And, you know, there was this idea that bitcoin would be competitive against credit cards. So, you know, essentially, you know, whether it was industries like porn or gaming, gambling, this idea that, like, you know, bitcoin could be electronic cash, right? You could go to these websites heavily.
00:19:00.018 - 00:19:18.466, Speaker A: Every speech I gave push that narrative. I went to all. All the conferences. You asked what 2012 was. Traveling to Europe to China, gambling conferences, constantly traveling with Eric and Roger and all these different people. Like you said, Pete, the narrative was like we were going to compete with the alternative financial system.
00:19:18.530 - 00:19:20.162, Speaker C: Visa and Mastercard was free.
00:19:20.258 - 00:19:31.222, Speaker A: The coin was free. It always was free. It's still for the value that you get. It's still kind of free because now you get a crazy, secure network. Yeah.
00:19:31.238 - 00:20:10.610, Speaker C: It was just a different mode of thought. This is something that I talk a lot about and why I write about the history is, I think people who come in, as you were saying, who are new to bitcoin or new to crypto, every era has a different flavor. And I think as we're learning about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole, what you'll find is that every era sort of, like, has their own thesis, and, like, they're kind of right about some things and they're kind of off about other things, right? And so the 2013 era was really this idea that, like, you know, people thought bitcoin was a payments network, they viewed it as essentially being a decentralized PayPal. That's kind of how it was colloquially referred to. That wasn't really how Satoshi referred to it. But again, this was sort of came from people using it that way.
00:20:10.642 - 00:20:10.810, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:10.842 - 00:21:01.392, Speaker C: That is how people were using it. And so the culture really was focused on merchant adoption, was focused on people buying and selling goods. And so the bullish things, like, if you think about today, like, people would retweet, like, ETF's being bought, right? Like, that's bullish today. You know, bullish back then would have been like Charlie standing in a bitcoin booth next to the PayPal booth and, like, kind of giving them the finger because you know, they were being the disruptive thing. Right? So, like, there was a whole kind of culture around, we're going to out compete the banks, we're going to outcompete PayPal, we're going to be the way commerce is conducted on the Internet. And there was a huge other element that would miss, which was like, the Silk Road, where essentially, like, you know, not even, like, you know, gray market payments, but straight up black market payments in a lot of respects of, you know, people selling guns and weed and psychedelics. You know, this was really also the era of the Internet with, like, WikiLeaks and, you know, the Arab Spring.
00:21:01.392 - 00:21:06.112, Speaker C: And there was this idea the Internet was really kind of like a political force. And I think Silk Road was like.
00:21:06.128 - 00:21:30.848, Speaker A: Kind of, oh, that was a big narrative, too. Great point. So there was. The Arab Spring happened in, like, it started in 2012, I think. And that was a big part of the narrative, too, because the Internet was being targeted by these countries and being shut down. And bloggers were. Back then, bloggers were the only way to, you know, bloggers in the early version of Twitter was the only way to get things out from what was happening in some of these places.
00:21:30.848 - 00:22:04.092, Speaker A: With the protests, they were shutting down the Internet. The idea of that bitcoin couldn't be differentiated from any other type of traffic. And, Pete, it's really good that you brought that up because that was the first time we thought, hey, could bitcoin be used for other things? Maybe data? Like, maybe if you can't differentiate bitcoin traffic, maybe you can't differentiate, block bitcoin data. Bit message something. There was, like, things that were being worked on that were trying to, like, already start to use bitcoin for other things other than money. But it was still very early.
00:22:04.268 - 00:23:05.156, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, you have to remember, like, I always like to think about, like, the number of people in the network, right? So, like, in 20, 10, 22,009 if you're reading the Satoshi, like, there's like 100 people there, right? So by the time Charlie's in, like, you know, there's basically bitcoin's like $30 or some businesses, it's maybe like 10,000 people. 2013. Now we're talking about, you know, that doubles and triples, and you're at probably somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of bitcoin users around the globe, right? Whereas today we're in the million. So there is this interesting kind of effect that I think we still see in bitcoin and crypto, where it's like, the number of new participants come in and it increases above the level, you know, so the new people outnumber the old people, and they come with, like, a different idea. And sometimes they're given a certain message about what bitcoin or cryptocurrency should be, and they sort of define the narrative. So there's this interesting kind of yin and yang between the cultures. And I do think there's always, like, a friction, right? Like, there are, like, things that we've learned in different eras, and it's, you know, that becomes messaging, and then certain people get stuck on that messaging, and they don't want to kind of learn about how things are progressing.
00:23:05.156 - 00:23:07.304, Speaker C: So that's the danger that I think about.
00:23:07.844 - 00:23:15.286, Speaker A: It's definitely a minority now. What. What mattered in the history. And a lot of people don't care as much as they used to.
00:23:15.390 - 00:23:34.474, Speaker C: I think it's still so early, though, man. I still think that we're still learning, like, foundational stuff about what's happening. I feel like we're only, like, three or four years in, really. When you think about, like, the having cycle sort of being, like, you know, epochs, like our one year. I don't know, I sometimes I think that, like, how much have we really learned cumulatively?
00:23:34.974 - 00:23:52.712, Speaker B: Charlie, take me into, um. I want to bring it back to bidinstance. So Rizzo said, you know, the exciting thing would be Charlie kind of giving the. Giving the bird to the. To the PayPal booth. And I found this picture of you. I think this is Eric Voorhees and Roger ver with your bidinstant booth right next to a PayPal booth.
00:23:52.712 - 00:24:04.120, Speaker B: So maybe use this picture to tee off a conversation around, like, okay, so bits, bit, instant, you started with this guy who you've never met on the Internet, and then somehow there's the Winklevoss twins get involved.
00:24:04.192 - 00:24:27.756, Speaker A: Back then, the idea of disrupting money was still. You'd be laughed out of the room. There was only the incumbents, which were PayPal, basically. And then you had the banks. So that picture that you see, there was the first money 2020 conference, which took place in May 20. Twelve. And the idea was like, okay, we're going to talk about what money is going to look like in 2020 and call it money 2020.
00:24:27.756 - 00:24:41.232, Speaker A: And it was just, that room was all incumbents. It was. No one knew. You couldn't disrupt money at all. There was no. The concept of sending money from person to person didn't exist. It was so new.
00:24:41.232 - 00:25:11.922, Speaker A: Even sending wire transfers, sending your friends money, you had to register for a PayPal account, add money to that. And then your other friends did, too. And it was like a week to get money on and off that you guys remember. So it was like no one else was disrupting money. And I don't even know what PayPal was doing there. And the idea was PayPal, I think, had just canceled our relationship with them at the time. They were allowing us to let people sell bitcoin and withdraw into PayPal.
00:25:11.922 - 00:25:31.824, Speaker A: And we were really pissed off. So Roger wrote an email. He said, look at this big money conference going on in Las Vegas. Let's get a booth. Let's tell them we want a booth right next to PayPal. I was like, we look at the prices and it was ridiculously expensive. And I was like, no way can we afford this.
00:25:31.824 - 00:25:38.608, Speaker A: Roger, you're my only investor. So I don't think the Winklevoss twins were involved yet at that time. I don't remember.
00:25:38.776 - 00:25:43.364, Speaker C: That would have been like October 2012, probably. So maybe they would have just been in the conversation.
00:25:43.824 - 00:26:08.858, Speaker A: Yeah. And so we could kind of, like, we're more advocating for bitcoin. Like you said, all the positive narratives that we were advocating for and all we could afford was that little, like, lamp post. As you see, it had no chairs, no behind area. It was just that little, like, desk. It was like a, like an information desk. And our logo, bit instant, was super small, but it was all about bitcoin.
00:26:08.858 - 00:26:35.634, Speaker A: But what was cool, as I remember that day, I met, Jesse Powell came over, who created Kraken. He came over, Jed McCaleb came over in his sweatpants. I met him for the first time. And there were some other people actually met this famous lawyer. She's very. She's very well known and hired all over the bitcoin community. Now, she came over me for the first time because I was on stage there and I was very firebrand.
00:26:35.634 - 00:26:57.470, Speaker A: Like, bitcoin's going to take over the world and bitcoin's going to end the fed and we're going to completely take monetary policy out of the hands of the government and put it back in the hands of the people. And there are obvious government people on that stage. And she came over to me and she's like, you know, you need to tone down you're rhetoric, young man. You're gonna go to jail.
00:26:57.542 - 00:26:58.654, Speaker B: You're rhetoric.
00:26:58.774 - 00:27:03.074, Speaker A: And she was right. Like, I got arrested maybe like a year later or something. So.
00:27:03.814 - 00:27:13.054, Speaker B: So, um. Okay, so tell me how Eric Voorhees got involved with bit instant. Roger wasn't Eric a real estate sales guy in Dubai.
00:27:13.174 - 00:27:35.390, Speaker A: Yeah, Eric was selling real estate in Dubai. He was like, this brilliant person that just was in doing the wrong thing, because what he was brilliant in wasn't. There was no money in it. There's no money in libertarianism. You know, writing back before bitcoin, there were no, there was no influencers. There were no followers. You know, you couldn't really monetize that podcast didn't exist yet.
00:27:35.390 - 00:27:57.168, Speaker A: So Eric is kind of, like, just out there. And Roger met him. Roger had a snack of meeting of some really brilliant people and bringing them all together. And Roger told me, you need some help. Hire this guy, Eric. And I was like, you can't tell me what I can do with my company's budget. And he's like, well, I'm going to pay for him, and I'm going to.
00:27:57.168 - 00:28:18.160, Speaker A: He's going to be the chief marketing officer of bit instant. We ended up hired, so he flew to New York, and we instantly became best friends. Like, instantly, we were more than just people that we worked together. We were. We became best friends. He got an apartment in New York City. He introduced me to another one of his friends, Ira Miller, who became, like, another developer at Bidinstan, like, a number two we badly needed.
00:28:18.160 - 00:28:29.764, Speaker A: So Roger was really instrumental in that. But Eric started that pull away from me. Eric and Roger used to joke that I was a statist, you know, because I grew up in a very conservative type of jewish community.
00:28:30.104 - 00:28:33.664, Speaker B: And your family was. You guys grew up orthodox, right?
00:28:33.744 - 00:28:55.198, Speaker A: Very orthodox. Very, like, like, and, you know, like, and that means kind of like they. They believe that their way of thinking or they. Their way of following the religion is the only way. Anyone who doesn't follow their way is kind of, like, not on their level. It's not really a good way to live. Bitcoin, the community was like, the anti that it was.
00:28:55.198 - 00:29:15.402, Speaker A: Again, going back to, like, your contribution to the bitcoin community is what your. What your status is in the bitcoin community. And so it was very easy to weed out the fake people and stuff like that. There's actually kind of around the same months that I. That I met Courtney at EVR. So going back to New York City. So now we have New York City 2013.
00:29:15.402 - 00:29:25.254, Speaker A: You had the bid, instant offices. It was the only place that bitcoin, you could hang out. Eric was there. We had, like, bitcoin poker stuff going on.
00:29:26.114 - 00:29:27.762, Speaker B: You got. You guys started this club, right?
00:29:27.778 - 00:29:59.664, Speaker A: Charlie, my friends from high school started this nightclub, and Eric and I, and I think my friend from high school, Alex, who started it, was looking to buy some bitcoin. So I told him, I'll trade you some bitcoin for, like, equity in the club. And then I made it, struck a good deal. And Eric Voorhees was like, well, I'll join in on that deal. And Yifu Guo, who founded the first ASIC, was like, well, I'll join in on that deal, too. So we all became nightclub owners, like, overnight of EVR. And the cool thing about it was that we got EVR to accept bitcoin.
00:29:59.664 - 00:30:17.716, Speaker A: That's. That's probably, like, in the other. If there's another picture you have of the New York Post, there's a picture of the New York Post bitcoin accepting at EVR, and that's actually Courtney doing the transaction. She did the first ever transaction at the. And that's how we met. She was doing that transaction at EVR. Right.
00:30:17.740 - 00:30:18.676, Speaker C: There it is.
00:30:18.820 - 00:30:19.732, Speaker B: This you, Court?
00:30:19.868 - 00:30:20.544, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:21.084 - 00:30:30.060, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Yeah, I saw mine. I know. I never went to EVR. I heard EVR was like, all the bitcoiners were hanging out there. Fred Wilson from Union Square venture, Waxman.
00:30:30.092 - 00:30:37.020, Speaker A: In that picture, is that. Is that David Waxon Z is the one that was doing the transaction.
00:30:37.172 - 00:30:37.904, Speaker B: Wow.
00:30:38.484 - 00:31:00.492, Speaker A: So watching that info wallet, that was the wallet back then. It was only while Roger was, like, an owner in that wallet. And those were kind of like. Like, Peter, like you were saying, it was. Was transactional. Like, people would come in and spend, like, 10,000 bitcoin on, like, a glass of, you know, like, a bottle of champagne. And it was beautiful because bitpay facilitated that transaction.
00:31:00.492 - 00:31:13.824, Speaker A: Bitpay took almost no fees, like, less than 1%, and then they instantly converted into dollars. But we, you know, the club kept the bitcoin, and there were no chargebacks.
00:31:14.284 - 00:31:25.348, Speaker B: Yeah, this says the fluctuations don't concern us because we're not holding it anyways. We're just using it as currency. I still get the same amount of money either way. Staff at UVR use tablets to pull up a service called bitpay, which functions.
00:31:25.396 - 00:31:35.660, Speaker A: Like a credit card processor mentioned in this article. Like, you, you just. Everyone's converted that guy. Gabe Sukenick. I don't know if you know Gabe. He works. Still works for.
00:31:35.660 - 00:31:46.904, Speaker A: For Iret coina pulse, which is a bitcoin company. You know, there are so many of these bitcoin companies that are dormant now. They just have bitcoin on their balance sheet, and that's how they survive over the years, like bitcoin.
00:31:48.484 - 00:32:00.752, Speaker B: So Roger ver invested, he gets Eric Voorhees to come in. Did Barry Silver, do you guys ever talk to Barry? Because I know Barry was also kind of getting things off the ground then. Did Barry ever invest? Did you ever talk about.
00:32:00.788 - 00:32:32.260, Speaker A: Yeah, so if, like, if you were to imagine, like, Eric was the Jesus or Roger was the Jesus, but Eric was more. Was the more on the ground in New York. And then I was the, this is how you're going to make money from it person. And we would just go and orange pill these people. Barry Silbert, the Winklevoss twins. And we would hand each other off, like, in the email threads, like, they would write these long winded questions, and I was like, Eric, you handle these. Like, and he would say, charlie, you handle these.
00:32:32.260 - 00:33:22.416, Speaker A: And we would kind of tag team it. And there were all sorts of questions from technology questions, which. And then he handled more economic questions. And we had the guys, like Matthew Mellon, who passed away, who was an early investor in ripple, and board member, and Barry Silbert, never forget, there was a coffee shop downstairs from our office in Flatiron district, and we would meet them. Meet them there every week. And Barry doesn't, you know, for whatever, like, let's put everything that happened is happening now completely aside because that's crazy stuff. But what Barry did back then was really legitimize bitcoin as an investment and asset class to a lot of VC's, like, first mark capital, and a lot of these early, like, people.
00:33:22.416 - 00:33:27.096, Speaker A: He, you know, he had second market, and he was the first one doing this, like, you know, token.
00:33:27.200 - 00:33:53.828, Speaker C: Like, yeah, Barry would have been a big deal, right? Like, Barry would have been someone who was already on the COVID of Bloomberg. Yeah, he was already, like, a well known guy because second market was essentially talk. Going back to, like, that Internet narrative, right? Like, his claim to fame was. He, you know, Facebook was an illiquid stock for a long time. He created a market where people could essentially sell, like, employees could sell stock on a secondary market. So, yeah, he was already like, you know, he had his Bloomberg cover. He had made his millions.
00:33:53.828 - 00:33:57.172, Speaker C: Established person, right. Very different than, like, kind of some of the other folks.
00:33:57.308 - 00:34:15.748, Speaker B: And then the. And then the Winklevoss twins come into this. And my understanding is, Charlie, that they're on the beach in Ibiza. You have, like, a friend or family friend who's a dentist. He sees them on the beach in Ibiza, and he. This is the rumor store. I don't know if it's true or not, but he sees them, gives them his chairs, basically.
00:34:15.748 - 00:34:29.476, Speaker B: He gives them his chairs and says, but wait, I'll give you my chairs and Ibiza. If you take this call with my buddy back in New York who's going to tell you about this thing called bitcoin. And the wiggle boss twins are like, I'll. I'll take the call because I want the chairs in Ibiza. Because you can't get chairs in Ibiza.
00:34:29.500 - 00:34:30.012, Speaker C: Is that.
00:34:30.108 - 00:34:34.228, Speaker A: Ben Masrick did not have to elaborate on that story one bit.
00:34:34.276 - 00:34:34.668, Speaker C: That is.
00:34:34.716 - 00:34:37.124, Speaker A: It is exactly the truth.
00:34:37.204 - 00:34:37.676, Speaker B: Wow.
00:34:37.780 - 00:34:42.220, Speaker A: David literally just called me out of the blue one day, and I knew he was.
00:34:42.252 - 00:34:42.748, Speaker C: He was already.
00:34:42.796 - 00:35:04.616, Speaker A: David was committed to investing, like, as the 1.5 million already, along with Roger Rogers, a little more money in. David's dad was my dentist. We met at some, like, New York City tech fair. So there was already, like, a relationship there. We were part of the same, like, jewish community. And, like, a couple of weeks later, I knew he was on his honeymoon in Ibiza.
00:35:04.616 - 00:35:19.030, Speaker A: Like, he got married, went on his honeymoon, called me. Like, why is David calling me? He's like, charlie, I remember the winkle. Like, talk slow. Remember the. Remember the Winklevoss twins from. From Facebook movie? I'm like, yeah. He goes, they're here with me right now.
00:35:19.030 - 00:35:35.030, Speaker A: Convince them bitcoin is the future. I was like, all right. It's like, Eric, get fucking the office. And like, I had them on speaker and Eric was right there. And we, like, fielded. They came with very good questions. I think they may have heard about bitcoin already, to be honest.
00:35:35.030 - 00:35:38.764, Speaker A: Or maybe I don't remember, but they didn't. They were very smart.
00:35:40.464 - 00:35:43.112, Speaker B: And then you. And then you partied with them in New York and then they invested.
00:35:43.168 - 00:36:03.060, Speaker A: They came to New York. They came to New York. They came to the office one night. I like, I was like, I'll never. I don't know if we'll ever meet them ever again. So let's just, like, strategically have them meet us on, like, a Friday night at the office at like, 05:00 so maybe we'll, like, what are they doing on a Friday night? We'll hang out with them. Because they were celebrities.
00:36:03.192 - 00:36:20.180, Speaker C: Yeah. They would have been in a different position than Barry, though, because I think, like, Barry was someone who had legitimacy as well. Whereas the Winkle boss were really trying to break in. Right. Like, Facebook was a big black eye for them in a lot of respects. Like, they were, you know, trying. They were looking for a way to get back into the, you know, glitz and glamour of the VC world.
00:36:20.180 - 00:36:23.484, Speaker C: Right. Because Mark. They were kind of the villains in Mark Zuckerberg story.
00:36:23.644 - 00:36:42.134, Speaker A: The rift, the rift between Barry and Cameron and Tyler really started then, actually, like in the early days. It's going on right now, but it's, that rift started over, but instant, actually, because the Barry and those guys wanted to invest and Cameron and Tyler just kind of came in at the last minute and it was a whole thing.
00:36:44.034 - 00:37:18.114, Speaker B: All right, I mentioned them in the pre roll. Now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees, and we're really excited to have teamed up with arbitrum for the next couple of months on Empire. As the leading Ethereum scaling solution, arbitrum now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, perps, nfts, gaming, and a whole lot more. The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions.
00:37:18.114 - 00:37:51.276, Speaker B: The way the team got me excited was through portal Arbitrum IO. So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on a screen. It's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks.
00:37:51.276 - 00:38:36.648, Speaker B: If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address, or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered. Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm.

So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO, forward slash empire.
00:38:36.648 - 00:39:03.572, Speaker B: That's Harpy. H a r p I e IO empire. If you want it to be even easier, just click the link in the show notes this episode is brought to you by Monad. Monad's thesis is simple. The EVM is here to stay, similar to JavaScript and web two. But unfortunately, today's EVM lacks the high performance and the scalability that developers need to make certain applications possible. Monad addresses these concerns in these bottlenecks while preserving seamless EVM composability.
00:39:03.572 - 00:39:30.422, Speaker B: For application developers, there's a seamless transition to Monad as the ethereum RPC API allows for really easy portability. And for developers, Monad can support 10,000 real transactions per second with their unique parallel execution environment. And of course there's full compatibility with EVM bytecode. Monad's internal devnet is live public. Testnet comes out soon. You can join Monad's journey in two ways. One, go follow them.
00:39:30.422 - 00:39:46.962, Speaker B: They're on Twitter, on a d, underscore xYz, and also join the Monad discord. It's discord gg Monad. Big thanks to Monad for sponsoring him empire. So the Winklevoss d berry riff started around bit instant.
00:39:47.018 - 00:39:49.242, Speaker A: Yeah, it started over bit instant, probably. Yeah.
00:39:49.258 - 00:40:04.934, Speaker B: Yeah. So what, um, maybe switching gears for a second from bit instant, what was the like, kind of state of mining here? Um, like was there, was there a mining industry? Like were there institute, was there, were there any companies doing mining? Like, were you guys mining? What did, what did this?
00:40:05.394 - 00:40:07.050, Speaker A: Pete knows better. You know, Batman better.
00:40:07.082 - 00:40:39.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I can take the mining question. Yeah. Mining then was very much like a home affair, right? Like most people were mining with, they hadn't really made the jump to asics yet. So this would be the specialized hardware that you have now. So people were mining with gpu's and like, there was essentially, you know, you have people within their garages, people who had like extra rooms and their apartments. There's a great video of like Marshall long, like showing you how to make milk crate miners. There's actually a post that I dug up recently where like some guy, he had so many minors in his room that his mom found him because like he fainted, he had a heat stroke.
00:40:39.866 - 00:41:01.038, Speaker C: Like, he had to go to the hospital. This was so hot in his room. There were so many miners. And then he quit. He sold all of his equipment on the Internet. So yeah, it was very much like a hobbyist effort. So Yifu Guo, who I think, you know, I'm glad Charlie brought up because I think he's a unfortunately kind of forgotten kind of, you know, mythic figure from that era, you know, he's the first one who commercializes the ASIC.
00:41:01.038 - 00:41:09.190, Speaker C: Right? And so I think Satoshi has some writings on this. I think there was always foreseen that someone would make a chip that was just actually specialized for bitcoin hash cow.
00:41:09.262 - 00:41:11.556, Speaker A: What did Satoshi say about it? I didn't.
00:41:11.740 - 00:41:55.596, Speaker C: So there's a post where if you're, you know, so now we're getting into the lore of, like, the Lazlo's emails where essentially, you know, Satoshi Lazlo was the first one to mine with the GPU, right? So he, he figured out that rather than mine with his pc, he can actually take a graphics card, which is a bit of a higher processing capability, and then actually retrofit it to mine bitcoin. And at that point, Satoshi reached out to Laszlo and said, hey, you know, glad you're doing this, but, you know, there's this gentleman's agreement now for people that like, you know, we should have as many people be able to join the network. So, you know, Satoshi kind of put the kibosh on that a little bit or at least like, chided him. But, yeah, that was the first real step advance in mining. And then this would have been the next step advance. Right. So you would have had.
00:41:55.596 - 00:42:15.534, Speaker C: Now you had a dedicated machine. I think I tweeted about this machine recently where it was the first ASIC ever. And, you know, at that point, that single machine probably could have mined one bitcoin a day. So. Sorry, one bitcoin block. So you would have had 25 bitcoin per day that that machine was minting when it was added to the network because that's how powerful it was. Comparable to the GPU's.
00:42:15.534 - 00:42:50.964, Speaker C: Right? Because GPU's are essentially chips that were made for video gaming, that were made for hash calculations. And so Yifu found himself in an interesting scenario. I'm actually wondering what color Charlie has on this because essentially he has the most powerful machine in the world for, like, mining. And then he had to figure out what to do with it because, you know, he could have just sat there with his one machine and just dominated the network. But he, I think from what I recall from talking to him, like he wanted to decentralize bitcoin. He kind of felt this pressure to get these out there before the bad guys get them because, you know, essentially, like, had there been some malicious, you know, force that found it, there could have been something that happened.
00:42:51.424 - 00:43:13.954, Speaker A: Yeah, you fu. Sat in that corner in the office every day. He grew up like, a couple blocks away from me in Brooklyn. Like, just so crazy coincidence that we shared, you know, instead of taking we shit, we would take the train to the city, to the office every other day. But sometimes we would share it. Like, I would drive him. And that's the only reason I had that first ASIc that he's showing in that video there is because I had a car and he.
00:43:13.954 - 00:43:16.190, Speaker A: I know. What a crazy. This.
00:43:16.222 - 00:43:17.478, Speaker B: You fu. In this video, Charlie?
00:43:17.526 - 00:43:19.806, Speaker A: Yeah, he's right there in the beginning of it, holding up his.
00:43:19.910 - 00:43:22.646, Speaker B: And you guys were young. He was like 23 at this time, right?
00:43:22.710 - 00:43:24.846, Speaker A: Yeah, my age. Exactly the same age you would have been.
00:43:24.870 - 00:43:27.428, Speaker C: Dropped out of college, I think, too. He was NYU, maybe.
00:43:27.526 - 00:43:29.208, Speaker B: And what. And what happened to him now?
00:43:29.296 - 00:43:30.164, Speaker A: So he.
00:43:31.824 - 00:43:33.244, Speaker B: Or we skip.
00:43:34.184 - 00:43:39.680, Speaker C: Well, no, he did the right thing. Like, I think if it was one of those guys who, like, I don't know. Charlie, do you want to tell the story? Or I can.
00:43:39.752 - 00:43:47.244, Speaker A: No, no, go for it because I. A lot of things happened and a lot of ends got closed while I was sitting in prison in like 2014. 2015.
00:43:47.824 - 00:43:56.376, Speaker C: Yeah. Yifu stayed around and contributed for a long time. I'd say probably until, like, 18 or 19. You know, he helped host the bitcoin mailing list for a long time. Like, he was a, you know, great.
00:43:56.400 - 00:43:58.704, Speaker A: Contributor, but for a while. Right, too.
00:43:58.824 - 00:44:08.992, Speaker C: What'd you say? He was at Kraken for a while. Yep. Yeah. But, yeah, his. So, you know, he basically, again, he found. He created this miner, right. It was super powerful, and he had to figure out how to commercialize it.
00:44:08.992 - 00:44:37.366, Speaker C: Right. So we didn't know. We didn't have the mining model you have now where essentially there's companies that make machines, they sell to other large vendors or they mine with themselves. So what you had in 2013 and Yifu really started this was the direct to consumer mining rig model where you could, like, go to his website. You would pre order, like, one to ten rigs, like, how many you wanted. And there was this idea that there would be, like, home mining or garage based mining. So his goal was to decentralize the network and to make a business off of that.
00:44:37.366 - 00:45:03.634, Speaker C: The model proved absolutely horrible. And basically anyone who did it was totally destroyed, because what would happen? You'd have people, when the ASIC went on sale, they spent like 75 to 90 bitcoin on the ASIC, but they're just pre ordering it. And so now 2013 happens, the price goes from $10 up to $1,000. And you have people waiting for months, like six months pre mining, all the machines too.
00:45:04.454 - 00:45:07.430, Speaker A: Getting the machines in and fucking setting.
00:45:07.462 - 00:45:17.414, Speaker C: Up warehouses were just, you know, the forums were just, you talk about like, you know, people want. Today. Yeah, like, people were livid. Like, you had class action lawsuits.
00:45:17.534 - 00:45:19.954, Speaker B: This is when it really started to get crazy.
00:45:20.374 - 00:45:33.454, Speaker A: Were amok. Like you're, if you just stuck around, you had a credibility. If you just didn't scam people and just had a, like a, were involved in a circular economy of bitcoin, you were a good person.
00:45:33.614 - 00:45:57.226, Speaker C: Well, but here's the thing. As Yifu, like, I would just add, like an addendum on him is like, so where the other miners sort of failed and they went to bankruptcy court because they basically tried to, like, you know, when this, once they were failing, spread it out for as long as possible. Yifu saw it a bit early and he ensured that customers refunded. They were actually refunded. And it was like such a controversial thing that he basically pressed his other founders, like, we need to give people back their bitcoin. Like, not their dollars. We need to give them their bitcoin.
00:45:57.226 - 00:46:19.746, Speaker C: He refunded the customers, but through that he was basically kicked out of Avalon. So, like, you know, Canon is now a public company and he doesn't, he never got like his share of those sports. Yeah, that's the sad part of the story. But, like, you know, and I think it's interesting where it's like he really did the right thing. If you think about people who like, manage that situation, like 23 year old kid, huge company, you know, tons of irate customers.
00:46:19.850 - 00:46:52.084, Speaker A: Breaks my fucking heart because. Breaks my heart because he used to sit in the corner of that office and shake his head every VC meeting I had, the Winklevoss twins, David Barry would come in, all these people, you know, our eventual investors. Like everyone except for Roger. He loved Roger, he loved Eric. But anyone who wasn't a true bitcoiner and he could tell the difference, heavenly hated. And he was like, never take money from VC's. He's like, never take money from VC's.
00:46:52.084 - 00:47:15.524, Speaker A: We never do it. We should never do it. We do it all on our own. And he loved, like, Eric, you know, doing the Gl BSc with Satoshi Dice. It was such an unfortunate thing that, like, doing the good thing by refunding people in their bitcoin, he would have to be forced out of the company and ended up republican. He has no credit for that. It's like the saddest story because he saw it happen.
00:47:15.524 - 00:47:19.280, Speaker A: That's the tragedy. He saw it happening and he was.
00:47:19.312 - 00:47:30.832, Speaker C: The most powerful bitcoin miner in the world at that point that the photo was taken, like, he would have been single handedly representing at least, you know, 5% of the network, like, in terms of hashing capacity. Like that one.
00:47:30.888 - 00:47:39.968, Speaker A: He gave these things away for free. The first dozen machines. He let us mine in the office. Right. He didn't charge us for. He. Okay, actually he did.
00:47:39.968 - 00:47:48.688, Speaker A: He. I have a. I found this email the other day. I was saving it from my book, but he charges us 608 bitcoin and it just covered the shipping cost.
00:47:48.736 - 00:47:49.528, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:47:49.656 - 00:47:50.444, Speaker A: For the.
00:47:52.024 - 00:48:08.294, Speaker B: So, okay, so take us maybe a little Rizzo. Maybe you can pull us into. That's like 20 11, 20 12, 20 13. So we've got, like, Peter Smith. And I still don't fully understand the story where, like, Brian starts Coinbase looking for a co founder. Originally it's Peter Smith covers.
00:48:09.554 - 00:48:17.690, Speaker C: So that would have been a different founder. Yeah, Peter Smith was blockchain, which was later. This would have been. Reeves is the main name you're looking for, Peter.
00:48:17.722 - 00:48:18.562, Speaker A: Vestments. Sorry.
00:48:18.658 - 00:48:31.940, Speaker B: No. So, okay, so take us into 2030, because when I take it, when I think about 2013, then you've got like, okay, bit stamp was like, already there for like a year. Kraken was kind of already there for a year. Then you've got Coinbase comes on the market. Yeah. Bitpay was already there.
00:48:32.012 - 00:48:34.388, Speaker A: Memory dealers was also kind of selling some bitcoin.
00:48:34.436 - 00:48:36.908, Speaker C: Yeah. I think you have your first big wave of. Sorry.
00:48:37.076 - 00:48:45.012, Speaker B: It's the first wave of, like, venture backed companies, as I think of it, because YC does these deals with, I think, Coinbase and maybe blockchain.com.
00:48:45.068 - 00:48:49.184, Speaker A: But he was like the first YC guy. He did the first bitcoin.
00:48:51.244 - 00:49:21.326, Speaker C: Yeah. So you really have Silicon Valley coming in 2013. And I would say, like this around MIT, bitcoin clubs, this would have been like bitcoin 2013, the conference in San Jose. There's this kind of big mainstream moment where bitcoin really crosses over into Silicon Valley. And it's the hot Silicon Valley secret. So you have Balaji sorn of boss and Mark Andreessen, Chris Dixon, people who are now associated more with the general crypto movement today, who kind of like, start getting interested in bitcoin and then start funding startups pretty aggressively. Right.
00:49:21.326 - 00:49:53.942, Speaker C: So bit instant would have been funded at that point, but then Coinbase comes out and makes a $5 million round, and then ripple Labs comes out and gets $5 million to do, you know, to take bitcoin's invention even further, quote, unquote, I'm using quotes there. You can't see. But yeah, there would have been essentially this culture clash. Right? And it's interesting because, like, I would have joined Coindesk in 2013. Coindesk was itself like a Silicon Valley backed startup. And essentially it was the first, you know, news outlet for we were then calling digital currency. And the mode of the time really was.
00:49:53.942 - 00:50:30.534, Speaker C: And I don't think I've ever really maybe talked about this, but there was a tacit, like, hey, you should cover these new Silicon Valley folks. And kind of the old guard libertarian type people were sort of quieted down a bit. There was this idea that, oh, the ecosystem was moving past this kind of early stage of very heavy libertarianism, very heavy on, like, the anti war stuff, very heavy on Silk Road. And like, the VC's were sort of coming in, but there was like a bit of a tacit sort of like, oh, well, let's. We're going to clean this up right like that. We're now here and we're going to take everything.
00:50:32.434 - 00:50:37.938, Speaker A: The anarchists, like, vC, like, started to hit butt heads right there.
00:50:38.106 - 00:50:53.434, Speaker B: And it's funny, I was just showing this video of this bitcoin 2013, and it's. It's a lot of. It's. What's striking to me is there's a lot of button down shirts in the room and it. Okay, so this is the Coinbase booth. And then the camera is going to turn a little. So get.
00:50:53.474 - 00:51:00.974, Speaker C: .01 those are the coin desk. Those are the coindesk lanyards because that was the. That was the launch of Coindesk. Yeah.
00:51:01.474 - 00:51:06.106, Speaker B: And so Brian's it. But Brian's in a suit here. Like, Brad, this is sue.
00:51:06.130 - 00:51:14.690, Speaker A: You see Stefan who started. We use coins. He's at the. He's at the ripple booth right now. Manning that. That's who that guy is right there.
00:51:14.802 - 00:51:16.250, Speaker C: Yep. Oh, yeah, Stefan.
00:51:16.322 - 00:51:18.094, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is the sort of.
00:51:20.394 - 00:51:20.746, Speaker C: Coin.
00:51:20.770 - 00:51:27.402, Speaker B: Desk marks the start of like, coindesk, coinbase, ripple. There's this kind of like, Cameron and.
00:51:27.418 - 00:51:43.184, Speaker A: Tyler were manning my booth. So they were like the celebrities of the. Of the conference. And like, for six months, my single life task was putting on that conference. When you don't see is how small it was. We only took up like a corner of that whole fucking room. It was the size of a gymnasium.
00:51:43.184 - 00:51:45.624, Speaker A: So, yeah, swath, it was just like, empty.
00:51:45.704 - 00:51:57.724, Speaker C: I would add one point to that. That's interesting now given, like, the historical revisionism, like, is that there wasn't like a bitcoin and crypto. Like, there wasn't enough people for there to be, like, different cultures. Like, there wasn't enough people to, like, hang out with.
00:51:58.864 - 00:51:59.644, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:52:00.064 - 00:52:07.214, Speaker B: Yeah, look at the tagline. Sorry. I post, I just found a tweet that I posted in 2021 that says.
00:52:07.254 - 00:52:24.670, Speaker A: Yeah, there was no bitcoin or crypto because everything that you can build on bitcoin that no one really talked about yet. None of those companies, even coin lab, was kind of talking about butter coin. It was all. It was all, like, building with the blockchain, I think.
00:52:24.702 - 00:52:52.952, Speaker C: I don't even know if I would say that yet, but there was this, like, idea that there was people doing other experiments. Like, I think, like, peak blockchain mania was like 15, like, late 14. Because I remember the first time I heard someone give a speech about blockchain was Vitalik Buterin and 14 when he launched ethereum. And he was like, no, like, it's the ball about the blockchain. And I was like, the blockchain? Like, what is like, you know, because we were writing about bitcoin for payments. Like, companies like writing things. Like, the original model for Coindesk was just like, oh, we're going to be TechCrunch for bitcoin.
00:52:52.952 - 00:53:20.926, Speaker C: That's it. There wasn't, like, a greater, you know, we're going to, like, analyze all these, like, scientific proposals. You know, by 2017, I was, like, knee deep in, like, you know, reading ten research dissertations every fucking week. But, like, back then, it was like, no, we're going to have a simple model. We're going to be TechCrunch for bitcoin. We're going to cover bitcoin startups and that sort of, like, complexity to the industry, I think, like, really came later. Right? Like, I think 2013, it was still, you know, bitcoin was mainstreaming for payments.
00:53:20.926 - 00:53:36.326, Speaker C: And then some other people had interesting, like, experiments, but they weren't, like, maligned. Like, you weren't like, an outcast for, like, sort of experimenting with something else. It was just like that. They were around, but they were like, you know, like, ripple. Yeah. They weren't commercial. They hadn't launched.
00:53:36.326 - 00:53:56.434, Speaker C: Yeah. There wasn't really an idea that there would be this kind of, like, cryptocurrency ecosystem, like this, this whole kind of expansion. I think there's two more phases from that. It's like the 15 to 16 private blockchain era, and then there's the, like, 2017, like, crypto explosion where, like, everything is a cryptocurrency and everybody in a dog has, like, an ICO.
00:53:56.994 - 00:53:58.282, Speaker A: I remember.
00:53:58.418 - 00:54:10.374, Speaker B: Well, so here, I'm gonna. I'm gonna guide us back into this. Into this. Into the story for a second. So take us into. Okay, so 2013 market runs up from, like, $60 to, like, a $1,000.
00:54:10.914 - 00:54:31.034, Speaker A: It was actually, like, even master coin and omni wasn't until late 2013. Yeah, right after that conference. So, Ted, like, forget tether, but, like, the. The first protocol that were colored coins, that you have colored coins wasn't even proposed till after that. That video that you showed, like, that's how early that stuff kind of was.
00:54:31.654 - 00:54:38.094, Speaker B: Yeah. So then 24. So 2013 is a great year, right? Bitcoin rips from, like.
00:54:38.134 - 00:54:52.110, Speaker C: Yeah, well, there's a tremendous amount of pressure on the industry because, you know, essentially, like, this is where, like, the regulatory conversation really enters the floor. Like, so there was a little bit in 2011 where you really have, like, the first kind of lawmakers come out and say, like, we need to regulate this. Like, silk Road is bad.
00:54:52.182 - 00:55:00.518, Speaker B: Coincides with the. With the price going up. Right. Because so the. The bitcoin price starts January 2013 at like, $13 and runs up to 1300.
00:55:00.566 - 00:55:10.318, Speaker C: But I would say at that point, like, the industry is sort of, like, overwhelmed and ultimately kind of fails with Mac ox. Like, everybody is offline, right?
00:55:10.366 - 00:55:11.542, Speaker B: Industries overwhelmed.
00:55:11.598 - 00:55:13.206, Speaker C: Like, the boat capsizes. Right?
00:55:13.230 - 00:55:35.406, Speaker A: Like, what happened was Mount Gox was the. Was the 99% source of liquidity. Every exchange also getting their quiddity from Mount Gox. I was getting my liquidity from Mount Gox, and we were failing. And we were. Our website broke down. We shut down in May of June of 2013.
00:55:35.406 - 00:55:55.878, Speaker A: Because what happened was the. A couple of things happened. Fincen came out with this guidance. Was the first time the federal government, a couple of months after that conference, said bitcoin is now not like airline miles or gift cards that you guys think it is. It's now money. And you're going to be governed on your money transmission, money service businesses. This is real now.
00:55:55.878 - 00:56:21.378, Speaker A: All you coinbase, you're not selling airline miles, bid instant, you're. You're selling money. And that fundamentally, like, overnight, my lawyers emailed and were like, you got to shut down mid instant. Because we were trying to, like, get the states at that point to give us these no action letters based on that. We were selling gift cards type airline miles. So we were trying to, like, get the opposite of, like, a money transfer license, like a no action letter. Like, you're kosher.
00:56:21.378 - 00:56:42.554, Speaker A: And so not only that, but Mount Gox was rehypothecating. Their bitcoin, they were always running at a fractional reserve. So as demand was growing, Mount Gox didn't have enough real bitcoin as people want. People started to realize that Mount Gox was having withdrawal delays, and people couldn't get bitcoin. They started to withdraw, and the whole thing imploded by.
00:56:42.894 - 00:57:19.800, Speaker C: I would say, like, yeah, mid 2014, like, April 2014. Well, I would say, like, that one adding thing like, that's kind of been scrubbed out is, like, there would have been, like, an extreme, like, lack of confidence, even in the bitcoin price high. So you went up to 1300, but then Malcolm crashed. And the real question, I think, of the time was, like, how much of that trading volume was even real? Because what we learned was, essentially that Malcolm, like, manipulating their own exchange in order to. So essentially, the story of Mount Gox is, like, they were really hacked back in 2011. They essentially ran this fractional reserve exchange for years, kind of hid this and obfuscated it from users. And then eventually they basically were called on this.
00:57:19.800 - 00:57:39.920, Speaker C: They had to shut down. So, yeah, I think it's interesting. That was really the moment where I think the infrastructure was so overwhelmed. But the question was, is bitcoin even legit? Because how can you trust this price history? How do you trust this price discovery? Or was it all fake? Right? Was it all. Was it, you know, ten people on a dog, like, using.
00:57:40.032 - 00:57:49.440, Speaker A: There was a bot in Mount Gox that was buying. Buying bitcoin on behalf of the company to try to slowly recover the gap.
00:57:49.592 - 00:57:51.920, Speaker C: So it was like, 400,000.
00:57:51.992 - 00:57:58.616, Speaker A: Yeah, it was, like, a significant amount. So I was, like, the price of going up. It was also buying up more bitcoin.
00:57:58.720 - 00:58:04.844, Speaker B: And this was the will. This was the willy bot. Right. And who uncut was it? Did Selkus uncover?
00:58:05.504 - 00:58:15.752, Speaker C: No, that's, uh. So the guy who uncovered Willie Bob would have been the guy out of Japan, was the guy who did, like, the background research on it. I can't remember. Wiz. Yeah, Wiz. Okay. Yeah, Ryan.
00:58:15.752 - 00:58:21.084, Speaker C: Yeah, Ryan. That's a. He did break the Malcolm story. That is a thing that Ryan did.
00:58:21.864 - 00:58:22.360, Speaker A: Why do you.
00:58:22.392 - 00:58:23.844, Speaker B: Why do you laugh at that, RZA?
00:58:24.344 - 00:58:35.016, Speaker C: Because the way that that story was released has also been, like, kind of, like, scrubbed out. But it's, like, very important to understand because, like, Ryan didn't break the news. Right. Like, so what Ryan really did is that. And again, we worked.
00:58:35.040 - 00:58:39.304, Speaker A: I was one of the. I was one of his certifiers or whatever. Oh, yeah.
00:58:39.344 - 00:58:42.184, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, I remember. I think I talked to you that night, I think.
00:58:42.224 - 00:58:44.512, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we did. We talked. That that was a crazy night.
00:58:44.568 - 00:58:52.480, Speaker C: But anyway, like, so what this is important to understand because I also, I often say that, like, the crash was, like, Ryan's fault. Like, so I'm just gonna push this out there.
00:58:52.512 - 00:58:53.084, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:53.544 - 00:59:10.262, Speaker C: Like, at 06:00 p.m. He writes a blog and then he's in it. What that blog says is like, he's like, I have evidence to, like, and I have sold all my bitcoin. So, like, so he doesn't publish. He doesn't publish the actual evidence. What he does is he just blogs about it. So it's like, 06:00 p.m.
00:59:10.262 - 00:59:12.182, Speaker C: I'm, like, trying to leave for work, and I'm like, oh, my God.
00:59:12.238 - 00:59:14.878, Speaker A: Well, it's all my faith in bitcoin. I sold all my bitcoins.
00:59:15.006 - 00:59:38.626, Speaker C: Yeah, he's done. And then, so then the market just starts, like, teetering and, like, crashing, and people are like, what's going on is, like, this real whatever. And it isn't until, like, I want to say that I was up until, like, one in the morning where then he posted the real documents. And then the documents, and then there was the reporting. So there wasn't like, there was this like 7 hours of just, like, market and free fall because there wasn't any information. Like, it was just like, he's like, yeah, I found something bad. I've sold everything.
00:59:38.626 - 00:59:40.414, Speaker C: All you like. I'm out.
00:59:41.434 - 00:59:53.234, Speaker A: He wanted to confirm the documents, I think, and that they were real and no one can get anyone in Mount Gox. I saw that post. I sent him a tweet because he was anonymous at the time.
00:59:53.274 - 00:59:55.934, Speaker C: Undernem. Yeah, he would. Too bad.
00:59:57.394 - 00:59:59.744, Speaker B: And he was publishing under Ryan Galt, I think.
00:59:59.834 - 01:00:13.164, Speaker A: Ryan coin, maybe, but he was just too bit idiot. And he was. That was his name, too, but idiot. And he. I sent him a message. I said, send me this document, and I have someone in Mount Gox. He sent me the document, and I.
01:00:13.164 - 01:00:25.684, Speaker A: I knew this guy Gonzag gave Bushiri was like, like Mark's number two. And he sent me like two words. He goes, it's real. Yeah.
01:00:25.724 - 01:00:42.340, Speaker C: And then basically the market just cratered. I mean, I think it went back to like $400 and then that maybe it bounced up to like 600. But it was just, yeah, it was pretty much carnage from the end. 14 was basically just like, you know, regulators basically coming out. You had like, you know, Karpalis was arrested and he's like, paraded in front of japanese authorities and he's just, like.
01:00:42.452 - 01:00:48.812, Speaker A: Publicly apologize on national tv. And that was, like, rebroadcasted and it was the only news.
01:00:48.988 - 01:01:07.378, Speaker C: But then the VC's basically, at that point, like, dropped bitcoin. Like, it was like, you know, the overnight, like, the air was just sucked out of the room. There was, like, no institutional support. Like, you know, you have guys like chamath who before, like, you know, they're in coindesk. DM's on Twitter every day, just gone. Ghosts, like, never heard from again.
01:01:07.546 - 01:01:11.026, Speaker A: You know, there was a. Ross got arrested around that time.
01:01:11.090 - 01:01:12.454, Speaker C: Yeah, Ross was arrested.
01:01:13.994 - 01:01:21.922, Speaker B: And weren't Charlie, weren't you arrested around that time for later? Six months later. So are you comfortable sharing that story?
01:01:22.018 - 01:01:34.278, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. But by the. I want to. By the time I got, like, the same day I got arrested was also the day that Vitalik got on stage and announced Ethereum for the first time. So to give, like, kind of historical.
01:01:34.326 - 01:01:40.574, Speaker B: Context, the day you get arrested is when Ethereum announces, yeah, there's no launch yet.
01:01:40.614 - 01:02:05.854, Speaker A: It's just like a theoretical announcement. This is what we're gonna build over the next couple of years. My name is Vitalik. I'm a writer for Bitcoin magazine. This is what we're gonna do type of thing. But that, like, what Pete's talking about, that was kind of the start. Like, Ross getting arrested, silk Road, the implosion to Mount Gox, the government fincen thing, which basically, effectively was a blanket ban on all american global bitcoin businesses.
01:02:05.854 - 01:02:17.110, Speaker A: And then you. China banned bitcoin at the time, a couple of months. So that started the bear market. That was the official start of the bear market. I shut down bit instant, too. So there was no way to support the bitcoin.
01:02:17.222 - 01:02:38.840, Speaker C: I think it's funny when people ask you, like, how big was it back then? Like, you know, are they, like, there's this kind of idea that the new markets are somehow bigger. But, like, think about some of these things. You had, like, geopolitical entry with, like, bitcoin and Cyprus in the conversation, you had, you know, an all time high that was, like, very obscene $1,000. You had, you know, major market failures like Macox would have been on the par of something like a luna, you know, just like, unthinkable, unheard of.
01:02:38.952 - 01:02:39.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:39.464 - 01:02:48.792, Speaker C: So there's a lot of analogies here, and especially the backlash is, like, you know, very similar to, like, maybe how people were feeling, like, after FTX, right? Like, I think Malcolm X.
01:02:48.808 - 01:02:50.764, Speaker A: That was the same feeling. Yeah.
01:02:51.364 - 01:03:09.276, Speaker C: Right. And you have, like, a mysterious, kind of goofy, like, I don't know. Shit. Healy CEO guy who, like, doesn't seem like he should be doing this as a job, you know? And, like, they're sort of like the, you know, negative effects that take hold in the industry. But it was all consolidated, right? Because there was only one. There was only bitcoin, really. That was the story, right?
01:03:09.300 - 01:03:24.734, Speaker A: And so what it did was it reset bitcoin a little bit back into it, through bitcoin, back into the crypto anarchy area era again. I remember traveling to, like, buenos Aires for, which was a huge thing. It kind of pushed bitcoin outside of the US in a way.
01:03:25.594 - 01:03:31.282, Speaker C: You would have had, like, Amir talkie and, like, Peter would have been, like, a big force at that time. Yeah.
01:03:31.418 - 01:03:46.404, Speaker A: London. Amir talkie. I saw him in London, is a great example. There was a lot more, like, bitcoin positive. Like, it was hangover. It was a hangover. There was a lot, like, what went wrong? What did we do wrong? There was a lot of, like.
01:03:47.264 - 01:04:06.776, Speaker C: Well, and that really starts the block. The block size wars really start at the end of 2014 with sort of Gavin kind of trying to, you know, Gavin really, I think, tries to start, like, a new forward direction for bitcoin around this idea that we'll scale bitcoin and we'll work collaboratively to improve the technology, and that that sort of really, I think, is the opening guns, like, the next era.
01:04:06.920 - 01:04:20.728, Speaker B: Wait, before we go, because that's a really crucial part of this. So before we go there, maybe close out this last era with Charlie, I'd love to hear, like, yes. I mean, when someone show up at your house and they knock on your door and they're like, charlie Shram bitcoin guy going to jail.
01:04:20.856 - 01:04:37.656, Speaker A: So bitcoin. Bitcoin was starting to, like, the price was going down, but there was still a lot of, like, leftover positive media attention. It was growing. There were some, like, good metrics. And I was. I got paid a lot of money to travel to. To Amsterdam for a bitcoin conference.
01:04:37.656 - 01:05:05.070, Speaker A: It's traveling around, man. It was great just doing bitcoin foundation stuff full time. I shut down bit instant because the government made me. But we were, like, trying to get some money, transmitter licenses, and trying to get things going again, and there was, like, positive. I felt like there was some positivity, maybe. There was that first bitcoin, like, 2014 conference that was taking place in early January 2014. So, like, to start off 2014 just right.
01:05:05.070 - 01:05:25.986, Speaker A: We're in this big bitcoin conference. The first major bitcoin conference after in the US after bitcoin 2013. So we were going to travel to that event and everything. And we were traveling home from Amsterdam speaking. Courtney and I were just dating, actually, at the time. And I got home, I was at a. I was doing my customs with my passport.
01:05:25.986 - 01:05:54.180, Speaker A: When you come back into the US at JFK airport, right when I came back, like, as they were doing my passport, like, tons of federal agents, like, all surrounded me and everything. And they, like, all escorted me over to both of us to like a back kind of jail within the airport. And they put me in like a holding cell. And they read me, like, you know, my rights and everything. And then they gave me my arrest warrant and I read what I was being arrested for. And it was like crazy, like five charges. It was really crazy stuff.
01:05:54.180 - 01:06:17.722, Speaker A: Like a lot of like money laundering, failure to file, like, all these crazy suspicious activity reports and not having a money transfer license, all these things. They asked Courtney to, like, check, go get my bags for me. And I had to claim his luggage off the conveyor belt. Yeah, they did that. It was crazy. And then, so I got arrested. I went through like a couple of days in the same place that Sam Bingman fried was in.
01:06:17.722 - 01:06:45.672, Speaker A: As long as I saw that picture. Kind of gave me the heebie jeebies. And then I did house arrest for a couple of months, actually. A couple of months, like a year, right? Like solid eight months almost, of house arrest. From like a time tick I get arrested to time that I could actually go to prison. I pled guilty. But during the year of house arrest, New York City was like a bitcoin mecca.
01:06:45.672 - 01:07:11.504, Speaker A: It was still awesome. There were so many proof of steak dinners. They were like, things happening. Like the bear market was still happening, but there were still things going on. There were still businesses being built and investments happening. And Ripple had launched by this time. When I was going to prison, I didnt think, I really thought that the bitcoin markets would come back.
01:07:11.504 - 01:07:45.634, Speaker A: But from the time of my arrest and even before from a time of like Mount Gox imploding. So the day I walked into jail, all the price did was just go down from a high of 1200 or 1300. To when I walked in, it was like $158. Like, it was going to zero. When I walked in, I just about gave up on bitcoin has a future for me. Walking in there, I was like, all right, Charlie, just get actually made life easier in prison because I was just like, I don't have to think about bitcoin on the outside. And unless I'm telling you, it's $200.
01:07:45.634 - 01:08:17.026, Speaker A: So, yeah, so later on, as I'm in, Courtney's, like, telling me what the bitcoin price, keeping updated with all the news. A lot of people are, like, printing out the front page of, like, our bitcoin, which was on Reddit, the place where everyone hung out on bitcoin. Pre block size war, in the block size war. Kind of broke that up. But people were. There was this guy, Max Raskin, to work for the Wall Street Journal. Thankfully for him, he'd, like, mail me, like, copies, like, of the Wall Street Journal once a month, like, every past 30 day, copies of every.
01:08:17.130 - 01:08:18.138, Speaker B: I didn't know that story.
01:08:18.266 - 01:08:36.776, Speaker A: Yeah, because a lot of people, like, people would send me money. Like, I. You know, because in prison, you have to live on donations. So I. Contrary to popular belief, I. When I left prison, I had almost no money to my name. I had, like, $16,000 worth of bitcoin the day I walked out, you know, so I had to restart from scratch.
01:08:36.776 - 01:09:09.759, Speaker A: I had no money between my lawyers and the $950,000 civil forfeiture that I had to pay back to the government, which I paid, by the way, within the first two years of getting out, because thanks to the 2017 bull market. But I had to restart from scratch everything again. But prison was a complete bear market. But what was interesting was it was like, I still have a box of stuff, and I haven't reopened the box. We call it my prison box. When Pete helps me write my book, finish this thing, then maybe we can open the box. But there's, like, letters of white papers in there.
01:09:09.759 - 01:09:11.583, Speaker A: People wrote, like, handwritten stuff.
01:09:11.623 - 01:09:15.403, Speaker C: Like, remember when you came out? We did the first interview at Quindesk. It was.
01:09:16.463 - 01:09:28.203, Speaker A: Oh, so that was. So let's go back to you and Ryan. So, you and Ryan were, like, the first people that really took me seriously and gave me a platform to reestablish myself and, Charlie, when was this?
01:09:29.044 - 01:09:31.184, Speaker C: March 2017, maybe.
01:09:31.684 - 01:09:34.224, Speaker A: I think it was earlier than that. I think it was 2015.
01:09:34.804 - 01:09:35.380, Speaker B: Really?
01:09:35.492 - 01:09:43.052, Speaker A: I think it was late 20. It was like, I was just out. So it was, like, 2016, maybe 2016. 2016. We moved here.
01:09:43.108 - 01:09:47.948, Speaker C: So, yeah, that would have been, like, New York coindesk office. So 16, maybe, actually.
01:09:48.036 - 01:09:57.896, Speaker A: You went through a coin desk bear market. You were driving around the van for two years. During that time, when I was. You went to your room. Proverbial prison, kind of not a prison.
01:09:57.960 - 01:10:04.864, Speaker C: But, yeah, I mean, I was. Well, that was more of, like, a work remotely. You know, I was taking advantage of that. Me and my buddy bought an rv. We drove around.
01:10:04.904 - 01:10:06.856, Speaker A: You were keeping coin desk running.
01:10:06.920 - 01:10:07.216, Speaker C: Rizzo.
01:10:07.240 - 01:10:24.096, Speaker B: How did Rizzo hear that story? Like, how did. So everyone. Okay, everyone thinks of today, there's a big media space and crypto and there's all these podcasts and block works and coindesk and everyone else. But, you know, back then, it was really just our bitcoin channel. And then you guys were.
01:10:24.240 - 01:10:30.960, Speaker C: Yeah, coin desk. I mean, basically the whole industry, like, whittled down to nothing. Like, I mean, as Charlie was sort of saying, I would say by 15, it was.
01:10:31.032 - 01:10:32.056, Speaker A: Everyone died.
01:10:32.240 - 01:10:42.392, Speaker C: Yeah, everybody was out of, like, everybody left or they, like, did something else. So, you know, if you were in bitcoin in 26, I always say, like, the real bear market was like, 15 and 16.
01:10:42.488 - 01:10:42.832, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:42.888 - 01:11:14.890, Speaker C: Like, if you stuck through that, that was the worst way because it was like, you couldn't even say bitcoin publicly. Like, I remember going to, like, blockchain events in, like, New York and, like, Patrick Byrne would be the one. The CEO of Overstock would be, like, the one guy who said bitcoin. It would be like, hushed in the room and, like, if you were still involved in bitcoin or crypto stuff, it was like you had to wonder, like, what you were doing with your life. Like, you know, it's like there. People were there because, like, maybe you were still getting paid, but it's like, you know, the primary, like, kind of narrative of the industry was really just like, you know, you had the block size war start. So, like, bitcoin is just contention.
01:11:14.890 - 01:12:11.512, Speaker C: It's just like warring factions. You know, it's like all these debates and they're like, super esoteric. So you go from, like, covering, you know, fun stuff, like, about startups raising money and it's like parties and then, like, you know, nerds in a room, like, fighting over, like, whether, you know, the latency and, like, sending blocks over the firewall in China means that the network will be less decentralized. And, like, the other thing is that there's been this post 17 era washing around the block size wars, that it was this great moral controversy, but at the time, it was not fought on moral grounds. The bitcoin core developers, again, were making arguments about Internet bandwidth isn't going to be enough, and we have to think about bandwidth and nodes have to be small. There wasn't any of this stuff that we saw in 17 where there really is the UASF and people running nodes and they're anti startups. There's all these sort of political things that are grafting on it.
01:12:11.512 - 01:12:17.660, Speaker C: Like, back then, it's like a boring technical debate. Like, you know, you're in a room with, like, 30 neck beards that look like James.
01:12:17.732 - 01:12:50.374, Speaker A: Yeah, there was no. There was no fanaticism. There was no, like, sides. I remember, like, reading about in prison, in a prison email. Roger Veer, who's keeping me updated, was like, telling me, yeah, I'm going to Hong Kong about this New York agreement that we're gonna have about, like, I'm like, sounds great. We had a problem with the tech of bitcoin, right? There was no issue yet. It was, like, a foreseeable, you know, issue that ended up coming, but it didn't come yet.
01:12:51.074 - 01:13:16.074, Speaker C: Yeah, it was pretty tough. And, like, for me at coin does, like, you know, like, coin does would have been like, me and another guy, like I said, like, the entire state of, like, journalism, it was me and Stan. Mike McSweeney, editor of the block. Block works fine, fine publication, but yeah, so, yeah, it was me and him. And, like, essentially, like, I had moved out of New York. I moved down to, like, the Caribbean, basically. Like, I spent most of 2014 driving around.
01:13:16.074 - 01:13:30.474, Speaker C: I ended up moving down to, like, St. Thomas. Like, just rented an apartment. I remember, like, being like, you know, like, essentially, like, the old coindesk entity was shutting down. We had done consensus, which was a very famous conference. We went all in on this conference. We were going to make this big conference.
01:13:30.474 - 01:13:44.936, Speaker C: It was going to be like the blockchain thing. We were going to, like, bring the businesses back together. We're going to restart things. We did it in New York. Junie and Wong, who's the architect of that, forced the company to do this big event. We all went pot, committed on it. It was a huge success.
01:13:44.936 - 01:13:58.368, Speaker C: And then we turned around and we were like, oh, fuck. We don't have the money to keep running coindesk. We have to shut down. So our original founder was this guy named Shot Kahn. He was this UK VC investor. He was the one who kind of orange filled Silicon Valley got everybody in. And he's like, look, I don't want to run it anymore.
01:13:58.368 - 01:14:21.500, Speaker C: I'll give it to you guys if you want to run it, or we can find a buyer. He's like, if you don't want to continue it, I'll just shut it down. And I remember market selling with my CEO. We, like, market sold 300 bitcoin at, like, $200. Like, just like, a disgustingly low price. Like, I liquidated the rest of the bitcoin that the company had. And like, yeah, basically, like, I remember being in, you know, the.
01:14:21.500 - 01:14:38.764, Speaker C: And being in St. Thomas. Like, I was going out swimming in the ocean every morning. I was looking out at this amazing beach, and I remember, you know, I was writing about, like, ripple white papers and lightning white papers. And I was like, I can't do this. I gotta do something with my life. And Ryan Selkus calls me up and he's like, hey, bud, how you doing? And I was like, well, not sure about my life.
01:14:38.764 - 01:15:05.292, Speaker C: And he's like, well, look, DCG wants to buy coindesk. We're gonna do it legit. You're gonna come back to New York. I'm looking at this, like, beautiful vista, and I'm like, all right. It's like, it was sort of like one of those, are you in or out? Or, like, do you just fade away and do you just end up, like, on a, you know, being a rum runner on some, like, sort of weird caribbean island? That was the fork in the road. So then, of course, I went back to New York. You know, I met with Barry and those guys, and, like, you know, they essentially, you know, they wanted to take over coin desk.
01:15:05.292 - 01:15:18.184, Speaker C: They were going to do a legit, you know, we had a few other offers. There were other, you know, suitors at the time, Trace Mayer as well. But, you know, essentially, this was like the recapitalization of coindesk into something that, you know, it is today.
01:15:20.084 - 01:15:25.502, Speaker A: That's a name that I. Yeah, Trace was a year or two ago.
01:15:25.668 - 01:15:38.290, Speaker C: He's kind of dropped off. But, yeah, that was. And now, you know, like, the cryptocurrency journalism space is, you know, vibrant and thriving and pretty necessary. But I think back then it was, you know, kept alive by just the will of a couple people that continued.
01:15:38.402 - 01:15:41.538, Speaker B: Almost died because of the bear market and because of the event.
01:15:41.666 - 01:15:51.274, Speaker C: I mean, it effectively wasn't solving. Right. So it did. It did formally fail as a business and has failed since. Right. It's recently acquired by bullish. Right.
01:15:51.274 - 01:15:52.322, Speaker C: So I think.
01:15:52.498 - 01:15:54.402, Speaker A: Oh, I remember that. Yeah.
01:15:54.578 - 01:16:04.002, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, it's been interesting to see it pass through the ages. Yeah. Back then, I mean, coin s was super necessary. Right. I mean, we were, like, during the block size wars, one of the focal points for coverage. Like, we were kind of.
01:16:04.002 - 01:16:09.962, Speaker C: I remember being in the meeting where, like, we had to decide whether we were going to cover ethereum. I actually made the argument that we.
01:16:09.978 - 01:16:14.578, Speaker A: Had, people were mailing coindesk articles to me in prison. I probably have some printed out in that box.
01:16:14.666 - 01:16:16.694, Speaker C: So I think there might be some for me in there.
01:16:17.754 - 01:16:20.826, Speaker B: Let's get into the block size wars. Rizzo, can you kind of tee up this?
01:16:20.930 - 01:16:24.610, Speaker A: I have to use the restroom. When you tee that up really quick. I'm sorry. If we're going to talk, it'll be a.
01:16:24.642 - 01:16:53.530, Speaker C: It'll be a nice. Analogous to what really happened where Charlie was away for the. Yeah, so, I mean, again, like, the industry just kind of collapses, and then Silicon Valley just kind of tunes out. Right? Like, bitcoin is in. It's this hot thing, and then it's out, and it's out in the way that Silicon Valley things are out where it's like, you're like the segue. You know, you're not a thing that people talk about anymore. So, you know, I think that the block size wars are really, essentially, I think, the defining moments of bitcoin history.
01:16:53.530 - 01:18:01.094, Speaker C: And I think, like, to the extent that they've pretty much shaped, to the extent that you have a novel opinion about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as technologies, it was pretty much shaped by 2017. And 2017 is, like, probably the pivotal year, I would say, in the whole story, where, essentially, bitcoin goes through this great schism. There's this intense clash about what bitcoin should be, how should development should be prioritized, what is the point and ethos of bitcoin, and how should that be expressed in technology? And then the other side, you have really the free for all kind of cryptocurrency explosion where, like, it is literally, like, if you have a cat and a white paper, you could have raised $100 million. Like, you know, money really just is falling from the skies for, like, every two bit stupid project that you could even imagine. And, like, that era, I think, is, like, it's hard to condense into any, like, meaningful, you know, you know, summary other than to say, like, two pretty expressly different cultures emerged. There was, like, a group of people who rallied around bitcoin who basically, you know, had this idea that bitcoin was launched in a certain way. It had certain properties by virtue of the way it was created, and those properties were unlikely to be recreated in any other cryptocurrencies.
01:18:01.094 - 01:18:52.804, Speaker C: And then there was this other group that just wanted the freedom of expression and experimentation. And I said something recently, I don't know if it'll resonate with anybody, but I'll say it here. It's that I think it's interesting that the cryptocurrency culture, I view them more as a culture, but they're often misunderstood as a technology sort of revolution, whereas I think bitcoin is more inherently a technology revolution that is misunderstood as a cultural group. Like, there's a. There's a disconnect there, like, where I think that the genesis of a lot of cryptocurrency projects, like, I'd say ethereum, like, pretty much in particular, it's like they really just wanted the space to do new things, and they didn't really much care about what those things were. So, like, a good example would be that, like, you know, why is ethereum proof of stake? Well, bitcoin was proof of work, so they picked something else to, like, experiment on it, right? There wasn't, like, a grand hierarchy of, like, you know, sophisticated ideas. Like, they were a cultural group that wanted separation.
01:18:53.154 - 01:18:57.786, Speaker A: It wasn't until later that they even said, like, proof of stake, right. It was originally even proof of work.
01:18:57.890 - 01:19:32.794, Speaker C: For a long time in the roadmap that there would be a switch. But I think my point was essentially that, like, the genesis of the crypt, if you can think of the modern crypto movement, is essentially this idea to, like, recreate or improve bitcoin. You know, they essentially first established, like, a cultural separation that happened, and then those two groups, like, began working on different technologies. So I don't know. I think that if there is a bitcoin and crypto currently, and though I have serious questions about that, because I think they're probably going to converge again in the not too distant future. Like, that was the genesis of the. And bitcoin went one direction, crypto went the other direction.
01:19:32.794 - 01:19:39.758, Speaker C: And I think since then, you've really had a balkanization. You have two entirely different groups that don't understand each other in any real significant way.
01:19:39.886 - 01:20:11.110, Speaker A: They are converging in a really big way. It's faster than you thought, because there's a huge identity crisis happening with the bitcoin VC funds. I work with a lot of them, and they don't even know how. They don't even know their line is anymore, because there's no such thing as a bitcoin only company now. Every, all these bitcoin l two s are building for ways to, like, scale and do different things and connect with other evms. And, you know, I look at dozens of pitches a day, and so the only bitcoin only cut, like, if you look at some of these bitcoin only VC funds, I mean, blockstream doesn't do anything. The only.
01:20:11.110 - 01:20:15.630, Speaker A: All these companies just hold bitcoin on their balance sheet. That's really the only, like, bitcoin.
01:20:15.702 - 01:20:20.682, Speaker B: Oh, I would take the other side of that, Charlie. We're going to talk more about this with ordinals, but which it will come.
01:20:20.698 - 01:20:24.714, Speaker A: At bitcoin only, though, because every ordinal project. BRC 20.
01:20:24.874 - 01:20:39.706, Speaker B: No, no. I think there's actually. There's a crisis happening with crypto, what I'd call crypto VC's, because a lot of them refuse to invest in bitcoin things. They're basically. Yeah, a lot of them are basically.
01:20:39.770 - 01:20:43.658, Speaker A: Saying, like, dozens of these VC funds. I don't.
01:20:43.786 - 01:20:44.730, Speaker B: I'm gonna. I'm gonna punt.
01:20:44.762 - 01:20:45.002, Speaker C: We're good.
01:20:45.018 - 01:21:02.124, Speaker B: We're gonna save this conversation until the. Till the end of this. Um, Rizzo, can you just, like, one more piece of info about the block size wars? Like Hoover. Yeah, sorry, Hoover's who? What was the argument? What was, like, the argument on both sides? Like, why did the team. The team. I put quotes around the team. The team that won.
01:21:02.124 - 01:21:03.276, Speaker B: Why did they win?
01:21:03.460 - 01:21:12.340, Speaker C: I don't know. That's tough. I don't think you can do that. And I think attempts to do that are pretty unhelpful. I think that there is a lot of historical vision revisionism around.
01:21:12.372 - 01:21:15.216, Speaker B: Why can't you do that? Why can't you say, like, big blockers or small blockers?
01:21:15.340 - 01:21:28.696, Speaker C: Because the end result of the block size worth was that the block size was increased. Like. So the calling the big blockers like, the enemies of bitcoin is, like, rather bizarre. There's a lot of these, like, very stupid, like, things that have, like, metastasized.
01:21:28.760 - 01:21:30.096, Speaker B: Who is our. So what were the two.
01:21:30.160 - 01:21:37.648, Speaker A: There was nothing to do with even the block. Like, even the word block war came from, like, Jonathan Beer's book, maybe from.
01:21:37.696 - 01:21:45.768, Speaker B: All right, so if you. Okay, if you are an employee, like, wrote, never heard of the block size war, so no idea what we're talking about. Rizzo, give us the context here.
01:21:45.896 - 01:22:33.694, Speaker C: Well, the context is that since the invention of bitcoin in 2009, it's been unclear how bitcoin would scale to handle a significant transaction volume, and therefore, it's unclear that any cryptocurrency can reach the sufficient scale to essentially handle the entire global populace of transactions. Initially, bitcoin. You go back to reading the first responses to Satoshi. Some of the people are saying, look interesting that it works on a small scale, but we actually can't scale this up to handle millions and millions of participants. And I would say, like, very loosely. There was this one group that kind of wanted to scale and change and continue tinkering with the base layer of the bitcoin protocol. And there was this other group that wanted to, quote, build extensive technologies that extend bitcoin in other ways, like the lightning network L2s that would be built on top of bitcoin, loosely.
01:22:33.694 - 01:23:09.844, Speaker C: That was the schismatic. And I think it's interesting that you've kind of seen a lot of the other cryptocurrency projects pivot to the same kind of nomenclature. I went to the ethereum.org comma the other day and I was like, I read a sentence that honestly shocked me. I hadn't been on ethereum in five years. And it was like, we need to keep the block size or keep our network bandwidth small so that the network can be sufficiently decentralized. And honestly, I was shocked to actually even hear that, because everything, every technology choice that they have made should have made that abundantly clear that that discussion was had five years ago by another group of people.
01:23:09.844 - 01:23:41.432, Speaker C: Anyway, so there's this idea that essentially, like, we as a holistic group, and this is what I think makes the unity, right. It's like everyone is working on the same problem. The problem is that none of these things in their current form scale, the adequate size bitcoin has different properties than these other cryptocurrencies, salon, ethereum especially. That doesn't mean it can't have those properties right now. It doesn't, and maybe it won't ever. And that's essentially the current, that is the current debate is like how those things will play out. I don't know how to summarize it.
01:23:41.488 - 01:24:27.498, Speaker B: Other than, and who was arguing for. So basically, okay, so the big blockers who wanted to modify bitcoin to tell me what if I, what I get right and what I get wrong. Here you have the big blockers who wanted to kind of modify the bitcoin protocol to increase block capacity, which would then allow you to process more transactions. And the theory here is that they believe that you could essentially have cheaper and faster transactions which would make bitcoin more scalable and which would basically allow bitcoin to compete on a global stage as maybe like an alternative payment system. And there's like, again, this payments narrative and stuff like that. So that's a big blocker. Small blockers want to fight to keep the one, what is it, 1 mb size limit to what I actually raise, like, fundamental principles, right?
01:24:27.586 - 01:24:35.602, Speaker A: But that, that categorization implies that both sides wanted the same thing, the same end result. Like Pete was saying, and also there's a lot more to it. Multiple layers.
01:24:35.658 - 01:24:38.826, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there was actually three groups. I actually don't think there was really two.
01:24:38.890 - 01:24:44.842, Speaker A: Wait, the story starts like you were, you were saying with Gavin. The story starts with Gavin.
01:24:44.898 - 01:24:47.748, Speaker C: Story starts with Gavin. He's the one who rinsed against it.
01:24:47.946 - 01:25:01.044, Speaker A: So Toshi, when he walked, when he left, there was this alert key that is not, doesn't have any power over anything, but it allows people to like send an alert over the bitcoin software.
01:25:01.744 - 01:25:03.524, Speaker C: Push a message to every client.
01:25:04.104 - 01:25:33.338, Speaker A: And also the GitHub, which was the rep, the place where all the code was kept at the time, Satoshi maintained all the bitcoin code and allowed GitHub that was. And so like Satoshi allowed Gavin to like be this maintainer and passed over. So kind of like, you know, handed the keys to, to Gavin. But that should have never been the way it was really formulated. And like the, Gavin was like this like accidental leader.
01:25:33.426 - 01:25:57.454, Speaker C: Okay, maybe I, maybe I'll offer something else like open source car. Like open source development has certain like cultural mores and expectations. And one of them is essentially that like if you're the leader of an open source project, you can be like the benevolent dictator. So Linux was the original big open source project and it's led by a single guy and he directs other developers who manage other repos. But essentially what he says goes, and that's how the project moves forward.
01:25:59.594 - 01:26:02.106, Speaker A: We modeled it after that. We modeled the way.
01:26:02.210 - 01:26:47.174, Speaker C: And I would say the interesting, the question that I think the block size war is really asked is could you be a non government currency if there was some form of formal governance around bitcoin, up to and including any previous form of governance that has been established for no open source project. But that is like probably the closest I could get to distilling like what the block size wars were actually about. They were less about anything with technology and more about how would this thing be governed and how can you create a non government money without creating governments? And I think this is still the big narrative with the other cryptocurrencies where a lot of them are functioning governments. Like, they obfuscated in a lot of ways, but like, you know, Solana and Ethereum are for all sets of purposes functioning non state governmental entities, you know, have their own process.
01:26:48.314 - 01:27:31.846, Speaker A: Yeah, but the. So, so Gavin, he going back to that, there were all these proposals to like increase. Well, going back to that. So there was also Craig Wright starting to come into the mix at this point, trying to convince everyone that he was Satoshi and he convinced Gavin that he was Satoshi falsely, which is another story for another time. And so Gavin then came out saying that he was convinced wrong. But at the time, people were scared that Gavin was compromised and they used that as an, as a reason to remove Gavin's ability to work on bitcoin altogether. So Gavin, who was handed off the keys, was effectively kicked out.
01:27:31.846 - 01:27:34.434, Speaker A: This, this happened. Kicked out of bitcoin.
01:27:35.494 - 01:27:37.551, Speaker C: Dispute that, but I'll let you know.
01:27:37.551 - 01:28:03.526, Speaker A: He was the chief scientist of the foundation. Like, started the foundation, set up the whole system in which, like, bips were done and like, how bitcoin is run today, whatever that all happened. But the more layers to that was there were the miners in China that wanted to put ASIC boost and some other softwares to give themselves an edge. And they wanted to. What they saw is, was they ink, if they took the tap off, if.
01:28:03.550 - 01:28:06.198, Speaker C: They don't even know if I believe that story. Do you believe that story?
01:28:06.246 - 01:28:11.230, Speaker A: I don't. I wouldn't. I was, I spoke to jihad himself. I was in the mix.
01:28:11.302 - 01:28:17.414, Speaker C: Weren't they just, weren't they just commercializing like a product where you could just essentially pay to get like an extra efficiency from the minor?
01:28:17.454 - 01:28:54.046, Speaker A: Like, wasn't that like they were running ASIC boost and making sure they wanted to prevent an update that allowed anyone to see which miners were running ASIC boost. They were trying to run ASIC boost covertly. All we were trying to do was say, we want to make ASIC boost over. And you can research that part. That's where Bitmain and g on it all fell apart with them. And he was the leader of the big blockers. There was a point where Gyeon Bitmain, Roger Craig Wright, bitcoin cash, bitcoin as he was one unit running bitcoin cash subreddit as the team on one side and everyone else on the other side.
01:28:54.046 - 01:29:17.220, Speaker A: And that's where like. And then you had, like, and their fundamental. There was like a whole battle of like, removing who's running the access of bitcoin. And then it came down to like, miners versus nodes. That's what really the argument was about who's more in charge, miners versus nodes. And it came down to like, signaling for segwit, which was this whole technology. And there was all this crazy signaling done.
01:29:17.220 - 01:29:52.930, Speaker A: Like, miners started to signal where they would go, big block block. Or this new technology that allowed for an increase in block weight instead of block size. And again, it was all technology like arguments, but it became political and I remember Greg Maxwell perfectly said to me, Charlie, they're creating a political problem out of a political solution, out of a technical problem. And he was so right. It was all politics. And it was like the future of the governance and perceived power and control of bitcoin with miners versus nodes. Because what happened was everyone had to plant a flag.
01:29:52.930 - 01:30:15.142, Speaker A: Every single person, every exchange said, they're going to support this bitcoin, or they're going to support that bitcoin software. And there was a coming fork in the bitcoin software that people were signaling for, and it almost, like, completely split bitcoin. But thankfully, at the last minute, everyone came together and it was a whole thing. It's crazy stuff. There's so much to that story.
01:30:15.278 - 01:30:18.554, Speaker B: I think there might be. There might be too much for this one episode, but that's a good.
01:30:19.654 - 01:30:25.550, Speaker C: I think it's a good summation. I think it really cuts to just how wild that time was and. And why the cryptocurrency.
01:30:25.622 - 01:30:29.574, Speaker B: I would encourage people to go read the blocks, I think. Is there a book about the blocks?
01:30:29.614 - 01:30:32.446, Speaker C: There is. Johnny Beer has written a book called the block size wars.
01:30:32.510 - 01:31:05.218, Speaker B: Yeah, I would encourage people to go if. To go read about the block size wars if they have. Alright, so, Rizzo, I'm gonna. We're gonna skip. We're going to skip 2017 until 2023, because I think a lot of people in the industry have lived through this. And actually, I want, Rizzo, you to take us into the future, starting with basically, your take around ordinals and ordinals in the context of, like, this division between the bitcoin crowd and the crypto crowd. And there's, like, two.
01:31:05.218 - 01:31:20.348, Speaker B: There's two divisions here. There's the bitcoin crowd and the crypto crowd. Then there's the old bitcoin crowd and the new bitcoin crowd. And you gave this, I thought, beautiful summation of what's happening on the. What bitcoin did podcast. And I'd love to hear your. I mean, not to make you repeat.
01:31:20.476 - 01:31:49.784, Speaker C: There's another tough one. Yeah. I mean, I think for all sets of purposes, there's currently a divide between bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and crypto that is somewhat artificial and it somewhat rests on somewhat fictitious premises. Right. And I think that, you know, the big thing that ordinals and why it was so significant, and this was a protocol that was released last January by this developer named Casey Rotomar, but essentially allowed you to kind of embed arbitrary data on bitcoin in different ways. Essentially, this multimillion dollar NFT market spraying up on the bitcoin base chain.
01:31:49.784 - 01:32:57.370, Speaker C: I think that essentially, that exposed something that I think the cryptocurrency post 2017 people really hadn't been exposed to, which is that bitcoin is an emergent software system. While it does have rules, and those rules are enforced in a certain way, there's nothing that prohibits you as an individual from inventing something new that would basically invalidate how those rules are perceived. I think that we've saw this again late last year, and now there's been a string of these advances where people who maybe are familiar with what's going on in cryptocurrency land, and they're finding new creative ways previously thought impossible to do previously thought impossible things on bitcoin. And the two, one of those were, the first one is ordinals, and the second one would be bitVM, which is a pretty new white paper that basically proved that Turing competes. Complete smart contracts are possible on the bitcoin base layer. And then from that, the commercial application seems to be that we're headed towards this wave of kind of second layer type roll ups that are going to be built on bitcoin. So that's kind of the big vc chase right now, is to commercialize that.
01:32:57.370 - 01:33:30.514, Speaker C: But I think the broader thing here is essentially like we've kind of schismed into two cultures working on two different things. And I think ordinals and BitVM combined have sort of ruptured that. And essentially the disturbance and the force here is that it is really true that anything is possible on bitcoin, provided that you have enough inventiveness in order to actually achieve it. That seems to be the new reality that people are pricing in. And I think there's still a good amount of people in crypto land that have their head in the sand on this. And there's a good amount of people in the bitcoin land, uh, they want to pretend that it hasn't happened. I think that's kind of the new.
01:33:30.514 - 01:33:36.638, Speaker C: I mean, we'll see. Right. I think that you both are in.
01:33:36.646 - 01:33:44.302, Speaker B: The camp of ordinals. L two s on bitcoin. Put it. Putting. Putting things on bitcoin is a good idea.
01:33:44.478 - 01:33:45.942, Speaker A: My vc fund is made.
01:33:46.038 - 01:33:59.366, Speaker C: Well, again, we don't have any say. Right? So this is the thing is like bitcoin as a permissionless system. So it is an immaterial, like what my view on it is. All I'm saying is this, this is happening. This is reality. It is actually true that the most.
01:33:59.430 - 01:34:04.070, Speaker B: Rizzo take I have ever really bullish on it.
01:34:04.222 - 01:34:21.508, Speaker A: We made, like, 17 investments in the last year and a half. We started in the day one bear market, realizing that this was the next narrative was going to be people building things to connect bitcoin and crypto back together. Very simply, super bullish on it. And I think it's really happening in a positive way.
01:34:21.686 - 01:35:03.308, Speaker B: I remember this hike that we went on for listeners context. So COVID hits 80% of blockworks revenue came from events, and we basically just had to figure out how to pivot and what to do. And we realized that there was this missing need in the market for better news. There was Coindesk in the block and decrypt, but we thought we could do it better than any of them were doing. And so I called Rizzo. We didn't really know each other then, and we went on this, like, great hike in upstate New York and walked me through how to build a media company in crypto. And, yeah, you kind of laid out the whole model, and you laid out how it works.
01:35:03.308 - 01:35:19.152, Speaker B: But one of the takeaways from that conversation was you were into all of it. You were very, like, when you were building coindesk, you were into all of it, and you got super burned out from the kind of vc chase for something new. And you had, like, I mean, if.
01:35:19.168 - 01:35:39.270, Speaker C: There was anyone who left, like, not disgusted with 2017, like, 2017 was just, like, a disgusting thing to be a part of. Like, I think if you were in the industry prior to that, you just watched people who, like, you know, priorly had approached this. Like, you know, I say, I said this this summer. It's like, you know, bitcoin was a science back then. It was a science. It was something we were doing. We were trying to learn about.
01:35:39.270 - 01:36:27.372, Speaker C: And then it was just like, you had this great rush of people who came in and just totally used that to exploit thousands of retail investors on a level that I think was gross. It was an objectively gross thing. And I think that there is a lot of things that are objectively gross about the crypto apparatus that has sprung out out of that, which is essentially, you have VC's that invest in projects for quick liquidity on. On exits, and that they aren't really interested in actually adding to, as I said, like, what is the great mystery here? Which is, like, how do we create a financial system that can scale to 8 billion people out of the tools that Satoshi left us? And I do think that there are people within the crypto space who can add to that. It's just that, like, you know, post 17, it was like, the culture was like, I mean, again, you had people who, like, you need to be a.
01:36:27.388 - 01:36:43.000, Speaker A: VC, because you've been telling me that also for a couple of years. And so what I did was I went out and, like, out of this, those 17 investments, only three are tokens. The rest of them are pick and shovels, building out the applications that will further this technology, the Satoshi roots.
01:36:43.112 - 01:36:45.840, Speaker C: Like, what are the investments building out?
01:36:45.872 - 01:37:20.356, Speaker A: Like, tons of different. Like, well, you go to druidventures.com and check out the portfolio. There's, like, they're all listed there, and everyone can check them all. Only three. A token decentralized, like, hacker networks that allow people to do, like, real time pen testing. Every question we ask is, are, like, for example, you're seeing, like, this huge AI narrative, and they're saying, like, you know, how do we build out technologies using the Satoshi tools to prevent AI from getting too centralized and not being able to, like, have, for example, proof of brain, which Satoshi talked about, proof of human verification.
01:37:20.356 - 01:37:46.002, Speaker A: How do I know that I'm even talking to a human right now? I could be talking. You could be my an AI bot. So there's a great applications. We asked ourselves, but you're right. The only people that can do that are the purists, people like you and me. So we have to get back into the saddle and try to, like, help making sure the narratives are being run the right way. So, like, writing that, writing books, being a goose, or doing everything to make sure things are being run.
01:37:46.098 - 01:38:19.294, Speaker C: I mean, I think there is something, like, about the token create, arbitrary token creation, though, that, like, we went too far down that path. Like, I think that. And then what you're seeing on the Ethereum Solana side now, I think in a bit of their direction list is like. Is like, how do you move forward when, you know, essentially they aren't constrained by the same things that bitcoin are? That is. Right. Bitcoin's constraints, I think, have been some of its biggest. Like, you know, its biggest advantages in many ways, right? You have this base layer that you know is sound, and now we know is incorruptible, despite gross amounts of, like, human efforts to change it.
01:38:19.294 - 01:39:08.444, Speaker C: You don't have that level of assurance with other things. So I think when you talk about ordinals or bivm, like, it's like, okay, if you can build on Ethereum or you can build on bitcoin and now it's possible to build on bitcoin. Which foundation are you going to choose? Are you going to build on something that sure as shit is going to be there in a thousand years? Or are you going to build on something that maybe in two years from now they decide to show the model works and it invalidates what you're doing or whatever? Bitcoin has these certain qualities that I think are now appealing to people in the crypto space and I think that's exciting. Again, I don't know what percentage of the stuff that they're working on that can be ported over. There's certainly probably a lot of bad ideas that are going to get ported over. But I think we're, again, if you look at it as like this is science, we're learning about it. I think this is like a important thing to happen, which is these two groups coming together again.
01:39:08.444 - 01:39:22.644, Speaker C: I would maybe take a little bit of a different tack than Charlie where I'd say I would like to see, I would not like to see arbitrary token creation come back in large volumes on bitcoin. I don't know if I can prevent that. That might actually just happen.
01:39:22.984 - 01:39:25.568, Speaker A: You're not going to see token creation on bitcoin.
01:39:25.696 - 01:39:30.960, Speaker C: That's too, already are like, you will. Yeah, these are already here.
01:39:31.072 - 01:40:03.844, Speaker A: Seeing that, you're seeing like Apple crazy token projects that are launching, connecting those things, you're, you're definitely seeing a lot of that. But a lot of that is like short term token crap. The, the stuff that's being built like with long term VC investment I think really is better than that. A lot of that, that like short term token crop is still there. You're going to see that crap like BRC tokens that make no matter, no different. But there's some really cool things that allow for like revenue sharing tokens out there. Security token potentially like there.
01:40:03.844 - 01:40:42.222, Speaker A: I think there'll be a huge, if you look at RWA XYZ, Realworld assets, XYZ already like a couple of billion dollars is already locked up in these like you know, between bonds, private credit and real estate being tokenized on the blockchain. And there's a huge amount of that, especially private credit. We've invested in a few different companies that are facilitating like private credit token issuance for accredited investor type things. There's a lot that you can do there when it's, you're right, when it's not like token v, you're talking about that time when like, and it's still happening.
01:40:42.278 - 01:40:48.262, Speaker C: Dude, have you seen bonds? I mean, it's. The grift is alive and well.
01:40:48.358 - 01:40:50.748, Speaker A: If you go to crypto rank, you can see it.
01:40:50.886 - 01:40:52.804, Speaker C: I mean, how many dog coins, like.
01:40:53.784 - 01:41:25.924, Speaker B: So zooming out, zooming out from this and we'll start to kind of tie this whole conversation together and wrap this up is when you guys think about ten. Rizzo, you've been in the industry for eleven years, it sounds like. And Charlie, 13 years, I guess. What are you guys happiest about? And when you look at how far we've come, it must feel good to just see how far we've come and to have played a role in that. And then what are you like, man? Like, this industry really, really whiffed on this, on this bucket.
01:41:27.544 - 01:41:28.536, Speaker C: You want to go first or should.
01:41:28.560 - 01:41:32.128, Speaker A: I go for it? I don't even know my answer. I'm going to think about my answer.
01:41:32.216 - 01:41:43.000, Speaker C: I mean, I think we really whiffed on the cultural divide. I think that's, like, something that I'm pretty adamant about. You know, it's probably outlived its usefulness, especially at a time, I think, where a lot of people are discovering bitcoin.
01:41:43.072 - 01:41:45.524, Speaker A: Maximalist did that, though. It sucks.
01:41:47.104 - 01:42:00.784, Speaker C: I don't know. That's a tough one. What was the first question? What do I think? What am I proud of? I mean, I think I'm glad that we. Well, I don't know. I don't know how much I feel like a participant in it. Right. Like, because I was essentially, like, on the sidelines as a journalist.
01:42:00.784 - 01:42:25.812, Speaker C: Right. I think that I'm glad that we didn't ruin what Satoshi gave us, and I am hopeful that we will somehow figure out a way to, you know, ensure that, like, the people of the world can access the system in the way that he intended. I think that's, that's something we have to kind of take forward with a good degree of humility and, like, aspiration. But I don't know. I don't think that we're essentially guaranteed that. Right. I think we've done a lot.
01:42:25.812 - 01:42:30.504, Speaker C: We've done a lot of very stupid things with what he gave us. So I don't know, expect more of that.
01:42:31.404 - 01:42:38.296, Speaker A: The ETF is definitely scary with the ability to amass all the bitcoin in the world and be able to just.
01:42:38.320 - 01:43:05.484, Speaker C: Shut off liquidity, certainly eating a lot of stuff. Yeah. And I do think that that's an interesting schism, right. I think that the interest in the bitcoin community, like, in some of the stuff the crypto esque stuff that is self custody, that is outside the state apparatus. There is, you know, I think if there is a critique of bitcoin maximalism that I would allow is, I think it became overly concerned with using the state to enforce its own ideology at some point. And I think that was unhelpful, and I'm glad we're moving, moving past that.
01:43:06.784 - 01:43:14.844, Speaker A: I don't think Satoshi predicted the bitcoin price going up as fast as it did in short of a period of time. Do you think. Do you think that's the case?
01:43:17.424 - 01:44:03.714, Speaker C: I mean, one of the things with Satoshi is just that he was a project founder, and I think project founders oftentimes are just trying to iterate towards success. I think the emails that came out last week are a great example of how much Satoshi was willing to reposition or find different ways to get people interested in bitcoin. I kind of wonder how much he was really concerned with the bigger picture stuff, though. It's, you know, as we look back, it's like, there's so much he did in order to ensure that foundation, but, yeah, he had to act in order to, like, kind of get it launched. And I think that, like, you know, what did he foresee? I mean, he says it pretty explicitly in the first, you know, emails on the p two P foundation where he says, you know, all other ways of government currency operate this way. This is a new system. Right? Like, so I think he foresaw that the system could be that large, for sure, because, you know, his text suggests that.
01:44:03.714 - 01:44:13.394, Speaker C: Right. He didn't. You know, it's like, not like he, you know, the chancellor on the bailout for banks. Right. He could have just put like, a, you know, advertisement for McDonald's in the blockchain, you know? Yeah.
01:44:13.434 - 01:44:14.214, Speaker A: True story.
01:44:15.914 - 01:44:25.334, Speaker B: Guys. Good chat. Rizzo, I appreciate all the guidance over the years. And, Charlie, we didn't even talk about the. Our whole story. Working together with.
01:44:25.754 - 01:44:34.384, Speaker A: Thank you for helping me start ranking for a bit, essentially starting my podcasts. I've been doing it now for six years, I guess almost six years this may.
01:44:34.764 - 01:44:37.140, Speaker B: I got to tell Reed that we. That you came on.
01:44:37.252 - 01:44:38.380, Speaker A: Oh, how's he doing?
01:44:38.532 - 01:44:43.868, Speaker B: He's doing great. He's our head of creative. He's been here. Longest running employee of lockworks.
01:44:43.996 - 01:44:51.388, Speaker A: He's a good man. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much for doing. This show is a long one. Thank you, guys. It was good to see both of you.
01:44:51.516 - 01:44:57.318, Speaker C: Yeah, it was fun, and hopefully we'll toast at 100K soon, maybe thanks for that.
01:44:57.366 - 01:45:14.494, Speaker B: Thanks. Charlie Cork. Good to see you, everyone. Jason here. Thank you so much for watching today's episode.
