00:00:00.200 - 00:00:07.745, Speaker A: All the new buyers are going to Solana. All the new users are going to Solana. And then like on the institutional level, it's like clearly just like bitcoin. They're just like buying bitcoin.
00:00:07.825 - 00:00:28.343, Speaker B: They complain about free speech in places like Russia, Iran and China, but then they arrest a guy like this for basically upholding. They arrest juror for like upholding free speech. I almost think people get pushed towards crypto rather than pulled. Like they get pushed by the current, current things becoming more and more restrictive rather than pulled by superior ux.
00:00:28.479 - 00:00:30.395, Speaker C: Don't get chopped out of your bags.
00:00:30.855 - 00:01:21.813, Speaker B: Nothing set on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hi, everyone, my name is Jose Moseidu and welcome to the second episode on Empire of the Hivemind podcast. The goal of the podcast is to provide an inside look into what we like to call the Delphi Hive Mind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights, alpha and shitposts. So today was a bit of a slower two weeks in crypto, but we're going to start with markets. Jan, you want to lead us off here?
00:01:21.959 - 00:02:34.001, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess main development that's happened over the past two weeks has been the dovish pivot at Jackson Hole by Jay Powell. And so you kind of immediately saw a pretty broad rally across equities and crypto. And equities have continued to do well, but crypto has kind of reversed the entire move, which isn't great to see, particularly when you see equities doing well and crypto selling off. And so you try and, you know, figure out is there a reason why or is this just kind of, you know, what the market's doing? It's, you know, on one hand, there's rumors that the US is still kind of continuing to sell a lot of the seized tokens, which is possible. It's harder to tell now that they've custody a bunch with Coinbase. And so there's, you know, they do OTC deals, they're doing a bunch of other stuff that makes on chain sleuthing a bit less signally.
00:02:34.001 - 00:02:36.045, Speaker C: So you kind of have that.
00:02:36.545 - 00:02:49.747, Speaker A: It's honestly way better than Germany just sending coins straight to exchanges and then everyone front runs them. Like that was the worst way to do it ever. That was terrible.
00:02:49.851 - 00:02:57.975, Speaker C: I do think that it is easier in the long run though, right, because you're basically Ripping off the bandaid and you have that clarity.
00:02:58.595 - 00:03:09.495, Speaker A: Well, I think if they announce that the sale is complete or something, then that would be useful. But also there's got to be some OTC desks, if that's how they're doing it, that know that this is happening.
00:03:10.555 - 00:03:14.781, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been asking around, haven't been able to get too much info.
00:03:14.923 - 00:03:36.505, Speaker D: I mean the, the coins have definitely been complete dog shit compared to like everything else for the past little while. I mean, BTC is the only thing that looks like relative. It still looks bad, but it's looked like okay at least. Like ETH has been awful, soul's been awful. Everything else has been. It's just been. Yeah, pretty bad.
00:03:36.505 - 00:03:56.941, Speaker D: People are again, people are still like kind of going insane, but everything kind of sets up well. Right. Like we're still up a lot from last year and we have like all these rate cuts coming, all this liquidity coming. As long as the economy just doesn't totally like nuke and go to shit.
00:03:57.093 - 00:03:59.345, Speaker A: Yeah. Bitcoin is still up a lot.
00:04:00.965 - 00:04:03.277, Speaker C: It's basically just been six months of chop.
00:04:03.461 - 00:04:08.345, Speaker A: I think that's chop in bitcoin but like zero in alt.
00:04:09.925 - 00:04:15.965, Speaker C: Well, there's like pockets of exuberance and then just brutal sell offs out of nowhere.
00:04:16.265 - 00:04:25.673, Speaker A: Well, like infra and memes and cosmos and like I guess I'm surprised. Like, yeah, some alts of actual businesses have been okay, but a lot have gotten murdered.
00:04:25.809 - 00:04:32.209, Speaker B: What about E PTF flows? Did you want to touch on that? Just like, yeah, et cetera. As you brought this up, maybe.
00:04:32.337 - 00:04:56.187, Speaker D: Well, no, it was kind of like crazy how there were like back to back days where BTC had like a quarter bill of inflows both days and eth was like negative 5 mil one day and then zero the other day. It's just not. I think it's fair to say that like there hasn't been this like institutional demand for eth.
00:04:56.291 - 00:04:59.179, Speaker A: It is sharpening their pencils, et cetera. Don't worry.
00:04:59.267 - 00:05:10.075, Speaker D: Yeah, they're just, they're just sharpening it up. But like this is. We talked about this before though, how it would have been better if the ETTF kind of got delayed until post election.
00:05:13.455 - 00:05:17.575, Speaker A: You know, more time to sharpen the pencils.
00:05:17.735 - 00:05:20.075, Speaker D: Yeah. Think about how sharp they'd be.
00:05:20.455 - 00:05:37.751, Speaker A: Yeah. But Honestly, the. The BTC, like BDC keeps chugging along. It's almost at 18 billion in net flows, which is pretty. It's at like 17, 8 right now. So, you know, black rocker, there was probably like 400 million inflows last week. 300 million keeps on chugging along.
00:05:37.751 - 00:05:55.083, Speaker A: It's like over time it adds up. I think it's kind of like kind of drift into the background a bit. People are still watching it, but not as much as when the ETF first came out. And I think that over time it, it really helps. And just they're taking a lot of spl off the market over like periods.
00:05:55.099 - 00:06:11.869, Speaker D: Of time on the th. I don't know if you guys listen to the Thousand X Pod. I only started listening to it because it's on the Empire feed. And so now that I get these. But Avi Feldman, he was like, he thinks ETH could be the XRP of this cycle. Like what do you think about that?
00:06:11.957 - 00:06:13.145, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:06:13.645 - 00:06:57.005, Speaker D: I think it's just like that it's going to 589. No, like I think the ratio will just like keep going down against btc. Every, every little like there's like nothing is gonna make each start out performing now except for some like massive news. And so basically every single pump on the ETH BTC ratio, you just kind of don't get shaken out of being short ETH btc. And then if something massive comes and there's this big news, you kind of have time to position. That's what his kind of take was. He thinks that there's no reason to own ETH for rest of the cycle.
00:06:57.995 - 00:07:39.045, Speaker C: I think it's a reasonable argument. The biggest catalyst now is just how bearish everyone is. But that, that really isn't enough like that. It's certainly a good setup for, you know, maybe a short term rally because everyone's caught off sides and, and there's, you know, covering that needs to happen. But I don't necessarily think we're quite there yet. It seems like something that will happen more so after there's been more selling and people get more confident in, in trying to short eat as like a pair trade or whatever it might be. And so yeah, the argument that everyone's bearish, I.
00:07:39.045 - 00:07:43.025, Speaker C: I don't think can really move the market right now.
00:07:44.205 - 00:07:54.583, Speaker D: People. No, like I have. People were calling ETH contrarian in December of last year. So it's still like 300 bill or whatever.
00:07:54.639 - 00:07:59.863, Speaker A: It's just like a terrible reason to be bullish in the long term, in the medium to long term.
00:07:59.999 - 00:08:01.231, Speaker D: But listen, I also think.
00:08:01.303 - 00:08:07.943, Speaker A: Yeah, I also think, I mean that's your only thesis. Everyone's bearish. That's me.
00:08:07.999 - 00:08:08.567, Speaker C: No, I'm saying.
00:08:08.631 - 00:08:10.663, Speaker A: No, I'm not saying you're Only the.
00:08:10.679 - 00:08:35.585, Speaker B: Main bullet is the number one smart contracting platform in crypto. Like by. If you look at it as an ecosystem basis by TVL, right. There's like $60 billion in TVL by developers, by new developers, by like commits ship to ecosystem. Like it's just, it's just the number one. Like I don't know how you need to find. It's so hard to find a bull case for the.
00:08:36.245 - 00:08:54.959, Speaker C: Because markets are forward looking. Right. And so it's more about, you know. Yes, at the moment it certainly is. But there's, there's not a lot of reasons for why the gap between ETH and the others shouldn't converge over time from here until something changes.
00:08:55.007 - 00:08:58.727, Speaker B: Who are the others? There's only really Solana basically.
00:08:58.831 - 00:09:00.455, Speaker A: I think it's like right now everything.
00:09:00.495 - 00:09:08.663, Speaker B: Else is on eth, whether it's the roll ups or like the app specific roll up thesis, it's most likely to happen like on ethnicity. Right.
00:09:08.759 - 00:09:34.489, Speaker D: Right now. But you're seeing more of like, you're seeing more of these move chains and like roll ups that'll continue to like gain relative adoption because they're so small. You're seeing svm, a lot of like SVM app roll ups, app chains now, which further, you know, eats into the EVM market share or whatever. And again, ETH is just like a massive valuation. So.
00:09:34.537 - 00:10:02.575, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think it's all about like who are the. Like since there's not a ton of new users and capital coming in, all of like there's not enough for everyone. Right. So it's like where are all the new marginal users and marginal capital going? And it seems to be, at least on the retail level, it seems to be, sorry, it's Solana, like all the actions happening there, all the new buyers are going to Solana, all the new users are going to Solana. And then like on the institutional level it's like clearly just like bitcoin. They're just like buying bitcoin.
00:10:02.615 - 00:10:42.545, Speaker D: Yeah. Here's the thing. I actually think that like I don't know what the right Soul ETH ratio is, but it kind of feels like maybe where we've been the last few months is like kind of where it's going to be for a while. I think that you could actually see Ethan Soul both just being like boring assets for the rest of the cycle and you actually know but like you actually start to see some of these other assets, maybe with some actual fundamentals behind them, start to get more interest and everyone will continue arguing like ETH versus Soul, but it'll kind of just stay like flat ratio wise. I could see that happening.
00:10:43.205 - 00:11:13.031, Speaker B: I mean, I'm partially playing devil's advocate, as we know from previous shows, but I do think that Eth and the L2 ecosystem are still the leaders by almost any metric you can possibly conceive of. And so, I don't know. I do think it's tough to. You don't need to come up with this crazy bull case. There's a lot of narrow shots on goal that ETH has. Any One of these L2s could take off. Any of these applications could take off.
00:11:13.031 - 00:11:39.205, Speaker B: Even this ZK proofs or like these proofs of off chain actions thing that we consider putting on the podcast that's being built on eth. Like the. In general, the marginal new thing that launches in crypto is built on eth because almost all the new developers are coming in on Ethereum and L2s. So I just think there's like a lot of ways that there's a lot of ways that ETH can do well.
00:11:40.185 - 00:11:49.241, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I agree it's not impossible, but I think with the current information. Yeah.
00:11:49.353 - 00:12:00.665, Speaker A: And it's also like it can get more adoption in some of those areas without really affecting the fundamental value of it as much as people may have thought before. Right.
00:12:00.785 - 00:12:52.585, Speaker B: I also think eth's gonna do lower block time and probably a few other changes within the next like six months to a year. I don't think. I don't know about pre conf or anything like that, given just how long kind of more fundamental stuff takes in Ethereum, but I think we've seen like with Vitalik engaging more recently and stuff, that there is somewhat of a fire up the Ethereum community's ass now from. From the competition from Solana. I am pretty bearish on the L1 moving, moving at any sort of speed, but yeah, I still think ETH is dominant. Okay, so most people probably saw Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, was arrested in Paris last Saturday. So we're recording this on Thursday, 29 August.
00:12:52.585 - 00:13:26.095, Speaker B: And then he was. They officially filed charges, I believe yesterday. And he was released on a 5 million euro bail yesterday as well. So this is an interesting story for a bunch of reasons. For those who don't know, this guy has a history of sort of going against governments. So he's the founder of VK, which was kind of the Russian Facebook in 2006. In 2011 he refused to honor police requests to delete opposing political party pages on vk.
00:13:26.095 - 00:13:54.795, Speaker B: He Actually posted a picture of his. Of his dog instead. And that very picture and meme coin is. Is what got, like, pumped to infinity over the last week and took down Telegram, which is pretty funny. Yeah. And then he did it again in 2014, where he was asked to cut to out, like, Ukrainian protesters, to dox Ukrainian protesters, and to defeat delete Navalny's page. He refused to do both and eventually had to leave Russia and sold VK to.
00:13:54.795 - 00:14:23.071, Speaker B: To Kremlin friendly owners. And then obviously, at the same time, like, he already knew he was gonna have to do that. He was starting Telegram. He ended up getting French and UAE citizenship, but had his phone hacked by them both. 2018, he had another spat with Russian authorities where he refused to give encryption keys to them and ended up actually, like, winning that somehow. And Telegram didn't get banned in Russia. And then apparently, like, a few articles say that he's received a bunch of different subpoenas from.
00:14:23.071 - 00:14:57.135, Speaker B: From European governments and refused to comply with them, which is what France is alleging in this. In this case, that basically he received subpoenas about, you know, child pornography and terrorism and all these things, and refused to comply with them, and that's why they're arresting him. Ton went down a bit, but not too much, considering how, like, bigger news this was, it feels like. And then obviously there was the outages and stuff as well. Anyone want to add anything to that or go straight to just given your two cents on it?
00:14:58.195 - 00:15:31.613, Speaker C: Nothing to add. Yeah, that's a good summary. Yeah. Basically, very sharp guy, entrepreneur his whole life. Very ideological in terms of kind of some libertarian values, but basically preserving privacy, preserving freedom, and basically kind of had to sacrifice his first company that was incredibly successful that he built from the ground up. And, yeah, he had to sell his stake and then kind of went passport hunting around the world.
00:15:31.789 - 00:15:32.093, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:32.109 - 00:16:00.645, Speaker B: And what's really interesting about this is it's like, I think Russia has asked for him to be. For him to be sent there and has, like, spoken out against the Western double standard on free speech. Right. That they complain about free speech in places like Russia, Iran and China, but then they arrest a guy like this for basically upholding. They arrest juror for, like, upholding free speech. And, yeah, this guy is just.
00:16:01.465 - 00:16:02.121, Speaker A: It's.
00:16:02.233 - 00:16:02.721, Speaker C: Yeah, he's.
00:16:02.753 - 00:16:10.025, Speaker B: He's just gone against governments his whole. His whole life. And I think he thought he'd have a better time in the west, but seemingly not.
00:16:10.145 - 00:16:27.331, Speaker D: All right, can we talk about it, like, the T angle? So I'm, like, never been bullish on Ton I'm not going to be after this either. Does anybody have like the bull case, though, that this is like bullish for Ton for some reason?
00:16:27.483 - 00:17:07.425, Speaker C: I mean, it kind of depends on the response and, and what, what he comes out and says in terms of, you know, is there some, you know, leaning into the whole censorship, resistance ideas? There's some element of trying to put something, some of this on chain or lean deeper into the Ton ecosystem. I think there's a decent argument to be made there. I don't know that I guess what's the longer term, bearish argument for this and Ton?
00:17:08.445 - 00:17:41.451, Speaker A: I feel like the bearish argument is that like, at least I listened to the Tucker Carlin, Tucker Carlson interview at Pavel and it was really good. But it sounds like there's not a lot of people who work at Telegram. And if, like, I think he said there's like 30 engineers or something. So I feel like if you take the lead guy and he ends up going to jail and then like you start kind of exerting force over the company in some way and it like degrades or I don't know what they would end up doing into it. But if, like, here's a hypothetical.
00:17:41.523 - 00:17:43.455, Speaker D: Let's say Telegram is shut down.
00:17:43.795 - 00:17:44.291, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:44.363 - 00:17:46.683, Speaker D: Is that bullish for time? Probably not, right?
00:17:46.739 - 00:17:47.843, Speaker C: That, that. Yeah.
00:17:47.899 - 00:17:48.235, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:17:48.275 - 00:17:51.019, Speaker A: Yeah. But I feel like shutting it down seems super extreme.
00:17:51.067 - 00:17:51.275, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:51.315 - 00:17:56.371, Speaker A: Yeah. It's probably in between, like them exerting, if he gets arrested. Them exerting, like, what?
00:17:56.403 - 00:17:56.547, Speaker D: Love.
00:17:56.571 - 00:18:15.121, Speaker B: I mean, they can't shut it down, Right. Like, they've even Russia tried to shut it down in Russia and there was this whole like Telegram channel of people operating proxies around the world to keep it running, and they literally couldn't shut it down. There's like two year long campaign. You can, you can, you can ban it in France or in Europe or whatever.
00:18:15.233 - 00:18:20.953, Speaker D: You can take it off of app stores and stuff. And then sure, people can still get around it, but you're going to lose all like that mass market.
00:18:21.009 - 00:18:36.615, Speaker C: I just don't like. I, I mean, what they. Obviously we have incomplete info, but just from a surface level perspective, what they arrested him for, they could in theory arrest every other founder for.
00:18:36.995 - 00:19:09.373, Speaker D: That's like the whole, you know, as long as North Korea doesn't use your protocol, you're fine. But if North Korea starts using your protocol now, you're breaking the law as a founder, like, regardless if it's like a privacy thing or whatever. Right. So, yeah, under. I get what you're saying. That's what all these regulators are like, politicians seem to care about is like they don't actually seem to care about how any of the underlying tech works. It's just if bad actors start using what you've created, well, it's.
00:19:09.429 - 00:19:39.639, Speaker C: I think that's, that's a scapegoat. And reality, it's, we want access to your back door and we want you to censor and do actions on our behalf. And then if not, then there's, you know, price to pay. And so you've seen Zuck come out and talk about how that was interesting. Yeah. So like, you could probably touch on that, but it's clear that, you know, it's either cooperate or get arrested. And I think, you know, because North Korea uses it is a scapegoat.
00:19:39.727 - 00:19:39.927, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:39.951 - 00:20:23.495, Speaker B: This is highly speculative, but I assume that when France gave him a citizenship and stuff like this, they assumed there'd be some kind of quid pro quo, that they'd have some special access or whatever and he wouldn't just leave all their subpoenas on red or, you know, whatever he's doing. And they got angry that he did that anyway. But I agree, it's interesting, like in the same thing with Elon, right. To some extent. Like he's also, he out of the Twitter files, like refused to cooperate. He had that whole thing in Brazil where he was literally like publicly spatting with the Brazilian president or whatever. And it's one thing for regulators to be like this, but hopefully you hope the judiciary sort of stays independent like they have in the US Mostly.
00:20:23.495 - 00:20:35.435, Speaker B: Although they haven't with tornado cash in Europe as we covered on like a previous episode. But it's pretty scary when. Yeah, exactly what you guys said. You can get arrested for someone using your platform.
00:20:35.515 - 00:20:35.779, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:35.827 - 00:20:48.461, Speaker B: Someone doing criminal activity on your platform, regardless of whether you had anything to do with it, especially in a crypto sense, because once you publish a smart contract, it's there forever. So you have this unlimited liability for someone to come in and use your. Use your platform.
00:20:48.573 - 00:21:00.025, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like arresting him would be incredibly short sighted in terms of the second order effects for incentivizing any kind of entrepreneurship in your country.
00:21:00.925 - 00:21:21.509, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's like, I don't. I feel like they're coming to a point where it seems like a lot of the world governments in the west are getting more authoritarian and more censorship. Like I think the Facebook letter, if no one read it, I think basically Zuckerberg came out and said we were influenced to censor certain things during COVID.
00:21:21.677 - 00:21:46.747, Speaker C: Well, it's Covid and election related stuff, which is crazy. It's one thing if the scapegoat is for the greater good because we don't want disinformation about this disease, which I think you can somewhat, you know, rationalize as being for the greater good. But. But like the other one is just, you know, pretty cut dry electron interference.
00:21:46.851 - 00:22:32.999, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, that's pretty wild. And even the COVID one, like I remember when that was going on, they're like censoring doctors like across like actual doctors who are just giving their opinion across like these platforms, like on all social media. So it's definitely kind of scary that you're heading towards this. And I think the world would look a lot different without Elon having bought Twitter because like now we know like meta coming out confirming it. The Twitter files that these governments have are in direct contact with all these social media companies influencing what is said and what stories they want to like kind of amplify or censor. And you know, you have to imagine that's also happening with the traditional news outlets. And I'm sure there's like, you know, some confirmation of that.
00:22:32.999 - 00:23:03.195, Speaker A: So really you have like X in the US and maybe Telegram as like two really widespread apps that have put up a big like, stand against, you know, censorship and one of those. And like Elon's come under like a lot of scrutiny in the US but as Jose said, hopefully, you know, the legal systems upheld better there. But now like you have the Telegram founder potentially facing 20 years in prison. So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
00:23:03.275 - 00:23:43.885, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with censorship. There is like an argument for some censorship though, right? Like, I mean, even in the law right now, like freedom of speech has, at least in Europe, I don't know about the US but in Europe it definitely has limits. Like there's, there's things you can't say and I think, I'm pretty sure they're wider than they are in the US And I think we kind of seen some of that with like Twitter. Twitter has definitely become a, like, I don't know if it has more information misinformation, but there's definitely a lot of misinformation on Twitter these days. Like even the UK riots, right? There was this. Everyone was saying the stabber was a, was a migrant and then turns out he wasn't. Right? He was born in the uk, son of migrants.
00:23:43.885 - 00:24:18.925, Speaker B: And that was basically the, the tinder that lit the, whatever the expression is, you know, the ember that lit the fire and caused a Lot of those riots and you had people like massive accounts like Andrew Tate or whatever, just spreading this despite the fact that they knew at the point that it was already clear that it was false. Still spreading it because obviously it gets people, it gets people angry. Right. UK bunch of losers. You won't even protect your country. Migrant comes like migrants straight off the boat, comes in and stabs three kids. You know, all this stuff is super inflammatory and it's going to get people angry and cause violence and there is like some limits that you.
00:24:18.925 - 00:24:27.633, Speaker B: I don't know. I think Community Notes is a really good system for it, although it's not working particularly well. It's sort of been like taken over a bit.
00:24:27.729 - 00:24:28.057, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:28.121 - 00:24:30.673, Speaker B: But I feel like there is an argument for it.
00:24:30.729 - 00:24:30.993, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:31.049 - 00:24:56.845, Speaker C: I think it's all trade offs though, right? The problem is trade offs on one side. Yeah. Like, you know, there are negative effects of, of inflammatory language. But the problem is the way that you police. It gives basically control of what you're able to say to an impartial government authority who, whose motivation is. Is to maintain power and maintain control.
00:24:57.265 - 00:25:23.587, Speaker D: I do understand Jose's point though. Like these, these riots, they're kind of like a partial government. They're kind of like this is kind of like a societal bank run. Like if you remember how quickly like the sb, SVB stuff and all that spread on social media and you just like get these bank runs. Like this is a whole thing now that economists are. And like regulators are looking at is like bank runs in the social media era. Right.
00:25:23.587 - 00:25:39.213, Speaker D: Because of how quickly things can spread, even if it's not necessarily true or not. And yeah, you're seeing that when you actually have it, like start riots purely based on misinformation. Like. Yeah, I don't know what the right. I don't know what the right answer.
00:25:39.269 - 00:25:49.461, Speaker C: Started the riots though. Right. Like those. It was something that was building up for a host of reasons and it was going to be triggered one way or another. And I think this was just the event that triggered it.
00:25:49.573 - 00:26:26.485, Speaker A: Yeah, like this stuff's very difficult because it's obviously extremely complex, but it definitely feels like we're heading not to say that some rules or guidelines around like censor freedom of speech, like, you know, hate speech or something isn't important, but it definitely feels like we're leaning more towards. Okay, like they are censoring stuff like that. Zuckerberg said, like that was fully a political thing that they were censoring. It was like, I think the Hunter Biden laptop story, which right like that has nothing to do with. I'm trying to think if there's like implications there on like.
00:26:26.905 - 00:26:27.889, Speaker B: No, I don't think so.
00:26:27.977 - 00:26:29.769, Speaker A: That seems very political.
00:26:29.937 - 00:26:30.609, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:30.657 - 00:26:34.961, Speaker C: So I think the ones that was purely political. Yeah, agreed.
00:26:34.993 - 00:26:35.569, Speaker B: Yeah, very.
00:26:35.617 - 00:27:05.775, Speaker C: I mean all these organizations. Yeah. So I think the one interesting, one of the interesting takeaways from the Zuck thing is if you think about his motivations, right. He is, he's pretty agnostic to Dems or Republicans. He is fully focused on what's best for meta. Right. And so for him, he also has an insane back end full of probably the best source of info on the opinions of the minds of Americans.
00:27:05.775 - 00:27:44.519, Speaker C: Right. Like there's. It's hard to argue that there's someone who has better collection of information on opinions. And so for him to come out and say this probably suggests, or could suggest that, you know, what he's seeing leads to a kind of Republican victory and he's trying to better align himself with the next administration. If he thought that, you know, the Dems were set to do well here, then realistically there's no real reason for him to come out and burn that relationship. So I do think there's some kind of takeaway on that front in terms of what his opinion is of kind of the.
00:27:44.567 - 00:27:45.195, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:27:46.135 - 00:28:21.883, Speaker A: Yeah. I wonder if there's this. But the Pavel stuff got me thinking, you know, if we are worried about more censorship in the future, like are there any projects that we think are kind of interesting? I know, like Arweave and like Arweave our drive kind of the perma web, I know like filecoin, there's some other storage platforms but it's like, you know, some like Farcast or like decentralized Twitter. That sort of stuff seemingly is going to become more important as the web, two versions of those systems come like increasingly under attack or like under threat.
00:28:22.059 - 00:28:42.187, Speaker D: I saw a tweet the other day and it was we need a social media platform created by an anonymous founder. And I was like, oh yeah, that's actually. That makes a lot of sense. Like you need a satoshi style social media platform because even Farcast, you can probably go after Sarah.
00:28:42.211 - 00:28:44.215, Speaker B: I'd have just what you asked for.
00:28:46.915 - 00:28:48.331, Speaker D: Please. Anything.
00:28:48.483 - 00:28:51.815, Speaker C: Give me anything cheaper than any VC round you can find.
00:28:52.235 - 00:28:56.255, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a 2014 seed round.
00:28:58.115 - 00:28:58.975, Speaker D: Anything.
00:29:01.075 - 00:29:25.405, Speaker A: I think this seems like an obvious use case for crypto that is becoming more and more important and just how the financial crisis I guess pushed Satoshi or that group into making bitcoin. Right. Like I think, you know Increasing censorship could kind of force people into trying out, like, a decentralized social media Internet of some sorts.
00:29:27.305 - 00:30:02.755, Speaker D: I do think all this stuff is, like, narrative wise. All this stuff has been pretty good for crypto. Like, you're seeing way more people talk about these things that only crypto people would talk about like five years ago. And it's because it's just like, continued to become more, like, prevalent. And like, dude, family members even like, talk to me about some of this stuff now, whereas five years ago they would be like your conspiracy theorist.
00:30:04.055 - 00:30:44.579, Speaker B: Yeah, I've always had, like, this theory that people, like, it's hard for crypto to provide because, like, ultimately crypto gives you, like, the censorship resistance. And the cost is this way worse and, like, pretty different ux. It's. I mean, worse is like, it's better in some ways, but definitely, like, clunkier ux. And so the only way that people can get pushed to use this is if, like, the sort of costs of using your existing stuff just become so high that you don't want to do it anymore. Right. And so I almost think people get pushed towards crypto rather than pulled, like, they get pushed by the current things becoming more and more restrictive rather than pulled by superior ux.
00:30:44.579 - 00:31:32.887, Speaker B: And I think you've kind of seen a slow progress towards that in all of crypto's history. And to me, the world we're going towards now is pretty much like, if you could have written the script for like, a world where crypto really thrives, it'd be like, pretty similar to where it seems like we're going now. But just last thing on Durav thing, again, like, it does seem like, who knows what's true with this stuff, but it does seem like if he's not answering subpoenas for like, child pornography and terrorism and stuff like that, like that, that's pretty bad, right? Like, we. We all agree that you should be, you know, child pornography and terrorism is bad. If there's people doing that on the platform, you should probably be. And there are suspicions, you should probably be providing information about them. It's just that that needs to be obviously well delineated and stuff like that.
00:31:32.887 - 00:31:49.639, Speaker B: And I guess the argument is people have. Is that it's. It's a slippery slope until you start asking for information about your political opponents, about people you just don't like about. About whoever it might be, and just being like, quite radical, I think. I think Europe is becoming pretty radicalized.
00:31:49.687 - 00:32:04.435, Speaker D: I mean, it's also because he like, had that information because Telegram's like an unencrypted app that their servers just have all this. So for, like, something like Signal, like. Sure, I'm sure all that stuff is happening. Signal. No, it's not. Not by default.
00:32:05.415 - 00:32:06.719, Speaker A: I think we've talked about this before.
00:32:06.767 - 00:32:08.155, Speaker D: We talked about this before.
00:32:08.815 - 00:32:10.035, Speaker A: Are you sure?
00:32:11.255 - 00:32:13.355, Speaker D: Are you guys being serious right now?
00:32:13.935 - 00:32:15.447, Speaker A: Setters is the security.
00:32:15.511 - 00:32:20.823, Speaker D: I'm so, like, disappointed that you guys think that Telegram is secure. It's like, the most insecure messaging.
00:32:20.879 - 00:32:27.171, Speaker B: No, I don't think it's secure. I think. But I thought it was, like, encrypted. But they. But. But they had the decryption key.
00:32:27.283 - 00:32:46.691, Speaker D: No, it's unencrypted. That's why all your devices, like, will sync very easily too. No, but, like, I'm sure all this stuff happens on Signal too. Right. But Signal actually has no control to, like, get any of this information. Right. Whereas he actually does with Telegram.
00:32:46.691 - 00:32:53.403, Speaker D: And so it's kind of like if you now develop something where you're in the position that you can. You actually are able to access this information. Yeah.
00:32:53.459 - 00:33:37.401, Speaker A: Obviously, if those claims are legit, then. But I also don't. I don't know who knows? It's true, as Jose said. But listening to him speak on, like, the Tucker Carlson interview, which, assuming that he's being genuine with what he's saying, it sounded like they tried to cooperate with law enforcement on issues that were like, you know, on illegal things, like definitely child porn and terrorism would fall under that category where they would be cooperative with governments. But at the same time, it seemed like they had gotten a lot of subpoenas about stuff that would be crossing the line. Like, people don't like political opponents, you know, protesters. That's what it's made it.
00:33:37.401 - 00:34:07.403, Speaker A: That's what he made it seem like on that interview. That there's, like, a lot of times where they said no to governments because, you know, they're trying to do what's right and uphold freedom of speech. But obviously it's a very. At some point, it becomes a blurry line. Like in Canada, this is a great example, there was, like, peaceful protests during COVID about the vaccine mandate in Ottawa that the truckers were doing. And, like, there was a lot of, like, the government started freezing people's bank accounts, saying that they were, like, violent, which, like, there's a lot.
00:34:07.499 - 00:34:11.883, Speaker D: Okay. So I just need to say I wouldn't call them peaceful necessarily.
00:34:11.979 - 00:34:13.923, Speaker A: Okay. They're blocking the roads, but it's not.
00:34:13.979 - 00:34:21.385, Speaker D: They were like. No, they were being very aggressive to like nurses and doctors, too. Like, it was pretty bad. So I wouldn't say that it was, like, completely.
00:34:21.425 - 00:34:38.297, Speaker A: Were they harming? I don't think that there was any reports of anyone being harmed. But anyways, like, what if you start to label those people terrorists then? Because they're, like, shutting down the roads, which, you know, that's like a very slippery slope. And they started shutting down some people's bank accounts. So it's like, that's.
00:34:38.321 - 00:34:40.689, Speaker C: Yeah, that's not grounds for freezing of assets.
00:34:40.737 - 00:34:41.377, Speaker B: That's.
00:34:41.521 - 00:34:42.561, Speaker A: I know. So it.
00:34:42.633 - 00:34:48.185, Speaker D: No, I mean, even the Canadian, like, Supreme Court even, like, ruled against that. Like, that was unconstitutional to.
00:34:48.265 - 00:35:09.425, Speaker A: Yeah, but my whole point is it's a very slippery slope, Right. Like, on one time, you could just say, okay, they're. They're protesters who are, like, maybe getting, like, aggressive with blocking the roads and stuff. And then, like, it slips to, like, oh, we're calling them terrorists because of this. And it can get very messy. Like, nobody knows really what the full truth is in so many situations.
00:35:09.505 - 00:35:39.391, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the EU is heading to a point where it's basically going to have, like, its own Internet, like, similar to China or whatever. Like, you saw the guy send that open letter to Elon, threatening him or whatever. I mean, already the cookies thing, and like, EU just has a different approach to things, Right. They believe that regulation by this bureaucratic central body is what markets need. And, like, I fundamentally disagree with that. Even as a European.
00:35:39.463 - 00:35:39.623, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:39.639 - 00:35:57.961, Speaker B: We kind of saw it with the cookies law. Like, what changed? I just have to click accept before I go onto all these websites. Like, everyone just goes and clicks, click, clicks, accept. And I think that this is, like, forcing people to comply with the fsa, right, that's just been put in. Like, they're basically threatening to ban Twitter.
00:35:58.033 - 00:35:58.241, Speaker A: Right?
00:35:58.273 - 00:36:13.093, Speaker B: That was what that. That was what was implied in that letter that he sent to Elon. If that's the case, you end up with your own siloed, like, European Internet, which seems even worse for innovation and tech in Europe, which is already, like.
00:36:13.149 - 00:36:17.145, Speaker C: No better way to kickstart a dwindling continent.
00:36:17.485 - 00:36:21.853, Speaker B: Well, you're not kickstarting it, sadly. You're just sort of continuing to try.
00:36:21.869 - 00:36:27.453, Speaker C: And they need to do something to kickstart innovation, growth, anything.
00:36:27.549 - 00:36:32.397, Speaker D: Yeah, honestly, fuck Europe for the cookies thing. That is just, like, so stupid.
00:36:32.461 - 00:36:33.981, Speaker C: Europe's just turning into a museum.
00:36:34.053 - 00:36:35.693, Speaker D: It's like, the worst possible.
00:36:35.869 - 00:37:03.027, Speaker A: But yeah, so this lays a really nice, like, breeding ground for these decentralized. If someone were to make, like, you know, it's very hard because you have to get the network effects, you have to get the users, you have to make the UX comparable and people have to have a reason to switch. But it definitely feels like we're heading in that direction and maybe even like if Pavel gets released, maybe he's going to think more about putting stuff on ton or you know, blockchain.
00:37:03.131 - 00:37:24.431, Speaker B: It's just. It also makes the stakes way higher though. Right. Like it also means that you have to have way bigger, way bigger cojones to go develop on crypto rails. If you can literally get. Get arrested like whether it's the tornado cash case or this if. And this is not like sec sort of like fines and civil cases.
00:37:24.431 - 00:37:27.503, Speaker B: This is like hard jail.
00:37:27.599 - 00:37:30.271, Speaker D: No, no, but this is crypto rails. This is just like.
00:37:30.423 - 00:37:41.837, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean if regulators get increasingly aggressive on people developing these kinds of platforms and hold them responsible for any action that happens on them, it's definitely going to be make it harder for people to want to do that.
00:37:42.021 - 00:37:42.645, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:42.765 - 00:37:47.717, Speaker D: Yeah. I feel like entrepreneurship is being less and less celebrated in the west.
00:37:47.781 - 00:37:48.349, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:48.477 - 00:37:51.445, Speaker A: Which is more like they're enforcing more.
00:37:51.485 - 00:37:54.133, Speaker C: Sprinkle a 25% unrealized.
00:37:54.309 - 00:37:59.965, Speaker B: Anyway, should we get back to coins? People don't come to us for political commentary. I feel like I was trying to.
00:38:00.005 - 00:38:03.219, Speaker A: Tie it into coins. Are we filing the coins?
00:38:03.307 - 00:38:05.695, Speaker D: Coins dumping now.
00:38:06.835 - 00:38:15.495, Speaker A: Yeah, I know but. But honestly like what are interesting projects in this area? I feel like our weave is the one that keeps. I keep coming back to does anyone permanent storage.
00:38:15.875 - 00:38:16.563, Speaker B: Yeah but.
00:38:16.619 - 00:38:19.375, Speaker A: But you can make like on it.
00:38:19.995 - 00:38:23.579, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I feel like we probably need some more time.
00:38:23.707 - 00:38:24.375, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:24.755 - 00:38:25.659, Speaker B: Just on this stuff.
00:38:25.707 - 00:38:27.925, Speaker A: We'll research that for next week.
00:38:28.385 - 00:38:46.245, Speaker B: I think crypto X AI is one of the most interesting sectors here just because I think AI is the next. It's already happening in terms of people passing stupid AI regulations. But yeah, I think that's going to be a big one too. Do we want to move on to maker on theme with their Skynet rebrand?
00:38:46.585 - 00:39:34.351, Speaker C: Yeah. So Maker long awaited rebrand that's been kind of hinted at for a while. Basically in 21 or so days it'll launch and what you can do is Dai will be upgradable 1 to 1 for USDs. Maker will be upgradable 1 to 24,000 denomination to sky and you don't have to do it. So some can stay with the native asset, some can rebrand. The the reason you'd want to rebrand is because there are going to be kind of incentives that that will exist for maker holders. So basically, if you're, if you're.
00:39:34.351 - 00:40:22.781, Speaker C: As a sky holder, you'll be able to lock up tokens and they'll stream. There's kind of, you know, a few games to play in terms of like locking up for an extended period or a short amount of time, but. But without going into each specifically, basically people will lock up to earn a combination of surplus income from the protocol and a certain portion of the spark supply, which is going to be a new token that'll launch. And then USDS holders will also be able to get a yield via a spark token kind of being distributed. And so yeah, the idea is that the big. One of the. I think the big sticking points for people is the fact that now USDS is freezable.
00:40:22.781 - 00:40:57.541, Speaker C: Right. So DAI still won't be, but USDS will be. Which goes against the vision of the concept of a decentralized stable coin backed by a decentralized asset. You still have it backed by, partially backed by a decentralized asset in terms of eth. But now it's no longer, you know, a decentralized staple because accounts and wallets can be frozen. And so, yeah, price reacted pretty negatively to the news. I think it's just, you know, because of where the market is right now.
00:40:57.541 - 00:41:16.585, Speaker C: Most things are a sell the news. And then I think it was a bit underwhelming in terms of, you know, the shift away from a decentralized stablecoin via the freezing. And then, yeah, all this stuff will go live in like, I think it's on in 21 or so days in September.
00:41:17.285 - 00:41:25.637, Speaker B: And how does it get frozen, by the way? Is it like, is it a multisig or. Yeah, who, who free. Who controls the freezing function?
00:41:25.781 - 00:41:27.345, Speaker C: That I'm not sure of.
00:41:27.965 - 00:41:34.749, Speaker D: I also think the redenomination is kind of cringe, like you're making it. It's like 8 cents or something.
00:41:34.877 - 00:41:37.757, Speaker C: I think unit bias is a real thing in crypto though.
00:41:37.901 - 00:42:11.825, Speaker D: No, but it's like there's enough. But there's been enough. There's been enough studies on this and psychologically the optimal price range is like 20 to $80. And they could have just done crypto for socks for stocks. Yeah, but, but like, I don't know if this is. It's true with meme coins, but like what Low unit bias, like somewhat fundamental play has done well because of this. Like didn't wi fi try this with like Wolfie or whatever and it pumped for a bit.
00:42:11.825 - 00:42:25.365, Speaker D: It was just people arbing the price between the Two, like, I don't know. I found it kind of like lame, to be honest. Yeah.
00:42:25.405 - 00:42:28.621, Speaker C: I mean if there's a time to do it, it's now. I think it makes sense.
00:42:28.813 - 00:42:46.649, Speaker A: I. I notice it even like with Meta that's $3,000 a coin. I feel like I have so few shares. Like I feel poor when I hold my mad ever is this holding something that's like if it was 3 cents a share but I have a lot of shares. It. It really messes with your head.
00:42:46.697 - 00:42:49.553, Speaker D: I swear I've never had this like feeling.
00:42:49.609 - 00:42:50.273, Speaker B: Me neither.
00:42:50.409 - 00:43:02.337, Speaker A: Something going from $0.01 to $0.02 is totally different than something going from $100 to $200. Like just in my. I know it's not different at all, but psychologically still, as long as it.
00:43:02.361 - 00:43:04.465, Speaker C: Impacts some people, then it makes sense to do it.
00:43:04.505 - 00:43:04.801, Speaker D: Right.
00:43:04.873 - 00:43:06.553, Speaker C: That's the kind of the no but.
00:43:06.569 - 00:43:27.009, Speaker D: The counter argument to it and why 20 to 80 is the. Is like the prime range is because it begins it makes a lot of people now take your product or like whatever less seriously. Right. And so there's actually a negative effect from having like the low unit and he kind of just come off as like a joke in a sense. And like I think that makes sense.
00:43:27.177 - 00:43:37.353, Speaker C: In with like stocks because older generations might as soon associate it with like pink slip. Not pink slip. What are they?
00:43:37.489 - 00:43:40.705, Speaker D: What's the like the pink sheets? The Pink sheets?
00:43:40.745 - 00:43:57.353, Speaker C: Yeah, the pink sheet stocks that those are all like kind of traded with those prices. And so I think there's some kind of negative association from the older investor base. But I feel like the younger crypto peeps probably gravitate towards the smaller numbers.
00:43:57.449 - 00:43:59.165, Speaker A: More share is better.
00:44:00.905 - 00:44:20.921, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean it was hard for a one year rebrand to really like not be a sell the news event. Right. Like you've been hinting it for so long, people are gonna have really high expectations for it. I don't know, the whole rebrand and like having all these coins and stuff just seems like maker trying to be. I mean I'm. And I'm.
00:44:20.921 - 00:44:34.257, Speaker B: I've been holding maker all through this to unfortunately. But it seems like maker trying to be. Trying to be something it's not. Right. It's like hey kids, are we pumping some coins today? You know what I mean?
00:44:34.401 - 00:44:42.245, Speaker D: I was just going to say it's the meme when the guy like I'm somewhat of a whatever myself. I'm somewhat of a meme coin myself.
00:44:42.825 - 00:44:44.281, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:44:44.473 - 00:45:16.465, Speaker B: After hating on Defi summer and stuff like that. But I do think yeah I don't know, I was a bit underwhelmed with the, with the rebrand, but I kind of expect it to be, you know, it's probably like a branding agency thing. But I do think that this overall it's like pretty, pretty bullish Maker having all these coins, they're going to basically be used to kind of subsidize die growth like Spark itself is. Especially with the AAVE growth recently it seems like Spark itself is going to be like nine figures of dollar distribution to, to maker holders.
00:45:16.925 - 00:46:01.931, Speaker C: Robby from our research team put out a post on it and basically he was saying that he's expecting a decent amount of USDs supply growth somewhere to the tune of one and a half billion based on kind of, you know, an assumed 1 billion FTV for Spark and then an accepted yield of 15% for USDs. So I, I do think that combined with, you know, yield for holding, Maker will kind of, you know, you have your supply sync demand kind of grow like boost in demand, increase in supply sync mechanics that I think it'll probably do well into the launch or at least from here considering how much it sold off.
00:46:02.083 - 00:46:40.209, Speaker D: Yeah, I saw another take though. That was good. That is like this wasn't a new product launch, it was like a compliance launch because they added way more compliance features than they ever had with Maker. So it's like, you know, blocks us obviously. It also blocks VPN so it can tell us if you're using a vpn they've got the freeze function that we talked about. And so there was like a lot of added compliance features. And so I mean when you think about MakerDAO now, it's basically like, I guess you want a piece of the, like the circle, the tether business.
00:46:40.209 - 00:47:09.595, Speaker D: You can kind of get that here. Right? And so it kind of democratizes like ownership in that business. But it's not like what it originally was like the original ethos. Right. And maybe that's just like a function of. There just was not product market fit with that. Because how many people really ended up needing a like I don't know how many people actually use die because they needed to use die?
00:47:10.295 - 00:47:36.125, Speaker C: No, it was a byproduct of leverage. Yeah, well, it was also like early on it was move fast and break stuff and then once you get bigger it's like, all right, how do we preserve this and let it grow? I do wonder if it was a, you know, something that's the adjustment was to cater to the current administration and if there's a change and regulations Ease up. Then maybe they get another rebrand and make some adjustments.
00:47:36.505 - 00:47:44.753, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean so they're getting 17.5% of total spark Dao supply per year for the next two years, right?
00:47:44.929 - 00:48:04.281, Speaker D: Yeah. But the whole way total, you have to like lock up your tokens I think for some egregious amount of time and then if you unstake you lose like 15% of your tokens or something like I gotta look into it. But there are some massive. Yeah like penalties. There's some massive penalties for unstaking.
00:48:04.473 - 00:48:12.765, Speaker A: I don't know how this works but if you have to lock up liquid tokens, be careful. So almost never works out.
00:48:13.425 - 00:48:14.205, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:17.105 - 00:48:18.325, Speaker B: I didn't see that.
00:48:19.145 - 00:48:24.189, Speaker C: There's a no exit, there's a no lock one also which you assume it just has lower yield.
00:48:24.357 - 00:48:25.493, Speaker D: Yeah, true.
00:48:25.549 - 00:48:29.877, Speaker A: Yeah just be care if you care about trading and stuff that's like I've.
00:48:29.901 - 00:48:33.105, Speaker D: Seen a lot of you care about money.
00:48:33.405 - 00:48:45.465, Speaker A: Yeah, like don't. Unless you're a long term investor and really want whatever you're getting. Be very like put a heavy discount on whatever extra yield you're getting.
00:48:46.405 - 00:48:49.551, Speaker B: Gem hunder, always looking out for the a common man.
00:48:49.743 - 00:48:54.795, Speaker A: Extra 10% yield when the bag goes down 50% it's not worth it.
00:48:55.335 - 00:49:09.435, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do think it's. Oh overall it's the right approach though. Like every kind of stable coin learns this. Right. You need to vertically integrate the whole stack. It's just really not going far enough and like kind of took too long.
00:49:09.435 - 00:49:56.975, Speaker B: Like Robby in the alphafeed note mentioned they should have launched like a wallet right. And gone deeper into payments and stuff like this which I think would have been pretty interesting. I also wonder how much DAI actually moves over. I think that'll be really interesting because I heard someone told me, I never checked that this was true actually but that basically over one and a half billion dollars of DAI hasn't moved in two years. Which is wild. Right, because you're basically giving up the S Dai yield which at some point was like 15% or something along those lines and hasn't moved. And that's like the most bullish thing I heard about maker in a while and I wonder if that will now move to USDS or if it just stays stuck and die and what all those people are doing.
00:49:58.555 - 00:50:01.135, Speaker D: That's like 30% of the. That's a lot.
00:50:01.435 - 00:50:03.547, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean it's bullish for hopefully.
00:50:03.571 - 00:50:04.815, Speaker B: Someone fact checks me.
00:50:06.515 - 00:50:12.125, Speaker C: If nothing moves over then there's a lot more yield to be had for for new USDS supply.
00:50:13.865 - 00:50:14.685, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:15.145 - 00:50:18.445, Speaker A: Jose, are there any other 10% yield?
00:50:21.185 - 00:50:31.049, Speaker D: You know what Die was actually useful for is when Tornado Cash because it had like no freeze on it and then people used it but now that's like gone as a use case too.
00:50:31.137 - 00:50:33.645, Speaker A: Yeah, people just swap Die still has that use case.
00:50:34.305 - 00:50:43.329, Speaker D: I mean it kind of does, but I mean Tornado Cash just doesn't have the same value that it used to with us not using it.
00:50:43.457 - 00:50:51.165, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. It's not what it used to be and it's sort of pivoting closer to USDC and stuff. Definitely agree with all that.
00:50:52.545 - 00:51:18.241, Speaker D: A lot of stable coins designs like M0 and Agora are doing these interesting things too. Where actually Robbie's posting a piece today. He goes into like moats. It's pretty cool. But he talks about some of these different stablecoin models too. About how something like M0 actually lets like applications mint the stable coins. The yield actually goes to the application.
00:51:18.241 - 00:51:34.775, Speaker D: So instead of like circle or like tether holding these treasuries and banking all the yield, the application actually gets a lot of that pass through, which is pretty cool model. But yeah. What did you want to go into? Like prediction markets?
00:51:35.195 - 00:51:36.015, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:36.595 - 00:51:36.883, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:36.899 - 00:51:53.377, Speaker B: I need to look into the M0 thing. I've heard good things about it. Yeah. I don't know. I still, still, still think Athena's best positioned in the, in the stablecoin. Like vertical. Yeah.
00:51:53.377 - 00:52:17.893, Speaker B: And I still think you do have to verticalize. Like you can't just build the stable coin and hope they will come. That's why mzero is kind of interesting because I guess you use apps as your distribution for your stablecoin but I feel like you can kind of do that anyway. Right. Like for instance, all the L2s did that with Athena. Right. You would deposit USD and then they would like stake it and keep the yield or distribute some of it or whatever.
00:52:17.893 - 00:52:20.031, Speaker B: Doesn't seem that innovative.
00:52:20.103 - 00:52:35.103, Speaker D: Sure. It's also a different model though. We're talking about like a fiat backed cash stable coin versus this synthetic dollar. It's like just a completely different. Some people just might not want. They just want the fiat dollar in the bank. Stablecoin.
00:52:35.103 - 00:52:35.783, Speaker D: Right?
00:52:35.959 - 00:52:36.755, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:37.055 - 00:52:56.281, Speaker C: I think the other difference is basically what the natural source of yield is for a lot of these. If you pass through via Treasuries as rates come down that, that kind of becomes less appealing versus one that's a function of just demand to go long. So you have an organic yield that actually improves as rates come down. Yeah.
00:52:56.313 - 00:53:12.915, Speaker B: I think everyone's going to end up doing Treasuries. Like, I think Athena will end up doing Treasuries too. Honestly, I think everyone's just going to have that baseline of Treasuries and then you're just going to have to find higher sources of yield. And then I think it's mostly honestly, like go to market like the.
00:53:13.035 - 00:53:13.775, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:14.075 - 00:53:17.055, Speaker B: And building an ecosystem around your. Your stablecoin.
00:53:17.635 - 00:53:38.415, Speaker A: Yeah. But I don't know, like, now that the BTC and ETH ETF are out, will yields for BTC and ETH ever get, like, really crazy again? Because like the hedge funds can put on the basis trade and they can do it with a lot more capital than I feel like in better margin requirements via the ETF than like crypto hedge funds.
00:53:39.215 - 00:53:41.319, Speaker B: Couldn't you do this for the CME anyway?
00:53:41.487 - 00:54:02.955, Speaker A: I think that you can maybe post. The BDC is like the BTC ETF is collateral for doing the CME trade versus before. Like what? I don't know what you're actually posting as collateral for the cme. Like if they would accept something else. But that could be not true. I think I've read that. I don't know the intricacies of it, but it makes sense in theory.
00:54:04.585 - 00:54:07.713, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. Prediction markets last.
00:54:07.849 - 00:54:08.569, Speaker D: I think we should.
00:54:08.617 - 00:54:09.209, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:54:09.337 - 00:54:20.921, Speaker D: I think we should just end it. Maybe we'll talk about prediction markets next week. I mean, it's been an hour. You want to, like, go into this. This is like a big topic.
00:54:20.993 - 00:54:21.645, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:22.425 - 00:54:26.057, Speaker B: We can maybe cut some of the long political stuff. I don't know.
00:54:26.121 - 00:54:27.929, Speaker A: I thought that was good. That's important.
00:54:28.057 - 00:54:29.787, Speaker C: I thought that was fun. Yeah.
00:54:29.851 - 00:54:31.495, Speaker B: All right. All right.
00:54:32.035 - 00:54:34.015, Speaker C: Don't get chopped out of your bags.
00:54:34.315 - 00:54:35.027, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:35.171 - 00:54:36.947, Speaker B: Don't get shoved out of your bags. Yeah, exactly.
00:54:36.971 - 00:54:37.651, Speaker A: That's true.
00:54:37.763 - 00:54:55.675, Speaker B: That is the message of this episode. No actionable tickers. Duncan has not yet shilled banana. All right, guys, thanks very much for tuning in to another episode of the Hive Mind. Hope you enjoyed it. And yeah, please leave us comments. We should actually respond to the YouTube and everything comments.
00:54:55.675 - 00:55:00.215, Speaker B: I'll go through and do that. We'll start responding. We promise. See you again in two weeks.
