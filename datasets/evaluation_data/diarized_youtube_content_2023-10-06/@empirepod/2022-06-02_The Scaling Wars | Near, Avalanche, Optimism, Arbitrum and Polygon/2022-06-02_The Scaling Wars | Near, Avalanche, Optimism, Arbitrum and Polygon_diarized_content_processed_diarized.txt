00:00:00.160 - 00:00:00.742, Speaker A: I'm going to pick on you.
00:00:00.758 - 00:00:02.382, Speaker B: If you could actually lead us off.
00:00:02.398 - 00:00:11.150, Speaker A: Here, kind of describe these two different visions, the mono chain versus the multi chain future, and maybe this kind of door number three option, which you call the super chain. So give us your framework here.
00:00:11.302 - 00:00:57.294, Speaker B: Yeah. So, okay, what's the context here? We have these chains, these great global trust layers, magic, trusted computer in the cloud, right, whatever you want to call it. And obviously, we're all very familiar that we want to increase the usage of these platforms and we need to scale. And so there's definitely question of how do you do that architecturally, technologically? And there's, like you said, basically, I think, two prevailing schools of thought here. There's a mono chain, and the idea of a mono chain is there's basically one big chain that we can really scale up, make it way faster, parallelize the heck out of it, and run the world's crypto on that. There are a lot of advantages that you get with that, right? One huge one is you get composability, right? You're sort of flash loans and this sort of thing. And that clearly has economic efficiencies.
00:00:57.294 - 00:01:46.854, Speaker B: There's clearly a UX boost when you're on Ethereum, and you can move to any other Ethereum application really easily use them both in one transaction, whatever it may be. The problem is that those are by definition monolithic. And sort of all the transactions on them are the same. And so if you are sufficiently bullish enough on crypto, you should realize that there will be way more demand than could be satisfied by any one chain. And simultaneously there should be classes of transactions that have different security versus cost trade offs. There are just some applications, like a game or a really cheap NFT, or whatever it may be, that you don't want to pay for the world's state resistant blockchain trust layer. So there's another point of view which kind of looks at that and says, there should be many chains, the multi chain future, and these should all talk to each other slowly.
00:01:46.854 - 00:02:35.684, Speaker B: And because we'll have many chains, we'll be able to scale more and we'll have a more sort of heterogeneous model. Heterogeneous, I don't know how you pronounce that. So I think those are the big two prevailing schools of thought that we have in scaling right now in general. Hi, I'm Ben from optimism layer two scaling solution. So our view at optimism is generally that these are basically two sides of the same coin, and that really what is really going to exist in the future is the super chain, which has all those properties of a mono chain, but also has a heterogeneous model where some people can pay a lot for really secure transactions and some people can pay a little for not. But you still have sort of one big composable chain and it looks and feels like one chain anyway. So there's a little bit on how optimism thinks about scaling.
00:02:35.844 - 00:02:49.670, Speaker A: I think that's a great framework to lay it out. And we kind of have representatives from maybe two of those different schools of thoughts, right? I didn't give everyone a chance to introduce themselves, but maybe we could go around the horn actually, and you guys could just say a quick word about where you're working right now, the project that you're working on and we'll start there.
00:02:49.782 - 00:03:35.884, Speaker C: Sure. Hey everyone, I'm Milya, co founder of Nier Protocol. Nir is sharded mono chain, but from perspective of school of thought, I actually fully agree with the vision of actually having this spectrum versus a points of it's either this or that. And so kind of allowing ability for users and for developers to decide where on the spectrum they need to be, from highly composable, fast finality on the sharded blockchain, to moving on to having their own shard, to moving on to having their own side chain, et cetera. That's really definitely the part of the vision kind of expanding beyond.
00:03:37.264 - 00:04:47.032, Speaker D: Hi everyone, I am Mikhailo, I'm co founder of Polygon and Polygon is a multi chain scaling platform. Again, I fully align with what Ben said and what Thalia said. We believe in the multichain future and we believe that's the only viable future if we want to onboard the world to this exciting new framework or this exciting new network of value and people that we're trying to build with web three. Polygon is the most adopted, I believe, blockchain scaling infrastructure platform right after Ethereum, with more than 20,000 applications at this moment, we are an agnostic platform and we cover a wide variety of infrastructures, architectures, everything from fully independent TVM chains up to on the second part of the extreme, on the other part of the extreme, full blown layer, two solutions. And we working and onboarding these 20,000 applications, we definitely realized that there's a lot of variety in terms of requirements. So enterprises have completely different requirements and expectations compared to web three native projects. And that's one reason why we decided to offer this agnostic approach and to support multiple solutions.
00:04:47.032 - 00:05:13.340, Speaker D: The other reason is that we are still in the very early stage of this industry trying to, I mean, we have this grand vision of onboarding the whole world to web three, and we're really in the early stage of the industry. We will need years to basically build this robust infrastructure that can actually support this grand vision that we have. And at this point of time, we really believe that we need this flexibility in terms of technologies.
00:05:13.532 - 00:05:52.344, Speaker E: Thank you everybody. I'm Luigi from Ava Labs, head of DeFi there really focused on building out another layer. One blockchain. Avalanche has a lot of different unique capabilities as it relates to scaling horizontally with something we call subnets. Avalanche also boasts a very new consensus mechanism which allows for subsec and finality, while also not necessarily while allowing the ability to increase nodes. So about 1600 nodes at the current time. And then also at the same time, we have very robust DeFi ecosystems about depending on how you measure, well, after the recent nuke, probably about 6 billion in TVL.
00:05:52.344 - 00:06:27.170, Speaker E: And so we are also taking a different approach, I think, than some of the other projects here in terms of how we want to scale. We tried to increase block space horizontally by what we call these subnets. So we recently launched two of them. Both of them were in the gaming sphere. So they allow for separate instances of block space to be consumed without impacting what you might refer to as the primary chain, which is the Avalanche C chain. These are all EVM compatible, but Avalanche also allows for custom vms. It's vm agnostic on the subnet layer.
00:06:27.170 - 00:06:52.644, Speaker E: So we are seeing experimentation with respect to people trying to build custom vms for various purposes. While I think that's a very unexplored area, I think that we'll see various institutional players come in and try to customize AVM for their specific purpose. But at the same time, the most adopted part of Avalanche is the EVM compatible seachain that we have.
00:06:54.104 - 00:06:54.896, Speaker D: Cool.
00:06:55.080 - 00:07:37.690, Speaker F: Hey there. My name is Harry. I am one of the co founders of Arbitrum. We are building a optimistic roll up on Ethereum with general EVM support. Our goal is to build essentially a cheaper, faster extension to Ethereum that provides users with the kind of ethereum experience that they know and love, except without the part that they don't love, like high gas fees and slow block inclusion. And so we've been on Mainnet for over a year now, and we have kind of most of the main dapps of Ethereum have bridged over to arbitrum already and are supporting arbitrum instances. And we're really excited to be here and just to kind of throw one point on top of kind of the earlier discussion.
00:07:37.690 - 00:08:01.934, Speaker F: One of the cool things that rollups bring to Ethereum is the fact that you can have this sort of heterogeneous layer on top of the more monolithic layer, which is Ethereum. And so you can kind of build out this sort of interesting conversation, like this interesting sort of composition where you can have sort of experiments and differences on the kind of top layer, well, depending on kind of a single shared layer underneath.
00:08:03.174 - 00:09:01.614, Speaker A: So maybe to frame that kind of the monochain versus multi chain future into the more popular narrative that maybe you see on crypto and we can talk about it, is there's kind of like a battle right in between kind of ETH supporters and folks that are building on Ethereum and then alternative layer one, some of these newer layer ones, the nearest and avalanches of the world that have cropped up in the last couple of years. So if I could kind of simplify it into two schools of thought, ETH was kind of their first. There's this enormous emphasis on decentralization, extreme security, et cetera. And the scaling solution for that was always going to be layer two s that enabled you to reduce costs, but obviously took a little bit more time than folks would have wanted. And some new layer ones cropped up that allowed people to transact more cheaply. I'd be curious if that's how you guys think about that. In the developer community and people who are actually building these solutions, do you see those as being fundamentally competitive? Do you see a world where all chains coexist? How do you view, like, the intersection of these different chains and opportunities?
00:09:02.114 - 00:09:31.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's interesting. I think if you look at the history of Ethereum, one thing you said is like, layer two has always been the future of Ethereum scaling. I would counter that a little bit. I do think that there was a period of time before Ethereum started following a roll up centric roadmap where there was a strong emphasis on sharding, and specifically like phase two of sharding, which was the execution sharding. And so I think that's what we see some of the other panelists, especially Nier, up here talking about. Right. Yeah, I remember those days when we were going over all the YouTube sharing designs.
00:09:31.942 - 00:09:58.284, Speaker B: So in general, yeah, I think that's accurate. I think for the philosophy of optimism and roll ups in general, like Ethereum is the gold standard of security and it has the social critical mass. And also, quite frankly, it came with all the values that we are really here to promote and double down on. So in general, I agree. I think over time, layer two, the emphasis on layer two has grown much stronger for Ethereum, but otherwise agree.
00:09:59.384 - 00:10:05.128, Speaker A: And Ilya, I know you're about to speak here. Maybe you could also, just for the audience, if they're not aware of what sharding is, if you could give a brief definition and then respond.
00:10:05.176 - 00:10:05.400, Speaker D: Ilya.
00:10:05.432 - 00:10:43.484, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So sharding kind of in general, is concept of parallelizing execution, running it on different machines. And so if you're using Google, if you're using Facebook, they don't store everything on a single machine. There's lots of servers, and the data and computation is distributed among them. And so the interesting thing is the only way to scale is to paralyze things independently of how you do it. That's an approach everybody's taking. And if you think of rollups, you're pretty much just spinning up multiple roll ups that are trying to parallelize things.
00:10:43.484 - 00:11:47.786, Speaker C: Kind of optimism, arbitrum running in parallel, having its own block space, and then settling on the same security layer. If you're thinking of Cosmos chains, well, they all running in parallel and only communicate independently. If you think of Polkadot para chains, again, they're running in parallel, and then you have a common core that actually settles in. And so in a way, there's a spectrum from kind of like a fully monolithic, not sharded, not paralyzed chain to Cosmos, where everything's paralyzed, there's no common security. And so there's different kind of places in the spectrum where everybody falls and roll ups live right on the side of like, hey, we're running in parallel, but we secure with the same layer one. But the issue is that is now, as a user, you need to be aware of which roll up you're on similarly with parachains, similarly with cosmos chains, et cetera. And so what these two original ideas were right.
00:11:47.786 - 00:12:58.262, Speaker C: And kind of us coming in from web two space as well, where we believe in simplicity for the users and developers as well, is a user understanding exactly what chain they're on should not be part of the story, right? They should not be part of it. Eventually, I think we're all going to converge into some design that actually high doses. But right now, super chain. Super chain. I mean, I think it will be a combination of, yeah, you can have, like, different provisioned things, but the same account model, the same wallets, etcetera. And so we started in the space where we offer kind of the same experience, but underneath the number of shards, the kind of shard layout where state is can be completely changed and redesigned and that allows that's very much modeled after how web two companies work, where you don't need to think about am I watching a movie from this data center or that data center? Am I on this shard of Facebook server because they sharded their thing by universities or not, that's not something users need to think. That's really what I would say Nier is modeling after.
00:12:58.262 - 00:13:34.154, Speaker C: And then within that you can still have things like Aurora, which is EVM compatible, smart contract that runs on top. And actually from perspective of users, it looks like a roll up because it has kind of EVM compatibility. All this with its own RPC points that runs and it has actually its own block space because it runs in its own shard, but it actually is within the same model. And so other contracts can call it. So in a way it's a realistic roll up. And so what sharding is, is really a realistic roll ups, meaning they get validated right away as the transaction gets submitted.
00:13:35.414 - 00:14:20.590, Speaker D: Yeah. So to Ilya's point, basically sharding is essentially a parallelization. And I guess all of us, all these projects here are assuming some sort of parallelization, whether it's multiple roll ups, whether it's homogeneous sharding, whether it's polygons, multi chain, whether it's avalanche set of subnets, this is all basically parallelization, or if you will, sharding in some more abstract way, I guess. So. I guess we agree that's the only way to scale and reach the amount of scale that we need again to onboard the world, to web three. And to your question about Ethereum versus other layer ones, if you will. I think Ethereum basically introduced this grand vision, at least in our opinion, of this global permissionless network of Lu and people, and basically sold us this dream.
00:14:20.590 - 00:15:10.292, Speaker D: And some sort of perfect storm happened with Ethereum, where so many people came together. And even today you see teams all across the world popping up, random people starting their projects to build more of the Ethereum infrastructure. And we have never seen that yet. We haven't seen that yet with any other layer one. And I think it's going to be really hard to replicate or to do that again with any other layer one. My personal opinion, of course, time might prove me wrong, but hence why we decided to build on the shoulder of the giant to be fully compatible with Ethereum. And we are integral part of the Ethereum community and that really, that was a great decision for us and the Ethereum community kind of embraced us, and that's why we went from 30 applications within a year and several months to 20,000 applications today.
00:15:10.292 - 00:15:37.152, Speaker D: And that basically shows that demonstrates the power of the Ethereum community. But that being said, I think maybe the bullish case for alternative layer ones is exactly what Ilya said. Maybe one day, or what Ben is mentioning, this super chain, if you will, where we will have some sort of abstraction and users will not even know what chain maybe what l one are they using? So in my opinion, that might be the bullish case for alternative l one.
00:15:37.168 - 00:16:03.604, Speaker E: S. Yeah, I mean, I would have to agree. Frankly, the way I view it is we're all here because of Ethereum. That's kind of like they first opened the door for all of us, and now because of that, we get to innovate and try and build better. I am not a big fan of an environment whereby there is only one chain that we're all building on top of. I think that's inherently risky. I think that also inherently defeats the purpose of competition in the space.
00:16:03.604 - 00:16:58.774, Speaker E: I think we want a bunch of layer ones competing, grinding and competing as much as possible to try and push the bounds of science and trying to end up with the most finalized, the fastest finality of transactions, the most decentralized consensus. I think we want to find out what that is. We're six years in here, maybe seven or so. It's very, very early with respect to the science of some of this stuff, but we have come a long way in a short amount of time. With that said, I think having 4510, whatever the number might be, of layer ones competing and battling for this, I don't want to say grand prize, because I don't think that's what ends up happening. But to actually innovate and compete with each other, I think that's an ideal scenario that everybody should want. I also think it's inherently risky to put everything on one major chain.
00:16:58.774 - 00:17:15.964, Speaker E: I know. Even if it's the most decentralized chain, super chain, or whatever it is, at a certain point, if anything goes wrong and every single financial transaction is settling upon that chain, I don't think we want an environment where that's the only option. So I think it's good to have options.
00:17:17.704 - 00:18:12.674, Speaker F: Well, this has been covered really well already, so I don't have a ton to add, but just to double down, I'd say, on a couple things. I mean, I think that the idea of sort of continuing to drive innovation is kind of critically important. I mean, the ethereum community itself has been doing it. A lot of really impressive work going on at other l ones have been doing it. I'm very confident that the blockchain space today is not what it will look like in five years. It's not what it'll look like in ten years. The amount of work going on right now in order to figure out how to kind of bring us to this sort of promised land of global adoption is critically important and very time critical, because we need to sort of stay ahead of the adoption curve and kind of putting all our forces together in order to kind of really work to that mission is just so important.
00:18:15.614 - 00:19:12.992, Speaker B: Okay, I've got a couple of comments on what you all said. I do think that the notion of competing l one s does have a counter argument, which is worth stating, which is that if you imagine a bunch of competing l one s and you imagine that they're competing for, like, some sort of decentralized security provider sort of supply curve, then it is. Then you could argue that by having a bunch of these, you are distributing the security between multiple places, and it would actually be more secure if it was all in one decentralized network. Right. I think the only other thing that I would add is that I do agree that parallelization is kind of what we're all doing. But I think that to say that we parallelize that rollups parallelize by having multiple rollups only is just evidence of the early parts of rollups that we've seen so far. So basically, what's going on in optimism right now is we have a huge push to be able to not just run the EVM, but run arbitrary, go lang arbitrary programs in l two.
00:19:12.992 - 00:19:37.564, Speaker B: And I think once you have that, basically all of the sharded l one designs port right over to l two. So we're expecting future iterations of optimism to literally be one rollup, but have the sharded parallelism properties within the one rollup. So I do think that if I were an l one right now, I would take all the awesome execution stuff I would do, I would turn it into an l two, secure it onto ethereum, and I'd be good to go.
00:19:39.324 - 00:19:42.172, Speaker E: So, I mean, I'll take the bait.
00:19:42.348 - 00:19:43.744, Speaker D: We can close the panel.
00:19:46.004 - 00:20:39.924, Speaker E: I'll take the bait because I like Ben. I think l two s have a very, very, very important place, and I think they're going to play an important role in scaling. I don't think they are the best for certain things. In particular, finance is one of the things that I think is less optimal on a layer two than an l one. Just to play devil's advocate, what I'd say here is one of the really nice properties of blockchains in particular is this ability to finalize a transaction super fast, especially from finance perspective. If I am able to settle large amounts of us stocks, for example, on a blockchain, there's this really nice property, if it's instantly final, where I know that I'm not going to fail on settlements. Anybody who's worked in an operations department at a bank knows what happens when there's fails.
00:20:39.924 - 00:21:22.704, Speaker E: It leads to a domino effect of fails behind it. So I think having this instant finality of transactions is super important. Obviously, there's a delay in between the time of execution and when the transaction is permanently final. So I would say that from that perspective, there is a counter argument to that. In addition, I do think that when you have a lot of capital at place in a certain, I would say on a chain, you do want the security of a certain amount of value staked. That is commensurate with the amount of value on the chain. So you don't want a scenario whereby you have $20 billion of TVL on a chain and $2 billion securing it.
00:21:22.704 - 00:21:32.832, Speaker E: That's inherently risky. So I think that those two things combined would make me think that finance, there is a place for execution on l one directly.
00:21:32.928 - 00:21:36.992, Speaker B: But then wouldn't you want all of the security budget to go on one chain?
00:21:37.048 - 00:21:40.856, Speaker E: No, that's like the CME. There's one place where everything can break.
00:21:41.000 - 00:21:50.722, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. I think the main thing I would say is you get instant transactions and optimism too. So I agree that that's important, but also you can make them more final by putting them on l one. I want both. I want both.
00:21:50.818 - 00:22:05.898, Speaker C: I agree. The funny part is like, line of near is actually settles on Ethereum. And by the way, like client of Ethereum is on near. So, you know, who is l two? To whom is an interesting question. And oh boy, I mean, will you.
00:22:05.906 - 00:22:06.854, Speaker B: Be my l two?
00:22:07.234 - 00:22:43.774, Speaker C: But that's the question is like layer two is actually, first of all, a perspective thing, right? It's like you're saying, we're using this for security of that, but at the same time you can say like from the other side, it works as well, whoever has more security in the way. So in this case, Ethereum does. But the part about that's important is actually amount of data you need to push, right? Like at the end, if you do want a full kind of, you know, full data available on the layer one that provides security, you need to be able to push megabytes and megabytes of data, which Ethereum at this point is not able to. And so it will.
00:22:45.554 - 00:22:46.494, Speaker B: It'S coming.
00:22:47.554 - 00:23:54.404, Speaker C: And so right now, at least, building layer one is really about actually data availability and fast finality. And so from this perspective, the kind of speed and performance that you can achieve to users. And to be clear, we're getting new users into the space who don't understand why they need to wait for minutes or even tens of seconds if you really bump up the tip on Ethereum, they actually just want to use apps. Our focus always been, how do we make this thing so simple that we can actually bring the billion users right now, the existing experience when you try to use, it's not something for people who are new to space, right? It's not for the people who are non technical. Like we have people, like we have factory workers using some apps on NIR, we have people who are like non educated, non technical, for whom Facebook was Internet. They're using the apps right now and that's like, because they feel exactly the same. And at least right now, you cannot achieve that.
00:23:54.404 - 00:24:28.254, Speaker C: And with choices that at least east one x is making, you still cannot achieve that, right? Finality is still long. I mean, they are working on faster finality on beacon chain, but that's not what it is right now. And so if there was a way to merge all those things into one joint experience, sure. But I think the choices are pretty different that people are making. And choices like this was. Vitalik posted this long thread of his different things. But the thing I did not see is choice between actually making better user experience.
00:24:28.254 - 00:24:59.210, Speaker C: That's not the choices that are being made right now when they're thinking of how to design Ethereum. And from my perspective, that is the main choice. How do we make better user experience, how to make better developer experience, bring the users. And then ideally we should solve the complexity behind the scenes. We should not push it on the user. Sure, we eventually get there, everything will be built, we'll live in magical land of everything interconnected and moving in microseconds. But right now we're not.
00:24:59.210 - 00:25:03.130, Speaker C: And so, like, what are we delivering now? How are we actually getting that in front of users?
00:25:03.162 - 00:25:05.178, Speaker D: Right, yeah, just to Luigi.
00:25:05.306 - 00:25:13.674, Speaker B: Sorry, Ben, I do strongly agree that instant UX is super, super important. If you go on optimism, you will get those instant confirmations. They're so good. I agree.
00:25:13.834 - 00:25:15.134, Speaker F: And arbitrum as well.
00:25:16.914 - 00:25:51.722, Speaker D: Just to Luigi's and Ilya's. Points about the fast fidelity. You can certainly have that sort of nice finality with rollups by replicating the model that we are all using today, which are basically credit cards or cards in general. So you can have local finality on rollups. I don't want to go too technical, I guess it's not the right forum, but you can have some sort of decentralized operators and have local finality, which is nearly instant. And then you can have in the same manner, like with credit cards, you can have this final strong finality on Ethereum at a later point using fraud proofs or ZK proofs.
00:25:51.778 - 00:25:56.402, Speaker C: But what happens when Ethereum decides to censor your batch?
00:25:56.498 - 00:26:02.866, Speaker D: Yes, but that's the point of the whole point of Ethereum is that it's impossible to censor anyone. That's why we have Ethereum.
00:26:03.010 - 00:26:09.194, Speaker C: Google can roll back pretty deep, like with all the GPU's they have the current POW. I mean it will change with PoS.
00:26:09.274 - 00:26:20.130, Speaker D: Yeah, but Ethereum is this decentralized network that cannot be affected and it's completely unopinionated and just processes. Anyone, any transaction that submits enough, yes, it will process, but that's not true.
00:26:20.162 - 00:26:25.722, Speaker C: I can roll back a bunch of transactions, you know, and for a period of time make sure that nothing happens if I have enough GPU's.
00:26:25.858 - 00:26:28.370, Speaker E: So here's kind of like, okay, we're.
00:26:28.442 - 00:26:31.850, Speaker D: Going now into some debate, then you can say anything can be rolled back.
00:26:31.962 - 00:26:37.610, Speaker C: Essentially, but if there's enough money, everything is rolled back. That's the whole assumption.
00:26:37.722 - 00:26:43.856, Speaker D: This whole economy, I mean this is also practically. Practically, all right.
00:26:43.920 - 00:26:45.096, Speaker E: I mean, you knew this was happening.
00:26:45.160 - 00:26:46.884, Speaker A: I know this is fiery.
00:26:47.664 - 00:26:48.524, Speaker B: All right.
00:26:52.144 - 00:26:53.524, Speaker A: One at a time, mihilo.
00:26:54.024 - 00:27:13.104, Speaker D: Yeah, so as I was saying. So it's definitely possible to build something with five finality using roll ups. And yeah, regarding GPU's, we can discuss that maybe some other time, but practically it's not really possible. That's the whole point. That's what you need to remember.
00:27:14.644 - 00:27:47.240, Speaker E: I think also the point is that if there is enough value to extract, there could be a scenario whereby the proof, whatever, gets rejected, something happens and you need to reorder transactions if that happens. And let's say you're trying to settle stocks and you want to reorder the transactions post facto, whatever, that's a catastrophe. Like you need to reorder the market. That's just not realistic. So we're not going to do this with finance. And that's like the issue for me. Other applications, other use cases 100%.
00:27:47.240 - 00:28:25.802, Speaker E: I think it's a great idea. But for finance in particular, I think it's, you know, I think it's very, very problematic from that standpoint. Also, you know, you also have a scenario like l two is kind of like writing a check, you know, I mean, if we're going to make it super simplistic versus paying somebody cash and checks can bounce, things can happen post facto. So I just think that these are great designs and they're scaling for different use cases. And that's wonderful. But it is important to also understand some of the innovations that blockchain has brought and make sure that we keep some of those nice properties.
00:28:25.978 - 00:29:05.724, Speaker D: Yeah. And just one interesting thing that Ilya mentioned also is that we are indeed the kind of the lines between layer one and layer two are starting to get a little bit blurry. And especially now with the most critical point in current multi chain infrastructure are definitely bridges. And this is where we see the most of the recent hacks and whatnot. So this is something that the industry is kind of focusing on. And I guess one of the most promising designs is where you actually use ZK proofs to prove the activity on corresponding chain, on this chain, on the destination chain, if you will. And again, you can argue that this is kind of blurring the lines between layer one and layer two.
00:29:05.724 - 00:29:25.908, Speaker D: So if you have alternative layer one that is communicating with Ethereum using the ZK proof based bridge, I mean, then it becomes a matter of narrative. You can call this bridge actually a layer two of Ethereum, or scaling solution of Ethereum, but basically, yeah, that's something that also interesting to kind of note.
00:29:26.076 - 00:29:30.628, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think in general, ZK is how we actually unify all those visions. Right?
00:29:30.716 - 00:29:31.412, Speaker D: Very likely.
00:29:31.508 - 00:29:53.524, Speaker C: Very much very likely, because we'll have like a proof that everything executed and you cannot roll back that already. And so then it will be, you know, data availability, it will be still finality because zero knowledge probably will take longer to actually execute. But at the end it will be kind of a singular model that scales because you can execute in parallel and then just prove your part.
00:29:53.864 - 00:29:57.124, Speaker D: I would say that's the most likely future supercharge.
00:29:57.464 - 00:29:58.408, Speaker F: I just don't.
00:29:58.496 - 00:30:00.084, Speaker C: Zero knowledge, super chat.
00:30:02.624 - 00:30:48.764, Speaker F: Those don't solve the issue of having separate finality. They're very useful and they're very powerful for a lot of things. But fundamentally, if you have separate finality, one chain can roll back and the other one won't, and then it doesn't matter that you proved something about the state at some point because the state could be changed. Now that's kind of, I think, a very critical point. And just another point that I wanted to mention from earlier is just in terms of kind of ethereum security itself, one of the things that I think the roll up teams are very excited about is the fast approaching merge, which will bring Ethereum off of proof of work entirely onto proof of stake, which is going to significantly improve kind of the finality properties of the chain and do a lot to really, really sort of ramp up the power that roll ups have.
00:30:49.744 - 00:30:53.320, Speaker A: Guys, I want to maybe bring us up here a little bit to talk about something a bit more high level.
00:30:53.432 - 00:30:55.088, Speaker D: Don't do that. Don't do that.
00:30:55.256 - 00:30:56.728, Speaker F: I was like, I'm not going to get into weeds.
00:30:56.776 - 00:30:57.296, Speaker A: Here we are.
00:30:57.360 - 00:30:58.524, Speaker F: Did we get a whiteboard?
00:31:04.584 - 00:31:32.984, Speaker A: So I'm going to ask almost an annoying question here, which is like, let's talk about timeline a little bit. We've been talking a lot like, you know, obviously these are all moving targets and everything like that, but ultimately, I think the future that we all want, however it looks, right, however many layer ones, whatever the diversity of layer twos is, we want people to be, to be able to leverage these networks, right? Like, how long do we have before companies entrepreneurs can easily start spinning up projects and aren't limited by kind of bandwidth type constraints?
00:31:34.564 - 00:31:44.272, Speaker B: So I heard earlier today that with money, you can roll back enough money, you can roll back anything. So optimism's new strategy will be to complete the protocol, then pay enough to roll back time. So it's coming tomorrow.
00:31:44.448 - 00:31:46.552, Speaker A: It's like Superman when he's flying around the world, right?
00:31:46.568 - 00:31:47.896, Speaker B: He makes you go backwards.
00:31:48.080 - 00:31:50.404, Speaker C: You cannot disprove that. You cannot do that.
00:31:51.104 - 00:32:12.036, Speaker B: Zero knowledge. I could. I mean, look, I mean, look, I think the answer from everyone's gonna be right now, come use my scaling solution of my panel. Right? But it's true. You can go on optimism right now. You get those instant transactions, you get cheap fees, and it's EVM equivalent. So it is like true one click deploy, use all the tooling, everything you love about Ethereum.
00:32:12.036 - 00:32:48.728, Speaker B: So, yeah, woo. You know, with that being said, there's a long road ahead in scaling, and it's definitely the case that the end game is coming into sight. I think this is something that I've observed in the past year or two years that is notably different from earlier iterations of scaling, where I feel like there's a very consistent framework in which I can put all the pieces of the different things I see people saying. And it turns out that all those paths are kind of leading to the same place. So shout out to Vitalik's and game post if you want to get technical. But in general, I think we have years, but I think the next step is going to be adoption. We're in a bear market now.
00:32:48.728 - 00:33:01.864, Speaker B: The next thing is telling people about this. I'm less worried about a bunch of congestion and this generation of scaling, not getting there. I'm more concerned with bringing on applications and users that actually align with the values of what we're trying to build in the first place.
00:33:03.884 - 00:33:53.426, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I totally agree. I think right now you can do a bunch of stuff and I mean, a lot of people are building, I think, across all of the ecosystems and we see probably kind of the biggest shift in kind of what, you know, web two, traditional tech of people actually coming to web three because they're realizing the values, they're realizing that there's stuff actually works. And there's this promise here. Even with events of last week, there's still lots of interest for people to actually build. And that is the most amazing part. Starting in 2018 when market was going down, everything was crashing, people are kind of exiting and actually going through that building, through that scene right now. Nothing like that, right? Like people actually continue building.
00:33:53.426 - 00:34:40.048, Speaker C: Nothing changed. So I think from that perspective, we're there, there's obviously like all of us have huge technical roadmaps that we continue building on. Right? I mean for, in many ways, like for near, right. It's how do we dynamically resize the network, right? On a basis you can think like near block size is actually like adjustable and so we can actually keep growing the block size as more usage. And so right now that requires like a well governance vote and more validators coming in at the basis of that. And so how do we move to fully dynamic, kind of out of provisioning type of thing? So like dynamic resharding we call. And so when that is launched, that allows to actually like completely scale with more applications launching into the network.
00:34:40.048 - 00:35:12.824, Speaker C: At the same time, we already have octopus which allows to launch parachains kind of style app chains on near. And so you're still able to, and already like eight chains already launched that way to scale out that way and still have similar kind of same wallet experience across them. So like you already can scale, there's private shards launching which allow you to run kind of enterprise or like private use cases as well. So there's a lot of stuff launching more infrastructure. All of it is, you know, building out kind of maturing through usage. So please build.
00:35:13.964 - 00:36:03.654, Speaker D: Yeah, I obviously agree. As I said in the beginning, these are obviously the early days, the early phase of the industry, and we have, as Ilya said, huge technical roadmap ahead of us. Of course we can offer solutions today, which are basically our supernets, our dedicated blockchain network that we offer to our edge framework, and they are available today. And there's more than 14 networks, 40 networks currently being built, some of them already in production using that framework. And they can support like with this dedicated network you can easily, I guess, accommodate up to maybe 50 million user base or something like that. So we have solutions today, but are these solutions ideal? Of course not. Do they have the level of security, level of scalability, robustness that we want them to have? Absolutely not, and we will need years to get there.
00:36:03.654 - 00:36:45.114, Speaker D: And basically this, again, it's important to remember, for us at Polygon, it was always important to offer something to users, to offer something today, and then in parallel, actively work on pushing the frontier of innovation, developing more secure, more robust, more scalable solutions. And that's exactly what we're doing. And like, we're still basically, even in the phase of active experimentation, like on the ZK front, we have four different projects that we are experimenting with, and we still expect to see some convergence, and that's somewhere ahead, maybe one year from now or so. So definitely early phase. We definitely have solutions even today, but that's not where we want to be as an industry and as a project.
00:36:46.254 - 00:37:31.700, Speaker E: Yeah, I really agree with Michalo. I mean, you know, we have solutions today to actually be able to scale to large amounts of transactions without much friction for users via subnets. So we have two subnets that are in production, both of them doing about, I would say, 800 to 900,000 transactions per day, maybe like 100th of a penny in terms of a transaction cost fee. Those are obviously not ideal, like you mentioned, in terms of the decentralized set of validators that you want. However, it is nice to have this validator set that is parameterizable, whatever the hell the word is. So I think that's quite nice. But at the end of the day, it's also nice that the system self scales itself.
00:37:31.700 - 00:37:45.380, Speaker E: So we had an application on the C chain that moved over to a subnet. When that happened, we increased the transactions per second that the network was actually handling, while lowering fees on both the subnet and the main chain. That's quite nice scaling.
00:37:45.412 - 00:37:46.348, Speaker B: So that's possible.
00:37:46.516 - 00:38:38.294, Speaker E: My bigger question is, do we actually have the demand that we want to actually, does a space have enough demand? I think we can increase block space right now, today in a reasonable way. Are there enough use cases? DeFi is two years old. I think we're learning a lot about it, given the recent events and what's going on in the industry. Do we have enough use cases? Is there enough demand for block space for transactions? And I think it's coming upon all of us to actually figure out what are reasonable use cases for blockchains that scale that users want to use and then fix the UX over time. So I think we could scale today. I think it'll get better over time, but we also need to figure out the adoption part a little bit faster.
00:38:40.074 - 00:39:11.640, Speaker F: Yeah, I think I'll just, I mean, I think both with Mirror Ben's answer, essentially of the fact that I think on Ethereum there's great solutions live today. Arbitrum has been live for quite a while now. Optimism's live for quite a while now. You can use tons of stuff already. I think the thing I will add on in my answer would be that I think over the next year there's going to be a lot of progress. Both. I know we're working on our nitro release right now, which is going to both cut prices, increase capacity, and do a lot of great things.
00:39:11.640 - 00:39:34.004, Speaker F: I know that you guys are also working on bedrock, which has a lot of improvements as well. We're also extremely excited about the ethereum scaling roadmap, which should be able to cut data posting costs by a lot, which should make roll up transactions much, much cheaper. I think that kind of the systems that are there today are great, but I think that they're nothing compared to what things are going to look like hopefully in the next year.
00:39:35.644 - 00:39:40.844, Speaker A: All right, guys, unfortunately, that's all the time we have. Fascinating conversation, guys, everyone give them a big round of applause.
