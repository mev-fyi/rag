00:00:00.320 - 00:00:34.484, Speaker A: So, right now, you think that the wallets own the user experience, but actually, if you go a level even above, which is the browsers themselves, not the browser extensions, but the browsers themselves, they can own the browser extensions. They can own the metamasks of the world. So if they try to build their own wallet and within their browsers, and if their browsers are really successful, they're gonna own all the power. They're gonna become the de facto aggregator of experiences.
00:00:35.584 - 00:00:49.344, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We've got Santi co hosting, and we have a repeat guest, or maybe for the third time. I forget if it's the second or the third time, but we've got chow from alliance. Dao. Back in action. Chow. Welcome to the show, man.
00:00:49.464 - 00:00:50.604, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:00:51.104 - 00:00:53.982, Speaker B: Of course, of course. Really excited about it. New year going well?
00:00:54.128 - 00:01:02.054, Speaker A: Very well. Had a great. Took a break. First break for. Since, like, a year or so. So it was very refreshing.
00:01:02.794 - 00:01:04.602, Speaker B: What does that. What does the break look like to you?
00:01:04.658 - 00:01:22.374, Speaker A: Well, usually I go overseas with my wife on a vacation, but this year was the second year I became a father, so I couldn't go out. So I stayed home, did some creative art, trained my left brain for, like, very rarely. So it was. Was a lot of fun.
00:01:23.074 - 00:01:25.374, Speaker B: Baby. Babies are definitely good for the left brain.
00:01:28.434 - 00:01:29.122, Speaker A: That's a.
00:01:29.178 - 00:01:35.146, Speaker B: That's awesome. And I see you've got a new video camera and mic, too. Can be a big year for the podcast for you, I expect.
00:01:35.250 - 00:01:37.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Same. Same setup as Joe Rogan.
00:01:38.834 - 00:01:50.914, Speaker B: Wow, look at you. Look at you. I've always put you in the same. Same bucket as Joe Rogan Chow. That's the first person that comes to awesome. Well, I'm super excited about this. About this conversation.
00:01:50.914 - 00:02:30.934, Speaker B: People who have listened to Empire for the last couple of weeks have heard Santi and I talking about thoughts on the past year, thoughts for the next year. And one thing that I've been bringing up a lot is this fat wallet thesis, the wallet wars, kind of on this idea that every couple of years, there's just a battle and there's a war for the users. In 2017, we had exchanges. 2021, we had the l one s. And I think that the next proverbial war that we see in crypto is around the wallets. And I think you were one of the first people to put this idea in my head, and you're one of the only other people who I've seen talking about what I feel like is an overlooked place in crypto, which is wallet. So I'd love to just hear you.
00:02:30.934 - 00:02:39.102, Speaker B: Maybe if we could start high level and would love to hear your thesis for why you think that this kind of fat, we'll call it the fat wallet thesis is impending.
00:02:39.238 - 00:03:24.866, Speaker A: Yeah. Where I had this insight, it was actually a while ago. It was pretty. Probably a year or two ago, sometime after defi summer, I realized that metamask implemented a swap function within the browser extension itself. And since then I found myself start using that swap function natively within metamask without having to go to uniswap or any other emms. The sacrifice I had to make was paying 1% or something like that, something ridiculous to metamask. But whatever, it doesn't matter because crypto is a 150 volume asset class.
00:03:24.866 - 00:04:10.454, Speaker A: Paying 1% off of that doesn't really affect the user. So over time, I realized, holy shit, wallets are really, really powerful. Especially by wallets, I mean specifically the consumer facing wallets, whether it's browser extensions or mobile apps, because they own the end user relationship. And that's basically the crypto version of the aggregation theory. If you own the end user relationship, you can build anything into your browser extension or mobile app. The case with the metamask was that they built swap function, but we're seeing other wallets doing something similar. So that's where this thesis came about.
00:04:11.794 - 00:04:35.666, Speaker B: Before we talk into value accrual for wallets and what these wallet wars would look like, why don't you actually go back in time? So I've used metamask for years. I also remember using myether wallet back in the day. I think that was Tay's thing. Taylor Monahan before. I think she's now at Metamask, but would love to just hear the history of wallets if you feel set up to talk about that. And then, and then that'll take us into the future.
00:04:35.730 - 00:04:39.978, Speaker A: I mean, I can go as bad guys to like Mount Gox, which is go.
00:04:40.026 - 00:04:41.818, Speaker B: Let's go. Yeah, let's go there. That sounds great.
00:04:41.906 - 00:05:40.016, Speaker A: The very first wallet I use was Mount Gox, for better or worse, was decentralized. I mean, if you want to call it even a wallet. But this was the first place where I store my bitcoin, which a part, a small part of my bitcoin, which eventually went to nothing. So Mount Goss still owes me a bunch of. A bunch of BTC, by the way, that liquidation process has taken like almost a decade now, but anyway, but the second wallet, as soon as I bought Mount Gox or bought BTC from Mount Gox, and transferred most of it into paper wallet, BTC paper wallet. So the way it works is you open a website and you move your mouse in as random as possible way to generate a private key, and you would then disconnect your computer from the Internet and then print the private key out. And that's how you store the BTC.
00:05:40.016 - 00:07:01.208, Speaker A: Back in the day, that's what I did. That was the paper wallet. And then 2014, Ethereum came around 2016, I think that was when Myether Wallet might have been 2017, but 2016, I started using some Ethereum based wallets. And the thing that was fundamentally different from bitcoin was that with Ethereum, you can now start accessing some apps, so you can no longer use a paper wallet to access decentralized applications. So you either have to use later on Metamask with a hard wallet behind, or you use Myether wallet, which back in the day had some built in functions within the website. So within the website, myetherwallet website, there was a few dapps that were built in so you could access that. But Metamask was the thing that was really the game changer, because with Myether Wallet, you can access any app you want, because everything had to be predefined, built in within the website.
00:07:01.208 - 00:07:31.114, Speaker A: With Metamask, the moment you install a browser extension, you can access any decentralized application as you want. So Metamask was really the. The game changer for me. In 2017, 2018, when there was new decentralized applications like Makerdao. Makerdao was the first dapp that I really tried and used using metamask with a hardware wallet behind. And that has been pretty much my own user experience since then.
00:07:31.654 - 00:07:38.074, Speaker B: Metamask has really owned the wallet experience for the user over the last several years. What's wrong with metamask today?
00:07:40.254 - 00:07:42.734, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I can talk about.
00:07:42.774 - 00:07:47.190, Speaker B: Besides that half. Aside from. Aside from the fact that half my transactions fail these days, I feel like.
00:07:47.222 - 00:08:43.034, Speaker A: But that's precisely my number one pain point, which is the transactions failing all the time, especially post 1559, for whatever reason, I just started seeing, experiencing a bunch of failed transactions. Um, but in general, um, there's a couple problems outside of that, maybe for other users. One I noticed is that for new users who are, you know, start to dabble, dabble into the decentralized, the real decentralized world. Um, they need protection. They need, like, whenever they sign a transaction, they. They need some kind of warning to prevent them from falling into, like, phishing attacks or outright scams like smart contracts that are rug pulls and stuff like that. So I think a lot of wallets are thinking about that today.
00:08:43.034 - 00:09:05.724, Speaker A: And there's a lot of startups building smart contract scam detection products for wallets to be integrated within wallets. But that's work in progress. That's one of the biggest things that I think is missing today. And the other thing is just mobile experience. There just needs to be a really good mobile wallet.
00:09:06.144 - 00:09:26.846, Speaker B: Yeah. What's your vision here of where this goes? Is this a super app? A wallet will be a super app. And then after that, I want to talk about how we actually get there and the strategies and who's competing with Metamask. But maybe take us to your end state here. Is this a super app that looks like what we have in Latin America and Asia? What is this? What are we building here?
00:09:26.910 - 00:10:25.374, Speaker A: The trend I'm seeing right now is very much going into the super app vision, which is similar to WeChat. For example, you have one app where you can talk to people, you can send transactions, you can use a bunch of other apps within the super app, such as using Uber, finding hotels and stuff like that. Again, this goes back to my original observation with Metamask, uh, which integrated, which built the swap function within the browser extension itself. And we're seeing other wallets doing the same thing. For example, with Phantom doing something similar on, on Solana, they all try to add these commonly used, frequently used functions within the app itself. So, so they start with trading, which is the most obvious use case, but then later they might add, like landing or some popular games or whatever. So this is the trend I'm seeing right now, and I suspect that will be the envision.
00:10:25.834 - 00:10:58.414, Speaker B: Hmm. It's interesting. Like crypto side, I feel like this is something that us companies are now using as a marketing tactic is like the super app, right, where you start with like a single wedge product that is an order of magnitude better than alternatives at the time. Whether it's like cash app for p two, p payments, or like PayPal, like online payments. This was like more like web one. Like Robin Hood commission free trading, Coinbase, like user friendly crypto. You start with this product that this like orders of magnitude better, and then you're like, oh, wait, where do I go next? And then you're like, wait a minute.
00:10:58.414 - 00:11:25.356, Speaker B: Like, Wechat is the super app that sounds like a sexy thing that'll help me raise money. And, like, I started seeing it on all the financial apps, like revolut. I remember the day they changed their homepage to, like, we're building a super app. Or like, the PayPal CEO came out and he's like, our new PayPal mission is like, we're building a super app. It does feel like kind of this overhyped term to me. So I'm curious why you think that crypto can succeed there when all the fintech apps have not been able to succeed there.
00:11:25.380 - 00:12:02.148, Speaker A: By the way, we said just there is spot on. The other day I was using TikTok. I use TikTok a lot. And I saw Elon talking about turning Twitter into a super app and making the exact analogy to WeChat. So certainly a very overhyped terminology. I don't think crypto will be that different from a fintech app, meaning the super app that will succeed is the one that has the most distribution. Right now.
00:12:02.148 - 00:12:47.798, Speaker A: That is Metamask. Metamask has somewhere between ten and 20 million active users. I don't think anyone, anyone else comes even close to that. And the reason why Metamask is different from all the other apps is because if you think about the stack, you have the browser extension, which is the ultimate end user facing layer of the stack. Underneath, you have a bunch of apps like Uniswap, Aave, or whatever games, whatever app you want to access as a user, you have to go through metamask. So Metamask is the one that you have to interface with all the time. So that's why Metamask is on top of these apps, and then below the apps, you have the layer one protocols, et cetera.
00:12:47.798 - 00:13:08.434, Speaker A: So what makes metamask and wallets, or in user facing wallets different is that they are the ultimate aggregator of user experience. I think that's what makes the wallets different from what jason mentioned earlier about Robinhood and all these other mobile applications.
00:13:09.974 - 00:13:46.750, Speaker C: There's a good, I think, post by Chris Dixon or somebody, folks, it says, talks about who controls the experience now. So when you're a user of some of web two apps, you're kind of beholden to their experience, their data. Now, the portability lies at the wallet. You can move and pop your. You don't need to have a password, you don't need to have a user login. For every single app you just very quickly use, Metamask can pop into whatever web3 app you want. You're obviously the DeFi alliance.
00:13:46.750 - 00:14:13.818, Speaker C: You get to see a lot of startups. Do you think that the game is kind of over here for wallets like Metamask, as you said in a league of its own? Or do you see, perhaps a game or an app like Stepn building their own wallet and just getting a ton of traction. And, like, I'm trying to think about, we've all, like, had our, like, pains with metamask, but we still use it.
00:14:13.866 - 00:14:14.494, Speaker A: Yep.
00:14:15.114 - 00:14:18.890, Speaker C: And I'm curious if you think that that changes over time.
00:14:19.082 - 00:15:07.684, Speaker A: I think it can change very quickly. So right now, Stephan has, like, despite the bear market, they still have 300,000 data active users, which is an order of magnitude smaller than metamask. But you can change at any point in time. Stepan has launched their own marketplace. So Stepan went down the supermarketplace sort of vision instead of the super wallet vision, but they also have their wallet, right? Like, the Stepn app itself is a wallet, is a Solana wallet. So Stepan can, or any consumer app similar to Stepn can do the super wallet if they wanted to. And matter of fact, we know that.
00:15:07.684 - 00:15:32.574, Speaker A: I think Uniswap Opensea, a bunch of similar blue chip decentralized applications, are launching their own wallet. So I'm not making this, like, I'm not trying to imagine or, like, this is not a hypothesis. This is actually a trend I'm seeing right now. The most used apps in the decentralized world are launching their own wallets.
00:15:36.114 - 00:16:00.220, Speaker B: Right? So I guess the last note on the super app, the super app kind of reminds me of, like, when media companies, because block works, I'm in the media space. When media companies are like, I want to build a. We're building a Bloomberg for crypto. I'm like, oh, I bet you are. That's the one of the best software companies in the history of the world. It's like, it's like, you know, it's like it's easier said than done. It's a very hard thing to replicate that.
00:16:00.220 - 00:16:30.206, Speaker B: But just on your note of everyone's going to launch their own wallet chow, like, what do you see from this year? Like, let's start getting into these wallet wars. Like, do you see? So Coinbase came out with their own wallet. I think Ledger came out, or is coming out with their own wallet. You got to assume someone like the NFT players start coming out with their own wallets too. Like, you got to assume Opensea, instead of opensea, loses money on the fees, or at least they're not. They don't lose money, but they don't capture the value on the fees. When you're swapping inside of when you're swapping inside of metamask, there.
00:16:30.206 - 00:16:36.054, Speaker B: Like, that's value that they could capture so you got to assume who else launches wallets, right?
00:16:36.214 - 00:16:39.598, Speaker A: This year, I feel like everyone is thinking about it. Everyone?
00:16:39.726 - 00:16:40.798, Speaker B: Everyone. Right.
00:16:40.846 - 00:16:47.384, Speaker A: Everyone who has, like, at least a million users is thinking about it, if not already working on it.
00:16:48.804 - 00:16:58.492, Speaker B: So throw out some names like Opensea. You got to imagine rolls one out, will the defi player will, like, someone, like a uniswap, roll out their own wallet?
00:16:58.548 - 00:16:59.664, Speaker A: I think they're doing it.
00:17:00.124 - 00:17:21.028, Speaker B: They are, right. And they're building an app, too. Okay. Who else do you think is approaching this in different ways? Like, brave comes to mind? Right? I've actually heard really good. I don't use the brave browser or the brave wallet, but a lot of people at blockworks do, and they love it. Maybe. Can you share? So Metamask took this approach of build the wallet, first build this chrome extension.
00:17:21.028 - 00:17:31.404, Speaker B: Brave has taken a different approach, which is own the browser. But I think really what they're trying to do is also a super app there. So can you explain Brave's approach to this?
00:17:31.444 - 00:18:23.524, Speaker A: Yeah. So again, going back to the layers of the stack, Brave is actually part of that picture as well, because at the top you have wallets, then you have apps, you have layer ones. So right now, you think that the wallets own the user experience. But actually, if you go a level even above, which is the browsers themselves, not the browser extensions, but the browsers themselves, they can own the browser extensions, they can own the metamasks of the world. So if they try to build their own wallet within their browsers, and if their browsers are really successful, they're going to own all the power. They're going to become the de facto aggregator of experiences. It's all about bargaining power across the several layers.
00:18:23.524 - 00:18:47.898, Speaker A: Apple, for example, has a lot of power against all the NFT apps that are in the App Store. They force them to pay 30% to Apple. Apple has a lot of power. If Apple wanted to launch a wallet, it's game over. Right? But I don't think they will. But the player that sort of sits between the App Store, between Apple and the wallets is the browsers, which is brave.
00:18:47.946 - 00:19:12.706, Speaker C: For example, what do you think about the approach that Solana is taking with their phone to talk about Apple? And we had them on talking about, hey, it's not only they're building a mobile stack that could integrate with Ethereum and other chains. Do you see that as a credible kind of contender? Could it blow past metamask and the scale that they have today?
00:19:12.810 - 00:19:34.662, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, on paper, the thesis behind the Solana phone is amazing. It has two parts. One is fighting against the centralization power of App Store, and the other one is allowing the users to natively store private keys within the phone.
00:19:34.798 - 00:19:35.118, Speaker B: Right?
00:19:35.166 - 00:19:48.718, Speaker A: So both reasons are very compelling. Now, whether or not they're going to become a real threat to Apple all boils down to execution, and I have no visibility into how much time they're actually spending on this stuff.
00:19:48.766 - 00:20:32.134, Speaker B: So it does feel like, so maybe let's extend out the wallets. I keep hearing you say this term, which is like, wallets are the point of distribution. Like, whoever has the distribution wins. Whoever has the relationship with the user wins. If you extend that out, you could see a world where instead of building new products, previously, you used to people who built new software products, maybe built them for the desktop or something like that. Then what happened is the iPhone came out and you launched directly into hundreds of thousands and then millions of users by just launching on the App Store. Do you think that we'll see a world, either this year or next year, where you start to see a lot of startups that are just building for the wallet and they launch inside of metamask?
00:20:32.834 - 00:21:24.480, Speaker A: I think it's very hard to say, but my hunch is it's very hard if you start by building a wallet, because you're not going to be very differentiated from metamask or other existing incumbent wallets. If you want to win against Metamask, you have to be ten x better. But how are you going to become ten x better? I've spoken with a number of wallet projects that are building end user facing wallets. I just haven't come across anything that makes me think, okay, this is really, really compelling. Phantom was the only compelling one that I've come across over the past year because it coincided with the rise of Solana. It makes sense to me, but I haven't seen anything else. So point being, if you start by building a wallet, I think it's going to be very hard to compete with incumbents.
00:21:24.480 - 00:21:58.668, Speaker A: But if you start by building something that can be immediately useful, it can be any application, it could be a game, it could be, I don't know, a social network or whatever. Think out loud, whatever that you're building is immediately useful, that will create the distribution that you need to eventually become a wallet. And that's exactly what I mentioned earlier about Uniswap and Opensea. They didn't start as wallets by building something different and immediately useful, then eventually turning into a wallet, I think.
00:21:58.756 - 00:22:34.302, Speaker B: Okay, so that makes sense to me. I think maybe more. Where I was going, though, with going with there was when you have distribution and you have the relationship with the user, over the last couple of years, we've seen that the natural extension of that is to turn, go from a product to a platform. So, like, Salesforce and Slack are probably good examples of this. Slack owns the relationship with like millions of employees all around the world. What they did is they then turned that into, they opened up the API, they turned that into just went from a SaaS product into a platform. Now there are companies that they don't build for non slack.
00:22:34.302 - 00:22:47.194, Speaker B: They're like, we're building on top of the Slack platform. Like troops. AI is a good example. Troops help sales teams get more powerful. They just got acquired. They got acquired for like 50 to 100 million, I think. And that was like a slack native application.
00:22:47.194 - 00:22:59.532, Speaker B: Could we see tools and companies that are like, maybe Metamask? Could we see Metamask open up their dev kits and like build much more extensive dev kits, and then companies just go in and build there.
00:22:59.588 - 00:23:27.556, Speaker A: They recently did. I can't remember, I think it's called Metamask Snippet or I can't remember the name, but they open up their SDK and I'm already seeing a couple of projects building for Metamask. Sorry if the name is, sorry if I can't remember the name, but there's projects building. For example, what I mentioned earlier about the scam detection within the manamask.
00:23:27.580 - 00:23:28.124, Speaker B: Oh, snaps.
00:23:28.204 - 00:23:28.556, Speaker A: Snaps.
00:23:28.620 - 00:23:35.372, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. Oh, this is cool. I didn't even see this. Oh, bring your features and APIs to metamask with snaps. This is really cool.
00:23:35.508 - 00:23:45.894, Speaker A: They did this a couple months ago, I believe, maybe earlier, but basically it allows third party developers to build special functionalities features within the browser extension itself.
00:23:46.314 - 00:24:05.594, Speaker B: Hmm. Who do you think is able to compete with Metamask here? Like, do you think, do you like the brave approach? Do you like the. Someone we haven't brought up is Argent as well? Like, do you like the argent approach? Do you like Phantom's approach? Like, I guess, do you like any of those folks? Or do you think, like, what? Yeah, maybe I'll start there with that question.
00:24:05.754 - 00:24:58.442, Speaker A: I don't have a strong opinion on this. I personally find metamask really dominant because that just comes from my personal experience, which Santiago mentioned earlier. Despite all the flaws of metamask, we all still continue to use it. The switching cost is way too high. The switching cost, basically you as a user become familiar with the user experience and you trust the brand. That's pretty much it, but it's still very high switching cost. Where I think might be an opportunity for other wallets to disrupt metamask is account abstraction, which by the way, the things that disrupt the incumbent is always new technologies that enable new opportunities, and account abstraction might be one of those.
00:24:58.442 - 00:25:04.334, Speaker A: So it levels the playing field for everyone by allowing people to build.
00:25:06.634 - 00:25:06.898, Speaker B: To.
00:25:06.906 - 00:25:25.494, Speaker A: Let the wallets to interact with smart contracts natively and do things like bundle transactions, letting the smart contract handle things for the user instead of letting the user sign every single transaction, stuff like that. It's a possibility, but it's not a very strong opinion for me.
00:25:26.594 - 00:26:00.862, Speaker B: It's interesting you say that it does feel like crypto is this unique thing where whenever there's a big new update, like a new implementation on Ethereum or something, you kind of hit reset on the competitive landscape, which gives new up and comers a chance at the incumbents. Can you actually just explain account abstraction for a second? Because I also think maybe a sub prediction here would be that the term smart contract wallets will end up being a major buzzword this year. So can you just give an overview of account account abstraction?
00:26:00.998 - 00:26:09.314, Speaker A: I don't have a ton of expertise or deep understanding into it. Also, it's something, it's a term I keep hearing.
00:26:10.894 - 00:26:32.326, Speaker B: My understanding is like, it just makes. There are a couple things it does, which is like, let's say you're lp into uniswap. Like when you do that, there's probably one, two, three, there's like four clicks. You have to do four transactions. You have to approve. And one thing this would do is like something like pre approvals or something like that, where that gets bundled into one transaction. That's one example.
00:26:32.326 - 00:26:32.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:33.142 - 00:27:02.086, Speaker A: Basically on Ethereum, there's two types of account. There is the eos and there's the smart contract accounts. Before account abstraction, only the eos are accounts. You and I, as retail individual users, control our private keys or whatever, only the user can sign transactions. But with account abstraction, the smart contracts can do that as well. And by the way, this is a very imprecise definition. I'm just describing that at the very high level.
00:27:02.086 - 00:27:28.564, Speaker A: And as a result of that, the wallet itself can become a set of smart contracts that sign transactions on behalf of the user, so that the user doesn't have to sign every single transaction, which you mentioned earlier with Uniswap or whatever, it takes four transactions to sign. So that will greatly improve the user experience for wallet users.
00:27:29.504 - 00:28:05.854, Speaker B: If I were building a wallet today, which I have blockworks is not building a wallet. But if we were building a wallet, or if I was building a wallet, I think probably the two ways to compete would actually be verticalization and geography. And what I mean by that is, it's interesting when you travel to other countries, because just like, Ui UX decisions, like, whenever I go to a different country, I'm like, oh, this is. This is a horrible design. Like, this is, this is awful, but it's awful to me. The American who lives in New York and grew up in San Francisco, to the person in. I spent six months in Hungary.
00:28:05.854 - 00:28:29.350, Speaker B: Like, the UI UX decisions they make in Hungary are very different. And actually, I heard you. You had a thesis on this, which was, like, in America, we grew up with abundance, so therefore, we like design experiences that are very clean. And, like, we. I was gonna say modern, but that's our version of modern. Like, very clean and minimalist, whereas a version of, like, in Hungary, they didn't grow up with as much abundance. So maybe they like things that are a little more.
00:28:29.350 - 00:28:34.334, Speaker B: What. Yeah, to me, feels like. Like, cluttered. Yeah, but I think, like, yeah, go ahead.
00:28:34.374 - 00:28:59.062, Speaker A: It ties back to the earlier discussion about superab. Like, this is precise. This is one of the best arguments against the super app thesis, which is that the Wechat user experience is very much tailored for chinese people. The Wechat experience is very cluttered. Extremely cluttered. You have a bunch of things within the same app. Are you going to see the same thing in America? Maybe not.
00:28:59.062 - 00:29:06.166, Speaker A: Because the two user segments are different. They have different user preferences, even WhatsApp.
00:29:06.270 - 00:29:16.348, Speaker B: For me, I don't like the WhatsApp Ui Ux, but, like, the Americans are not the core base of WhatsApp, but just, like, on this. Go ahead, Satya.
00:29:16.396 - 00:30:11.386, Speaker C: Well, I'm just curious, like, thinking about. So you're an investor and you know your reference aggregation theory, and the decision always comes down to, like, where's. I feel like over the last year, people have had very over modernization of where value accrual happens in crypto is a very hotly debated topic. And I'm curious if you, like, when you think about wallets and the wallet game, like metamask, there's this dude, analytic dashboard, for instance. I think they did this sort of strategy that perhaps is not easily replicable because they were free for such a long time. It's kind of subsidized by consensus, and then they kind of layered in this ability to swap, and people are like, oh, this is great new product. They already have the distribution base, and people probably are not realizing that they're getting ripped off in the fees.
00:30:11.386 - 00:30:40.496, Speaker C: And Coinbase had this similar kind of moat. I guess that it was just the only place where you could trade and develop a really good reputation in the US. And they charge you a lot, at least retail. I guess what I'm trying to get at in this question is. Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to get at is my understanding is metamask routes the trade to some of these protocols. A lot of it just goes to Uniswap. Some of it uses the Xerox API.
00:30:40.496 - 00:31:02.884, Speaker C: These other apps are also benefiting. So I guess the very precise question is, would you rather invest in a new wallet? Would you rather kind of, like, take a long view on the protocol, the DeFi protocol itself, that is going to benefit from all other wallets that are going to route. Like Argent will route to Kerr will route to Uniswap. This more of an open ended question on modernization value accrual.
00:31:07.384 - 00:31:38.344, Speaker A: I don't really place a lot of emphasis on whether the value will accrue to wallets or within the app itself. I think it's just something that's so hard to predict, that's outside of our control. Like, this is something where I'm even my best prediction would be maybe 50%, be the 50%. So there's no way for me to predict where the value accrues. So it's not really a factor that I look into.
00:31:39.404 - 00:32:13.944, Speaker B: Hmm, maybe. Let me how will value accrue, though? Like, so Mev, we've had a lot of conversations on MeV on the podcast recently, and so, like, how do you think, like, maybe when you look at wallets, like, how will wallets think about Mev? Like, could they. Here's some examples. They could take Mev and share that with users as, like, an incentive to use the wallet, or maybe to go, like, fe. Like Felix, you could have a Felix wallet if you offset the cost with Mev that the wallet accrues. Like, how do you think about maybe not who accrues the most value, but how do you accrue value in a wallet?
00:32:15.284 - 00:33:08.084, Speaker A: So. Exactly. Mev makes the whole discussion even more complex, and I don't have a strong opinion. Like, if you look at the whole supply chain of Mev, you start with wallets, and then you have the searchers, and then the builders, and then finally the validators. So a couple of years ago, before and around the time flashbots came about, most of the action happens towards the end of that chain around the builders and the validators. But in more recent months, we're seeing projects and wallets wanting to move the MEV towards the wallet and more towards the end user. The wallets want the end user to capture some of the MeV.
00:33:08.084 - 00:33:29.894, Speaker A: And so it feels like moving target. It feels like something that evolves quite a bit over time. And I don't really understand what forces are driving these changes yet. So I can't make a long term prediction. But I am seeing a trend where MeV is moving towards the wallet.
00:33:31.034 - 00:33:54.852, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so as well. I think. Yeah, I agree. There's a business model that crypto people do not like that I think is going to come to wallets as well, which is ads. I think we'll see a model where something that people don't like use it like doing is paying fees, especially when gas prices are really high. Right. And I think you could see a world where, like in the next bull market, two things happen.
00:33:54.852 - 00:34:20.255, Speaker B: Gas fees, like fees, transaction fees go like skyrocket. But also companies are flush with cash and racing to acquire users. So let's say I'm Coinbase. I'm like, I need to, I've got a billion bucks to go spend on users. I'm going to pay like, almost overpay pay a boatload of money to go advertise inside of the metamask wallet. And metamask can use that ad revenue to offset fees, which then helps them get more users. It's kind of a win win across the board.
00:34:20.319 - 00:35:09.232, Speaker A: There was a company in our last cohort who built exactly this crypto native ad network. And the reason why it's cryptonative is because, mainly two reasons. One is this ad network will look at the on chain activities of the users in order to push them relevant information. So this is something that was not possible before crypto. And the other thing that's crypto native is that the user themselves can get paid for watching the ads. So this is something that's similar to the original vision of brave, right? But because the user has a native wallet, they can get paid for watching the ads natively and quickly. And by the way, the company is called Slice plug.
00:35:09.328 - 00:35:17.324, Speaker B: We love the plug. Speaking of incentives, chow, what do you think about tokens while it's launching tokens?
00:35:18.784 - 00:35:20.364, Speaker A: Why should they launch tokens?
00:35:21.184 - 00:35:25.232, Speaker B: Because they want to incentivize people to come to use their product.
00:35:25.408 - 00:35:26.244, Speaker A: Okay.
00:35:27.984 - 00:35:34.724, Speaker B: By the way, I'm not saying they should. I just have a feeling that we're going to see a bunch of wallets launch tokens or airdrop whatever you want to call it.
00:35:35.264 - 00:35:42.244, Speaker C: What point? Coinbase, like, teased with this and then never did. Sorry, not Coinbase. Metamask.
00:35:43.464 - 00:35:45.208, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that, too.
00:35:45.256 - 00:35:52.044, Speaker B: Isn't it, isn't there a phantom airdrop on the way? No.
00:35:53.784 - 00:37:02.556, Speaker A: I think most crypto startups have realized that launching tokens too early, using tokens to incentivize user growth too early, pre product market fit, is not a good idea. I have many founders who told me this recently, and by the way, I think it's a positive movement now. I think the mature wallets like Metamask, it could make sense for them to launch a token if it serves some interesting purpose other than just incentivizing users. If the token is designed in such a way that accrues value from whatever, like, from, like, let's say, the fees generated from their swap function, I guess it could make sense. But where we are today, like, this, is not really related to wallets, but more of a macro thing, which is that the regulatory scrutiny is probably at its highest in the history of crypto right now.
00:37:02.660 - 00:37:04.716, Speaker B: Doesn't seem like a smart time to be launching tokens.
00:37:04.820 - 00:37:07.064, Speaker A: I think that's right, yeah.
00:37:08.964 - 00:37:22.854, Speaker B: How do wallets monetize today? Like, how does Santa, you just telegram to me. This. This metamask revenue thing, like, metamask, does spit off a boatload of cash flow. How. What is the business model of wallets today?
00:37:22.974 - 00:37:35.230, Speaker A: I think it's the swap function. I can't think of anything else. So. Sorry. Basically, they would charge a fee from the swap function. How much money are they making?
00:37:35.262 - 00:37:47.648, Speaker C: Santi? I was trying to infer that, but, like, last year, like, volumes have come down considerably and swap sizes have come down considerably, but I think they crank like 200 million of revenue or something.
00:37:47.736 - 00:37:48.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:48.064 - 00:37:55.204, Speaker C: Like, in 2021. Like, it was. It was just like they quickly became one of the most profitable businesses in crypto.
00:37:57.624 - 00:38:11.382, Speaker B: Like, look at all their daily, daily revenue. Like, they're spitting off. They're doing 133,000. Yeah. Like 210,000 in daily revenue there. 133. 91.
00:38:11.528 - 00:38:15.954, Speaker C: You run rate that say they're doing 100k, you know, oh, here's cumulative revenue.
00:38:16.034 - 00:38:16.986, Speaker B: 350.
00:38:17.170 - 00:38:51.124, Speaker C: Yeah, they're going to do like 36 million of revenue, which, by the way, goes straight to the bottom line. Right. They have no overhead, is my understanding. It's just like a great business. The other way of seeing wallets, like Arjun, for instance. Well, that I think they monetize, I'm not sure, is kind of through this fee sharing construct, which they might have, like these kind of B. Two B deals with protocols where they might be incentivized to route a particular order.
00:38:51.124 - 00:39:31.934, Speaker C: And you see this in traditional finance too. But for the most part, I think the very simple one is they might quote you, well, depends. The swap fee can come in different ways. One is they might quote you something and they might say, look, we're going to guarantee you x price. If we then deliver a lower price, we're going to take that and pocket the difference. That's a more riskier business model than just saying we're just going to charge you whatever 1% at whatever the market price is, which I think is what Metamask is doing. They don't take any risk on the execution.
00:39:31.934 - 00:39:56.364, Speaker C: Other wallets I've seen have tried to compete by saying, hey, we're going to guarantee you best price execution and if we are able to give you a price lower than what we're quoting you, then we'll share some of that or pocket that, which is I think what, like one inch the aggregator has been doing historically.
00:39:58.784 - 00:40:23.212, Speaker B: Yeah, I just started playing around with the core wallet here. Let's see if I can find an avalanche like core wallet. And they just use pair swap. Like they just. Yep, like powered by Paris swap. So I think there's all these deals that like there's offshoots of revenue that flow back into these partnership deals. Funny enough, I'm sharing my screen still because someone just texted me this, a link to this.
00:40:23.212 - 00:40:44.688, Speaker B: This is a, this is a new wallet. I've never heard of this. It's called, it's called family, I guess. And it's just like, like they're clearly trying to compete on. Just like looking at this video, super clean user experience and mobile. Right? So I think we're just going to see so many of these this year.
00:40:44.776 - 00:40:48.728, Speaker A: I mean there have been so many of these over the past.
00:40:48.776 - 00:40:59.196, Speaker B: Reminds me of Rainbow, actually. I used Rainbow. I like Rainbow a lot. I don't know if you guys have used Rainbow mobile. Yeah, it's a, it's the best mobile, mobile wallet in my mind.
00:40:59.320 - 00:41:01.064, Speaker C: It's very good for like nfts.
00:41:01.524 - 00:41:02.304, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:04.844 - 00:42:03.924, Speaker C: Yeah, it's uh, I think uh, maybe we can like the things that are perhaps the, the biggest areas of opportunity in the wallet space. I think at your perspective is like key generation and management, um, which, look, I think the value proposition of expecting users to write down 24 words and store them securely is of a different era, you know, and Argent social recovery is really neat, I think. I remember looking at Argent's series a round which was led by paradigm, and I was using Argent at the time, was super excited. That round, I think was priced at, like, I don't know, I think, like 50 million or something. I think on a relative basis that, I mean, I don't. I think they've done super well. Like, I really like their product, but I think if you look, you would have probably.
00:42:03.924 - 00:42:49.150, Speaker C: It wouldn't have been your best investment because I don't think they've gotten, like, the traction that you would have thought, given all the really cool features that they have. It's just sort of this idea that, like, crypto is such a small user base that it's hard to, like. It's hard to, like. You're kind of competing for a very small pie. And it seems like metamask already kind of dominates the crypto nerds that are really comfortable, like, using it. And so you're just sort of waiting for that mainstream moment where a game comes, a lifestyle app comes, and millions of people and say, oh, wow, like, this metamask thing is really difficult. I'm just going to go use argent, but you're still gonna go have to acquire those users.
00:42:49.150 - 00:43:07.078, Speaker C: So goes back to the initial question of, like, maybe you're better off, like, just backing the best app. Whether it's a step in, like, or a game like that is gonna capture the user attention, because right now it's really tough. Like, I think, like, dharma, I don't. You guys remember Dharma?
00:43:07.166 - 00:43:07.834, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:08.134 - 00:43:22.184, Speaker C: Like, they had. They were acquired, like, by Opensea, right? And so they kind of shut down the wallet space. What I'm trying to get out of all this is the wallace was very difficult historically to invest as an investable kind of category.
00:43:24.284 - 00:43:32.756, Speaker B: Look. Look at this. Look at these two tweets I just found. Look at. Just tying into what you just said, santi. This is. I just typed in wallet wars crypto.
00:43:32.756 - 00:43:47.636, Speaker B: This is Spencer Noonan, 2018. The two biggest battles in crypto protocol wars, the wallet wars. This is 20. This is four years ago. Uh, four and a half years ago. Rick Burton, 2019. There are over a thousand crypto wallets on the market.
00:43:47.636 - 00:43:54.484, Speaker B: The wallet wars are going to be fascinating. So, yeah, I mean, like, Santu was just talking about, like, so far, there hasn't.
00:43:54.604 - 00:44:12.514, Speaker A: There hasn't been really a war because Metamask has won everything. But the. The apps that have acquired over a million users, like the likes of Uniswap and Opensea, the fact that they're going to launch a wallet, I think that's where the war actually starts.
00:44:13.494 - 00:44:18.670, Speaker B: The folks who already have users and capital on their platform launch launch wallets instead of just like new players who.
00:44:18.702 - 00:44:19.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so.
00:44:20.294 - 00:44:32.354, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Chad. Anything left on the wall? I do want to just get your take on before we wrap this up. Like other interesting things that you're looking at and spending time on, but any, any, like, last thoughts on the wallet wars and.
00:44:35.874 - 00:45:41.934, Speaker A: I mean, I'm just thinking about what you said earlier about the verticalization and geographic focus. I think the people who use metamask, I think they are very much crypto natives. So there might be a vertical or user segment that is somewhat underserved, which is the people who are fairly new to crypto and they want to interact with, let's say, games. Let's assume that games are crypto games are going to take off in the next couple of years. I think this user segment may not care that much about security and care more about convenience, easier user onboarding, maybe a web two like user onboarding, and I just can't see one wallet dominating both the crypto natives and those new users. So there's probably opportunities for wallets to serve that user segment as well.
00:45:42.834 - 00:45:47.514, Speaker B: Do you think that we will see web two logins for crypto wallets like log in with Gmail?
00:45:47.594 - 00:46:49.904, Speaker A: We're already seeing that there's a number of startups building this. They're not building end user facing wallet, but they're building SDKs for other wallets and games to integrate with, which offers this web two like, login experience for, especially for gamers. So how that works is, I mean, from a user's point of view, it's very simple. You sign in with your Google or Facebook credentials, but then the private key, some of the projects do this way, so they shard the private key into three shards. One of the three shards is stored in your local device, like your computer, from which you play the game. Another shard is stored by the game developer itself or the wallet itself, and a third shard is stored on a third party key management service like AWS, KMS, or something like that. And so you need two of the three shards to sign transactions.
00:46:49.904 - 00:47:14.384, Speaker A: And if the user loses their local device, you can always recover the private key using the other two shards. And by the way, this is, this. I feel like this is very different from the rainbow social recovery, which to me is, back in the day, was a really good idea, but I feel like it's not that innovative anymore.
00:47:15.164 - 00:47:46.904, Speaker B: Yeah. Huh. You're the login and Gmail thing is just making me think like it is how we scale to a billion users. It's against kind of the ethos of crypto is what I'd say, like, pros and cons. But it, man, I don't know. Like, when you think about your, like, your crypto wallet, I think right now is like your home for your assets, like crypto tokens and things like that, slowly it's also becoming your home for your nfts. Like, like, I don't think you can.
00:47:46.904 - 00:48:18.432, Speaker B: Like, the wallet is, like, really built for. I know you hold nfts in your wallet, but, like, it's really not built for nfts. It's very, like a text based instead of image based. But, like, I think the next stage is, like, wallets that are really built for nfts as well. Then it's like wallets that are built for, like, everything in crypto. But eventually, I think, like, the end state of a wallet is actually just like your home for all digital goods, like crypto or non crypto, like just your home for all digital goods, basically, which really is what you're talking about there is, like, your identity. It's like the home for your digital identity.
00:48:18.432 - 00:48:39.304, Speaker B: And having login with Google at the backbone of your entire, of your entire digital identity is almost just like a shame that that's like, the inevitable case where we're going to end up. You know what I'm saying? You think Google and Apple launch a wallet, Joe?
00:48:40.444 - 00:48:54.864, Speaker A: Um, isn't Instagram already almost becoming a wallet by allowing people to. To trade nfts?
00:48:56.564 - 00:49:29.068, Speaker B: Not only trade nfts, but shop for e commerce as well? Like, you could argue that they're a wallet. What is a wallet? The definition of a wallet, I think, is like your access point, the place where you store digital goods and where you access other applications in a digital place. And so with, like, that definition, I think that Instagram is a wallet. Yeah, I'd never thought about it like that. But you can access e commerce now. You can access messaging, messaging, e commerce. You can order things through the app.
00:49:29.068 - 00:49:32.632, Speaker B: You can buy and sell nfts. Yeah, that's an interesting thesis.
00:49:32.768 - 00:50:36.614, Speaker C: I guess it's a really good point that you both bring, because maybe that is the way that you display someone like Metamask, right? Which is you have such a compelling value proposition, a call it action for a user that says, hey, come claim you're playing a normal game. And you say, I've seen a lot of web, three games, say, look, our go to market is going to be, we're going to allow people to not even think about crypto, just play the game. Once they accrue no points, they will have the ability to go be prompted to go to a desktop version that circumvents Apple like Store and to say, go create an account. Go claim these tokens. That to me, feels like the smart approach to acquiring a customer in a very effective manner, but it starts with a super compelling product to then say, hey, I'm going to go set up, create my account, my keys and what have you hopefully abstracted away in a secure manner. And that, again, goes back to the point that I think we're talking about is it start? It begins and starts. Like, it begins and ends with like a game or an app, lifestyle app that is prompting you to.
00:50:36.614 - 00:50:48.280, Speaker C: There's an incentive to go and create a wallet because people don't wake up and think about, oh, okay, I'm gonna go create ten wallets right now. Like, it's just like, no, it doesn't happen that way.
00:50:48.362 - 00:50:57.224, Speaker A: Yeah. In other words, the path towards success that Metamask has taken is more of an exception rather than the rule.
00:50:58.724 - 00:50:59.624, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:51:02.124 - 00:51:26.724, Speaker B: Chow, where are you as we think about wrapping this conversation up? You see more startups in crypto than I think anyone in the world. More crypto startups. You and Imran and the team at alliance. Now, what are you seeing that most people are overlooking just because they aren't interacting with these early stage founders who are building things that won't be big until probably 2025 or 2026? What are we missing?
00:51:32.064 - 00:52:13.764, Speaker A: There's two really important enabling technologies right now, and enabling technologies create new opportunities. And these two enabling technologies, one is ZK, the other one is AI. I'm sure many of you have played around with GPT, but I think there's going to be really interesting things happening at the intersection of crypto and Ni and crypto and ZK. I personally understand the AI part more than the ZK part, so I can't really envision what kind of crypto applications can be enabled by ZK, but AI, I think it's going to be super interesting.
00:52:15.304 - 00:52:17.604, Speaker B: What l one s are people building on these days.
00:52:20.504 - 00:53:08.434, Speaker A: Okay, so here's an alpha that I haven't shared. So since FTX collapsed, Solana has taken a real hit in terms of developer adoption. And all the content you see out there is how the defi volume has gone down. That's very objective information. But what people are probably not seeing yet is Solana taking a hit relative to ethereum and the l two s in terms of developers where we see increasing developer adoption is Ethereum l two s, arbitram and optimism. And our data shows that very clearly since November.
00:53:08.774 - 00:53:11.198, Speaker B: So arbitrum and. Go ahead, Sandy.
00:53:11.246 - 00:53:31.766, Speaker C: I was going to say, on a market share basis, are you tracking this as projects leaving Solana and moving to arbitrum or optimism? Interesting that you didn't say polygon. Or maybe you don't consider that a true but. Or new projects that haven't deployed in any chain.
00:53:31.870 - 00:54:02.174, Speaker A: New projects and going new projects. The developers that are moving. I only have some anecdotal data points, so not big enough to draw any conclusions. And regarding polygon, the reason why I didn't say polygon is because polygon starts with a very high baseline. So even if there's any improvement, it's very hard to see in the data. But optimism and arbitrum are starting at a much lower baseline, so improvements are very obvious.
00:54:04.674 - 00:54:13.674, Speaker C: Have you seen a particular skew preference of one over the other, or is it kind of 50 50? I would say between arbitrum and optimism.
00:54:13.794 - 00:54:14.694, Speaker A: 50 50.
00:54:16.754 - 00:54:36.094, Speaker C: Interesting. What are some of the talking about founders and projects you're working with in the cohort? Because I think you guys are an incubator that works really closely with the founders. Like, are very engaged, and I've seen that kind of firsthand. What are some of the things that are top of mind for founders these days?
00:54:39.914 - 00:55:24.114, Speaker A: It's the bear market. It's, you know, survival, how much Runway they should have. When is the best time to go out and raise again? What do they do if their traction, their metrics, whatever metrics that they track, does not improve? And by the way, this is something that almost everyone, like all the VC's, they give advice. You need to have two years of Runway. This is the best time. All these platitudes, the one thing that I don't see anyone say is that in the bear market, what I've seen is that no matter how hard you try as a founder, your metrics are always going to be correlated with the price of bitcoin. And it's really, really fucking painful.
00:55:24.114 - 00:55:45.494, Speaker A: Like, no matter what you try, no matter what product features you roll out, no matter what growth hacks you roll out, you're going to be at the mercy of the price of bitcoin. And it's soul crushing. And so what I tell our founders is if your metrics are flat over the past year, you are outperforming like 99% of all the startups out there.
00:55:46.514 - 00:56:08.284, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point. Have you noticed a particular uptick in a certain type of application idea vertical recently or over the last year, I guess if you, you know, maybe defi not so much and more skewed towards gaming or infrastructure or marketing like, you know.
00:56:13.304 - 00:56:42.424, Speaker A: In the last half a year or so, there's more. Slightly more zk, slightly more AI, there's fewer games, a lot more b, two b startups. So startups that build products for other crypto startups, a lot of L2 products for some reason.
00:56:45.484 - 00:57:04.914, Speaker C: In terms on the human capital. My last question here is on the human capital side of things. One, how do you measure that to what are some of the trends that you're observing in terms of where people are coming from and the quality of these founders?
00:57:06.774 - 00:57:25.298, Speaker A: Yeah, a year ago there were a lot of founders coming from AI into crypto. Now there's a lot of founders going from crypto back into AI, especially ever since shot chaser. Yeah.
00:57:25.346 - 00:57:33.714, Speaker C: On this point, do you see a convergence? Is it overhyped like our blockchains, a substrate of AI?
00:57:33.794 - 00:57:53.748, Speaker A: You know, like, it's certainly hype driven. I'm also seeing fewer founders coming from big tech these days. There's far more crypto natives like young Evergreen founders, very strong, very talented, but don't have.
00:57:53.756 - 00:58:20.006, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying too, is more founders who are like, they worked at Coinbase for three years or they, like. I think if you work outside of crypto, like, now is not usually the time that you get into crypto as a founder. It's like, let me risk it all. Start a company which is already super risky, and go into crypto, which if you haven't gotten into crypto at this point, you probably see it as pretty risky. It's like a lot of the companies now are like, they spend, honestly, there's some second time crypto founders now, which is like, maybe their first thing didn't.
00:58:20.030 - 00:59:11.016, Speaker C: Work, but in, in your criteria, I think of you guys as the Y combinator of web3. What are like, what. Maybe give me an example of a team that you kind of took a flyer on and then wildly surpassed, or has like surpassed your expectations. And I go back to the example of, for instance, the Airbnb guys barely made it to the cohort, I believe, and it was because they were very scrappy in the way that they had sold. Like, you know, I was at cereal boxes during the presidential campaign and that impressed Paul Graham and he squeezed him in last minute. But it just, to me, it's like, remarkable in the sense that sometimes the best founders really prove themselves over time. And initially it's not very obvious.
00:59:11.016 - 00:59:26.284, Speaker C: Sometimes the more articulate, composed founders are not the best ones. And I'm curious to get your perspective on that and how you make the filter, maybe for someone listening out there that wants to apply to your cohort.
00:59:29.704 - 01:00:08.008, Speaker A: I mean, I think fundamentally we look for founders. Our criteria are actually very similar to the criteria of the early days of YC. That is, we're looking for undervalued founders who have the potential to become really, really good. And they tend to be very technical. They tend to think about things from first principles. They might not be very articulate, they may not be, they may not even have the business acumen. But we believe that these are things that we can help them with because the alternatives, we look for very strong founders with strong, you know, track record of building previous startups.
01:00:08.008 - 01:01:02.826, Speaker A: But these would be the people who can raise from VC's. Why would they, why, why would we go after them, right? Want to help the ones that are extremely undervalued. So oftentimes we accept founders who are similar to, you know, the, you know, the Airbnb, the similar stores with similar stores to Airbnb founders. Right. But the key difference between what we're looking for now and what YC is looking for now, at least in terms of crypto companies, is that I really want to see founders think from first principles and understand, or at least can tell me why they're doing crypto, because a lot of them, they look really strong on paper, but they can't explain why they're using crypto as their foundational technology to do, to build their product. And these are the founders. One, I think they're building products that may not be that interesting.
01:01:02.826 - 01:01:14.170, Speaker A: And two, they might, they may not have that much conviction into crypto in the first place, and they probably leave. And by the way, a lot of them are leaving right now, this year, especially in the middle of the bear market.
01:01:14.242 - 01:01:48.784, Speaker C: This will be my last question. I want to, I think you're one of the best thinkers out there. You've been around for such a long time. We're at that point where a lot of people outside of crypto and even within crypto are saying, what's the whole point of this? Like, what are we actually, what are, point to me some useful applications that make all of this worthwhile, or is this just a casino that allows people and provides great entertainment and speculative value? Is that just it? Like, what do you tell to a skeptic, a cynic out there that is really questioning the reason of existence of this industry.
01:01:50.524 - 01:02:47.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, all the most vocal critiques I've seen and met are those who don't really need crypto in the first place. And they are, let's say, Americans, very wealthy or reasonably well off. But if you travel anywhere in South America or Southeast Asia, chances are if you pick a random person in the street and you talk to them, chances are they've interacted with USDT and they use USDT as actually an inflation hedge number one and two as a payment rail to pay each other. I think stablecoins are actually have made a lot of positive impact onto the world that most reasonably well off people in the west have not really personal experience.
01:02:48.914 - 01:03:22.314, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you think? I guess as a follow up, and I'm cheating, I always do this, but say it's the last question, never is. But what do you think? Is that so stablecoins Trojan Horse strategy, people want to hold dollars, you can hold USDC regulated, you feel comfortable. Perhaps it's not an endorsement, but, you know, what is the next catalyst that, you know, macro aside, that really onboards the next couple million users into the space?
01:03:22.474 - 01:03:43.210, Speaker A: I mean, I love to say games or social networks, but in the end, I think it's going to be speculation again until we reach that saturation point. I think that the first 80% of the world that will be onboarded into crypto are going to be onboarded via speculation. And once we've reached that statue.
01:03:43.282 - 01:03:44.682, Speaker C: Like chasing the next bonk.
01:03:44.738 - 01:03:45.570, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:03:45.762 - 01:03:46.138, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:46.186 - 01:04:01.614, Speaker A: And I think it's fine, like using speculation to onboard people into crypto to eventually to give us time as crypto natives to build actual applications with real utility like social networks or games or whatever. I think that's, that's. I'm okay with that.
01:04:01.994 - 01:04:27.334, Speaker B: Yeah, Chad, this is, this is awesome, man. Appreciate you sharing the fat wallet thesis and some other interesting thoughts at the end here with us. It'll be interesting to see. I mean, I feel like we've for many years, like the Spencer noon and Rick Burton Post showed us, like, we've been talking about the fat wallet, the wallet wars and the fat wallet thesis for a little while now. So it's going to be really interesting to see if this year as the year plays out. But anyways, man, always love having you on and. Yeah, thanks again.
01:04:27.794 - 01:04:29.214, Speaker A: Great. Thanks for having me.
01:04:30.494 - 01:04:43.174, Speaker C: Yeah. For anyone, I guess, listening out there. When's the next cohort? When can they apply? You're still running it. What's the best way to learn about that process and what you're kind of thinking, best way to find you.
01:04:43.254 - 01:05:03.096, Speaker A: I think that deadline for that to apply to the next cohort is January 14 or 13th, so a week from now. So I think the best way to learn about us is talk to our alumni, and they will tell you amazing things about us.
01:05:03.200 - 01:05:07.640, Speaker C: You're not just engineers. For the record, people from all kinds of backgrounds can apply, right?
01:05:07.832 - 01:05:09.524, Speaker A: Yep, 100%.
01:05:10.104 - 01:05:12.176, Speaker B: Well, appreciate it. Talk to you soon, man.
01:05:12.320 - 01:05:12.704, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
