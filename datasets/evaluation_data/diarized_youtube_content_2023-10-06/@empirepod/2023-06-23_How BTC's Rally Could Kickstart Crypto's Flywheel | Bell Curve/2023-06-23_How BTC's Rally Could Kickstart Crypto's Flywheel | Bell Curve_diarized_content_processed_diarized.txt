00:00:51.174 - 00:00:59.634, Speaker D: So I, I forgot to say, I think the, the biggest news of the, the week just dropped like about 30 minutes ago. Uh, the warriors are getting Chris Paul.
00:01:00.814 - 00:01:01.554, Speaker E: Really?
00:01:03.534 - 00:01:05.274, Speaker D: No, for, for Jordan Pool.
00:01:06.014 - 00:01:06.630, Speaker E: Wow.
00:01:06.742 - 00:01:21.668, Speaker B: This is, this is the part of the conversation where Mike taps out. I'll pretend to know what that I did. I did hear last week, I actually listened to you guys did hear that you guys were having a debate about Mike versus my athleticism. And, uh, I got better hand eye than you.
00:01:21.716 - 00:01:23.340, Speaker C: I'm just gonna say it. I got better hand eye.
00:01:23.372 - 00:01:27.544, Speaker B: I'll just say it's not even. Ask Mike how closely you follow sports.
00:01:29.764 - 00:01:32.596, Speaker E: For you, Mike, I got some photos.
00:01:32.620 - 00:01:40.556, Speaker C: Of Yanna playing wiffle at the charity tournament. Right, where. Don't make me air those things. Actually, that's a total bluff.
00:01:40.620 - 00:01:47.522, Speaker B: Neither one of us played. Either one of us could play. Bunch of two sub 30 year olds with blown out backs. Yeah.
00:01:47.618 - 00:01:47.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:47.954 - 00:01:48.786, Speaker B: You hate to see it.
00:01:48.850 - 00:01:51.614, Speaker E: Didn't even step to the wiffle ball layoffs.
00:01:52.074 - 00:02:03.294, Speaker B: Actually, I actually saved one home run, but tumbled backwards and looking bad up there. I signed up for like three months of pt after catching that thing.
00:02:06.954 - 00:02:12.474, Speaker C: Oh, my God. Yeah, we were playing like these, like, blue collar, like, 50 year old guys who just, they look like they.
00:02:12.514 - 00:02:12.858, Speaker E: Everyone.
00:02:12.946 - 00:02:13.922, Speaker B: I think we were the only one.
00:02:13.938 - 00:02:18.704, Speaker C: That didn't have, like, matching, matching outfits for that, for that thing.
00:02:19.964 - 00:02:21.308, Speaker E: Taking it too seriously anyways.
00:02:21.356 - 00:02:49.528, Speaker C: Taking it too seriously. Yeah. All right, why don't we just launch right into the news of the week? I think the big headline is obviously the ETF's. So this actually happened at the tail end of last week, but BlackRock announced that they were filing for an ETF. Blackrock is the largest asset manager in the world. They've got $9 trillion in assets under management. And their record for getting ETF's approved is 575 approved to one not approved.
00:02:49.528 - 00:03:11.508, Speaker C: So pretty good post Blackrock. There's just been a slew of, uh, other ETF issuers that have filed. So bitwise reignite their, their ETF application. Same with invesco, same with wisdom tree. So pretty big week and prices have responded. So bitcoin sort of leading the charge. It's been a very good week for bitcoin and the rest of crypto.
00:03:11.508 - 00:03:16.824, Speaker C: So what do you guys sign? I know it's been talked about a little bit, but what are your guys takes on this?
00:03:18.444 - 00:04:03.764, Speaker E: I think initial take is just like, sentiment flips on a dime. Like, people can't even remember how they felt two or three weeks ago. And you have like CMS intern memes, you have fractals to 100 8200k for bitcoin. People are like expecting this to get approved next week. So it just shows like, how, how fickle sentiment is. And to me, bear markets are when price doesnt go up on good news. And this is very much price going up on good news and its solution to a lot of the existential considerations, the asset class, in terms of are we ever going to be let into the kingdom of tradfi? I think November, December, January was probably not never.
00:04:03.764 - 00:04:31.024, Speaker E: And now it looks like theres going to be, theres EDX, the Citadel Exchange, theres the Soros fund coming out and saying crypto has a place. Jerome Powell says crypto is not going anywhere. You have the spot. ETF, which is looking like it gets considered, and its not just bitcoin. Theres going to be a plurality of these things. If bitcoin gets considered and approved, ETH is probably next after that. Yeah, it's good to see.
00:04:31.024 - 00:04:48.588, Speaker E: All of a sudden, you look at the chart. The previous all time high of bitcoin was, I think, 69,000, and we're at 30. Once you get to 50% of the drawdown erased, people start thinking all time high. That's just how.
00:04:48.756 - 00:05:03.324, Speaker B: Yeah, people start thinking, we're close. I mean, you could see it in the social sentiment. There are these different tools that track social sentiment. 6 million people tweeted bitcoin ETF. 6 million people tweeted bitcoin ETF last week.
00:05:04.224 - 00:05:42.154, Speaker E: And its always like the cold star problem because things like bitcoin and ETH are more likely to be successful the higher the prices, which is the opposite of every other tech company. If meters up ten x, its more likely to go down than at that point wrong. The business fundamentals don't justify that. But like things like digital gold or things that are reflexive like ETH, if you can get the cold start solved and you get people talking and the flywheel started, um, you know, if, if people, if, if bitcoin goes over 40k, people are like thinking like next six to nine months, like all time high, that, that kind of feels like where we're going to go at some point.
00:05:42.454 - 00:06:57.692, Speaker D: So my 100% agree with all that. Um, I think the other take here, the additional take here is like, let's think about this in the context of the timeline where youve got over the last few weeks, over the last few months, just terrible sentiment from regulators as to wanting to blow this industry up, drive it into the ground. Its never going to be legal in the United States. Then youve got the largest partners of asset managers, largest asset managers in the space, investo wisdom tree and Blackrock and Fidelity Citadel, Charles Schwab, all coming out with positive sentiment, positive news, a desire to move in that direction. And I think that it turns it around. Instead of when we were talking about this last summer, we were all thinking, okay, whens going to be the Jay Powell put? I think now were talking about the GG put. When youve got all this stuff happening in parallel, when youve got these massive asset managers coming through and saying, hey, were actually going to step out and support this, you assume that it has been de risked from regulatory perspective, from a reputational perspective, from a business perspective for these, and this is maybe one read of why these blackrocks of the world are putting out the ETF.
00:06:57.692 - 00:07:07.948, Speaker D: There may be other reads. Maybe this is just the straw man or maybe this is just a signal. I don't necessarily buy into that. I think those are a little bit more contrived perspectives.
00:07:08.036 - 00:07:10.068, Speaker C: But if we think about this also.
00:07:10.116 - 00:08:08.766, Speaker D: In the timeline of what's happening in 2024, there is positive sentiment with what we know is coming in probably march of the happening of bitcoin and the timeline for these ETF's potentially getting approved 240 days, which is, I think in February or March of 2024, there is just a new narrative. Obviously, all of that coincides with one of the most negative sentiment periods of time ive seen in crypto in the last seven years. And there was a massive amount of short interest happening while that negative sentiment was happening. It was one of the most low volatility periods that weve seen. And I think a lot of the move up was definitely a short squeeze, but then it was also driven by positive narrative. What happens going forward? Who, who knows? But I do think we're going to see a lot more positive movements, and it's really going to come down to a regulatory fight. And, you know, is it going to be the market structure bill or the draft bill, which is now like.
00:08:08.766 - 00:08:33.978, Speaker D: I think that was actually one of the biggest things that came out over the last couple of days. There will be a vote on that on July 19 out of committee, and that that is a huge step forward. That'll be the first time that we have a regulatory bill that's pro crypto or at least supportive of crypto going up for a vote. So it's, it's all of these news stories coinciding in a backdrop of the most negative sentiment period of time from a regulatory perspective. So I think that's my question.
00:08:34.026 - 00:08:42.574, Speaker C: Dirty. Yeah. Can we just remember that just last week we were talking about whether or not this was a worse cycle in terms of sentiment than 2019.
00:08:42.924 - 00:08:43.664, Speaker E: Right.
00:08:44.124 - 00:08:49.516, Speaker C: That was one week ago that that was a legitimate question that was getting floated around Twitter. Now look where we all are.
00:08:49.660 - 00:09:17.988, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think that Blackrock. So this comes on the back of two interesting things, right? The SEC is currently in a lawsuit with Grayscale over Grayscale on ETF. And also the SEC is currently suing Coinbase. Blackrock is filing a spot, bitcoin ETF, using Coinbase custody on the back end. Right. So, like, what do you think that Blackrock knows here that the rest of us don't know? Is it just that they know? I mean.
00:09:17.988 - 00:09:19.544, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you, what do you think about that?
00:09:22.524 - 00:09:58.700, Speaker E: I think, like, there's two schools of thought. One is like, this is a line manager on the ETF product suite that just, like, threw this in and is like, hoping to maybe get in front of other people, know, get in position if grayscale wins. Just like, wants to be considered. The other school of thought is like, this is coming down from on high from Larry Fink directly. And hes like giga brain 60 chess, trying to do all sorts of things within the democratic political machine. He thinks that coinbase is something that hell use long term. Ive seen all these conspiracy theories.
00:09:58.700 - 00:10:02.960, Speaker E: Its probably somewhere in the middle, um, of. I'm surprised.
00:10:02.992 - 00:10:07.944, Speaker B: I'm surprised none of the four of us showed up with the tinfoil hat on. Right. Like I would have done.
00:10:07.984 - 00:10:08.536, Speaker C: I just didn't have.
00:10:08.560 - 00:10:18.560, Speaker B: You don't like the. You don't like the take. Like, this is the. The entire past year was a giant inside job. Coordinated by, by Wall street parasites and government regulators so they could catch up to the old bitcoin.
00:10:18.672 - 00:10:48.204, Speaker E: I feel like that's like just table stakes. I don't even feel like that's a conspiracy theory. Um, it's also like kind of too obvious maybe for me, like double agent conspiracy theory. Like conspiracy theory to the conspiracy theory. I don't know if there's really any inside track here. I think it's more of a forcing function of this is going to happen eventually. And I think now what's going to weigh on market sentiment is like, I don't think maybe this gets approved in the next 45 days.
00:10:48.204 - 00:11:10.014, Speaker E: That's what this guy Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg seems to believe. And he's like way more knowledgeable about ETF's than I am. I also think there's a high likelihood that Gary Gensler drags us out till February. Yeah, between now and February, what are we all thinking? It's probably somewhere between the sentiment that we had before and the sentiment that we had now.
00:11:11.314 - 00:11:24.364, Speaker C: I think also just to address the conspiracy theory stuff, because many people are, oh, well, right after the SEC enforcement action, you know, all of these tradfi things, first of all, we'll talk about the exchange as well. But you know, that NDX, what is the name of that exchange?
00:11:24.944 - 00:11:25.576, Speaker E: EdX.
00:11:25.640 - 00:11:44.248, Speaker C: That was announced a long time ago. So all of this stuff has been in the work. The way these institutions work isn't to, you know, do a snap decision here and hey, let's roll an exchange out because, you know, bitcoin is down. That's just these things take a much longer period of time. The other thing is I just. Look, I love a good conspiracy theory. I'll wear that noah t shirt thing.
00:11:44.248 - 00:12:03.546, Speaker C: But I think the simplest Occam's razor explanation to this is just that we were, we were morons for the last two years. I mean, it's much simpler explanation for me to think that the institution saw that there was something here. They wanted to get their piece of it. They weren't going to decide to participate when we were being full stream morons.
00:12:03.610 - 00:12:05.522, Speaker B: This feels like a good opportune time.
00:12:05.578 - 00:12:11.066, Speaker C: I don't even think you have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe this. This is just good business strategy from their standpoint.
00:12:11.210 - 00:12:45.094, Speaker E: All these guys love a bargain. Yeah, I feel like, how many of them been hurt just by buying things that were zeitgeisty and AI is fully priced? I don't know what they're going to do with that. But if you do anything now, you're probably going to buy close to or the actual top crypto is beaten down, but it's not going anywhere. Bitcoin, even at these prices, is like a $600 billion asset, $500 billion asset. People think that bitcoin has failed as an experiment, but it's like the biggest alternative store value that exists. This is going to be something thats important. I think they recognize that.
00:12:45.094 - 00:13:33.638, Speaker E: I dont know if theres any imminent approval coming, but like I said, if you have a few wins on the legal litigation side, which Coinbase seems to have, you have a tactical narrative of tradfi starting to get behind this. This is what happened in the last bear market, honestly. But like, you know, sub out some of that for like Michael Saylor starting to buy bitcoin and telling everyone it's legitimate. Tesla, Tesla, you know, all that stuff. And one of the things that I find super interesting about prior cycles is that if you ask somebody to remember or to recall to you what exactly happened and when it happened, they would have no idea what, what actually happened. It was just too much euphoria, too much craziness. Like, they wouldn't be able to tell you the order in which the assets went up.
00:13:33.638 - 00:14:09.034, Speaker E: But like bitcoin, every cycle leads. I'm just looking at this chart, right, so this is the BTC dominance chart. Let me just throw out a couple numbers just to illustrate this. So December 2020 crypto has broke, or bitcoin has broken through its all time high. It's at 34,000. By the end of December, ETH BTC is at zero two six didn't basically move. Bitcoin ripped first.
00:14:09.034 - 00:14:42.054, Speaker E: And then you have from March 2021 to about May, you have that ratio effectively quadruple. And so you kind of need to get the simping for bitcoin out of the way early. And it's a very digestible asset. It's a very simple narrative, it's very easy, but it's the gateway drug to all these different things. You have all these different assets in crypto. And I think that's what I'm framing this in my mind as. Okay, this is probably the start.
00:14:42.054 - 00:14:47.054, Speaker E: If you see this big bitcoin dominance move up, this is probably the start.
00:14:49.594 - 00:14:56.916, Speaker C: I would agree with that. And I think it's. You could even look at, um, yeah.
00:14:56.940 - 00:14:58.196, Speaker B: I think there's two, there's two ways.
00:14:58.220 - 00:15:31.146, Speaker C: That I think about bitcoin dominance, which is there's sort of a secular trend, and then there's a more cyclical trend that could be kind of useful to you. The secular trend of bitcoin dominance is down, you know, over a period. Let me zoom out a little bit more. If you go further back, right. And before 2017, it was, you know, about 95% dominance that if this was a stock chart, right. It looks like it bounces here and now it's going to bounce again, but it's going to make lower highs. And I expect that to continue to be the case because a lot of the innovation and value that's getting created in crypto isn't just concentrated in bitcoin anymore.
00:15:31.146 - 00:16:02.254, Speaker C: I think that's a pretty healthy thing. But cyclically, I think bitcoin dominance tends to bottom at the absolute peak of market euphoria. This is January of 2018. And then its kind of the first thing to catch a bid as well on the other side. So this might be the beginning of that process. So I basically would just agree with you. And then you can tell here bitcoin dominance peaked in December of 2020, and then it was basically down only when everyone rotated into ETH and Alts and those sorts of things.
00:16:02.374 - 00:16:32.044, Speaker B: Preston yeah, I think its a really healthy indicator that shows that money and interest are flooding into the space, because I dont think youre going to, I agree with what Vance said. I dont think you can have a bull run until this bitcoin dominance starts to rise a little bit, because at the end of the day, bitcoins not really getting moved from retail buying right now. Its getting moved from institutional buying, I would assume. And I think this shows that theres the first real spark of institutional interest back in crypto and probably a year and a half here.
00:16:32.164 - 00:17:08.304, Speaker D: Preston, one of the questions we were discussing earlier today is, what does a spot ETF, uh, let's say Blackrock ends up winning it. Blackrock gets to distribute it to all of its financial advisors who are selling it into the salesforce of Blackrock. Like, what does that actually do to bitcoin, the marginal buyer? You know, there's some analysis that we've seen where it says if for every dollar that you put in has a 15 to 20 x dollar multiplier in terms of the market cap, like, where do you think, do you think that there's enough net interest right now from ETF purchasers to really drive a new narrative?
00:17:09.564 - 00:17:34.104, Speaker B: Not from ETF purchasers. I think I'm just scarred by that specific narrative of, like, the institutions are coming. They're putting bitcoin on their private platform, and they're in their private wealth management platform. They're all going to buy, because now, for the first time ever, they have the ability to buy directly from the JPMorgan private Bank. I think that narrative, it's probably why I'm going to miss the next web3 social alert, probably because I'm so scarred by that narrative.
00:17:35.014 - 00:17:48.510, Speaker C: I would push back on that. I view those as different things. There is sort of the corporate blockchain, not bitcoin arguments. But I've always thought it'd be super bullish if you could just buy bitcoin directly from your fidelity brokerage, which you can now.
00:17:48.542 - 00:17:48.990, Speaker B: Well, you can do.
00:17:49.022 - 00:18:08.150, Speaker C: I think. Yeah, I just think once that, like, an ETF would, first of all, it would give a real seal of legitimacy. A lot of the conversations about is this going to be legal? Is it not going to be legal? So there's the actual flows sort of component in terms of how much demand is it going to drive? But then there's the credibility argument. I think they're both, I think they're both powerful.
00:18:08.302 - 00:18:29.086, Speaker B: Here's a, here's a maybe. It's. I don't know what you guys think of this take, but I, I think that maybe the SEC thinks that they just can't win the grayscale case and they're going to roll over on bitcoin while still trying to kill the rest of like, protocols and like, the long tail of, of crypto assets. So maybe they roll over on bitcoin but keep trying to attack. Yeah.
00:18:29.230 - 00:18:31.466, Speaker D: Give the industry a winner.
00:18:31.466 - 00:18:48.428, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, like, make them look reasonable. I think maybe the SEC realizes that they went a little too far and that seems to be the sentiment in DC, is that Gensler thundered his hand too much. So, like, maybe this is them pulling back a little bit, but I don't. I have no idea.
00:18:48.476 - 00:19:17.432, Speaker E: Unfortunately, I don't think crypto, unfortunately for them, I don't think crypto works that way. Right. If you did this with stocks, if you said that, you know, Tesla is the only legitimate EV automaker sanctioned by the government, all the other EV's would tank. All the EV companies would tank. If you do that with crypto, if you say that bitcoin is legit, we're going to give it a spot ETF, what's everybody going to do? They're going to buy alts. It's a global game. There's exchanges that are outside the reach of the US.
00:19:17.432 - 00:19:23.164, Speaker E: That's just how it works. So maybe they try that. I'm not sure how effective it would be.
00:19:25.684 - 00:19:29.504, Speaker D: I have another there and therein lies the GG put.
00:19:31.004 - 00:20:03.228, Speaker C: Yeah. The other thought, this is where I really wish I had a tinfoil hat. But I find this argument from the Maxis super frustrating because they're the tagline kind of is it? Everything else is a security except for bitcoin. But at the same time, the Maxis believe that the US is this, like, top down sort of scam about funneling money up to the top. So if you had to pick one crypto which was the most directly against the interests of the United States government, you'd have to pick bitcoin. Right. I mean, it's.
00:20:03.228 - 00:20:10.504, Speaker C: The other ones aren't necessarily explicitly trying to be money, and the other ones that the tagline isn't down with the US dollar.
00:20:12.564 - 00:20:55.734, Speaker D: Right. But the one thing that you could say, though, you can confusing securities regulations with, like, money and OCC regulations and CFTC and commodity regulations, like, those aren't all intertwined. Like, the government cabal coming together to say, like, that's the thing that we need to go kill. I think you can use individual perspectives as perspective on how to change things, regulate things, control things. But, like, the SEC isn't really going to win an argument and has already come out and said, I don't think Gary Gensler has actually said this yet, but other members of the SEC have said that bitcoin is not a security. So, like, the cat's already out of the bag. But no, I don't think you can run that back.
00:20:56.074 - 00:21:22.848, Speaker C: I get that. But that's why I wanted my tinfoil add on for this particular part, because I know that it's not like one big cabal and everyone's not on the phone being like, let's kill bitcoin. But I do think countries in general respond to national interests. And if bitcoin were to be successful, as the explicit stated intention is, that's not within us interests. And I think it's a convoluted argument to say that it. That it is.
00:21:22.936 - 00:22:05.140, Speaker E: So I think the most interesting thing about the ETF is, like, does it drive additional flows? And I think it will, but it won't in the way that people imagine it. I think the narrative of it being approved by Blackrock and brought into the regulatory fold is a narrative that drives flows. But, like, we've had veto for, you know, two years at this point. Um, you know, this is not like a new phenomenon. You can go buy GBTC in your 401k retirement account if you want. Like, there's a lot of ways to access this. And the other stuff is that Coinbase has been onboarding a lot of like the biggest hedge funds, biggest asset managers in the, on the world and like they are some of the primary, um, users of this stuff.
00:22:05.140 - 00:22:31.944, Speaker E: And like I get that there's an angle of like, you know, if you want to short it, you cant really do that on Coinbase if youre really upsized asset manager. Also, ive heard that these asset managers want to use it for leverage and do different things with it that are only available within the prototypical broker dealer custodian model. I think theres some, but weve already had this for a long time, so I dont think its turning on the floodgates.
00:22:33.524 - 00:22:50.332, Speaker D: The counterargument there would be you can go buy GBTC or beto. Beto has an expense ratio that's underperformed bitcoin. GBTC is at like a 32 33% discount and it requires you, both of those require you to be, or the GBTC requires you to be an accredited investor.
00:22:50.428 - 00:22:52.876, Speaker C: I mean the, the most, the largest.
00:22:52.940 - 00:23:37.714, Speaker D: Asset holders in the US as a population right now are the boomers, the baby boomers. And they're, you know, have no access. Effectively, if you're in a retirement account to be able like 401 ks, you can't unless you're on fidelity. Um, fidelity digital assets allows you to buy bitcoin and ETH right now, but if you have a 401k, you can't get access to bitcoin, frankly. So there is an argument that there is a net new buyer. I agree though, that I don't think that it's going to be as pronounced as the expectation of everybody with this potential application getting approved is expecting. I think that there will be net new, but it's going to be more of the, the benefit will be realized in the institutionalization of bitcoin, less in the actual flows.
00:23:40.254 - 00:24:09.694, Speaker E: Alex Weiss also had a tweet where he marked all of the ETF approval and denial dates and its pretty clear the market topped on the approval and the denials. And I think its kind of interesting. The last cycle ended with the veto. ETF was approved, I think December 10, 2021. This cycle will start with it. Just like.
00:24:10.754 - 00:24:33.332, Speaker D: Do you remember Vance, you remember in, I think it was March of 2017 when the Winklevoss twins had their application denied. And that's what kicked off all of the excitement around ETH. And frankly, Ico Summer, like the denials and the provols, are major catalysts up and down.

00:25:25.702 - 00:26:03.548, Speaker B: App let me ask you guys about, about eDX markets. So EdX is this exchange that citadel, fidelity, Virtu, Charles Schwab, Sequoia and interestingly enough, paradigm are behind. So they announced it back in, I think it was September of 2022, but it just went live this past week. So that's why it was in the news again. The only four tokens that are trading on it are, I think it's litecoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin and ETH. Whos trading on this, do you think? And would any crypto native funds, would you guys ever trade on this or. Theres no reason for you to trade on it.
00:26:03.548 - 00:26:05.948, Speaker B: Preston, before we talk about this, I.
00:26:05.956 - 00:27:05.344, Speaker E: Just want to say that if you knew that there was a bitcoin ETF news coming and you bought bitcoin, you would still underperform bitcoin cash. Thats the extent to which all this stuff is correlated, especially alts that are liquid and move a lot, not necessarily like a buy of bitcoin if bitcoin ETF gets approved. But on the eDX stuff like we've heard, this is Citadel is basically main play for crypto. They've stopped doing a lot of the OTC stuff, but it's run by a guy who was very prominent in the organization. It's clearly a very kind of like overcomplicated version of what you could do with crypto, but they've separated the custodian from the clearing, from the trading. It's great, but it doesn't make a ton of sense within the context of crypto just being a more efficient version of all of that. I don't think we would ever trade there.
00:27:05.344 - 00:27:39.404, Speaker E: I mean, we have ETH, we have bitcoin, litecoin, bch. I don't know why we would do that, but I expect this to take a lot of share away from places like Coinbase, frankly, and Binance. All of the color that we have from the people that we trade with and work with are that they largely, if they're still in the US, move to the CME. And you can see that in the CME volumes that ramps over the first six months, that really is becoming a center of flow where it historically has not been. So, yeah, I think the next cycle broadly, will kind of be like a regulatory cycle.
00:27:40.604 - 00:27:50.984, Speaker C: I have a question. I might be misunderstanding this, but I thought that EdX was going to partner with brokerages. You wouldnt go and trade at EdX. Its an actual exchange.
00:27:51.404 - 00:27:53.556, Speaker E: Yeah, I may be related, Preston.
00:27:53.660 - 00:28:00.584, Speaker B: They funnel trades through to different brokerages, I think similar to youre not going on the New York Stock Exchange and making.
00:28:02.644 - 00:28:12.188, Speaker D: I believe, I think I read this, its API only. Theres no interface. It's just an exchange to trade. Um, and institutional only in that respect.
00:28:12.356 - 00:28:43.632, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're launching a clearinghouse to settle trades, but not, not yet. Um, but I think the key here is that, like, if you look at all the crypto exchanges today, there's this kind of, like, they're a hodgepodge of, like, custody and settlement and, like, they have the exchange and, like, they are the broker as well, kind of. But, like, that model doesn't even really fully make sense. If you apply it to crypto, this is like, we are going to take the traditional model of separating custody, settlement and exchange, and then apply it to crypto trading, which, which doesn't really exist. So what would be, what would you.
00:28:43.648 - 00:28:51.864, Speaker D: Say the comp here is more like Nasdaq New York stock exchange versus, like, this, the monolith that you would have with Coinbase binance. Is that a fair assumption?
00:28:51.984 - 00:28:53.904, Speaker B: That is, yeah. Okay.
00:28:53.984 - 00:28:55.444, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I thought, too.
00:28:55.824 - 00:29:11.832, Speaker E: So, like, people joke about, like, the cabal in crypto or like, the cartel, you know, there's like a room where everyone's fates are decided and where, like, the market direction is chosen. Um, I don't think that exists, honestly, in crypto. I don't think it really exists in trad five. But, like, someone who was in the.
00:29:11.848 - 00:29:13.800, Speaker B: Cabal would say that would be something.
00:29:13.832 - 00:30:08.084, Speaker E: That I would say all the travel guys kind of travel in the same circles we've noticed over time. And there's like, you know, like, if you can just turn on crypto trading by going to the citadel branded, run licensed exchange versus getting ic approval, to get on the coinbase and do all of that stuff, its just going to make easier for them to pump on board. And I think thats what most of the trad five people within crypto are talking about at this point. Its like, are you going to go trade on CME or are you going to wait for EDX to get up and running for real? Because its just like its another API within the same regulatory framework and technology stack that. This is the interesting part. It's the same technology stack that Citadel securities works with. If you're already trading on the largest market maker in the world, you can trade on EDX.
00:30:09.664 - 00:31:05.114, Speaker D: Just as an anecdotal piece of info, one of our investors back in the day, when we were talking with them about DeFi and using things on chain and trying to get all this, they're very traditional registered investment advisor and they were telling us it took them I think like six months approval, just be able to stand up a separate, like airdrop computer not, doesn't have any of the software running on it. And that was like their Defi computer and it had to stay in the office, they had to have monitoring on where the ledger was. Like the controls that maybe just like, unless you're in that position in that institution, the controls that are associated with rias and financial advisors and, you know, all the stuff that comes with that are so strong that nobody's willing to even go there. If you have to be able to promote this idea, like step outside the bounds and try something new, I think it's underappreciated how hard that is.
00:31:05.734 - 00:31:06.554, Speaker E: Yup.
00:31:08.574 - 00:31:16.674, Speaker C: It's just one thing that's sort of funny to me is that litecoin and bitcoin cash are included there. That's just a funny selection of assets.
00:31:17.394 - 00:31:29.498, Speaker E: I mean, its no coincidence that those are the same poor assets that Gary Gensler in that one speech said are not securities except for bitcoin cash. Well, maybe you did say that one. I forget, but I dont know.
00:31:29.546 - 00:31:47.800, Speaker C: Because even Jason Ive gone into Bloomberg a couple of times, and if you just open up a Bloomberg terminal, look at the crypto products that they cover, like bitcoin and Ethan, then its like every ICO shitcoin from 2017 is like ripple stellar. Bitcoin cash, litecoin, they're all up there.
00:31:47.992 - 00:32:08.324, Speaker E: I think lost within this also is like the fact that ETH is in there. It's been said it's not a security by the CFTC. It feels like it's in the process of being blessed by the tradfi community. But having it on these places is extremely bullish in my mind.
00:32:09.364 - 00:32:58.044, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say that. I don't think it, I don't think in this era of the SEC, we're going to be able to see them, bless it, as not a security. It's going to have to live in this, in this phase of purgatory, mostly because if they said that it's not a security, what that does is it gives credence to the Hidman documents and it basically gives a playbook for anybody else who says, hey, we just followed the playbook of Ethereum. You've already said that Ethereum isn't a security because it become sufficiently decentralized. And if you run that playbook, you can make it such that you believe that you're sufficiently decentralized without. All of this is to get at without new legislation. Frankly, what's at least been discussed in the draft market structure bill, where you have definitions around all this stuff, we're just going to continue to live in a world of purgatory.
00:33:01.384 - 00:33:06.286, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I guess we'll have to see how the regulatory stuff plays out over the next couple of years.
00:33:06.400 - 00:33:07.586, Speaker B: Well, I would love to maybe talk.
00:33:07.610 - 00:33:10.854, Speaker C: A little bit about ethscriptions. I know you guys were excited on this.
00:33:11.434 - 00:33:53.730, Speaker B: Can we just. There's, there's one other, like, institutional news thing that nobody really talked about this week, which was actually SAP, um, which like, seemed boring, but I don't know if you guys read this blog post. Um, so SAP powers a lot of like Fortune one thousands. They're kind of like the underlying infrastructure for how a lot of Fortune five hundred s and Fortune 1000s, like collect payments and do their billing and accounting and all that stuff. They put out a blog post today, it's a couple of days ago, it says today, cross border payments are a hassle for small and mid sized enterprises with international business partners. Expensive up to $50 a transaction, slow up to seven days to transmit the money, and non transparent, you never know the status of the transaction. These major challenges can get solved with digital money as a means of settlement.
00:33:53.730 - 00:34:24.484, Speaker B: And blockchain is the underlying technology. And what they announced a couple of days ago is that SAP is now testing cross border payments for all of their customers using USDC. And I think this is a narrative that is completely dead. The payments narrative is completely dead. But I actually had breakfast with someone yesterday who, they're working on the same thing, but for consumers, they're really good. Crypto founder, been building for several years. They are working entirely on this payments solution.
00:34:24.484 - 00:35:02.764, Speaker B: And I think this could be a narrative that like stable coins in the real world economy, this could be a narrative that comes back that nobody's talking about. And I think reading that SAP blog post, you can really quickly imagine a world where millions of businesses, I mean, it already happens in crypto, we accept, where millions of businesses all around the world can settle this inner company trade instantaneously using USDC and other stable coins. Get a little echo, by the way. But yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty excited actually, this renewed interest in payments. Curious what you guys think.
00:35:04.064 - 00:36:06.294, Speaker D: Jay Powell yesterday in front of Congress said that we should consider stable coins to be a form of money. And as one of the comments that he made yesterday, which I thought was pretty profound, I think we're going to start to see cross border, frankly, as we see um, efficiencies gained on. We've talked about this before, but native minting of USDC I think provides a really strong use case for bringing USDC over onto a L2, onto an execution environment where it's just that much cheaper to transact. I saw sending a token or sending ETH on most of these l two s was getting close to that $0.01 cost basis. And you assume a couple more iterations and a couple more improvements and you're sending unlimited amounts of value for less than a cent over a L2. If you have that with native minting, you then have the security guarantees of USDC and the cost reduction that make payments viable.
00:36:06.294 - 00:37:04.564, Speaker D: I think when you break down what payments really are, it really comes down to just their cost per execution, person to person payments, and is going to be probably the hardest in person payments. So point of sale transactions is sort of the next hardest. You're used to having to pay a fee in those types of situations, which is just assumed by the merchant cross border payments, that fee goes up in some cases to be percentages, if not like 10% of the total value. And so you just start to tick those things off and break down. Okay, in the payments ecosystem, whats going to be the most viable right now? Cross border. Then it comes down to its not really a cost structure there, its about availability. So how do you get USCC or any of the local currencies to accept that as a form of cross border payment? I think itll be still a long ways before you get point of sale transactions to support USDC, mostly because people are just obsessed and addicted to the points that they get from credit cards.
00:37:04.564 - 00:37:13.184, Speaker D: But I think payments is always going to be a viable, reliable option. It really, frankly, just comes down to cost and that's what drives adoption payments.
00:37:16.444 - 00:38:01.790, Speaker C: Robert I'm not super bullish on it in the short to medium term. I just think there's this guy framework a little while ago that really resonated, which was just if you have a product and you can make something like a service or product order of magnitude better, but you have to add one step. Good luck, your toast. And as opposed to if you have a product that's just as good but you get to remove a step, then that's a gigantic business right there. And I just think even if you magically transported to a world where everyone is already on blockchain rails, no one would ever use the system that we have in tradfi. It sucks. But because we don't have that, what you're asking is tons of individual merchants and business businesses to understand how to use this stuff and retrain and do new systems.
00:38:01.790 - 00:38:04.392, Speaker C: So I think it's just to be.
00:38:04.408 - 00:39:03.504, Speaker D: Clear though, Mike, everybody thinks of payments as being like Venmo transactions and using your Apple Pay or credit card at a point of sale, like orders of magnitude more value are transferred across border every single day in business to business transactions. I didn't see the SAP announcement, but we're talking tens to hundreds of more value is in the payments realm. In that area of the world where cross border effects and reliability of actually receiving the money that you get. If you send a, a wire transfer and it has more than two stops, so three or four different FX conversions, theres a 95% chance that your money actually shows up on the other end. So if you want to send value to Nigeria for instance, its got to go through euros, its got to go through to the local currency and then to the bank account that youre trying to send it to, the reliability there is actually still extremely small. So specifically what Im referring to is cross border and potentially with FX and vault.
00:39:04.574 - 00:39:49.282, Speaker C: What's like an example of a, like a cross border payment for that? Because you still need to, like if you're going between currencies, you're still basically FX trading. You're going like euro to USDC to dollar because, right, like no one in, you know, in like the real world, I use USDC, but it's for crypto stuff usually. Like if you want to do crypto things and buy crypto stuff, then USDC is a more, there's more utility as a dollar, but in the real world you can't pay for anything at the store with USDC. So I think that's the point I'm trying to get at, is there's still that three hop conversion of currency to USDC to x, and then you need a different set of infrastructure to manage those transactions. So that's the friction. That's the friction that I see in the short term.
00:39:49.378 - 00:39:59.574, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And, you know, the difference would be it's on a blockchain where you can check it versus, like, a correspondent bank where the money flows out, and you're like, I hope this comes back on the other side.
00:39:59.994 - 00:40:17.322, Speaker C: That is true, and it does suck. We had one small period of time where we had to, as blockworks, make a bunch of international cross border payments. And I can tell you it was horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. It's literally the close out, and five.
00:40:17.378 - 00:40:19.986, Speaker D: Days later, you hope it ends up and where it's supposed to go.
00:40:20.170 - 00:40:20.770, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:20.882 - 00:40:24.090, Speaker B: You think bridging your assets over to an l two or bad money in.
00:40:24.122 - 00:40:27.998, Speaker D: International wireless waiting 20 minutes versus mating four days.
00:40:28.046 - 00:40:28.982, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:29.078 - 00:40:44.710, Speaker B: Baby steps, though. Like, this is cool. Like, one of the reasons this thing, the SAP is cool is like, I don't know, remember when everyone was talking about private ledgers? Like, SAP is using public ethereum for global trade with USCC. Like, it probably takes ten times longer than we realize, but I don't know. Baby steps.
00:40:44.782 - 00:40:47.814, Speaker E: So I'm there with Viano. I'm bullish.
00:40:47.974 - 00:40:48.870, Speaker D: Let's go, then.
00:40:48.982 - 00:40:49.806, Speaker E: Let's go, baby.
00:40:49.870 - 00:40:53.954, Speaker B: All right, we're talking descriptions. Speaking of being bullish.
00:40:56.534 - 00:40:59.674, Speaker E: Tell me, your analyst ten year thesis on eatscriptions.
00:41:00.934 - 00:41:03.074, Speaker D: First, let's do a description of it.
00:41:04.654 - 00:41:27.644, Speaker B: Here's my. I'm sure you guys understand it better than I do, but basically. All right, so you have the EVM. The EVM processes user transactions and stores a bunch of data. There's, like, different types of data, right? There's persistent contract data, which is like the storage. There's temporary contract data, which is the memory, and then there's the transaction data, like transaction input data. And this is call data.
00:41:27.644 - 00:41:57.904, Speaker B: If you look at both, storage and call data can be permanent, but call data is just. Again, my understanding is it's a lot cheaper to use. And the reason for this is because smart contracts can't read the call data unless it's. This is where my understanding breaks down. But unless it's the input to one of its own functions. And I think that's the basis for ethscription. So ETH scriptions are basically just chunks of call data that store images or texts.
00:41:57.904 - 00:42:27.644, Speaker B: And so if you look at here, sometimes it's helpful to see it. I'll pull up. I just found this one on Etherscan. If you can see this here. So this is Etherscan and you can scroll down and this input data doesn't look like anything, but if you change it to this UTF view, you can see there's just an image here. So this is an ETH scription. And voila.
00:42:27.644 - 00:42:45.684, Speaker B: It's like ordinals, but with better branding because ordinals, I should say it sounds like ordinals. I think it's basically ordinals. You hear the word ordinals though, and doesn't really mean anything. I think the branding on ETH scriptions is really nice. It's an inscription on ETH. See it on Etherscan. There you go.
00:42:47.504 - 00:43:02.496, Speaker E: I like it. God bless these kids who are just using Ethereum for things it really was not intended to be used for, but cool. Anyways, I don't know if this is like a ten year thesis or like you need to go out. I think there's like ether punks now, right?
00:43:02.600 - 00:43:07.134, Speaker B: Yeah, they sold out instantly. Ethereum punks, instant iconic.
00:43:07.554 - 00:43:14.290, Speaker E: I mean, like, is it a bit silly? Do we already have nfts? Really need this, you know?
00:43:14.322 - 00:43:15.682, Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
00:43:15.858 - 00:43:23.970, Speaker E: Potentially no. But I think also it's like we're just continuing to bootstrap culture around ETH one. Yeah, it's pretty.
00:43:24.002 - 00:43:58.314, Speaker B: I think. I think here's the thesis for ETH scriptions is that there's a lot of stuff happening in the NFT world where like people are realizing that maybe I'm going to botch all of this. But if you look at foundation or OpenSea or something like that, you realize that a lot of NFT value and information is actually stored more at the Zora. I don't have the details, but on Opensea and not at the protocol level. But Etherscan is the source of truth.
00:43:58.934 - 00:43:59.790, Speaker C: For all of ETH.
00:43:59.862 - 00:44:16.780, Speaker B: It's. And it can be recreated just using this decentralized ETH data. So ETH scriptions are like maybe more of a hardened data as opposed to something that's stored at the app level. Does that make sense?
00:44:16.852 - 00:44:39.632, Speaker E: A hard day. I mean, also what a beautiful business. Etherscan is never raised outside funding. I think they're based in Malay or something. Probably like wildly profitable, but it's just been the source of truth for as long as I've been in crypto. Same with Michael. Like I was trying to read a bitcoin block explorer to check out where the US government was sending the bitcoin.
00:44:39.632 - 00:44:44.104, Speaker E: I just was like, man, I cannot make heads or tails of this anymore. This makes no sense at all.
00:44:44.224 - 00:44:47.768, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you ever met. Met them? Have you ever met. Who is it Matthew who runs.
00:44:47.816 - 00:44:48.684, Speaker E: Ever met him?
00:44:50.304 - 00:44:54.944, Speaker B: You could imagine a coin market cap like exit for them in the next cycle.
00:44:55.844 - 00:44:58.424, Speaker C: Coingecko is a great. They have a great story.
00:44:59.604 - 00:45:01.828, Speaker B: Bobby, shout out. Yeah.
00:45:01.956 - 00:45:08.564, Speaker C: What is the business model for the block explorers? How do they monetize ads, I think ads? Yeah.
00:45:08.644 - 00:45:23.752, Speaker B: So if you go to it and you click exchange, like right now, you click exchange and it's sponsored by or play, you get like meta win or coins game. And this is all an automated business, so they don't have a sales team, at least as my understanding.
00:45:23.848 - 00:45:28.400, Speaker E: They make money doing the l two s block explorers too, right? Like Enb scan and op.
00:45:28.472 - 00:45:28.984, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:45:29.064 - 00:45:30.896, Speaker E: Oh, Arbiscan. And there's.
00:45:30.960 - 00:45:31.768, Speaker C: I don't know how.
00:45:31.896 - 00:45:35.752, Speaker E: I think there's like a two year waitlist for getting them to do your blockchain too.
00:45:35.928 - 00:45:38.024, Speaker D: I don't know how recurring that.
00:45:38.144 - 00:45:44.184, Speaker C: Yeah, that's not recurring, but hefty price tag. I've had. I've heard it's accurate.
00:45:44.304 - 00:45:44.896, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:45.040 - 00:46:12.064, Speaker E: Very, very expensive. I think broadly, it's like, when are we. ETH prescriptions aside, when are we going to get the NFT people reactivated? I feel like of all the crypto folks, they've just been destroyed. Eminem sold his board ape today. It's June 22, 2023. Looking like there's some outstanding loans on some board apes right around the floor price right now on bend out.
00:46:13.024 - 00:46:14.440, Speaker B: Eminem. That was bad.
00:46:14.552 - 00:46:33.204, Speaker E: I know you need to get these people reactivated. I don't know why that could be, but I remember it was like 2019, 2020, there was really no activity on nfts. And then 2021, it was all of a sudden like, punks are worth half a million dollars each. Do we think that's going to happen again?
00:46:33.944 - 00:47:07.206, Speaker D: I was with a fund manager yesterday who has a lot of similar perspectives as we do. One of the theses that he had was it might be the right time to start buying punks. We were also talking with another manager in the space and one of their pretty strong theses, and I think they've already been deploying into it, is buying nfts. There's an element here where it gets so low and potentially attractive that it might become a good investment category.
00:47:07.390 - 00:47:09.166, Speaker B: What, buying nfts again, you're saying?
00:47:09.310 - 00:47:09.950, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:10.102 - 00:47:12.062, Speaker B: Can you guys buy nfts in the fund?
00:47:12.238 - 00:47:17.894, Speaker E: Yeah, we can. We haven't at what price would punks.
00:47:17.934 - 00:47:19.914, Speaker B: Have to go to to buy some punks?
00:47:20.534 - 00:47:33.222, Speaker D: It depends on how you have to underwrite it. And are you looking at it from like, a individual asset class perspective? And is there some, like, value or utility from that specific NFT? Or are you looking at this basically as like a levered ETH play?
00:47:33.398 - 00:47:44.714, Speaker B: No value, no utility. Punk specifically, I said punks because there's no utility. Like, there's no game that's being created around punks. It's just a number go up and it's probably a leopard ETH play.
00:47:45.174 - 00:47:48.990, Speaker D: I don't know if they're. I don't know if we could talk about what price would buy.
00:47:49.182 - 00:47:53.798, Speaker E: Yeah, we can't talk about any of that, but just looking at punks right now, it's 49.
00:47:53.966 - 00:47:55.646, Speaker B: 49, yeah.
00:47:55.750 - 00:48:16.964, Speaker E: So the total market cap is 491,000 ETH. And ETH is at 2000. Call it so times ten, 4.9, times 1049. Like, this is like, what, 2 billion market cap, something like that. Let me do that math.
00:48:20.144 - 00:48:25.080, Speaker C: Remember when you and I said we were definitely going to buy punks when they went down, Mike and I, top.
00:48:25.112 - 00:48:29.036, Speaker B: Of the market, we're like, if we ever get into a deep bear market, we're definitely buying punks.
00:48:29.160 - 00:48:31.468, Speaker C: Here we are into another.
00:48:31.556 - 00:48:31.732, Speaker B: So.
00:48:31.748 - 00:48:41.084, Speaker E: So punks has a $1 billion market cap aggregate. That's how I think about it. But there's no, there's no utility, right? There's no fees, there's no anything like that.
00:48:41.124 - 00:48:42.464, Speaker B: So that's why they're valuable.
00:48:43.844 - 00:48:53.828, Speaker C: I mean, do it looked like utility was trouncing that? This is digital art for a little while, but I don't know, I kind of think it's. It maybe isn't one size fits all.
00:48:53.876 - 00:49:06.044, Speaker B: Second you add utility, people start trying to make an equation out of it. Where you have the utility on one side, is it greater than or less than the price? I mean, you got to be a.
00:49:06.084 - 00:49:09.384, Speaker D: Pure revenue, pure play, pre revenue, pure play.
00:49:09.724 - 00:49:11.668, Speaker E: The crazy part about punk, that, like.
00:49:11.716 - 00:49:16.104, Speaker B: Number up chart, no excel, no excel, no revenue.
00:49:17.764 - 00:49:44.224, Speaker E: The craziest part about punks is that, like, blur kind of like, farmed the farmers in many ways, where someone on March 17 sold 800 punks into blur bidding liquidity at once. Like, I don't know when the market changes that dramatically in terms of volume and liquidity, I at least want to wait till, like, re underwrite things.
00:49:45.644 - 00:49:48.940, Speaker C: Could you explain what you mean by farm? The farmers? Yeah.
00:49:48.972 - 00:50:21.234, Speaker E: So all of these farmers were paid in blur points to basically bid nfts meanwhile, the people who were selling nfts were actually the biggest net beneficiaries. And you have this two sided liquidity that has never happened before. And so who are the winners? Probably the sellers of NFT, but also the protocol that got this artificial bid liquidity. And the losers were the people who bought. So big brother Machi folks like that just got torn up and lost a bunch of ETH in the process.
00:50:22.484 - 00:50:23.340, Speaker B: The. I don't.
00:50:23.372 - 00:50:27.504, Speaker C: Have you guys ever heard the Djen Spartan line on sushi swap?
00:50:28.324 - 00:50:29.064, Speaker E: No.
00:50:30.444 - 00:51:16.722, Speaker C: So he, this was an uncommon core episode he did a while ago with Hasu. But I did actually see he made the comparison between blend and sushi, which was basically one of the reasons why defi coins topped around the same time as Sushiswap is the incentives were so strong on sushi that they pulled so much liquidity to one place that if you held these kind of illiquid defi coins, your entire incentive there was to sell. And kind of a similar comparison can be made to blur. Whereas you might think something is super bullish because you're pulling a bunch of liquidity to one venue, but if you're a long term bag holder of these things, there's an attractive price. You're incentivizing everyone to dump at the same time so that your options to.
00:51:16.738 - 00:51:45.408, Speaker E: Liquidate NFTs at scale are like, you get this sotheby's sponsored grail type sale, or you sell into blur. I mean, maybe it is like a decent time to buy nfts, but calling them levered ETH feels very specious. That implies it has both the fundamentals of ETH and then this other thing. I don't know, maybe we're just too two right and left curves simultaneously to be part of this new generation of DJ's.
00:51:45.456 - 00:51:47.704, Speaker D: But wouldn't that put us mid curve?
00:51:47.824 - 00:51:48.456, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean.
00:51:48.520 - 00:51:50.484, Speaker C: I mean, right in the middle worked well so far.
00:51:52.824 - 00:52:02.776, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I. I completely agree. The only other argument is that depending on the tax situation, NFTs will probably take a more favorable regulatory perspective.
00:52:02.880 - 00:52:11.734, Speaker C: What do you guys think? I know we're, we're running short on time here, but did you see that BNB is using the op stack to launch a L2?
00:52:12.154 - 00:52:14.050, Speaker E: It seems like the, there's a.
00:52:14.082 - 00:52:24.826, Speaker C: Like Zora was another NFT marketplace that announced that they were launching using op stack. It feels like there's some traction that's at least just my sort of just looking at it.
00:52:24.850 - 00:52:25.530, Speaker D: Perception.
00:52:25.642 - 00:52:39.554, Speaker C: And more and more protocols are using that. Do you guys. Is that your perception as well. I gotta be honest, I haven't really looked into the binance like the BNB using op stack, but it seems like there's some critical mass that's gaining there.
00:52:39.934 - 00:53:04.250, Speaker E: Doesn't make sense to me to build an l two on a centralized l one with a permission validator set, you can literally have any scalability you want, just like l two s are just probably new opportunity to launch a token, frankly, and as we've talked about, the lowest effort thing that has the highest market cap return will get launched a lot. Until that. Until there's so many of them that they're all worth nothing. Enter all of the uniswap clones from 2021.
00:53:04.322 - 00:53:06.094, Speaker B: Very well said, rip.
00:53:07.674 - 00:53:41.594, Speaker E: Aside from, like, you know, the l two s on binance and all that stuff, or BNB, the thing I would like to see in this bear market, I would like to see CZ and Brian kind of bury the hatchet come together. You're literally the two last men standing. I feel like there's been a lot of beef between those two obviously very different regulatory approaches and probably viewpoints of the world as well. But, like, we're going to have this, like, tradfi carving up of, like, coinbases business. I feel like, a little bit like it would be good to see them get on the same page, you know, more so than they have been historically.
00:53:44.774 - 00:53:47.022, Speaker B: Good luck with that. Me too. I'd like to.
00:53:47.158 - 00:54:01.492, Speaker E: Yeah, we got to bring the tribes together. Even bitcoin. Like, we don't hold a lot of bitcoin, but, like, respect the pump. As Ivan on tech once said, you know, you gotta respect the pump. You gotta be there for the other folks. There's not many of us left.
00:54:01.548 - 00:54:03.380, Speaker B: And Jaz, as Ivan on tech once.
00:54:03.412 - 00:54:13.824, Speaker E: Said, I used to watch those streams. It was so bizarre watching him turn into, like, a tech explainer to, like, a guy who pumps coins. But, like, I. That line that he said is just a classic, and it's true.
00:54:15.724 - 00:54:25.494, Speaker B: One day we'll tell you about our influencer business that we created in the bottom of the bear market. But leaving that for another time, we don't.
00:54:25.534 - 00:54:27.326, Speaker C: I would love to just never talk about that again.
00:54:27.390 - 00:54:29.434, Speaker B: We do streamers.
00:54:31.294 - 00:54:32.834, Speaker E: It's been growth business.
00:54:33.894 - 00:54:37.234, Speaker B: Yeah, that was chaos. Anything else this week, guys?
00:54:38.254 - 00:54:46.430, Speaker D: Um, well, no submarines for anybody soon, please.
00:54:46.622 - 00:54:49.526, Speaker B: Yeah, man. So you need to go bad for.
00:54:49.550 - 00:54:54.334, Speaker C: Those people at the people were, like, mocking the people in the submarine. That made no sense to me.
00:54:54.374 - 00:54:57.230, Speaker D: Like, totally terrible, terrible way to get.
00:54:57.382 - 00:55:01.110, Speaker C: For people that are trapped at the bottom of the ocean. Like, yeah, well, it sounds.
00:55:01.142 - 00:55:06.758, Speaker D: It sounds like it wasn't really trapped. It happened very fast, but crazy story nonetheless.
00:55:06.926 - 00:55:08.350, Speaker E: No submarines for anybody.
00:55:08.422 - 00:55:08.854, Speaker C: All right?
00:55:08.934 - 00:55:09.694, Speaker B: It's a good way to end it.
