00:00:00.360 - 00:00:27.852, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about Core later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got the weekly roundup coming at you. Santee is traveling right now. So we got two sub ins, we got the a list, we got the a squad coming to the table today. We got Dan Smith and Sam Martin, two absolute Degen research analysts from blockworks.
00:00:27.852 - 00:00:29.580, Speaker A: Dan, Sam, welcome to the show, guys.
00:00:29.692 - 00:00:30.796, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:00:30.900 - 00:00:31.964, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate it.
00:00:32.084 - 00:01:07.406, Speaker A: Of course, first thing first, we're talking about OFAC and censorship issues. Last week we talked about this on the roundup, too. We saw the US treasury add tornado cash to the OFAC list. USDC freezing related tokens, inferior alchemy, GitHub, Defi front ends and other providers began to censor the addresses. Crypto, Twitter and discords became flooded with debates around censorship risk. I think the first place that we should really start here is around validator censorship. So after the merge, just a reminder, after the merge, miners and mining pools get replaced by the validators who stake.
00:01:07.406 - 00:01:38.694, Speaker A: Right? And the most notable shift in power dynamics sits with the exchanges and the liquid staking pools that control a large percentage of staked ETH. And this has created this hot debate about ETH validators. Are they ofac compliant? Essentially? Are we bringing censorship to the Ethereum protocol base layer via these validators? So, Dan, Sam, I'm curious to get your guys take on what you're seeing. What are potential outcomes that are going to happen here? Dan, can I pick on you first?
00:01:38.854 - 00:01:59.394, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. There's definitely. This is a hot topic. Ethereum is kind of built around the premise of decentralization and defi set. The core tenant is anybody can transact. And OFAC has come in and basically said, that's not true. And you can't really argue with ofac if you're a centralized entity.
00:01:59.394 - 00:02:27.996, Speaker C: They kind of make the rules that you have to play by. And it's definitely kind of putting a weight on crypto, especially crypto Twitter. But I kind of have the opposite take here. All of crypto Twitter gets obsessed about certain things, as we know, and that becomes the discussion around everything. But the way I see this playing out is kind of three different scenarios. So you have two on either end of the spectrum and one in the middle. So case one is regulation comes in.
00:02:27.996 - 00:03:33.394, Speaker C: OfaC says you can't transact with these blacklisted addresses, and that essentially kills d five, everything goes to zero. And in that scenario, you know, what are we going to do about it? It's going to be like a legal regulatory, lawyer based battle that probably puts a significant time, like a multi year depression, onto the Defi ecosystem that puts extreme negative pressure on asset prices. And in that case, why are we wasting time getting bogged down by this and not focusing on some of the exciting developments that are occurring? So that's this one bad scenario. In the great scenario, nothing ends up coming of this. The regulations don't weigh on defi the way we think they're going to. And in that case, everything keeps chugging along as is. Again, why are we getting bogged down by this? And then you have this like scenario in the middle where there are the regulation, regulatory OFAC rules come in and say, yeah, you can't do this, we're not going to let this happen.
00:03:33.394 - 00:04:16.194, Speaker C: But instead of sending everything to zero, legitimate forks of ethereum that become viable. So you have the proof of stake Ethereum, that is Ofac compliance. And you know, this is probably where the large smart money would end up thinking like hedge funds or new entities that are coming into this, into this institutional money, basically. And that's where they would go end up playing. And then you'd have another chain that's the same proof of stake Ethereum that's not ofac compliant. So I'm thinking this would be like a djen playground, basically. You can't really be bringing legitimate money, like smart money, institutional money over here because they have to comply by the rules.
00:04:16.194 - 00:05:00.298, Speaker C: But there are decentralized entities that don't, that believe that they don't have to play by these rules. So that fork will exist. But the question is, who's transacting over there? What's happening? What kind of protocols exist there? So you have two forks of proof of stake Ethereum, and then you also have the proof of work Ethereum still chugging along that fork. It would probably not be OFAC compliant as well. And you get into the situation of like, what does that look like? How does that operate? And so this is like this middle scenario. That's probably the most likely outcome in my mind at this stage. And proof of work Ethereum will be interesting because circle has already come out and said they're not going to support it.
00:05:00.298 - 00:05:40.402, Speaker C: I believe tether has done the same. So if there's no fiat stable coins there, which makes sense because they're trying to be these regulated entities, they are very centralized. So they do have to play by these, OFAC rules, then there's no like stable value on chain. So that essentially breaks all of DeFi, which currently runs around USDC and USDT. So that'll be interesting. I think you're going to see these rise in protocol algorithmic stable coins. Not necessarily things like fully algorithmic like Luna, but maybe there's some blend, like some fracs approach that instead of holding USDC and tether, they're holding maybe Mim or over collateralized stable coins.
00:05:40.402 - 00:06:02.044, Speaker C: Again, these are, we know these are harder to scale as over collateralized stablecoins just don't scale. But I think it's going to create this like, situation that kind of breeds around innovation, and I do think we're probably going to end up with, as it stands now, I believe we're going to be ending up with multiple ethereum forks that serve different purposes for different users.
00:06:02.584 - 00:06:28.264, Speaker A: All right, I'm going to try my best to break that down, to try to summarize that. And then, Sam, I want to get your take on this. Basically three scenarios here. You've got picture spectrum. On one end of the spectrum, OFAC comes down, really, really clamps down, tries to almost shut down a lot of defi activity. In that case, what can we really do? It becomes a massive years long legal battle. So almost, in your opinion, you're like, why are we even worrying about that? That's not something that we can.
00:06:28.264 - 00:07:20.936, Speaker A: Don't try to control the uncontrollables. On the other side of the spectrum. You're like, okay, OFAC maybe tries to sanction things like tornado cash, some deep kind of privacy tools, but most of the other things are fine, they kind of lay off and like, okay, Defi keeps running as usual. But maybe there's a more likely scenario which kind of sits in between these two scenarios, which is if regulatory, regulatorily compliant validators have a big enough percentage of the stake, then blocks by non censoring validators could be ignored, which would make the non censoring validators unprofitable. And this would result in this fork that would kind of separate the two validator sets. So you would end up having two different proof of stake ETH chains. One would be like an OFAC compliant chain, one would be like a total degen chain that's not OFAC compliant.
00:07:20.936 - 00:08:09.346, Speaker A: And then you would have a third chain, which looks like, we'll have this continue with the proof of work ETH chain. When you extend this out and try to think about where the space goes from here, you'd have all the money, would probably most of the institutional capital would flow into the proof of OFAC compliant proof of stake chain. The other two chains, I think the proof of work, one ends up dying, but teach their own the proof of stake ofac or like degen chain non ofac compliant. That's maybe where you'd get a bunch of like, experiments. You'd have to have like algo stables because circle will not, because USDC will not participate in that chain. So that's where you'd probably get a bunch of the degen activity. And then maybe once they evolve past, it's almost like a testnet.
00:08:09.346 - 00:08:22.614, Speaker A: It's like a new testnet. Once they realize, okay, this kind of djen, once a project realizes that it works, they maybe move on to the OFAC compliant proof of stake chain. Sam, what do you think about that?
00:08:23.714 - 00:08:54.407, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the whole situation is just unfortunate. Like, I'm no OFAC expert, but I mean, I've just been really excited about the merge for a long time now. And it's like a bullish catalyst, obviously. And it's unfortunate that it's being kind of overshadowed by all this stuff. And I can't even imagine being like a retail investor and trying to understand all this and how it pans out. So I think that is a bearish slant on an otherwise a bullish development with the merge. But, yeah, I mean, there's just two big parts of this equation.
00:08:54.407 - 00:09:39.936, Speaker B: Obviously, you've got probably 75% of the validator set. The node operators are lido, and then big centralized exchanges. So it's like, where are they going to choose to validate? Are they going to censor or are they not going to censor? And then you've also got the stable coin issuers. That's a huge piece of the equation, because like Dan alluded to, you need a stable store of value to be able to trade back into in order to actually, like, facilitate, like, efficient activity. So, yeah, we'll see where people choose and where they stand on which side of the line. But I saw Brian Armstrong tweeted the other day about how he would, you know, seize the staking business if he had to support the censored chain. I don't know if that's all talk.
00:09:39.936 - 00:10:03.844, Speaker B: I mean, even legally speaking, he should be looking out for the best interest of his shareholders. So I don't know how he'd even be allowed to do that, but that'll be interesting to watch pan out. And I think Jeremy Allaire, the CEO and founder of Circle, hasn't, hasn't said anything about it, at least not that I've seen. But you'd have to imagine they'd choose the. The OFAC compliant fork. So it's going to be interesting to watch pan out. But I'm excited.
00:10:03.924 - 00:10:38.734, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you have like a fiduciary duty to your shareholders to do, to follow the US sanctions, obviously, but then you have almost this inherent duty that doesn't, doesn't really exist, actually, if you think about it in any other industry, to like follow the decentralization and like follow the. It's the crypto ethos, right. It's like the. I dont know, you dont want to just bend the knee, basically, and just recreate the traditional financial system. So. Yeah, Sam, I saw that same tweet is 66% of the beacon chain validators. Who is it? Lido, Coinbase, Kraken.
00:10:38.734 - 00:11:25.194, Speaker A: Whos this other one? Staked and bitcoin Suisse make up over 65% of staked ETH regulators. Come to them, they ask them to censor at the ETH protocol level with their validators. The big question becomes a, do they comply and sensor at the protocol level? Or B, do they shut down their staking service and preserve network integrity and lose the revenue that they generate from the staking services? So, yeah, Brian said it's a hypothetical we hopefully won't face, but if we did, we think we'd go with b, shut down the staking service and preserve network integrity. But he said there may be some better option, which is option c, a legal challenge. And that's what Dan's kind of talking about, which is like, look, who knows? If they really come down, it's just going to end up with the lawyers. So.
00:11:25.274 - 00:11:43.534, Speaker C: Yeah, and government moves so slow that, and it's. It'll be super frustrating to go through that. And this is obviously an unprecedented battle that would be occurring. So I can't imagine the years that that would take to actually get a true resolution for either. So I'm curious why you think the proof of work chain will just die.
00:11:44.454 - 00:11:46.354, Speaker A: Who's going to build on the proof of work chain?
00:11:47.574 - 00:12:31.524, Speaker C: Fair point, but I think the interesting thing about this fork, rather than like the Ethereum classic fork, is there's so many protocols that are, that exist now. Like when Ethereum classic fork, there was the only thing that was built was essentially the DAO. And now you have hundreds of Defi protocols that are like, if the blocks are being minted or blocks are being mined, then you're still going to get these systems that are like organisms now, like they're going to keep producing. So let's put in an example. So curve emits crv tokens with every new block. And that's going to still occur on the proof of work chain as long as new blocks are being mined. And so if curve has any value at all, like even $0.01,
00:12:31.524 - 00:12:58.484, Speaker C: then these tokens will have value that people will be chasing after. So I feel like while you're totally, I totally agree that why would you build over there? If you're a new project, your market is exponentially smaller most likely, but it's just going to be like this weird D gen playground again. That's like these systems will still be operating and it's like this massive experiment. It's like building in prod, really. It'll be interesting.
00:12:59.464 - 00:13:02.604, Speaker A: Let's think about it this way. Who wants to keep a proof of work chain?
00:13:03.144 - 00:13:12.126, Speaker C: I'd ask you that, Dan Miners, because if the proof of work ethereum has any value at all, then they can still generate a profit, right?
00:13:12.270 - 00:13:52.480, Speaker A: So the miners want to keep this chain going. But who, where does the, why does value accrue to ETH? And where does the why, why does, why do users do anything on ETH? It's because developers and builders build really cool projects. They are going to want to build everything on this new proof of stake chain. I would assume so. I think that like, I mean ETH, whatever you want to call it, like ETH one will probably continue to exist because of support from the miners. And I think like Defi protocols and exchanges and devs are going to need to deal with that. But I feel like you're going to have, yeah, almost like these black markets emerge or like, yeah, you called it like these D gen corners.
00:13:52.480 - 00:14:21.184, Speaker A: Probably these like black markets will develop on the proof of work chain where like there's just, yeah, I don't know. I mean, maybe, what about this? What if there's a maybe, maybe the NFT market really develops on ETH one because like would you rather have. I actually am realizing as I speak, say this out loud, I don't fully understand how it works. Like will you have a crypto punk? Like let's use punks. For example, will there be a punk on ETH, on the ETH proof of work chain and on the ETH proof of stake chain?
00:14:22.204 - 00:14:29.256, Speaker B: Yeah, there will be, which makes it really interesting because technically the proof of work chain is, you know, the original, but.
00:14:29.400 - 00:14:37.444, Speaker A: Right. So like let's use punks. Do you want to, do you want to own the new punk that's been around for two weeks, or do you want to own the punk that's been around for five years?
00:14:38.984 - 00:14:42.472, Speaker C: You want the one with social consensus, right?
00:14:42.608 - 00:14:43.216, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:43.360 - 00:15:14.620, Speaker B: So I will say, though, I think the OFAC stuff does kind of make proof of work ETH more of an insurance policy. You know, like, we. We know that it works, and if, you know, everything just hits the fan, then, you know, you could always migrate back to the proof of work chain. So I do think that the OFAC drama does provide ETH proof of work with a little bit more of a built in insurance value. So I think it'll hold some value. But I agree. Social consensus around nfts, you know, all the stable coin issues, issuers are going to support proof of stake.
00:15:14.620 - 00:15:18.624, Speaker B: Like, that's where the value will be. But I do think there's a little bit of value left in ETH proof of work.
00:15:19.524 - 00:15:49.088, Speaker A: Do you guys remember the bitcoin forks? You guys remember bitcoin cash? And then bitcoin Sv, which was the fork of bitcoin cash. Ultimately, they just become these ghostlands, and it, like, I don't know, that's. I'm probably basing this off of. Off of all of what happened just with bitcoin and watching that, and, like, the forks seem like such a massive distraction, but, yeah, we'll see. Cool. Let's talk flashbots controversy. This kind of the OFAC controversy basically fled into the flashbot software.
00:15:49.088 - 00:16:32.110, Speaker A: For those who don't know flashbots, we're doing an app with them next week. It's going to be really, really good. You guys should listen to that. But flashbots is the kind of de facto Mev software that is leveraged by, it's like, 80 or 90% of miners. Today, it was reported that the Flashbots RPC had the OFAC list hard coded into the software, meaning that non compliant transactions would be disallowed at the client level, not just on the front end, as we see with a lot of DeFi protocols like Uniswap and AavE and things like that. On Wednesday, flashbots announced that they're open sourcing the mev boost relayer. So rather than a single default, what this does is it encourages competition, it reduces single points of failure.
00:16:32.110 - 00:16:39.598, Speaker A: Huge move by the flashbots team. Really, really loved this move. Dan, what do you think about this one?
00:16:39.766 - 00:17:45.384, Speaker C: This is sort of the justification for my thesis that you'll see a fork between proof of stake Ethereum for Ofac compliance and non OFAC compliance. I mean, this is a centralized entity that they, again, they have to be OFAC compliant. They don't really have an option here. And, I mean, you could argue that this is like a bullish catalyst for ETH, because it's a path towards regulatory compliance, and protocols can be built on OFAC ETH that don't have to worry about this issue. For example, Uniswap has been debating the fee swap for how long now, and they're turning it on now. But I think there's some back room thoughts with the Uniswap's labs team, and they're like, we really want to set up the foundation before we get this v switch going, or else this looks a lot like a security. So I think kind of more on that end of things, that having an OFAC compliant chain would probably get some favorable views from regulatory bodies, and I think that adds a lot of value there.
00:17:45.384 - 00:18:03.948, Speaker C: But again, you know, I don't think people, like, people are acting super surprised that centralized entities are now becoming, like, acting, like, kind of showing their true colors and being regulatory compliant, even though there was all the decentralization talk, but in reality, they really have no choice.
00:18:04.076 - 00:18:44.948, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's not by accident that flashbots open source the relayer code, so that way someone could fork it and essentially make a non OFAC compliant one, because they're just. Wherever they're located, they're bound by regulatory authorities to comply, which makes sense. And they clearly stated, this is a work in progress. Beware. This is a code base that is definitely changing a lot more from now until the merge, and I think there was just a worry on whether other solutions would be available by the time the merge actually was completed. So they just wanted to get it out there so people could start building on it and making sure that there's a non OFAC compliant alternative.
00:18:45.076 - 00:19:01.804, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I think this is a legendary move by flashbots. I think this ends up setting a standard for the industry. I think what a lot of folks have done is basically followed what Uniswap did, which is they make the. They make the front end what it. Shoot, what did uniswap do? Like, a year ago, they made the front end compliant, and then.
00:19:01.804 - 00:19:17.982, Speaker A: But you can't touch the protocol, and then you basically race to exit to the community through a dao and a foundation and things like that. I think a lot of folks have taken that playbook from Uniswap, but I am hopeful that a lot of people take the flashbots playbook. It'd be really interesting to see.
00:19:18.118 - 00:19:19.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree with that.
00:19:19.974 - 00:19:47.332, Speaker A: I think it's a reminder that, a good reminder of just how centralized a lot of crypto still is. Masari had this good tweet. Three major cloud providers are responsible for 69% of the 65% of Ethereum nodes hosted in data centers. Of the estimated 95% of Solana nodes hosted in data centers, 72% are hosted with the same cloud provider as Ethereum. Dan, concerning, no, you don't really care about that.
00:19:47.468 - 00:20:37.264, Speaker C: Decentralization is super important and I really want that to be the end result. But people forget that. You can't just start there, to me, decentralized something, decentralization is something you work towards and end up at, rather than begin at and maintain. And perfect example of that is launching DeFi protocols. There's generally two to eight core devs say that are building this product and the community has input, but there's not like the community is the one building the actual upgrades to the protocol, for example. And it's the race to decentralization. I think that people have understood that at the protocol level, but at the base layer that sometimes gets like over, there's oversight at the base layer and people are just assumed decentralization.
00:20:37.264 - 00:20:47.004, Speaker C: But yeah, I really see that an end goal that we have is a decentralized general purpose smart contract platform in Ethereum.
00:20:47.124 - 00:21:24.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I've always just kind of thought of scalability not just as like transaction throughput, but also like transaction throughput in conjunction with like the cost to validate. So like if, if, you know, if we do get an OFAC compliant ethereum, then it's like I might as well just be using Solana and like the entire Ethereum roadmap doesn't even make sense anymore because it's just, it's censored. So, so yeah, I don't know. I really hope that we'll be able to get past it, and I believe that we will because the social consensus of the Ethereum community, just everyone believes that we should have non censorship at the base layer.
00:21:24.602 - 00:21:46.788, Speaker A: Alright folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're gonna be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions, they feel clunky, they feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core.
00:21:46.788 - 00:22:20.602, Speaker A: It's a free non custodial browser extension that gives Avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet. It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now.
00:22:20.602 - 00:22:49.758, Speaker A: Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to Avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes unwrapping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes it's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below.
00:22:49.758 - 00:22:56.758, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show. Sam, you're writing a big piece on Sudo swap. Yeah. When does that come out?
00:22:56.846 - 00:22:59.430, Speaker B: Yeah, that should be coming out a week from today.
00:22:59.582 - 00:23:00.198, Speaker A: Cool.
00:23:00.326 - 00:23:44.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it. Sudo swap's like super, super interesting. The first iteration of it was like an OTC service that just enabled users to swap nfts with other users without any fees. But last month they launched an on chain NFT AMM that basically lets users buy and sell nfts in a really gas efficient manner. And also it requires less position management through customizable bonding curves. So basically users can lp single sided with nfts or ETH to basically set a buy order or a sell order on an NFT. Or like, you know, so dollar cost averaging into nfts or dollar cost averaging out of nfts into ETH.
00:23:44.494 - 00:24:19.714, Speaker B: And then also you can provide liquidity on both sides and set the parameters of a customizable bonding curve, which can be like linear, where there's a delta. So let's say I have ten nfts and I set the delta at 0.1. Then every time an NFT is bought or sold, the price either increases or decreases by 0.1 ETH. That's really nice because if anyone's used opensea and they're trying to adjust their listings to floor, that's a lot of management. It can require a lot of gas to list all the nfts individually. But then sudo swap lets you do it all in one go and automate the curve.
00:24:19.714 - 00:25:03.630, Speaker B: You've seen projects like NFTx try and do the same thing, but the problem is there's a lot of friction and the nfts end up getting fractionalized. And they're also using like an xy k curve. So the slippage is just really, really bad and it's exacerbated like within pools. Like if there's only ten ETH and ten NFts in the pool, then your slippage is going to be like over 10% and even a perfectly balanced pool. So the customizable bonding curve kind of makes the slippage constant for the buyers and sellers. And yeah, it's just, it's pretty revolutionary in the terms of nfts. It's definitely the financialization of them.
00:25:03.630 - 00:25:16.074, Speaker B: You know, some people aren't super happy with it because it forgoes the royalties that opensea traders and looksrare provide. But yeah, it's interesting to watch it all pan out.
00:25:16.454 - 00:25:50.376, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that, Sam. I think, I mean this. So I was never into nfts in the beginning of crypto. I saw them, I paid attention to them, but trading them was just never something that got me going. I came into crypto from more of the finance side. So Defi was super interesting, probably because it was something I understood a little bit more and probably more so because of how poorly the nfts I did purchase performed. But Sudaswap feels like a zero to one for me when I use the UI.
00:25:50.376 - 00:26:53.184, Speaker C: It's obviously news and a little glitchy here and there, but using it feels like a great experience. This is like it's created a new mechanism in nfts and it's been pretty refreshing for me. And one thing that I find super interesting is I've seen projects using pseudoswap to essentially create a minting feature for their NFTs. So without using Sudoswap, the project would host a website that users would go on to connect your wallet and mint an NFT, which was a pretty sketchy experience for me. I really hate connecting a hot wallet to random websites. But projects have been instead of minting them out through this website to individual users, the project itself will mint the entire supply of the nfts and then put them into a pseudoswap pool where users can then go and swap ETH for the nfts. And so that allows the user to interface with one trusted website in Sudoswap and still get this minting experience.
00:26:53.184 - 00:27:40.044, Speaker C: And so a couple different projects have been experimenting with this and a lot of that has gone pretty well and pretty poorly. Like, we've seen it all over the map. But Pseudonauts is a project that recently did this and it was like a pretty interesting experience and they had pretty great success. They noted that it kind of this style, like reduced reveal volatility. So when the project reveals, a lot of people who've been trading nfts on Opensea know that when reveal happens, you're either getting a zero or a five x right there. But that wasn't really the case with this project. And it kind of remains to be seen if that's more of a project specific thing or if a lot of this had to do with the fact that they used sudoswap as this minting feature.
00:27:43.664 - 00:28:00.984, Speaker A: I actually don't think I'm fully getting why pseudoswap is so interesting, I'll be honest. Like you said, you got a zero to one moment. So I'm on pseudo swap for anyone watching on YouTube. Dan, Sam, can you see my screen? Yes, you can see this. All right, so I'll pull up the best collection in crypto. Crypto dick butts. 1D equals one b.
00:28:00.984 - 00:28:12.244, Speaker A: And we've got this. It just looks kind of like opensea with less stuff you can do. But what am I missing here?
00:28:12.404 - 00:28:29.548, Speaker B: Yeah, so if you scroll up to the top, you see how there's the best offer. So, you know, let's say I need three grand for a car repair in real life, you can go into this pool and instantly sell that NFT for that best offer, which is really advantageous in itself. And then the offer TvL oh, so.
00:28:29.556 - 00:28:32.100, Speaker A: You'Ve basically got a limit. You can do like limit orders on here.
00:28:32.212 - 00:28:47.684, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And so that's the, that's an example of someone providing basically ETH at a certain buy price for this NFT collection. And I know that there's been a lot of arbitrage going on too between.
00:28:47.804 - 00:28:51.780, Speaker A: This is the offer for the entire collection, you're saying that's the amount of.
00:28:51.812 - 00:29:06.348, Speaker B: ETH that is in a position to offer. So people in an offer at 2.848 probably have like a delta setup. And basically as this order gets filled, the next order will be lower and lower and then lower.
00:29:06.396 - 00:29:24.684, Speaker A: And so there's only two apes on this entire thing. So you have to. It says two, but I don't even see any here. Or let's say Azuki. There's 30 azukis on here. So you basically go to Sudo swap and you list your zookees on here directly. It's not like gem.
00:29:24.684 - 00:29:34.424, Speaker A: It's not like gem, right, where it'll pull in. What exists on gem is basically the exact same stuff that exists on OpenSeA. For pseudoswap, you'd have to go list your stuff here directly.
00:29:34.764 - 00:29:51.432, Speaker B: Yeah, you put it into a pool and then if someone selects your NFT that's in the pool and purchases it, then the price will increase based on that pool's parameters. So at 6.5, if the delta on a linear curve is 0.2, then the next one's going to sell for 6.7.
00:29:51.608 - 00:30:19.458, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, you guys aren't alone and think this is really cool, right? If the dune stats are right, pseudoswap has 16% of the market share versus Opensea after less than one month of launching. This was this guy zero x wingarian. He tweeted past 24 hours. Opensea did 14 million in volume. Sudo did 2 million in volume, about 15% of the market share. As he said, this is probably the most exciting application to hit the market in 2022 as traction is completely unincentivized.
00:30:19.458 - 00:30:21.106, Speaker A: Dan, you agree with that take?
00:30:21.250 - 00:30:49.960, Speaker C: I do. And there's more innovation that's yet to come for sudo swap. Right now you can only pool NFTs alongside ETH, but in the future you're going to be able to pool NFTs with other NFTs as well as any ERC 20 token. So that's when things start to get way more in the weeds. That creates a lot of new opportunities and that's, again, another zero to one. So we don't really know what's to come out of that. But yeah, I do agree with that take.
00:30:49.960 - 00:30:53.800, Speaker C: Pseudoswap is a blast to use and it's been a fun experience so far.
00:30:53.872 - 00:31:01.288, Speaker A: Yeah, it's probably not completely unincentivized though, right? There's probably a bunch of people who are just airdrop hunting, but that's exactly.
00:31:01.376 - 00:31:10.904, Speaker C: The XMon token is a good reflection of that. There's links between the XMon token and pseudo swap. Pull up the Xmon chart, you'll see that people are definitely airdropping.
00:31:10.984 - 00:31:12.984, Speaker A: Say that again with Xmon. I don't get that.
00:31:13.144 - 00:31:28.576, Speaker C: There's like links that Exmon. The token is tied to sudo swap. And so like long Exmon would probably get some conversion to a sudo token. So Exmon holders would get a conversion to Sudo.
00:31:28.680 - 00:31:44.564, Speaker B: I heard Owen say to the founder of Sudo Swap say that he took some inspiration from cowswap for the airdrop design. So if anyone remembers that that's basically you want to trade some solid volume on pseudoswap to get the airdrop.
00:31:44.724 - 00:31:46.676, Speaker A: So are you two boat trading on pseudoswap?
00:31:46.820 - 00:31:50.228, Speaker C: Yes. Trading on pseudoswap? Yeah. For science.
00:31:50.316 - 00:32:07.232, Speaker A: Nice. For science. Yeah, exactly. For the research. Let me push back here. Why won't this, you guys remember looks rare? You guys remember looks? Um, by like the way this t shirt was blockwork swag pre looks coming out. The looks rare swag at our off site and then looks launched.
00:32:07.232 - 00:32:15.144, Speaker A: I was like, well, shit. So now everyone thinks I'm pumping looks. But why, so why, why won't this just look, look like looks and just get faded?
00:32:15.224 - 00:32:57.956, Speaker C: So I think looksir was a kind of had this issue where it was trying to essentially do the same thing as Opensea. Opensea is a giant, hard to compete with that. They had the revenue share, which was their diversification, I would say. But pseudoswap is something different. Like if you have a super rare NFT where the stats of the NFT actually matter, its traits, attributes, then you're probably not going to want to just throw that in a pseudo pool where someone can click it at the for price and buy it. But. So that's kind of why I think the, that's why like bored ape holders aren't going to be posting their board apes into this.
00:32:57.956 - 00:33:09.164, Speaker C: Unless you have like a floor board ape, then maybe toss it in to pseudoswap, see what happens. But yeah, so pseudoswap's really for more like priced nfts, if that makes sense.
00:33:09.324 - 00:33:16.704, Speaker B: Yeah, like land, it makes a lot of sense for like metaverse land because a lot of it, it's almost like fungible, non fungible tokens.
00:33:17.504 - 00:33:27.072, Speaker A: What if you guys were the head of product at Opensea? What would you do? And you see something like this launch, what would you do to compete with pseudoswap?
00:33:27.208 - 00:33:50.820, Speaker B: I would plug them in and use them as an aggregator so that way you're not losing everything. You know what I mean? Like didn't they acquire, was it Jim? Yeah, yeah, they acquired Gem. So I assume that's kind of like why they acquired gem. But yeah, I think that they should use gem to plug into pseudoswap to take advantage of the trading volume.
00:33:50.932 - 00:33:57.172, Speaker A: Let me rephrase it for you. Do you give it 18 months? Is Opensea the largest NFT marketplace in the world?
00:33:57.268 - 00:34:46.178, Speaker C: I'm still going to say yes, because if you go by volume, I think that these larger board apes sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars where what's selling on tutor swap right now are like 0.02 and for the most part, of course, there's like the dick butts going for three ETH, but most of them are like less than one ETH nfts. And right now it's still like, there's not any. It's mostly people just experimenting. I think real projects will get built and sold and hosted on Pseudoswap, but we are not there right now. And I still think that Opensea is the giant that has such a dominant market share. Like, a lot of people know what Opensea is and have no idea about anything of crypto.
00:34:46.178 - 00:35:13.714, Speaker C: And also with Sudoswap, there is a learning curve that you need to adapt to because it's incredibly complicated. It's not just like, oh, go in, click an NFT, place a bid, buy NFT. Well, I want to sell an NFt. All I have to do is list it, pick a number of the amount of ETH I want for it, and I can easily list it. It's super simple, super user friendly. I think Sudo swap is probably more for crypto native people that enjoy the experimentation.
00:35:14.614 - 00:35:38.396, Speaker B: I would take the other side of that. Honestly, Dan. I feel like most people in NFTs aren't really in it for the community or the creators. People are just trying to make a quick buck. So I would say I don't know if financialization of NFTs is a good thing, but I will say it's inevitable. I think degens are going to degenate. I would take OpenSea gets replaced as the top volume marketplace in the next 18 months.
00:35:38.580 - 00:35:39.744, Speaker A: By who? Sam?
00:35:40.284 - 00:35:46.344, Speaker B: I don't want to. I don't want to stick my name on a bet. I'm not sure. I guess I'll go with Sudo because I'm bullish on it.
00:35:47.284 - 00:36:06.018, Speaker A: All right, let's take the other side of Sudo. Let's talk about the other thing that's been in the conversation with Sudo, which is that they are not, they do not. So Sudo swap does not pay any royalties to creators on NFT trades. If you look at something like OpenseA, they pay on average like 5% to NFT issuers. On secondary sales. They keep an extra like 2.5%, I think, for themselves.
00:36:06.018 - 00:36:32.986, Speaker A: Sudo charges just, I think it's like 50 bps on trades and then those funds are sent to their treasury, not to creators. Obviously, the low fees on top of the liquidity pool structure has become really attractive for NFT traders. But if you're a creator or you're an artist, you probably feel a different way. Dan, thoughts on royalties pseudo swap, not. Not offering royalties?
00:36:33.170 - 00:37:31.854, Speaker C: Yeah, the annualists had this debate the other day, and royalties to creators was such a narrative for nfts during the bull run. And music, nfts were kind of spawned out of this royalty feature, but I don't know. So Muni tweeted the other day that essentially, why wouldn't NFT projects keep a portion of the supply for themselves and that becomes their royalties? Because if the NFTs do well, then the value of the NFTs that they keep would obviously increase as well, and that would kind of be your share or your profits as the creator. And then nfts really just start looking like ERC 20 tokens. And is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? I'm not sure. That kind of bleeds directly into the whole argument about how Kobe was saying NFTs are essentially just altcoins with pictures, which I wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly agree with. 99.9%
00:37:31.854 - 00:38:04.306, Speaker C: of them are. Of course, there are true innovations and there is real art that's being made, but that's just not what most nfts are. And especially on pseudoswap, there's no real art or no real meaning there. It is just all coins with pictures. So, yeah, I don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing that sudo swap's doing that. I think, you know, if you have the belief that royalty should go to creators, then you have the ability to use. The ability to use platforms that support that, like Opensea kind of kills the.
00:38:04.330 - 00:38:25.064, Speaker A: Narrative that this, like, enforceable royalties on chain is one of the best things about nfts. So it's a good reminder that those royalties are not enforced on chain. They're enforced by the marketplace. Who puts in the matching contract, or in this case, doesn't put the matching contract in. So. So you agree with, uh, you like Kobe's take?
00:38:25.644 - 00:38:52.128, Speaker C: I really do. I mean, that's just how I thought about nfts the whole time. That's mostly why I never really touched them. I was focused on, you know, what are actual innovations happening in Defi and why would I mess around with these dumb pictures? Basically, of course, you know, I've come around to it a bit. It is. It is fun, but, yeah, I really do. I think they're just all cleansed with pictures that essentially are just ERC 20 tokens that the dogecoin with the actual.
00:38:52.176 - 00:39:03.164, Speaker A: Doge on it feels like in it for the community is the 2022 version of 2018 in it for the tech? Let's Sam, any takes on this? You want to move past Sudo?
00:39:03.704 - 00:39:12.598, Speaker B: No, I would agree with everything Dan said. Keep a portion of the collection. You could even lp it to earn fees. Just echo everything Dan said.
00:39:12.696 - 00:39:26.370, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, we're going. We're pushing past my realm of understanding here. We're going into the Degen corner of the episode. I don't even know how to pronounce this thing, guys. Canto, canto. Permissionless general purpose blockchain running the evM.
00:39:26.370 - 00:39:34.034, Speaker A: I'm not even going to try to read these notes that you guys put up. Dan or Sam, who's taking this and why is this important enough to get included in this week's roundup?
00:39:34.154 - 00:39:39.414, Speaker B: I finally got my funds off Kanto and I haven't looked back since. So I'm going to hand this one to Dan.
00:39:40.314 - 00:40:06.708, Speaker C: I can take it. I can take the lead here. As Sam mentioned, the bridging experience is a little sketchy. So full disclosure, this is the edges of crypto innovation. But yeah, as you mentioned, Jason Kanto is a permissionless general purpose blockchain running the EVM. So the ethereum virtual machine, and it uses Cosmos SDK. So a good comparison here would be ethnos.
00:40:06.708 - 00:41:00.464, Speaker C: It's essentially a very similar model because Evmos is also running the Cosmos SDK, or built on the Cosmos SDK, and uses tendermint consensus for its proof of stake validation. So it's strong tech. Cosmos infrastructure is some of the best proof of stake infrastructure we have today. And the whole value proposition around Kanto is like free public infrastructure. So it's like core tenants, I would say our liquidity as a free public good. And so how it justifies this is there's a cantonical Dex that has zero trading fees for traders and LP's, which creates this strange scenario, right? Because if there's no trading fees, then LP's are earning nothing and therefore only exposing themselves to impermanent loss. So the way that that's mitigated is through liquidity mining incentives.
00:41:00.464 - 00:42:01.714, Speaker C: And so as mining rewards go to the LP's, then they kind of offset their impermanent loss and allows there to be liquidity at the base layer. But that kind of gets into the whole Ponzi scheme vibes because the only thing keeping LP's there are liquidity incentives. And if that's the case, then what happens if the token doesn't continue to appreciate? So a little bit suspect on how that's going to play out, but I think this is kind of just like a step one of like let's get the chain launched, let's get liquidity at the base layer and then let's build and innovate on top of that. And so backing up to like the whole broader view of what Kanto is. It's free public infrastructure. So it has a free canaconical bridge, Dex and lending platform and all of these have no fees associated with them. And gas fees on Kanto are incredibly low.
00:42:01.714 - 00:42:04.974, Speaker C: Like less than $0.01 basically.
00:42:05.094 - 00:42:28.084, Speaker A: But aren't they incredibly low because there's like 1000 wallets total, there's no one using. There's like 1500 transactions. I'm looking at a dune dashboard. There's like 1500 transactions total. By the way, I'm putting like the biggest. Not financial advice, like massive, like NFA huge stamp going on right now on the YouTube. And if we had some like sound alert thing going off on Spotify and Apple that we can figure out.
00:42:28.084 - 00:42:30.896, Speaker A: I'm putting that in like ten times.
00:42:30.960 - 00:42:34.304, Speaker C: Because 100% air horn sirens, the whole.
00:42:34.344 - 00:42:36.328, Speaker A: Bit, we need all of it.
00:42:36.456 - 00:42:53.618, Speaker C: The chain launched just to put a perspective of where we are in this thing. Like the chain launched a couple days ago and horrible experience. Almost nothing went right. But you know, that's, that's how it goes. It's a little sketchy still. There's almost no liquidity in this Dex. Right now I think there's like 100k.
00:42:53.618 - 00:43:23.684, Speaker C: So buying like $500 of Kanto or USDC or the native stable coin note, you're moving the market. I mean, it's ridiculous, but liquidity incentives do start today or tomorrow as that's, let me say that's going to start. That's the schedule. You never know. These things do get pushed back. That opens the door for people to actually bridge over money. That Dune dashboard you're looking at is the amount of money that's bridged from Ethereum mainnet to Kanto.
00:43:23.684 - 00:43:57.660, Speaker C: And it's probably on the order now of like maybe four or 5 million, I would guess so. Still, there's almost nobody here because the chain hasn't really officially launched yet. It's producing blocks and there are validators in the set, but there are still, there's no apps built on top of this. There's no like real use case. It's essentially just a new chain with an interesting value proposition that is like a testing in production experiment. So it's really, it's core tenant again. It's just, it's free public infrastructure.
00:43:57.660 - 00:44:48.054, Speaker C: So there's like no official foundation, no pre sale, no vesting contracts to investors. No venture backers, 13% of the supply went to the core contributors. So essentially the dev team 2% went to an airdrop to testnet users, and the other 85% is distributed to the community through liquidity incentives. I think about half of that is over the short term, so the first six months and half of that is then over the long term. So I'm not exactly bullish on it, to be honest, in the long term, just because it really revolves around these liquidity emissions. But that's not to say that this base layer, free public infrastructure won't get built on, and it is EVM compatible. So developers will be able to fork protocols on Ethereum over to Kanto.
00:44:48.054 - 00:45:07.284, Speaker C: And yeah, if you wanted a super bullish case scenario for it, Evmos is a multi billion dollar market cap, and this is quite similar to that, again, just with the modification of this free public infrastructure. But again, worst case scenario, probably, most likely scenario zero.
00:45:09.224 - 00:45:15.400, Speaker B: Is there a lock on those tokens for the founders, or are they able to farm and compound their ownership of the tokens?
00:45:15.512 - 00:45:53.498, Speaker C: That's actually a great point. So there is no lock, and they probably, I assume, would be farming. So there's staking rewards paid out to stakers with a 21 day unbonding period. So that's like staking to a validator, similar to how you would in many other proof of stake chains built on the Cosmos SDK. So it's delegated proof of stake and yeah, so it's sort of like that looks rare model where it looks like a very fair and distributed token distribution. But in reality, the core team will be able to use their tokens to farm these future liquidity incentives. And then they end up taking.
00:45:53.498 - 00:46:02.582, Speaker C: So they start with 13% of supply, but they're the ones collecting most of these liquidity mining incentives. And that then that 13% can grow quite quickly.
00:46:02.758 - 00:46:10.502, Speaker B: The main risk, in my opinion, is just making sure there's enough Ethan USDC liquidity to exit Kanto and actually get back to Ethereum.
00:46:10.558 - 00:46:39.578, Speaker A: If you had, is there the excellent liquidity there? Yeah, we're moving past Kanto. Big non financial advice, air horns, all that kind of good stuff. Last thing is actually real quick, how do you guys keep track of all of, like, when you're degenerating into Kanto and then you're coming at like, do you guys have, do you guys have your own like personal spreadsheets going on? Use like Zapper or Zurion? Like, I saw Nansen obviously acquired who they acquired like eight board or whatever three months ago. They just rolled out their portfolio tracker. How do you guys keep track of all this stuff?
00:46:39.746 - 00:46:43.094, Speaker B: I just spreadsheet it. I'm a spreadsheet warrior.
00:46:43.514 - 00:47:09.802, Speaker C: I'm also a spreadsheet warrior, but, and mostly because so things like eight boards, like, it's not going to have support for a lot of the DGN activity you take part in. Perfect examples. Canto that's going to. Canto have to actually be something before it gets support. But apeboard is great. I use that for all my Ethereum based transactions. They have bitcoin integration as well, and Solana integration is pretty good over there, too.
00:47:09.802 - 00:47:25.854, Speaker C: So a port is great. I would definitely recommend that for people looking to kind of keep track of multiple wallets at the same time, they do a great job. So even if you have tokens LP'd in say like a curve pool or uniswap pool, they will actually capture the value of those tokens as well, which is super cool.
00:47:26.274 - 00:47:58.294, Speaker A: Last thing I want to touch on here is just the regulations in Canada. There was this guy, Mo chains came out, kind of shared a screenshot that went viral of new canadian regulations that say you are only allowed to buy as much, you're allowed to buy as much bitcoin, ETH, litecoin, and bitcoin cash as you want. But any other crypto has a limit of $30,000, $30,000 net buy per year. Our director of research, Rashid, shared something on Twitter that made it look. I think it makes a. I think it's a little different than that, actually. It's.
00:47:58.294 - 00:48:29.050, Speaker A: It's per platform. So on different centralized exchanges, I think the real regulations say that if you're an accredited investor, there's no limit. If I'm reading this correctly, there's no limit. If you're an accredited investor, quote unquote, eligible investors can do up to 100,000, and then all other investors are $30,000. And those numbers are per platform is what it looks like. Rashid said, any takes on this one? I mean, this one just seems ridiculous in my mind, but I'm curious if you guys have a different take.
00:48:29.202 - 00:48:31.614, Speaker C: Totally agree. Yeah, go ahead, Sam.
00:48:32.514 - 00:48:54.218, Speaker B: It seems like just a nothing burger. I mean, you can use another exchange. It's not based in Canada and not regulated in Canada and completely get around it. Rashid was saying that he uses Kraken and he has no limitations. So, yeah, it seems like a lot more talk and like, fud on Twitter than actual material regulation, but, yeah, that's just my take on it.
00:48:54.266 - 00:48:58.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Would have to agree anything else, guys? Anything we're missing for this week's roundup?
00:48:59.954 - 00:49:25.846, Speaker C: That's pretty solid. I gotta give a shout out to Byron here, though. He had a great quote on the Canada thing this morning. And I think it probably is the biggest takeaway from this because it is just a silly rule in general. But he mentioned that. So essentially these rules were designed to ensure that investor protection. You only let them buy a certain amount of these tokens if they know, right.
00:49:25.846 - 00:49:52.052, Speaker C: If they're knowledgeable around crypto. And Brian had the great point that it's pretty funny. The people who think that bitcoin cash and litecoin should be eligible for unlimited purchases are also the same people telling you that you need to know more about crypto before you invest in it. It. I just don't understand that, you know, it's 2022 and there's a lot of people that know a lot about crypto and litecoin and bitcoin cash. They'll get like, get put in. This blue chip conversation is just pretty funny to me.
00:49:52.228 - 00:50:14.746, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it reminds me of who was it? I think the fed or I forget who it was. But one of the big, one of the big institutions, government institutions said anyone making policy on crypto is not allowed to hold crypto.
