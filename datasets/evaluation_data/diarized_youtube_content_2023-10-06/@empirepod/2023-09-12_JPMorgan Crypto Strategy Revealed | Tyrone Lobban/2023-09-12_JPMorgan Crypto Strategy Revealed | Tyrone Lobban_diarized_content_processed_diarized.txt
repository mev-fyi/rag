All right, everyone, welcome back to an episode of Empire. Super excited.
00:00:42.532 - 00:00:47.900, Speaker A: We have the head of blockchain and Onyx digital assets from JPMorgan, Tyron Lobbin. Welcome to the show.
00:00:47.932 - 00:00:51.468, Speaker B: Tyrone, thank you so much for having me. Super excited to be here.
00:00:51.556 - 00:01:16.380, Speaker A: Yeah, pumped about this. I think the best place to start this episode would actually just be very high level. And then we can go into some of the key things that you guys are working on. And I want to get the why behind what you guys are doing. So let's start with just what is Onyx and specifically like how big is this team? Why does it exist? Where in the organization? Right. JPMorgan's massive enterprise, where in the organization does your team sit? And then I think that can kick off this conversation.
00:01:16.572 - 00:01:55.302, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I realize that Onyx from the outside is probably the sort of nebulous, strange thing. And, you know, how does it actually relate to JPMorgan? It's actually a business unit within the bank. So we sit within our corporate and investment bank, which is where our markets business is. Our actual IB is as well, all of our payments operations, our payments front office, et cetera. So we sit within the CIB. We actually, for legacy reasons, sit within our payments organization, which is why we have such a strong payments angle to a lot of the work that we do within onnx. But it's really, especially from my perspective and the work that I do, cross firm.
00:01:55.302 - 00:02:32.992, Speaker B: So we don't just work with our CIB, we also work with our retail bank. So a chase within the US and more recently with our asset and wealth management group OnX is almost 300 people. We're about 275 people. That is made up of product engineering, operations, legal, really the gamut because it is a business. And so we have to ensure we're operating as such. And within Onnx, we actually have four business stripes, four sub businesses within the group. One of them is called Lenk.
00:02:32.992 - 00:03:15.144, Speaker B: So this is focused really on information flows and specifically around cross border payments. Then we have basically our value transfer business, which is JPMorgan coin systems. So you would have heard about JPMorgan coin, and we can talk a little bit about that. And then we have onyx digital assets, which is the platform that we have for tokenizing traditional assets. And then finally, our blockchain group, which is really everything to do with web3. We focus a lot within, what are the web3 innovations that are happening that we should be concentrating on as a bank and thinking about how we can be creating products around those specific solutions. So that's what it is.
00:03:15.144 - 00:04:26.394, Speaker B: I guess the other question is why? Why do we have this big group of people focused on these specific areas and blockchain as a technology? And that sort of goes back to when we started our blockchain group actually in 2015, just as a small group of people. It was really a handful focused on new products and emerging technology. And blockchain was one of the technologies that we were looking at at the time, late 2015, thinking about how it could be beneficial or disruptive to JPMorgan. And through that, we actually embarked on a whole program of experimentation, ideation, analysis on the different areas of finance that this tech can actually know. Either create real value for or completely change the way things are done. And so over the subsequent sort of seven years, I think we, we did something like 70 to 90 proofs of concepts, some of them, obviously, that didn't go anywhere. Many of them actually have informed the work that we do today, though.
00:04:26.394 - 00:04:40.880, Speaker B: And then in 2020, we actually decided that we had enough proof points that this tech was meaningful enough for us as a bank, that we needed to set up an entire business unit around it. And that was actually the creation of Onyx.
00:04:40.992 - 00:05:12.936, Speaker A: Yeah, the biggest shift that I've seen. I'm sure Santi remembers this, but I remember when you guys had quorum and Amber Balde was leading that. I think that was maybe 2017 or 2018, and that was basically a private blockchain, right. That was a fork of Ethereum. The biggest shift that I've seen JPMorgan take with your guys's crypto strategy, or blockchain strategy, is moving from a private blockchain to a public blockchain. Right now, you guys are actually building things and executing trades on Ethereum. Tell me about that shift from private to public and why that happened.
00:05:13.080 - 00:06:32.804, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I would say that it's an in flight sort of process, so we certainly haven't fully shifted to public blockchains. And in actual fact, the trade that you're referencing was the start of a journey for us that we really feel is the right trajectory in terms of moving towards public blockchains. But quite clearly, since the whole FTX debacle back end of last year, from a regulatory perspective, that has become somewhat challenging. So for now, our work is very centered in the permission blockchain space, and we do actually use quorum under the hood for our tokenization platform, onyx digital assets for our JPMorgan coin work, and also for link. However, we've been very deliberate about ensuring that we have this public blockchain nexus as a very strong strategy for us. And so quorum is an important part of that mix. Having an EVM side chain or a series of EVM side chains means that we can write solidity contracts, all of our development users, the same tooling that you would use when developing on public Ethereum or Polygon or any of the other EVM based protocols.
00:06:32.804 - 00:07:19.200, Speaker B: The work that we're doing is very much centered around how we can think about a future state where we can actually be much more focused on public blockchain once we have some things proven out. And those things are, in addition to regulatory buy in, focus on privacy aspects. Obviously, KYC and AML, we have a strong identity focus there. But even things like scaling are important in some sense as well. I would say it's a shifting and evolving process for us, but permission blockchains for where we are right now, and specifically from a regulatory perspective, are the means by which we can actually create value and show why blockchain actually makes sense as a technology for finance.
00:07:19.352 - 00:07:35.070, Speaker A: Where does buy in stop at JP Morgan for blockchain? Does it stop with you? And the executive team is kind of like, oh, Tyrone's kind of playing in the sand over here. Does your, does your boss like it? Does it go all the way to the top? Like where, where does that buy in stop at JP Morgan?
00:07:35.262 - 00:08:45.524, Speaker B: I think that one of the reasons why JPMorgan is so different to almost any other traditional finance player globally and why we've been able to make so much progress is because we've had sponsorship right from the top. I mean, Jamie Dimon himself is, you know, he is the one who has been championing from the, from the early days that blockchain technology can be really impactful onnx itself. You know, that is a business that has been created through support from both Jamie Dimon and our, the CEO of our CIB, Daniel Pinto. And so there is a huge sort of support base at the senior levels of JPMorgan around the work that we're doing. And so I think that mandate is something that has given us the ability really to one, have the early stage experimentation, but to transform that into something where we can actually generate revenue for the bank and for our clients and obviously get cost savings. So as much as I'd like to say the buck stops with me, there's definitely people above me that are supportive as well.
00:08:46.424 - 00:09:00.632, Speaker C: Well, Tyrone, I'd love to deconstruct a lot. There's three different components that I heard you talk about that you guys are focused on. Maybe if you could just give us a brief overview of what those mean, and then we can dive deeper into some of those as we go.
00:09:00.728 - 00:09:49.574, Speaker B: I'll jump into the four aspects of Onnx. So we'll start with this problem that we have identified around payments, specifically international payments. And so when you think about it, there is not really a global payments infrastructure. There's a sort of mishmash of local networks that are specific to a country that in the most case work very well. But when you actually get into cross border, they actually start to break down. And so the global financial services and specifically payments infrastructure is really a connection of correspondent banks and different ledgers that are not connected. And this challenge means that when you're actually looking to make an international payment, it's a multi day process.
00:09:49.574 - 00:10:57.950, Speaker B: It obviously has high fees for anyone who's trying to send money internationally. It's not exactly the best thing you're going to do in your life. And so really we looked at this and we thought, well, clearly, if you take look at what a blockchain is, this shared ledger, the shared infrastructure, if you can have these international correspondent banks sharing that same information, having real time visibility of the information associated with a payment, you can actually start to simplify a lot of what it means to move money internationally. And so that's really where a big focus of ours is on this link platform that we have. Then we come into just money in general, and here we're actually looking at the physical movement of money. Obviously, everything is electronic, pretty much, but ultimately you need to move money from my account sitting here in London to you all sitting in New York. And that again runs into the same challenge of there is not a global payments ledger or a set of infrastructure that talks to each other very seamlessly.
00:10:57.950 - 00:12:00.134, Speaker B: And we're all very familiar with stablecoins and just cryptocurrencies in general, and how it's so easy to move value when you're using blockchain technology that's really what we brought to wholesale payments in the form of JPMorgan coin. And then on the tokenization front here, we're thinking about the financial markets in general. When you look at security, settlement, all of the post trade activity that is involved in transferring ownership of one security from one party to another. It's an incredibly complex web of actors, participants. You obviously have broker dealers, custodians, you have central securities depositories. In some cases, you have transfer agencies. All of these actors exist really to do one thing at its core, which is when I'm selling a share to you, those records basically need to be updated to say you are the new owner.
00:12:00.134 - 00:12:40.254, Speaker B: And that is complex to do when you have this disparate infrastructure and these disparate players. And again, when we look at what blockchain technology can bring, this sort of shared ledger, and if you think about just any basic token that encodes within it the ownership of that token, quite clearly that's a model that seems very interesting and something that can be highly impactful to this idea of moving financial assets around. So that's a big focus for us. And then obviously all of the web, three side of things relating to identity and DeFi, we think that those can be impactful in new ways that traditional finance has not actually been able to tap into just yet.
00:12:40.414 - 00:12:44.774, Speaker C: Yeah, how much of that is internal versus core coordinating with other banks?
00:12:46.194 - 00:13:09.900, Speaker B: I would say that. So two things here. One is obviously, JP Morgan is a very broad set of businesses. We have markets business. We have a custodian, we have our payments business, we have an asset manager. What that means is we can move quite quickly by ourselves. We can actually prove out things because we have the end to end lifecycle.
00:13:09.900 - 00:13:47.270, Speaker B: Of course, we're not here to just create a blockchain infrastructure within JPMorgan. I mean, that's unnecessary. We can just use regular databases. But it does give us the proof points to say this idea actually makes sense and it has moved the needle for us as a set of businesses. That takes us to the second point, which is once we have a stronger idea around some specific solution, we can actually start to bring in other players as well. So the Onnx digital assets platform, for example, has global broker dealers signed up. Goldman Sachs is on the platform.
00:13:47.270 - 00:14:13.244, Speaker B: BNP is on the platform. DBS, for example. We have a number of others that we haven't been public about, but also large asset managers. So BlackRock, as an example, they are tokenizing or looking to tokenize money market fund shares through the Onyx digital assets platform. So it's very much a platform. And our strategy is being able to do this for the industry and with the industry.
00:14:13.784 - 00:14:29.216, Speaker C: Right. When you are talking to some of these broker dealers or clients about the benefits or even internally with someone like Daniel Pinto or Jamie, what is the proof point, the ROI, tangible ROI that.
00:14:29.240 - 00:14:31.504, Speaker B: You tell them, how do you sell this internally?
00:14:31.544 - 00:14:47.704, Speaker C: How do you sell this to the market of, hey, look, we're saving x amount of basis points per trade, or we can let you know, we can streamline operations and compliance by x percent. Like, how do you. Maybe if you could just share some of the proof points around, some of these pilots would be great.
00:14:47.824 - 00:15:33.598, Speaker B: Yeah. And it varies. That varies by use case. So let me start by saying we're processing about between one to $2 billion a day of tokenized assets through our Onnx digital assets platform. Since we launched in 2020, we processed almost $900 billion worth of assets. And so that sort of like, you know, goes to show the scale at which we can move assets and we can actually bring these new use cases to life. And the reason why in this specific case for, you know, what we're actually doing on the platform here is actually making it cheaper for our clients and even for JPMorgan to get access to liquidity intraday.
00:15:33.598 - 00:16:34.722, Speaker B: So the specific use case is we have clients who borrowed funds from JPMorgan during the day for whatever purposes they need. Oftentimes they borrow those funds on an unsecured basis, meaning they don't have to put up collateral. They're basically just drawing down on a credit line. But that can be expensive, especially for our bank and broker dealer clients, who ultimately would then have to hold some reserves on their own balance sheets to prove to regulators that in times of stress, if JP Morgan withdraws that credit line, they can still actually make those payments. And so that cost, that cost of capital is something that they have to sort of wear in some sense. What we can actually now provide is the ability for them to enter into an intraday borrowing facility where they are actually putting up collateral and being able to borrow against that. But they're able to do it using a standard financial instrument, a repo, a repurchase agreement, which is one of the most widely used financial instruments in the financial services market.
00:16:34.722 - 00:17:32.514, Speaker B: But where this becomes a challenge to use in regular way life is that a repo is not something that can settle in the same day. That is, I can't give you assets as collateral and you give me cash, and at the end of the day, we do the reverse. Like I give you your cash back with blockchain and specifically with smart contracts and this idea of tokenizing traditional assets, we can actually now do that. We can tokenize us treasuries, we can tokenize cash in the form of JPMorgan coin, and we can actually instantiate these assets as smart contracts and this trade as a smart contract. And now you can have very, very precise times as to when you're going to enter into the trade and when the funds are going to be returned. And so what that actually looks like specifically is a reduction in cost, right? You can actually show the basis points reduction. And we estimate that by the end of next year, for our markets business, there'll be a saving on the order of like $20 million.
00:17:32.514 - 00:17:44.214, Speaker B: So it's not like massive in the grand scheme of things, but it's not immaterial either. And so we use these proof points to actually build out further use cases and expand into other asset types as well.
00:17:44.714 - 00:18:01.826, Speaker C: And that's internally. But if you're a client where you're entering that repo facility, I would assume that there's also benefits for them in terms of flexibility or, I don't know, maybe better terms versus working with another bank, I guess.
00:18:02.010 - 00:19:20.414, Speaker B: Right? I mean, it's this idea of, can I get access to capital in a lower cost way? Can I be more efficient with my capital instead of having to lock it up overnight? Can I actually get access to those assets today? And can I be more precise about how I'm going to be using my funding? All of those things, especially in a kind of tightening rate environment or in times of stress around liquidity, become really, really important and actually impactful. And then the additional thing is this idea of added utility. All of a sudden you can use your assets in a way that you couldnt use them before. And were seeing this specifically in the asset manager community, where we have asset managers like BlackRock who are looking to tokenize money market fund shares. And the reason why theyre looking to do that is because they want to provide utility to their investors who are actually looking to potentially pledge those shares as collateral instead of redeeming out of the fund. Going to get access to cash, now going to post our cash as collateral, the investors can just stay invested and use those shares in a way that they couldn't have. And so it's not only like the cost savings, but it's the additional utility that these clients are able to get and actually offer to their own clients.
00:19:21.674 - 00:19:45.878, Speaker C: Just to give folks a sense of perspective on the number of you mentioned this figure close to a trillion dollars, like up to this point. That's what I mean. That's still a very small percentage of the aggregate flow that you guys are handling. But how does that trendline look over the past couple of years? And how do you think about that evolution going forward, like in the next 510 years?
00:19:46.006 - 00:19:55.184, Speaker A: Yeah, and also I'd be curious to hear, Tyrone, how much do you, how much do you guys process in a day? Like, is it 5 trillion, 10 trillion? What is the magnitude here, you know?
00:19:55.294 - 00:20:35.786, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So in terms of like, the trajectory and the growth we've seen in the first half of the year, in 23, we processed as much as we processed through the whole of 22. So that is quite a significant uptick. And that's through a couple of things. One is more clients coming onto the platform, but also clients seeing more value and actually looking to use it more frequently than what they were. So I think we're going to see maybe that double through next year. The trajectory is fairly strong, and you're totally right, this is still small numbers in the grand scheme of things.
00:20:35.786 - 00:21:22.660, Speaker B: But I think the proof point is real. The fact that we have global clients looking to use these products and in some sense almost not caring that it's blockchain, they just want access to. This new feature basically is a really strong signal for us in terms of what this actually looks like from a magnitude perspective in the payments business. In the traditional payments business, this is completely away from blockchain, just our traditional payments flows. We process $10 trillion every day. That's a big number. And I think this is also a reason why we have started to look at creating different types of payments products that are not quite stablecoin.
00:21:22.660 - 00:22:10.834, Speaker B: Like, by that I mean, when we talk about JPMorgan coin, what we're actually talking about is a blockchain based bank account. Like, it's a really bad name, JPMorgan coin, because it's not actually a coin, it's just a blockchain based account. And it means that it's a deposit, that represents a deposit liability from JPMorgan's perspective. And so our institutional clients who can now access JPMorgan coin basically have all of the guarantees that they would have for any other money that they hold with JPMorgan. And that means that we can start to think about the scale of this $10 trillion of payments that we possibly couldn't get to if we were just implementing a pure, fully reserved, stablecoin like instrument.
00:22:11.554 - 00:22:27.574, Speaker A: Tyrone, what are your thoughts on USDC? It's obviously had a tremendous amount of success. But it sounds like when I hear you talk about tokenized deposits, that's almost a different take on how to build a stablecoin, in a sense. What's your take on almost the pros and cons of USDC?
00:22:28.594 - 00:23:32.350, Speaker B: I think USDC is obviously incredibly important for the crypto industry. It is, in my sense, pretty much the killer app of sort of retail crypto, because it does solve the key problem of moving money, and moving money quickly and cheaply. And we spoke a little bit about how challenging that is in the current infrastructure, the current environment, because of this basically very fragmented set of payment solutions. So I think having USDC, and specifically having a reputable company in circle actually offering that solution. Now in other currencies, obviously they have Eurocoin, which is still growing, but it's a really, really important proof that this technology can make a real difference in this case, from a retail perspective. This thesis still needs to be played out. But I think where USDC is going to hit a cap is going to be at scale.
00:23:32.350 - 00:24:25.456, Speaker B: So when I talk about the $10 trillion that we're processing every night, and I was looking this morning, I think the market, sorry, the 24 hours volume for both USDC and USDT is like $25 billion or something. That's like 400 times less than what we do every day. And if you think about having to fully reserve $10 trillion to be able to make those payments every day, that's a lot of liquidity that you're taking out of the system. And that really actually has a negative impact. And you can't really start to create credit creation. You can't actually enact credit creation and issue auto loans and mortgages if you have this huge balance of liquidity that's locked up. So I think that USDC has 100% a place to play.
00:24:25.456 - 00:24:38.108, Speaker B: I don't know that in its current construct, it can play at the institutional level, which is really where I think a bank like JPMorgan comes in and starts to offer a slightly different product, but has the same benefits.
00:24:38.236 - 00:24:45.276, Speaker A: So what you're basically saying is USDC is not. It's. What you're saying is there needs to be a stable coin, but built on a fractional reserve system.
00:24:45.380 - 00:25:36.484, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the common criticism of Defi has been it's highly inefficient because you can't do fractionalization, it's fully collateralized. And attempts to do under collateralization have failed because it's sort of this civil problem. You don't know who's at the other end of the you interact. The other, you don't know who's on the other. The counterparty. Right. So one of the things that I've thought about is, okay, what's it going to take for JP Morgan to settle stuff on chain with Goldman or with a hedge fund, x or y in a hybrid type of environment where it's maybe like a permission version of AavE where you're using a switzerland l one, call it ethereum, but you know, your counterparty, hey, if there's ever a dispute like the smart contract, logic is very clear.
00:25:36.644 - 00:25:37.004, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:37.044 - 00:26:24.954, Speaker C: So that to some extent, minimum allows you to do certain things that you can with the traditional financial system, meaning things close, you know, on the weekend and after hours and whatnot. But if there's ever a dispute, you know who the counterparty is, you can go to court. Like credit has always throughout history been enforced with violence or perceived level of violence at the end of the day. So what's it going to take to for you guys and for Goldman and other institutions to do you think that that is likely the evolution where you guys end up tapping into defi? Or do you say, hey, look, no, that's going to exist on this for these kind of on the fringes, we're going to build our own with other financial institutions, use our network, but maybe tap into Ethereum through a side chain or something. How do you guys think of all that?
00:26:25.114 - 00:27:44.894, Speaker B: What you're describing is almost exactly what we did last year under this project called Guardian with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. And what we essentially did was we created tokenized deposits, deposit tokens of both Singapore dollars and japanese yen. We issued those onto the Polygon mainnet. We stood up a specific version of the AAVE Ark protocol that has permissions in terms of who can actually access the Defi pools. We created pools for both yen and Singapore dollars, and then we built in this identity system using verifiable credentials that all together showed how traditional financial services can actually interact with DeFi in a compliant way. Because as you said, if you can get to that, if you can get to the transparency and trust that those protocols can offer with a persistent, highly available, highly redundant settlement rail like Ethereum, well, that has to be a better infrastructure than what you could otherwise have and pretty much what we have today. And so the test was highly instructive for us in terms of working out how to actually use these pools, how to do this, as I said, in a compliant way.
00:27:44.894 - 00:28:16.384, Speaker B: And it also showed us some things that still need to improve one of them. We actually hit this problem during the test where there was this massive NFT drop on polygon through the spike in fees. Right. We had this FX transaction that was sort of like waiting there. Okay, let's up the gas. And trying to get this thing through, which is fine for a test, but you can't really operate at scale and you can't do anything that is time sensitive. We not spoke about the repo product that we have.
00:28:16.384 - 00:28:46.198, Speaker B: Those are very, very time sensitive trades. You actually need to settle at a specific time. Scalability is important. Having the ability to not be impacted through the noisy neighbor problem is important. Privacy is highly important. There's obviously a big discussion in the community around privacy. And obviously from a financial services perspective, we can't have the position where our competitors can see our trading position, for example, privacy is one.
00:28:46.198 - 00:29:22.574, Speaker B: And then clearly the KYC aspect is something that we have to abide by from a regulatory perspective and ensuring that we're not enabling money laundering. Those are some of the things that need to come into being in a more robust way for us to actually be able to fully step into a public Defi or public blockchain environment. But as I was saying at the top, this is actually why we have set ourselves up in the way that we have, because we do think that there is a path there and we want to build all of our products and infrastructure to be compatible so that we can effectively lift and drop.
00:29:23.474 - 00:29:51.984, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to ask you on the privacy stuff. I mean, obviously there's been a persistent problem in the industry, like, you know, front running is a big problem, and you don't want to ever show your competitor what trades you're doing and how you're doing it. Is there an active effort within the organization to create a solution around that? Or are you waiting for others to kind of leverage zero knowledge proofs or something to where you can adopt and integrate?
00:29:52.444 - 00:30:51.210, Speaker B: We've been active around privacy probably for six or seven years now. So, Jason, you mentioned the core quorum protocol. Actually, in 2017, we were, I think, the first people to implement zero knowledge proofs on an Ethereum blockchain. And we actually basically grafted the Zcash protocol onto quorum to show that you could have these privacy preserving transactions where you don't actually know the amount that's being transacted or who the parties are. That was a PoC that was difficult to progress for a number of reasons, specifically around where zero knowledge proofs were at the time. It was very, very costly to generate them took a long time, hard to write the circuits, etcetera. We actually did some work a few years later, basically adopting the Zeta protocol, the Zeta paper that came out of Stanford, and we implemented something called anonymous zeta, which is a more effective and a more efficient way.
00:30:51.210 - 00:31:41.404, Speaker B: It basically uses bulletproofs to prove privacy as well as maintain anonymity. And that was actually highly, I think probably one of the pieces of work that we've done that was the most promising, but had a very high demand in terms of skillset. We just don't have the deep, very, very large cryptography teams internally that you would need to put that out at scale. So we've contributed that to the community that's fully open sourced for people to go and build on. And to answer the question, we haven't seen anything just yet that can actually solve the problem. Very open and willing to work with people in the community who are looking at this because it is obviously foundational for us, but we just haven't seen anything that can operate robustly at scale just yet.
00:31:42.104 - 00:31:56.784, Speaker A: What's your perfect vision for how identity would work in crypto, Tyrone? Is it because I think the key is having an identity on chain while preserving privacy, which is much tougher than people realize. So what's your vision for kind of the perfect solution that you'd love to see?
00:31:57.124 - 00:32:59.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a little bit biased towards, and maybe sort of too much so towards verifiable credentials. So verifiable credentials for those who don't know. Basically now a w three C recommendation, which basically means that the w three C, as like the premier body for the Internet standardization, is recommending to use verifiable credentials for identity, you know, claims, etcetera. And basically they are a cryptographic proof of something about you or something about, you know, your organization that is irrefutable. So if you tell me, you know, or if I tell you I work at JP Morgan and I present to you a credential that says I am a JPMorgan employee, you can cryptographically prove that you don't have to rely on me. It's all embedded in the crypto private key signatures. I think that verifiable credentials are very interesting for a few reasons.
00:32:59.198 - 00:33:47.562, Speaker B: One, they do maintain privacy. When you're actually holding a credential that you need to present to someone else, you're never really giving them that credential and you're never having to store it in some place that many people can access and that your data can sort of be put at risk through hacking or theft. It's also technology agnostic. And this is actually a really important point. The way I think that crypto actually has the step change in terms of bigger adoption and broader usage is more integration into the web two world, more integration into today's world, and this idea of identity and being able to sort of cross the boundaries. I'm Tyron Lobbin. In the real world, I also want to be Tyron Lobbin and prove that these are my crypto assets.
00:33:47.562 - 00:34:24.064, Speaker B: When I want to go and do something, I don't want to have this sort of bifurcation, verifiable credentials, have this nice property of being technology agnostic. And so I could use my proof of my name or proof of my address when I'm logging into, like, I don't know, my regular way bank account, and I can also use it when I'm trying to prove that I am a reputable person in this defi protocol and I'm good for the amount of money that I'm going to be borrowing. So I think that something like verifiable credentials is important, but the space is still emerging and there's quite a lot of research that's going on as well.
00:34:25.964 - 00:35:03.166, Speaker A: All right, everyone wanted to talk about vouch again, our favorite insurance provider for crypto companies. If you are building in crypto, you have probably come to realize that contracts need insurance. Partners demand insurance. And as a founder myself, trust me when I say you owe it to not only yourself, but your investors and your clients and your customers. And I'm not just talking about any insurance. Their exclusive coverages are tailored specifically for crypto companies that can address issues like protections for regulatory defense, recognizing daos as insured, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities, and even covering the loss of digital assets. They're in it with you.
00:35:03.166 - 00:35:35.032, Speaker A: Whether you're working on l one s, l two s, dows, MPC, wallet providers, building a protocol, and a lot more. So whether you're just scribbling your next big idea on a napkin or gearing up for a big fundraiser, maybe thinking about that IPO or an acquisition, don't leave things to chance. Get insured today with 5% off vouchs. Exclusive coverage for empire listeners using code empire. Think about it this way. With vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind. Yeah.
00:35:35.032 - 00:36:05.346, Speaker A: So a lot of what you're talking about are things that I think the front end consumer won't see. They'll see it maybe in the savings, or they'll see it in trade settling faster, but they don't actually use it. When you look at what's happening across the industry. Who is it? Citadel. I think Citadel, Fidelity and Schwab are building that supposed crypto exchange you have, I've heard of a couple of the biggest web, two companies building their own wallets, kind of like almost a fork of what feels like Metamask. Have you guys thought about what a front facing crypto product from JPMorgan would look like?
00:36:05.490 - 00:37:36.364, Speaker B: Yeah, we've actually thought about that a lot because, and I'll sort of frame this from the point of view that within onnx, we sort of have this freedom to go and try and work out, like, what that future looks like, and even if that future can be somewhat disruptive to our existing businesses, for example. But the way that we thought about this identity and wallet space is actually that these things should all really come together. Ultimately, we think that if you could have a wallet that had both of your digital assets, your personal assets like nfts, whatever the case is, as well as your identity credentials all in one, you can actually start to get a much better usage of your value, the things that you care about the most in your life. And so we actually built a prototype mobile wallet that really brings these things together, brings together your nfts, brings together your verifiable credentials, brings together your digital assets, and sort of showed how you could do illustrative things like, I don't know, take out a loan where the credit score was based on the credentials that you had in your wallet and also the value of your crypto assets. So you could, you know, basically reduce your loan to value in some sense. So that's not a product that we've actually taken to market, but it's a very sort of strong indicator as to how we think about these things coming together. And I think that that's where it's going to go.
00:37:36.364 - 00:37:47.304, Speaker B: And actually, in the last sort of year or so, you've seen companies starting to put out digital wallets that are not just for crypto, but also some identity aspects as well.
00:37:48.044 - 00:38:13.480, Speaker A: Id love to zoom out and just get your take on. Just as someone who works on crypto but almost outside the industry, what is your view of whats gone right and whats gone wrong right now? And there are these big conversations happening in crypto, l two s defi apps building their app chain, thesis, things like that. Would love to just get your zoomed out view of what youre excited about, what you think folks have gotten right, what you think folks have gotten wrong.
00:38:13.652 - 00:38:52.274, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I mean, you know, weirdly, although we sort of sit on the outside, we do a lot of work in blockchain itself. You know, my whole team is, you know, writing smart contracts and dapps and, you know, building key management solutions. And so I feel like we also come from a point of view of really understanding the technology. And that's right from the days when we built quorum itself. I'm sort of like a little bit conflicted about the very, very high focus on infrastructure. Clearly there's been a long time focused on scalability, building out all the l two solutions.
00:38:52.274 - 00:39:34.944, Speaker B: More recently, things like PBS for MeV and how you can actually optimize that whole flow. More recently, I think very helpfully, things like account abstraction come in. But I'm sort of a little bit conflicted about is there too much focus on infrastructure and trying to do very cool technology things and not enough focus on use cases and actually trying to move the needle for people really just make things easier. And I think that's been a big focus for us internally. We have to generate revenue. Ultimately we have to show value. And that's not going to be through creating some really great, you know, technology solution that doesn't solve a problem.
00:39:34.944 - 00:40:25.178, Speaker B: And so we've had, we've sort of been forced to take the use case first approach. What is the actual problem that we're solving? How is this going to make things better for people? And then look to see what technology we can actually use to enable that. You know, we spoke a little bit about this project Guardian that we did last year. We actually ended up implementing what people now call a smart account, you know, as part of account abstraction. This was really before 4337 had come out. We created this contract on chain that basically represented JPMorgan and held the funds for JPMorgan, but didn't give traders direct access to it. Like, we basically built in these rules that said you have to prove by submitting a verifiable credential that you are an authorized trader.
00:40:25.178 - 00:41:18.410, Speaker B: And all of those rules and the rules around like limit checks were built directly into the smart contract. Now that's called a smart account. And people talk about account abstraction, which obviously has been in the works for many, many years. So definitely not claiming that this is something that we created. But the point is that we actually started with the problem of how do we simplify for our traders the ability to actually interact with these defi pools as opposed to is there a cool technology sort of thing that we can create and try and retrofit that. So I think one thing is there's been a huge amount of innovation, but sometimes I just wonder, like, is it overly focused and overly indexed on infrastructure? But I also get why. Right? I mean, you have to have something that scales, you have to have something that can compete with the likes of the large processing, like payments processing, settlement networks.
00:41:18.410 - 00:41:32.874, Speaker B: But I do think that we need to go more into use cases generally. And then I mentioned some specific areas that I, I don't think there's been enough focus on privacy being the primary one, at least from a traditional financial services perspective.
00:41:34.334 - 00:41:45.534, Speaker C: Yeah. How do you, I guess, on the use case discussion, this is especially common in bear markets, which is like, why are you guys building this? Where does it all matter?
00:41:45.614 - 00:41:46.406, Speaker B: I haven't seen it.
00:41:46.430 - 00:42:37.684, Speaker C: And I guess you can point to NFTs and you can point to stuff like Defi and inclusion and access and whatnot, but not really back it up with meaningful numbers in terms of users. But an organization like JPMorgan, largest bank in the world, you can roll this out and you have the distribution, you have the global scale. When you think about, you talked about the repo facility, you talked about Guardian. Maybe just give us one or two other examples of use cases that may come within the next couple of years without giving the secret sauce, but just an illustration of what it could be possible or we could be seeing down the road. I mean, obviously there's now a more renewed interest and perhaps line of sight into being an approval for bitcoin ETF.
00:42:37.724 - 00:42:39.532, Speaker B: There was a East ETF, it was.
00:42:39.548 - 00:42:55.014, Speaker C: Just filed recently by Ark and 21 shares. How do you guys think about that? What could you, in a state of the world where we have ETF, how would you think about your client base being excited about that, having access to that and you guys offering that in the block?
00:42:55.054 - 00:44:07.592, Speaker B: Yeah, actually I have a sort of tangential answer, which is, and maybe, Jason, this goes back to a little bit about what you were asking in terms of what has the crypto industry done right and done wrong. I don't think the crypto industry has done itself any favors around creating confidence with large institutions, specifically, obviously through the recent FTX debacle. And that obviously, as we all know, has nothing to do with the technology entirely, everything to do with just governance and how companies are structured and compliance around them. But when you look at the very unfortunate thing was it was Alameda and FTX effects effectively were these poster child companies. And I think that it's going to take some time for regulators to get comfortable again, not that they were ever fully comfortable, but I know that there was progress. So regulators need to get there, and large financial institutions need to get there, need to be okay with allocating capital. Obviously, there are institutions today that are allocating to crypto, but it's small.
00:44:07.592 - 00:44:37.162, Speaker B: And I think some of these sort of foundational things need to be improved before people feel comfortable. So I think the ETF has wrapped up in a lot of that. Will it happen? Who's to know, really? It feels like maybe given everything that's happened more recently, but equally, nothing is guaranteed. Our focus is not so much around crypto investing, it's more around how can we create these new products leveraging blockchain.
00:44:37.298 - 00:45:35.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I guess on this point of regulation, not to get too much into the weeds, but I do think from your vantage point, you understand how a bank works and the different segregation within a bank. And when you're managing clients money, there's very clear who's the custodian and who's the broker deal. There's a very clear system within finance to precisely prevent a thing like FTX happening. So I got to wonder, I mean, there's some very sophisticated investors that looked at the deal, maybe glossed over the structure and the relationship between some like Alameda and FTX. But, I mean, gosh, like, you almost got to think if you're looking at something like that, and I did back in the day, and that was a red flag for me, this Alameda FTX relationship, because, I mean, I was JP Morgan, you understand, there's walls and there's processes, procedures in place, but there wasn't much there. So I'm curious. I don't know if you looked at the deal or not, but that's, to me, not a crypto problem.
00:45:35.104 - 00:45:48.384, Speaker C: This is a lack of due diligence. That, by the way, is not only inherent in crypto. I mean, there's terrible deals that have been done in a record low interest rate environment because people are lazy. It's free money, and so they just play around with it and slosh around and it's not theirs.
00:45:48.424 - 00:45:48.648, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:48.696 - 00:46:04.844, Speaker C: So I'm curious not to be a defense, but, you know, a, you guys looked at that deal, and had you looked at the deal, I mean, clearly, like this custodianship, there ought to be clear rules and regulations within crypto for service providers.
00:46:04.924 - 00:46:48.192, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, you know, the deal aside, you know, I don't think that was something that was ever on the table for us, but we have been for a long time sort of advocating for these clear roles and responsibilities. Right. And the need for this. This was well before anything surfaced on FTX. It's just because the market infrastructure exists today for a reason, and it is around protection, and it is around ensuring segregation of roles and responsibilities, where we think that the real impact is simplifying how those different structures can communicate. And that's where blockchain makes sense. It's like having the shared ledger.
00:46:48.192 - 00:46:57.104, Speaker B: You can still have separate roles and responsibilities, but you can actually come to a decision and conclusion around, like, ownership transfer in a much more efficient way.
00:46:57.224 - 00:47:33.760, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, a lot of my prior friends in the industry, or JP Morgan, my alma mater, when they ever reached out, and I said, well, imagine a world where you can very quickly understand who your counterparty is, and you can measure risk. You can see transactions happening, and wouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be nice to minimize counterparty risk? Wouldn't be nice to, like, be able to, you know, operate 24 7365 and atomically settle and with if then statements like, as you write them in excel or python or whatever, right? And they're like, yeah, that'd be great.
00:47:33.872 - 00:47:34.096, Speaker A: And.
00:47:34.120 - 00:47:53.120, Speaker C: But as soon as I said crypto, like, no, no, no, you know what? Like, you lost me there, but, you know, and, but you say blockchain, not crypto, and they're like, they get reengaged again. So, yeah, I mean, I think as a bank, you constantly think about counterparty risk, but, you know, the issues around privacy are key. Right?
00:47:53.192 - 00:47:53.448, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:53.496 - 00:48:30.100, Speaker C: So I guess all this rambled to think about, like, within, within JP Morgan, like, the buy in within the organization has that remained steady over the years? Do you think that it has, you know, now, given the recent events with FTX, we're just. That the industry's kind of in a bear market or, you know, the economy or whatever. Has interest waned within the organization? Like, is the buying still strong? How does your group and its role within the bank, like, have evolved over time, and where do you see it kind of over the next couple of years?
00:48:30.212 - 00:49:16.126, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that the buy in for the potential that this tech has, has increased over the past few years, not even maintained, increased. And that's because we've got more confident on how to deploy it, how to implement it, how to actually go live. We're not talking about pilots. We're talking about BaU products that are fully integrated into our regular way, banking systems. We have blockchain connected to our core infrastructure, and we have a good understanding of what makes a good use case. So I think with that lens, we're confident that we're just going to carry on. There is obviously the unfortunate noise around the more recent crypto bear market, but that's going to come and go.
00:49:16.126 - 00:49:23.758, Speaker B: That's always going to happen. We just want to make sure that we're really generating value for our clients and for JP Morgan, I think.
00:49:23.846 - 00:49:42.458, Speaker A: Last thing to wrap this up, I know you guys have this hackathon coming up that you wanted to talk about. You've got lens and layer zero, Zksync Magic. It's not, I'm not used to seeing Zksync Magic layer zero and lens and then JP Morgan's name next to it. So maybe we can wrap this up by just talking about that hackathon and really what you're looking for here.
00:49:42.546 - 00:50:36.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so the participants that we have, it's just Zksync bikonomy magic, as you said, lens protocol. I think really some of the strongest web3 names coming together, JPMorgan, there's another larger payment company that's going to be announced hopefully next week. Really, the idea here is we think that digital identity is one of the core pieces of this new world, this idea of having more control over your own data, having more control over your own identity. We spoke about the fact that you want to be able to prove who you are without revealing everything about yourself. It's very easy in the real world for you and I to walk into a room and people are not questioning that like I'm the real tyrant. I mean, obviously I am in life. But when you're online, you lose all of that certainty.
00:50:37.182 - 00:50:40.870, Speaker C: How do we know you're not like a deep fake unless you have cryptographic pieces to prove it?
00:50:40.982 - 00:52:03.840, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe next year, but exactly that, right? Like online, you lose all of that ability to trust. And so we think that the crux for bringing web two and web3 together lies in identity, being able to bring your actual self into the crypto world and be able to utilize your crypto assets in the web two space as well. What we wanted to do, and we've been working on digital identity solutions for a long time, is try and do this in a more formal way. Through this hackathon, we've actually open sourced the identity infrastructure that we've created, or at least a part of it. And we want people to come up with cool use cases, show us how verifiable credentials can actually make easier to access some under collateralized protocol, and provably show that you have the credentials to actually borrow from someone else without revealing who you are or onboard in a much easier way, again, in a privacy centric way. There's so many areas where identity is just at the core of what we do in our day to day lives, but it's a deliberately missing piece from crypto. But I think that more and more so that's going to have to change.
00:52:03.840 - 00:52:41.300, Speaker B: We are already seeing KYC requirements, AML requirements for some of the protocols that are tokenizing real world assets, quote unquote, because they want institutional investors and they want institutional sort of adoption. So I think there's this huge space that can be created and we would love to facilitate that. And that's really what the hackathon is about. So I'm sure we'll be able to post the link to it. We're going to be kicking off on September 12. So right in the middle of permissionless next week, it runs for a month online. There's about $70,000 worth of prizes to be won.
00:52:41.300 - 00:52:55.184, Speaker B: And really it's just centered on combining these really great web3 protocols with strong digital identity concepts and technology to show how we can actually create this new layer of trust.
00:52:56.004 - 00:52:57.172, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome.
00:52:57.348 - 00:53:17.576, Speaker C: That's fascinating. I think we'd all agree that digital identity is super important, so it's great to see you guys spearheading that and coordinating with a lot of the top projects in the space. Any parting thoughts? Tyrone, it's been a great pleasure to have you. Always good to have a former JP Morgan front on the pod. Anything else you want to leave the audience with? Otherwise, it's been a great discussion.
00:53:17.720 - 00:53:50.284, Speaker B: Yeah, no, just from our perspective, these bear and bull markets come and go, but I think that what we are hopefully showing is there is real use for this technology and we have a huge focus internally and I hope that especially through something like the hackathon, we can show how the traditional finance world and the new web3 world can come together in a really productive way. So thanks to both of you for inviting me on. Always great chatting and looking forward to seeing you next week in person at permissionless.
00:53:50.404 - 00:53:52.572, Speaker A: See you next week. Thanks, Tyron.
00:53:52.628 - 00:53:53.004, Speaker B: All right, folks.
