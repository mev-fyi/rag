00:00:00.000 - 00:00:00.151, Speaker A: Chris.
00:00:00.151 - 00:00:05.354, Speaker B: It's great to see everyone. Guys, this is Chris Dixon, the father of mental models for web three.
00:00:10.014 - 00:00:11.190, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:00:11.342 - 00:00:49.964, Speaker B: So, Chris, a 16 z actually just released a really exciting report today. I believe it's live. It's called the state of crypto, and that is also the title of this panel, because I think we want to go through sort of a state of the union. Here we are in May 2022. We're ten years plus in this experiment. A little bit, I would say, earlier on the web three experiment. Could you start us off with this? So, when you define web three, and that, I think, is the theme for this conference where we talk about the metaverse, we talk about crypto, we talk about nfts, web three really encapsulates all of these things.
00:00:49.964 - 00:00:52.664, Speaker B: Define it for us. What's your mental model for web three?
00:00:52.744 - 00:01:23.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the simplest way to. To kind of frame it is web one is read, web two. Can you hear? Is it an echo? Okay, sorry. Web two is read write, and web three is read write own, which is what we show on the slide. Another way to think of it, like, very briefly, I've written a lot more about this, too, if folks are interested, on my Twitter account and other places. But web one is roughly 1990 ish, I think, when the modern web started to around 2005. And there were a lot of great things in that era, but it was sort of characterized by wide distribution of knowledge.
00:01:23.490 - 00:01:47.586, Speaker A: So kind of, I think, of the killer app of that era was you go to Google, you type a phrase, and you could. Anyone in the world can do that and go read something. And that was amazing. And then web two came along, and you had things like Facebook and Twitter, where anyone in the world could, instead of just reading information, could also publish. So you could go and you could type into a Facebook text box, and suddenly the whole world would see it. And that was a really powerful thing. And we've seen that play out over 15 years.
00:01:47.586 - 00:02:23.914, Speaker A: And obviously, Instagram and TikTok and just sort of social media in general has become really kind of had a profound influence. But the problem, and web two was wonderful, and people got free services. We have something on the order of 5 billion people now with mobile phones, with relatively inexpensive services that are incredibly powerful. And those companies, I think, I believe, contributed a lot to the world. But there was one big problem, which is they were very kind of concentrated power. So there's about four or five companies now that basically kind of control the Internet. And I think we're at risk of having an Internet that's kind of like the 1970s broadcast tv or something, where you have like CB's, NBC, a lot of sort of historical forms of media kind of consolidated at some point.
00:02:23.914 - 00:02:49.438, Speaker A: I think we're at risk of that. I think what's nice is the Internet is a much more kind of plastic medium. People like in this room, who I think will be the ones who do it, can go and change the Internet. It's not over yet. We're very early in this process, and so we're very excited. What we call Web three, and the key feature of Web three is you now are sort of, instead of just democratizing knowledge and publishing, you're now democratizing ownership. And specifically, the way you can own something is through a token, whether it be fungible or non fungible.
00:02:49.438 - 00:03:32.790, Speaker A: NfTs. I think of in the same way that sort of the magical first experience where you kind of get this in web one was, I think when you go to Google and type a word, I think in web three you have things like airdrops as an example. So for those who remember the Uniswap airdrop, which I thought was a really interesting moment, you had this service that was popular and had a lot of users, but they were used to peering over the fence at web two companies and not being part of it. And then that day of the airdrop, 15% of the ownership of the product protocol was given out to all of the users according to how much they'd used it. And we're seeing more and more of that happening. I think it's become the norm now in web three is about at least half of your ownership of your project. Your tokens are given to the community based on their actions.
00:03:32.790 - 00:04:05.080, Speaker A: That's very, very different, where essentially you're giving zero in web two, both in terms of ownership and in terms of just revenue, economics and things, which we'll kind of get to some of these slides. So I believe we're in the beginning of this web two era. I think it started roughly a few years ago, when a lot of the blockchains and other kinds of those kinds of technologies we're talking about at this conference got to a point of minimum viable maturity. And I think we're going to have a really exciting decade. And this is how I spend all of my time, and we have a whole team devoted to it. And I think this is the future and the most exciting thing to be working on in the technology world right now.
00:04:05.152 - 00:04:40.934, Speaker B: So, Chris, what you're saying is we've really unlocked an entirely new I guess primitive here. So from read to read write, where we got the social media era to read, write and own. And that just doesn't unlock opportunity for investors and people in the audience. That also unlocks massive opportunity for creators. And we've seen recently in the last year or two, the rise of this NFT economy. What's been so exciting, I think, is that is not a bunch of, you know, finance geeks kind of geeking out on things. These are like musicians, these are artists, these are creators with communities.
00:04:40.934 - 00:04:48.262, Speaker B: Can you talk about that? I know your state of crypto report covers that a little bit. What are you seeing in the NFT space, and how does that relate to the web? Three vision?
00:04:48.398 - 00:05:26.308, Speaker A: Yeah, I think NFTs are particularly important because they have this kind of cultural media aspect attached to them and they're less sort of defi. We're very active in Defi and very excited about Defi, but it's much more of a quantitative kind of experience, whereas NFTs have this kind of media and kind of cultural aspect, which I think really kind of catalyze a movement of sort of a new cohort of people into the space, creative people. And so with this slide, this is from our report today. What this slide highlights is that this is just so that 3.9 billion is the amount, what we tried to estimate is not secondary sales. And all sorts of total volume on something like OpenSea is dramatically higher than that. This is the subset of volume where the actual payouts went to creative people.
00:05:26.308 - 00:05:47.680, Speaker A: And I think what's important here is, I guess a couple of things. One is, although we're early in web three, those are meaningful numbers, number one. And number two, I think it also highlights how poorly web two pays out. I mean, YouTube is really the best one, and they brag about this 15 billion. That's a drop in the bucket on the Internet. That's tiny. That's the total amount they pay out.
00:05:47.680 - 00:06:12.390, Speaker A: Facebook pays out nothing. Twitter pays out nothing. They don't share revenue. So you talk to a creative person who built an audience on Twitter, and one, Facebook runs ads and makes, whatever, 100 billion plus, and none of that money goes to those creators. And in fact, they even go beyond that. They have this whole teams of people whose job it is to reduce your organic reach such that you have to go buy ads. And there's a whole kind of game they play to kind of suck all the money out of the creators.
00:06:12.390 - 00:06:38.058, Speaker A: And I think what happened is the creators just, I feel like there's this whole kind of generation who look, I mean, people were seduced. These were incredible services. You could now have audiences. But I think it was kind of, kind of a misleading pitch that these companies made, which is, hey, go build a career on this. And you have a lot of people who are disillusioned. And so one of the big opportunities we have, like with NFTs, is to bypass those platforms. So let's take music as an example.
00:06:38.058 - 00:07:18.876, Speaker A: So music Spotify advertises the fact that they have 8 million artists on Spotify, and 14,000 make 50,000 a year or more, and the rest make less. And so that means 14,000 make roughly like the average salary, and that's before cost and everything else. It's basically music on the Internet. It basically only works if you're an incredibly popular musician, doesn't work for the long tail, for normal people who want to go and be creative and build an audience and everything else. So a lot of those musicians, at least in a non COVID time, would make their money offline through merchandise, through touring. Why they do that? Because it's like nfts, and that's the one place where they can bypass the platform and go direct to their fans. And so what NFT does nfts do for those musicians, and we have some investments here, like sound, XYZ and Royal.
00:07:18.876 - 00:07:42.798, Speaker A: And there's a bunch of other exciting startups in the space, is they allow musicians to go and build experiences, digital collectibles, access passes, whatever they might be. NFTs are a very general kind of new computing, primitive. You can impute any kind of whatever you want into it. You can have, it's a container. And so we're seeing all sorts of interesting experiments as to what those nfts do. But the key thing is they can go directly to their audience, right? And so maybe they pay. Opensea charges two and a half percent.
00:07:42.798 - 00:08:16.368, Speaker A: Some of these other platforms charge very. Everything you see in this space is a very low take rate. And it's not because OpenSea is altruistic, it's because you can switch, because the NFT doesn't exist on OpenSea. The NFT exists on the Ethereum blockchain or on some other blockchain or Solana blockchain, whatever it might be, and you can switch. And so there's a much more competitive market where these services have to actually earn their take rates, they have to earn the economics they take instead of just being granted them, frankly, which is what the web two is because of their monopolistic network effects. No one like I'm on Twitter. I have a bunch of Twitter followers.
00:08:16.368 - 00:08:46.429, Speaker A: I would love to leave Twitter. I can't leave Twitter because I'm locked in, right? Because I've spent so many years. I mean, I can leave Twitter, but I would lose years of work. And so one of the great things about these kind of blockchain architectures is they allow, they shift the power back to users. The users can switch, the creative people can switch, they can bypass the platforms. So I love this slide because I think it shows that as much as we are early in this movement, it's already meaningful. In fact, I'd like to turn this into a dashboard that kind of tracks some real time in the same way like Defi pulse tracks TVL.
00:08:46.429 - 00:08:57.949, Speaker A: I'd love to start tracking the web three creative economy, see if we have to go build that. But if someone has, someone else wants to build. But I think it'd be really interesting to track. I think. I'm hoping that we can pass web two in the next year or two.
00:08:58.021 - 00:09:02.253, Speaker B: Guys, that's code for Chris Dixon wants some builder in the audience to come build this dashboard.
00:09:02.293 - 00:09:07.477, Speaker A: I just think it'd be a cool thing. It'd be fun to track. You know how when people create, like, defi pulse, they create dashboards?
00:09:07.525 - 00:09:08.021, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:09:08.077 - 00:09:11.278, Speaker A: If it creates a memetic shelling point, Kevin said, you know, so, I mean.
00:09:11.286 - 00:09:41.782, Speaker B: What'S super cool about this is it's already here. I mean, I saw the chain smokers. It was just last week, just issued 5000 nfts for their new album using the royal platform. So this is all here, I think one interesting thing, and this was also surfaced in your report as well, and it goes back to the last panel. So if we're talking about read to read, write to own in web three, we need to talk about the thing, maybe call it a commodity. I don't know what exactly to call this thing that secures all of that ownership. And that thing is block space.
00:09:41.782 - 00:10:01.478, Speaker B: And Chris, I remember a podcast that we did back last year, the end of last year, and you said something that stuck with me. It's, I'm very bullish. Block space this decade. That's what you said. Why are you bullish? Block space? And how are you seeing that evolve across multiple chains, across ethereum, across layer twos?
00:10:01.606 - 00:10:34.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so the way I kind of, like, I'll try to keep this within 20 minutes, whatever we have. But I kind of think about the history of computing as the history of these sort of every ten to 15 years, you have a major computing wave from World War Two, you have mainframe computers, minicomputers, PCs, Internet, mobile phones. And in each wave you had kind of key new resources. So, like with the Internet it was broadband, right? And with, you know, PCs, obviously, it was like cpu. And, you know, you see it in the ads, like intel inside two point x, gigahertz, et cetera. Like, that's the thing. Right now we're in an era where people are building, developers are building on top of blockchains and they're inventing all these cool new things you can do.
00:10:34.400 - 00:11:40.186, Speaker A: But one of the scarce resources, as people know, who views these systems is the block space itself. Meaning on Ethereum, l one, that's reflected in high gas fees, on other blockchains, it's reflected in other ways. And so, of course, one of the key questions is, can we build enough of the infrastructure to allow the application developers to go? And the musicians we were just talking about to go and do these things in a way that's accessible to their fans and they have just good properties. You settle a transaction quickly, the gas fees are reasonable, the transactions succeed, it's highly secure, et cetera. So anyway, so one of the neat things we've seen, I think, in the last couple of years is we've seen a lot of innovation at the both l one and l two layer. And we'll have a few slides after this, which kind of help highlight this, this slide in the previous slide, so we can't show them together. The previous slide shows that there's a diversity of blockchain, specifically things like Solana and Polygon, which have much lower gas fees, and have, I think, in my job talking to application developers every day, I think they feel really excited that there's more choices now and that there's more kind of credible choices.
00:11:40.186 - 00:12:06.416, Speaker A: And you can see from some of the numbers that this has increased the kind of accessible user base as you might expect. At the same time, I want to make sure, since I'm sure there's a lot of Ethereum fans here, that Ethereum is still from. I think this is probably the best metric for measuring this. This is just total money spent per day, which is a reflection of demand. Ethereum is still far ahead on that. I think we're at a point, maybe we can go to the next slide. The other really exciting thing happening right now are l two s, which maybe we could dive into more.
00:12:06.416 - 00:12:29.524, Speaker A: But although it felt like we've been on the cusp of real l two s for a while, I think we genuinely are now. And I think in the next six to twelve months beyond, we already have, of course, optimism, arbitrum, ZK, syncware, et cetera. But I think there's going to be a whole bunch of features that roll out, that make them kind of more production ready, mainstream ready.
00:12:30.104 - 00:12:35.264, Speaker B: And you're confident, Chris, that we're going to fill all of this block space supply that's coming. Will there be enough?
00:12:35.424 - 00:13:05.364, Speaker A: That's a great question. It's a very interesting question. I remember very vividly it was 2003 when I was doing my first startup, Internet startup, and there were all these debates, like in the same way that there's debates now around blockchains, there were debates around broadband, believe it or not, for people that were not there, it's amazing. There were literally people were not bullish broadband. No, no. In fact, it was widely known that we overbuilt bandwidth. If you go back and look at it, all these dark fiber articles, it's overbuilt the.com
00:13:05.364 - 00:13:29.242, Speaker A: crash. If you go look at back at the numbers, it was actually much more around telecom than it was. I mean, a lot of Internet startups did bad too. But I think the amount of value loss with some, something like 90% was telecom specifically because the market said basically, wait, we way overestimated the demand for these things. And you have to remember 2003. Most people, I always like to cite a tv show, like friends go back and look, watch tv and movies from 2003. The Internet doesn't exist.
00:13:29.242 - 00:14:08.748, Speaker A: Maybe occasionally they go online, they go to the corner, beep, beep, beep. They do this thing, they go check their email. So basically you ask people like 2003, do you want broadband? And they were like, my email works pretty well. I guess it could be faster, right? There wasn't Netflix, there wasn't YouTube, there weren't all these other things. But what happens is, and this is throughout the history of computing, is as these new resources get built out, developers, people in this room who are much more creative and smarter than I am, come up with great new ideas. And how do we use these services? Economists call this induced demand. It's the effect of when in many cases, when you build more highway lanes, you actually end up with more traffic.
00:14:08.748 - 00:14:41.326, Speaker A: Why is that? Because people are creative and entrepreneurial and they build stores and houses and communities and whatever it might be. And the highway developer doesn't think of those things. I'm like the highway developer. I'm not going to think of those things. But I know they're going to come and what's going to happen is the same kind of reinforcing feedback loop is going to happen between blockchain infrastructure and applications that happened in the 2010s between mobile phones and applications. I mean, look at your mobile phone. I actually have my original iPhone from 2008.
00:14:41.326 - 00:15:05.260, Speaker A: I mean, it was like tiny little postage stamp. It wasn't as good in many ways, but really, the big thing that's. I mean, it's gotten a lot better. I want to dismiss that. The performance, the camera, everything else. But the big thing is different are the apps, right? I mean, it's also like, all I had was, like, three apps back then. I mean, well, both are important, right? The infrastructure got better and the apps got better, but those two things reinforced each other because entrepreneurs came along and invented Snapchat and Uber and Venmo and all these things.
00:15:05.260 - 00:15:27.390, Speaker A: Apple sold more phones, had more money to invest in chips and cameras. And it's this flywheel that happens. It happened before that with intel and Microsoft and Dell and intuit in the pc era. It happened in the Internet era. And so what? Those cynics in 2003, and this has happened over and over, by the way. This is the history of being. Working on the Internet, is the history of having everybody say, what you're doing is a toy.
00:15:27.390 - 00:15:48.438, Speaker A: It's a bubble, it's fake. It's just over and over. Like my partner, Mark Andreessen, and I joke about it. We just hear, literally this. I can't tell you how many times there was a decade when social media was a joke, and then suddenly it flips the switch and it's like, oh, my God, it's so important that we have to have geopolitics govern, and there's never an intermediate phase where it's pretty important or something. It's always like, it's a joke. You're a fraud.
00:15:48.438 - 00:16:03.214, Speaker A: Oh, my God, it's so important. It needs to be nationalized or something. Like, okay, so I guarantee you, ten years from now, it'll be like, okay, why do we have to. We need to nationalize optimism. Like, it's so important anyway, but right now, it's a. Anyways, so it's the same pattern over and over. And right now, we're in the phase.
00:16:03.214 - 00:16:24.712, Speaker A: I believe very strongly we're in this phase where we're kind of, you know, there's a lot of excitement. It's great to see all these people here, a lot of great ideas, infrastructure. You know, it's kind of like the airplane is shaking and, like, you know, spewing out some steam. Like, it's not perfect. But it's work. It's flat flying, and then we're trying to fix it in, the developers are trying to fix it in the air. But I am very optimistic on the infrastructure side and the application side.
00:16:24.712 - 00:17:08.802, Speaker A: The other thing I'll mention is our firm, I run our crypto group, we have a whole bunch of other verticals who invest in other areas. We've seen just a complete transformation in the entrepreneurial interest level of web three to the point of, I would say, and this is not just our firm, this is across tech. Probably something like well over half of all startups are now that, like, throughout the whole tech industry, from the investor point of view, like my friends who do angel investing, who are kind of agnostic with respect to sector, more than half are web three. So like, there is a lot of really good stuff coming. So in this report, I tweeted out today for those interested. What we're trying to show is like, look, we may be entering a winter now, actually. Do we have the slides with the.
00:17:08.938 - 00:17:54.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that. Just to go back to what you're saying, Chris, is there's another mental model to unlock. What is block space? It's ownership, bandwidth not being long block space is not like not being long bandwidth in the late 1990s. But I want to maybe end and conclude with this question, because this is top of mind. We had a rough week last week, and in some ways, from a pricing perspective, not from a talent inflow perspective, but from a price perspective, crypto is kind of down bad. Like we're down bad on the year. And so inevitably we're going to start to see, is this the end of crypto? Are like nfts over? Are all of these chains over? What are you seeing? Because this is a pattern that you seem to have identified, and there's some numbers in the report.
00:17:54.300 - 00:17:56.532, Speaker B: Tell us about this. Should we be worried?
00:17:56.708 - 00:18:44.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, so first of all, I don't want to minimize, like, startups fail, people lose jobs. Like, there's not, these things are never, you know, these kinds of volatile periods are never pleasant. I think zooming out and looking at the big picture, I've been in the space since like formally at least 2013. I led our investment in Coinbase and have been through now, I guess three of the downturns, 20 1415 was pretty brutal, 1819 was really brutal, and we may be entering another one. I think that with this slide, what we're trying to show. So my mental model has always been kind of what happens is that when prices go up, that generates a lot more interest. So your roommate thinks it's interesting to go check out and reads the Ethereum white paper.
00:18:44.714 - 00:19:26.364, Speaker A: The press starts talking about crypto more, whatever it might be, and that kind of crypto pills, a bunch more people. And then some of those people then decide they want to build something. And that might be an open source project or it might be a startup. And then startup. Generally those things takes a couple of years to build something, especially 2015 era, because most people were building blockchains, layer ones, infrastructure, which is just, those are complex, and then eventually those seeds are planted and then they kind of blossom a few years later. That was always my kind of theory. And with this project here, my colleague Eddie Lazarin, who's a data scientist, I said, Eddie, at one point a couple years ago, this is my theory, but let's go see if it's true.
00:19:26.364 - 00:20:30.754, Speaker A: And so he went, and for each of these things, did a very rigorous data analysis. So for developer activity, we went through all these various GitHub repos and looked at all the pull requests and things like that startup activity, this pitch book data, social media activity, this was like Reddit, Discord, Twitter, and you can't see it in the slide. But what's interesting is if you zoom into each era, it almost looks like, like each era looks very similar. But basically, if you look at the ordering, you do see sort of this causal linkage between, first you see prices go up and then you see social media activity, and then you see developer activity, et cetera. And so I really believe this is kind of the kind of patterns that we see. And what that yields is, although it's very chaotic per quarter, you said we had a bad week, it may be a bad year, but if you zoom out and you say, is this going to be a bad three years so far? If this pattern continues, and I believe it will, it's actually a much more kind of orderly kind of growth and progression than it would feel like when you're inside of it. I realize it doesn't always feel that way.
00:20:30.754 - 00:21:00.670, Speaker A: And I would say specifically now, like, the number of seeds planted, like, this is what we do in our day job. People come to us, we invest in them. We have a lot of other firms who do it. Like, it's just there's a lot of great people building a lot of great things. And the other thing makes me excited is that the infrastructure stuff just inherently takes longer. It takes years to build out, like an l one. Solana, something like this, like now a lot of the stuff people are building are much kind of, they're much shorter cycle times, they're games, media experiences, NFT projects, et cetera.
00:21:00.670 - 00:21:23.938, Speaker A: That might take, you fund them and they might take six to twelve months to launch and not three years to launch. So I think the cadence is increasing and I think that the kind of quality of the developer is increasing, the infrastructure is maturing. So I would just say not to minimize the bad stuff going on, but I do think if you step back and look at the broader trends, I think there's a lot of reasons to be very optimistic.
00:21:24.066 - 00:21:34.494, Speaker B: Amazing. Chris, thank you so much. This has been a real pleasure. I guess just in 30 seconds, if you could just give us final thoughts on the state of crypto right now in web three.
00:21:34.794 - 00:22:24.932, Speaker A: Yeah, gosh, what else would I say? I would say, I don't know. I just think it's a really exciting time. I get asked sometimes, why am I so fired up and flying to Florida and doing all these conferences and everything else? And I think for me, I think there's just very, I think you sort of, if you look at the computing cycles I mentioned, these are sort of 15 year cycles typically, and I believe in those cycles, there's like one to two year kind of golden periods. Go look at all the top apps on your iPhone. And I believe, I think all of them were 2009 to eleven ish, where the companies were started. That was the mobile golden period because iPhone came out in 2007, App Store 2008 takes people a year or two to kind of figure out how to build on these things. Then there's a sort of this influx of really talented people.
00:22:24.932 - 00:22:43.204, Speaker A: They build the golden things and then there's still stuff that's cool that came later, but it was much more kind of derivative because the core things. So I believe we are in that golden period now in web three. I do believe that. I think this is the time. I think the infrastructure is there, the talent is here. I think this would be a very special time. You don't get that many of these kind of times in your career.
00:22:43.204 - 00:22:52.264, Speaker A: I believe we're in that. That's what I'm fired up about. That's what gets me up in the morning. And so, anyways, I think it's a really great time and it's awesome to see all these people and all the energy here.
00:22:52.344 - 00:23:01.444, Speaker B: Guys, you're at the right place. We are in the golden era, entering the golden era of web three. Chris Dixon, give it up for Chris Dixon. Thanks so much for joining us.
00:23:02.394 - 00:23:04.914, Speaker A: Thank you. Absolutely.
