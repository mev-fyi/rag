00:00:01.560 - 00:00:18.714, Speaker A: When a consumer, a customer, a buyer, even just a loyal fan, can co own something with the brand. The brand owns the ip and the brand name, and the consumer owns the asset, it becomes the most powerful global affiliate program that has ever existed.
00:00:19.294 - 00:00:21.902, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire.
00:00:21.998 - 00:00:23.822, Speaker C: Really excited to be joined by two special guests.
00:00:23.838 - 00:00:33.704, Speaker B: We've got Camilla coming from Serotonin and Mojito. We've got Avery, president of Vayner three, a Vayner X company. Welcome, Camilla and Avery. Excited to have you guys here.
00:00:34.084 - 00:00:36.292, Speaker D: So excited to be here. Thank you for having us.
00:00:36.428 - 00:01:24.644, Speaker B: So, the backstory of this episode a couple of months ago, sat down with Adam Brodman from forum three, and he was. He kind of red pilled me on, basically, brands coming into crypto, coming into web three. And I think I've had this, like, really biased lens from someone who kind of got scarred by the, like, 2016, 2017, like, enterprise blockchain days, where whenever I see, like, a big brand coming into crypto, I immediately was kind of turned off by it, because. Because of those days five years ago. And I think this episode, I really just want to make it, like, I would like to kind of dive a little deeper down the rabbit hole of, like, brands exploring web three. Avery, you approached this from very much, like, have helped a lot of web two companies now, like, come into web three. Camila, maybe, like, the other side of this, which is you started very, very, very crypto native and have now started to work with some of the web two companies.
00:01:24.644 - 00:01:42.104, Speaker B: I think maybe a helpful place to go would actually be to Avery, I really want to hear, like, your definition of how you think about just, like, web three in general. Like, what is web three? And maybe how is it different from crypto? Because I'd just be very curious about how you think about that, and then we can go deeper into the rabbit hole.
00:01:42.644 - 00:02:27.116, Speaker D: Amazing. So I'm really excited for this discussion. And even when we were talking about what we should discuss here, I think Camille and I have a little bit of different perspectives, sort of shades of the same, like, long term ethos, but probably approaching this from two different ways. So, for context, listeners, I run a company which is a web three consultancy that's part of a large sort of enterprise agency. We do everything from Snapchat ads to Super Bowls to NFT programs and crypto advisory, all under this Vaynerx umbrella. And for the last 13 years, VaynerMedia, which is the core business within Vayner X, has been helping our client partners navigate ways to connect with their consumers. So we're obsessed with what matters to consumers and helping brands find relevance.
00:02:27.116 - 00:02:58.904, Speaker D: And sometimes that means through oth three initiatives. Sometimes that means through, you know, an Instagram ad or a TikTok or, you know, a new CRM strategy or an influencer program or a million other things. We created Vayner three specifically to help advise our partners on web three and on this sort of next iteration of the Internet. And not to correct you, but actually, we don't advise web two companies. We advise enterprises. The vast majority of our company partners have been around for way before the Internet. We talk about someone like a Johnnie Walker or a Budweiser or Pepsi.
00:02:58.904 - 00:03:33.906, Speaker D: These were all founded in the early 19th century. So our brand partners have been around for a long time. Most of the time. Sometimes we work with sort of new and emerging businesses, like a Coinbase who obviously hasn't been around for centuries. But most of the time we're working with enterprises who have established their brands over generations, over centuries, and we help them do what's right for growing their business. And a lot of times that includes web three. And when we were creating this enterprise, wanted to hire in a lot of web three natives to really teach us sort of the ropes.
00:03:33.906 - 00:04:03.696, Speaker D: I come from being like an enterprise brand marketer. Spent a lot of time at Target and at Google before joining Vayner on the brand side. And then we work with some of the biggest companies in the world on their marketing initiatives, thinking like $100 million budgets, you know, Super bowl ads, really, like full funnel capability building. And I got really interested in web three during the pandemic. I'd, you know, I'd been investing in crypto for a long time, but very passively. Like, I had a coinbase, but I actually had lost the password for, like, multiple years. And then I found it.
00:04:03.696 - 00:04:44.304, Speaker D: I had to, like, do the passport thing and like, oh, wow, that's a nice surprise. Okay, like, I guess I have something to start with as I got into nfts. And I think the reason that, you know, I was really interested in NFT specifically, and of course, Gary Vaynerchuk was as well, is we really understand brand building and, like, how to build a community and how to build a business. And nfts, I think because of potentially the visual aspect, the community aspect, that made a lot more sense to us than, like, altcoins and crypto. So we went a little bit more into this NFT realm. And of course, Gary launched the VFriends project in May of 2021, which was a huge learning experience. For us.
00:04:44.304 - 00:05:22.430, Speaker D: And we never like to sort of sell something that we haven't really been super hands on with. And that gave us that understanding of, you know, the Ethereum blockchain, how this works. A lot of the technical testing that, you know, you don't have if you're like an outsider or sort of like complete consultant. So very interested in nfts. As we launched the company, a lot of our client partners were like, what are you all doing over here? We're interested in this. And they wanted to learn. I think the first thing people come to us and ask about is like, how do I learn about what this is and why it matters? And at Vayner three, we take a more expansive sort of view on what web three is.
00:05:22.430 - 00:06:22.894, Speaker D: We really see web three is the next era of connected consumer behavior on the Internet. And I think there are a few things that sort of define this first being a digital first reality for consumers. At that sort of confluence of cultural relevance and technology, and powered by an ethos of co creation, web three is creating this more immersive, personalized and ownable Internet. And I think probably this more expansive view is a little bit different than what some of the purists would say, because we think it includes blockchain, but it also includes advanced computing, and it also includes immersive realities, because the more time people spend looking at what's actually driving tens of millions of users into Roblox, it's the same thing that's driving people into nfTs. It's community, it's co creation, and it's this sort of digital first reality for us. We see a lot of these things kind of coming together instead of being sort of two parallel worlds. So that is how we define it at Vayner three, and that's kind of what we work on with our enterprise partners.
00:06:25.794 - 00:07:09.698, Speaker A: It's funny, but there's a lot in there. My background, as Iano said, is definitely first of all, thrilled to be here. By the way, as they say, longtime listener, first time caller, and know both of you from over the years, so really fun to get together and chat. My background coming up through the web three world and that meaning sort of one of my first forays, I think it was actually one of the same moments that you and I, through Amanda Cassek, got really red pilled into the industry. But it was working initially for a company called Consensys, where we helped bring to market some of the core Ethereum tooling and grow Metamask's first million users. And some of the tools. And it was the same era where the application layer hadn't really been developed for blockchain yet.
00:07:09.698 - 00:08:33.422, Speaker A: And this is amazing use case that could unlock things, but no one really knew what that would be and where would be. Sort of the killer application for mainstream understanding, not to mention adoption. And the first thing really was currency, but people didn't really necessarily care to own their currency outside of the use case in developing nations and remittances. And so then when NFTs came around and big brands started to embrace the space and even some of the crypto native web, three native brands that have been built in this space, what you can do when you actually own a digital thing for kind of the first time ever, which is what blockchain allows, gets really exciting for global brands, because as Avery was saying, it just sort of changes the relationship between brand and consumer in a whole new, like kind of reimagining the DTC direct to consumer playbook. When a consumer, a customer, a buyer, even just a loyal fan, can co own something with the brand. The brand owns the ip and the brand name, and the consumer owns the asset, it becomes the most powerful global affiliate program that has ever existed because you have this network of influencers that are also owners and able to benefit in whatever the upside of them owning that asset is, whether it's taking it with them across the Internet. Potential speculative value.
00:08:33.422 - 00:09:15.104, Speaker A: I think we're moving ways away from that. The ability to collaborate more directly. For your definition of web three, I totally agree with it. And sometimes it kind of gets leaked in with people's definition of the metaverse these days, which I think, as you were saying, Avery is like a totally different thing. Like, there's a great Harvard business school podcast about the metaverse, and they don't even mention web three once, because it really is just the combination of your digital life together in a more immersive way where the platform walls kind of come down. But what web three is, is that ownership layer to the metaverse, and therefore that sort of interoperable layer that sits across all of it.
00:09:16.084 - 00:09:46.010, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to make sure. So really good intros there. I'd say one thing that I want to make sure we do with this conversation is like, I think there are a lot of case studies that you read or like, Twitter threads, and it's like, nfts allow you to own. You know, we're moving to an ownership economy. We're moving to, like, this digital first world. And I want to make sure we get a little more hands on than that. Avery, one thing I'd ask you is my conversation with Adam, one of my takeaways was, these are basically just loyalty programs on steroids.
00:09:46.010 - 00:10:12.106, Speaker B: This is just a ten x better loyalty program. Camilla, you just mentioned affiliate programs. This is basically just a superpowered affiliate program. Avery, maybe I'd ask you to dig into, in your conversations with brands, why are they considering this strategy? Is it to reach a younger user base? Is it to try to go more digitally native? Is it like, look, let's just test this out and see what kind of happens here. I'd love to hear, maybe take us into these conversations a little bit.
00:10:12.250 - 00:10:50.602, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think the motivating factor, and I'll say the motivating factor in 2021 was like, okay, I want to do something that gets headlines, or I want to do something that I can monetize. The motivating factor in 2023 is much more. I want to be connected to the next generation of consumers, and I want to understand this technology and I can potentially participate and how I can understand, like, where this is going. Future of the Internet is, like, incredibly important. And I think from, you know, like, everything that you read in any consumer study is, like, digital first reality matters more and more. Like kids today want robux instead of, like, physical toys.
00:10:50.602 - 00:11:21.858, Speaker D: Like, digital first reality is here. And it's like, certainly here for Gen Alpha. Web three, I think is sort of the culmination of all of that and probably a contrary point to camilla. I don't think it's all only on blockchain. I think we're going to see some centralized entities play in this space as well, because there's a lot of barriers when we're only, like, limiting ourselves just to blockchain. So when, and I think blockchain will be a huge part of it, and I think it's super important, but it's not all of it. From our perspective, what interest brands, though, is.
00:11:21.858 - 00:11:56.250, Speaker D: Consumers are here, younger consumers are here. And the Internet has fundamentally changed a lot of their businesses many times over the past 20 years. And they realize, okay, great, if this next iteration of the Internet, I need to be prepared. So many major CPG companies, financial services companies, were really caught off. Entertainment companies were really caught off guard by the massive changes that social media at first, like websites and then social media enabled. So they're like, okay, I need to understand this. I think a lot of them are really looking at this as, like, almost an insurance policy to make sure that they're connected with that next generation of consumers.
00:11:56.250 - 00:12:44.174, Speaker D: I think where brands in 2023 are looking is they want to make sure they don't get left behind. They want to understand, like, where, where consumers are engaging, how they want to engage, and they want to sort of build with them every sort of piece of consumer data from these sort of 20 and under folks. They want a more co created Internet and they want to participate and have a more direct relationship with brands. Sometimes that's manifesting in the way of like an ownable asset, but a lot of times it's more like, you know, giving product feedback, being brought into that, having that more direct relationship, one to one relationship of sort of community building. So I think that's driving in a lot of brands. The second part that I think is important is how they create new business models. And I want to make sure that I'm clear that this is far beyond just selling nfts.
00:12:44.174 - 00:13:10.568, Speaker D: Figuring out ways to monetize their digital presence and digital assets and connect with consumers in these new ways is also super important because people are spending less time in the more sort of traditional, experiential places. So I think connecting with consumers, driving their business forward in a digital first reality are the two biggest, like, driving, driving factors. And then throw in like a hint of fomo of like, what is that? What is Nike and.
00:13:10.616 - 00:13:11.136, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:11.280 - 00:13:13.440, Speaker C: Get the headline, Nike just did it.
00:13:13.552 - 00:13:14.768, Speaker B: We got to do it, too.
00:13:14.936 - 00:13:17.244, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. There's a little bit of that, for sure.
00:13:17.624 - 00:14:22.298, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think we're also seeing like, a lot of these consumer brands are about like 18 months in their education journey now because it kind of popped on people's radar like two years ago, maybe with some of the success of some people that came in and as Avery said, like, that additional economic, that first primary initial economic incentive of like, oh, my gosh, this is essentially a generation of like the crypto nouveau riche that are spending how much per wallet on these tokens? And there was sort of that validating aspect for the web three community when big brands like Adidas and others came into the space. And you can kind of tell from there, if you were to do like, a diagnosis of their successful playbook, that they were really going after the web three native crowd with those launches. For Adidas, for example, it was the only on chain experience. They partnered with G Money and Punk's comics. So they were really going after that native core crowd. And I think now with the maturity of education and doing some experimental projects, as Avery mentioned, that they've done like, dipped a toe in, maybe launched a project, maybe it's a free claimable.
00:14:22.298 - 00:15:45.564, Speaker A: Like they kind of get it a little bit more now. And so I think the two biggest examples of what we'll see in the next couple years are like Nike and Starbucks, where they're not just selling NFT products, they're building a web three enabled consumer community platform. And so the first thing you do when you get to Nike's platform, for example, is you mint your free swoosh ens. And so that's Nike getting like their own product in form of NFT into the hands like seeding their token community even beyond selling a digital product. And then you guys start to get into sort of those new business models that Avery spoke about, which is like bringing those NFT seeded community member into like co collaborating on a potential future launch or co designing a piece of the product line where they then get to share in things like, you know, revenue loyalty splits and cool things that sort of never existed before. And so that's after years of like Nike and Starbucks really, really exploring this technology, playing with it, understanding what it looks like. And I think a lot more brands that have sort of dipped a toe in that we'll see a lot of still newcomers but also return brands that really get it now and get what this can be other than just a new digital product line, although that's still going to be very important, but there's so much more you can do with it.
00:15:46.024 - 00:16:08.034, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that. I think what I would probably like build is Nike and Starbucks are two of the most, the biggest and most loved consumer brands. There are very few consumer brands that, like, you're going to download an app to have on your phone and Nike and Starbucks are those, right? Like, you're not going to do that for your favorite, like sparkling water brands that just like, isn't real, right?
00:16:08.534 - 00:16:09.254, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:16:09.294 - 00:16:12.310, Speaker B: San Pellegrino's got his San Pellegrino mobile.
00:16:12.422 - 00:16:13.874, Speaker E: They just got the bubbles. Right?
00:16:15.774 - 00:17:08.964, Speaker D: I'm a huge sparkling, like, I'm a massive sparkling water consumer and I wouldn't download an app for that. Right. But I think that for some really top tier brands, that's going to be a reality. But for a lot of them, and you all remember, or many of your listeners might remember, the boom of when every company had to have an app and then there was an app for every little thing that's like, this is the hair scrunchie app. Then it was like, why does everyone need an app? I think the participation is probably going to be more likely for the vast majority of brands is participating in an environment where people are already spending their time. One of the biggest challenges I think we have with these on chain experiences is a small group of web three native power users that isn't really growing very quickly. So if you're a brand who's trying to reach billions of people, you need to develop experiences that billions of people can actually participate in.
00:17:08.964 - 00:18:19.900, Speaker D: And while I think there was a lot of early success, including a lot of the work that we did with different brands, in sort of targeting these web three native communities, I don't think that that's going to be the method that most brands sort of lean into in the future outside of, like, luxury and scarcity. Like that can make sense. And like, there is that crypto nouveau reached crowd and there are a few hundred thousand of them. So it could be interesting for sort of small pilots. I think the future will far more be in the direction of building something that, you know, millions of users can experience simultaneously and can enjoy. And, you know, I think Nike's done a great job with Dotswoosh, but they've also done a great job with Nike landed Roblox, where they've had 100 million users, which is just a scale that would be unfathomable for something like dotswoosh at this stage. So I think sort of seeing those strategies as one is kind of interesting to think about how they're appealing to this sort of younger generation of consumers in immersive digital experiences and digital products as they also build this sort of web three native experience, which is aimed at people who are either crypto native or who are open to being sort of onboarded through Nike's swoosh identity product.
00:18:20.052 - 00:19:00.694, Speaker A: Yeah. And yet, I know Avery and I were just mainly playing ping pong, if you have another question. But to that point, actually, and this is what I would love to maybe dive into now or at a later point when we get into more of the tech side. But I think that's actually where we sometimes differ in our opinions, is that I actually do think ownership really matters of these assets. And so the blockchain element is crucial while, like the consumer behavior and the billions, what is it, 3 billion and 5 billion respectively, for like four. For Roblox and Fortnite, it's very real, the consumer habits there. And that generation just kind of gets like having a digital thing, but they don't own that, right? That's in a walled garden within the platform, and they can't really take it with them anywhere they go.
00:19:00.694 - 00:20:02.350, Speaker A: And so I agree, you know, Nike's in Starbucks. Starbucks is one of the biggest loyalty programs in the world already that they're able to weave web three into and Nike as a beloved consumer brand. But I think that this model actually unlocks the whole like, thousand true fans model. And I don't think that we will need to download an app for every brand that we engage with. Maybe if it's a more dynamic consumer community platform like Nike's building, for sure, because there's other experiences there. But even just sort of, again, for the, whoever it may be, the Pellegrino fans or like, you know, I know you're a big Fred again fan, like seeding that loyal community just with a token, whether it's an earnable or a free giveaway or a purchased NFT, then the fact that you can take that with you everywhere you go. I think interoperability is essentially going to become synonymous with digital ownership because bringing that data backpack with you of all the things you own across different programs will just seem so obvious in retrospect.
00:20:02.350 - 00:20:29.904, Speaker A: And so someone can buy something now that's either in a brand custodial wallet or that's off chain and kind of experience digital ownership for the first time. But the actual benefits of it, bringing it with you wherever you go and seeing unlocks other places, the collaboration opportunities available, that's the real killer app here. Because otherwise you don't really need crypto, you don't really need blockchain for it to own something.
00:20:30.364 - 00:21:26.360, Speaker E: Does that mean in some way like worry brands? Because like, I think of airline credits, right, which is terrible, right? An airline ticket in of itself. Like you want to make changes. Like you, if you want to use United points, I guess you can have the United American Express card and then you can, they have certain relationship with some brands, but they never want you to actually leave their ecosystem. And when you talk about portability, like, I agree with you from a consumer standpoint, we would all love for our points to be redeemable everywhere, anywhere. But that's not the case. And so I'm curious, in these conversations with brands like, do they see this as a threat where as soon as you open the consumer's eyes to this ownership and portability, does that somehow worry them or do they just accept? Exactly. That's what I'm trying to get at.
00:21:26.552 - 00:22:06.032, Speaker A: I've seen it. If I take, I've seen it, I don't think I've heard anyone see it as a threat because then it only gets more exciting on how you can evangelize the brand in other places. So like, sometimes the example I use when I sort of explain this to my parents or something, it's like, imagine going to a Yankees game at Yankee Stadium and buying a Yankees baseball hat, but you can only wear it in the stadium. So, like, you come inside, everyone sees your fan. But, like, of course you are. That's why you're there. You might get a discount for having that hat or buying that hat, like a discount on fries or something in the stadium within Yankees universe, but you can't, like, wear it when you go travel to Nairobi and get that other Yankees fan.
00:22:06.032 - 00:22:31.240, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. You're also a Yankees fan connection, that you bring it to another place with you when you go there. Or like, let's say Chipotle is having a free giveaway, free burrito to anyone that walks into their store with a Yankees hat because they love Yankees fans and they love the Yankees. Like, that's great. But again, you can't take that hat out of Yankee Stadium. So you can't even, like, bring it with you to Chipotle to get that benefit. And that's kind of the cool part.
00:22:31.240 - 00:23:40.244, Speaker A: Like that brand collaboration moment where you really do need to sort of prove, like on chain ownership of whatever that thing might be, whether you've earned it or interacted in any way with the brand, where you sort of gotten that token. That's sort of the cool part of the unlock right now. The benefit is really just to be able to kind of sell it on secondary markets and speculate on it. And that's when people, when they buy their first NFT, like the Reddit NFT onboarding experience, I think was so brilliant because they put a little, they abstracted away a little bit of that, like, private key management, really janky user experience at the moment. But then if you wanted to take advantage of parts of it being an actual blockchain based asset, like the composability to bring it into an open sea, a secondary market, then you would take that step. And right now, that's kind of the only real driving incentive for consumers to do. But once the other experiences get exciting and you have to have that thing in a wallet that's yours and controlled by you, then I think we start to see consumers starting to care about actual digital ownership in a way that they don't necessarily think they have to today.
00:23:40.244 - 00:23:41.680, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:41.712 - 00:24:19.774, Speaker D: Santi, I think that's a really good question. And I think what you're getting at is sort of the incentive, right? I think brains are always down to do collaborations like we do collaborations all the time of physical products creates cultural relevance. It's actually good for both parties in almost all cases. So I think everybody gets that collaboration. And as Camille's talking about, having, you know, doing an NFT that allows you to have a customized experience on a website or a customized discount, like, that's pretty amazing. And I think in the future that's really interesting. But these are very theoretical use cases right now, or they're just such a tiny size that it's not, it's not so meaningful yet.
00:24:19.774 - 00:24:49.364, Speaker D: I think that's the bigger question. And pushback and, like, consideration is like, this is amazing for 2000 people, but I'm trying to reach 2 billion people, Avery. So I don't know if this is where we should be investing. You know, like, how can we make this a bigger impact? A greater number of consumers is like, more of the challenge. And then I don't think they, I think there's opportunities when they would want to do it. So it's collaborative and can be a one plus one equals eleven, but probably not in all cases. Camille called out Reddit, so I'll give a shout out.
00:24:49.364 - 00:25:25.388, Speaker D: You know, some of the stuff that we've done with Reddit has been published. Like, for example, the abcs of nfTs. I think that's a really interesting experience. That is, in my opinion, the best brand NFT sort of program that's been built to date because it has sort of tiers of free of engagement based, of commercial based, and it was well received by their fans. So if you actually, like, read on Reddit, like consumer Research, their fans did not want nfts. People who use Reddit were like, I hate nfTs, please don't give me this shit. But they love snooze and they love interacting with other redditors.
00:25:25.388 - 00:26:14.616, Speaker D: And they're, their platform is actually very suited for Web three because it is sort of this co created community that is the ethos of Reddit. And of course, from a leadership perspective, we have folks like Alexis who are really into this Web three ecosystem. So I think they created something that was engaging to their core consumers. And that, I think really matters because when I look at a lot of the brand programs that have been launched to date, all the successful ones have been targeted towards Web three natives, and then they've been successful with web three natives or varying degrees of success with web three natives. I love that Reddit actually did something that was built for their community to do something interesting. The reality is very few people in their community are moving those assets off of Reddit yet. But to Camila's point, they're building something where they can do that in the future.
00:26:14.616 - 00:26:31.972, Speaker D: And I think that is really interesting because they're doing something that's interesting for their consumers today while building this opportunity to move into interesting things in the future. Look out for more potential collaborations and stuff there because I think Reddit's doing a lot of things right.
00:26:32.148 - 00:26:52.674, Speaker E: I guess, for brands listening, I'd love if you could share more of the findings, like in terms of engagement, retention. I mean, these are things that every brand cares about. Lifetime value of the customer, did it meaningfully increase or what were some of the other metrics that the Reddit team or the pilot kind of showed?
00:26:54.254 - 00:27:05.982, Speaker D: I don't think that they've shared any of that data publicly, at least that I've seen. Outside of the number of unique wallets created, which anyone can see because it's on Polygon, I think it's over 6 million at this point.
00:27:06.078 - 00:27:09.638, Speaker B: Reddit created 6 million new. New wallets.
00:27:09.806 - 00:27:10.630, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:10.822 - 00:27:12.074, Speaker B: Wow, that's nuts.
00:27:12.734 - 00:27:13.070, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:13.102 - 00:27:15.870, Speaker D: Which is amazing. The ones from reFerence, I think.
00:27:16.022 - 00:27:24.142, Speaker A: I think there's about 3000. Sorry, 3 million wallets created on Opensea at the moment. So to think about the scale of that, really awesome.
00:27:24.198 - 00:27:28.702, Speaker B: There were 6 million redditors who opened a crypto wallet or a web, I.
00:27:28.718 - 00:27:34.954, Speaker D: Will say they might not have known they were doing that. It's a custodial situation. If you go through the user.
00:27:36.854 - 00:27:37.622, Speaker E: Not.
00:27:37.798 - 00:27:40.542, Speaker D: Marketed as creating a wallet, it's a.
00:27:40.558 - 00:27:42.274, Speaker E: Great Trojan horse strategy.
00:27:42.814 - 00:27:57.606, Speaker D: Yeah, EXACTLY. And I think that's kind of LiKe my point, right, is. And even 6 million, by the way, if you look at the total number of redditors, I think it's like a hundred million. So it's still like a pretty small percentage. We need to fact check that. But it's a lot of millions. I want to say triple digit millions.
00:27:57.606 - 00:28:29.346, Speaker D: But these people are actually engaging with Reddit in this new way, which then they can move off platform if they'd like to do that. Though the number of people moving it off platform is actually very, very small right now. It could be larger in the future, and I think that's a really smart strategy for brands. Another one I'd give a shout out to is draftkings. Draftkings also, I think, has done kind of a similar playbook where they created an experience within their own sort of existing DraftKings ecosystem. Again, they have signed in people. It's literally a sports betting platform.
00:28:29.346 - 00:28:48.844, Speaker D: There's a lot in common with people who might be interested in the NFT ecosystem and world. And they've tested a bunch of different things from rainmakers, which is like a whole program they did to their marketplace. And they've also made it really easy for their community to participate in a way that feels native to draftkings users, which I love.
00:28:49.424 - 00:28:52.904, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, quick break from empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that.
00:28:52.944 - 00:28:54.336, Speaker B: I know you're going to love.
00:28:54.480 - 00:29:27.608, Speaker C: I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're onto app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks Research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform. So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something.
00:29:27.608 - 00:29:44.308, Speaker C: For example, I just built the platform. I can search for an L one. I can search for a protocol, pull up the platform@blockworksresearch.com. I search the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now, you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter.
00:29:44.308 - 00:30:12.856, Speaker C: Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their Twitter handles today links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform. If you are ready to subscribe to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup. Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code Empire.
00:30:12.856 - 00:30:20.564, Speaker C: Ten got your back. Check out the links in the description to find out more. Now let's get back to the show.
00:30:22.224 - 00:31:02.034, Speaker B: Avery, can you just walk us through a couple of the examples? And then, Camille, I want to ask you a similar question to you, actually, but what are brands actually, when you list out a brand comes to you, they're like, Avery, we want to build a web three strategy. And you're like, okay, let's do it. And they're like, okay, well, what can we do? And I guess the things that come to mind for me are like loyalty programs, like asset backed tokens. Like you can buy this and I think I just saw Louis Vuitton did this today. Connect a wallet across, like you go to swoosh or swoosh and you can connect a wallet like brand hosted secondary marketplaces. What is your menu of options that you give to the brand and how do you think about those?
00:31:02.714 - 00:31:34.654, Speaker D: Yeah, so again, it's sort of this more expansive definition. We think about the technology as being blockchain, as extended reality, or as sort of advanced computing. And the consumer use case is like crypto, it's nfts, it's social gaming, it's immersive experiences. Or it's potentially even like in the direction of like AI marketing. That's again where the consumer is the creator and then what they can do in terms of outcomes is like loyalty and rewards. D to c, community building, gather data and insights, engagement and cultural relevance. We try to not have things like off the shelf.
00:31:34.654 - 00:32:02.610, Speaker D: I think we always want to really be looking at what the brand is trying to do, what their objectives are, and then figure out how we can do something that aligns with those objectives, what consumers care about. And what's really interesting in this web three technology. I think web three loyalty is a big buzzword that we've been sort of hearing about. And Starbucks and Nike are both really pioneering in this space. But we haven't yet seen that hit effective. Like it hasn't hit yet. Right.
00:32:02.610 - 00:32:26.754, Speaker D: It's like super early days. It's too early to say if this has been wildly successful or not. We were talking about asset backed tokens, I think is a real use case within luxury. Like, you know, we've done some programs that are around this, especially in like the high end spirits category, where access to these spirits is actually hard. In like real life, you have to. There's like a whole gray market thing. If anyone's seen sour grapes, you know what I'm talking about.
00:32:26.754 - 00:33:08.604, Speaker D: But getting like fine wines and stuff, spirits like from the source is actually like an actual consumer challenge and problem. So nfts can do that. And there's some interesting partners that we've worked with. We've done this with a lot of the brands in the Diageo family, with Robert Mondavi. And that's been a really interesting use case that has sort of been proven. I think the community building aspect is one thing that we're going to be really leaning into in 2023 as using these groups for like focus groups. We spent a lot of money on consumer focus groups and like really leveraging web three, to unlock a community that can serve as an insights engine, I think is going to be massive.
00:33:08.604 - 00:33:25.764, Speaker D: And then, of course, like the sort of cultural relevant pieces is, you know, some of that is like very subjective, but depending on the brand and what they stand for, matching them up with the appropriate things to drive a moment of cultural relevance that connects into web three, I think, is a really good place for a lot of brands to start.
00:33:26.424 - 00:33:57.694, Speaker A: Yeah. And I would say in the brands we've worked with as well, it's kind of span the gamut of, there's so many things within here that we're talking about for high end luxury items. We've really seen kind of take off as one of the killer use cases. Right. Like digital art, fine art. That is sort of a very different thing than building out like a mass community engagement platform. And so we've worked with Sotheby's to help build out their whole platform and their entrance into this space with Pace gallery.
00:33:57.694 - 00:35:25.270, Speaker A: And that's really focusing on that part of that high end part of the market where these tokenized representation of a physical item or just a tokenized digital art that you can own for the first time. That's a really. I think it's part of the reason why it's one of the first use cases that the world has kind of understood about it, because it makes a lot of sense for traditionally illiquid or untransparent markets. And we're also excited to announce next month one of those redeemable sort of use cases with a publicly traded global leader in high end spirits. Because things that sort of trade freely kind of above their retail price, based on demand or speculation or scarcity, this asset makes as a use case, this text makes so much sense. And then I think that's just like a very different category than building out a high touch, low cost, maybe even an earnable or a free giveaway sort of thing like what Nike and Starbucks are doing that is supposed to bring people back to your brand and your platform and engage in it a lot over time in that way, that's kind of low cost for brands that cohort you're putting together. Avery is going to be so interesting because it becomes that collective consumerism, where fans of a brand start talking to each other in a more bi directional way than they can on social, which is sort of like more unidirectional, or how brands are used to communicating with announcements to their consumers, or announcements out to the wild.
00:35:25.270 - 00:35:41.194, Speaker A: And of course, there's chat rooms and things out there for super hardcore fans of SB dunks or whatever it might be, but owning a little piece of the brand together and a token that kind of can bring you together in the same place creates this form of community collaboration that is quite net new for brands.
00:35:43.054 - 00:36:17.004, Speaker E: I guess both of you are perhaps the two people in crypto that are closest to this helping brands navigate web three and strategy. I'm curious, like, I have two questions. One is what are some of the things that you would like brands to do and explore and they haven't done, whether it for some reason they are holding back or they're cautious or it's too early, but what are the things that you would love a brand to do this year that you haven't seen?
00:36:20.304 - 00:36:21.440, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:36:21.632 - 00:36:26.208, Speaker D: Because I pitched this to so many of my clients and they're all like, no, you guys both like, jumped out.
00:36:26.216 - 00:36:27.712, Speaker B: Of your seat ready to answer this in some.
00:36:27.808 - 00:36:56.024, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll share one idea that we've had, and I think I pitched it to, like, all the Vayner clients and Gary, like several times. So please, someone take this idea and actually go materialize it. I would love to, like, build, launch a net new brand. So first I want to give listeners some context. You know, Fortune 500s do a lot of acquisition of sort of new innovation brands is sort of how they frame it. It's like, hey, who like really leaned into using this platform? Let's acquire them. So we get these learnings.
00:36:56.024 - 00:37:45.934, Speaker D: This is a huge thing and a lot of CPG world, they'll sell for like many multiples. So I think it'd be pretty amazing. Instead of like, you know, buying someone who's already doing it, we actually build, launch a new innovation brand internally at a big company that is sort of based on web three from the beginning. So let's just say could be, it could be a sparkling water brand, right? We've been talking about sparkling water. How cool would it be to, like, get, you know, however many people want to be part of this as the focus group, as the evangelists, whether it's through an NFT or a token to, like, really launch this as a consumer built brand that can prove that this can be sort of done. Obviously, you have some logistical considerations to think about, like weight and shipping and formulation and all of that. But I think that a lot of the next sort of unicorn or next biggest brands will be built through this ethos of co creation.
00:37:45.934 - 00:38:51.324, Speaker D: And I would love to see a Fortune 500 go and like, actually spend a couple million dollars to actually go and develop and launch one of these in their own ecosystem. The reason why this hasn't happened, besides the fact that it's very early and it's a very speculative use case and certainly hasn't been proven yet, I think there's a lot of apprehension around regulation and I think that is holding back a lot of publicly traded companies from making a move into this space in a way that could be perceived as commercial. That's why a lot of our brand partners do things for free. They don't take any royalties because there's still a lack of clarity around this regulation that if you're a big target, you've just got to be a lot more careful than if you're a small startup who has a great idea. So I think that's the reason that it hasn't happened yet, but I am hoping we can make it happen this year. And I want to add that I think that's a very legitimate concern and I completely understand that perspective. Like, it's not worth it to, you know, make $2 million and lose 40 in a fine because, you know, the SEC wants to make an example out of someone.
00:38:51.664 - 00:40:05.534, Speaker A: Yeah, and I mean, from the tech perspective at least, you know, a lot of that depends on what the product is, what you're promising, what the market for it is. But certainly for us on the mojito side, you know, in building out, we have sort of our fully on chain offering and then we also have sort of a semi custodial wallet solution for new buyers. And so in short, depending on the brand's internal sort of setup and legal qualification, we have sort of a license from the creator to sell an NFT on the customer's behalf. And so to handle those fiat payments, those OFAC checks, the sanction checks, the tax calculating and filing, et cetera. So like all of those details that are becoming increasingly important as brand center, I think, and we'll see more and more folks paying attention to that over time, regardless of what they're bringing into the market, if it has any value at all. It's sort of how do you take on that risk and how do you work with a partner that can sort of help build that out? But back to the fun part of what do we want to see brands do in the space or what do we think is sort of misunderstood? I'm going to start sort of, I guess two things. One is it blows my mind that we don't see more brands owning their own branded secondary market.
00:40:05.534 - 00:41:13.104, Speaker A: A lot of brands have focused on how do they get that initial NFT into the hands of their consumer, whether it's again, free or an auction or an item for purchase. It's sort of a lot of emphasis on seeding that NFT, that token product into the hands of their community, whether it's web three, native or new. And I think this is the direct to consumer revolution that this tech offers. Why not own that entire experience for your customer and that secondary market and then offer the trustworthiness, the community interaction, be able to display your product. However, it should be seen even on a peer to peer secondary market. I mean, we all, I think, spend, you know, at least have spent some hours on opensea in these marketplaces where it's sort of the everything store, where in one place you're looking at, you know, real estate, physical real estate, metaverse real estate, gaming assets, amazing digital art pieces, collectible and consumables, like all redeemables, all these things in one place. So brands really owning that full experience, and then by owning the secondary, you can now own sort of everything that comes next, which is like those gates.
00:41:13.104 - 00:41:43.640, Speaker A: What do you put behind it? Is it an exclusive content? Is it an exclusive e commerce experience? Is it an interaction forum with each other and sort of get away again from the third party channels of like Discord and Telegram, where a lot of the, these brands flocked initially. And so thinking of it more as like your web three home base with that initial mint moment branded secondary, which I think we're going to see a lot more of in the future, and then how do you bring your consumer into that like collaboration element, which is what this tech really offers. And I think kind of just to.
00:41:43.712 - 00:41:53.066, Speaker B: Make sure I get it. So I went to the Porsche website when they did their mint and it was like NFT porsche.com, and it was kind of astonishing to me. The call to action was go over to Opensea.
00:41:53.170 - 00:41:53.498, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:53.546 - 00:41:56.898, Speaker B: What you're saying is like, you should keep them on, on the Porsche website.
00:41:56.946 - 00:42:08.218, Speaker A: Is what you're saying, of course, because then they can also operate 0% platform fees. Like, they don't see any of the secondary marketplace platform fees. Their consumers get hurt by that because they have to pay that.
00:42:08.386 - 00:42:15.810, Speaker E: It was largely unsuccessful launch. I mean, Jason, you're not going to go to Craigslist to buy a Porsche GT three. You know, it's, it's just, it was.
00:42:15.842 - 00:43:32.642, Speaker A: So off brand new and you surprisingly see it in a lot of global brands that have entered and you go and they either don't even link out to Opensea and you kind of have to get there yourself. But I think that that can really change this sort of whole experience and unlocking that education journey too, for what these assets can be and that sort of interoperability, unlock secondary markets being one of them and kind of related to that. And Avery, I'd love to know your thoughts coming more from the digital marketing world, but the data piece for me is just so fascinating because they always say, and that's sort of the benefit of why brands have been based direct to consumer, because you can own so much data about your customer age, date, how much they've spent in your platform, where they're based, roughly how active they are in your platform. I mean, it's funny how powerful that is yet how it's kind of affected trust in the era that we know interacting with brands. I mean, every website we go to when we have to, like, approve or disapprove the cookies on the site, like, it just feels like it's weird vibes that. And then that's at a trusted brand site and that's mostly managed by a third party data service. And that's mostly to the benefit of ad targeting, not things like hyper customized experience.
00:43:32.642 - 00:43:34.654, Speaker A: Next time I visit that platform.
00:43:38.054 - 00:43:38.622, Speaker E: Go ahead.
00:43:38.678 - 00:43:39.474, Speaker A: No, please.
00:43:40.294 - 00:44:38.984, Speaker E: That's something that I always want to get your perspective on, which is when you're pitching to these brands, like, obviously, like, cookies are kind of dead, or increasingly, like, if you're in Europe, it's very difficult, like, that pop up you talk about. But like, why haven't we seen, like, is there any reason why we're not going to see any store that you walk into? Scan with your phone, a QR code, get a free NFT, which just represents that you were in the store, and then maybe get some perks of personalization because they'll scan your wallet, they've seen exactly what you bought, they've seen your size four of whatever brand they already know, and then the rep gets alerted. It's a personalization experience, not so much advertising. They can offer you perks. I know it's in some people in crypto look at that and say, oh, my God, this is like panopticon, this is big brother. But the reality is, like, NFTs are like a perfect cookie. So what do we do with that is kind of the question.
00:44:39.064 - 00:45:13.930, Speaker D: I think so. I'm also obsessed with, like, NFTs as receipts, especially for luxury items. I love that. The barrier to that is honestly consumer adoption. Like, if more people had a wallet, then, like, more brands would do it. We've actually looked into this for several of our clients, and the adoption is too low right now for it to really be meaningful. And, like, we actually, like, do consumer studies, this type of thing, and it's actually confusing to people and it's something that they don't want right now, broadly, I think that has the opportunity to change, like, especially through more light touch things, whether it's a badge or a Po app or something like that.
00:45:13.930 - 00:46:06.222, Speaker D: That's a little bit more of like an easier onboarding. But I think the biggest barrier to what you just talked about is the total number of wallets who are active or people who think that, you know, especially when you get into, like, demographics beyond crypto bros, it's a pretty small number of people who are like, yes, that seems like something I would want to do right now when I'm at a store shopping for something. Of course, I'm very bullish on this and I think it'll happen, but we have to do it in such a way that consumers actually want that and they think it's a positive experience because right now I worked at Google and I remember in 2014, we were already like, oh, the cookie is dead. This was a super imperfect form of measurement. And NFTs, I think that's one of the biggest unlocks, is a better understanding of your consumer and what they're doing across the Internet. Of course, this has to be something that they get a benefit out of, too. It has to be mutually beneficial.
00:46:06.222 - 00:46:34.134, Speaker D: It can't just be like, here's this brand, like snooping on all of your digital behavior. There has to be some perk to it for the consumer. But in order for brands to invest in developing these out at scale, there also has to be consumer adoption, consumer interest. They have to be getting something out of it that's desirable because the current ecosystem isn't that easy for, for normal consumers to sort of participate in or see value in.
00:46:34.914 - 00:47:33.604, Speaker A: Yes, and I actually think that's where we're also headed. Like, I think these like, brands doing free NFT giveaways or having to be like a PO app or tied to a purchase in some way is so brilliant because brands don't really understand the web three data set fully yet, where they're used to the data they know. But in web three, you can see in theory, like all of that wallet spending habits across platform, all their brand affinities, how active it is, how old it is, how new it is, anything else it does, and maintain anonymity of the actual user itself in a cool way. And so, so far, all those cookies and a lot of that brand data. It's really mostly used for ad sales and targeting, which, like the brand, I guess, benefits financially from, but doesn't like love. It's not. And even with digital platforms across Twitter and Instagram like that followers, that digital followership, again, is mostly monetized through ad sales and ad revenue.
00:47:33.604 - 00:48:20.554, Speaker A: But when consumers sort of that NFT becomes cookies, as you said, Sandy, brands can then actually bring value back to the consumer in that customized experience, or by offering gated benefits, gated access, gated discounts, whatever it might look like, then you can actually sort of use that, that data in a way that feels much more genuine to the brand and way stickier and beneficial for the consumer. And it's the classic. Like, it's cheaper to retain your most loyal customers than it is to get new ones. And so you can actually use this as a way to sort of with a, like, you know, it has to be managed and teams have to set up, be set up to really do this. But in a way that's actually pretty low cost for the brand to offer that customized experience versus what they're doing today with sort of the cookie thing.
00:48:22.624 - 00:48:58.368, Speaker B: Can we get into a little bit about the tech stack? I'm just curious. I know, Camila, you all have obviously mojito, which helps to do this. I'm assuming one of your answers, Camilo, is obviously to use mojito. But I'm also curious to get your take on EVM chains versus non EVM and stuff like that. Maybe, Avery, I'll go to you to start here, and then Camilo, we can go to you is what is the tech stack people are using here? What are the brands? And maybe a good time to plug startups you've enjoyed working with. I'm just super curious, like, who's working in this space and who do you like working with so far here for sure?
00:48:58.416 - 00:49:20.144, Speaker D: So we work with a ton of different firms. Like, we really, Vayner doesn't have any in house technology that we sell to our clients. And that's sort of by design and intentional, because we want to be unbiased consultants who can recommend the right thing for the right partner. And, like, there isn't just one sort of size fits all from our perspective. So I'll start with. I'll start with. Let's talk about the chains first.
00:49:20.144 - 00:50:06.464, Speaker D: I think broadly, a lot of chains are being very active in their business development efforts for enterprises. And we talked a lot about brands. And, you know, at Vayner, we do work with a lot of brands, mostly Fortune 500, but we also work with like associations and talent and these like, sometimes governments, other groups that are like also pretty large scale chains have really surprised me in their business development efforts over the past. I'd say like last twelve months with being really active in terms of incentivizing some of these enterprises to adopt their chains. We, almost everything we've done has been on Ethereum or an EVM compatible option. But I think there are some like real plays that other, other companies are making. We've done stuff with dapper, we've done stuff with Solana, excuse me, DAPR with flow and Solana as well.
00:50:06.464 - 00:50:50.906, Speaker D: So those are kind of like where we're focused. I think that EVM is broadly makes sense for almost everyone, but there might be specific use cases. For example, we're working on something with NFL and Bud light. NFL already had their audience on flow, so it just made sense for us to design this pick'em program, which was like very, very successful to be on, on flow. And we worked with a developer partner there who kind of helped build the experience and the game mechanics. Other sort of like one stop shops I think are increasingly interesting for brands who want more of a turnkey solution. Big shout out to the guys at Moonpay and what they're doing, which really simplifies a lot of this and is easy for brands to understand.
00:50:50.906 - 00:51:15.930, Speaker D: They provide this sort of custodial wallet. They provide a minting experience through hyper mint. And obviously they have their core business which is around sort of like crypto, and then they have the concierge offering. I think they've been very active in their business development efforts as well. We've got the great folks at Mojito. I'll let Camilla sort of speak to all the stuff that they're doing. And I think that's kind of where like, most brands are gravitating.
00:51:15.930 - 00:52:18.808, Speaker D: Then I'd also bucket into the like, brands who want to kind of go all in and build their own stock. And that means you are going to need to be able to custody crypto, maybe own your like own your own nfts. Obviously you need like some multi sick wallets. I think the ledger team has done a great job with providing some really excellent, like, enterprise solutions for a lot of our partners and we've really enjoyed working with them. That's been great. So building your own stack requires some element of hiring developers who are training your in house developers and then getting a couple of pieces as part of your web three stack, which I think is like the folks who are all in, and then last but not least, I'll have a bucket for what I call the dabblers of brands who want to dabble to do something and might be interested in activation or experience. They might be working with more of a licensing marketplace kind of a vibe, a one of a recur those nifty gateway where they are just sort of a participant in an existing marketplace.
00:52:18.808 - 00:52:57.984, Speaker D: It's super rare sort of falls in this bucket as well. Marketplaces who are working with brands to kind of host that experience for them, which might be the right sort of first step. And we've done a lot of stuff there, like shout out to the nifty gateway guys. They've been great partners to us and helping with some of that. Opensea does a similar service where you can launch something on their marketplace without being needing to sort of develop your own tech stack. And then you also have sort of like point solutions, like a PO app or a token proof that a brand may work with on something that is, you know, that they don't need to develop a whole web three stack. Maybe they want to do a part of it and using some of those point solutions can make sense.
00:52:57.984 - 00:53:07.960, Speaker D: So that's how I probably bucket. It is like the one stop shops, the build your own, the marketplaces where you. The point solutions where you can kind of participate.
00:53:08.152 - 00:53:38.814, Speaker B: Camilla, can we specifically get your take on? I really want to get your take on, like, EVM chains versus non EVM chains, because I would say I am, like, thoroughly in the bucket of EVM chains, but I still see, like, flow doing a lot. I still see, like, brands choosing flow. And, like, obviously I don't know what that deal looked like for why doodles just chose flow, but I'm sure there was something going on there. Like, I still see people choosing some of these non EVM chains, which seems kind of like a short sighted move, but I can be totally wrong there. So I'm curious to get your take.
00:53:39.474 - 00:54:31.896, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So for those who are listening, EVM chains means sort of the ethereum ecosystem, ethereum virtual machine compatible, meaning things that are compatible quite seamlessly with ETH Polygon being one of the leaders there. There's some exciting activity on some layer two blockchains, like arbitrum for nfts recently. But basically, let me start here, where I do believe in a multi chain future, but I think the reality of the infrastructure to safely bridge across and move between these layer one blockchains is actually a bit farther away than we think. The benefits that you get from the Ethereum virtual machine compatible, EVM compatible world is that it's the New York City right now. It definitely has. And I love looking at the data.
00:54:31.896 - 00:55:15.844, Speaker A: Like when we talk about this and we talk about how big is the user base we're actually talking about. And even just for the last month of January, we just pulled all this for a very data heavy newsletter that's coming out. But even for the month of January, there's 430 year to date wallets, active wallets, interacting with nfts on Ethereum. So that's like a little less than half a million. It's about the same, a little bit more, in fact, for Polygon for the year so far. And then you see a big dip off for non EVM chains like Solana, BNB chain. I think there's like 35,000 active wallets this month, tezos even less at 20,000.
00:55:15.844 - 00:55:22.864, Speaker A: And then flow, which you mentioned, Yano has 18,000 active wallets for this year to date.
00:55:23.024 - 00:55:31.488, Speaker E: I guess on this point, like, we talked about arbitrum creating like single handedly 6 million new signups, mind you, like, maybe they're not active, I would argue.
00:55:31.616 - 00:55:32.432, Speaker D: Sorry, Reddit.
00:55:32.528 - 00:55:37.624, Speaker E: It's Reddit. Reddit, Reddit. So, like, yes, I agree with you.
00:55:37.664 - 00:55:48.788, Speaker D: Or else. To your point, though, if it were Arbitram, that's exactly where we'd be looking. At least on the Vayner side. We go where people are interested in shit. And that's like the reason why we're interested in EVM.
00:55:48.876 - 00:56:25.422, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess the point I'm trying to make is as an EVM quasi Maxi, just because that's where I invest most of my capital, most of my portfolio companies are. I mean, imagine a scenario where a brand deploys on avalanche or like Solana and creates like 20 million wallets and then some. Does that like pose a serious threat to ethereum, the ecosystem, or like flow, for instance? Because we talk a lot about. Yes, Ethereum has the developer mind share, but I mean, we're talking like very small numbers. Like this is like.
00:56:25.518 - 00:57:11.770, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. And the numbers we just talked about is really, as I said, like active wallets. And you can look into volume numbers as well, which are really easy to find. But some of the other reasons that I think we're all preaching to the choir here is like semi VM Maxis is it's also where most of the tooling lives. Like why it's sort of the New York City, Tokyo, Los Angeles combined of nfts is because you can do stuff there. Like you can take your nfts to different places, you can take them into open worlds like Decentraland, although it doesn't have a ton of active users at the moment, like, there's so much being built on top. It's like, what does that developer ecosystem mean? Sanji it means that a lot of people are building stuff, cinemas, shops, like, whatever it might be the metaphorical equivalent.
00:57:11.770 - 00:58:09.800, Speaker A: That development is really happening on the EVM compatible world right now, which is why we send our brands there as well, and which is why our tech stack is very focused on EVM compatibility at the moment. And there's also then the question of what is the difference in terms of just the decentralization and the longevity of some of these chains. And I'm biased because I grew up in the early ethereum ecosystem when the biggest new name on the block was EOS and everyone was like, oh my gosh, this is another l one. This was also during the era of the Tezos token sale in 2017, and everyone was sort of the battle of the l one S. And then you really realize that decentralization really matters and not having your blockchain stop potentially for a couple of days or for a couple of hours to fix itself. And we've spoken to brands, big sports teams that launched through FTX NFT platform on Solana, and those are now locked. Like, it sucks.
00:58:09.800 - 00:58:44.568, Speaker A: Their NFTs are now locked there. And so who's to say, like, this infrastructure is very early and these amazing names and amazing teams behind some of these other blockchains. Again, like, I do believe in a multi chain future, but, and I hope that I know these teams and even invest in some of them, but who knows to say who's going to be around in the future. But EVM compatibility seems to have the most case against it and been through the most sort of tests and trials and tribulations that it's a pretty good bet for these brands to build their home and start launching their assets.
00:58:44.616 - 00:58:56.044, Speaker E: Just to make the point clear, when you say decentralization matters, totally agree with you. Does that resonate with in the criteria of brands when they're evaluating chain? Does that ever come up or do you emphasize that?
00:58:56.784 - 00:59:40.474, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'd love to hear every answer. It's kind of been a meme in web three. Like, oh, is it decentralized? Decentralization matters. And folks that have been in the industry for long enough have unfortunately learned that it's not like that. It's not just a marketing tactic, but that's actually really important. And I think in the last couple of months, it's not been a great era for crypto with FTx and some of these headlines that are sort of making people think, is this whole industry just a little bit too early for us to get into? And so I think with moments like FTX, it has nothing intrinsically to do with crypto or blockchain, but does have to do with custody and, and ownership. I think they're starting to realize that these are important topics, but it's still in that early phase of education about them.
00:59:42.214 - 01:00:08.774, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's, it's loaded, right. And it's very nuanced. I think, you know, we for one, same point on multi chain future. I think the future is going to be multi chain and there's very easy bridges you can build. Like we've done this like many times over. If anyone, you know, is familiar with book games, that was actually unbeatable x and that was like a thing that you can build a little bridge. Even that sort of flow project I was just talking about with Bud light and the NFL, we built a bridge from ethereum.
01:00:08.774 - 01:00:44.274, Speaker D: So there are easy things that you can sort of do. So I don't think it's the end of the world. If a brand feels very compelled for one reason or another to go with something that is not EVM compatible, recommend EVM compatibility. But at the end of the day, I don't think that's like the hill we must die on if there's a specific reason. I just touched on this before, but some of these other chains are very active with their business development efforts. So if it's like, hey, if they're going to pay ux and, you know, that's your priority right now to fund the rest of the program. Like, I think it's something that we, we always want to empower our clients to make these decisions.
01:00:44.274 - 01:01:14.574, Speaker D: And I think decentral, we believe decentralization matters as well, but user adoption matters too. So I think it's balancing those scales, right, of like what is the total intended audience, what is the risk and making the right decision, sort of like based on a number of different factors. I don't think it's so binary in all cases. I guess, Jason, directly answer your question. Do brands care about that?
01:01:15.554 - 01:01:36.364, Speaker E: Maybe in my, correct me if I'm wrong, what I'm hearing is maybe they care more about, but they know that most of the users and the purchasing power lives in Ethereum and so they want to acquire those users. Like, if you're a punk holder, then reasonably speaking, you can also be someone that can purchase a Porsche, for instance. So Porsche would naturally want to deploy where you have your wallet. Is that kind of the thinking today.
01:01:36.784 - 01:02:01.226, Speaker D: Targeting web three natives with. If you want to make money, no question you have to go on Ethereum. Like that would just be like. It's so obvious to me that like you shouldn't even look anywhere else if you're looking for. I think the nuance comes when you're looking at a more scaled approach. Then you might consider something else, if that makes sense. I think you joined us a little bit late, but we talked a lot about targeting the web three natives.
01:02:01.226 - 01:02:14.054, Speaker D: Absolutely. You must be there, unless you're really trying to tap into some active Solana community or something. But I think that if you're looking for a broader approach, that's actually when you get more of a flow argument.
01:02:15.594 - 01:02:48.554, Speaker A: And I think it's. And also like so high value. That's why a lot of like digital art and high value digital art is also on youth, I think. But for again, it comes down to the goals and like, that's a very different category. Selling sort of a new kind of digital luxury item than it is to build a very like high touch mass adopter consumer platform, a community platform. Sorry. And so then we've seen a lot of brands embrace Polygon there because again, it is AVM compatible.
01:02:48.554 - 01:03:26.004, Speaker A: Low fees, very easy to build that project. Whereas as the Starbucks team says, it's not their intention for these NFTs to necessarily be speculative or have any secondary market value. I mean there may be because the nature of these assets is like, because it's so transparent. They'll always be a market. Like someone will always be able to understand the market of it pretty transparently. But that's not the intention with these sort of like earnable loyalty stamps, it's really for engagement and it's really for being able to give the consumer like new benefits that weren't possible before through this sort of token gating interactive model. And so I think that depends a lot on what chain.
01:03:26.004 - 01:03:42.572, Speaker A: And to what said about flow. Like, at the end of the day, web three is like a really bad house party right now. It's like people found out about it. It's like a college house party. Like, it sounds really cool. People found out about it. There's a ton of people waiting outside to get in, but it's hard to find.
01:03:42.572 - 01:04:25.236, Speaker A: Your stuff might get stolen. You've no idea where the address is, there's no bartender no one has a safe ride home. It's still very early, but the party's really. It's exciting. And so I'm hoping that in this time, before we get to whatever it is, another bull market or more brands coming in to push mass adoption, that's sort of, I think, separate from the token prices. We're figuring out the user journey now. Like, we, like capital w, we crypto, we web three are figuring out, you know, what is that wallet solution? Is it multisig? Is it MPC wallets? How do you abstract that? Sort of write down your seed phrase, but don't write it down one place, but don't tell anyone, but never forget it.
01:04:25.236 - 01:04:50.994, Speaker A: And, like, that's. It's a scary journey right now. And so hopefully when people do come back, it'll be, you know, great drinks, you could leave your shoes at the door, you have a safe ride home, you know where all your stuff is, you can leave your bag. It's not going to get stolen. But we're just, like, not. The tech is still working its way through that maturity cycle and it's largely been an industry built by back end engineers that are finally working their way up.
01:04:51.614 - 01:04:53.422, Speaker B: Yeah, almost made it all the way through.
01:04:53.518 - 01:05:05.934, Speaker A: Sorry, I was saying it's an industry basically built by back end engineers far that are finally working their way up the stack to beautiful and elegant user experiences. And that's kind of like what we're at the very beginning of.
01:05:06.094 - 01:05:29.854, Speaker B: Yeah, we have. I know we only have a couple minutes left here. I want to just every super interesting conversation, I will admit, like, a lot of this feels very v one. Like, I don't think what. I think this whole conversation has been very, like, here's what's happening now. I want to actually maybe wrap this with, like, 60 seconds for each of you to kind of give, like, the five to ten year vision. Like, when is like, maybe that's, you know, you log into Nike.
01:05:29.854 - 01:05:46.154, Speaker B: There's no more, like, username and password on Nike's website. It's like you just log in with your metamask or something like that. So maybe Avery pick on you to go first. Like, 60 seconds. Like, what is the bigger vision here? If you're a brand thinking about this and then, Camilla, we can throw to you to end.
01:05:46.654 - 01:06:25.344, Speaker D: I think the bigger vision is this co created Internet where users are empowered to vote on decisions to give their inbound in a way that is unprecedented and this is going to allow a new Internet that is more personalized, that is more generative, that is more ownable, and thus is going to create this new relationship between what consumers love and them, whether that's a brand or that's a band or that is a person that they're a fan of. I think this allows this whole new generation of connected activity that is all driven by this sort of ethos of wanting to co create the next version of the Internet together.
01:06:27.884 - 01:07:12.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of it actually does have to do with our increasingly digital lives. And what folks call the metaverse is like, I don't know, but when I tell people I spend like 15 hours a day in the metaverse today, it's just across, I don't know, 300 different websites and apps and slack and email and gaming and e commerce and everything. And it's a terrible experience. It's all text based and more importantly, like, nothing in it I own yet I don't own any of that. I don't own my data, I don't own the cookies, I don't own my experience. Like, I own what physically I buy through the platform, maybe, or like I might own subscriptions to software and stuff. But like, in this world of actual digital ownership, like, most of the things we own in our lives now are made by brands.
01:07:12.604 - 01:08:04.894, Speaker A: And as our digital lives become increasingly experienced, I think, of course a lot of the things we own are going to be made by brands as well. But I think it's just going to completely change the relationship between brand and consumer in a way that's much less value extractive, much more like co creation, much more engaging, much more rewarding. And so it's logging on to British Airways to book my flight as a silver member and knowing that I prefer Isle and my food choice, and then also maybe having to book on american or United or a different area and them knowing that I'm a silver member in BA and then maybe offering me better discounts and trying to get me over to their platform in that way. And so I think the collaboration opportunities is kind of hard to predict because they're pretty limitless once you can sort of own digital brand items for the first time. And that's what, it's really exciting.
01:08:05.794 - 01:08:12.904, Speaker D: One other thing I'll throw on is this more ownable Internet that you, you can, that allows the personalization. It all kind of like, works together.
01:08:13.444 - 01:08:14.036, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:14.140 - 01:08:17.252, Speaker A: Wallet connect everywhere on every website, the whole Internet.
01:08:17.308 - 01:08:36.944, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, Avery, Camilla, this was, this was awesome. I think this was a really good primer on, like, basically, how should brands think about web three? How our brands think about web three? I have a feeling we'll do this again in like, six to twelve months, once all of the things that you are working on today have been announced and are out in the public. So really excited about this and, yeah, thanks for coming on Empire.
01:08:37.594 - 01:08:38.714, Speaker D: Thank you so much for having us.
