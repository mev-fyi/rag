00:00:00.160 - 00:00:34.980, Speaker A: I think eventually it plays out where crypto is ubiquitous from a financial services perspective. But I think so that's way that'll be way bigger than 10 trillion in the sense that it'll encapsulate all financial assets in the world. But I also think that along that path you're going to see new business models pop up and innovations pop up that we never even thought about. Anytime you reboot a system, that's where a lot of opportunity lies. And so this is a reboot of the financial architecture, which doesn't change that frequently. And this is it and we get to live through it. It's cool.

00:02:58.044 - 00:03:06.484, Speaker B: CEO and CIO of One River Asset Management. Eric Peters back with us. Hasn't been on the show since I think summer of 22 had to, had.
00:03:06.492 - 00:03:07.668, Speaker C: To have him on post election.
00:03:07.724 - 00:03:07.892, Speaker A: So.
00:03:07.916 - 00:03:08.900, Speaker C: Eric, welcome back.
00:03:09.020 - 00:03:11.428, Speaker A: Hey, thank you. Awesome. Great to see you guys again.
00:03:11.564 - 00:03:15.534, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, good to have you back with us. Okay, easy place to start here.
00:03:15.622 - 00:03:17.086, Speaker B: Election just happened.
00:03:17.118 - 00:03:18.222, Speaker C: Bitcoin at an all time high.
00:03:18.246 - 00:03:19.310, Speaker B: The S and P just had its.
00:03:19.350 - 00:03:24.798, Speaker C: Best week of 2024. Also hit an all time high. Risk appetite is clearly back on.
00:03:24.854 - 00:03:26.302, Speaker B: Animal spirits back in the market.
00:03:26.406 - 00:03:34.970, Speaker C: Would love to just hear like very broadly, I mean, how, how are you thinking about the world and obviously markets right now?
00:03:36.870 - 00:04:12.046, Speaker A: Yeah. God, I mean, so much has changed for this election. I, and I wrote about a little bit this weekend. I think that when the world changes this abruptly, it takes time for portfolios to reposition. And I think crypto will be even more so than traditional markets. But if you look at the pollsters coming into the election, even though the prediction markets were running ahead for Trump, the pollsters were expecting the tightest election in U.S. history or modern history anyway.
00:04:12.046 - 00:05:01.472, Speaker A: And if you use that for a proxy for how large allocators of capital are positioning their portfolios, it just tells you that on average, and these people tend to kind of travel in packs, on average, people are pretty close to home. No one was making big bets on Trump. No one was making big bets on Kamala. If anything, the bets that they had on were for status quo, which meant that their bets were leaning more toward an extension of the Biden administration. Right. Just because that's the operating environment that all these investors and portfolios were in. And so to come up with landslide might be too strong a term to describe Trump's win, but more or less based relative to expectations, it is.
00:05:01.472 - 00:05:30.182, Speaker A: So now that that's happened, I think people are, you've got to be scrambling and going back to the drawing board and saying, what does this mean for my portfolio? And I think what they're going to conclude is it means, it means that things need to change a lot in people's portfolios. So really exciting period for a macro investor. And then as I mentioned, crypto, I think, is crypto like, like Crypto always is. That reality is amplified for crypto, but it applies to all asset classes.
00:05:30.326 - 00:06:18.880, Speaker D: So, Eric, I remember my impression when you came on the POD a couple years ago was your ability to crystallize gains in a market. And that's really hard. I think just in crypto, but just in general, you talk about people really getting the election wrong. And just from pollsters, how do you translate that into just broadly investing? Like, people were positioned, sidelined in crypto for a variety of reasons, but just in general in markets. Like, does that tell you markets are just incredibly inefficient? It's just become harder to be an investor. Like, we're connected, but the information's just bad quality. Like, how do you think about the job as an investor, professional investor, institutional investor, and how people have gotten it very wrong? And you would think that that would have changed because maybe the information is just more, you know, pervasive and whatnot.
00:06:20.340 - 00:07:18.330, Speaker A: It's always hard to be an investor. You know, if you read back, I think the first investment book that I read was written by this really famous or written about this really famous speculator, Jesse Livermore, back in the roaring 1920s. And the lessons that he described in that relative to the lessons that I feel like I've lived and learned over the course of my career, they're kind of the same, you know, so information sources shift around. I think what's happened in poly markets, really, you know, it's great. It's like, here's this new information source that most people scoffed at. I was kind of somewhat reserved about it because I, you know, I know markets that can be easily manipulated usually are. But as we came closer to the election, like, it's easy to manipulate a market way in advance of something as you get closer and closer and there's a lot of money on the table.
00:07:18.330 - 00:07:59.738, Speaker A: Like markets don't they stare into the whites of the eyes of potentially losing a lot of money for just manipulating it, and things start getting honest. So it was really interesting to see how those markets behaved, and they were right. And so I think you're always shifting to new sources of information. Some of these quant shops, they started some years ago looking at satellite information of parking lots at Walmarts to see what the sales would look like. Smart people are always hunting for something new. And so I don't think investing has become easier or harder. If anything, things are always getting a bit harder because the competitive environment is more and more.
00:07:59.738 - 00:09:01.722, Speaker A: And after many years or decades of bull markets, you tend to get more and more smart people spending their careers in markets as opposed to, I'm sure I wasn't trading in the early 80s, but I'm sure after the 70s bear markets, a lot of smart people were, were going into different industries as opposed to coming into finance. But at this stage a lot of really smart people are in finance and they use a lot of programming and big data sets. So it's hard. The hardest thing I think will continue to be to try to identify, and this has kind of always been the case for markets is try to identify something that hasn't really happened before. And this election is kind of a little bit like that, to be honest. It certainly had something like this happen a long time. So when, when you can identify something that you think might happen that hasn't really happened before then, and you're right about it, that's where you can make a lot of money.
00:09:01.722 - 00:09:05.098, Speaker A: And so, you know, maybe that leads to where we are right now.
00:09:05.234 - 00:09:20.700, Speaker C: Yeah, well, so you mentioned polymarket and you mentioned this is a thing that hasn't really happened before. Can you go deeper into how you're thinking about like societal overton windows shifting and like what, what like the, the magnitude of what has just happened in the last week?
00:09:21.480 - 00:09:55.270, Speaker A: Yeah. And you mentioned just when we were chatting pre call about the Overton window, which is kind of cool because I didn't even know what that meant about five or six years ago. And someone mentioned to me I love learning new things. I was like, that's an amazing term. And I think the Overton window has shifted in all sorts of things across society over the last five, 10 years. And I think that process really kind of started with Brexit and Trump his first term. All sorts of things have shifted.
00:09:55.270 - 00:10:59.054, Speaker A: I think what's really interesting that's been shifting over the last few years really is just that affects our markets, affects crypto, affects tradfi markets, is that there's been a shift around is the economic orthodoxy of the last few decades, which is the entirety of my career. I started in 1989, maybe a few years before you guys were active, maybe born. So I started. And throughout that whole period of time there have been all these assumptions about how the world works, how economics work, how trade alliances work, the importance and goodness of globalization for society at large. And like there have been all of these assumptions that have just. They're just assumptions, but they have been viewed as being, as being given to a reality. And they're very.
00:10:59.054 - 00:11:54.710, Speaker A: And so we call it kind of the orthodoxy and that's starting to change. Right. So we started to see during the first Trump administration this idea that, hey, actually we can go out and we can put tariffs on China and they're not playing fair. Well, you know, behind the scenes, I was listening to CEOs talk about how unfair trade was or how their IP was being stolen for years, but no one kind of was prepared to say it because they wanted to make sure they didn't interrupt their sales in China and that, you know, they were kind of things were being stolen at the same time they were getting revenue. And so no one really wanted to speak the truth, in a way. And so I think what's been happening is people have become much more prepared to call into question these things that we have expected to never change. I think a lot of that, I think we're going to see even more of that during this next Trump administration.
00:11:54.710 - 00:12:01.190, Speaker A: And those are the types of things that really do change markets and change the way the world works.
00:12:02.330 - 00:12:34.850, Speaker D: Yeah. So the market has reacted pretty, I don't want to say aggressively to the election outcome. You could argue it's not as aggressive or it is, depending on. You can ask a bunch of people. How do you think about re underwriting your thesis under the incoming administration? How quickly do you update your thesis? Do you update your portfolio? And I'm just kind of curious what went through your mind when Trump won and how you're thinking about just positioning your portfolio.
00:12:35.910 - 00:13:24.450, Speaker A: So we don't, we tend to not talk specifically about what we're doing in the portfolio, but I'll talk in very, very kind of broad way about how I looked at the election. And this is informed by conversation I'm having with people who are very close to administration, helping craft policy. It's, you know, drawn on what I read. And I think X is becoming a more and more valuable source of information. I find myself spending more and more time on, you know, on X, just looking at, I don't know, could be. It's like understanding what Vivek is thinking about and Elon is thinking about and these, you know, these are people that are going to have a real influence on what happens. So at any rate, I think.
00:13:26.940 - 00:13:27.252, Speaker B: I.
00:13:27.276 - 00:14:11.672, Speaker A: Think basically what's going to happen now that Trump has won is the US Is going to make a bet. And I think relative to the potential bets that we can make, I think it's a smart bet to make. So, you guys, I listened the last podcast that you just had. You were talking about Paul Jones and maybe Druck and the concerns they have around debt and Those are obviously major concerns for everyone. Like you can't just look at the fact that we're running 7, 8% deficits with an expanding economy and forecast for those deficits to not really come down more than a couple percent over the next couple years and then they go right back up to the highs. And that's without a recession. Right.
00:14:11.672 - 00:14:53.616, Speaker A: So if we had a recession, we would end up with deficits that could be like 10, 12, 13, 15%, depends how bad it is. And this is with debt to GDP at 122%. So we're in a pretty precarious position from a debt perspective. The question is what do we do about that? And then it's interesting, we can also talk about, if you want later, what other countries, how are they thinking about it? But I think in the U.S. here's what we're going to do with it, or here's what I think the Trump administration will do with it. I think that they're going to push hard to substantially increase the supply of energy to try to push, the price is down. There's going to be very significant deregulation that takes place.
00:14:53.616 - 00:15:33.598, Speaker A: And I think Trump is pretty hamstrung in the first administration from some of the things he wanted to do. I think he'll be much less hamstrung in that regard this time around. So have a lot of deregulation. There's going to be a big push to accelerate AI to the greatest degree the private sector is able to. And that means providing the infrastructure and the reasonably priced or cheap energy to drive that. And you look at all of the, and then all the tax hikes that might have been baked in like those are, all the old tax cuts are going to get rolled out. So, and they're probably going to be new tax cuts, they're probably lower corporate tax rates.
00:15:33.598 - 00:16:26.730, Speaker A: It's an incredibly bullish environment for US Business. And the hope there is that if we can potentially get to a place where AI is able to help boost productivity here domestically, and we're throwing this business friendly environment at the economy and you get animal spirits going, you might end up in a position where real GDP starts growing, you know, way above where it's been for the last couple decades. And I think they're thinking if they can get real GDP in the 4 or 5% range, even for a few years, these debt issues go away. They don't completely disappear, but they, they, they fade from prominence, let's put it that way. So I think that's the plan.
00:16:27.590 - 00:16:53.032, Speaker D: Yeah, I Wanted to go to the second part of your statement there, which is discussing other countries and what they might do. A couple of just thoughts there is like how does Japan dealt with it? Or how does Europe dealing with it? But more so also countries that hold a lot of their balance sheet in US Treasuries like China and what, how they're responding kind of in real time and what that means for kind of the US as a dollar, kind of as a global reserve asset, so to speak.
00:16:53.176 - 00:17:46.090, Speaker A: Yeah, Europe is a super, Japan's interesting. Europe is super interesting because I think Europe's more dynamic because Japan, Japan's been kind of doing the same thing my entire career, which is their stock market recently took out its 1989 highs. But their stock market peaked the year I started trading and they had a real crash. There are a lot of forces at work there. Some of them are demographic and their population growth really slowed and then ultimately working population started shrinking. And they've had all sorts of issues to deal with over the last 30, 40 years. But the first thing that they did when their market crashed in 89 was they basically tried to underwrite it and say, okay, we're going to try to ensure that no one really fails here.
00:17:46.090 - 00:18:33.494, Speaker A: And so they ended up ensuring that there weren't massive failures and a huge depression which they probably, which probably would have been healthy economically for them just to kind of wipe out the excess, but they just didn't. And so they had to kind of grow their way out of that over 40 years and it created a really non dynamic economy and pretty boring markets and awful stock market really. So that's kind of what Japan has done. I think they're still more or less trying to do the same thing. They continued on with big budget deficits for ages. They have huge debt to GDP ratio, they continue to run large deficits and whatever. Japan is a relatively small player compared to Europe or compared to China at this stage and certainly compared to the U.S.
00:18:33.494 - 00:19:28.410, Speaker A: europe is really interesting because Europe has, Europe's a big, you know, Europe's a big place, its GDP is quite large, population is big and it has really stagnated economically. If you look at the top 25 market cap, I use this as I like markets as proxies for anything as opposed to economic data. If you look at the top 25 companies by market cap in the world, one of them is European and it's a drug maker and it made zempic or whatever, you know what, some, some amazing drug that helps people not get, you know, get skinny if they're fat, like, if you can solve that problem or help people are getting bald, grow hair back, you make all the money in the world. So they have figured that out. They've got one company and that's it. 21 of those 25 companies are us. One of them is, is Chinese, it's Tencent.
00:19:28.410 - 00:20:24.064, Speaker A: One of them is Taiwanese, it's tsmc. One of them is Saudi, it's Saudi Aramco. So it's, it's basically the sovereign. So, like, if you look around the world and you look at the, this huge pool of population with a large economy and no, you know, no big companies really, it tells you, it tells you that their model is pretty, I don't say broken, but it's certainly not dynamic, it's not entrepreneurial. It's not evolving in a way that's, that's bringing wealth into that region. And so Draghi, Mario Draghi, who you guys might remember, used to be the ECB chief, he was, and he's a, you know, very credible guy, very smart guy, Italian Goldman guy. He was charged with coming up with a big comprehensive report on EU competitiveness.
00:20:24.064 - 00:21:00.492, Speaker A: And so he came out a few months ago and he said, okay, here's what Europe faces. It faces an existential crisis like it hasn't seen since the Cold War. And part of that is economic, and part of it is the fact that they've got a war on their border right now. And so his view is Europe economically needed to spend 4.9% of GDP every year in stimulus to just kickstart the economy and bring innovation back to Europe. Now, I sincerely doubt that the government is going to bring European innovation back, but that was his proposal. On the other side of the table is the ecb, which is the equivalent of their Fed.
00:21:00.492 - 00:21:29.936, Speaker A: It's the European Central Bank. And they have come out within months of that report. And they said, what we think needs to happen is that Europe needs to consolidate its fiscal balances by, by 3% a year. And because of population growth dynamics and things like that, you probably need to add another 2% a year so that they need to fiscally contract by 5% a year. So you have, you have one guy saying they need to expand by 4.9% a year. You've got the central bank saying we need to contract by 5% a year.
00:21:29.936 - 00:21:59.380, Speaker A: That's a 10% swing. To me, that's a incredibly confused region that is dramatically underperforming economically and in markets. And so now imagine the US presses the pedal, which is what we're about to do economically, imagine what's going to happen with Europe. I mean, I'd love to hear what your perspectives would be on that. I have some opinions around that, but I think I haven't seen something that dramatically different between the two largest economic blocs in the world in my career. Nothing even remotely close to that.
00:21:59.680 - 00:22:34.764, Speaker D: Yeah. I think what I get excited about is, I think the answer to any potential fiscal deficit or precariously like, you know, budget situation, which we all know is true, is you, you innovate your way out of it through productivity gains. And the answer to that from a government perspective is just deregulation. What the US has done best historically to position itself as a leading country in the world, which is, as you pointed out, the best companies in the world have started in the United States, are based in the United States. A lot of them started by immigrants. Like, it is aspirational still to come to the U.S. it has the best system for a variety of reasons.
00:22:34.764 - 00:23:12.102, Speaker D: And so I think you just have to continue to press on that advantage. And crypto is becoming a non, small, non trivial component of innovation. And so if you, you know, AI and crypto combine, like, you know, now we're going to have hopefully eight years or just four years of less friction to innovate in a space that is really exciting. And, and AI as well. And so less government, I think, is always a solution. And our allocators going to put a lot of money into Bitcoin and abandon the dollar? I don't think so. I think you just want to beat inflation and you beat inflation by allocating to sectors that outperform that.
00:23:12.102 - 00:23:20.310, Speaker D: And that's likely not going to be real estate or some old economy kind of businesses. More likely going to be tech, I think.
00:23:20.430 - 00:23:23.090, Speaker A: Very well said. Totally great.
00:23:23.880 - 00:23:38.860, Speaker C: Eric, I have a question based on what you said earlier about, I mean, we could be in a historic bull market with Trump's victory here and things are going to go, I mean, maybe animal spirits are back in the market. Do you think the Fed declared victory too early here?
00:23:40.120 - 00:24:26.230, Speaker A: I do, yeah. But also remember, the Fed has been operating with the information that had a hand. So it didn't know, it didn't know what was going to happen in the election when it started this, the cut cycle. And the Fed tends to just get on a schedule. I think that there's a real possibility that they've made an error and they did move too quickly. There are certainly people within the senior Republican Party who think that as well. And I think that I Think Powell, I mean, you saw when he responded, I assume recently with his no and no comment, essentially saying that he wouldn't step down.
00:24:26.230 - 00:25:32.490, Speaker A: I mean, he's a very smart guy. I know it's fun to make fun of central bankers and I do all the time, but he's a very smart, thoughtful, serious guy and I think that's going to set up a real conflict around Fed independence. So you talked about the Overton window shifting, I think and I mentioned that I think a lot of things are going to change. One of them I think is going to be question in all areas of economic orthodoxy. One of those is what is the role of the Federal Reserve in this economy? And it's hard for me to wrap my head around thinking that we would be better off with a less independent Fed just because I'm steeped in orthodoxy. Because it's just been, you know, I'm trying to open the Overton window up on myself, not because I think we should change what happens the Fed. I just want to make sure I have my head wrapped around what the world looks like if we do change that, you know, call into question the independence of the Fed.
00:25:32.490 - 00:25:42.068, Speaker A: I don't know that that will happen, but, but anyway, yeah, that's, I think that's, that's now, that's now on the table along with a bunch of other things.
00:25:42.204 - 00:26:00.356, Speaker C: Yeah, so what, I mean, how does this play into your ideas on, you mentioned the deficit and just this debt crisis. Like, you know, we have, we have what, 30, 30 some odd, 35 or 36 trillion in debt. Growing, growing by like what? Probably I think it's a trillion every hundred or so days right now.
00:26:00.428 - 00:26:01.892, Speaker B: Like where does, where does this go?
00:26:01.916 - 00:26:19.760, Speaker C: And yeah, you mentioned, we mentioned Paul Tudor Jones on the show the other day and I'd, I'd re quote him and just say, you know, he, his take on this is, look, the only way to get out of this is to inflate our way out of this. You know, buy the nasdaq, buy Bitcoin, buy gold, buy commodities, don't buy fixed income. Curious to get your take on the, on the whole solution?
00:26:20.260 - 00:27:14.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just in general, I'm not really a fan of fixed income and I know I don't speak for all investors by the way. I just, I don't know. I think in so many respects fixed income through, throughout history just reflects a lot like people invest in fixed income. This is going to offend some people, but it's just kind of, you kind of lack imagination so. Or ambition like it seems to me the, the best thing that you can do is, you know, build, build companies, build things that have value. And if you can borrow money to do that reasonably without overlevering yourself, that's what you should do. So in that sense, I'm kind of emotionally and temperamentally always a seller of fixed income to try to build things.
00:27:14.830 - 00:28:11.798, Speaker A: I think there are times in the economic cycle where it's beneficial to own fixed income and there are times where it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to own fixed income. I think what happened was we went through a long period during the QE years where interest rates were incredibly low and yet people bought them because they just kind of lacked the imagination or, you know, you're a large pension plan, you're like, I have to have a certain amount of my money in fixed income. I think those, again, I don't think that that's smart, but I think a lot of people had fixed income that was at very low interest rates. And then we had this big inflation. The people who own fixed income got destroyed. But then they saw, okay, well interest rates are now higher because the Fed went on this historic rate hike cycle and they said, all right, well I was buying 10 year notes at 75 basis points or 1% a year for 10 years. I don't know why anyone would do that.
00:28:11.798 - 00:28:42.948, Speaker A: But now I can own them at 3.5% or 4.5% or 5.5%. And so that looks attractive maybe, but I don't think so. I think given what's going to happen in the world here with both inflation, which I expect to pick up materially, and also with economic growth, I think there are just much better places to put your money rather than trying to guarantee yourself 3, 4, even 5% a year. So that's why I don't think fixed income is attractive. I do think inflation is headed higher.
00:28:42.948 - 00:29:30.046, Speaker A: So for all the normal reasons that people would stay away from fixed income, I think they should because I think inflation will head higher. I think interest rates for a time anyway will probably head higher. And I think these deficits, you know, I mentioned what the plan is, which is to really boost economic growth so that you can increase the rate of growth in the economy and that increases the tax receipts and that lowers the deficit and all of those things would be good for longer term interest rates. I don't think they're going to happen right away though. So the market's going to price in some probability that we're going to do all this stimulus and it's not going to work as well or as quickly as you want. And that could push up long term interest rates as well. Not to mention, the last thing I'll just say on that is I do think that I forget, you know, one of you guys mentioned the pickup in Animal Spirits.
00:29:30.046 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker A: I think we're going to see that over the next year or so. And then more and more people are going to be borrowing money and that, you know, that it's not only is the government borrowing money, but but corporations, individuals will borrow money and that will push rates up too and push the bond prices lower.
00:29:43.350 - 00:30:44.230, Speaker D: A lot of times when we talk about crypto and what it will do and try to predict the future, we get all caught up in innovation and how important it is and how it's a secular trend. And you know, bitcoin moves up 5,000 and it's at 80,000 and it's going to 250, but if it goes down to 70, it's going to 40. And so we have these kind of different moments in time. We believe in the technology, we're excited about it, but then we, but then there's someone more skeptical or cynical that puts up a chart of the correlation with crypto prices and like liquid global liquidity, like M2 or something. And it's like it's perfectly correlated or very correlated with high beta nasdaq. How much of that do you think will continue to be true or how much of that might decouple? And because we have now a more pro crypto administration in a way that I don't think we've ever seen before, you have a president that launched an NFT collection. There's been talks about having bitcoin as a reserve asset.
00:30:44.230 - 00:31:26.730, Speaker D: We might be able to get some regulatory clarity at a policy level that might allow us to innovate on what tokens can or can't do and calling them for what they are and perhaps getting a lot of companies and institutional investors that have been sidelined forever to get into the space. So you combine all of that in your thinking and how much of crypto will continue to just be a lever Nasdaq or how much might it be just a pure secular trend and really realize kind of its full potential in a way that it's beyond a 10 trillion digital gold kind of benchmark or like Target?
00:31:29.270 - 00:31:46.880, Speaker A: It's a great question. Can I ask you a question before I answer that? Sure. So when you say its full potential because your idea of its full potential in mind might be different. I'm curious, how do you think about what the full potential is?
00:31:47.580 - 00:32:34.860, Speaker D: Yeah, well, what I'm doing now is I just appreciate the crypto will be used by every business. Eventually it will likely be invisible. It is a continuation of what the Internet has allowed you to do, but it introduces a sediment layer and that we haven't even started to think about or appreciate how much friction. Like anytime you look under the hood of a lot of these systems, take payment processing, you appreciate, like, it is incredibly, incredibly inefficient. And crypto offers a very tangible, credible solution to that. And so I just think that we haven't even gone there, but for me, that's a true potential. Like, we'll know crypto is no longer early when most businesses start using it, when the amount of just speculative activity becomes less than 20% or so.
00:32:34.860 - 00:32:54.160, Speaker D: And that involves things like polymarket that actually are just really embedded in how we, you know, how we operate as a business or as a society. And I think, like, we're seeing early innings of that, but we're still very, very early. And it's in my mind, greater than 10 trillion, greater than digital gold.
00:32:54.280 - 00:33:30.908, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. All right. So we're thinking similarly. I, I think that in many respects, I think that crypto will have achieved its potential when every finance, you know, more or less every financial transaction in the world is running on crypto and no one even knows it. And, you know, when we first got involved in, in crypto in November 2020, I just kind of arbitrarily said, I'm, I'm going to be in this trade for a decade. And that's an arbitrary number.
00:33:30.908 - 00:34:26.010, Speaker A: But the reason that it was more than like a year or, by the way, that doesn't mean you can't kind of buy and sell throughout that period, of course. But the reason for coming up with that is I thought that, well, the reason that we got in in the first place was, and it's a view that one of our clients, our biggest clients had, and, and I shared as well, is that we thought that we had entered a period of real monetary debasement. And the catalyst for that had been Covid and this huge increase in government spending that we thought would kick off a long period of monetary debasement, essentially where we take on a lot of debt, we do a lot of things. There were a lot of things to spend money on. There's spend money on Covid. We spend money on environment, spend money, didn't even know about. I really, at that stage, spend money because the world is becoming a more hostile place.
00:34:26.010 - 00:35:08.612, Speaker A: It's become even more hostile. There is a lot of, or a lot of things to spend a lot of money on. Not to mention the baby boomers are really getting ready to retire and there's just not enough money to, to kind of go around. And so those are the, those are the reasons. But crypto seemed like a highly convex way to express that theme. But the question was, well, how will you know what's the right price? How will you know when that theme has played itself out? And I think that you won't even be in the zip code until everyone who has any kind of banking relationship or account has a crypto wallet. They might not call it a crypto wallet at that stage, it's just an account.
00:35:08.612 - 00:35:31.938, Speaker A: But at that stage, then all the things that are crypto native, like Bitcoin, can. Anyone who would have any inkling to buy something like that would have the ability to do it very easily without any frictions. And so I figured that that process would probably take a decade. Now, maybe it happens in seven years from 20. Maybe it happens by 2027. I doubt it. A decade's probably in the zip code.
00:35:31.938 - 00:36:16.712, Speaker A: Maybe it takes a little bit longer. But once, once that happens, then I think all the things that you just described will have been achieved. So I think all money transfers, everything will be done on crypto Rails. And that's. And, and at that stage too, you will have, you, you will have seen some amazing companies build and flourish. Like Coinbase for instance is obviously I'm talking my book, right? But I mean you just anyone objectively would look at Coinbase as one of the big infrastructure providers of this whole new technology. And so anyway, I think that, that's how I think eventually it plays out where crypto is ubiquitous from a financial services perspective.
00:36:16.712 - 00:36:56.092, Speaker A: But I think when you look at. So that's way, that'll be way bigger than 10 trillion in the sense that it'll encapsulate all financial assets in the world. But I also think that along that path, you're going to see new business models pop up and innovations pop up that we never even thought about that are going to be. I'm just so excited, you know, I'm so excited about. I republished my case for Digital assets this past weekend. I don't know if you guys saw it, but you know, that was. I wrote that in early January of 2021 and that kind of captured what I was thinking where I was thinking this all could go.
00:36:56.092 - 00:37:13.270, Speaker A: And I feel like we're really on track. We're really on track and they're going to be, you know, not everything will be right, but I think there'll be all sorts of new innovations that are built on top of this that we just didn't even like, we couldn't have even conceived of. So anyway, I'm, I think we have a long, long way to go.
00:37:13.970 - 00:38:22.560, Speaker D: Yeah. When you, when you think about entering and exiting a market, you know, at times, you know, the, we kind of know what the ten year plan looks like. But of course how you get there is very, you know, not easy to predict in any way, shape or form. There are some folks saying, hey, look, if you've been sidelined, that window is closing very quickly here. You know, you have, you got to update your priors to the election outcome and just really kind of get, get on the bandwagon or you're going to miss the train. I sort of think that if you take a longer term view, you appreciate that we're still very, very early. How do you kind of marry those two concepts? Like how do you think about, I know you can't like necessarily speak of what you're doing, but like as an investor that I, you know, think has done very well just kind of managing the market cycle, like what, I guess if you had, I don't know, a portfolio from scratch, like how much of that are you just fully risk on, fully allocated or how do you think about just playing out the market and you know, the next couple of months, so to speak.
00:38:23.780 - 00:39:49.140, Speaker A: So I think we're, I think we haven't, we haven't yet come close to appreciating what this new Trump administration means for markets broadly, which mentioned earlier and that applies to crypto. The hostility that we experienced in this industry over the past nearly four years is pretty mind boggling. And I won't comment a lot on it and disparage some of the people and the tactics that they used, but I think a lot of that will be revealed, I suspect in the courts over the next six or nine months. And so maybe they'll be over the next year or something like that. But I think the new administration that's coming in rightly views this industry as just a technology. The US Financial services is a huge sector of this economy and we have the deepest, most liquid markets in the world. We have the world's reserve currency and these technologies are well suited or maybe even more directly just you could say, like they're designed to basically fulfill all of the infrastructure and the guts of a financial system.
00:39:49.140 - 00:40:39.948, Speaker A: And so it really would be a huge mess for the US to not lead in this industry. And I think that that's going to start happening. A lot of people moved abroad. I think a bunch of those people start moving back. Not all the regulatory changes and policy changes will happen overnight, but directionally they're all happening and they're going to happen. And so yeah, I think that, you know, we'll start moving, we'll start moving in that, in that right direction and then from, from how that or how that affects markets and market prices, I think people over the next, you know, let's call a couple months will start to really realize that institutions really have not allocated to this space yet. Which is amazing by the way.
00:40:39.948 - 00:41:30.422, Speaker A: I mean, and when I say they haven't allocated hedge funds, trade it, you know, there are a couple, there's a pension here or an endowment there or. But in, in the biggest pools of capital in the world are totally unexposed to this. They, they might have had some VC that ended up owning some crypto and then mentally they're like, well we own some because we, you know, we had a teeny sliver of some private or, or venture fund but they don't really own it. So that I don't think that they're going to come in mass over the next three months. It just takes them too long. They're going to go, you know, they're going to, they got to process this and go into year end and then they got to go into like their quarterly reports and they got to get, they have to now get their, their trustees to wrap their heads around the fact the world's changed. Like there, there'll be a cadence to this.
00:41:30.422 - 00:42:20.374, Speaker A: So I could see, depending on where prices go, I could see the market getting ahead of itself, expecting huge flows that don't show up in time and then the market comes down. That's kind of what happened by the way, in 2021 into 22 it was amplified with a massive rate hike cycle. It was amplified by blow ups in crypto, by ftx. It was that bear market was amplified. But you could see volatility around people just getting too excited too early and then it has to come off and then people get, you know, apoplectic about really depressed. So they'll be trading like nothing moves in a straight line. But I think we're now on the institutional, this is the institutional cycle because like look what BlackRock did with the ETFs.
00:42:20.374 - 00:42:32.360, Speaker A: The institutions now know that they're going to have to build on these rails and they're investing a lot of money to do that. They just haven't bought the assets yet, which is really interesting to me. But anyway, that's how I see it playing out.
00:42:33.620 - 00:43:02.460, Speaker B: Skale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier.

I wanted to take a second to break down why Magic Eden is getting into token trading. Their team is extremely concerned that crypto is still consolidated in the hands of a few few centralized exchanges who act as gatekeepers, ultimately recreating the tradfi space. They believe that crypto is still missing an on chain binance and their aim is to move trading completely on chain, fully decentralized. They've done $6 billion in NFT volume in the last three years and have had more than 1.4 million users visit their platform in the past year, making them the number one NFT platform in the market today.

Hey everyone, Jason here wanted to just take a quick break and highlight everything that's been going on in the Mantle ecosystem. In just one year, Mantle has seen its TVL surge by over 1,100, now reaching $1.69 billion. That's just such a crazy amount to think about. More than 225 protocols have made Mantle their home, while the platform's Eco fund has invested $38.5 million in 51 pioneering projects through strategic partnerships with Bybit, including MNT as collateral, supporting Athena to scale and the First First Ethereum L2 to integrate Ondo Finance.
00:45:08.764 - 00:45:51.512, Speaker B: They just continue to be on the bleeding edge of L2s. Be sure to stay up to date with what's going on by giving them a follow on x at 0x.

00:46:04.840 - 00:46:37.430, Speaker C: So Eric, what does the institutional cycle do to the, to the typical four year cycle, right. Usually you know, December 2017 and then you kind of go down into a two year bare market and then two years of up and then you know, November 2021 and then down and we're actually tracking pretty perfectly actually the, the typical four year cycle which would say you know, maybe this market tops out in like October, November of 25. Right. We've got about a year from now. I'm curious how you think the, this institutional adoption will impact the four year.
00:46:37.470 - 00:46:39.210, Speaker B: Cycle or maybe it doesn't.
00:46:41.310 - 00:47:57.708, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. I suspect that as we as this, as this whole market industry becomes more institutional that kind of the, some of the cycles that dominated when it was really retail will shift. I don't, I suspect that would be the case. I just, I think that as, as institute as more institutions come in and as I said they have hardly come in at all but we've got years of them coming in and I think as they people tend to follow price up so there's always more buying into highs than there is into the lows. But I think that the downside fall will get dampened by institutions that begin to take up their allocations to this Just look at say if you look at gold, I hadn't really thought about it quite like this but if you look at gold in 2015, central banks, foreign central banks held like one and a half percent of reserves in gold. It's about 5% now. Right.
00:47:57.708 - 00:48:42.624, Speaker A: So it sounds like, I mean, it's a big percentage move, but you're like, oh, one and a half percent to 5%. That's not that big, but that's been a lot of gold buying that's taken place. And I think after the Ukraine invasion, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the West locked up $300 billion of their reserves. And that, you know, that made all of these big players say, hey, wait a second, you know, the Chinese, I'm sure saying, if we ever invade Taiwan, we can kiss any money that we have sitting in Treasuries away. Which is why I'm sure that they're just. To mitigate risk and increase their, their leverage and, and negotiating power around any situation. They're cutting Treasuries.
00:48:42.624 - 00:49:13.788, Speaker A: But like, you see what happens when there's a catalyst for big institutions to move their portfolios around. You know, gold is rocketed and, you know, the declines aren't that big. And so I think that they're, I think as big institutions want to take on crypto exposure to balance out their portfolios, the downside is going to. There will be downside because markets never go in a straight line. But I think it will be more muted than it has in the past, and I suspect that will shift its cycle too. But, you know, I don't really know. Yeah, get that right.
00:49:13.788 - 00:49:14.268, Speaker A: Right now.
00:49:14.324 - 00:49:59.060, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a, there's a big institutional allocator survey done by this firm, MV Capital, that I was reading this morning. And I was actually surprised by the lack of upside conviction. And these are folks who allocate to crypto particularly. I was surprised by the lack of upside conviction in btc. And so the survey, I think it was like, oh, I don't know, roughly 100 allocators, they saw BTC peaking somewhere between 100,000 to 150,000. Now, this was pre election, so that's obviously a massive impact. But I'm curious how you think about just like the base case, the bear case, and the bull case for just bitcoin in this cycle.
00:50:00.200 - 00:50:04.090, Speaker A: You mean between now and. And let's call it the next, like.
00:50:04.130 - 00:50:07.510, Speaker C: By the end of 25 or something? Yeah, the next 12 months.
00:50:08.130 - 00:50:57.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, my, my bull case is way higher than, than a hundred thousand. And you could get there, you get there really quickly because, I mean, it's at 85 today. Yeah. Like what, what people don't really realize is just, you know, prices can move so much just on the marginal, the marginal buyer, the marginal seller. And I started my career in commodity market, so I kind of, it's just been, just been part of my, you know, my whole career is just seeing just a little bit of demand at the around the edges can really change the price of something. So I think, I don't know, I mean, between now and the end of 2025, could, could Bitcoin triple number one? It could do anything. And that really is the truth.
00:50:57.890 - 00:51:34.180, Speaker A: But I don't see any reason why it couldn't do that. It's a big number. But again, if you look at the US saying actually we're not going to do everything possible to try to destroy this industry and the players in it, and actually the US looks at it and goes, you know what? The dollar is reserve currency. And by the way, we've been advocating for this from the outset. The dollar is a reserve currency. Dollar stablecoin is the killer app in this space right now. I know you guys have repeated that multiple times as well.
00:51:34.180 - 00:52:18.530, Speaker A: And you know, dollar stablecoin could in a way rewire the global financial system in that dollar usage could become ubiquitous just because it becomes so easy. In a world where everyone has a crypto wallet, you can just hold, you can hold money in dollars. And that feeds back to, I think you mentioned it on your last podcast. It's like stablecoin issuers could end up owning massive amounts of US Treasuries. And what does that. Like how and why would that happen? It's like the whole world starts saving their money in dollars via stablecoin. That flows through to, you know, to Treasuries.
00:52:18.530 - 00:53:07.118, Speaker A: So, so like I, I think, I think that anyway, I think tripling between here and, and there, that could happen in terms of Bitcoin downside, I don't know. I mean, downside, you can always fall 50% in a market like this. I don't think that we're going to between here and there. I think that the risk reward is skewed way, way more to the upside. I mean, Even saying down 50% versus tripling is very skewed to the upside. But I just don't think we have that kind of downside unless there's some type of really big geopolitical event that takes place and that's on the radar. But I think there's way more upside than downside.
00:53:07.118 - 00:53:33.382, Speaker A: And I think just the last thing, just around the administration, I think, you know, once, once the administration starts getting behind this. This theme of these technologies being in the US Best interest, which, by the way, that is what the insiders believe, and that is. That's the advice that. That Trump has clearly gotten, because you can kind of. You can kind of see hints of that in his. In his statements. I don't know.
00:53:33.382 - 00:53:57.564, Speaker A: Imagine what happens if the. If the US really doesn't just get out of the way, but kind of gets behind these technologies. I think people will conclude that at some point, bitcoin's just going to be worth more, you know, more tomorrow than it is today, and I'll just be buying it. And I don't know what will happen to that price. But. But that's a pretty good risk reward, you know, up 3x versus down 50%. That's.
00:53:57.564 - 00:54:02.534, Speaker A: That's pretty darn good, particularly if you think about the upside. Yeah.
00:54:02.582 - 00:54:11.718, Speaker D: How do you think about other assets, other crypto assets, Ethereum, Solana, and then farther up the risk spectrum in that equation.
00:54:11.894 - 00:54:21.450, Speaker C: Let's go. I've got two charts. I want to show that one is Eth btc, and then one is Sol btc. So, Eric, I'd love to get your take on both of these charts. Maybe we could start with Eth btc.
00:54:22.190 - 00:55:11.158, Speaker A: Yeah. I think what's happening, and I think what has happened in. In Eth relative to Bitcoin is in some ways it's actually really healthy. I know that everyone's so negative on eth, and I get it, by the way, because when you own something and you want it to go up and I own eth, I don't get emotional about it, but I know the emotion behind you own something, you want it to go up and it doesn't, and you just get depressed about it, and then it makes you want to sell it. And I think we're kind of in that. We've been in that zone. But here's what I think is positive about eth.
00:55:11.158 - 00:55:33.324, Speaker A: I think that the global financial system will be built on eth. It might be that it's in part built on Solana. I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure about ETH either, by the way. I have a very high conviction that that will be the case because it's been around for a long time. So many things have been built on it. A lot of the bugs have been worked out.
00:55:33.324 - 00:56:44.026, Speaker A: It's gone through a lot of upgrade cycles. It's a pretty impressive technology. And I think that the global financial system will get built on eth. And yet the way for it to be built on eth, the cost of transactions had to collapse. And so these L2s have been built and that's pushed the price of transactions to extremely low levels and it will go down even further. And I think what has to happen is you have to start seeing wider and wider spread adoption of ETH and things built on it that actually start transacting and then, then you'll start getting this picture of, okay, well, in the future there are going to be so many transactions pumping through the system that essentially for providing the security, the value should just be higher than it is and people will start putting money into it and it probably goes up more than it should and that makes transactions a bit more expensive and it'll just be this perpetual race of technology kind of keep transaction prices down. But I think.
00:56:44.098 - 00:56:54.330, Speaker C: So you think it trades more on this like, you know, global settlement layer security premium, basically less of like, you know, it's trading on the fees that it's spitting off or anything.
00:56:54.410 - 00:57:38.426, Speaker A: I think that they're connected. I think that those are connected. And so you have to have, you know, the, the problem is the world hasn't transitioned to this system yet. The, the global financial system has not yet, not yet transitioned to this system, but I think it will. And again, this political change makes it a lot more likely that it will because as goes the US market, so goes the rest of the world, essentially. So if all of these things are now more likely to happen in the US faster than they would have otherwise happened, I think that they were inevitable in the US But I think if Kamala had won, I think they would all have been a lot slower, but now it's going to be a lot faster. And so I think all these things are coming sooner.
00:57:38.426 - 00:58:02.890, Speaker A: But there's just this disappointment trade in ETH for the time being. I think ETH will at some point be quite a bit higher and will probably be quite a bit volatile. And then Solana, I just think it's just kind of a, it's a higher beta trade. It's just it, you know, it has a much lower market cap and it's playing catch up and people are more excited about it and it's going up, so people buy it and I don't know. I think that's going on.
00:58:02.930 - 00:58:26.290, Speaker D: So let's. Erica, I'm just going to ask the question that I in my mind have thought out about for a while. Like, Solana currently is a third of each market cap and a fully diluted basis. If you look at, across a number of KPIs. Do you think that that is appropriate? Too high or too low?
00:58:27.950 - 00:59:06.110, Speaker A: I don't know. I really don't know. I really, I think, and I say, I say that because, by the way, I try hard just as a general discipline to say I don't know as much as possible because for two reasons. Number one, most of stuff is unknowable. I think it's premature for any of these technologies to really know what their ultimate value will be. And so even if there's a framework that looks sensible right now, I think in three months or in three years, you'll look back and be like, that really wasn't the right way of looking at it. So I think there's a big momentum trade going on in this right now.
00:59:06.110 - 00:59:45.036, Speaker A: I think if you look at the market caps of both of these, you should kind of look at, on a probability adjusted basis, does it seem kind of right, this ratio? And it's like, yeah, I think I could see that. But I don't believe that there's a really great complex pricing model that should spit out what this relative value trade should be. I think Solana looks, looks to me like it's going to keep outpacing ETH just because it has been. That's not very sophisticated. But I think at some point that, that probably flips around as well, I think, because I think, I think finance gets built on eth.
00:59:45.228 - 01:00:05.210, Speaker C: So, Eric, let's say you're sitting down with someone who's got $1 million to allocate. There may be, I don't know, they have strong risk appetite, 30 to 40 years old, so they can take some risks. They've got $1 million to allocate. They're not allocated to crypto. Right now they're looking at these markets, it's ripping. How do you suggest they allocate? Is it a one third, one third, one third? Is it. How do you think about this?
01:00:06.790 - 01:00:37.638, Speaker A: I don't get asked that question. So I'll take a flyer on it. I'll take a flyer on it. I mean, you say high risk appetite, what does that mean? I think that's probably the first question I would ask someone who asked me that. It's like, what does that really mean? Does that mean, does that mean you'd be cool with losing half your money and then having it just deadline there? Or is 3/4? Is that what it means? Because most people, when they say have a lot of risk appetite, they don't really mean it.
01:00:37.694 - 01:00:44.170, Speaker D: Then they panic until you get punched in the face. You really understand how much risk appetite you have? Yeah.
01:00:46.030 - 01:01:31.460, Speaker A: I mean I have had my face ripped off multiple. When I say I have a risk appetite. Like I've, I'm pretty well calibrated. Like I actually know what that means to me because I just, you know, I've, I've gotten hurt, I've taken a lot of lumps over my career. But look, I, I think that most people, when they say they have a lot of risk appetite, they don't really mean it. And so if you had a 30, 35 year old person, I'd, I would advocate for them to be overweighted to bitcoin and ETH and, but have some exposure to Solana. So you know, maybe that's like 50, 35, 15.
01:01:31.460 - 01:01:50.060, Speaker A: That adds up to 100, right? You know, maybe something like that. I think if you're, I think if you're right on that trade, you're going to, you're at least for a period of time you'll wish you'd, you'd had a million bucks in Salon. You'd be like, why didn't I do that? I have such a high risk appetite. And like, well, yeah, maybe like that's okay.
01:01:51.200 - 01:02:28.790, Speaker D: How do you think about just the sequence of how the market unfolds? Historically it's been bitcoin led, then trickles down into other assets. Do you think that's still true in this environment? Just as you think about the larger institutions that have been sidelined? Of course now you have an etf, so they may have expressed that view now through an etf it's probably easier. But capital going into managers that are investing these tokens. I'm just curious how you think about the intra asset correlation which has been very coupled and also the sequence of the rally, the cycle itself.
01:02:30.570 - 01:03:20.820, Speaker A: Yeah, the institutions, it is easier for them to invest in these assets right now for sure with the ETFs, but they really haven't done it. I mean, not in size. So kind of the question is in this cycle, now that we have institutions that are getting involved, what are they going to do? And I suspect that they're either going to just buy bitcoin at first, a lot of them, or they're going to buy some ratio of bitcoin and eth. I think of Solana. If Solana keeps doing well, you probably get an etf. You guys were talking about an ETF sometime next year. I don't have any inside insight into that, but that wouldn't surprise me.
01:03:20.820 - 01:04:34.346, Speaker A: So then you'd see flows, if that Were the case into all those, some of them will go directly into the coins themselves. But I think you'll, I think as institutions put capital work they'll probably still focus on Bitcoin just in the first instance because that is where it's going to be easiest to get their boards and their trustees to understand what Bitcoin is. And ETH is just. I know it seems a little nuts for maybe you guys and for me and the people listening to this to think that people can't wrap their head around Ether Ethereum but you know, a lot of people can't so at least not yet. And by the way I look at that and that makes me excited because if, if you have, you know, if, if you have complete knowledge in any market it becomes the most boring thing in the world. Like the best, best thing for you know, long term bull market is to have a whole lot of people who don't understand something who are going to gradually, you know, are going to gradually learn about it. And that's, I think that is what's going to happen here.
01:04:34.346 - 01:04:59.880, Speaker A: So yeah, anyway that, that's what I, I think the Bitcoin on it's probably to a degree and it's not the institutions that are driving right now but, but it probably is more retail, you know, high net worth people because of the ETFs. Whether they're buying it directly in ETF or buying it, you know, with, with Coinbase or some other account. I'm guessing that that's why Bitcoin is kind of outperforming.
01:05:00.040 - 01:05:18.456, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean I still to this day, to this day, you know it's mostly self directed accounts, not managed accounts. Right. Your JP Morgan private bank is not, can't actually recommend the etf. You have to call them and say I want to move stuff. And so that is friction. Not to mention just going back to the discussion earlier that we're having.
01:05:18.528 - 01:05:18.712, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:18.736 - 01:05:53.270, Speaker D: I mean most of the world is stagnant. Most of the best companies in the US have been built. Most of the best companies in the world have been, you know, are us based all this to say the world. Most people can't invest in the US stock market. Now I've always felt that crypto allows you to diversify your portfolio. If you're in some of these markets, your only alternative is investing in local real estate and government bonds. And, and I think crypto is sort of an, a possibility for people to invest in a proxy like the US market that has more.
01:05:53.270 - 01:06:50.564, Speaker D: You mean like diversify their portfolio, hold and it starts with holding a US denominated stablecoin and then going and then transacting in this digital economy and investing. I'm excited to see tokenized stocks. Hopefully we can get that in the next couple of years. And that would just be explosive for the US market. I mean, talk about just continuing to double down on the dominance of the US as a leading economy. Like, why couldn't you have a tokenized stock that is settled in real time, not T plus 2 or 3 or whatever? Because, yeah, I think most people don't really appreciate most of the world can't buy Apple stock. And if they can't buy Apple stock, then you kind of say, okay, what else are they going to buy? If they have the possibility to have a stable coin that is dollar denominated, then what's the menu? What's on the menu? It's going to be Bitcoin, it's going to be Ethereum, and then it's going to be Solana and all the meme coins and all the other stuff.
01:06:50.564 - 01:07:29.254, Speaker D: And so I felt in 2018 ICO boom. That it could be kind of reach the level of liquidity that you saw in the dot com bubble or more now. Because the world, you mean? But we never got to that. And I was like, well, why couldn't we? Hypothetically, actually it was only a fraction of it. But now this time around, of course the limitation is local people in India, China, at times it becomes hard to interact in crypto. The government's really making it difficult. But it's always, every government in the world always looks to the US for inspiration of what they do at the policy level.
01:07:29.254 - 01:07:44.916, Speaker D: So because now Trump, so, so, you know, is has an NFT collection. Goddamn it. You know, then, then governments really say, okay, the US is fine with it. Then I can be fine with it. Like, I'm not going to look like an idiot. Yeah. So I think that's like that hyper bullish drink.
01:07:44.948 - 01:08:00.836, Speaker C: It's like career risk from a government perspective. It's like, you know, Eric Yu buying Bitcoin and you know, Paul Tudor Jones in what may of 2020 when he said, you know, it's the fastest horse in the race that wiped away the career risk for hedge funds. It's like Trump is wiping away the career risk for government.
01:08:00.908 - 01:08:10.166, Speaker D: The El Salvador, El Salvador President's up now 100 million on his trade. He's looking like a genius, but he was ridiculed for so long, you know, like that's going to go away.
01:08:10.308 - 01:08:12.082, Speaker B: Let me ask you the okay on.
01:08:12.106 - 01:08:34.230, Speaker C: This note, what about Fortune 500s and corporations buying Bitcoin? Because I think everybody is watching what Saylor is doing, but he's basically turned microstrategy. I used to compete against them. I was in the business intelligence world. They were a data analytics company. Now they're just a bitcoin company, obviously. What do you think about the idea of corporates holding Bitcoin on their Treasuries?
01:08:36.120 - 01:08:44.688, Speaker A: Everyone's looking at Microsoft right now, right? So what, what they're going to do? I, I think that they will. Are they going to do it?
01:08:44.744 - 01:08:48.100, Speaker C: Like, why does it, does it make sense? And why does it make sense?
01:08:49.240 - 01:09:29.830, Speaker A: I don't think, you know, I don't think they're going to do it because they've seen, you know, how it's worked for MicroStrategy. It's just a totally different investment thesis. And the people that are making that decision, any corporation obviously know that. So no one's going to do that. He's the only one who's, who probably should do that. And you know, and, and he has, and it's worked out really well for him. But I, I think if you're, if you are, you know, you're sitting on a huge corporate treasury and you want a reasonably diversified portfolio with liquidity, I don't know why you wouldn't look at, at crypto.
01:09:29.830 - 01:10:22.396, Speaker A: I don't, but I don't, I don't expect that there's going to be a large flow of that money that's coming in. I think it'll be really interesting to see when, you know, I don't doubt that there will be a company that says, yeah, we're going to approve of, you know, whatever, some couple percent, few percent of our, of our treasury, we're going to, we're going to put in these assets. I think that will be, you know, newsworthy. I don't think that's what's going to ultimately drive these markets higher. But it's probably part of the narrative that goes there. By the way, before we get back too far away from the previous comments, I do think that equities will be, will be tokenized and, and you know, this is like the, this is an example of how crypto just kind of takes over the world because all this becomes actually pretty easy once you, you know, once you build these rails. So the trade, like, imagine the trading activity that happens.
01:10:22.396 - 01:11:15.310, Speaker A: I don't know about India, like, maybe, maybe India ends up being a bit further behind the curve than others. But the cool thing is that I think that the big developed markets, because the US was shooting itself in the head when it came to how it treated this industry. I think there were a lot of other regions that said, okay, this is an opportunity for us to beat the US in this whole space. And so we're going to, going to race ahead. So I think what will happen over the next few years is that the US will begin to lead, but there'll be some regions that, you know that have advantages in one area or another, which would be great. There'll be a lot of competition between regions. But at the end of the day, rich countries by definition are the ones with all the money.
01:11:15.310 - 01:11:33.590, Speaker A: So when you open up global trade and finance to US equities or global equities that are tokenized, you know, there'll be plenty of money that will flow into that from abroad because those, you know, those, those rich countries are the ones where people actually have money, money to invest.
01:11:34.610 - 01:11:37.018, Speaker D: So who, Eric, in that scenario?
01:11:37.034 - 01:11:37.210, Speaker A: Who.
01:11:37.250 - 01:11:56.690, Speaker D: Who wins the most? Like, obviously, it's always an investing, like the relative trade, is it the blackrocks, coinbase, the base asset like Solana or Ethereum or Bitcoin? I'm curious, as you think about a portfolio construction or just who the major winners in the scenarios that we're talking about might be.
01:11:59.550 - 01:13:00.300, Speaker A: I definitely think that the infrastructure providers win massively. And to my knowledge, I don't know that there's a better infrastructure provider than Coinbase that has the number of reps that they have, meaning the number of cycles that they have dealt with all sorts of difficult technological challenges, security challenges, scaling challenges. So that should be a massive winner in that world. But any, any provider of infrastructure, and some of those are probably still private too, right? So people should figure out how to make those investments. I think the reason BlackRock has been so aggressive is because they didn't want to lose out. Blackrock looked at the mutual fund industry and said, we can do this better. And they did.
01:13:00.300 - 01:13:45.346, Speaker A: And they're now massive company. And I think they looked at crypto early. Like when we were looking at crypto, they were looking at it, but they, you know, they, they weren't really going after it at that stage, but they were curious about it. And I think it's because Larry Fink's a smart guy and you know, when you get a founder, CEO who has disrupted an industry once in his career and you're a hung, you know, you're hungry and you're smart, which he is, he probably looked at and he's like, I do not want that same thing to happen to me. So I think that's what they're doing, but that doesn't mean that they have all the best expertise and they'll need partners. And so. But I think blackrock could be a huge winner.
01:13:45.346 - 01:14:19.894, Speaker A: Absolutely. But, yeah, that's kind of how I look at it. I think what's going to happen over the next couple of years is now all the other financial players at Trad5, players who haven't really been involved, some of them have been making either no investments, modest investments or reasonable investments in this infrastructure. They're. They're. They're now going to just go on a hiring spree. And they're just, they have got to make sure that they don't get that they don't get wrecked in this next transition.
01:14:19.894 - 01:14:43.920, Speaker A: And, and so, you know, that'll be really exciting and there'll be a lot of interesting partnerships that form, I would guess. But yeah, I'll be like any. Anytime you reboot a system, that's where a lot of opportunity lies. And so this, this is, this is a reboot of the financial architecture of, you know, which doesn't change that frequently. And this is, this is it. We get to live through it. It's cool.
01:14:44.340 - 01:14:46.236, Speaker C: I think that's a good place to end it.
01:14:46.388 - 01:14:47.116, Speaker A: All right.
01:14:47.268 - 01:14:49.308, Speaker D: That might be the clip of the app. I mean.
01:14:49.364 - 01:14:49.788, Speaker A: All right.
01:14:49.844 - 01:14:58.320, Speaker D: God, if you don't get excited by hearing that, like, you know, I mean, like there's. This is a generational trade. Totally reboot of the financial system. Like you don't get that often.
01:14:58.620 - 01:14:59.364, Speaker A: Forever.
01:14:59.492 - 01:15:01.188, Speaker D: Yeah, it's pretty exciting.
01:15:01.284 - 01:15:14.404, Speaker C: Yeah. Eric, appreciate you joining us, man. This was a fantastic conversation. And no one else we'd rather speak with about state of the global. Just as you said, as we said earlier, the Overton window is shifting on many things.
01:15:14.492 - 01:15:25.866, Speaker A: You said it. Yeah, I agree with you. I agree with you. Yeah. Look, a real pleasure. Thanks for having me on and yeah, and you know, it's. Let's.
01:15:25.866 - 01:15:28.990, Speaker A: Hopefully I'll make a lot of money here. Absolutely.
01:15:29.490 - 01:15:31.706, Speaker D: Eric, thanks so much for joining us. I appreciate it.
01:15:31.778 - 01:15:33.230, Speaker A: Yeah. See you guys.
01:15:34.210 - 01:15:53.500, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly thank today's title sponsor, Skale. Skale really is one of the best chain experiences out there today. And I've used so many different chains. There's a reason they are gaining so much adoption in both gaming and AI use cases.
