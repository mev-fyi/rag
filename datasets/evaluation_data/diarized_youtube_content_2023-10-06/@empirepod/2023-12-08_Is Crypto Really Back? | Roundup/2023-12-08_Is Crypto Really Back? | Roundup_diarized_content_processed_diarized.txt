00:00:00.240 - 00:00:34.330, Speaker A: Memes are basically the mirror that reflect our society, and you take them one step further. They can even be catalysts for social change, I think. And you look at what, like the Pepe meme did in places like China, they can basically become the social glue that hold us together. So, like, communities, physical communities, used to hold us all together. Churches, things like that. Now that you don't have that, I think basically tribal communities, where a meme is the backbone of that, is now the thing that holds a lot of Internet native communities together.
00:00:34.482 - 00:00:56.826, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so on empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that.

00:01:43.104 - 00:01:52.964, Speaker A: All right, everyone from opposite sides of the world, we got the roundup. You're getting me pre coffee and pre my makeup, you know, in the morning. So good to see you guys.
00:01:54.444 - 00:01:56.764, Speaker C: Nice Gm. What's up?
00:01:56.924 - 00:02:00.244, Speaker A: And we're getting a Santi with a new haircut. So look at that.
00:02:00.364 - 00:02:11.068, Speaker C: You know, the trick is, if people don't notice you get a haircut, it's a good haircut. When people notice you get a haircut, it's sort of a bad haircut. But, Henny, that's what you get in a hotel haircut, I guess.
00:02:11.116 - 00:02:24.698, Speaker A: Well, I noticed you got a haircut, so I don't know what that says about your haircutter. I'm recording this from the, from the hotel in London. I'm in London. You're in Sydney. Look at this beautiful cappuccino. I've got here.
00:02:24.826 - 00:02:25.614, Speaker C: Damn.
00:02:25.954 - 00:02:30.974, Speaker A: Lovely, huh? Yeah. So I've been in London. I took a red eye out Friday night.
00:02:31.354 - 00:02:38.254, Speaker C: I won't dox you, by the way, but I recognize the plate. And so I know which hotel you're staying at, but.
00:02:38.994 - 00:02:40.170, Speaker A: Are you kidding me?
00:02:40.282 - 00:02:42.454, Speaker C: I've stayed in like every single. Well, actually.
00:02:42.874 - 00:03:11.594, Speaker A: Yeah, it's lovely. It's lovely. Yeah. I flew out here Friday night, took an hour long nap Saturday morning, and just have been basically racing since Saturday. So meetings all weekend, probably met with 2030 companies and some of the bigger funds out here. So we have Das coming up March 18 to 20th, and just kind of like doing a week of prep work for that. It has left me very optimistic, I would say, about the.
00:03:11.594 - 00:03:46.794, Speaker A: So we. I mean, we've been in London for a while with Das, but it's. Yeah, the state of crypto in London is actually much better than I thought it even was before coming here. So there's like a couple buckets of folks that we've met with. There's the funds, there are the kind of traditional crypto players, like copper met with bitstamp. Bitstamp and Kraken are the two longest running crypto exchanges and some of those players. But this whole scene of Defi that's popping up here met with the founder of pair protocol.
00:03:46.794 - 00:04:15.552, Speaker A: They're doing like, intense based pair trading specifically for perps. It's very, very interesting. There's a whole world of defi that's kind of getting created here. And it reminds me, I've always thought that London lagged the US by a couple of years. It felt like sometimes with a lot of things, maybe not fintech, but everything else they did, they have. And, yeah, it's cool. It's funny to see that playing out here again.
00:04:15.552 - 00:04:20.896, Speaker A: And I think there's going to be this big defi scene here in London probably in a year from now, I'd say. So.
00:04:21.000 - 00:04:24.924, Speaker C: I mean, it's already been there, right? I mean, ave was there for a while.
00:04:26.064 - 00:04:31.672, Speaker A: Argent is. I'm with the founder of Argent. Like, they've got a big team here, but there's.
00:04:31.808 - 00:04:37.732, Speaker C: You have to remember, there's been so many great fintech neo banks that have been started transferwise, revolut.
00:04:37.848 - 00:04:42.492, Speaker A: Like, why Monzo n 26, like London.
00:04:42.588 - 00:05:41.036, Speaker C: In my mind, in terms of fintech, would rival, I think, the US, particularly New York or Silicon Valley. It's a more international financial hub because it sits at that intersection, connectivity into Middle east, the whole MENa region in Asia. And so London to me, is always, by default had to think about a lot of these, like, cross border issues. Naturally, that's where crypto really plays in. And of course, you know, the administration of Rishi Sunak, I think his new prime minister recently, they've just been more pro crypto as an interesting history tidbit. The gold ETF was resisted for a long time in the US and it was first introduced in London. And that was a major breakthrough moment for then us regulators to get on board.
00:05:41.036 - 00:06:11.246, Speaker C: Enlist gold ETF's and I think you're going to see the exact same evolution. I mean, you already have these type of products in Europe. And so I think, yeah, the regulators in London, my personal experience and anecdotally talking to other founders has been way more forthcoming, way more clear, not perfect, but at least more accessible and transparent. And the intention is the right one. So, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:11.270 - 00:06:16.118, Speaker A: You were talking to the. Was it the FCA or the bank of England back. Yeah, about state.
00:06:16.166 - 00:06:24.164, Speaker C: I was running my own validators with the team. And, you know, of course, you start wondering, hey, is this going to be.
00:06:25.064 - 00:06:27.472, Speaker A: Were these validators or was this Cosmos?
00:06:27.568 - 00:06:48.968, Speaker C: No, this was 2018. 2018. It was Cosmos. Ethereum was in the picture and, and so, and also Tazos. Tazos and Cosmos were the biggest ones. And, you know, we assembled a team and the first thing is, is this going to be, how is this going to be treated? Money transmitter. Like, you know, so a lot of these questions we didn't get good clarity.
00:06:48.968 - 00:07:28.444, Speaker C: We reached out to the SEC. We actually had a meeting with a crypto czar within the SEC. Valerie, super knowledgeable at the time. They are, contrary to popular belief, these administrations, like, they knew everyone at the time and they were very knowledgeable about proof of stake and all this stuff. So anyways, that was a very big aha moment. But then I went to London and like, within a week, we get a meeting with, in a response from the FCA, I was like, wow, this is just very refreshing. So I actually sympathize if you're a company, like, if I were to start a crypto company today, I would start it in London probably.
00:07:28.524 - 00:07:32.700, Speaker A: Right, well, so the FCA, yeah, it's interesting because the FCA, or like Dubai.
00:07:32.732 - 00:07:36.868, Speaker C: And Singapore or Hong Kong, but just for me, I'm in Europe, so it would be.
00:07:37.036 - 00:08:01.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so the FCA is regulates, is the main body here that regulates crypto. They also regulate fintech. And I think they saw the success that. Yeah, all the neo banks, Monzo N 26 revolut, the list goes on. Basically the success that they had, especially even competing against the US. They're basically us fintech counterparts. And yeah, they seem much more open, I will say.
00:08:01.374 - 00:08:13.532, Speaker A: I mean, half the meetings I'm in, people are talking about the 2024 elections in the US. They're like, look, as powerful as the FCA is, at the end of the day, it's kind of all eyes on the 2024 elections.
00:08:13.638 - 00:08:14.444, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:08:16.024 - 00:08:21.800, Speaker A: Lot to talk about. The first thing is, as you think about your holiday shopping, I found a gift for you. Oh, really?
00:08:21.912 - 00:08:24.444, Speaker C: That's very kind. I think you're.
00:08:26.224 - 00:08:28.004, Speaker A: Gonna show. I'm gonna show it to you.
00:08:29.784 - 00:08:30.376, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:30.480 - 00:08:36.448, Speaker A: It is the. It is the bitcoin mining Lego set.
00:08:36.536 - 00:08:40.580, Speaker C: Damn, get me to buy bitcoin.
00:08:40.712 - 00:08:47.532, Speaker A: I know you like your legos and we've got the price of bitcoin. I don't know if you saw the corn. The good old corn hit 45k.
00:08:47.668 - 00:08:50.796, Speaker C: So in Coinbase, I think it was worried hit, actually.
00:08:50.900 - 00:08:52.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Ticked out. Yeah.
00:08:52.772 - 00:08:53.276, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:53.380 - 00:09:00.668, Speaker A: So anyways, I love it. If you're thinking about this holiday gift for any. No coin or friends, I thought you could get this for them.
00:09:00.716 - 00:09:26.136, Speaker C: Absolutely. By the way, if anyone from Lego is listening, like, this would be my ideal sponsor. Like, I think I. I collect a lot of stuff. Like a lot of shit since I was very little. And legos, like, I still have legos from, like, had I not opened these boxes, I would probably made a better return on Lego than crypto. Like, like Star wars og Lego sets are just amazing and were super rare.
00:09:26.136 - 00:09:27.592, Speaker C: Anyways, I love legos.
00:09:27.768 - 00:09:34.834, Speaker A: Yeah. I also bought too many legos in the past. So here's your gift, Santi.
00:09:35.294 - 00:09:35.974, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:09:36.054 - 00:09:51.022, Speaker A: I think maybe we could start with. I do want to talk about good old bitcoin hitting 45k. ETH is not moving much, which is interesting. I think ETH is kind of primed for a run here. I will say I think people have gotten a little too pessimistic on ETH, but I think maybe the best place.
00:09:51.038 - 00:09:52.074, Speaker C: To set everything up.
00:09:52.774 - 00:10:33.026, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, we can talk about overall thoughts on the market, but the best place to start here. So we posted this video that I kind of posted with this, like, you know, headliney title on Twitter, which I think was Santi thinks 20% chance soul will flip ETH or something like that. And the reaction to that was there was, there was a lot of anger, I would say in the reaction, it got a very. It was a very divisive video and post. And I just. From your tweets, I mean, we haven't talked much since then, but just from your tweets I saw, you seemed like you were getting pretty reflective on why folks were so divisive on that.
00:10:33.026 - 00:10:43.374, Speaker A: And I would just love to hear your reaction to the reaction. This is a little meta here, but your reaction to the reaction of that Solana video.
00:10:45.314 - 00:11:29.624, Speaker C: I mean, I don't react to other people and their opinion of what I have to say. I mean, and so I think the. I do pay attention to the comments, and I've been. And look, I go through them because the reason why I'm doing a lot of what I do in the podcast, but also in Twitter, is because I like to document stuff. Like in the. In the bear market of 2017, post 2017, I got to writing and publishing in the sub stack, medium, then sub stack. And to me, that was a very helpful exercise to make sure that I hold myself accountable and there's no better way in my mind to do it publicly.
00:11:29.624 - 00:11:57.672, Speaker C: And so now I'm really trying to just open source the idea that I had starting a bank. I went through the exercise. I'm not doing it, but public. Like, I'd like to do these things now on a public context because it invites criticism. And I think that that's the best way to identify mistakes. Fall. It was a really good thread, right? I mean, Myrt got involved in there.
00:11:57.672 - 00:12:22.340, Speaker C: Who runs Lightspeed, Lightspeed podcast, which is fantastic. And then a couple like fishy cat or cat like, there was some really good criticism out there. And so I think ultimately, the reason why I do a podcast is to elevate the discourse in crypto, which is really bad. Right. I mean, there's a lot of tribalism, as there is everywhere else. You know, people. People like stuff if it aligns with their bags.
00:12:22.340 - 00:12:41.026, Speaker C: People don't like stuff if it doesn't align with their bags. I get it. But I'm in a process of. I think it's quite early, and it's very unrealistic to assume that you're gonna know it all. And so, for me, it's. I just. I'm in the pursuit of truth, and there's no better way, I think, than doing it in an open source context.
00:12:41.026 - 00:13:00.594, Speaker C: And I'm willing to put myself out there because I've certainly said dumb shit. I certainly am not an expert on anything, but I know some experts exist out there, and I have a decent audience. And so I'd rather invite the discussion to happen in a public forum, because I think that's how we get better as a space.
00:13:02.054 - 00:13:11.524, Speaker A: Was there anything that was posted in response that made you question your earlier assumption, or has your thesis evolved since then in any way?
00:13:12.704 - 00:13:19.456, Speaker C: Not particularly. I did actually have a private call with fishy cat or catfish.
00:13:19.600 - 00:13:20.352, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:13:20.408 - 00:13:53.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I reached out to him, said, look, I actually definitely agree with your take, which was a very good one. So I reached out, said, hey, you want to come on the pod? Let's actually have you on. And sounds like he's very critical, and I like that. And so I just reached out and I had a really good discussion here. Come out. And he made some excellent points in that thread, and we're going to have him on in Q one after the holidays. And so the discussion that he made, the point that he made, which is an excellent one, is, how do you value these things? Like, it's certainly not on a cash flow basis.
00:13:53.180 - 00:14:29.222, Speaker C: Like, I mean, you can look at ethereum and maker, like, these things don't trade my hunches. They don't trade on that. Like, and I think it's just an interesting reflection on, like, I think we have to be a little bit intellectually honest and realistic around, everything trades at a comp. Like, everything trades. It ties into the point of bitcoin. Everything trades at bitcoin is 800 billion, close to a trillion. Everything is comparable to that.
00:14:29.222 - 00:15:12.284, Speaker C: Right? It's like, can ethereum be like bitcoin? Can Solana be like ethereum? And that's, I think the, I'm comfortable accepting that, whether you want to believe it or not. I just think that that's how the market really kind of trades. Now, is there a scenario where everything compresses an order of magnitude? Yeah. Is there a scenario where it grows an order of magnitude? Yeah. Like, these valuations are like, if you're doing a cash flow, the terminal value after ten years, like, 99% of the value of any crypto network, is predicated on terminal value. But we're not. I think the point that he made, which is particular to Solana, is this idea of, we've thought about the value of ethereum around.
00:15:12.284 - 00:15:49.986, Speaker C: It's disinflationary. The block space is pretty, there's a high demand for block space, therefore fees are high. So, okay, you have l two s, and it's like, okay, if l two s really take off, what's the value accrual to the l one? What happens if you can pay the native token arbop? What's the relationship between that? How much value translated into ETH, and then similarly for Solana, okay, if it's a really high throughpatient environment, yeah. Okay, you have local fee markets. And so you have, like, these price discrimination and. And different fees, but no one, I think, really knows. Like, and even anatoly said this.
00:15:49.986 - 00:16:34.956, Speaker C: It's like his version of success is there's a ton of demand and a ton of applications that get built on top and supported by something, a network like Solana. But he's, like, actually don't know, like, if that value is going to translate over to the l one. So I think, like, everything. It's so early. The best. The best, I think, position that I can be in is being comfortable with things that I don't know and having kind of bookmarking them and saying, this needs to be figured out. It's an unknown, known unknown, and I'd rather be comfortable with that versus advocating something that's actually not correct.
00:16:34.956 - 00:17:06.406, Speaker C: And I think you see a lot of that in the community where, you know, they don't want to. They don't want to see it, but I'm okay with it. You know, ultimately, you're always going to get hate, right? If you do one thing, you're going to. It's decisive, it's divisive. It's divisive, I meant to say, but that's okay. Like, honestly, you're not. You're not raising criticism, then you're probably not, like, doing anything relevant.
00:17:06.550 - 00:17:42.958, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so there are two things I want to get your take on. One is the question I think a lot of people are pinging us on Twitter about, which is, like, where is this the start of the new bowl? Where is it? Is it up only for here? I think maybe I can take the first stab at this, which is I actually think we are a little out ahead of our skis still. I think the new bull market has started. Um, however, do you remember 2019 when Binance ieos launched and this whole. We basically got this. In hindsight, it kind of was the.
00:17:42.958 - 00:18:05.512, Speaker A: The start of a bull market, um, where some of these ieos. But really, we had this vicious leg down in March 2020, I think we could be looking. I don't think we'll have this vicious leg down because there was that. That was COVID driven. That was, um, very idiosyncratic, much more forceful than anything that. I mean, unless there's another COVID like event. But assuming that there's not, I don't think we'll have anything like that.
00:18:05.512 - 00:18:08.404, Speaker A: But there can still be these pretty vicious drawdowns.
00:18:11.784 - 00:18:52.464, Speaker C: Nothing is ever up. Only, like, even in the peak of euphoria, bull like Defi summer, there were weeks of draw. Like, there were moments and days where you had drawdowns and you were questioning, is this the end of it? Is this the end of it? And I think, like, you're never in a always. Like, it's just not right in an always up only environment. Even in those moments, you feel, like, very uncertain, and there's trauma. I mean, categorically, we are in a bull market. Like, these crypto assets have rallied, you know, two x, three x, six x since the bottom.
00:18:52.464 - 00:19:12.328, Speaker C: And so you naturally have moments of consolidation, like today and yesterday. Right. I mean, these things kind of need to. There. There are people that take chip off the table. Like, things need to cool down. Funding rates get really high, and so, you know, leverage runs up, and then you get, like, you can plot.
00:19:12.328 - 00:19:29.004, Speaker C: And during Defi summer, there are discrete moments, two or three, where you had a lot of the open interest and a lot of leverage, like, wiped out of the system. And it kind of is a healthy reset to keep the animal spirits in check. Right. And so I think I actually.
00:19:29.824 - 00:19:30.644, Speaker A: I'm.
00:19:31.464 - 00:19:38.924, Speaker C: I feel very. I believe the 2024 is going to be a good year for risk assets, including crypto.
00:19:40.104 - 00:19:43.528, Speaker A: So then the next question becomes, basically, how do you play that?
00:19:43.616 - 00:19:43.912, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:43.968 - 00:19:47.488, Speaker A: So there's, like, you know, chow, obviously.
00:19:47.616 - 00:19:48.284, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:49.064 - 00:20:04.000, Speaker A: I think if you look at a lot of Chao's tweets, he's. And he's seen a lot of cycles. He's basically summarizing what I think people have seen many cycles kind of feel going into this one, which is. There are, like, two ways to play this. There's the. You can. There's the right.
00:20:04.000 - 00:20:14.216, Speaker A: There's the mid curve, I think, which is trying to get very, like, queued on, like, different. What is the most technical thing? And then there's the left bell curve. Right bell curve tape. Yeah.
00:20:14.240 - 00:20:17.654, Speaker C: Like, literally go long, you know, dog coins.
00:20:18.394 - 00:20:22.522, Speaker A: I mean, if you look at Chaz tweets, it's, uh. I wouldn't.
00:20:22.658 - 00:20:27.306, Speaker C: I mean, none of this financial advice, but do you remember that discussion? We have a Joe McCann from asymmetric?
00:20:27.410 - 00:20:29.410, Speaker A: I. Yes, I do. And I know where you're going.
00:20:29.442 - 00:20:43.974, Speaker C: And I hearing him say that, I was like, yeah, if I. If I feel strongly about soul, then bonk, to me, is a levered bet on soul. And so far, it's done a three x and sad. And I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna buy a million bucks a bonk and just write that.
00:20:45.314 - 00:21:09.174, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, if you look at Chad, I think this is a half kidding, half serious tweet. But he said, gm, I plan on outperforming 90% of this website in the next bull cycle by holding an uncomfortable percentage of my net worth in the original dog coin and pfps from the fastest chain. So I think he's talking about Solana nfts here. So there's a high likelihood that he's right here.
00:21:10.274 - 00:22:13.194, Speaker C: Look, this ties into some of the discussion you and I were having around nfts, and why don't I think of them as investments? Although they could be good ways to play a levered bet on, you know, punks, for instance, are a lever bet on Ethereum. Some of these Solana NFTs have been having their moment now, right? And so for me, again, similar to like half jokingly, I'm comfortable putting a decent, decently sized position in something like bonk. I think it's very difficult to do it as a fund because if there's a huge drawdown, it's like the career risk of already having crypto fund is high. And then telling your lp's, you put money in bank. Most of these lP's don't get it, right. And I think it just takes, again, it goes back to this idea. I think it takes a fair level of intellectual honesty to say where how does value get created, right? And I think this is the beauty of the crypto journey.
00:22:13.194 - 00:23:10.818, Speaker C: You know, you remember even having discussions with normal people, or even I was having discussions with all my finance friends and former bosses or whatever, and they're like, what gives bitcoin value? You're like, okay, you really want to go into that discussion? Okay, well, let's talk about value. Like, what is value? Like, this turtles all the way down, right? What gives a us dollar value? And some people think it's gold. Like, you know, this is how like, poorly knowledgeable most people are and misinformed. And so when you accept that and you say, well, how do you put a price on culture and value and encapsulating that in a digital asset? That is, by the way, for the first time, it's like global capital markets open 24 7365. People don't appreciate that. The range of investment opportunities for most people around the world is fairly limited. China, you can invest in government bonds or real estate.
00:23:10.818 - 00:23:51.082, Speaker C: Oh, well, that hasn't turned out to be really nice. So capital flight is naturally going to happen with something like crypto. The government doesn't like it for that reason, because they dry up the buyers, right? It's great to be a government. You can only tell your people, you can only invest in the local economy. Same with Argentina, same with India. Like, people don't have access to Tesla and Apple, like you and I do. Right? And the moment you understand that, you invert and you say, well, where's that money gonna go? Because now you sort of, like, have created this ability to, like, untether money and the flow of that at the speed of light, and it's, like, explosive.
00:23:51.082 - 00:24:38.160, Speaker C: Like, I remember in 2017, I thought this could go on for. I was having a discussion here with Kane. Him and I were both talking about this. Like, I was of the mind that, you know, that run could have lasted for way more, like, many more years in terms of the aggregate flow of money. And so, you know, what's to say that, like, you know, some of these dog meme coins can accrue serious value, and then. And then you can actually will it into existence? Like, someone had a pretty interesting tweet a year or two ago that said, hey, like, what's to stop if you already have all this attention? Which is the hardest thing to capture.
00:24:38.232 - 00:24:39.256, Speaker A: I know where you're going with this.
00:24:39.320 - 00:24:55.784, Speaker C: Why can't. Yeah, why can't, like, like, any of these dot coins, doge, for instance, become, like, a. You will it into existence like you do pravor, right? Or it's a contract. It's like, okay, you could.
00:24:56.164 - 00:25:15.314, Speaker A: So let me. Let me take the other side. So the common pushback this would be, if that's all we're doing, longing meme coins and, you know, buying dogecoin and hoping dogecoin, like, launches a product, because they've got all the attention, et cetera. Like, what are we all doing here? How do you think about that?
00:25:18.414 - 00:26:01.552, Speaker C: See, I think people have these very particular opinions of what is right and wrong in the world, and they try to impose that on other people. And it's the same reason why governments shouldn't interfere with what you want to do with your life. If you're not damaging other people, you're paying your taxes, and you're a law abiding citizen. They shouldn't meddle with so many things like the drug policies. And so what I'm trying to say is, I get your point. It's like, what are we doing here? And it's almost laughable, but it's like, games, right? So many people are critical of, like, Charlie Munger. I was just reading a bunch of his questions.
00:26:01.568 - 00:26:03.256, Speaker A: Did you listen to that interview I sent you?
00:26:03.400 - 00:26:06.000, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. He was talking about games.
00:26:06.112 - 00:26:06.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:06.752 - 00:26:59.156, Speaker C: And you can tell that he's a very smart person. I think he can have conflicting ideas in his brain. And on one end, he struggled with the idea where people would spend a lot of time and hours gaming. But then he also appreciated, look, at the end of the day, we're here and we're in this world and we want to have fun and we want to be happy. And if that involves playing a game, then that's great. That's amazing, because if you're happy, then that all of a sudden you're not spending and having a strain on the healthcare system and all this opioid epidemic, you know what I mean? I guess I don't have strong of an opinion on what other people should be doing or what they perceive to be valuable as long as it provides utility for them. And I am not the judge of that.
00:26:59.156 - 00:27:27.164, Speaker C: I ultimately accept that. What utility is very subjective. It's like art. And so you can't really impose your worldview on that. All you can accept is pay attention to that because I think Doge is telling you something. You know, people, I think it's going to be hard as is, okay, you're a traditional finance guy who's listening to this pod. Explain to me how goodwill gets captured in a balance sheet.
00:27:27.164 - 00:28:27.424, Speaker C: What's goodwill? Isn't that what dogecoin is? Literally, goodwill. When you can't account for the value of an asset in an acquisition, the value of the team? Well, that goes into goodwill. When AOL, what was it, these crazy acquisitions, what is AOL bought? MySpace or vice versa? MySpace bought everything. Was goodwill. How do you account for that? Well, isn't that like, you know what I mean? So what is perhaps the more interesting mindset is, hey, why is this thing trading at like 60 plus billion or whatever it is trading at? Why is it capturing all this attention and trying to understand that? Like, you invert, you say clearly something here where a ton of people perceive valuable. Well, let's unpack that. And this again ties into the whole regulatory discussion, too.
00:28:27.424 - 00:29:31.714, Speaker C: Like, what are we trying to accomplish by preventing people from accessing, for instance, a jito airdrop or some of these airdrops? Like, what are you protecting against ultimately? What is the intention here? And I think that sometimes we lose sight of that. And I think it's just important to go back to first principles and say, what is the role of government? And just being a little bit more open minded, which ties into everything in crypto, is sort of a fascinating discussion, because the minute I don't tweet about Solana, I'm an ETH maximalist and the minute I tweet about Solana, I'm shitting about ETH. And you see all these ETH people now on Twitter saying, oh, there's so much hate against Ethereum. It's like, no, man, I just genuinely got fucking tired of not getting a very clear answer and understanding of how this thing's going to scale to billions of users. I don't see it today. I see it more clearly with Solana, and so therefore, Solana can be the most valuable network now. I don't know how they're going to monetize it, but at least I know that's the biggest uncertainty.
00:29:31.714 - 00:30:06.334, Speaker C: But I am okay accepting that and going into a position saying, like, if it gets a ton of usage, I think you have a higher probability of figuring out how to monetize it, versus you're just a really expensive place where no one wants to interact. And when you have something that's actually really cheap, well, I'd much rather bet on that. It's the same reason why I don't own bitcoin and just struggle to justify owning bitcoin. I'd rather own other instruments to hedge and I'd rather, like, I don't know.
00:30:08.674 - 00:30:42.750, Speaker A: You ever seen the documentary feel, feel good, man, about the pepe meme? I think it's a really good, it's a really good documentary to understand, like, just the power that memes get. I think basically going back to the bonk conversation and dogecoin and all of these things, I think you nailed it. Like, the same people who hate that we're talking about, you know, buying. I mean, my DM's were filled with people who are like, you guys should not be talking about Solana NFTs on the podcast. That's a complete waste of time. Like, are the same people who don't think that the government should be cracking down on crypto. It's like, it's very hypocritical take.
00:30:42.750 - 00:31:19.074, Speaker A: And I think this memes are basically the mirror that reflect our society. And you take them one step further, they can even be catalysts for social change, I think. And you look at what, like the pepe meme did in places like China. They can basically become the social glue that hold us together. So, like, communities, physical communities, used to hold us all together. Churches, things like that. Now that you don't have that, I think basically tribal communities, where a meme is the backbone of that, is now the thing that holds a lot of Internet native communities together.
00:31:19.074 - 00:31:24.334, Speaker A: So, yeah, it'll be, we'll see what happens here.
00:31:25.674 - 00:32:01.646, Speaker B: Alright everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santee and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks, 8th ever digital asset Summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan, Framework. Folks coming out Wintermute, Vanek Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference.
00:32:01.646 - 00:32:28.268, Speaker B: One, bitcoin catalysts, the having and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, RWA's tokenization and stablecoins four, global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is Empire 20.
00:32:28.268 - 00:32:39.116, Speaker B: There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20.
00:32:39.220 - 00:32:40.652, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by.
00:32:40.668 - 00:33:16.092, Speaker B: The Chronicle Protocol, a cost efficient, transparent and decentralized oracle that gives protocols verifiable on chain data for the frequent listeners of Empire. You know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle Protocol is a novel oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for Makerdao and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, Chronicles Oracle services are now publicly available. Why should you use Chronicle? It's simple. Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees for all of their leading counterparts. Also super cool.
00:33:16.092 - 00:34:01.050, Speaker B: They have unparalleled transparency when it comes to oracles. Chronicle offers a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides. This is the first time ever that an oracle has made all of its data verifiable, setting a new standard for the accessibility of on chain data. Endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, Gitcoin, DYDX and maker Dao, Chronicle is the epitome of security and reliability in the oracle space. It's time for a paradigm shift in Oracle development. You can learn more about chronicle@chroniclelabs.org. Dot big thanks to chronicle for sponsoring Empire Today's episode is brought to you by Northstake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors.

That'll take you right to Norstake site. Or if you're on YouTube, scan the QR code on your screen right now.
00:34:50.856 - 00:34:52.924, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the episode.
00:34:54.344 - 00:35:46.426, Speaker C: I think the more probably important question in everyone's mind is, where are we in the cycle? What, you know, have I missed out? How long is this going to last? And I think trauma is real. I ultimately think, look, the most important thing is to really focus on, don't get carried away in, you know, if you're seeing it in Twitter, then, you know, everyone has bias in their own bags. And so I think that the more important thing that I would encourage, I don't give advice, but what has been helpful for me is like, document why you're interested in stuff. The nice thing too is you can get a lot of access to these communities. And so if you're using a product, you're getting utility. Then I think, like, the learning curve is really steep. And you think that there's always going to be a lot of volatility in this space, always.
00:35:46.426 - 00:36:11.522, Speaker C: And so you want to kind of understand, how do I minimize being carried away? Well, leverage is probably not a good idea. Being overly spread is also not a good idea. Not even knowing what the product is also not a good idea. You know, ultimately, I think where I've been most successful is like, especially in Defi early on was like, I'm using this, there's a lot of value. I come from a financial background. I see value in that. I think there's a lot of utility.
00:36:11.522 - 00:36:35.350, Speaker C: But you can come from entertainment and say, wow, like, I can make a movie on bonk. Well, go at it, you know? So anyways, it's going to be quite interesting. I think I'm very optimistic of 2024, and it sounds like you guys are too, in terms of. I mean, you probably have a great vantage point in terms of subscriptions engagement. You know, we have a lot of.
00:36:35.382 - 00:37:14.364, Speaker A: Insights into that other people in the market don't have, basically by, like, from where we sit. So we can see right when, like, you know, 25 people from society general or SocGen subscribed to the newsletter three months ago. We're like, there's something that must be going on at Stock Gen, sure enough. And I actually want to talk about this news. Yesterday, they announced stable coin, right? The first Europe stable coin with bit stamp. So, you know, our podcast downloads. Podcast downloads were like, I think this month, well, this quarter, there'll be the biggest quarter, I think, every single podcast of blockworks has ever had.
00:37:14.364 - 00:37:29.424, Speaker A: You know, I mean, Empire is going to hit a record number of downloads. Lightspeed's like a pair. The fastest growing podcast we've ever had. Bell Curve doing well. Page views is climbing again. Like, my.
00:37:29.504 - 00:37:33.864, Speaker C: My Twitter followers are now starting to grow, like, 1000 a week or so.
00:37:34.024 - 00:37:48.414, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, mine too. Mine too. I mean, it's just funny. It's just funny. So do we got to get you a little. Should we get you a little block works, you know, the official stamp on Twitter's sir?
00:37:49.074 - 00:38:01.378, Speaker C: I mean, sure, I'd still need some blockwork swag. Like, look, and being, like, companies not doing swag, but, man, I sit on a chair for two years.
00:38:01.506 - 00:38:05.922, Speaker A: All right, all right. We'll send the damn shirt.
00:38:06.098 - 00:38:12.968, Speaker C: I was like, okay, he didn't get the memo. I'm going to invest in blockworks, and I'm still here. Like, you know, what do I need to do?
00:38:13.136 - 00:38:31.928, Speaker A: I'll send the damn shirt. We'll send the damn shirt. Send the lego to. Yeah, exactly. All right, so this week, here, let me. I can share this. So Societe general, more often known as SocGen, just became the first big european bank to list a state.
00:38:31.928 - 00:38:52.734, Speaker A: Actually, I think the first bank in general to list a stablecoin. So I can walk through some of the details of this. Basically, they're launching their own stablecoin on bit stamp. They're the first big bank to offer stable coins that track the price of the euro. It's basically a USDC like product, but instead of us dollars, it's a euro stablecoin.
00:38:53.834 - 00:39:19.950, Speaker C: By the way, huge void, too, in the market you didn't have when I was doing the bank, I'm like someone's going to build another USDC, another us, another euro stable coin doesn't exist. A huge opportunity. Anyone that's looking at Coinbase's last quarterly report where they finally broke out the revenue that they're cranking out from stable coins, I think every major bank is not paying attention to that.
00:39:20.142 - 00:39:30.584, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean if you, I don't know if you can still see my screen here, but if you circle euro dollar, they had launched e you are see. But I don't think it really took off much.
00:39:30.664 - 00:39:31.844, Speaker C: No, I don't think it did.
00:39:32.544 - 00:39:36.444, Speaker A: So anyways, this is, yeah, this is, this is pretty cool, I would say.
00:39:37.024 - 00:39:48.320, Speaker C: So just for people, if you wanted to have a euro, this euro stable coin, do you have to be a customer of stock gen? Can you trade it? Like what's the network and what's the do we know?
00:39:48.352 - 00:40:18.752, Speaker A: So, so it starts trading today on bit stamp. Like if you're on bit stamp, you can, you can go buy this. Um, the funds are held at, I'd say an arm's length from SocGen. They have a third party called, or the, um, they have a, I think, subsidiary called Soc Gen Forge, which is like their digital asset arm. Um, it can't really be used on any platform. The platform has to be whitelisted first by Socgen. So it's not really freely transferable.
00:40:18.752 - 00:40:54.172, Speaker A: So it's not really a comparable product to USDC. I'd say it's also not compliant with my car right now. Which are the markets in crypto asset regulation. The EU, basically the EU regulation. But you did just see a big fund. Who was it? Let me find this. AXA investment managers just invested in a, a digital bond using, using this stable coin and acts as a, I mean, they're almost a trillion dollar.
00:40:54.172 - 00:40:58.780, Speaker A: I think they've got, they're like 850 billion under management. Yeah.
00:40:58.812 - 00:41:15.038, Speaker C: So massive insurance company. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, look. Who was it? Chris Berniske from placeholder said something that I think it was obviously super interesting. I've noticed it. You're not funding deals with wire transfers anymore.
00:41:15.038 - 00:41:16.522, Speaker C: Everyone's taking USDC.
00:41:16.698 - 00:41:26.138, Speaker A: Everyone's us. I have a question for you on that front. Do you. So I just sent a. They sent the ad. This was a deal yesterday. They sent the wire.
00:41:26.138 - 00:41:36.138, Speaker A: It was like a third party firm, basically. They sent the info and do you do a test transaction still or do you just rip out the whole USDC?
00:41:36.306 - 00:41:39.106, Speaker C: Depends if I'm feeling, you know, that Google button. Feeling lucky?
00:41:39.250 - 00:41:40.146, Speaker A: Feeling like.
00:41:40.290 - 00:42:04.224, Speaker C: Yeah, it depends on the size. Like if I'm doing, you know, depends. It depends on the size. Protocol wise, I think it's the best practice is to always send a test transaction. And if you're funding from certain exchanges like Coinbase, like actually subsidizes, it's like you can send a test transaction and they'll send one USDC to whoever the counterparty is.
00:42:04.644 - 00:42:05.384, Speaker A: Really?
00:42:06.204 - 00:42:08.624, Speaker C: Yeah. Coinbase prime. Yeah.
00:42:10.424 - 00:42:14.564, Speaker A: I didn't realize that I've been sending $1 and just paying like $6 in gas.
00:42:14.904 - 00:42:18.392, Speaker C: But the best practice is, yeah, you should, you should likely do it the.
00:42:18.408 - 00:42:40.514, Speaker A: Same way that I was feeling lucky yesterday. I did it and then I was like, f. And I went to Etherscan, I was like, please, please, please. So, okay, so socgen, I think this, I mean, I think this is basically one trend that you're going to see in the next market is everyone and their mother is going to launch a stable coin tradfi companies, c five crypto companies.
00:42:41.254 - 00:43:17.204, Speaker C: I mean, absolutely. Like it's going to be a huge revenue driver. And also the velocity of transactions, I think is what banks from where banks can make money. And so I think ultimately that's huge for them. Right. They have all these deposits and. Yeah, I think it's kind of a bit, I think it dovetails a little bit into what we saw today of Jamie Dimon kind of like testifying and saying that if he had the possibility to, as he said, shut down crypto in the US, he would do it, which is interesting because we had Tyron on the pod and I asked him this question, like how much buying there isn't within the organization.
00:43:22.904 - 00:43:27.070, Speaker A: Yeah, what about that, j? I mean, did you see the Jamie Dimon. I mean, I can read.
00:43:27.192 - 00:43:28.162, Speaker C: That's what I'm saying today.
00:43:28.218 - 00:43:28.834, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:28.994 - 00:43:45.174, Speaker C: If he can shut down crypto, he would. It's like toxic. Like Charlie Munger says this too. You know, I think in his defense, or like, not Jamie Dennis, but Tyrone. Right. He would probably say, we're excited about blockchain, but not crypto.
00:43:47.074 - 00:44:30.358, Speaker A: Let me read this for anyone who missed this. So basically the CEO's from a lot of the big banks, Morgan Stanley, Goldman, JP, bank of America, BNY Mellon, et cetera, on Wednesday joined a bunch of lawmakers who are questioning them about how effectively the banking industry is serving Americans. And Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, very vocal critic of the banking industry, CEO's, I would say, of banks do not like her. They basically found this rare moment of agreement when they shifted the topic to crypto. And I'll read the quote from Warren, which it's funny, I think this got basically debunked, but they're still leveraging this report from chainalysis. She said, quote, today's terrorists have a new way to get around the Bank Secrecy act. Cryptocurrency.
00:44:30.358 - 00:45:07.006, Speaker A: Last year, an estimated 20 billion in illicit crypto transactions funded every kind of dangerous criminal. North Korea has funded at least half its missile program, including nuclear weapons, using the proceeds of crypto crime. So then Warren went on. So she finished her five minute segment. She went on to ask Jamie Dimon why, based on his experience leading JP Morgan, criminals are so drawn to crypto. And he responds, quote, I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etcetera. You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, anti money laundering, tax avoidance.
00:45:07.006 - 00:45:52.708, Speaker A: And that is a use case because it is somewhat anonymous, not fully, and because you can move money instantly. If I was the government, I'd close it down. It's crazy, because when you speak with anyone in the wealth management department at JP Morgan, which is where they make a lot of money, obviously. Do they have the biggest private bank or one of the biggest private banks out there? Every private banker there is. I mean, these statements kill them, right? If you're banking with JPMorgan's private bank, you want the dream would be able to. I think a lot of folks want to custody their bitcoin with someone like JP Morgan. They could make a lot more money doing that.
00:45:52.708 - 00:45:53.760, Speaker A: Um, but you can't.
00:45:53.832 - 00:45:56.844, Speaker C: This, this classic of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
00:45:57.344 - 00:45:57.968, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:58.096 - 00:46:17.496, Speaker C: And so they're there. Look, people always want to look for a scapegoat. There's no notion of. Well, how much of, in the whole binance finance paid 4 billion of fees. That's like the 7th largest fee. That is a fine that has been placed ever in the US. Well, guess what? The top six are banks, HSBC, every single major bank.
00:46:17.496 - 00:47:26.184, Speaker C: The US has gotten a fine because they facilitated money laundering and illicit funds that have been gone through their system and. Right. And so I think, you know, obviously you want to, whenever you have the possibility to divert attention to something else, you will. Now, I looked at this today and I tweeted and my tweet was like, when you actually think about how antiquated the financial system is, it is, it is a patchwork of outdated systems that don't talk to each other very well, that are costly. And people within, I think privately, if you were to talk to major bank executives, they would all agree that putting aside regulation, they would absolutely adopt certain pieces of this because it will streamline back office compliance, make their operations, make their operations more economic. Because you streamline a lot of this stuff and also open up new markets all of a sudden, because things, because you don't have to, because KyC is lower, because you can do atomic settlement versus t plus two, because you can reconcile everything faster. You don't need as many people like that.
00:47:26.184 - 00:48:01.168, Speaker C: That meaningful translation and basis points can then allow you to service other clients, other markets. It's so obvious to me that this is going to be the way forward. Not only that, but like I've always, I'll encourage you to do something. Whenever you go talk to a finance friend, don't even mention crypto, just say, hey, man. Imagine a world where you can minimize counterparty risk and inspect in real time your counterparty's position 24 7365 in real time, auditable. You understand where things are. You understand like that exposure risk.
00:48:01.168 - 00:48:17.972, Speaker C: And they'll be like, holy shit, that'd be great. Like, we could do so many different derivatives. We could. Like, their mind just starts. Their imagination goes crazy. I've done this with like 1020 of my friends that are in hedge funds and private equity and banks. But the minute you say crypto, they're like, oh, no, no, no, and look, rightfully so.
00:48:17.972 - 00:48:22.332, Speaker C: They're smart contract bugs. I get it. But that can be solved.
00:48:22.508 - 00:48:23.264, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:25.524 - 00:48:28.484, Speaker C: Look, it's going to be a classic in everybody's demo, I actually think.
00:48:28.524 - 00:48:29.220, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:29.412 - 00:48:41.224, Speaker C: If it's not going to, one of these banks like sock gentlemen is going to realize that they can move in this direction and innovate itself. Newspapers went through this in online media and publications like, no different.
00:48:43.604 - 00:48:44.988, Speaker B: Where it really gets fun is part.
00:48:44.996 - 00:48:48.380, Speaker C: Of the Coinbase thesis, is it just becomes the better back.
00:48:48.572 - 00:49:27.146, Speaker A: Right? Where it's going to get really interesting is once shares of Apple and basically equities are tokenized. Essentially. And I think the tokenizing real estate is a. Is a fluffy narrative that I'm not too excited about. But what gets really interesting is tokenizing equities and what that the reason it's going to take so long to do that is because of how much money the folks who sit in between all of those transactions make, whether it's DTCC or JP. I think one of JP Morgan's biggest clients is Blackrock, right? They make hundreds of billions of dollars a year settling blackrock trades or sitting. Sitting, not like sitting in between those trades.
00:49:27.146 - 00:50:01.644, Speaker A: I'm not sure if their correct word is settling there, but they're so incentivized not to create a more efficient system, it would wipe out tens of thousands of jobs. So it has to be created by. I mean, I had an awesome meeting with the CEO and CCO of copper. I don't know if you know the copper team, but they're. I mean, I'm not sure how much. I think what they're building is not going to be too relevant in 2024, 2025, but 2026, 2027 in the tokenization space. It's very, very cool to see.
00:50:01.644 - 00:50:21.136, Speaker A: So there's another thing that launched this week, which was Coinbase launch. Send money anywhere you can send a link easily, instantly and for free. So you can basically do this. Send a link anywhere it sends money. What do you think about this?
00:50:21.280 - 00:50:33.212, Speaker C: Huge. I mean, it already exists. Since there's an app in Solana, there's already. There's another portfolio company of mine called Arcana that has, like. Send it. Yeah. There's also, like, in the early days, bitcoin.
00:50:33.212 - 00:50:36.264, Speaker C: You could do this too. Yeah, it's huge.
00:50:36.804 - 00:50:43.236, Speaker A: It's funny, I remember doing this in like 2016 or something, and they must have taken the ability away. Or 2017.
00:50:43.340 - 00:50:49.308, Speaker C: This didn't go anywhere. But like, the important novelty here, I think, is it's just Coinbase has huge distribution.
00:50:49.476 - 00:51:10.744, Speaker A: Yeah. So when the recipient clicks the link, it takes them into the Coinbase wallet app. They can claim or direct them to, and they can claim directly inside the wallet app, or it takes them to download the Coinbase wallet app on iOS or Android. They can create a new wallet in just one click. They don't have to do all that. I think they do the Kyc stuff later. And if the fund.
00:51:10.744 - 00:51:21.506, Speaker A: I thought this was a cool feature. If the funds are not claimed within two weeks, they automatically get returned to the sender. I thought that was a pretty nifty cool feature. Yeah, it's like Venmo, but, you know.
00:51:21.570 - 00:51:22.802, Speaker C: Just another way to do it.
00:51:22.898 - 00:51:29.050, Speaker A: It's like Venmo, but Venmo's only supported in the US, and you can't withdraw your funds same day unless you pay a $10 fee. Right?
00:51:29.082 - 00:51:45.100, Speaker C: That's right, that's right. Yeah. No, it's huge. I'm very excited to. I think stable coins are the trojan horse of this industry and you're gonna see just way more non speculative demand for stable coins. And it's. It's, I mean, up only for stable coins, I think.
00:51:45.212 - 00:51:57.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I think PayPal. I mean, we'll see what Venmo does on this front, but I would assume Venmo launches some. Some competitive thing because they are owned by PayPal. And PayPal launched py USD right there. Stable.
00:51:57.252 - 00:52:35.904, Speaker C: You know what a product that I'd want to see. Give me the ability to send the stable coin, and at the same time you can mint an NFT. I mean, imagine a world where you start sending stable coins for various reasons. You pay for something, you send it to a friend, you settle a business transaction, you append information meta into the NFT, which, you know, or in the metadata of the transaction that can be shielded with a, you know, with zero knowledge proofs, like, right, of course. Course. Because. But you can effectively.
00:52:35.904 - 00:52:49.604, Speaker C: It would be really cool, right? All of a sudden, you have, like, real information that you append. You're sending certain amount of money. The reason for that, or just thank you. Like, hey, you know, if you're a brand and you have a loyalty customer, like, you just send.
00:52:49.904 - 00:53:09.574, Speaker A: It's funny, I used to do this with, um, in 2017 with Uber drivers, when we would talk about bitcoin, I would just be like, oh, yeah, just drop me. Like, um. Because you know how you get the. The fake cell phone number or whatever from them? I would just send them like $5, $10 a bitcoin or something. And that's. You lost the ability to do that. Now you can do that again.
00:53:09.954 - 00:53:14.682, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really exciting to see. Coinbase continues to out innovate, man. They just increase the leverage on their perps.
00:53:14.738 - 00:53:20.250, Speaker A: Like, obviously do a holiday campaign around this. By the way, like I said, some.
00:53:20.282 - 00:53:55.174, Speaker C: Great videos recently, like, upgrading the system. The stock has been on a tear. I mean, I think a lot of it is cover short covering. Like, I mean, at some point, like, 33% of all Coinbase float was being shorted. More borrowed, so shorted. And I think a lot of people just got blown out and they're covering the short, and the stock has gone, you know, it hit up to 148, 140, something close to 150. I mean, it was sitting at 30 not too long ago, month or change ago.
00:53:55.174 - 00:53:56.946, Speaker C: It's crazy, right?
00:53:57.130 - 00:53:58.334, Speaker A: You did all right.
00:53:59.554 - 00:54:10.374, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, I've been very public as to why. I think it's been properly neglected and mispriced. But, you know, everyone should go do their own work. And none of this is financial advice or any advice, for that matter.
00:54:12.274 - 00:54:24.246, Speaker A: Anything else this week? I got to jump to that meeting in a few, but anything. Sotheby's is doing a bitcoin ordinal sale. I haven't read about it. I just saw the headlines, but I'll.
00:54:24.270 - 00:54:35.750, Speaker C: Leave it with things I want to continue to talk about in the next episode. Definitely ordinals seeing a lot of equity, you know, crazy. Not just in price, but just divisiveness again, within the bitcoin community.
00:54:35.942 - 00:54:48.866, Speaker A: You know who we should have on? Is that Ud and. Yeah, I can. I'll ping Udi. Maybe a little bitcoin. Bitcoin chat with him about tap roots and ordinals.
00:54:48.970 - 00:55:16.842, Speaker C: We're due for an update we had earlier, but yeah, that would be great to have. Very. Because I think he's building like that's in this direction. Want to continue to unpack the experience of the Solana thesis and other kind of. I want to do an episode with this catfish guy around the. At the start of the year. Let's poke holes at everything in crypto.
00:55:16.842 - 00:55:36.410, Speaker C: And I think that's going to be an important episode. And it could be actually multi segments, a bull market. Because it's in those moments where we stop poking holes and we do, you know, there's mistakes made. So let's try to avoid that. Right?
00:55:36.602 - 00:55:46.342, Speaker A: Agreed. Agreed. We have some good. Some good content coming out soon, too. Did you have immutable. I don't know if that episode Robbie.
00:55:46.398 - 00:56:05.464, Speaker C: They just announced, obviously great partnership. Merit Circle is moving over. I think gaming again, gaming as a narrative is totally neglect. Kieran's here from alluvium, too. I was talking to Kieran. This gaming is. Gaming is going to be a big catalyst in 2024 in my line of sight and invested in over 40 games.
00:56:05.464 - 00:56:07.988, Speaker C: A lot of them are going to go live next year.
00:56:08.076 - 00:56:22.612, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's funny. So I'm doing. I'm. We're recording this on Thursday. Thursday night, I'm going to Wintermute's office and doing like a 2024 predictions talk with Evgeny. There's like, a couple of us on this panel.
00:56:22.612 - 00:56:37.728, Speaker A: There's, I think, about 100, 150 people coming to Wintermute's office, and it's me, Evgeni, and a couple other folks. And I was looking at everyone somewhere in everyone's predictions because we all submitted our predictions ahead of time. Everyone's mentioning gaming at least once, sometimes twice. So.
00:56:37.856 - 00:57:00.236, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, people should go listen to that episode that I recorded in person with Robbie. And we really, I think I really enjoyed that conversation. And, you know, as always, tweet at us or drop a comment on Twitter or on YouTube if you have any questions. Or, you know, we're saying dumb shit. We want to know. We do a lot of that.
00:57:00.340 - 00:57:10.948, Speaker A: Yeah. Seeing that. Seeing the dangerous YouTube comments. Oh, also, people should register for Das London. Empire is close to flipping on the margin. Yeah, hit that. Yeah.
