00:00:55.774 - 00:01:02.062, Speaker B: Thanks for having me to be here, Mike. Good to be here. Midsummer Mike, over here with your Florida shirt ready to.

00:01:03.854 - 00:01:04.994, Speaker D: You're in Florida?
00:01:05.374 - 00:01:15.942, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually, he's been on the show. It's Miles. It's. It's miles 30th. So I am down here. This is like the year of all. My, my entire friend group is turning 30.
00:01:15.942 - 00:01:20.974, Speaker C: So like five 30th birthdays in various places. So I was.
00:01:23.154 - 00:01:30.578, Speaker E: Vance and I were at a wedding this weekend. I've yet another one this upcoming weekend and one the weekend after it's wedding season.
00:01:30.626 - 00:01:34.298, Speaker D: Michael did, what was it, 13 weddings, 14 weddings last year.
00:01:34.426 - 00:01:36.042, Speaker E: Eleven weddings last year.
00:01:36.138 - 00:01:36.946, Speaker B: Damn.
00:01:37.130 - 00:01:41.026, Speaker E: Sounds like the beginning that he's invited to.
00:01:41.130 - 00:01:46.084, Speaker D: I've told all of my friends that I'm only showing up to one of their weddings, so you better make a count.
00:01:47.104 - 00:01:52.144, Speaker B: It'd be really funny. One of your friends was like, didn't invite you to the first wedding expecting, you know, the same.
00:01:52.184 - 00:01:55.096, Speaker D: Not down to the second, then one and done.
00:01:55.280 - 00:01:57.144, Speaker C: You get one. You better be really sure.
00:01:57.264 - 00:02:01.724, Speaker D: Yeah, seriously, like, I don't have that many weekends in a year.
00:02:03.104 - 00:02:16.520, Speaker C: I feel you. I was just talking this about, like, it's. I was just talking to Scott. He's like, oh, is it going to be a crazy weekend? I was like, yeah, we're not going super wild. He's like, after 30, it's not called going wild. It's called going mild. So that's what we're doing this weekend.
00:02:16.520 - 00:02:17.444, Speaker C: Go, Miles.
00:02:17.784 - 00:02:18.232, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:18.288 - 00:02:18.576, Speaker B: Wooden.
00:02:18.600 - 00:02:19.280, Speaker D: The hot tub.
00:02:19.392 - 00:02:22.208, Speaker C: Classic. Boys not. No girls allowed, baby.
00:02:22.296 - 00:02:23.216, Speaker B: No girls allowed.
00:02:23.280 - 00:02:24.000, Speaker C: No chicks.
00:02:24.112 - 00:02:24.896, Speaker B: Got to bring chicks.
00:02:24.920 - 00:02:25.800, Speaker D: That's too nice.
00:02:25.872 - 00:02:26.104, Speaker C: Nice.
00:02:26.144 - 00:02:26.904, Speaker B: So nice.
00:02:26.944 - 00:02:28.084, Speaker C: Soak stuff.
00:02:31.064 - 00:02:37.318, Speaker D: I'm enjoying my thirties more than my twenties. Just, you know, just to put it out there. It's a chill about it.
00:02:37.496 - 00:02:41.090, Speaker C: That was my suspicion, too. Seems like thirties. That's a good age to be.
00:02:41.122 - 00:02:43.514, Speaker B: Thirty's hype. Early thirties. Real hype.
00:02:43.594 - 00:02:45.586, Speaker D: Are you two sub 30 or over 30?
00:02:45.730 - 00:02:46.666, Speaker B: Sub 30.
00:02:46.810 - 00:02:48.922, Speaker C: Sub 30. Wow.
00:02:48.978 - 00:02:49.458, Speaker D: Get ready.
00:02:49.506 - 00:02:51.506, Speaker C: We're right there, though. I'm 29.
00:02:51.650 - 00:02:53.894, Speaker B: So we're pushing up against it.
00:02:54.714 - 00:02:56.114, Speaker D: We talked some crypto.
00:02:56.274 - 00:02:58.106, Speaker C: Yeah. Before we painted too vivid of a.
00:02:58.130 - 00:02:59.314, Speaker E: Picture with the hot tub here.
00:02:59.354 - 00:03:01.882, Speaker C: Let's get into crypto a little bit. Should we do.
00:03:01.898 - 00:03:02.774, Speaker B: So? We've got.
00:03:03.434 - 00:03:44.420, Speaker C: Yeah, let's do some predictions, because I think Coinbase earnings are actually going to come out during this recording. So just to refresh people a little bit, maybe I'll actually share my screen. One sec. Just so we can recap how Coinbase did over the course of last year. They break out, basically. They've got two buckets with different subgroups underneath, but they've got transaction revenue and they've got subscription and services revenue. Obviously, transaction revenue is the bulk of their business, but Wall street cares a lot about subscription services because the general perception is transaction revenue is going to trend down towards zero over time.
00:03:44.420 - 00:04:08.586, Speaker C: So they really want to grow that subscription services part of their revenue. Within transaction revenue. They break it out in between consumer and institutional. The consumer bucket is much larger just because of the amount of fees. You know, it's kind of an unspoken thing, I guess it's spoken. But the fees that consumers get charged are much, much higher. Retail gets charged much higher fees on Coinbase than the institute in the institutional.
00:04:08.610 - 00:04:09.674, Speaker B: Part of their client base.
00:04:09.794 - 00:04:56.722, Speaker C: And then for subscription and services, they break it out between blockchain rewards, which is staking basically custodial fee revenue, interest income, which is generated largely based on their partnership with Circle, the center consortium, and then other subscription and services, which is kind of just a hodgepodge of different bets. It's kind of like Coinbase one, things like that. And I guess if you look at it in terms of their profitability. So theres net revenue income and adjusted EBITDA. I was going back and Brian guided towards. Theres a change in philosophy at Coinbase, which is they basically had a goal to make all their money during bull markets and they were going to break even during these sorts of bear periods. That has changed now.
00:04:56.722 - 00:05:22.654, Speaker C: And they have since guided that they want to be profitable in all market conditions, although the CFO did walk it back a little and say, well, we're not committing to that in 2023. We want to see absolute growth in EBITDA. So classic the CFO kind of walking aback a little. I'd be curious. I have some specific thoughts, but I would love to get your guys thoughts on what are you thinking about for q one. How do you think it's going to look?
00:05:22.774 - 00:05:57.456, Speaker B: I think there are a couple of things that I'm looking at. Maybe we can break it down. So on the revenue side of things, I would assume that q one revenue will look pretty similar to q four, but potentially higher. And if you look at, I bet the user base has actually shrunk a little bit. And I bet you'll see downloads of the app, for example, are down, but you have higher ETH prices and higher, I mean, higher crypto prices across the board with higher interest rates, which I think will drive higher revenue. So, like, first prediction I would have is higher revenue. A second prediction I would have is on the earnings side.
00:05:57.456 - 00:06:52.260, Speaker B: Those are always a little tougher to predict, but I think. I think it'll look pretty good, actually, because they had some that, I mean, they cut a ton of people, huge layouts, huge layoffs, and I don't know, like what percentage of their expenses come from personnel, but you got to assume it was pretty high with like several thousand people, and they had huge layoffs. So I bet their earnings will also look pretty good. Um, would have to assume that they have do a lot of talk about like regular regulatory pressure, both on the staking products side of things and then their, their wells notice. Um, and I bet that'll be like the main focus of this. And then, uh, one interesting thing that I bet, like Main, main Street or Wall street, like, won't really talk about is, um, the new sources of revenue. But I'd be curious to see how they start talking about their international futures markets, how they start providing guidance around the l two around base.
00:06:52.260 - 00:07:00.104, Speaker B: That's what I think will actually be the most interesting aspect of this that probably Wall street will skip over. So those are my high level predictions.
00:07:00.644 - 00:08:01.908, Speaker E: Totally agree with all those, I would say. In addition, just breaking down this chart right here, consumer, I would say, is probably going to be pretty similar, if not a bit higher, in terms of net revenue from transaction revenue, institutional, I would imagine it's actually going to be pretty far down. Post FTX, I would imagine that a lot of institutions just, frankly stopped trading. And I think in Q four, you had a lot of rebalancing and tax loss harvesting that attributed to the 13 million that you see in that column. The one that I think is going to be most interesting, which won't show up in Q one, but I think will absolutely be present in Q two, and they'll probably talk about it or guide towards it. In the call is the actual blockchain rewards subscriptions and services revenue. I think Post Shanghai, a number of institutional partners put ETH into the staking program that they had, and a lot of that, I'd say all of that is probably ETH staking.
00:08:01.908 - 00:08:13.222, Speaker E: I'm sure there's some other staking opportunities that exist or persist, but I would imagine that in Q two that's going to jump the most. So whether or not they talk about it, I don't know. And it's not going to show up.
00:08:13.278 - 00:08:14.214, Speaker C: In Q one earnings.
00:08:14.254 - 00:08:17.674, Speaker E: But blockchain rewards is the one that I'm tracking the most.
00:08:18.654 - 00:08:46.834, Speaker C: Preston Michael, real quick, I completely agree with you on the blockchain rewards, and those are denominated. Those staking revenues are denominated in ETH. So even if they basically stay constant, the price appreciation is going to do very well for that particular line item. I would push back maybe a little bit on the institutional part of your observation because, I mean, maybe just a question to you. Obviously, crypto has done super well year to date. Who do you think has been buying? Do you think that's been institutional driven or retail driven?
00:08:49.974 - 00:09:25.664, Speaker E: I would say it's probably more retail than institutional, but I think a lot of, I guess the comparison that I have, well, the comparison that I have is from Q four to Q one. And I think a lot of the institutions were tax lost harvesting at the end of last year. And so that's where a lot of that activity was driven from. There has been price appreciation in January, and that was probably a lot of institutions rebuying. So maybe this is flat, maybe it's even up. I don't know. But I do think that institutional relative to consumer isn't going to grow as much.
00:09:27.384 - 00:10:01.404, Speaker C: Yeah, you might be right. I went back and skimmed the analyst notes from Q four, and there actually was a disclosure there that there was an inbound in interest on the institutional side for prime. So they were onboarding a whole bunch of customers in Q four. They did walk that back, though, and say, typically this relative balance between the retail and institutional part of their business doesn't change all that much. But I don't know. I'm not really sure. I don't really think retail is back in this market yet.
00:10:02.064 - 00:10:03.896, Speaker D: I feel like they're not. I agree.
00:10:04.000 - 00:10:39.820, Speaker E: I completely agree with that. The one thing that I will say is that in Q four, late Q four or maybe it was Q one. They did switch everybody over from pro, who was a consumer, from pro to advanced trading. And so there have been some product updates that I personally have found to be on the, uh, consumer side to be really beneficial. That's kind of what I'm basing in terms of, you know, where this activity is coming from relative to the institutional side. Um, anecdotally also, just like institutions were not very active in q one because they were trying to pick up the pieces of what happened after fdis.
00:10:40.012 - 00:11:28.644, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, Coinbase has this, you know, Jason, just in response to your question about. About baseball, Coinbase has this framework that they used to talk to their analysts into Wall street. They call it their 70 2010 framework, and they say about 70% of our resources and focus is dedicated to our core business. So basically everything that were talking about, 20% is allocated towards more strategic long term pursuits, and then 10% is their risk taking, venture type investments within their product portfolio, which I actually think is. It's easy to understand and probably a pretty decent framework for owning a business. So I kind of agree. I think base is the wildcard, but that would be firmly in the 10% bucket, so I doubt it gets much airtime.
00:11:28.984 - 00:11:35.120, Speaker E: That framework was started by Google in the early two thousands, and it was.
00:11:35.152 - 00:11:37.432, Speaker B: All about 20% of time or something.
00:11:37.488 - 00:11:38.272, Speaker C: Goes to the end.
00:11:38.328 - 00:11:39.864, Speaker B: They also work on anything.
00:11:40.024 - 00:11:54.254, Speaker E: They also did the 20% time for the engineers and 70% is how were going to make money in the next three years. 20% is how were going to make money in three to five years. And 10% is how were going to make money after the next five years.
00:11:56.354 - 00:12:34.938, Speaker D: Preston, I havent looked too much into Coinbases financials, but what this tells me is that, a, theyre not leaving the US. All of this is basically us revenue or us centric, especially on the retail side. And two, you know, like the staking arguments or I guess the wells notice hasn't formally turned into a suit yet, but, like, they're going to fight that tooth and nail. Like, that's one of their only at least steady revenue segments that has a chance to, you know, five or ten x. So I don't know, it seems like Brian is trying to set up a straw man for like, you know, we're really going to leave if. If forced to, but at the same time, like, the math wouldn't bear that out at all.
00:12:34.986 - 00:12:35.176, Speaker C: Like.
00:12:35.210 - 00:12:41.304, Speaker D: Like, if Coinbase left the US, if Coinbase gave up on staking, I don't know how much of Coinbase would really be left.
00:12:41.844 - 00:13:05.684, Speaker E: Just, just to reiterate, I think I said this a couple of weeks ago, but like, leaving the US doesn't mean they're leaving. Like they're still going to have offices in the US. It means like the technical headquarters is going to be based somewhere else. But like, nothing changes. The product is still served to us customers, they still make us money and pay taxes for those us revenues. But it's just that, you know, the technical, like, headquarters would be in London or something.
00:13:06.224 - 00:13:27.360, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So I guess we'll see. I guess the, just the last thing is that, that interest expense that's really been carrying their whole services and subscription bucket of revenue, I think it's probably too late. I like that USDC deep. I think that happened in March. And then there's been a draining of. Right.
00:13:27.360 - 00:14:11.764, Speaker C: There's been, you know, some seven or $8 billion worth of market cap that's migrated out of USDC and into tether. I frankly don't know how to forecast that because that even that market cap moving to tether doesn't even necessarily mean that the portion that they generate, they generate their interest on is like, they generate interest that's on USDC that's custodied at Coinbase. So I don't even know if that blip ultimately ends up impacting that. But it is worth calling it out because that is the part of their, that's the part of the services and subscription, everybody that's basically been carrying that whole number. And to be fair, to be fair to Wall street, they've questioned that. I'm not really sure it deserves to be in there, frankly. I don't know if interest, expenses, subscription.
00:14:12.624 - 00:14:35.214, Speaker D: They'Re not likely to get more people to put a more principal into it at the size that they've been able to historically, or B, you know, take advantage of the same level of interest rates. Just like doesn't feel like that's in the cards, giving everything that's going on, you know, with the regional bank. I guess it's not even a crisis, or what's the name of it?
00:14:35.514 - 00:14:37.934, Speaker E: Implosion, kerfuffle.
00:14:39.314 - 00:15:07.194, Speaker D: I feel like that's one of the things. This is totally unrelated, but I feel like there's this intentional, and Michael and I have talked about this before, there's this intentional memory holding, or trying to keep these headlines out of Bloomberg or New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It's how many banks have blown up at this point, and we're still not allowed to call it a crisis. Just completely crazy. To me, it feels like there's some serious just sheeple hurting going on, at least for the mainstream media outlets.
00:15:07.314 - 00:15:23.652, Speaker B: It does feel interesting. In 2008, everyone in the world knew that these banks were blowing up and that everything was collapsing. And today you have, the size of the banks blowing up is actually much larger. And I feel like nobody's really talking about it outside of Fintwood land.
00:15:23.828 - 00:15:30.384, Speaker D: Lesson there, there's a lesson there. I mean, the lesson there is that it's much worse than anybody is actually telling people.
00:15:30.884 - 00:15:51.992, Speaker E: Well, I will say, I mean, totally agree with all of that. So far, throughout all of this process, there's been exactly $0 lost for depositors. Like, there is an element of like, okay, sure, shareholders are done, bondholders are done. You know, the companies themselves are going through massive layoffs, but our consumers here.
00:15:52.048 - 00:15:53.204, Speaker D: Nothing to see here.
00:15:55.824 - 00:15:57.696, Speaker C: So liquidity problem is that it's obviously.
00:15:57.720 - 00:16:00.960, Speaker D: Probably that at all. Like what?
00:16:00.992 - 00:16:03.648, Speaker C: Like, I mean, but Michael, in 2008.
00:16:03.656 - 00:16:08.734, Speaker B: It was the same thing. I mean, the bank, the bank accounts were backed by FDIC in 2008 as well.
00:16:09.634 - 00:16:18.586, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a little bit different, because those were investment banks. And like, when Lehman brothers collapsed, there were a lot of clients who lost a lot of money. But I do think that there's an element.
00:16:18.770 - 00:16:27.738, Speaker B: I'm just saying, your argument that you're arguing that the, because depositors didn't get hurt, then it's not like a big mainstream thing.
00:16:27.866 - 00:16:58.084, Speaker E: No, no, it is. I'm saying I agree. I would say, you know, that being said, so far, nobody has lost money. Also, right now, I dont know. I saw the list yesterday of the after hours trading of ten different regional banks, and PAC west was at the top of the list, and they were down 60% after hours. So this isnt stopping yet. But how far can the FDIC go in vouchsafing news? How far? How deep are the pockets?
00:16:58.704 - 00:17:00.124, Speaker C: And is everybody?
00:17:00.764 - 00:17:01.664, Speaker B: How deep?
00:17:02.404 - 00:17:10.624, Speaker C: We find out the FDIC insurance fund was before all this, and it's not infinite. It's like 1120, $5 billion or something.
00:17:11.644 - 00:17:29.944, Speaker E: I guess what I'm saying is, we have staved off depositors losing money so far. I don't think it can go forever. It doesn't look like this is stopping. Something is going to have to give at some point. And the second that depositors start losing money, this is going to be like the biggest news story. I think, you know, people are going to be talking about.
00:17:30.104 - 00:17:46.376, Speaker D: I don't think any depositor is going to lose any money. I think we're just going to print infinite money. And just like, I agree, coming under the rug. Like, that's why we're not allowed to talk about it on the Internet or mainstream news. Just like need to go to the real sources to get that information. You know what I'm talking about.
00:17:46.400 - 00:17:49.044, Speaker E: Michael Vance, where's your tin foil?
00:17:51.994 - 00:17:55.654, Speaker D: There's some corners of the Internet where the real news is being reported.

00:19:13.224 - 00:19:17.566, Speaker C: Let's talk about blend. Yeah, blending.
00:19:17.630 - 00:19:18.342, Speaker B: Blur.
00:19:18.518 - 00:19:55.646, Speaker C: Yeah, let's talk about Blet. So Blur obviously is the NFT marketplace that launched earlier this year. They just announced something called blend, which is sort of the next evolution of NFT fi. It's a peer to peer NFT marketplace where there's a bunch of, I'll just give you my, I mean, there are a bunch of features on it. I think there's something that's very hard to digest about it because one of the things that it allows you to do is to buy now, pay later for nfts. And a lot of people have had a very negative reaction to that, myself included. But I think if you look at the design of this marketplace, there are actually some things that are pretty cool about it.
00:19:55.646 - 00:20:57.692, Speaker C: So basically it's just a marketplace similar sort of to something like Aave, where you can deposit, where lenders can lend to people who want to buy nfts and only put down a small amount of collateral. And there's some kind of cool mechanism design about how that actually works. Notably, they don't rely on oracles for price feeds. So because these are individualized loans and it's not peer to pool or something like that, individual lenders can set basically the interest rate that they're comfortable lending at. And the way they get around relying on an oracle is at any given time the lender can essentially trigger a dutch auction and wherein another lender can either scoop up the NFT at a higher interest rate or in the case that no lenders want to step in, they actually take possession of the collateral. We can dig into that. I think a lot of people have a lot of problems with that and see gamification there.
00:20:57.692 - 00:21:54.940, Speaker C: But the other thing that I thought was cool about this construction is they assume, I kind of see this in an evolution in, in crypto market structure where if you have these two sided marketplaces where youre relying on liquidity, in the very beginnings of Uniswap, you relied on retail liquidity for Amms then with uni v three. Well, in order to create a better borrower experience, kind of the demand side of the equation really. Theres more complexity thats needed to provide liquidity. And they were totally okay making that bet and blend basically came out and said, we are actually basing this. One of the assumptions in this marketplace working is the existence of more sophisticated lenders who can. And honestly just hearing them say that, I was like, that's probably the right assumption. I'm actually not sure that it makes sense for retail writ large to just be market makers can contribute passive liquidity.
00:21:54.940 - 00:22:02.164, Speaker C: It's hard to be a market maker. So this is just kind of me rambling about this protocol. But what's your guys take on this?
00:22:03.064 - 00:22:18.528, Speaker B: I love that blur is out here just launching a buy now, pay later thing for NFTs in this market. Like this market of all time for crypto, they're out there just doing like, oh yeah, buy now. Meanwhile, buy now, pay later is like collapsing in the fintech world.
00:22:18.616 - 00:22:19.244, Speaker D: Right?
00:22:19.744 - 00:22:21.472, Speaker E: My first reaction was you guys should.
00:22:21.488 - 00:22:27.414, Speaker D: Have read the room. Aren't they like doing a bunch of volume right now though?
00:22:28.834 - 00:22:32.854, Speaker E: Like they have, well, trading volume or lending volume?
00:22:33.154 - 00:22:34.134, Speaker D: Let's see.
00:22:34.714 - 00:22:37.618, Speaker B: I think one of the pumps, some NFT is like a zoo.
00:22:37.666 - 00:22:38.654, Speaker D: 17,000.
00:22:39.234 - 00:23:03.754, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean it's done well. The Vol, the volumes were, I would call it a successful launch. Also since the launch, like the floors of a couple of NFTs that have been, that are like featured on glenn really popped. Like Azuki's ran up from like 1514 or 15 to 18. And if you dig into the data, there's a lot of users buying Azukis with the buy now, pay later. Yep.
00:23:04.814 - 00:23:41.898, Speaker E: So, Mike, I agree with all that. I think the biggest thing in my mind is kind of the only thing that's left in Defi right now is retail. And there aren't any institutions that are stepping in and market making things or aren't any institutions that are like, going to be the initial backs off of liquidity for this ecosystem yet. Maybe it comes back eventually and it could be designed for that eventually. But I do think that we're in this place of, it's really only crypto whales and retail players that are in this ecosystem. So building that base of liquidity is going to be hard. If they can do it, that's going to be great.
00:23:41.898 - 00:23:57.266, Speaker E: But, yeah, I think the 30 hours dutch auction is tough because what that, frankly, means is you gotta be like, paying attention and that if that, you know, goes off the hours, you're not that long.
00:23:57.450 - 00:23:58.250, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:58.442 - 00:24:21.576, Speaker B: Can, can I tell you why? Mike, you, you've spent a lot more time digging into this than I have. But the reason I didn't like it was actually around their messaging. I think blur is really smart and like, pac man smart and stuff. And they've clearly, like, advanced the institutional NFT like, world in a good way and like, push competitors in the right direction. But they had their tweet thread announcement. There was like, one of the tweets is like every. I'm just going to read it.
00:24:21.576 - 00:24:55.324, Speaker B: Every trillion dollar market relies on financialization to scale. Nfts are no different. Instead of paying a million dollars for a house, buyers put $100,000 down and pay the rest through their mortgage. Without this mechanism, almost no one would be able to afford homes. So he's explaining, like, the mortgage market and then, but like, I think that's a pretty dangerous thing to do, to compare massive leverage and debt positions on these extremely volatile jpegs with the purchase of a home. And I think it sets this, like, dangerous mentality. I think people are going to get wrecked on this.
00:24:55.704 - 00:25:17.148, Speaker D: I do agree with that, though. It's just like a matter of whether it makes sense or is sustainable to lever up any asset in an attempt to buy it. So, like, buying a house, it sounds very sweet. You have a family, you go buy a house, american dream, whatever. You do that with commercial real estate, 90% loan to value. Everyone stops coming to the office. All of a sudden the portfolio is zero.
00:25:17.148 - 00:25:39.794, Speaker D: So is an NFT more like a house? Or is it more like commercial real estate? It's probably not similar to either. It's probably just Internet money with a picture on it. And do these things have any fundamental value? That's what the entire assumption of levering it up is based on. Or maybe it doesn't, and maybe it's all just mean value and it'll come back and it's a good way to speculate.
00:25:39.884 - 00:26:10.298, Speaker B: But it reminded me a little too much of, like, so affirm and Afterpay and Klarna are like the main buy now, pay later platforms. And they absolutely ripped from like 2019 to 2021. I think there was like 2018 or 2019. There was like 2 billion in buy now, pay later debt. Two years later, it increased ten x to like 25 billion. And if you look at the marketing of a lot of these buy now, pay later programs, they were like, this is really good for gig workers. This is great for young people with poor credit histories.
00:26:10.298 - 00:26:21.706, Speaker B: This is great for the unbanked. And it was like a similar kind of, like, I didn't like that messaging because you're kind of like, preying on those folks. Um, and it ended up completely backfiring for those people.
00:26:21.810 - 00:27:05.092, Speaker E: And in reality, it was great because of Zurp, you can get a zero interest loan on a mattress. Or like, you know, I I do find it interesting that financialization of PFP NFTs, particularly right now, is what theyre going after. And to Vances point, there is no fundamental utility. There is no fundamental value. We created these things so far, and they have value in a secondary marketplace, but it will lead to some people overextending and getting burned. And that, frankly, I think is probably not worth going super headfirst into this it ecosystem right now. But maybe there's enough liquidity.
00:27:05.092 - 00:27:08.884, Speaker E: Maybe there's enough liquidity on the lending side to actually make this work.
00:27:09.044 - 00:27:10.292, Speaker C: That's kind of the thing that I.
00:27:10.308 - 00:27:11.252, Speaker D: Keep going back to.
00:27:11.388 - 00:27:38.904, Speaker C: Let me just set up the overall, this kind of philosophical discussion. How much financialization is enough financial? Some amount of financialization is okay and good. Right. To use your example, Jason, of like, the mortgage, America had a social contract where they made a decision where owning a house is a good thing. That's not the case everywhere. Like, there are other countries where everyone just rents. We were like, we think it's a good thing to own your home, and basically everyone should lever up and buy their home and that'll be okay.
00:27:38.904 - 00:28:09.096, Speaker C: So, like, we all kind of thought that was good, but then, like, where's the line? Because now it's not small community banks that are lending to, you know, to people in their community. This rate, there's going to be none of them left. But really what happens is those are more like small distribution centers where these mortgages are originated. They're packaged up and then they're sold to people in Japan. And it's like, well, maybe that because you have a larger base of people that are willing to buy those mortgages, you get a better price. But is that really a better system? It's a philosophical question at a certain point.
00:28:09.120 - 00:28:56.840, Speaker E: I mean, so the two points coming out of that are, number one, a house is a fundamentally useful asset. Whether or not you live in it or somebody else does, someone's going to be living in it, most likely. And number two, the other reason why homeownership became such a american mainstay is because overall, the residential housing market has gone up over the last 50 years, and that became the largest asset for most families. And that, I think, is if you don't own and you rent, you miss out on that wealth creation possibility over the last multiple decades. So I agree, there does need to be some financialization. It's interesting to have it be in this ecosystem. I guess maybe the point that I'm trying to make is the messaging around it and comparing it to mortgages is to Yano's point is, is not something.
00:28:56.872 - 00:28:57.880, Speaker C: That I thought that was bad.
00:28:57.952 - 00:29:40.114, Speaker B: Let me make one more financial. In my mind, financialization equals good. In my mind, it unlocks a bunch of opportunities, and that's fine. And like, if you think that NFTs are just like, are you either think that NFTs are just tokens with pictures, in which case, like, yeah, you should financialize these tokens. And then on the other side, like, you think that NFTs are this really valuable thing that like, creator, in which case, yeah, financialization is also good. It was the messaging, and, um, it wasn't just that messaging too. It was actually like, there's this strategy that they did that I thought was like, also not great, where you can, um, they're incentivizing loans on the platform through these things called lending points that where, where the more lending points that you get, the more, the more of a, the next airdrop you get.
00:29:40.114 - 00:30:13.596, Speaker B: And in the mortgage land, which were like, if you just keep going with that analogy, there's this thing called reg n regulation n that it's known as the mortgages acts and practices. It's the mortgage advertising role, basically. And it prevents a bunch of over promoting and over advertising and doing deceptive advertising and mortgages. And to me, when I read this, I'm like, you are incentivizing people to do more than they should on this platform to farm next Airdrop.
00:30:13.740 - 00:30:41.116, Speaker C: Oh, I agree with you. But my understanding of their point system was that they changed around. So they're incentivizing the lenders, not the people who want to borrow an NFT buy, not pay later. So they're incentivizing people to provide liquidity and extend credit to people who want to buy. Because I think they're concerned of everyone. First of all, either gaming, like playing some kind of game where you set unreasonably high interest rate and then people default on it. No one wants to pick it up.
00:30:41.116 - 00:30:57.504, Speaker C: They scoop it up for a reasonable price and dump it immediately. That's the game that everyone has already outline. But I think what they want to do is they want to provide a liquid market of sophisticated lenders. And those points are pushing people to not pull out, basically and do that. That was my understanding of those points.
00:30:58.764 - 00:31:08.664, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, its the same way that they incentivize the trading of nfts as well, which is you get points whenever you put out an offer, not when you buy something.
00:31:09.044 - 00:31:18.714, Speaker B: Mike, do you feel comfortable sharing the, like what you're explaining to me about the difference between, like, Len lending and Laurie on like Aave versus compound versus blur or on blend, do you.
00:31:19.374 - 00:31:45.220, Speaker C: Well, it was kind of, I mean, what I was trying to. I think it's the look, I actually agree with everything you guys are saying. I just think it's important to provide, like some kind of devil's advocate. Um, because I really do think, like, so I. Like, for instance, I think being able to buy and sell stocks is good. Do I think it's great that Robin Hood basically pushes people into options because those are the highest margin products and that's what the order flow that Citadel wants to buy. I don't think that's good.
00:31:45.220 - 00:31:51.788, Speaker C: So there's like some, there's a bell curve of financialization that I think is basically accept. You see what I did there?
00:31:51.876 - 00:32:23.654, Speaker D: Yeah, but like, like, I feel like this argument does not actually hold water when you just have, like, other examples. Sugar is bad for you. Should we allow children to drink orange juice? Probably not, but that's like part of a balanced breakfast and also part of like, the food pyramid. Like, that's not great. Every asset class benefits from financialization. Like, why shouldn't crypto? Have you seen the terms of auto loans? Like, interest only auto loans that jack up and refinance to whatever the new interest rate that the Fed decides on. Those are pretty toxic and poisonous.
00:32:23.654 - 00:32:41.722, Speaker D: And not only do you have the industry for the loaning of that, you have the industry for the buying of those loans and chopping those up and syndicating those to pension funds. I don't know, I feel like crypto always gets put in this kind of like ideological corner of like, you know, you shouldn't be doing those things. And those arguments just like never hold water if you look at the real world.
00:32:41.858 - 00:32:56.890, Speaker C: I, I agree with that. I go, and you know what, even as we're here, because the fundamental question that we're asking is do nfts have value? And if nfts have value, I think we would all say, then you should be able to some degree of financialization is, you know, right and good and acceptable.
00:32:57.002 - 00:32:58.962, Speaker D: Define value. So like, does a car?
00:32:59.018 - 00:32:59.938, Speaker C: Yeah, well, sure.
00:32:59.986 - 00:33:08.564, Speaker D: Like, I think that's the place. But like, what if you're like not doing anything with your life, like, and you're just like speculating on this car cause you want a cool one? I don't know.
00:33:09.104 - 00:33:20.684, Speaker E: I agree with the analogy. And, you know, six to 8oz of orange juice in the morning is, is probably healthy for you, but you know, 60 to 80oz of orange juice is probably gonna give you diabetes.
00:33:22.504 - 00:34:02.360, Speaker C: I agree. I think it's kind of everything in, in moderation, but it is. Cause, you know, when we're here sitting and saying, is it right and good to be able to take out a loan basically to buy an NFT, where like, oh, I don't know about that and sort of making a value judgment there. But none of us question the ability to take out a loan on say ethereum or bitcoin or something like that. And 99% of the world would say that's completely unacceptable level of risk and that's not right and good. So do I think the marketing was a little aggressive? Do I think this is probably going to end in tears at some point? Probably. Do I have a philosophical problem with it? No.
00:34:02.360 - 00:34:25.150, Speaker C: And the other thing that we haven't even really talked about was just like close your eyes and imagine it's like a year and a half from now. The bull market is returning. You have two options. You can either buy your NFT at full price, or you can buy now, pay later. Our value judgments aside, people are just going to do that. Or you have two options.
00:34:25.272 - 00:34:38.134, Speaker E: You can sell your NFT for some asset for ETH, or you can borrow against your NFT to get some liquidity on it. Like these things should exist. It's just a question of how pervasive they need to be.
00:34:38.514 - 00:35:04.854, Speaker D: You're always going to have people wanting to borrow against any asset that they own. I think the question is like will there be lenders for that requisite borrow flow? And this actually makes it possible. So I'm all there for expanding the use cases of crypto. I feel no moral high ground over anybody borrowing or trading or being degenerate. Like if you want to do that, go light yourself on fire. I might even lend to you to go do that. But like, you know, it is what it is.
00:35:04.854 - 00:35:06.194, Speaker D: I don't see the problem.
00:35:07.054 - 00:35:11.030, Speaker E: Just make sure you get the notifications turned on loud and yeah, make sure.
00:35:11.062 - 00:35:13.022, Speaker D: You got paid your day, like don't.
00:35:13.038 - 00:35:15.114, Speaker C: Like go on a camping trip after.
00:35:17.014 - 00:35:18.594, Speaker D: Hours is not that long.
00:35:19.484 - 00:35:45.906, Speaker C: I have one more question on this before you guys move on. So the way that buy now, pay later works, the monetization scheme in e commerce is. I dont think its a zurp thing, Michael. My understanding of the way it works is actually you get a 0% APR loan because merchandisers are actually subsidizing that cost because the amount, like your average, I forget what the unit is, its the amount that you spend on one average session or purchase or something like that goes up three or four times.
00:35:46.050 - 00:35:59.354, Speaker E: So yeah, yeah, but the platforms still have to pay the full price. So the affirms put the money up and they borrow to be able to make that interest free loan. So that's more of what I know.
00:35:59.474 - 00:36:35.174, Speaker C: Got it, got it. So my question to you guys would be do you think there's ever a situation where blend goes to basically charges NFT collections when they do their initial mint or drop or something like that to offer, buy now, pay later? Because just look at the impact that it's had on Azuki's and miladis and punks. Like if I were blend, I would be like hey, we can, we are, we've got this market of people that are going to offer loans against your NFTs and that's going to offer, that's going to result clearly in a higher floor price. But we got to get a little something something.
00:36:37.074 - 00:37:12.518, Speaker D: I think like the primary asset issue is issuer facilitating leverage. Trading effectively of these nfts is probably a nonstarter. I think it's something that you'll see like the cloak and dagger like governance, you know. Yeah, we're going to vote this in. We're going to get it going. And I think it's going to be really good for projects until it's really terrible where there is no way that you can short nfts. Right now this is probably like, you know, theoretically if I were to go off and try to short nfts, I would probably try to find an NFT perpendicular to short and then I would try to immediately go off and get the spot, NFT, whatever it might be.
00:37:12.518 - 00:37:55.234, Speaker D: And literally, the hard part about shorting crypto is that especially if it's a closely held coin, you can't make people give you their spot so that you can sell it into the market and close out your short on the burp. What you have to do is you have to actually go off and source that and horse trade and it's extremely difficult. But on this you can literally just take people's nfts. So I think you're going to see these things pump and then you're going to see someone smart like the GCR of NFT trading, who knows, it's like a smaller cottage industry, but somebody's going to take a shot at all of these that have all the potential borrow flow that you can take and use to short. So double edged sword to say the least.
00:37:55.654 - 00:37:58.154, Speaker E: Who's going to be the George Soros of nfTs?
00:37:58.574 - 00:38:31.392, Speaker D: I mean, you're going to make like a $100 doing this stuff. So like maybe the, like, never going to be worth it, but like, I don't know, the, the peak valuations of like bored API Club and stuff like that, like that would have been extremely juicy. We had some guy in the last cycle approaching us trying to get all the top shot NFT cards so you could short them. It was like this like Rinky dank operation. It like didn't end up working like this is, this actually makes it possible, which is pretty scary. The NFT had a rough year, so.
00:38:31.488 - 00:38:33.640, Speaker E: Yeah, they did.
00:38:33.752 - 00:39:06.788, Speaker C: They did. But I don't know, I sort of, I kind of am with you. I, look, I. Jason, I agree with you to just bring it full circle. I think the way that it was marketed and something, even after all this discussion, buy now, pay later for nfts, I feel pretty confident that retail's not going to be on the winning end of that. But I also think you kind of have to choose, like, do you want a free market where people are allowed to make these decisions, or do you want a market of tradfi where it's regulated all the way up to here and this is what you're allowed to do versus not. And I kind of.
00:39:06.788 - 00:39:15.372, Speaker C: Maybe there are people out there that have thought in much more detail about me, and maybe that's a false trade off, but that's kind of what I think of always.
00:39:15.428 - 00:39:17.204, Speaker E: I do think that whatever they want.
00:39:17.284 - 00:39:19.620, Speaker D: That'S my personal philosophy.
00:39:19.812 - 00:39:45.474, Speaker E: Same. I do think that we're going to see a lot more NFT x defi financialization opportunities. There's going to be more amms at launch. There's going to be fungible tokens that are associated with these collections. That's going to beget liquidity on these amms. We're going to see a lot more financialization of nfts. And frankly, broadly, philosophically, I agree with all of that.
00:39:45.474 - 00:39:49.914, Speaker E: It just depends on how you want to approach it and who you're trying to attract.
00:39:50.504 - 00:40:41.488, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you guys want to chat briefly? I know, I think Coinbase earnings is going to come out too, and I want to check the results. But CrvUSD launched this week, which is pretty cool. So I think we covered this a little while ago when we were talking about some of the new stables that are getting launched. So I would put go sort of in this bucket, but this is kind of the convergence of a couple of different protocols that started out with separate business models but are now converging. So I would put Makerdao in that camp and Aave and curve, but just to do a level set on what curve is and why they're doing this and how it sort of makes sense is curve is obviously a stable coin swap, sort of like uniswap, but instead of their kind of volatile assets, they'll only do like stable coins or pairs of something that are similar in price. So something like steak to ETH.
00:40:41.488 - 00:41:27.140, Speaker C: And they kind of dominate that pool. And they've been talking about launching a stablecoin for a little while. We're recording this on Friday the fourth, and it looks like the first loan for CRB USD went live. And I guess the two things to note here is it's going to be a revenue driver for them. So, yeah, you basically have to borrow and there's an interest rate that ends up getting paid, which would be pretty good for procur because it's an alternative revenue stream. You could also imagine. I think the reason this makes sense, and one of our analysts, Dan Smith, is super bullish on this, is right now there are these, I'm blanking on the name, the three pool, basically, with USDC, USDT and Dai.
00:41:27.140 - 00:42:15.286, Speaker C: You could imagine a situation where a curve basically puts its own stablecoin in there. And what's interesting is theres this similar to Coinbase, where theres going to be the race to zero in terms of fees. I think the general sentiment is that theres going to be fee compression in DeFi as well. If you had a pool where CRV was one of the assets that was in that pool, you could drop the trading fees to zero because youre earning interest income from the borrow of CRB. So its a way to subsidize going to, going to zero cost. The other thing that's sort of cool about CRV, this is a little wonky, but it's an innovation in the liquidation mechanism. They have something called llama, which is a little bit of a new twist on an amm.
00:42:15.286 - 00:43:01.702, Speaker C: So the way that liquidations happened historically is there's an oracle, and once your loan to value or whatever crosses over a certain threshold, then you basically just get liquidated. And some surgery understands that, and they liquidate. And there's a, there's a price for doing that. My general understanding of this, and I've only sort of dug in high level, is that when you reach a certain, like, health check or health threshold, part of your possession gets sold off, and it's replaced with curve, the stablecoin itself, which is actually pretty interesting. It's a much better user experience. So you don't just like, you know, tick over a certain threshold and your entire position is liquidated. It's a pretty cool, pretty cool mechanism.
00:43:01.702 - 00:43:10.194, Speaker C: So that was a lot of me talking. I don't know how much you guys have dug into this, or what your thoughts are on this new wave of stablecoins, or Kirk in general.
00:43:10.694 - 00:43:56.346, Speaker B: Typically, I have a really high level view of this, which is that typically been pretty bearish on these protocol based stablecoins, but I was ragging on Ave stablecoin go when they announced it. Um, but this one, seeing how they've structured it, makes me think that they're just going after maker and that they're going after die, basically. Um, and like, if you. I mean, I've spent a lot of time at maker, and, like, it's, uh. I mean, I think. I think Baker didn't move on some things, and, like, they've gotten, like, a little bit stagnant. And, uh, there's some, like, key people who have left maker recently, and I think curve sees, like, this huge opportunity to go after maker right now, and thats my, like, zooing the multi.
00:43:56.346 - 00:43:59.894, Speaker B: Thats what I would assume is the multi year vision here, is to go after maker.
00:44:00.914 - 00:44:18.818, Speaker D: I think the liquidation mechanism is cool. You are basically warehousing the risk of that liquidation within the curve stablecoin itself. But it certainly would help, and its certainly something that maker doesnt have in the worst case scenario, where instead they just start printing maker, which is really a bad idea.
00:44:18.866 - 00:44:21.556, Speaker B: The lending, liquidating amm thing that they have.
00:44:21.580 - 00:44:22.028, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:44:22.156 - 00:44:24.304, Speaker B: Continuously liquidates and.
00:44:24.764 - 00:45:02.044, Speaker D: Yeah, but it does it piecemeal so that you don't have, like, you know, hey, maker liquidators, like, everyone wake up. Like, there's a 400,000 ETH slug hitting the market. Like, is anybody prepared to bid? And frankly, when all that stuff was happening last year around, like, I think were in June, the liquidations, like, seeing those come down the pike of, like, know, there's a hundred thousand youth about. It's just like, how is the system going to deal with this in a time where there is very little tradfi liquidity, very little, you know, retail liquidity, whatever. But it did work perfectly, frankly. There was on another black Tuesday, or whatever that incident was.
00:45:03.064 - 00:45:03.480, Speaker C: That's.
00:45:03.512 - 00:45:08.576, Speaker E: That's because we had someone on the Oracles putting the thumb on the scale. I don't know if you remember that.
00:45:08.640 - 00:45:35.624, Speaker D: Yeah, I do remember that. There was a. Yeah, there were some fortunate oracle delays, but, like, not having that as good, I just kind of wonder, like, you know, curve is now emitted a lot of its own token. There's not, like, a ton of rewards go around. Like, a lot of them already being claimed by, like, the people who are doing the curve gauge farming. Like, how do you bootstrap from zero to. I think maker has what's, like, maker's TVL 7 billion or something.
00:45:35.624 - 00:46:01.494, Speaker D: 5,000,000,002 of that's USDC. Probably three of billion of that. Them is ETH. Like, how do you actually meaningfully take share? The reason that Michael and I still use Maker is because, like, we know that it's battle tested. I don't. I don't think the appetite to put large amounts of Ethan to new code bases is super high right now. So I think that's kind of my question is, like, how impactful is this, really? But, yeah, I mean, the, the curve team is, is smart.
00:46:01.494 - 00:46:06.618, Speaker D: You know, if nothing else, like, they'll. They'll figure out a way to game it effectively.
00:46:06.806 - 00:46:55.142, Speaker E: Totally agree with all of that. I think the only kind of perspective that I would include, um, this past week, we've spent, uh, some time with, um, so regulators and talking to them about, you know, what their priorities are, especially from a crypto perspective, for the next six months. I think the, the sentiment coming out of those conversations is there's going to be a bill that includes and mostly features stable coins as the primary kind of component of the regulation. I'm not saying that I actually agree with this is an interesting model. The new liquidation methods are awesome. It's going to be really difficult for a decentralized stablecoin, I think, to integrate into a legal framework in the US going forward. And so when we're talking about how.
00:46:55.158 - 00:46:55.958, Speaker C: Do you break through, how do you.
00:46:55.966 - 00:47:29.924, Speaker E: Get to the size of maker, maker already has the distribution to be able to have dai in all the places that it already has it integrated, like Coinbase or any other centralized providers, it should be an uphill battle, I think after this bill gets released, and I think the text is going to get released in the next couple of months, it will be difficult, I think, to be able to compete with some of the more centralized stablecoins, unfortunately. But that's the broad stablecoin perspective that became more apparent this week.
00:47:31.244 - 00:48:13.686, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a question. This is a little in the weeds of curve and their whole tokenomics and everything, but I think people initially sort of got excited by this because what I was mentioning before, it's a way to subsidize fees on some of their pools. And I think people generally agree it's going to be a race to the bottom. The question that I have for you though, is sort of curves, tokenomics are sort of like bitcoin in that you sort of need the number to go up. They live and die by liquidity, and the way that they direct liquidity to their pools is by emissions. And what they don't, they have a just like bitcoin, they have a deflationary supply schedule. I think it's like every year it's like 15% lower.
00:48:13.686 - 00:48:55.970, Speaker C: So they want to have basically a constant amount of dollar denominated value that they can use to incentivize liquidity into different pools. And so that's why the gauge and the lock rate that ve vote escrow mechanism is super important, because they want to incentivize people to lock that curve up and not to go and sell it onto the open market. I feel like if they have their own sort of horse in that race, then doesn't that. I feel like that takes away an enormous incentive for other people to lock their curve. This is a really smart team. I'm sure they've thought about this, but I feel like it does risk destroying the golden goose kind of, or the. The long game that they're playing.
00:48:55.970 - 00:48:57.818, Speaker C: So I don't know if you guys have thought about that.
00:48:57.946 - 00:49:37.194, Speaker E: Well, the thing that I have thought about, independent of this launch is, you know, curve launched, what was it, August 2020? And if you remember, the largest lock at the time which gave you the most vote escrow curve was four years. So we're coming up on a year left of where I would assume most people put their locks. And so not only is it going to be hard because youve got less supply and less incentives and number has to go up for those incentives to stay, youre going to have a lot of unlocking of the token itself in not that long of a time. So its going to be really interesting to see how that plays out as well.
00:49:38.574 - 00:50:14.934, Speaker D: Preston, theres a lot of those cases, not just curve either. If you look at Arbitrum, if you look at optimism, theres going to be multibillion dollar unlocks by early 2024. I think a lot of these are running towards product market fit and token economics that make sense before those unlocks hit. And frankly, my expectations of where the market is going, I think that a lot of these things might peak before the cycle itself peaks. Youre early at this point. Your unlocks are coming in six months and you don't have things figured out. Like, that's how I would at least kind of think about it.
00:50:16.234 - 00:50:28.294, Speaker C: Yeah. They're a smart team. I really like the stuff they ship and generally how they think about stuff. So, yeah, no, that's cool. I don't know. All right. What do you guys want to.
00:50:30.154 - 00:50:30.538, Speaker B: Have.
00:50:30.586 - 00:50:32.282, Speaker C: Earnings come out yet for Coinbase?
00:50:32.378 - 00:50:34.122, Speaker E: I was just tracking. I haven't seen anything.
00:50:34.178 - 00:50:58.346, Speaker C: Maybe we could talk a little bit about, I mean, I know we've talked about this before, but sort of in more dgen sort of land here we've got pippit coin, which depending on, I guess, how you're allocated, is the gift that keeps on giving or it's like the bane of your existence, but that thing just keeps running. I think the market cap on it is 700 million or something right now.
00:50:58.410 - 00:51:04.346, Speaker B: Last time I checked, the market wants things to rip. Right now. It's just people.
00:51:04.450 - 00:51:05.506, Speaker E: People want it.
00:51:05.610 - 00:51:06.774, Speaker B: People want it.
00:51:07.514 - 00:51:08.414, Speaker D: That's why.
00:51:09.114 - 00:51:24.978, Speaker C: Yeah, that's nuts. It's really, it's done a lot more than I thought it was. It was going to, for sure. We talked about that being an indicator. I'm curious, like, do you view that as just kind of noise and the markets do, what's going to do you take away from that?
00:51:25.026 - 00:51:25.490, Speaker E: Not at all.
00:51:25.522 - 00:51:29.266, Speaker D: No, you need to read deeply into that stuff even though it seems so silly.
00:51:29.290 - 00:51:36.104, Speaker B: And that says you got to pull up your four Chan account. You got a roll right here. You got to look.
00:51:37.004 - 00:51:40.344, Speaker D: Would this, would this have happened in Q four of last year?
00:51:41.164 - 00:51:41.860, Speaker B: No.
00:51:42.012 - 00:51:46.612, Speaker D: Q three, probably not. Q two, certainly not. Like it's been a year since this.
00:51:46.708 - 00:51:51.316, Speaker E: I was going to say, I don't know if post Luna this happens in 2022 at all.
00:51:51.460 - 00:51:51.924, Speaker B: Totally.
00:51:51.964 - 00:52:31.230, Speaker D: And like you're seeing these big LsT farms, you're seeing these like l one meme coins. And theres also a reason why you dont see this on any other chain. ETH is the only chain with enough liquidity for this to possibly happen. And look at the burn today is 8000 ETH burned. You got ten k spent on ETH transaction fees overall today. Youre probably looking at a scenario where if we get back to four or 5000, were going to be breaking all time high fee revenues pretty easily by the start of the run. And so people are starting to, and it's not just about the trading volume.
00:52:31.230 - 00:53:02.538, Speaker D: People are starting to self organize into these little groups that are searching for $10 million market cap meme coins. And the hot ball of money is turning itself over and it's going around and around and that's what you need. You need a sentiment recovery and you need a credit recovery. And we still haven't seen that, but we're starting to check the boxes off. Like, I talked to some guy who works at a different fund over the weekend and they're more of a trading fund. And he was like, dude, like, my dopamine receptors are just so shot. Like I need something to trade, like at all times.
00:53:02.538 - 00:53:05.814, Speaker D: Like, you know, Pepe has been like really like big for me. It's like.
00:53:08.474 - 00:53:11.234, Speaker C: Really, really water.
00:53:11.314 - 00:53:31.572, Speaker D: Like, you know, take a walk around the block. But I think it's big that people are starting to do this stuff and even like the nft five stuff on, on blur and blend and all that stuff. Like that's great, too. And guess what, it's just burning a bunch of ETH. So I'm here for it. Also, NfT five is only an ethel one phenomenon, just for the record.
00:53:31.628 - 00:53:32.116, Speaker C: Yep.
00:53:32.220 - 00:53:33.984, Speaker D: So thanks for the comment.
00:53:35.364 - 00:54:05.930, Speaker E: Not to, not to throw a whole wrench into this perspective, but one idea that I was contemplating recently is, okay, so the model is the model where 181559, you burn ETH as opposed to keeping it. But we're on track to burn about a million ETH, give or take, maybe even more than that. Over the next year. What if that was distributed back? I mean, it's going to be more, but 2,000,002 might. I think two might be too much.
00:54:06.042 - 00:54:06.874, Speaker D: We'll see.
00:54:07.034 - 00:54:27.372, Speaker E: But what if that one to 2 million ETH was distributed back to stakers? That would immediately put the staking rate somewhere in the high teens, I think based on 15% being staked right now. Kind of an interesting concept of increasing the staking rate instead of burning it and having it be deflationary.
00:54:27.548 - 00:55:04.566, Speaker D: Preston, I think we're going to see major discussions on this. I listened to Anthony Cisanos Daily Gwei podcast basically every day, but, uh, he is kind of like a good temperature, you know, thermometer for like, what the ETH core devs are thinking. And he like, you know, he's thrown out a few, like, different tidbits over the past, like couple months. One is like, to your point is like, it's 80 20 right now in terms of what gets burnt versus what gets given to stakers. Should it be 2080? So that was like one interesting one. The second one was a cap on the amount of ETH that's allowed to be staked to maintain a minimum apy. So that's another.
00:55:04.566 - 00:55:41.632, Speaker D: And then the third is the formula for the actual inflation is the square root of. I don't know, it's just some math that I don't have on hand right now, but it's pretty complicated. And his thought process is like, should that be higher or should it be lower or should the equation be different? It's like the square root of some number. And I'm sure it has mathematical significance, but it doesn't mean anything to me. And so I think those are going to be interesting, uh, concepts to go through, especially over time, because, like, what happens if ETH scales 100 x, you know, and the. And fees don't scale 100 x? Like, we're going to need to start making changes. And like, there's a long roadmap for Ethereum.
00:55:41.632 - 00:55:51.484, Speaker D: We're going to be at this for probably next five years. You know, building the protocol, tweaking the economics. I don't think we've seen the last in terms of, like, ETH economics and the potential changes to go in there.
00:55:52.584 - 00:55:53.324, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:53.744 - 00:55:57.624, Speaker B: Coinbase earnings, are we going to make it?
00:55:59.564 - 00:56:01.532, Speaker C: I think I just saw, but I.
00:56:01.548 - 00:56:02.784, Speaker B: Wouldn'T get my hands.
00:56:05.244 - 00:56:06.148, Speaker C: What happened?
00:56:06.236 - 00:56:09.504, Speaker E: Oh, nice revenue beat.
00:56:10.724 - 00:56:13.824, Speaker D: Not surprising given the volatility in the quarter.
00:56:15.284 - 00:56:15.788, Speaker E: Jesus.
00:56:15.836 - 00:56:28.432, Speaker D: Carvana shares jump. I mean, the block did well. Coinbase did well, doordash didn't do well. Sorry. Block the block. Shopify way up.
00:56:28.608 - 00:56:33.064, Speaker B: Watch yourself. What did, uh.
00:56:33.224 - 00:56:42.804, Speaker C: Wait, what? What? Outside of the. So it was a beat on revenue. How'd they do on, um, trying to find it on their site? Yeah, I'm trying to find it, too.
00:56:44.464 - 00:56:50.720, Speaker B: Beat on revenue. Little short on trading volume, you know?
00:56:50.752 - 00:56:52.004, Speaker C: Could you share your screen?
00:56:52.664 - 00:57:00.944, Speaker B: I just typed in Coinbase revenue on Twitter, and I'm scrolling through all the watcher group. We're at the point of the market where it's only, like, the watcher guru.
00:57:00.984 - 00:57:03.352, Speaker C: All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.
00:57:03.488 - 00:57:06.248, Speaker E: All right, now Mike gets to share the screen here.
00:57:06.376 - 00:57:39.244, Speaker C: One sec. I haven't looked at this yet, but I'm gonna share. All right, so, I mean, at first glance, this looks a lot better on the. So, net revenue came in at 736 million, only a loss of 79, which is huge. And humanly talk, that's amazing. I mean, there's a huge headcount reduction, and it didn't show up immediately because there's severance and stuff that you have to pay, but I'm sure some of that.
00:57:39.324 - 00:57:48.538, Speaker E: Well, wait, so sorry. Go back, go back. Um, the biggest number there is the adjusted EBITdA. Yeah, 284.
00:57:48.666 - 00:57:51.850, Speaker B: Damn, that looks. Yeah, they got a lot.
00:57:51.922 - 00:57:53.774, Speaker E: A lot of this is non cash cost.
00:57:54.154 - 00:58:13.844, Speaker D: Yeah, man, my hope is that when all these tech companies, you know, when interest rates get low again and they really reaccelerate, like, I just hope they don't hire all these people back. Like, just, like, learn your lesson. Like, no, no, more like yoga and smoothies. Just, like, run a profitable business.
00:58:14.904 - 00:58:15.576, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:15.720 - 00:58:16.424, Speaker D: Wow.
00:58:16.584 - 00:58:19.096, Speaker E: Bad take on my part with institutional.
00:58:19.280 - 00:58:28.480, Speaker C: Yeah, atrocious. So, I mean, but to your credit, I mean, it's not like it didn't. You know, it's been over 22, so.
00:58:28.552 - 00:58:35.368, Speaker D: It'S, like, basically their biggest real source of revenue outside of transactions. Look at that.
00:58:35.416 - 00:58:36.844, Speaker B: Interest income, baby.
00:58:37.864 - 00:58:40.804, Speaker C: Quarter of a bill, I think. J pal.
00:58:41.384 - 00:58:42.884, Speaker E: Yeah, I was going to say.
00:58:43.184 - 00:58:44.128, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean.
00:58:44.176 - 00:58:48.168, Speaker E: So blockchain rewards makes sense because ETH is up in price.
00:58:48.216 - 00:58:48.736, Speaker C: Yes.
00:58:48.880 - 00:58:53.164, Speaker E: I would imagine that this jumps a lot more in Q two.
00:58:55.784 - 00:59:28.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I would guess so, too. You know, one thing that I've been surprised about, not to distract this too much is Cbeth was one of the big liquid staking providers that enabled withdrawals post Chappella, and they've lost market share since then. It's been. I think they're down something like 2%, and rocket pool has been crushing it. They had their aura upgrade, I guess, and that's actually made a pretty big difference. But, yeah, I think Lido and Rocketpool and Frax were basically the big winners. And I don't really know why.
00:59:29.014 - 00:59:48.216, Speaker D: I mean, basically just Lido, but the other two or three are cool also. But, you know, like, the amount of, like, I was having like 20, 30, 40,000 ETH days, like, it's cool that Rocketpool added 3000, you know, two days ago, but, like, time to bake market shares up.
00:59:48.360 - 01:00:05.264, Speaker C: I mean, the market shares up. I know it's always easy. You bet on the incumbent or whatever, but, like, it is very hard to hold like 70% plus market share for a long period of time. I think it's a tough thing. I'm not advocating for rocket pool out here. I mean, I like rocket pool. I actually think the aura upgrade is super interesting.
01:00:05.264 - 01:00:07.560, Speaker C: But I think, yeah, I think the.
01:00:07.592 - 01:00:16.808, Speaker E: Long tail of lsts is going to be a major narrative. I've said this before on this, on this podcast, but it's going to be LST summer in my mind, because you've got.
01:00:16.856 - 01:00:17.624, Speaker C: I agree with that.
01:00:17.704 - 01:00:40.214, Speaker E: You've got like five to seven very, very small at this point. Lsts that I think are going to grow relative in size, and there's going to be all this infrastructure built around, like, indexes for lsts, and you're going to have like, liquidity pools or lsts. I think it's going to be interesting to see, you know, how material they become. But my guess is that's going to.
01:00:40.214 - 01:00:41.142, Speaker C: Be a big narrative.
01:00:41.278 - 01:00:48.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the liquid staking category, just liquid staking, just past dexs in terms of total value locked in the forefront.
01:00:49.494 - 01:01:41.094, Speaker D: And like now all the lsts are going to be, in short order, the ETH asset that is put into all these dexes. Thats why I kind of think Frax is an interesting model, albeit much smaller. It just internalizes all of the endogenous yield that exists. Because of the LSTs on their stablecoin, im sure theyre going to build their own Dex. You can do that. I think the question is, will the regulators ever say nope, and kind of put a stop to it? But these things have a ton of different avenues to capture value. And so, to Michael's point, I do think there will be some of them that as much as I hate this, there will be a magic Internet money liquid staking token like frog nation rise up against the evil venture capitalists, and who knows if it ends well or not, but that will definitely be a narrative.
01:01:42.414 - 01:01:46.742, Speaker C: So coin the stock is up like three and a half. Yeah.
01:01:46.918 - 01:01:53.790, Speaker E: Not a ton, not a ton. I think a lot of people expected this type of an outcome.
01:01:53.942 - 01:02:02.354, Speaker C: I agree. And I think they want to hear what Brian and crew have to say about regulation. I think it's going to be relatively large.
01:02:03.054 - 01:02:17.454, Speaker E: Once again, I'm doubling down. I think that we're going to get some text in the next two to three months. It's going to be something that's sensible. It's going to be bipartisan in the House, and then it's just going to be a question of whether or not it can get through the Senate.
01:02:18.834 - 01:02:29.898, Speaker C: Yano, you asked earlier about the analysts not asking about base. Do you think that Coinbase wants the analysts to understand base at this point?
01:02:30.026 - 01:02:33.498, Speaker B: What did I ask about the analysts not asking about baseball?
01:02:33.498 - 01:02:38.074, Speaker C: I thought you'd mentioned at the beginning of this, like that was part of that, you know?
01:02:38.854 - 01:02:40.234, Speaker E: Oh, I see what you're saying.
01:02:43.214 - 01:02:50.006, Speaker B: Do I think that Coinbase doesn't actively doesn't want Wall street analysts to understand base?
01:02:50.190 - 01:03:17.384, Speaker C: The reason, the thing I'm asking this isn't a mike, it boiled original thought. I'm sort of borrowing this from someone who planted this idea in my brain. I don't want to blow up his spot. Is, is the one negative potential downside of base is it might end up drawing a lot of scrutiny to what's going on in centralized sequencer. Land on the roll up layer. And I'm not really sure if you want that many eyeballs on that, frankly.
01:03:19.764 - 01:03:22.516, Speaker B: If you don't think the sequence starts.
01:03:22.540 - 01:03:34.578, Speaker D: Looking at you, look too close. That's the thing. I think regulation, like, some of it's going to be good, some of it's going to be like, you can't do that anymore. Right?
01:03:34.706 - 01:03:46.174, Speaker E: It'll be black and white. Some things will be white, some things will be black. But I do think like one of the things that, I think there. So there's going to be two things that come out of this. Number one, what.
01:03:46.594 - 01:03:49.106, Speaker C: Number one, how do you go from.
01:03:49.130 - 01:04:01.794, Speaker E: Being a security to a commodity? Is going to be an interesting thing that gets defined. The other one is what is decentralized mean? Is it, you know, five nodes, three nodes, 21 nodes? Who knows?
01:04:04.054 - 01:04:30.334, Speaker B: I'm, I don't think I can share this now. I'll tell you after we stop performing so lame podcast. Things say, but there's a new, there's a new l two coming from like a big company and hell yeah, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of, a lot more like base like, things launch where companies are like, oh, damn smart idea. Let me go launch an l two with one with a fully centralized sequencer. All right, sounds good. Down.
01:04:31.434 - 01:04:35.098, Speaker D: I mean, if you have money, transmitter licenses, have at it. I think Coinbase.
01:04:35.146 - 01:04:35.814, Speaker C: I agree.
01:04:36.554 - 01:04:38.842, Speaker D: There's many such cases with money.
01:04:38.938 - 01:04:39.794, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:04:39.874 - 01:05:06.554, Speaker C: So, you know, it is funny sometimes worried off in our own little crypto land doing mechanism design and stuff like that. And I've been getting pretty deep into the weeds and mev this season. I saw this take from this guy on Twitter, ceteris Parboose. I can't find the tweet. I was just looking for it, but it was like the unpopular opinion. But Mev is going to be solved in an off chain way. It's called going to jail.
01:05:06.554 - 01:05:17.904, Speaker C: I kind of agree with him. It's like, yeah, dude, like, what's all this mechanism designed for preventing sandwiches? Like, you go to jail? That's called frontrunning. We got a law about that.
01:05:18.324 - 01:05:26.780, Speaker D: So we've seen a few big Mav players stop doing it over the past couple weeks. Not going to name any.
01:05:26.972 - 01:05:27.784, Speaker C: Wow.
01:05:29.004 - 01:05:45.254, Speaker D: They were the largest blockbuilders and just well known tradfi names and they just stopped. And they've stopped doing some forms of Mev, but have continued doing others. And so from the outside looking in, it feels like a lawyer got to them and was like, some of this is not okay to be doing.
01:05:46.114 - 01:05:54.186, Speaker E: Not so maiden, the, the other piece of news that happened this week was Nate from OpenSea. Officially charged.
01:05:54.370 - 01:05:54.882, Speaker D: Man.
01:05:54.978 - 01:05:55.746, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw that.
01:05:55.810 - 01:05:57.934, Speaker B: What do you guys, what do you guys think of this?
01:06:00.354 - 01:06:19.354, Speaker D: I mean, he did something wrong. I think that's clear. And, like, you know, you shouldn't do that stuff in general. I think just reading through the Financial Times article, the sentence is maximum of 40 years. Does the punishment fit the crime?
01:06:19.934 - 01:06:21.870, Speaker E: He made $1,000.
01:06:22.022 - 01:06:46.834, Speaker D: He hasn't been sentenced, but I've met him once. I think Michael might have as well. He seemed like a pretty nerdy but nice guy. And, yeah, I mean, it's obviously illegal to do that, but it was such a small amount that going to jail for 40 years feels like just like a lot for that type of violation.
01:06:47.614 - 01:06:59.074, Speaker E: I mean, he got convicted of fraud, which is a felony. Like, even the specific, no matter what the sentence is, like that. That is. That's tough.
01:06:59.494 - 01:07:03.224, Speaker D: I think he also went to court at, like, probably the worst time, sentiment wise, for crypto.
01:07:03.264 - 01:07:03.584, Speaker E: Exactly.
01:07:03.624 - 01:07:07.216, Speaker D: You're not going to get the benefit of the doubt with, with generally anybody.
01:07:07.320 - 01:07:16.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I think he'd, I think he goes to jail for less than a year, gets probation in a fine, but he still has a felony on his record, which sucks.
01:07:17.064 - 01:07:17.736, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:07:17.880 - 01:07:44.580, Speaker B: And like, dude, what is worth, I think. I do think what he did, like, you're the, the definition of insider trading is pretty clear. Like, you're the head of a pro, of a product for a marketplace. There's a level of responsibility that comes with that title. And in that role, you know exactly what's going on and you know what you're doing there. So therefore, I think what he did was wrong. I think the punishment is wildly unfair and I think both can be correct.
01:07:44.580 - 01:07:57.784, Speaker B: And I also think that the regulators here are looking in like, they're so the wrong direction here. They're like going after this 50k thing or 60, however much it was. And like, meanwhile, there's a bunch of other stuff they should do.
01:07:58.174 - 01:07:58.718, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
01:07:58.766 - 01:08:16.230, Speaker C: You know what? I think he's just, we should. I, you know, no commenting on like, what he actually did, which, whatever. But I think it's just important to have some empathy. Like, everyone knows his name now and that he did this. And I think that's because, to be honest. Okay. Like, the jail will would definitely suck the felony.
01:08:16.230 - 01:08:25.127, Speaker C: If he works in crypto. I'm not really sure that impacts his job prospects, to be completely honest with you. But I, you know, when I do.
01:08:25.295 - 01:08:26.403, Speaker E: Come on, Mike.
01:08:27.343 - 01:08:28.683, Speaker C: Are you gonna hire him?
01:08:29.423 - 01:08:30.203, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:08:31.503 - 01:08:31.839, Speaker C: Wow.
01:08:31.871 - 01:08:32.551, Speaker B: Fair point.
01:08:32.687 - 01:08:48.695, Speaker C: He should. I don't know. I've met the guy, but I've just, I don't know. I think it does suck to have your name just like splashed all over like that and to be the poster boy because that's what he's like, the poster league. And that just sucks. Yeah, that really sucks. He's gonna have a lot of time.
01:08:48.719 - 01:08:52.984, Speaker D: To think about, you know, just that one fucking click of the mouse.
01:08:54.444 - 01:08:57.740, Speaker E: I think it was more, I think it was more than one, but yeah.
01:08:57.852 - 01:09:03.148, Speaker D: There was a few. He was a repeat offender, but yeah, don't do that.
01:09:03.236 - 01:09:31.060, Speaker B: This isn't just nft land, by the way. Like, there was a, there's this person, this woman named Ann Herbert. I think it was. She was a Nike employee for 25 years and she was, I think she was flipping Nikes on the secondary based on like, because she had access to the memos that the CEO was going to send out. I'm probably getting this story really wrong, but she got fired and I think she might pay some time. Like, that's illegal. And she was selling them on Stockx or something like that.
01:09:31.212 - 01:09:35.144, Speaker E: If it feels like it's an unfair advantage. Don't do it.
01:09:36.204 - 01:09:39.716, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:09:39.900 - 01:09:40.624, Speaker D: Always.
01:09:41.004 - 01:09:53.764, Speaker B: Speaking of unfair advantages, blockworks launched gov Hub this week, which is the most powerful governance platform in crypto. So if you want unfair advantage in governance, if you own governance tokens, you should subscribe to blockworks research.
01:09:54.464 - 01:09:55.720, Speaker C: Always be selling.
01:09:55.832 - 01:09:58.564, Speaker D: So are you guys just going to be, like, massive delegates?
01:10:00.384 - 01:10:02.284, Speaker C: Yeah, we're going to be delegates. Yeah.
01:10:02.984 - 01:10:03.728, Speaker D: Wow.
01:10:03.896 - 01:10:07.656, Speaker E: Okay, we got some tokens we might delegate to you.
01:10:07.760 - 01:10:15.480, Speaker B: Every crypto venture firm cannot be a delegate, cannot be active in governance right now. Um, and, uh, we got you.
01:10:15.632 - 01:10:25.704, Speaker C: There's a certain amount of fit. I mean, our analysts, they only check. They only, like, keep up to date with, like, three. Three protocols at a time. Like, they are so in the weeds for this stuff.
01:10:25.744 - 01:10:26.888, Speaker D: Like, they're.
01:10:26.936 - 01:10:28.928, Speaker C: They're the ones that you'd want to delegate to.
01:10:29.096 - 01:10:33.448, Speaker D: So don't govern too hard. You and Nate might be seeing each other at some point.
01:10:33.536 - 01:10:48.918, Speaker C: Oh, boy. All right, just, uh, just to end this on a more uplifting note, like a funny story of the week, I don't know if you saw that Pornhub pulled out of Utah. Do you guys see this? Oh, I saw the headline because of the KYC stuff.
01:10:49.046 - 01:10:52.754, Speaker B: Pornhub. Why do you think Vance just left Utah? The guy was there for, like, six.
01:10:54.574 - 01:10:56.234, Speaker E: Show us your tabs.
01:10:56.934 - 01:10:58.382, Speaker C: Show us the tabs.
01:10:58.438 - 01:10:59.358, Speaker B: All right, everyone, hope you have a.
01:10:59.366 - 01:11:02.974, Speaker A: Good, good rest of your week. Good Friday, and see you guys next week.
