00:00:00.400 - 00:00:07.993, Speaker A: It's a good reminder of this industry is actually like really big. Yeah, like of course it's like, you know, it's big. It's like a 2 trillion.
00:00:08.089 - 00:00:08.417, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:08.481 - 00:00:14.545, Speaker A: But when you, when you see it like this in a conference, it lends a different dimension that it's just pretty awesome to see. Actually.
00:00:14.625 - 00:00:22.265, Speaker B: I got to spend a good amount of time with the OKX team yesterday. Like, they are not a crypto exchange. They are the next WeChat built on crypto rails.
00:00:22.345 - 00:00:32.085, Speaker A: Exceptional storytelling goes far longer and is a bigger has been a bigger factor to success in the space than underlying tech and whatnot.

There's a 5050 chance this podcast is going to be the worst that we have ever recorded on Empire. Or the best. Or the best. So we are currently sitting in a hotel room. Yeah.
00:02:11.295 - 00:02:13.395, Speaker B: Sitting in a hotel room in Singapore.
00:02:13.935 - 00:02:14.887, Speaker A: So we're in the lobby.
00:02:14.951 - 00:02:16.355, Speaker B: We're putting in that work.
00:02:16.815 - 00:02:24.071, Speaker A: We're in the lobby and Yada looks at me, deep, deep stare and says, hey, you want to come up to my room? And I. Yeah.
00:02:24.143 - 00:02:26.791, Speaker B: And the two other guys we were with were very confused.
00:02:26.943 - 00:02:32.367, Speaker A: So I was like, this is what happens when you do podcasts for multiple years. You know, you develop a strong bond.
00:02:32.431 - 00:02:36.215, Speaker B: Strong bond. Strong bonds. But our clothes are on, shirts are on. So we're good. Right?
00:02:36.295 - 00:02:38.047, Speaker A: They may not stay on for the duration.
00:02:38.191 - 00:02:52.223, Speaker B: Exactly. But we want to record this to tell you guys about Token and tell you about Singapore. And Santi might talk about rate cuts. I should not talk about macro, because that's a horrendous thing. You don't want to hear that. But how's the conference been?
00:02:52.319 - 00:02:55.639, Speaker A: Oh, not much, man. Well, they have great kombucha here in Giannis.
00:02:55.687 - 00:02:56.959, Speaker B: Great kombucha. Cheers.
00:02:57.047 - 00:02:59.487, Speaker A: Pink apple. And, you know, if Remedy wants to sponsor us.
00:02:59.551 - 00:03:01.175, Speaker B: Cherry Blum. Cherry plum.
00:03:01.255 - 00:03:21.491, Speaker A: Cherry plum. It's good to be back in Singapore. I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of conferences, but it's really nice sometimes to come in, meet founders, get a vibe for the room, what people are excited about. Just some data points. 20,000 attendees last year. Guess how much, how many? 10,000? Yeah. 2x.
00:03:21.491 - 00:03:28.219, Speaker A: And it feels packed. Not only that, but this feels more like a SaaS conference. Like a Dreamforce conference.
00:03:28.267 - 00:03:28.963, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:29.099 - 00:03:53.415, Speaker A: Like, you overhear conversations, people are like, closing deals. And I. It's. It's one of those things where, like, every other crypto conference that I go to, like, Break Point, which is happening tomorrow, I'll be there debating Solana versus Ethan. You go to defcon, you go to ecc, and it's like, very crypto native. You kind of recognize most people. I don't recognize anyone in the.
00:03:53.415 - 00:03:55.599, Speaker A: And they don't even know. They don't even recognize you?
00:03:55.647 - 00:03:57.315, Speaker B: They don't even know who I am.
00:03:57.815 - 00:04:10.519, Speaker A: I'm having an identity crisis. No, it's actually. It's a good reminder of. This industry is actually, like, really big. Of course it's like, you know, it's big. It's like a 2 trillion. But when you.
00:04:10.519 - 00:04:15.943, Speaker A: When you see it like this in a conference, it lends a different dimension that. It's just pretty awesome to see, actually.
00:04:15.999 - 00:04:32.167, Speaker B: Yeah. So in. In my. In a. Before Blockworks, I worked at this data analytics company, and we would always go to the Gartner conferences. There are these big B2B events, and this feels much more like a Gartner conference where, you know, there were 10,000 people and it was all very B2B getting deals done. Not saying this is all B2B, but.
00:04:32.167 - 00:04:40.297, Speaker B: Yeah, just the size and scale. This is easily the. I mean, this is the biggest conference of the year. I think this is the largest crypto conference ever.
00:04:40.361 - 00:04:40.849, Speaker A: Ever. Ever.
00:04:40.897 - 00:04:41.177, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:41.241 - 00:04:45.885, Speaker A: Period. Like, more so than, like, consensus.
00:04:46.265 - 00:04:53.233, Speaker B: Yeah, the p. The biggest consensus ever, I think, was probably 2018. You remember that one in New York? New York, Blockchain Week, 2018.
00:04:53.296 - 00:04:54.169, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:54.232 - 00:04:56.753, Speaker B: There were probably 10 or probably 15,000 people there.
00:04:56.769 - 00:05:02.729, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Great. Too. Like in Marina Bay Sands. Like, it's. It's very concentrated. Like, multiple floors.
00:05:02.777 - 00:05:25.583, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so one takeaway that I. Okay, so I. This is my first time in Singapore, and I've actually. I've been to Asia before, but Thailand and Vietnam, I've never actually been to. Never actually done, like, a work trip in while working in crypto to Asia. And there was this idea in my head that Token was just a bunch of Americans who fly over because a lot of the speakers are just us.
00:05:25.679 - 00:05:26.295, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:05:26.375 - 00:05:41.937, Speaker B: Crypto companies. I'm trying to figure out the right words so I don't get canceled. But, like, you're still gonna get canceled. The attendees are. I need to like, all. I mean, it's not American attendees. Like, it's all Asian attendees.
00:05:42.041 - 00:05:42.817, Speaker A: Rest of the world.
00:05:42.881 - 00:06:06.491, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the rest of the world. And it's very relevant to the last two podcasts that we've recorded. The roundup that we did, and then the. The episode that I did with Alan where there's this idea that it's like, oh, big in Asia. Right. And then the other side says, no, no, Asia is just a bunch of, like, bots and incentive farming. And being at this conference, I can assure you it is not just bot farming in Asia like this.
00:06:06.491 - 00:06:14.203, Speaker B: There are. The sheer number of people here using crypto is just hands down bigger than the United States.
00:06:14.259 - 00:06:36.323, Speaker A: Well, I talked about in the roundup we did. I was in Korea at the time, at Korea Blockchain Week. And this idea that, like, I feel that the way that consumer finance has evolved in Asia and the whole, like, Internet giants and the. Like, the apps that have been built, you know, when people use. You look at WeChat, you look at Kakao, you look at Grab, like, so Grab has a.
00:06:36.379 - 00:07:00.439, Speaker B: Grab has a wallet. So Grab, for people who haven't been here is like the Uber. It's like Uber and uber eats and DoorDash combined basically in one app. They automatically give you a crypto wallet built on Polygon. And then today I got a push notification from Grab saying, go get your pyusd inside the app. Like, that's. Imagine Uber gave everyone a crypto wallet, and Uber was giving you push notifications about stablecoins.
00:07:00.487 - 00:07:09.855, Speaker A: Yeah. Asia, in some respects, is a good window into the future of how I think the west will, like.
00:07:09.895 - 00:07:11.927, Speaker B: I mean, look outside, it also looks like a sci fi movie.
00:07:11.951 - 00:07:33.833, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, Singapore feels like a very s. Like, it's a. Like, Japan, too. And, but yeah, it's a good reminder that, like, there is, like, underlying utility. And I think it. It sometimes requires you to come to places like Singapore or, you know, elsewhere to discover how other people are using these applications.
00:07:33.833 - 00:07:38.649, Speaker A: And. And it's actually quite interesting. Yeah, would have been. Go ahead.
00:07:38.697 - 00:08:09.449, Speaker B: No, I was just gonna. I'm pulling up the. The other crazy thing for me is just I don't know any of these companies, so I'm pulling up the website right now just to rattle some of these off. Like the sponsors, Sonium, Zebu, Oros, I guess they're a market maker. 4e credit coin. Like, these are the top sponsors of the event. Credit Coin, Cross Finance, dop, Fast X Incentive, Kava Kucoin, Somnia, MTT Sports Peak, Sahara, AI Tomy Valor.
00:08:09.449 - 00:08:13.893, Speaker B: Like, how many of those companies do you know? You know, it's not. It's not many.
00:08:13.989 - 00:08:20.133, Speaker A: No, there. There's a. There's. You walk around the booth and there's a lot of these products that. Never heard of them before. Never.
00:08:20.229 - 00:08:20.717, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:20.821 - 00:08:42.935, Speaker A: Ever interacted with. But so what have been. I was in two takeaways. Yeah, I've been on two panels. The first one was I moderated a panel on crypto AI, decentralized AI. And then today was I was speaking with like, liquid versus venture, like, allocation of money with, you know, a bunch of other investors. Multicoin, Dragonfly, Defiance.
00:08:42.975 - 00:08:46.623, Speaker B: Did I see you with the exchanges too? Bybit was that or is that.
00:08:46.679 - 00:08:51.231, Speaker A: No, I didn't do that. And then you were. You actually went right after me. A really cool one.
00:08:51.263 - 00:09:14.555, Speaker B: But yeah, I moderated one with Lando Norris, which was funny because he knows nothing about crypto and I know nothing about F1. So that was. It was with Lando Norris and then the CMO of okx Hider, and then another one just now about like, is this cycle cooked? Like, what's the meta of this cycle with Antonio from dydx Mert, Alex, the founder of Hack vc, and then Jason Choi.
00:09:14.935 - 00:09:19.927, Speaker A: So, I mean, I think everyone wants to know how. What was the conversation with Lando? Like, what you guys talked about?
00:09:19.951 - 00:09:40.529, Speaker B: I mean, land. So Lando was crazy because first off, we were in the speaker lounge. He walks up with like 30 people, like bodyguards and all these people. And I'm talking to him beforehand right before we go out on stage, and this big boom mic comes over my shoulder and. And then these two cameras come right in our face. And I was like, what is this, like, normal for you? And he's like, oh, yeah, that's Not. He's like, that's Netflix, mate.
00:09:40.529 - 00:09:50.845, Speaker B: Oh, I was like. I was like, oh, that's Netflix. He's like, yeah, say something funny. You'll be on Netflix. I was like, I obviously couldn't say something funny, so. But no, that was good. That was good.
00:09:50.845 - 00:10:11.761, Speaker B: All right. So one of my. One of my takeaways from the conference is just how much the Asian exchanges are printing. Like the. Like, we think in the US that, you know, who is it? Coinbase obviously dominates, then it's Kraken. Right. The Asian exchanges are so much larger than in the U.S.
00:10:11.761 - 00:10:24.821, Speaker B: it's just remarkable. Right, so Binance, obviously, everyone knows how big Binance is by bit. By bit is going to make 3 billion in profit this year. Profit.
00:10:24.917 - 00:10:25.300, Speaker A: Profit.
00:10:25.396 - 00:10:47.143, Speaker B: That's 3 billion in profit. Bitget, like, I think Bitget is fifth biggest right now in Perss. So I think it's. I forget, I forget the order of these exchanges now, but I think bitget is 5th biggest in pers. They'll do a little over a billion in profit. And that's Bitget. Like, I don't know one person who trades on Bitget in the us There's a billion in profit.
00:10:47.239 - 00:10:47.655, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:47.735 - 00:10:51.527, Speaker B: So these exchanges are just printing money out here.
00:10:51.631 - 00:11:17.581, Speaker A: I was talking to an individual from Binance right before going on stage and he. He handles a lot of BD work and he said that internally they feel that. So. So there's, I think their biggest market is, or first or second is China. And he said, we actually think that India will be our largest market in the next five, 10 years. I was like, is that because of demographics? And he's like, just everything. So.
00:11:17.581 - 00:11:42.965, Speaker A: So when you imagine what that looks like. Yeah, you know, if India comes on, like he said, obviously he's like, what other regions? He's like, he's like, we think of Asia as a whole, but it's like they're very different markets. Like Vietnam, the Philippines are like, a lot of the demand comes from there. Vietnam's a lot of like, devs too. But he said, like Indonesia and India, like, it's just. These are massive markets that are just going to. That are going to totally leapfrog.
00:11:42.965 - 00:12:06.781, Speaker A: Not just they don't have any financial infrastructure, but also from the demand side, it just. It's not just play to earn, it's. It's a whole host of things that are going to get built. And so the question is, I guess if you think about what does that look like? Imagine a world where like, what the next 10. What the next Tencent build without crypto Rails or with crypto Rails or with the next cacao in these local markets.
00:12:06.893 - 00:12:34.165, Speaker B: So I think these are the next big companies. Yeah, that's, yeah, these are the. Like, like, okay, what OKX is doing right now, I got to spend a good amount of time with the OKX team yesterday. Like they are not a crypto exchange. They are a, they are the next WeChat built on crypto Rails. Now I don't know if it's going to be okx or it's going to be someone else, but. And I think another big theme that I've learned from being out here is the M and A market is getting very hot very quickly.
00:12:34.165 - 00:13:16.139, Speaker B: The exchanges are all pushing into. So basically the exchange space has been very regionalized. So in Vietnam there's a different exchange than in Thailand, there's all very regionalized. And so now if you're, let's say OKX or Bybit or Bitget, you want to push into these, into these different regions. So let's say you want to expand to Thailand, you want to expand to Vietnam, you have to. The governments are now starting to enforce their licenses more strictly than they ever have, but they're not allowing new licenses because they say you have to acquire, you're acquiring licenses. So there's a crazy amount of M and A activity that's starting to happen in where these exchanges are racing to acquire licenses.
00:13:16.139 - 00:13:26.387, Speaker B: And it's no different than, you know, and Kraken acquired trade station crypto. Right. They did. Right. For the licenses. Like, I think that's a big theme.
00:13:26.411 - 00:13:49.777, Speaker A: That'S happening right now. Sure, yeah. It's a really good point. Like, you know, when you think about the. So in fintech, the value of a customer, the long term value of a customer is extremely high. You know, if, if your parents use JP Morgan, you're likely going to open an account with JP Morgan, they're going to open it for you and then you're likely going to stay with them for life.
00:13:49.881 - 00:13:50.525, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:51.625 - 00:13:58.397, Speaker A: And you could argue that in crypto the barriers to entry and exit are lower. Like people can just switch exchanges on, on chain.
00:13:58.421 - 00:14:01.069, Speaker B: They are, but I think with the exchanges you pick one and you stay.
00:14:01.117 - 00:14:01.581, Speaker A: That's my point.
00:14:01.613 - 00:14:01.925, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:01.965 - 00:14:24.753, Speaker A: Like it's still very much that relationship. People don't want to think about switching providers, opening accounts elsewhere. So there's, there's the point to be made around, like if you're sitting at the exchange, you're like, okay, I already, I'm already the on ramp and probably with stablecoins, a primary bank relationship for younger generations. What else can I build?
00:14:24.809 - 00:14:25.361, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:25.513 - 00:14:33.361, Speaker A: And I think you can sort of imagine that in their whiteboard they have a whole roadmap of owning that relationship with the customer.
00:14:33.553 - 00:15:11.273, Speaker B: Yep. Okay, I have another takeaway. Okay, There is about to be a proliferation of new stable coins that are yield generating stable coins. And this is important because it's going to be really interesting to see how USDC responds. So let me explain this relationship right now. So Circle, and this is all public information, Coinbase and Circle have a partnership for usdc. So Coinbase and Circle have created, basically create USDC together, Circle creates it and Coinbase is basically the distribution engine for them.
00:15:11.273 - 00:15:34.211, Speaker B: They have like roughly a 50, 50 rev share with a little bit more, I think going to Coinbase. Everyone has woke has recently realized two things. One, hey, we all compete with Coinbase, right? If you're a custodian, you compete with Coinbase. If you're trying to build a prime brokerage, you compete with Coinbase. If you're an exchange, you compete with Coinbase. If you're an L1 or an L2, you now compete with Coinbase because of base. So they've realized that.
00:15:34.211 - 00:15:41.121, Speaker B: And then the second thing is they've realized that USDC captures all the yield. Right?
00:15:41.283 - 00:15:43.114, Speaker A: So buying Treasuries and keeping that 5%.
00:15:43.187 - 00:16:16.489, Speaker B: They'Ve, they, yeah, they keep the 5%. So anytime someone's minting USDC, holding USDC on behalf of customers and their clients, you are funding your competitor. So a lot of the, there's a couple things in motion right now. There's all these new stable coins coming to market. PyUSD, PayPal, stablecoin pays, pays users 10% or 5% right. Now compare that with USDC which takes the 5% for themselves. So there's that and then there's all the custodians and prime brokers and exchanges etc, and L1s and L2s who don't want to be funding their competitor in Coinbase.
00:16:16.489 - 00:16:26.433, Speaker B: So they are now thinking about, hey, how can we actually move out of Coinbase and into something else? So. Well, I'm very interested to see how USDC responds.
00:16:26.489 - 00:16:50.131, Speaker A: I had a, I had a conversation with one of the best VC investors out there and he said everyone, he oftentimes comes to me to talk about crypto. And so we were having conversation, he says everyone in Palo Alto, everyone in Silicon Valley is talking about Tether and the sheer like profitability of this, like that headline like Tether is making more money than like every other than blackrock.
00:16:50.163 - 00:16:51.715, Speaker B: Right. Didn't Heather make more than black?
00:16:51.835 - 00:16:59.015, Speaker A: That headline has been circled around to pretty much every investor and was like, how the hell do these guys get to where they are?
00:16:59.075 - 00:16:59.431, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:59.503 - 00:17:18.503, Speaker A: And so your point's a good one, which is, you know, there will be a proliferation of stable coins. The question is, so fast forward five years from now, how does. How does a stable coin market look like then? And there? Is Tether still the dominant one? Do we have central bank digital currencies?
00:17:18.679 - 00:17:30.985, Speaker B: Like, I think Tether will remain the dominant one. But I actually think folks, like, I was very. I was originally bearish on things like PyUSD because I'm like, oh, that's PayPal's like Enterprise stablecoin, whatever.
00:17:31.105 - 00:17:33.169, Speaker A: Were you bearish? Because it's like.
00:17:33.337 - 00:17:34.673, Speaker B: Because they're an enterprise.
00:17:34.809 - 00:17:35.225, Speaker A: Like.
00:17:35.305 - 00:17:36.601, Speaker B: Yeah. Because they're a corporate.
00:17:36.673 - 00:17:37.337, Speaker A: Tired of like.
00:17:37.401 - 00:17:58.889, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But then this guy Paul came on Empire and you weren't able to make that episode, but he runs their stablecoin. I was like, oh, this guy kind of gets it, actually. Like, he's talking about like putting it onto margin FI and aave. And I was like, oh, shit, he kind of gets it. And then I'm. And then I basically think either USCC will have to respond and change how they offer the yield and they'll.
00:17:59.057 - 00:18:04.097, Speaker A: On that point, people go, listen to the episode with Jeremy. Fantastic one. We asked him this question.
00:18:04.161 - 00:18:04.537, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:04.601 - 00:18:06.121, Speaker A: And he said, we can't do this. Right.
00:18:06.193 - 00:18:15.281, Speaker B: Regulatory said we can't do this. Yeah. So what gives? I don't know how others are doing it. Like, I don't know how PYUSD is giving it because that.
00:18:15.473 - 00:18:33.861, Speaker A: Well, it's not. I think. I think the nuances. And I'm speaking out of turn, but my hypothesis. People should comment and tell me I'm an idiot. They are giving you a yield, but it's not directly attributable to what they're earning from the, you know, their treasury management business. It's more.
00:18:33.861 - 00:18:38.705, Speaker A: So they're giving you. It's like acquiring a customer. Like a marketing expense.
00:18:39.445 - 00:18:40.309, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:18:40.437 - 00:18:42.349, Speaker A: Where the. Where the expenses come.
00:18:42.397 - 00:18:43.637, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. I think that's right.
00:18:43.661 - 00:18:46.269, Speaker A: It's not that they're classifying it as pass through revenue.
00:18:46.317 - 00:18:46.837, Speaker B: I think that's right.
00:18:46.861 - 00:18:49.801, Speaker A: But like at the grant, like at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. Right.
00:18:49.833 - 00:19:02.809, Speaker B: Yeah. So I. I've spent a lot of time with Rune. You know, you end up at conferences running into. You've got like five people. You just keep running into Rune has been that person for me. So I moderated a panel with Rune actually as well.
00:19:02.809 - 00:20:01.085, Speaker B: And then I was at the Rune Rune announce had this big announcement where they, they updated Maker into Sky and they had a party last night and there was like this big announcement and big, big party announcing the the launch and sky do money went live and Run Run Run was also backing this up by saying look, there's. We have this new Stable coin and it's a yield generating stable coin. And I asked him this question, I said look, DAI is big, but it really hasn't been able to get like that big relative to USDC and Tether. How big do you think your USDS will be, which is their new stablecoin relative to Dai? And he thinks within two years USDs will be a hundred times larger than DAI because there's going to be a demand for yield generating stables as people don't want to sit in Tether or USDC which gives them no money. So I think actually we're going to see some really fun Stable Coin competition for the first time in years.
00:20:01.785 - 00:20:09.347, Speaker A: You could argue that you had. We had Nick from Castle Mountain Protocol. I mean Mountain's been trying to do this for a while. Have they?
00:20:09.411 - 00:20:13.171, Speaker B: Mine's doing a good job. I was with Martin. Yeah, yeah. They're. They have some really good stuff coming.
00:20:13.243 - 00:20:18.307, Speaker A: Like I'd love to look at the actual traction that you get because they've been.
00:20:18.411 - 00:20:23.507, Speaker B: The key is you have to get in with the exchanges and the custodians. It all comes back to the exchanges.
00:20:23.571 - 00:20:46.775, Speaker A: I was with Guy from Athena. I mean him and I go way back and we're talking about this. Yeah, I mean it's, it's really a distribution game. And the question is again, to your point, on exchanges, if you're an exchange and you appreciate that, then you know, you kind of hold the keys to the kingdom. Now the counter argument of that is so like every exchange launches around stablecoin. Fine. You capture your user base and your user bay grows.
00:20:46.775 - 00:20:56.303, Speaker A: But I think like there, there likely is. The stablecoin that actually wins is sort of a Switzerland model which is you have to sit a layer on top that is neutral. Like.
00:20:56.359 - 00:20:57.007, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:20:57.151 - 00:21:07.909, Speaker A: So whether it be a central bank, digital currency or like some new start, like Tether is just like an independent entity that has all these relationships and everyone has to at this point work with them.
00:21:07.997 - 00:21:17.997, Speaker B: The best model is probably all of these exchanges and custodians coming together to launch like one. Yeah. In the same way that Circle and Coinbase came Together.
00:21:18.101 - 00:21:18.509, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:18.597 - 00:21:28.323, Speaker B: So there's one way, like. Yeah, there should be like some consortium. Trade association or. Yeah, consortium of like 20 of these coming together. Sure. Yeah.
00:21:28.379 - 00:21:30.531, Speaker A: Then there's probably an incentive for someone to detract.
00:21:30.723 - 00:21:32.175, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:21:32.515 - 00:21:34.611, Speaker A: But hugely profitable businesses.
00:21:34.643 - 00:21:35.211, Speaker B: I mean, my God.
00:21:35.243 - 00:21:46.739, Speaker A: I mean, it's almost like too obvious, right? It's like, yes, people want to hold dollars and this is a digital dollar and you go to these places X us and like the demand for Euro dollars is really high.
00:21:46.787 - 00:21:47.107, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:47.171 - 00:21:48.387, Speaker A: And it's insatiable.
00:21:48.451 - 00:21:48.955, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:49.075 - 00:22:02.265, Speaker A: Like, it's like unmet demand. And so it's. If you're just meeting people and like, I think if you walk around these, like, I think in Hong Kong, in the FX markets, like they're. They're quoting you on tether that you want to exchange.
00:22:02.305 - 00:22:21.400, Speaker B: Like, really, it's clothing you in tether. Yeah. So, okay, so one takeaway. The exchanges are bigger than I even realized. Number two, the users are real. Like, there are just a lot more users here than in the States. 3 M&A markets are picking up.
00:22:21.400 - 00:22:27.375, Speaker B: 4. I think we're going to start to see the proliferation of stablecoin competition. What else have you thought about?
00:22:29.675 - 00:22:33.515, Speaker A: I think there is a growing cynicism in the industry.
00:22:33.635 - 00:22:34.331, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:34.483 - 00:22:36.139, Speaker A: Again, there's a distinction between being.
00:22:36.187 - 00:22:44.427, Speaker B: I mean, Antonio on this panel said, fuck all the new L1s. I mean, he's coming out and just saying, fuck all the new L1s.
00:22:44.451 - 00:22:46.027, Speaker A: Tony's never been afraid to speak his mind.
00:22:46.091 - 00:23:24.759, Speaker B: No, he has not. But yeah. Hey, everyone, Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on the show, so I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the Universal Intent machine. Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexes on each chain.
00:23:24.759 - 00:23:45.727, Speaker B: Disaster. Right. But here's the good news. Thanks to Intense, you can just tell the app what you want to do and Anoma's solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background. We're excited to see what cool Dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with Anoma, you can follow them at x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net
00:23:45.727 - 00:24:39.387, Speaker B: Special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode. Let's face it, building on crowded L1s or expensive L2s is just not going to unlock the next generation of applications in crypto. That's where Super Containers come in, offering a completely new solution that transforms your development control. Imagine dedicated customizable app spaces running on Supra's 500ktps layer one blockchain. You get complete control over gas tokens and fees with the freedom to use your own token, create local fee markets or even go gasless, scale on demand and build with better customization than app chains, all at a fraction of the cost. Plus, with multivm compatibility, you can easily deploy your EVM move and SVM smart contracts. It's time to rescue your projects from the costs, complexities and fragmentation of traditional solutions.
00:24:39.387 - 00:25:16.441, Speaker B: Get notified when Super Containers are ready for builders@super.com containers this episode is brought to you by Polygon. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains. With the AG layer, that was a big mouthful. So I'm going to tell you what it means in my. In my words. There's all these things popping up, L2s and L3s and it's chaos, right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity.
00:25:16.441 - 00:25:36.119, Speaker B: You can basically just build in the AG layer to tap into the liquidity of the AG layer and the users of the AG layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the AG layer. It's hot. It's by Polygon Labs, they've got the Polygon Community Grants program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for Polygon builders. Season one, it's live right now.
00:25:36.119 - 00:25:52.645, Speaker B: It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon builders. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology Grants. That's Polygon Technology Grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know Blockwork sent you.
00:25:55.395 - 00:26:06.947, Speaker A: Yeah, so two things. One, I think a lot of founders I've noticed in my. Maybe it's just in my portfolio, a growing way, a new wave of startups.
00:26:07.051 - 00:26:14.147, Speaker B: Closing shop, closing shop because they ran out of money or founder fights or they're just tired.
00:26:14.211 - 00:26:20.011, Speaker A: No, they're tired. It's not running out of money. Actually. They're distributing back 20, 30 cents on the dollar. Like, we haven't found product market fit.
00:26:20.083 - 00:26:20.695, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:21.395 - 00:26:47.707, Speaker A: And the question that I only asked him is, what was your learning? Like, why? And there was a combination of founder disagreements, but the other one is really, like, not having very clear what the problem that they were solving was. And I've reflected a lot on that, actually. And I tweeted about this yesterday. And then I appreciate that the word. The wording was not. Was not often.
00:26:47.771 - 00:26:50.027, Speaker B: What happened? Did you get shredded, like, very quickly?
00:26:50.051 - 00:26:58.015, Speaker A: It's like, when my phone was blowing up, I was at the gym. I'm like, like. And I tweet a lot when I'm like, okay. And then someone's like, yo, did you actually mean to imply this? I'm like, definitely not.
00:26:58.055 - 00:26:58.647, Speaker B: What did you say?
00:26:58.671 - 00:27:03.199, Speaker A: What did you start off with? Like, I think most teams are mediocre in crypto.
00:27:03.247 - 00:27:05.487, Speaker B: Ah, nice. Yeah, that'll rile up the crowd.
00:27:05.631 - 00:27:18.753, Speaker A: Well, and then I was like, I risk, but I still respect them for trying. Because being an investor, I appreciate is a. It's. It's my money, so I'm risking my money that I've earned over the years. I've. Like, it's. So I'm putting stuff.
00:27:18.753 - 00:27:45.745, Speaker A: But being a builder in crypto, you're risking not just that, like, it's your livelihood. It's stressful to build. And so. So I sympathize with builders. The thought that I've had is, like, for the many years that I've been in the space, I felt that every year, every cycle, we saw the quality of builders go up. And that, to me, is like, the primary reason why I'm here, because I think crypto continues, continue to attract really high caliber people. Of course.
00:27:45.745 - 00:28:09.065, Speaker A: Of course there's always a normal distribution. There's. There's just. It normally, like, not everyone is super high talent, but I felt that we've either plateaued or gone down in that scale. And I don't know if this is a implication or like, a ramification of, like, ftx, Luna and just really talented builders or the regulatory environment.
00:28:10.005 - 00:28:30.069, Speaker B: I don't think it's that. My take on that is these are probably founders who you invested in in 2021, who. I don't know. I don't know if that's true or not, but, like, I have met a lot of people here who they are, they are. They're not in it for the long haul. And I'm like, when. When did you come into the industry? It's like 2021.
00:28:30.069 - 00:28:44.479, Speaker B: Like, oh, yeah. You came in at the pico top, and a lot of those people end up. It's like the founders who came in in 2017. Like, you know, Mike and I did that. We launched Blockworks in 2017. But a lot of the people that I remember going to these events with, like, they're. They're long gone.
00:28:44.479 - 00:28:44.839, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:44.887 - 00:28:45.303, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:28:45.359 - 00:28:45.743, Speaker B: So.
00:28:45.839 - 00:29:01.675, Speaker A: So it's. It's. I've been doing a lot of meditating on this thought is like, is. Is the quality of builders going up in the space? And. And so. And then the second one is like, more so because I've been maniacally listening to founders.
00:29:02.015 - 00:29:04.075, Speaker B: Yeah. It's like the founders podcast.
00:29:04.535 - 00:29:21.993, Speaker A: And the question that I now really like to ask founders is like, at what point did you know that you were a builder? Because when you listen to a lot of these episodes of some of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time or athletes, a lot of it was just like, there's a. There's a common denominator of just persistence and hard work.
00:29:22.049 - 00:29:22.393, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:22.449 - 00:29:32.377, Speaker A: And. And so the tweet was something like, you know, it's. It requires a lot of hard work. And I. I guess it's like, very discouraging. When you're really smart, you're. You're like.
00:29:32.377 - 00:29:52.979, Speaker A: But you haven't. The users are not there. We haven't had a lot of this wave of onboarding of users. And so in usage is not there there. And so there's exceptions like helium and stuff like that. But I guess it could be very demoralizing if you're building something and no one cares, no one's using it. I was at a dinner last night with one of the best cryptographers in the world.
00:29:52.979 - 00:30:04.243, Speaker A: There's like five, and he's built a chain. You can try to imagine which one. And they're getting zero attention. Token is not performing well, but he's still really.
00:30:04.299 - 00:30:05.187, Speaker B: Is it a new one or. It's been.
00:30:05.211 - 00:30:10.595, Speaker A: No, no, it's been around for a while. Starkware, I won't comment on, because I don't know.
00:30:10.635 - 00:30:11.387, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:30:11.451 - 00:30:24.667, Speaker A: But my observation is you also see a wave of really talented builders being demoralized for this reason, which is like, you have memes and all these things, like working and.
00:30:24.691 - 00:30:25.075, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:25.155 - 00:30:57.901, Speaker A: And then no one cares about what I'm building. And I think it's just a matter of time. Like, I think really good quality products will shine over time. The question is, you just have to stay in the game and survive to a point where usage really starts to happen. My thesis is there. I think the bar for being quote unquote successful in the space, meaning token go up price. Your protocol being worth X or Y has been very low for two reasons.
00:30:57.901 - 00:31:15.397, Speaker A: One, it's like this phenomenon of like the Cardano phenomenon. You don't have usage, you don't have revenue. So you can paint this rosy picture. And people, if you're a good storyteller. Yeah, you can get away with it. And I guess there's a skill in being a good storyteller.
00:31:15.541 - 00:31:16.305, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:16.725 - 00:31:24.969, Speaker A: But when I think of like most teams are mediocre, like, I appreciate that is a skill in of itself, but I just find it that the really smarter teams maybe not are as good.
00:31:25.017 - 00:31:27.193, Speaker B: I think those are the folks who are the most frustrated. Right?
00:31:27.249 - 00:31:27.729, Speaker A: Yes. Correct.
00:31:27.777 - 00:32:04.235, Speaker B: So I sat down with another guy I spent a lot of time with was Shane from Polymarket. Yeah, yeah. And you know, he, he said, he's like, I genuinely think we're one of the only people who puts, who operates in this order. We go, what is the problem in the. What is the problem that exists? How do we build a product that we get there, that solves that? How do we acquire the users? And then how do you put marketing at the end of that supply chain to boost the users? Is that everyone right now is. Because everyone's got a token. You actually have to flip that and you have to put narrative at the very beginning.
00:32:04.235 - 00:32:15.481, Speaker B: And if you just focus on product, it's not actually going to work for you. And I think some of this is. We talked about, talked about it on this panel. It's like there is a downside of having tokens.
00:32:15.593 - 00:32:15.985, Speaker A: Oh yeah.
00:32:16.025 - 00:32:22.713, Speaker B: The downside of having tokens is you have to focus on the narrative more than you would if you were just building in like Web two or whatever.
00:32:22.809 - 00:33:08.761, Speaker A: I guess what I'm trying to say, it can be very frustrating at times like that. You exceptional storytelling goes far longer and has been a bigger factor to success in the space than underlying tech and whatnot. And look, sometimes you see this VHS better, max, whatever you want to call it, sometimes the best tech doesn't win. But I'm actually optimistic in the sense that if you extrapolate and you say, okay, when, when real institutions come into the space more. As more institutions come to the space and they look under the hood, they evaluate these protocols, they evaluate these vendors of who they want to work with, that is where the real tech, not just the storytelling success. And we, but we just haven't entered that. We're close.
00:33:08.761 - 00:33:24.633, Speaker A: I think we're entering that stage where you see Helium, for instance, like, you know, there are carriers offloading the network on the Helium network because it works like you wouldn't do it otherwise. It wouldn't jeopardize or compromise their ability to service their user base if they didn't think that Helium was a good product.
00:33:24.689 - 00:33:25.137, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:25.241 - 00:33:47.255, Speaker A: And so naturally I think the space will become more competitive. As this space continues to grow, more people enter and so the caliber of founders will have to go up. And so I'm excited for that. I just think we've been in this weird stage where the quality is in order to be successful has been quite low.
00:33:48.355 - 00:34:00.547, Speaker B: All right. So another thing I've noticed at the conference is the lack of the big L2s. There's no conversation about optimism arbitrum. And what do you, what do you make of that?
00:34:00.691 - 00:34:02.355, Speaker A: Well, it's not an Ethereum centric conference.
00:34:02.435 - 00:34:02.739, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:02.787 - 00:34:03.667, Speaker A: So you appreciate.
00:34:03.811 - 00:34:04.283, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:04.379 - 00:34:17.731, Speaker A: Tron is very prevalent here and always has been. I Remember coming here, 2018, 2019 for the Binance First Finance Conference. Like Tron had the same booth in the same place. Like it's just. Yeah, it's. But it's true though.
00:34:17.763 - 00:34:35.953, Speaker B: Yeah. You know who's done a phenomenal job of marketing to this part of the world is Bear Chain. I have noticed that I've met more people here building on Bear Chain than I have built that I've met building on optimism, arbitrum, stark difference from the U.S. yeah. Yeah.
00:34:36.089 - 00:34:42.593, Speaker A: So they built a really good like their, their MVP program. I funded three or four.
00:34:42.689 - 00:34:55.047, Speaker B: Yeah. Startups and I'm not an investor in Bear Trainer or in any company building on Bear Chain. But you know, as a non biased person like I. It's just been very like, wow. A lot of talk about Bear Chain.
00:34:55.151 - 00:34:55.663, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:55.759 - 00:34:55.967, Speaker B: They.
00:34:55.991 - 00:35:06.551, Speaker A: There was a. People were posting pictures of. They did this event. I think there was a. 10,000 people that signed up. Only 800 got in. Smokey tweeted something to the effect of like, I'm the founder.
00:35:06.551 - 00:35:07.143, Speaker A: I can't even get in.
00:35:07.159 - 00:35:08.935, Speaker B: I can't even get in. Yeah, that's funny.
00:35:09.095 - 00:35:11.555, Speaker A: So I wasn't here for that. But yeah.
00:35:11.855 - 00:35:28.413, Speaker B: Another non crypto takeaway. First time Singapore person here. This country is amazing. It just runs so flawlessly. And actually I've had some. You can always learn a lot about a country by the taxi drivers and the taxi drivers are first off so friendly. But I had a long.
00:35:28.413 - 00:35:31.805, Speaker B: I went and played paddle this morning and the paddle place was like 30 minutes away.
00:35:31.845 - 00:35:32.905, Speaker A: Thanks for the invite.
00:35:33.245 - 00:35:45.189, Speaker B: You're not, you're not no. You're not a team sports kind of guy. Not team sports kind of guy. More of a runner. Biker. You know, this is what you get by working with someone. It was actually good that you didn't come.
00:35:45.189 - 00:35:57.279, Speaker B: I almost passed out the. He was like, just debilitating. But he was right. This guy was really ragging on the U.S. he's like, you guys have homeless people everywhere. He's like, he was laughing that we.
00:35:57.407 - 00:35:58.263, Speaker A: Zero homeless people.
00:35:58.319 - 00:36:08.831, Speaker B: Zero homeless people. So they have a. They hang people for drugs. He's like, yeah, as. He's a. He said, as they should. They should be hanged if they're, if they're using drugs.
00:36:08.831 - 00:36:14.199, Speaker B: Why would they be hanged? They have. They cane people. Like caning.
00:36:14.247 - 00:36:14.959, Speaker A: Adult spanking.
00:36:15.007 - 00:36:16.119, Speaker B: Adult spanking, yes.
00:36:16.167 - 00:36:16.703, Speaker A: It hurt. I've heard.
00:36:16.719 - 00:36:20.687, Speaker B: It hurts like a. I've heard. Yeah. A friend told me. Yeah.
00:36:20.831 - 00:36:22.247, Speaker A: The reason why I'm sitting on the couch.
00:36:22.311 - 00:36:34.127, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. No, but he was just kind of ragging on the U.S. he's saying, like, he's like, we view the U.S. as a dysfunctional system at this point. He said, it's obviously great that you guys are big and stuff like that. And it's very.
00:36:34.127 - 00:37:03.885, Speaker B: Your history is very impressive. But, you know, you're, you're, you're very high crime. You have these two politicians running for president who are both imbeciles, in his words. You've got like this like, proliferation of drugs basically all around. Your public transportation doesn't work. He was really laughing at the fact that we give free money to people, like stimulus checks and all that stuff. He's like, we would never do that here.
00:37:03.885 - 00:37:23.779, Speaker B: And he was just explaining these little things they do that make the country run better. For example, the air quality here is really good, whereas in a lot of other countries it's really bad. And one of the things that they've done is you have to give up your car after 10 years. If you're a taxi driver, 7 years. If you're a regular driver, 10 years.
00:37:23.841 - 00:37:26.805, Speaker A: And the reason cars cost 2x year tariffs.
00:37:27.385 - 00:37:52.541, Speaker B: Tariffs are crazy. But also you have to get a paper that costs $70,000 just to apply to get a car. So you can't walk up to the car dealership and get a car. You have to apply. Then you pay $70,000 to get a piece of paper. Then you can get your car. But then at the end of 10 years, you have to give up your car and they export the car to third world countries, as you said, because the pollution generated by old cars is so much worse.
00:37:52.541 - 00:38:19.879, Speaker B: So they have all these little policies. And then the last thing he said is, he said politicians, the United States are. He's like, it's the, you get, you get the worst people running for office. Like the best people go work at tech companies, hedge funds, build things, founders, engineers, Whoever it is, PhD people, scientists. He said in Singapore, he said the elite of the elite, the best of the best go work in government.
00:38:19.967 - 00:38:22.927, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're very successful before coming into government.
00:38:22.991 - 00:38:36.017, Speaker B: Yeah. And he said we pay really well in the government. So I just found, I've just been blown away by how, how intensely they run the country, but how amazing it has turned out.
00:38:36.161 - 00:38:49.897, Speaker A: So, yeah, I've had the benefit of coming to Singapore over the years many times and the, the criticism of a city state like Singapore, Monaco, some of these is, can you scale that?
00:38:50.001 - 00:38:50.497, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:50.601 - 00:39:03.899, Speaker A: Can you scale the model that has worked in Singapore elsewhere? I don't pretend to be a political expert, but that has always been just the criticism. I guess you can relate it to, you know, scalability, crypto and, but it's, it's. Can you create?
00:39:03.947 - 00:39:29.167, Speaker B: Well, I think you can talk about it in the light of this whole founder mode thing, which I don't know if you've been seeing. Have you seen founder mode? Okay. It's, you know, I had lunch with Alex, the founder of Nansen, and he was telling me there's this great book that I want to read about. I forget the guy's name, but it's called, I think it's called Third World to First World. It's about the. Who's the guy who's, you know, I don't know, the guy who did all the changes in Singapore. Yeah, but he, Lee Kuan Yew, I think.
00:39:29.167 - 00:39:38.247, Speaker B: Yeah. And he ran the country like a founder. He just basically, I mean, like a good dictator basically just went into founder mode and put in place all these changes.
00:39:38.391 - 00:39:52.189, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. That's always been the challenge and I'm not like convinced it's not possible now. Do you want to create. There's reasons why people wouldn't want to live in Singapore and I appreciate what, you know that.
00:39:52.237 - 00:39:54.357, Speaker B: But it's hot. It's really hot.
00:39:54.421 - 00:40:27.967, Speaker A: No, well, it's, you know, I guess people, if you like vaping, you can't vape in Singapore. You, you know, there's the, the, there's always that trade off of some labor, very strict rules, some pure expression to, of doing what you want with order, cleanliness, security and, and you know, that's a trade off that you can make. But yeah, it's actually. It's very nice coming here and being able to walk. Not think about security. Not think about.
00:40:28.031 - 00:40:28.423, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:40:28.479 - 00:40:30.703, Speaker A: Other things that, you know, are a problem in other places.
00:40:30.759 - 00:40:36.920, Speaker B: Yeah. Any other takeaways from the conference? So there are 900 side events.
00:40:37.023 - 00:40:37.436, Speaker A: It's.
00:40:37.539 - 00:40:51.767, Speaker B: Yeah. 20,000 people like Santiago saying there are five floors at this event and 900 side events over the course of the week. Combine that with. There's also Breakpoint happening right now. And there's Formula One. It's.
00:40:51.871 - 00:40:54.967, Speaker A: And there's a Milk in my hotel. There's a Milk in Asia Summit.
00:40:55.031 - 00:40:56.831, Speaker B: Is it really? It's just crazy.
00:40:56.943 - 00:40:58.831, Speaker A: Like a bunch of, like, bankers and hedge fund guys.
00:40:58.863 - 00:41:00.755, Speaker B: What do you think of this whole side event thing?
00:41:02.615 - 00:41:14.751, Speaker A: Well, it's nice, you know, like, there's like, a lot of people that's like, I don't even want to go to the conference. They just go to the side events. They're more intimate. You can get, you know, closer to people and have actual conversations. Conference is crazy.
00:41:14.823 - 00:41:15.515, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:16.015 - 00:41:23.567, Speaker A: But I'm. Yeah, that's good. Are you going any nice ones or have common. Some good side events.
00:41:23.631 - 00:41:26.655, Speaker B: Yeah. Good. Some good side events, but there's just a lot.
00:41:26.735 - 00:41:29.515, Speaker A: So anyways, are you speaking at break one?
00:41:30.095 - 00:41:31.627, Speaker B: No, not speaking.
00:41:31.751 - 00:41:32.131, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:32.203 - 00:41:33.091, Speaker B: Are you excited?
00:41:33.123 - 00:41:33.267, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:33.291 - 00:41:34.855, Speaker B: Santi's got a nice little debate.
00:41:35.235 - 00:41:47.875, Speaker A: Solana versus yes is the name of the panel is. What's more future proof Solana or Ethereum. And I'll be doing that with Vichill from Electric. You can guess who's taking the 4A vitro.
00:41:47.915 - 00:41:51.843, Speaker B: I don't think of him as a big. See Big E. No, I.
00:41:51.859 - 00:41:55.075, Speaker A: Initially. Yeah. I guess you could bring on someone that is a bit like.
00:41:55.235 - 00:42:29.147, Speaker B: Yeah, it would be more like, oh, here's another takeaway from the conference. The big venture funds. There is a. I think a lot of people put like Pantera Polychain, Dragonfly, Electric Paradigm, like all these big kind of tier one framework, like in this one bucket. And you know, it's like the best venture firms in crypto. There's a stark difference in how in the return profile of those funds. All.
00:42:29.147 - 00:42:45.787, Speaker B: I mean, all of them are out raising right now, it sounds like. And some of them have done incredibly well and I think are going to have. It sounds like are having an easy time raising. Not. Not easy, but are having. They'll be able to raise a good amount of money. Other ones really had a tough couple of years and I think they're really.
00:42:45.811 - 00:42:47.655, Speaker A: Struggling numbers, if you can.
00:42:48.515 - 00:42:57.125, Speaker B: I mean, there are folks who raise. Let's say 300, 400, 500 million last time. Who I think are going to raise funds of 100 or 200 like the.
00:42:57.165 - 00:43:02.665, Speaker A: Return profile, because I don't. Vintage has not been crystallized.
00:43:03.085 - 00:43:11.589, Speaker B: It hasn't, it hasn't. And I honestly don't know what the norm like you know, you're talking like DPI and I actually don't know the norms and what's good or what's bad.
00:43:11.637 - 00:43:23.726, Speaker A: But, but if you were to canvas like what is a tier one venture fund? Vintage, pure venture, like what are the return that they delivered in their last fund that was probably raised 20, 20.
00:43:23.843 - 00:43:27.212, Speaker B: I actually, I actually don't know.
00:43:27.329 - 00:43:29.595, Speaker A: 10X30X? Is it 25x?
00:43:29.975 - 00:43:31.199, Speaker B: I actually don't know the answer to.
00:43:31.207 - 00:43:33.395, Speaker A: That because in traditional venture, if you've.
00:43:34.375 - 00:43:36.671, Speaker B: In the 3 to 5 NBCA National.
00:43:36.703 - 00:43:49.581, Speaker A: Venture Capital association puts out these numbers and they survey, you know, these funds and pension funds that are investors because they have all the data. I think if you are 4x, 4 to 5x places you in the top tier venture funds.
00:43:49.658 - 00:43:53.679, Speaker B: 4 to 5x over what, the lifespan of the fund which is what, seven years or something?
00:43:53.727 - 00:43:58.967, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's the vintage, right? It's the 20, the latest fund which is probably raised over the last five years.
00:43:59.031 - 00:44:00.431, Speaker B: Yeah, or seven years.
00:44:00.543 - 00:44:12.863, Speaker A: Because most of these funds have a 10 year life in crypto it's a bit shorter than that. But yeah, that return is from what I can see as an investor in some funds funds. And yes, it's. We're able to do. It's multiples of that.
00:44:12.919 - 00:44:13.623, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:44:13.759 - 00:44:16.007, Speaker A: So I don't think the same thing.
00:44:16.031 - 00:44:46.361, Speaker B: That'S happened going forward, the same thing that's happened with retail where if you, if you didn't buy Solana or Meme Coins this cycle, you have not made money. Same thing with these venture funds. And now they have to go to their lps and the LP say well, why are your returns bad? And yes, you can say, well it's only been two years since we raised the last one. But you know, a lot of the LPs invested in eight different funds and if two outperformed and six have underperformed those six aren't getting your money. Again. You would think, you would think, you would think.
00:44:46.433 - 00:44:58.145, Speaker A: But also it's a. In crypto, much like in venture, a lot of it, you would think that rationally speaking you would invest in the, in the matter that has outperformed historically. But a lot of times it's like.
00:44:58.265 - 00:44:59.497, Speaker B: Well to come down to the relationship.
00:44:59.561 - 00:45:02.475, Speaker A: Telling pedigree of the founder.
00:45:02.555 - 00:45:03.255, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:03.795 - 00:45:05.771, Speaker A: And so yeah.
00:45:05.923 - 00:45:09.371, Speaker B: The other thing I've realized is you really only have to hit one or two.
00:45:09.563 - 00:45:14.275, Speaker A: You have to spend my ammo. It's. You have to get one or two things exceptionally right each cycle.
00:45:14.355 - 00:45:14.755, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:14.835 - 00:45:17.203, Speaker A: And if you're not in that you missed it.
00:45:17.259 - 00:45:31.657, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's like you know, Dragonfly hitting near framework. Hitting what chain link or something first. Whatever they hit, you know, AAVE or something. Yeah.
00:45:31.801 - 00:45:35.657, Speaker A: You have one or two things that it's very much power line. You return a fun on that basis.
00:45:35.721 - 00:45:36.225, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:36.345 - 00:45:42.849, Speaker A: They. So I've been just as a closing thought because we always give homework to people. Sure. I've been on this point around returns.
00:45:42.897 - 00:45:45.921, Speaker B: And you know, you, you read books on your phone.
00:45:46.073 - 00:45:58.327, Speaker A: I have a Kindle actually and my. I. I usually always do it on my phone. It's a bit marginally more distracting but I just. Because I always have it on me. I can read like when in a taxi or like not want to talk to people. I just off the Kindle and pretend like I'm very busy.
00:45:58.327 - 00:45:59.279, Speaker A: I do that a lot.
00:45:59.327 - 00:46:01.127, Speaker B: Sir. I'm actually reading right now.
00:46:01.231 - 00:46:07.887, Speaker A: I was, I was on a date once and we go to dinner and then we go to this like nightclub and whatever. She goes to the bathroom.
00:46:07.911 - 00:46:10.519, Speaker B: You took your date to a nightclub in Monaco? Okay.
00:46:10.687 - 00:46:31.545, Speaker A: And. And so she goes to the bathroom and I was reading this book. I was like, you know, like you want to finish it? But I pumped up the Kindle app while I'm like sitting there and she comes back and she's just like took a while. I'm like, God, dinner must have been heavy. I look up and she's like looking at me and be like, what are you doing? Why are you reading?
00:46:32.645 - 00:46:34.225, Speaker B: Just reading at the nightclub.
00:46:34.645 - 00:46:42.389, Speaker A: He keeps reminding me of this. We're still friends I guess but anyways I do read on my phone but people should buy the cake. It's really good.
00:46:42.477 - 00:46:46.157, Speaker B: There's a lot more questions about your dating life, but we'll stop the recording.
00:46:46.181 - 00:47:10.153, Speaker A: It's non existent. There's this really good book. I've been thinking a lot about success. The difference between like skill, luck in investing A lot of it is it's not like pure skill based activity in certain sports. Like you're a sprinter, you're a swimmer. Individual sports like it is. There's less element of luck.
00:47:10.153 - 00:47:11.649, Speaker A: Like Michael Phelps, he can have a.
00:47:11.697 - 00:47:15.673, Speaker B: It is only you. Yeah, but there's, there's. There are not many variables.
00:47:15.729 - 00:47:20.437, Speaker A: But you like basketball. Basketball is very different than baseball. Basketball because there's many points.
00:47:20.501 - 00:47:20.981, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:21.093 - 00:47:37.305, Speaker A: Like the teams that have the best shooters, like they tend to win. There's many games and there's many points. And so the, there's always an element of luck, but the degree by which luck plays a factor is quite low on that spectrum. Then contrast that with soccer.
00:47:38.285 - 00:47:39.453, Speaker B: There's one or two goals.
00:47:39.509 - 00:47:40.149, Speaker A: One or two goals.
00:47:40.197 - 00:47:41.325, Speaker B: So it couldn't get lucky.
00:47:41.405 - 00:47:42.093, Speaker A: The referee.
00:47:42.149 - 00:47:43.755, Speaker B: Yeah. Offside. Yeah.
00:47:43.925 - 00:48:02.047, Speaker A: Penalties. And it can. And I guess there's an element of why people like soccer because it's very like in development. It's like very aspirational sport. Anyways, so the really good book, shout out to Michael J. Lee, who recommended this book. It's called the Success Equation, Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports and Investing.
00:48:02.047 - 00:48:05.999, Speaker A: Fascinating read, by the way, the best book that I've read on this particular subject.
00:48:06.087 - 00:48:06.455, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:48:06.495 - 00:48:30.613, Speaker A: Okay, really good. It also is kind of fun too because you're reading about these sports and investing, but there's a whole chapter dedicated to investing. And I often think about that a lot. You know, in the context of like, are rates going to go to record low lows as they did for the last decade? No. So you invert and you say, am I going to continue to be successful implementing the same strategy. How much of it was like, how much of it was driven by.
00:48:30.669 - 00:48:36.765, Speaker B: I feel like you've been thinking about that a lot. I mean, we're going into like this, this interest rate we have. We haven't even talked about interest rates.
00:48:36.805 - 00:48:57.929, Speaker A: But I mean, I bring this up because obviously rates have come down, but we're not. I ascribe to the Howard Marks thinking, which is we're not going to go back to zero. And so that matters. And it probably matters more so than people think. And so I always second guess myself. Like I've only started my professional investing career. I graduated and it was post financial crisis.
00:48:57.929 - 00:48:59.873, Speaker A: I've only invested in a record low interest rate environment.
00:48:59.969 - 00:49:00.481, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:00.593 - 00:49:44.131, Speaker A: And so. And also, by the way, you just saw the formation of a new asset class from 0 to 2 trillion. I'll leave listeners with this. I think you ought to constantly be thinking about. It's almost like a 10x is underperforming in crypto. And I think it's useful to constantly recalibrate and remove that anchoring effect and that bias and saying what is a realistic return? And I've said it time and time again. I think of now I'm trying to optimize for at best capturing like 50% of the return of a cycle because going from 50 to trying to optimize for 80, you're going to put yourself way much.
00:49:44.131 - 00:49:45.819, Speaker A: I think you're going to do many more mistakes.
00:49:45.867 - 00:49:50.987, Speaker B: So if you're trying to optimize for 50% of the cycle, does that mean you're selling early or taking less risk?
00:49:51.091 - 00:49:51.923, Speaker A: No, selling early.
00:49:51.979 - 00:49:52.435, Speaker B: Selling early.
00:49:52.475 - 00:50:07.341, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, like capital preservation. And people be like, oh, you know, because your size is different. Marginally true. But I still think that you, you invert, you say we have many, many more cycles ahead.
00:50:07.413 - 00:50:07.829, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:07.917 - 00:50:11.669, Speaker A: And it's always fun. Funny, because when you should be investing, no one has money.
00:50:11.797 - 00:50:13.029, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:13.117 - 00:50:24.487, Speaker A: You want to be there with money and investing. So like right now I'm not doing many privates because I don't. Just don't think it's. We're in that point of the cycle where you should be doing like I don't want to do privates, but who.
00:50:24.511 - 00:50:33.455, Speaker B: Knows, you know, I'm reading this book, Boyd the Fighter Pilot who changed the Art of War. I needed a non business book.
00:50:33.535 - 00:50:34.079, Speaker A: It's good.
00:50:34.167 - 00:50:59.033, Speaker B: It's really good. Yeah. It's about this guy who became the most famous greatest fighter pilot in American history. Really kind of broke through the bureaucracy of like the military and completely changed how we, how we fight in the air. Fifteen F15, F15 and F16s and basically transformed. Yeah. Just like the art of war in the air.
00:50:59.033 - 00:51:00.577, Speaker B: So that's my book.
00:51:00.761 - 00:51:01.321, Speaker A: Nice.
00:51:01.433 - 00:51:02.145, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:02.305 - 00:51:09.105, Speaker A: All right, folks, this is Singapore tuning in. Look at those lovely the gardens. Futuristic. This looks like Star Wars. Kind of like.
00:51:09.145 - 00:51:11.569, Speaker B: It really does. Look at that. Crazy, huh?
00:51:11.697 - 00:51:12.049, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:12.097 - 00:51:38.097, Speaker B: All right, folks. That's all she wrote. All right, see ya. Thanks for watching today's episode.
