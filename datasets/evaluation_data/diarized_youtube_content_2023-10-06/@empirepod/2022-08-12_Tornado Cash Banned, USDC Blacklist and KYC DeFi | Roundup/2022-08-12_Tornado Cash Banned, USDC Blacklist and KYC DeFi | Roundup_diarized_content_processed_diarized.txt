00:00:00.120 - 00:00:36.370, Speaker A: A little thought experiment. You take all of today's defi protocols, uniswap, Aave synthetix, you take all, you take all the blue chip defi protocols or screw it, you take all of them. You fork them, you add a KYC requirement. What happens to the flow of capital? This episode is brought to you by core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show. We're back with another roundup of Empire. Santi, my man, how we doing today? That's a nice, that's a nice blue collar shirt.
00:00:36.370 - 00:00:40.130, Speaker A: Are you traveling today? You're looking like a little preppier than usual.
00:00:40.282 - 00:00:46.962, Speaker B: Looking nice, but thank you. Is this your way of telling me you're excited to see me or you're excited?
00:00:47.098 - 00:00:49.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited to see you.
00:00:49.290 - 00:01:06.714, Speaker B: Hopefully this time airlines don't rug us, but nonetheless, I'm going through Heathrow and Heathrow as, I don't know, complicated airport nonetheless. But yeah, I'm excited. Time for the roundup. Excited to see you out there. And so anyways, yeah, a lot of.
00:01:07.014 - 00:01:14.434, Speaker A: Good little, good little sushi din lined up. I'm excited. Although Mike just rugged us. Mike just bailed on the dinner. So it's you and me have a cute little date.
00:01:14.734 - 00:01:15.754, Speaker B: There we go.
00:01:16.374 - 00:01:27.076, Speaker A: Can you, can you see my nose? I don't know if you can see this. I got so sunburnt, my nose is completely peeling. So that's my, that's my. Tell me your moisturizer, it's like, tell.
00:01:27.100 - 00:01:30.544, Speaker B: Me you've been on vacation without telling me you've been on vacation.
00:01:30.884 - 00:01:52.416, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. So, all right, man, we're recording this on Wednesday morning instead of Thursday afternoon because you are traveling. ETH is pumping. Crypto is pumping because CPI came in below expectations at 8.5%. Just kind of funny that an 8.5% CPI print will actually make things, the market sees that as a good thing.
00:01:52.416 - 00:02:02.856, Speaker A: But ETH is right now at its highest levels since early June. I think I know how you're going to respond to this question, but I will ask what I ask you on every roundup, which is how you feeling today?
00:02:03.000 - 00:02:54.690, Speaker B: I'm feeling very excited. I've seen really good quality teams on the early stage side come back and, and it's always great to see really talented founders. I keep seeing it in every episode, but I always am truly amazed by like these are founders with multiple level exits. Valuation is super compelling. The use case, I think is super interesting. You know, people, there's, I guess, a lot of reasons why founders in web two land would still be on the fence to come into this kind of wild west, uncertain space. But, you know, it's, it's still, I think it's the most exciting thing from my perspective, obviously, you know, you combine that with, there's been a very eventful week with hacks and, you know, the tornado situation.
00:02:54.690 - 00:03:22.460, Speaker B: But I think overall, I'm feeling, I was reflecting on kind of my call, which was that I felt that the bottom would be close to a thousand if in and around that range. We're obviously up to 1800 now. So, like, ETH has rallied 80% or plus since that kind of bottom. I'm not prepared to say that we've, it's a local top, local bot. I don't know, but it's, yeah, you know, it's, it's always good to see that.
00:03:22.572 - 00:03:46.654, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you've been, you've had a hell of a. Last two weeks, right? What, six, seven, eight angel deals in the last two weeks. Does it feel like things are, is this just because you're seeing a higher quality of teams? Does this become the, is this because the valuations have finally come down to levels in the private markets that you've been waiting to see? Why has your, I mean, you had like two or three months where you're pretty quiet on the, on the angel side of things? Why has it ramped up?
00:03:47.074 - 00:04:23.416, Speaker B: I think it's a combination of really quality teams at very attractive valuations, you know, sub 20, sub 15 million valuations for a really good team. I mean, you're almost in the money in human capital. So that, to me, is always really exciting, you know? Yeah. I don't have like a favorite deal. I just, you asked me this before the show is just, I just get incredibly excited when I see a two time founder who's exited to like, google, Facebook or what have you say. Hey, you know what? I've been thinking about web3. I've been thinking about crypto since 2014, 2016.
00:04:23.416 - 00:05:15.970, Speaker B: It captivated my imagination. I want to go, I want to, I want to finally build something now because I've observed the last year, all the NFT stuff with the gaming stuff. It's not perfect, but I think I can fix it. And to me, that's like, it's pretty cool. It really sets us up for the next cycle where a lot of core infrastructure is being built. Like, I was talking to one of your reporters, reached out and she was, she asked a good question, which was like, hey, why web3? Like, you know, what is this, like, our digital experiences? Like, why are we spending so much time online? I'm like, look, the concept of the metaverse is not new, but there are certain things that are really enhanced by this idea of being creators going directly to their audiences content. The quality of contents that will be produced is higher because you don't have to think about rent seekers taking a huge toll.
00:05:15.970 - 00:05:35.582, Speaker B: And so I think all that sets us up really nicely for the next cycle. Why do you get so excited about gaming? And I said, well, because really good games are going to take two, three, four years to develop, and that's going to coincide really nicely with scalability technology really being battle tested and supporting a billion users. So, yeah, cool.
00:05:35.678 - 00:06:03.424, Speaker A: It feels like, in terms of the markets, it feels like we, on one hand, it's like this David versus Goliath moment. We've got David in one corner, which is the ETH merge, and then in the other corner, you've got record inflation, sanctions on crypto, tornado, USDC blacklist, Ukraine, Taiwan, rising interest rates, gas shortages, food shortages, massive credit card debt in the US. But just like David versus Goliath, I think David can pull this one out.
00:06:03.504 - 00:06:30.988, Speaker B: So, yeah, the crypto space has always had. I mean, this is nothing new, necessarily. In crypto, we always have these walls of worry that we constantly need to climb, and every sequential way feels like worse than the prior one. More real, more in your face. But, yeah, it's just kind of. I don't know, maybe for newcomers. I don't mean to be dismissive, maybe some.
00:06:30.988 - 00:06:58.482, Speaker B: Some of these things are actually pretty relevant, and I don't want to, like, I just want to put them in their proper perspective because you almost always, invariably feel it. Like the prom that you have in front of you is worse than anything you've ever felt. And, you know, it's like, is it really? I have my own takes on tornado, and some of this stuff, which I think on the margin is quite positive if you look at it. But we'll save that for.
00:06:58.538 - 00:07:08.934, Speaker A: Let's get into it then. I want to hear those takes. Here's what I want to cover today. First things first. Start with tornado cash. Second, get into USDC and the blacklisted accounts. Third, coinbase earnings.
00:07:08.934 - 00:07:57.890, Speaker A: Fourth, maybe touch on a couple of smaller things like the curve, front end hack, Uniswap, improved a 10% protocol fee for three different pools, and then ETH proof of work chain, this, like, remaining POW chain that's kind of hanging on from the. Before the merge as we lead up into the merge. So we'll see if we get to those last few things, but definitely want to talk about tornado cash. On Monday, the Ethereum privacy protocol, Tornado cash and 45 related ETH addresses were added to the US Treasury's OFAC list. What this means is that all assets that belong to or interact with any of those addresses are going to be frozen. It becomes a federal offense to engage in any transaction with that address. So the statement stated that tornado cash has been used to launder over.
00:07:57.890 - 00:08:47.658, Speaker A: This is the reason why OFac is coming down and adding them to this list is that tornado cash has been used to launder over $7 billion since its creation just two or three years ago. 455 million from Lazarus growth, 96 million from the Harmony Bridge hack, 7 million from the nomad hack. Basically what happens is, like, hackers, in any of these hacks, when you get the capital, you end up sending it through a mixer or something like tornado cash. And that's kind of the argument here. I know that you and me will have some good counterarguments to this, I think. I think you'll have some interesting counterarguments, I would assume, but basically, this executive order followed by USDC blacklisting, opens up this Pandora's box in terms of regulation, in terms of DeFi's future permission. Defi, KYC, AML, Defi.
00:08:47.658 - 00:09:04.828, Speaker A: But before we get into that, I just want to get your take on this whole situation. I think if it's helpful, I can also get into maybe a little bit of background in terms of tumblers and mixers and privacy coins and tornado caches history. But at a high level, I just want to get your take on the situation before going into some of the details.
00:09:05.026 - 00:10:24.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I understand the motivation given all the hacks. And as you point that out, as soon as a hack happens, they typically use tornado to try to mix the coins and then eventually cash out. And so I understand the motivation, although the actual implementation of it is going to be tricky because then, of course, what happens, every pool, every protocol, every wallet that has touched, funds that are basically tainted, does that now mean that they're going to be frozen or frozen until Kyc'd or. And so, of course, crypto always finds a very immediate response to it. And there was someone who, a madman out there who was sending tornado east to a lot of the known, um, ETH addresses of public figures like Ben Horowitz from a six and z, and a lot of the crypto kind of, you know, notable personalities in crypto. And so what does that mean then? Are you going to, you know, blacklist that wallet, too? And like, everything, it's a very tricky situation. Like, I think, you know, sometimes you feel like this policy is like taking a chainsaw to do a micro surgery.
00:10:24.024 - 00:11:13.714, Speaker B: And so I am quite curious to see what the second order effects, third order effects are of this order and what that means for other stuff like Ren, for instance, the rent pools. To my knowledge, a lot of the bitcoin that is being sent using Ren has been okay. And exchanges can receive that. Does that mean now that they won't? What happens, like Opensea now, for instance, is also taken action. There's a whole host of other companies that have taken very quick action as a result of this order. So, most notably GitHub taking down all the repos of the contributors to tornado. That puts into question kind of free speech and open source code and a prior ruling, I think.
00:11:13.714 - 00:11:24.562, Speaker B: And so, yeah, there's going to be a lot to unpack here and we'll save a lot of this discussion for a regulatory debate that we're going to have with Jake and Rebecca later this month.
00:11:24.738 - 00:12:00.574, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are a couple constitutional rights here that are actually interesting to think about. One is, what is it, the fourth? I think it's the fourth which says. Which talks about, like, seizure of assets. So that's an interesting one. The other kind of interesting topic here is like, is code free speech. And so can you restrict freedom of code and can you restrict someone just basically writing code? And is that freedom of speech? And you're right, some of these other, what you're seeing is the second order implications, I think we don't even know.
00:12:00.574 - 00:12:26.184, Speaker A: You mentioned someone's getting of act or tornado cached, 0.1 ETH is getting sent to these big docs wallets like Shaq and Beeple and Randy Zuckerberg and Ben Horowitz and Brian Armstrong. What about if someone deposits ethan that's been transferred from tornado cash into an lp pool on Uniswap where you have tokens? You've never put your capital into tornado cash, but, like, you're in that pool, are you now at risk? Right? What if you.
00:12:26.924 - 00:13:17.118, Speaker B: If you're a miner validator, like, exactly a deposit, and then all of a sudden you validate a block? Does that mean that you're, you know, what does that mean? And so, yeah, exactly. The obvious pushback here is not everyone that has used tornado is a criminal. I didn't end up investing in tornado. I looked at the round because I think privacy is something that is, I think an enable human right. I think it's important to have that in crypto and privacy preserving solutions that are also regulatory compliant are possible. And to my knowledge, tornado has, if you, for instance, send funds that have been interacting tornado back to an exchange, I think there is a way to prove the proof. There's like a proof that tornado generates.
00:13:17.118 - 00:13:28.806, Speaker B: If coinbase says, hey, wait a minute, where are these funds coming from? There is a way to de anonymize that and trace back the origin of funds. To my knowledge, there is.
00:13:28.830 - 00:13:32.754, Speaker A: And chain analysis also has ways to do it. Lipstick has ways to do it. Yeah.
00:13:34.344 - 00:14:17.476, Speaker B: For me, to me, then, that's sort of the solution. Like, I don't see necessarily a problem with the functionality here. Meaning if you're not willing to provide that record, then you kind of assume that that is criminal, fraudulent, or suspicious behavior. But otherwise, I think you need to allow people to produce that proof and show in the same manner that, you know, sometimes when you send a wire, how many times does a bank freeze it? It never goes through. They call you, they ask for more documentation. I think we need to think about what those protocols and procedures look like for funds that have used these privacy preserving solutions. Because, hey, tornado is not.
00:14:17.476 - 00:14:42.856, Speaker B: The tornado is not the first or the last one that will exist. And so, you know, again, um, it, you know, I think there is a future where you have privacy and crypt in crypto. And at the same time, regulators and law enforcement feels comfortable with that because you can prove origin of, you know, funds and whatnot.
00:14:43.040 - 00:15:24.832, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's give a little bit of background just on privacy protocols and tumblers and mixers and privacy coins and things like that, because I think it's important just to understand what they are. If we can understand what they are and what they're actually doing right now and what the landscape looks like, then we can start to think about, okay, well, in the next bull run, will privacy actually be a big trend? And maybe what are the pros and cons of investing in different privacy related protocols? Privacy has really been a topic in crypto since the release of bitcoin. From bitcoin pseudonymous accounts, people trading cash for hard filled hard drives. Zcash launched in 2016. Different privacy chains, protocols, they really come in. There are really two different primary privacy techniques.
00:15:24.832 - 00:15:30.960, Speaker A: Mixers and then privacy coins. Privacy coins are like, zcash, Monero.
00:15:31.032 - 00:15:31.512, Speaker B: Monero.
00:15:31.608 - 00:15:58.762, Speaker A: They include, yeah, like zero knowledge proofs, stealth signatures, ring signatures, things like that. And then there's tumblers and mixers. Right. So tornado cache is a tumbler or a mixer. Right. So a tumblr mixer service is a service in which you can actually, for anyone who hasn't used tornado cash, you basically mix traceable coins with other clean tokens in an effort to make it harder to trace the original source of those tokens. You can think of it like a blender.
00:15:58.762 - 00:16:30.854, Speaker A: You put in the coins that you want to anonymize. Those coins get chopped up into different pieces mixed with a bunch of other coins, and then it gets sent to a new address. And then to make it even harder to trace, a lot of the tumblers actually randomize the amount that they pay you back so you'll still get your. Your full value back. So if I put in one ETH, I'm still going to get one ETH back. But instead of being sent one ETH, it might be like four or five or six different transactions of ETH in separate transactions. And because these mixers work by distributing coins kind of at random, there's really no telling where.
00:16:30.854 - 00:16:41.506, Speaker A: Where your coin actually came from. And with tornado cash, it launched. I mean, it's been around for like three years. It's. Would you say, Santiago? It's the most popular mixer protocol, at least Ethereum.
00:16:41.530 - 00:16:43.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think generally, yes.
00:16:44.058 - 00:17:09.018, Speaker A: I think in general. Right, so it's a mix of protocol. On Ethereum, it accepts ETH and USDC token deposits. Basically, it's, the goal is to break the link between the source and the destination of token deposits. Reason being, if you. So I think. I think maybe what the government would say here is that if I am sending my capital into a mixer, I'm doing something illegal.
00:17:09.018 - 00:17:41.406, Speaker A: But there's a lot of different reasons why. Because everything is public on the blockchain and traceable. If I pay for a service in ETH, like, let's say I go buy something and I spend $100 for my metamask wallet. Now someone knows my wallet and they can basically see all of my financial history because everything's on this public ledger. Let's say I want to anonymously donate some ETH, like Vitalik did. Vitalik used tornado cash to have to donate his ETH or he would have been doxxed. Ultimately, he'd end up getting doxed there.
00:17:41.406 - 00:18:22.220, Speaker A: If you get paid in crypto and you don't want your employer to know all of your financial details, right, something like Tornado would come in. Now, I think what OFAC would point to, and I think what they did point to with this OFAC list is there was a report by chainalysis that was released last month. It said that illicit addresses account in 2021 accounted for 12% of capital sent to mixers. This year, that's doubled. It's now about 25 or 24% of funds that have been sent to mixers are from illicit addresses. So that's a quarter of addresses going into these mixers is actually kind of illicit from illegal addresses. So I think that's probably the argument.
00:18:22.220 - 00:18:55.514, Speaker A: However, anytime one of these, it becomes a game of whack a mole, right? You knock one of these down, you pick them back up. We saw that with things like Pirate Bay back in the day. There's this one user quote, I remember the user says, I remember one time when they took down the original Pirate Bay URL, the.org site. The next day you could go on Google and find 100 identical pirate Bay mirror sites with the same torrents. I think the same thing will end up happening here with tornado cache. But I don't know, I'm already seeing a couple of copycat tornadoes popping up.
00:18:55.594 - 00:19:03.366, Speaker B: But I mean, importantly, the smart contract still works, so you can't take that down. Yeah, I mean, of course, right now.
00:19:03.550 - 00:19:27.160, Speaker A: The code for anyone that has access can just be copy pasted and redeployed on ETH too, if it gets taken down. I guess it's more complicated because users now know instead of something like a pirate bay, or did you ever use Limewire or like frost wire? Now, because there's capital involved, users know they're kind of playing in riskier waters if they interact with the mixer.
00:19:27.312 - 00:19:54.544, Speaker B: The thing that is required for all of these mixers is a certain amount of capital to support the sufficiently large n, if you will, to support the anonymity proof, if you will. Because if you don't have enough pools, if you will, then it becomes easier to, you know, I guess it becomes harder to anonymize.
00:19:54.964 - 00:20:19.754, Speaker A: So the analogy being like a scale, right. The efficacy of a privacy protocol is completely dependent on the number of users. It's like if this, if you're in a baseball stadium, the stands are full of fans. It's really, really, really hard to pick out a single person in that stadium. But if you got like seven people there. Yeah, it's very easy to find the fans. Yeah.
00:20:20.134 - 00:21:04.574, Speaker B: My intuition is that, you know, the regulators are just simply saying, look, it's being used by Lazarus group, which is tied to North Korea. That's an enemy of the state that's in the sanctions list. And so let's just take it down. It's more. Even though technically you can, you know, you can use tools like chain analysis to. To DMX to kind of understand where these funds are going and also put pressure on exchanges to make sure in the off ramps to make sure that it's harder for criminal activity to cash out, if you will. But, yeah, I'm not candidly, not very surprised.
00:21:04.874 - 00:21:52.014, Speaker A: Yeah. So after the announcement, GitHub suspended accounts associated with tornado cash, including the co founder Roman Infuria Alchemy. These kind of, like, centralized infrastructures and service companies in crypto that are used by the majority of ETH wallets block the Tornado RPC endpoints, meaning that these wallets could no longer interact with the tornado contracts. I think you said Opensea is shutting down folks who are shutting down accounts who have had capital related to that has gone through tornado. I think you sent this tweet out. It makes you realize how much of crypto infrastructure is actually reliant on. On some of these central centralized service providers that can just make these, these decisions by, you know, some executives in a room.
00:21:52.354 - 00:22:50.808, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about. I mean, this, I think, is a reminder. Let's talk about the dependencies on AWS for a lot. Let's talk about the dependencies on DNS. I mean, technically, you know, DNS is quasi decentralizing. I'm not. But, but still, like, you know, in many ways, like curve finance got hacked and a few other front ends have been hacked because whether it's an inside job or just some careless security measures of these, like of these web, two companies that are, that are hosting the domain, then just, it just becomes, it's just further, like, I think puts, I'm glad, I'm not saying I'm glad this happened, but I think it's just a reminder that we, there needs, there's a whole lot of parts of the stack that still need to be decentralized if web3 is going to be resilient as we want it to be, not because we want to go against, you know, like, and do criminal activities.
00:22:50.808 - 00:22:59.360, Speaker B: It's purely because, you know, the road to decentralization is a difficult one and it's going to take years to accomplish.
00:22:59.552 - 00:23:18.152, Speaker A: All right, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky.
00:23:18.152 - 00:23:46.360, Speaker A: They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem system. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet.
00:23:46.360 - 00:24:17.350, Speaker A: It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now. Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to Avalanche's robust DeFi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes unwrapping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes it's really, really nice.
00:24:17.350 - 00:24:33.674, Speaker A: If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the the link below. Now let's get back to the show. Yep, yep. Move on to USCC or anything else on tornado.
00:24:34.094 - 00:24:37.594, Speaker B: No, I think we discovered it pretty much cool.
00:24:38.614 - 00:25:25.112, Speaker A: Circle, the issuer of the US of USDC froze. I think it was like $75,000 worth of USDC. That feels small, but maybe is just 75k big hoopla for just $75,000 but $75,000 worth of USDC that was linked to about 81 newly blacklisted addresses on Monday. One of the addresses belongs to Tornado Cash's USDC pool. This means that those who deposited their USDC on tornado cash may not be able to withdraw their funds. Jeremy Allaire came out with the CEO of Circle came out with a post kind of explaining why. He said yesterday US treasury designated for sanctions ETH addresses associated with tornado cash as a US regulated financial institution subject to the Bank Secrecy act requirements.
00:25:25.112 - 00:26:17.464, Speaker A: Circle, together with our partner Coinbase, restricted the movement of USDC funds in these sanctioned addresses. It is likely that nearly all responsible registered virtual asset service providers also took steps to block customers with transacting with these addresses or face charges of willfully avoiding us sanctions compliance obligations, which can bring up to 30 years in prison. Big federal offense right there. And so that's the reason that they did it. I did some research and shout out to Garrett, our producer, did some research into blacklisting tokens because I realized I didn't fully understand what it means to blacklist a token, and I thought it'd be interesting to share here. So how can addresses be blacklisted from receiving or sending certain tokens? Here's how it works. Tokens like USDC, this is a good reminder that they're just, they're just simply numbers stored on an Ethereum token contract.
00:26:17.464 - 00:27:07.404, Speaker A: We have these ideas of you've got your metamask, you almost have an image of tokens sitting in a metamask wallet. That is obviously not how it works. The token contracts using ERC 20 standard contain parameters and data like token supply and inflation rate and the state of ownership balances, aka which addresses own how many tokens when you send a token to another wallet. So I send you a bunch of USDC, there's not a token that actually leaves my metamask wallet. There's not like a, there's not some token that's, that sends, that moves across the ether and gets into your wallet. Instead, your private key signs a transaction that calls the transfer function of a token smart contract, which then updates the ownership balances via just debiting and crediting different accounts. Right? So your metamask wallet kind of looks like it contains these tokens, but that's not actually the case.
00:27:07.404 - 00:27:56.264, Speaker A: The wallet has a public private key pair. Your metamask pings each ETH address token to our token contract to find ownership balances that match your public address. So that's, I think that's important understanding, because what a blacklist means is that because the tokens are contracts, you can add different parameters. And that's how USCC has the ability to blacklist addresses. Every time an address is about to make a transaction involving USCC, the USDC token smart contract checks a list of addresses to see if the sender or the receiver is on the list. If so, if they're on the list, the transaction gets blocked and this in effect freezes the balance of the listed account. So I don't know, I think that's just an important reminder of like, here's how this stuff actually works, here's how it can get blacklisted.
00:27:56.264 - 00:28:15.496, Speaker A: And yeah, I don't know, I'm curious if you think that this USDC blacklist is, you know, a lot of people in Defi were panicking and freaking out and like, the impact on maker is massive and on the uniswap pools, really, really big impact. I for one think it's kind of overblown but I'm curious how big of a concern you think this is.
00:28:15.600 - 00:28:20.040, Speaker B: Well, you don't know until it happens.
00:28:20.192 - 00:28:33.214, Speaker A: I think I'd say. I think I'd say short term, overblown. I don't think anything's going to short term, overblown. Long term, we should be very cautious in making. Doing things to move away from these regulated entities.
00:28:33.374 - 00:29:02.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, you know, crypto has always been a story, a tale like two cities, one where we value decentralization, but we continue to use a lot of centralized solutions. And candidly, like, I'm not. I'm not saying that in a facetious manner. I think it's just sort of the state of affairs. And at some point there's, you know, there's a practical component of it. You know, USDC is a widely used stable coin. It touches so many protocols across defi.
00:29:02.574 - 00:29:29.236, Speaker B: Basically, if USDC were to shut down, then you kill Defi then and there, maybe you reset with some sort of decentralized, stable coin. It does place emphasis again on what is the Achilles heel of the space, which is central, like censor. It wasn't censorship, not like sends seizure, nonseizure resistant coins. And, you know, yeah, I mean, if.
00:29:29.260 - 00:29:46.124, Speaker A: Sir, if circle blacklisted all. If of if the treasury came after circle, told them that they had to basically blacklist all of the protocols that had interacted with any kind of like, quote unquote dirty, dirty USDC, that would probably be the best attack on DeFi they could do.
00:29:46.284 - 00:29:46.716, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:46.740 - 00:29:55.404, Speaker A: I mean, it would destroy 98.95, 9.8% of Defi use cases right now. And I'm sure we would rebuild, but.
00:29:57.024 - 00:30:29.584, Speaker B: This is the choke point. And so while you look at other solutions, rye and a few others, maybe fracs, but Fracs is USDC. And as part of. And so again, it's something in long term, we need truly decentralized, stable coins. So I don't have much to say here. I'm in sort of wait and see mode. I'm really curious what the second 3rd order effects are here.
00:30:29.584 - 00:31:28.154, Speaker B: A lot of times they might issue some sort of action, but sometimes maybe they're not seeing the full implication of it. And I think the crypto community has been good at addressing these front on immediately. There were concerns that you're listing what happens to x, y, z, and we don't really know. And so again, it's sort of wait and see mode. The best we can hope is for constituents within crypto that are in touch with regulators, can explain to them, perhaps a bit more of the technology and help them see kind of the folks like Jake, Rebecca, the Blockchain association, those guys do coinsetter. They do great work to explain the technology to these folks and make sure that maybe instead of using a chainsaw, they use a finer knife to really cut through and regulate and crack down on criminal activity.
00:31:28.494 - 00:32:22.602, Speaker A: So I think with regards to decentralized tables, I think it's a reminder that OFAC can really sanction anything. They can sanction a smart contract, a DAO, an entity, a protocol, a thing they can make it illegal to use, to own, to help to maintain, like they do with drugs and tornado. This can apply to really anything. I think the key piece of this is whether or not there is someone to actually sanction behind the scenes. So, like with USCC, they go to the executive team at Circle and they go talk to Jeremy Lair and they say, hey, you're facing time in prison for this. The question is whether or not the stablecoin or the protocol actually has the ability to blacklist the contracts, whether or not there's someone or something to go after behind the scenes. And I think that's why you see a lot of these protocols racing to decentralize form daos and foundations and things like that, and get away from having a core team.
00:32:22.698 - 00:33:38.100, Speaker B: Yeah, let me just put all this in perspective. Like the sanctions recently on Russia, you know, how much of a mess that was and still continues to be for pretty much everyone that trades commodities, grain, gas, like, it's super hard to. The implementation of these things is very hard. Like, even today, like, you know, there's still so much uncertainty that like, you know, ships are not leaving the dock, you know, pipelines are 2030, 40% of their capacity, because there's just not a way to, like, for a bank to like, like process a payment or a fee on top, because then they fear that they're going to, like violate these sanctions. In a very idealistic case, I'm just going to put it out there. If you had everything flowing through crypto rails programmatically, like through programmable money identified wallets, then it'd probably be easier to enforce sanctions, probably easier to see flows and monitor activity than what you have in the traditional financial system, which is a patchwork of things that are not, don't communicate very easily with each other. It's sure the Swift network, we had a great episode talk about that way back.
00:33:38.100 - 00:34:01.146, Speaker B: It is very hard. And so that's kind of like, you know, we'll get there at some point, but I would if I, if I'm a regulator, I would much rather. I think what I'm trying to say is sanctions are easier to enforce in a perfectly transparent financial system with programmable money. And that's not a bad thing, Kendra.
00:34:01.330 - 00:34:19.330, Speaker A: No, true, true. I mean, how bad is this for someone like Maker? Right. A huge percentage of their collateral is USDC. I think this is how it works. But again, this is kind of classic US regulator. There's so much uncertainty. So I'm really not sure how this works.
00:34:19.330 - 00:34:28.693, Speaker A: But if some tainted USDC gets into the smart contract that deposits USDC and mints the die, can that not be used at exchanges now?
00:34:29.073 - 00:35:33.038, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think maybe I'm being too optimistic here. But like, I think regulators have increasingly understood that this is a pretty impactful technological revolution and they want to take their time to regulate it in a sensible manner. But what is the motivation to shut down maker? Like, or to make, you know, I mean, like, I think I don't want to like, start panicking because I do think tornado is just, it's just front and center. It's, it's, it's a, it's like at the edge, right? It's, it's easy to, perhaps they think to chop off, but like, you're left wondering like, what is the motivation for a regulator to come in and try to shut down something like maker? I don't know. I, I don't see, I don't see like it, it happening. Well, but I mean, I'm sure maybe they wake up one day, they want to do it. But, yeah, if there's like a tainted wallet and you already have identified that, then there's not much you can do other than say, wait a minute, the smart contract, you can't shut down.
00:35:33.038 - 00:36:30.286, Speaker B: You maybe can try to do something on the front end level, but, you know, as we know, that's not the solution. The real kind of solution really is whenever these entities need to pay real world costs, well, try to monitor and put pressure on the end, on the off ramp. To me, that's always been, I get, I think Defi is going to be permissioned mostly KYC at some point. And so you identify these funds and then you regulate the end, the entry points of this transparent system, because if you really do a good job at that point, then you understand exactly what's going on. And it's almost like if you're a criminal, sure, if you're like a hacker group, like, yeah, these are honeypots. You're going to try to go after them cashing out is where I think you should really put emphasis. In the same way that you regulate banks, folks like HSBC and Standard Chartered and Deutsche bank, they get inspected.
00:36:30.286 - 00:36:50.122, Speaker B: There's rules, there's regulations. It still happens. They get fined all the time for money laundering. That's a human fault. Humans can be corrupted, I guess. But you see what I'm saying? Like, I think that, like, if I were talking to a regular right now, I'd say, wait a minute, let's put pressure on exchanges. Absolutely.
00:36:50.122 - 00:37:14.630, Speaker B: Let's focus on that. Make sure that it's very near impossible for these wallets that you've already identified because, oh, by the way, it's a perfectly transparent system. You kind of can use these tracing solutions like chainalysis. The problem, of course, is the tornado. You see now in that flow, they're like, oh, wait a minute. But tornado makes it really hard because if you bring back funds back to the exchange, you can kind of get away with it. But it's like, wait, wait a minute.
00:37:14.630 - 00:38:03.674, Speaker B: With Tornado, I think the fault in the logic is with tornado, you can create a proof that says, here's where my money comes from, and it's clean, legit. And I think that's where they use that. Again, the analogy, a chainsaw to go after this, as opposed to saying, go to the exchanges and say, maybe you can't accept funds that come from tornado. You just need to make sure that you check these boxes, that they provide this proof. And unless someone comes in the pod and says to me, that's not possible, I don't see why the version of continuing to allow privacy preserving solutions and mixers that allow for this proof to be generated that can unveil and reveal the origin of the funds. As long as that's true, then these two worlds coexist and law enforcement is happy, I think. But tell me where I'm wrong.
00:38:04.024 - 00:38:19.564, Speaker A: I mean, let's. Let's play this out. Let's do a little thought experiment. And Eric Peters from one river talked about this on the podcast recently. We'll throw a link in the show notes to that episode. It feels like we're on this inevitable path to Kyc, right? So a little thought experiment. You take all of today's defi protocols.
00:38:19.564 - 00:38:31.460, Speaker A: Uniswap, Aave, synthetix. You take all. You take all the blue chip defi protocols, or screw it, you take all of them. You fork them, you add a KYC requirement. What happens to the flow of capital?
00:38:31.572 - 00:38:57.916, Speaker B: Do you think that increases order magnitude or two? Because finally, entities that want to operate in the system are going to feel comfortable. People like Eric will want to use these things in a permission context, because if the pool is, is Kyc, you know, your counterparty, there's so many people that are on the fence. How much capital do you think is, is waiting to interact in the system, but hasn't because of the same reason.
00:38:57.940 - 00:39:57.398, Speaker A: That Eric told, you know what this is Santi? This is a, this is a standoff right now between the folks who were in crypto for the last decade, folks who believe in self sovereignty, libertarian ideals, anti KYC, AML, pro privacy, things like that. This is a standoff between the anarchist crowd of crypto that I have a lot of sympathy and empathy for, and the, the new crowd whos coming in saying, look, this is not about ideals, this is not about any of that libertarian, anything like that. What this is about is just a better technology and improving the system and saying that our traditional capital market system is broken and that we dont have the right technologies in place to introduce things like scarcity to a digital environment into a global first world. Those are the two camps that are battling right now.
00:39:57.526 - 00:40:44.106, Speaker B: It's not really going to matter, right. Because I don't see a world where this doesn't happen. I mean, there always perhaps will exist this, this wild west of Defi, but it's going to be such a small corner in the grand scheme of things. Look, if you really want to, the privacy hack right now is send your coins to an exchange and then, and then send them back to another wallet if you want to continue to operate on chain. And, you know, I personally have not used tornado ever thinking that there was a possibility. That said differently. I've heard of funds that have shielded their zcash and feds come knocking on their door because only a very small subset of people are shielding.
00:40:44.106 - 00:40:48.542, Speaker B: And so if you're shielding it, you're giving, you're sort of like, it is suspicious.
00:40:48.598 - 00:40:53.174, Speaker A: Right. Right. If you buy Zcash, even on something like Coinbase, you are, there's no privacy right there.
00:40:53.254 - 00:40:54.334, Speaker B: No, you need to shield it.
00:40:54.374 - 00:40:54.550, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:54.582 - 00:41:40.610, Speaker B: Or I guess before they upgrade. Like, it was not shielded by default, and so if you shielded it, it raised rightfully so, right. It was gonna raise. It's like if you walk in a store right now and pay with cash, like a $10,000 handbag or whatever, well, you know, like with wads of 20, I'm sorry, but this is gonna raise all kinds of alarms and you're going to report that and it's the same way. Right. If people want to do privacy, send it to an exchange and send it to another wallet. And so I think that's also perhaps, perhaps that's, I don't want to say perhaps that's what regulators are seeing, which is most of the activity that's happening on tornado is from people that, you know, had the option to send it to an exchange where they would be easily identified but instead use tornado.
00:41:40.762 - 00:41:41.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:41.346 - 00:41:55.602, Speaker B: Now, I'm not saying it's not super accurate because there are counterparty risks. There are risk of sending it to an exchange. You're taking some level of risk and understand some people may not want to do that. It may rather interact. A smart contract, but still as sitting.
00:41:55.618 - 00:42:09.558, Speaker A: In the investor seat and you're see right now, Santi, does this help or hurt privacy focused chains? Does this make you more or less likely to invest in privacy focused things like l one s and l two s?
00:42:09.686 - 00:42:52.836, Speaker B: I still want to explore and invest in things that are a privacy layer on top of a very popular l one like Ethereum. And I think we should just place a ton of emphasis on the ability to have privacy while at the same time being able to unshield it and reveal origin of fonts and be regulatory compliant. I don't see these two things as mutually exclusive. I see them coexisting. It's just a matter of education. It's a matter of, I think the technology is there like a zero knowledge proof or some sort of ring or some sort of signature. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is it is possible.
00:42:52.836 - 00:43:28.740, Speaker B: We just need to have the right dialogue. And look, these things sometimes need to happen. And I think Tornado got big enough and, and because of these recent hacks was put into question. And a lot of times, you know, I think we can go back and now directly talk to regulators because it has opened up a discussion. And that's, I think the bright side of all this is it's going to force a discussion between people within crypto and regulators to talk about privacy, to talk about these solutions. And some of these things are pretty technical and hard to understand, and so it's just going to take time.
00:43:28.852 - 00:43:39.824, Speaker A: Coinbase earnings Curve, front end hack or update on the uniswap V switch, where do you want to go? Or ETH proof of work chain, where do you want to go?
00:43:40.204 - 00:43:45.260, Speaker B: I mean, the curve hack is quick to cover and then we can do Coinbase and then the rest, I guess.
00:43:45.412 - 00:44:06.784, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. Curve two minutes on curve. Just update, folks. Curve confirm reports that its website had suffered a front end attack on Tuesday. Basically, hackers apparently compromised the curve website or the curve domain name to redirect users or their transactions to a malicious destination. This is called DNS spoofing.
00:44:06.784 - 00:44:32.344, Speaker A: They cloned the site. They made the DNS point to their IP where the clone site is deployed. They added approval requests to a malicious contract. I think they made off with about a half a million in ETH that they then sent to. Speaking of mixers, actually, no. I think they sent it to a centralized exchange, fixed float exchange. I don't actually know the fixed float, but fixed float said it froze about $200,000 of the half million.
00:44:32.344 - 00:45:08.100, Speaker A: The curved Twitter account tweeted last night that the issue had been found and reverted. Yeah, there are a lot of hacks these days, a lot of little things like this. There's so many different vectors and points of attack, whether it's the front end, whether it's smart contract risk. But it does remind you that we're running these DeFi protocols, but 99.99% of users access it through web pages that are hosted on traditional centralized infrastructure. Long way to go until all this is not run by the centralized providers.
00:45:08.132 - 00:45:21.516, Speaker B: Quick reminder, if you're ever approving something new in a protocol, front end that you constantly use, immediate red flag like immediate, and always check whatever it is, the contract that you're interacting with. Always, always, always say that again.
00:45:21.540 - 00:45:23.364, Speaker A: Santu. Say that in more detail.
00:45:23.524 - 00:46:10.124, Speaker B: Anytime that you go to a bookmarked site, front end of a protocol that you're using, curve, uniswap, whatever sushi maker, anytime there's a new pop up, if you will, on Metamask, it says approve new contract, immediate red flag, like. Like stop everything, do not click, go to Twitter, go to their comms, and ask, why am I being asked to sign this new contract? Approval. Anytime you're signing a new approval, you have to inspect the contract. And if you're not technical enough to understand what you're signing, don't sign it. It can wait. Always it can wait. Ask, go to discord, and it's literally in five minutes you'll get an answer.
00:46:10.124 - 00:46:31.904, Speaker B: And if you don't get an answer, don't sign. Write these things down, put them on the left side of your screen notes, whatever you want to do, big. Just don't approve stuff if you don't know what you're approving and ask, play dumb. It never goes to your advantage in this phase to act like you know what you're doing. It's always better to act though. Or be dumb like preach.
00:46:32.684 - 00:46:51.740, Speaker A: Coinbase. Coinbase has had a volatile year between just the market crashing its stocks down like 60 70% on the year. At one point it was down like, I think 80%. Their market sentiment asking if crypto has missed or if Coinbase kind of missed its first mover opportunity. They just released earnings yesterday. Here's the deal. Coinbase announced Q two earnings on Tuesday.
00:46:51.740 - 00:47:25.622, Speaker A: They missed projections again with $803 million in revenue on the quarter, down from 1.2 billion in Q one. So $400 million decrease from Q one to Q two in revenue. Revenue from some interesting stats here. Revenue from subscription and services came in at about 150 million, down 3% from Q one, up 44% year over year. It's interesting to see just Coinbase even though it's only, it's a small percentage of their revenue. It's seems to be a big emphasis for Coinbase.
00:47:25.622 - 00:47:55.722, Speaker A: Probably smart due to the volatility of transaction fee revenue. What else is interesting? 9 million monthly transaction transacting users, down from 9.2 in Q one and eleven in Q four lost $1.1 billion. They've got about 5000 full time employees paying roughly $4 billion a year for them. This was an interesting one. Retail represented only represents about 20% of trading volume, yet 94% of their trading revenue.
00:47:55.722 - 00:48:28.480, Speaker A: Nothing new here, but just a reminder that the exchanges make a lot of their money from retail. Again, 20% of the trading volume came from retail. 94% of their revenue was from retail. So, I mean, not too much. That's interesting. In my mind, interesting takeaways would probably be like similar to our conversation about Uniswap like, fees eventually trend towards zero for all. Maybe take Uniswap out of this, because I know you disagreed with me there, but for all these centralized crypto infrastructure providers, fees eventually trend towards zero.
00:48:28.480 - 00:49:01.426, Speaker A: Not just for crypto, but TD Ameritrade E trade. Charles Schwab Robinhood Cash app fees trend to zero over time it's clear that Coinbase is fighting to make their wallet services Coinbase cloud staking subscription a much larger percent of their revenue. You can kind of think about this as like media companies today. Like I saw the New York Times chart of the New York Times, revenue used to be all ad based, no subscription. Now all media companies are racing to get subscription revenue while their ad revenue continues to fall. It feels similar to what financial services companies are doing.
00:49:01.490 - 00:49:43.294, Speaker B: So, yeah, absolutely. If you're doing like a new model, updating your model on Coinbase, I think you have to factor in most importantly, new, new streams of income, because as you point out, there is going to be a race to the bottom, especially at the institutional side of the house, where it's more competitive. You know, folks like FTX and Binance are increasingly competing and try to lure business. And, you know, I think the value is still Coinbase has is, it is synonymous with crypto, at least in the US. It has, I think you have to. There is value in those users, in that brand recognition, regulatory moats and what have you and licenses. I'd be paying attention to how much particularly staking revenue grows over the next year.
00:49:43.294 - 00:50:00.640, Speaker B: If you believe. Again, proof of stake. Ethereum migrating to proof of stake. A lot of institutions might want to stake their ETH, earn yield on that staking rewards. And so I think that might become. And to my knowledge, Coinbase charges 20% of staking rewards. And so that is.
00:50:00.640 - 00:50:41.148, Speaker B: And they acquired bison trails. And so that is perhaps going to be a big line item in the similar manner that AWS became such a profit generator for Amazon, which wasn't very profitable on kind of the retail front facing side of the house. But AWS has been a monster for them and really has helped them grow and reach profitability. And so I think that's the similar evolution that Coinbase and other exchanges might go through. You have to believe that they sort of add on different kind of business lines and again, they've captured attention. They have the user. How can you cross sell upsell them in other lines of businesses? Gaming, nfts create other stuff.
00:50:41.148 - 00:51:14.486, Speaker B: The question, of course, is what the hell are these all employees doing at Coinbase? My God, they have terrible customer support. Like, literally, I don't know what these people are doing. It feels like a bloated. It feels like a bloated organization. And so, look, I mean, I have obviously, sympathy for the people that have been laid off, but, you know, that to me is just puts into question leadership. Like time and time again, these people get really caught up and over hire and to really capture the market. I'm like, what are you doing? Like, it feels, it feels like a very bloated organization.
00:51:14.486 - 00:51:27.228, Speaker B: So maybe an activist shop is going to come knocking on their door and saying, hey, guys, like, bring in a new management team, bring in more professionalism. And I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Elliott comes knocking on their door.
00:51:27.316 - 00:51:55.724, Speaker A: Yeah, I went, I went on a walk. What day is it? I went on a walk with a senior Coinbase person on Monday of this week. Went on a walk around in Brooklyn for like an hour, just got a little coffee and cruised around. And this was the day before their earnings came out. And he was just, I was just talking to him about the culture at Coinbase and what it's like to work there, he said, and he's been there for a while. He said it used to be a lot of just ship products. Don't worry about how good a product is.
00:51:55.724 - 00:52:22.438, Speaker A: Get the MVP out the door. Ship, ship, ship. And you used to see that Coinbase used to roll out new products all the time and now it's much slower. And obviously that's the nature of growing a company. But he said, it's a lot of slide decks now, a lot of strategy decisions, a lot of these big esoteric conversations about who is the user for different products. They need to get back to just ship, ship, ship mode. So I do his feed.
00:52:22.438 - 00:52:32.158, Speaker A: His feedback too was Brian's on that page. But a lot of the maybe executive team it doesn't feel like is on that page. So that's the problem when you bring in a bunch of big fancy web two execs.
00:52:32.286 - 00:53:07.678, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, I mean, a lot of NBA is, you know, just doing porter five forces and all this crap. I mean, never used DeFi before and just, or bought an NFT. And they're just, you know, opining about the crap that they learn MBA courses and you know what it is like, there's nothing like using these things. My group at JP Morgan was. Was a nice one because we never had associates or vps. It was just, you directly dealt with an Ed or MD and, you know, there's a lot of work, but it cut all that fat, all that middle layer, which is, in my opinion, just fat.
00:53:07.846 - 00:53:12.760, Speaker A: I mean, those are usually the first folks to go. And when, when banks lay off folks is the, are the vps.
00:53:12.942 - 00:53:27.220, Speaker B: I mean, no associate in investment banking. They don't want to. It's like, it's like. It's like you're in the middle of a butt. It's like a butt crack, right. You don't want to get your hands dirty and look at the model, but you feel like you're like, you know, I don't know, like a God. Because you came out of hospital.
00:53:27.372 - 00:53:27.700, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:27.732 - 00:53:51.084, Speaker B: And you know, everything there is to know about the life, you got to figure it out. But then they don't. It's just like a. Look, I said, at some point you have to go up the ladder. I get it. But can you just like go from, I don't know, what comes raiser like point a to point c and skip the b part. Like, I don't know, associates are worthless, I think, in investment banking, but I don't know how the Coinbase culture works.
00:53:52.024 - 00:54:20.692, Speaker A: That's it for Coinbase. Two other things to pay attention to, and then we'll wrap this up. The Uniswap fee switch trial governance proposal was approved on Tuesday, adding a 10% protocol fee to three different Uniswap pools. Test pairs die and Ethan are at five bps ETH and USDT. 30 bps, USDC ETH, one basis, 100 basis points. I mean, this is just something to pay attention to. Uniswap is obviously playing around with what the fee model looks like.
00:54:20.692 - 00:55:02.236, Speaker A: All accrued value is going to remain in the protocol until governance agrees on the best use of funds via votes. Second vote to turn off the fee switch will be submitted 120 days, four months after this vote passes. So this, I mean, this is a smart move on Uniswap's behalf, I think. I really like this move. Just basically testing the model, get it out, ship a minimum viable product, see what works three, four months later, review it and see what they think here. And then there's another thing in Uniswap governance, which is another proposal to allocate 74 million in uni to create and fund a foundation. This is also, I'm sure, going to pass, but just another thing to pay attention to.
00:55:02.340 - 00:55:14.180, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I do like this iteration process. It's a lot of money. 74 million. I read the proposal. I think there's some good elements to that. But it does feel like a lot upfront.
00:55:14.180 - 00:56:07.364, Speaker B: Maybe it should be a bit staged and it will be interesting after 120 days, how governance is going to determine what the best use of funds is going to be and who weighs in on that, who's active on that. Maybe it's part of also creating this foundation and bringing in more leadership that can be stewards of these capital and create certain pods that can receive some of this capital. But, yeah, I wasn't particularly the Uniswap, I think education, they created a fund earlier this year to divert towards lobbying efforts, and they were dispersing pretty significant sums of money to different organizations that were advocating for crypto and lobbying efforts. And so, yeah, we'll have to track this and see how, after 120 days, how this goes down.
00:56:07.484 - 00:56:32.894, Speaker A: Creating a foundation, this is basically just helps them be able to ship faster. It provides grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, just basically anything that will help grow the protocol. And they don't have to go through any sort of voting process. Is that correct? Through a foundation? It's more like. It's like a Dell. It's a Delaware C Corp, right? It's like a Delaware C Corp. They've got like a team of people who vote internally.
00:56:32.894 - 00:56:36.558, Speaker A: It operates more like a company kind of.
00:56:36.646 - 00:57:21.950, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, just for context, like, there is this, like the Uniswap grants program that was created, I think, in 2020. So when Uni launched kind of the token and sort of like, hey, here's the grants program community. You vote, you have responsibility, and as members of this DaO, you. You can influence how we, you know, give out these grants. That program has been fairly successful, I think, like, they've granted, like 120 over 120 grantees, I think over 22 different governance proposals. And so I think a lot of those have been proposals and projects that are going to amplify uniswap.
00:57:21.950 - 00:58:45.652, Speaker B: And your experience using the protocol tooling solutions, how to visualize impermanent loss and all these different things, that has been pretty interesting. Their argument now is there is still a lot of friction that goes on in that process and giving those grants. And so they want to create perhaps a more autonomous organization foundation that has more degrees of freedom to kind of have a set kind of discretion over funds, bring on good leadership, and then just kind of execute on particular kind of missions and proposals and projects. And so, yeah, again, it's the same, the same objective here is to continue to give grants to builders, anyone that it wants to kind of support and build around the uniswap ecosystem. And so I think it's just more removing some of the friction that you've seen historically in governance. Like, it's not very realistic to have every, all uni folders discuss, like, governance forums can be a bit of a mess and be very kind of disparate. And so I think this is just bringing in some sort of hierarchy, some sort of independent organization that can take more responsibility, more leadership, other than Uniswap labs, if you will, to support and grow the protocol with these funds that are being collected.
00:58:45.828 - 00:59:30.330, Speaker A: Yeah, last thing, and then we'll wrap it up. With the merge coming up, there's a growing debate about what's going to happen with the ETH proof of work chain. Are miners going to continue on the chain? How much value is the market going to assign to ETH proof of work? Will exchanges add ETH proof of work or keep it? USDC has already stated that they're only going to redeem USDC from the ETH proof of stake chain. After the merge, this feels like a pretty silly conversation. It feels like the miners are just trying to milk the last bits of a value out of the ETH proof of work chain. I feel like it doesn't really have any technical merit. They're going to try to frame it as this ideological battle despite the ETH roadmap being pretty clear.
00:59:30.330 - 00:59:37.118, Speaker A: Feels kind of like some like bitcoin maxi stuff going on right here. But curious if you think the ETH proof of work chain has any merit.
00:59:37.206 - 01:00:10.034, Speaker B: I don't. And historically, I think a lot of these forks haven't had merit. Okay. You could argue Ethereum classic, you know, has still $8 billion in market cap, but that's jump change relative to Ethereum proper that we know ETH today, 225 million mark like million market cap. I think it's a distraction and I think some of them will take it as an opportunity to make their cash grab. So anyways, I think, yeah, I'm not really supportive of it.
01:00:10.114 - 01:00:10.354, Speaker A: Actually.
01:00:10.394 - 01:00:11.266, Speaker B: Not supportive of it.
01:00:11.330 - 01:00:45.756, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm firmly not supportive of it. I think the way to think about something like some of these forks that actually don't. The minority chains. The way to think about minority chains is imagine an accounting team that has created an excel to project a company's revenue next year. So you've got this like the master doc at the company. Any team member at the company can basically just copy the Excel, create a new version. So you've got like V one, V two, V three, V 100, V 200, change a few parameters, try to convince the team to use, to use the new Excel sheet.
01:00:45.756 - 01:01:13.364, Speaker A: All these Excel sheets can exist simultaneously, but really the only valuable Excel sheet is the one that the majority of the team agrees to use. And I think you're just seeing this like this minority chain is like v 97. Just like nobody cares about this thing except for a small minority, which is like a small team at the company. It's a small minority, which is really just the miners here who are trying to extract value. That's my take. Would be curious about why I'm wrong if anyone's listening and doesn't agree.
01:01:13.484 - 01:02:06.690, Speaker B: Yeah, like I welcome all kind of criticisms. I'll tell you one thing, this is why I've historically, when I first learned about proof of stake, to me it felt like a more natural, balanced way to reach consensus where proof of work. I understand. Look, I don't think it goes away. I think there's only probably one proof of work dominant network, and that's bitcoin. But the idea to have a force within the community, within the ecosystem that is constantly selling to recoup their capex investment miners. To me, I feel like miners don't necessarily have the best interests at heart, long term interest of the protocol, whereas to me it just felt more natural to have the people that are securing the chain also are long term believers, that is, token holders that are willing to stake for a certain period of time to secure and validate blocks.
01:02:06.690 - 01:03:02.208, Speaker B: To me, that is all, to me, that just feels more intuitive, more sustainable model. And if you look back, you know, a lot of times in the bitcoin case and the Ethereum case, miners have been, I think they're like vocal shareholders and I always welcome criticism and a vocal shareholder, but they historically haven't been the most aligned with the community. And look, I understand why because they need to, you know, they have their own interests at heart and they want to, you know, make sure that they're profitable organizations. I get it. But, yeah, to me it just further reinforces the transition to proof of stake is the right one, because I think it just puts more into harmony the people that want to believe in the protocol long term that are also securing the network long. And so to me, that's always felt like a better, more symbiotic relationship.
01:03:02.296 - 01:03:05.204, Speaker A: Agreed? Agreed. Shall we wrap, sir?
01:03:05.704 - 01:03:44.562, Speaker B: One last thing. I want to point out, pretty interesting, Arbitrum launched Nitro, I think it is, and in conjunction with that, pretty interesting, Reddit is rolling out these kind of community points. And so it's a pretty cool use case. I think these community point system awards users based on the quality of their posts. It's kind of like a steemit, but like now with Reddit, but it's interesting that obviously they chose Ethereum and then they chose Arbitrum. And so it's, it's going to be interesting to see how this all plays out. And it's already from Nova that just launched.
01:03:44.562 - 01:04:24.634, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think you're seeing, important to note that I bring this up because you're seeing a lot of activity in these l two s and, you know, bringing on a giant like Reddit and being able to support that in their own, it's pretty, pretty impressive and something to monitor if the chain can support it, if that experience is smooth. And what does that mean? Right. You're all of a sudden bringing on this community points to millions of users. Look, I would be really curious to understand what else may they want to do after they start earning these community points.
01:04:25.014 - 01:04:46.660, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I'm glad that you called this out. Right. You remember in the early days, like in 20 16, 20 17, 20 18, like, people would oftentimes point to, would use Reddit points as the example of this, like, Web two product that should get tokenized. And then here we are five years later, Reddit points are launching on Arbitrum Nova. It's really cool.
01:04:46.692 - 01:05:16.660, Speaker B: This is an example of, like, it may be that a lot of the things that we thought were really cool to be implemented in a Web three context were too early. And it is worth revisiting, not just totally discrediting it. And the similar manner that pets.com was, great idea, terrible execution at the wrong time. And now you have, or Petco, you know, now you have, you know, a pretty successful business. Right. And so I think we'll see a lot of that in crypto.
01:05:16.852 - 01:05:17.628, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:17.796 - 01:05:34.564, Speaker B: And I think the tech will be increasingly ready for gaming, for social, for paint micropayments, for a lot of these things that haven't necessarily worked before but are starting to work and will increasingly so as scalability solutions become more robust.
01:05:34.724 - 01:05:54.292, Speaker A: Agreed. Let's wrap. Sir, if anyone's listening and has not bought a ticket yet, to the digital asset summit, Blockworks institutional conference, macro conference, crypto conference coming up September 14 and 15th. I want to say I better get that one right. It's in New York. It might be 17th and 18th. I'm going to really screw this one up.
01:05:54.292 - 01:05:55.228, Speaker A: So go hit that.
01:05:55.356 - 01:05:58.144, Speaker B: The man doesn't even get the dates for his own.
01:05:58.484 - 01:06:08.378, Speaker A: All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. This is bad. This is going to be really bad. It's 13 and 14. Yeah, it's September 13 and 14th. The glass house, New York City. A thousand people.
01:06:08.378 - 01:06:09.954, Speaker A: Get out of here, Santa. You haven't attended any.
01:06:09.994 - 01:06:11.234, Speaker B: I'm not even going, but I knew that.
01:06:11.274 - 01:06:30.584, Speaker A: Shame on you. You've got a code. Yano 250. Go get it. The reason I'm plugging this so hard, I've got a competition going internally. Whoever's got the most people registering with their code gets a free dinner. If you register with Yano 250, ping me and I'll take you out to dinner or something.
01:06:30.584 - 01:06:31.432, Speaker A: There you go.
01:06:31.528 - 01:06:41.104, Speaker B: There we go. The bribes have begun. Thank you so much. Thank you for tuning in. Stay safe, everyone. And, yeah, keep enjoying the summer, I guess.
