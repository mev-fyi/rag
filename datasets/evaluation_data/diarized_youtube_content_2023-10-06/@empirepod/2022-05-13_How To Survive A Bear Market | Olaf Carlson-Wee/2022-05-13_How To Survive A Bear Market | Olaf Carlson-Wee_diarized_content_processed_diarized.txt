00:00:00.360 - 00:00:29.878, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. All right, everyone, back with a special episode of Empire. I'm joined today not by Santiago, but by my co founder, Mike Ippolito, and also a very special guest, Olaf Carlson, we CEO and founder of Polychain Capital. Olaf, welcome to Empire.
00:00:30.006 - 00:00:31.182, Speaker B: Hey, guys, thanks for having me.
00:00:31.198 - 00:00:36.174, Speaker C: Of course, you didn't introduce me as a b squad this time, so already I'm leveling up since the last episode.
00:00:36.214 - 00:00:46.110, Speaker A: I know, exactly. Yeah, exactly. B squad is back. So, Olaf, we're excited to have you. Man. This is a crazy, crazy, crazy time in crypto. So we're excited that you were able to make time to jump on here.
00:00:46.110 - 00:01:00.542, Speaker A: I just wanted to actually start pretty high level and just get your framework for how you're viewing things. Right. Terra seems to kind of be falling apart. Right. The peg on ust broke. It went down from a dollar down to $0.30. It's back up to time of recording.
00:01:00.542 - 00:01:18.502, Speaker A: Luna has fallen from, like, $84 down to, like, two or $3 bitcoins down to 30k. Um, and a lot of things are, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80% off the highs. So maybe we can just start broaden. I'd ask you, like, what is. You've been through so many cycles, like, what is your framework for how you're viewing the markets right now?
00:01:18.678 - 00:02:16.574, Speaker B: Yeah. So, um, as a backdrop, I mean, I went through the 20, 2011 crash, um, the 2014 crash, the 2018 crash, and now I think I can safely say, like, the 2022 crash. So I just think crypto is highly cyclical. It kind of always has been, obviously, I guess. And what happens is there's this sort of, there's this thing that happens in crypto with newcomers, especially where new people always find out about crypto during one of these, like, market cycles, and it's during the high points in the cycle. So I got into crypto basically at the exact peak of the 2011 run up. And I think if you ask everyone in crypto, I would say 90% of people found out during basically the exact peak of one of these market cycles.
00:02:16.574 - 00:03:54.094, Speaker B: So it's this weird way that crypto spreads into new users, but then the real actual process of building things in crypto, I think it generally happens in a more focused and pragmatic way when markets are low and there's not this flood of new people coming in. Basically, the macro growth slows down and then it's up to actual entrepreneurs and engineers and builders to, like, create useful products and services, rather than there being such a strong macro tailwind that everybody can just sort of ride the wave, so to speak. So I actually think it's. Sometimes I wish it wasn't so crazy in crypto, like the way that it really goes up quite a bit and down quite a bit. But I do think it's sort of healthy, the cyclical nature of crypto, because it helps people just sort of, it really helps a lot of capital come into the space and a lot of new people come into the space. And so you get this kind of Sci-Fi moment where it feels like anything is possible, and then you can sort of use those new users and that new capital to actually build useful products during the bear markets. And it's during those bear markets that everything important has ever been developed, I would say bear market one Coinbase was founded 2012, Bear Market 220 15, Ethereum launched.
00:03:54.094 - 00:04:56.394, Speaker B: Bear market 320 18 to 19 is when the beginnings of both Defi and NFTs launched. I just think that I'm very excited to see what the big important thing that comes out of this bear market is. And that's mostly what I'm going to spend my time on, is trying to figure out what's the next sort of macro trend that will drive, you know, drive the next narrative and drive the kind of next wave of new users, like what will inspire them to get into crypto. Now, that said, you know, for people whose first time it is going through one of these market cycles, it's probably pretty scary. And I don't have a lot to say other than you just have to deal with it. I don't think there's a really simple way to navigate it. It's just take comfort in that.
00:04:56.394 - 00:05:15.266, Speaker B: I've been a professional crypto investor for years, but the first investment I ever made in crypto, I lost over 90% on instantly, basically, which was bitcoin in 2011. So I think it happens to everybody when they first get into crypto.
00:05:15.450 - 00:05:43.870, Speaker A: Olaf, let me ask you this. There are cycles in every industry. I'm reading this book about Rockefeller right now, and it's talking about the oil cycles and moved in very, actually similar manner to crypto, and laying the railroads in America moved in a very cyclical manner. The tech, um, everyone points to kind of like the similarities between crypto and the.com bubble. But it does feel like crypto moves in these, uh, very intensified cycles that happen very quickly. It's not like a decade long cycle.
00:05:43.870 - 00:06:02.394, Speaker A: It's maybe a 18 month or two year or three year cycle. Um, and so I'm curious to get your take on why, like, what, what does cause these very intensified cycles? And is this something that you see eventually slowing down? Is the intensification of these cycles, or is this is just something that's inherently just in the nature of crypto?
00:06:02.554 - 00:07:19.230, Speaker B: I think that because crypto is such a brand new category, and it sort of rejects so many of the archetypes of the old system, both from a financial and a technology perspective, that it just means the product development and technology development is really fast and very hard to predict. So the way that crypto has sort of blown up and, like, the number of users that have come in and the number of new products and new technologies that have been developed, it's really fast. Like, it's very, very hard to keep up with. Everybody who's in crypto knows that. It's just sort of like the number of kind of fringe crypto projects is, at this point, uncountable. It's actually crazy when I truly try to grasp in my head all at once how many weird little crypto projects are out there. It's like trying to keep track of every weird little website in the early days of the Internet, it's financial in a lot of ways, so it's a little bit different than just those websites.
00:07:19.230 - 00:08:05.562, Speaker B: But that's really, like, the scope of the entrepreneurial experiment here. It's like, we're all going to make websites. One of them will turn out to be Amazon.com. But, like, literally anybody can make a website, right? So I do think because of that, like, massive entrepreneurial laboratory, there's just a lot of chaos. But also it means things move really quickly, if a bit savagely. Like, there's lots and lots of failures in order to get those one or two things that really, really work and move the whole thing forward. So because of that whole kind of entrepreneurial laboratory, I just think the whole thing moves fast, and that means new things get developed very quickly.
00:08:05.562 - 00:09:13.032, Speaker B: And so then these rises and falls of interest happen very quickly. Like, with the invention of icos and crowdfunding, you sort of saw this incredible wave of interest in 2017, and then it turned out that was sort of incomplete and really just a component of this larger concept of DeFi that really had some real legs to it and really feels like it is going to be long term. They sort of substrate of the global financial system. So I think that there's also this dichotomy I think oftentimes with young crypto projects between, like, this will radically transform the entire world. And, like, we have 100 users, right? And it's like, you can see it, right? This is. But, like, it's sort of hard to then price such a thing, right. I think this is how I felt about bitcoin when I first found out about it.
00:09:13.032 - 00:09:43.276, Speaker B: It was like, wow, this is like, you know, this is going to actually replace, you know, state backed money. Like, it's the craziest. It's such a huge concept. It's way beyond technology. It's like a social phenomenon. But at the same time, I'm on Mount Gox doing this janky stuff to try to buy it, and it's just not there yet. It's really hard to price that thing.
00:09:43.276 - 00:10:18.814, Speaker B: And it makes sense to me that you can see this future, but the reality is pretty bleak in the moment, and then it's very volatile because you're tracking from a to balance. So, yeah, I do think all of these add up to why crypto is, like, so crazy. And then on top of that, a lot of people are using leverage, which just, you know, I broadly would not recommend for the average person, but a lot of people use leverage. And so all of the stuff I'm talking about that's sort of fundamental just gets. It gets worse with leverage.
00:10:19.314 - 00:10:54.406, Speaker C: I have a question for you, Olaf. Just having lived through many of these particular cycles in crypto yourself, so I get your emotional advice, is that people just need to deal with it. But, like, what are some patterns that you might have noticed having lived through these cycles in the past, right. Because there's always a narrative that accompanies the fall in price. So. And there usually are external events. Like, in 2014, it was ersmount Gox, right, that broke in 2017 to 2018, it was kind of the unwinding of the ICO bubble during this particular one, people are very focused on, and I want to lead into kind of Ust and everything that's going on there, but people are very focused on the macro, right.
00:10:54.406 - 00:11:15.408, Speaker C: And everything that's going on with the interest rate environment. And then we've just kind of had a stable coin blow up on us. So I guess just having lived through many of these in the past, what are some kind of repeated patterns that you've noticed going through these market cycles and then specifically things that you might be on the lookout for? For, like, all right, this feels like a bottom or as low as we're going to go, or just things of that nature.
00:11:15.566 - 00:12:20.462, Speaker B: Yep. I mean, these, you know, it is interesting how there's like these, there's like these single project events that blow up that sometimes feel like they're accompanying just like the larger market cycle. If I had to place them, it'd probably be. It'd probably be like Mount Gox, maybe bitconnect or something. And then now it just feels like it's definitely this deep egg of USt and the accompanying fallout of Luna and the ecosystem there. Part of the reason is a lot of systems in crypto at a base level have leverage sort of embedded inside them. In the case of Mount Gox, this was the willy bot and basically the insolvency of the platform.
00:12:20.462 - 00:12:40.048, Speaker B: So it was artificially buying a lot more than the actual demand in the market. That works just fine. As long as the price keeps going up forever, nobody will notice willy bot exists. But then once the price turns the other way, all of a sudden, you know, you will recognize that this is a problem.
00:12:40.216 - 00:12:46.584, Speaker A: And Olaf, the willy bot, for those who don't know this was the. Was this an automated trading? Yes, that was happening on Memcache.
00:12:46.704 - 00:13:36.204, Speaker B: So it's a little unclear exactly who built it, I think, but broadly, some, you know, somebody you know, and I don't want to point fingers, I have no idea really what was happening. But there was an account at Mount Gox that was generated by an administrator. It was automated, and it purchased a ton of bitcoin, like every two minutes or something. It was just very regularly bidding the order book very heavily. But there wasn't real money in the account, actually, it was just sort of a database entry that this account had a ton of money in it. So it was bidding up the price in the order book, but there wasn't like, it became like fractional reserve. There wasn't actually money there to pay for it.
00:13:36.204 - 00:14:47.934, Speaker B: And Mount Gox at the time was like 80% of the trade volume in all of bitcoin. And there was no other coin, really, there was just bitcoin. So Willie bot drove the price up very dramatically. And then when it unwound the other way and Mount Gox came out as insolvent and everything, it obviously unwound very aggressively. So I think that when you look at UST and the depegging, there's similarly a kind of leverage mechanism in that a lot of these senior edge or algorithmic or partially collateralized stablecoin designs, they do have an element of like a confidence game that's kind of a game theoretical prisoner's dilemma a little bit, where if we can sort of all agree to play the game a certain way. It's a stable system, but, you know, you have these outside factors that can cause people to sort of start to question that equilibrium and, like, sort of run for the door. And it's kind of a bank run situation.
00:14:47.934 - 00:15:49.854, Speaker B: And because it's only partially collateralized, there isn't like a base there in the same way that these fully collateralized projects have that kind of full collateral base. And so that on the way up, you see a lot of positive feedback loops driving the price up. And that leads to larger Ust issuance. That leads to more people speculating on the underlying Luna. That leads to more and more ability to pay out returns in anchor. It's all this positive feedback loop that just keeps working as long as the price is going up. But then once we see price drops, the unwind is as dramatic because you have these feedback loops and leverage hidden in the system, and you see that all unwind the other way.
00:15:49.854 - 00:16:51.484, Speaker B: So people want to run for the door with their UST, it causes the price of Luna to drop. It's just all the mechanisms that make it work make it break, too. And we saw similar unwinds that were pretty intense. When I was looking at revenue or protocol level earnings by Axie Infinity, I think top tick to bottom tick, it's dropped by like over 99%, which is pretty dramatic. But it's the way this works where if you put in this system where the price going up leads to all these people playing the game and mining, and then people buy the coin because the number of people playing the game is going up, you're kind of getting the causality wrong when you're betting that way. It's like buying bitcoin because the hashrate is going up. It's like it doesn't make sense.
00:16:51.484 - 00:17:10.294, Speaker B: And then when it goes the other way, people get, it gets unwound the other way. So not only is the price dropping, but all the players are logging off, too. And so that makes people want to sell and the price is dropping more players log off more. It's like this reflexive relationship.
00:17:10.874 - 00:17:33.098, Speaker C: Olaf, maybe this is where we can kind of get into the weeds a little bit on just this whole situation that's going on with Luna and UsT. So you're kind of just talking about these systems that have virtuous cycles on the way up, and then maybe the opposite occur on the way down. Can you just walk? Folks who might not be familiar with what exactly is the relationship like? What is ust? What's the relationship with Luna and what happened right now. Why have we seen de pegging?
00:17:33.186 - 00:18:19.594, Speaker B: Yep. So, okay, so it's sort of a complex system, but it's useful to just understand the theory behind different stablecoin mechanisms. There's kind of three, I would say, broad based categories of stable coins. One is where there's collateral, but the collateral is not on the blockchain. So this is like USDC, this is tether. This is where the collateral is held by some central entity off the system. And then you can redeem the stablecoin that's on the blockchain for cash that's just in a bank account off the blockchain.
00:18:19.594 - 00:18:58.042, Speaker B: Those systems are relatively simple conceptually. The problem is, of course, that there's a central entity that controls all that collateral. The second type is where the collateral is actually held on the blockchain. This is what the maker dao system does. So it's fully collateralized stablecoin, but all the collateral can be visualized and seen on the blockchain, and it's not controlled by a central entity. So it's decentralized in the sense that there's not one single entity that in theory could freeze the collateral or seize the collateral or something like that. But it's a trickier system to reason about.
00:18:58.042 - 00:20:07.544, Speaker B: It's just a little bit more complex, and it's harder to build, it's harder to scale, but it's a lot more resilient than the first type. Then there's a third type that people generally refer to as seniorage or algorithmic stablecoins. And this is where the peg is backed up. So there's the stablecoin itself, and then there's a secondary asset that sort of represents like an interest in the stablecoin system, sort of. And it kind of acts as collateral of last resort for that stablecoin. It's important for the market cap of that collateral to stay above the market cap of the stablecoin. And the idea here is you can always redeem the stablecoin for $1 worth of the underlying, and you can redeem the underlying for $1 of the stablecoin.
00:20:07.544 - 00:21:14.644, Speaker B: And so in that way, if the stablecoin ever goes above a dollar or below a dollar, you have arbitrageurs that do this collateral exchange and can make a profit. And the further it goes off peg, the larger those arbitrageurs stand to earn. So if it goes off the peg by 1%, an arbitrager can earn 1%. If it goes off by 99%. An arbitrageur, in theory, if it gets back to the peg, stands to make a 100 x return, right? So you kind of increase reward as the peg becomes undone, and you're increasing risk, in a sense, for the arbitrageurs. What's tricky about this system, and in the case of terra luna, is that the collateral is highly correlated with the, you know, success of the stablecoin. So in the case of a system like Makerdao, Dai has lots of different collateral assets.
00:21:14.644 - 00:22:29.004, Speaker B: They're all crypto, so they're all broadly correlated on some level, but they're not, you know, it doesn't have MKR, like the maker token, as the collateral in the system, you know. So one way to view Terra Luna is it's sort of like the Luna token really only exists in a way to act as collateral or senior Ed shares, whatever you want to call it, for that UST stablecoin. So what we found out here is that the problem is that when those two assets are correlated, as the pay gets undone, people lose faith in the system. And so the price of Luna drops. And as the price of luna drops, it becomes harder and harder to use that collateral to restore the peg. And it's like a confidence loop. So, you know, it's it because the two assets are correlated and you really depend on, you know, Luna retaining value in order for UST to be sort of backed or collateralized.
00:22:29.004 - 00:23:28.080, Speaker B: You just see this feedback loop, whereas people lose confidence in one, they lose confidence in the other. And so if these two things were sort of uncorrelated, it might have a better chance of working. In this case, there's not enough Luna, in a sense, to redeem for UST. And then in that case, the UST isn't really backed. Now, on top of all this mechanism I'm talking about, which is sort of the algorithmic stablecoin mechanism, there's also a foundation collecting tens of thousands of bitcoin to back the system. So it's partially algorithmic and partially offline collateralized, sort of in a USDC or tether style capacity. But the problem is that that offline collateral wasn't.
00:23:28.080 - 00:24:10.744, Speaker B: I mean, I don't think it is significant enough here to backstop the entire system. So you have this kind of partial collateralization, and then you have this algorithmic backing, but neither of them is sort of big enough here. So, I mean, it's. And just to timestamp this, I mean, it's May 11 in the morning, so this is very much like, happening right now. I don't want to talk like it's 100% done, but it does feel like these unwind has these kind of irreversible confidence game effects at play.
00:24:11.364 - 00:24:58.124, Speaker C: So just to ask the question, then, maybe a little bit of a two parter. But for Luna Terra, do you see that confidence ever getting restored in this particular stablecoin? And the follow up to that is you kind of have these voices coming out in Twitter. And to be fair, people did say this for a long time. People have actually been making this argument, even before Terra Luna, when there was basis back in 2018 or whatever, that a senior edge model is simply impossible. We're not solving a technical problem, you're solving a collective behavior problem. It's just the senior edge model just doesn't work. So my question to you is, a, is this kind of curtains for terra Luna? And then B, on a higher level, do you think that the seniorage model for a stablecoin can work, or is it just a flawed design from the start?
00:24:59.224 - 00:26:01.436, Speaker B: I've always been fascinated by this category. I was a seed investor in basis, which you mentioned, and I was a seed investor in Terra as well, way back in 2018. So I've always been fascinated by the concept, but I think empirically, it doesn't look like it's working. So I don't have a strong stance on in theory. Could it ever work? To your question of this particular project, I don't think that it can work. I mean, Terra is down 99% in value from the peak to now, and so I think it's too much. I don't know.
00:26:01.436 - 00:26:22.202, Speaker B: Like I said, there's these confidence feedback loops that kind of either take it back up or it kind of unwinds all the way. And it's maybe not completely, completely over, but I think we can effectively say the unwind is done.
00:26:22.338 - 00:26:37.660, Speaker A: Olaf, does this unwind make you lose faith in decentralized algo stables as a concept, or do you just kind of think, okay, next up, we have fracs, and maybe frax works, but if fracs doesn't work, we have another thing. And then there's another thing.
00:26:37.812 - 00:26:50.704, Speaker B: I mean, I'm fascinated by the concept for sure. In a way, maybe the US dollar is like the ultimate, I'll go stable. That hasn't collapsed yet.
00:26:53.764 - 00:27:03.852, Speaker A: And maybe that's because the US dollars doesn't have to be tied to anything. And just pegging something to something else is a really, really hard, maybe even impossible idea.
00:27:03.908 - 00:27:33.184, Speaker B: But then you get into this, like, if we're going to just create assets that aren't pegged and are speculative. Why? Like, have backing at all, which is, you know, bitcoin and ethereum, they're not, like, backed by some other asset. And it's in a way, sort of ironic that it's safer to create an asset that is, you know, backed by nothing than an asset that's like, sort of backed.
00:27:34.324 - 00:27:42.564, Speaker A: It's kind of like nfts. It's like when NFTs have no utility, it's just about the art. But when there's utility, it's like, well, how. What is this thing actually giving me? You know?
00:27:42.604 - 00:28:02.224, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, it's kind of weird. But empirically, in crypto, it's been more effective to create a thing that is not tied to any other value, has no collateral, has no revenue, etcetera. That's been sort of the safer approach.
00:28:02.524 - 00:28:05.372, Speaker A: So if you can't create decentralized stables.
00:28:05.508 - 00:29:42.434, Speaker B: Well, algo stables, makerdao is functioning as fully collateralized. And I think that approach really the question there is how many different types of collateral can we use as backing? So a big experiment that will happen over time is, can we include lots and lots and lots of different on chain assets as collateral? And then the big experiment is, can we include off chain assets as collateral for a makerdao style system? So, like, if makerdao included, like, a factory or real estate or some tangible asset that's kind of not endogenous to the blockchain, can we have that as backing in a maker dao style system? And you run into some really complex stuff with who represents that Dao? And if that collateral goes bad, like, how is it legally seized and liquidated and everything? And it gets very tricky because you can't just write a smart contract to do all that stuff. So I think we haven't yet seen where the edges or the limit are with that collateralized model either. But I think it's pretty clear to me at this point that on chain collateral, in theory, should work, and I think it has worked so far. I think the main question is, what kind of scale can we get?
00:29:42.894 - 00:30:33.672, Speaker C: Well, maybe just to wrap this part up, then I want to move into stuff you're excited about and ask you some questions about the future of crypto. But one thing that I think a lot of folks are asking is if we're officially drawing the comparison between right now, the current time, 2022 and 2017 and 2014 and 2013 and 2011. There were some pretty vicious, there was a pretty vicious bear market of about two years where things were pretty bleak. So I guess my open question to you here is, do you see this time as being similar? Is your base case that we head into something that looks like a two year bear market because of something like permanent capital, or because we're just much further along and much more developed than we were in the past? Do you see it being maybe more moderate? I'm just curious how you think about the next twelve to 18 months.
00:30:33.728 - 00:31:19.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't have a strong view on how long it lasts, but I mean, we're in the bear market. It's not like a forward looking thing at this point. I do think also that crypto got big enough that it's tied to global macro now. And we obviously saw tech stocks and all this kind of growth, private equity crash. You can see that playing out in crypto. I mean, the last private round of Opensea is equivalent to the liquid public market cap of Coinbase. Like the last private round of FTX was like double the liquid market cap of Coinbase.
00:31:19.220 - 00:32:07.644, Speaker B: I think I'm excited about those businesses, but I do think that's a little crazy, right, to think about relative valuation. So I think that we're going to feel it in crypto as well, just like that bigger macro backdrop. But it's interesting because all the previous cycles in crypto, nobody was talking about interest rates for the stock market. It didn't matter. And it's because crypto was such a petri dish, it was so small that these outside factors never mattered. Now, I think there is, it's just big enough that capital markets in general affect crypto. But I think I don't have a strong view on how long this lasts.
00:32:07.644 - 00:33:05.866, Speaker B: It's more so up to the entrepreneurs and builders in crypto to continue to develop useful applications that people want to use. I mean, it's in my mind, like, the scariest bear market still for me was for sure the 20 1415. And it's because it was just really unclear, like, what the path forward was. There just wasn't that much happening. And we were trying to figure out use cases for bitcoin outside of trading and speculation, which is, of course, a very useful use case, but it's sort of maybe not for everyone. I remember having these meetings in 2015, trying to figure out what was going to happen and nobody having very good ideas. And then Ethereum, like enterprise blockchain.
00:33:05.930 - 00:33:06.346, Speaker A: Olaf.
00:33:06.410 - 00:33:22.784, Speaker B: Oh, man. Yeah. I mean, whenever you see enterprise blockchain come back, that's when you know you're in the bear market and it's like, oh, we don't like crypto tokens. We just like blockchain. It's like, oh, okay. Now it's probably the accumulation phase, right?
00:33:23.604 - 00:33:24.124, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:24.204 - 00:33:28.956, Speaker B: So it is interesting. I mean, I swear we will see it. Trust me, we will see.
00:33:29.100 - 00:33:54.458, Speaker A: Well, we actually had some. Yeah, yeah. We had some guests on the show the other day that thought, who I really like, by the way, but one of their predictions is that every company will end up taking their. Every SaaS company will end up taking their API and turning it into their own L2, basically, and having these private l two s, like forked l two s, which kind of feels like an extension of the enterprise blockchain thesis, exotic prediction.
00:33:54.626 - 00:34:58.904, Speaker B: We'll see how it plays out. So I think broadly, to me, like, the launch of Ethereum in 2015 and then the ensuing stuff that started getting built there really built us out of that bear market. Right. And I think that DeFi and smart contracts on Ethereum sort of built us out of the 2018 bear market. And so I think that's really the next step, is like, we need to always support our entrepreneurs that really are the core of everything in crypto that are taking on these radical experiments, most of which will fail, but some of which will succeed, and we need to build our way out. That's how this has always worked to me. And also, in my opinion, Coinbase built us out of the 2012 bear market.
00:34:58.904 - 00:35:27.290, Speaker B: It sort of added this new ability to get capital into the system that didn't exist before. It was super hard to buy bitcoin before Coinbase. Now it's easy with so many different platforms, but at the time, it was like a nightmare to buy bitcoin. And if you wanted to buy $100,000 of bitcoin, it was impossible. It was very, very hard and very scary, sort of. So now, you know, we just have to build our way out. That's how it's always been.
00:35:27.402 - 00:35:49.426, Speaker A: Yeah. Olaf, does it make you. So, the other day, Richard from Numerai posted this thing on Twitter saying that he's out of ethereum. He got in the sale. He got it at now at $2,500. He's selling all of his ethereum. And the reason, if you watch the video, I don't know if you did, but he said, now crypto is just tied to global macro, and that makes it much, much, much less interesting to him.
00:35:49.426 - 00:35:58.810, Speaker A: And I know you mentioned that's one of your things now, is, for the first time ever, crypto's tied to global macro. Does that make crypto, just as an asset class, less interesting? To you?
00:35:58.922 - 00:36:26.072, Speaker B: Well, it's, you know, I think part of the subtext, and Richard's a good friend of mine, and I really respect his thinking. I think one of the subtexts, though, was like, I'm up 1000 x. I probably am not going to go up another 1000 x in the next five years. Like, I. Yeah, he did all, which I think is our. What he's actually. He was actually up 10,000 x, I guess.
00:36:26.072 - 00:36:57.274, Speaker B: 10,000 x, yeah, he's up 10,000 x in five years or seven years, I guess. And I do think there was some subtext that was like, okay, I don't think that back return profile is gonna carry on into the future. And I think that's perfectly appropriate for. To say. Right. Like, I, you know, I don't think Ethereum will 10,000 x over, like, the next, you know, that would be like all the capital in the world. So I think, you know, that was, I think some of the subtext.
00:36:57.274 - 00:37:50.854, Speaker B: I do think there's more correlation to global macro, but I think it is asymmetric on the upside, for sure. Like, I just don't think you can invest in the s and P 500 and get the type of upside you get in crypto at all. Like, even over the next three to five years, I still think crypto is, relatively speaking, small, misunderstood, and by many considered still like a scam or used for illicit activities. It's all the same counter narratives that we've dealt with for a decade. But I think that the asymmetric returns on the upside are significant compared to other asset classes, even if they're somewhat correlated.
00:37:52.274 - 00:38:13.386, Speaker A: We interrupt your programming with a special announcement. Empire has a new sponsor. Santi and I are very excited to welcome Bitmex. That is right, Bitmex is back. The exchange we all know and love is back and better than ever. We're going to be dropping a couple updates on Bitmex over the next couple of months. This first one is a big one coming soon.
00:38:13.386 - 00:38:45.628, Speaker A: Bitmex is rolling out their spot exchange and they're giving away $500,000 in bitcoin to new users. That's right, listening to Empire has got the alpha Santiago, and I got you $500,000 in bitcoin going to new users for the ogs. I don't think I need to tell you why you need to use Bitmax. It's a love of the game kind of thing. You respect crypto, you use Bitmex. For those newer to the industry, Bitmex has a long and great history of innovation. Since their launch in 2014, they created perps and a whole lot more.
00:38:45.628 - 00:39:05.348, Speaker A: Now they're back, they're better than ever. They're making waves. So what do you need to do? Go sign up for the Bitmex spot. Exchange for a chance to win some of the $500,000 in bitcoin that Bitmex is giving away. Bitmexbitmex.com. That's bitmex.com. Go make it happen.
00:39:05.348 - 00:39:07.424, Speaker A: Now. Let's get back to the show.
00:39:08.204 - 00:39:39.630, Speaker C: I'd be curious to get your perspective as well. Obviously, history rhymes, but it's not the exact same, or it doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. So there are some pretty legitimate, at least from my jason and I came in in 2017. We also marked the top. We co founded Blockworks, I think within a month of the all time high, and then watched it fall for two months after, or two years after. But back then, I remember people were kind of questioning, maybe it's this idea that maybe bitcoin is the only. That's the only legitimate thing.
00:39:39.630 - 00:40:28.962, Speaker C: So it sounds like in 2014, 2015, people were like, is bitcoin even going to work? Or what else is kind of the way forward? And in the 2017 2018 bear market, it was like, all right, bitcoin and probably ethereum. And what it feels like now, right, is, okay, some of these scam projects weren't going to work, but it feels like bitcoin and ethereum are very kind of solidly encased. It seems like people generally believe in a multi chain future. And while there was definitely a lot of hype and speculation around nfts and daos, and I want to get your thoughts on governance versus tokenomics kind of going forward and just value accrual. But what feels different this time, potentially going into the bear market, do you think these ideas are enshrined and definitely going to work? Do you feel like. Yeah, I guess. What do you feel like is different coming out of this one versus previous bear markets?
00:40:29.138 - 00:41:24.384, Speaker B: It's mostly that the sheer magnitude of experiments being run right now is it's massive, it's unfalterable, and the number of obscure startups that raised a few million dollars over the past 18 months is crazy. So I just think that the capital available, if you find something that it hits is pretty insane. In crypto, like if you have a project and it actually has product market fit and it's actually growing and stuff. In crypto, when it works, it tends to grow really fast. The amount of capital available to fuel that is is pretty unfathomable. And just the number of fringe experiments being run is massive. It's way bigger than it was in, say, 2018.
00:41:24.384 - 00:42:18.824, Speaker B: I think in 2018, I could still keep track of basically every individual project in crypto. It was hard, but I was obviously doing this on a full time plus capacity, but I could basically keep track of every single thing that was happening. That is completely impossible now. I am lucky if I keep track of 10% of the total quantity of what's happening. I just think that the entrepreneurial laboratory is bigger here than I wasn't around in nineties, early two thousands Internet. As an investor, I think it's gotta be one of the biggest entrepreneurial laboratories in history, if not the biggest. So I just have a lot of confidence that smart people, out of that burbling chaos, will build amazing things.
00:42:18.824 - 00:42:59.974, Speaker B: But you sort of have to have that faith. I mean, stuff like Ethereum especially really came out of nowhere. Right. You know, there had been these previous attempts to build what were basically smart contracts or more complex logic into blockchain systems, and Ethereum just, you know, it worked, and it kind of saved the whole industry in a weird way. At least that's my perspective on it. So I, you know, I think that I've continually been impressed by the ability for our entrepreneurs to build, like, incredible new things in crypto.
00:43:00.314 - 00:43:16.978, Speaker A: Yeah. Before. Just one last question before getting into kind of. I know Mike wants to get into just multichain future and where value accrues, but one last question is it still feels like maybe we haven't felt Max pain. I know we are in the bear market right now, and we're six. Probably six months into it. Probably little ways to go.
00:43:16.978 - 00:43:45.052, Speaker A: But in 2020, even with BitConnect and the slow drudge down in 2018, 2019, Max Payne really wasn't felt until March of 2020. So when you look to start buying and accumulating things that you really like and backing entrepreneurs that you really want to back in the liquid markets, what signals are you looking for, Olaf? Like, are you starting? Are you seeing the markets right now? And you're like, boom, great, huge buying opportunity. Are you like, no, no, no. Like, this is not Max Payne yet.
00:43:45.188 - 00:43:59.874, Speaker B: No, huge buying opportunity. I mean, I don't know when Max Payne is, but there's, you know, I don't need Max pain. You know, I can just take regular pain. Regular pain.
00:44:00.414 - 00:44:01.382, Speaker C: Regular pain.
00:44:01.518 - 00:44:09.494, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it's. Yeah, it's. I think, like, now begins, obviously, the era of buying, not selling.
00:44:09.614 - 00:44:48.330, Speaker C: Nice. All right, I've got a couple questions for you? Just about. You know, I think the driving narrative, if you had to ascribe one to 2021, was kind of this competition that was occurring on the layer one sort of smart contract layer, and yet a bunch of different kind of viable. I mean, some people get offended if I say, but viable competitors to ethereum sort of emerge for the first time ever that had some pretty different trade offs. So there's kind of the solanas, which have their own kind of ecosystem. Then there are EVM compatible smart chain or smart contract chains, like the avalanches of the world in general. Um, I guess like at a, at a really high level.
00:44:48.330 - 00:45:09.454, Speaker C: It's like such a simple question to ask, but like, how do you see those kind of smart contract wars kind of playing out? Like, how do they compete with each other? And then another question is, do you think we've seen the ones that are gonna win? Like, is it gonna be some combination of maybe, like, Ethereum, Solana, whatever? Or do you see new competitors potentially coming out of the woodshed that don't even exist yet?
00:45:09.994 - 00:45:46.652, Speaker B: Yeah, so I don't see it as like a zero sum game. I really think that different platforms will lend themselves to different types of applications. I think we've already seen that with Ethereum and bitcoin. A lot of people thought that was going to be sort of a war. What we've really seen is them coexist with alternate use cases. And there's the fact that there's these irreconcilable trade offs. The fact that Ethereum even has defi causes it to be.
00:45:46.652 - 00:46:22.024, Speaker B: It's harder to reason about core protocol matters. So you get things on Ethereum like miner extractable value, and you get things in Ethereum 2.0, like defi yields, competing with proof of stake yields. It's hard to reason about, it makes it complicated. So that, you know, the simplicity of bitcoin, or reasoning about bitcoin is kind of nice. What I mean to say is, it's not that Ethereum is a superset of bitcoin. It's an alternative project that has its own value proposition separate from bitcoin.
00:46:22.024 - 00:47:08.598, Speaker B: To me, it's not like a zero sum competition. I similarly, I view a lot of these new blockchains alternate, relatively speaking newer, that are alternatives to Ethereum. Similarly, I don't think that this is like them versus Ethereum. I just think there's alternate architectures that make trade offs, and you get different types of applications or use cases or users that like those trade offs. So, you know, if you care more about cost than security. Like there's a lot of easy trade offs for you that are alternatives to Ethereum, where Ethereum, you know, is expensive to use. And so I think that this experiment is going to last for many years.
00:47:08.598 - 00:47:50.784, Speaker B: I don't think it's over at all. I think stuff like optimistic roll ups and the whole kind of L2 system ecosystem on Ethereum we still really haven't seen emerge in a really big way. And I think we will see that. I think we're going to see more and more of these bridging protocols. So you're going to be able to build multi blockchain applications, move assets across blockchains. I think it's all getting more complex, not less. And I think there's going to be both existing projects that stand the test of time, and there's going to be new projects that none of us have ever heard of that emerge.
00:47:50.784 - 00:48:03.710, Speaker B: I know that's a hand wavy answer, but I don't think there's any clarity at this point. I think it's complicated and I think it's still happening.
00:48:03.742 - 00:48:30.914, Speaker C: Very much so in the future, maybe focusing in on Ethereum scaling roadmap in general, is the future that you envision. There are successfully these L2 protocols that get rolled out. And in the future when apps launch, they'll launch onto the L2 s. And the reason I'm asking that question is like when bored Ape Yacht Club did their land sale, I'm blanking on the name of whatever their metaverse land sale.
00:48:31.774 - 00:48:32.554, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:48:33.254 - 00:48:54.444, Speaker C: That caused an enormous amount of congestion on the Ethereum main chain. And then basically they said they're going to come out and create their own chain. So I guess my question to you is, when you see new projects in the future, are they going to be launching on L2s? Are they going to be creating their own chains? Or is it going to be some combination of the two of those things?
00:48:54.564 - 00:50:14.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you're an ethereum app developer and we get substantial users onto, for example, Arbitrum, why would you launch on the base chain instead of arbitrum? You really should just probably launch an arbitrum. So I think, yeah, you're going to see app developers migrate to L2 systems for sure. I also think that the applications that get big enough will in certain cases want to build their own sovereign chain. I don't think it's every application, because composability is very, very important in crypto. If you had flash loans, just as a basic example, on its own chain, it would sort of render it useless. The point of a flash loan is to use the flash loan to go interact with another application. You can't silo out every single app, but I think in certain cases you are going to see this migration from smart contract system to sovereign chain with its own logic.
00:50:14.904 - 00:50:27.544, Speaker B: I think it's not super clear what class of applications that will be, but I do think you will see it happen and I think it can make sense in a lot of cases.
00:50:29.684 - 00:50:59.262, Speaker C: Do you see for some of these L2s, even the ones that have been traditionally extremely associated with Ethereum like optimism or arbitrum? Eventually, I guess if these other layer ones like the Solanas and avalanches are successful, then their block space will fill up and they'll also need to go to a L2 on top of that. Do you think that there's a chance that some of these projects that people traditionally identify as extensions of Ethereum almost? Do you see a world where they will actually integrate with other layer ones?
00:50:59.438 - 00:52:56.560, Speaker B: Yeah, where L2 systems move across layer ones? Yeah, I've always, you know, I've kind of always said, I think L2s are basically a mechanism to launch a new layer one, but with really good ux, right? Yeah, that's like broad based my view on it because, you know, you just really, really tightly integrate to an existing l one, in this case Ethereum. But then over time, you have your own app developer ecosystem of people deploying there, and then you start to think, well, wait a second, couldn't we add similar security to an alternative blockchain that's EVM compatible, like an avalanche or something? And then all of a sudden it starts to feel like, wait a second, what's the difference between this and just a chain that has a bunch of bridges to it? I think they're all likely to launch their own token. And there you go. I just think that it's interesting to me, in the Ethereum ecosystem, there's a certain subset of people that are very much rooting against alternative layer one systems like say Solana or avalanche or our binance chain, but they are rooting for optimistic roll up systems and L2s and sort of view those as friendly to Ethereum. I think that's the wrong framing. These L2 systems are just really, really tightly integrated to Ethereum in order to better extract assets. And I don't view it, to use the word extract is like pretty intense, but it really is just really, really good.
00:52:56.560 - 00:53:35.064, Speaker B: Bridge ux to better pull over application developers. The light mode is like avalanche EVM compatibility. So it's really easy to build bridges, really easy to integrate into existing UX systems like metamask, et cetera. And then that's like light mode, and then heavy mode is like we're literally inside Ethereum, you know what I mean? And so, yeah, I think these optimistic roll up systems will be very successful. And I think that people often think about they become sovereign chains. I think that's long term what's going to happen.
00:53:36.124 - 00:53:55.556, Speaker A: So let's extrapolate this out a couple of years. So let's say all these optimists, the roll ups end up working, and let's say some of the other l one s like the nears and the avalanches and the Solanas end up working too. How do you think about as an investor, how do you think about allocating capital into that kind of world and thinking about really like, where the value in this world accrues?
00:53:55.700 - 00:55:16.250, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that in the past, in crypto, it's been relatively easy to say, I am just going to speculate on the coin that has users. So wherever the users go and the application developers go, I'll just buy that coin. The problem is that a lot of times there isn't necessarily a value accrual mechanism based on the number of users or application developers or transactions, as in, there is no real reason per se that that should drive value to the coin, other than an expectation that other people are thinking like you and speculating on the value. So now though, you see this world, you know, post EIP 1559 in ethereum, where more transactions, more smart contract activity, actually burns ether. I think that is a critical turning point for thinking about value accrual in these systems. I think it's going to be necessary to have that sort of system, a real burn type system embedded inside all of these chains, and then that will become much more heavily impactful on how to think about value over the long term.
00:55:16.250 - 00:55:53.084, Speaker B: I think that it will become less about speculation and more about those kind of like real value accrual mechanisms, this more mechanistic value accrual to the underlying asset. So I think the systems that do upgrades like that or incorporate that into their architecture are on track. I think you need to be now, as a layer one developer, you need to be thinking about how do we drive demand based on transactional volume inside my system?
00:55:54.024 - 00:56:53.802, Speaker C: Yeah, it's just interesting. How do you think about, let's say, the relative amount of economic activity that occurs between a L2 and a layer one? Let's say, a relatively simplistic world of where there's one L2 on Ethereum, and then there's Ethereum itself and the vast majority of economic activity per se, because just so much transactions are so much cheaper on the l two, all of the apps and users kind of live in and use that ecosystem. But ultimately, it's still very dependent on Ethereum, the main chain. Right? Because all those transactions settle to that chain. So how would you think about. Maybe you just answered this and I just didn't understand it, but how would you think about the relative value then of a token, the L2 token versus the ETH token? And does it have less to do with the amount of relative economic activity that's occurring at each layer versus some of that value accrual mechanism that you were talking about, like the relative supply of the assets and the kind of burn thing?
00:56:53.898 - 00:57:45.798, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I. It's complicated because I still think we're mostly in the paradigm of speculation rather than mechanistic value accrual, if you want to divide it that way. And I think we're dramatically still in that paradigm, as in it's probably 95% not mechanistic value accrual in the way the average person is thinking about these assets. But as it does get more complex in that there's lots of platforms. Assets move across platforms. You can use bitcoin in defi, etcetera. I think it gets more complicated, and more and more people, over time, especially institutionals, are going to more and more start to think about that mechanistic value accrual.
00:57:45.798 - 00:57:49.234, Speaker B: I do think that's the way this goes longer term, but we're not there yet.
00:57:50.034 - 00:58:13.610, Speaker A: Olaf. It feels like all eyes, most guests who come on the show end up saying two things that they're looking at are like roll ups and l two s. Maybe three things are roll ups and l two s and then other l one s, and expansion of different ecosystems and bridges. What do you think is kind of the most underlooked thing where it kind of boggles your mind that other folks aren't talking about XYz more?
00:58:13.802 - 00:58:23.072, Speaker B: Yeah, now there's so many people talking about so much stuff in crypto, it feels like everything is covered, you know?
00:58:23.128 - 00:58:25.256, Speaker A: Do you, do you miss the early days?
00:58:25.280 - 00:59:44.004, Speaker B: Olaf well, are you reminiscent ever simpler times, for sure. It's like once a week, like a new project dropped and you sort of read about it and then get back to work trying to scale Coinbase. But, yeah, I think it was easier. It was easier for sure. You know, I just think I really like these kind of more exotic experiments always where it's just sort of us unproven. So a couple categories that I think are just interesting, and I don't see people talking about, you know, there's this concept of, like, could we use a proof mechanism, like proof of work, to do something else other than validation of transactions in the system? So, for example, could we use that proof system to train a machine learning algorithm where all of the miners are doing this sort of useful work towards training a machine learning algorithm? There's one project doing that that I think is pretty fascinating. And it's just like a new category, right? Unproven, but it's fascinating if it did work.
00:59:44.004 - 01:00:52.998, Speaker B: As the coin price of that system goes up, you get a stronger and stronger and stronger AI, basically, which is very cool. The second, another category that comes to mind is this concept of a digital creator. So if you're familiar with Lil Mikaela, there's this. It's like she's an Instagram star, but she's completely digital. Like, there's no real person there. Or you could think of like the band gorillas, right, where like, it's all kind of animated and digital, thinking about, like, how could you have that be a Dao ownership structure? So when you look at, you know, meet space stars like a Kanye west, you can't like, buy shares or ownership units of Kanye west, right. However, with like, a little Mikayla, you really could, like, you could really have a dao that, like, owns that, you know, digital asset, and then little Mikhaila could release music or release nfts or like, do things.
01:00:52.998 - 01:01:08.682, Speaker B: And one of the nice things about that is they can perform in like 100 cities every night of the year, right? Or they can. They never go to sleep. They never, like, slap somebody at the Oscars or like, yeah, Olaf, can I.
01:01:08.698 - 01:01:16.170, Speaker A: Actually push back on that one idea for a second? Which is really what you're talking about is kind of like social tokens, like the ability to get upside in a creator, essentially.
01:01:16.202 - 01:01:45.744, Speaker B: I would say this is different because the creator is a fake person. So it's like, I think that there's problem. I think the main problem with social token, the idea that I'm going to fund my college by selling 10% of my future earnings, that's the classic social token experiment. I just think you run into some pretty dicey area there. I think it's obvious the ways that could go wrong or feel weird.
01:01:47.964 - 01:02:04.744, Speaker A: Any token or anything that gets traded on a marketplace eventually be able to go short on that thing. And what happens if I. A lot of people are buying Olaf tokens. Well, I just loaded up on a short position on Olaf, and now I'm pretty incentivized to see you fail. That gets pretty ugly pretty quickly, I guess. I see what.
01:02:04.784 - 01:02:57.764, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Like, you don't want to accidentally make markets, prediction markets, right. Where you're incentivized to actually influence the outcome. But, yeah, I think that, you know, in the case of like a lomikayla, say it's cool because you really can distribute ownership and build a community around that, those digital assets without any of those weird ethical problems, basically, that come from, like, selling shares of a person or something like that. I like, that's just another experiment that comes to mind. There's stuff like this happening where it's small today, but if one of these things works, maybe it's very big tomorrow.
01:02:58.144 - 01:03:14.190, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of Daos, Olaf, I've obviously heard you on a bunch of different shows and podcasts, just talking. It seems like you're quite optimistic about where daos go in the future. Could you ever turn your fund, the entire firm, into a DAo? Is that something that's on the roadmap?
01:03:14.382 - 01:03:56.514, Speaker B: You know, I think that would be pretty cool if it weren't for. If it weren't for, like, laws and regulation around that. So, yeah, conceptually, I think Daos, in my mind, they really only need to get one thing right, which is capital allocation and the governance process around that capital allocation. So I do think DAos are sort of like limited partners in funds. Like, they should be investing in managers. They should be investing in startups. I don't think they should actually be doing anything, as in operating.
01:03:56.514 - 01:04:02.740, Speaker B: I think all they should be doing is allocating capital and perfecting the governance process to allocate that capital.
01:04:02.842 - 01:04:05.604, Speaker A: You're saying. You're saying all dows or venture dows.
01:04:05.904 - 01:04:08.696, Speaker B: I mean, like, all daos, all dows.
01:04:08.720 - 01:04:10.232, Speaker A: Should just be allocating capital.
01:04:10.328 - 01:04:17.216, Speaker B: Well, and I'm talking about dows that are at scale. If you want to build, like, a little neighborhood dow, that's like a different.
01:04:17.400 - 01:04:22.208, Speaker A: But, like, like, what maker has set up, basically, where they allocate capital to different teams.
01:04:22.256 - 01:04:52.636, Speaker B: Yeah, like, or, like, you know, these daos that have really collected, like, hundreds of millions of dollars from sponsoring deFi protocols, I don't think that they should. The level of Zoom on Daos right now is, like, way too zoomed in. Way too zoomed in opinion. So, like, you get these votes on, like, an individual developer salary, you know, that is insane. It's like going to the board of a company, a publicly traded company board, to say, like, what should this one engineer get paid?
01:04:52.740 - 01:05:14.334, Speaker A: Mike and I were reading the forum for I forget which doubt it was, but it was, oh, my God. They were voting on something that happened at the off site. They were like, should we spend a day at the lake at our company, at our off site? And there were like twelve people at the off site. And you had like 200 people voting on this thing. And people are like, why are people spending time at a lake at the off site? And I was like, oh, my God, this is a nightmare.
01:05:14.414 - 01:05:54.924, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it just, it's like all the DAO should do is allocate capital. Like, I think the Dow needs to be separated from the startup, so to speak. I think the startup should just be like CEO, entrepreneur, top down decision making, execution, etcetera. And the DAO is just the capital provider that gets to decide if that entrepreneur is executing or not or has a good strategy or not. I think that if you can reduce daos to capital allocation, I think they can be highly, highly effective. I think a lot of the problems with daos is they're trying to do stuff instead of just allocate capital today.
01:05:55.084 - 01:06:13.404, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think that a lot of the companies like, okay, so you spend a lot of time at Coinbase. When I look at Coinbase right now, I actually have multiple questions about Coinbase. But Coinbase goes up against someone like Uniswap. I'm going to make these numbers up, but Coinbase has something like 4000 or 5000 employees. Uniswap has like 50 employees. And again, super rough numbers.
01:06:13.404 - 01:06:26.294, Speaker A: Does someone like, can a centralized company like one of these, quote unquote, c five companies, like a blockfi versus an Aave or Coinbase versus Uniswap over time? Can the c five companies compete with some of these daos?
01:06:26.674 - 01:06:53.034, Speaker B: No, I think that the Defi systems win in the end. However, defi systems cannot integrate with traditional banks. So the bridges will always be owned. And by bridge, I mean fiat to crypto bridge. The fiat to crypto bridge will always be owned by centralized exchanges. You have to have a centralized exchange. There's no other way.
01:06:53.034 - 01:07:15.314, Speaker B: However, the order books, I think long term are won by Defi. It's like if you just want to trade crypto for crypto, that long term is going to be defi. But if you want to exchange $100 in your bank account for crypto, that's always going to be a Coinbase like business.
01:07:15.654 - 01:07:17.782, Speaker A: Olaf, are you still close with Brian?
01:07:17.958 - 01:07:18.718, Speaker B: Yes.
01:07:18.886 - 01:07:34.918, Speaker A: Gotta empathize for the guy right now. I was telling Mike, I was like, man, it would suck to be the CEO of a public company. I was like, he's got this great business. I love Coinbase. I use Coinbase all the time. I'm like, man, God, it sucked to be a CEO of a public company. I don't know if you've talked to him about that.
01:07:35.086 - 01:07:40.518, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, I think it's just.
01:07:40.646 - 01:07:44.390, Speaker C: Did he have hair before starting Coinbase? Basically, that's what I'm asking.
01:07:44.462 - 01:08:26.314, Speaker B: No, he's always at the same. Same haircut, for sure. I think that it's just hard being the CEO of any company because its success or failures is kind of on your shoulders. I mean, Coinbase really went through the gauntlet in 20 1415. I mean, it was hard. It's just this thing where you're hiring people, you kind of have this great company concept, all these new product ideas, but, like, revenue was just dropping every month. It was just like, okay, fewer and fewer and fewer people using the system.
01:08:26.314 - 01:09:00.052, Speaker B: And you get to the point where you're like, wait a second. Are we suddenly rethinking product market fit? You know what I mean? Yeah, we figured it out and we're in this growth phase, you know what I mean? And that's very hard as a startup when you're in a cyclical industry, is like, what is growth of a real product market fit product? And what is, like, you sort of accidentally rode the macrowave a little bit, but you actually didn't have any product fit.
01:09:00.228 - 01:09:15.474, Speaker A: I remember reading one of Brian's pieces in 2017 when the servers were shutting down. And he's like, guys, you got to understand, like, 18 months ago, he's like, we were not prepared for this. And I will admit that because 18 months ago, we were, like, still trying to, like, run on the hamster wheel.
01:09:15.514 - 01:09:52.094, Speaker B: So, yeah, so I, you know, I think I'm just really sympathetic to everyone that's in, like, an entrepreneurial journey. I think that it's. I think it's kind of sad in a way that, you know, our societies, you know, most successful entrepreneurs are vilified. And I don't think anybody really comprehends how difficult it is to be an entrepreneur psychologically. You know, you really have everything riding on your shoulders. It all comes down to you. And, like, so many different people depend on you.
01:09:52.094 - 01:10:53.192, Speaker B: And, you know, at the end of the day, like, it's people who are very successful entrepreneurs, they bring up so many people with them, so many employees, so many investors. But the reverse is true as well. If it fails, you feel like you didn't just fail yourself, you failed everybody. So I just think it's very intense. And I have a lot of respect for people that can handle being an entrepreneur. And I think that as a society, it's probably time for us to re examine the way that we think about entrepreneurs, because somehow they became like bond villains, when in reality, I think they are very important to everything that is happening. And as I talked about with the entrepreneurial laboratory, that is like the tip of the spear for society on how we solve things.
01:10:53.192 - 01:11:03.256, Speaker B: Like, I really do believe in the entrepreneurial laboratory to solve problems that at really global scale and in the most serious categories.
01:11:03.440 - 01:11:06.480, Speaker A: I could not agree with you more, Olaf, on all of that.
01:11:06.552 - 01:11:44.402, Speaker C: Yeah, Olaf, maybe to close just like a high level, you kind of talked about real problems getting solved during bear markets. And that's been, I think, Jason, my experience, too. So what were a couple of the things, maybe it's like Dow governance, maybe it's this idea of yield farming and just giving out, essentially network equity for free. Right. To mercenaries, whatever it is. What are a couple of the things that you think really need to be fixed or got taken to extremes in the last bull market and then at a higher level, just having gone through crypto for as long as you have, there's so many overriding narratives. Right.
01:11:44.402 - 01:11:57.186, Speaker C: The democratization of finance, there's replacing of the reserve currency of the US. Where do you think, are there any of those narratives that you think are popularly accepted that you personally don't believe in? I'd be curious, like, where you land on some of those.
01:11:57.330 - 01:12:35.388, Speaker B: So, yeah, one like macro thing that I'm surprised more people haven't talked about is that in 2014, we had the sort of launch of altcoins that had some sort of pre mine mechanism. So some of the coins were held by the creator. In 2017, we had icos and this kind of crowdfunding phenomena. And in 2021, we got NFT mints. Okay. And the kind of financial mechanism underlying all three of those is identical. It's identical.
01:12:35.388 - 01:13:31.662, Speaker B: It's like the creator holds some coins, and then there's basically a crowdfunding event that pushes capital into the system. And the creator owns a portion from the beginning, and it's kind of different form factors. It was based chains, it was ICO projects and now and NFT mints. But I think that it's very tightly rhyming history. Right. And I do think, like, a lot of the confusion from new entrants in crypto is that just because something has this, like, cool financialization, it doesn't mean that there's anything underneath that. So a lot of the, you know, in the ICL wave, it was sort of like, you know, I'm doing the ICO because it's an ICO.
01:13:31.662 - 01:14:10.292, Speaker B: Like, icos are just a cool thing in general. So, like, you know, and then I feel like that happened with NFT mints. It was like, I'm just doing the mint because, like, holy shit, I heard about it on discord and like, you know, it's like, it's a mint. I have to do it. You know what I mean? So I like, I think that there's a lot of, like, you know, I think something I didn't like about this 2021 thing was this concept that, like, we're all going to make it. And it's sort of like, the problem is that it's like we're all going to make it no matter what. And the reality is it does.
01:14:10.292 - 01:14:57.114, Speaker B: The world's not that simple and you actually need to do useful things and create value for other people to make it. Like, you can't just like, ride this macrowave forever and it's not actually, like up only. And it shouldn't be like, we actually have to prove ourselves to the world. Like, as a crypto industry, it is our job to show the world that this is useful. We can't just, like, we almost can, but we can't just meme our way to the top. That's an important component of it because this is social technology. But we really do have to build useful stuff for people and make it work.
01:14:57.114 - 01:15:11.114, Speaker B: So I'm excited to get back to the era of just sort of like, actually what's being built. Not just everything goes up for no reason.
01:15:11.654 - 01:15:19.548, Speaker A: Olaf, this has been awesome. I appreciate it on such a crazy day and a crazy week. Really appreciate all the time. And this has been a fantastic conversation.
01:15:19.646 - 01:15:21.888, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
01:15:22.016 - 01:15:23.544, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. We'll see you later.
