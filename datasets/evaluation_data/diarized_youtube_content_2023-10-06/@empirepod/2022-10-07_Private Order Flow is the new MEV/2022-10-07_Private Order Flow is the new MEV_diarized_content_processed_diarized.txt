00:00:03.560 - 00:00:33.580, Speaker A: All right, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. If you're listening to this on the Empire feed, Santee went soft on us. Santee got COVID, actually, from token 2049. So if you are hearing this on the empire feed, we have plugged the bell curve roundup with Vance and Michael, who are the founders of framework ventures into the empire feed. So enjoy. There's also disclosure that we have to read because we have been apparently leaking too much alpha on the show. So we are reading a new disclosure.
00:00:33.580 - 00:00:58.470, Speaker A: The views expressed by my co host today, including Michael and Vance, are their personal views and do not necessarily represent the views of any organization with which my co hosts are associated. And nothing in this episode or any episode of Bell Curve is construed or lied upon us as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. Damn, you guys. What, you just get new lawyers or something? That is a good. That is a good disclaimer.
00:00:58.622 - 00:01:00.030, Speaker B: Cover all the bases.
00:01:00.222 - 00:01:01.714, Speaker C: Yelling at the ladder.
00:01:03.654 - 00:01:11.214, Speaker A: I have seen that email come through every week being like, you guys need to fix the disclaimer. I'm like, or the disclosure. So anyways, here we are.
00:01:11.334 - 00:01:13.942, Speaker C: No more power tools. Sorry, guys.
00:01:14.118 - 00:01:15.478, Speaker A: It's all right. It's all right.
00:01:15.566 - 00:01:15.846, Speaker C: All right.
00:01:15.870 - 00:01:40.456, Speaker A: We got a lot to talk about today, so I want to jump straight into it. We are do not have macro Mike joining us today, so we will be skipping the macro. We will be skipping the charts that I think are just a bunch of tea leaves. What we are going to do is jump right into sushi. A couple of things I want to talk about today. Sushi, maybe Solana, Mev, maybe polygon, super nets. I want to get your guys take on Cosmos and the whole narrative and just Adam 2.0
00:01:40.456 - 00:02:05.096, Speaker A: potentially talk about this idea about uni chain and app chains right after cosmos, per usual. We'll see where this conversation takes us. For those who missed it, Sushiswap brought in a new head chef. So I can kind of give you. Let me share my screen here and show you guys the story. If you can see this here. Sushiswap head chef election was settled by golden tree in Cumberland.
00:02:05.096 - 00:02:35.170, Speaker A: The reason that that was the title of the blockworks article is that there were 13 million votes to basically elect a new chief executive of Sushiswap, aka the head chef Cumberland and Golden Tree. Cumberland is a huge, like, OTC desk market maker trading firm in crypto. Golden Tree is a massive asset manager. They have $47 billion under management. They cast a combined 8.1 million of the 13 million votes. There were three other kind of big whales that cast 11 million of the 13 million votes.
00:02:35.170 - 00:02:55.494, Speaker A: So 11 million of the 13 million votes were cast by just these five big whales. And they elected this new guy, Jared Gray, who used to be the CEO of Defi platform Eons finance. There are two other people, someone named Andy and someone named Ken, who finished second and third. So sorry. Sorry for you guys. Andy and Ken, Michael and Vance. What do you guys think about this?
00:02:57.274 - 00:03:17.954, Speaker C: I mean, I think you kind of got to go into the history of sushi first, which, like, you know, the very, like, Cliff notes version is launched, is, like, uniswap copy pasta. You know, they vampire attacked them with tokens. It was, like, kind of this populist movement. There's, like, so much drama with sushiswap. You know, chef know me.
00:03:18.334 - 00:03:19.046, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Nomi.
00:03:19.070 - 00:03:52.834, Speaker C: Nomi know me. Rugged returned it. A lot of behind the scenes stuff happening. Joseph DeLong was the CTO for a good while and was kind of, like, beating the populous drum against Uniswap. Like, he left. There was, like, a struggle for leadership, and this thing's kind of been, like, floating in the water for probably, like, a year now, just waiting on what it does next. And I had honestly kind of written sushiswap off as kind of, like, one of these defi protocols that was like, frog nation Luna.
00:03:52.834 - 00:04:13.034, Speaker C: Like, too decentralized. Like, not enough central control, not enough of a strong leadership figure, and so had written them off. Was surprised to see somebody step up and say, like, I want to be the head chef of sushi. Digging into it. Like, it does make sense. Like, there is some value in this ecosystem. Like, there's certainly a good deal of training volume.
00:04:13.034 - 00:04:51.466, Speaker C: I think, for us, projects that have a lot of, like, emotional and drama baggage are hard to kind of, like, you know, be excited about. I think, like, you know, it's definitely one of, like, kind of, like, the more, like, rookie style mistakes of, like, just saying, like, oh, yeah, like, we can fix this. You know, like, I can. I can save this project. Like, there's some that you definitely can. There's, like, probably a larger group that you can't, but, yeah, I mean, this is probably the first, you know, e five protocol that was super decentralized to have someone pick up the reins and try to run with it, like, yearn sushiswap. Frankly, these are the two main ones that we're waiting to see what happens long term.
00:04:51.466 - 00:04:53.522, Speaker C: But it's certainly a positive sign, I.
00:04:53.538 - 00:05:56.654, Speaker B: Think, just to piggyback on that, I think about this in the comparison of centralized tech companies or startups, the rate of decision making, the veracity of the decisions that are being made, everybody's swimming in the same direction. You lose that with decentralization versus centralized. And when you have these major pivots, like this situation, or any other major pivots in DeFi protocols. In the past few years, synthetics has gone through a number of pivots or changes, used to be called haven. That takes a really, really strong founder, usually, or a really, really strong person to be able to rally the community, get the core contributors on board, bring in new people to help fill gaps or grow the team. And it's also true in tech companies. When you have a founder led technology company, and this is one of the core thesis of a lot of venture capital firms, they want to see founders be the CEO's.
00:05:56.654 - 00:06:28.854, Speaker B: Mark Andreessen has talked about this a lot. It's because you have the context, you have the history, you have the ability to buy in the rest of the company, and you also have the ability to have a long term view, as opposed to someone who's going to be a little bit more mercenary or short term oriented in situations like this. So hats off to the team. I wish them the best, but I think generally, it's going to be a really hard, uphill battle unless you have that history of being the original person. And just decentralized organizations are going to be tougher.
00:06:30.274 - 00:06:50.084, Speaker A: Does sushiswap still have the same model? My memory of sushi is that they have the. Was a fork of uniswap, but they put in fees, basically. So that is what distribution holders got, like, 0.05%, and liquidity providers got, like, 25 bits or something like that. And that was really the primary difference was on the fee structure. Yeah.
00:06:50.384 - 00:07:00.404, Speaker B: And I think they. I could be wrong. They also maybe did, like, the X sushi. So, like, the X token concept first for staking was another component.
00:07:00.944 - 00:07:25.464, Speaker C: They also released, like, trident. Like, it's not like a pure copy paste fork of uniswap anymore. Like, there's certainly differentiation, I will say, like, you know, thinking back on it, like, a little bit more deeply. Like, this is not the first time someone's tried to turn this around. I remember defiance. I remember Arca as well. I think the difference here is, like, you have the guy, and it's always just a matter of, like, who's sitting in the seat.
00:07:25.464 - 00:07:46.284, Speaker C: So, you know, we're gonna find out pretty quickly if he's legit or not, which is cool. But I really like to see people just like, doubling down and throwing their weight behind something. I feel like a lot of times in crypto, like, everyone's, like, perpetually hedging, like, what's the next rotation? What's the next app category? What's the like? It's like, no, you actually have to sit there and hands on keyboard, build this thing. And so I think that's a positive.
00:07:46.664 - 00:07:51.120, Speaker A: There are no amount of Jeff dormant tweet threads that could save sushi.
00:07:51.312 - 00:07:52.448, Speaker C: Not enough in the world.
00:07:52.536 - 00:07:55.044, Speaker B: Not enough, but not for lack of trying.
00:07:57.144 - 00:08:26.394, Speaker A: I'll play devil's advocate here, actually. So argument that says this is maybe not going to work out and that sushi is just going to continue kind of falling is that super messy project. They've been out without kind of leadership since Xerox Machi. They've been looking for the CEO for a long time. Like, insane amount of drama. Drama around, like, how much to pay people, too, which was just, like, all out in the open because it's a dao. And, like, you just got to imagine that Uniswap's just going to continue innovating more than sushi will.
00:08:26.394 - 00:08:49.310, Speaker A: The counter argument maybe could be that. Okay, so Jared Gray gets put in as head chef. Process obviously wasn't that smooth. The community had a lot of pushback because it felt like this very centralized process. But he's going to focus on, I don't know, it's like, you've got this. It'll be interesting to have, like, a non crypto, I guess he is. Never mind.
00:08:49.310 - 00:08:58.550, Speaker A: I was going to say it'll be interesting to have a non crypto, like, non defi builder come in and really focus on just like, hyper focusing on revenue and market share. But he is. I guess he is a defi.
00:08:58.662 - 00:10:00.002, Speaker B: He did so one kind of where I think you were kind of heading, and one of the things that I've been thinking about just in reading this news is like, okay, let's take the competitive set of sushi versus uni, and who knows in depth what the details are. And we can probably talk deeper about this later, or we can save it for now, too. But what's going on with uni right now? There are at least rumors that they're raising for Uniswap labs. How does that relate to the Uniswap token? Does that change their general strategy going forward? Does that mean that they're maybe moving away from a token based, decentralized, dao based model? Not to say that they've ever been as decentralized as sushi, but there are big questions going on right now as to what the direction of Uniswap is going forward. And I think there's a bit of, okay, if they're going to zig, then maybe sushi is going to be able to zag and have some counter position perspective. I do think that's actually kind of an interesting dynamic of what's going on with unique.
00:10:00.098 - 00:10:43.412, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the other part is Uniswap is certainly really impressive right now. I think they've got like 70, 80% of the market share of Dexs on at least ETH and ETH L two s. What we found just being LP's, like, we were the largest LP in Uniswap for, I think, over a year at one point. It's really hard to make money in the uni v three setup, especially when you're accounting for things like impermanent loss and your positions being stale. It's incredibly hard to make money. And a lot of times when you're an LP and you swap e three, you're actually losing money. And so the long term customer for all of these things is not actually the swappers, it's the LP's.
00:10:43.412 - 00:11:52.738, Speaker C: The liquidity needs to be there to manifest swappers right now, as a swapper on Uniswap, and as someone who uses this stuff a lot, I feel like we're getting really good, potentially too good execution on a lot of things that are either stale or LP's that are having problems making money. And so one thing that I consider is like, is it really uniswap versus sushiswap? Is there a better, different model that's going to come out and actually disaggregate these? And I think the answer is probably yes over the long, long term, just because the LP setup for Uniswap LP's right now is so dire and you're not really making a ton of money. Like, we've had startups that have gone off and tried to build position managers for Uni V three and have done, I guess, like, two years of economic simulations on how it works and what the best optimal position is. They're like, we can't build a position manager that makes money here. And so that is a pretty big red flag. And I think what that points to is there has to be some other model. Is it payment for order flow? Is it something else that really comes in and disaggregates it? Okay, you're trying to compete with Google in 2001.
00:11:52.738 - 00:12:01.826, Speaker C: What's the best way to do that? Probably not build a search engine. Probably go build a social media network. There has to be some other vector that is the real competition, because this doesn't seem like it's the one.
00:12:01.970 - 00:12:28.518, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's maybe another competitive angle that they could take, even though. What's this guy's name? Jared Gray. It seems like he's coming from Defi. He's clearly backed by wisdom tree and Cumberland. And it seems like wisdom tree and Cumberland were doing some work behind the scenes before the vote to make sure that the community was kind of backing this guy. Maybe sushi now becomes like, you've got this protocol that's spitting off revenue.
00:12:28.518 - 00:12:44.140, Speaker A: They've got the fee structure already implemented. Maybe uni becomes the. Excuse me. Sushi becomes the protocol that's favored by some of these bigger, more traditional funds. I don't know if you guys saw avi Feldman from wisdom tree. Wisdom tree is, uh, obvious head of crypto. Wisdom tree.
00:12:44.140 - 00:12:56.460, Speaker A: Wisdom tree is a $47 billion asset manager. They. I mean, they have a tiny microscopic position. It's $5 million, I think, which is like, 0.01% of their book, if I'm doing that math right. Or, like, even less than that.
00:12:56.492 - 00:13:00.744, Speaker B: Well, I think golden tree is their crypto sub, right?
00:13:01.564 - 00:13:02.964, Speaker C: No, golden tree is the fund.
00:13:03.084 - 00:13:04.348, Speaker A: Golden tree is the fund.
00:13:04.516 - 00:13:07.476, Speaker B: Oh, you're saying. Wisdom tree, golden tree.
00:13:07.500 - 00:13:20.538, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Golden tree, golden tree. And they came in and they posted this thing on the governance forum being like, hey, we want to help. We want to help with tokenomics. We want to help with general design and general strategy. We've been talking through it with the team.
00:13:20.538 - 00:13:35.774, Speaker A: So if someone like a golden tree gets on board, Cumberland's on board. Maybe you could see traditional funds coming on to something like sushi. And now you've got this new guy, Gray, who's clearly favorable for these folks.
00:13:36.794 - 00:13:52.850, Speaker C: I think it's back to your point of, like, you know, how many Jeff Dorman tweets can save this project? It's like, probably there's not enough. And, like, you know, like, we throw our weight behind projects and we'll put liquidity and trading volume through them. At the end of the day, it needs to succeed on its own merits. Like, you know, the VC's are not going to be able to make the difference.
00:13:52.922 - 00:13:54.530, Speaker A: You need good product. You need good product.
00:13:54.602 - 00:14:18.834, Speaker C: I was going to say be trending in your favor as well. Like, are you the solution that's better, or are you the direction that the market's trending? Too early to tell for sushi, but it's going to take more than just governance posts. And this is inclusive of all the things that we do as well. We're not going to be able to save projects or really even make the difference. We might give you 30 or 40% better odds, but at the end of the day, it's about who's sitting in the chair.
00:14:19.214 - 00:14:39.804, Speaker B: I think the big question here is, what does it mean to have all the funds on your side? Does it mean that everybody's buying up sushi and voting in governance and participating? Or does it mean that they're actually sending flow through? Because that's really all that matters. At the end of the day, I have yet to see an institutional perspective of, hey, this is the preferred institutional way to trade.
00:14:40.544 - 00:15:08.564, Speaker C: If we're still here in a year talking about this, and golden Tree has made good on all of their promises, I think that's amazing. But there is this thing with hedge funds where things are said, is there the follow through if the price goes in half, is there still the same level of commitment? I think the plug for VC's, which are often chat on, is we have a ten year time horizon, 15 if we really need it.
00:15:11.424 - 00:15:20.044, Speaker A: That's a great call. It's like when you see some of these hedge funds posting on Twitter that they're long this thing, they could be long for the next three days and then they're out.
00:15:20.904 - 00:15:34.696, Speaker C: Love Halpress, Love bridge, Tower Bridge, whatever they're called, love all the hedge funds. Like a lot of respect, but here today, potentially gone tomorrow. We just need to see.
00:15:34.880 - 00:15:54.446, Speaker A: Yeah, let's pivot, because I want to talk about. So we were talking about sushiswap. Let's talk about Uniswap. So, Dan, Elitzer had this thread in a piece about the inevitability of the uni chain. So I'm just going to summarize it a little bit. He basically said, the uni chain is. And this will tie into our cosmos conversation.
00:15:54.446 - 00:16:44.758, Speaker A: So over the past few months, like talking about Cosmos, there's been a lot of interest in app specific chains, or like app chains, basically, Uniswap is the dominant Dex. They have 400 billion in volume across like 39 million trades in the past twelve months. Dan's argument is that a uni chain is inevitable. There are three, as Dan puts it, there are three costs right now to Dex traders, swap fees, to swap fees to LP's, transaction fees, to validators and MeV, to the validators and market makers today, and swap fees being. So those are the three costs right now that are happening. And his argument is that if you moved onto your own chain, you could get rid of a lot of those costs. And by being an app chain, uni would basically minimize the transaction fees and the MeV internalize all the marginal revenue from those activities.
00:16:44.758 - 00:17:20.154, Speaker A: That marginal revenue can flow to the unitoken. And I think that's the argument there. So I'm curious, maybe, Vance, what do you think of something like a uniswap moving to a uni chain? We've talked about this before, but Robert Leshner at compound, and we have an episode with Robert and Stani coming out on Monday, actually, where I asked Robert about this, moving to their own chain. They tried, they tried to create compound chain with Polkadot, and they just didn't like Polkadot. So what do you think of this? Is this something that you would recommend if you were advising the Uniswap team?
00:17:21.694 - 00:17:43.024, Speaker C: No, and here's why. Defi is infrastructure. I'm not going to uniswap so that I can go hang out on uniswap.com. Dot. There's nothing there. It's like a little swap widget. There's nothing there.
00:17:43.024 - 00:18:10.384, Speaker C: What I am going to Uniswap for is if I'm some retail guy from last year, I can trade Shiba inu token, so I can trade dogecoin token. I'm not going there for uniswap.com, comma. I'm going there so I can trade these assets. Now let's follow the logic tree into why are the assets on ethereum? The assets are on ethereum because that's where the highest net value of customers are. That's where everyone's transacting. It's the world stage of finance.
00:18:10.384 - 00:18:33.314, Speaker C: Moving to your own chain might be great, and it might sound like it makes a lot of sense, but who's coming with me? It's like the Jerry Maguire thing. It's like, well, there's not a whole lot of people coming with you. There's no assets on the chain. There's no value there. There's also no users. So you need to reinstantiate this world, convince everyone to launch on your chain. Only then would the assumptions that Dan has really play out.
00:18:33.314 - 00:19:08.248, Speaker C: What do I think is a more likely concept? I think the people who are actually drawing people into the ecosystem. Last year, that was the stupid dog coins. Next year, I think it's going to be the well thought out games that have a lot of utility when they're successful enough, they're probably more of the machiavellian nature where they're like, I want to internalize the whole thing. I want to own the mev, I want to own the spread, I want to own everything. They're going to launch their own chain for uniswap. They're going to have to go launch on the new chains that people are making. It's not going to be uni chain, it's going to be game chain.
00:19:08.248 - 00:19:29.394, Speaker C: And then Uniswap will be so lucky as to be a major participant in that. But this is where this thing that we're just talking about, sushiswap versus Uniswap, is sushiswap going to get there first? Is Uniswap going to get there first? Is it some other payment forward flow model that gives more economics back to the games, gets there first? None of this has to do with Uni chain, but it just is illustrating why this is a faulty logic assumption.
00:19:30.174 - 00:20:12.104, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the same point, but there is a fourth cost associated with trading on a dex, which is slippage. Slippage is predicated on how much liquidity you have in the amm. And if you're building your own chain by default, you're going to have less liquidity until the bridging is strong enough, robust enough, lending enough. But that's going to take a long time. The reason why all this stuff is on Ethereum is because you have the liquidity to be able to trade in size so where it's actually useful and interesting. And I think disrupting that is, I don't think that it's a great idea, but I think it's also potentially disastrous for your core business as it exists today.
00:20:14.364 - 00:20:23.544, Speaker A: Vance, what's the counterargument to what you're saying? Why should they? In what scenario are you wrong? Or what would make you change your mind?
00:20:23.964 - 00:21:36.534, Speaker C: The counter argument to what I'm saying is something like, so assume the assets are going to launch on the place where there's the most customers, and that is going to be ETH and Solana, BSc, whatever you want. The counter argument would be the assets that are being traded or the games that are bringing people in will continue to live at the layers that everyone knows and loves, but Uniswap will be able to have people transact through them through their chain, but still have all the assets live on these commonly known and acknowledged base layers. That might make sense. That also has a lot of interoperability assumptions where the assets stay in one place, but your DAX is actually executing and functioning on another. Usalt, frankly, doesn't seem like the team to build up a ton of interop assumptions into their business model. I think that would be the counterargument. The other counterargument is now like, Uniswap is such a big player and they have such large market share of the commonly traded base pairs.
00:21:36.534 - 00:22:07.054, Speaker C: So like ETH and USD, that like maybe moving this whole thing over to the other ecosystem isn't so bad. I think the problem with that argument is that the basis points and the slippage and the MEV on like ETH USDC transfers, really not that big. Like most of what Uniswap makes its money on are like the ample force of the world. Like, remember when that was going on? Like when that Uniswap pool was just like popping off, they were rebasing the coin, like speculative activity. Unless they have that, this argument gets a lot weaker.
00:22:08.794 - 00:22:24.634, Speaker A: Michael, when does it. Okay, so if it doesn't make sense for someone like Uniswap to do their own, have their own app chain, when does it make sense to have your own app chain? Or maybe this is getting at the heart of your guys thesis that you don't like the app chain thesis.
00:22:27.334 - 00:22:55.258, Speaker B: App chain thesis is alive and well. I think when you need your own app chain, it's when you need to control things like transaction throughput, transaction costs. You need to control the economics of the core user experience. I was actually going to say the counterargument to, as well as have a core infrastructure layer. That's like driving a manual transition versus an automatic. You got to source the validators, you got to make sure they're all on board. You got to make sure the upgrades go smoothly.
00:22:55.258 - 00:23:52.214, Speaker B: Right now, Ethereum basically takes all the back end services of running a function like swapping assets and handles it all. For Uniswap, yes, you have to pay gas fees, and that's where users are paying those fees. But if you want to go manual and do it yourself, that's great. It also provides an additional utility for the Unitoken itself, because that's what is secure in the network right now. Uniswap, uni versus sushi, it's just governance, and there's no fees flowing to it currently. Sure, there's the mechanism eventually, if that gets turned on, but then having the additional utility for the unit token is something that I think could be additionally valuable. The thing that, to Vance's earlier point on DeFi is infrastructure liquidity is so important for DeFi, it's really hard to see without a really solid example of extremely trusted bridging.
00:23:52.214 - 00:24:33.278, Speaker B: It's really hard to see how you can be able to trust putting all the liquidity on fragmented, different app chains, at least in the current state of the world. Maybe in like three to five years when we've got IBC completely functional and everybody's in agreement. But right now, I'm not going to put any of my assets into a bridge or trust a bridge in any size. That negates me, as a large Dex user, of being able to move my assets over. What I would rather have is a situation where you have less value on these app chains and only bring them over when you need to. I think we've talked about this maybe two episodes ago. I think Ashley games are a perfect example of how the app chain thesis plays out.
00:24:33.278 - 00:24:56.424, Speaker B: Less defi infrastructure, because transaction throughput is not going to be a gating item nearly as much as games will be. And if you can control your own technology, your own scale, games make a better ecosystem. Example for the app chain thesis versus DeFi, because you want to aggregate liquidity within DeFi, whereas games, it's not necessarily as important for that.
00:24:56.614 - 00:25:37.336, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you could argue that liquidity is the most important feature of DeFi, 100%. But by far, if you think about it, and I think the reason I say that is because liquidity across DeFi enables the experimentation of financial products to be 100 times faster in DeFi than it is anywhere else. I was talking to Mike about this the other day. If you launch a, like, first off, if you want to launch a financial app in like, within, like a bank, like at Goldman, like, you want to launch a new product. Or maybe I was talking to you guys, maybe this was on one of the podcasts. I think we've talked about this here. But like, if you want to launch a product at Goldman, it takes like four years to launch the product.
00:25:37.336 - 00:26:06.178, Speaker A: If you want to launch a fintech app, you first have to launch the app. It's easier to launch an app than launch a product within Goldman, but you first have to launch the app. How are you going to get users? You got to raise a shit ton of vc money, go spend that on a bunch of Facebook and Instagram ads, and then acquire users. Or you could obviously sponsor the Bell Curve podcast and acquire a bunch of users that way and then, but, like, there's no way to get the liquidity takes years, right? And defi, liquidity can take minutes. So I think that's the powerful part.
00:26:06.266 - 00:26:11.774, Speaker B: I mean, this pitch, this storyline, this narrative is exactly probably in like most of our pitch decks.
00:26:12.234 - 00:26:59.438, Speaker C: Yep. One, just, like, brief note on uniswap. Not to get too far away from the app chain thesis, but I think there was this really big bull case on Amms and composability two, two and a half years ago. And I think where we mostly saw that are things like flash loans and MeV between the big money markets, Aave Compound and Uniswap and sushiswap. I remember Ndydx when they used to do, I think it was unlimited flashlights or something, but there was this kind of big composability moment happening, and people, like, extrapolated out, like, okay, cool, what's next? And I think what people thought was next was effectively. And we backed a couple companies that tried to do this unsuccessfully, was like, cool, Uniswap is super composable. Let's build stuff on top of it.
00:26:59.438 - 00:27:23.374, Speaker C: So, like, what did we fund? We funded things that were building position managers on Uni V three. And, like, it just turned out that the LP experience was not good enough where we could provide effectively a way to manage his positions automatically through unity three. So that really never happened. The other category that we backed was kind of like margin or features trading built on top of. In one sec.
00:27:25.194 - 00:27:27.454, Speaker A: You'Re going to kill the listener's ears with that.
00:27:28.674 - 00:28:14.874, Speaker C: Sorry, got a girlfriend. But the other thing that we backed, which didn't work, was kind of like, people building out features and margin trading on uniswap on top of it, using, like, literally, the underlying liquidity from the uni V three positions to re hypothecate leverage positions that also didn't work. It just became too hard to actually, within the uni v three context, like, build out this thing. And so one kind of, like, additional, like, bearish, like, piece of information about Uniswap is, like, the composability movement of, like, higher order products being built on top of it just kind of hasn't happened. And so maybe that's, like, an avenue that sushiswap can build out and differentiate on, but that was something that we were super bullish on, which just, like, didn't happen.
00:28:15.934 - 00:28:42.556, Speaker A: That's interesting. There are two places we could go here. One is, I want to get your guys take on cosmos. And, Vance, you ping me this weekend being like, I'm digging into Adam 2.0. So I want to hear your thoughts from that research. The other place is, I really want to get your guys to take on private order flow. I was on a call earlier today with a big, big Mev like a cert with a searching firm, and they're like, private order flow is the new meV.
00:28:42.556 - 00:29:05.990, Speaker A: And so I've just been trying to think about what that means, and so, Vance, because you're giving me those, the cute eyebrow raise, the doot. I will pick on you for this answer. You're muted, Michael. Should we let him just keep going for a while? I can tell he's passionate about the topic. That's good, though.
00:29:06.172 - 00:29:27.810, Speaker C: I mean, we have investments there, so. Of course I am, but, I mean, I do think this is kind of like the. Okay, if you want to go compete with Google, go build something on some entirely different vector. And, like, what are the vectors? The first one is just like. It's a better lp experience, actually.
00:29:27.842 - 00:29:30.498, Speaker A: Sorry, Vance, can we zoom out? Can you explain private order flow to me?
00:29:30.546 - 00:29:31.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say, sure.
00:29:31.682 - 00:30:01.030, Speaker C: So if you think of a Dex like a front end, like Zapper, for instance, they're the fourth largest x. People don't know that, but they serve a ton of flow towards Uniswap and towards Matcha. And what happens is someone wants to swap. Cool. You're accessing the Uniswap or the matcha RFQ system, and the order executes that way. That doesn't really happen in traditional finance. There's not these large, latent pools of capital that are just willing to serve you execution.
00:30:01.030 - 00:30:31.578, Speaker C: It's probably like a sub a better than you should expect price. In tradfi, the model of monetization is payment order flow. And what does that mean? It means private order flow, kind of like we've been discussing. But Robinhood has a trade. Okay, cool. They'll sell that order flow ahead of time to Citadel, who gives the customer zero basis point fee, swaps and internalizes all the flow and volume, and uses it to monetize it in a different way. And so let's apply that model to crypto.
00:30:31.578 - 00:31:14.656, Speaker C: So instead of Uniswap and this 30 basis point model, you send it directly to a protocol or a set of people that are willing to bid ahead of time for your order flow. They're willing to bid up to the cost of something like a uniswap. So the users get, like, 20 or 30 basis points of spread back to them. But on top of that, the market makers sell the flow or they execute the flow and they give the wallet back a few basis points on that, and it's basically taking the payment forward flow model from tradfi and exporting it to defi. What are the downsides? Of this. Not everyone is sophisticated enough to bid on order flow. You have to have a very specific perspective.
00:31:14.656 - 00:31:34.636, Speaker C: You probably need to be based in some sort of MLai discipline to really tell what it's worth long term. And so it's a more exclusive kind of participant set. And that's kind of generally how defi has been trending. Uni v two, throw 50 50 ETH USDC in. We're all going to have a good time, we're all going to make it. Uni v three. Okay.
00:31:34.636 - 00:32:16.056, Speaker C: You need to have a perspective on where you're setting your range, like how the price moves, like what are you going to do? Even more exclusive. And we're kind of moving into an even more exclusive world with payment forward flow and private order flow in general. So the negatives are that it's a more exclusive experience for the LP's. The other positive I would say is that this reduces MeV entirely. Like MeV is a result of basically bad execution, I would call it just at a very high level. And this basically ensures that users get the best price at any moment based on the market maker's understanding of the flow and the current price on the exchange. So there's good and bad.
00:32:16.056 - 00:32:32.048, Speaker C: I would say it's overall more mature. I would also say it's just easier to port place to place. If you've got a game launching on its own app chain, you don't have to port over the uniswap contracts, you don't have to port over the liquidity. Okay. Like what assets do you need? Okay, I don't have those.
00:32:32.096 - 00:32:32.312, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:32.328 - 00:32:48.434, Speaker C: I need to go get them. Like professional market makers, professional daos that are bidding on order flow, take care of that. And so if you're a bull on the app chain, thesis on the fragmentation thesis of these chains, private order flow is probably a more interesting model than reconstructing amms everywhere you go.
00:32:49.174 - 00:33:28.884, Speaker B: One thing that I just want to double click on, and I'll pose the question back to Vance maybe, or I can dig in on it as well, is let's just dive a little bit deeper onto the economic model. Right now you've got a trader that's on Uniswap and they're going to experience the 30 basis point fee by using Uniswap. There's also going to be some cost of using the Ethereum protocol, which is the gas fees. Then there's also going to be MeV, which may be another couple of basis points where they're not going to get the best execution because someone's going to frontrun them or reorder the block as it's being produced. How does this change when you've got payment for order flow? Basically, where does the advantage come from?
00:33:31.344 - 00:33:40.578, Speaker A: It's like the supply chain of MeV is user to the wallet, to the searcher, to the builder, to the validator, right?
00:33:40.626 - 00:33:41.254, Speaker C: Yep.
00:33:41.554 - 00:33:44.894, Speaker A: So how does that look different in this system?
00:33:46.554 - 00:34:35.806, Speaker C: So what would be a good analogy here? So if you think about, like, kind of an order book, and, like, the order book goes from, like, you know, the very top of the book, the trades that retail are doing to the very bottom of the book. So the super complicated MEV trades that are happening and people are fighting over them. Payment for order flow kind of lives at a higher level of abstraction, where you're just meeting the user right where they are. You're saving them 30 basis points that it costs to trade on Uniswap, and the wallet is making money instead of the LP's. That's the fundamental change. And that's really at the top of the order book. The MEV stuff is like, okay, is there sloppy execution on amm? Are there still orders? Did the price move while the amms price didn't move? That's where all the Meb stuff comes.
00:34:35.806 - 00:35:03.434, Speaker C: And so really, like, payment forward flow kind of serves to eliminate MEV if it's, you know, if everyone adopts this en masse, like, it should eliminate a lot of the Mav that exists in ecosystems today. And so it kind of throws a lot of, like, you know, to go back to, like, the unit chain thesis, like, if Meb doesn't exist, you know, like, that's going to be a big change for how blockchains are economically constructed. It changes the bull case for the app chain thesis. It changes a lot of things. What is it super bullish on? It's bullish on the payment forwarder flow model.
00:35:04.264 - 00:35:13.752, Speaker B: Key point here is that you're sending these orders, this flow, to a centralized market maker. You're not sending them through to uniswap.
00:35:13.928 - 00:35:38.654, Speaker C: It's different than that. So, done correctly, and we've made an investment in this space. We cannot talk about it as lawyers. But the best model of this, why payment forward flow sucks in tradfi, is because it's only citadel bidding on it. It's like you trading versus Ken Griffin 24 7365. And that's largely because of their regulatory mode. In the egalitarian payment forward flow model that we think happens.
00:35:38.654 - 00:35:57.154, Speaker C: It's like you can have Daos bidding, you can have centralized market makers bidding. You can have groups of people. It's an auction process that includes a lot of different types of participants. And we don't want the model to be us trading against Citadel, but in defi this time, we want it to be open to everyone. And that's what I think a lot of the promise is here.
00:35:57.624 - 00:36:15.832, Speaker A: So you're basically, yeah, okay, I think I get it. And so in one example, you could take all the transactions instead of routing them through like the open RPC, you could take a private RPC. Basically the private RPC sits as the aggregator and. Oh, interesting. Okay.
00:36:15.968 - 00:36:20.284, Speaker C: The payment for order flow model too. You're bidding for order flow ahead of time, right?
00:36:20.784 - 00:36:21.564, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:21.944 - 00:36:24.832, Speaker C: So like instead of the wallet, the.
00:36:24.848 - 00:36:27.024, Speaker A: Auction happens before, right, right.
00:36:27.064 - 00:36:54.476, Speaker C: The auction happens before you're selling your order flow ahead of time. And so you'd imagine you need some pretty complex models to understand what future order flow is like or it is worth. But yeah, I mean, these are the things where it's like the DeFi protocols, like going head to head with each other. I don't know how much that moves the needle, but if someone builds at a different level of abstraction, this is going to be what eliminates the uniswaps of the world.
00:36:54.620 - 00:37:06.624, Speaker A: Yeah. So this got it. So this could bring, this would bring down, if this got bigger and bigger, wouldn't this bring down MeV by like 95% or something? Some large.
00:37:06.964 - 00:37:12.892, Speaker B: You basically get rid of MeV and DeFi transactions that exist on chain because what you're doing in that stack of.
00:37:12.908 - 00:37:16.684, Speaker A: Like, which would be bad for the app chain thesis, right?
00:37:16.724 - 00:37:43.124, Speaker B: Which would be bad for the app chain thesis for DeFi, but good for the gaming thesis, for instance, because once again you can route all these transactions to a centralized payment for order flow transaction module where you don't have to source liquidity on each individual app chain anymore. The app chain can just be the experience, the game, what have you, some economics. But then the liquidity comes from a single point of pee FoF.
00:37:43.944 - 00:38:11.786, Speaker C: And who benefits here? The people who are swapping, they benefit because there's lower fees. They also benefit because there's lower Mev. Like you're not getting taken to the cleaners. Every time you swap. The wallets win because they make more money. You're able to monetize their order flow. Compare that to Uniswap, where it's like this cross section of semi professional LP's kind of loses on most trades.
00:38:11.786 - 00:38:51.154, Speaker C: It seems like the wallets don't get demonetized or internalize any of the monetization that happens because of these swaps. This is where, in our opinion, a lot of this is going. But I had one last point. The key part here is that it's an open auction. We don't want to recreate citadel. We want to recreate a healthy ecosystem of people that are bidding on order flow, that are reducing Mev, that are giving customers back their money, and they're monetizing wallets, or whatever the conception of wallets are. I think that does the app chain thesis get more bearish as a result? Probably at the start.
00:38:51.154 - 00:39:11.434, Speaker C: But MeV goes back into consumers pockets. They have more money to spend over the longer term. If you build something that's retentive and sticky, they should be spending that back on you. That should just only increase the amount of value that you're capturing as an app chain. I don't know if it's distinctly bearish long term. I would say shorts probably will.
00:39:11.514 - 00:39:23.546, Speaker A: Will the Mev. Will the MEV folks, like, who's a big, like flashbots? Is flashbots going to look at this, see that? This is where the market is going, and potentially monetize by hosting these private order flow auctions. If you.
00:39:23.610 - 00:39:26.090, Speaker B: If you were participating in the private.
00:39:26.162 - 00:39:28.694, Speaker A: Order flow or participating. Interesting.
00:39:29.834 - 00:40:05.234, Speaker C: And they have, like, even, you know, they have like, more conflicts, too. Like, you're serving the order flow, you're serving the MEV. Like, are you a wallet monetization service? My instinct is that these need to be purpose built things. You can't really be a staking service, a MeV service, and payment forward flow. There's going to be things that succeed. I don't think all the MeV is going to go away either. There's going to be a lot of appetite for uni v two style LP experiences that just have mev endogenously there.
00:40:05.234 - 00:40:07.426, Speaker C: So it's going to be a mixture, I guess.
00:40:07.450 - 00:40:41.002, Speaker A: It's actually this nice positive feedback loop, which is private order flow is going to help you build these higher value blocks, which are then accepted more by validators. Because as the blocks are accepted more, then more people are going to give you order flow. More order flow. It's actually a nice positive feedback loop. That's interesting. I'm excited to see your guys investment. I was explaining Mev to a couple of folks on the team today, actually, and they were like, why don't we do Mev? Like, why don't I make some money with Mev? I was like, it's a little more.
00:40:41.002 - 00:40:53.414, Speaker A: A little more complicated. Than that. So I just want to ask you guys, who's making a boatload of money from Mev right now? Is it, like, winter, mutant Alameda, and jump? Is it like, these tiny little five person shops that have a bunch of quants?
00:40:54.194 - 00:41:07.864, Speaker C: It's a mixture, I think, the usual suspects, for sure. Just to be clear, we don't do any mev because that is. It just has some regulatory complications. So, yeah, we don't do any of this.
00:41:08.244 - 00:41:13.500, Speaker A: Your lawyer is so happy right now. You've got that call out. You've got the disclosure at the beginning. Phenomenal episode for the lawyer.
00:41:13.532 - 00:41:21.860, Speaker C: Usually I'm the one getting in trouble too, so there's also kind of, like, these one man shops. I don't know if you remember Edgar from last summer.
00:41:21.972 - 00:41:22.812, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:41:22.868 - 00:41:49.508, Speaker C: He was going to, like, crash Ethereum. I literally did not sleep that entire weekend because I was concerned that all of our things were going to zero. But, like, guys like him, they're on BSC. They're doing their thing there. BSc is kind of like, there's different types of MEV in each ecosystem too. BSc is like the land of the penny slots. People just, like, submitting hundreds of thousands of transactions, trying to get a little bit of MeV because the transactions don't cost anything.
00:41:49.508 - 00:42:18.424, Speaker C: Ethereum is more of, like, an equally. Like, you can lose a lot if your algo starts to misfire. Like, you start to spend a lot in gas fees. Like that could be very costly, especially if you're doing a lot of transactions. Solana is like, an entirely different beast, where I think most of their transactions are probably meV, but it's the same dollar value as some other ecosystem that's comparable. So it's kind of different, and you have kind of, like, these different archetypes in each. The bottom line, I would say, when you're thinking about MeV is, like, who's monetizing? It's the usual suspects.
00:42:18.424 - 00:42:26.234, Speaker C: It's a small handful of people, maybe, like, five or ten, and then everyone else is larping, as far as we can tell.
00:42:27.374 - 00:42:54.024, Speaker B: And I think the other thing, too, is you don't have to be a searcher or get some huge raid that you set up and start doing this. I mean, most staking services have mevboost on and factors that into the whole thing, and so it's usually an additional, like, one to 2% in yield. So I don't think that there's actually too much individual or business opportunity to go after and start doing Mev. Now.
00:42:58.044 - 00:43:19.906, Speaker A: Let'S talk about a lighter. I want to get your guys to take on Cosmos, but I want a quick interlude. I want to get your take on a lighter topic, which is gaming. You guys raised a massive amount of money. I think it's 400 million. And I forget if the whole fund is going towards gaming or half the fund or like some large allocation towards gaming. We have an episode that comes out on either Monday or Tuesday with Stani and Rob.
00:43:19.906 - 00:43:38.502, Speaker A: Rob from compound and Stani from Aave. It's the last episode of season one of Bell Curve. It's a really good episode. You guys should listen to it. But actually, at the end, I was like, what are you guys excited about for the next cycle? And they're both like, gaming. We need need gaming to bring people in. And we think that gaming will bring people in.
00:43:38.502 - 00:44:02.854, Speaker A: Obviously, Stanley had to plug lens decentralized social, but they're both really excited about gaming. So I just want to get your guys, like, an update on, like, where's gaming at right now? Cause gaming feels super quiet as, like, a user who is just lurking on Twitter and like, not investing in a bunch of games. But for you guys, I'm assuming you guys are saying like, wow, it's crazy space. Like, I'm assuming all the l one s are fighting over different games. Like, can you just give us a state of, like, gaming right now?
00:44:03.014 - 00:44:51.414, Speaker B: Yeah. And to go back to when we raised the fund and I think we closed at the end of Q one last year or this year. Wow, it feels like a year go. The reason why we said, and we didn't say the whole fund or what we said is half the fund is earmarked for gaming. And it's not. The second you put down targets for how much you want to put in each dollar value into each category, you're going to ultimately be wrong. But at the time, the reason why we said that is because probably 60% to 70% of the pitches that we see on a week to week basis relate to games in some way, either individual solo titles, publishers that are going after sort of like the ecosystem approach of games still to this day or back then, I would say it's even higher now, and not by much, but slightly higher.
00:44:51.414 - 00:45:17.010, Speaker B: And the quality of those pitches, I'd say, has waxed and waned a bit. It's gone up in times, it's gone down in times, but it's been pretty consistent in terms of the quality. And so that's the reason why we said it. It's just like, well, this is where we're spending way more than half of our time. This is probably going to be amazing. Major theme, because usually what we're seeing from the pitch perspective becomes reality, like two years later. And it also makes sense too.
00:45:17.010 - 00:45:56.014, Speaker B: The business model here is $200 billion a year. Is the global gaming revenue going up to 350 in the next five years. And basically 200 right now is more than art, music and movies combined per year. The entire box office music industry games is larger than that. There's 3 billion people that play games every single month, almost half of the global population. When you think about the market sizing, there isn't really a larger market. But really the minutiae within that is about half of the money that goes into gaming is for mobile based games.
00:45:56.014 - 00:46:39.682, Speaker B: Two things have happened. One, Apple and Google have gotten rid of their IDFA, which is basically the identifier for advertisers, which negates a lot of the free to play business model concept. What we're seeing a lot of is the game developers who know how to build games. They've been building them for decades. They basically say, hey, blockchain isn't just the next platform that could be interesting, it's blockchain is actually the only thing that I think I can build a viable business on for my games. The second thing that's happening is one to 3% of free to play gamers actually monetize and make up that $100 billion. When you have the ability, if you just thinking about it from a player perspective, when you have the ability to, instead of spending 990, $919, $0.99
00:46:39.682 - 00:47:22.638, Speaker B: or $59.99 in a game for these virtual tokens that whenever you're done or bored with the game, poof, that value goes away. If instead you're ascribing that value and buying something that has a residual value in the form of an NFT, and you're buying it for $10, and maybe you're selling it for five or eight or twelve, that model probably means that the monetization threshold for what these games can expect goes up tenfold. So from one to 3%, maybe it's ten to 20%. And that's just a completely different business model for how you look at gaming. And there's been a lot of stuff, to your point, that's come out Axie Z run. A lot of that stuff is basically just random number generator attached to a UI and speculative token economics.
00:47:22.638 - 00:47:36.914, Speaker B: I'd say there are exactly zero sustainable token model games that have launched so far that have residual playing value. But in the next twelve months, I think we're going to hit that candy crush moment where it's like, okay, we see the model, it's working, it's scaling, let's go.
00:47:37.454 - 00:47:59.422, Speaker C: Yeah. So just a couple other stats. There were 55 billion mobile game downloads last year, seven per person. That's crazy. $14.5 billion were spent on mobile game user acquisition in 2021. That's half of all mobile acquisition costs for users in general.
00:47:59.422 - 00:48:27.002, Speaker C: So, like, this is the biggest industry on the planet. It has the most money coursing through it. That's all great. Everything that Michael said is true. Like, these games are coming, they're building. Why does it seem so quiet? I think one of the harder things that crypto people are going to have time wrestling with is that potentially this doesn't involve us as much as something like DeFi did. Like, DeFi felt great because we were stuffing money in liquidity pools and we were swapping it and there's things happening and the NFT mints were crazy.
00:48:27.002 - 00:48:57.388, Speaker C: All of that stuff, I think at least will be ten times larger next cycle. It'll be, you know, that much more interesting. Nfts are going to pop off again. Like, I'm sold on that, on the gaming stuff. Like, unfortunately, it just won't involve as many people, like, from the crypto Twitter audience set, at least they don't need us. Involve a hundred times more people, but, like, not as many of them are going to be the crypto Twitter set. And so, like, I, like, my instinct is that crypto Twitter is going to disparage most of these games.
00:48:57.388 - 00:49:28.796, Speaker C: It's a shitty game with like, you know, some token or the NFT suck or, like, you know, there's no way for us to use it. All of this indicative is like, it's not about you. Like, it's not about crypto Twitter anymore. Like, and that's the point of all crypto. Like, we're slowly onboarding more people. And it used to be about bitcoin and then the bitcoiners couldn't get into Ethereum and they were salty about that, and then the Ethereum people couldn't get into the multi chain world and they were salty about that. That, like, we're just going to do this with ever increasingly larger audiences, but unfortunately it's just going to involve less of the people that are kind of in the industry today.
00:49:28.980 - 00:49:34.452, Speaker B: I think everyone's. So I think maybe that could be the start of where this, like, reception rising.
00:49:34.628 - 00:49:44.196, Speaker C: All boats though. Like, that's the good news. It's like we're going to make this thing like, so much bigger and so much cooler and have so much more economic value, but, like, it's not going to be stuck.
00:49:44.300 - 00:50:08.374, Speaker A: I will say I've actually had an emotional reaction sometimes to seeing the web, two companies come into crypto, like Disney doing like Polygon or like the Starbucks thing, or like, I mean, I'm in this. Well, actually, I won't talk about that, but I'm like, I'm like, that's a load of fluff. Like, there's nothing there. Like, they're not doing anything. But I'm like, but I should be rooting for it. But I'm having this, like, emotional. I'm like.
00:50:08.374 - 00:50:12.814, Speaker A: And that's the reaction that folks are going to have when these games start popping up.
00:50:13.514 - 00:50:38.874, Speaker B: History suggests that you are absolutely right and that this stuff is never going to go anywhere. It's vaporware. It's just for pr. It's like some bd guy who met with some other b guy and let's like, let's do a deal and that's it. And never comes to fruition, I think. Imagine a world where, you know, you have one of the hardest things to crack into is the App Store. The second hardest thing to crack into is getting them to support you from a payments perspective.
00:50:38.874 - 00:51:13.952, Speaker B: There's been talk in the last couple of weeks that Apple has come out and they've been talking to developers about being okay using in app purchase within iOS to purchase NFTs within app. Like, that concept in and of itself is probably one of the biggest pieces of news that is maybe underreported. We took it really seriously. But what that suggests is a user experience where you're playing a game in app, you've downloaded it, you've never touched a blockchain before. You don't even have a Coinbase app. You go to buy an NFT and it's just all seamlessly right there. It scans your face, you use your thumb and boom, you just spent $49.99
00:51:13.952 - 00:51:48.132, Speaker B: to get this NFT. Maybe you never even know that it's on a chain or you never pull it off the ecosystem, but maybe one of your friends is like, hey, did you know that that's an NFT and you can actually sell it? And maybe the NFT goes up in value. You bought it for 50, maybe you sell it for 60 or 70. Or maybe it's like, hey, I'm done with this game. It's like, ooh, you should pull that NFT out and go sell it at a 50% discount and recoup half of the value. That type of an experience is where you get someone who's absolutely non crypto into crypto and actually using it because there's a financial reason to do so. You just trojan horse them with IAP.
00:51:48.132 - 00:51:55.464, Speaker B: Like that, I think is a really, really huge onboarding experience. That's what Robert and Stani are referring to.
00:51:56.324 - 00:52:00.944, Speaker A: All right, let's get it. So what l one is winning the gaming.
00:52:02.284 - 00:52:29.828, Speaker C: All these gaming companies, no clear winner. Like we start up, she's a portfolio company. Kind of tells us where are people building. It seems like a pretty evenly footed race at the moment between Polygon, Solana, immutable, X, and east. I would say those are kind of the four. The ones that we don't see are the app chains. Game developers are just trying to figure out how to build stuff on chain.
00:52:29.828 - 00:52:56.912, Speaker C: You talk to them about having their own token, running their own ballot, they're like, no, absolutely not. Do we think that they're going to want their own app chains eventually? Probably the biggest ones, I would also say, like, things like board, ape, yacht club, and like, how big and how impressive they are. Like, they weren't even able to do this. So, like, it's harder than you think. But, yeah, it seems like kind of they're all fighting it out. Avalanche as well is another one. Kind of.
00:52:56.912 - 00:53:04.324, Speaker C: The ones with the best bd are the ones that are, that seem to be kind of like winning. I don't know if any of them are the long term game, though.
00:53:04.864 - 00:53:08.806, Speaker B: Yeah, it's possible. We still haven't seen that long term gaming winner.
00:53:08.990 - 00:53:10.950, Speaker C: I would say probable that we haven't seen that.
00:53:10.982 - 00:53:12.634, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. That's fair.
00:53:13.974 - 00:53:15.954, Speaker A: Vance, how's the Atom 2.0 research?
00:53:16.534 - 00:53:18.194, Speaker C: It's good. It's good.
00:53:18.894 - 00:53:20.326, Speaker A: You talked to our analyst?
00:53:20.510 - 00:54:04.294, Speaker C: Didn't talk to the analysts. Did all the research myself. Not, not some boomer who gets somebody else to read the white paper for me. I think it's super interesting. Like, I think I came away from my cosmos research like super bullish on tendermint, less bullish on Adam, effectively. What the value prop for Adam is that, number one, there's this concept of shared security or being able to rent security from kind of like Atom stakers. And if you're trying to bootstrap your own chain, like, just renting security from Atom is a pretty easy way to start.
00:54:04.294 - 00:54:39.734, Speaker C: I think that's interesting. You have to pay for the security with your own native token, which makes it seem a little bit akin to polkadot in many ways, where you have to rent a parachain slot. And people say that these things are completely different. I think they're probably more similar than many would care to admit. But that is an interesting proposition where everyone's exchanging their own native token. Adam becomes this index bet on all the projects that are happening within the ecosystem. I don't know how much that reflects where the ecosystem is going today.
00:54:39.734 - 00:55:13.030, Speaker C: Back in the day, a year ago, two years ago, I think this would have been great fertile ground for defi projects, Frog Nation and the really degen populous ones to start on. I see less of those projects in the future. I also see the case for a Defi app chain less clearly than ever before. And so I think it's going to be games that kind of like use tendermint as their app chain basis. But these are big game studios. They're not just giving away tokens to people in this egalitarian crypto punk future. They're business people.
00:55:13.030 - 00:55:54.600, Speaker C: They're going to go rent security from somebody cheaper and not for three or 4% of their token supply. I think also the kind of bear chain with Bear case, with things like Cosmos, is that for games, the most likely candidate for an app chain? Like, there's not a ton of like cross chain stuff that happens almost definitionally. Like, you're not going to be able to take a sword from one game and put it into like the farming game and another. Like, these games were designed very specifically to have a very specific balance. Like, and so like, you know, there's not going to be a ton of like cross chain interaction with the games that have their own app chain. And I think that's pretty bearish for like Adam value accrual. So, yeah, I mean, like, I think what they're doing is really cool and it's going to work on some level.
00:55:54.600 - 00:56:07.064, Speaker C: I just wonder like long term, like, what is the actual constituent set of people that are going to both build on tendermint and rent their security from atom holders and how much cross chain stuff happens to. Unclear.
00:56:07.524 - 00:56:09.224, Speaker A: Good take, Michael, what do you think?
00:56:10.364 - 00:56:52.096, Speaker B: I totally agree. And I didn't do as much research as Vance did into Adam 2.0, so I kind of got the digest from him. Divide and conquer. The stuff that I think about is what is the open source level? It's like AWS versus Linux. And one of the things that we've been thinking about as well is there a business model to be basically app chain as a service. If you do want to spin up an app chain, whether it's for a game or a Defi protocol or something totally different.
00:56:52.096 - 00:57:25.776, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff that is involved in that. Tendermin is somewhat akin to Linux in this example, but that still begs the question of who's AWS? Who's going to be able to help you bootstrap the first 21 validator nodes? Who's going to be the one that can help with user provisioning, managing the etherscan equivalent, having off the shelf tooling that's just going to help you run your system. And so I think that's kind of a narrative that's popping up with this app chain thesis as well. There's going to be ancillary businesses that come about because of this.
00:57:25.920 - 00:57:28.124, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you guys disagree on anything?
00:57:29.144 - 00:57:29.924, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:32.744 - 00:57:34.644, Speaker A: Should Vance get a haircut or not?
00:57:35.584 - 00:57:36.924, Speaker B: Have you seen mine hair?
00:57:39.464 - 00:57:48.244, Speaker C: Last year I had kind of like shoulder length hair and he had like, stop. And now it's loft. Now he swapped. Yeah.
00:57:50.264 - 00:57:52.336, Speaker A: Oh, damn. You do got the lettuce, Michael.
00:57:52.480 - 00:57:56.764, Speaker B: Yeah, I talk it when it's, when it's camera time.
00:57:58.824 - 00:58:00.284, Speaker A: What do you guys disagree on.
00:58:03.624 - 00:58:22.544, Speaker C: Some of the speculative nature of crypto? I think we disagree on like Michael thinks, like, I would say like a lot of the Defi speculative super dgen stuff like won't come back. I think it'll come back in like basically the exact same format and just be much larger. I think that's one.
00:58:23.124 - 00:58:26.264, Speaker A: What's one like yam from 2020 or something?
00:58:27.444 - 00:58:59.384, Speaker C: I don't think that's coming back. But do I think someone's going to launch Shiba Inu coin too? And everyone's going to speculate on uniswap on it. I see that happening again. I see like the NFT crazy mints coming back as well. Speculation is part of blockchains because blockchains are built for value transfer and programmability. And you combine those things together, you can create a bunch of things that are really interesting from a speculation perspective. You can also create financial napalm, which just torches people en masse.
00:58:59.384 - 00:59:29.150, Speaker C: But that's just part and parcel of what we do. I'm pretty bullish on degenerate activity returning where I don't. I don't think. I think Michael is more on the regulated kind of side. Regulated perspective that like, that's what's going to bring people back. Games were pretty aligned on nfts. We're aligned on like, we think pfps are, you know, silly, but like, I at least think they're going to come back and be big I think you're probably more bearish on that, certainly.
00:59:29.150 - 00:59:29.954, Speaker C: What else?
00:59:30.724 - 00:59:32.580, Speaker A: What do you think, Michael? Anything else?
00:59:32.612 - 00:59:55.748, Speaker B: I think that's the correct breakdown, the perspective that I have. I think the biggest difference is this. Dgen defi permissionless defi versus permissioned defi. Essentially. I think the value proposition of DeFi is twofold. The first is transparency and being able to see everything on chain. That is a true innovation in terms of financial services.
00:59:55.748 - 01:01:00.644, Speaker B: The second is composability. So building apps on top of each other, leveraging different protocols. But I think reading the tea leaves of what's happened over the last six months, with the massive explosions that we've seen retail getting blown out, there's going to be lawsuits to follow. Dotoan is on the run all the way to the OFAC tornado cache sanctions, and we haven't talked about it, and it's nothing legitimate yet. But the Uki DaO BZX stuff from the CFTC, it's extremely, as well as MICa, all the different potential regulations that are in process right now within the Senate or the House, every single one of them basically says permissionless defi is illegal and in some way, shape or form, they basically try to stamp it out. Do I think they're going to be successful? Likely no. In the current implementation of these different bills or regulations or changes, it's not going to happen.
01:01:00.644 - 01:01:56.014, Speaker B: And the CFTC stuff is just a complaint, it's not a ruling. But if this is the direction that everybody is leaning, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when this stuff becomes real. We've talked about this a little bit so far on previous pods, but we haven't been able to move fast enough as an industry within DeFi to get to the point of proving true core value to consumers, to have the type of stuff that just happened be washed under the rug, I think there's going to be stuff that we as an industry are going to have to pay for that. I think being permissioned is probably the only way, being KYC is going to be the only way that this stuff will continue to proliferate. At the ten x 100 x scale from here, do I think the existing defi stuff is going to go away? Absolutely not. It's going to continue on. You can't take the smart contracts down.
01:01:56.014 - 01:02:23.496, Speaker B: But I just don't think they're going to have as much attention. The narrative over the last 18 months of the institutions are coming. Well, now they're officially not coming or they're not coming. To the ones that we were thinking they would be coming to. They're going to be running towards the things that they know they have regulatory cover on and that I think is going to drive a lot of activity. Do I think retail flows there? Maybe, probably if there's enough liquidity, but yeah, it's just going to be really interesting. And a lot of this is driven.
01:02:23.496 - 01:02:29.404, Speaker B: It is driven by the actions over the last six months. My perspective is pretty strongly changed.
01:02:30.744 - 01:03:06.464, Speaker A: Maker just went through with their $500 million investment in treasuries and corporate bonds. I think it was like 80% treasuries, 20% corporate bonds. I think it was today they went through with it. Do you guys think that is a good move because it aligns them more? It almost makes it harder to sanction them now because you're hurting the traditional capital market system if you're a regulator because there's now $100 million in corporate bonds, or is this a bad move because it makes them more less censorship resistant? What do you guys think of this move?
01:03:06.944 - 01:03:15.056, Speaker C: I think good move. Number one, they're probably going to make a bunch of money on the bonds. They bought less from an equity.
01:03:15.080 - 01:03:16.792, Speaker A: Well, yeah, actually I want to hear your whole.
01:03:16.968 - 01:03:58.104, Speaker C: And also the long term roadmap is something that you have to keep in view where it's like rune has stated, the goal is to get as much assets and profit into the protocol before it goes fully decentralized and gets cut off. It seems like they're moving towards that direction. I don't think maker governance is one to declare we're going in this direction and we're never turning away. I think you just kind of need to look more at what they do versus more of what they say. I also think it makes them more censorship resistant. Like, cool, you sanction the PSM, we have like $800 million of bonds somewhere that we can draw on. In a worst case scenario, it's better for resilience, better for the long term vision, and getting to more profit in the Dow.
01:03:58.104 - 01:04:10.084, Speaker C: When yields are higher, people are going to rush to export capital outside of crypto when it flips importing, and this is kind of like exportation season at the moment.
01:04:10.244 - 01:04:32.824, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think your point is 100% right in that this does make them more permissioned public defi. They haven't implemented KYC and they haven't done all the things that regulators would probably love for them to do, but this does put them more in the camp of like, hey, we're willing to at least entertain this stuff and maybe not to the same level that you expect, but we're getting creative.
01:04:33.174 - 01:04:38.954, Speaker A: Yeah. You guys have any memes of the week, hot takes of the week, tweets of the week?
01:04:40.174 - 01:04:42.854, Speaker C: Let me see. I got.
01:04:42.894 - 01:04:44.274, Speaker A: I got. I got nothing.
01:04:44.614 - 01:04:53.594, Speaker B: Oh, there's some good ones. I don't mean to pick. I don't mean to pick on them, but basically everything Tom and Giselle has been hilarious.
01:04:54.694 - 01:05:19.578, Speaker C: I thought this one was pretty good. Anybody who's watched the Dahmer Netflix special, I mean, incredibly disturbing and strange, but there's this one scene before he kind of takes one of his victims where he makes them watch this movie, the Exorcist. And Angela. BTC switched that out for the Bitcoin 30K chart. That was pretty good.
01:05:19.746 - 01:05:20.814, Speaker B: I saw that.
01:05:21.674 - 01:05:22.330, Speaker A: This guy.
01:05:22.402 - 01:05:41.794, Speaker C: Oh, it's a. It's a creepy tv show. Yeah. I got past one episode now. It's like, all right, I can't watch this person killing more people. I mean, I think if you look at all of the top podcasts and, like, a lot of the top shows on, like, the streaming service true crime and, like, serial killer.
01:05:42.454 - 01:05:51.502, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I mean, it's all true crime. It's all I was talking to. We're trying to, like, scale the pot, our podcast network right now, and, like, really add more shows and talk crime.
01:05:51.558 - 01:05:53.382, Speaker C: Crypto podcast in there somewhere.
01:05:53.438 - 01:05:54.112, Speaker B: I know.
01:05:54.278 - 01:06:11.904, Speaker A: I was taught. I talked to, like, the head of podcast at Vox, at HBO, at, like, Barstool, at Gimlet, at wonder. Like, I talked to head of podcasts to, like, try to learn, like, what they're doing, and they're, like, all of them. They're like, you want to know the secret true crime? True, true crime. There is. There is no other secret in podcast that you need to know. True crime.
01:06:13.484 - 01:06:22.300, Speaker C: Just do 2021, just a true crime season of things that happened back then, I think. I mean, like, the do Kwan Interpol story is just nuts.
01:06:22.372 - 01:06:23.964, Speaker B: I was going to say, should we go on?
01:06:24.124 - 01:06:47.220, Speaker A: There's, like, an investigative, like, eight part series, podcast on, like, a do Quan. Honestly, I want to do a podcast series on, like, big moments in history where it's like, an eight part series on the, like, on the block wars, like. Like, bitcoin cash versus bitcoin. It's like a deep dive into that. Then it's like a, you know, some, like, an eight part series on, like, Mount Gox. Then they're like, something. I think that'd be really interesting.
01:06:47.372 - 01:06:52.264, Speaker B: I think. So the other. It comes out. I mean, we're recording this on Thursday. It comes out tomorrow.
01:06:52.404 - 01:06:53.280, Speaker A: Coinbase.
01:06:53.432 - 01:06:53.928, Speaker C: Yes.
01:06:54.016 - 01:06:55.120, Speaker B: That's what I was going to say.
01:06:55.232 - 01:06:56.564, Speaker A: I'm hyped for that, actually.
01:06:57.384 - 01:07:15.864, Speaker B: I was having dinner last night with one of our friends who used to be one of the design leads at Coinbase way back in the day. And he said, it's going to be really funny. It's basically a two hour produced by Coinbase, written by Coinbase, about Coinbase, with only Coinbase people in it.
01:07:15.984 - 01:07:32.992, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited. I'm pumped. I honestly think this was Brian Armstrong. I think this is more. Going to be more about Brian Armstrong than about Coinbase. And I think this is Brian Armstrong being like, I'm fucking pissed that people, like, do, like, do not understand how hard my freaking job is. It is a pain in the ass to be a founder.
01:07:32.992 - 01:07:37.304, Speaker A: I want people to, like, understand this. That's what I. That's what I got from the trailer.
01:07:37.424 - 01:07:40.884, Speaker B: This is going to have more marketing poll than their Super bowl ad.
01:07:43.544 - 01:07:51.572, Speaker A: I think it's a brilliant move. And by the way, every other exchange has been talking to filmmakers to do this, uh, behind the scenes, and now they're gonna look like they're copying Coinbase, so.
01:07:51.628 - 01:07:52.148, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:07:52.196 - 01:07:53.252, Speaker A: Good job to Coinbase for moving.
01:07:53.308 - 01:08:04.224, Speaker B: Good speedrun. I think the. The biggest, uh, the biggest thing of the last period of time is, uh, let's. Let's get a debrief on your. On your wedding with. With the rainy in the view.
01:08:05.084 - 01:08:16.574, Speaker A: Oh. Oh, you don't. Oh, you mean this, uh, I mean the wedding caused the. Caused a little mini bull run. You know what it is? I was gonna say, yeah.
01:08:18.834 - 01:08:19.386, Speaker C: The highlight.
01:08:19.410 - 01:08:41.874, Speaker A: Of the wedding is, I mean, we had a wild horror, which was. Which was very exciting. And it got so crazy that my friend was like, picking up the chair and my parents were in the chairs and my mom flew out of the chair forwards. So there's a video of my parents like, hey. And then my mom flies forward and my friend catches her. So that was like, yeah, that was a good.
01:08:42.034 - 01:08:43.532, Speaker B: That's incredible world.
01:08:43.708 - 01:09:05.252, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, congratulations to the both of you. Thank you, sir. I will actually just say I am feeling more like, refreshed and energized about work than I have in a long time. And I think that is just a. Shows that folks in crypto should probably take breaks more because, I mean, we were talking about this before the episode. I doubt you guys have taken a break since you started framework.
01:09:05.252 - 01:09:22.124, Speaker A: Mike and I hadn't taken a vacation in three and a half years. I'm not sure Mike had ever taken a vacation. I hadn't taken one in years, and this was like, you know, Mike's, Mike's on vacation right now. I, I got married, went on my honeymoon, like, and I'm just feeling really refreshed. So I would say there's people should learn from that.
01:09:23.224 - 01:09:23.840, Speaker C: I love it.
01:09:23.872 - 01:09:25.560, Speaker B: There we go. Good message.
01:09:25.672 - 01:09:27.448, Speaker A: Whenever you guys are like, I'm not taking vacation.
01:09:27.496 - 01:09:36.004, Speaker B: But, like, we, yesterday we were joking. Vance is going to make our team. I survived 2022 t shirts.
01:09:36.624 - 01:09:37.404, Speaker A: Nice.
01:09:39.784 - 01:09:41.944, Speaker B: We'll take a break in 2023, maybe.
01:09:42.064 - 01:09:54.744, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So anyway, good episode again. If you guys are listening to this on the Empire feed, go subscribe to Bell Curve. It's a good show.
