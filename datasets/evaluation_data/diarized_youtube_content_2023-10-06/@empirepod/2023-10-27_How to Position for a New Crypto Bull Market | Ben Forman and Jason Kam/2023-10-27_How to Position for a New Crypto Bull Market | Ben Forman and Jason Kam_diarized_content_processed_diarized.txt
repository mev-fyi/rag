00:00:00.400 - 00:00:43.384, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent and decentralized oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces Oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about Chronicle later in the show. The product you already know and love just got even better. If you are stressed about managing your on chain portfolio across different wallets and different chains, I'm super excited to tell you about metamask portfolio, which lets you manage all of your crypto across networks and wallets in one place. Do more in web3 your way with the metamask portfolio manager. You will hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:45.484 - 00:00:57.496, Speaker B: Welcome back, everyone. We have two very special guests, two very close friends. Mine, they need no introduction. Ben, you've been in the pod. This is what, your fourth time now? Third or fourth time?
00:00:57.660 - 00:00:58.072, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:58.128 - 00:01:00.896, Speaker D: So I think it's the fourth time, yeah.
00:01:01.040 - 00:01:16.440, Speaker B: So Ben runs. Ben runs parafy. He whipped me into shape for a few years, and he's still there. I threw in the towel. But we have Jason. He goes by Maple Leaf capital on Twitter. You guys probably know him, and he runs foliage.
00:01:16.440 - 00:01:19.360, Speaker B: So welcome, guys. It's great to have you on.
00:01:19.472 - 00:01:20.400, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:20.512 - 00:01:21.244, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:01:22.344 - 00:01:46.334, Speaker B: Well, both of you, of course, run liquid and private strategies. You've survived this bear market. I don't know if we're still on a bear market or we're transitioning out of it. This last week has been fairly interesting, so why don't we just start there in terms of what you guys are, what your thoughts are around the recent rally, and how are you positioned around that?
00:01:46.454 - 00:02:48.568, Speaker D: The past week of price action has been interesting and not to overly focus on price. I think, like, the three of us have always focused on fundamentals, users, real use cases for this technology. But I do think sometimes price can kind of provide a signal for what's going on in the trenches in the market. And this was, I think in some ways, this move was unexpected, kind of caught many off guard. And I think in large part, it's driven by the bitcoin spot ETF applications that are in that the market's kind of beginning to price in that there's a high likelihood of approval. And this has been like, as everyone knows, like an eight year journey from the Winklevoss twins back in 2014, 2015. And I believe there have been several dozen different firms that have tried to apply for spot bitcoin ETF's have gotten denied.
00:02:48.568 - 00:03:25.186, Speaker D: And it feels like we're kind of at or near the finish line with a high probability of this getting across the line in the next few months. And I think it's, you know, its impact cannot be understated. I think it's on the same, you know, it's more impactful than having. It could be, you know, one of the biggest kind of, you know, I think it took somewhat of a watershed moment. And I think in finance, you know, format of investment matters a lot. And bitcoin is still very difficult to access for Ras family offices, et cetera. So wrappers can, can really unlock a lot of latent demand.
00:03:25.186 - 00:04:01.294, Speaker D: And I think the market's starting to reflect that in the price. And bitcoin kind of tends to lead market cycles, and every 1% that bitcoin goes up, that's $6.5 billion of value created. Some of that then rotates into alts, it rotates into venture, and it's going to be exciting to see where the price goes in the next few months and just kind of, if this gets across the line and its broader, kind of more intangible impact on the space in terms of endorsing, kind of providing an implicit endorsement of this asset class.
00:04:01.954 - 00:04:24.105, Speaker B: Yeah. Jason, before I go to you, I mean, I'm curious, because all of this is happening while tech broadly is selling off. I mean, Google yesterday had its worst day since March 2020. I think it's down 10%. It's down 2%. Like Google literally shed 200 billion in market cap, essentially all of Ethereum's market cap in one day. You see it uncorrelated.
00:04:24.105 - 00:04:36.993, Speaker B: Briefly, Jason, do you compute that into how you're thinking about this rally? Is it dead cat balanced? Is this more sustained? How do you think about all of this in the general?
00:04:37.153 - 00:05:15.554, Speaker C: I actually don't know because I was looking at the chart. I think bitcoin had correlated with gold for the past a month or two. So we might get a little bit of that. And then the entire space, they sort of have both correlation to bitcoin and the tech space. But since Nasdaq kind of shed the bed, it kind of underperformed bitcoin. But there are a host of other reasons. I was sort of hoping that ten years now 5%, I was sort of hoping that there's a broader risk off and people buying bonds, and then that kind of lifts equity and gives the altcoin space a bit of a boost.
00:05:15.554 - 00:06:11.502, Speaker C: But I don't have a really good read on what's going to look like in Nasdaq or next month to actually Ben's point, by the way, I think bitcoin trades a highly correlated thing. It trades a gold stock with a catalyst is how I viewed it the past month and a half. And I think you have a bunch of capital that actually came into the space that is not like crypto. You did see USDC market cap stabilizing and you saw sort of USDT market cap increasing all while during mid September where it's kind of starting to look like this is going through. And to also echo Ben point, I don't know, this is like a real pump where I think folks are starting to realize. I think James Sephard talked about it in his podcast a while ago, which is like 20% of $100 trillion is retail and 80% is institutional. And even if retail aped aggressively, the institutions are just not there.
00:06:11.502 - 00:06:29.022, Speaker C: And if theyre aping through bitcoin ETF, its obviously a huge deal. So I sort of felt like theres a bit more to go even in gold. And if there is a rotation, if Nasdaq does bounce and gold stabilizes, I think the off space could really participate, especially when bitcoin goes through with the ETF.
00:06:29.198 - 00:07:08.504, Speaker B: Yeah, youre more focused on asian markets. And I think it's fairly interesting what's going on in China. And I think it's been hard. Right after the opening, you would have thought that it would have been a much bigger balance. I think a lot of people were expecting that and it hasn't been the case. What is the sentiment out there? And do you pay attention to flows, particularly in China or in Asia, like in Korea and Japan versus western Europe or the US, and how that might be a leading or lagging indicator for kind of interest?
00:07:08.964 - 00:07:42.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I think China's been easing for a while, like to macro wise. And there's a new piece of news that I think to study, which is there's like a pretty massive capital injection just very recently. I think it's like, I don't know, it's like 1 trillion or something that's injected. That's like a move of the balance sheet of local government and central government, and then there's another 2.7 trillion that's like sort of they're pulling back. They're pulling the budget from next year's budget to this year in spending. I almost viewed it as a BTFP of some sort.
00:07:42.534 - 00:08:21.402, Speaker C: It's like a similar flavor but very different in terms of just crypto capital. I think a lot of funds have pulled back just like they did in the US, but there are some market exceptions where in particular, there are like two or three parties that we see a lot that got fresh capital and they're deploying aggressively. One of them, for example, was the APCD of Du Jo Jun from Singapore. I mean, those guys sold their business of Huawei to Justin sun. They backed like two, $3 billion, did himself. Interesting information. Before they sold it, they moved a bunch of retained capital from Huawei's balance sheet to themselves.
00:08:21.402 - 00:08:48.354, Speaker C: So it's like massive dollars of which they are aping themselves plus putting some to use and deploying a venture. I think sentiment is generally pretty good because whatever's left over, kind of, it's after they all got crushed by the chinese government like two, three years ago. And then there's a bunch of two C apps coming out that they are kind of who strapped or getting funded by whoever's left over. So it's like not as bad, I think, versus what the US was six months ago.
00:08:48.754 - 00:09:11.374, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I want to, Ben, get your perspective and then Jason, as well, in terms of how you're positioned, how you were positioned perhaps over the last nine, six months in terms of both of you are trafficking in liquid and illiquid stuff in early stage. And so how are you thinking about that and what you're seeing in both of the different markets?
00:09:12.074 - 00:09:56.754, Speaker D: Yeah, so look, I think it's, it's very much a have and have nots market in the sense that there is a lot to be excited about. I think tokenization of real world assets has been a big theme. Identity on chain, different types of infrastructure, L2, mev zero knowledge proofs, wallet as a service, all of that. There's a lot getting built there. And I think we can all agree that, you know, the UX of using blockchains has improved over the past three, four years since, since we all met. It's kind of happened quietly, but it's just easier to do stuff on chain now. So we've been just focused on really those areas.
00:09:56.754 - 00:11:06.124, Speaker D: I think that the universe of liquid names, when you kind of break it down, the one and a quarter trillion dollars of liquid market, liquid market crypto, about 900 billion of that is bitcoin and ETH, which really is just a form of beta. About 100 billion of thats stablecoins. So its not really investible. So youre kind of looking at a quarter trillion dollar investable market and you kind of double click into those names and the vast majority of them, I think are kind of quasi uninvestable. But that doesnt mean there arent diamonds in the rough and things that are merging with really strong product, market fit and unit economics. We were looking at some of the core defi names two years ago versus today. If you look at uniswap, Makerdao, Aave, Synthetix, DYDX, GMX, et cetera, and just look at basic metrics like users.
00:11:06.124 - 00:11:44.940, Speaker D: TVL is an imperfect metric, but depending on the metric, but total economic value flowing through these systems, and look at that relative to valuation. If you liked Defi a couple of years ago, by definition, I think you should be more interested in it today because fundamentals are better and prices lower. So I think there are interesting idiosyncratic things in liquid markets, but you really have to look hard to find them and really dig in. It can be frustrating because we can look at 20 different liquid tokens and just not get there on any of them well, because they might not even.
00:11:44.972 - 00:11:48.504, Speaker C: Outperform ETH on a way up through a cycle.
00:11:48.884 - 00:12:28.846, Speaker D: Yeah, I think ETH and bitcoin have generally outperformed. The longer you zoom out on the chart, the fewer things that have outperformed them. And then when you adjust for liquidity and then the idiosyncratic risk of investing in a new project, far fewer things kind of have outperformed them. Liquidity adjusted. Risk adjusted. So I think it's a great market for asset selection, but it just takes a lot of work and. But there's a lot to be excited about.
00:12:28.846 - 00:12:38.794, Speaker D: And I think we're going to probably talk about tokenization and other things like that later because I think that could be one of the next big themes that bring us to the bull market.
00:12:39.734 - 00:12:50.554, Speaker C: And by the way, for those that don't know, Ben and Santiago were literally the two people that were super instrumental in bringing foliage to existence. And then without these two, we wouldn't even exist.
00:12:51.474 - 00:13:26.100, Speaker B: Well, we wanted to hire you, Jason, but you were too good. You probably should just run your own and look. I mean, I think the strategy, just as a kind of a tangent, we felt that probabilistically, there should be more teams coming out of Asia and you have to know the language. And we weren't. We were, we had that thesis and, you know, Dragonfly was, we were close to them, but we just felt that there needed to be more capital. Like, just statistically speaking, there needs to be just population wise and developers. There's a ton of talent there.
00:13:26.100 - 00:13:57.454, Speaker B: You've identified in short order. Scroll, step in those two alone. I think as an investing firm, you have to have one or two wins. For us, it was like Aave early on and then Kyber, and we were just really into defi. But look, we benefited from a catalyst. I think compound launching, liquidity mining detonated this whole bull run of defi. You could have argued synthetix had pioneered that model, but no one was paying attention.
00:13:57.454 - 00:14:54.734, Speaker B: But even after a compound launched, you had really six months to pile into the trade. I think that leads me to my question, which is, as we talk about bitcoin and ETH being perhaps really strong as a catalyst, you have the ETF approval for potentially both, certainly for bitcoin first. What is the catalyst for going out further around the risk spectrum and saying, I want to find a diamond in the rough? Ben, to your point, versus just sitting on bitcoin and ETH and just waiting for a catalyst to emerge and then deploying in size into whatever hot. Is it gaming? Is it social fi? Which I know Jason spent a lot of time in, but you have time to. Historically, you've had time to pile onto these trades, and I'm not sure you get rewarded on a risk adjusted basis by being super early, even though it feels great, you know, like, hey, I was super early. I was here. I was the first one.
00:14:54.734 - 00:14:57.154, Speaker B: I'm just kind of curious, Jason, you.
00:14:57.154 - 00:15:07.154, Speaker C: Know, I think apps are harder because, like, even though I shill front tech through a deck, which I'm like, I gotta get this out because it's gonna get a lot of traffic. I mean, apps are just.
00:15:07.234 - 00:15:07.570, Speaker B: If you.
00:15:07.602 - 00:15:33.394, Speaker C: If you miss the mark, you just kind of die. And it doesn't matter if fixes isn't bad. So I sort of apps are, so if they use Ponzi as a user, they just die even faster. So it's even more true. Like, ascension, where you said being early is like being wrong. This is particularly true. And just these other side as well.
00:15:33.394 - 00:16:09.062, Speaker C: I think it's harder for Ben is for me. Like, I think his firm is ten x the size of ours. It really leaves the market impact. We can still kind of navigate. I think my play has always been, when there's an up market, my beta, like, my cash is bitcoin. And I do tend to think there's a catch up trade in ETH, especially if Nasdaq bounces and bitcoin, ETF goes through, Narif will go towards ETH, ETF potentially going through, and the deadline there is May 24 next year. At some point, it's going to do the same Blackrock trade again, and ratio, everything is sitting at support.
00:16:09.062 - 00:16:54.130, Speaker C: I think we're going to have a catch up there the next narrative. Just given where I sit, I think I really wouldn't count on an asian team that came from web two building infrastructure that Vitalik's gonna like. They just don't have the culture and background and knowledge and just kind of like the chops to do it. But they are very pragmatic in terms of picking what works and then just wrapping things together. And I'm generally pretty hopeful of these guys figuring something out. The cost of building something is one third of it, because I'm looking at like three fintech forms, just to give you an example. We might not be the best at putting things together as the first iteration, but the cost of building something next after it with some improvements is like one fifth the cost, and we can do it three times as fast.
00:16:54.130 - 00:17:40.684, Speaker C: So, like one of the sort of founder of these teams are telling me like, dude, like, what franchise fucking build? We could whip it together in two weeks with like less than 100k in Shenzhen, and if it works, we're going to just keep doing it. I think the west would be a little surprised by how quickly these teams will spin up and just take their idea and just put a token on it and just run aggressively with it. Social is a little different because it's social. That community still matters, but for some of these app like products, it's just going to really come to market. And I don't think we get that many of them in liquid investments. To the extent that we do decent, FDB will open, but to those that don't, I think the only way to do it is to sort of pc investments, which is why we run ahead.
00:17:41.944 - 00:18:40.154, Speaker B: I mean, you've had like, the half life of these projects is shorter, especially when you don't have new capital coming in. And if you don't have new capital coming in, then it's really like a PvP. It's just sort of like a rotation and a zero sum game for a lot of these projects. And a lot of the rotation goes back to bitcoin and ETH. And so, Ben, as you think about scanning the universe of liquid tokens or maybe early stage investment, how do you think about that relative opportunity costs and trade? And just out of curiosity, how many private deals have you done over the last three months versus just sitting on, on beta? And you're saying, look, relative to the Nasdaq, bitcoin and ETH have really been crushed and you could say and warrant that it's just good to sit on majors right now.
00:18:41.374 - 00:19:07.236, Speaker D: Yeah. So, first of all, I would echo what Jason said in terms of it's been, I think one of the biggest surprises of 2023 is seen has been Ethereum. Meaningfully underperforming bitcoin. Year to date, bitcoin's doubled. Ethereum's up 50%. So that's kind of two x the performance. I think people think about both of them as beta, but they're actually very different types of assets.
00:19:07.236 - 00:19:56.960, Speaker D: When you really drill into it, digital gold and an Internet native computer, they have different kind of fundamental drivers. I think that's been surprising to me. I maybe wouldn't have predicted that. So I think the type of the way you define beta or kind of like liquid large caps, there's a lot of nuance in terms of how you're allocated there. But look, I think to answer your question, back a couple of years ago, these seed stage crypto deals that we were looking at, we were all looking at, we were like $30 to $50 million fdvs. And, you know, they would list a token, it would trade at a couple billion dollars with a really low float. Many investors would exit.
00:19:56.960 - 00:20:10.768, Speaker D: They would never reach product market fit. Some investors may make money. I mean, crypto is a rare asset class where you can invest in things that don't work and still make money that doesn't work that way. In venture beautiful, you actually have to find product market.
00:20:10.816 - 00:20:13.440, Speaker B: Well, it worked in venture until rates went up.
00:20:13.472 - 00:20:13.808, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:13.896 - 00:20:15.750, Speaker B: Unit economics started to matter.
00:20:15.872 - 00:21:08.670, Speaker D: Well, you got marks, right? I mean, I guess you got marks or maybe you got acquired by a SPAC or you ipo'd without any, like, without good unit economics. But eventually, like, there was a day of and maybe you could sell before the day of reckoning came, but you had to time the market, right, right. So, yeah, there is an element of that. Yeah, that's probably fair. I think right now we've seen the valuations we're seeing are more similar to 2019, 2020 when, like Santiago, like when you and I did a lot of the better deals at parafy in terms of just like the valuation and the entry points. And I think the app layer, to Jason's point, the moats at the app layer, I mean they're really, I mean, it's, they're really weak, they're very tough. I think the motes are much stronger the further you dig down in the stack.
00:21:08.670 - 00:22:10.984, Speaker D: Layer ones, L2s, more core infrastructure, things that, things that are less visible where there are stronger network effects, maybe customer acquisition costs are maybe less relevant. And we were looking at some data, roughly 4000 to 5000 DeFi projects have been launched over the past few years, and we could probably count on one hand the number of projects that we all have confidence will exist, know, the next few years, maybe two hands. So it's like the survival rate's very low. So this is all to say that I think the expected value of seed stage investing, if we can get into deals at 10 million, 15 million ftv, is that could make that. That does make sense. But I think you have to build a lot of granularity and diversity into your portfolio just with the understanding that you're going to be wrong on a lot of different things. And so, and they're going to be power law distributions and kind of in terms of those, those return profiles.
00:22:10.984 - 00:23:50.562, Speaker D: And so that's been kind of the, we've been much more selective this year, much, I would say more valuation sensitive, and also more structurally sensitive in terms of governance, information rights kind of terms and structure of the investments. I think in the prior cycle, people overlooked things like investing in tokens, but disregarding kind of potential terminal equity value, or investing in equity, but not getting access to tokens. And I think it's important to have alignment with teams across the full capital structure of where value could accrue. And then just the last observation on my side, and I'm not sure if you guys would agree with this or not, but I think a lot of the companies or a lot of the, sorry, a lot of the daos that have issued a token that have some sort of fee model and are buying back a token and you could run a DCF on it. A lot of those probably would be better served as just SaaS companies rather than having a token and being a DAO. So we've been, I think we've kind of been chatting with different teams about does it make sense to kind of retire your token and issue token holders, like equity on your cap table, and just run a normal SaaS business and not have the cognitive load of having a token that is volatile day to day and can be a distraction. So we've been probably more focused, a bit more focused on just like the equity side, like backing great fintech and SaaS companies building for the crypto end market without the distraction of a token.
00:23:50.562 - 00:24:00.024, Speaker D: And I think there's probably more, I think, on the margin, bit more opportunity there than maybe in token land at the moment.
00:24:01.564 - 00:24:32.542, Speaker B: That's interesting. I think when I hear you say that, I think about Uniswap and look, full disclosure, we were investors of Parafi and Uniswap Universal. You have equity in Uniswap, you also get a token that corresponds and maps out to whatever the company gets in terms of, say, 40% of the token supply goes to equity holders. And then you get your pro rata. And now it's sort of. People are looking at that in the context of now. The company itself issued hosts the front end and the front end.
00:24:32.542 - 00:25:07.114, Speaker B: If you're going through the front end, it's a 15 basis point swap fee. And look, they're going to generate 20, $30 million this year. I mean, yesterday alone they generated 500k fees. So that was pretty interesting. Metamask is another example, which is run by consensus, which is, to your point, a different example of a company that is a studio and has put out a bunch of different products. Yeah, sorry, it's 500k over last week for Uniswap, but still it's significant. The question is, should Uniswap have a token and then equity too? And people are kind of confused around that.
00:25:07.114 - 00:25:32.634, Speaker B: I don't know what the answer to that is. I mean, I still think the tokens are great coordination mechanisms. The problem, of course, is running a Dao is incredibly hard. And I think people are really waking up to that idea that. I mean, God, Ben, trying to get people to vote on maker was just pulling teeth. Especially when you had to get stuff voted in. In 24 hours, the protocol is going to go dead.
00:25:32.634 - 00:26:11.830, Speaker B: You have to corral these votes. And it was really tough. Or you could argue if you made investments in stuff like fire blocks or Anchorage or some of these core picks and shovel businesses which are just purely equity, you know, people tend to love those businesses, especially traditional venture firms that came into the space late, love that stuff. But again, you don't get the liquidity, you don't get all the other benefits of a token. So I'm actually not really sure what the answer is. Jason, I don't know if you have a view in terms of if you have a preference of what to invest in and at what layer.
00:26:11.982 - 00:26:49.614, Speaker C: Well, I think. I think generally there are just not that many good infra companies or SaaS companies in this out of world. And I would blame it on there are just no SaaS business in China, because that's the space I looked at in the past. You either have really shitty SME's focus SaaS, or you have large corporate, mostly facing government and the customization basically easily the margin. There's no standardization. I generally felt like most companies in a space is poor, so selling SaaS to them is just even worse than pulling teeth in China a lot of times. So we haven't really done that much there.
00:26:49.614 - 00:27:32.650, Speaker C: Now the thing is, I think I agree with both of you, which is for real SaaS business like this that have emote, I mean, there's no reason why they should kind of get a token. Like running a public company is no joke and listing a token is that. And they're probably better off listing in Nasdaq at some point and then getting them gangbuster, not so much these days, but gangbuster valuation while they can. For the apps and for most of ecosystem folks that I look at, we really think of tokens as pseudo equity. And these are for businesses that have, like you said, a shorter, shorter shelf life. If they were to get listed in Nasdaq, well, first of all, they might not even get listed because they could be casino. But even if they do, like the Wall street are going to be like, it's not sustainable.
00:27:32.650 - 00:28:09.634, Speaker C: Five times earnings, thank you very much. But in crypto land, not only did they get listed, they get massive valuation because people tend to extrapolate how profitable these business can be and give it like 50 times earnings at the first time when you see them. And the lockup schedule generally tends to be shorter than when these business run their course. So I think that ARP is fantastic and I think it's particularly well suited for, especially application businesses that tend to grab eyeballs for these dau and they are the same buyers of these tokens. I feel like this is the arp that we're going to see a lot of the next cycle.
00:28:10.134 - 00:28:10.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:11.534 - 00:28:36.580, Speaker D: One thing, just thinking about one thing I've always struggled with is what is the right kind of PE multiple for a defi network? I mean there's been so much volatility in multiple. Like if you look at, you know, Makerdao, it's traded everywhere from like eight times earnings to like 200 times earnings.
00:28:36.692 - 00:28:37.504, Speaker C: Trailing.
00:28:38.204 - 00:29:35.384, Speaker D: Yeah, trailing or run rate like. Yeah, like, and there's a big difference if you look at like trailing twelve months versus like last three months, annualized versus run rate versus kind of like forward earnings. So there's like volatility in earnings, there's volatility in the multiple. And we can all agree that protocols are unique in terms of they're like there's no capex, there's no opex, so they tend to run it or there's very low opex, so they tend to run at very high kind of. They have very high return on invested capital, they have software, like unit economics, and they can grow incredibly quickly, incredibly capital efficiently. So from that angle, they should trade at very high multiples, because your multiple, you trade, it should be a reflection of many of those factors. Now, on the other hand, they're very difficult to manage and governance is confusing and people get lazy and don't contribute.
00:29:35.384 - 00:30:27.728, Speaker D: Then also some of the moats for these are lower. When you're running your DCF, predicting t plus five earnings for one of these networks is totally, there's a massive variance to that range, and so you have a higher discount rate on those cash flows, and therefore your multiples lower. So you can make arguments for both sides. I don't think anyone really knows the answer to this question. And it also comes down to what is the application you're looking at? Because Friendex, I think, has done what, 2020, $5 million of earnings over the past couple months, or protocol fees. It's like, what is the right multiple for that type of application versus something like GMX versus something like Aave. The answers could be very different.
00:30:27.728 - 00:30:44.244, Speaker D: Just like in the same way that if you look at public equities, tech trades at very different multiples in the energy sector, which trades at a different multiple than CPG, et cetera, its still a big mystery. I just dont think we have enough time or data points to really know the answer to where these things should trade.
00:30:44.284 - 00:32:11.814, Speaker B: Preston, it took a long time to formalize valuation methodologies in public markets like EBITDA and free cash flow, and it took a while. Do you ever think that youre overintellectualizing? Look, I hear you. You look at maker, because the cynical argument here is, do these things, do people trade on, do these things trade on fundamentals? Or is this sort of an attention meme factor and people are going to punt the latest novelty? And I bring this up, Ben, because of course, look, there was a very strong argument that DeFi, which has been in a bear market long before even bitcoin and ETH started to go down, people moved on to gaming and NFts, and if you look at the DeFi charts on an ETH kind of ratio, it's gotten crushed. Meanwhile, you have a lot of Lindy, you have enduring stronger moats for core DeFi protocols, maker, aave compound, even synthetics. There's just a very strong argument on a cash flow basis. The question is, how long are you willing to wait for that thesis to run through while the market is just ripping in your face? Other stuff and people, I mean, do you ever see a comeback? And what's your time horizon? Because it's really tough. I mean, it's tough to kind of see that.
00:32:12.634 - 00:32:52.850, Speaker D: Yeah. So I wish I had a better answer to this question, except for I just got a lot of things wrong. And I definitely. Look, I think that as you extend your holding period and your time horizon, I think the natural gravity of an asset price tends to bend towards fundamentals over time. But the market can ignore fundamentals for short periods of time, even long periods of time, if there's not a catalyst. And also if I think storytelling is really important, um, element of even public equity markets. Right.
00:32:52.850 - 00:33:53.324, Speaker D: It's not like, you know, Google's fundamentals post earnings, you know, changed, you know, like the actual swings in market cap, like, in real time, like the market was kind of adjusting to, like, a new narrative. And so I do think storytelling and things like that will always matter in markets, as will fundamentals. I think right now in crypto, because it's so early and because people are still getting their arms around, like, what is the right fundamental, what is the right metric, or KPI, for these different networks, even understanding and agreeing upon earnings can be very challenging. Like, if you ask three intelligent crypto investors how much earnings ethereum is doing or Makerdao is doing, they may give you three different answers. Because there's no, there are no gap financials, there's no generally accepted accounting principles that standardizes reporting. And so, like, fundamentals can be very subjective as well.
00:33:54.264 - 00:34:24.843, Speaker B: All the more interesting, because I agree with you. There's no, like, accounting, there's no, like, sec, Edgar, Sec database you can go to, but you can see in real time the earnings of these protocols. It's pristine data, it's not tampered. It's not like adjusted EBITDA bullshit. No, it's like they're producing block by block. You're able to see how much loans are outstanding, what the activity is, a user retention at a wallet level. You can do very granular analysis.
00:34:24.843 - 00:34:30.823, Speaker B: But anyways, Jason, I want to go to you because you want to say something.
00:34:30.863 - 00:35:39.274, Speaker C: No, the two things I'll say is, first thing is, I do think even in public markets, the things where when there's no framework, that valuation tends to be all over the place. And then secondly, when the corporate governance is crap, the valuation tends to be all over the place, often at a discount. I think that can be applied to crypto, which is like, yeah, it's going to treasuries, but is that really yours? Token holder. And those that do, assuming there is great certainty, I would think it tends to get repriced faster, what we see with Maker and a buyback. And the second thing is, because the waiting journey is so long, most of them don't have this transfer journey of value capture for very obvious reasons that Gary Gansen doesn't like it. We tend to really only sort of own or trade these things based on the trajectory of earnings growth and KPI, as well as some sort of a catalyst of whether leaving obfuscation or whether enablement failed capture, those tend to work quite well, I think, instead of sitting on it and waiting.
00:35:40.174 - 00:36:13.840, Speaker B: Yeah. One emerging narrative here is real world assets. And I am curious, Ben, I know you want to say something, but maybe we can start talking about what might be the catalysts for some of these things, particularly defi. As you think about, you get a spot ETF approval, the regulatory landscape clears up, maybe have market participants that are more and more inclined. We had the head of JP Morgan here talking about, look, they're really excited, they're building. Ben, you and I were both at permissionless. It feels like corporates.
00:36:13.840 - 00:36:26.094, Speaker B: The interest there hasn't subsided, even though you've had all these blow ups. They're really interested. I think they see the opportunity. It may take a while, but it could be a huge catalyst for something like Defi. But.
00:36:28.074 - 00:37:16.684, Speaker D: Yeah, look, tokenization is something that people have been talking about since 2017 with the security token offerings and companies like Tzero, Polymath harbor. By and large, none of those worked. And I think most of those were like, hey, let's take an illiquid asset like an apartment building in Monaco, let's tokenize it and we'll make it liquid. Because people want to own fractional shares of an apartment building. And people then realize, well, hey, just because you fractionalize something doesn't actually make it liquid. You need demand for those fractional shares. And then I think by and large, the industry moved on and stopped trying to tokenize assets for five or six years because there was so much other stuff getting built in the space.
00:37:16.684 - 00:38:21.864, Speaker D: But this year has been, I think, a huge year for tokenization. And what's surprising to me is it's really all come post FTX. When some institutional interest was waning in the space, you saw Larry Fink basically come out and say that tokenization is the next big wave of capital markets innovation. If you ask like, talk to JP Morgan, if you talk to invesco, wisdom Tree, Hamilton Lane, KKR. Hey, what are you most excited about in the blockchain space? I think eight or nine out of ten times you're going to hear tokenization of real world assets at the top of the list. And you've seen so much activity this year. We count 150 to 200 different team building in this category today, with probably like 500 to 1000 different pilots going on kind of behind that that are launching in the coming couple of years.
00:38:21.864 - 00:39:35.374, Speaker D: And kind of putting aside stable coins, the tokenized RWAs X stablecoins have increased to about $3.5 billion, to up from about 1.6 billion at the beginning of the year in a mix of tokenized gold, tokenized treasuries, tokenized LP stakes and funds. So we're seeing tokenization of traditional assets. And then the other really fascinating category is tokenization of non financial assets. So you saw the California DMV tokenize 14 million automobile titles. You're seeing tokenization of university diplomas, identity credentials, tokenization of things like concert tickets, tokenization of litigation, finance claims, emerging market receivables, kind of these other assets that are valuable but don't have the same kind of established capital markets infrastructure that bonds, equities, currencies and commodities have, and similar.
00:39:35.374 - 00:40:55.214, Speaker D: These asset classes that the longer tail that have been neglected, I think are going to be some of the first assets to come on chain. In the same way that this is not a great analogy, but in the same way that China jumped right to mobile payments, it skipped over legacy payment infrastructure. I think a lot of these assets are just going to skip over legacy financial market infrastructure with banks and move right on chain. There's a lot more to unpack here, but I really see this as being the only way that crypto will be relevant is if we can tokenize real world assets and they're the main substrate that's flowing through applications, DeFi protocols, et cetera. I wouldn't be surprised. I would not be surprised if in two to three years from now, when people evaluate layer ones and applications, the most important metric will be TVL of real world assets, as opposed to when you look at TVL and DeFi llama of Solana, it includes staked soul, which is more endogenous to the Solana ecosystem. It's not really.
00:40:55.214 - 00:41:06.596, Speaker D: It's a bit more circular. So I just think this theme is incredibly important. I'm excited about it. I think there's a lot of momentum and I don't think it's going to. It's definitely feels like it's accelerating right now.
00:41:06.740 - 00:41:52.428, Speaker B: Yeah. The big aha moment for me is I was thinking of like Uniswap allowed you to get price discovery on a whole tail end of assets through an AMM model. And certainly there were a lot of skeptics that said a centralized order book model is far superior, but missed the point that you just opened up, you just create a new market and the ability for anyone to be a market maker. I think the stuff like Maple and some others I think conceptually makes sense, like centrifuge. But where I have struggled is the general unsophistication of the teams and underwriting risk. They're not professionals and I think you see time and time again, whereas I'm more excited to see a really solid team. Ben, you came from credit at KKR.
00:41:52.428 - 00:42:58.486, Speaker B: Like, where's the KKR credit team coming in and saying, hey, let's actually apply into underwriting and just put it on chain. Because if you're just like settling these things in an atomic manner and opening up a capital markets in a global manner, or like a arc sort of permission kind of environment, if you will, settling on a permissionless kind of l one. But that feels to me like a killer use case where even now everyone's talking about private credit. And I think companies are, there's a whole tail end of companies that have struggled to get access to capital and maybe you could do that in a more efficient manner if you turn to defi. I just think that there hasn't been a killer team that is very sharp in underwriting these things because they've failed experiments, I think for a lot of these kind of more tech focused teams. But I think you require your brain, your KKR credit brain, kind of like. And that's what has been missing of some of these teams, I think.
00:42:58.590 - 00:43:42.142, Speaker D: Yeah, blockchain technology is definitely not a panacea for bad judgment or underwriting. If you have a borrower that defaults because their business goes bad, the blockchain can't solve that and they can't have. So I think ultimately you're actually starting to see a lot of private credit funds just really think about the blockchain as more efficient. Rails to send interest payments, securitize, disintermediate fund administrators, and servicing agents and collateral agents. They're doing what they normally do, but sitting on top of, you know, a blockchain for. For efficiency, um, and transparency too.
00:43:42.158 - 00:44:30.654, Speaker B: I mean, I think presumably you could price these things more efficiently and you can measure risk in real time. Like the big aha moment for me and Jason, I want to turn to you next. But the big aha moment for me was you remember, like, we were looking at Nexus, and Nexus coverage was grossly under, like, it was like the most inefficiently thing priced on chain. Um, and utilization was a big part of that. But the idea that the Nexus team was underwriting the risk of these defi protocols just made absolutely no sense. Whereas you could have argued, just let the market decide, and Andre being Andre, tokenized Nexus like coverage, right, and put a wrapper on it, and the market was freely trading these things, and that gave you a much better understanding. That was like a CDs.
00:44:30.654 - 00:45:06.934, Speaker B: It would have told you exactly what the market, whether you believe it, efficient or not. But it was a better mechanism to price risk of these various protocols. And I still think of that as like, why haven't we tapped into more of that? Like, it just feels to me like you could price not just digitally native stuff, but like a receivable of company in whatever market. Like totally. The key unlock here is there's more transparency. It's 24/7 market. There's more capital flowing in and out of these things.
00:45:06.934 - 00:45:15.798, Speaker B: The price should be a better reflection of risk. And that opens up a whole variety of instruments. If you do everything on chain, this.
00:45:15.846 - 00:46:05.134, Speaker A: Episode is brought to you by Chronicle protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data. For anyone who listens to empire a lot, you know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle Pro protocol is this novel Oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for maker and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, super excited to share here that Chronicle's oracle service is now publicly available for anyone to use. Compared to using other oracle services, Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees. They have an unparalleled level of transparency. Transparency at Chronicle, they offer a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides, marking this milestone in on chain data availability.
00:46:05.134 - 00:46:38.794, Speaker A: Chronicle is endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, gitcoin, Duidx and Makerdao. It is time for a paradigm shift in oracle development, a future where data is verifiable, operational costs are contained, and the possibilities are immense. You can learn more about chronicle@chroniclelabs.org. That is chroniclelabs.org dot, the product you already know and love and have probably used for years. Metamask just got even better. I want to tell you about metamask portfolio.
00:46:38.794 - 00:47:13.414, Speaker A: If you're like santinme, managing your crypto assets across a bunch of different wallets and networks can be overwhelming. And it can be complicated. That's why I'm excited that Metamask portfolio has partnered with Empire. It's really easy to get started. Just connect your metamask wallet to get a bird's eye view of all your coins, tokens and nfts in one place. You can easily buy, sell, swap, bridge, and stake your crypto assets at competitive rates, all within the metamask app from a vetted list of providers, the metamask portfolio lets you do more your way. Hit the link in the description of today's episode to get started.
00:47:15.514 - 00:47:29.214, Speaker C: Like, is there anything else that gets you really excited? And you're like, oh, in the next twelve months, this will hit a billion dollars. And I'm super jazzed about this RWA vertical. Like, is there anything like that today that you think is pretty exciting? I don't mean to put you on the spot, but.
00:47:29.754 - 00:48:03.634, Speaker D: Yeah, no, no, no. Good question. So, yeah, there's. So I think, like, the longer tail of asset classes is where a lot of people say, look like us, treasuries are the next logical thing to come on chain because it's a $33 trillion market and we have 120 billion of stable coins today that pay 0%. So if you can capture 10%, 20%, 30% of that market, that's quite logical, and I think that will happen. But I think the actual, the longer tail is more interesting. There's a team.
00:48:03.634 - 00:49:02.964, Speaker D: It's actually fascinating. There's a team that's. So if you're a creator on YouTube and you post a YouTube video, like how to tie your shoes or how to fix your microwave, and maybe you have like a few million views, and you'll get a check from YouTube every month for $100 to $200 or some amount, right. Based on views and subscribes. So you have these creators on YouTube that are getting paid every month, and that's a meaningful kind of somewhat uncorrelated to the broader business cycle, macroeconomy kind of cash flow stream. And so there's a company that's effectively kind of going to creators and saying, hey, we'll buy kind of 49% or some percent of these future cash flows, which are kind of modelable and predictable. And so you can kind of take a lump sum up front and then we kind of participate pro rata going forward.
00:49:02.964 - 00:49:36.132, Speaker D: And that's the type of asset class, and this is just one example. I think, like many of things that don't exist on Wall street, don't exist in traditional capital markets, but are the types of asset classes that could be very interesting on chain because you can kind of get transparency around payments, that this is basically a securitization. So you can, all the monthly cash flows can get kind of distributed on chain. And I think it's almost like the.
00:49:36.148 - 00:49:44.104, Speaker C: Youtuber issued a token or it's like the company's listed but you're not having list, that you kind of just are buying those. I see that.
00:49:45.284 - 00:50:11.794, Speaker B: What about like miner rewards or validator rewards? I mean, that to me is you just look at, okay, if ETH is the staking rates can be, you model out a participation rate and you say, okay, if you're a validator or you're a filecoin miner, whatever, you could securitize those and then sell them off. Right. And the same with the bitcoin miners. Do this effectively off chain, but you could do this and it could be a huge market on chain.
00:50:12.134 - 00:50:50.314, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm surprised that, because I'm surprised that that market hasn't gotten bigger, because if you look at. I totally agree. If you look at Ethereum, it's a $220 billion asset, let's say 5% staking yield a year. That's like $10 billion of cash flows. You may have effectively an interest rate swap for staking yield. Being able to pull it forward, I think is incredibly logical. I know there are some teams that are kind of working on this, but it doesn't feel like there's been much as much traction there.
00:50:52.654 - 00:51:20.704, Speaker B: As you say that interest rate swaps. What is going on in terms of. I am still perplexed as to why DeFi rates are lower than tradfi rates. Is that just indicative of. And Ben, I know that you guys play a lot in the credit side of things, stablecoin, ARB and whatnot, but how do you see that? And I'm surprised that the ARB exists. Is that just indicative of, like, no one wants to take smart contract risk and it's just too much friction. You can't do it at scale.
00:51:20.704 - 00:51:26.824, Speaker B: At what point are we going to see rates in DeFi be more indicative of just. They should be higher than tradfi.
00:51:27.404 - 00:52:08.314, Speaker D: So I think it's a function. It's the same reason why there's still 120 billion of stablecoins in DeFi that are earning zero. I think there's captive capital from a regulatory arbitrage standpoint that does not want to reenter the fiat world. And so there's a glut of stablecoin supply combined with less demand to borrow on chain. Given where we are in the market cycle. And that is creating an environment where Defi rates are lower than tradfi rates. I think in the past six months you've seen them catch up.
00:52:08.314 - 00:53:10.346, Speaker D: If you look at USDC rates on AVI and compound, I think that's in part a function of the reverse RWA trade, which is now on Makerdao. The DAi savings rate is 5%. And you can put Dai into the DSR, earn 5%. And the reason why this works for Makerdao is they've set up entities that are taking capital, USDC capital, putting it in treasuries, five and a half percent, earning like really slim margin on it. And so because Dai and USDC are fungible one to one, if you look at like lending rates are kind of converging to that level in on Defi. So I think in general we should see relative parity going forward between Defi and tradfi rates. I think initially go back to 2020, the plain vanilla lending rate on compound was like 15% to 20% when rates were zero.
00:53:10.346 - 00:53:40.878, Speaker D: And it's because people were like, oh, this is smart contract risk. This is really scary that as the Lindy played out, people got less scared and then things inverted. And I think they're now, I don't think we're going to see, I could be totally wrong on this, but I don't think we're going to see major as much volatility in terms of the difference between tradfi and Defi rates going forward at this point. I don't know if Jason or you would disagree with that, but yeah, in a steady state.
00:53:41.046 - 00:54:21.696, Speaker B: But I don't know when we get there, what should we talk about next, guys? I mean, we talked about tokenization. We talked about Defi. Jason, you've been a bit quiet, but I'm curious, what are you paying attention to? What are the catalysts that you're seeing? I remember, so I'll give Jason incredible credit because as breakpoint is coming up in Amsterdam, Solana feels like it's having a renaissance moment. I think they've, as a phoenix rising from the ashes, this whole putting behind the whole FTX, Sam, kind of relation attachment, unfair. I think it was. And there's a lot of excitement. I think there's a lot of resurgence there.
00:54:21.696 - 00:54:50.748, Speaker B: Price kind of reflects that. But we were in breakpoint in Lisbon. I think it was two, three years ago, Jason, you were starting foliage and you were sitting on a lot of cash. You just raised the fund. And this is when every day you had a God candle the market was ripping towards the end and we were talking about how you would allocate this capital, which felt like it was late in the cycle, but you just didn't know when the music was going to stop. And you were incredibly disciplined because you held the line. You said, I don't want to invest.
00:54:50.748 - 00:55:38.894, Speaker B: It just feels like I'm not being, there's just too much risk. And I think it's incredibly hard to do that, especially when everything is ripping. And now you're in a situation where perhaps a lot of people are sidelined. They just turned the pendulum, as Howard Marks says, swung to the other extreme where people don't want, like, they pivoted to AI. They've sitting on a lot of cash. They say, hey, I'm just going to chill in treasuries and I want to survive. How are you thinking about allocating, putting risk back on the table and getting more exposure? Because I think it is easy, I think, to ride the wave up, but it's also perhaps even more challenging deciding when to really step up and buy in size.
00:55:38.894 - 00:56:03.134, Speaker B: Maybe a lot of people are questioning now, oh, maybe I missed it, because, by the way, bitcoin and ETH have rallied substantially since the beginning of the year. So the question is Nasdaqs turning weak, the market may, broader market may take a crap. What is that going to do to crypto? I think weve all learned the lesson, for better or for worse, that this is not an uncorrelated asset class. Im curious.
00:56:03.714 - 00:56:13.470, Speaker C: There are many factors. Let me just start by saying I think personality play a big part of it. I think some are just entirely more aggressive. Im more introverted and timid. It's easier for me in a bear.
00:56:13.502 - 00:56:21.750, Speaker B: Market than, it wouldn't appear that way just by looking at your Twitter profile. But maybe that's your way of channeling your extrovertedness. Yeah.
00:56:21.862 - 00:56:49.232, Speaker C: The only part of degeneres here for me is on Twitter. Well, I think public and private are different. I think founders at seed stage dictating their own destiny is very different. It doesn't almost matter what macro does. So Q two and Q three had been our busiest quarter so far since our inception. In privates, we wrote our largest check in Q three ever. We let deals.
00:56:49.232 - 00:57:16.412, Speaker C: We didn't leave deals before. The check size that we wrote in private had stepped up from previously, a quarter million, half million up to like multimillion dollar checks. Now we are planning to raise more capital and be even more aggressive on the private side because we think some of these exposures on two cN. You just can't get them in public domain. You have to do it private. And because we can now take the whole round and people recognize our brand, we should really press into it. I need one more success to really cement this reputation.
00:57:16.412 - 00:57:45.114, Speaker C: Raise the big financials, corning our market. That's the plan. In Asia, a lot of the focus are around things that can get massive Dau and can benefit from web through recursive way of growth, mostly Ponzi. Hopefully they will have a way to cement that growth path. And when it comes to large dau, it invariably is various type of social entertainment products. So there's no surprise that I like where friend tech is going. I think a social trading app in similar flavor could be pretty big.
00:57:45.114 - 00:58:21.214, Speaker C: We're looking at a live streaming deal very aggressively. We're looking at like casino gambling deals very aggressively. And then on a gaming side, there are multiple vectors of large daU categories, like mobile FPS, like sort of MOBA, like casual games that we're just spending a lot of time on Ico and our team can speak to that. But I think we're going to continue to be aggressive on the private side. On a public side, I think my biggest fear is that the two overhang had been binance versus DOJ and then credit event in the US. Those two things would send us off. In the worst case, maybe 20% to 40% ish.
00:58:21.214 - 00:58:49.686, Speaker C: In the best case, nothing happens. I think running a fund, we are watching for Mark to market drawdowns. But if those don't happen, or if they were to happen, I think one needs to be ready to buy that dip. Because when a credit event in the US happens, I think that's when QE turns on. I think you need to hold no cash and just go all in risk assets. Right now we are playing this period where you're riding this ETF catalyst. There's a bit more catalyst left.
00:58:49.686 - 00:59:14.508, Speaker C: And Yves going to year end. It seems like the year will be good. So people might want to put on risk into an end of year bonus across different funds. So the flow could be beneficial. But I think for us next year, we are bracing ourselves for a bit of a shock at some point in the first half. And when this gun has been shot by the fed about QE, I think it's just. There will be zero dollar cash in phones.
00:59:14.508 - 00:59:40.264, Speaker C: It's just purely bitcoin and eve as cash. And then sort of the deployment into small cap private liquids has already begun. I think we're probably five to 10% into small cap privates. And that percentage is only going up because some of these deals, some of these liquid names have already approached sort of series a and c stage valuation. That's like over. I'm going to pause there.
00:59:41.524 - 01:00:31.494, Speaker D: One question I wanted to get your thoughts on. Jason is just the gaming sector and you've had some really good calls there, as have both of you have stepn illuvium, et cetera. What I'm curious about is you've seen a lot of web two incumbents building games with blockchain elements. You've seen some new gaming studios and people for the past couple of years have been saying, hey, we're waiting for the one game to bring a bunch of users into the space. Do you think that we'll be. I guess. How do you see the evolution of blockchain gaming? Finding product market fit? And do you think it's an incumbent or an upstart that is the first to market?
01:00:32.034 - 01:00:54.414, Speaker C: I can take this. Unless sense you want to. I'll take it. I think gaming as an entertainment form is hard. Get something wrong, the whole thing falls apart. I will also say we haven't seen success yet because the production value itself hasn't even matched a bare minimum of entertainment, quote unquote. So no one's going to play that crap.
01:00:54.414 - 01:01:18.794, Speaker C: It's not fun. You can swipe. Tick tock. I think there are two types of games that could take off in the next cycle. I don't think any of them will come from large studios. I think it is predominantly a vc backed sort of look, it can even come from a single man shop, one to five people, they figure it out. But it's like a sub 20 million investment criteria.
01:01:18.794 - 01:01:47.426, Speaker C: And there are two ways this would happen. This would be either production value and by the way, in both cases, production value has to match a bare minimum of entertainment standards. It has to be somewhat similar to web two, but it cannot be that much over because these teams don't have resource. A and it's easy to over spec with production value, therefore ignoring the web3 aspect. But once it meets those criteria, two ways to capitalize. Number one, this is a very proven category. People know how to play these things.
01:01:47.426 - 01:02:34.000, Speaker C: Massive tam 50 million dau. Okay, great. So the web3 component comes in and do three things, which is a lot of people in blocked off countries can play it through stable coins or through ponzi way of acquisition. You significantly reduce your cash cost of acquisition. And then number three, your ARPU goes up significantly because there is financial speculation and those categories, I think by a studio who have done it before in web two can handle a dau and putting the web through spin and taking all the elements of Ponzi and speculation and take rate. I think that can succeed. And those category, namely fall into competitive games such as gambling, FPS, mobile and so on and so forth.
01:02:34.000 - 01:03:23.054, Speaker C: For example, the other category, I think it also needs to be new teams, but it's something that is just out of left field, very new. Like the production value could be lower, but they're just trying something so crazy and different. I have to say, gas here as an example, like built by Stepan. SLG itself is a very small category globally. But things like Clash of clan people still played with a very long time span. Now, their insight there is that, look, if you conquer somebody else's country instead of before, where you actually kind of get clout, you actually take their taxation on rights on their people. And what if in this game we all play with money, like real money on blockchain? We sort of felt like the king, this equivalent would get so much more dopamine out of it that they might be willing to spend a lot of our people.
01:03:23.054 - 01:03:44.724, Speaker C: In that case, I think we could make a lot of money from building this game. And it doesn't have to be like, so production value heavy. And then that game itself would not even be like a traditional SLG equivalent. You have to design new mechanisms around it, and it wouldn't take that much to build. I think they come under like $7 million. Based on Jerry's forecast, I think those two categories can really hit.
01:03:45.384 - 01:04:09.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with that from my vantage point. I think as a general comment, in a bear market, people are very quick to dismiss failed starts or early starts. And it's hard for the market to look at something. Maybe it's tokenization. You talk about risk harbor and some others. It's real this time. The infrastructure is different, the market's different, and people turn very skeptical with gaming.
01:04:09.690 - 01:04:55.034, Speaker B: I think people look at Axie and look at Stepn and look at the token price and say, it didn't work. This play to earn category does not work. There is some credence to that because to Jason's point, some of these games were just not fun to play and it was more work. But I do think that there's two very different kind of games. One is your Call of Duty. World of Warcraft takes years to produce, very capital intensive, which there are teams that are trying to build in that category, and layer on some crypto elements, particularly nfts, is really a really powerful rapper to a lot of good, this stuff. And the in game economy, which I would argue a lot of teams have experimented with that, but there's a lot of improvement that could be done there.
01:04:55.034 - 01:05:39.654, Speaker B: And then there's a fast casual. The fast casual is actually probably the one that takes off faster. And I've invested in a few teams that, particularly from Scandinavia, like Finland, just like this is where Angry Birds came out. And as a very vibrant gaming and some really good talent, saying, hey, we need five $7 million adjacent point and we can do a fast casual type of game. And if you layer on the NFT component to that, it just adds another element where a gamer, if you assume to Jason's point, you have feature parity if the experience is very much the same. Web two, web3. If you're a gamer, you start earning nfts.
01:05:39.654 - 01:06:35.938, Speaker B: It's a small thing, but I think it does matter. And you could acquire way more users and retain them because mind you, if you look at gaming as a category has been really like candy Crush, for instance, 90 plus percent of their earnings come from 1% of the users, which is crazy. And the half life of these games, look at Zynga, the vast majority of their games just are huge success. They print like 20, $30 million a month and then after six months, no one plays them. So the retention and the half life of these games is really challenged, which I think you sort of assume that's going to be the case in Web three. Perhaps you may have stronger retention, and even a marginal increase in retention is enough to really kind of like produce outside wins if you're investing at the right valuation. That's why I'm excited in the category because I fundamentally think that people, particularly now, are saying this is a broken category.
01:06:35.938 - 01:07:28.438, Speaker B: You're never going to have a sustainable in game economy. I'm like, well, how's any different from gaming, period? Like, that's just the category. If you're a gaming investor and you assume that, that's like, in my operating assumption, it's always going to be like, most of these games are going to have a very short lifespan, half life, and struggle with the retention. But nfts really serve, and the speculation of that is a super powerful substrate like incentive for gamers to stick around. And, you know, I just think that that's what the market is overlooking right now because they have totally dismissed the play to earn category, which, by the way, I think is possible to have play to earn if the game is fun. The problem is you haven't had a very fun game, but you will. Now, I'm not saying you should go out and invest in a billion dollar FTV kind of token, like absolute fucking literally not.
01:07:28.438 - 01:08:13.256, Speaker B: But I'm looking at stuff at five. Like a team that X counter Strike X Angry Birds raising at a $7 million fully diluted valuation needs $3 million. Yeah, I'll do that deal any day of the week. Yeah, I mean, like. But yeah, some of these games are going to take time. The other thing is like, is the infrastructure ready? And you could argue, are you better off investing in a web two game that can layer some of the elements? Because if you're a game like Illuvium, for instance, not everything needs to settle on chain, right? You can play the game. In fact, they actually.
01:08:13.256 - 01:09:02.486, Speaker B: What's interesting from Illuvium, and this is just one example I think other games are adopting, this is you have an l two find it's cheaper, but you can play the game and not even think about anything crypto related, which I think that the real good games will just allow any user to, on their mobile or on pc, play the game and then say, hey, you want to cash out your rewards or you want to earn these rewards and you got to set up automatically with account abstraction, like create a wallet, allow you to get access to these things. But that's the. I think the smart teams I've seen say we're going to build a game. It is going to have crypto to it, but there is a version where you don't even have to think about crypto. That's not the main hook. It's gaming plus, not crypto plus game. I don't know if that kind of.
01:09:02.486 - 01:09:19.105, Speaker B: So whereas, like Axie was like, not to, you know, shit on Axie, but it was like, we're crypto. Like, this is a crypto and then added on with some gaming component, like with some crypto, like with some gaming components. And I think the best teams are just very much like gaming experts.
01:09:19.209 - 01:09:49.833, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I think that's. I think that's really insightful. I, you know, one. One observation I've had is, yeah, like, to kind of be successful in this category, you have to build a game that people want to play and then you also have to get the kind of token integrations and elements right. And I've been kind of interested in, like, the more classic games to mitigate that first risk. So things like chess, scrabble, connect four, like backgammon, et cetera. Because you're not taking any.
01:09:49.833 - 01:10:23.666, Speaker D: People love playing those games. They're the most popular games in the world. You can play them online, they're huge communities around them, and then you can kind of get all the benefits of getting nfts, driving community cohesion and other forms of value. With the token, I think we could see, I've chatted with some of those kind of gaming teams and they haven't done much with tokens, but I think that's the other interesting area.
01:10:23.850 - 01:10:29.402, Speaker B: Well, Ben, I mean, you're pretty good at chess. I think you won. Didn't you win this crypto?
01:10:29.498 - 01:10:42.108, Speaker D: I peaked, I lost to, I won the consolation bracket, which is like, I don't want to. That's like, yeah, let's envision a friend.
01:10:42.156 - 01:10:47.332, Speaker B: Tech kind of version where you're playing chess and you have these points. Right? Like what's a, what's a rating?
01:10:47.428 - 01:10:48.744, Speaker D: Yeah, ratings. Yeah.
01:10:49.524 - 01:10:57.684, Speaker B: Say that you could potentially, like a cameo type where if you get to a certain point, you could even play and get access to Magnus. Magnus, was it? Carlson.
01:10:57.764 - 01:10:58.148, Speaker D: Carlson.
01:10:58.196 - 01:11:13.974, Speaker B: The number one player in the world. Like if you had a game that like you get him on board and you could, through nfts, like you could, you could like token, you can make it fun, but you can also get access to playing games with like pros and you could settle in stable coins. Like, to me, it feels like a pretty cool thing to do.
01:11:14.274 - 01:11:58.580, Speaker C: It would be, yeah, exactly. I think the key is not alter the chess itself. You know, just like if one exact, I've seen teams adding nfts on top chess pieces and it becomes your pon can do certain things. I think it just breaks the game. So like, and then it's like, how do you add web through components? I think there's a certain element of negative Ev gambling as well as various types of cosmetics that need to come on top of it. If the game itself cannot be altered to the extent that you want to acquire, users already play game on a different platform. It would probably have to be some sort of web3 ponzonomics because otherwise the cash spend on these things would be ridiculous.
01:11:58.580 - 01:12:38.900, Speaker C: Except they already have fun playing chess elsewhere. You know, it's worth trying. But there are things we sort of figure out along the way, which is for different categories, what three components they should incorporate. In the case of chess, for example, it's like add Ponzi at gambling, at cosmetics, decorating yourself, and then make it mobile first. And then just drive aggressively. And then definitely make sure you raise enough capital to put up like a huge prize pool and then out compete the top ones and really issue your token equity celebrities. That's how I would run it.
01:12:39.012 - 01:13:31.852, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think if you can build a good community, and I think time and time again we've seen projects that through NFTs have been able to certainly build good communities. Now your point around negative ev is really good one because I am skeptical of a lot of things where as soon as you introduce a price component to that, like if you're buying like a music NFT and then that collapses in value 90%, does that make you hate the artist because you've lost all this money? Like, I don't. I think Taylor Swift is perfectly fine without having any financialization to any of the stuff that she does. She can, you know, and maybe swifties might hate her as soon as you introduce a price to that. And that may be negative EB for someone like Taylor Swift, but that doesn't mean that all artists are going to experience that same thing. You maybe, perhaps can build an NFT without, I don't know, like more of like a badge without any value. I think when you try to build communities, I'm really sensitive around.
01:13:31.852 - 01:14:07.746, Speaker B: As soon as you start putting a price to these things, I'd be worried like if I, if I were an artist, I would think twice about like having value ascribed to a lot of these things. Because maybe the beauty in a lot of these things is not having a real time price component and speculation to it. Ben, you brought up polymarket in our side chat. Full disclosure, we're investors in polymarket, but prediction markets as a category has been one of those. Like Auger. When we first met Ben, Auger was like Auger V two was all the rage, and Auger v one kind of didn't work. It was really clunky.
01:14:07.746 - 01:14:27.306, Speaker B: But also you didn't have stable coins. And the minute you have stable coins to be able to settle these bets, it was like a huge unlock. Now, Augur specifically, I think just as a team just was inferior. But then in came along polymarket. And I bring this up because for two things, I want to get both of your opinions on prediction markets. Elections are coming up. There's a whole host of things.
01:14:27.306 - 01:15:00.544, Speaker B: I think they're getting some pretty interesting traction. And second, as just information oracles, particularly when the Wall Street Journal and other media just have really botched, there's no truth there anymore. And the second one is a more important theme, which is what are some failed experiments in blockchain spaces which is littered that are worth revisiting, because the infrastructure l two s stablecoins is just different. And that might warrant you to make an investment in some, like poly market.
01:15:02.044 - 01:16:10.872, Speaker D: Yeah, you were talking earlier about letting markets price risk instead of a single human price risk in the event of an nexus. And I think that markets and wisdom of the crowds is one of the most powerful forces of truth. And if you look at markets we have today, you can bet on the price of Amazon stock, you can bet on the price of a bushel of corn, you can bet on the price of gold, currencies, commodities, stocks and bonds. But you can't express financial views around at size around many different markets in the world. And so what's fascinating about a prediction market is on chain, is that anyone can. And just to define what a prediction market is, it's typically like a market that is called a binary market, trades between zero and one, where people, a market will become. You get paid out one if an event happens and zero if it doesn't happen.
01:16:10.872 - 01:16:47.444, Speaker D: So will a Republican be elected in the 2024 presidential election that may trade between zero and one, based on kind of the market's probabilistic view of that happening. So what's kind of fascinating is these are really oracles of truth, and in a way that we really haven't seen in traditional financial markets. These can be used for bets on politics, bets on weather, bets on kind of coronavirus case counts, bets on.
01:16:49.784 - 01:16:50.120, Speaker B: Will.
01:16:50.152 - 01:17:46.640, Speaker D: We bets on just kind of orthogonal things that don't have capital markets, and they can be used for insurance as well. So if you're a soybean farmer in Iowa, you can make a bet on will there be less than x inches of rainfall in the harvest season in Iowa, and kind of create a market? And you can bet that, yes, there will be less than that amount of rain, and that kind of implicitly serves as kind of a form of insurance. And so I think these prediction markets have been tried before, and they're centralized prediction markets, but because of regulation, the actual amount you can bet on them is capped. And also, you're generally taking counterparty risk. You're sending your money into an offshore entity. The amount you can bet on a specific market is capped. Only certain markets are offered as well.
01:17:46.640 - 01:18:24.886, Speaker D: So you can't create your own market. And so, decentralized prediction markets solve a lot of those problems. And we saw this even with augur, which had a terrible ux, there were actually several million dollars that were bet on in the 2020 midterm elections. Will Republicans or Democrats take a majority of the House and people were betting in size on this, and it was the only place in the world you could really bet in size on an event like that. I'm a big believer that prediction markets are. I think they've been left for dead. I think they're going to be huge.
01:18:24.886 - 01:18:46.924, Speaker D: And I think the tam on them is underrated quite large, because prediction markets can be basically an alternative form of a derivative. And the derivatives markets is measured in the, in the quadrillion dollars, which is one with 15 zeros behind it. So it's really, I think, targets like a very, very big tam.
01:18:48.864 - 01:19:14.804, Speaker B: How do you scale that? Because I think the challenge has been matching both say everyone believes in one type of outcome, but scaling these things has been somewhat challenged. What do you attribute that to? Is that just the friction of crypto? Is that regulation? Or is that just there's a whole tail end of things that you find it hard to find someone to take the counter trade?
01:19:16.144 - 01:20:14.482, Speaker D: Yeah, look, I think it's a combination. I think it's just the fact that the UX of these platforms isn't great. There may be a few thousand users of polymarket in a given day, but it's still, even notwithstanding that, it's still the most liquid kind of market to bet on these things. There's just nowhere else to express bets and find a global market of people willing to take the other side. I think there are experiments around, hey, should we have some sort of amm curve, or should these be structured as a kind of central limit order book, or should it be a hybrid? So there's some kind of marginal tweaking around how to make these things liquid, ultimately you need people to take the other side of the bet, so there is some constraint there. But as people, as the UX gets easier, as people learn about products like this, just sports betting, I think, is a huge tam. I don't have the numbers at my fingertip tips, but we did a deep dive into this.
01:20:14.482 - 01:20:51.894, Speaker D: And the amount of money bet on sports globally every year is surprisingly large. And it's done through centralized, uncredit worthy offshore entities. And I imagine the tam for other kind of non athletic events could also be very large. And those markets really don't exist today. So I really think it's just a matter of time. And augur, I think, was an idea that was just too early and it kind of fizzled out. And I'm confident in.
01:20:51.894 - 01:21:04.134, Speaker D: I think what polymarket has built is quite interesting. And whether it's them or someone else, I think this category is going to be quite meaningful.
01:21:06.634 - 01:21:55.954, Speaker C: Well, I don't disagree with Ben. The only thing I would say is I thought about this traffic for these kind of tick rate based betting sites is very high. When somebody put dollars into a casino, the ARPU is proven to be, I don't know, $150 to $1,000 per person, thereby driving the customer acquisition costs, cash costs to be quite high. And for something like Polymark to acquire users, if they do it the traditional way, they face a very typical problem where betting on the outcome of events is a very classic constrained maturity, low frequency event. Like it's almost, you need a coincidence of want there. It's like I want to. Either I want to bet on something I search, or it's like I somehow land on a website, but there's nothing I want to bet on.
01:21:55.954 - 01:22:44.144, Speaker C: And when I say maturity, it's like, usually there's like an end date to these bets. So it like it's constrained by creativity and it's constrained by like how many of these cool things are happening at once. And it's like low frequency. Because maybe for most people depend on these things once or twice a year, whereby for something like gambling, I mean people gamble like twenty four seven and there's no maturity. They just like, they start, they end, they lose money. I feel like for a prediction market like this, it's probably best suited under a gambling negative ev gambling site. It would make a lot of sense, for example, for rollbit to have a prediction market so that the people who land on it and already know it would meaningfully increase their ARPU through this subsector.
01:22:44.144 - 01:23:12.606, Speaker C: And that the CAC spend that they have would have a sort of bigger bang for the buck. Because even if they don't land for prediction, they sort of bet somewhere else that the website still makes money. Aside from the UI Ux, which I completely agree with, I think that's like a big reason none of this shit has worked. And I think whoever takes the crown in the end might be like, once we solve all the Uix issues, like on chain casino, that's like fair. And then with a prediction sort of subsector component to it. Personal.
01:23:12.710 - 01:23:59.304, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the insurance point that you make, Ben, is really fascinating because I think that might be a good angle to get much more traction. If you find a person that is thinking about risk at the point of sale, say that you all of a sudden get paid in stablecoins and you don't know this thing, but you could bet on it, not depegging you're not going to think about it two days after you get paid. But if at the time that you get paid you have the option to buy some insurance, which might cost you a penny, that might settle on the prediction market, right, because you're betting on the outcome. But you have to think about risk at the point of sale. When you buy a car, you need to buy car insurance. That's by regulation.
01:23:59.304 - 01:24:30.864, Speaker B: Flood insurance on the other hand, not so much. And people don't buy flood insurance until their house gets flooded. So it's a much smaller market. And so in a similar matter, I've always felt that like we've talked to Stani like, or Robert like at Aave compound, like just roll it in. When you're opening a CDP, when you're opening, when you're lending or borrowing, you are taking some risk. That's when people are thinking about it. Well then allow me to bet on the direction, either yes or no, whatever the binary outcome is in a particular timeframe.
01:24:30.864 - 01:25:00.274, Speaker B: That's when, if you're a prediction market, it felt to me like that's where you can get some traction on chain. Go to the more edgier defi protocols, go to the more edgy or whatever, and just make, when you're buying an NFT, like whatever, just at that time you have to insert yourself in that flow. When the consumer is thinking about risk because they just made a shiny purchase. Well insure it. I think that's where you can get much more volume flowing into something like polymarket and you can just create these markets on an ongoing basis.
01:25:00.574 - 01:25:35.456, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. I think that's a great point. The other thing I would just mention is one of the big issues with insurance is counterparty risk. If you bought an insurance policy from AIG, if you bought CDs on Lehman from AIG, well it's not a good insurance policy. So the beauty of having this on chain is all of the capital is escrowed. So it's actually, it's insurance without counterparty risk to the insurer, which if someone's like buying insurance and really think about the downside scenarios that that's actually like kind of quite, quite important in terms.
01:25:35.480 - 01:26:08.348, Speaker B: Of mitigating like say you have like a million dollars in binance. Well there's a market in poly market that says will binance go insolvent at any point in time? Pick your point in time. Maybe you have a perk, but just a point in time. Well heck, as a fiduciary you want to maybe hedge your bets. Now the question is, what's the price of that? And even maybe just the. Because we talk about here, we ask the question, oh, is binance and some deep shit or not? Are they going to settle for a billion dollars or not? Whatever. Well, as opposed to just talking about it.
01:26:08.348 - 01:26:48.934, Speaker B: Well, it would be really interesting to point to a market and say, hey, the market thinks that, like finance, there's a 75 80% probability binance is going to continue to live and do that. That alone is really insightful information. And even at the wall, you talk about privacy. Maybe that's a challenge thing, but with better privacy, you might say, hey, there's this very big entity that is betting the binance. All of a sudden yesterday, someone bet that it was going to go and solve it. Well, what do they know? And that alone is super insightful when you start tick by tick understanding which market participants are long or short or betting on a particular outcome.
01:26:51.194 - 01:27:10.254, Speaker D: I'm looking at polymarket right now. There are markets, will there be in Israel and Hamas ceasefire by November 30? Who will be the speaker of the House? These are really impactful. These can actually be used topical financial views.
01:27:12.424 - 01:27:36.788, Speaker B: Expert opinion is totally overvalued here. Like economic forecast. In my mind, there's no credibility that give me a market and tell me how much volume there is behind a particular outcome. I'd take that over any macro economic forecaster. CNBC, Bloomberg, there's all bullshit. People just talk out of their ass. Okay, you're betting a million dollars on Hamas, not on this ceasefire.
01:27:36.788 - 01:27:39.504, Speaker B: Okay, well, then that's different.
01:27:40.164 - 01:28:13.824, Speaker D: There's this famous story on wisdom of the crowds about this statistician in the 19th century that brought an ox to this kind of town fair. And he guessed. He asked everyone to guess the weight of the ox. And I think the ox weighed 1190 pounds. And the average of the 800 guesses was like 1100, and it was like one pound less, like. But even the experts, like people that deal with Oxs on a day to day basis like they were farmers, except like, they were get. They weren't accurate.
01:28:13.824 - 01:29:07.000, Speaker D: It was like the average of everyone's view that ended up being the most accurate. And so there's just like a lot of value in this as information. I think it's fascinating. And the other really interesting thing about prediction markets is some of these markets have actually been disputed. So if you have a market, what will be the weather in New York City today? Will it be over 60 degrees or under 60 degrees? Let's say the market says, will the weather in New York City be over 60 degrees. Well, are you looking at AccuWeather weather Channel? Are you looking at the weather in the Bronx or the weather South street seaport? At what time of day are you measuring the weather? There's so much nuance into how these markets. Markets are worded, and that's actually a lot of the centralized prediction.
01:29:07.000 - 01:29:50.434, Speaker D: Market platforms have had major disputes over the wording over these markets, where both sides have thought they've won, which is another reason why, in a decentralized context, I think Auger actually was really thoughtful around this, is there was a whole dispute resolution mechanism, and it was all arbitrated on chain, which actually drove value, hypothetically drove value to the replica and made the token actually incredibly useful to be able to participate in the dispute resolution process. If you're using this as your core insurance platform, is actually quite valuable and the token does have a reason to exist.
01:29:52.594 - 01:31:21.374, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, if someone's cornering the market on rep tokens and has an unfair sway in the votes, it might be challenged, but then you start layering. I think it's where you could really see some Dao high participation and different mechanisms to prevent these DAO attacks, which I think the surface area is large. People are not paying enough attention to it because it hasn't mattered. But it will in a context like polymarket, if it had a token or auger, or even the deciding the outcome of uni to distribute this massive treasury. Maybe as a parting question, and this is something that we've talked a lot about in various guests in empire, is this idea of on chain activism? And it was brought up in the context of, look, there are a lot of projects that, look, block one has more bitcoin in their holdings than micro strategy Gollum. There are many teams that perhaps haven't gotten product market fit, but their treasury is vast. And the question is, what do you do with that? And how do you think about, is this something that you guys are paying attention to, like activism? How involved are you in, like voting and in maybe, you know, dismantling some of these teams and distributing? Like, there's a lot of value in the treasury and you're saying, hey, well, just dismantle it and distribute the holdings back to token holders.
01:31:21.374 - 01:31:27.894, Speaker B: Like, is that something you guys think is. I mean, activism in traditional markets is a thing?
01:31:29.434 - 01:32:37.934, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think that there are some really interesting deep value plays in crypto, and they kind of all tie back to where a token will trade at a meaningful discount to book value. I mean, we talked about Nexus mutual earlier they had, at a point earlier at the beginning of the year, they had $400 million of ETH, and their token was trading at around $150 million market cap. So it was trading at 60 65% kind of discount to Nav, and you got exposure to ETH price because the treasury was in ETH. So kind of as well as that kind of discount eclipsing. So, regardless of your view on the kind of underlying insurance protocol, and how many premiums they're going to sell and claims they're going to pay out, unless you think they underwrote a tremendous amount of bad debt, but even you could kind of quantify that. The actual book value was quite meaningful, and I think you could build a thesis around that.
01:32:37.934 - 01:33:23.674, Speaker D: Now, the one, I think issue with these activism plays, whether it's like been gnosis or eos or many of these teams sitting on big daos, is the governance rights of token holders are limited in terms of what they can force. The kind of the quote unquote management team, even though there aren't official management teams on these networks, but forced them to do. And as a result of that, I think there are kind of opportunities there. But you really have to understand, kind of the incentive alignment, is the team motivated to distribute kind of this value back to token holders? And I think that is kind of a critical thing to understand.
01:33:25.674 - 01:34:07.444, Speaker C: I'm with Ben there. I think big discount to some of the parts stories in traditional finance has been widowmakers. That discount has never closed, mostly because there's no means to recourse and closing that discount. And usually it happens when, a, there is a way to close it, which is activism, or b, the management team actually changed their mind. For most token projects, owning means of tokens means nothing. And unless you can beat them in a submission in China, that means getting central government officials like grab them and just force them to distribute. Barring that, or sort of IR's knocking the door, FBI, I don't think there's that easy of no way to force those treasuries values.
01:34:07.824 - 01:34:25.728, Speaker B: All this while I'm thinking of GBTC and the premium that is meaningfully compressed, which I think the catalyst there is just the market is pricing in shorter timeframe for the conversion of this closed end mutual fund into an ETF and more might. And so it should trade at spot like one to one to spot, which, you know.
01:34:25.856 - 01:34:28.128, Speaker C: Well, in that case, there's both a means, right?
01:34:28.176 - 01:34:28.804, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:34:29.784 - 01:34:33.720, Speaker C: And intention. Because if Barry's like, we're not going to convert this, this will always.
01:34:33.792 - 01:34:45.304, Speaker B: Yeah, there's intention and also cause if it takes ten years and the management fee alone will eat into it and the liquidity will warrant the discount. But I think the market is expecting that within a year. Like, you're going to have a ETF conversion.
01:34:45.384 - 01:35:26.564, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think the other component is like when we measure book value, like what units is it measured in? For example, if there's 400 million of ETH or if there's GBTC, you get exposure to increases in spot prices. Whereas if you're underwriting a project that has a bunch of treasury and stablecoins, even if it's trading at a big discount, you may underperform just owning tokens if you think the market's going to go up. So I think for those reasons, many of the teams in the space have their entire treasuries in ETH and in wrapped bitcoin in attractive portfolios that you can basically access at a discount.
01:35:27.064 - 01:35:34.884, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, Jen, this has been a fascinating discussion. Anything else that you want to wrap with parting thoughts? Just things that are on your mind?
01:35:36.984 - 01:36:31.624, Speaker D: I wanted to just tell a quick story about Jason. So as many people know, or maybe don't know, I'm not public on Twitter. And for the longest time people have been like, well, who's your alt profile? Trying to figure out who you are. And there was a period of time, it still happens, actually occasionally, where people think I am Maple Leaf capital on Twitter. So when Jason's tweeting about gaming, about Defi, over the years, people have dmed me on telegram or emailed me, be like, hey, I love your views around XYZ project in Asia and China. How'd you get so smart on that region? And makes me feel really good because I think Jason's views on Twitter are excellent. But I just find it funny that so many people think I'm Jason.
01:36:31.624 - 01:36:37.772, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll kind of like end with that, with that story.
01:36:37.908 - 01:36:52.344, Speaker B: By the way, Ben always has stories to end podcasts. You're lucky, Jason, because he has told embarrassing stories about my Lego collection and other stuff. So in this case, you got off the hook easy, man, because he knows way too many stories about me that are embarrassing.
01:36:53.364 - 01:37:25.682, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I don't have a cool story. And Ben, I hope there are no angry lp's yelling at you, because sometimes my tweets are obscene. So I don't know, I don't have much of a remark, except I think ETH here is a good bet. I think eventually people rotate from bitcoin etf to ETH eTF. And I guess there's a lot of flows negatively impacting that ratio. But I think that's the best risk or trade I've seen so far this year. More than anything else currently.
01:37:25.682 - 01:37:50.958, Speaker C: Spot ETH, there are risks around, like, oh my God, like there's macro, there's like, you know, FTX and Celsius selling pressure. But like, I mean, this spot here is, I think it's really good. You kind of get a clear shot of the ETF and I don't think people are. I think it's like too far out that people are not just people are looking at each other. It's like who's going to bid first? But when it, when it runs, it's going to run really personal.
01:37:51.086 - 01:37:55.144, Speaker B: Yeah. An east ETF that pays out some dividend.
01:37:56.884 - 01:38:05.052, Speaker C: Would be, and it's so easy to do, they can just lend it out to stakers that will stake it and then just in return paying a sort of borrowing at a similar stake.
01:38:05.148 - 01:38:10.424, Speaker B: Would you buy ETH, bitcoin or just Coinbase, which might benefit from all of this activity?
01:38:14.044 - 01:38:15.184, Speaker C: All of the above.
01:38:16.444 - 01:38:17.784, Speaker B: Compat answer?
01:38:18.584 - 01:38:48.638, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd agree with that. I think. I guess just like my closing thoughts are, this environment reminds me tremendously of late 2019, early 2020. It was like right before the bitcoin halving. It was right before the end of a monetary cycle. Valuations and private markets were low. There were many interesting areas of product market fit.
01:38:48.638 - 01:39:42.542, Speaker D: It ended up being a phenomenal vintage in retrospect. And to me that just rhymes so much with today's environment, almost eerily so. And I do feel like we are in the early stages of a bull market, is what it feels like to me. I think it's going to be a more kind of like responsible bull market than the last one. Maybe it won't be, but it feels like there are more adults in the room, more real applications for crypto. The UX has come a really long way, and I'm kind of just excited about a lot of things I'm seeing. And then look, I think there's still a lot of pain that's going to be taken.
01:39:42.542 - 01:40:19.490, Speaker D: I think it is a have and have nots market. And so I think a lot of the companies that were funded in the last cycle in the bull market are. I think there's going to be a lot of pain to come there in that peak vintage. You've seen companies like Yuga, Polkadot make massive rifts. I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation. I think that's a good thing, because if you look at any given category, like wallets or MEV or, these categories have far too many companies in them. Some of these categories have 50 to 100 companies building the exact same thing.
01:40:19.490 - 01:41:14.720, Speaker D: And so I think that consolidation of companies going out of kind of getting aqua hired, shutting down, that's actually helpful for the whole space because it equilibrates or recalibrates supply and demand, and it lowers things like customer acquisition costs, it lowers wages, it reallocates talent to a few winners. And I'm excited to kind of see that play out. I think you're starting to see it play out right now. And someone brought up a really interesting point in a board meeting recently. They said that, look, every startup is either selling a vitamin or painkiller. If you think about it like, every company is either selling a vitamin or painkiller and you really want to sell painkillers. And I think far too many companies in crypto are selling vitamins.
01:41:14.720 - 01:41:59.284, Speaker D: They're selling things that make a process a little bit better, a little bit easier, a little bit faster. But if the companies that are selling true painkillers, one of them is fire blocks, right? They're solving like a massive pain point for their customers, and I think they can demand really high Arpus as a result of it. And so I, you know, we've been just pushing our portfolio companies to like, really find like that pain point and kind of sell painkillers as opposed to selling, you know, vitamins. And I think that's, you know, I think that'll end up, you know, that analogy, that's not my own. I'm repackaging it. Someone else mentioned to me, I think it really resonates with me in this market.
01:41:59.824 - 01:42:40.240, Speaker B: Well, on that point, I had this sort of thought recently, which is crypto historically has been a little bit like selling. I want to go back to this analogy. I keep saying it, but like flood insurance, the value prop, when you go to someone and say, use defi, their immediate response in a developed market in the US, they say, what are you talking about? Venmo and Robinhood work fantastically well, and my chase app works fantastically well. You go to other places, like Argentina, Venezuela, not so much. But it's flood insurance. It's when you are dealing with hyperinflation, it's when you've been deplatformed, I think more the hope here is you talk to artists and they tell you, hey, wait a minute, now I can sell digital art. Like, full stop.
01:42:40.240 - 01:43:10.454, Speaker B: I was not able to sell digital art before. And crypto allowed digital property. And then, and then I don't have to go through Sotheby's because I can just go through Opensea or whatever, or any other marketplace. And that's powerful for a certain subset. And I think maybe that's the transition that crypto is really going through, which is you stop selling it as flood insurance. I think it is a catalyst. When the world goes into chaos, crypto comes into the attention again.
01:43:10.454 - 01:43:44.320, Speaker B: But I do hope that with more consumer applications, it just becomes more of the selling point of crypto. A is less about rooted in fear and chaos and more in just vast opportunities and much more. Ben, you talk about consumer preference and the amount of benefit that goes to the consumer and reduced fees and greater access to capital markets. That is massive. And I think the selling point of that touches everyone versus fear. There needs to be some sort of specific event and it's limited. Right.
01:43:44.320 - 01:44:23.524, Speaker B: You always want to be operating, I think, from a position of endless possibilities like the Internet did versus, hey, this is like you're selling the world's going to end, go buy bitcoin. And people are like, no, man, chill. So I think that might be the transition. I think you need to see killer consumer applications. So, Jason, any, anything else? Any pointing thoughts? He's just nodding, saying, no, I'm tired, I want to go to sleep. That's awesome, gents. Well, thanks so much for coming on.
01:44:23.524 - 01:44:38.484, Speaker B: We'll have to revisit this later down the road in a couple of months. But you heard it here first. This starts to feel like the start of a bull market. I sort of agree with that. Appreciate both of your perspective. Guys, always a treat to have you on. Thank you.
