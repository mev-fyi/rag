00:00:32.754 - 00:00:33.494, Speaker B: Up?
00:00:33.794 - 00:00:36.202, Speaker C: Glad to be here. Michaels one and two.
00:00:36.258 - 00:00:41.426, Speaker A: Michaels one and two. Well, I wasn't sure if you're going by Mike these days. I didn't know if you ended up making a decision. I know you've been like debate.
00:00:41.450 - 00:00:44.922, Speaker C: Michael's kind of convinced me I'm in a transition phase here. Yeah.
00:00:45.018 - 00:00:45.634, Speaker B: Wow.
00:00:45.794 - 00:00:46.514, Speaker A: And Michael?
00:00:46.594 - 00:00:47.826, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:00:47.970 - 00:00:57.094, Speaker A: Vance and Michael. I feel like we're supposed to give a disclosure now that you guys are now investors in blockworks. How does it feel to be not just co hosts but co owners of the Bell Curve podcast?
00:01:00.834 - 00:01:18.774, Speaker B: Check the contract. I don't know if we're actually going to be investors. And, yeah, I mean, you guys are growing super quickly. You've got a good team, so it feels good. You know, we've looked at a lot of different startups and you guys are definitely growing quickly and it's, it's impressive. So add something to you.
00:01:19.114 - 00:01:20.894, Speaker D: Really excited to be a part of it.
00:01:22.164 - 00:01:23.904, Speaker A: How so? Professional of you.
00:01:24.764 - 00:01:27.584, Speaker B: Maybe a little bit more gusto next time.
00:01:28.204 - 00:01:29.988, Speaker C: Yeah, I really believed you there, Michael.
00:01:30.076 - 00:01:31.064, Speaker B: Seriously.
00:01:31.524 - 00:01:34.864, Speaker A: Really fired up to be along for the ride. Yes.
00:01:35.324 - 00:01:38.144, Speaker C: Now, once you made the sale, stop. Sell it.
00:01:40.644 - 00:01:42.944, Speaker B: How does it feel to have us as investors now?
00:01:45.084 - 00:01:46.984, Speaker C: We're really excited to have you.
00:01:51.184 - 00:01:52.324, Speaker A: That was all about.
00:01:53.064 - 00:01:54.244, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that.
00:01:56.224 - 00:02:03.484, Speaker A: Was a lot of good. What do you guys pay attention to this week outside of our big announcement?
00:02:04.104 - 00:02:06.496, Speaker C: What's interesting, there's a lot of funny.
00:02:06.520 - 00:02:12.924, Speaker B: Stuff that happened this week. The one that I don't think is on our prep, doc, was Aragon.
00:02:14.384 - 00:02:22.824, Speaker A: We were debating whether or not to get into that, but I saw you ripping some fun tweets about it. So why don't you, can you maybe give us a lay of the land on what's happening in Aragon land?
00:02:23.684 - 00:03:20.450, Speaker B: Yeah. So Aragon is a project that has developed various different software products, Aragon court being one of them. It's funny because it's supposed to be a court for Dow governance, which is obviously so really needed in the wake of this kind of blowing up. But they built a bunch of different things. They raised a bunch of Ethan in an ICO in 2017 I guess it was. And they've kind of been this beleaguered project that just spends money on kind of this, that and the other thing like crazy off sites stuff like that. Basically there's a lot of allegations of like you should just return this money to the community and a few funds decided to try that tax over the past big quarter and so these funds bought a bunch of Aragon or accumulated a bunch of Aragon and they pushed to a vote with the DAO, return the capital immediately lets kind of right the ship and go on our separate ways.
00:03:20.450 - 00:04:07.496, Speaker B: And I think they did vote and successfully pass this measure to return all the capital. And then right as it was about to happen, Aragon foundation rugged the Aragon Dow took all of the money and called the process of voting a majority of votes and passing something a 51% attack on democracy. Just absolutely hilarious that they would call it that. Also there is no 51% attack in something that isnt a base layer. Its just called voting. I think a bunch of the funds that tried this got worked because Aragon is now worth basically zero of the treasury is also worth zero. And Aragon foundation also just looks terrible for rugging all of these people.
00:04:07.496 - 00:04:44.588, Speaker B: It's not really their money anyways. It's supposed to be a dao until they didn't want it to be. And yeah just the levels of cope and saltiness on the timeline this week were unbelievable. It really felt like people probably maybe bought a little bit too much ant and it just didn't work. And it's just a friendly reminder that this is not rad five. And also don't try to real fair value raid treasury that can unilaterally move the funds on you. That feels like something that comes up in the first hour of diligence when you think about this project.
00:04:44.588 - 00:04:49.544, Speaker B: But curious to hear what you guys think just is an overall shit show in my opinion.
00:04:52.604 - 00:05:45.694, Speaker C: I don't really have I'm not really sure if I have a super specialized take here. I did see know Arca they proposed the buyback basically because the FTP of Aragon I guess is trading below the book value of the treasury. I guess I should have looked this up before I just went to but I would guess most of that treasury is heat up of the native token anyway. So I think it's probably I don't know about that as an investment strategy for frankly for projects at this stage. But yeah, I think it's just, it's kind of unmasking some of the decentralization theater that happens, especially at early stage Daos. And every time there's something like this that happens, it's not, like, strictly speaking, a massive deal, but I think it does sort of chip away at this idea of decentralization that crypto is supposed to be. So, yeah, I just think it's kind of a black mark overall.
00:05:47.034 - 00:05:47.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:47.370 - 00:06:30.354, Speaker D: And not. Not necessarily saying that this is the case at all, but, uh, in this particular situation. But I do think that it does kind of, like, beg the question of what happens when a protocol is done, and, like, it's built, it's complete, we're not going to be changing it anymore. Like, what do you do with the treasury that people are sitting on at that point? And I think ultimately, what should happen is that it should be value that is delivered back to the community, back to the users of the protocol in some way, shape, or form. But, yeah, I mean, in this case, obviously not happening. Also, I don't even know what Erdogan is at this point. They have a massive treasury, but also not a ton of product.
00:06:30.354 - 00:06:44.434, Speaker D: And so, yeah, I think this situation is very different, but being able to have the protocol being finished and then being able to deliver that value back to users, I think, is an important step in sufficient decentralization.
00:06:46.034 - 00:07:29.758, Speaker A: So let me just make sure I understand this correctly. So, before this, the DAO funds. So, basically, the argument is that Aragon did a bad job of establishing value for the ant token, which is their governance token. That ant fell below the treasury value. Arka came in, bought a bunch of tokens, then wrapped the tokens in a very quick amount of time, gave them voting rights. They voted for pro rata distribution of the treasury back to token holders so that they could make some money. And then rather than doing that, like, following the actual governance vote, Aragon said that they were getting 51% attacked and changed so that dow no longer by the Dow, but now governed by a grants program.
00:07:29.758 - 00:07:30.678, Speaker A: Is that.
00:07:30.806 - 00:08:15.614, Speaker B: That's right. Like, at the time of vote, I think Aragon was, like, 120 million, and they had 200 million of non stable or non native network assets in treasury. And so there was this ARB, if you could get it all returned. But if you've ever done governance or ever spent time in any of these daos, it's very clear to you that there's two phases of governance. One is snapshot, and Snapshot is not like, Snapshot's not connected to a smart contract. Snapshot is more of, like, a polling mechanism, and then you need someone with a multisig or, I guess, in this case someone who had unilateral control over all the assets to go do something. So, yeah, I mean, the Clifford rate to be just got hosed here.
00:08:15.614 - 00:08:21.130, Speaker B: But also, should you have known that? Probably, yeah.
00:08:21.162 - 00:08:48.824, Speaker A: Well, I think you're trying to apply the activist investing model to crypto, right? Like, what's the activist model? In a nutshell? And you take a company that has great products, a lot of use, like, a lot of customers, huge Tammy, passionate audience and community, and, like, user base, usually cash flow positive, all good things, all green checks. The X would be misaligned management or misaligned employees. Well, that's what you had with. That's what it seems like you have with.
00:08:49.564 - 00:09:35.188, Speaker D: I'd actually say, you know, activist investing. Yes, for sure. This is more of, like, the classic Warren Buffett, uh, investing, where, you know, his classic line is like, I'm not trying to find, you know, like, solid companies that are trading at reasonable prices. I'm trying to find cigarette butts that people have already literally thrown to the gutter, but there's still a couple of puffs left in them. Things that are trading below their residual value, things that are trading below their cash value. But the leap here is that you have the assumption that you're going to be able to take that purchase of these assets, the ant token, in this case, for 120 million in value, and be able to recover 200 million in value. And I think that's Vance's point, which I totally agree with.
00:09:35.188 - 00:09:48.076, Speaker D: It's like, anyone who's experienced in any of these decentralized governance mechanisms, you're not going to be able to just flip a switch and turn over, like, all right, give me the money now. No, that's not how this works.
00:09:48.180 - 00:10:01.274, Speaker B: No, you're going to court. You do the money still. No. These things are honey pots for trad five people. I feel like. Because it looked. Feels exactly like traditional finance, but it's not.
00:10:01.694 - 00:10:05.914, Speaker A: So what's happening with Aragon now? So now they took back control and they're. They're fine?
00:10:07.254 - 00:10:15.902, Speaker B: I wouldn't say they're fine. I would say there's, like, pending lawsuits, but, like, it's a swiss registered utility token. So, like, pack your bags. You're going to Switzerland.
00:10:16.078 - 00:10:44.366, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's why this is going to be bad. Well, is, uh, you. You only get, like, Mike and I have been talking about this a lot, actually, with bitcoin, which is, like, now that bitcoin's venturing into, like, defi on bitcoin and things like that, it's actually hurting the brand I think because you kind of only get as a company, like one, maybe two words to describe your brand. Um, and you have to, like, rally a community around that. Like, that word and that ethos. And if Aragon isn't willing to operate as a.
00:10:44.366 - 00:10:53.434, Speaker A: As a real dao here, their mission and, like, their values are completely killed, which kills like that. That is their customer set.
00:10:56.254 - 00:11:12.394, Speaker B: I would say they lost track of who their customers were a long time ago. Aragon court doesn't really work. Aragon, the Dao governance framework is okay. Not great. How does it all connect to a token? Extremely unclear. Maybe some of these things shouldn't have a token, but.
00:11:16.254 - 00:11:17.350, Speaker D: Doesn'T make sense.
00:11:17.422 - 00:11:30.194, Speaker A: This is a bummer to me because if Aragon didn't have a token, Aragon could have just been a sick SaaS company where they just built really good products and just charged people twenty k a year, increased it as the seats went up and boom.
00:11:30.234 - 00:11:50.314, Speaker C: Called it just a note here. I was actually wrong. I just assumed most of their treasury would be in their native token, but they actually did a much better job than most dows and diversifying. So I would have. I would have loved if USDC and ETH were flipped here. But I mean, this is, this is like a top 5% of back treasury management. Yep.
00:11:51.374 - 00:12:04.554, Speaker B: These are ideas that come to people in bear markets when they're like, ooh, we should go after this person and get their money. Cause, like, they're not spending it wisely. And like, it kind of never seems to work. I guess, like, rookdao kind of worked in the same vein. That was like the success case.
00:12:05.174 - 00:12:07.214, Speaker C: But why is that, Vance?
00:12:07.254 - 00:12:16.616, Speaker A: Why is that wrong? The token market cap is 110 million and their treasure is 185 million. So it's. If you're like, that's a huge mismatch there.
00:12:16.720 - 00:12:37.120, Speaker B: Sure. Your upside is you make, you know, one x. Your downside is you lose everything. One x, you know, like, there's no asymmetry there. And like, chances are you're going to get rugged. And the amount of people that have, like, pitched like Tezos has, I think it's two or $3 billion of their treasury now. Like, let's go get them.
00:12:37.120 - 00:12:58.284, Speaker B: It's like, I'll see you when you get back, you know, I'm just going to buy Ethan, chill. It doesn't feel like that's the best use of your time. And there's things that feel like work when you invest, like, when you're doing things and then there's just things that don't. Where you're just holding and being patient, it feels like people just wanted to do some work here, and it didn't really pan out well.
00:12:58.404 - 00:13:32.196, Speaker D: And it stems from the fact that you have all these activist investors in Tradfi, you have the Warren Buffett investment standards in tradfi, and people want to replicate that and be those things in web three. And because of that, it's sort of like this imposter syndrome of, oh, I want to be able to go off and, like, extract value from, like, 125 to 185, and it just doesn't work the same way. Uh, and so, yeah, I think, yeah, we've seen this a number of times. Like, we, we know a number of investors who have the same mentality and have the same strategy. Uh, but frankly, I haven't seen a.
00:13:32.220 - 00:13:33.864, Speaker B: Repeatable process that works.
00:13:34.554 - 00:13:41.450, Speaker C: By the way, did you see that Hindenburg's latest target is actually Carl? I don't know.
00:13:41.482 - 00:13:43.294, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Crazy story.
00:13:44.034 - 00:13:47.534, Speaker C: It doesn't look good for Carl.
00:13:48.154 - 00:13:50.374, Speaker A: I haven't looked at this. What's going on?
00:13:50.954 - 00:14:10.318, Speaker B: So there's basically allegations of him inflating asset values that are liquid, and there's pretty good evidence to suggest that that's probably happening. Carl owns 85% of the shares, and his son owns 85% of the shares of Carl Icahn company.
00:14:10.366 - 00:14:11.070, Speaker C: I forget what it's called.
00:14:11.102 - 00:14:13.166, Speaker D: Maybe it's just called Icahn Enterprises on.
00:14:13.190 - 00:14:21.662, Speaker B: Enterprises, and he's pledged 65% of the 85% as personal margin loans. Now, if I told you this story.
00:14:21.798 - 00:14:24.154, Speaker C: What does that remind you of? Did I remove.
00:14:25.894 - 00:15:28.594, Speaker B: Marking up liquid assets, paying quarterly dividends that people have advised him to not do, allegedly colluding with Jefferies, which is an investment bank, to sell these shares to retail, and then taking out massive personal margin loans. He's obviously a legend, and I'm sure he would say terrible things about crypto if he had the chance. But what are you doing? What is the most plausible solution for this or answer for all of these questions? He hasnt put any answers to the questions that Hinderburg asked, and hes just continuing to increase his pledges of shares against these margin loans. And the things that he will not disclose are, what are the terms of the loans? Whats the liquidation price? Whats the loan to value? How much debt have you pulled out of this thing? The other interesting part is he pays out this massive 2% dividend per quarter, but he doesn't pay it to himself. He takes his dividend in, paid in kind shares.
00:15:30.134 - 00:15:31.154, Speaker C: I saw that.
00:15:31.774 - 00:15:48.070, Speaker B: Think of this as if he were to take the dividend in cash. He would dilute everybody else's dividend. So he doesn't do that. Instead, what he does is he just takes more shares, pledges them as margin loans, and it all works in this circular way.
00:15:48.262 - 00:15:49.750, Speaker D: Watts on, watts off.
00:15:49.862 - 00:15:55.044, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure there's no problem, but I just, like.
00:15:55.164 - 00:16:36.084, Speaker C: I don't know, it makes me wonder how many times other people have run this same scheme. Because the implicate, right? If you're obviously people who listen to this podcast are familiar with the FTT scheme that he was pulling, and you could basically replace FTT with shares of icon Enterprises and Jefferies with Genesis, and you'd be right there, right, with the exact same thing. Allergy. And I don't know, it just. I didn't realize it was like, when I kind of put that together with what he was doing, with what SPF was doing, I was like, oh, that's actually. It's kind of clever, but maybe he was just doing. Running the playbook that millions of billionaires have run before.
00:16:36.084 - 00:16:37.104, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:16:38.004 - 00:16:41.584, Speaker D: The answer is a lot. A lot of people have run this playbook before.
00:16:43.484 - 00:16:45.864, Speaker A: Got to imagine Bill Ackman's pretty hyped right now.
00:16:46.604 - 00:16:50.788, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, he was. He was retweeting Indenberg and all that stuff.
00:16:50.836 - 00:16:54.104, Speaker C: And he's sitting in his apartment like, last pocket guy.
00:16:56.964 - 00:17:09.436, Speaker A: Yeah, that guy's so fired up right now. One of the most epic moments of financial media ever was when Ackman went on CNbc. And then icon joins the call, and they're duking it out on CNBC.
00:17:09.540 - 00:17:11.348, Speaker C: Is that over Herbalife or something?
00:17:11.396 - 00:17:12.060, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:12.252 - 00:17:13.024, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:17:13.484 - 00:17:17.204, Speaker B: Tore my heart. And then Bill Ackman made a documentary, still on Netflix.
00:17:17.284 - 00:17:18.348, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that well.
00:17:18.396 - 00:17:19.580, Speaker B: All that good, honestly.
00:17:19.692 - 00:17:20.052, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:20.108 - 00:17:22.276, Speaker C: Yeah. You know what it just reminds me of?
00:17:22.340 - 00:17:36.804, Speaker A: Then he did a two hour, two hour pitch to investors about why. Why it was a Ponzi or a pyramid scheme. And then he asked for questions. A bunch of questions went up, and he called on his dad first, who had placed a question in the audience. This is not.
00:17:36.844 - 00:17:38.424, Speaker B: Anybody else want to tell their dad.
00:17:42.344 - 00:18:03.552, Speaker C: Wow, you can't make this stuff up. You know what? I so just don't want to detour too far from here. But Druckenmiller did a great speech this week. You can look it up. And he had this line. It's resonated with me having been in crypto now for, whatever, five years. But, yeah, when there are zero interest rates, people just make really dumb decisions.
00:18:03.552 - 00:18:19.508, Speaker C: When there are 0% interest rates for eleven years, people make really dumb decisions. And I don't know if it's Carl Icahn, but I do think everything that happened in crypto is probably a preview for the real show, which is going to be tradfi. And we'll figure out some, some people are definitely swimming. Make it.
00:18:19.676 - 00:18:58.294, Speaker B: I feel like we're, I feel like we're further in the process of crypto kind of getting worked and then cleaning itself up. Like we're, we're still kind of on cleanup duty for the past two years. Like we're distributing Celsius, Voyager, Blockfi, Genesis will get resolved one way or the other. This also feels like the bear market where everybody gets their coins back from Mount Gox and the pro or gets their coin back, meaning the US government is selling it on Coinbase. But I think there's a good deal of mopping up that we still have to do. I feel like the tradfi space is, we haven't even had the spillage yet. Everything is so shaky and frenzied.
00:18:58.294 - 00:19:13.172, Speaker B: If icon is taking it in the teeth like he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be the guy who's like responsible basically. It's not incredible. The first one, tradfi has yet to.
00:19:13.188 - 00:19:28.246, Speaker D: Hit their Luna moment. And the other thing that happened this year, or, sorry, this week, last year is Luna. It has officially been twelve months since everything started happening. And it works out here.
00:19:28.390 - 00:19:36.874, Speaker B: David app and Michael and I were at a wedding. I gave the best man speech and then literally 2 hours later we were like, ooh, it's all falling apart, isn't it?
00:19:38.654 - 00:19:39.914, Speaker D: That was terrible.
00:19:40.494 - 00:19:58.314, Speaker C: That was nuts. Doe was supposed this was around the same time as permissionless last year. And Doe was supposed to speak. They actually sent out a whole bunch of swag. Terra swag. They had someone come by real quick and grab all of that. But not quick enough because I got a t shirt.
00:19:58.314 - 00:20:00.474, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:00.814 - 00:20:02.230, Speaker D: Commemorative t shirt.
00:20:02.342 - 00:20:03.454, Speaker C: Commemorative t shirt.
00:20:03.494 - 00:20:04.114, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:05.414 - 00:20:37.894, Speaker C: I would love to get your guys thoughts just moving it back to crypto here. There are a couple of big proposals that went live this week on arbitrum and uniswap. I love to start with the arbitrum one. This was proposed yesterday, so May 10. But the proposal is the distribution of DaO revenue to arb token holders. Just to read you the high level TLDR, the objective is to distribute a portion of the accumulated revenue from the arbitrum dao to Arb token holders. This will align community incentives and give Arb a purpose beyond a worthless governance.
00:20:37.894 - 00:21:16.558, Speaker C: Token love that they included that there, as stated in recent tweets from arbitrum, the DAO has accumulated roughly 3352 ETH in revenue from l two base and surplus fees. Distribution of revenue will be proportionate to the amount of arb tokens delegated by each holder. So the benefits basically that they outline are distributing DAO revenue to Arp token holders will align community incentives and create a more engaged and committed user base. And it will give, yeah, give Arp this purpose. So I guess the disclosure that we have to caveat here is that blockworks is a pretty big delegate for arbitrage. So no opinions given here are indicative of anything. Yeah, caveat there, but framework.
00:21:16.558 - 00:21:20.354, Speaker C: Guys, what do you guys, and what's your sort of take here?
00:21:24.334 - 00:22:28.122, Speaker B: Feels like the Overton window is moving for turning on fee switches or sharing fees generally, which I think is really positive. I think if we get into the next bull run and we don't have real economics flowing, at least to the Dow, preferably to the token itself, I think we're going to look pretty silly. There has to be an end date in terms of when this happens. And I think it underscores just like, what the temperature is of entrepreneurs in the US. They're still willing to launch tokens, they're still willing to do things like turning on fee switches, and maybe they feel like they're decentralized enough, or they feel like the protocol is finished and they can call it just this neutral third party layer. But I think it's positive in terms of reading the room and understanding that the entrepreneurs that are still here are going to die on this hill, either in this country or a different one, and figure out how to make these protocols self sustaining. And you have to squint to see it.
00:22:28.122 - 00:22:49.364, Speaker B: But at one point, ETH was probably in a similar position. The transition of proof of work to proof of stake, getting back economics to the network, eventually they were just decentralized enough to do it. I think people are just saying, why are we not as centralized as they are? And maybe they aren't in practice, but they're starting to make arguments that put them in that, which I think is important.
00:22:50.464 - 00:22:51.284, Speaker C: Yep.
00:22:53.304 - 00:24:06.774, Speaker D: The only thing that I would add is that in these submarkets, where you have a number of different players that are going after the exact same models, the exact same consumers, users of these protocols, imagine that you're one of those competitors. Them and the other people are able to do this, whereas you are not. It's sort of like imagine you're a centralized provider versus a decentralized opportunity where there's token incentives and there's token models that incentivize usage and incentivize people to come to your platform. It's sort of like this is a level of competition that if you don't have it, you're not going to be able to compete and you're just going to get, you know, bulldozed by everybody else who's able to do this. So ultimately, I completely agree. I think a lot of what is going to change, the stuff that is going to change is we're going to have a model probably by the end of this year as to how this stuff can work. And there's a lot of movement on Capitol Hill right now to be able to have a framework to be able to build these things in this way in the US and not under the ire of regulatory pressure.
00:24:06.774 - 00:24:14.094, Speaker D: I think generally this is going to be the mainstay of what these future decentralized networks become.
00:24:18.474 - 00:25:03.046, Speaker C: I hear what you guys are saying. I think I've got a little pushback, which is the way I think about this is it's a capital allocation question. And for me, usually when you talk about dividends or share buybacks or something like that, the implication is I dont have a better use for this capital. I couldnt put this to work in some way, which would lead to more value creation in the equity or the token of the project, any return to token holders. That just doesnt make sense to me at this stage. I guess thats an open question. Vance, to your point is, are these protocols done? But I have to imagine that's their job, right? If you're on the arbitrum team, you're supposed to be allocating capital and creating value.
00:25:03.046 - 00:25:35.714, Speaker C: That's going to lead to the appreciation of ARB. The token, which I feel like is the most, that's got to be the most productive use of capital for a project at this stage. The other thing I would like, maybe this is the other way I think about it, is once you start to return capital to token holders, you cant really stop, right? Its the same way that investors become super accustomed to a dividend. There was a famous, like, it was GE, right? That was super famous for their dividend. It was like as good as gold. And yeah, it did really good stuff for GE stock. A lot of people bought it for that dividend.
00:25:35.714 - 00:26:06.334, Speaker C: But later, once they had problems or their better usage for that capital, maybe they didnt have the option to take it away because so much of the holder base of that stock was conditioned to expect the dividend. That was the reason why they were holding it. So I think the race in between these l two s is wildly competitive. And if it were me, I would be trying to find uses for that capital instead of giving it away back to token almost at this stage, literally.
00:26:06.374 - 00:27:14.536, Speaker D: Vance and I were having this conversation this week as to like, what does value accrual look like for these tokens? And like how do you value these things going forward? Part of me agrees that okay, yes, using all the different tradfi analogies like dividends, share buybacks, whatever it is, you can look at them the same way. You can't take away a dividend because it looked negative. You can't put the genie back in the bottle once it happens. The thing that I frankly just don't necessarily think is congruent here is I don't think any of these things. I don't think any of these tokens are valued based on fundamentals. So when you, when you're talking about like, okay, is the profit related to the treasury? And like are we valuing this thing on like price to sales or price to earnings? Or you know, is the share buyback that's driving. I think all of this stuff is valued based on flows, which is, you know, who is buying, who is selling, and if you can, if you can inject yourself into the flows question, theres actually a huge amount of undetermined value that you can drive for the token itself.
00:27:14.536 - 00:28:17.974, Speaker D: Because its not like if maker was to go off and double their revenue and therefore double the share buyback and burn, that they would be valued twice as much. On a token value perspective. Maybe some people would look at it and theyd be able to say, okay, well yeah, we can assume this and that, but it really comes down to what are the flows of the token itself, what's supply and demand and who is buying and who is selling. So I generally think like if you have a bunch of cash flow that's flowing to the token, having a token economic model that enables additional buying or additional, you know, purchasing of the token itself from the treasury, maybe it's redistribute redistribution of that token to the shareholders, or maybe it's redistribution of the token to the people that are staking it. Whatever those models might be. Like that that becomes super valuable. But we really have yet to see that because right now the only asset that is earning this much revenue is ETH.
00:28:17.974 - 00:28:23.194, Speaker D: And they burn part of the fees. But nobody else has hit that scale.
00:28:25.014 - 00:28:47.300, Speaker C: So I hear you on that, but I think so a p and l might not be appropriate for something like that. And yeah, these things arent trading based on price to sales or price to earnings or any other metric like that. But my counter to you would be neither is basically any other early stage startup. Right. Like an early stage SaaS company. Investors arent necessarily underwriting that based on their p and l or cash flow. Right.
00:28:47.300 - 00:29:06.954, Speaker C: There are certain metrics that you would look at, right. It would be like CAC and LTV and churn and growth rate and all that sort of stuff that goes into the valuation. I feel like we might just be at too early of a stage of crypto where those like, what determines flows? What is the leading indicator for flows? I actually disagree.
00:29:06.994 - 00:29:31.780, Speaker D: I mean, as soon as you move past the series a, people are valuing this thing based off of what is your price to revenue, what is your potential for profit. You assume all these things. You don't ask those questions because they don't have any earnings, they don't have any major EBITDA revenue multiples, whatever it is. That stuff doesn't exist for a series B company, but it should, because that's what people are valued.
00:29:31.812 - 00:30:05.190, Speaker A: But then, Michael, when you assume then that crypto has probably just been to, it's been in the seed, in the series A phase, and there's a decent likelihood that in the next cycle, as more professional investors continue coming into crypto, they will start to look at arbitrum and not just look at the flows, but they'll look at arbitrum and say, okay, you're doing about hundred million in annualized revenue. You've got like 30% to 40% margins. After, after the, you know, the call data costs, after, you know, 4844, you're going to probably go up to like 90% margins. Okay, like that, that's a pretty exciting business here. And this start, you start valuing things.
00:30:05.222 - 00:30:31.884, Speaker D: On that, you would assume that, but these are like the most inefficient markets that we've ever seen. And yeah, they're going, they're going to get, they're going to get more efficient over time. But, but I don't think people are gonna start valuing these things. Like, think of all the infrastructure, the financial infrastructure that exists around like even startups, but also just like publicly traded stocks. We're not valuing these things and like, trading these things based off of those fundamentals.
00:30:33.104 - 00:31:15.944, Speaker B: I have a slightly different perspective. I think, like, we've gone from like no valuation framework to like, there was one that was like TVL divided by market cap. That was just insane and meant nothing. And now you're more in the price to sales land. But what the gross margins are, how much goes to the Dow? Is the fee switch even turned on? People don't seem to be thinking about that, but I think we're trending towards a more efficient marketplace. And I think the real point is once you have flows that confirm, you know, these metrics, you're going to have more of a rational valuation framework. Imagine if Uniswap was buying back the token.
00:31:15.944 - 00:31:54.624, Speaker B: Imagine if any of the like maker does it right now and it trades at a pretty tight range of like 20 to 30 priced earnings. I think we're generally going to get there and I think you also need to potentially come up with a new valuation framework. And we've taken a couple shots at that. But I think mostly what you need is like you usually have people who are passive buyers of stocks or commodities or bonds that are trading things based on if it gets this cheap or this expensive, im going to do this or that. You dont really have that crypto having the structural flow I think is something that youre going to need to have if youre a serious project coming into the next run. Thats at least my thoughts.
00:31:55.564 - 00:32:15.834, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I think a lot of it has to do with the investor base and in tradfi markets they do have these ranges that they look for, for p multiples and that kind of thing. And if it goes below a certain multiple or something, it becomes you just a bunch more people will buy kind of thing. I don't think crypto still mostly retail. I just don't think people are thinking like that.
00:32:16.694 - 00:32:44.834, Speaker D: I mean not only just like ranges, they have indexes where like if you're a part of this or a part of that, or like you hit this threshold, literally, the index will have to buy you. Yeah, like that, that type of stuff. That's what I mean by the infrastructure just doesn't exist right now. So like we don't even know like how many retail investors in a given token, like have ever been to tokenterminal.com or like Defi llama to actually understand like what these, what these metrics are.
00:32:44.994 - 00:32:49.414, Speaker C: Probably like blockers, 15% or block producers. Yeah.
00:32:51.714 - 00:32:59.504, Speaker D: Enter in the end, enter in site here. But what is that percentage? It's probably less than 50.
00:33:00.244 - 00:33:02.676, Speaker A: It's definitely less than, it's probably less than like 0.5.
00:33:02.780 - 00:33:04.212, Speaker D: Yeah exactly.
00:33:04.388 - 00:33:06.304, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so too.
00:33:06.604 - 00:33:18.956, Speaker A: Let's talk about uniswap switch. I mean, how do you guys. So this week, GFX proposed turning on the v switch. I don't know if you guys took a look at it, I can give an overview, but, yeah. How do you guys feel about that.
00:33:18.980 - 00:33:59.514, Speaker B: 160 million dollars in six month revenue? You know, like, probably a little bit more than that in a bull market. Like, this is something that, when things really get going, is probably generating like mid nine figures of revenue. That's like, pretty impressive in terms of, you know, like, you're not investing in a startup for like, what. What are they making today? It's like kind of where things are gonna go. And it feels like that's kind of like, really the. The bar for success for these dapps going forward is can you generate nine figures of revenue per year? Mid nine figures? I think there's a few that can get there. Uniswap certainly one of them.
00:33:59.514 - 00:34:36.284, Speaker B: I guess my question on this is, what's going on in the background with the DAO? We've heard different things about different jurisdictions that you can do this in, and maybe it's more favorable. Is this the foundation that's leading it? That's definitely a question. The other thing that stood out is just how reasonable their fees are compared to coinbase and I guess less. So binance? Oh, yeah, it's pretty cheap. And the maker fees are negative, and the taker fees are less than the centralized exchanges. It's not surprising that they're doing more volume in these places. The uniswap is doing more volume than Coinbase on a frequent basis.
00:34:36.284 - 00:34:40.044, Speaker B: It just appears to have significant product market fit.
00:34:40.363 - 00:34:43.463, Speaker C: Vance, could you explain how these maker fees are negative?
00:34:46.363 - 00:35:35.734, Speaker B: They're just incentivizing people to effectively add liquidity to the pool. This may not mean a ton if you are taking a limit order on centralized exchanges. If you make a limit order, you're usually given a little bit less of a fee than you would if you just sold it all at market. And this is kind of like that idea taken to extreme where like, you know, like, you're charged negative fees on making limit orders, but if you're just taking random liquidity, like, it's going to cost you, um, which is probably the right model. Like, just looking at coinbases fees, they just seem, you know, like, what is it? Like if you scroll up a little bit, 40 basis points for things under $10,000. Like that's. And 60 basis points if you're the maker, it, like, that's pretty crazy.
00:35:35.734 - 00:35:40.694, Speaker B: Uniswap has the inverse fee structure of that where the makers are negative and the takers are significant.
00:35:41.194 - 00:36:02.894, Speaker D: But that's sort of a misnomer, right? Because like, who is a maker on uniswap, it's a liquidity provider. And the one thing about, you know, providing liquidity on Uniswap is you also are affected by impermanent loss. So, like, while I understand, like, they want to represent these things as negative, I'm not sure that that's like a fair representation.
00:36:03.924 - 00:36:38.000, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't provide liquidity in uni v. Three for a reason. We found that it's very easy to get picked off. It's very hard to provide liquidity profitably. And so I think the real litmus test at the end of the day is what are the LP's think? And there's a lot of stale liquidity that are in these things. Kind of like uninformed retail just getting hit. So I think over the long, long term, it's not about what are these fees for the people who are swapping? Are your liquidity providers making money after a permanent loss? And like, we've had multiple portfolio companies try to build options, vaults, derivatives, things like that.
00:36:38.000 - 00:36:44.684, Speaker B: A lot of the impediment to them doing it is the uni b three architecture. With regards to you as a liquidity provider.
00:36:45.104 - 00:37:17.908, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think it's a super interesting point, and I think it connects with whenever we were talking about blend, this kind of key assumption. Look, they spell this right out here. The LP's making the most money off uniswap are not retail traders. They're professional market makers, just like the ones seen on traditional exchanges. So I kind of do think you're seeing the evolution in just market structure for some of these Dexs. And basically, they're very comfortable assuming that the people that are the entities that will be providing liquidity into the future are not retail. It's not retail.
00:37:17.908 - 00:37:54.576, Speaker C: It's professional hedge funds and market makers. And I probably think that's the right assumption. I'm super interested. I'm kind of borrowing actually from a framework that, miles from that, who's been on the show every hash. But if you think about this, most of these protocols as kind of two sided marketplaces, a pretty interesting indicator to pay attention to is the amount of pricing power that these protocols have over their supply side. In this case, it'll just be super interesting to see. Yeah, basically how the LP's, how the LP's interact and if it migrates somewhere else, like curve or something like that.
00:37:54.576 - 00:38:44.974, Speaker C: Like, to use the analogy of something like Airbnb, which is also a two sided marketplace where the band is users and the supply side is homes. If Airbnb jacks their fees up, or like, how many people stop supplying their home for people to stay in, and if they jack their fees up and nobody stops applying their homes, then Airbnbs got a pretty good business. But if they like, move their fee at all and they lose a whole bunch of their supply, then that's something that you'd want to pay attention to. So Uniswap has been talking about this V switch for a while, and this proposal gets into some of the technical. It's not a technically easy thing to do, actually, especially for V three. It's kind of tough, but they're just, FYI, they're testing it out on Polygon first as well. V three on Polygon, which I think is smart because the stakes are just a little lower.
00:38:44.974 - 00:39:00.064, Speaker C: There's lower TVL and volume up there. So I just kind of want to see what happens at this point. I just want to see what happens. Do you think a bunch of liquidity will migrate off of Uniswap at some point?
00:39:00.104 - 00:39:34.584, Speaker B: Yeah. Or like, we won't be the source of retail flow? That would be another option, I think, like, where Utis does really well are like long ale pepe style coins where utop doesn't do as well, or like the blue chip. And frankly, that's where their fees are generally the highest as well. I don't know. The landscape is just going to change with regards to liquidity venues over the next few years. And I think the first step is getting the money into the dao. The second step is getting the money to the tokens.
00:39:34.584 - 00:39:47.364, Speaker B: And really the thing that Uniswap does not have is a really strong community that can help them raise all these issues. And it feels like that's going to be just like super important at some point, but probably not immediately.
00:39:51.224 - 00:40:29.330, Speaker C: I agree with that, actually. Do you want to talk about there was some, or does anyone else have any more comments on the P switch for uniswap? No. This is also just because I know there's been a whole bunch of different proposals for this over the years. Sometimes it seems like they're picking up steam and then they kind of end up dying. But GFX labs like Getty Hill, they're pretty serious people and deeply in the weeds. On uniswap, I feel like this feels like it actually might have some legs. I know we've seen it before, but I'll be very curious to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months.
00:40:29.522 - 00:40:34.214, Speaker B: What's quorum on a vote like this? What does it take?
00:40:36.654 - 00:40:39.034, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. I'm not actually sure.
00:40:40.294 - 00:40:41.086, Speaker D: No idea.
00:40:41.190 - 00:40:53.550, Speaker B: Usually it's like five or like in some daos we're involved in, it's like 0.5%. I would imagine something like this is probably like more of like 5%. But you're going to need a lot of tokens to get this through. It's just.
00:40:53.622 - 00:41:24.920, Speaker C: Yeah, there are, there are lots of complications as well. So one of the big, one of the big hurdles that has made this not get over the finish line is just tax and legal concerns. And GFX basically has this disclaimer where, look, this is kind of a treasury issue. I'm paraphrasing here. So they don't have a great solution for that. But yeah, I mean, I have no idea how that would work from a tax standpoint. If the Dow itself starts accruing revenue, I mean, they don't.
00:41:24.920 - 00:41:27.524, Speaker C: What's the legal entity that ends up paying the tax?
00:41:30.414 - 00:41:54.744, Speaker B: This is the tricky part. If you can do it at all, it's best to not have it go to a dao. You should just have it go straight to the tokens because people who get the money, you should figure that out. Or do a buy and burn where there is no revenue accruing. It's just buy pressure and then deletion of supply. But these are complex questions and nobody has answers for them.
00:41:54.894 - 00:42:48.624, Speaker D: Well, I think it's also exceedingly difficult when you're a us company based in the United States with us persons, and that is the dao that you're going forward with. That being said, I think that, and who knows exactly what's going to come out, but talked about it a couple of weeks ago, it seems like there's going to be some proposal that goes forward in the next couple of months for things like how a security can become a commodity, what actually means decentralized or sufficiently decentralized. Like there, there will be a lot of answers to these questions in the United States, it seems, and we'll see whether or not that House proposal goes through and gets ratified by the Senate or voted on by the Senate. But I do think that it's also one hand, if not both hands, tied behind your back while you're trying to operate from the US.
00:42:49.884 - 00:43:09.344, Speaker A: What about on the regulatory side with how you guys treat governance tokens? If you owned Uniswap tokens, I don't know if you do or don't, but if you owned Uniswap tokens and this went forward, would you feel comfortable voting on this in today's regulatory world, or would you just, you wouldn't touch that.
00:43:10.124 - 00:43:25.554, Speaker D: What we do with governance is we have a program where we delegate to a number of different entities and have them vote on our behalf. So, yeah, that's how we operate within governance.
00:43:26.134 - 00:43:30.354, Speaker A: And do you trust them to vote on your behalf, or do you tell them how you want?
00:43:30.974 - 00:43:44.634, Speaker D: We do not tell them anything. Usually most of these entities are like blockchain clubs at universities, and they can vote on however they see fit.
00:43:45.474 - 00:44:05.922, Speaker A: Vance didn't like that question so much that he muted and turned off his camera. I haven't seen that one in a while. This is a good time for me to call out that we are hiring a podcast producer on the crypto side. So you are. Garrett was like, do not forget. Do not forget. I totally forgot to call it out.
00:44:05.922 - 00:44:36.384, Speaker A: So we're hiring a new podcast producer. If you have a very deep understanding of crypto, defi nfTs, all that kind of fun stuff, come join us. You are not the one editing the shows. On the video and audio side, you are the one overseeing a show. So you'll help us source and schedule guests, plan and research episodes. You lay up some good content so that Michael can know what to say. It's tough to get this stuff off the noggin, craft the content, post production, all that kind of fun stuff.
00:44:36.384 - 00:44:41.928, Speaker A: If that's you fly through the DM's. Actually, don't do that. Go on our careers page and apply.
00:44:42.016 - 00:45:05.688, Speaker C: Let's talk about everyone's favorite mev bot. Jared from Subway. This is a great thread for. I just thought it was a cool. I'm not sure if folks actually saw this thread, but Robert Miller kind of shared some light on the alpha. So I'll actually just, I'll just share my screen here and walk people through it. But I think it's just kind of a cool case study of how these mev bots actually work in practice.
00:45:05.688 - 00:45:51.762, Speaker C: So basically, Jared, he's sort of famous, or this bot is sort of famous for making a whole bunch of money sandwiching traders on Pepe. The meme coin and basically the three bits of alpha that Robert walked us through was the way they do their inventory is very different from other bots. So if you think about a sandwich, depending on their two assets that are required for a sandwich, and it kind of requires that you start in one asset. So ETH is sort of the front run. Then you move into the meme coin, Pepe, and then you back run back into ETH. But Jared actually takes a very different approach and starts with, hes got a whole bunch of supply of pepe, the token. And then he goes back into ETH and then back into Pepe.
00:45:51.762 - 00:46:26.198, Speaker C: And theres just much less competition. The reason why more bots dont do that is just because warehousing becomes very difficult. If you think of your balance sheet there, you dont really want to hold a whole bunch of your assets in something thats as volatile as something like Pepe. Because any profits that you get from the sandwiching could be offset by declines from the meme coin basically failing. But I guess Jared from subway is extremely good at sniping. And he actually bought the coin pepe, just ten minutes after it was deployed. Just little tinfoil Hattie right there.
00:46:26.198 - 00:46:49.664, Speaker C: But thats how he gets his warehouses or is inventory. And then he kind of does this interesting strategy of mega sandwiching. So he basically puts more trades into the sandwich than just a one, one one. So it's kind of an interesting. I don't know if you guys had any takeaways, but I thought it was just a cool sort of inside look at how some of these MeV bots work.
00:46:51.524 - 00:47:49.834, Speaker B: I mean, it feels like we saw Jane street stop doing Mev trading, I think, like two or three weeks ago. And these strategies feel very much in the gray area of like, is this profitable trading or is this something else? Kind of like Avi Eisenberg style? Yeah, I mean, it's not surprising to see the big guys pull out of this specifically and these Jared from subway style characters start to emerge. But I think he just kind of is proof positive that at a certain level of economic activity, you see turned on and then the MEV is a substantial portion of fees. I forget how much he spent in the few days where he was really going for it, but it was a substantial part of the MEV burn that happened via 1559. But I don't know. These are all good signs MeV's turning back on. Crazy coins are turning back on.
00:47:49.834 - 00:47:54.714, Speaker B: Pretty easy as a neat validator to just sit there and collect your winnings.
00:47:55.734 - 00:48:29.214, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I was going to say. It's just that maybe less the MEB side, but just the level of activity and engagement on Pepe itself just makes me feel like we're starting to see the green shoots of what this bear market is and moving past it, and Meb is going to be a benefactor for all of that. So, and to Vance's point, I think it's very difficult to be doing that as an institution and necessarily from the United States. So you're going to start to see more Jared from subways, less Jane Street.
00:48:32.394 - 00:49:23.240, Speaker C: I think it's a tough. The builder market in general is one that's sort of opaque. And rule of law up till this point hasn't necessarily been applied to Mev. The regulators are. There's some evidence that they're kind of aware of it, but they're not paying a lot of attention. Now, there was a great thread from this account, AI something, I'll get the name, but basically questioning whether or not if you were a builder that had access to essentially order flow and you were trading using that information, does that constitute material, non public information? MNPI? And then is it insider trading? And you could certainly make a case for it. My guess, for something like Jane street, and if you look at, you can check Relayscan, they have one of the most active and successful builders, but they haven't won anything in the past week.
00:49:23.240 - 00:49:36.764, Speaker C: And I would guess some compliance or legal or someone over there has said, hey guys, we could be at risk here. It's probably not worth it. I doubt they pull out of the builder market in general, but they probably have to retool some of their strategies.
00:49:39.414 - 00:49:48.206, Speaker D: The other thing I would say is this stuff is like water. If you block one of it, like one direction of it, it's just going to flow somewhere else.
00:49:48.350 - 00:49:49.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:49.414 - 00:50:00.078, Speaker D: And it's not like the people that are searching are just going to like, oh, that's it, we're game up, we're moving on, and nobody else is going.
00:50:00.086 - 00:50:01.446, Speaker B: To pay, job where they left off.
00:50:01.470 - 00:50:09.594, Speaker D: And continue forward like someone will. The value will be there. It'll just have to be somewhere that is a more friendly jurisdiction.
00:50:12.414 - 00:50:59.864, Speaker C: The e scaling roadmap maybe smarter people than we could push back on this idea, but I think sort of implicitly requires the presence of larger, more sophisticated builders. I think suave is trying to get ahead of this with their ability to decentralize block building to some extent. But even a sequencer right now is the combination of it's a combined builder and proposer is what we've separated on each main chain. But especially as you have a proliferation of different l two s, and then eventually you get, maybe it's decentralized sequencers, maybe it's shared sequencers. There's still just dumb pipes that do the sequencing. You need a builder that understands state to stand in front of that, and the more order flow that you see, the more transactions that you have access to, the better you'll be at winning blocks. It's going to happen in cosmos.
00:50:59.864 - 00:51:08.720, Speaker C: I think it's going to happen in ETH alt twos as well. You're going to have big builders. I doubt Jamestree is going to pull out permanently. I think they're just going to reassess.
00:51:08.792 - 00:51:40.852, Speaker B: Well, I saw some really silly liquidity chart, which was fake, by the way. I don't know if people, I saw a bunch of people retweeting it. I was like, mathematically, there's no way that this is possible. But this far, where it was, there used to be 30,000 BTC liquidity within plus or -2% and now it's like, one bitcoin. It's like, okay, well, is that true? Like, I don't have to do the math to know that. Unrealistic, but, like, it just spread like wildfire. And then, like, the last day of comments, all I heard on Twitter was, like, low liquidity.
00:51:40.852 - 00:52:21.890, Speaker B: Watch out out there. You know, could get crazy, like, all my idiots, just, like, for yourself, these people are not pulling out. And if they do, there's going to be crypto native market makers to step in which, like, frankly, I would rather have. I would rather have big crypto market crypto native market makers develop themselves than anything else. That's kind of thing I'm still looking for is, like, back in the day, you had, like, Alameda squaring off with, like, three ac squaring off with, like, all the other crypto native market makers. It doesn't feel like there's, like, those, like, big people that are kind of, like, just going for it. I think getting the big trad five market makers out probably paves some room for them to develop.
00:52:21.890 - 00:52:22.318, Speaker B: That's.
00:52:22.366 - 00:52:35.514, Speaker D: I was about to say. I was about to say, I think there's huge market opportunity right now to be that crypto native market maker that doesn't exist in, in the same way that Alameda three AC used to exist.
00:52:37.654 - 00:52:40.382, Speaker B: Maybe not Alameda, but, um, like, you.
00:52:40.398 - 00:52:45.714, Speaker D: Know, I'm not talking, I'm not talking about committing fraud. I'm just talking about making markets.
00:52:46.334 - 00:52:48.754, Speaker B: I mean, it's. It's literally just winter mute at this point.
00:52:50.024 - 00:53:22.134, Speaker C: Yeah. If you want to nerd out, there are some upstart market makers out there. I don't know how public they are, but there are different models for market making. My understanding is you either market make bitcoin and ETH and that's a much more traditional model. Or you kind of have this token call option model of market making where you're given some percentage of arbitrum per se, and you want to make market on that at a certain price. And it, you know, your, your allocation kind of ends up being something like that.
00:53:22.174 - 00:53:25.430, Speaker A: Isn't that a model that eventually goes away? Like, that's kind of like an early.
00:53:25.502 - 00:53:32.554, Speaker C: Yes, I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. That's not, that's not like a real scalable. No, no, I agree with that.
00:53:34.174 - 00:53:34.854, Speaker B: Should we rap?
00:53:34.894 - 00:53:37.934, Speaker C: I'd like to get. Yeah, yeah, I think we gotta wrap. All right, guys.
