00:00:00.160 - 00:00:26.318, Speaker A: You just have to sell in September 21, October 21, November 21, December 21, Jan 22nd, February 22. Okay, that's your period. You got to sell something in that period because you realize the cycle is cooked. And then you buy a medium amount in the first three quarters of 2023. That's not picking a top and the bottom, but the real thing is very clear. I mean, you smoked the buy and hold. Why are we trying to just say this is a reasonable thing to try to do?
00:00:26.374 - 00:01:01.560, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, we all know blockchain is changing the world, but who. Who's actually driving it? I'm excited to invite you to the 6th edition of Meridian, a web3 conference hosted by the Stellar Development foundation in London. From October 15 through 17, get early bird tickets at meridian dot stellar.org with code blockworkspod. Special thanks to stellar for sponsoring us. Now let's get into today's episode. Everyone knows there's a massive shortage of top senior marketers in crypto and teams are constantly struggling to get their go to market done right.
00:01:01.560 - 00:01:33.596, Speaker B: That's why we're excited to have partnered up with Renault Partners, the premier go to market advisory firm for early stage Crypto. Teams get in touch with their team by heading on over to Renaud Partners.com or giving the co founder Jeff a follow on x. Check out the links in the description below. This episode is brought to you by Avalanche. Avalanche is a leading network of blockchains giving some of the world's largest financial institutions new use cases and business while leveraging completely customizable infrastructure. Check them out.
00:01:33.596 - 00:01:57.412, Speaker B: It's core app Discover. You can explore Avalanche's subnet ecosystem at core app Discover I was playing around earlier today. Really cool. Hey everyone. Jason here. Before we dive into today's episode, I wanted to tell you about your wallet's new best friend, Harpy. Harpy guards your digital assets 24/7 blocking sketchy transactions before they even happen.
00:01:57.412 - 00:02:16.142, Speaker B: But that's not the best part. Totally free. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO Empire. Link in the description now let's get into today's episode. Welcome back to Empire. We've got Santi. We also have Dave Kalk and Jeff park joining the episode.
00:02:16.142 - 00:02:41.698, Speaker B: I'll give a little background on both of them, but a little context on this episode. So we recorded with Ray and Tushar the other day. It was about, um, uh, basically crypto is over allocated to venture under allocated to liquid. Um, and we got a lot of good responses on that. Uh, if you haven't listened to that episode, you might want to listen to that, then come listen to this. We're going to. This is basically a continuation or a follow on of that conversation.
00:02:41.698 - 00:02:57.540, Speaker B: I think just this, like, under allocation to liquid over allocation to venture, something we're going to keep exploring on empire. Dave, if you guys don't know him, is the founder and CIO, reflexive capital. And then Jeff is head of Alpha strategies and portfolio manager at Bitwise. So, Jeff, Dave, welcome to the show.
00:02:57.920 - 00:02:59.808, Speaker C: Happy to be here. Thanks for having us.
00:02:59.904 - 00:03:28.080, Speaker B: Great. I usually don't ask this question because usually it's, people either know the guest or it leads to a winding answer. But I think it's a relevant thing to maybe ask to tee up this conversation with both of your backgrounds. So, Dave, maybe we could pick on you because you have a very non crypto, a very macro focused background, folks like with Peter Thiel and Goldman. And so maybe can you just fill us in on your background and elaborate a bit more on reflexive?
00:03:28.240 - 00:03:43.224, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me, guys. You know, we've been talking about doing this for a while, and last week was a really good discussion, so I'm happy to build upon that. But, yeah, Jason, I don't know how long we've known each other. I don't know what, did you and Jake become friends, like elementary school or something?
00:03:43.352 - 00:03:52.960, Speaker B: Yes. The backstory is I have known Dave since I was about five years old. So I'm really praying this episode is a win for me if Dave doesn't share any embarrassing childhood stories.
00:03:53.860 - 00:04:11.124, Speaker A: Yeah, it goes. That was the extent of my questions. Yeah. Cool. So, yeah, I have a long trading background, mostly in the macro space. I started my career at Goldman on the interest rate derivatives desk in September 2008. That's a really market structure focused desk.
00:04:11.124 - 00:04:34.819, Speaker A: You never really have to have a view on the Fed. You just take views on understanding what everyone else needs to do in the market. And so a pretty foundational piece of my experience. I did that for five years, but then I went and joined Peter Thiel at his family office, became the macro fund CIO. I was there for eight years. And with Peter, because it's Peter, you learn just different ways of making money. You learn to think for yourself.
00:04:34.819 - 00:05:11.224, Speaker A: That's really helpful in these competitive macro markets. But I think it's been also helpful when I've approached this new asset class like crypto and just developed all the necessary trading skills of working on your psychology, being disciplined, how to manage risk. I left in Q two of 2020 to help start Commonwealth Asset Management. Adam Fisher had just left Soros where he was running macro and he was restarting version 2.0 of his fund. Ive said this term macro fund, that means different things these days. Lets just define it as a flexible strategy where you look at everything from a top down perspective.
00:05:11.224 - 00:05:44.422, Speaker A: You see the regime and you look for just disproportionate risk reward. And so it was within that mandate in 2020 that we identified crypto as a macro asset and we set up some custom vehicles to get into this trade over the course of 2021. When we got to Q four, we listened to what the Fed was saying, that the regime was changing. And so our macro business refocused on other stuff. I personally tried to move on, but I really enjoyed this crypto market so much. And it's like macro is really hard. You go from playing the most competitive game to crypto, which actually felt like the least competitive game, and back to the competitive markets.
00:05:44.422 - 00:05:59.718, Speaker A: And that was unsatisfying. So decided in that moment to launch a crypto business and to create some institutional crypto products. And then about a year ago, I decided when to spin out with a full team to kind of re underwrite the mandate, make sure we get the cycle right. And we started reflexive capital.
00:05:59.854 - 00:06:03.278, Speaker B: If you had to summarize the thesis on crypto for you guys, what is that? Dave?
00:06:03.374 - 00:06:42.212, Speaker A: It's the most liquid, inefficient market. So typically liquid markets are more efficient. How big can millennium and Citadel be in the markets? Crypto is a pretty large outlier to that relationship in that it's fairly liquid, but it's highly inefficient and highly irrational. And that has to do with who the competition is. There's not a lot of professional trading experience, there's a lot of VC's, there's a lot of retail. And so I think there's quite a bit of edge that can be had in this market by being a professional and a risk manager. And I would say the biggest market inefficiency to me over my time horizon is that I don't see anybody really adjusting their portfolios in line with these regimes.
00:06:42.212 - 00:07:15.870, Speaker A: And crypto you have these very big regimes. We should talk about why I think that is. But I think if you're sober and you're dynamic about this, you could do so quite uncompetitively. And I didn't have a chance to trade in the nineties or the early two thousands, but I think that's basically what it feels like today, where if you get the big rotations right, it can be so valuable in this asset class rotations, like going from bitcoin to alts and selling to alts. Macro oftentimes isn't an edge when everyone else is doing it. It's hard to out macro rage traders, but it's pretty easy to out macro crypto people. So basically just here, because I think there's opportunities I won't see anywhere else.
00:07:16.170 - 00:07:48.632, Speaker D: Jeff, before we go to you, I want to focus on that because why do you think that is? We have obviously venture funds that they're like, ten years. They're like, we're just going to invest and then not touch it. They have the luxury of doing that. But there's a lot of liquid funds, but they all mostly round trip, you know, they're up multiples and then they give it all back mostly. And then they try to beat the watermark at some point, which is where we are now. But like, what is it? It's just the caliber managers is subpar, is they just don't listen. Like, what would you attribute that to?
00:07:48.776 - 00:08:18.574, Speaker A: I mean, I think a trading skill set and a VC skill set. I mean, you can argue they're not related, and you could argue that they're kind of inversely correlated. Like what? You know, trading is just about psychology. It's about understanding your intellectual biases. It's about being disciplined. The best traders that you know, are oftentimes the most flexibly minded people. So it's like price changes and they change their mind, and on one hand that makes them horrible investors, because, you know, it's like something moves and like, they have no commitment to things.
00:08:18.574 - 00:08:58.420, Speaker A: From a long term perspective, what makes a good vc, it oftentimes is something where you have some long term thesis that grounds your activity in the space, but it makes you a bit too stubborn to respond to price in the correct way. Then there's this additional crypto dynamic where so many people in crypto make it their full identity. It's almost like a cult. That's not a good starting point for you to make rational decisions when price changes. Yeah, I'd argue it's just the early movers in this space did not get into the space because they were traders. And to the extent that they did, they're oftentimes focused on harvesting really, really short term inefficiencies.
00:08:58.500 - 00:09:08.812, Speaker B: Jeff, what does a head of alpha strategies in PM at Bitwise mean? And I think with the lens of that question being how do you actually make money for bitwise?
00:09:08.996 - 00:10:21.040, Speaker C: Absolutely. So, as you know, Bitwise is a leader in the crypto asset management industry, primarily via the leadership of our index fund, as well as are single token etps. And I was brought on board about three years ago to augment those capabilities by offering actively managed strategies and solutions. And so today, we have most of our efforts invested in a multi strategy, multi manager framework, in the partnerships that we drive in accruing some of the most unique, orthogonal crypto returns that are possible in the arena. From my professional background, I've been looking at crypto professionally for now, over seven years, personally for ten plus years. And we are at this point where I think there's still a lot of dynamic changes happening at the core of the industry, where every cycle there are new implementations of even the technological capabilities that are possible between liquid and venture, and the blending there between historically. One of the things I found really unique about crypto, as Dave mentioned, is the inherent volatility that is present in this asset asset class.
00:10:21.040 - 00:11:11.270, Speaker C: I actually happen to take the view that bitcoin will probably remain a volatile asset, given its monetary design as a feature and not a bug. And that is a powerful thing, because historically, when you study the efficient frontier of a modern portfolio theory, you're taught on two axis, the y axis has return and the x axis has volatility. And you can think about investing in stocks and bonds and drive something worthwhile when those yields are not good enough. A new axis got introduced, a z axis, and that z axis is liquidity. So people would say, hey, we got to make more money than what the public equity market will give you. So we got to push out the liquidity curve. So now you go out to do things in private credit, private equity venture, as we just talked about, to drive that forward.
00:11:11.270 - 00:11:33.164, Speaker C: But what's really unique about crypto is you can actually get liquid implementations with high level of volatility that we have never seen before to create something new in that dot plot that is exclusively the opportunity set for an actively traded and liquid traded strategy by an expert navigator.
00:11:33.292 - 00:11:40.652, Speaker B: Yeah, so Dave, maybe you can walk us through just your thoughts on last week's podcast, outline the points, and would love to hear your take on the things that they outlined.
00:11:40.756 - 00:12:02.320, Speaker A: I have quite a bit of respect for both of last week's guests. I've known Ray and followed Tushar. You know, these guys are asking the right questions. So hopefully this discussion just builds on their arguments and tries to be forward looking. But there's not a lot of people in the space from my background and Jeff's background. So the goal here is to add perspective from a professional trader. And I think that presents an alternative thesis and pushes on some of their conclusions.
00:12:02.320 - 00:12:46.360, Speaker A: So if I were to go, you know, I took some notes when I was listening to it, and I'll outline, I think, four points, and two of them I love, and two of them will end up somewhere slightly different. But feel free to jump in if you think I'm mischaracterizing what they said. The goal is not to do that weird debate thing where you mischaracterize someone. The overall introduction, that there's the structural mismatch driven by an imbalance of too many venture funds, which means there's going to be Alfa and picking public tokens, and that this liquid strategy could outperform venture. And they gave a bunch of great reasons for why this mismatch exists, but they transitioned that into this idea that exceptions outperform. And so in many ways, if you're going against consensus, then you're going to succeed. Love that point.
00:12:46.360 - 00:13:24.510, Speaker A: And the way this will reconcile itself is via performance. So managers from other asset classes, aka someone like myself, will see this opportunity and become liquid managers. In crypto, there's this discussion of edge. I really liked how it's important to find edge in markets, and a related discussion at finding people's strengths and not a lot of weaknesses. So Tushar laid out four really good sources of edge information, or access edge analytical edge, which I think is the one a lot of people try to emphasize the psychological or behavioral edge. How do you manage emotions? Let's just call that traitor edge, and then structural edge. You have a different mandate than everybody else.
00:13:24.510 - 00:14:01.798, Speaker A: Then there are two segments that I want to dive into and end up somewhere pretty different. So there's this discussion on all these previous attempts to suppress volatility. And the general character of that discussion is that it's just too risky. If you're trying to suppress volatility by trading, aka go between zero and 100% long, we've only seen that not work. And so the characterization is that managing risk actually leads to more risk. And of course, picking tops and bottoms is very hard. And when you look through all the performance over the years, there's just no real evidence of that working.
00:14:01.798 - 00:14:31.878, Speaker A: And the guess is that it's because human beings just burn out and then they start to do stupid things like use leverage. You look at March 2020, there's all these examples of that. And so the recommendation is just to absorb the volatility and have a long term timeframe. And the fourth and final point was that markets are chaotic, so one shouldn't attempt to play the game of market psychology. It's too hard. It's impossible trading beta, you can't find patterns. Everything is already built into expectations, and it might be very self referential.
00:14:31.878 - 00:14:52.454, Speaker A: The market is more efficient along this axis of beta of market timing than the idiosyncratic dimension. And generally it's just hard to win the psychology, and so it's easier to win with analysis. So those are kind of the main points. Hopefully I did a decent job of stimulating them. But anyone else want to add anything to their points? And then I can go through some additional points that I have.
00:14:52.622 - 00:14:53.886, Speaker B: No, keep going.
00:14:54.038 - 00:15:56.922, Speaker A: Okay, so I had a few four different points that I thought I'll add a strong view that I have, which in some ways part of my thesis, and then kind of discuss how that leads to a different conclusion, then we can talk about it. But the first one is that the market structure is just so different today. The game has changed dramatically. And all these historical analogies, I think they can be very misleading, I feel, having spent a career studying how capital flows can saturate opportunities, basically, money flows into something, and then the opportunity goes away and then maybe creates another opportunity. That's what we're talking about, right? We're seeing all sorts of evidence of that in crypto. But it leads me to believe that what will work over the last, what's worked over the last seven years in any respect, shouldn't work nearly as well over the next seven years. And so I wonder how that's going to affect the go forward performance of liquid funds or these hybrid liquid VC funds who are just applying a venture capital mandate to liquid tokens, riding the cycle up and down.
00:15:56.922 - 00:16:29.550, Speaker A: Because to me, venture style token picking probably actually competes with private venture. It's focused on the same sort of edge, and there's a lot of crossover in process for these VC funds in their ownership of liquid tokens. And I think the missing point is that it was the lack of venture as competition in 2018. And Santiago can definitely speak to this, which meant liquid or hybrid managers doing the pure VC thing on liquid tokens. That's why they had such good entry points. And you fast forward to now, and you have a much different market structure. To be honest, the market structure is fake.
00:16:29.550 - 00:16:58.590, Speaker A: Let's just start there. You have these big venture funds, they do these big rounds. It means the TGE price is like way too high, and everyone's pointing to how complicated that is. But as long as venture funds are too big, it's hard to imagine that they're not going to have a very persistent impact on the initial token price. And so we're seeing a very weak bid on this stuff. Nobody can really sell anything until prices go down a lot. But even if these things correct 80%, so something launches at 10 billion and it goes down to 2 billion.
00:16:58.590 - 00:18:06.790, Speaker A: It's not a $20 million market cap entry. And you can say all the ranges are higher now, you still, it should be a much worse entry point in a relative sense, making any adjustments because of these overfunded VC's. And so the question is, if your liquid entry points are much worse as a result of this, are you going to be able to absorb the volatility in the same way? I mean, Centaur, you mentioned like round tripping or whatever, but like, is this going to be the same game if this is the game that you're playing? To me, you have to take these opportunities even further and see that the relative opportunity here is likely to pursue a totally different mandate using a totally different source of edge. Pure liquid venture token picking is not different enough of a mandate than the thing we're saying is saturated. Let's focus on, let's do the concurrent thing, let's focus on a different strength, a different source of edge, which is actually everyone else's weakness. An approach might be to own some liquid tokens, help deliver the returns associated with these bull markets, but be nimble and be flexible, and own the new thing whenever that identifies. If it is owning the old things, you can still own the old things.
00:18:06.790 - 00:18:26.654, Speaker A: Trade each cycle independently, bring most of the capital, as much capital as you can, to the next cycle, and play that game and just compound returns. I feel strongly that if no one is recalibrating the portfolios in line with these much different regimes, and the reflexivity those who try to do so will do so in a very, very uncompetitive, are very, very uncompetitive way.
00:18:26.822 - 00:19:15.106, Speaker D: So no one has any money to bid the bottom. And if you're a fund, you're either fully allocated, you raise most of your money later in the cycle, and you deploy later in the cycle at higher valuations. And very few managers have the confidence either because structurally they can't, or they are too afraid to look at their lp's in the eye and say, I'm gonna hold cash. Yeah, it's just they don't want to do it, and either they're really bad, their emotions get to them, they need a, they're chasing, you know, when you have days that are, you're up ripping 10%, like holding cash is really fucking hard. You look like an idiot and most of your investors will call you up, think of that scene in the big shore and be like, why are you not riding this bull market? You're an idiot. Yeah, I'm redeeming as an example. Exactly.
00:19:15.106 - 00:19:54.862, Speaker D: I'm redeeming as an example. Look at Jason from Foleyus Capital. I was with him in breakpoint 2021. You had days where everything was just ripping and he was like, I've just raised $75 million. I'm holding most of that in cash because I'm not of the mind that this is going to persist. And I, as an LP in the fund, I'm like, okay, well, you're going to get a lot of pushback to that. He held most of cash and looking back, I think like, he was in a very good position throughout, like, you know, subsequent year to bid stuff where you were literally pennies on the dollar.
00:19:54.862 - 00:20:40.240, Speaker D: But like, I can't think of other managers that were in that position. I mean, it's really hard to raise at the bottom and structurally, we haven't even seen LP money come into the space. You're not, nothing is catching a bid. It's all kind of retail PvP stuff and it's very volatile for that reason. So I don't know what the solution of that is other than like raise a liquid fund, you know, hold a lot of cash because it's like that, Taleb. Like there's these moments, like if you, there's a great analysis someone did. Like if you were to bid on days where everything is down like 10% or 15, there are always days during any market regime where you have that extreme ball, have the money to bid on that day.
00:20:40.240 - 00:20:52.060, Speaker D: And if you do that time and time again, most of the return profile is going to come from those days. Problem is, no one has money in those days. They get liquidated or they're shitting their pants fully allocated.
00:20:52.400 - 00:21:33.576, Speaker A: Yeah, it brings up a good point that dealing with the allocators makes all this hard. Like, it's hard enough to manage psychology and then you got to deal with your engagement with LP's. And for sure you have to raise money in the bull market and that's this whole reflexivity model. But it kind of actually takes me to my second point, which is that if you suppress volatility in an open ended fund in the right way, you're going to bring different capital, you're bringing new capital into the space that currently can't, you know, the current options don't work. And so I don't think we should. The path is questionable, but we should also shouldn't minimize the effort. You know, we can get tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars to come into the space.
00:21:33.576 - 00:22:03.674, Speaker A: If we create a product where it's not five to ten year timeframes. It's like you have to re underwrite thing every quarter. If that's the mandate, the manager probably has a bit more comfort re underwriting the portfolio every day. They still have to deal with their emotions, the market going up, the Druckenmore thing, whatever. You have to deal with the emotional reaction to other people making money. But if the market feels like bad risk reward, then you just don't have to be involved because you have a stop out. Whether it's an actual stop out, this down 80% just doesn't work.
00:22:03.674 - 00:22:21.394, Speaker A: And Jeff can speak to this, to some very, very large pools of capital. You can argue they're bigger than the ones currently engaged in the space. And so I just think the equilibrium is there's both. There's venture funds who have to participate in the entire upside. Then there's funds who are risk managing this stuff. Maybe the returns are lower, maybe they're not. Maybe the returns are lower, but on much bigger notionals.
00:22:21.394 - 00:22:30.096, Speaker A: And that's the only way you actually fix the market structure. It's not by doing liquid venture in open ended funds, because then you're not bringing any new capital in to fill this out.
00:22:30.248 - 00:23:02.486, Speaker D: Jeff, you obviously look at a lot of managers at that vantage point that you're sitting on when people come to you and say, hey, allocate into certain managers. What are they looking for? And would this type of strategy resonate with people? Or are they saying, hey, I look at the returns of these venture funds, some of them are up 35 x 20 x, because everything was up. If you've been investor for the last seven years, you should have done that type of return. But I'm curious, one, how much appetite are you seeing? And two, what is the strategy to get the most amount of interest from these allocators?
00:23:02.678 - 00:24:16.454, Speaker C: One of the policies, if you will, that I have noticed over the years in communicating with allocators and investors is when we compare Vc to liquid strategies, the bias that is built into there is to take an equity centric valuation approach. Right. This idea that tokens have value in the way that VC creates value, ultimately deriving how equities are valued through dividends or profit share, almost kind of hamstrings an approach that I think sometimes liquid Vc itself can be a little bit insincere, because we are at a point where the nascent sea of the technologies make it quite hard to observe that value accrual. And that is actually part of the multipronged challenge. I believe at a top level, crypto has a very inherently unique value capture framework, and it rewards different kinds of capital contribution outside of financial capital, right, equities. It works because you contribute financial capital and therefore you're a passive owner to the rights of those incomes. But crypto is different.
00:24:16.454 - 00:24:35.966, Speaker C: There's actually ways which rewards capital contribution that come from other angles, like social capital in the case of those who may find value in governance, production capital, for those who actually interact with those tokens to drive network effect and the income associated with that endeavor, or the human capital behind it as well.
00:24:36.118 - 00:24:51.306, Speaker D: I'm just curious. You pitch on LP that he's going to laugh out of the room. He's like, I want a 30 x. I don't care if you're fucking staking tokens or governance. Like, I want to ride this puppy and I want the type of returns that people been getting. I mean, that's humans. It really comes down to that.
00:24:51.306 - 00:25:35.234, Speaker D: I'm not pitching, I'm going to be active in governance. I might say I'm going to be active on chain, because that's where I'm going to interact and like be close to the metal and I'm going to be smarter than a guy that's just looking at charts and drawing lines on a chart, but no one really, like, at the end of the day, like, I can agree that there's like not very concrete ways to value these things, but let's face it, allocators are looking at this and saying, I want that type of return that has been historically clocked. They don't care about how you do it or the type of strategy that you do it. They may reward you for dampening volume in the bear market. But a lot of these managers also knew and don't have much track record to it. None of them have been invested in a market environment with rising rates either, which is new.
00:25:35.362 - 00:26:27.230, Speaker A: The point though is there's this skewed return profile, like it's got disproportionately scored, and there is an allocator who the absolute returns. It's more about returns within the volatility profile, rather than stressing the volatility profile to deliver the maximum returns. And so far, the allocation process has been limited to people who basically think just like you outlined. And we haven't actually created return profiles because the volatility suppression has been flawed so far in a way to bring all this new money in. And, yeah, I mean, literally, you could talk about, there are people who want a strategy. You know, we have conversations with allocators, let's take 80% of the money, let's put that in cash, and then with the 20%, run, run a crypto strategy like that. You know, people can't do this for themselves, basically, but they want to try to access these skewed returns associated with this emerging asset class.
00:26:27.230 - 00:26:31.898, Speaker A: But it has to be in the right wrap or otherwise it's just a total non starter.
00:26:32.034 - 00:26:54.370, Speaker D: And so, yeah, well, the question for both of you is, because you both interact with lP's, like, how attractive is that strategy? Because I would argue that historically, most of it's been, I'm an event like an allocator, where I'll say, is this coming from a hedge fund bucket or a venture bucket? So you need to make that very clear for them where that's coming from. You're like, well, it's kind of liquid venture. And they're like, I don't understand that. So they'll probably pass.
00:26:54.490 - 00:27:12.118, Speaker A: That's actually my point. The liquid venture thing, it doesn't actually solve anything. It has to be a real hedge fund strategy without the drawdowns. And so it's in the hedge fund bucket. And those people, I think would. We just don't have the products yet to satiate their interest. But they're clearly interested.
00:27:12.118 - 00:27:32.180, Speaker A: I mean, let's be clear. The returns associated with crypto in the bull market, I've never seen anything like that in markets before. Like three to four sharp hundreds of percent. We just. No one has monetized that or structured it in a way for the hedge funds to do it. So even through the pure risk free lens, that is interesting. But you need to package that in a way which works for them.
00:27:32.180 - 00:28:01.948, Speaker A: And yes, so far, the attempts at doing that have been way too reckless and people blown up, and they've introduced leverage in the wrong ways. And so there's this related question of, like, does that mean it's impossible or was it just the wrong people? The discussion that rangers were having was that basically the psychological edge is just way too hard. I mean, there is such thing as psychological edge. Risk management can be a strength. It's like trading is all psychology. It's about being open minded. It's about being intellectually nimble.
00:28:01.948 - 00:28:53.310, Speaker A: And the key here is to understand how to manage risk around various markets and trades. Besides things, rights, you don't use leverage as I've been discussing, I think the VC skillset actually leads you in a worse position to do this. And I would argue there's been a lot of people who've come from tradfi before. I would say someone who is on a structuring desk in the investment bank at JP Morgan that also is not relevant for trading. It might still work out, but that doesn't actually give you a head start to working on your trading plan and how to harness your emotions. Again, I would just stress we shouldn't judge the vintage of 2018 managers to reflect what real experience and real talent is capable in the space. I'm open to a lot of different outcomes, but I don't see many real attempts at doing this in the right way.
00:28:53.890 - 00:30:16.652, Speaker C: The other thing too, the investment vehicle wrapper, matters greatly here, because if we are comparing a beta centric approach versus a liquid alpha centric approach, with the fee burden that an open ended structure is create an annual crystallization scheme. There are investors who are going to want risk management. By definition, if you have a closed end fund that is venture capital centric, where the incentives are more aligned in the distribution waterfall, then there is a lot of patience. But if you are going to charge fees annually and you have that experience of being up 200 and then down 80, etcetera, where you realize you were net worth off than maybe the GP themselves, those things are problems. Like those things create structural problems. And I don't think it's totally unfair to then understand why some investors have chosen to avoid certain types of vehicles now, as Dave said, I think there's change that could come from new trading mindsets and new financialization that is happening in crypto today. For instance, we have the bitcoin ETF now for the first time, which means eventually we'll probably have options on those ETF's and the ways in which traditional finance trading tools will merge with crypto is going to increase more and more, and there will be a path for more risk managed trading solutions.
00:30:16.652 - 00:30:34.400, Speaker C: But I do think addressing that upfront as to having the right investment vehicle structure for alignment with your lp is a key question that there has been some disservice to in the past, and one that I'm optimistic that we can actually address in the future.
00:30:35.100 - 00:31:06.470, Speaker A: Let's just say you had a PM who's worked at Millennium trading oil for the last 20 years. You think that guy's gonna blow up trading crypto? I just don't think we have the right data points yet. Trading it's a special skill set. We're not being open minded enough to. They're being literal superheroes in trading, just like there's maybe superheroes at doing vc. Whether or not those people are in crypto or not, I can't comment, but, you know, it's definitely a hard asset class. But I haven't.
00:31:06.470 - 00:31:18.170, Speaker A: I don't mean many of people have the discipline and have studied their emotional makeup to understand how to harness their own cognitive biases in a trading plan. Have you met anybody like that who's actually talking about doing that stuff?
00:31:18.510 - 00:32:08.260, Speaker D: Well, I can only comment on the conversations that you and I have frequent basis, like, whatever. No, but I will. I will jump in here, because when I first met you, Yano introduced me, and, you know, most of our conversations on a weekly basis. Like, we started talking bi weekly, like, on the regular, and it was mostly about. And it would always start with, what am I not seeing? What are my biases right now? And I think that's, like, what you should be doing. And I find that to be quite interesting. It's never about, hey, a thesis specifically about, I mean, we talk about specific things, but it's mostly like, what am I not seeing? And emotionally, how am I managing that? And I think that's like, I think that's the most important thing.
00:32:09.040 - 00:32:43.210, Speaker A: I appreciate that. The idea is like, it's just there's different sources of edge. And at this point, the one that's most exceptional in crypto is likely the psychological edge that Tushar mentioned. And again, if you come from my background, you see examples of that everywhere. There's a survivorship bias. So all the people have been in the business for 20 years, like, have that edge if they're doing this form of discretionary macro. And so I think it's just, it's kind of in line with their views that over time, these people will come in because the opportunity to do so, if you can come in and be doing the most exceptional thing, that should draw people in.
00:32:43.210 - 00:33:03.260, Speaker A: And that should be like the strongest version of their argument of trying to do something contrarian in the space. Because literally, it's like the whole space is capitulated. It's like, I've studied managers over the last seven years. This can't be done. So I'm not going to try. I'm just going to buy and hold. There's all this cognitive bias in crypto that comes from buying and holding bitcoin and ethereum.
00:33:03.260 - 00:33:38.188, Speaker A: It's like, I mistraded this because I sold. So I'm just not going to sell anything. You go back and you look at the peak in 2017, early 18, and then let's look at the top 50 assets then. And then carry that forward to how did things perform? Like, what was their performance between that peak and the next peak? In 21, 45 of the 50 assets were down by an average of like 80%. Said differently, it's not clear. We still haven't found a lot of product market fit. It's not clear that these assets actually perform in the next cycle.
00:33:38.188 - 00:34:12.368, Speaker A: And you could say this vintage is better than the last. But I think that's also been the complicated part of operating liquid strategy, is that if you're doing the buy and hold thing, maybe you're rotating into new stuff. Let's go through the math. You go down 90%, and then you rotate in the new thing, and then that thing does 100 x or whatever. Now you're still net up. But Jason, you asked this question on the podcast last time. Isn't having a top down view the most important thing? You know, they push back quite a bit, but the arithmetic is very clear.
00:34:12.368 - 00:34:41.714, Speaker A: And I think it's like, it's the wrong mental mindset to think about specifically picking tops and bottoms. Let's go through a slightly easier example. You just have to sell in September 21, October 21, November 21, December 21, Jan 22nd, February 22. Okay, that's your period. You got to sell something in that period because you realize the cycle is cooked. Then you buy a medium amount in the first three quarters of 2023. That's not picking a top and the bottom, but the real thing is very clear.
00:34:41.714 - 00:35:01.066, Speaker A: I mean, you smoked the buy and hold. Why are we trying to just say this is a reasonable thing to try to do? There's too much reflection on bitcoin, ethereum working buy and hold when almost nothing else has worked. Buy and hold. There's a few examples of this cycle that I think could work, but it's like, crypto's full of these grid. It's a graveyard full of these things.
00:35:01.218 - 00:35:12.290, Speaker D: There's so much to impact there. Like, I'll start one thing. Most managers are too afraid to tell their lp's. I'm gonna hold majors that. Yeah, especially now with ETF's. It was true before. ETF's certainly now true.
00:35:12.330 - 00:35:12.458, Speaker A: Right?
00:35:12.474 - 00:35:35.172, Speaker D: Because it's like, I'm holding a major. I'm like, well, what am I paying you? People are paying you to outperform. Sometimes that will entail holding cash or being on bitcoin or sitting on Solana Earth here. That's it. Most managers are not intellectually honest or have that relationship with RLP's. To write that fucking letter in the quarter and say we're going to cash or we are holding just majors. I'm sorry.
00:35:35.172 - 00:36:00.594, Speaker D: I'm still going to charge you 220 because I'm going to hold your hand through this very difficult asset class people are paying you for to hold their hand on an asset class that is chaotic. Yes, that's it. You either believe in the manager or you don't. That's it. And that's what I would tell people when I was managing other people's money. I'm like, there is going to be a time where you're going to question why I hold something that you can buy on Coinbase and you have to be okay with that if not put in the fucking notice.
00:36:00.722 - 00:36:14.310, Speaker A: Yeah, this happens in equities too, by the way. I mean like how much apple, Amazon, Microsoft should people, I mean, if you have an equity fund, you're supposed to own like three things over the last 15 years. But like you got like talking about doing all this other stuff, you know, it's like.
00:36:16.290 - 00:36:24.588, Speaker D: It'S like, it's like how do I over intellectualize the discourse and sound smart in my letters to justify 220? It's like no one cares, just outperform.
00:36:24.764 - 00:36:29.548, Speaker A: Yep. Again, you raise an issue where allocators are just making it hard on people.
00:36:29.684 - 00:37:26.382, Speaker D: They really do, like most of, and this is a great point, David, I'm brought, I'm glad you brought it up. I have liberty now because I don't care about, because I don't manage, I don't intend to manage other people's money, but in my observations with a lot of other managers that I'm an investor in LP's, bring on too many opinions of how the strategy should be run and put all these constraints and covenants and like you can only raise so much and you can only do this and it's like, guys, candidly, you either believe that this manager is really smart, you're investing in the person, let him, let him cook. Like just, just get out of the way. And unfortunately most LP's, and this was my disillusionment of being a public manager, is that they'll just get in the way and they won't support you. And so I think that's why I've been sourced it now. And I just, you know, I able to be more nimble and I don't miss that. Now I think if you're going to raise a fund now you want to have the most amount of liberty to do whatever it is that you want.
00:37:26.566 - 00:37:57.880, Speaker A: And I think these are good points because it's, they're not, I think I don't even take them counter to my arguments. This is why it'll take longer. You know, it's like someone will raise some money in the bull market, they'll build credibility over so long a period of time and then LP's might give them more benefit of the doubt. But yes, the flexibility here is supposed to be the edge. Like if you take the strongest version of my argument, it's like literally Im going to be like the macro fund, Im going to just find good risk reward and the rest of the time come back to flat. And if the best thing is bitcoin, were going to own that. But youre 100% correct.
00:37:58.380 - 00:38:38.370, Speaker D: A lot of the liquid funds and Im curious, before you enter the space, you canvass the market, the liquid funds, there were some, a lot of them have blown up. Most of the markets still venture what coming into the space. David, you talked about investing being so psychological. Like crypto is a pretty tough market, I guess, but I'm curious like coming into the space, you talk about certain inefficiencies, but like who would you say before setting up your fund was like doing actually interesting stuff in the liquid side and who do you think is, I guess, like what's your edge in the, the liquids?
00:38:38.530 - 00:39:21.840, Speaker A: I guess, yeah, maybe it'd be helpful if I unpacked like an overall framework I have for the space because I think it's quite helpful with this trading construct. So we call this fund reflexive capital. This concept of market reflexivity gets thrown around within crypto often. But I think like let's really unpack what it means. It's this theory of market reflexivity is based on a view that everyone has a distorted view of what's going on in markets. And price can heavily distort people's views in some part because price leaks into fundamentals and these feedback loops often occur. Where price goes up, the fundamentals look better, so people buy so then of course price goes up even more, fundamentals look even better and people buy even more.
00:39:21.840 - 00:39:45.642, Speaker A: So this is a feedback loop. You can think of it, this fuels overshooting. It works in reverse, and undershooting, boom bust, I think, is defined by these patterns. And market reflexivity is something that you can observe across markets. But crypto is uniquely reflexive because for a number of reasons. One, there's no commonly accepted heuristic on how to value this stuff. So said differently, price can go anywhere.
00:39:45.642 - 00:40:33.210, Speaker A: If these feedback loops want to drive price higher, it can literally go to infinity. Many metrics that we use to track, quote unquote fundamentals in crypto, or understand activity in the space are directly impacted by price. TvL token price triples TVL triples we oftentimes are looking for adoption and network effects, and many times people are just using protocols initially to reap the initial rewards of doing so. And so we often extrapolate that behavior. But if token price triples, the dollar incentive to come use the protocol triples. And so long winded way of saying like in the bull markets, it seems like crypto is taking over the world, and in the bear markets it seems like a yemenite total scam. And so I think these feedback loops are the most important thing to model in the space, and really is the lens at which I look through everything.
00:40:33.210 - 00:41:38.218, Speaker A: And so for my process, let's try to understand the regime, aka what is the direction of reflexivity in the market. And that shapes your view on everything else. So, to get to your question, when we think about an approach to trading, I haven't seen many examples of a return stream which successfully introduces having a macro view and helping people trade that market. So your question is a good one, because why should anybody think that they can trade this market when there's been a few examples of it working so far? So we can point back to your original question about maybe who is trying, but I would say there needs to be a certain amount of sobriety in this asset class. You kind of have to be 1ft in, 1ft out to appreciate how powerful this reflexivity is. And literally, your assumption is, this is all that's going on. You can have some long term views on crypto, maybe it's going to be important long term, but let's do one cycle at a time, and just through a macro lens, try to identify how are these dynamics making things seem good or bad? There's nothing idiosyncratic in the space.
00:41:38.218 - 00:41:40.418, Speaker A: It's all a reflection of these dynamics.
00:41:40.554 - 00:42:36.564, Speaker D: The other thing is, I think when I talk to other managers, I mean, it's easy to be like the eternally, perpetually bull, you know, in this market, because historically that's worked. I don't think we talk about enough, and maybe these are not funds. You're just large individuals that have perhaps managed the risk much better. To your point, like, I think, like, you're never gonna, there's too much focus on, like, emotionally, that it's very taxing when you sell something and then it rips on your face, and then you just hold on to stuff that is going down because you don't want to take the loss. I think it'd be better. What I've appreciated is I think you're supposed to capture 60, 70% of the upside, be comfortable with that, and then manage a lot of downside and just protect the capital because you know there's going to be a day where no one wants to touch this thing.
00:42:36.652 - 00:42:55.600, Speaker A: Okay, reflexivity model here. I don't. I don't do the astrology around the having. I'll start there. I think the having, it's a meme or whatever. But how this cycle has begun, like previous cycles, is the bitcoin goes up first and it creates this very important psychological shift that permeates everywhere in the system. The crypto people are activated.
00:42:55.600 - 00:43:21.090, Speaker A: They feel excited again. That's when the reflexivity really starts moving. You have price and fundamentals reinforcing themselves. You launched a new token a year ago. No one responds to airdrops. Now it's like things are churning, but we haven't seen a large capital inflow. And to me, that we've had some money coming to bitcoin, but into the rest of the space, to me, that's because the current outlets of that hot ball of money.
00:43:21.090 - 00:43:37.052, Speaker A: And I know this is near and dear to your heart. Santagu, we talked about this. Dog coins, cat coins, and last cycles tokens. Dog coins, catcoins. That's a stretch for institutional investors. Last cycles tokens. The basic heuristic is no one falls for the same bubble twice.
00:43:37.052 - 00:44:28.940, Speaker A: So it's very complicated to sell someone on last cycles tokens, as this is so important, you need this in your portfolio again. So until we have a new narrative about what's going on, the feedback loop is really incomplete. You can have price and fundamentals reinforcing each other, but not the real feedback loop or capitals coming in to chase this stuff. So I think sort of this move we've had since the start of Q two is actually a pretty healthy correction because your favorite assets probably not going to go away, but it allows for new leadership to emerge, to really get a new identity for the crypto cycle. And I can't tell you what that thing is, but the nice thing is, if you have a real reflexivity model, there's enough price momentum now in the majors that it should just be a matter of time before something happens. And then that's when the real cycle starts. I can argue whether you want to say it started or it's just the early stages of it, the best is yet to come.
00:44:28.940 - 00:44:54.780, Speaker A: These discussions of it being late cycle, we haven't introduced money at really high prices, which is now vulnerable to a reversal. That's how cycles end. That creates the overhang of a two year bear market. We can't actually have that yet. It's possible bitcoin just goes up for twelve months and we never create anything new. That is an option for a strategy who can't underwrite large drawdowns. Generic strategy like that.
00:44:54.780 - 00:45:05.962, Speaker A: Not commenting on my own, like, you're going to wait until you see it and you're not going to make this hypothetical bet on, like, it's definitely going to be gaming, because that's how you run into a down 40 in Q two and then you don't work for the allocators anymore.
00:45:06.106 - 00:45:20.802, Speaker D: Jeff, you've been quiet in the background. I'm curious. You guys have an ETF, everyone's tracking that. How does that change the game? Like, I think that the bull market. We're in a bull market. I think. I don't think that's been validated for a variety of reasons.
00:45:20.802 - 00:46:12.836, Speaker D: ETF and the impact that the US is shifting less anti crypto, those two things are really important for the cycle, primarily in ETF, but from a catching a bid perspective, what have you observed from talking to large allocators and how does that change? Ultimately, we need that money flowing to not just the ETF. It needs to come on, chain and bid this stuff. So I'm tracking stablecoin flows which are up on marginally moving higher, but still not there. Nowhere near. We need to see that pick up substantially for the rest of the market to catch a bid. So I'm curious, have you seen any movement, particularly in the US, and are those wheels churning now for the next three, six months or nine months for those allocators to invest in these funds?
00:46:12.948 - 00:47:10.790, Speaker C: I think for most of the investors we talk to, bitcoin is an exceptional asset and does not represent the interest of the crypto industry at large. It is, of course, the leader and the face, but it doesn't, in my opinion, capture the ethos of the asset class as a whole. So the bitcoin ETF is a particularly unique journey that bitwise is on. The ETTF, I think, does transition that a little bit into the mainstream dialogue. So we're optimistic to see the flows there in the ways that we can engage with investors that are different than the bitcoin ETF's. When I looked at the 13 f's the first time it was filed post launch in January, a part of me was disappointed by the lack of diversity of institutional funds and rias that would be found on that list. And yet, it makes sense because it's very hard to also pitch gold as a holding for money manager.
00:47:10.790 - 00:48:10.626, Speaker C: It's a little bit of a niche construct. It's not that it's valuable, it is, but it's not something that money managers are paid to hold. Ethereum is a little different because I imagine there is a world in which the likes of code two and other venture and tech centric crossover funds will find having a small allocation to ETH as a bet on a big pie of the future of technology as a platform could be justified as an investment mandate. So the types of holders we might see in the next iteration of the 13 FS will give us a window into the kinds of clients that it serves. And that's where I think we'll slowly start to make the transition into the next frontier as we've talked about altcoins and all these other things that are still perhaps a little bit nascent in the ability to have captured durable return deliveries. But I'm optimistic that ETH ETF is ushering on the era for that conversation to be had here, at least fit wise.
00:48:10.698 - 00:48:57.236, Speaker B: Hey everyone, Jason here just wanted to take a quick break to talk about something exciting in the world of blockchain.

00:51:42.806 - 00:52:17.080, Speaker D: So are you. I mean, of course, none of this financial advice, but we can talk generic terms. But like, how has, I guess the last three or six months been from an investing perspective? Because it's not been an easy environment. And what are perhaps some of the things that you've changed in your mental model this cycle that you think have helped you or will help you out perform.
00:52:17.990 - 00:53:18.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I can kick this off. There was a comment that also was made in the last podcast with Tushar where he mentioned that the idea of one single manager that's so all rounded, that can do everything, picking fundamental and trading data around it, running market neutral strategies, all of those things, as a single manager, is frankly impossible. And so you should actually just go with the best manager for the best single strength that they could be known for. I agree with the former assessment, which is essentially at the core of the underpinning of why we run a multi manager approach. And I think the last six months gives us a little bit of the purview of that importance. So the last six months we've seen the kinds of varieties of return that I think are offered by multistrategy format. You have the bitcoin ETF allowing discretionary macro trading that someone like Dave, with his expert mindset on reflexivity, would no doubt capture, as well as trend strategies that are computer driven, also capture.
00:53:18.110 - 00:54:27.396, Speaker C: And then you saw that in March, maybe high frequency trading strategies around the kind of crazy mania around meme tokens would have been the most interesting risk adjusted reward at that point in time. And then in April, it actually shifted to, I would say, something that was happening in the DeFi landscape in Pendle and Athena. And as Dave said, tokens that catch bids in this cycle versus prior cycles, likely different contenders. And so the need for actively overlaying those kinds of novel primitives is really important. You saw that same iteration again in May and June, with the opportunities available within Eigen layer, and the farming opportunities, and the partnerships with various abssein. So, to answer your question, Santi, I think that one of the virtues, at least, that we try to bring upon here at Bitwise's approach is to give investors a very broad set of comprehensive suites to accessing each of these things, including reflexive macro trading as a core component, and possibly the most interesting component, but one that also benefits from having a buffer around orthogonal return vectors in the liquid strategy.
00:54:27.428 - 00:55:09.742, Speaker A: As we define it, every cycle is different. And one of the difficulties in fully systematizing any process is that your sample size is one and a half. You want to identify the regime, you have one and a half cycles you can look at. We need to have stable coins two cycles ago. So how can you systematize your stablecoin indicator that you mentioned, which I think is a good one you're trying to understand, flows into the space so that's been probably the most important part of, I think, understanding where things have gone. So it's the difference in flows in q one versus q two was dramatic. And that's on the bitcoin ETF side, that's on the stable coin side as an indicator there.
00:55:09.742 - 00:55:56.648, Speaker A: But then this idea of these unlocks that really started picking up a q two demand slowed down at literally the worst time, and then some of the technical selling in late q two. So, yeah, I think the market is still just in. Like, it's like a medium bet, I guess, is what I would say. There's a much better game to be played at some point in the cycle if we get the reflexivity going. And so I think for a trader who tries to calibrate the quality of bets with the size of their risk taking, it wouldn't have made sense to have been really 100% fully loaded this whole time. If you want to preserve. It's really, how do I increase my chip stack one day at a time to play the Super bowl which is still upon, is still upon us.
00:55:56.648 - 00:56:31.946, Speaker A: That's an overall framework. You asked a question about what? I've kind of updated my views based on the cycle. I guess it was surprising in q four and then in q one to some extent, how much last cycles tokens bounce. So we've done quite a bit of research showing that most of these things are just going to die. They're just not going to be featured in the next cycle. That was a view, but the stuff bounced hard. I guess the question is, as the hot ball of money in crypto forms, people just go buy their old favorites, and that can be good for quite a pump in some of the stuff.
00:56:31.946 - 00:57:14.494, Speaker A: But then, since then, I think the view has been validated that this stuff will probably just go down forever. When something new emerges, it's not going to pull this stuff up in the same way. It's still employing a fresh mind to what the new thing will be and try to maximize that bet. The second thing is actually just how fake the market structure is now. How big of an impact these large venture rounds are having on the overall market structure when there's no new money coming in, really, and no new money coming in to buy that stuff at that valuation. How do you actually create an asymmetric risk reward argument around things at those valuations? It's basically impossible. My first principles thing, everyone in crypto is here for the convexity.
00:57:14.494 - 00:57:19.286, Speaker A: So you have to screen stuff through that lens at all times on that.
00:57:19.318 - 00:58:17.666, Speaker D: Point around old coins. I think the distinction and the nuance is old coins with a healthy amount of circulating tokens, there could be old coins that never unlocked and are just unlocking. Those have materially underperformed stuff like maybe defi stuff that has been kind of left for dead even before rates were going up, that has caught a meaningful bid because you could argue there's arguably the closest semblance to any fundamentals are in those tokens. They have most of the supplies already unlocked and that's been absorbed and that's changed hands to people that are more in it. For what is the next leg look like? Not so much. You know, if you're holding stuff that is just unlocking, you're probably still up three to six x and you're really trying to get above your watermark. And so you are indifferent and you're indiscriminately selling, and you don't care if it's a six x or a three x or a two x.
00:58:17.666 - 00:58:23.362, Speaker D: You just want to be in the green to eat this year because you didn't eat last year and you got.
00:58:23.386 - 00:58:25.282, Speaker A: DPI's and stuff and you got DPI's.
00:58:25.306 - 00:58:43.100, Speaker D: And all that stuff. And so that's the challenge. Like, for me, it's very simple. I'd rather own stuff that I make less of the nuance around. Is it new or old? It's more of. I think the market's really woken up to this idea of, like, looking at, like, unlocks. And not all unlocks are the same.
00:58:43.100 - 00:58:53.538, Speaker D: I think you also can overlay that with secondary market activity and interest. But for the most part, like, it's been very challenging owning something that is unlocking.
00:58:53.724 - 00:59:02.910, Speaker A: Worst factor has been unlocks. I mean, you know, if you actually would have been running that systematically like that, that, I mean, that's one of the cleanest trades I've seen. Kind of doing the post mortem analysis.
00:59:02.990 - 00:59:06.830, Speaker D: I want to go as far as shorting, but, yeah, I would just not.
00:59:06.870 - 00:59:53.910, Speaker A: That's a different discussion, which we can have. But I would say, yeah. The reason I'm focused on this old stuff versus new stuff is the old stuff, I think, activates crypto people different. Like, if this is about. If the whole question here, like, how do we get a crypto cycle, how do we bring in a few, you know, some tens of billions of new money to the space? So one way is it just comes into bitcoin, and then the bitcoin, whoever sells the bitcoin buys some of the old stuff. But if we're actually talking about a conversation where you're going to need to get money to come in to buy something which gets non crypto people excited. I feel pretty strongly that the old stuff is not inspiring to in that way because the post mortem is that, that was a bubble, you know, that was, that was a scam.
00:59:53.910 - 01:00:01.886, Speaker A: Like we saw that movie before. And so this is, you know, this is one of the reasons it's also really hard to get all the same.
01:00:01.918 - 01:00:28.040, Speaker D: Short, you don't have the overhang, like, I would say in this category, gaming tokens, for instance. You have axies of the world. I would. I haven't looked, but, like, the chart has. I mean, it's rebounded quite a bit. Everything's rebounded a lot from low. I guess the question is, your point is, like, people lost money on this because everything was down 80% and so they'd rather not touch stuff that they've been hurt on.
01:00:28.040 - 01:01:01.782, Speaker D: The question more so is who's actually buying these things? Is it people that have owned it before or people that are just coming in new and saying, my buddy, I remember made money on Axie last cycle, so, oh, look, it's down 90%. This shit's on sale. Or is it like, you'd rather own stuff that has no emotional cachet? It's just new. No one's been hurt. It's just kind of like new narrative, new meta. Or can you own both? And you're just being more selective on the type of asset.
01:01:01.886 - 01:01:35.578, Speaker A: The question is, what do you think the fraction of people is in count, not asset weighted, who actually made money last cycle? Like, do you think there's more people that know someone that lost money in Axie or made money on Axie? I mean, maybe in the Philippines, different story, but, like, you know, I'd say that the majority in count probably lost money. And so it might work the other way where it's like, my buddy lost money because he thought this was going to cure cancer and it didn't. And so I want to be inspired by something new, and then my, my mind can go anywhere. I mean, this could, this could be the thing. This is it. Like, we could take over. Like, this is the, the first real thing.
01:01:35.578 - 01:02:01.420, Speaker A: There's a question of, like, what actually gets people to be activated in that way. Like, it's probably, maybe it's be more tangible, like deepin, whatever, blah, blah, but you can have that discussion. But that, to me, is when that is when that happens. Could be new token distribution mechanism, could be regulatory impact, but could be a new sector as well. That will inspire money to come in, because you just. You need to think through the lens of someone who is not in this little cult. And they're like, I need to convince them to be like, I need crypto my portfolio.
01:02:01.420 - 01:02:13.160, Speaker A: Again, it's not, you know, and that's like, that's a pretty high bar at higher rates and competing with AI and some of these things could change. But right now, it's certainly, we haven't found anything that's really close.
01:02:13.700 - 01:03:07.736, Speaker C: I was going to add that I just saw a very comprehensive study on various factor models that are being used to think through those types of dynamics. It's probably one of the most intensely researched ones I've seen. And they try to use the Fama French model to think through things like momentum, value, growth, et cetera, and run a pretty balanced empirical study, running 100 longs, 100 shorts as a basket, rebalanced weekly, monthly, et cetera. And you actually do get to see that the growth factor is one of the most persistent factor. But when you actually dig a little deeper and try to understand where that risk premium is coming from, what you find is that most of the p and l actually comes from your short basket. You're not making money on the trading of the hundred longs as much as you would like to. You're actually killing it on the hundred short that you are consistently resizing.
01:03:07.736 - 01:03:35.460, Speaker C: And so I just want to add that context in the ways that I think we're talking about revivals of old coins, the ways that it could be worthwhile. And yet the vast majority, over the last six years at least, would have been the incredible opportunity to bet on growth, but in the other direction, which I thought was interesting. Of course, the other things you would have expected momentum, very strong indicator things that were not as strong.
01:03:35.960 - 01:03:38.020, Speaker D: How do you quantify growth in this space?
01:03:38.560 - 01:04:10.610, Speaker C: This particular study looked at a variety of measures, but the two that they landed on was TVL to market cap as a very crude measure, as one. And then the other one was growth in weekly user growth engagements. And those are the two variables that they studied, which, of course, tells you right now, it would make sense to you that the things that rank poorly on those things would go to zero, essentially. And there is the opportunity to make.
01:04:10.730 - 01:04:38.988, Speaker A: This is reflexivity in a nutshell. It's like, literally, okay, we've screened some of these factors ourselves. Okay, what works? Momentum works, whatever. What also works is new wallet creation or one of these fundamental metrics. What works better than both those independently, is when both are working. When you have both the momentum factor and the growth factor, some fundamental measure, whether it's on the long or short side, that's been one of the best things we've seen for meme coins.
01:04:39.004 - 01:04:46.612, Speaker D: The most important thing is number of wallets. How is that growing on a daily, hourly, daily, weekly. And that's a leading indicator, at least for me. Right.
01:04:46.756 - 01:05:38.750, Speaker A: We wanted to go back to talking about how do you identify the regime, run that sub strategy that'll tell you when something's changing. It's like you go back to if you have a constellation of what's working in markets and then something stops working, maybe it's not picking literally the top in those 20 minutes, but to understand on a slow moving basis when something is shifted under the hood in the market in order to say okay, this might be, we might be in a really different new regime. That's one thing where suddenly it's like the growth and momentum, things stop reinforcing each other, or now they're really reinforcing each other in the negative direction where all the users are literally gone because price is going down. Obviously if you're getting feedback that trade's working, you should change the regime from what it was working in the other way. So we run some of this. Well I think it's a good idea to run some of this stuff too to help identify, yeah. Where we're at.
01:05:38.910 - 01:06:17.820, Speaker D: So the challenge, David, with reflex 30, I think personally for me is that I just one don't believe that I'm smarter than the collective market. And I, it's challenging because like my realization coming from traditional finance venture, super competitive private equity, incredibly competitive. And so you're of the mind that you don't have an edge. I'd rather think that I don't have an edge because everyone that I talk to that thinks has an edge either blows up eventually or underperforms. Like you listen to Stan Druckenmiller like in the stone conference, he's incredibly humble. He's like, I don't know, like markets change, I don't know. And he's like the best performing investor of all time.
01:06:17.820 - 01:06:44.718, Speaker D: And he's like uncertain. So why would I think that? I'm like super certain, even though I've been in this space for twelve years. But like I did have to recalibrate my thinking of saying, hey, most people actually don't do the work and are not very sophisticated, which is what inspired you to come into the space, which is highly inefficient and you can have an edge if you do the work. If you're looking at on chain stuff, number of wallets, that's an edge. And a lot of managers are not, like, in the weeds, I would think.
01:06:44.894 - 01:06:45.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you're.
01:06:45.894 - 01:06:47.342, Speaker D: But how do you balance that?
01:06:47.366 - 01:07:19.574, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I think it's literally just that the trading edge, you know, it's like, okay, I used to trade macro. I had a thousand people at these big funds doing the exact same thing as me with the exact same apparent edge. And so, you know, now it's like, are you literally the best? You know, are you. Are you standing Druckenmiller against these people? And so then you bring that exact same edge into the space, and there's just no one else. It's like, not only is no one else in playing that edge, they're saying that this edge is impossible there, you know, obviously.
01:07:19.622 - 01:07:34.296, Speaker D: But the emotions kick in, right? So, so, okay, everyone has. We're trading that. We're trading the meme super cycle. You're seeing wallet growth, like week over week. You're like, okay, I'm gonna. I'm gonna get behind this trade. So you put in a position that starts to slow down.
01:07:34.296 - 01:07:53.758, Speaker D: What do you do? Like, there's two views in my brain. One is memes will do well. Verna, bull market memes will do well. They have done. In every regime, they've done well. So, okay, so you have that long term thesis for the cycle, but then all of a sudden you're seeing wallet growth for a particular coin or just in general, go down and. And flows go down.
01:07:53.758 - 01:08:12.806, Speaker D: Do you cut all the position? Do you. How do you. How do you manage that? Because then these things with. With the ball of these things in a weekly, you can get destroyed, man. Like, rebuying a position, super difficult. Seeing other people make money also sucks. So what do you do?
01:08:12.918 - 01:08:14.990, Speaker A: Okay, so I'll be your trading coach now, and, you know.
01:08:15.030 - 01:08:15.478, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
01:08:15.494 - 01:08:28.176, Speaker A: I've worked with trading coaches my whole life. Like, they're just therapists. Right. And the reason that there's not a very specific answer is it's just. It's all about your emotions, right? It's not that the best people. I don't have emotions, you know, less emotions. I mean, I have two kids.
01:08:28.176 - 01:08:54.765, Speaker A: Like, one's five and two, they would have. I would need to impose very different training. Like, the five year old probably isn't made out to be a traitor, but I would say, like, you know, the question is what it's. Having done this long enough to understand which emotions make. Have you make the most costly mistakes and then design a plan around them. It's like, it's not hiding from them, it's like literally identifying them and then building a trading plan which works for them. And so the answer could be you cut some.
01:08:54.765 - 01:09:28.426, Speaker A: The answer could be, you know, you get it all together. The answer could be you're selling all the way up, because identifying that the information has changed in a way and making a really rational decision. Like, you're too susceptible to thinking that meme coins are gonna take over the world. Like, you know, I may not have that problem, whatever. So, you know, it's all very personal, but the key is, like, to do this for ten or 20 years or whatever and then have a view of how you interact with it. And crypto is different, so you have to adapt all this stuff. I mean, it's more momentum than meaner version, and so different parts of your plan, but this is the trade, you know, it's not based on pure analysis.
01:09:28.618 - 01:09:57.512, Speaker D: I'll tell you my personal experience. So I've recalibrated a couple of things this cycle. One shifted my views in terms of Solana. I may have not caught it at eight, but I sized it progressively more and more. And I. None of this financial advice, but, like, changing that view of saying it was hard because sometimes when you don't catch the absolute bottom, people are screaming at you like you're an idiot. You had the opportunity to do buy it at eight, now it's up 20, as was the best trade in size you could have done, and you missed it.
01:09:57.512 - 01:10:27.060, Speaker D: So if you're a manager, you're sitting there and you're like, fuck, I get paid to be right, very right. And I just probably missed the best rate of the cycle. What am I, like, what do I do? And so then, and then, and then you're trying to. You put on way more risk to catch up, and we know how that ends. For me, this cycle, if I were to probably say one thing that I've probably done better than prior cycles, is just getting comfortable with it. I'm not going to catch you absolute bottom, but I'm going to size it progressively and I apply it like Defi summer as an example. We were very early.
01:10:27.060 - 01:10:49.118, Speaker D: I was lucky in part, but even then you could have sized that trade. Like, you had three to six months. The market gave you three to six months to really put on that trade and, like, blow it out of the water. But most people, again, were, like, too paralyzed to do that because they didn't take the bottom. And so I think overcoming that emotionally is probably one of the most important things.
01:10:49.254 - 01:11:02.806, Speaker A: I totally agree. And that's the mental flexibility thing. And it's like, I think if you appreciate the momentum properties of this asset class, it's almost like the bottom is a worse bet than, than the third inning. Right, right.
01:11:02.838 - 01:11:04.862, Speaker D: Because it's like, very much like probability.
01:11:04.926 - 01:11:06.622, Speaker A: Times magnitude is much higher.
01:11:06.806 - 01:11:07.238, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:11:07.294 - 01:11:14.990, Speaker A: You know, it's like the picking the bottom thing. It's just there's way too much focus on that. You know, catching the falling knife is a meme for a reason. But anyway, keep going. Sorry.
01:11:15.030 - 01:11:38.500, Speaker D: Absolutely. The other one is like the, the duration component, like the long term versus short term component. It's tough. Right. Because when you see an asset, like, say, a particular meme coin, they're down. Like, I don't know, 60%, maybe 70%, you're still way up. But it's the anchoring effect that is so difficult.
01:11:38.500 - 01:12:12.972, Speaker D: Your point? So November 2021 rates are going up. Market starts going down. As you alluded to earlier, the market gave you, again, three to six months to get out. My appreciation now position, we've talked about this in private conversations, is I think the, probably the most important thing is appreciating. You're never going to tick the bottom or the top, but you want to be positioned in things that have a pretty big entry and exit door because you want to be able to get out when the fire starts or the flood starts. And a lot of times the illiquidity is what kills you, man.
01:12:13.076 - 01:12:18.914, Speaker A: And I think what's the right discount rate on illiquidity? I mean. Yeah, all these, like, all these instruments that are discounted.
01:12:19.012 - 01:12:41.410, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. So I think being comfortable of like. Yeah, you might. How far do you push out on the risk spectrum? But I think most people in the space have underappreciated how important liquidity is because liquidity dries up very quickly and comes out very quickly, too. And so I'd rather wait for liquidity to come in. And maybe that's, like, where we are now. Right.
01:12:41.410 - 01:12:53.986, Speaker D: I'm probably not doing anything because things are choppy. And I don't know, I think in this environment, the more you over trade, you're probably going to just lose my.
01:12:54.018 - 01:13:08.610, Speaker A: Response, which I only half believe is maybe people don't actually want the liquidity, they actually appreciate it, but they don't want it because then they have to trade it. This resignation, this capitulation on trading means the more I don't have to make decisions, the better.
01:13:08.770 - 01:13:36.514, Speaker D: Yeah. Most people, venture capitalists in traditional markets have the best job in the world. Told they wait ten years to be either told they're extremely right or wrong. Yeah, but, yeah, I don't think you should run away from volatility. I think you should run straight into it, because that's if you. It's a mind shift, and as soon as you appreciate that, at least it's been helpful for me, it's like, all right, well, you wake up one day, you see something down 20%, you're like, great. It's something I like.
01:13:36.514 - 01:13:40.436, Speaker D: I'm gonna buy it. I should be buying it. But you need to have cash.
01:13:40.588 - 01:13:41.840, Speaker A: Yep. And a plan.
01:13:42.180 - 01:13:45.356, Speaker D: And a plan. Yeah. How often do you change your plan?
01:13:45.548 - 01:14:16.158, Speaker A: You know, you can go through it every day and update the information, but I think the core parts of it are, yeah, they're supposed to be pretty well designed around, you know, your process and the big picture of what's going on. So it's like, you update the information, but in theory, the plan is supposed to reflect, you know, your backwards looking. Like, this is how I need to trade this to prevent making all the mistakes and avoid the pitfalls. So that part shouldn't really change.
01:14:16.294 - 01:14:46.810, Speaker D: So, like you said today, like, this week is pretty important that you have the FMC. Like, you're going to have rate cuts, but then you have the jobless claims today, and, like, you know, and then you have the predict, you know, Kamala odds are going up. But, like, we have an ETF and we have the US shifting, like, slowly from being super anti crypto to irregardless of whether Kamala or Trump win. I think it's just, it's a shift. It's an inflection point. I think if you fast forward two years from now, we're going to look back and say, holy fuck, it was an ETF, and the US kind of shifted gears. I should have been long.
01:14:46.970 - 01:14:52.210, Speaker A: Yeah, well, two years from now, we've been down 90% already, so maybe, like, 15 months.
01:14:52.370 - 01:15:21.064, Speaker D: True. The question is, like, how much you respond to, like, this stuff? Or you put on size and you just say, is the narrative still the same? If it is, I'm not going to do anything. I'm just going to maybe try to raise more capital because I'm going to lean into this trade for the next 15 months and I shouldn't overthink it. We're in a bull market. I should be buying stuff, and I'm going to cost average my way down if things trade sideways, I think the.
01:15:21.072 - 01:15:58.500, Speaker A: Void of competition is on the one to one to three month time horizon. So there's like the short term, you know, I wouldn't say it's chaotic. I would say the high frequency firms have done a pretty good job of noticing patterns. And that's like really complicated to swing the stuff around on a daily basis. I don't think there's that as much edge in doing that, but kind of understanding the big picture, identifying the regime, like, that's probably the place where I think is least competitive. And so to answer your question, yeah, you would probably take somewhat of a longer term view, but it's not like you would say, I'm going to be 100% long altcoins because of all this stuff, because it's still very complicated. Supply and demand.
01:15:58.500 - 01:16:07.608, Speaker A: In the short term, you need to upgrade the regime to money coming into the space for so many things to perform. And right now you can basically say that about bitcoin.
01:16:07.784 - 01:16:30.450, Speaker D: Jeff, if you had the choice to go back to traditional finance and do hedge fund macro trading, would you like, would you do it? Like knowing everything that you know now and how difficult this market is? Like, why bother? Like, you could, you could probably be living a better life. Market actually closes.
01:16:30.990 - 01:17:36.440, Speaker C: You know, it's a funny question. I think that the path that we're all on as promoting opportunities and liquid strategies is a noble one, and it's a tough path, but one that is worthwhile, I think, precisely because of all the things we chatted about. Once you see what crypto can afford in the unique properties it delivers on, not just the liquidity, but its volatility and the scale at a global reach, there's really nothing else I think macro investors would be more intrigued by in finding those profit opportunities. I also go back to something that we're taught early as investors. Something Harvard also preached upon in part of the endowment model, is that to make extra return, one of the ways to do it is to take more liquidity, right? Take that illiquidity premium. And that's why venture at some level is a compelling way to think through that construct. It's also why people believe you should be out compensated for private equity versus public equity, and private credit versus public credit, etcetera.
01:17:36.440 - 01:18:25.096, Speaker C: That may be entirely false. Fang and Mac Seven might have outperformed private equity, but all that being said, I think there's also this unique backwardation of your liquidity risk premium in crypto. And that's why macro trading is so interesting and exciting. Like, if I told you that the S and P 500 was not a 1015 volume index, but a 70 to 100 volume index. The return premium you would want for crypto VC would have to be hundreds more than what you would expect for traditional private equity. If you think about that relative discount and the value gap that exists for the opportunity set within liquid versus vc, I wake up every day compelled, excited and intrigued by all the ways to make money in liquid crypto. I know we talked about reflexive global macro trading as one, but as mentioned before, there are so many interesting things happening here.
01:18:25.096 - 01:19:18.590, Speaker C: Millennium as a multi pod model, one of the most successful things they've ever done is an index rebalancing, something so uninteresting to most people, but something that was so profitable for a period of time where yes, no one's going to invest in a single strategy, indexing rebalancing hedge fund strategy, but is it useful as a conduit of a bigger build out of a multi strat? 100% so I agree with Ray in the podcast prior to where there is a lack of interest for investors to want market neutral returns in crypto, but that's because it's presented the wrong way. You need that to be a part of a broader toolkit that push out the efficient frontier and help deliver on the higher quality risk adjusted sortino ratio. So I'm enthused by that mission. I wake up every day glad to do it, especially privileged to be doing it at Bitwise. And so I'm super pumped to see where we go in the next few years about that institutional adoption.
01:19:19.130 - 01:20:18.656, Speaker D: Yeah, I keep referencing this book, the missing billionaires, and they raised really good points around how you think about compounding your capital and how people fully just don't appreciate that. I think it summarizes a lot of what we've been talking about here. It's that people try to play too cute on playing it perfectly because people are larping on crypto Twitter that they're so successful and super profitable trading strategies. The reality is a lot of to your point, David, it's hard to make money sustainably in the space. And I think what may have worked in prior cycles is not working this cycle, and it's most people are really resistant to that change. Meanwhile, there's market makers and people that are running more market neutral strategies that are clipping 1718 20% a year with really low risk, smart contract risk, what have you, and the law is 72. Whatever your return is on a yearly basis, that's how many years it takes.
01:20:18.656 - 01:20:33.452, Speaker D: Dividend 72 divided by your return is however many years it's going to take for you to double your capital, the difference between 10%, 1212 percent, 15 and 18% return is massive when you think about doubling your capital.
01:20:33.636 - 01:20:36.452, Speaker A: Now do the math on the drawdowns. Yeah.
01:20:36.476 - 01:20:38.132, Speaker D: And the math under you did it.
01:20:38.236 - 01:20:44.052, Speaker A: No, I'm saying now do the math on the drawdown. Exactly. 80% is, I mean, whatever, it's huge, right?
01:20:44.156 - 01:21:24.056, Speaker D: Because if you wipe out 80%, I mean, yeah, the amount of return that you need to overcompensate. So I think the highlight for me is, I think it's more of understanding. It's like a second derivative. It's understanding, yeah. Your emotions and controlling those and not necessarily controlling, just being aware of them and your biases and reflecting on that constantly to avoid mistakes, knowing that you're not going to get it perfectly right and just being comfortable with that. The second one, I think, is just appreciating how other people are doing or not doing exactly that. For me, Solana, it's clear to me that most people are resistant.
01:21:24.056 - 01:21:45.890, Speaker D: It's still not a consensus trade because I observe these managers and a lot of them are trying to over intellectualize why it's not going to be a thing because they probably missed it. And so, like, I'm trying to observe what, how other people and how their emotional process is by virtue of like what they're tweeting, what they're saying in conversations, public and private, and just kind of like using that as an edge, if you will.
01:21:46.010 - 01:22:16.548, Speaker A: Yeah. One thing is every trader or whatever person who's interacting with markets is a victim of their first success. I've always observed this. It's like you can never get away from your first girlfriend or whatever. It's like for me, I was an interest trader. Is this steepener trade? It doesn't really matter for so many people. Ethereum was a kingmaker for them in one way or another, and that leads to a lot of inflexible thinking.
01:22:16.548 - 01:22:58.726, Speaker A: We'll put it charitably. And I don't want to discredit it, but I'm just pointing out not bearish theory, whatever, but it's a trend that I've observed quite a bit from coming into the space to tie together a few of the thoughts myself, like you're trying to do. I think just building off this discussion from last week, there's a really big relative opportunity here. Buying and holding liquid tokens. Trying to the venture thing is an answer, but I think there's probably a bigger relative opportunity, which is to bring in some psychological or trader edge. And as a result. What might happen here is you create an actual track record, which can bring in a lot of new money to the space.
01:22:58.726 - 01:23:23.774, Speaker A: Again, this untapped resource of people who look through this no big drawdowns, sharpe ratio lens. I think that's the only way you actually fix this market structure issue. And it's probably not going to happen fast based on all the points you raised about why allocators will be slow to adopt. But that's the forward that I'm much interested in. And it could be like five to seven years away if I were to.
01:23:23.782 - 01:23:52.452, Speaker D: Take a bet on where most of the money comes. Maybe not this cycle, but over the next subsequent cycles compared to like the prior cycles. It's on this type of strategy. As you have more, you may be smaller this cycle, but as you compound more track record, I think the smart investors can't overlook the fact that you dampened volume, the downside, and you captured most of the return on the upside, whereas most managers roundtripped. And for an allocator to have to explain that to their pension fund, it's just not tolerable for them. It won't be.
01:23:52.556 - 01:24:20.074, Speaker A: Yeah. And not to add to the list, but I, the contemporaneous, like all the biased allocators have at this point, are related to their engagement in other markets where, yeah, basically human beings can't, you know, market time. Like we're not, we're not paying people to market time and stock pick anymore to some extent. And so, you know, there's this like nineties analogy, but you're working your way up this wall of bias where it's like, okay, I need to do it like four times. Okay, well, now it's like 2032, whatever.
01:24:20.122 - 01:24:55.276, Speaker D: So Jeff, ill let you add this, but the perverse, I guess the counter to that is weve all heard hedge funds have underperformed the market. They still keep getting a ton of money. And I think theres some element of psychologically, the allocator is saying, im not going to get fired if we get money to Andreessen Horowitz or to named hedge fund, because thats what Im supposed to do. Thats a mosque approach to portfolio construction. And the reality is just punt the s and p. But you know, it's, it's, people sometimes do decisions to justify their job, not to principal agent problem. Right.
01:24:55.276 - 01:25:25.138, Speaker D: It's sort of like I get paid to find good managers, Jeff, no disrespect. And so it's sort of like I need to like allocate money to someone that charges me 220, when the reality is I could just invest in the s and P or invest in the, you know, index. So, you know, that might be the challenge for this type of strategy. But I. But. But even then, I'm sort of reminded that, like, if you clock more than like four x as a. As a fund venture, call it, you're like top tier.
01:25:25.138 - 01:25:45.060, Speaker D: Like, if you look at NBCA data, a vintage is like, you know, the return profile of most venture funds and hedge funds is like pretty bad. Like in crypto, you still. You're not going to have probably the 20 to 30 x vintages, but you. That probably comes down. But even if you're clocking like five x, six x, you're like s tier.
01:25:45.640 - 01:26:07.140, Speaker A: And the trading one is, if you're achieving a too sharp without introducing a bunch of counterparty risk or cybersecurity risk or smart contract, you can actually feel like there's not some weird risk transformation of those things to create the returns. If you can achieve that, that looks really good for a lot of other one sharp things in your portfolio.
01:26:08.690 - 01:26:40.390, Speaker C: And I'll push back a little bit on the hedge fund narrative, Santi, that you have put on, which is the reality is that as an industry, it might have shrunk, but the best keep growing. And that's the name of that particular game. If you're in the top decile or quartile, you take market share. So I have not yet heard of any investor who can't find a way to want more of millennium, more of citadel, more of de Shaw, more renaissance technology, etcetera. So I would just contextualize the law of average here is less relevant when it comes to alpha seeking endeavors.
01:26:40.930 - 01:27:12.198, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a really good point. Anything else, guys? I know it's been a bit of a chaotic discussion, but I think a really good one, and I'm glad we had it. I would love to maybe explore this in a separate pod. I've had a pod talking about my mistakes. I'm not a trader, but I guess the market forces you to be a trader. Um, but I think diving deeper on the emotional side of trading would be super helpful. I think, for people that are.
01:27:12.198 - 01:27:14.650, Speaker D: I know our audience would appreciate it a lot.
01:27:14.950 - 01:27:22.822, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of physiological things you can do, too. I mean, you know, there's. There's plenty of literature out there and. And coaching to be had.
01:27:23.006 - 01:27:28.294, Speaker D: Um, is this a Wendy type of coach for everyone that's watched billions?
01:27:28.342 - 01:27:31.318, Speaker A: Wendy Rhodes? Yeah, there are Wendy Rhodes out there in real life.
01:27:31.374 - 01:27:33.520, Speaker D: I have. I have Wendy actually.
01:27:33.640 - 01:27:35.416, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I had the same.
01:27:35.448 - 01:27:37.940, Speaker D: One actually, but yeah.
01:27:39.080 - 01:27:40.600, Speaker B: You guys shared the same coach?
01:27:40.720 - 01:27:45.744, Speaker D: I think we did at one point. I don't, I don't use her anymore, but I have other people.
01:27:45.872 - 01:27:48.500, Speaker B: She's the woman who has like a hundred thousand followers on Twitter.
01:27:49.520 - 01:27:52.808, Speaker A: I don't know, but heavy physiological approach.
01:27:52.904 - 01:27:54.260, Speaker D: Disclose my edge.
01:27:56.200 - 01:28:01.106, Speaker A: Making sure your body's in a good place to make rational decisions at the point of making decisions.
01:28:01.178 - 01:28:06.570, Speaker D: Yeah, like I've done neurofeedback, all kinds of stuff like your breathing great, your sleep. Like all these things are super important.
01:28:06.690 - 01:28:09.310, Speaker B: Dave, did you get better or worse at trading with kids?
01:28:11.730 - 01:28:20.098, Speaker A: I think it's been kind of neutral because you basically stop out of having a life otherwise and so, you know, trade crypto and have your kids and whatever.
01:28:20.234 - 01:28:30.420, Speaker D: Some people, some people tweeted that their, their ability to manage risk has been put into a different perspective with kids and how they think about compounding, preserving capital.
01:28:31.160 - 01:28:40.060, Speaker A: There's also like more emotional about parenting than trading. So, you know, it's like providing some perspective there too, you know?
01:28:40.800 - 01:28:45.064, Speaker D: What about dog coins? I mean, dogs are like manageable.
01:28:45.112 - 01:28:50.720, Speaker A: Volatility in the big picture. Anyway, thanks guys.
01:28:50.760 - 01:28:59.790, Speaker D: Anyways, good job, guys. This really good. Any parting thoughts, Jeff or David? Where can people find you? Recommendations of books? Closing thoughts?
01:29:01.690 - 01:29:36.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't have much of a public presence, but I think there's quite a bit of literature out there. I think to be inspired, you go back and read some of these books about hedge fund managers in the nineties. The markets wizards book inside the house of money. This was a different time and crypto might be the last frontier. There could be something new. The ability to apply these things as human beings with like a weaker role of technology and no competition for traders. I mean, that it's a pretty inspiring, it can be really inspiring reads to work on these things, but hopefully there's edge that comes out of it.
01:29:36.940 - 01:29:44.640, Speaker D: Isn't it true that most of that, so market wizard is a book, a great book, by the way. Every chapter is a new manager. Isn't the case that most of those managers blew up eventually?
01:29:45.100 - 01:30:22.078, Speaker A: So I think the oftentimes it's describing like a 20 year career or whatever. So it's not like the 20 1822 year old in crypto that blew up like 18 months later. But it's like the landscape change. It's like all these same guys have struggled to outperform. And you have fewer examples of these types of guys these days because of the amount of competition, technology and human beings again, I mean, there are only so many examples these days of people who repeatedly outperformed in macro. And you asked Jeff this question, like, do you want to go back to old job? I mean, me personally, I will be humble and honest. This is a big part of the reason that I'm here.
01:30:22.078 - 01:30:25.410, Speaker A: I mean, it's night and day, the competitive landscape.
01:30:26.230 - 01:31:01.716, Speaker C: Yeah, I echo both of what you guys said. Market wizards was one of the books I was given to when I was a summer analyst at Morgan Stanley on the trading floor. There's two volumes, actually, both worthwhile reading. It teaches you a lot about the behavioral psychology of fear and greed as a predominant recipe for trading acumen. I think it's super relevant in crypto. It's part of the market structure as it exists today, that those two things are driving a lot of the liquidity gaps and skew and kurtosis all in between. So I think it's a worthwhile read that I would echo and recommending for all of our listeners, for sure.
01:31:01.828 - 01:31:02.480, Speaker B: Nice.
01:31:02.940 - 01:31:19.680, Speaker D: Yeah, and, you know, I would be. For me, it's go to therapy. Seriously, the best investment you can make. You don't have to be sick. Everyone should be going to therapy. It's like, it's always nice to talk to someone that's not a friend, it's not a family member. You just like talk about these things.
01:31:19.680 - 01:31:20.720, Speaker D: It's super helpful.
01:31:20.840 - 01:31:22.312, Speaker A: Yes. Training coach.
01:31:22.376 - 01:31:24.072, Speaker C: I was also going to add whatever.
01:31:24.096 - 01:31:25.060, Speaker D: You want to call it.
01:31:26.440 - 01:31:34.220, Speaker C: I was also going to add have children. I'm sure Dave has not become a better trader with kids because he's up awake all hours of the day, 24/7 for the crypto cycles.
01:31:34.960 - 01:31:36.352, Speaker B: You can trade homework.
01:31:36.536 - 01:31:41.544, Speaker A: We can do a full podcast on sleep trading and sleep. Okay, so. But yes, you know what we should.
01:31:41.592 - 01:31:56.000, Speaker D: Have, by the way, let's have Pranav on because this guy, first time I met him, he's like, get an eight sleep. I'm like, you're that kind of shiller shit. But actually, I've got an eight sleep. This is not endorsement. If they want to sponsor us, great. My sleep quality and hygiene has gone up order magnitude.
01:31:56.080 - 01:31:57.856, Speaker A: It's. I changed my life. It's so important.
01:31:57.928 - 01:32:07.834, Speaker D: Huge. Yeah. Awesome, guys. Really good discussion. Well, good luck trading these markets. It's not easy. Anyone that tells you it's easy is full of shit.
01:32:07.834 - 01:32:09.906, Speaker D: So anyways, great for coming on.
01:32:10.018 - 01:32:10.870, Speaker A: Thanks, Jeff.
01:32:11.370 - 01:32:37.760, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Big thanks for watching today's episode.
