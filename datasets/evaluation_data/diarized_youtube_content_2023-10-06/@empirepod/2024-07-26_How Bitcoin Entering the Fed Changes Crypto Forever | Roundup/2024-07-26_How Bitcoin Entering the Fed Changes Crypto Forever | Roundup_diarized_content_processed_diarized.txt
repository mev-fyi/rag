00:00:00.280 - 00:00:27.526, Speaker A: The most interesting outcome here, which oftentimes tends to happen, is Trump hearing this and trying to get more support from the bitcoin crowd and saying, I like what Lumas said on Friday. And then boom. Now youve got the headlines in every mainstream media publication that Trump supports plan to make bitcoin a global reserve currency asset. And in that outcome, I mean, that's.
00:00:27.678 - 00:00:29.046, Speaker B: You mean it into existence.
00:00:29.118 - 00:00:33.126, Speaker A: That's the, that's the bitcoins at 100k before you know it outcome. So.
00:00:33.278 - 00:00:38.326, Speaker B: But I thought you were gonna say a million, but yeah, I mean, this.

00:02:09.000 - 00:02:18.592, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Doing great. I'm in the land of the free, the home of the brave, and it just feels like a really good week to be in the US.
00:02:18.736 - 00:02:21.220, Speaker A: Nice. Why are you in the US?
00:02:23.170 - 00:02:35.170, Speaker B: You'll see on Friday. But yeah, I'm just here to meet up with a bunch of people. And yeah, I had a pretty good opportunity this Friday too. Something related to the ECTF, let's put it that way.
00:02:35.290 - 00:02:41.106, Speaker A: Nice. The pod will come out Friday at 08:00 a.m. so do you want to give a sneak peek or.
00:02:41.138 - 00:02:47.750, Speaker B: No, no, because it would have to be after four. So if you don't get it by now, then you'll understand.
00:02:48.850 - 00:02:57.310, Speaker A: Yes. Uh, you want to, uh, are we, are we running with that Bloomberg TV in the background? Oh, you want to punch that?
00:02:57.470 - 00:02:58.478, Speaker B: Yeah, let me turn.
00:02:58.534 - 00:03:02.998, Speaker A: You can't give Bloomberg any airtime on a blockworks podcast, Santi. You know that.
00:03:03.094 - 00:03:35.230, Speaker B: I'm sorry. Well, you know, we talk about Bloomberg here a lot, because, you know, actually, um, a quote that people really seem to like, I tweeted about it was like, don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If they're any good, you'll have to shove them down their throat. And, of course, got, like, a lot of hits and likes. Mike, your co founder, really liked it. And he said, yeah, that's certainly true for blockwork. So you think you've talked about, like, at the time you were raising, you were like, people, like, why would you want to build a media company? There's already, Bloomberg's gonna, like, come in, steamroll through this.
00:03:35.230 - 00:03:39.686, Speaker B: And, of course, they haven't. Yeah, I turned it off. So thank you.
00:03:39.718 - 00:03:45.650, Speaker A: Thank you. No, we like Bloomberg. We like Bloomberg. I like Bloomberg. Well, you're looking very dapper. Nice haircut.
00:03:46.650 - 00:03:52.346, Speaker B: I got a haircut. And the guy said, you look younger. I'm like, you know, you're old. When people start commenting that you start looking younger.
00:03:52.378 - 00:03:53.906, Speaker A: You do look younger. You do look young.
00:03:53.978 - 00:04:00.230, Speaker B: God damn it. Maybe I should shave my beard and see what, shave more years.
00:04:02.050 - 00:04:02.986, Speaker A: So what's crypto is taking.
00:04:03.018 - 00:04:08.074, Speaker B: A, crypto is taking a toll on my physique, bro.
00:04:08.122 - 00:04:22.270, Speaker A: If it's taking a toll on your physique, what does that make me? I'm hurting over here. I was like, I'm gonna get nice. And, Tanya, I'm out of the city for the month. It appears that has not happened. What else? Any, any interesting meetings in New York?
00:04:22.390 - 00:05:03.400, Speaker B: Yeah, so I had the, I was invited to a dinner by Vanek guys. So Pranav, we'll actually have to have him on the pod. So there was a small group, someone from Solana was there, someone from large canadian pension fund that is investing in crypto? Is there Jean Baneck, which is, you know, the son of the founder of AneC. It's pretty amazing story, actually. They really kind of grew a lot with ETF's, and then they have, of course, the hodl Etf, which is a bitcoin ETF, and the ethereum ETF. So it was in the day that the ETH ETF launch, which is going to be something that we're going to talk about during the pod. And they were, I think they received like 45 million in inflows the first day.
00:05:03.400 - 00:05:24.388, Speaker B: So it was a really good conversation. And then there was Pranav, which runs his hedge fund strategy. And he's very smart, someone that I talk to on the daily almost. And this other guy called Anthony Borges. He's like an entrepreneur. He's a professor at USC. Really interesting background.
00:05:24.388 - 00:05:48.696, Speaker B: And it's awesome to see very successful entrepreneurs that are also looking to invest in crypto. He's actually a gaming founder. He's sat like all his life. He's just been early in games. He's developed games. So we had a really good conversation around why he likes Crypto and why he thinks that crypto is good for games, particularly at a time where most people are fading games. Right.
00:05:48.696 - 00:05:57.768, Speaker B: Because of, you know, the tokens themselves haven't performed as well, per se. So he would also be someone that would be great for the podcast, I think.
00:05:57.904 - 00:06:10.600, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, that's great, man. Good trip. Excited to see the announcement. That's cool. Yeah, we launched pickleball tournament at permissionless. That was our week.
00:06:10.600 - 00:06:26.220, Speaker A: So we're hard at work over here at blockworks. What are you doing to move this industry forward, huh? Yeah, we are out here launching pickleball tournaments. So go. We'll put a link in the, in the show notes. You can fill out a form. Go. Yeah, go get that.
00:06:26.220 - 00:06:27.944, Speaker A: All right.
00:06:28.112 - 00:06:32.540, Speaker B: Should we talk about. I mean, there's a couple of things we want to talk about, I think markets.
00:06:33.830 - 00:06:42.046, Speaker A: Yeah, why don't we just talk about. I mean, it's pretty chaotic week in the markets. I'd love to hear how you're thinking about that. Yeah. Why don't we start there?
00:06:42.238 - 00:06:43.494, Speaker B: Well, you were going to ask.
00:06:43.622 - 00:06:52.110, Speaker A: I was going to ask. Are you comfortable talking about the public market buys that you made and how you structured those? Sure.
00:06:52.150 - 00:07:19.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I can do that. Well, maybe just to level set the conversation. If you've been hiding under a rock. The equity markets just shed 1.1 trillion yesterday. This is like the Nasdaq, the S and P, which is just a casual 40% of all crypto market cap just poof. And there were some pretty big swings, like Tesla was down 11%, Coinbase was down 5%.
00:07:19.760 - 00:07:47.570, Speaker B: Crowdstrike continues to be beaten down because obviously the outage, the bug. So, yeah. Anyways, there's been a big rotation out of tech over the last week or so or two. And actually more than that. Joe McCann, actually, we've had him on the pod, he has good news that he tracks as well. And yeah, there's some interesting stuff going on the equity markets. And then of course, people are still projecting rate cuts as early as September.
00:07:47.570 - 00:08:37.440, Speaker B: But I think the market, my read is that tech has had a very big out performance relative to the rest of the market. And then just there's a rotation into other stuff like value and the Russell and small cap stuff. I don't necessarily read much into it, I'm not an expert on it, but it's just interesting. I do pay attention. Transition more into your question. When something that I like goes down like 11%, then I think it's, it's those moments where I think as an investor, as a trader, you really get out of bed to do some stuff. And so I, yeah, last, yesterday I bought some, a structured product that it's kind of like we're Tesla and coin, sort of the worst off and with a pretty big buffer.
00:08:37.440 - 00:09:03.006, Speaker B: And so this is like, this is part of my non crypto portfolio. Of course, I guess I have Coinbase and uh, my private banker keeps reminding me that I don't need more crypto concentration in my portfolio. But I don't know, I just feel that, uh, these are names that I like and it's a short list of, of things that I, that I track. And so, yeah, I don't know if you want me to go more.
00:09:03.198 - 00:09:05.550, Speaker A: So you bought Tesla and Coin, but you didn't just buy the stock?
00:09:05.630 - 00:09:47.160, Speaker B: I didn't buy the stock. These are like, uh, they're called, in the US Phoenix nodes outside the USA, they're, they're also called reverse autocall converts. I think I've talked about this structure in the pod before. Basically, I'm betting that you can choose your barrier. Meaning like, I'm betting that both Coinbase and Tesla don't go down more than like 30% or 35%. If they do go below that, then I just, after a year observation, then I basically buy the stock at that level, down 35. So the risk, of course, is if the stock goes down more than 35%, I start losing after that point.
00:09:47.160 - 00:10:39.444, Speaker B: But it is compensated by the fact that during this period, if the stock kind of stays within this range, like below the current price, where I bought the close yesterday, and down 35%, if it stays within that range, then I get paid a pretty compelling coupon. In this case, it was like 46% annual coupon. So for me, it's a way to like, have equity, like exposure to names that I like and feel comfortable holding long term because worst case for me, you know, I end up buying the stock, and it's two names that I feel comfortable holding in my portfolio long term. And in the meantime, I get paid a pretty substantial coupon that behaves more like equity. Right. Because, you know, the stock market, S and P, NAsdAQ historically go up 15%.
00:10:39.532 - 00:10:39.900, Speaker A: What?
00:10:39.980 - 00:11:05.348, Speaker B: Give or take. Now, these names have a lot of volatility. TesLA, I think, historically has had, like, a 60% volume. So there's a very big chance that it might dip below 35. But I get paid a pretty substantial coupon that I can then use to, you know, basically, there's a point by which, like, I start losing. But for me, it's a good way. Like, I prioritize cash flow.
00:11:05.348 - 00:11:24.950, Speaker B: I've talked here and tweeted about, like, for me, it's important to have diversified sources of cash flow, and this is, like, a good way to earn a coupon. Right. The way I generally think about it is, like, if you're earning that type of coupon, then you can reinvest it into much higher risk stuff or keep it as a buffer to fund your lifestyle, do other stuff. Right.
00:11:25.770 - 00:11:27.630, Speaker A: What's the reason for buying Tesla?
00:11:29.410 - 00:11:54.236, Speaker B: Well, actually, a good conversation with Pranav. He's been like, he's an Uber Tesla bull. Him and Kathy, I think, like, the art guys. Like, I think the market and Elon kind of tweeted about this or the earnings call. I think earnings came out yesterday. And Elon was, look, you either believe that we're solving, like, the self driving. Like, self driving has come a very long way.
00:11:54.236 - 00:12:08.588, Speaker B: And I first experienced, like, self driving in Palo Alto. Actually, I drove from Silicon Valley to San Francisco, like, four years ago. My buddy had, like, a model three, I think, or X or whatever. And he even touched the wheel. It was like a surreal experience. I'm like, you're not going to touch it. He's like, no.
00:12:08.588 - 00:12:40.338, Speaker B: And we just had a normal conversation in the hour commute. It was incredible. And it's come such a long way. And I think, basically the argument that Ark and someone like Pranav makes is that it's not priced in and the benefits of autonomous driving are massive. And I think that's sort of like a long tail call option on that anyways. But for me, I don't know. I pay attention when something's down a lot.
00:12:40.338 - 00:12:49.102, Speaker B: I don't know, there's something about feeling like you're getting stuff at a discount, but it might be one of those where it's like, you're buying something that is already super overpriced, right?
00:12:49.166 - 00:12:51.910, Speaker A: No, I like it. I like it. Yeah. I have a test.
00:12:51.950 - 00:12:56.810, Speaker B: Do you dabble? You don't talk about it, but you dabble in the stock market, I guess.
00:12:58.230 - 00:13:08.490, Speaker A: No, I don't. I have zero. I sold most of about a year and a half ago. I sold most of my equities and moved into coin.
00:13:09.250 - 00:13:15.130, Speaker B: I remember this. When you said this, and your private bet, your banker was like, you're making a terrible mistake.
00:13:15.290 - 00:13:25.030, Speaker A: Yeah. I was like, I want to buy some stocks. He's like, oh, my God. You never buy stock. I was like, I want to buy Coinbase. He's like, you idiot.
00:13:26.930 - 00:13:39.540, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know, man. I am of the mind that if, like, concentration doesn't scare me, because I still, like, I don't know.
00:13:39.700 - 00:14:16.700, Speaker A: For me, it's, um, like, I don't have any fear over the volatility. So, like, when things go down 80%, it doesn't spook me. But for other people, for, like, for example, my wife, like, really does not like things drawing down 80%. So, like, the emotional toil of that is not worth the potential upside. So I think you just, you have to optimize for, like, the money that you could be making and the return, but also the emotional side of it. It's the same reason I don't trade is because I just want to put my mental bandwidth into blockworks. I think you have to optimize for more things than just the return.
00:14:16.700 - 00:14:38.160, Speaker A: Let's talk Etf's. I'm curious if the Vanak guys had any interesting insights, but I think my takeaway is these things massively outperformed. To run through some of the numbers here. And I'll. I should have put this together before the episode. Maybe I can just share my screen and show you guys some tweets from Eric and James and the bitwise folks. Let's see.
00:14:38.160 - 00:15:12.824, Speaker A: I'll pull this up. This is from Eric, the new eight. So for people who have not been paying too close of attention, the ETH ETF's I'll list it are the grayscale Ethereum, which is ETH, which a lot of people are talking about. That's grayscale. Then ishares, which is Blackrock fidelity, bitwise, Grayscale's minitrust, vanek Franklin, Invesco, the Invesco Galaxy, ETF, and then 21 shares core. So very similar list. There was a Juan Lee from bitwise.
00:15:12.824 - 00:15:51.514, Speaker A: Put out a nice comparison of the bitcoin versus eth day one comparison. So total ETH flows were 108 million. That's 16% of the bitcoin flows, but actually 79% if you exclude the outflows from ETH. So what people might be talking about in week one is the massive outflows from Grayscale's ETH, and then I think the outperformance of inflows into the other ones. So things like bitwise brought in a lot more than people expected. Things like the grayscale. You know, grayscale's ETH had some pretty big outflows.
00:15:51.514 - 00:16:18.536, Speaker A: So I would say there's pretty big outperformance on day one. What people always look at is, okay, well, there's the day one hype. What about day two? And day two had, I think, even bigger performance than day one, or just. Just about as big of performances as day one. So bring in, I think there's over a billion and either 900, 950, a billion in volume in day two as well. So pretty massive start to the Ethereum ETF's.
00:16:18.688 - 00:17:00.230, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty crazy, the volume that it's gotten. I don't know what to read into that. My interpretation is I've always felt that, like, the ETHF is like, the first time, maybe the wall street understands that this is like a tech bet. Like, buying the e TTF is like a. My suspicion is it's like it will open Wall Street's eyes to, hey, this is a pure, pure play tech bet. Whereas bitcoin is something different. I think I may be wrong, but I just feel that, like, it might be the first time where Wall street says, hey, I'm gonna allocate this as part of, like, my tech bucket.
00:17:00.850 - 00:17:16.848, Speaker A: That's what I think, too. I want first and foremost, I think the Ethereum ETF was so big because it's a. It's the. It's the one of the biggest regulatory clarity steps we've had. Right. ETH is not a security. If there's an ethereum ETF Eth is not a security.
00:17:16.848 - 00:17:40.600, Speaker A: The SEC finally made it official, so that's just like a big stamp of approval that opens things up. And I think you have to call that out. But, yeah, I think you're right. This week was when Ethereum kind of crossed the chasm into the investment mainstream. And I think they're two totally different investment theses. Bitcoin is like a hedge against chaos. You heard Larry Fink talking.
00:17:40.600 - 00:18:10.512, Speaker A: We talked about this last week. I read that quote. It's kind of like, if you're depressed about something in the world, or you're scared about something in the world. The best way to get exposure to that is by going short. Now, the best way to get exposure is by going long. Bitcoin eth, I think, is just the tech platform that could foster the growth of crypto. It's kind of like, I don't know, we had a call with a very large institution early this week and he said, look, I have no idea what's.
00:18:10.512 - 00:18:46.426, Speaker A: I don't understand defi, I don't understand NFTs or the metaverse or Daos or any of these things. But what I do understand is that when the Internet grew, it grew on top of these cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud and Azure. And if you just bought those cloud providers, you would have had exposure to all the websites that got built on top. And he's like, I'm buying Ethereum because I don't know about nfts or gaming or stable coins or any of that stuff. I just want exposure to the underlying growth of this like, digital economy. And I think that really sums up the instrument.
00:18:46.498 - 00:19:16.904, Speaker B: It's also an easy narrative to understand. It's also like an easy narrative to get behind, right? It's like this. As Chris Dixon talks about in his book, read, write, own. And like, you know, analysts reports have started to like, appreciate Ethereum. I mean, even as far back as the last cycle, JP Morgan was putting out a note that saying, like, ethereum is far more interesting than bitcoin. It was like, it's like a tech kind of bet and it's like the next evolution of the Internet. And like that was before, I mean, that was over four years ago.
00:19:16.904 - 00:20:00.078, Speaker B: I remember I picked this report up, this JP Morgan analyst talk was talking about Ethereum, and they appreciated kind of the tech element of it. And what is it really exciting now is that ETH is it sort of now forces research analysts to start writing about Ethereum. And that is, I think, going to be really interesting to observe even how they think about valuing something like Ethereum on a cash flow basis based on fees. Mev, because again, valuing bitcoin is a commodity. It's very different. It's a supply and demand. But ethereum is very much could be valued on cash flows.
00:20:00.078 - 00:20:15.450, Speaker B: And I'm actually quite excited to see how the different analysts cover Ethereum and start recommending or not the exposure to the ETF.
00:20:17.530 - 00:20:18.590, Speaker A: 100%.
00:20:19.410 - 00:20:58.036, Speaker B: It's also, you might confirm or deny this, but I think even it's also this, when we think about the flows like, it's. I didn't talk to Vanek guys in terms of, like, how they saw the type of buyer for the ETF, but I would assume it's similar to bitcoin, which is, it's still mostly self directed accounts, nothing. Institutional accounts, not private banks of the world, which is my understanding, is a lot of large financial institutions, private banks can't recommend this to clients or won't, unless the client specifically calls and says, hey, I want you to buy me this.
00:20:58.188 - 00:21:34.510, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. So at the Coinbase summit, the head of, I think it was head of ETF products or head of chief investment officer or whatever, from Blackrock and Cathie Wood both said the same thing, which is about 80% of the buying for the bitcoin. ETF is coming from self directed individuals, and it's not even really the institutions right now. Institutions make up about 20% of the buying. Another takeaway from the ETH, ETF, seeing this, which is bit wise, just continues to massively outperform. It's very remarkable. I was looking at some of the data.
00:21:34.510 - 00:21:54.070, Speaker A: I mean, they were beating out fidelity. Like, they're beating out Fidelity in the first 90 minutes. They're beating out Fidelity in the first day. They just had massive volume. It was grayscale, obviously, because Grayscale's had their product in the market for a long time, then Blackrock, then bitwise. So Fidelity's beating out. Excuse me.
00:21:54.070 - 00:22:20.272, Speaker A: Yeah, bitwise is beating out Fidelity. Vanek Franklin, Templeton, Invesco. And I think that just, you gotta, you gotta stop and just respect it for a second and think about how much work they've put in. But also, like, yeah, it's kind of a new era of, like, these crypto native companies coming to Wall street. You would, you would think that fidelity, way more distribution. Fidelity's been in the bitcoin game for a long time, too. Right? They've been -20 15.
00:22:20.272 - 00:22:22.424, Speaker A: So that's very true.
00:22:22.592 - 00:22:39.040, Speaker B: It's just really important to understand also that what is really cool about bitwise is that they've publicly committed to allocating 10% of the revenue, I believe, or the fees that they generate from the ETF to fund open source development of Ethereum.
00:22:40.020 - 00:22:41.356, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't realize that. That's cool.
00:22:41.388 - 00:23:23.014, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I gotta ask and wonder, like, why, I mean, when you, the fees for these products are very different, but what's, like, the end game for, like, grayscale? Like, can, can you explain with your right, like, what it's, like, self sabotage? Like, why their fees are, like, they haven't changed their fees where it's like, they're like, five or ten times more than normally. Like, etfes are, like, anywhere from, like, 25 basis points to 75 basis points, maybe 1%. But, like, grayscale is like two and a half. It's a crazy or two.
00:23:23.062 - 00:23:38.770, Speaker A: I really don't understand the game. And they're like, just. I thought that was a. I originally thought that was like, son and shines play and then it didn't work out, and then son and shine got the boot and then they put in place someone new, but then they just continue running with this strategy. So I really don't get it.
00:23:38.850 - 00:23:41.970, Speaker B: Just feels. Yeah, feels like self sabotage.
00:23:42.010 - 00:23:49.790, Speaker A: I think Barry's just trying to just milk the cow. Maybe Barry's trying to hang up the cleats and just.
00:23:52.370 - 00:23:59.356, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very, very strange. There's a lot going in. Go ahead.
00:23:59.508 - 00:24:17.132, Speaker A: What about. I mean, Coinbase. I know we're both talking about how we own Coinbase and we're both biased, but they are the custodian on eight of the nine eth. ETF's here. On one hand, I'm like, wow, that's awesome. Because. Go Coinbase.
00:24:17.132 - 00:24:22.460, Speaker A: Congrats to them. On the other hand, I'm like, that feels like some concentration. Risk that.
00:24:22.540 - 00:24:25.878, Speaker B: Lord o mercy, please have your set up.
00:24:26.014 - 00:24:38.254, Speaker A: I don't love to see, honestly. So I don't. And I don't actually know what people are doing. Like, I don't know if there's a three party custodian. Like, hopefully these guys have set up, like, two or three party custodian systems, but.
00:24:38.422 - 00:25:06.230, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. When I think of this is, you need insurance. I'm sure they have some insurance policy in place, but maybe not. But I'm actually. This is a company that I'm investing in that I'm quite excited about. They are the farthest along that I've observed. And, like, regulated insurance, like, doing it the right way, and it's by a large, large financial institution.
00:25:06.230 - 00:25:12.710, Speaker B: So I'm. Again, these things, like, get solved with proper insurance and risk management solutions.
00:25:14.130 - 00:25:35.470, Speaker A: So, final numbers. I think from day two, it was. I think on day two, the bitcoin ETF's traded 1.5 billion and the ETH ETF's traded 1 billion. So if you ask me. If you asked me going into this week, I would have said ETH probably would have traded about 20% of bitcoin. And we're looking at, yeah, about 60, 70%.
00:25:35.470 - 00:25:38.870, Speaker A: So, yeah, I would call that a big success.
00:25:39.290 - 00:26:07.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I would really like to bring on someone that can. Maybe it's vanit guys, or maybe it's Eric from Bloomberg to just, where are these flows coming from? Is it, like, even, like, hey, is there rotation away from the bitcoin ETF into the ETH ETF? Or is it new capital? Is it mostly still self directed accounts? What's the average ticket size? What's the holdings? Like? All these kind of things, I think is going to be really interesting to observe over time. Right?
00:26:07.890 - 00:26:13.810, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. All right, we were talking about the Germany selling. Well, what's bitcoin doing today?
00:26:15.590 - 00:26:17.490, Speaker B: Market's a little down. Right?
00:26:19.070 - 00:26:36.850, Speaker A: So, I mean, after. Yeah, it's at 64. So it's interesting. There's this price action that Alex Krueger called out. So Wednesday, the markets got clobbered. The queues were down three and a half percent. Bitcoin was down 2.2%,
00:26:36.850 - 00:27:10.760, Speaker A: ETH was down 7.5%, and Sol was up 1.5%. So what do you make of some of this? Like, there's not only divergence in equities to crypto, so some days equities will be down now and crypto will be up, and the inverse is true. But now you're starting to see, like, bitcoin's down two, eth down seven, Seoul's up one. Is this people trying to front run? I mean, it's like ETF week. Is this people starting to try to front run a Solana ETF? What do you make of that?
00:27:12.020 - 00:27:57.352, Speaker B: I mean, I'll tell you what my long term thinking is, and I is that you're just seeing soul converge on Eth. And I think it's rotation internally in crypto, where I think more people start to realize that I wouldn't want to read too much into a day's performance or underperformance, because it's just noise, I think. But on a. I think if you were to trace even back to our predictions in December or earlier this year, I was talking to you. I mean, I was talking about. I just don't think that sol. Exactly.
00:27:57.352 - 00:28:24.416, Speaker B: This is a really good one. And then Kyle also kind of went something to the effect of, like, you know, they were of the mind that Solana was going to flip Ethereum across a number of metrics. I also shared that view earlier this year, back in December, and that was, like, where my thesis is predicated on, which is you're already seeing Solana surpass Ethereum across a variety of metrics, except price, market cap.
00:28:24.568 - 00:28:52.566, Speaker A: Yeah. So for those who aren't watching on YouTube. There's a really interesting chart that Ryan Connor, who's a research analyst at Blockwork, shared July 1. So about three and a half weeks ago, he said the next meaningful flippening in crypto is likely. Dex volume market share will probably take a few months. And it showed this chart of the ETH, Dex market share collapsing and the Solana market share going up. Um, and it took, yeah, it took.
00:28:52.566 - 00:29:12.942, Speaker A: Took three weeks. He said it'll probably take a few months. It actually ended up taking a few weeks, he said. The most interesting and consequential milestone in crypto markets today, Solana has surpassed Ethereum and trailing 30 day Dex volume for the first time ever. It is now the most used chain by that measure. And if you can actually look at some of these charts. So you can look at the 30 day Dex volume.
00:29:12.942 - 00:29:38.372, Speaker A: Solana just passed ETH for the first time ever, 30 day Dex volume. Ethan Sol, you can look at that here. These are just different ways of showing it in percentage or the amount, the volume, volume, market share and top chains by market share. So you've got Solana and ETH. Actually, this is a really interesting chart right here. So top chains by market share, 30 day Dex volume. Solana is at 29.5%.
00:29:38.372 - 00:29:58.902, Speaker A: ETH is at 29.3%. Arbitrum is third at 12.8%. BNB at 10%. Base base up to 8%. So base is now top five index volumes. And then there's a big drop off. It goes blast at one and a half, op at one and a half, avax at one, matic at one, sui at one.
00:29:58.902 - 00:30:01.822, Speaker A: So very interesting data from Ryan.
00:30:01.886 - 00:30:30.950, Speaker B: There was some pushback on this post, which I think was phenomenal. Kudos to Ryan and the research team that should you be counting the l two s, right. Arbitrum and, you know, blast and base. And there are some pretty. I actually don't think that you should be counting it or because, I mean, the fees that are being posted back to the l one are, like, not very substantial.
00:30:32.210 - 00:30:48.010, Speaker A: Oh, I definitely don't. I definitely don't think that you should. Because, I mean, you're going to start seeing these l two s break off into their own chains, I think, soon. So you saw what blast was doing. I think you will probably see more and more of that. What should most of the.
00:30:48.170 - 00:31:26.400, Speaker B: Because if you go back to the episode we recorded with Kyle, which I shared, this view is most of the. When you think about how to value an l one, I think most of the cash flow is coming from Mev capture, and nothing. And so a lot of the mev is captured at the l two and is not shared back to the l one. So the posting data is back to the l one, and the settlement is sort of, like, inconsequential and small over time and more so over time. So most of the value capture is going to happen at the l two. So I almost think of them as, like, for that reason, I don't think you count it in this analysis.
00:31:26.570 - 00:31:47.720, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, what maybe should be counted here is there's all these. So op has got the op stack, arbitrum, got arbitram, stylus. They're starting to be these l three s or other l two s built on it. So, like, optimism has base zora mode, and these are all other chains like that data should probably be put back into the.
00:31:48.620 - 00:32:33.350, Speaker B: And I think we talked about this in the episode with Stephen from Arbitrum. It's just, yeah, I think maybe you factor in all the fees, the actual fees that are flowing back to the l one or the l two from the l three or whatever. But nonetheless, I mean, I think the. I don't think you should be get too caught up in the nuance. I think the point stands, which is think about the criticisms around, oh, Solana is just a meme coin chain. I'm like, I hear you. A lot of the activities like bid meme coins, but there's also a fair amount of healthy projects like helios and other deep end projects you've had.
00:32:33.350 - 00:33:19.670, Speaker B: What is it? Pump fun, which is, I guess, meme coin activity. But what I'm trying to say is, I think meme coins, and the fact that meme coins have thrived largely in Solana, is telling you that this is the most retail friendly chain and other breakout apps, while social has worked outside, you have fantasy on blast and frantic and what have you. I just think that the fact that meme coins have mostly thrived in Solana to a greater extent than any other chain, it just tells you where most of the activity is going to continue to happen, and that's the most important thing in my mind.
00:33:21.290 - 00:33:57.724, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of Crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on the show, so I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the universal intent machine. Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexs on each chain. Disaster, right? But here's the good news.
00:33:57.724 - 00:34:48.060, Speaker C: Thanks to intents, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Anoma's solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background. We're excited to see what cool dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with anoma, you can follow them@x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net dot special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode hey everyone, I wanted to take a second to talk about Real a permissionless l two for tokenized real world assets on arbitrum orbit. What's really cool about Real is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAs as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first l two, where 100% of profits from transaction fees and fees from protocols accrue back to the L two's governance token.
00:34:48.060 - 00:35:44.608, Speaker C: RWA Real has just launched their rewards program, where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow and leverage tokenized real world assets, including t bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades. Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at us persons. Find out more at Re al rewards.

00:36:55.020 - 00:36:58.260, Speaker A: Did you see Chamath talking about bittencertaine?
00:36:58.750 - 00:36:59.530, Speaker B: Yes.
00:37:00.110 - 00:37:04.894, Speaker A: So I'll play this. Tell me if you, tell me if you can hear this. Can you hear that?
00:37:04.982 - 00:37:05.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:43.480 - 00:38:04.756, Speaker A: Okay, so Chamath got a lot of shit because he's like, you know, people were like, oh, he's just dumping on retail. I. I'm going to take the other side of this, actually. I think that this is what we talked about at the beginning of the year. This was one of my predictions, which is that everyone wants allocation to AI. The best way to do that is via Nvidia. Nvidia.
00:38:04.756 - 00:38:11.036, Speaker A: I still don't know how to pronounce it. Price looks too high. Is it Nvidia or Nvidia?
00:38:11.228 - 00:38:12.060, Speaker B: Nvidia.
00:38:12.180 - 00:38:35.956, Speaker A: Nvidia. Okay, thank you. Price looks too high. The chart looks ridiculous. They're like, oh, what other AI things do I buy? And then it's like, Microsoft and Facebook, they're like, well, I don't want, like, that feels so, like mid curve. Okay, let me try to get more cute with this. And then they, there's no other things they can buy except for these, like, super risky tech deals in Silicon Valley that they maybe don't have access to.
00:38:35.956 - 00:38:46.572, Speaker A: So they start looking at Akash and render and bitten, sir, and things like that. And I actually, I mean, that was one of the predictions for the year. I think it's starting to come true. And so, like, I mean, these things trade out.
00:38:46.596 - 00:38:54.284, Speaker B: I mean, bitten, what? Trading at 8 billion, fully diluted up to ten. I think it might be down to six or something, but it's not got.
00:38:54.292 - 00:38:56.920, Speaker A: A nice little, like 10% chmoth pump, so.
00:38:58.340 - 00:39:23.826, Speaker B: Yeah, well, people should be cautious, right. But yeah, there's. AI is a sector that I've allocated to not, I don't know, any liquid tokens, but I've invested in exo Labs, which, by the way, fascinating stuff. It's running your nodes on. You're running like, models on your computers. Like people should go follow Mohammed or some of the exo guys. Like, they're run.
00:39:23.826 - 00:39:36.938, Speaker B: Basically, the idea is to run your models at the edge. Right. Computing. So with one your MacBook or two MacBooks, you have really good performance. Run like llama. Really cool stuff. Like guys from Oxford.
00:39:36.938 - 00:40:07.342, Speaker B: Very smart. They're really doing some really cool stuff. So that's Exo Labs. I've invested in Renzo, I've invested in my shell, and hyperbolic. I think those are maybe one or two I'm missing, but those are. And they're all doing really interesting stuff. But I actually want to do a part two AI episode, bring back Casey, who's someone that I lean on a lot.
00:40:07.342 - 00:40:21.358, Speaker B: She's launching her fun topology, which is very much focused on AI, and then bring on another founder, because last time we had. Oh, Danny from Modulus. Right. But we. Yeah, I think we're due for an update on the AI stuff.
00:40:21.494 - 00:40:30.398, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I like it. You see the Senator Lummis bitcoin reserve plan.
00:40:30.494 - 00:40:32.290, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:40:32.670 - 00:41:01.312, Speaker A: All right, so I can talk about this. So there was rumors starting about last week that Trump was going to announce something at the Bitcoin conference. I think he's speaking on Saturday. And then Lummis is speaking today, on Friday, or we're recording this Thursday. She's speaking on Friday, which is when you'll be listening to this. And so there are rumors starting about last week that Trump was going to announce that bitcoin was going to be a reserve asset for the US. Seemed kind of crazy, but you never really know with Trump.
00:41:01.312 - 00:42:03.306, Speaker A: And then Senator Lummis came out and announced, or I don't actually know if she announced. I think Fox, Fox reported and they kind of scooped it, that on Friday she's going to share something on stage at the Bitcoin conference with Tulsi Gabbard that they are going to craft new legislation that could try to establish bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset by requiring the Federal Reserve to hold bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. So I don't think this will get passed because Lummis is, like one of the most far right people in the Senate that you can possibly get out of Wyoming. And, like, a lot of her stuff doesn't really get passed. This is a little more for show. But I do think it's interesting because she's speaking on Friday and then Trump is speaking on Saturday. And the most interesting outcome here, which oftentimes tends to happen, is Trump hearing this and trying to get more support from the bitcoin crowd.
00:42:03.306 - 00:42:21.762, Speaker A: And saying, I like what Luma said on Friday, or someone asked him the question. Now you've got the headlines in every mainstream media publication that Trump supports plan to make bitcoin a global reserve currency asset. And like, in that outcome, I mean, that's.
00:42:21.906 - 00:42:23.266, Speaker B: You mean it into existence.
00:42:23.338 - 00:42:27.322, Speaker A: That's the, that's the bitcoins at 100k before you know it outcome. So.
00:42:27.466 - 00:42:29.010, Speaker B: But I thought you were gonna say a million.
00:42:29.090 - 00:42:33.710, Speaker A: But yeah, I mean, sure, calm down.
00:42:35.010 - 00:42:36.274, Speaker B: Old actor enthusiast.
00:42:36.322 - 00:42:44.870, Speaker A: That's the, that's the Cathie Woods 1.5. But it is like, it is aligned with what Mark Cuban said a couple weeks ago.
00:42:46.550 - 00:43:10.518, Speaker B: Someone mentioned this because right after the episode we recorded last week, I tweeted about, like, in what version would this make sense? And the risks potentially around announcing this. You're kind of tipping your hand that you're concerned about the dollar. But I think someone mentioned, I mean, the us government already holds, like, what is it, a couple thousand bitcoin? I mean, it's quite a lot.
00:43:10.534 - 00:43:12.062, Speaker A: Yeah. Just that they've confiscated.
00:43:12.246 - 00:43:36.790, Speaker B: No, they own much more than that. They own, like, they're the largest holder of bitcoin. I believe it's, I forget the exact figure. Non trivial, not in the grand scheme of their reserve basket. Yes. But I think it's like one, one to one and a half percent of all bitcoin in circulation they own. So anyways, someone had mentioned.
00:43:36.790 - 00:44:40.454, Speaker B: So that's held, I think, in the Department of Justice or whatever, and so they could transfer that amount into the strategic reserve as a starting point, at least. And someone was mentioning that, just that, doing that alone. I think there was a clip on CNBC that was talking about this. I forget who exactly mentioned this, but I think it's pretty interesting observation, which is just the transfer of it alone, I think, would give markets a lot of confidence in that they're not going to sell it it and they're going to hold it, unlike Germany. And that would be, that act alone would be pretty meaningful for the market in terms of their intent of what to do with that bitcoin, because they could, if they wanted to, just sell it at any point, like Germany. But if you're holding it in the treasury, right. In the Department of Treasury, like in the balance sheet, then I think at least it would signal to the market their intent to hold it on a long term basis.
00:44:40.582 - 00:44:47.290, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Celkis resigned from a. Sorry. This week.
00:44:47.950 - 00:44:50.890, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. Do you know what he's going to do next?
00:44:51.790 - 00:44:55.702, Speaker A: I do, I do. But I cannot.
00:44:55.886 - 00:44:58.170, Speaker B: Is it politics related.
00:45:00.710 - 00:45:02.530, Speaker A: I don't think I should blink twice.
00:45:05.470 - 00:45:09.090, Speaker B: Ladies and gentlemen. He's blinking three times. I don't know what to make of this.
00:45:10.270 - 00:45:13.454, Speaker A: He's doing what he should be doing. That's what I think.
00:45:13.622 - 00:45:16.142, Speaker B: Sounds like it's found his true calling, I guess.
00:45:16.246 - 00:45:16.890, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:18.270 - 00:45:23.130, Speaker B: Good for him. Well, you know who's taking over Masari, by the way?
00:45:23.430 - 00:45:47.510, Speaker A: Eric is. Eric Turner. So, like, there are two. So Celcus has a co founder, Dan, I think his name is, but he kind of took a step back a couple of years ago, and then there were two early hires, Ben O'Neill and Eric Turner. Ben left a couple of years ago, went to different places, cast labs and some, some other places. Eric has stayed around. I think Eric's either the chief revenue officer or the COO today.
00:45:47.510 - 00:46:02.336, Speaker A: And he's great. Eric is awesome. I really, really like him. Good operator, good. Just like I level headed guy and has done great work at Mossari. And so he's taking it over as the interim CEO, and then I think they're going to try to find another CEO. It sounds like.
00:46:02.448 - 00:46:03.160, Speaker B: That's great.
00:46:03.280 - 00:46:09.300, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I don't know. Kamala's not speaking at the bitcoin conference. There were some rumors that she was going to and that she's not.
00:46:09.680 - 00:46:58.300, Speaker B: Actually, I would like to pick your brain here and the political expert that you are. What do you make of this? Like, I was listening to two different, like, banks organized calls around this election update this week, and both of them were like, the election is going to be very close. Like, and then actually, Pranav was the one that brought it to my attention. Like, the last election in the key swing states, it was won by a margin of less than 100,000 votes. And my question to you is, do you think that they're like, do you think it's actually accurate that this would be a close election? And if so, how meaningful will a crypto voter, single issue voter, be to potentially determine the outcome in these key swinging states?
00:47:00.120 - 00:47:39.562, Speaker A: I think it will. With Biden. When Biden was running, I don't think it would have been close. I think Trump would have had a historic sweep on the level of Dwight Eisenhower or Reagan second term or Nixon. One of these 20 point, they win by 20 points or something like that. Now that Kamala is running, even though I think crypto people don't want to hear this, my take is that it's going to be much closer than people actually think. She had absolute record, blew past every record for fundraising in a 24 or 48 hours.
00:47:39.562 - 00:48:00.754, Speaker A: Period. Um, and really, it comes down to, like, 43% of people in this country were already going to vote Democrat no matter what. It's like 43% of people were going to vote democratic. No, no, Matt, no matter who was up there. And so it basically just comes down to the other. To the, to the. Yeah, the swing states, which is what? Arizona.
00:48:00.754 - 00:48:13.180, Speaker A: Uh, I won't try to do this. Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, Ohio. Yeah, yeah, there's. So there's six, there's six swing states, basically. And so, yeah, I think you said, pranav said this. It really does come down to, like, 100,000 voters.
00:48:13.180 - 00:48:36.798, Speaker A: I think what these people don't understand is that crypto is a much more powerful group of people than they understand today. And I think the Republicans in Trump understand that. Right. There's 50 or 60 or whatever number million Americans hold. Hold crypto. Let's say it's so. Let's say it's 50 million.
00:48:36.798 - 00:48:52.150, Speaker A: Right. If you want to try to do, like, a consulting type project, 50 million. So that's probably. So that's. I would guess there's one to 2 million of those. Let's say there's. Let's say there's five of the 50 million are in swing states.
00:48:52.150 - 00:49:23.998, Speaker A: So that's 5 million in swing states. And then let's say 10% of the population is, is, is independent. Maybe 10% is, is, like, undecided right now. So that's of the 5 million in swing state. Who's on then you're backing into, like, 500,000 undecided people in swing states where crypt, they care about crypto a lot. And that's, I think, why you're seeing Trump, like, lean so heavily into this. If I were Kamala and, like, I got that dog in me trying to win this election, like, I'm, I'm doing everything I can get to.
00:49:23.998 - 00:49:37.820, Speaker A: Like, she's got to get Novogratz, Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci just shilling the hell out of her to the crypto crowd. And I would be trying to appeal to them. Right. So that's what I would be doing.
00:49:38.280 - 00:49:50.500, Speaker B: I mean, I guess you can avert and say, is being very pro crypto and being vocal about it going to hurt you in capturing those undecided voters that are going to matter an election day?
00:49:50.880 - 00:49:53.728, Speaker A: I don't think it'll hurt. I think it only benefits you.
00:49:53.904 - 00:50:10.696, Speaker B: I think so. I think that's the calculus that the team, the Trump, the campaign team has actually made. And it's like, it's not. Whereas in the prior election, people should remember he was not very pro, he was not pro crypto. He was vocal against it. Now he's totally changed his tune. And I think that's the simple calculus.
00:50:10.696 - 00:50:36.246, Speaker B: It's like he believes that it's not going to hurt him this time around because crypto continues to be more in the zeitgeist and it's actually going to help him win in these swing states. And so, yes, you best believe that there are probably more or at least 5100 thousand people in these swing states that will make a decision because of crypto or be marginally influenced to skew towards your direction of your pro crypto.
00:50:36.318 - 00:51:17.748, Speaker A: I mean, and you can just see it, like, changing on crypto Twitter. Like, there's some people who are very, very, very, like, pro Trump, and they're like, yeah, you know, if Kamala, if Kamala, like, became pro crypto, I'd probably vote for her. Like, that's, I think that's an indication of how people feel in general now, if they're a, whether or not, like, you agree with that or not. And I know there's a one argument which is, like, look, like, don't, don't buy what the dems are putting out right now. Like, so it's everyone's personal belief, but, like, I do think, and I have, I know colleagues and friends who will vote for Trump, but if Kamala became very pro crypto in the next couple of months, like, they, they would vote for Kamala. And so that's like, that's it happening on his mic.
00:51:17.804 - 00:51:25.158, Speaker B: I would want to see a more substantial plan around what her, what actually pro crypto means concretely?
00:51:25.214 - 00:51:45.318, Speaker A: Same, same. But look, like if you, if you fast forward this out, it's like, okay, so she'll probably pick. If I were her, who would I pick as vp? I'd probably pick Mark Kelly in Arizona because, like, where the dems are probably weakest is immigration stuff. And Mark Kelly is, like, in, in Arizona. He's a dem who's kind of, like, tough on the border. So I'd probably pick. And he's an astronaut.
00:51:45.318 - 00:52:05.430, Speaker A: Like, anyway, I'd probably pick him or I'd pick Josh appiro in Pennsylvania, but he's jewish, and people don't like jewish people. So I feel like I can say that is a, my last name is Janowitz, so I feel like I'm allowed to say that. So, um, yeah, I would, uh, I don't know. You do that. You pick, like, Mark Kelly and then you, like, go super heavy pro crypto. And like, I think the race will be tighter than people think.
00:52:06.730 - 00:52:29.116, Speaker B: We'll see. Prediction markets are telling a different story, but obviously we're going to continue to monitor that. And, you know, the peak, the odds of Trump winning peaked right after the assassination attempt. Now they're all probably only going to continue to go down. But, yeah, I still think he wins the election.
00:52:29.268 - 00:52:54.210, Speaker A: Yeah, we should do. We're getting Polygon involved in permissionless in a. We're getting poly market involved, actually, and Polygon involved in permissionless. We're talking to Shane right now about speaking. I'd love to have Shane on the podcast because I really do want to do. Polymarket has really, I tweeted this thing out. I sent a text to a friend who sends me polymarket charts all the time.
00:52:54.210 - 00:53:13.960, Speaker A: Non crypto guy, works in private equity. And I basically, I just text him, I said, did you know that poly market is built on Ethereum? Which I was wrong, it's built on Polygon. But screw me, he said. I said, did you know Polymarket is built on Ethereum? He said, lowell had absolutely no clue. Is there any relative value to it being blockchain based?
00:53:14.080 - 00:53:15.368, Speaker C: Honestly, I just see it as value.
00:53:15.424 - 00:53:36.444, Speaker A: For utility it offers, could care less about the underlying tech. I just like the data it provides in quantifying odds of meaningful shit happening in this world. So I thought that was cool. But it'll be interesting to see how Shane and polymarket are thinking about like, keeping the attention after the election. After the election. Because that's been the problem. I think you and I have been looking at a couple interesting.
00:53:36.492 - 00:53:42.324, Speaker B: I've looked at even one today, this morning. I mean, everyone wants to build now a prediction market. For context. I let the seed round.
00:53:42.452 - 00:53:45.252, Speaker A: I was a paraphrase in polymarket.
00:53:45.316 - 00:53:46.560, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:53:47.500 - 00:53:49.452, Speaker A: What did Shane do before? Do you know?
00:53:49.636 - 00:54:25.278, Speaker B: He was early in Ethereum. He was very much in nfts, actually. And he had like, been early in Ethereum very young, at a very young age, actually. And he's just very scrappy, like in the weeds kind of guy. And he was very active in the ethereum ecosystem and paying attention early on, early in NFT. So he was talking to me about, you know, he was collecting on what is it? Because that round was led also by, I think, Nick from one confirmation or so, we, he participated in that round as well. So anyways, he was also early in NFT.
00:54:25.278 - 00:55:20.498, Speaker B: So, yeah, Shane was a very scrappy, agile kind of builder, like in the weeds. And so, yeah, but the challenge, I think, of these prediction markets is yeah. What happens after the election? What happens to the tail end of markets? And do people want to bet on these things? And can you convince people to, you either put the money yourself to get a, you need to get a critical size for these markets to be useful. And the other component is like, it's like there's different. Not to get too much into it, but like the early redemption feature is something that is I've been thinking about quite a bit because it's like the opportunity costs, like back in January putting money into even the us election markets, you know, that's going to be resolved in November. And there's an opportunity cost of capital that during that period. And in crypto the opportunity cost of capital is very high.
00:55:20.498 - 00:55:39.426, Speaker B: Right. And so, yeah, I think we'll, I'll put it this way. I think we're going to see many different iterations of prediction markets on the back of polymarket success that particularly address the bootstrapping of these markets.
00:55:39.458 - 00:55:39.698, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:39.754 - 00:55:47.456, Speaker B: And maybe allowing features to get users to front the capital to come in and out of these markets more easily as opposed to being binary outcomes.
00:55:47.568 - 00:55:48.288, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:48.464 - 00:55:55.980, Speaker B: So, but yeah, everyone's, every ecosystem, every, you know, there's six projects that I'm looking at right now. I'm like, I don't know.
00:55:56.280 - 00:56:00.016, Speaker A: Yeah, Armand, good pod.
00:56:00.208 - 00:56:37.236, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really good. Just as a side note, I continue to interview for analyst. Have you feel really good about that? Yes, well, I have a shortlist. I'm continuing to talk to a few folks, but it's just been fascinating, really encouraged by the interest across, you know, people from all over the world, all kinds of backgrounds, all kinds of ages, like really exciting. So yeah, I think the program is going to, I'm setting everything in motion, I think will be off the ground later this year. But yeah, I'm really excited about it.
00:56:37.348 - 00:56:44.760, Speaker A: Have you noticed a trend in who you like? Is it like degens or is it like ex crypto vc people? Or is it like, what's the trend of who you like?
00:56:47.860 - 00:57:28.540, Speaker B: It's no different than investing in a startup. I think it's just people that have been in crypto for some time have taken hits, have made mistakes, have, and are very willing to talk about that. And so I usually have 2030. Like I usually talk to them back and forth and then if I like it, I'll schedule a call. And then in that call I'm just very open ended, like looking to see how they think. And I think you just get a good feeling about someone that is very, the biggest maybe you also, I mean, I'll ask you, like, what you look at for when you're hiring a blockworks, but for me, it's like a sense of true ownership and accountability.
00:57:29.760 - 00:57:30.592, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:30.776 - 00:58:00.488, Speaker B: And obviously drive like you love. You love talking about it, you love crypto. Like, you're here, you're using stuff, but it starts with accountability and ownership, because then I think that's why I love liquid markets a lot, and I never thought I'd actually like them as much because I was coming from a venture background. But there's something about hedge funds or just investing in something that is constantly either telling you you're right or wrong because it's a bit harder.
00:58:00.544 - 00:58:00.760, Speaker A: Right.
00:58:00.800 - 00:58:32.618, Speaker B: Adventure. You put money in and you're ten years down the road, or four in crypto or three, you're going to be told if you're right or not, but you actually don't have to live through the day to day of the volume and the market. You're absolutely wrong. You buy something that's down 1020, 30%, you're like, oh, okay, I'm an idiot or no. And I think something about that and investing in liquids markets is the. The intellectual stimulation and the honesty that it requires and managing your emotions and all that. I think so.
00:58:32.618 - 00:58:42.230, Speaker B: I think, yeah, those are the things I'm looking out for. And I've met some really interesting people in this process. So already it's been a really nice journey.
00:58:42.770 - 00:58:46.936, Speaker A: Nice. That's great. When do you think you'll make the hiretainous?
00:58:47.118 - 00:58:49.720, Speaker B: I pretty sure I already know who they're gonna be.
00:58:51.220 - 00:58:52.220, Speaker A: Love that.
00:58:52.380 - 00:59:05.960, Speaker B: Yeah, but it was like, and it was actually, like the first. I interviewed the first three people, two out of three. But I'm allowing myself to meet, like, other candidates. But, yeah, by September, I think.
00:59:07.540 - 00:59:12.320, Speaker A: Do they work at a fund currently or at a crypto company, or are they just an individual?
00:59:13.040 - 00:59:16.400, Speaker B: Without tipping my hand too much, but one, yes. The other one does not.
00:59:16.560 - 00:59:20.860, Speaker A: You're like, they might work at blockworks research. I'm not going to.
00:59:21.960 - 00:59:30.512, Speaker B: No, no, no. And they're from, like, different, totally different places and age too. Like ten years apart.
00:59:30.616 - 00:59:31.420, Speaker A: That's great.
00:59:32.320 - 00:59:33.616, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm really excited.
00:59:33.808 - 00:59:34.280, Speaker A: Nice.
00:59:34.360 - 00:59:36.656, Speaker B: See, it's a good experiment.
00:59:36.768 - 00:59:49.092, Speaker A: That is a good experiment. All right, folks, good pod. Thanks for listening. Permissionless tickets go up next week in pricing. They're 499 now. I think we're moving them to 599. We've had a crazy month of buying.
00:59:49.092 - 01:00:01.156, Speaker A: July was our biggest month by, like four x or something like that. So, yeah, go get your tickets, if you have. If you haven't got them yet, tickets go up July 29. I think so, yeah.
01:00:01.228 - 01:00:05.062, Speaker B: And if you want to, I guess it's a play pickleball, you know?
01:00:05.166 - 01:00:09.950, Speaker A: Oh, and we have a code. It's Empire ten. You'll say 10%.
01:00:09.990 - 01:00:13.250, Speaker B: 10%. Usually that's how it works.
01:00:14.990 - 01:00:24.774, Speaker A: Every, every time after the podcast, our marketing team is like, you forgot to mention permissionless. Link, Link, Link.
01:00:24.862 - 01:01:00.028, Speaker B: All right, everyone, well, I hope you're having a great summer or winter, wherever you are in the hemisphere, but, yeah, interesting time. So thanks for listening and whatever. We didn't get to read comments, actually, but we'll do that. We'll have to do that next time, so feel free to drop us. One thing I'll mention, last episode, you yano, asked people if they wanted to hear about founders and early narratives. We had a great episode that we recorded earlier this week with the founder, Jonathan from Skytrade. That episode should go live in the next couple of days.
01:01:00.028 - 01:01:47.816, Speaker B: I really enjoyed that conversation, just from an education perspective of how air rights work, the nuance, and why it actually, I think it's going to be one of our better episodes to. Everyone understands real estate, but I think it's one of those we really went and focused on why does this actually need to be built on Crypto? Why Crypto? And I think that's going to be, it's coming at the right time where people are really a skeptical of. There's no utility in this space and we need more apps and less infra. And two, real estate is something that a lot of people particularly pay more attention with the ETF can understand and relate to. So I'm really excited to see how that performs. And, you know, if people like it would love to continue to, you know, do more of those type of episodes.
01:01:47.928 - 01:01:51.576, Speaker A: 100%. 100%. So. All right, everyone, great Friday.
01:01:51.648 - 01:01:52.542, Speaker B: Thanks for listening.
01:01:52.656 - 01:01:53.674, Speaker A: We'll see you next week.
01:01:53.802 - 01:01:54.950, Speaker B: Have a good weekend, man.
01:01:55.970 - 01:02:17.310, Speaker C: Thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly mention that the wait for Crypto's killer app wave is nearly over.
