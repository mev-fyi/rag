00:00:00.400 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about chronicle later in the show. All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new Defi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect yourself, your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Go check out bumper. It's bumper five.
00:00:33.894 - 00:00:44.310, Speaker A: Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. Santi. Happy Friday. What's up, man?
00:00:44.502 - 00:01:00.426, Speaker B: Oh, not much. You know, I think you somehow this, this conference virus was streamed through the Internets and reached over because I'm feeling some throat pain, and blockworks is hurting right now.
00:01:00.490 - 00:01:02.374, Speaker A: I mean, we're, we're down bad.
00:01:03.194 - 00:01:07.578, Speaker B: I hate to say this, but if there's a way to short block words is the productivity.
00:01:07.746 - 00:01:09.034, Speaker A: You can't say that on the pod.
00:01:09.074 - 00:01:13.882, Speaker B: Come on. I love you guys, but, you know, productivity is down. If more than 8% of the company's.
00:01:13.898 - 00:01:24.302, Speaker A: Down, productivity is booming. We're just doing it with less people right now. We're between the bronchitis, the laryngitis, and whatever this.
00:01:24.398 - 00:01:39.270, Speaker B: Yeah, whatever it is, you know, there has been a spike in COVID. It's like, no surprise. Everyone's like, the kids are back in school, you know? Um, but, yeah, it's what, that dynamic where, like, you're more productive when you're, like, very busy or just like. Yeah, you lose.
00:01:39.422 - 00:01:39.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:39.782 - 00:01:41.198, Speaker B: So, anyways, maybe it's not.
00:01:41.366 - 00:01:47.834, Speaker A: We're almost two years into this bear market from, like, market tops. How are you feeling about things right now?
00:01:48.824 - 00:02:27.024, Speaker B: It's very interesting to say that because that's the thing that I was mostly focused on, just kind of reading the room, absorbing the sentiment at permissionless. How am I feeling? Probably as important as how I think the market is feeling. But I do think we're entering this state of just apathy, kind of despair, desperation. Because you think we're just entering it? Well, not, not entering it. I mean, look, we've been chopping around this range for a long time. I do sense some eeriness in traditional markets. Uh, like, my.
00:02:27.024 - 00:03:17.030, Speaker B: I just. If you're looking, I mean, this week's been terrible, um, for general tech and just the stock market. Um, like I've said it in prior podcasts, it was not on my bingo card to have a super strong year to date recovery of the Nasdaq of the S p. It just been pretty impressive. I don't think it's been substantiated by fundamentals. Like, I'm just really cautious, largely informed by people that I respect, like Stan Druckenmiller and others that have just generally been very honest about and open about saying it's been a very challenging environment. And then you go to a conference like permissionless, and you talk to, you know, some of the folks that I was on the panel, or just some of traditional builders, or particularly allocators like in crypto, and they're like, look, um, business as usual.
00:03:17.030 - 00:03:57.464, Speaker B: There's a lot of very interesting stuff happening in crypto. It's a secular trend. Like, you know, there's, there's reasons to be really excited about all this stuff. But a part of me can't overlook this idea that, like anyone that's sub 35 years old has never invested through a persistently high interest rate environment. And I think it has been my kind of thinking for a while that most people are of the mind that we're going to go back to a lower interest rate environment. And I get it. There probably is whatever probability you're ascribing to rate cuts has been totally demolished over the last six months.
00:03:57.464 - 00:04:43.654, Speaker B: We keep pushing the bar, but more importantly, it's just this. I do think that is regardless of rate cuts in the near term or in the medium term, I think that as an investor class, perhaps the biggest mistake that we could have done, or I could have done, is not factoring in that we're not going to go back to another ten years of record low interest rates. And how do you go from there? Not so much of where we are in the bear market. It's more of that reset of, okay, like, so what asset class. So what do we do and how do you manage that juxtaposed with this idea that, I mean, we're here, we talk about crypto. We are very much of. I wouldn't be you and I wouldn't be wasting our time if we didn't believe that this was the best bet that you could make in the next ten years.
00:04:43.654 - 00:05:03.350, Speaker B: I think that probabilistically, with high conviction. And there's reason to be really excited. There's reasons to be not as excited. There's a lot of frustration at times. But, yeah, I don't know. I mean, this is from mine as an investor that I like to get involved. I like to talk to founders on the daily.
00:05:03.350 - 00:05:11.074, Speaker B: But I am curious. You as a builder, you manage a lot of people, you cover the space. How are you feeling?
00:05:11.734 - 00:05:35.080, Speaker A: We have different proxies. Right. Of growth of the industry. I can actually get pretty insightful metrics into our analytics product with the on chain metrics. But as a media company, right. We have podcast downloads, page views, newsletter subscribers, newsletter open rate. But ad revenue, I think, is a pretty interesting indicator of how actually not just we are feeling, but the industry is feeling the bottom of bear market.
00:05:35.080 - 00:06:53.754, Speaker A: Ad revenue goes to a low at the top of a bull market. Actually, there's a little bit of a lag in ad markets, usually three to six month lag at the top. Ad revenue is like, everybody's trying to acquire new users. And the reason ad revenue falls at the bottom of bear markets is because companies and protocols don't believe that any new users are coming into the industry, so they don't believe that they need to spend money on advertising. And for the first time, in about four or five quarters, we're starting to see that ad revenue pick back up. And what that tells me is that founders, CMOs, CROs of growth, leads at protocols and c five companies are starting to believe that either there's a new cohort of people coming into the industry, or that maybe they'll be able to raise their next venture fund so they can allocate, or they'll be able to raise their next round, maybe because there's fresh capital coming into the venture space, as we saw with blockchain Capital's $580 million raise this week. So I think the ad markets are actually a kind of interesting proxy, uh, for how folks are feeling that people don't really know and look at, because who, like, I don't know, but to us, coindesk, like, not many people have info on the ad markets.
00:06:53.754 - 00:06:57.074, Speaker A: So I think that might be a number I'd throw out at you.
00:06:57.234 - 00:07:14.514, Speaker B: That's super interesting. I'd like to understand the, like, do you look at the composition of that revenue? Like, who is actually spending? Is it crypto natives? Is it c five companies? Is it, like, some other random, like, and how does that change at the top of the market? At the bottom of the market.
00:07:16.294 - 00:07:16.582, Speaker A: Is.
00:07:16.598 - 00:07:23.294, Speaker B: There a meaningful change? Or is it always the same suspects that end up spending money? Meaning, like, protocols and crypto native apps?
00:07:23.454 - 00:08:02.694, Speaker A: So it's changed over time. It used to be the, here's kind of the evolution of big ad dollars coming into blockworks. It used to be the companies going after institutions, largely because that was also blockworks brand. Right? So if you look at the advertisers they're anyone trying to pull. Pull Aum onto their platform, not through retail, but by reaching institutional customers. So that would be folks who spend money with us to get in front of family offices, hedge funds, sovereigns, pensions, Ras, financial advisors, folks like that. So those were like the big custodians of the world, right? The big kind of settlement layers of the.
00:08:02.694 - 00:08:33.814, Speaker A: So, fire blocks, right? Copper ledger, bitgo, Coinbase, custody, Kraken, institutional, people like that. Those were the big advertisers. Then we saw a shift in the bull market, which was the big advertisers, and the big money spenders were the big exchanges. Okx, Coinbase, Kraken, crypto.com, comma, people like that. Those were the big spenders at the top of the bull market. And now the big spenders are.
00:08:33.814 - 00:08:48.084, Speaker A: For anyone who's been going to these conferences, you'll see a lot of the protocols, right? There were protocols at ECC, for example, who spent $3 million on site. And the reason for that ECC, which is whether or not, I don't know.
00:08:48.124 - 00:08:51.504, Speaker B: But hold on, how much? 3 million.
00:08:52.044 - 00:08:56.184, Speaker A: I did hear one protocol spent $4 million at EC to what?
00:08:57.244 - 00:08:57.884, Speaker B: To do what?
00:08:57.924 - 00:09:04.198, Speaker A: Side events, basically. Side events. So here's what everyone needs in a bear. So in wait.
00:09:04.366 - 00:09:21.358, Speaker B: I'm just really shocked, maybe. I don't know that. I mean, I know that the conferences can be lucrative. I'm just thinking. I'm just thinking of the. Of the guy, that massive thread of, like, of FTX, and how Sam's parents, his dad was like, you're only paying me. And, like, demanded a raise for $1 million per year.
00:09:21.358 - 00:09:23.270, Speaker B: Like, just disgusting stuff.
00:09:23.422 - 00:09:25.230, Speaker A: But. So, of course, we know that they.
00:09:25.262 - 00:09:29.034, Speaker B: Charter private planes to get Amazon into the bahamas.
00:09:30.004 - 00:10:00.094, Speaker A: But, man, here's how ad markets work. At the beginning of a bull market, the biggest advertisers and the biggest cohort of people that companies want to go after are institutions, because oftentimes institutions kind of maybe kick off a new market, or there's this narrative, or, like, Paul Tudor remembered May of 2020, or whenever that was Paul Tudor Jones. Bitcoin's the fastest horse in the race. So then everyone wants to come after these institutions. They want to pull the institutional money onto the platform. All right? Institutions come into the industry. Market goes up.
00:10:00.094 - 00:10:26.396, Speaker A: Then who comes into an industry? Retail and consumers. Right? So then the big spenders are like, back, you know, in the last bull market, it was exchanges because they were like blockfi or Celsius or FTX or Coinbase or crypto.com or whoever, Gemini, they want to get all the millions of users who are coming into the industry onto their platform. Because once you onboard onto Gemini, you're not leaving Gemini, right. It's like onboarding onto bank of America. You're not then going to change onto Wells Fargo. It's super sticky.
00:10:26.396 - 00:10:32.532, Speaker A: Then that happens and that maybe takes another 18 months. Then we go into a bear market and the number one advertiser in a.
00:10:32.548 - 00:11:24.084, Speaker B: Bear market, before we go there, who's measuring their return on ad spend? Like, okay, first of all, my working assumption is that retail usually comes first. Like retail, all the crypto cycles very much been retail led, you know, stimulus money and whatnot. Like all of like. But it's very much a retail phenomenon. When you talk about institutions, you're the say you're a chief marketing officer at like, protocol, flavor, competitor to ETH that wants to spend a ton of money and just raise $200 million. And you're saying you maybe come from Google and you're a marketing guru. What kind of like marketing return on ads and roas are you doing to justify spending millions of dollars? To what end? To convince Paul Tudor Jones to put money on bitcoin.
00:11:24.744 - 00:11:43.800, Speaker A: That guy is not to convince him to put money into it. Yeah, no, I mean, that's right. That's right. So like, here's the metric that we track for folks who advertise with blockworks, mqls. So in a b, two B sas. In a b, in b, two B SaaS, there are different metrics that matter. So mqls are marketing qualified leads.
00:11:43.800 - 00:12:12.548, Speaker A: Those are the people at the top of the funnel. Those are the, that is typically like a cmo of a, of a, of a SaaS company, crypto or not. Crypto will have one metric that matters. It's MQLs marketing qualified leads. How many leads are they able to pass to the sales team? Once you pass an MQL over to the sales team, a sales team will have an intro call with them. If they are a qualified lead, that becomes an SQL sales qualified lead. And then that's when the pipeline, that's when the pipeline starts and you move it through the pipeline.
00:12:12.548 - 00:12:43.242, Speaker A: Right. Discovery conversation that goes poorly, move out of the pipeline. That goes well, moving through the pipeline. Then it goes to proposal presented, then contract out, and then intent to buy and then contract out. So what we help with is the MQL is the marketing qualified lead, right? So if you are the CMO of bitgo, you're like, hey, I have a 30 person sales team. I've got to feed them leads. The, we need to reach hedge funds interested in allocate in staking.
00:12:43.242 - 00:12:46.546, Speaker A: You can't run an inst, you can't run an Instagram, right.
00:12:46.610 - 00:12:55.474, Speaker B: Or like, or like research or I understand like webinars. If you're a custodian, you want to Anchorage. Yeah, that business. I get it. I get it.
00:12:55.554 - 00:13:23.806, Speaker A: And then they have their ltvs, right? Like they know the lifetime value of a customer. So if you, if Anchorage, if Anchorage signs up, you know, Santiago or like, you know, when you repair, I don't know what custodians you guys use when you're at parafy, but like they, onboard you, right? They're clipping a tiny, tiny, tiny percent of Aum, though, that actually the custodian models changing to a SaaS model from a fee model and then they upsell you, right? They upsell you through trading fees and lend lending and borrowing and all that kind of stuff.
00:13:23.990 - 00:13:49.774, Speaker B: So, yeah, no, that, I understand that segment of the market. And that was my original question. Like I can appreciate how someone like bitco, some like Anchorage, like tradition, like c five, you remember that term, CD five, those kind of players like exchanges. Sure. But, but I do see, and correct me here, I'm wrong. A lot of spot, a lot of spend from, you know, like protocols. Like, you know, like, I don't know, l one of sorts.
00:13:49.774 - 00:14:34.288, Speaker B: And I think I'd be really curious to understand because one sector that I've been investing in and thinking about is how do you stitch together a profile to understand, basically, like an adwords, if you will, just understanding and stitching together to figure out customer acquisition. What type of marketing is effective if you're a protocol. And how do you acquire the said users? Because they come from web two and then they enter web3 and then there is a disconnect there to some extent. There's a few companies that I've been looking at that are trying to kind of stitch together this profile of a customer. Uh, but I think it's fascinating. Like, and to be fair, I'm not like dismissive of the category. Like I look at the end of.
00:14:34.296 - 00:14:35.760, Speaker A: The day, no, no, I know there's.
00:14:35.792 - 00:14:50.004, Speaker B: A lot of flow. There's, you know, you can look at it and slice in many different ways. Like the average crypto user, NFT, like is above, like, you know, is fairly well off and has more disposable income. And it's a very attractive, it's a very attractive cohort.
00:14:50.344 - 00:15:06.128, Speaker A: Let me just, let me show you. Yeah, let me show you this auntie. So, like, let me. Let's talk about the. The ROI of a protocol doing marketing. So let me pull up the base. All right, so this is blockworks analytics platform.
00:15:06.128 - 00:15:33.146, Speaker A: So you can click on base and you can look at the financials, right? So you can see that base, right? You can see the fees. So every day, like, here's the fees. 200K in fees. The cost to settle back to the l one is on September 14, they did 189,000 fees. The cost to settle back to the l one was 88,000. So the profit was 101,000. Now, what is driving most of this, right? What is driving, like, this black line is profit right here.
00:15:33.146 - 00:15:56.484, Speaker A: What is driving this? Well, it's friendtech. So then my question, like, the question becomes, all right, well, what is the LTV of, like, friend tech? Like, let's say. Let's say you're. Let's say you're base. Now, base didn't have to really do marketing, but let's say you're ZK sync or scroll or arbitrum or optimism. Like, what. What is the value of getting the two founders of Friendtech to build on your platform? And that was probably a relationship driven deal.
00:15:56.484 - 00:16:16.940, Speaker A: But, like, you know, at ECC, there's like. Or at permissionless, there's a lot of founders who are like, look, I just moved. I just came in from Facebook. I'm trying to figure out which l one or l two I should build on. And if. And if you're arbitrum and you've got the 40 by 40 booth and you are sponsoring the hackathon, like, it is more likely that a founder will build on you. So.
00:16:17.052 - 00:16:55.454, Speaker B: No, that's a really good point, actually. You know, it. There is this idea of, like, you know, I always think when you say that VHS, Betamax, like, sometimes the best tech doesn't win, it's like, the best marketer. In this case, you know, VHS was a super inferior product, you know, but just, you know, had better marketing, had better visibility, had, you know, better presence, so, you know, ultimately became the standard. And I think that that decision tree of. From founders, I think, is very much real and I experience it. You know, obviously, I'm biased because I'm investor in some, like, scroll and arbitram, but, you know, when people ask me, you know, I naturally direct them to, hey, go talk to steams, right?
00:16:56.674 - 00:16:57.130, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:57.202 - 00:16:57.554, Speaker B: So.
00:16:57.634 - 00:17:24.713, Speaker A: So, yeah, there is. Let me read you this quote. So there was just a huge study done on basically b two B buyers and crypto. No, in SAS. In SAS, actually, but I think it applies. I think b two b, like, I think they're very similar. Two thirds of the time.
00:17:24.713 - 00:18:00.370, Speaker A: This was one of the biggest brand studies ever done on buying behavior of b, two b buyers two thirds of the time. So 66% of the time, when a business decision maker purchases software, they already have a brand in time. And 94% of the time, if they do have the brand, the brand in mind, the buyer ends up sticking with that brand. So, like, I don't know. It's funny because, like, part of my job is convincing marketers that they should still spend on brand marketing in a bear market very hard. And I totally get why they don't do that. But, like, if you're not part of the original consideration set, there's no way you're getting bought, there's no way they're using you.
00:18:00.370 - 00:18:01.642, Speaker A: So this is very real.
00:18:01.698 - 00:18:15.876, Speaker B: Like, actually this was something that I talked to a few folks in crypto at the conference around. Yeah, there are very opinionated folks that just come to table and they don't do proper, like rfps. They just, they just kind of go with someone because they've, there's, that's, that's.
00:18:15.900 - 00:18:17.772, Speaker A: How buying, and you can't really justify.
00:18:17.908 - 00:18:26.868, Speaker B: And it was like, all right, okay, well, did you consider X and Y? They're like, no, we just kind of wanted to do this. And it was like, okay, it's trust, man.
00:18:26.916 - 00:18:47.414, Speaker A: It's true. It's, it comes down to trust if you do 6% times 94. So, so that is 62% of all software buying decisions are being made with a brand that the buyer already knows. Right. So that's why something like, so we did this. We sent out this survey after permissionless. Yeah, this is just turning into an ad for, for blockworks marketing.
00:18:47.454 - 00:18:50.198, Speaker B: But like we said, we don't ever do that here.
00:18:50.326 - 00:19:07.860, Speaker A: We never do that. Never, never do that. Um, we sent out a survey after the conference and got a couple hundred people to, to respond to it. And one of the questions was like, what's the most memorable brand in your mind after permissionless? And no surprise, it's the big, it's the ones who spent a lot of money.
00:19:07.892 - 00:19:09.384, Speaker B: I guess bracken or squirrel.
00:19:10.004 - 00:19:12.668, Speaker A: It was OKX. OKX was first.
00:19:12.716 - 00:19:14.504, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. They had that Kraken.
00:19:14.964 - 00:19:21.620, Speaker A: Kraken was second. I think metamask was third. And I think scroll was like fifth or 6th, I'm pretty sure.
00:19:21.692 - 00:19:24.202, Speaker B: Which were violent and purposes the largest boots.
00:19:24.388 - 00:19:39.126, Speaker A: So you better believe, like, let's say there's an, I don't know let's say someone wants, like, let's say someone wants to get off of. I don't know. I'm trying to toe a line here because they all compete with each other, but, like, yeah, people are more likely to now use. Okay, who went to permissionless?
00:19:39.190 - 00:20:05.590, Speaker B: So, yeah, the brain works in mysterious ways. You get a sticker from a company that you put, by the way, never put stick crypto stickers on your tech gear. For an Opsec perspective, folks, um, you know, stay safe nonetheless. Some of those are really cool. Like, you want to put them on, but I've seen laptops. I've seen laptops, like, with bombardment. Like, guys, um, you're at a cafe, and you have every single crypto logo on your laptop.
00:20:05.590 - 00:20:07.606, Speaker B: You best believe someone's looking that, and.
00:20:07.630 - 00:20:09.834, Speaker A: You'Re a target blue, so, you know, target.
00:20:11.294 - 00:20:13.674, Speaker B: Uh, but, like, there's. There's some good merch.
00:20:14.334 - 00:20:18.918, Speaker A: I have a markets question right now, like, kind of shifting gears a little bit. Um, so you.
00:20:19.006 - 00:20:22.198, Speaker B: This is not a marketing podcast, but, hey, it was interesting. It's just shocking.
00:20:22.286 - 00:20:51.598, Speaker A: Well, you didn't join us on this podcast, but Antonio from Spindle came on, and Antonio helped build the ad market team at Facebook, and so should go listen to that podcast. All right, so there's a liquid trade that's happening right now, mainly for a while. It's been going on for a while. So I said Lido in the Telegram channel, but really it's maker. So I just had breakfast with that fund I was telling you about that is going to announce soon. And then coin fund. Coin fund was there, too.
00:20:51.598 - 00:21:38.106, Speaker A: And there's some other big crypto investors there, and everyone's talking about what they call the most crowded trade in crypto right now, which is maker. And if you look back over history, the last at least five, six, seven years in crypto, kind of sustained positive repricing of a couple of altcoins oftentimes leads to this kind of market wide rally, because people get excited, they start chasing other things. And if you look at the beginning of this year, or maybe it was end of last year, but Lido and Sol led the way. It was probably actually beginning of this year, like, January, February, Lido and Sol led the way. And then a kind of bigger market wide rally came. Now, it sold off, obviously, but that's all right. So right now, what's happening is people are flooding into this kind of crowded maker trade pretty quickly, and makers up, like 30, 40%.
00:21:38.250 - 00:21:38.974, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:40.154 - 00:22:15.884, Speaker A: In the last couple of, I don't know, month or two I haven't looked exactly at the charts, and I think a lot of that is because people are getting excited about Roon and really the subdao vision and stuff like that. I would just be curious. When you see something like maker outperforming, do you start to think about, hey, is that trade over yet? Should I pile into that? Do you say, hey, look, I'm not going to pile into that trade. Maybe this is a harbinger of this kind of coming market wide rally. I should start to allocate elsewhere? Or you're like, look, I'm not touching trading. I'm staying away from this game.
00:22:17.104 - 00:23:23.610, Speaker B: Well, I think everyone in crypto needs to somehow is forced into this liquid venture conundrum, which is you cannot overlook trading from a risk management perspective. Even if you were a longtime believer and maker, you constantly need to wake up and do this exercise of based on where things are today at this particular price valuation. Would I from scratch build this portfolio again in the same weight and in the same composition? That's an exercise that probably some of the best advice I've gotten and a framework that I take to heart. You wake up each day, not, not each day on some sort of cadence to your point. So, yeah, like, I pay attention to trading because if some. If a position becomes a disproportionate share of my portfolio, like it's a problem, I need to manage that risk somehow. And so, but I don't like, I don't like chasing these narratives.
00:23:23.610 - 00:24:06.146, Speaker B: Like, I do think that there is a probably half of the folks that are, or more than half of the folks are piling onto this particular trade as they have the same kind of folks that pile onto these trades maker. For instance, it was very obvious on chain that the largest holders of MKR, a 16 z and paradigm were dumping it. They were sending it to an exchange. Usually people send coins to exchange is to, you know, dispose of them. And they were pretty big holders, and they were, they've been for years. I think a 16 c let some of the earlier rounds. And so as MKR started rally, they started selling off.
00:24:06.146 - 00:24:36.646, Speaker B: I think they've total, they've. And you. And by the way, what's so interesting about crypto is like, you can understand the wallets if you're Matt, if you're using an analytics tool or whatnot, a lot of these wallets, and then you're seeing exactly how the position that they have. Right, unlike like 13 fs, right, where you see the retroactively what hedge funds did in that quarter in crypto is real time, like you say, okay. You know, they have 10% of the supply and they, every day they're selling at x amount, which is x percent of volume. And so you're. You're seeing a seller in real time.
00:24:36.646 - 00:24:54.170, Speaker B: And so that was part of what sometimes catalyzes these trades. Right. And. Or like large unlocks and whatnot for Maker also. I mean, we had rune talk about the end game. It's. It's a protocol that is, you know, from a fundamental perspective.
00:24:54.170 - 00:24:59.594, Speaker B: I mean, I don't have the figures in front of me, but it spits out cash flow. You know, I think they'll do 100.
00:24:59.674 - 00:25:01.602, Speaker A: Million in revenue this year. Don't quote me on that.
00:25:01.618 - 00:25:03.058, Speaker B: But I'm pretty sure, give or take.
00:25:03.106 - 00:25:03.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:03.290 - 00:25:11.504, Speaker B: And so, and so if you look at what kind of. The valuation of maker, the market cap, what is it now you probably have in front of you, but I'm gonna just.
00:25:11.544 - 00:25:21.720, Speaker A: Part of maker. So it's makers up 115% in the last year. But I'm just making like 1.1.31 .2 billion fully diluted.
00:25:21.752 - 00:25:22.248, Speaker B: 1.3.
00:25:22.296 - 00:25:22.456, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:22.480 - 00:25:31.544, Speaker B: And so if it's cranking out 100 million of revenue, you could argue that it has some of the, you know, it's what? 13 x.
00:25:31.664 - 00:25:33.164, Speaker A: 13 x, yeah.
00:25:33.884 - 00:26:00.550, Speaker B: Uh, I'm sorry to break it, folks, but you look of any tech name. First of all, it is very interesting that. That you have, like, cash flow generative companies this early on in an asset class that is very much super early stage. Like, go look at, like, Instacart. They just. IPO, Uber, Amazon. I mean, these businesses don't.
00:26:00.550 - 00:26:15.854, Speaker B: Are not cash flow generative. They don't have positive unit economics. But. But they've only survived because over the last ten years, I go back to this. We had free money. They wouldn't have worked otherwise. And that's.
00:26:16.274 - 00:26:19.306, Speaker A: I have a theory on those businesses, all three of the ones you mentioned.
00:26:19.330 - 00:26:33.190, Speaker B: But I mean, like, fundamentally, this is like, you know, no surprise. We've had band foreman here. My former partner, he's a maker bowl, has been as maker of. As a. As much as a maker bowl as one can be.
00:26:33.262 - 00:26:33.782, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:26:33.838 - 00:26:34.598, Speaker B: Consistently.
00:26:34.726 - 00:26:38.166, Speaker A: Well, you guys jumped in on whatever we call that day black Thursday, right?
00:26:38.190 - 00:27:28.576, Speaker B: Oh, God, yeah, that was fun. And we were very active talking to the team. And, you know, it's one of those things where. How long are you willing to be patient? And this is a common problem that you have in particular in crypto, where we're just liquid markets, where the, like, MKR just grossly underperformed ETH and everything else for a really long time. And so did Defi. Defi started really underperforming ETH even before, you know, there's semblance of rate hikes and everything else, you know, tumbled in November of 2021-2222 and so it's really difficult when something like that in your face is just, you know, underperforming. What do you do? Do you pile on? Do you buy more? Um, you know, you have your, your, you know, it really eats at you.
00:27:28.576 - 00:28:24.894, Speaker B: And so, I mean, is it a crowded trade? You could argue that a 13 times P E. The real question is, where does that go? Like, where's those earnings go? Given the fundamental changes in the protocol in the end game and what mate in Roon is articulated, that's what I care about. Why would Maker's business model is effectively allowing people to programmatically mint a stable coin, a stable unit of concept called Dai, depositing a particular asset, said ETH, for instance, ETH. And that was really the novelty of Maker. In a very volatile asset class, you want to borrow against your holdings, particularly in a bear market. Like Maker really got a lot of traction. In the last bear market, you could have looked at Maker, and that's where people really started to say, huh, you have an asset class, particularly ETH, that has gone down 80%.
00:28:24.894 - 00:29:04.954, Speaker B: And this protocol has allowed people to borrow against that, that don't want to sell because they didn't sell at the top to borrow, and has maintained solvent in very adversarial conditions like this is, that's pretty interesting. Like, you know, in traditional markets, something goes down 10%, the regulators step in and freeze the goddamn trading. You know, banks collapse. And so that's when actually that, that's the real story behind defi taking off. Not, not to like, do you know history here, lesson 101. But to your point around, yeah, I do think that. Is it a crowded trade? Probably hard to tell.
00:29:04.954 - 00:29:29.406, Speaker B: But if you look at the fundamentals, you say, does it have more room to grow? Well, you'll be the judge of that. If 13 times. If you believe in the quality of those earnings, if you believe in, you know, macro does, there's a high correlation, yada, yada, yada. But more importantly, I think it's the idea of, and we keep talking about use cases. That is a good use case. Like the idea of borrowing against and like the money market. Use case is very real.
00:29:29.406 - 00:30:19.196, Speaker B: The DeFI use case is very real. And then you do a market analysis, how many more people do you think are going to show up to mint to borrow against their holdings? And are they going to be the preferred venue to borrow against those holdings? Do you believe in Dai, do you believe in their multicolateral die, which is a huge, huge controversy in this endgame? So anyways, long story short, I don't pay much attention into these things is, but it is an interesting opportunity if you, for instance, have been doing your homework on some assets, whatever it is, maker, I always have a shopping list. I have like literally track like 20 names or so and add cut to list. And then I'm looking for catalysts and the best catalyst that I love is a four seller.
00:30:19.380 - 00:30:19.908, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:19.996 - 00:30:24.080, Speaker B: Like you see someone that's just for selling. Yeah, I'll clip, I'll buy.
00:30:24.152 - 00:30:26.884, Speaker A: When you have a shopping list, do you put a price next to it?
00:30:27.824 - 00:30:29.248, Speaker B: Yeah, I have alerts.
00:30:29.416 - 00:30:45.784, Speaker A: Okay. And when you see that price. All right, so let me, let me just use maker. I'm not saying makers on your list, but right now maker is trading at $1,300. Let's say you had a price. Let's say maker goes on the list. Then you're like, well, what price am I a buyer of? Maker? Maybe you say a 1000, $1,000.
00:30:45.864 - 00:30:52.074, Speaker B: There is a, where I will literally sell traditional assets, load up the trouble.
00:30:52.154 - 00:30:54.482, Speaker A: Sell my podcast equipment.
00:30:54.538 - 00:31:00.034, Speaker B: I will go to a pawn shop and, yeah, or even raise a fund.
00:31:00.194 - 00:31:02.226, Speaker A: What is that price of ETH for you?
00:31:02.410 - 00:31:07.490, Speaker B: Sub a 1000, 7000. Not, this is financial or messages. This is just my opinion.
00:31:07.602 - 00:31:08.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:08.426 - 00:31:34.742, Speaker B: And I, a lot, a lot of the conversation, not to like, but a lot of the conversations I had with folks way back was like, if hit like 900 or so. Largely it's informed by the prior cycle low. And also I think we've been holding and hovering around this trillion dollar aggregate market cap, which is, anyway, I triangulate to it, but I think ETH sub 1000 is something that I am quite interested in.
00:31:34.878 - 00:31:38.874, Speaker A: Yeah, Solana, you think we get there, this market.
00:31:41.774 - 00:31:43.550, Speaker B: Try it every single time.
00:31:43.582 - 00:31:45.112, Speaker A: Take a shot. Take a shot.
00:31:45.208 - 00:31:56.688, Speaker B: Look, I will say this every single time that I think I'm not going to see an asset at a given price ever again. You know, those like memes, like folks, this is the last time you're going.
00:31:56.696 - 00:31:58.764, Speaker A: To see bitcoin at 30,000.
00:31:59.464 - 00:32:46.314, Speaker B: I'm like, you could almost counter trade that to a t and be patient. So I'd be fooling myself if I were not paying attention to traditional markets, something that I've been paying more attention to. I appreciate it, it's not my strength. It's, it's super hard. But it, you have to pay attention to it. Like, it feels fragile. And I do, I do wonder, like, again, the biggest question is, if we're in a persistently high interest rate environment, what's the appetite? Where is the incremental user going to come from? You know, at this point, to me, it feels like we're sloshing around funds within crypto and there's just a value transfer from one player that's already in the economy to another.
00:32:46.314 - 00:32:48.754, Speaker B: I don't see many people coming in.
00:32:49.294 - 00:32:50.054, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:50.214 - 00:33:35.836, Speaker B: But, you know, the real, perhaps the question to you, which, from your vantage point, like one, how are you feeling about, you know, do you think we'll ever get, you know, a sole sub ten bitcoin back at ten k or 15k? Like, you know, not, not to exactly say, is it going to be 15, is it going to be 16, is going to be 20. But what are the things that you're seeing that you would, that, that, you know, from a probability standpoint, do you think it's higher or lower probability? We see, for instance, for instance, with ETH, do you think there's a higher probability of seeing ETH at 2000 or back at 1000? So, ethan, 2000 or back at a 1000 2000?
00:33:36.020 - 00:33:46.276, Speaker A: Like hands, hands down? Hands down. The reason for that is because to get to what's ethat today?
00:33:46.340 - 00:33:51.396, Speaker B: 1516 hundred, 1590. Call it 16, 50%.
00:33:51.540 - 00:34:27.700, Speaker A: Okay, so the, so the reason for that is because the only way it gets down to a thousand, in my opinion, is if there's like something catastrophic that happens in crypto. So you could have a big macro drawdown, for example. Macro drawdown would pull it down to, I don't know, 1413 hundred, something like that. Things that pull prices down that strongly are FTX collapsing, terra collapsing, celsius and blockfi going under. Big colossal crypto inside the ecosystem, movements that suck all the liquidity out and cause a bunch of forced sellers that I think is gone in crypto. I don't think we have, like, I.
00:34:27.732 - 00:34:29.454, Speaker B: Believe that we've washed out a lot.
00:34:29.564 - 00:34:46.386, Speaker A: I think we've washed out states. But, you know, all of that now, macro could get much worse before it gets better. The market, like the Nasdaq, could go back down after having a decent start to the year. Like, and that would push, because crypto is farther out on the spectrum. That would push it down. But I don't think you see, just.
00:34:46.410 - 00:35:18.054, Speaker B: To put a finer comb on this. So it's like this would be a 25 to get to 2000. You're basically a 25% rally to go down to a thousand. It's like a drop, but 37% drop. So, you know, there's a bit more ace, there's a bit more, you know, but so again, the Nasdaq's up. What is it, 27% on the year. If, if crypto has a three x, two and a half, two to three times beta, do you believe that the Nasdaq can't drop 10%, 12%, get some of the gains?
00:35:21.734 - 00:35:23.914, Speaker A: Is the beta that strong to the Nasdaq?
00:35:25.014 - 00:35:48.038, Speaker B: On the downside, I would think it's definitely. I think it's two ish. I mean, depends on. It's always depends on what kind of timeline you use, but it's fairly high. I hear your point, though. We hear your point. The other issue though, that is we ought.
00:35:48.206 - 00:35:49.214, Speaker A: I have one more question.
00:35:49.294 - 00:35:55.714, Speaker B: I just can say the thing that we ought to have is some of the. You remember, Jenny, some of these traders, right? Because liquidity is very thin.
00:35:56.894 - 00:36:01.874, Speaker A: It's thinner. It's thinner. Now that the market makers are all fighting on Twitter, you watching these?
00:36:02.254 - 00:36:20.384, Speaker B: So we're back to, like. We basically are back to like, early days, very limited crypto trading infrastructure and liquidity. And so it takes, you know, these price movements can happen, particularly in the absence of robust liquidity. But anyways, I interrupt that you were saying?
00:36:24.364 - 00:36:37.860, Speaker A: Well, we actually have the infrastructure, unlike last time, we just now don't have the liquidity again, but. Okay, so maker. So let's say you add maker to the list. This is how this conversation started. So you have maker on the list. It's at 1300 today. Let's say you have a price targeted 1000.
00:36:37.860 - 00:36:52.694, Speaker A: Let's say maker hits 1000. Do you buy and let's say you have a mil or a allocate. Um. Do you buy, do you allocate all 100? Do you go $20 for five weeks?
00:36:54.314 - 00:37:13.354, Speaker B: Depends on the magnitude of the drop. Some days, um, you pull the stash fund and, and you, you buy the full, full amount. You like, you. You get filled. Um, but largely, it's. I would probably reserve still some amount. It just depends on the magnitude of the drop.
00:37:13.354 - 00:38:03.174, Speaker B: Um, for me, I always feel comfortable, like, when there is a very big shakeout, I feel comfortable adding in a meaningful way. Historically, I think that's been, you know, served me well. But at times, yeah, you, like, you know, may of 2020, that infamous day, like, ETH went, like, ETH dropped quite a bit and then it rallied a bit, and then it just continued to go down. So you said it before the podcast, you want to catch a falling knife. I don't know. It's impossible, right? But I just feel comfortable adding and lowering my, my cost basis. So I, in this environment, I would want to hold some cash.
00:38:03.174 - 00:38:23.474, Speaker B: I think it's different from an institution. Like if you're a fan. Like most of the most time they're allocated, they want to be fully allocated and holding cash is not something that you kind of do, right. But, but yeah, like, it is also a matter of what percentage of the portfolios is and what percentage of the portfolio do I want it to be pre imposed?
00:38:25.174 - 00:39:11.874, Speaker A: Alright everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new Defi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Bumper alleviates this by allowing you, the user, to lock your tokens into the protocol and set a price. No matter how much the market fluctuates, your investment in your token won't fall below the previous determined value. When you compare this to traditional options platforms, Bumper offers a non custodial and actually cheaper, on average alternative that protects the value of your crypto from market price drops. If you are looking to earn a yield on your crypto, bumper has you covered. By depositing USDC into the bumper protocol, you can earn a return which is derived from the premiums paid by protection.
00:39:11.874 - 00:39:57.484, Speaker A: Buyers, early adopters and empire listeners have a chance to claim a part of the $250,000 early adopter bump rewards. Go check out bumper. It's bumper fi take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. This episode is brought to you by Chronicle Protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data. For anyone who listens to empire a lot, you know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle Protocol is this novel oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for maker and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, super excited to share here that Chronicles Oracle service is now publicly available for anyone to use.
00:39:57.484 - 00:40:41.122, Speaker A: Compared to using other oracle services, Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees. They have an unparalleled level of transparency at Chronicle. They offer a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides, marking this milestone in on chain data availability. Chronicle is endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, Gitcoin, DyDx and Makerdao. It is time for a paradigm shift in oracle development, a future where data is verifiable, operational costs are contained, and the possibilities are immense. You can learn more about Chronicle at chronicle labs.org. That is chronicallabs.org
00:40:41.122 - 00:40:45.774, Speaker A: dot. You want to run through some of the news this week?
00:40:46.074 - 00:40:48.642, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Cool. Let's do it.
00:40:48.778 - 00:40:57.738, Speaker A: Cool. We can go quickly through these. Yeah. Maybe like one takeaway from each story. So first story was blockchain cap raised 580 million.
00:40:57.826 - 00:40:58.782, Speaker B: Pretty impressive.
00:40:58.938 - 00:41:11.486, Speaker A: Yeah, very impressive. So blockchain capital, for those who don't know, is the, the largest running crypto fund, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the, one of the longest. Been around for at least ten years.
00:41:11.510 - 00:41:13.102, Speaker B: One of the longest. Not the largest, actually.
00:41:13.158 - 00:41:15.862, Speaker A: Ten years, 2013. Not the largest, but the longest.
00:41:15.918 - 00:41:16.554, Speaker B: Yes.
00:41:17.734 - 00:41:33.374, Speaker A: Bart and Brad and I think Brock Pierce was one of the third founders as well. But it's really Bart and Brad Stevens. Yeah. They raised. So 580 million. It goes into two funds. There's the fund six, which is their early stage fund, and then what they're calling an opportunity fund, which is the later stage.
00:41:33.374 - 00:41:58.914, Speaker A: Some major institutional investors, a couple of big names, names that were announced, Visa and PayPal. Crypto venture right now is at an all time low. Excuse me. Excuse me. It was a three year low, so lowest it's been since 2020 in terms of capital that's flowing into crypto venture. So this is a huge raise, I would say. Curious if you think the VC climate is changing.
00:41:58.914 - 00:42:08.390, Speaker A: My understanding of like a little bit of the, behind the scenes of this, of this blockchain cap deal was that it was already rate. It's been, maybe this was the second close or.
00:42:08.542 - 00:42:49.000, Speaker B: Yeah, that would, that would actually be great to know because I spoke with this fund of fund funds and I mentioned the prior part and they were like, there's zero interest. So I got to think a lot of the, a lot of the fundraising in funds, not just in crypto, is, as you said, a couple of closes. First close, second close, third close. So I probably been in the market for a long time. Maybe their target was a billion and they raised 500. But these are, I mean, I would love to maybe have the guys on and give us a little bit of inside take on how the process went. And, you know, a lot of, maybe it was, how much of that was existing LP's, recycling capital? How much of that was new LP's? Was those family offices endowments where they come from? You know?
00:42:49.092 - 00:43:15.684, Speaker A: Yeah. Comment on the YouTube video or tweet at us if you want, if you want us to bring on blockchain cap on the pot, if that'd be interesting. Yeah. One other interesting note, and then we can move on from this news, is the late stage investing kind of the series C, series D. So 600 million or five eight. A huge amount of capital. The late stage has been dominated by a couple of small, a couple of very specific firms, like ten t who invested in blockworks.
00:43:15.684 - 00:43:39.260, Speaker A: They've kind of dominated some of the later stage stuff because they can allocate like 100 million, 200 million into a company later stage. Right. Kraken, Gemini Ledger, some of these really large, influential brands where they need. Where they're raising 500 million, the lead has to put in like 200 or 150. And so interesting to see more folks get into that later stage.
00:43:39.412 - 00:43:40.144, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:40.524 - 00:44:04.928, Speaker A: So tough space to play in because you need so much capital, so. All right, next up, PayPal. So Paypal released Pyusd, which is the PayPal stablecoin. They announced that it is going to be available on Venmo. So PayPal owns Venmo. I think they bought them for a pretty cheap, like 26 million. Several years ago, they announced that the PayPal stablecoin is going to be available on Venmo.
00:44:04.928 - 00:44:29.842, Speaker A: Inside of the PayPal ecosystem, there will be no gas or they cover the gas, but user won't see the gas outside of the PayPal network. So. Right, if you have the stable coin on Venmo, you want to send it to a friend on Venmo, no gas. If you want to send it outside, let's say you want to send Py USD from Venmo to your wallet and put it into Aave or something like that, then gas will apply. So.
00:44:29.898 - 00:44:32.294, Speaker B: Yeah, that's huge.
00:44:33.234 - 00:44:55.678, Speaker A: I think I do. I think PayPal is kind of like this big behemoth of a financial services company. Obviously, it's cool to see. I've always thought one of the problems with payments is that there's no interoperability between these brands. I'd like cash app and Venmo. Why can't I move my money between my cash app and my venmo? They don't talk to each other. So this is a cool development to be able to.
00:44:55.678 - 00:45:08.050, Speaker A: If I could send money from Venmo into cash app into Robinhood, into my TD Ameritrade account there, right now, you have to send it almost back into your bank account. Not almost, you have to send it back into your bank account. It's cool if these things all talk to each other.
00:45:08.162 - 00:45:10.894, Speaker B: I mean, plaid in some capacity, but.
00:45:11.474 - 00:45:14.934, Speaker A: Uh, you don't send it to a plaid, though. Plaid. Plaid is the connect.
00:45:15.434 - 00:45:16.250, Speaker B: That's my point.
00:45:16.322 - 00:45:17.178, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:45:17.266 - 00:45:18.602, Speaker B: That's a connected tissue.
00:45:18.738 - 00:45:19.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:20.194 - 00:45:26.862, Speaker B: Like a couple billion dollars. I'm like, guys, you don't need plaid in defi. Everything is. Compatibility is a beautiful thing.
00:45:27.018 - 00:45:48.326, Speaker A: Yeah. Plaid guys. Emery alum, good people. The number to look at is the demand. Demand for Py USD right now, it's a whopping 44 million. So not much demand, I would say. But we will see as we'll pay attention to this number as it goes on venmo, for sure.
00:45:48.326 - 00:45:54.190, Speaker A: Yeah. Other news of the week. What do you got for me?
00:45:54.342 - 00:46:11.642, Speaker B: Well, there's, of course, that huge. What is it? Legal document, dossier, whatever you call it. Uh, that came out detailing a lot of juice behind FTX as it prepares to go to court. Um, you know, detailing a lot of the. Apparently, Sam's parents were heavily. Heavily.
00:46:11.698 - 00:46:13.854, Speaker A: So I didn't, I didn't read this yet. You can.
00:46:14.594 - 00:46:42.254, Speaker B: This is like soap opera thriller. This is your entertainment piece of the week, folks. Uh, you know, I'm waiting for the documentary to come out, like, pretty pronto here, but, yeah. Apparently Sam's parents are very renowned Stanford professors, Barbara and Joseph. I believe they were involved heavily. Apparently. The big realization was they were very involved in the structuring and the operations, some operations of FTX.
00:46:42.254 - 00:46:56.884, Speaker B: The father of Sam, there's some. An exchange between him and Sam, and he was, like, demanding a higher salary raise. He was, like, being paid.
00:46:56.964 - 00:46:58.844, Speaker A: His dad was demanding a higher salary.
00:46:58.884 - 00:47:26.844, Speaker B: From, I think it was being paid, like 117,000 or, like, not like 17,000 a month and say, no, no, I want a million bucks a year and something like that. And so it was like, it's pretty interesting to see it, like, anyways, and then, and then all the donations. And, of course, Stanford is returning, I think, 5 million that was donated from FTX back to the, you know, the, what is it? The trustee or so the folks that are handling the bankruptcy.
00:47:27.944 - 00:47:28.320, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:28.352 - 00:47:35.272, Speaker B: So it was very detailed. I mean, it's a great threads out there. There's like. It's just, it's just shocking, to be honest.
00:47:35.328 - 00:47:35.924, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:37.024 - 00:47:57.254, Speaker B: There's one piece of news, as I heard you say, ledger, that I don't think we covered, but I believe one of the co founders stepped down. But this was, like, a couple weeks ago, September 6, I believe, is when he announced it. And I think a lot of it was just as a result of the social recovery kind of fiasco, if you will, or just kind of drama.
00:47:59.034 - 00:48:37.894, Speaker A: Oh, that's funny. All right. So I clicked this article, the SEO hasn't updated so the Google how it shows up in Google is Ledger co founder bids farewell after recovery fiasco and I click and I click the link and it says Ledger co founder departs to pursue project to onboard more users into crypto. So some editorial brand I won't name change their, change their title. I have actually what I think is probably the biggest news of the week, which is Eclipse. We probably could have started this whole podcast with Eclipse. Eclipse announced that it's launching their SVM ethereum, Celestium l two on mainnet soon.
00:48:37.894 - 00:49:32.196, Speaker A: Let me try to explain this. I think actually folks should listen to Mike other co founder of Blockworks went on bank list and explained how there's these three converging ecosystems with Cosmos and Solana and Ethereum and they're all looking over each other's shoulders saying hey look, I like what you're doing. Let me take a piece of that playbook and pull it over here. One of the problems today is that the single threaded EVM with global fee markets has put ETH l two s at a little bit of a disadvantage to newer alternatives by forcing developers to pursue these app specific EVM chains. You get this isolated block space, but it can really severely fragments ux and liquidity adds a bunch of developer complexity. So Eclipse launched Eclipse's main net. What they say is they leverage the best pieces of the modular stack.
00:49:32.196 - 00:50:38.230, Speaker A: So what they're doing is they're using ETH, they're using Ethereum for settlement, they're using the Solana VM virtual machine, the SVM for parallel execution. They're using Celestia for data availability, and they're using risk zero for ZK fraud proofs. It's pretty interesting to see this settlement is on Ethereum uses ETH as the gas token is on execution, uses the SVM, which enables write paralyzed transaction execution, greater throughput data availability is provided by Celestia, offers higher bandwidth than Ethereum's DA, and then proving is using risk zero for ZK proofs. EVM compatibility is done using the neon EVM which allows for right, like I think my understanding is really easy deployment of EVM smart contracts on eclipse. So this is kind of what we're seeing here is like the best pieces of all of the modular stacks coming together. Been interesting to see the takes have been all over the place, I think, right. Some people are saying ETH killer, some people are saying long soul, some people are saying soul is dead because of this.
00:50:38.230 - 00:50:56.254, Speaker A: Some people are saying, look, because of this news, it's clear ETH is eating the world. Solana tech is eating the world. Huge wins for l two s, bad for l two s. Some think this is bullish for Solana. Some people think it's not. I'd be very curious. I can get into more of the details of this news if you want, but would also be curious just to hear your thoughts on this.
00:50:56.374 - 00:51:01.674, Speaker B: I don't, first of all, I don't think it's negative like an ETH killer. It's just. Why would it be an ETH killer?
00:51:02.614 - 00:51:05.270, Speaker A: I just saw some dumb tweets. I would.
00:51:05.462 - 00:51:08.134, Speaker B: Yeah. I was like, no, yeah, it's very.
00:51:08.174 - 00:51:14.606, Speaker A: Interesting how obviously, obviously, it's obviously not an ETH killer. The mainnet settles to ethereum uses.
00:51:14.670 - 00:51:17.510, Speaker B: It's the same people that say the l two s are, like, cannibalistic l.
00:51:17.542 - 00:51:28.360, Speaker A: One, the SBM for scalability. Right. It's basically saying we want to use the SVM for scalability, but we really want to leverage the security and the network security Ethereum. So let's do that.
00:51:28.512 - 00:51:52.906, Speaker B: I'm actually really encouraged by this because I think from assuming that you don't lose efficiency or the connectivity actually works by pulling and using the picking and choosing the best kind of parts of the stack to leverage for aggregate execution. I think it's a. I mean, it intuitively, and I admittedly haven't looked too deeply into it. It makes a lot of sense.
00:51:53.050 - 00:51:53.610, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:53.722 - 00:52:22.644, Speaker B: The real, probably the, the critics might say, well, um, the execute, there's a trade off by doing that relative to a monolithic structure or a. I don't know, like. And so I'd be curious, maybe Mike or some other folks can, can have a more informed opinion on, on how that execution by, by doing all kind of this picking. Choosing of the best parts of the stack compares to like a, what would you say? Like a monolithic architecture.
00:52:25.344 - 00:52:27.880, Speaker A: That would be the. I mean, without.
00:52:28.032 - 00:52:49.922, Speaker B: I mean, I'm sure there's other comparisons you can make, but, but, like, you, you see what I'm saying? You would compare it against not using kind of the best of all worlds and, and seeing, you know, how that compares from a fee, from an latency, secure aggregate security standpoint, whatnot. But, you know, I think it's very encouraging.
00:52:50.098 - 00:53:08.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think. I think that. I think the fud on Twitter was probably due to everything in crypto has had to either be good for Ethereum or good for Solana or good for something else, and then that inherently means it's bad for someone else and stupid.
00:53:08.122 - 00:53:08.986, Speaker B: Or in Los mentality.
00:53:09.050 - 00:53:28.150, Speaker A: Good. Yeah, this is good for both parties. I don't know. I think it's really cool. It's the first SVm roll up on Ethereum. I'll go back to Mike's conversation. He said soon it's going to be possible for an application to be built using the Solana virtual machine, using Celestia for data availability, and settling everything back onto the best security, which is Ethereum.
00:53:28.150 - 00:53:30.794, Speaker A: And that's what you're seeing literally in real time right now.
00:53:31.214 - 00:53:48.532, Speaker B: I remember folks have a short memory in crypto, but this was like L2s and breaking composable. Breaking composability was probably the buzzword of Def con in Osaka. This was before any l two launched.
00:53:48.588 - 00:53:49.908, Speaker A: What, what was composability?
00:53:49.996 - 00:53:51.196, Speaker B: Breaking composability.
00:53:51.340 - 00:53:52.332, Speaker A: Breaking composability.
00:53:52.388 - 00:53:59.460, Speaker B: This was like a thing. This was names of panels, people were talking about it. This is like, it's gonna really detract from the value proposition of a theory.
00:53:59.492 - 00:53:59.612, Speaker A: I'm.
00:53:59.628 - 00:54:30.734, Speaker B: And Defi is gonna break. This is peak Defi, right. Or default is really taking off. And look, I'm not technical to understand how the Internet developed, but my hunch was that the Internet kind of went through this problem too, of latency. And I asked the question to someone, it's like, that was like James Prestwitch or some, like something that I think is very smart to say, didn't the Internet kind of go through this? And it's not so much that you're going to break. Composability is kind of a bad term. It's just you're going to degrade composability.
00:54:30.734 - 00:55:26.314, Speaker B: You're going to like, it's a latency thing. And shouldn't we be focusing on improving latency? Like, or you can never improve it. Like, it's just, you break in, that's it. And I always felt in my uneducated mind, technical mind, that we should probably focus more on thinking about ways and use cases that not all use cases require the same level of atomicity and execution, number one. So you could have different roll ups and then you can, you can trade latency for lower costs, you know, I mean, like if you're, if you're playing a game and you're, you don't need to settle that instantaneously, you don't. Using a flash loan for Defi. Yeah, you're probably going to do that in the l one because you're probably seeing some crazy arb and you're sloshing around millions to clip a, you know, some sort of, you know, close the gap and profit.
00:55:26.314 - 00:56:11.044, Speaker B: And it's an economic decision that is very clear to use the much more expensive highway that you're going to pay for. But you can use the non highway, non toll route and pay a lower fee and use, you know, l two because you don't care so much about this, like, composability. You don't care as much about, you know, atomic execution. And a lot of the folks that I talked to back then in Osaka, this was like five years ago, like pre COVID were of the mind that, yeah, we probably should think about that connective tissue between all these different chains. And I think that's. That's what you're seeing unfold now. Like, there is a lot of tech.
00:56:11.044 - 00:56:42.090, Speaker B: It is. There are so many different use cases. Like gaming requires different security than DeFi, than NFTs, than other potential use cases. And I think over time, the connectivity between chains is going to improve dramatically. And there's going to be a huge opportunity for a relayer, for instance, to. In the same way that you can do the instant checkout, instant when you're in Venmo, I think there's an ability to bring the money back to your bank account. Right.
00:56:42.090 - 00:56:54.260, Speaker B: And you can do instant, and it charges you 5%. You can wait two, three days, and it doesn't charge you. Same thing. Same thing. It's a. It's a priority fee model. This.
00:56:54.260 - 00:57:21.154, Speaker B: Why. And the gas, the way we think about gas, which is one of the things that I really like about Solana, is this dynamic gas that really is much more flexible. It's much more interesting and how things actually like, it's a market, but having a flat gas is really difficult when you think about all the different kind of varying use cases. But when you have a dynamic gas model, I think it's much more interesting. But we're getting. I suspect we're going deep in the rabbit hole. But.
00:57:21.154 - 00:57:25.790, Speaker B: But, yeah, a lot to talk about, I think. Yeah, I think it's a good place to end.
00:57:25.942 - 00:57:29.478, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed, man. I just. Mike's walking into the room.
00:57:29.566 - 00:57:34.054, Speaker B: I also probably saw Mike kicking you out of the room, so Mike. Mike's to blame here, folks.
00:57:34.214 - 00:57:36.474, Speaker A: Thanks to blank, we could have just.
00:57:36.534 - 00:57:39.042, Speaker B: The reason why we're not leaking Alpha is because, you know, Mike just, you.
00:57:39.058 - 00:57:47.690, Speaker A: Know, just can't give that to Mike. Can't give that to Mike. Here. Last. Last thing. Last interesting thing we won't talk about. I'll just leave it in people's heads is, uh.
00:57:47.690 - 00:58:01.098, Speaker A: I feel like you're seeing all these Alt l one s that haven't taken off recently. Go become l two s on ethereum, like Kanto just did. This cello is becoming l two on ethereum. Interesting to see. Yeah.
00:58:01.226 - 00:58:06.874, Speaker B: Hey, I want to get your thoughts next episode on the real world Asset summit. Didn't you go to that one?
00:58:06.994 - 00:58:07.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I did go to that one.
00:58:08.026 - 00:58:13.802, Speaker B: All right, well, we will spare you two episodes in a row because we talked about real world assets on the prior.
00:58:13.858 - 00:58:31.534, Speaker A: It was really good. Do you know that there's a RWA? There's a. All right, so there's a company called figure, which was Mike Cagney's company figure said that, hey, look, we can bring our costs of settling loans down by, like, 80% to 90% if we put it on the blockchain.
00:58:32.244 - 00:58:34.144, Speaker B: We were investors of parafire.
00:58:34.804 - 00:58:43.988, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Okay, so that was, like, five years ago. They said that then they're going public. Key locks and key locks. Exactly. Exactly. So they had to spin out their blockchain.
00:58:43.988 - 00:58:59.196, Speaker A: They called it around. They've been around the game, so they spun it out. They will do $30 billion on chain this year. And the flow is basically, users get a heloc from figure. Figure puts that on provenance.
00:58:59.260 - 00:59:00.748, Speaker B: Provenance was a blockchain.
00:59:00.876 - 00:59:06.802, Speaker A: Provenance is the blockchain. And they, on the other side of that, it's like Apollo and KKR, and.
00:59:06.818 - 00:59:09.010, Speaker B: They'Ve been streamlining costs in the back end.
00:59:09.042 - 00:59:12.774, Speaker A: And I met the CEO of provenance at RWA. I was like, that's pretty interesting.
00:59:13.434 - 00:59:47.050, Speaker B: This is a beautiful place to end because when people question the use cases and that this tech is not being used, it's not so much that it's not. It's just, you haven't heard of it. And that's the state we're on crypto. Because you feel that you're getting fed all the information in crypto, Twitter, you feel all very empowered and smart because you're looking at friend tech and you're in the cool tech, but there's a lot of boring stuff happening behind the scenes like this. And. And I think it's very encouraging. Like, the cost savings are there, the use case is there, and it just makes sense.
00:59:47.122 - 00:59:49.282, Speaker A: Like, good place to answer.
00:59:49.338 - 01:00:00.818, Speaker B: Absolutely. Anyways, folks, have a great weekend, and we'll see you here next week. I am being more active on the. On the comments on YouTube. Like, I'm more active on YouTube than I am on.
01:00:00.866 - 01:00:02.402, Speaker A: More active, more obsessed.
01:00:02.458 - 01:00:13.154, Speaker B: I'm more active. I'm actually not on frantic, folks. I am active on YouTube. So, you know, go drop us a comment there. I'll be. I'll be lurking in the comment section.
01:00:13.534 - 01:00:15.246, Speaker A: You gotta respond to these. The reason I.
01:00:15.350 - 01:00:16.078, Speaker B: Wait a minute.
01:00:16.206 - 01:00:16.914, Speaker A: Wait.
01:00:17.414 - 01:00:27.534, Speaker B: No, no. I'm gonna interrupt here because I remember, thanks to one of our listeners who posted on YouTube, who reminded me of the bet that we had made of who had the most follow.
01:00:27.614 - 01:00:29.534, Speaker A: This was not. This is not a real bet.
01:00:29.614 - 01:00:56.206, Speaker B: Listen, we have our witness, Joseph here, who's our fantastic producer in the back end. He does fantastic work. He also confirmed this. Yano said that he would shave his head if he had less users than I did upon permissionless. That was the case, folks. So one of the other, or he shaves, and then he just kind of, like, comes on bald, which I think might be the reignition of a true bull market. We need that bald energy.
01:00:56.206 - 01:00:57.550, Speaker B: Like, you know, Brian harmonious kind of.
01:00:57.582 - 01:00:58.950, Speaker A: We do need that. Bald is back.
01:00:58.982 - 01:01:23.294, Speaker B: Baby's back. I'm not. I never gonna do it, because first of all, I would never make a bet that I would not win. I've lost many bets in my life. But more importantly, we could also livestream it. So if you want us to live stream Yano, like, it'll be kind of nice if you're being shaped like. Like, just like, Mike can do it or someone can do it, and then we talk about crypto while we're.
01:01:23.294 - 01:01:24.430, Speaker B: While we're doing that.
01:01:24.582 - 01:01:25.606, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:01:25.710 - 01:01:48.222, Speaker B: That would, like, be like, I would be willing to do a double or nothing where that might be the most viewed episode of Empire if we'd live stream you being like, you know, your shave, like, being, you know, I think that would be the most viewed episode. I'm going to go double or nothing on that, excluding Eric Bor. He's like, you know, permissionless.
01:01:48.278 - 01:01:49.574, Speaker A: We're rapping. I'm over time.
01:01:49.654 - 01:01:54.154, Speaker B: All right, folks. Okay, time to cut it out. See you here's next week. Have a great weekend.
