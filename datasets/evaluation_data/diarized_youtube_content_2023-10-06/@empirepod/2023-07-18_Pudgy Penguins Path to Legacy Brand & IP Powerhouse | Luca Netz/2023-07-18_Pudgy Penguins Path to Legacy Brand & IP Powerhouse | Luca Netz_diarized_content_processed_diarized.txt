00:00:00.280 - 00:00:34.858, Speaker A: At the bottom of my funnel is my 8888 1st edition Pudgy Penguin Ethereum NFTs. That is the first edition and the origin story of my entire company and my entire business. It is the asset that gives you utility and access that no other asset in our business gives you. It is the asset that allows you to monetize and be a part of the growth. Right? Because every product and every piece of content that we make, we actually license the NFT from the. From the collection and make products out of that. And so you can make monies on royalties.
00:00:34.858 - 00:00:42.614, Speaker A: That is the nucleus and where all value, in my opinion, has to accrue if this is really going to win.

Welcome back to another episode of Empire.
00:01:23.946 - 00:01:35.210, Speaker B: We are here with Luca. I hope you guys are watching this one on YouTube, because Luca's looking as ridiculous and decked out as possible today. So, Luca, man, you. You got your bull market, your bull market fit on today, huh?
00:01:35.322 - 00:01:38.002, Speaker A: Dude, I'm proliferating, man. I'm proliferating.
00:01:38.178 - 00:02:08.290, Speaker B: Well, we got little nouns, we got a little penguins. I love it. We usually don't talk about people's background going in these conversations, but I was doing a little research for this episode. You got a pretty wild story, man. Like, high school dropout packing boxes at ring the, like, doorbell company early days get asked to, like, jump up onto the engineering team. It sounded like maybe you can just, like, I don't know, maybe we could start there with. With just your early days and the early story and, like, how you kind of turned into who you are today, if that works for you.
00:02:08.402 - 00:02:29.892, Speaker A: Yeah. In hindsight, it definitely is a cool story. I didn't really realize it until I started speaking it in web three, and then everyone's like, dude, the story's pretty badass. And I was like, oh, shit. I didn't even realize it, but the story is kind of badass. The 62nd version is. Grew up homeless with my mom for ten years, 14 different places bouncing around guest bedroom, my guest bedroom, couch to couch.
00:02:29.892 - 00:02:49.534, Speaker A: We weren't homeless, like, pushing a cart, but we didn't really have our own home. And whoever would take us in and let us stay for an extended period of time was kind of. We were nomads, to say the least. We settled down when I was a teenager in Los Angeles. Went to Fairfax High school, went to a couple different high schools, actually. I was a bad kid. Super skateboarder, degenerate.
00:02:49.534 - 00:03:14.250, Speaker A: Just smoking weed with my friends. Way too young to be smoking weed, skateboarding, doing the whole spiel. Then I went to Fairfax, dropped out of Fairfax. Mom was still struggling to pay the bills. A couple really big moments that led me to that decision. I won't dive into it, but I was old enough to work, and so I decided to join the workforce. I took 100 resumes, went up and down Fairfax and melrose, handing them out.
00:03:14.250 - 00:03:40.854, Speaker A: Didn't find any luck. Took my tail to tech row in Santa Monica. I went to the shittiest office on the row, which if you know tech row and you know Santa Monica, you know, ring doorbells. First office was very much that. It was a shack amongst a bunch of titans and giants and amazing buildings, and it had this little rinkety ding shack that they had going on. I got a job packing boxes. I was one of their first people back packing boxes.
00:03:40.854 - 00:04:13.834, Speaker A: One of their early employees. Saw that business basically go from idea or new iteration, from door bot to ring, and just saw that thing basically scale from a group of 2025 of us to 1000 people, 500 people by the time I left. I started my first direct to consumer business when I was 18. Sold that business for quite a bit of money when I was 19. That kind of put me on the paradigm of like, hey, life changing money. Started a couple companies, all of which were really successful. Notable big wins was as the CMO.
00:04:13.834 - 00:04:35.290, Speaker A: Von Dutch brought them back pretty much from the dead, which was a big moment in 2020. And then was the CMO and biggest investor at the time for a company called Gel Blaster, which ended up being North America's fastest growing toy company and honestly, just a complete nerf killer. And so that led me and gave me the confidence to come into pudgy penguins. And we're trying to go three for three here.
00:04:35.442 - 00:05:02.484, Speaker B: There we go. I love it, man. All right, so take us back to April 2022, because I kind of followed the pudgy story from early days, and it was in shambles, I would call it. I think that's a fair thing to say. And you came in April 2022. I think it's fair to say pudgy penguins felt kind of dead in the water as a project, and you bought them for, I think it was 750 ETH at the time, which roughly two and a half.
00:05:02.604 - 00:05:03.704, Speaker A: Two and a half million?
00:05:05.204 - 00:05:10.788, Speaker B: Yeah, so, yeah, exactly. So what gave you that conviction to buy penguins for two and a half million bucks?
00:05:10.876 - 00:05:11.156, Speaker A: I think.
00:05:11.180 - 00:05:15.424, Speaker B: And what does that even mean, by the way, to buy? Do you buy? You're buying the company behind.
00:05:15.724 - 00:05:36.540, Speaker A: There was no company. So we bought a bunch of assets, like 60 different assets, even some of the previous teams, as social media accounts. So anything and everything under the sun. This wasn't a, you know, there hadn't been a deal like this that had been done before, so it's kind of historic in its own right. So there really was no case law or deal to kind of reference. We kind of constructed. Constructed it, which is one of the reasons why it took a little bit longer than I wanted to.
00:05:36.540 - 00:06:05.464, Speaker A: I think we got the bid accepted in December and didn't go through until April. So it was a rough ride to get the deal done, to say the least. Why? I think if you believe in NFTs and you believe in digital collectibles and you're me, then it seemed like an obvious purchase. I thought two and a half million dollars was incredibly cheap, figuring the business had netted $7 million in six months prior. So if to you just do the math on like a PE multiple or like a traditional acquisition, it was like an obvious acquisition.
00:06:06.004 - 00:06:08.812, Speaker B: Do you feel like the business had done 7 million revenue or to the.
00:06:08.828 - 00:06:40.816, Speaker A: Bottom line, $7 million profit? All said and done, after all expenses, give or take. There really was no expenses in their business prior to that. I mean, they had a couple employees, but they pretty much were just taking revenue and dividing it amongst themselves with their respective percentages and breaking bread that way. So $7 million, let's call it seven and a half million dollars gross, $7 million net in six months. You buy that business for two and a half million dollars because it's a distressed asset. I actually was ready to pay seven and a half. That was my top offer.
00:06:40.816 - 00:07:34.744, Speaker A: I just hit them with my first low ball, which was two and a half, and they took it. Why? I think if you look under the hood and if you believe in NFTs and you believe in PFPs and you believe them to be the future of IP and the future of brands, which I think there's a really strong argument that they are, then two and a half million dollars for a pudgy penguin, which basically, if you really understand what makes an NFT project successful, there are certain ingredients. And pudgy penguins had all of those ingredients, had a die hard community, had an affluent community, right? Like, there's people own pudgy penguins who you can never buy, you can never fundraise and get these people on board or pay them to buy your project. They're just either in it or they're not. The IP was clearly magical. People were buying the pudgy penguin not because of any future utility, or because there was tokens coming or some sort of ponzi nomic North Star. They were buying it because they loved the penguin and people loved the penguin.
00:07:34.744 - 00:08:19.850, Speaker A: The penguin personally made me feel something. I don't know what it was, but there was a phenomenon that every time I scrolled through my opensea, the penguin always made me feel even just 1% better. And I started to notice that and identify that. And I thought that was magic. You either have it or you don't. And then you kind of just put all of these things like the historical significance, right? One of the first early PFP projects, probably the leader in QTIP on the blockchain, which QTIP is the total addressable, has the highest tam out of any of the ips in the space. You look at the fact that it was printed in the New York Times, all over CNBC, on Today show, and all of these major news networks, that's two and a half million dollars in marketing alone and brand awareness alone, right? You just like, add all the pieces together and the facets together and you're just like, dude, $7.5
00:08:19.850 - 00:09:01.540, Speaker A: million was more than the max that I could afford, but I probably would have paid 15 for it if I had more money. And so two and a half is the offer they took. I thought it was a screaming deal. I thought everybody was in the space at the time that was building in the space that had the money to buy it, that didn't miss out on a generational opportunity because it was a no brainer acquisition if you really understood it. We basically took over the business April 2022. No money in the bank. Bootstrapped it for about the first twelve months, raised around, and I think we've put on a masterclass in NFT brand building and what it means to be the next iteration of ip in the world, leveraging NFT technology and web three community.
00:09:01.732 - 00:09:09.424, Speaker B: Nice, man. Did you buy it? I don't know if this is too personal question to ask, but did you raise the run first then you bought it. Did you buy it with cash? Did you get.
00:09:10.124 - 00:09:34.184, Speaker A: We bought it with our own money. So I spent the majority, but then the other people on the C level suite basically all put their own money. How the story went was the opportunity came. I made a couple phone calls. I had a couple of big wins under my belt prior. So people, when I call people with an opportunity, they tend to listen. And I basically said, I think this is a generational, once in a lifetime opportunity.
00:09:34.184 - 00:10:06.230, Speaker A: I want you to buy in. The business has no money, so I won't be able to pay you a salary, but I want you to stop everything that you're doing and just devote your life to this. Thankfully, every single person that I spoke to and had that conversation with said they wanted in, and it's been a wild ride ever since. But for the first nine months, nobody on the c level team was getting paid. They all were working for free. And they actually spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own money to be in the position to work for free for this company to build this brand, which is like, if you people understand that story and ever thought we were going to fail, has, like, another coming.
00:10:06.382 - 00:10:25.886, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um. Man, that's funny. So the backstory of this episode, I don't know if I told you this, but, uh, so mike, you did this, like, road to permissionless, like, twitter spaces with, uh, the bankless guys. Then I wasn't able to make it. But Mike, the other blockworks co founder and, uh, you know, Mike's about as, like, bearish on some of these. Basically bear it.
00:10:25.886 - 00:11:00.412, Speaker B: Not bearish nfts, but bearish NFT business models as you can possibly get. Um, and I think it comes from some personal experience that we've had. And, uh, he gets off that thing, gives me a call, he goes, man, this Luca guy just red pilled me as basically as hard as I've ever been red pilled on. Not just nfts, but penguins and the business behind these. So maybe we can get into the business model of nfts and really just the business model of pudgies. What was the business model of pudgies before you acquired them? And how are you changing that? And, yeah, maybe we could start with that.
00:11:00.468 - 00:11:35.724, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the business model prior was, hey, create hype, tell a narrative, hope people believe that narrative. Mint a collection, make an exorbitant amount of money for little to no effort on royalties, and make and pray that your floor price goes higher so you can release a secondary collection and make even more money. And hope that collection goes in the money, and then you can do a third collection. And hopefully, if God is on your side and the market is on your side, you could come out of there with $100 million. You know, being relatively an amateur in entrepreneurship, I think was probably the business model before.
00:11:36.104 - 00:11:40.752, Speaker B: I think the business model was mints and royalties. Basically, that's, that's been the business model.
00:11:40.808 - 00:12:14.028, Speaker A: Mints and royalties, yeah, just, just make digital things. It's a very simple and easy business model. Made a lot of people really wealthy who probably wouldn't have made that wealth any other way. But I think it's since transition, the bear market has humbled that business model. I knew coming into this that I needed to make real money in the real world. Just my tip for entrepreneurs listening to be a good entrepreneur is to control your own destiny. When you're making a business that's dependent on outside variables, you can't control, that is ethereum royalties or ethereum volatility, then you do not control your own destiny and you don't really have a business.
00:12:14.028 - 00:12:54.040, Speaker A: And so I knew this. I look at royalties as EBITDA patters, kind of the cherry on top of thing that makes your books look good at the end of the year. That kind of covers your margin, maybe allows you to take a little more risk, but it is not the core revenue driver and it is not the thing thats going to take you where you need to be. Very early on, we knew we needed to create real products. We needed to transcend outside of this eco chamber and outside of this ecosystem. The first step for that, looking at the pudgy penguin IP and coming from the toy business. Right before in gel Blaster, I was like, well, toys, plushies, collectibles, high end figurines, is the first direction that were going to, that was our approach.
00:12:54.040 - 00:13:39.142, Speaker A: I think that model allows a lot of flexibility and adds a huge safety net for our collectors. The biggest blue chip killer in the NFT space has been diluting supply when there's not enough demand. And so very much like a physical product. Why is a one of one Picasso worth $10 million versus a Picasso print of 250 worth 10,000? Because one is 250 and then another is the original and the one of one. The same principle applies to these digital products. And actually I think hyper applies because it's so transparent and the liquidity migrates in so many different tides that you can see pretty early on if something's going to go kaput or not. And so this dependency on minting and making new collections was either derived from two things.
00:13:39.142 - 00:14:18.374, Speaker A: One, greed, which you can't really control. People are going to be greedy. Or second, the inability to make money elsewhere and needing to sustain the business and knowing the only way to make money was through mints, because they had been rewarded for that behavior in the past. They continue to do it, which ultimately crushes the entire business. And so, you know, when people think toys, well, how does toys make sense? Well, I would argue it gives me the safety net to actually build a long term digital collectible that will accrue real value, because I'm not diluting my digital supply with endless mints because I'm self sustaining. And then I would also argue that it grows my top of the funnel. It creates more emotional attachment between holder and family and friend.
00:14:18.374 - 00:14:50.696, Speaker A: It creates more awareness on different shelves, on your favorite retailers, and on commercials and ad spots that you otherwise wouldn't have done if you just sold a digital collectible all day. And then just gives us a better moat to actually succeed long term. The nature of our deal was very much positioned for long term thinking, because we bought this thing for two and a half million bucks. It's not like I can just jump ship a year later and go on to the next thing, no matter how much money I have. Two and a half million dollars is no small amount, and you got it. And of, you committed money to something. And I really put my reputation on the line on this one.
00:14:50.696 - 00:15:16.164, Speaker A: And so, all things considered, that's kind of our business model with our toys. Obviously, the depth of what we want to do is a lot bigger and grander than that. But that was really our first step coming into this, was how do we become self sustaining? How do we control our destiny? And how do we ultimately create products and experiences that people love, that other people can enjoy, without having to pay $10,000 for an Internet JPEG.
00:15:16.704 - 00:15:54.898, Speaker B: Hmm. All right, so once you make that decision to get into the, into the toy business, which obviously, it sounds like you were pretty familiar with that business, I feel like there's one, a decision that had to be made, which is, do we sell toys to the. To the world? Do we become a toy company? Or do we basically sell, do what has kind of existed, which is like, we'll give our existing community almost like token walled toys, we give it away for free. And that drives the price of these, of these pudgies higher? Or do we get into the toy business and just sell toys like a normal toy company and pudgies, because toys are proliferating around the world, the value of pudgies gets higher. How do you think about, like, how did you think about that decision?
00:15:55.066 - 00:17:38.148, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think just proliferation, how I look at it is just like a funnel, right? So at the bottom of my funnel is my 8888 1st edition Pudgy Penguin Ethereum NFTs. That is the first edition and the origin story of my entire company and my entire business. It is the asset that gives you utility and access that no other asset in our business gives you. It is the asset that allows you to monetize and be a part of the growth, right? Because every product and every piece of content that we make, we actually license the NFT from the, from the collection and make products out of that. And so you can make monies on royalties, right? Like that is the nucleus and where all value, in my opinion, has to accrue if this is really going to win. And so when you're thinking about proliferation and expanding, right, really what I need to focus on is this top of the funnel, right? Because the broader this top of the funnel, the more people that love this pudgy penguin character, the more people that wake up and enjoy the product or the content every single day, the more people that are familiar with it, right? When the tides of the NFT narrative and FOMO kick back in, because the NFT market is very cycle oriented, the same way that a coin market is or the stock market is, when that cycle comes back and people are starting to collect nfts, they're probably going to migrate to the one that they're most familiar with or the one that's proven themselves, the one that is tangible and the one that feels real. And then by that time, I plan to have the most followers and the most views and the most impressions and the most retail sales and the best partnerships and the best collaborations when that time comes.
00:17:38.148 - 00:18:04.910, Speaker A: And then you just become the obvious first choice because you've, you've done it, you've proliferated. And so my, my job right now is just how do I create product and content that people love and how to just grow that top of the funnel? I'm not selling them on nfts right now. I'm not selling them on web three. I'm really selling them on a cute, iconic, prolific, pudgy penguin character, which I believe is the best penguin ever drawn. People love penguins. People love arctic animals. We will be the face for that.
00:18:04.910 - 00:19:09.872, Speaker A: And that's really where I'm going. And we're really a brand for young people, you know, middle aged people and older people. Like, it's a complete nucleus of, like, do you believe in this ethos? Do you believe in this vision of a character that's here to make you smile, to make you feel good? Do you want to support that? Because that character supports you? And I think ultimately, it trickles down. In the first edition, the NFT is a better collectible, right? It is better than a Pokemon card. It is better than anything out there. And so if you can even capture 10% or 15% or 20% of the awareness of a Pokemon, per se, I would argue the first edition nfts, because of the non factor of inauthenticity issues, the non factor of spoofing, the complete clarity on quantity and rarity, the no friction of buying and selling, which is the nature of the NFT. I would argue that all you need is 10% of the awareness that Pokemon has for your first editions, which in this case is our pudgy penguin NFT to be worth more than first edition Pokemon cards, because the scalability of the NFT just removes all the friction.
00:19:09.872 - 00:19:15.284, Speaker A: Right. It just makes it so much more tradable. Sorry for the monologue, but I hope that paints a pretty clear picture.
00:19:16.104 - 00:19:33.154, Speaker B: It does paint a clear picture. And as you were monologuing there, I actually looked to my left. I just realized this. I swear to you, I did not set this up. I have not many things on my desk. I do have this cute little penguin Lego, though, and the reason I have is because penguins are fucking cute. So.
00:19:33.694 - 00:19:34.310, Speaker A: And this is.
00:19:34.342 - 00:19:34.870, Speaker B: This is the thing.
00:19:34.902 - 00:19:45.254, Speaker A: This is an interesting one. I hate to interrupt, but people like when you're just looking at, like, okay, what? Why does this matter? People love penguins. Do not underestimate the love for certain animals. People love penguins.
00:19:45.374 - 00:19:51.686, Speaker B: This thing is so cute. There's a penguin skating around. It's got a little skates on. It's a cute thing. And so what's the top of the funnel? Or. Go ahead.
00:19:51.710 - 00:20:07.630, Speaker A: Go ahead and you fact check it. But this is the best. They've made penguins ugly, historically. Why? I don't know. Penguins are cute. This is the cutest penguin ever made. And I can tell you this as somebody's went through all the penguin ips, the top of the funnel for me is touch points, views, impressions, and followers.
00:20:07.630 - 00:20:17.782, Speaker A: That's how I quantify it. Right? Like, we have five. We have 6 billion views in our giphy, right? Touchpoint one, we get, you know, 50 million accounts reaching our instagram every single month.
00:20:17.838 - 00:20:18.086, Speaker B: Touch.
00:20:18.110 - 00:20:26.650, Speaker A: .2. We get 5 million accounts reaching our Twitter every single month. Touch .3 I'm in. You know, at the end of the year, I'll be in 5000 retail stores around the country.
00:20:26.722 - 00:20:26.946, Speaker B: Touch.
00:20:26.970 - 00:20:44.214, Speaker A: .4 if I just get to seven touch points, then I'm a legitimate brand. And if they love the product and I can do it consistently, then I'm on the path to being a legacy brand. Right. And so for me, it's just top of the funnel is just knowing and loving. Right. When you think penguin, do you think pudgy penguins? Right.
00:20:44.214 - 00:20:56.244, Speaker A: If I can accomplish that, I've won. It's easier said than done, though. Again, it's like, if it was so easy to do, it'd be done. But, you know, we're in. We're working in that direction and slowly but surely getting there.
00:20:56.744 - 00:21:08.768, Speaker B: You guys have. I had, I had. I don't follow you guys. You guys have 683,000 followers on Instagram. This is nuts. I would encourage people to pull this up, spreading good vibes and positivity. Wait, so are these videos or these pics? Oh, these are.
00:21:08.768 - 00:21:17.746, Speaker B: I see what you're going for. These are cute. And these go. These go viral. Outside of just, wow, this one got 15,000 likes. This is nuts. That's crazy.
00:21:17.746 - 00:21:29.654, Speaker B: So these not, wow, 48,000 likes. That's not. So you guys are reaching a damn. This video got 109,000 likes. I haven't seen this. I should have researched this before. So you guys are reaching a completely non crypto audience with this.
00:21:29.654 - 00:21:35.702, Speaker B: Basically, this is like you're a toy brand selling toys. You're building a big top of funnel. Yeah.
00:21:35.838 - 00:22:01.804, Speaker A: It's just the character. Right. It's just like, how do you get the pudgy penguin to transcend? And the video after the one with 109,000 likes is a million likes. Right. And so, like, how do you really just, again, just create a character? Yeah. Yeah. How do you create a character that people love and they know and they identify and resonate with? And then as long as you have that familiarity, you can push them in any direction that they want.
00:22:01.804 - 00:22:32.166, Speaker A: But the problem is with NFTs today is everyone's trying to force them into a crypto blockchain web three Nft narrative. What people don't really understand is crypto blockchain NFTs, web three. That's the back end. It is not the front end. It is not the selling point. It is the biggest mistake out of all of these major web three crypto blockchain oriented brands is everybody's trying to sell them the front end. As if it's really just a back end that's not a front end.
00:22:32.166 - 00:22:59.264, Speaker A: And so that's the play that I'm taking. Right? Like what people don't know. Just to give you some context, you know? Because I think this is really important. Every toy that we sell comes with a birth certificate. And on that birth certificate there's a QR code. And on that QR code, it basically allows you to sign up via an email and a password to create your own pudgy world account. And that pudgy World account basically is a custody wallet solution that you basically stand up via an email and a password.
00:22:59.264 - 00:23:45.916, Speaker A: When you redeem the code that you were given after you sign up from your purchase of your dollar ten toy, you unlock a trade box that gives you four nfts via gasless experience for free. That's how I onboard people. I onboard people by selling $10 toys that has a QR code and a birth certificate that points you to make a blockchain wallet without you knowing and giving you your first NFT and digital collectible at zero cost to you. We cover the gas and all of a sudden you're having fun. You're digitally collecting, but you don't even know it's an NFT. And slowly but surely, you're becoming familiar with the habits of what it is to digitally collect, which is no different than, you know, collecting Fortnite skins or, you know, attachments on your gun and call of duty. And you're just programming them to be familiar with these type of behaviors and this type of flow.
00:23:45.916 - 00:24:43.406, Speaker A: And so like, people are like, well, why is your toy such a big deal? Why was it so meaningful? Well, dude, I'm not only bringing NFT IP to the real world, right? Because this character that you see on your screen is actually an NFT that is owned by one of our holders. And every time one of this toy sells, he gets a royalty in perpetuity that gets paid out annually. So not only are we telling the story of NFT IP and the story of web three brand building, which is really what that relationship is, we're also telling the story of bringing NFT technology to the hands of everyday people. Because when somebody walks down the shelf of your favorite retail store this quarter four, and they pick up a pudgy penguin and they follow the steps and the instructions in the box, they will have a blockchain wallet within five minutes of them opening up this toy. And that's mass adoption, that's proliferation, that's pushing the boundaries, that's a forward facing consumer product. That's the difference between us and what everybody else is doing. Everybody's looking inwards and we're looking outwards.
00:24:43.406 - 00:24:49.354, Speaker A: And that's why I'm so passionate that we are going to win and that we are going to be the number one. Cause I think nobody else is really doing it like we're doing it.
00:24:50.094 - 00:24:57.074, Speaker B: Luca, man, you got the confidence. That's for sure. I like it. How much have you studied club. Club Penguin? You remember that game?
00:24:57.814 - 00:25:01.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I've talked to, I've talked to the founders multiple times now.
00:25:01.294 - 00:25:08.074, Speaker B: They had a nice legs. $350 million or something with another 300 of bonuses.
00:25:08.114 - 00:25:08.618, Speaker A: 700.
00:25:08.666 - 00:25:09.098, Speaker B: 700.
00:25:09.146 - 00:25:09.434, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:09.474 - 00:25:26.494, Speaker B: Yeah. So that was interesting. Wait, who bought, who bought club Penguin? I think it was Disney. Who bought club Penguin? Disney, right. So, I mean, what you guys are building here is basically just an IP house and you monetize in a bunch of different ways. And the way that IP houses today monetize in a bunch of different ways, is that right?
00:25:27.314 - 00:25:27.834, Speaker A: Correct.
00:25:27.914 - 00:25:28.602, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:28.778 - 00:25:39.704, Speaker A: Well, not a toy business or I'm not an NFT business or not any specific business. I'm an IP business. I live and die by the awareness of my character. My character is not relevant. I'm not relevant. My character is relevant. I'm relevant.
00:25:39.704 - 00:26:04.808, Speaker A: I'm printing money ten different ways just to give you an idea. You know, an IP company is really the broadest version of what these character brands can be. You know, some. I've never understood why an NFT company would call themselves a gaming company or whatever, because in reality, IP encompasses all of it. I can have the next club Penguin, I can have the next. Happy feat. I can have all of the things that everybody else does, and it all falls into the same category, which is IP.
00:26:04.936 - 00:26:14.364, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you think about licensing IP? Movies, films, commercials? I'm sure there's other stuff that goes into licensing. How do you think about that?
00:26:15.104 - 00:27:23.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I think from our end, a huge case study that we want to prove is how do you democratize IP? And I think that democratization for us is how do you turn the relationship between brand and consumer to brand and participant? Right now, when Disney ships a new IP, the relationship between the person who's consuming, that is very much the relationship between brand and consumer. When Pudgy penguins releases, in this case, Pudgy Penguins is our flagship IP. When we go and build and create movies and stories and toys and products, the brand and participant relationship comes into play. Because every piece of product, every piece of content, everything that we make, we actually license from the holder to actually use that character. And the thought process is, well, we have 8888 punchy penguin characters that have minted on the blockchain. Why am I going to go and draw a bunch of different characters and keep all that value to myself? At the end of the day, I'm going to win. If my community rally behinds me, and if they rally behind me, what is that incentive model that keeps us aligned by the hip? And I think that value accrual.
00:27:23.654 - 00:27:54.032, Speaker A: When you think about what does the NFT holder really want? Well, the it elephant in the room is the NFT holder wants monetary gain. To pretend that they don't is a fool's error. And the same reason why you might buy a sports card. Majority of people buying sports cards a day just want to flip it for more money. And so that's okay. It's an okay behavior, and I understand that. But how do you create a monetary value accrual funnel that is not Ponzi nomics, that is creating NFTs that are thin air or tokens that are thin air and just dropping it into people's wallets? Because that's not sustainable, nor is that really real in my opinion.
00:27:54.032 - 00:28:45.414, Speaker A: It can be done once or twice or three times, but over the course of 20 years, how many new imaginary things are you going to airdrop into people's wallets? How are you really going to sustain monetary value accrual? I think the answer to that is licensing. Every time I make a toy, I can go give somebody a percentage of that toy every time it sells, and I can take their character out. And I think the hit I'll take on the margin will supersede the extra marketing and hyper galvanization around that narrative to kind of push the brand even further. And so licensing to me is the ultimate solution for web three NFT projects and community. And the best way to accrue value and provide utility for your community. Unequivocally, I've thought of this long and hard, and the only legitimate way to do it is through licensing. And then on the flip side, licensing for me from, as a pudgy penguin business owner, I mean, being in the ip business, licensing is the business that I'm in.
00:28:45.414 - 00:29:00.282, Speaker A: You look at Pokemon and hello Kitty, they make billions of dollars a year. Look at their books, they're making all of that money from licensing. They are not making that money making or incubating anything themselves. Sure, they might do one or two products, but you know that money is just throwing your stuff and collecting a.
00:29:00.298 - 00:29:32.534, Speaker B: Check I feel like different projects, like doodles and nouns and stuff have played around with different licensing models. Like, there's the model of very. I haven't followed it too closely, but I think nouns, like anyone, can take their noun and do anything with it. Then there's, like, doodles where it's like, if you do something under 100, I'm going to botch this fact. But, like, under 100k, something happens. Over 100k, something else happens. How do you think about, like, bottoms up, like, decentralized licensing and, like, will, like, if I own a pudgy, can I do anything with it? Can I do anything up to a certain dollar amount with it? Do we have to split the dollars there? How does that work?
00:29:32.874 - 00:29:56.150, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty interesting. It's an agreement that we spend a lot of time going under. For me, ownership is really monetization. Like, what is it? To really own something I think is like kind of like a vague term. And again, I wouldn't expect you to follow up with this, but there's, there's a lot of interesting court cases going on right now where there's a lot of conjecture. To kind of remove that conjecture. I just made it pretty simple.
00:29:56.150 - 00:30:42.292, Speaker A: Look, we are a brand for everybody, so you can do what you want with your penguin as long as it's not harmful, sexist, racist, or something weird, right? We have a brand to protect. And, you know, I'm definitely not going to allow you to do some explicit video using a pudgy penguin to cause harm to anybody. That's just not our ethos. So I do have the right to control that, and I do have, in our agreement, there's a $500,000 a year cap. But I told the community that it's really a placebo for anybody who's a genuine holder and really put in place so that a big brand doesn't circumvent doing a deal with me. That is, if there's a 500 cap on my pudgy penguin, Starbucks is not going to go buy a pudgy penguin and circumvent me. Like, they're just going to, you know, work with me because, you know, they're not in the business of 500 grand being a meaningful needle mover.
00:30:42.292 - 00:31:22.928, Speaker A: But I told the community, look, at the end of the day, I've extended that license every single time somebody's asked that I've known has been a part of this community. Uh, like in a real, in a real non like extraction, trying to use the IP way. And, uh, like, somebody came to me for a burger joint and said, hey, like, I don't want to, not going to do this if I can only make a half a million dollars doing it, or I have to split the money. And I'm like, dude, sign this. We set up the agreement five minutes later, signed, on your way, go make as much money on that pudgy penguin burger joint as you want. I think I'm in the business of making money and being sustainable, and so I think I don't really believe in the whole, like, complete free for all. I think there's too much risk when there's a free for all society.
00:31:22.928 - 00:31:44.454, Speaker A: Just humans in general haven't done well in this whole free for all. People think they want a free for all, but you actually don't like law and order or some sort of boundaries I think have been really healthy for the human race for a very long time. And this like, complete, just nonchalant. Do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want. I actually think it doesn't work the way that people wish it would work.
00:31:46.154 - 00:32:30.690, Speaker B: Let's face it, concentrated liquidity is hard. And that's why I'm super excited to partner with Carbon for Empire. Carbon is a new Dex on Ethereum that makes concentrated liquidity easy. With carbon, LP's can now automate your liquidity strategy with custom on chain limit orders and range orders. Wanna buy a token when it dips and sell it when it spikes with carbon? You can now set a strategy that buys in on one price range and sells in a higher range on repeat. Using a single source of automated rotating liquidity strategies can be created for for any standard ERC 20 token. I recently checked out the carbon beta that just dropped pretty blown away by the liquidity strategies that carbon enables on chain.
00:32:30.690 - 00:32:54.508, Speaker B: It has these rich trading features that you'd expect from a centralized exchange, except carbon is fully on chain, decentralized and non custodial. Just connect your wallet. It's carbon defi XYZ. That's carbon defi XYZ. Choose a trading pair, set your buy and sell ranges and amounts. Hit create and you're done. Carbon automatically moves your liquidity into your selected ranges.
00:32:54.508 - 00:33:27.636, Speaker B: As the market moves LP's, it is time to take back control of your liquidity with carbon. Check out the link and get started today. Now let's get back to Empire. All right folks, it is time to talk about one of my and a lot of your favorite DeFi protocols. Synthetix. Synthetix has been pushing the limit in Defi innovation since 2017 and has just started its most exciting transition yet, with Synthetix V three. With Synthetix V three, any protocol can now tap into synthetix liquidity to bootstrap derivatives markets.
00:33:27.636 - 00:34:04.376, Speaker B: The transition has already started with Synthetix perps. Synthetix perps taps into Synthetix's liquidity layer and is a new primitive that developers can leverage to launch defi direction derivatives. The perps product has been going incredibly well so far. Hopefully you've seen it. It's had some great traction, hitting 500 million in daily volume this March. We know that liquidity rules Defi and Synthetix is becoming the modular liquidity layer for Defi derivatives. As a trader, you can trade Synthetix perps with low fees in over 20 different markets at quenta IO, decentrix.com
00:34:04.376 - 00:34:37.142, Speaker B: and polynomial fi. And this opportunity set keeps growing. With ten new partners in the pipeline ready to launch integrations on top of Synthetix, including front ends, structured products and institutional offerings, the team gave me a sneak peek of all this stuff. It's really cool. Would really recommend you check out Synthetix IO perps to learn more. And if you're looking to build on Synthetix, hop into their discord server, reach out to the team directly. Make sure to tell them that Empire and Santi and Yano sent you again, synthetix IO forward slash perps.
00:34:37.142 - 00:34:47.478, Speaker B: You can also hop into the discord server and reach out to the team directly. All right, so taking back to this toy drop when so you guys launched, what are they called? Plushies?
00:34:47.526 - 00:34:54.366, Speaker A: I think they are, yeah, plushies, collectibles, mystery igloos. We launched a couple skus you can buy on Amazon.
00:34:54.390 - 00:35:00.354, Speaker B: I was looking at these, I might snag one of these. How much money did you guys make from this?
00:35:01.204 - 00:35:04.076, Speaker A: A million dollars in the first couple of days. Just under.
00:35:04.260 - 00:35:13.012, Speaker B: Not bad. Not bad. Can you share? Can you share other fun? Like, so you guys bought it for two and a half. It was doing seven. Seven and a half. Grow seven net. Roughly.
00:35:13.012 - 00:35:19.780, Speaker B: Like, how do you think you guys are? Tough market for nfts in 2023. Like, how do you think you're going to do this year? Next year?
00:35:19.852 - 00:35:50.290, Speaker A: Yeah, so we, we bought the business for two and a half million dollars April 4 of 2022. If you look at April 4, 2022, it literally was picotop. Like, that day was literally the top 3400 ETH is when I exchanged it, it was down only ever since we went hit lows as low as 851st year in revenue. We did about 1.8 this year. We're on track to do 6.57 with half of that coming from physical products and self sustaining.
00:35:50.290 - 00:35:57.442, Speaker A: And so our burn is less than that. And so hopefully we'll have a profitable year in a really down bear market.
00:35:57.618 - 00:35:58.050, Speaker B: That's great.
00:35:58.082 - 00:36:00.922, Speaker A: If I can just keep doubling revenue every year, we'll be in a good spot.
00:36:01.018 - 00:36:07.654, Speaker B: That's great, man. I mean, it's been impressive. You, uh, what, what was the price of, uh, what was the floor price of pudgies when you, when you bought them?
00:36:08.354 - 00:36:09.894, Speaker A: 0.75.
00:36:10.394 - 00:36:12.414, Speaker B: What's it at now? Like three and a half? Four?
00:36:13.234 - 00:36:13.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:14.674 - 00:36:24.534, Speaker B: Yeah. Not bad, man. In this market. Um, what's the team look like? Is it. Dude, is it content creators? Like, how do you, how do you build a team around this?
00:36:25.534 - 00:36:57.394, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a bitch of a business because there's so many layers. Like, you know, keep in mind just that Instagram alone, there's people who do that, that type of Instagram stuff, and that's like their whole life business. Just so you know, like, there's like eight businesses within one. So, thankfully, the way that I assembled it was very avenger style. I knew I was coming into a tall task and I knew, but I knew the upside was there and I knew I needed the best. So I basically took the best six people I've ever worked with in my life, and I basically said, hey, I want you guys to be a part of this. You're not going to make any money.
00:36:57.394 - 00:37:27.084, Speaker A: I need you to invest some. But the valuation is so cheap, we should be able to beat it within twelve to 18 months time, and it should be a huge home run slam dunk. And they all said yes. But all of these guys and gals that are on this team, at least, like, the managers in the c level group I've all worked with for many years in the past, and we've all crushed it together. So this is like, not like, this is not like new startups. Like, this is very much. I've taken big wins, especially with our chief creative officer, Peter, who really is like, my, my, we're like a dynamic duo.
00:37:27.084 - 00:37:52.114, Speaker A: My ying to my yang. I mean, we've got like three or four nine figure wins in terms of, like, things we were able to, like, do nine figures a year with. Uh, and so he, he and I really have an amazing groove. We have just a complete stacked Team 40 now. We're growing pretty fast. Burns getting a little high, but I want to be aggressive right now. Like, now's the time for me where it's like, I'm just, everyone's blowing up, just making mistakes left and right.
00:37:52.114 - 00:37:57.706, Speaker A: Have no clue really what they're doing. And so this is where I just want to take all the attention and grow the fastest and grow the best.
00:37:57.810 - 00:38:35.474, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's interesting. So there's like, so blockworks media and information platform, we have like two sides of the business media and the research and analytics side of the business. And there's probably, there's like several analytics and research platforms in crypto and there's several media companies. There's probably like one or two in each of those buckets that I think are doing a good job and like five or six that I'm like, enough with enough time, this won't go well for you guys, probably when you look at the NFT space, like, you know, I think everyone knows the big names. Like, who do you look at? And you're like, oh, I actually really respect what you guys are doing. You're going at it differently and, but I, you know, but I respect what you're doing.
00:38:38.194 - 00:38:49.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Without like just shooting, without shitting on people. Because I'll just tell you the truth, dude, there's only five projects that ever put my, like, no, because I know I've seen, I know what's behind all the curtains.
00:38:50.634 - 00:38:52.050, Speaker B: What, what are the projects?
00:38:52.122 - 00:39:27.768, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't, I can't, I can't do it. I can't, I can't do it because it would just, it would, it would automate automatically like alienate people. But I will say there's five projects that are worth putting your money behind. Two of them don't need have any founders running it with the exception of crypto punks. Crypto punks being an obvious one. And the rest are completely going to zero. I can tell you unequivocally, I'll tell you the person I have the most respect for in the space and the person that I think does the best job is frank from D gods.
00:39:27.768 - 00:39:54.996, Speaker A: I think if it's not myself, it's him. And then Yuga, I think you got, I have my own reserve. Like I'm super Yuga board eight. Maxi, just to be clear, I'm afraid of Yuga's supply and demand thing and the gaming and how it really is going to tie in. I think it's the right business decision for their business. I don't know how it is from an NFT collecting standpoint. We'll see it vague, but Yuga, obviously, we don't even need to talk about them because they're at the top of the totem pole.
00:39:54.996 - 00:40:11.394, Speaker A: And until we do any better than really, I can't say shit. Uh, but if it's not Yuga, it's Frank. And so to me I see as me frank them and then I have, you know, two other picks that would be pretty obvious if you're familiar with the space. But I don't want to tell them. Cause then you'll know everybody else sucks.
00:40:11.694 - 00:40:28.164, Speaker B: So it's funny. So I went. So I, uh, I'm going to tie this story back to Frank in a second. So I went to, um, Barclays this weekend and, uh, ice cube started a new basketball league called, uh, it's called big three. And I go, so I show up to this league. It's funny league. It's all three v three basketball.
00:40:28.164 - 00:40:50.774, Speaker B: First to 50 wins. They've got like four point shots and shit. And you know, there's like, Jason Richardson's out there shooting threes, Gilbert Arenas is out there. It's like a bunch of 40, 45 year old retired NBA players. But I'm out there on the, like the kind of court side, vip, like owner's area or whatever. Cause like someone I know invests in one of the companies or something. And I look around, there's probably 100 people in this area.
00:40:50.774 - 00:41:04.774, Speaker B: 70 of them were wearing d God shirts. It was wild. Yeah, like, d gods army showed up at this thing. So they're, they're out and about. Um, why, why Frank? Just curious, just, I mean, you guys are storytellers.
00:41:05.314 - 00:41:30.178, Speaker A: Yeah. You can just know who really gets it and understands it, who's a complete critical thinker. I mean, dude, you'd be surprised. A lot of these guys are so freaking checked out. And so no critical thinking, no execution, no innovation, trying to redo things that the other guys are doing, no self thought. Like, Frank is a leader. He's a hyper elite marketer.
00:41:30.178 - 00:41:48.798, Speaker A: He is a hyper elite brand guy. People don't know this. Like, his eye for design is unlike is. I only know one person like it and sorry, it's Peter, but, like, this guy's incredibly impressive on his design side. And they just got the team to do it. And some people just get it. Some people just really, really fucking get it.
00:41:48.798 - 00:42:15.026, Speaker A: And this is the space where it's not about your resume, it's not about your experience, whether you get it or not. How many, like, this whole the web three space needs to stop falling for it. But if they're from Google or Facebook or Disney or Warner, like, don't let that sell you because that is like, that doesn't mean anything here. It means nothing. You either have a finger on the pulse and you understand culture or you don't. Frank understands culture. One of the reasons why I think we do so well.
00:42:15.026 - 00:42:38.210, Speaker A: Cause we understand culture, right? Like, and obviously we can innovate and we can execute, and same with him, but most of these people are just, like, have no finger on the pulse of what's cool, what's hot, what's hip, what's trending, you know? Like, they just, like, complete, like, buzzards. Like, in the desert with, like, not a carcass in sight. So it's unequivocally hint.
00:42:38.322 - 00:42:38.762, Speaker B: He.
00:42:38.858 - 00:42:53.134, Speaker A: I'm telling you, if it's not me, it's him. I promise. Like, I. Obviously, I'm gonna put myself because that's the person I am. I think of myself as the fucking Michael Jordan. Like, that's how I wake up every morning. So I always say that I think I'm the best, but honestly, that's my guy.
00:42:53.134 - 00:43:02.406, Speaker A: And I have so much respect. And honestly, I'm not here if it wasn't for him because he totally expanded my horizons and got me to think the right way, because I wasn't thinking the right way in the beginning here.
00:43:02.510 - 00:43:20.234, Speaker B: Interesting. You mentioned Pudgy's like, v one, basically. Will you guys ever. I know you've been kind of roasting these other things that just drop a bunch of things, but I could see that strategy making sense for you in the future. Not as like a money grab, but as a way to kind of unlock more ip and things like that. Will you guys launch anything else on chain?
00:43:20.314 - 00:43:46.166, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think totally does supply and demand war in it, right? Like, we're in the midst of a bear. You'd have to be cuckoo for cocoa puffs if you're minting anything or adding any digital extra supply in the bear. Seriously, it doesn't matter who you are. Even Yuga. I think a measure of the yuga's downturn recently is because, like, dude, stop unlocking more nfts right now. Keep the liquidity centralized. Just like a pretty obvious thing to understand, I think.
00:43:46.166 - 00:44:06.118, Speaker A: Yeah, there's totally introductions for new characters. Just supply. Demand has to outweigh supply, and I have to have clearly more demand than I have supply and minting. I'm not shitting on minting. Minting is a great revenue model. It's a great moment to introduce new characters and new story and appeal to new audiences. But it's just about supply and demand.
00:44:06.118 - 00:44:20.568, Speaker A: Are you ready for it? Is the market ready for it? Right. And how can you also innovate there? I think the same like 20,000 collection, 10,000 collection. If when I start introducing new characters, I'm going to do it a lot differently than it's ever been done, that I'm sure.
00:44:20.736 - 00:44:26.128, Speaker B: Nice, man. Let's look at the future a little bit. What are you excited about? The next six months back? Half of the year?
00:44:26.176 - 00:44:58.952, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, dude. I think before the year is over you'll remember it based on what I tell you today. But I think I have one of the all time great moments and announcements for the NFT space that's ever happened. Me being an avid collector and being so involved in the space. I just look back at what I know I'm going to announce in quarter four and I think to myself, has there been a more meaningful announcement in NFT? And you'd be surprised, but I think there's very few, if any. And so I'm really excited for that.
00:44:58.952 - 00:45:22.734, Speaker A: I'm excited for a thing that we've been working for a long time on called Project Overpass. I think Project overpass solves one of web three's biggest problems. And that problem is licensing at scale on chain. We were the first major project to license ip from our holders and I was wondering why until we did it. And then when we did it, I understood why because it's a huge pain in the ass. It is not easy to do. It takes weeks if not months to get the deals done.
00:45:22.734 - 00:45:30.550, Speaker A: But there should be a web three native way to do this. And we solved this with Project overpass. So hopefully really excited to give that.
00:45:30.662 - 00:45:34.328, Speaker B: Licensing platform, the licensing platform that you guys built basically. Got it.
00:45:34.376 - 00:46:13.774, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's going to be available to our community at first and then we'll open it up to other communities and kind of will be our gift to the NFT space and kind of solve a lot of utility problems for a lot of projects. Because to be frank, I think that's the purest, most kosher, most above board form of utility you can possibly do for between holder and brand is, hey, I'm building a brand, I'm making products, I'm making content. Let me pay you for the right to use your character in these assets. It's pretty obvious, completely above board. No one can question that in any shapewear form. So yeah, I'm excited for those two things before the year is over.
00:46:14.194 - 00:46:23.854, Speaker B: Nice, man. You tweeted two weeks ago, Pudgy Penguin says one of the biggest announcements in the history of web three coming. Q four. You just mentioned, mentioned it. Can you share anything about it?
00:46:25.554 - 00:46:30.208, Speaker A: I probably can't because I want to keep it fun. But I think I'll make a deal with you.
00:46:30.256 - 00:46:36.844, Speaker B: I'll make a deal with you right now. I will buy, I don't own any pudgies. I will buy a pudgy right now if you share some info on it.
00:46:38.424 - 00:47:13.860, Speaker A: Let's see what I can do. I think, I think it's really about, I think it's proliferation and my thesis personified. I think when I make this announcement, everything I talked about with you on this podcast will be undeniable. I think it's not going to be like, oh, he's, he's doing it, or he's on the right path. I think when you see that moment, you'll be like, holy fuck. This 25 year old in southern Florida really fucking did it. And outdid dudes twice my age with twice, ten times the reputation that I have, you know? And I fucking did it.
00:47:13.860 - 00:47:15.820, Speaker A: I think that's what you're going to think when you see it.
00:47:15.972 - 00:47:28.224, Speaker B: Nice, man. All right. I'm still buying a pudgy anyways. I'm going to buy this thing. Uh, are you guys going to raise any more money? What's the, what do you think the future, like, financing for the business looks like?
00:47:28.644 - 00:48:02.044, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. Probably. I'm not in the business of raising money just to raise rounds. So, like, one thing I won't do is, like, I'm not going to raise valuations just to, like, in a bull market, we could probably raise it a billion dollar valuation, right? If, by the, like, if we continue on the trajectory that we're going and the bull market rages better than the one before it, like, it probably a clear path, but I don't want to raise just to have that my ego stroke. Like, I only want to raise to have a purpose. And honestly, like, I'm a firm believer that you got to be a little uncomfortable to win. You got to be a little hungry.
00:48:02.044 - 00:48:34.596, Speaker A: I look at some of these projects and, like, why are you failing? Like, why you have so much money? And probably the reason why they're failing is because they have so much money. And it's just like, you're paying yourself a crazy salary, you know, so many, so much excess heads and employees in the workforce. Like, no shit. You're probably just kicking back at your office for 4 hours with a pina colada. Like, though you don't, you would never admit it. Like, I could understand why you would do that. So I just want to stay hungry, and I'm not here to.
00:48:34.596 - 00:49:03.886, Speaker A: I'm here to, you know, like, if there's. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think the goal is to not. Right? Like, the goal is the goal in a perfect world, as I take this thing all the way through and we ride this thing as a legacy business, and this round of financing that we took in was it. But if there's a real path to grow and we're really hitting things on a nail and there's. There's a moment to make, you know, uh, to bring in more cash for the business, I think there's too many variables for me to tell you.
00:49:03.886 - 00:49:06.074, Speaker A: In a perfect world, the answer would be no, though.
00:49:06.374 - 00:49:15.362, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, man. What do I. Looking at these pudgies here. What's that? What's a. How do I buy these pudgies? What's a good trait to get? How do I. What's that? What's hot?
00:49:15.538 - 00:49:23.370, Speaker A: It's the gold skin and the ice skin, man. Show us what the block works. Bankroll is made of the gold skin.
00:49:23.402 - 00:49:24.858, Speaker B: And the ice skin. All right, give me something.
00:49:24.946 - 00:49:40.014, Speaker A: Yeah. You know the ethos with the penguins? We have a motto or a tagline, and it is, I am my penguin. My penguin is me. Pick a penguin that you resonate with, that you identify with. Right? The one that you could be like, this is me. That's really the thing with the penguins. It's not.
00:49:40.354 - 00:49:44.410, Speaker B: I'm looking through these. I like these things. This is funny.
00:49:44.442 - 00:49:54.210, Speaker A: They're good. They're round. They have the contour bias. If you're familiar with the universal principles of design, like, there's definitely. Like, there's something magical. It's actually. People underestimate this.
00:49:54.210 - 00:50:08.254, Speaker A: Frank puts a huge emphasis. There's a science to a good PFP. They don't just happen. Like, there's a real science to them. And pudgy penguins also checks off a lot of those boxes for the science of what makes a good PF interesting.
00:50:09.354 - 00:50:11.374, Speaker B: All right, man. Anything else that we missed?
00:50:11.874 - 00:50:14.494, Speaker A: No, dude, but this was a badass interview. Thanks for having me.
00:50:14.794 - 00:50:22.414, Speaker B: Yeah, appreciate it. Pumped to see what you guys do. I'm actually going to snag one of these penguins, so this will be. I got to find one that kind of looks like me.
00:50:23.234 - 00:50:23.802, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:23.898 - 00:50:31.058, Speaker B: Anyways, man, it was a pleasure. Appreciate you coming on. Appreciate the time, as always. And I will. I'm sure you'll be back on here at some point soon, so I appreciate it.
00:50:31.226 - 00:50:35.434, Speaker A: And, dude, continue the great work, and thanks for having me. I know you didn't have to, so I appreciate it.
00:50:35.474 - 00:50:36.254, Speaker B: Thanks, man.
