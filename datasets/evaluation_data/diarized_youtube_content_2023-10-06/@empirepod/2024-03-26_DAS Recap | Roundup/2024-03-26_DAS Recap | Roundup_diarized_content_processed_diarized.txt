00:00:00.360 - 00:00:31.950, Speaker A: By the numbers, quantitatively, like 50% larger than any das in history. Qualitatively, it was the first time Das as an event has ever broken into, like, the crypto native sphere, which is a really cool feeling. Hey, everyone, if you have been listening to Empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on arbitrum.
00:00:32.062 - 00:00:32.518, Speaker B: You're doing.
00:00:32.566 - 00:01:07.726, Speaker A: You can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to portal Arbitrum IO and check it out. What's up, everyone?

We are doing the roundup today, but it's really just a Das recap because, Santi, my schedule got all screwed up because of Das, which we want to recap here for you guys. If you. If you missed it, we want to recap it. If you made it.
00:02:00.550 - 00:02:10.714, Speaker A: It was awesome meeting a lot of you. It was really one of the highlights of the year, I think, for me, was. Was meeting a lot of you guys at the, at the Empire meetup, which we can talk about. But Santi, my friend, how we doing?
00:02:11.294 - 00:02:23.782, Speaker B: All right. A bit tanned, I guess. Dude, you look like I am blushing. I was overwhelmed by, you know, we've been doing this for, what is it, almost two years? Over two years, yeah.
00:02:23.838 - 00:02:31.910, Speaker A: March, actually. Oh, we meant we totally missed our anniversary. March of 2021. Oh, no. Three. Wait, three years. Three years.
00:02:31.942 - 00:02:32.446, Speaker B: Three years.
00:02:32.510 - 00:02:33.806, Speaker A: Three years. Yeah. Yeah.
00:02:33.870 - 00:02:54.050, Speaker B: So we've known three years. It took us a while to, like, get in the flow and swing, but I think this is the first time we really got connected to the people that have listened. And honestly, it's. It's the most rewarding thing, for me, at least. And I think you. You also came to me first day right before my panel, and we're like. Like, it's amazing to see, like, just people really enjoying it.
00:02:54.050 - 00:03:02.602, Speaker B: And, um. Yeah, it's, uh, it's. For me, it's more. More wholesome, more fulfilling than anything else.
00:03:02.778 - 00:03:03.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:03.514 - 00:03:05.494, Speaker B: In what I do professionally.
00:03:06.354 - 00:03:31.574, Speaker A: I knew that people enjoyed the podcast. I didn't realize the. It was cool, man. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I'm not going to share anyone's personal stories here, but, like, there was this one episode we did with Joe McCann, and I didn't realize how impactful that episode. Like, that episode, I think, got several people who came up to me like, that changed the course of their financial life, as they told me, because they bought bonk and it went up into meme coin season.
00:03:31.574 - 00:03:46.134, Speaker A: I don't know, but it was really cool meeting everyone, maybe. Let's zoom out. What were your thoughts on? Because we can talk about the meetup in a little bit. This was. So you've been to permissionless. What were your thoughts on Das as an event? I don't think you've attended Das before.
00:03:46.594 - 00:04:14.164, Speaker B: No. Really, really good crowd. I mean, obviously it skews institutional investors, regulators, companies. So, you know, of course, I don't have hit, you know, the benefit of having attended other desk, but other conferences in this moment. I made an effort to go because we are like, the ETF just got approved and it's in the side guys. Right. Particularly for institutions.
00:04:14.164 - 00:04:49.188, Speaker B: And so it was useful to attend the event and, like, get a feeling for that. And of course, we're in a bull market, so conferences are always more chaotic. But I think it was very, the panels, the caliber of the speakers was very compact. And, like, in a couple days, you could sort of. For me, I wanted to go out there to also from. As an investor, to understand the state of the market, the sentiment out there, and to validate or invalidate certain ideas that I've had. And so I can get into a little bit more of what I mean by that.
00:04:49.188 - 00:04:58.340, Speaker B: But I think it was very well organized event. Someone did comment like, there's too many suits. I'm like, well, yeah, that's like Das, you know?
00:04:58.372 - 00:05:02.664, Speaker A: Right. Point of the event, my friend. That's the point of the event. So.
00:05:03.094 - 00:05:23.674, Speaker B: But it was. It was also, London in and of itself is a good epicenter for just. It is a very thriving crypto hub. It has been for a while. So you did have a lot of the local companies or european based companies, even kind of eastern coast, like, come to the event, which is also pretty cool. So, yeah, I don't know what you felt about it, but overall.
00:05:27.054 - 00:05:48.404, Speaker A: Do you know, we originally had this Das in DC, which was just a horrendous call. And then, you know, we were talking to all these sponsors, actually, and people were. Because basically early 2023 regulation was at the heart of the industry, and so we were like, oh, let's put it in DC. That'd be cool. Go to the belly of the beast. All these sponsors, like, you know, talk to all these other crypto brands, like, yeah, that's great. You're doing it in DC.
00:05:48.404 - 00:06:06.002, Speaker A: I won't be there. I'm not going there. So then we finally, we called, like three or four people called. I think it was Constantine from block, Damon, Jeremy from Jeremy Allaire from Circle, Stani from Aave. And we said, if we do it in London, will you guys like, what do you. What do you think? They're like? Yes. That is.
00:06:06.002 - 00:06:10.690, Speaker A: That is where you need to go. So can you hear the sirens, by the way?
00:06:10.842 - 00:06:16.194, Speaker B: No, but you. If you're recording in New York, there's always sirens or having a call blasting.
00:06:16.234 - 00:06:24.522, Speaker A: Outside, by the way. I'm sorry, folks. I'm a. I'm sick as a dog right now, so I've not. So I got back Thursday from London. I'll tell you about Das in a second. My thoughts on it.
00:06:24.522 - 00:06:51.612, Speaker A: I got back Thursday, landed at like, 03:00 p.m. And I had to race back home because I was babysitting my niece, and she's 15 months old, and my wife's sister and her husband basically dropped this kid off with us and they left the kid for three days, which is the first time in my life I have ever taken care of a baby. And my wife and I are both sick. Are you more inclined now to have.
00:06:51.628 - 00:06:53.156, Speaker B: A baby after that?
00:06:53.300 - 00:07:11.354, Speaker A: This episode is dedicated to every parent in crypto out there. Also any single parents, like, I don't. I truly don't understand how you do it. I. By. By Sunday, I was like, take this. It was remarkable how hard it was.
00:07:11.354 - 00:07:12.282, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:12.378 - 00:07:17.290, Speaker B: I bought a. When I was living in New York, I got a french bulldog, and, yeah.
00:07:17.362 - 00:07:19.250, Speaker A: I bought a baby. I just. And I returned.
00:07:19.282 - 00:07:28.914, Speaker B: No, no, adopt a baby, Jason. Buy a baby. But I bought a dog, and, yeah, it's a full time job.
00:07:28.954 - 00:07:31.002, Speaker A: So what happened to the french bulldog?
00:07:31.138 - 00:07:34.094, Speaker B: French bulldog is vacationing permanently with my parents.
00:07:34.834 - 00:07:36.706, Speaker A: Nice. I was traveling so much.
00:07:36.770 - 00:07:38.114, Speaker B: He's living a better life.
00:07:38.274 - 00:07:57.680, Speaker A: He is living a good life. So, anyways, my thoughts on Das. So, for some context, blockworks launched. Mike and I founded the business December 2017. We quit our jobs may of 2018. The first Das was the. Was May of 2019, and it was the biggest thing we'd ever done.
00:07:57.680 - 00:08:07.924, Speaker A: We bet the whole company. We bet every dollar in the bank account on this. On the first das. If it. If it worked, we would have a business. If it didn't work, there would be no block works today. We bet the entire company.
00:08:07.924 - 00:08:24.454, Speaker A: And there's actually a funny story of that, which I'll. Which I'll share, which is we hired this. This woman, Julie Muroff, who currently runs. Still runs all of our events, and it's just an absolute stud. And she. Or before. Before the first das, we were hosting these little happy hours.
00:08:24.454 - 00:08:39.686, Speaker A: There were six to 10:00 p.m. And we would spend, like, $5,000. Pull in 15 to 20, and we'd net, like ten to 15 or 15. Yeah, around ten to. Mike and I were stoked. Right? We're only employees of the business. It's good money to be making.
00:08:39.686 - 00:09:11.874, Speaker A: And so we hired Julie to help us with the vend operations, and she proposed a budget to Mike and I, and the budget she proposed, I think, was three hundred fifty k. And at the time, we had 300k on our bank account. But Julie was, like the first real employee that we hired. And we were so nervous that she would quit if we didn't give her the budget. Say yes. Or if we were like, oh, what? Like, this budget's crazy. So we just approved the budget on the spot, and we basically.
00:09:11.874 - 00:09:23.436, Speaker A: Mike. Mike looked at me, went out for beers after. He's like, you better fucking sell this thing. He's like, I'll figure out everything else, then. Ops with Julie ticketing. Go sell some sponsorships.
00:09:23.580 - 00:10:04.174, Speaker B: Anyways, I want to ask you a question around to give listeners perspective on how the industry's evolved. I think it's useful to look at it through a lens of someone like you that has organized these conferences. What is the first conference, the first das, and that experience of going out, talking to sponsors, talking to large institutions, the feedback, the reception that you got then. And how has it changed over the years, particularly and especially now? I'm kind of curious because you have to organize these well in advance. We were not in the state of the market we are today when you started planning das for this year. So, yeah, maybe just give us a good insight view into how this all works.
00:10:05.034 - 00:10:40.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to pull up, like, the keynote, the two keynotes at das 2019. I've got our 2019 page pulled up. It was the CTO of the DTCC and DJ Chan from a company in China called Fusion. It was like. I mean, yeah, it was. The sponsors were dealbox, founders Bank, Harbor, Hedera, Token IQ, Tokensoft, Seed, CX, total. And a law.
00:10:40.258 - 00:10:43.602, Speaker A: And a law firm like we. You know, more than half of these.
00:10:43.738 - 00:10:46.282, Speaker B: Don'T no longer exist, by the way.
00:10:46.338 - 00:11:12.226, Speaker A: Most of the companies no longer exist. A lot. Some of them rebranded, some of them got acquired, most of them went under. But, you know, I remember sitting down with copper, right? Copper, huge multi, you know, unicorn company. They've raised, I think, 500 million to date. And we were trying to sell them on a sponsorship. And their CEO basically said, look, we have six employees.
00:11:12.226 - 00:11:23.522, Speaker A: We just raised our first million dollars. We can give you maybe seven k. We're like, seven k done. And now they've raised 500 million. But, yeah, so that das. That first das was a one day event. It had 500 people.
00:11:23.522 - 00:11:43.554, Speaker A: This was our 8th digital asset summit. So we've hosted seven dases in the past in both New York and London. The biggest das. So usually they have about 500 to 800 people. Very b, two b, very institutional. The biggest das in history before this was New York in 2022. That was like standing room only.
00:11:43.554 - 00:12:00.324, Speaker A: Like really crazy. It was a two day event. This Das, for context, again, biggest one ever, 1200 people. This was, I think, 1700 or 1800. I haven't got the final report from the team. I think between 17 and 1800 registrants. Three day event.
00:12:00.324 - 00:12:36.216, Speaker A: And we. Yeah, so the hotel made us stop selling these tickets. We capped our registration. So it was easily, I mean, by the numbers, quantitatively, like 50% larger than any Das in history. Qualitatively, it was the first time Das as an event has ever broken into, like, the crypto native sphere, which is a really cool feeling. So for us, like, I've always felt like there's crypto Twitter, there's permissionless, there's ECC, there's Devcon, there's all these events happening over here. And then blockworks has this suit and tie event happening over here.
00:12:36.216 - 00:13:05.896, Speaker A: And it's been both fun and cool, but also kind of annoying. I'm like, hey, guys, pay attention to us over here. And this was the first time in history that I think das broke through the rubicon into the crypto native sphere. It was the first time we've ever been able to get some of the huge names like Blackrock and Goldman and Marshall Waste and some of the largest allocators in the world and largest financial institutions, but also, we got most of the tier one DeFi protocols there as well, which was really cool.
00:13:06.040 - 00:13:23.184, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. It was useful for me because I got a chance to meet with a lot of the portfolio companies that I haven't caught up in a while. I was able to have dinner with folks like Stani and others. So it was really so actually quite, quite nice. I would agree with you. It's a good treat to mix both.
00:13:23.724 - 00:13:57.258, Speaker A: Yeah, it was cool. I mean, we've also started, like, a lot of the first panels of the opening panel at a lot of these events in the past for Das was, are the institutions coming? Or when are the institutions coming? And we made a point. I think Mike might have said this in his opening talk. There is no longer for what, five years? Since May of 2019. There's a question mark at the end of that panel. When are the institutions coming? How will the institutions come in? For the first time ever, we felt pretty confident not adding a question mark at the end of that panel. It said, the institutions are here.
00:13:57.258 - 00:14:16.028, Speaker A: And that was just, like, a very symbolic moment, I think, for us. It was just cool seeing. Yeah, that was exciting. It was cool seeing the different. I mean, the quality of new products in the industry is insane. I'm sure we'll see it ten x that at permissionless in October, but just the number of new products is insanely high. It was cool seeing the themes.
00:14:16.028 - 00:14:38.864, Speaker A: I think there were a few, like, really clear themes. There's always a few clear themes at every event that are talked about. Like, I think at ETH Denver's, like, modularity, AI bitcoin, l two s and restaking. And at this, I mean, I'd be curious to ask you, like, were there any, like, things that you, like takeaways or topics or things that you think everyone was discussing?
00:14:41.034 - 00:15:03.882, Speaker B: I think a lot of people are asking, like, where are we in the cycle? The panel that I was. I was at, that was the bulk of the conversation centered around that people really want to understand kind of that timing, which is a very interesting, but also not interesting question, by the way.
00:15:03.898 - 00:15:20.462, Speaker A: There are two panels that are. There's a, there's a, there's a contest going on right now. So we send out this. We always send out a post event survey. Day of the event ends. Send the survey out and there's a contest happening, I think, between two panels for panel of the event. And it's down to you.
00:15:20.462 - 00:15:28.270, Speaker A: And who else was on your panel? Pranav from Vanek, Jordy Alexander and what's his.
00:15:28.302 - 00:15:29.074, Speaker B: Jordy.
00:15:29.854 - 00:15:42.874, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a debate happening or there's a contest happening. It's that panel. People are voting on his panel of the event verse the, the live Thousand X podcast with Avi and Jonah and Mike. So it's a, he's a heated battle.
00:15:43.414 - 00:15:50.718, Speaker B: I, I pinged you after I said, hey, we oughta, we missed the shot to do a live podcast. And if I were such a botch.
00:15:50.806 - 00:15:52.038, Speaker A: That was a botch, I would have.
00:15:52.086 - 00:16:28.344, Speaker B: I would have liked it because who doesn't like to talk for more? No kidding. Because I think it would be nice to have a. There are a lot of fun managers there. A lot of them. When you think about observations, most of them are still predominantly skewed to allocating to Ethereum. I continue to believe the most funds in this space don't have or are under allocated to Solana and other ecosystems, but specifically Solana. And it would have been nice to have a, for instance, a debate with Vance from framework or someone else.
00:16:28.344 - 00:17:18.358, Speaker B: And I'll take the alternative and have kind of like those, you see these type of debates in like zone conferences and other type of conferences, like, all hedge fund managers show up and like, you have these debates or venture capital show up. But I feel like that's an opportunity. I'm kind of jumping ahead here, but I left the event with ideas of how to make this podcast better. Also really grateful for listeners. We have a really engaged audience, but I think we can take it further. The North Star for this podcast has always been, how do we, for me, how can we make this industry better? Because we felt at the time, and still do that we can push the, raise the bar for educational content. Of course, we both invest.
00:17:18.358 - 00:18:05.228, Speaker B: We have biases. We try to be upfront about them, but we like to bring in people that are doing interesting things, primarily founders and other investors to challenge our views, to have this healthy debate and discussion. Right. And so I think there's an opportunity to carve out that, like, you know, I would ask people, hey, would you like to see a. Our best episodes historically have been where we bring, like, Avi Cho and Haseed, for instance. Now, those guys historically tend to agree on a lot of things, but make a point of bringing, you know, maybe more of a debate format where we can have one discussion topic, just one. Right? And I think there are two or three that are, as you say, like, hot narratives.
00:18:05.228 - 00:18:54.304, Speaker B: Hey, is restaking going to introduce more risk existential one, perhaps, to ethereum? Hey, let's have a debate about that. Let's have the Eigen guys. Let's have people that take the opposite, you know, the scaling or the Solana versus Ethereum. Let's have a debate about that. I was having an. I guess the last point I'll mention is a part of what the reason why I like going to conferences is to understand the state of kind of just generally the market and market participants. I came away, I had this thesis, and I came away confirming, validating some of that thesis that, like, most people don't put in the work, including founders.
00:18:54.304 - 00:19:22.240, Speaker B: And there's a lot of superficiality in the industry. I'm not the most technical person. I understand that. But I. I think part of doing this podcast allows us to constantly, like, we. We can't go on limb and say dumb shit because we're gonna be chewed up by everyone. And so part of being public about it is you sort of maintain a level of intellectual honesty, and you get called on bullshit really quickly.
00:19:22.240 - 00:19:39.226, Speaker B: But I was a bit shocked, but also not shocked, because I've had it, like, lurking as an idea, is that most people, like, for instance, someone was very critical of Solana. I'm like, okay, when's the last time you, like, tried? When's the last time? All right, hold on. I'm gonna change you, dude.
00:19:39.250 - 00:19:41.402, Speaker A: What is this? What is this man doing in the.
00:19:41.418 - 00:19:46.014, Speaker B: Back on a treadmill? This library at this lodge?
00:19:48.354 - 00:19:52.254, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
00:19:52.794 - 00:20:23.582, Speaker B: Yes. It's this idea of, like, how much work do people put it? And look, clearly not everyone puts in the work. And there's a lot of luck. There's skill and there's luck. Right? When you think about, like, why are you successful? Well, someone might have listened to the podcast with Joe Bonk, chose to, you know, and that was, you know, you could argue that's a bit of luck. That's, you know, timing, whatever. But, um, yeah, for instance, someone comes out and says, hey, I think Solana is sort of like a whatever, a VC coin.
00:20:23.582 - 00:20:45.010, Speaker B: There's a lot of meme coin activity there. It's gonna subside. And as soon as it subsides, salon is go, go. Gonna go down. I'm like, all right, well, how many apps have you tried in salon crickets? Okay, great. So another one comes out and says, oh, bear chain is super risky. I'm like, why? I'm interested.
00:20:45.010 - 00:21:12.554, Speaker B: Of course I don't tell them. I heard it from two people, two prominent front managers. I'm like, why enlighten me without telling that I was a seed investor or asking. Did you tune into the podcast that we recorded, Smokey? No. Like, okay, so what don't you like about it? Well, proof of liquidity is, uh, so and so. I'm like, can you articulate to me what proof of liquidity is? Couldn't. And then they're like, his whole argument was like, it's in a non team.
00:21:12.554 - 00:21:31.578, Speaker B: I'm like, okay, you might all. You probably also hate bitcoin, right? He's like, what do you mean? I'm like, well, Satoshi is not. It's like, well, it's different. I'm like, okay, well, but is it like. I don't know. So, like, there's this fun to deconstruct all these, like, logical fallacies of, like, people just, like, go on limb and say dumb shit. And I think there's a lot of that in the space.
00:21:31.578 - 00:21:39.374, Speaker B: So I came out really invigorated to. To be more of that. And I think last year, we both, you and I, felt that there was an opportunity to do that.
00:21:41.114 - 00:21:44.050, Speaker A: I was next to you in one of those conversations. You came out swinging.
00:21:44.162 - 00:21:49.010, Speaker B: I'll chew. I'll choose someone out. If you haven't done the work, I'm now going to make a point of.
00:21:49.202 - 00:21:54.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I was, um. I know that part. Yeah, there's interesting.
00:21:55.134 - 00:21:59.854, Speaker B: Usually I don't, because, like, when you interview a founder, I think there's.
00:21:59.894 - 00:22:16.888, Speaker A: I couldn't tell how frustrated you were. Like, I actually sensed, like, a bit of frustration from you, and I was like, is this because you have big bags in this thing or because you're frustrated they haven't done the work, but they're kind of talking like they've done the work. Like, where is this coming from? Santu?
00:22:17.046 - 00:22:18.740, Speaker B: I ultimately know. I'm actually like, really?
00:22:18.772 - 00:22:21.076, Speaker A: I know the exact conversation you're talking about.
00:22:21.260 - 00:22:39.824, Speaker B: So I'm actually really, as an investor, I get really excited about that, because that's why you make money. When people don't do the work and they dismiss something. It's sort of like that. Tell me something you believe in today. There's gonna be obvious. You know, of course I have my views on bear out. But I wasn't.
00:22:39.824 - 00:23:09.986, Speaker B: Do I know everything about bear up? No, but it is interesting to observe how people just come to conclusions really quickly. And I think that doesn't happen in crypto. Just in crypto. But I do think that there were in this state where, like, people. It's hard to put it in perspective. Like, I just generally think that most people don't do the work and come to conclusions really quickly, whereas I don't allow yourself to process more information. Like, this guy just kind of went on and swinging.
00:23:09.986 - 00:23:39.958, Speaker B: I'm like, bear is super risky. I'm like, okay, well, let's deconstruct that. And, like, within two questions, his whole argument fell apart. I'm like, well, as opposed to just doing that, maybe just ask the question. Right. And, like, if you can delay as a general framework and let me know if you disagree with this, if you can delay coming to a conclusion about a person or an idea or a project, it's probably useful because why would you like. Just, no one's, like, forcing.
00:23:39.958 - 00:24:02.514, Speaker B: No one's putting a gun in your hand saying bear, chain, bullish, or bearish. It's like, no, like, you can take your time to form an opinion and most people just don't take that. Like, don't allow themselves to process more information. So it was an interesting conversation, for sure. Historically, I would have just, like, let it slip, but I just was like, all right, I'm gonna try different tactics.
00:24:03.374 - 00:24:35.730, Speaker A: I think there's a. All right, here's one thing I noticed talking. I caught up with a lot of founder friends in London who I just hadn't seen in a long time. A lot of people who started companies around the same time as blockworks, like 2017, 2018. I think there's a real sense of, first off, there's a real sense of exhaustion with most founders, I would say, in the industry, with most people in general, we're hitting that part of the bull market where it's just like, you wake up, you've got 70 telegrams, you've got 400 slack messages. You went to bed with inbox zero. Now you've got like, you know, 350 email.
00:24:35.730 - 00:25:32.118, Speaker A: Like, it was just like a re. And, you know, and then meanwhile, like, you open Twitter, you're trying to do the hard work at the company, you open Twitter and, like, everyone's making millions of dollars on boom or whatever it is, right? So, like, I think there's a sense of exhaustion with a lot of folks that, first off, just exhaustion. Second thing, I think that there is is a frustration with where we've entered the part of the cycle where there's new people in crypto coming in, and a lot of that is great because we want to onboard new people. But then there's some people who I think start companies in crypto for all the wrong reasons, is I've actually shifted. The questions I ask when angel investing now, I used to ask, what's the valuation? Who do you think of as the competitors? What's the unique strategy? The first question I now ask is, what, what are you doing? Why are you in crypto? What are you doing? Why didn't you come in in 2017? Why didn't you come in 2021?
00:25:32.206 - 00:25:33.286, Speaker B: What's your end game?
00:25:33.430 - 00:26:16.264, Speaker A: Like? What do you. Why, why now? And, um, it's been, I think, behind the scenes, what's happening with a lot of founders is there's actually a lot of frustration by people who see people in it for the wrong reasons, who then take off on Twitter, by the way, not bear chain. I will say I was wrong on Barachain, and I ended up spending a lot of time with both you and the framework guys, Michael and Vance, and you guys all convinced me otherwise on bear chain stuff. But there are some companies that are taking off on Twitter and catching a narrative that behind the scenes, if you talk to the founder, they're really in it for the wrong reason. So I do think there's some of that, but it is.
00:26:16.304 - 00:26:49.390, Speaker B: I mean, the, the frustrations I've heard over the years are here I am trying to, like, reinvent the financial system, and then comes a meme coin that is worth, like, more than all of Defi. And it's like, I was critical of meme coins in the past for that reason. I felt that there were fraction. I felt that they were making a mockery of the space. And now, you know, a lot of my panel, I was, I've actually shifted my opinion on it quite a bit. A lot. And I think you need to pay attention to things that are catching on.
00:26:49.390 - 00:26:58.006, Speaker B: And I've sort of, who cares what I think? It's like, why am I imposing? I sort of, at one point, I.
00:26:58.030 - 00:27:00.006, Speaker A: Said, why am I imposing?
00:27:00.030 - 00:27:51.436, Speaker B: My worldview of what has value? Like, if people clearly find entertainment value, well, who am I to say that that's good or bad? I think ultimately, like, I don't know, we, we have a lot of. I would encourage people to have less opinions about stuff. I think constantly you get put in a spot, whether you're in a dinner conversation or you're with friends or whatever. And it's always like, okay, what do you think about this or that or the elections or it's like, like, it's okay to say, I don't know. And I've started to do that more and more. And so, like, you know, I think it just comes from a place where you're not supposed to know most things, and it's actually just better to ask more questions. The more important thing that I think I agree with you is, so what do you do about it? You can't really change that, right.
00:27:51.436 - 00:28:10.652, Speaker B: It happens in every cycle. Not just in crypto. In crypto, I think you see it more visibly. Right. Because crypto, Twitter, and you see the ROM projects get attention. Or there was a time where BNB had more transaction pancakeswap all of a sudden had more transactions than uniswap. And is that good or bad? Like, I don't know.
00:28:10.652 - 00:28:11.316, Speaker B: I'm neutral.
00:28:11.420 - 00:28:12.172, Speaker A: It just is.
00:28:12.268 - 00:28:41.754, Speaker B: All I care about is more onboarding. What I think is different now is that I think we have really useful projects. And so anyways, yeah. One other thing that I kept getting asked is how can we be relevant this cycle? I think there is a sense of lack of relevance from certain founders that have been it for a while, is sort of trying to navigate the space.
00:28:42.934 - 00:28:47.074, Speaker A: Especially some of the older Defi founders, I would say. Yeah.
00:28:47.694 - 00:29:40.250, Speaker B: And you know what my response to that was? Well, what is your strategy to go on, Solana, what is your strategy to go on move based language like DeFi likely going to live and be very successful in a move based chain, whether it's aptos or sui or se, or something like movement, just because I believe it's a safer thing. So, yeah, I think it's a very interesting time in the market. Forget about the cycle part. It's more of, and I've, a lot of my Solana thesis is distilled in this idea that finally we're going to start seeing a lot of traction in certain applications, and for the first time, it's going to become more apparent of which chains can actually support credible adoption versus not. And, and that flywheel is just going to make it more and more apparent. I don't think. I don't know.
00:29:40.250 - 00:29:59.524, Speaker B: I don't think a lot of people are prepared or positioned for that eventuality. I think it happens sooner and, you know, because we're a lot of. So in the panel and I'll stop talking. I think I've talked enough to someone in the YouTube comments and say, I know someone in the.
00:29:59.564 - 00:30:04.812, Speaker A: If there's not a YouTube comment that says like, santa, you're rambling. Then like, yeah, then you haven't talked enough. There's always like that.
00:30:04.868 - 00:30:42.290, Speaker B: There's always that guy, shout out to that guy, I love you. Please keep me honest. So in the panel, someone's like, you know, there's no products in crypto some institutions, right? It's like, so what is crypto used for? I'm like, you know, I honestly, like, historically, I've struggled with that and I've tried to make up ideas of like, how it's going to be used. I'm like, listen, guys, we've already figured it out. It's like financialization is a massive market. Stable coins. Even if we didn't innovate, the amount of growth that this industry can have on that use case alone, I don't know if you'd agree with this is like orders of magnitude.
00:30:42.482 - 00:31:06.094, Speaker A: I completely agree with that. Alright, I mentioned them in the pre roll. Now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees and we're really excited to have teamed up with arbitrum for the next couple of months on Empire. As the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Arbitrum now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, perps, nfts, gaming, and a whole lot more.
00:31:06.094 - 00:31:39.788, Speaker A: The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions. The way the team got me excited was through portal Arbitrum IO. So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal Arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on a screen, it's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way.
00:31:39.788 - 00:32:34.470, Speaker A: Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks.

There was this, there's this really well written multicoin post. Did you read this thing on the financialization of, you know, quote, everything? Anyways, here's this tweet. Here's this tweet that I sent out, which a bunch of people sent me. This one thing called the attention theory of value that someone named Cheyenne at multicolored end up writing.
00:34:05.554 - 00:34:28.002, Speaker A: But I, but I wrote, I tweeted a couple weeks ago. I said, it's now clear that anything that commands attention online will get financialized. Social accounts, micro bets, platform points, creator content memes, music, all of it. I have no idea if this will be. I think the next question is, will this be good or bad for society? People like pontificate. No. No clue.
00:34:28.002 - 00:34:43.692, Speaker A: No idea. And I don't think it's my role to discern that. No idea if it's good or bad for society. But I have strong conviction that it happens, and I have strong conviction that it happens on chain. And so, by the way, Byron, do you read our daily newsletter?
00:34:43.788 - 00:34:44.504, Speaker B: I do.
00:34:44.924 - 00:35:12.156, Speaker A: Byron had this great piece on meme coins. I just want to read it. It really ties into what you were just talking about with meme coins. So I'm going to read like 30 seconds. It says, some meme coin believers are trying to rebrand them as culture or community coins. Others rationalize that buying meme coins is akin to investing in a brand, or more generally, the attention economy. I even saw one commentary asserting that meme coins are as legitimate as Social Security, because they're both ponzis.
00:35:12.156 - 00:35:46.320, Speaker A: They're all overthinking it. Everything you need to know about meme coins is right in the name. Meme coins are coins that let you trade memes. And in this, they are the purest possible distillation of Keynes beauty contest. The only reason to buy a meme coin is because you think others will buy it after you. And that's an entertaining thing to do, and generally harmless, as long as everyone knows what game they're playing, which I think they do, more so, at least, than with the rest of crypto, when there's a lot of room for confusion. It's harder to explain why someone would want to buy a pure governance token than why someone would buy a meme coin.
00:35:46.320 - 00:36:09.044, Speaker A: And I would even go so far as to argue this is his closer, that meme coins are now one of the most honest things in all of crypto, and also more honest than large parts of tradfi, and at least as honest as a Vegas casino. Amen. I just thought it was like, really well put. I don't know. Don't overthink it. Meme coins are coins that let you trade memes. They are.
00:36:09.044 - 00:36:20.464, Speaker A: Keynes beauty contest. Right. I think that beauty contest references judges voting on who they think that the other judges are going to think is the, you know, has the most beautiful face, not who they actually think is the most beautiful face.
00:36:21.364 - 00:36:51.868, Speaker B: Beautifully said. People forget. But the key novelty of crypto is digital scarcity and property. And you've now been able to encapsulate a meme in a form of a token, and, you know, that's a pure expression. A lot of these meme coins have all the circulating supply. There's no single holder that owns, you know, more than five, seven, greater than 10%. You know, it's out there, it's on the wild, and, you know, it's crypto is from pure capitalist expression, pure market.
00:36:51.868 - 00:36:59.974, Speaker B: That's open 24 7365. It's actually really interesting. It is actually also applicable to some like prediction markets, like what you're seeing with bowdoin and Trump. Fascinating.
00:37:00.054 - 00:37:01.834, Speaker A: Yeah, really fascinating.
00:37:02.574 - 00:37:32.494, Speaker B: I would go as far, it's going to be quite interesting in the elections in terms of how do these things actually trade. Of course, you have some poly market on the elections, which is commanding a lot of liquidity, like 92 million or so yesterday that I checked. But contrast that to just a meme coin that represents Trump or bowdoin, I guess, Biden and how that trades. I think if you're a political pundit or statistician, I think it's more accurate than a survey.
00:37:32.654 - 00:37:33.158, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:33.246 - 00:37:48.394, Speaker B: It's just looking at number holders and people, voter turnout is low. Has been, always has been. But when you introduce, when people have a stake in the game, they have a vested interest. And so that's, I think, a very pure expression of information.
00:37:48.734 - 00:38:22.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I botched it. I forgot to tell people at the top of this, speaking of newsletter, and Byron empires launched a newsletter. Very excited. Yeah, we are doing that. We are launching a newsletter. So you will be listening to this episode on Tuesday, March 26 is when it comes out and the week after next Tuesday, April 2, we are launching a newsletter. So if you guys want to read the inaugural newsletter that we send out, you can subscribe, you can link in show notes or whatever our producer wants you to do.
00:38:22.634 - 00:38:56.734, Speaker A: Yeah, if you're Joseph, put a link somewhere in the show notes. Basically, the reason we're launching this is twofold. One, I still don't feel like there's a newsletter that I, so we have this daily newsletter. Byron puts it out every day at seven. It's his thoughts on like the market. He's a trader for many years, like very great thoughts, kind of pontificating on what's going on. There's no morning newsletter that I read that I actually believe adds value.
00:38:56.734 - 00:39:25.872, Speaker A: A lot of them are like, you know, a lot of the other media companies put these things out in the morning that are like, here's the news of the day. Doesn't give me anything, though, doesn't give me any insights. It doesn't go a layer deeper on any of the news stories. So Empire newsletter is going to be every single morning, Monday through Friday, five days a week, giving you the news of the day with, and going one layer deeper. And so that's going to be, we've got a full team working on this thing. So every single day, 07:00 a.m. And Santi and I are going to use it if Santi wants.
00:39:25.872 - 00:39:47.936, Speaker A: I'm going to be writing. I think there's a lot of. Yeah, sometimes, yeah, put you on the spot there. Sometimes I have things that I aren't right for a tweet and they're not right for a podcast. And I end up maybe sometimes just doing these, like, long threads on them, but then I kind of have to put it into Twitter format and I actually write a good amount, but just kind of on my own. I'm going to be putting those thoughts into the newsletter. I might write once a week.
00:39:47.936 - 00:39:58.672, Speaker A: I might write once every other week. Santi might. I don't know when Santi is going to do it, but either way, it's Monday through Friday, five days a week with some guest posts from Santi and me. So, yeah, go, go subscribe, go click that.
00:39:58.688 - 00:40:10.250, Speaker B: Like Jason. Jason. I like Jason so much because he makes me do things. And I've been punting this, going back, reactivating my substack, and this is just going to be the way to do it.
00:40:10.402 - 00:40:32.488, Speaker A: So also, I have to give a big shout out to composable finance. They shout out Henry over there. They're taking a leap of faith on the Empire brand and on us, too. They're actually the first sponsors of the Empire newsletter, so big shout out to composable and what they're working on, it's composable finance. Yeah, you guys should go check them out.
00:40:32.546 - 00:40:34.908, Speaker B: I had a chance to meet in London, so that was great.
00:40:35.076 - 00:40:55.852, Speaker A: Yeah, I also had a great meeting with Henry. So I would say, okay, so big themes of Das. So meme coins, obviously. I would say there's like, stable coins. If you want to talk about that crypto's killer use case. There was a lot of talk about stable coins. Tokenization, actually.
00:40:55.852 - 00:41:13.156, Speaker A: Tokenization rwas for an institutional event, weren't as talked about. I think everyone's kind of bored and sick of it. ETF's a lot of talk about ETF's. They've kind of like. I think they've. People kind of understand what the ETF's are good for at this point. They give institutions exposure to crypto.
00:41:13.156 - 00:41:25.492, Speaker A: They do it on terms that institutions can come, can understand. They will drive huge growth in asset prices. They will not be a major catalyst for on chain participation. That's. There's kind of this consensus that I.
00:41:25.508 - 00:41:45.496, Speaker B: Think they're gonna lie, don't necessarily agree on, but, yeah, I mean, it's sort of a law of large numbers. Like, if you believe stable coins reach a couple trillion, then it's always that, not stable coins.
00:41:45.600 - 00:41:47.368, Speaker A: ETF's. Oh, the ETF.
00:41:47.416 - 00:41:47.896, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:41:48.000 - 00:41:51.520, Speaker A: ETF's. No, stable coins are all. No, no, stable coins are the.
00:41:51.672 - 00:42:05.524, Speaker B: Okay, so even that. Right. I mean, it's sort of. Can you point to most people that, like, it's difficult because ETF's are not around, but like the bot one thing and then kind of stop there?
00:42:07.184 - 00:42:25.884, Speaker A: Um, no, I think that's a good point. Like, bitcoin is kind of the gateway drug. So I maybe, let me rephrase it. I don't think there'll be a, I think there will be a huge driver in growing asset prices this cycle. I don't think there'll be a huge driver in growing on chain participation this cycle with star.
00:42:26.004 - 00:42:27.184, Speaker B: That I agree with.
00:42:28.044 - 00:42:50.014, Speaker A: Um, I think a lot of talk about, like, ETH. ETF. Um, yeah, a lot of talk about that. The, uh, staking. Staking was a big staking and restaking. It was really interesting hearing from the financial, like, from the big players about how they think about staking and restaking. I always think of these, like, ideas as, like, these crypto native ideas.
00:42:50.014 - 00:43:10.666, Speaker A: Some of the world's largest asset managers saying, quote, staking and restaking will reshape financial products forever. Um, and like that, you know, I, I just thought it was like, yeah, there's kind of this consensus that institutions are going to do some sort of staking. Um, I think like a. Yeah, was.
00:43:10.690 - 00:43:17.200, Speaker B: It blackrock that updated or fidelity, I forget which one updated their ETF application recently to include staking.
00:43:17.322 - 00:43:35.812, Speaker A: To include staking. I forget which one. But, you know, someone had this, quote, staking. They said staking. We understand internally that staking is a core process for securing blockchains. We don't just think of it as a money making activity. We think of it as a core process for securing blockchains.
00:43:35.812 - 00:43:49.624, Speaker A: And we just like, so we are doing the work and we are getting some return for doing work. And like, that's staking at its simplest. At its simplest, like, description. And I just thought it was cool to hear, hear these folks understand it like this.
00:43:50.124 - 00:43:59.948, Speaker B: Yeah, that's. I will say. I mean, as a general comment, the, the sophistication of institutions understanding the SASA class has gone up dramatically.
00:44:00.116 - 00:44:00.884, Speaker A: Dramatically.
00:44:01.004 - 00:44:36.572, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of them have done the work. I think there are, there is a subset that has been lurking in the closet because they haven't felt comfortable saying that they believe in this or like it. And all of a sudden, with an ETF, the career risk, the reputation risk goes down dramatically. And that's very refreshing because I even heard it from one listener that works at a pretty prominent bank, and he said, listen, everyone loves crypto. Everyone. And I come to these events, they're all talking about it. They love it.
00:44:36.572 - 00:45:05.470, Speaker B: They like the meme coins, they're constantly paying attention. But there is still this tension, right. And, you know, like, what you can, you know, the career risk of. There's still some of that. I think it continues to go away as we have more ETF's and this becomes just in the narrative. I mean, it just. It's been in the narrative for a long time, but it's the career risk, the reputation risk, right.
00:45:05.470 - 00:45:27.282, Speaker B: That, oh, you're in crypto. Well, Hokkad or like FTX. God, you know, geez, all you guys were just a bunch of wild west cowboys running around, you know, slinging it. Now, part of, I think, what this industry's challenged with is lack of media companies at scale. Like, I think there is a very subset of.
00:45:27.418 - 00:45:29.214, Speaker A: Yeah, why isn't anyone building that?
00:45:30.114 - 00:46:15.772, Speaker B: Right. You know, well, what I'm trying to, like, what my frustration was like when I would pitch crypto to my former colleagues at Sage View or JPMorgan. They're like, they would very quickly point me to their primary source of knowledge or understanding what was happening in the space, like a podcast. That was not something that I would listen to or encourage people to listen to. There was just shilling a bunch of bags or, I mean, I think Bloomberg has gotten quite better over the years, but in the early days, it was just like, the coverage that it got was like, only reporting on negative stuff or the Financial Times. Right. That, you know, it was largely just sensationalism.
00:46:15.772 - 00:46:36.134, Speaker B: And crypto has a lot of that. So I get it. I mean, it drives attention, but, you know, I think we've become better, but I think there's still a huge opportunity to continue to grow and present crypto in a more objective way and not just the more sensational, like headlines. Right. That drive mean, like attention.
00:46:36.474 - 00:47:08.028, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they'll be. Yeah, I'm optimistic they'll be better. So Bloomberg, I think, laid off most of their. There's still not crypto reporters. They laid off a lot of their crypto product team at the absolute bottom, or I think it was September, October 2023. They laid off a lot of their crypto terminal team, like, for the terminal. And I was just like, oh, gosh, just pure capitulation.
00:47:08.116 - 00:47:09.584, Speaker B: That's a costly mistake.
00:47:10.084 - 00:47:35.600, Speaker A: So Mike and I used to this funny story about Bloomberg. Mike and I used to go into Bloomberg once every, like, six months and give a talk to their team, and we debated if we should do this. And we were like, ah, they're kind of a competitor. But no, never mind. The terminal's not a competitor. We can work with them. So anyways, we go and give a talk about bitcoin and crypto and what we're seeing and stuff, and we'd ask them, what are you guys doing? And I remember this talk by Bloomberg's head of product.
00:47:35.600 - 00:47:50.588, Speaker A: He goes, yeah, for the last two years, bitcoin, this was 2020 and 2021. Bloomberg has been the most searched keyword on the terminal for the last two years. Yeah, this was 20, maybe. 2019 was the most searched term.
00:47:50.636 - 00:47:52.532, Speaker B: It's bitcoin. That was the most searched term on the term.
00:47:52.588 - 00:48:11.128, Speaker A: What did I say? Bit. Yeah, bitcoin is the most searched. Bitcoin is the most searched term on the terminal for sure. So we're considering doing something with bitcoin now. I was like, guys, log works. I need something the next day. We are doing it like, yeah, I.
00:48:11.136 - 00:48:18.360, Speaker B: Guess now it's like Nvidia and AI, but, like, I would think that crypto is still top, top three, top five, probably.
00:48:18.432 - 00:48:27.244, Speaker A: I mean, our, our site, our site traffic. Like, our things are going bonkers right now. It's crazy. What else we talking about?
00:48:28.464 - 00:48:48.856, Speaker B: No, I mean, we wanted to record this pod to talk about the conference takeaways from that. I think we've touched on a lot of those. I don't know if there's anything else you'd want to add in terms of. I mean, my panel specifically was. We could go into that. I mean, I think we covered some elements there, but, no, I would just.
00:48:48.880 - 00:49:16.740, Speaker A: Say, like, the empire meetup was the highlight, and I would just, like, I don't know. I met all these big government people and big asset managers, and, you know, which was cool, like, felt fun and stuff. But, like, truly the highlight was like that kind of grungy bar on Wednesday, meeting a lot of folks, or having people come up to me at the conference being like, I listen to every episode of Empire on my runs. So I would just give, like, yeah. To all. It was a. I see numbers on a screen every day.
00:49:16.740 - 00:49:27.780, Speaker A: I see, like, downloads and streams and YouTube views and random comments saying, santi sucks. Which I know, obviously, and ugly, which I know.
00:49:27.932 - 00:49:33.356, Speaker B: Guys, stop wasting your time. I already know that. Read some wells, but comment somewhere else.
00:49:33.460 - 00:49:48.944, Speaker A: But it was cool, man. It was really cool meeting a lot of you guys and just seeing what you do and, you know, a lot of traffic. Folks who like crypto buy it by night and on weekends. And I was just. It was just awesome. So you guys gave me a lot of. A lot of energy to keep pushing with this.
00:49:49.364 - 00:50:30.700, Speaker B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And I, of course, it's great to hear people are enjoying it, but I would ask most people, hey, what can we do better? And some, a lot, a lot said go deeper on technicals. So we're thinking about that for sure. I think we could add, for instance, episode with Monad, do more of that format and bring on something like John, shout out to John, which I think would be a nice addition to bring on those type of episodes. I think people really liked me talking about my mistakes. I certainly. It can keep talking more and more about that.
00:50:30.732 - 00:50:38.684, Speaker A: People like me talking, rambling. No, people did like that. People. It was actually, I think, our most downloaded episode.
00:50:38.804 - 00:50:47.460, Speaker B: I actually told people, look, as soon as we recorded that podcast, I told Jason and Joseph, the producer said, guys, I hated this podcast. We gotta redo it.
00:50:47.492 - 00:50:49.584, Speaker A: You. Oh, yes. Auntie didn't want to run it.
00:50:50.684 - 00:51:15.868, Speaker B: But hey, look, I think it was a. What people appreciate is I feel more comfortable. Part of the frustration at times with crypto is that and social media and everything, but is that you just only see one side of a person or of a company, of a founder, for instance, once they're successful. But tell me, like how you got there. Tell me more about. It's incredibly difficult. Like, I want to hear specific stories and make it relatable.
00:51:15.868 - 00:51:41.400, Speaker B: I hope that we can make this podcast more relatable because we all started from zero in crypto in our understanding of it. We got so much help along the way. We made so many mistakes. So I'm all for making more of that type of content. Seems like people enjoy it. So I'm excited to continue to go deeper and call it stream of consciousness therapy, whatever it is. There's a lot of thoughts that I have there to continue to share and open book.
00:51:41.400 - 00:52:24.308, Speaker B: I made a lot of mistakes and that's ultimately I do it because I will learn right, open sourcing my process and coming to conclusions faster. A big part of my Solana thesis would be more vocal about it, help me understand things much, much faster. Like, I have less of a problem looking like an idiot and being wrong, because ultimately it helps me be right in a meaningful way. If I can correct, if I can adjust, and if we can do that in real time, I think it would be great for people, especially as this industry changes so much. Right? I mean, it's. It's pretty shocking and daunting that it's like, it's incredibly hard to keep up. It's hard not to feel constant sense of, like, anxiety around that.
00:52:24.308 - 00:52:27.624, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's a good thing, I guess the industry's growing.
00:52:27.924 - 00:52:33.540, Speaker A: It is. All right, let's call it. Go subscribe to the newsletter, link in.
00:52:33.572 - 00:52:38.970, Speaker B: The show notes piece of content. Got two books because I was traveling.
00:52:39.082 - 00:52:40.842, Speaker A: Oh, I have a book, too. I have a book.
00:52:40.898 - 00:52:59.322, Speaker B: London airport. The nice thing about London is you go to these bookstores. Wh what is it? Ws Smith or wh Smith on the airport. And see, it's always like the buy one, get free. And so anyways, I bought this formula car. I think it's a book about Formula one. Really fun.
00:52:59.322 - 00:53:06.266, Speaker B: Kind of like a really good inside story. If you like, drive to survive. The book is pretty cool. The second one, why don't you just.
00:53:06.290 - 00:53:07.534, Speaker A: Ask the guys in person?
00:53:08.274 - 00:53:51.484, Speaker B: What was that? And the second one was, yes, actually, the second one is. I actually, for what? I was shamed to say this, but I hadn't read Chris Dixon's read, write own, and really great. I mean, Chris has always been, in my mind, the person I've learned probably the most. He just has a way of drawing from prior, like the Internet and the evolution of the Internet, just making analogies. I know they're not perfect, and others get subset of people, but I actually think it's the way people learn. And he. If you could pick one voice, one, like, voice of this industry, a chief marketing officer, like, it would be in my mind.
00:53:51.524 - 00:53:55.052, Speaker A: Chris, I agree with that. I agree. I know.
00:53:55.188 - 00:54:01.654, Speaker B: Really good. And then continue to watch Shogun. Honestly, it keeps getting better. And I'm a big fan of James Clavella Shogun.
00:54:02.954 - 00:54:14.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm on. I think I'm on f five. Also, three body problem, which, like, it's gonna be the. It's, it's the one, jason, I mean.
00:54:15.154 - 00:54:17.690, Speaker B: May I remind you that you went on saying that.
00:54:17.722 - 00:54:36.726, Speaker A: What was that other show? Well, okay, three body. Okay, so first off, first let. First off, let me tell you, one of my best friends said three body problems. This is like seven, five years ago now, you, favorite trilogy of all time. You gotta blame the Fred trilogy of all time. Then mike. Mike read it.
00:54:36.726 - 00:54:53.046, Speaker A: Mike, I think mike read the whole trilogy, and he's like, this is like the best, best book. Like, best books ever. And then, and then mike said the shows are good. Which mike is a ridiculous movie and tv nerd. Yeah. So now I will watch it. Okay.
00:54:53.110 - 00:54:54.438, Speaker B: Okay. Independent notes.
00:54:54.526 - 00:54:56.834, Speaker A: Verified. Verified.
00:54:57.774 - 00:55:00.294, Speaker B: The time to watch it.
00:55:00.834 - 00:55:01.274, Speaker A: I do.
00:55:01.314 - 00:55:06.762, Speaker B: I do agree. Mike is a huge content consumer, and it's remarkable.
00:55:06.858 - 00:55:18.134, Speaker A: Do you know that? You know, he probably listens to four podcasts a day. He listens to podcasts while he works, which is, like, a remarkable feat.
00:55:19.114 - 00:55:20.458, Speaker B: Goodness.
00:55:20.626 - 00:55:21.322, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:21.458 - 00:55:22.738, Speaker B: I need a level up.
00:55:22.866 - 00:55:33.110, Speaker A: It's crazy. Hell, it's. I mean, mike, shout out you if you're listening. Like, he. Like, he. So, okay. Rest is history came at which we both like this history podcast called rest is history.
00:55:33.110 - 00:55:49.102, Speaker A: They came out with the Titanic series. He had listened to all of those, plus every crypto podcast that blockworks had put out that week. And we were, like, three days into the week, I was like, my guy. That's like, 14 shows in three days. Yeah. And it's remarkable. My book.
00:55:49.102 - 00:56:16.174, Speaker A: My book is what's our problem? It's maybe the best, one of the best blogs on the Internet called wait, but why? Oh, yeah, the wait, but why? Writer put out a. Put out a book called what's our problem? It's kind of just like an analysis of modern times, I would say, of just, like, how the hell did we get into, like, it feels like the world's been flipped upside down. Like, how the hell did we get here?
00:56:17.034 - 00:56:17.894, Speaker B: I hate.
00:56:18.704 - 00:56:24.000, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you hate the times we live in or the analysis of the times that we live in.
00:56:24.032 - 00:56:28.364, Speaker B: No, no. The times, like, it's just the wokeness of it all.
00:56:28.704 - 00:57:08.978, Speaker A: Here's basically here, like, I think he puts his finger on the problem, which is, like, there's this whole group of people who used to identify as really left. Basically. There's this whole group of, like, 25 to 40 year olds who no longer identify with either political party. Either they're republic, they grew up republican, but they don't, like, kind of agree with Trump, and they don't like Trump's world. Or they grew up liberal and democratic, but they have, like, so far disagree with, like, woke culture and, like, Bernie Bros and AOC and a lot of that kind of stuff. And that's basically both of those buckets are, like, my friend group. Like, either people grew up republican and.
00:57:08.978 - 00:57:34.116, Speaker A: But they're like, I really just don't like Trump, or they grew up Democrat and they're like, honestly, like, I'm just, I just can't get behind voting for Biden or I can't, you know, I just can't get behind, like, the woke liberals or whatever you want to say, and he puts his finger on like, what the hell happened here? How did we get here? And what should we, how should we think about it? It's a quick read. I'm doing, I'm doing it on, I'm almost done with it on audible. I would recommend. Yeah, nice.
00:57:34.260 - 00:57:44.998, Speaker B: I'll definitely pick that up. It's a subject that I'm very interested in, so let's call that hopefully. Thanks for the invite to Das, I enjoyed it. Um, a lot to learn and we.
00:57:45.006 - 00:57:48.262, Speaker A: Gotta find something to promote now. Oh, the newsletter, obviously.
