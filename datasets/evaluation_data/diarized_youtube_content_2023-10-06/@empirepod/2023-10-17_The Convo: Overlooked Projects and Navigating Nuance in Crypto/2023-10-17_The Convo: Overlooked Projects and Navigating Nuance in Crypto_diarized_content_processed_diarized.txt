00:00:00.120 - 00:00:22.910, Speaker A: If you're a JPEG collection, your price just collapsed 99%. You know, like, you know, buy a contillo some, you go like, you know, good luck. This is why I think, again, nuance. I am highly skeptical of artists moving into this direction without being very thoughtful. And music royalties on chain like all of that, I want to believe it. I just think it's, it's challenging.
00:00:23.022 - 00:00:45.394, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Toku. If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token. Are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards, or just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team. From easy to use token grant award templates through track investing to managing tax withholdings, make it simple today with Toku.
00:00:47.374 - 00:01:09.156, Speaker A: Welcome back everyone. We ended the last pod. You have Tommy and Ryan again, yet again, two of my favorite people in the space. And we ended the last series pod talking about things that overlooked in a bear market and we were talking about investing. We could continue on that track here. Theres just so many things that weve gone through. Weve invested a number of categories.
00:01:09.156 - 00:01:37.644, Speaker A: Weve gone through multiple cycles. The industry looks very different but yet the same in many ways. Anyways, I guess in that vein we dont want to go too deep on current events. Obviously the front and center is FTX. Theres a lot of things that have come to light that I think a lot of the industry got right at the time things were going down. There's a lot of speculation we can go into that. We can talk about a lot of the different counterparties.
00:01:37.644 - 00:02:15.968, Speaker A: Of course with all this there's FuD that comes up, there's FuD around tether and FTX was very involved in tether and minting USDT. Of course there's some takes that are good, there's other takes that are just and you know, spreading FuD. So I'll kick it off to you, Ryan. I mean maybe along this kind of thread, things that are overlooked, one of the things that we talk about a lot is FoD. It could be paralyzing, but it is also really important to like call out and be, you know, surface the truth and when you see it. So anyways, we were talking about Binance, we were talking about tether. There's the FTX stuff.
00:02:15.968 - 00:02:18.800, Speaker A: I know you wanted to talk about this, so I'll pass it on to you.
00:02:18.992 - 00:03:34.378, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean one of the things that is definitely overlooked in the spaces and we've seen this and we're all paying the bill is the collateral damage of bad actors. And the solution, over time is to lift up some of the citizen journalism that calls out things that don't quite add up. You know, Jesse from Kraken this past week went on record stating that it was very obvious to them that just like the two plus two equals four, math did not add up with respect to FTX. And they knew, because they knew their own business, that there was something amiss. Brian Armstrong has said the same, that he knew FTX's volumes, and because of that, their expenses, like there was something very clearly amiss. And I think hopefully, as we move forward, we pay attention and people are willing to do the call outs. It's tough to put yourself out there and call out a powerful organization that could potentially be operating correctly.
00:03:34.378 - 00:04:28.324, Speaker C: Could potentially not be operating correctly. This part we've discussed, what are the implications of whether binance is doing some things incorrectly with respect to their chain or with respect to their exchange? A lot of people have questions about tether, and this is an interesting thing, because, yes, you need to call out the organizations that are potentially doing incorrect things, but then there is a nuance that I think needs to prevail. So, for example, I have a lot of questions about binance, and I'm very concerned. I'm not touching anything binance at this moment. Tether, on the other hand, I've sat with Paulo. I know this organization to just be one of the best companies in crypto. It's certainly one of the most profitable companies in crypto.
00:04:28.324 - 00:05:29.544, Speaker C: And my own analysis of it is that most of the FUD is being driven from competitors that wish they had such an amazing business. Tether throws off three to $5 billion free cash flow every single year. It is an extraordinary business, and a lot of people wish they had that. That causes the like, oh, are they collateralized? Are they not? The reality is that they're collateralized with off chain assets fully, and then they're even more collateralized. Probably close to 100 and 8200 percent collateralized when you add in their bitcoin position and their crypto position. So I actually look at it as a very, very de risked organization that's different than FTX, that's different than binance. And we have to have that nuance and understanding that, like, not all big off chain organizations in the space are, are bad.
00:05:29.544 - 00:05:48.384, Speaker C: But when we do see something that we are concerned about, that we investigate it further. And I did that with tether, and I came out the other side being like, actually, you know what? This is a really great business. And they've done a great job. So, yeah, I don't know. What do you guys think?
00:05:49.084 - 00:06:19.284, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, one of the crazy things is it kind of comes down to memory. We have Mount Gox and yet fast forward 910 years and we have FTX, and nobody really cares about proof of reserves, right? It's like we learn the lesson and then we forget about it, and then we have to learn the lesson all over again. So I don't know what changes this time around, that we're not going to have to learn this lesson again in five years.
00:06:19.884 - 00:06:57.624, Speaker A: That's a really good question. I think I do want to make a distinction. Back to your point, Ryan, on nuance. Mount Gox was an issue where my understanding was that they had a bug in the system where they didn't catch, like, the withdrawal math just wasn't adding up. The people running Mount Gox, you could argue, were incompetent, but I don't think they were doing things in a fraudulent manner, whereas FTX was just, everything that has come out to light is fraudulent. They were taking customer assets and then using them for other purposes, political donations, investments in things like antropic that may or may not pan out and make us all whole. But still, that's fraud.
00:06:57.624 - 00:08:16.078, Speaker A: And so it's a very big, important distinction. The question is, and I think it's a right one and a good one, Tommy, which is there's probably another FTX out there, maybe not to that level of magnitude, but fraud is fraud, and it still hurts people. You could argue that some of the hacks on chain of protocols, were those inside jobs or were they not? Like, there's reentrancy attacks in the code at this point, if you're a project and you have a re entrancy vulnerability in your code base, that's just negligent, borderline fraudulent, to the point that I'm going to be suspicious that it's an inside job, because at this point, there are no excuses if you have this type of stuff. And so, Ryan, I want to go back to something you said, which is really interesting. You mentioned, like, now, of course, after things, after the domino's fall, a lot of people come out and say, we told you so. We knew something was wrong. But how vocal are these people? Like, how vocal was Jesse or Brian publicly? Or maybe they went to regulators and they didn't want to listen because FTX was the charm and was the best and had all the, you know, checked all the boxes for.
00:08:16.078 - 00:08:20.230, Speaker A: I'm just kind of curious how that unfolded you're right.
00:08:20.262 - 00:09:46.124, Speaker C: I mean, I think privately, a lot of us were having this conversation, but none of us really were saying it publicly because at the time, Sam had, you know, an incredible amount of political power. And, like, we're all just trying to make our way in the world, and nobody needs to procure unnecessary fights. Right? And so for another CEO of an exchange to call out a different CEO, like, imagine like Brian Armstrong calling out Jesse or vice versa, there's sort of a decorum of respect that I think most executives confer to other executives in the space that unless you have real evidence, you could be slapped with a, you know, with a slander or libel suit. And that, and that's going to be a distraction. Nobody wants that. But I mean, like, I had conversations with, you know, with you guys talking about how things didn't quite add up with FDX at that time, but we were not, you're correct. And that we were not explicit enough and there weren't enough people really calling it out.
00:09:46.124 - 00:10:13.888, Speaker C: I give them a pass because I understand they're just trying to run their own business. But we clearly need to get beyond that, and we need to, like, we need to self regulate as an, or as an industry. Otherwise, the regulation that we're going to be subject to is going to be, I think, far worse in the end. So hopefully people have more courage next time around and we catch it earlier and we call it out earlier.
00:10:14.056 - 00:10:51.324, Speaker A: Yeah. Tommy, I want to go back to you on things that are overlooked beyond the kind of thought. But what is interesting, Ryan, to your point, is during the testimony of Caroline, she mentioned one of the priorities of Sam was to put regulators onto binance. And I think that might have been the catalyst for CZ to say not only were they looking at the flow that Alameda was transferring into binance to Ar some tokens, but they were huge holders of FTT. And at some point, they probably caught wind of this and they said, enough is enough. And that was really the trigger. I think Sam did a huge damage in the industry.
00:10:51.324 - 00:11:32.276, Speaker A: He was very vocal of Defi, critical of Defi. Naturally, he was against transparency. And I think we're at a very interesting crux here. I hope that even with this whole, like, Israel Palestine situation where people are saying, oh, look at Hamas, they've received crypto, and Senator Warren is being very critical of crypto, whereas the reality is Hamas even told their donors, like God, stop sending bitcoin. It's transparent, and you're going to put a target on your back. And then their donations really cliffed off crypto. But it is really important to be nuanced and just to understand, like, we should be asking all of these organizations, like, hey, proof of reserves, like, just procure them.
00:11:32.276 - 00:12:01.300, Speaker A: There's really no, there's no excuse at this point. Tommy and I, you and I are both investors in this company called test machine. I just saw the demo, like, there should be. And it's like, a company is like building a detection solution to, like, in real time. Like, basically, it's like a model that has been trained to detect certain vulnerabilities in the code. And I think something like that is a fantastic thing, because clearly audits are not enough. Audits and bounties also not enough.
00:12:01.300 - 00:12:35.550, Speaker A: So what else can we do? I think we, as investors, can say, hey, if I'm going to invest in your company, then you need to have these things. You need to have, obviously, audits and bounties, but also use solutions out there to prevent attacks, to close in on the surface area or the potential surface area, and to mitigate exploits and bugs. I think that's really when the investors really, I think the best investors can really say, hey, we're going to do this deal, but you need to do x and y constantly because things can't break.
00:12:35.742 - 00:13:28.394, Speaker C: Preston, do you think that one of the overlooked things in the space today, because of what's happened with vulnerabilities in Defi, as well as the hacks and lack of proof of reserves on chain, is this SaaS era where fireblocks has come out of nowhere and is now, I think, one of the top ten highest valued companies in the space. You guys just mentioned that this new service that comes up, we use hibernative, in fact, for our yielding, we use close to a dozen different services that have different alerts and checkpoints against code and things like that to automate our due diligence on pools and on projects. Do you think, are we seeing the emergence of the SaaS era in crypto?
00:13:29.374 - 00:14:08.726, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, just a couple of things. I mean, to go back to Santiago's point, I do think it is on us to help allocate and secure crypto for the future. Two checks that we're really excited about is one is what Santiago mentioned. Test machine is an AI model built by X DARPa guys, really smart guys, and instead of waiting six months for an audit, a developer plugs in their GitHub code, automatically gets an audit, automatically gets fixes. Right. That's helping to fix the on chain world. The other thing we did recently was Heights Labs, which is an automated automatic evidence graph following a hacker and the flow funds.
00:14:08.726 - 00:14:38.034, Speaker D: You could hand this to a government official and get a subpoena or a warrant ASAP, instead of having to go through this manual process with the larger competitors we all know. So, I don't know. I think it is on us to help do that. And look, there are opportunities to make money there. Then on the flip side, we need to protect the centralized world more. I think we all have a lot of trust in Kraken and Coinbase, but again, we can't just totally trust them because they're the comparison. We need to push for proof reserves, and we have to until we get it.
00:14:39.094 - 00:15:47.334, Speaker C: Yeah. Switching gears, but staying on FTX, a lot of capital allocators had some exposure to it, either capital in FTX or portfolio projects that had treasury and FTX. How are you guys looking at the situation of the otcs with anthropic now? There's been, like, some excitement around recovery. If you look at the history of the space, recovery from bankruptcies, a very long, protracted process, the current OTC is about $38 to $0.40. Do you take that and hope for 150% return profile in ETH over the next two to three years, expecting that the actual payout of FTX will be two to three years down the road? Or do you stay patient and now you're an indirect owner of anthropic, hoping for that to have $100 billion payout, and then you get made whole.
00:15:48.194 - 00:16:15.994, Speaker D: It's kind of wild how anthropic came out of left field to make FTX people whole, but outside the point. I'll take one side here. I would rather take the 40 or $0.50, put it in liquid crypto, and hopefully ride that up. And the reason is maybe a bit different than the money. I just wouldn't want to mentally have to wake up every day for the next two or three years wondering what my payout is going to be. It would just kill my energy and mental state, I think.
00:16:15.994 - 00:16:17.806, Speaker D: Santiago.
00:16:17.830 - 00:16:20.634, Speaker C: Santiago, what's your take on that?
00:16:21.294 - 00:16:24.816, Speaker A: Well, it depends on the kind of person and investor you are.
00:16:24.950 - 00:16:25.220, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:25.252 - 00:16:40.580, Speaker A: Because, you know, sometimes it's like, it's like if you have a locked position in a vacuum, you say, oh, God, yeah, I would have just rode that until, you know, Ethan and sold at 3800, like, marked the top.
00:16:40.772 - 00:16:41.292, Speaker C: Really.
00:16:41.388 - 00:17:03.976, Speaker A: Like some people are just not, are not good at managing their portfolio. I go back to look, I mean, I think these claims traded at the lowest point at $0.08 on the dollar. Right. A couple of weeks or a month into the collapse of FTX. A lot of people picked them up. You have to be wondering.
00:17:03.976 - 00:17:44.724, Speaker A: I mean, I think there's a lot of interest from sophisticated players that are like, savvy in terms of litigation, finance as a category, or even distressed hedge funds out there that are saying, hey, $0.40 on the dollar. They're looking at the book, they're looking at the investments. They feel fairly comfortable. So it depends on the type of investor that you are. I would say, I would side with Tommy here. I know we're supposed to disagree, but I would also take it because I have more confidence in my ability to outperform and manage kind of my own capital versus what worries me here the most is the people that always win in this process is the lawyers.
00:17:44.724 - 00:18:15.644, Speaker A: I mean, they are charging an arm and a leg. It's just to your point, Ryan. I mean, if this process drags out years, there's going to be a material kind of net payout. I say net because gross would be like net, like after expenses, which are really mounting. And I do worry about that. I do think that it's not as simple math as, oh, look, entropic's about 100 billion. Oh, great, we're made whole.
00:18:15.644 - 00:18:25.484, Speaker A: I think it's going to get more and more complicated, although there's a fair amount of. Depends on what you have, too.
00:18:25.524 - 00:18:25.700, Speaker D: Right?
00:18:25.732 - 00:18:53.752, Speaker A: I mean, I don't recall, but I mean, I think people, as part of filing your claim, you obviously had to kind of agree with the amount and stuff. But there's also, I guess there's this, the hack that happened right as the collapse was unfolding. Like, I'm not confident lawyers understand key management better than people that have been in the space for longer. Right. I just don't. I think there's gaps there. I worry about that.
00:18:53.752 - 00:19:02.728, Speaker A: Of their ability to really custody these assets, put them in a safe spot. So for all of those kind of structural reasons, I'd rather take the money now.
00:19:02.776 - 00:19:36.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you guys hit the nail on the head. And the two items that, a, if you're a capital allocator, you need to, to remember and prioritize your mind space and like, you know, focusing on that. And B, as much as FTX was an all time grift, the unwind is going to be just like an absolute fiesta of grift. And these lawyers are just skinning the thing. They have no, have no incentive to push this forward. And if we look.
00:19:38.874 - 00:19:40.434, Speaker D: We need to back a law firm.
00:19:40.514 - 00:19:51.854, Speaker A: Conferences and crypto lawyers have been the most profitable, highest ROI enterprises in the industry. Unless you're like a CD, you wouldn't have outperformed these folks. Yeah.
00:19:53.434 - 00:20:07.894, Speaker C: Good. So other things that you guys are seeing under the radar in this bear market, you know, what are some things that you're excited about that people are not paying enough attention to?
00:20:10.834 - 00:21:06.418, Speaker D: I mean, one thing that I don't have fully fledged out thoughts on, but I'm struggling with is chains backing projects on chains outside of Ethereum and all the ZKe, evms, vms built on top around it, Solana and Cosmos. Like, I'm really struggling to back projects outside of that world because like, as you guys know, like, bear market sucks. Excitement and capital isn't here, users aren't really here. Obviously, we're investing a ways out, but having to take like, normal venture risk and then having to take like, you know, TBD platform risk on top of that, on a Alt L1 or an L two is just. Sorry, an Alt L1. It just gets really hard. And we are seeing a lot of deals on other ecosystems because they all have giant ecosystem funds, they're all backing these projects, so they come across as legit, and they are, they have great founders and stuff.
00:21:06.418 - 00:21:12.054, Speaker D: But I don't know, it just gets hard to get excited about it. Maybe it's basic take, but yeah.
00:21:12.714 - 00:22:16.524, Speaker C: My former partners over the web3 foundation, particularly parity, just announced a major round of layoffs. And I think that that is mostly in recognition of a. There's too much centralization in building out most of these chains. Like, if your team is the only one building out apps and infrastructure and wallets and integrations and things like that, you know, you got to probably look yourself in the mirror and ask if, if you've got organic community. I think in the case of Polkadot, they do have organic community. But the question is, will these projects that have an order of magnitude less developer and community interest have survivability? I think we all have confidence in ETH. It's hit escape velocity, it's hit network effects on developer.
00:22:16.524 - 00:23:16.296, Speaker C: My chair. Then from there, it falls off really, really quickly. I've mentioned to you guys before that we did a piece of analysis a few weeks ago that compared the three generations that we've seen of blockchains or of smart contract scripting platforms. So gen one, Ethereum, Gen two, the ETH killers, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, Dfinity, these guys of the 2017 2018 era, and then gen three, which is like Celestia fuel wormhole and the ZkvM L2s that are like 2020 and beyond projects. And what we observed is that after 180 day, sort of like honeymoon period, the gen two projects underperform ETH over time to a man. Not a single one outperformed the ETH beyond the 180 day mark. Then.
00:23:16.296 - 00:24:07.744, Speaker C: Now we're seeing the gen three pop up and we're seeing continued erosion in those gen two alternative layer ones in favor of these things that integrate with Ethereum natively. So the L2s and then these new layer ones that come out of the box, like with apps, with privacy, with integration with Ethereum. Ethereum. And those are ultimately accruing value to Ethereum while extracting value from the generation two. And we're seeing this slow drip and decline in value and community from gen two blockchains. And that's not a judgment on quality of these gen two blockchains. And many of them may come back with a solana or Polkadot, but at the same time, the vast majority are on a slow march to death.
00:24:07.744 - 00:24:09.824, Speaker C: That's very clear.
00:24:10.724 - 00:25:01.708, Speaker D: Yeah. The other thing too is, I know it's early stages for you're an app developer and you have to figure out where you want to launch a project. Obviously you want money, you want users, you want liquidity, yada, yada, yada. There might be technical reasons why you want to launch your own chain. You potentially launch on Cosmos and people, not cosmos, but it has some of, you know, it houses some of the largest names we know, right? Like Thor chain for cross chain swaps, DydX, Akash. I can go on and on, right? Like these are projects that had real technical reasons to need customizations in their chain and their life. The issue though for the alt chains is the reason to launch there is starting to decrease because now you can launch, or soon you can launch a roll up and post data to Eigen or Celestia and have the customizability you want with the fast speeds and low fees.
00:25:01.708 - 00:25:30.802, Speaker D: So the reasons to launch on Nautil one are now going to go down. Now let's fast forward a year or two instead of doing a roll up and rolling down to Eigen or Celestia, now you launch on a ZKevM or ZKVM and you get the magic of, you know, never having to do a fraud proof ever and having the speed and low cost you need. So I don't know, the arc of technology for me is very much bearish that Alt L1 cycle. To your point, Ron, I mean, I.
00:25:30.818 - 00:26:01.840, Speaker A: Generally agree with you guys. And I made this mistake because I've invested in a lot of these right over the like Filecoin. Brian, both you and I were early investors there, looked at Dfinity. I've invested in a number of others, Brian, because as one, a hedge to ethereum, I generally think we're still very, very early. Two, I also believe that it will be a multi chain world. And one of the things that probably doesn't get talked about enough is the connectivity between chains. And one of the more probably underrated things.
00:26:01.840 - 00:26:40.216, Speaker A: Tommy had a great thread about this cosmos, which is one of the more underrated ecosystems. I think it has great, fantastic tech like IBC took a while to launch. It was hugely delayed, but in spite of all the clusterfuck that happened within tendermint as an organization, they eventually shipped it. And I remember talking to Zaki and Jack because they're continuing to develop. And my question then was, hey, could IBC at some point connect to Ethereum in the same way that it connects different parachains, or not parachains, but different cosmos chains? He's like, absolutely. We're working on that. And it could be.
00:26:40.216 - 00:27:41.406, Speaker A: And so my view here is, at the end of the day, I think we're incredibly early still. Now, if you ask me what I've done, yeah, most of my investments are in Ethereum, because today the mind share both developer and the attention from the retail, if you want to call it that, are institutional, is on Ethereum and salon on the margin, and everything else from that is just drops off dramatically. But I think the, in a fast forward to five years from now, people will not care where these things settle. Ultimately, they will care about the result. And I do think, you know, I think it's too early for me to have absolute certainty, which I never have on anything. But I do think it's still worthwhile to pay attention to things that are happening, particularly in cosmos, particularly also in l two s. But one of the other things that is brought, was brought to my attention during the blockworks conference.
00:27:41.406 - 00:28:30.574, Speaker A: Permissionless was filecoin as a chain that has probably most people are not paying attention to, but they're building some. I mean, they have some fascinating, like, proof of replicability, proof of retrievability. They pioneered some really interesting stuff. And so I do wonder, a lot of these call it left four dead chains have continued to develop, have continued to make progress, and are not on the limelight, but they're very well capitalized, and they have some really smart people working there. So in a world of open source, the question to you both is, should we be paying more attention to stuff like Filecoin or Cosmos? I'm just curious how you think about that.
00:28:33.274 - 00:28:43.498, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, definitely interested. The filecoin side did come up a lot at that conference. I wish there was like a track or a panel to figure out who was building on that. But, Ryan, I know you probably have better thoughts here.
00:28:43.546 - 00:29:50.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the first thing that I observe about Filecoin is that the protocol labs team is the most talent dense team in the entire space. It is extraordinary. It is just such high intellectual horsepower, top to bottom in that group. And just remembering that they've built a number of protocols that are all very useful in the space Lib P, two p, and ipfs, which stores most of the decentralized nfts in the space. Filecoin is an incentive layer on that. I think youll see more interesting protocols come out of protocol labs that share resources over time in really compelling ways, whether that be Internet service or electricity or who knows what else. I personally would never bet against that team because its just, it's just an extraordinary group.
00:29:50.954 - 00:30:44.588, Speaker C: With respect to filecoin in particular, I've been writing checks in the filecoin ecosystem, obviously, since day one. Just wrote another one to glyph a few weeks ago, which offers a yielding on your file coin, which is particularly useful for me. And that's what I like to invest in when I'm using something, and as a user, I find it useful. And then I, you know, and then I write a check there. You know, there seems to be this uptick that's happened in the last, like, not even six months, but kind of four months of people coming back to filecoin. Like there was, you know, there was some hype around other storage layers in the space. And I think that that has mostly proven to be not real.
00:30:44.588 - 00:31:46.214, Speaker C: And people are waking up to the fact that most of the ecosystem uses some form of protocol labs protocol, and thusly, there will be value that will accrue in the protocol labs, like broad ecosystem, whether that be specifically Filecoin or a range of different things, who knows? I just think it's smart for capital allocators to have some exposure there, and the only way they can get exposure is Filecoin at this point. And so you should have some exposure to that, because never bet against Huampaney. Kwambin A has the technical talent of Vitalik, but is also like a rockstar full toolbox CEO. It's, he's you know, he is a unique talent and, and that permeates into his entire organization. And I'm, you know, again, I would never bet against him.
00:31:47.514 - 00:32:42.796, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global team's tokens. From easy to use token grant award templates, through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure. Token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted Token units, token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens for legal, finance and hr teams. It is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens, not to mention the payroll tax obligations, tax reporting in every country that you employ someone. It is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly, and it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments.
00:32:42.796 - 00:32:58.984, Speaker B: Toku makes this simple for leading teams across the space, protocol labs, DyDX Foundation, Mina Foundation, Hedera Gnosis, safe Gitcoin, and a lot more. Reach out to toku@toku.com empire or click the link in the description.
00:33:00.764 - 00:33:51.066, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, Tommy, I wanna ask you this question, like, cause this is perhaps one thing that gets overlooked, which is what part of the stack is like not decentralized. And storage of course, is hugely important overlooked. I think like NFT collectors probably don't even care to think about where the, the storage itself of the file of said JPEG resides. And a lot of it is in a centralized party AWS server. And is that truly decentralized? There are multiple parts of the stack that when people talk about decentralization, they just think of it as one kind of one thing. But as we know, there are different pieces of the stack, whether it's your stablecoin of flavor, well, that's not very decentralized. But hey, are you willing to accept that? As long as you know the risks, and that's okay.
00:33:51.066 - 00:34:40.254, Speaker A: But there are to me the thesis back then when I wrote the check protocol labs, and today still is. Well, yeah, storage is a critical infrastructure layer in the web3 stack that needs to be decentralized. You need to keep this storage or have the ability to keep it provably safe. Decentralized, distributed and decentralized, two different concepts, but you need to have both. I think I'm curious, like if you think there are certain parts of the stack that are overlooked when you think about, hey, we're not really paying much attention here, but we probably should, we should spend more time. I know there's this broad outcry in the industry that we've spent far too many dollars on infrastructure and not enough on consumer applications. I generally think that's true.
00:34:40.254 - 00:34:58.374, Speaker A: But again, the key word of the episode is nuance. There are parts of infrastructure layers that have been neglected, maybe because they're really tough, they will take longer. I'm curious if you agree, disagree with that or if you guys have invested in particular parts of the stack.
00:35:00.474 - 00:35:50.864, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a good question. I mean, not to take your question a different way, but I think the thing that I would love to see in crypto is a website where you input your end product, an NFT or brand, blockfi or whatever you want, and it shows you where you can get rugged, right? Like just front and center. This is where I can get rugged, like it's an NFT creator updating the metadata and linking somewhere else. It's blockfi. Sending all of my assets to FTX. Somewhere where I can figure out. This is the risk I'm taking by using this l two is that there's a centralized sequencer run by a team that's nobody really met them or knows who they are and they're not going to include your transaction and you're screwed.
00:35:50.864 - 00:36:06.074, Speaker D: Something like that, that you can visualize and feel I think would be really helpful. Next bull run when people are just aping into flashing lights in unaudited contracts. Yeah, I'm not sure if that answers your question, but yeah.
00:36:06.734 - 00:36:11.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that would be hugely valuable. Yeah.
00:36:11.262 - 00:37:18.284, Speaker C: I think we could have more decentralized networks for sharing different types of resources. So like helium took a swing at Internet service provision and that was like early experiment and I think we could have more of those. I think we could have some experiments around electricity around it driving networks like a decentralized Uber. There are other resources beyond financial transactions and smart contract execution steps that could occupy block space that would be a intellectually compelling to test and be probably valuable over time. Like one of those resource categories probably gets traction and probably disrupts the traditional business model of that industry. We need more things like Filecoin that are using decentralized networks to share an important resource.
00:37:19.104 - 00:38:03.262, Speaker D: Ryan. So that brings up a curious point. The idea with helium, the idea with filecoin, the idea with the DPIn networks and all this stuff is to move from centralized providers to decentralized providers. Generally that means going from these large data centers that are built ridiculously with retractable roofs and redundant power and backup generators and all this crazy tech to, you know, running your, you know, your latent hardware on your Mac or your phone or stuff like that. Like, is that your thesis? Is that like, that transition will happen because it's cheaper or more scalable or more secure or like, do you view a hybrid model or like that?
00:38:03.278 - 00:39:23.468, Speaker C: Chef, if we, if we go back to, like, what our original thesis was around Filepoint and Satyaba, I imagine you shared this at that time. Is that like, what is the marginal cost of the unused file storage space on your server or your desktop or your laptop? It's zero. So if I get anything for that, it's like actually more efficient use of my capital. And I used to use this example of, well, you may make like kind of tens of dollars per month or per quarter for renting out your storage space on your computer, and that doesn't move the needle for you and I, but that may enable a kid in India to buy a computer and finance it by renting out the storage space over time. And so, like, for that person, it's an incredible enabler. And that's why, you know, that's why this idea that the crowd could outperform data centers over time, it made sense. And very frankly, today we observe that the cost of storing on Filecoin or on ipfs is cheaper than AWS.
00:39:23.468 - 00:40:09.184, Speaker C: So, like, the supply side has worked out. Unfortunately, the demand side has not worked out, and you can make the easy out like, well, the UI isn't there and well, the awareness isn't there, and well, this and that and the other thing. People don't want to buy a crypto token to pay for this, and that doesn't make sense. But I don't think those are actually the reason I don't have like a silver bullet answer of why we haven't solved the demand side. But I do have faith that the demand side will come because the supply side is cheaper. It's cheaper to store on ipfs with Filecoin than it is in AWS, and that will one day find product market fit.
00:40:09.924 - 00:41:08.642, Speaker A: I think it would be. I 100% agree with what you just said, Ryan. I think it would be much more difficult situation if the demand side was not, if the supply side was not there. My thinking going in, and I think one of the mistakes a lot of people have done on these decentralized file storage systems, call it Filecoin IPFs or arweave, is assuming that all storage is going to go on a decentralized fashion. And that's just not correct. I think it is a matter of how much do you value redundancy in your storage layer, meaning it is complementary to your storage. Certain critical, mission critical pieces of data, parts of the web, archiving the web are merit having this added layer of decentralized storage purely for retrievability purposes.
00:41:08.642 - 00:41:46.874, Speaker A: Not everything. Right. But if you have a very secure thing, well, yeah, you would want to, and not only just use Filecoin ipfs, but also pay because there's different tiers of storage that you can have in the system. You could pay more to have it sharded and across different nodes and have higher degree of confidence in the retrievability of said files. And so I think that flexibility is really, is going to, over time, be highly valuable to some players. Right? Yeah. And I think that's overlooked.
00:41:46.874 - 00:42:09.118, Speaker A: I think the, the complexity and the tech behind, like the proof of retrievability is, and I think this retrievability, and there's another proof here of, I said it earlier, but anyways, proof of, proof of replication. Proof of replication and retrievability are two different.
00:42:09.206 - 00:42:10.494, Speaker C: And proof of retrieval.
00:42:10.614 - 00:42:11.078, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:11.166 - 00:42:18.142, Speaker C: So one is like, you can produce this and the other one is like the speed and latency at which you.
00:42:18.158 - 00:42:53.574, Speaker A: Do so, which those two things are really novel and I think not fully appreciated and will end up being useful, as you said, to other different protocols and use cases. So, yeah, I think it's mission critical. The challenge always is the price fair, and how do you value something like Filecoin? One of the interesting projects is sort of like the mining of Filecoin, which is a huge thing, and being able to sell the future mining rewards and whatnot. So anyways, there's a lot of interesting things happening in that ecosystem. I don't following it enough.
00:42:54.754 - 00:44:04.384, Speaker D: Ryan wrote up helium before, and that was the project that I first started mining early on in crypto. Right. The interesting thing is we're talking about how we have supply and we don't have demand. But the crazy part is historically the wireless companies like Verizon, T Mobile, at and T whatever, Sprint, they always had this really long battle with the cable companies because the cable companies provided Internet to your house and they were never able to break into wireless, and the wireless guys provided wireless and were never able to break into wireline. So the whole idea that helium comes along and basically they say, hey, look, you're going to resell your cable, your wireline connection to your house and compete with the wireless companies is an idea that's like breaking decades of industry lock in for like 100 billion dollar companies, right? Like, it's a really interesting point, but I mean, obviously, eventually these wireline companies are going to wake up and be like, look, you're reselling your Internet, pay us. And I think they'll work something out. But it's just an interesting point on demand, and that's $5 a month to join that wireless.
00:44:04.384 - 00:44:05.564, Speaker D: It's definitely cheaper.
00:44:06.424 - 00:44:09.044, Speaker C: What is your take on where helium is?
00:44:09.504 - 00:44:56.602, Speaker D: I haven't been tracking it as closely as I used to, but the things that irked me were the token econ side never made sense to me. The idea of multiple tokens that wrap up to the main helium token, the econ flows, just didn't make sense to me. And if you run the math, it gets difficult. But that being said, on the flip side, they are one of the most successful projects to ever touch the user. They've put a million iot nodes in homes. Now they're doing five g and they're disrupting the entire telco wireline competition segment. The biggest risk, in my opinion, is that the wireline companies, you know, the guys that you pay for your Internet service to your house, come along and they say, look, you know, you're breaking your contract by reselling your Internet.
00:44:56.602 - 00:45:09.658, Speaker D: We're not okay with it. Or they can say, look, this is finally a way we compete with the wireless companies. Give us half your earnings and we're okay with it, right? Something like that. I don't know how it's going to play out, but do you think, do.
00:45:09.666 - 00:45:18.778, Speaker C: You think a Starlink just completely disrupts them together with the wireless companies? And it's just like, yeah, that is a bit point because they just, no, not at all.
00:45:18.826 - 00:45:21.254, Speaker D: That's, that's a real risk. Yeah, for sure.
00:45:21.634 - 00:45:22.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:22.914 - 00:45:46.306, Speaker C: The other question that I have there is, can any project have traction after going 98% peak to trough? Right? Like when you, when you write down 98% or more of community capital, like how do you, how do you recover that community?
00:45:46.450 - 00:46:01.938, Speaker A: You just said filecoin, sir. Filecoin did that. And here we are. File coin at one point was like 1%. Filecoin at one point was like, I, I keep saying this, like up to like 0.75% of the world's gdp when it like, launched. There's still interest.
00:46:01.938 - 00:46:26.754, Speaker A: There's still interest. And you just said something interesting on the, on the, on the supply side. If you have something that wasn't, like, if you're not making anything on that excess storage you want to take, like rationally, game, theoretically, game theory would say you're willing to take up to $0.01 or whatever, right? Because it's better than getting nothing. I think it's the same. True. Not for all ecosystems.
00:46:26.754 - 00:47:13.900, Speaker A: Like, if you're a JPEG collection and your price just collapsed 99%, buy a condil samigo. Good luck. This is why I think, again, nuance. I am highly skeptical of artists moving into this direction without being very thoughtful. And music royalties on chain, like, all of that, I want to believe it. I just think it's challenging, because even friendech, the minute you introduce a financial incentive to something that people aren't used to or weren't expecting or would do it purely because of goodwill, I think it really psychologically tampers with that. And studies have shown time and time again, like, there's times when people do things out of the good naturedness of their heart, like charity.
00:47:13.900 - 00:47:28.916, Speaker A: The minute you start compensating people for charity, it's like, wait, wait a minute. Like, no, like, you shouldn't touch certain things. But if you have excess storage. Yeah, sure, I'll take a cent. Excess broadband. Sure. As long as, you know, at and t doesn't come knocking on my door.
00:47:28.916 - 00:47:44.516, Speaker A: And if they do, well, okay, slap me on the wrist. The same with that. Airbnb is kind of like treaded this kind of fine line with regulators and condo boards and all this stuff. So I think it depends. I think it really depends on the type of project that you are.
00:47:44.620 - 00:48:03.062, Speaker D: One example here, you guys might remember probably more than I do, but like Jensen, Akash, a bunch of players are doing use your compute, your gpu's to train these models or for model inference, which is different from training. It's like calling the models. Why did Gollum never take off? Do you guys remember that one?
00:48:03.188 - 00:48:16.066, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. There's some wallets that I have all these, like, made safe. And Gollum and Ryan, we can go down this list. But it's curious though, because it's like.
00:48:16.090 - 00:48:18.474, Speaker D: A decade before it, it was useful, right?
00:48:18.514 - 00:48:19.094, Speaker A: Like.
00:48:21.194 - 00:49:49.916, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think in the case of Gollum, by my understanding, is that, like, the actual tool was just not useful, right? Like the, like to do the rendering on Gollum was sort of decoupled from the token. And then again, there's an example where enough people got burned that a community, like, exited left, and also the team migrated on to do Worldcore. Right? Like, a lot of the Gollum team is now the leadership team at Worldcoin. And this sort of cuts to how much a founder group defines the success of the project over time. Tommy, you and I have talked about founder likeability on your pod before and how that can affect project, but also like founder Ambivalence, right? When you get a founder who starts doing venture allocations and running fund and doing other projects and things like that, it's going to have an effect on project. And I think Gollum was one of those things where they needed the technology to evolve a little bit. They could probably execute it better today than they did at that time, and then it just lost momentum because the community lost interest.
00:49:49.916 - 00:50:28.620, Speaker C: However, that's one of those interesting things that we should maybe double click on, which is massive treasury still sitting around. People have these tokens. The treasury is worth more than the fully diluted market cap of the tokens. Why isn't there an activist investor trying to hold people feed to the fire and get them to unwind these enormous treasuries? You get the same thing with tezos, I think, like $0.10 off crowdfund price. And like, when is there a point where you're like, hey guys, that's $600 million that you got sitting in Switzerland. Maybe just redistributed, diversified their treasury fairly.
00:50:28.652 - 00:50:30.836, Speaker A: Well before the crash, I think, for sure.
00:50:30.980 - 00:50:54.484, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. But like today, if there's all that money, is there an argument to unwind it and redistribute the way that digixdao did back in the day? Or, um, or is that just like locked up capital and that's, you know, a trust fund for these, these founders forever?
00:50:55.024 - 00:51:40.392, Speaker A: I think, uh, on that point of self policing, like, there's two things that come to mind. One, I think there ought to be a role for, uh, more activism in the space. I'm, I think done in a good way. I think there's been attempts of doing this, uh, that have backfired. I think also the industry sometimes is really soft when it comes to really portraying VC's. And anyone that tries to challenge a team, a founder of saying, oh, you guys are VC's, vilifying the VC community, which I think is widely overblown. And I think the VC community, time and time again really steps in moments during bear markets of critical funding needs.
00:51:40.392 - 00:52:16.612, Speaker A: There's a time and a place, and not all VC's are created equal. I agree with that, but I think there is a lot of value in having a VC involved and I think there ought to be more activism. The other one, quite frankly, Ryan, structurally you talk about Tasers. A lot of these are receipts. When you invested in this crowd sale, all you got was a thank you card saying, hey, thank you for sending us a dollar. That's it. So from a legal recourse perspective, there isn't much.
00:52:16.612 - 00:53:28.816, Speaker A: And again, this goes back to imagine a world where all these icos happened, where you had regulatory clarity, where there was a proper guideline, maybe crowdfunding mechanism rules, guidelines, where there could be an unwind mechanism, maybe triggered by a smart contract executed by certain parameters. Vitalik has introduced certain blog posts and ideas around. Even the dow was sort of like the way you go about funding. In an ideal world, if you could wave a wand, you could say the same way that biotech goes to these kind of milestone driven funding, and if you don't deliver anything, you kind of like your return capital that could be semi automated, you could have a council that is overseen by community members, and there could be much more structure. But because we've had to kind of operate and tread the needle with whatever your top law firm of choice is telling you to do and the way to structure these things, unfortunately, it opens a vector for the bad actors to exploit that uncertainty. And that is, I think, the point that regulators need to understand. If you don't have clarity, there's going to be someone that's going to exploit that.
00:53:28.816 - 00:53:47.296, Speaker A: And it's. And that's the problem. FTX, they exploited this regulatory jurisdictional thing where they said, okay, we're going to skirt and circumvent the US, and we're going to go through these kind of different jurisdictions, and lo and behold, this is what happens. Whereas the US based exchanges haven't.
00:53:47.400 - 00:53:47.664, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:47.704 - 00:53:48.488, Speaker A: Kraken and Coinbase.
00:53:48.536 - 00:54:14.864, Speaker D: The other thing, too, though, is like, it's just like the worst and most perverse incentives. Like, if you're a founder and you really don't want to work, go to Atezos, raise a bunch of money from your ecosystem fund and coast. Why not? The sell to them is they need developers and projects. And are you going to actually deliver? Maybe, maybe not. I'm calling out tezos. But you could extend this to a lot of other ecosystems, and you get a paycheck.
00:54:14.984 - 00:54:22.284, Speaker A: I guess we could all feel good that they sponsor Manchester United, and if we could all get Manchester United shirts, that'd be nice. But not even that.
00:54:22.854 - 00:54:26.794, Speaker D: I was a Tezos poll in the past, so, like, you know, I get it.
00:54:27.214 - 00:55:45.504, Speaker C: So was I, you know, and although Sanji, you hit. You kind of hit the nail on the head on with respect to jurisdictions, and I know that the three of us sit in different jurisdictions for different reasons, you know, whether us, Europe, Switzerland, which I don't consider to be Europe, or I'm here in Cayman today. And it's interesting that different projects and different funds come to this realization. We've been in Cayman for a long time now, and we feel like we're entrenching here. And I also feel that the act of coming here, which is the exception route in the rule, our business partners always tell us that we're one of the only groups that comes down and does board and does strategic stuff and tries to have presence, really here is actually a really healthy process that allows our partners to understand us better and understand our business better. And also the ceremonial act of going through it is really healthy for decision making and just for focus in the. In the organization.
00:55:45.504 - 00:56:21.732, Speaker C: But we do have this concept in crypto that I think will broaden to the world over time of jurisdictional competition, where you can very quickly go to the jurisdiction that you find most attractive. And it's never a one size fits all. Although I do note that in today's environment. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would guess that, like, somewhere in the range of 75% to 80% of projects are finding their way here to Cayman or BVI these days. Would you guys agree with that?
00:56:21.908 - 00:56:29.404, Speaker D: Can you, like, fast forward that for us? Like, what does that look like 1020 years out? Like, everyone's a nomad going to the jurisdiction you want.
00:56:29.524 - 00:56:31.304, Speaker A: Like, countries don't exist?
00:56:31.764 - 00:56:33.084, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:56:33.124 - 00:57:23.374, Speaker C: Well, the way that we. The way that we look at it, we get a lot of people, like, crypto natives reach out to me because of our setup and ask, like, hey, I want to go through this tax optimization project and jurisdictional competition and moving into the ideal location. I'm thinking about Portugal. I'm thinking about Switzerland. I'm thinking about where should I go? And the decision tree on it starts out as, like, are you american or not? And then if you're not, it's like, okay, do you want to live in the place and have. Do you want to have presence? Like, do you need. Do you want to be a digital nomad? You know, do you accept some taxes, or does it have to be zero? And, like, the decision kind of goes on there, and then if it's american, it's mostly like, well, you're fucked.
00:57:23.374 - 00:58:21.716, Speaker C: And the most you can really do is. Is kind of do the Puerto Rico thing. But by the way, Puerto Rico requires 183 days. You better like surfing, you better like that lifestyle. Or you can limit state tax by going to Texas or to Florida or some other places, and then you get a lot of Americans saying, okay, I want to renounce and I want to move on and I'm going to completely optimize. Does Portugal make sense for me? I often say no because you should look for a jurisdiction that, where the tax benefits or tax zero is culturally ingrained into the fabric of the society. So, like, Cayman is politically impossible for Cayman to ever impose taxes.
00:58:21.716 - 00:58:41.574, Speaker C: It is totally unacceptable among swiss society to impose cap gains taxes or change the tax code. Portugal is a socialist country that made an experiment on a golden visa. And like, one change in the government could completely up at that.
00:58:42.674 - 00:59:04.826, Speaker A: No, it already did. They peeled it back. They started to peel it back two years ago. And I said, this is the time to short real estate prices in Lisbon. And there was, to your point, Ryan, it was just felt like they were going to rug you at some point. Spain has these two year, three year, four year, but it's a novelty. It's not, as you say, the reason of existence for some of these jurisdictions.
00:59:05.010 - 01:00:00.820, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Whereas others, like they have benefited through so many generations and seen the benefits of tax optimization. Almost like meditation, where like, it takes you a while to realize the benefits and then, and then you're bought in. It takes a country a couple of successive generations to realize that, oh, actually, like, giving on the tax, on like cap gains tax especially means that you get more high net worth individuals in the door, means that you get a lot more other benefits. And because of that, we're bought in and we'll never change it. And there's only a few places around the world where that's really culturally ingrained and then the place operates reasonably well. So like, sure, you can get zero taxes in Panama, but to do banking, youre going to be put in a red channel in banking because of the whole Panama papers thing.
01:00:00.820 - 01:00:26.544, Speaker C: And to do business is difficult. So its like youre just doing a different tax. Or you could go to Luxembourg or Liechtenstein, fine, you have no taxes, but you get death by a thousand paper cuts on administrative fees and banking fees because the royal families own the banks and they charge you bips in and out for banking transactions and like, wow, that's just, that's just a tax dressed up in a different, in different clothing. Right.
01:00:27.124 - 01:01:02.572, Speaker A: So there's never, in economics, there's no such thing as a free lunch. There is always a trade off. Now, I do think that, like, it depends. There's two things here that maybe we can double click on is one is if you're in crypto, the regulatory environment is probably paramount. Secondary is the tax component as a project, as a foundation. There is a very clear divide and sort of bipolarity in the world that is increasingly becoming more and more. That divide is growing.
01:01:02.572 - 01:01:51.564, Speaker A: It may compress and revert, but generally speaking, you are seeing places and jurisdictions like United Arab Emirates, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK, the European Union as a whole, just being more pro innovation, pro crypto, more welcoming of the industry and other jurisdictions. But they can. The US is just hostile and maybe uncertain. I think the courts have given us a glimpse of hope in what could be a path forward where the rule of law and the intent and a path forward, I think increasing. The regulators understand that. But right now most of the projects that you're funding, they're not in the US.
01:01:52.384 - 01:02:16.766, Speaker D: Yeah, a couple points there that also, just to add on, like recent events like Celestia aggressively excluded the US. You can't access that airdrop if you're in the US, right? They did a really good job. That means that builders outside of the US are going to have capital to build. And the best projects built on Celestia will probably not be in the US. Right. DY DX aggressively blocking the US. Right.
01:02:16.766 - 01:02:40.690, Speaker D: Eigen layer, allowing people to, allowing middleware to access nodes. And the nodes can choose and market themselves as geographically not in the US. Right. So they'll start to earn a premium because they're not worried about being in the US and their projects getting shut down by the government. Right. I spoke to one of the largest market makers this week too. Not a single node co located in the US.
01:02:40.690 - 01:02:53.694, Speaker D: Right? I agree. I agree with you guys. Ryan, you're right. It has to be jurisdictionally built into their culture. And San Diego, you're right too. It just makes sense that it's hard to build here.
01:02:54.294 - 01:03:52.108, Speaker A: I mean, I think over time. Your point, Ryan, around capital formation will, I think, look vastly different in a world where Internet, like, in a world of Internet money. And I think we've increasingly gone in that direction. I just think my vision, when you first discovered bitcoin, it was like, huh, this extreme scenario, this separates money and state that probably faces a big resistance. In a better version, it just keeps governments in check because there is a neutral layer, money that exists. And so you can't all of a sudden print without serious repercussions, even though you are the top three kind of reserve assets in the world, because now there is an alternative. And that alone brings more responsibility to a system that has gone far irresponsible for too long unchecked.
01:03:52.108 - 01:03:52.692, Speaker A: Preston.
01:03:52.708 - 01:04:42.502, Speaker C: Yeah. For me, the draw originally of bitcoin is my frustration today, which is also, I think, going to be the solution in the long term, which was I got attracted to bitcoin because of its potentiality for crowdfunding. I was a venture capitalist specifically in crowdfunding. And I thought that crowdfunding was one of the most interesting things that we've, that we've ever seen. And obviously polychain dominate sort of the IcO era in crypto. And we're really excited about this idea of crowdfunding. And I think that there will be a new crowdfunding or new ICO era once we get the regulatory clarity in the US that will dwarf the previous ICO era.
01:04:42.502 - 01:05:12.106, Speaker C: And maybe if the only use case of crypto is crowdfunding, I don't care. That's already worth trillions of dollars. That's a great use case. And we don't need to do anything else. We don't need to have storage or ISP's or energy or anything like that if we can just do rapid capital formation among people who want to try and experiment together. And that should be allowed. And so I find that to be the, the greatest point of frustration for me in the space today.
01:05:12.106 - 01:05:32.642, Speaker C: Like, everyone's like, oh, there's no use case of crypto. And I'm like, no, there actually was a really cool use case. It's just kind of not allowed temporarily. But truth will prevail, and I think that will be, I think we'll get to a point where we can do this rapid capital formation freely among people who want to try these experiments among each other.
01:05:32.778 - 01:05:56.272, Speaker A: What do you say to people that say, wait a minute, a lot of people got burned. A lot of people didn't know what they were investing in. Like, would you say on one side, total libertarian, hey, it's their money. They're already paid taxes on it. Let them do whatever the hell they want to. On another side, it's like, no, wait, let's allow, yeah, let's allow that. But with the right disclosures information, you know, the registration, if you will, but that costs.
01:05:56.272 - 01:05:59.404, Speaker A: That's administration, that's, you know, whatever.
01:05:59.704 - 01:06:33.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, the right, the right, the coherent regulation will be one that is not patronizing. So it's not like we're trying to protect you from this free Internet money that could be worth $0.01 or $0.10, but it's free anyway. But at the same time, reasonable. So, for example, disclosures should be necessary what we just talked about before, that if a project doesn't hit milestones, they redistribute the capital rather than just keep it as a trust fund for the founders. Those things should be implemented.
01:06:33.634 - 01:07:11.964, Speaker C: There's a really simple, straightforward path towards a mature regulation that treats people like adults. Because guess what? If you're going to put your money into highly risky things, like you're an adult, that's fine. You should do that the same way that if you're an adult, you can skydive, and that has risk. And I feel like it's not that difficult. It has been made difficult because of the political process and the alternative or ulterior motives that are at play, especially in the US political process. But what are your thoughts? How do we come out with the solution here?
01:07:12.704 - 01:07:45.984, Speaker D: I think we push our solutions for next episode, but I think that there's a lot to talk about on the capital formation side, and also not to cherry pick Eigen layer, Ryan. But the idea that any middleware provider can now access the capital, aka security, through validators, by marketing to them, is a form of potentially indirect crowdfunding. Right. They get the security they need without having to go out to talk to investors. But a rapid fire question in closing, guys, our crypto Twitter timeline is probably the most bearish as I've ever seen it. Is that a counter indicator for you or not?
01:07:49.744 - 01:08:00.136, Speaker A: Santiago, are you on the for you tab or following again? Nuance. Nuance, gentlemen.
01:08:00.320 - 01:08:01.644, Speaker C: Nuance prevails.
01:08:02.264 - 01:08:23.934, Speaker A: Ryan, I will give you credit here. I really like this word, nuance. I will stop saying it because people are going to kill me in the comments. It's nuanced. I think I've done a really good job of curating and unfollowing and following the right people. I do agree with you. It does feel like, look, there's a lot of stuff happening in the world.
01:08:23.934 - 01:08:44.434, Speaker A: I think emotions are high. It gets conflated. Crypto Twitter is this really vocal. Like, the people that are in crypto Twitter, I think, tend to be curious and want to vocalize and talk about a lot of things. There's the trial going on. There's the whole Israel war going on. Like, there's always the macro commentary.
01:08:44.434 - 01:09:10.582, Speaker A: There's the hacks that are going on. So I think a lot of it is, look, social media platforms tend to skew negative. It's people that. There's this idea of a vocal minority that I'm highly cognizant of. Whatever you see in Dao forums and especially in Twitter comments like, if people take the time to do this. They want to vent. I think as a world, as a society, we, it's very woke.
01:09:10.582 - 01:09:20.118, Speaker A: And so that's why you have the anon culture, because people at the end of the day want to vocalize. They want to vent, and they want to do that in a, maybe a pseudo anonymous or pseudonymous Santiago.
01:09:20.166 - 01:09:21.854, Speaker D: It's a good answer, but you're giving me the lawyers.
01:09:21.934 - 01:09:37.124, Speaker A: It's a rapid fire look. I am allocating. I am bullish. It doesn't compute in my thinking. It just doesn't like, I think it's a counter indicator. I think it's a good time to allocate purely because the number, it's a matter of price. Things have been left for dead.
01:09:37.164 - 01:09:44.704, Speaker D: Ryan, you're up. San Diego, I'm with you. I'm a buyer here. But, Ryan.
01:09:46.524 - 01:10:20.384, Speaker C: So very quickly, rapid fire, because we've got to wrap it up, and clearly just construction in our office is wrapping us up. Yeah, I do think that we're going to look back on this as. As the bottom of the trough, whether, well, it's now plus six months, or whether it's. Whether this is like the absolute trough trough. This is a great time to be accumulating high quality assets because this space matters and there are use cases that matter in this space, and that in the end, will prevail.
01:10:20.764 - 01:10:22.636, Speaker A: Brian, you got a picture of this?
01:10:22.700 - 01:10:23.036, Speaker D: Tommy?
01:10:23.100 - 01:10:37.874, Speaker A: Tommy, I'm going to ask you. No, I'm going to ask you a fire question here around allocation allocating, as famously was said by one of the witnesses in the FTX case. Do you know the distinction between solvency and liquidity? And are you allocating?
01:10:39.734 - 01:10:42.074, Speaker D: That's a good one. We'll cover it next episode.
01:10:43.534 - 01:10:44.174, Speaker A: All right, Dennis.
