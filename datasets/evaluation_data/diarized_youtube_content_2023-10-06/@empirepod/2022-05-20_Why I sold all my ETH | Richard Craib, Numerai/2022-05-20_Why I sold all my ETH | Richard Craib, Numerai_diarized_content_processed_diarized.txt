00:00:07.560 - 00:00:25.590, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We are joined by my co founder, Mike Capolido. No Santiago today. And we have a really special guest, Richard from Numerai. He's the founder of Numerai, which is actually. Richard, why don't we let you explain it so I don't royally botch this? What is Nymirai?
00:00:25.782 - 00:01:06.324, Speaker B: Well, Nimirai, the unique thing we do is we're a hedge fund, but we give away all of our data and allow data scientists around the world to model our data and submit predictions to our fund. We only trade equities, so the people who are modeling our data are only trying to predict what's going to happen with stocks. But we do also have a cryptocurrency, NMR, that's used to stake models, and that's a way, basically, for us to find, have our users have skin in the game and allows us to trust their predictions with our portfolio.
00:01:06.664 - 00:01:33.492, Speaker A: Awesome. It's really fun to have you on the show. I remember when Mike and I were launching blockworks in late 2017, Numerai was one of the models that we looked at for why a token based organization could actually scale and could actually work. And I remember specifically looking at numerife in the early days. And I think you guys maybe had been around for around two years, if I remember correctly, launched somewhere in 2015. And so it's really nice to have you on the show.
00:01:33.668 - 00:01:50.204, Speaker B: Yeah, it was late 2015, and then the Arcoin came out almost five years ago now. So been around for a while. And some of the early ideas we had have kind of been applied in so many projects. So it's good to hear we inspired you to some extent.
00:01:50.364 - 00:02:16.864, Speaker A: Exactly. So, anyways, Richard, we wanted to have you on the show because you posted a video that went kind of viral on Twitter the other day, earlier this week with the title saying, I bought bitcoin. Excuse me, I bought ethereum at. Now I'm selling it at somewhere around $2,500. Right. So public math here, somewhere around, like, a 10,000 x on this thing. And by all, from an outsider's point of view, you're running numerai.
00:02:16.864 - 00:02:39.934, Speaker A: You got in the early sale of Ethereum, and you'd probably be this, like, crypto bull, like a lot of other people who got in. And it's kind of rare to see someone exiting their full ETH position at this point. And so just wanted to have you on. And just maybe if we could start by saying, why did you do this? And kind of what happened? And what's the run up to this decision? And what was the decision and why did you do this?
00:02:40.394 - 00:02:46.754, Speaker B: You know, I was just working out, and then I got, I like, like.
00:02:46.834 - 00:02:50.002, Speaker A: All good decisions are made. Like most good post start.
00:02:50.098 - 00:03:04.424, Speaker B: Yeah. Doing some pull ups with my trainer. And then I was like, feeling good. And then I started feeling bad. I was like, ugh, crypto, what a mess. And then I was like, you know what? I'm out. So that's just how it happened.
00:03:04.424 - 00:04:15.514, Speaker B: But all these things I've been thinking about for a very long time, very seriously, because you don't want to be part of something that's not good for the world or life's too short. And so certain things like the stablecoins really, really bothered me, and I never really said anything about it. And I started to feel like, this is bad, I should maybe take a position here and sort of put my money where my mouth is, which is that the economy, the way the macro environment is right now, is completely different to the last five years, last ten years. And bitcoin, which was born in this one huge boom cycle and credit cycle and monetary policy cycle, may not be, may not be as the returns of bitcoin, the future risk adjusted returns of bitcoin may not be as attractive as they were. I also calculated the sharpe ratio of bitcoin and of ethereum. And so that's a risk adjusted return. And they're less than my own hedge fund.
00:04:15.514 - 00:04:39.194, Speaker B: So risk adjusted, I should be putting more money into my own hedge fund. Already have a lot in it, but it's nice because it's neutral to the market. And so I just thought I should sell my ether. But yeah, was not trying to get a million views on my post workout video of my thoughts on crypto.
00:04:39.894 - 00:05:20.608, Speaker A: So, Richard, I don't know you very well, but I do know just from having followed you over a couple of years and read your blog post and things like that, that you're a really calculated person. And so why are you selling? So a little part of me doesn't believe that you were doing some pull ups, and then you just said, all right, I'm hitting the sell button on all of my Ethereum. I know that a lot of decision making went into this. Why sell now? Why sell in this at this exact moment, May of 2022? There have been bear markets in the past. You've rode those bear markets out. The market's been going down now for six months. The market, we don't know what's going to happen in the future, but why this moment, May of 2022.
00:05:20.608 - 00:05:21.964, Speaker A: Are you choosing to sell?
00:05:22.264 - 00:06:09.110, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I've had diamond hands the whole time. There's been some huge Ethereum drawdowns and problems that didn't bother me at all. But this time it's different, because, first of all, the macro environment, seeing that venture capital is having this huge drawdown, private equity is having this huge drawdown, tech stocks are having this huge drawdown. You know what happens when those things have drawdowns? There's an interesting thing people don't know. When banks go down, it creates huge systemic risk. Right? Like the financial crisis.
00:06:09.110 - 00:06:55.334, Speaker B: And then governments step in and help when there's a pandemic, and there's huge systemic risk. Governments step in and help when rich tech nerds are having massive drawdowns in their tech companies, no one could be happier. And so no one's going to bail out the market. And the price to book ratio is sort of like a way of looking at the S and P. Valuation was five about six months ago. Tweeted about it, it's like the highest it's ever been in my career. And exactly the point where it got to in the financial crisis.
00:06:55.334 - 00:07:30.970, Speaker B: Some of my friends said, but, you know, the price book doesn't matter. It's measuring assets. All the tech companies have intangible assets. There's not going to be a drawdown in the market. The only way you could have a company like Netflix, underperform the S and P is if the government were to shut down the Internet. This is the type of stuff people, my friends were telling me, who are like professionals. And so I was always quite skeptical that there would be a kind of like one size fits all forever portfolio, which was own a lot of tech, own a lot of vc, own a lot of crypto.
00:07:30.970 - 00:08:31.604, Speaker B: And now it's pretty clear that all of those things are the same bet they're all correlated with each other. And the whole point of investing is to make a balanced, diversified portfolio. That might sound kind of boomer, but as a mathematician myself, it's just a matter of fact. You do not put all your money into one thing and think that this is a good way to invest. And it's also not a good idea to say, think you're diversified if you own both bitcoin and ethereum, or you own both USDT and UST, and think you're diversified, actually, you're not at all. So people are kind of waking up to this, and it's going to be very sad. And, yeah, kind of within a few hours of me posting my video.
00:08:31.604 - 00:08:59.564, Speaker B: You know, a lot of you were talking about UST already, but it was still at $0.99 when I posted my video. And then a day later it was almost like, yeah, went to like thirty cents at one point. So I think, by the way, I did not predict that you don't really follow these things that much. But it just seems like a very, very, about to enter a very, very different world.
00:09:00.224 - 00:09:21.576, Speaker C: There's a lot to unpack that. And I saw, Richard, your follow up video today where you kind of talked about the macro and essentially what the Fed, by keeping artificially low interest rates for such a long period of time, what they've encouraged market participants to do, right, which is to just take a lot of risk. Capital gets allocated poorly. That's how you get these, frankly, like Dogecoin and Shiba and GameStop and all.
00:09:21.600 - 00:09:32.284, Speaker B: That kind of stuff. The US government created UST. The US government created Luna, not Dokwon.
00:09:32.664 - 00:09:50.464, Speaker C: Yeah, I would tend to agree with you. And it's funny because I heard people make that argument about actually in the great financial crisis, and I didn't really fully understand what they were talking about, actually, until watching some of this stuff play out in real time. In crypto, when the government sets the incentives to take risk, people take risk.
00:09:51.044 - 00:10:00.024, Speaker B: People getting wired $600 to protect, to have money, and during the pandemic, and then they were just buying bitcoin with it.
00:10:01.604 - 00:10:19.224, Speaker C: Walk me through, because it seems like a lot of what you're drawing on here is this very macro view of the world. So maybe we could start with your macro framework in general. Like if you had to, like this particular moment in time, right. Crypto is puking. Right. UST is exploding, all that kind of stuff, this pain is not entirely isolated to crypto. Right.
00:10:19.224 - 00:10:30.344, Speaker C: There's been a massive sell off in across broad equity indices. I think the Nasdaq is down like 3% today, but it's been down, it's like seven straight down weeks. A lot of the tech stocks are just getting smoked.
00:10:30.384 - 00:10:30.512, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:30.528 - 00:10:41.880, Speaker C: It's like peloton and zoom. But even other ones, like PayPal, is down like 80% off its highs. So walk us through kind of your macro framework right now for central banks, governments and interest rates especially.
00:10:42.072 - 00:11:21.532, Speaker B: Well, again, I'm a quant. I don't like macro. I don't really follow macro. So the only things I know about macro are, like common sense. And so, like, if you have, if you have the price to book value of the s and P being at five, I'm not going to be buying the s and P. If you have the s and P crash in COVID, which it did, and the VIX goes to 80, and people think the world's going to end because of a virus that's like nearly identical to flu. No offense.
00:11:21.532 - 00:12:14.022, Speaker B: If you disagree, then, okay, yeah, I'm in. I put all my money in. I was like, the government is going to bail everybody out and they're going to make, they're going to force me to buy. Okay. Moved like $4 million into S and P 500, literally at the tick of the 80 VIX. So this is the type of thing you can do very rarely, but you sort of pick your spots and there's going to be, in a long career, I might see two more bubbles like this. And you just have to be, you have to have the common sense to be like, well, I clearly don't want to be exposed to the rundown in all this, so.
00:12:14.198 - 00:13:01.234, Speaker C: Well, the reason I'm asking for the macro framework here is it seems like a big part of the reason why the faith in Ethereum is gone. Or maybe you don't, you aren't as convicted as you were when you bought in at the ICO, is just, there's a lot of, like, tomfoolery and shenanigans that's caused by, you know, government policies. Right. About interest rates and encouraging people to take risks, et cetera. So my question for you is, obviously, that has caused you to, you know, change your conviction so much that you're moving out of something that was at one point, like, a super risky bet, and you had some amount of conviction in, like, riding it all the way up and all the way down, et cetera. So I'd love to get your, I don't know if you've thought about this, but, like, what an unwind of the government's policy kind of looks like, right. If that policy that encouraged everyone to take risk, like, what does that look like? Played it back in reverse, I suppose.
00:13:01.234 - 00:13:03.490, Speaker C: Then how does that translate to crypto for you?
00:13:03.682 - 00:13:59.174, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the Fed is, and the government, you know, they're very concerned with inflation because it's a, it's a real, it really affects people. It affects poor people. And so it's very ugly. If you think about the mechanics of central banking, you want interest rates to be low to encourage people to invest badly. So you make the interest rates low, and then the rich people get richer, and then because of that, there's inflation, and so the poor people get poorer because the rich people don't give a fuck about inflation because they don't care whether a burger costs $1 more. So it's actually a very evil thing, I think. And so that's like the backdrop here.
00:13:59.174 - 00:15:03.774, Speaker B: But yeah, my, so, yeah, now I just feel like they, what they're going to, because everybody knows about inflation basically, and everybody's seeing it higher than ever for a long time. They're putting pressure on politicians and Biden's not well liked in the polls and things like that, and no one buys that. It's like because of Ukraine that we have inflation. So they're going to basically say, why have you confiscated my money by printing money? Why have you confiscated my savings and given it to rich people? And basically, or given it to the crypto market? So it just sucks. It just sucks for people. And it's always like this. There's always an overreaction to times of like, crisis and then there's inflation and now it's exacerbated with supply chain bullshit.
00:15:03.774 - 00:15:32.382, Speaker B: So it's not a pretty situation. But the government has to do something and the fed, their job is to have a safe dollar. And the dollar is, by the way, doing well because everything is doing well because everything's going down. So they're going to want the, the inflation to come down and they're going to do everything. They're going to pop every single bubble that they created to get it down.
00:15:32.518 - 00:15:48.614, Speaker A: I think so you're right, Richard. Like that. That's what's happening, right? Tiger is down, what, 60 or 70% off its highs. A lot of the things that Mike mentioned, the S and P, Nasdaq is absolutely tanking. Crypto, right. Bitcoin and ETH look like they're doing well. They're down like 50, 60%.
00:15:48.614 - 00:16:04.584, Speaker A: Don't get me started on the other l one s that are down like 70, 80, sometimes 90%. So when you say like, move out of ETH into kind of quality outside of obviously your hedge fund, where are you allocating capital? Where is the quality right now in this kind of market?
00:16:04.884 - 00:16:19.184, Speaker B: Well, as you know, we were just talking about my friend Olaf. I invested in polychain and so they paid me out a lot as well. In the beginning of this year.
00:16:20.754 - 00:16:29.130, Speaker A: Polychain, for example, polychain is allocating only to crypto. So you are still allocate. So you're still long on crypto. It's just ETH specifically.
00:16:29.242 - 00:17:32.263, Speaker B: Well, I don't have any money in the fund anymore. And whenever they do pay me out like a sort of dividend, I don't put it into crypto, I put it into my own fund. Now, there's definitely going to be a time, I think, when the markets crash a lot where I'm like, well, geez, now I definitely want to have some, some more s and p or even more ether, but that doesn't seem to be like short term, what I would buy. So, yeah, I think I have about $17 million in numerise fund and, and we'll put more in the next couple of months from this Ethereum sale. It's going to have nothing like the returns, I should mention, it's going to have nothing like the returns of Ethereum or anything like that, but it's going to have better risk adjusted returns.
00:17:34.923 - 00:18:00.478, Speaker C: My interpretation of Jason just asked, basically as the Fed withdraws liquidity from the market and pops all these bubbles where pockets of value, and you said a market neutral hedge fund, that's pretty bearish for the market overall. If that's where we're getting returns from market neutral hedge funds, then there's not that much else out there of value, I guess, in your opinion. Or cash. Yeah, or cash. Yeah, exactly.
00:18:00.526 - 00:18:13.208, Speaker A: What's the timeframe on that, Richard? And what are you looking for? What signals do you look for to say, okay, nevermind, that period of time is turning. We're going back into a period where like, I'm going long equities or what are you looking for here and what's the timeline?
00:18:13.376 - 00:19:04.890, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think it depends how quickly things get smashed. But, you know, it's always hard to get excited about crypto when you have something like Luna, which was in the top ten of crypto, or something like that, it's very hard because you sort of, well, I know all of this stuff. If I look at this off top 20 coins, you can find seven that you know are going to zero, then this is not a good time to be in crypto. And so if it got, if you got to a nice clean world of like, okay, there's bitcoin, there's ethereum, and then there's a handful of other things, and then I don't see too many dogs on the top hundred, then I.
00:19:04.892 - 00:19:46.956, Speaker A: Think push back on that, Richard, because if you look at the top ten in 2017, like, bit connect, right? Like, we had some like, glaring scams in the last month, and then it went down. And then it went down and then it went down. But that's my question is, like, so then bitConnect popped in January, like 15th or 20 January of 2018, bitConnect pops, and we really kind of drudged down for like two years. And then March of 2020 was like, max Payne, right? March 12, I think it was 2020, and everything, everything kind of just tanked 50% on that one day, and boom. Going long from there, you made a phenomenal. That was a phenomenal decision. So in your mind, are you looking for something like that, or are you like, I'm out of crypto.
00:19:46.956 - 00:19:52.516, Speaker A: I'm done with this industry. I'm out of it. I'm turning my back and not looking back.
00:19:52.700 - 00:20:03.316, Speaker B: First of all, I wouldn't call it an industry that's giving it too much credit. People used to call it the space, the crypto space. I think that's more appropriate.
00:20:03.460 - 00:20:07.304, Speaker A: You don't think something that had $2 trillion market cap is an industry?
00:20:08.524 - 00:20:09.724, Speaker B: Did you check it today?
00:20:09.884 - 00:20:17.748, Speaker A: Well, now it's down to one, but yes. So you don't think so? Yeah, yeah. I mean, yes, I would call it an industry. I would.
00:20:17.836 - 00:20:55.364, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, no, I mean, industries make products, and if the product is speculation. So if you think about what, where are the. Where are the revenues coming from in the entire crypto industry, who are the biggest. Who are the biggest people who've captured the most money? The exchanges. It's exchanges, it's friction and transaction costs, like on uniswap. So you got FTX, Coinbase, all these people capturing what other revenue sources are there.
00:20:55.364 - 00:20:58.764, Speaker B: So your product is trading in speculation.
00:20:59.184 - 00:21:04.608, Speaker C: But how is that different? I mean, how would you define at a high level, what is the product of Wall street?
00:21:04.776 - 00:21:40.744, Speaker B: Ah, very good point. The finance industry wouldn't be allowed to exist if they weren't for this incredible spin off benefit, which is all the fucking companies in the world get financing, and the companies are doing real fucking things. Okay? So it's like, I don't really, like, look around you. Everything you see is made by companies who have access to capital. Maybe you can say to me, well, I'm in the metaverse. Look around me. All of these NFTs are created on crypto or something like that.
00:21:40.744 - 00:22:04.552, Speaker B: Maybe you can say that, but you can't say that the social and public good benefits of the stock market, which are critical or anywhere close to crypto. People have said to me things like, but yeah, there was one guy in Ukraine who was in a war, and they moved all his money into USDT or USDC.
00:22:04.648 - 00:22:21.766, Speaker A: So I disagree with that. I know where you're going with that. That's bullshit. That's like a tiny little use case or whatever. I think my pushback is like, I think I'm more optimistic maybe than you are on what this stuff creates in ten years. And maybe it's too, too basic of an analogy to compare it to the.com bubble.
00:22:21.766 - 00:22:39.284, Speaker A: It's overused. It's overplayed. I get that. But, like, yeah, all these websites in 1995, like, no one's doing anything with them, you're not transacting on them. And then useful things get built. And, like, I think I'm optimistic that useful things will get built and that the first thing that ever gets built is financing. Right.
00:22:39.284 - 00:22:55.668, Speaker A: And so, yeah, that's kind of what, like, nfts right now are, is like financing mechanisms and icos and, and ethereum, like, these are all just early ways to finance new companies that will eventually be useful and have products. But it sounds like you disagree with that.
00:22:55.836 - 00:24:09.384, Speaker B: Here's what I, here's what would be nice, I think, and this is maybe a world we can hope for, which is what if you could raise money in an ICO and you didn't have to pretend you were doing a community governance project? You could say, this is a company, and these coins we're giving you are shares, and we are going to operate like a company and, like, build real things. And that would be an amazing thing. Do you know one of the first, you know, remember the DAO? Do you know one of the first projects proposed for the Dow? So this was the DAO. They had all this investment money pulled in from people, and then they were gonna. One of the first proposals was, can you invest in this french electric car company? So all these young people, very enthusiastic about crypto, and then they want to do something awesome, like invest in an electric car company. And then the government says, this is a security. These people are taking investment risk.
00:24:09.384 - 00:25:05.612, Speaker B: It's much better. The regulators are kind of telling you, it's much better if this was an art project and had no value beyond the art value. And it's much better if this was a kind of governance token thing. And so the sad thing, I think, is that all the energy of young people, which is very powerful for moving the world forward. Those people wanted to make investments in companies, but the government banned crypto being used for securities, and so people found weird ways to make it be used for obscure kind of larping. And it didn't matter because the demand was so strong and the advertising was good.
00:25:05.748 - 00:26:30.784, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, I mean, there's certainly, there's certainly a lot of merit to that. I think a lot of the weird circularity that I think gets criticized in crypto pretty fairly has to do with securities laws less so than a genuine desire to, like, pay out contributors. I would say, you know, one alternative way I would reframe this a little bit or maybe like, an alternative timeline I could suggest to you is, you know, a lot of the speculation in crypto that it's very famous for, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, et cetera, not many people who are actually serious participants in crypto like that. In fact, most people resent that it exists at all. Um, and I think, you know, in the stock market, right, where companies actually create legitimate products and services, I don't think anyone's cheering for, uh, like, not to pick on any particular companies, but, like, the, the Nikolas of the world, right, which somehow, right, um, uh, got this, like, whatever it got up to, like, $20 billion valuation in SPAC mania, right? That's a, that's a bug, not a feature of the government. The Fed deciding to blow an asset bubble. So instead of maybe looking at crypto as a result of the Federal Reserve pumping trillions of dollars into the economy, causing all this speculation, there actually might have been a future for crypto or a past for crypto where it wasn't quite so speculative and mania driven, and it might have still worked.
00:26:30.784 - 00:27:27.944, Speaker C: Like, sans any of this ludicrous speculation around, like, doge Shiba, these bullshit NFT projects, all that stuff. Like, there is still a legitimate, I think, use case, especially for something like bitcoin, I think open source, smart contract like protocols where people can actually build applications on them and kind of crowdsource that there's a legitimate value being built there. The problem is, it kind of gets overshadowed by this. So in a weird way, I guess you could look at it as, like, the Fed created crypto with this crazy speculation, or you could look at it, it's actually made it a lot worse and a lot more volatile, because one thing I've been thinking about now, having lived through multiple market cycles, is it kind of sucks. It kind of sucks. Like, it would actually just be better if it went like this, right, instead of like this, because it's actually very hard if you are trying to build a legitimate business to plan, because you don't know what demand is real, you don't know, you don't know how to build into your revenue forecasts. It's very, very difficult.
00:27:27.944 - 00:27:36.728, Speaker C: So my framework on is not that the Fed actually created crypto. I think they actually made it worse. Worse. Just like they made the stock market worse.
00:27:36.816 - 00:28:19.858, Speaker B: I think there's something to that for sure. I mean, the one thing we know. So all this is kind of strange coming for me because I created a cryptocurrency. It's on Ethereum, and we would not have existed without it. It's so critical for our business and the functioning of the business, and we have no plans to leave Ethereum with our cryptocurrency. But one of the things I started saying to our communities, I mean, trying to tell them, you know, I try to never hype the coin in any way. I try to say what we really want from this coin is for it to be low volatility, uncorrelated from other, other things.
00:28:19.858 - 00:29:03.400, Speaker B: That's the only things we should be optimizing for. And you want some volume and liquidity and stuff on other exchanges. But I think, and so it's strange to say that, like, I have at one point I was a billionaire in NMR, and I don't, I'm not trying to get back to being a billionaire in that way. I don't mind becoming a billionaire for my hedge fund, but I want the coin to be, like, sensible. I don't want people to get overly excited about it. I've had people, like kids fucking emailing me after we, we gave away the coin. We didn't even do an ICO, we just gave it away.
00:29:03.400 - 00:29:51.508, Speaker B: Trying to be nice guys and kids, like, 16 year old kids emailing me, telling me, like, I should burn the coin because they put their life savings into it. And, and I was just like, this is so weird. Like, this is a coin for like a data science community of like a few thousand data scientists that are like math machine learning geniuses. And now the volatility of our coin is affected by the speculator class, which has absolutely no purchase on what they're even doing. And those people are being onboarded onto these exchanges, kind of sold a story. I don't like the stuff like FTX, paying celebrities to renaming stadiums. It's gross.
00:29:51.508 - 00:29:53.252, Speaker B: Everybody knows it's gross.
00:29:53.428 - 00:29:56.544, Speaker A: But that's just marketing. That's not a crypto thing. That's a.
00:29:57.004 - 00:29:57.972, Speaker B: But what are you marketing?
00:29:58.028 - 00:30:18.340, Speaker A: Marketing. But what do you're marketing? That a user should come buy and sell things on your platform instead of going and sell, buying and selling on another platform. In the same way that figure and all of these other Sofi are big sponsor Robinhood, they're all big sponsors of sports.
00:30:18.412 - 00:30:38.818, Speaker B: They know there's a kind of implicit thing that, like, you can make a lot of money if you get involved in this. I mean, it might even be explicit. I think finance is even explicit. You can get a lot of money. You can make a lot of money if you're involved in this. And, you know, as I. I made a lot of money being involved in this, but there's a sort of limit to.
00:30:38.818 - 00:30:40.610, Speaker B: But no one was marketing it to me.
00:30:40.682 - 00:30:47.094, Speaker A: No, no. I do think you make a really good point there, Richard. Like, and we're seeing it with Ust, like, there should probably be better.
00:30:47.644 - 00:30:48.196, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:30:48.220 - 00:30:53.284, Speaker A: I hate, like, disclaimers or whatever, but some. Some better understanding of the risk that you're taking.
00:30:53.444 - 00:31:09.500, Speaker C: Yeah, I've actually. I've got a question. Sorry, Jason. At a high level, what is the alternative? So people like, here. Here are two. Here are two kind of narratives or schools of thought. Every investment opportunity, there should be a free market investment opportunity should just be there for anyone to take.
00:31:09.500 - 00:31:25.156, Speaker C: And then there's one where it's like, people should actually be protected. Right. The crypto, what you were looking at in crypto is the free market. That is what the free market looks like, highly less regulated. That is the natural outcome of that. The pros is that anyone can do it. Anyone can get in.
00:31:25.156 - 00:31:26.700, Speaker C: And, yeah, there's some, like, shadiness involved.
00:31:26.732 - 00:31:27.372, Speaker B: It's not the.
00:31:27.388 - 00:31:27.788, Speaker C: In the other.
00:31:27.836 - 00:31:47.304, Speaker B: It's not. I know what you say, but it's not quite the free market because it doesn't have all the assets. So those people that are in the free market for crypto cannot buy Apple stock, cannot invest in Numerai's hedge fund, cannot. And that is a regulatory issue.
00:31:47.464 - 00:31:47.920, Speaker C: Correct?
00:31:47.992 - 00:31:53.724, Speaker B: I would basically correct. What I would actually say is it needs to be way more free the market.
00:31:54.144 - 00:32:27.188, Speaker C: All right? But at one point, the stock market was like crypto. It was like, anything goes, blah, blah, blah. And then eventually someone said, you know what? I think that marketing is, like, a little bit gross, and I think it's too risky for these people. And they. You layered on these rules and you got a sec, a CFTC, and that's. And that's what you have in this system, which essentially says, we are going to protect you people, and we're not going to let you take this risk, but in the process, we will eat that risk and we will reap all the rewards at a high level. Right.
00:32:27.188 - 00:32:58.882, Speaker C: Those are kind of the trade offs. And I actually think, like, a lot of the problem that we're. Problems that we're facing today is the. The result of creating that system where only a select amount of people are allowed to take risk that only they really understand because everything else has been watered down. And don't confuse the mob, you know, like, we're looking at the inevitable result, I think, of system a, and crypto is just going in. Crypto is a counter, it is a overreaction to everything that is wrong in the system. That is how I view, for all its pros and cons.
00:32:58.978 - 00:33:38.344, Speaker B: Exactly. I think that's exactly right. And there's so much of that that I've seen. I mean, early when I came to America to start numerai, I was shocked that people I met, friends of mine who were, like, in their twenties, couldn't invest in my company because they weren't accredited. And I was like, this is the fucking United States, and a college educated person can't invest in a company. That, that was, like, bizarre to me, that that's a thing. There couldn't be anything more evil than that law.
00:33:38.344 - 00:34:21.904, Speaker B: And it's so harmful. And so you think, well, the law is protecting the investors. And it's like, oh, really? Now? That same person who couldn't invest in my hedge fund goes and buys coins and goes and gets leverage on binance. And all of that trading activity is in a kind of fake economy that isn't driving any real business. I mean, the more volume there is in dogecoin, I hope you would agree there isn't more activity in the real world. Whereas if my company didn't get an investment, we wouldn't be here and we wouldn't have employees and we wouldn't have built technology.
00:34:22.573 - 00:34:45.233, Speaker C: You know, I didn't really connect this until, right. Like, all right, one of the big travesties of what the Fed did in 2020 was the pure, the magnitude of the misallocation of capital. And look at where every one of those stocks, the ones that went like that, look at where they all are now. They are at or below their previous levels. All of them. All of them. It's nuts.
00:34:45.233 - 00:35:16.580, Speaker C: And actually, I think crypto suffers through that same problem. Like, if you were in this space, like, I am a believer in this space, um, and a little part of me dies when I look at the top ten. Yeah, I, and I see dogecoin up there. Like, what the literal why? You know, and I think that's probably, you know, like these old, these, like, old timey boomer stock market investors who are like, GameStop is the devil. And it's because they believe in the system and they're like, this is a mockery. This is a mockery of the damn system. And it's, I think it's the same base instinct.
00:35:16.580 - 00:35:24.442, Speaker C: You're like, what the hell, man? Yeah, what the hell? You know? I don't know. I think it's the same urge capitalism.
00:35:24.618 - 00:36:15.466, Speaker B: You know, the amazing thing is if you kind of let people do their own thing and invest freely and they have a free market for capital, good things will happen. And the free market for capital piece is, is what? We aren't the exact definition of capitalism. You have a free market for capital? Nope. It's controlled by the Fed. The capital, the interest rates. So it's like, this is a kind of strange world to operate in, because now I've got to even, I've got to be like, well, this is like I was saying earlier, there's certain types of bubbles the Fed will bail out, but there are others they weren't. So I'm like, oh, what type of crash is this? Oh, it's a tech crash.
00:36:15.466 - 00:36:36.674, Speaker B: Oh, then the Fed's not going to save the market and it's this horrible world, and no one can think clearly about what to do with capital if there's all these alterations by the Fed all the time, and I don't. Yeah. So that's pretty annoying.
00:36:37.734 - 00:36:57.230, Speaker C: Super annoying. It makes it really difficult. Like on a, it actually impacts, like, Jason and my life. Right. Because as a business, what you're trying to do is you, like, people always call it forecasts. You're not forecasting when you're setting revenue goals, you're setting targets, right? And you're saying, this is how much revenue I have, this is my profit margin. This is how many employees I think I can hire in a year.
00:36:57.230 - 00:37:22.434, Speaker C: And the Fed is doing explicitly, is creating demand. Like liquidity equals demand, right? Liquidity equals credit. Credit equals demand. So therefore, when the, when the Fed pumps liquidity into the market, they're pumping demand into the market. And like, that just sucks because you never know what's, it's hard, it's harder to parse out what is legitimate organic demand for business or what they can just take away like that. Right? It's difficult.
00:37:22.594 - 00:38:00.964, Speaker B: I had a startup during this big bubble of tech and low interest rates. Now there's someone who's happening, who happens to graduate from Stanford today. His life is going to be completely different because of Fed decision making. You won't be able to raise money for a startup as easily as I was able to. And there'll be ten other problems created by this basically distortionary influence. So the market, by the way, the free market without the Fed's influence would also have ups and downs. But in some ways, I could take those more than these.
00:38:01.504 - 00:38:51.098, Speaker A: Yeah. Though you could argue, though you could argue that now is truly the best time to be getting into it. Like being an employee at a tech company. Now getting in right now is the best time getting in. Maybe last year, the year before, you probably have a bunch of rsus that you're never going to be in the middle of those things, but now actually is probably one of the best times. Richard, I want to ask you, so when you think about, I still need to pull out more of your thesis on crypto, because I'm still having trouble understanding if, like, you don't think the investment is there and the investment is not where you want to allocate your capital, or if you, or if you think that nfTs, daos, all these layer ones, like, if you just think they don't, they won't, they're like, they're going to zero. Because when I think of something like a Dao, I'm like, or just, honestly, crypto in general, like, get smart contracts, get crypto out of it.
00:38:51.098 - 00:39:06.898, Speaker A: Change the word crypto to something else. The world is going more digital. The world's going more remote. The world's going global first. The world is going. Issuing equity is an absolute nightmare. Working with my, with wells Fargo and Bank of America and JPMorgan is an absolute nightmare.
00:39:06.898 - 00:39:25.080, Speaker A: And no one's fixing those problems, and no one's building for that world. And when I see crypto, it's like you're building better financial tools and you're building for, like, a world that's global and remote and digital first. So get all crypto stuff out of it. I just feel like crypto is kind of building for that world, but it seems like you might dis. Okay, so you. Okay?
00:39:25.112 - 00:40:25.614, Speaker B: I think it is. But I also think, why is it annoying and hard to use a bank website or make a transfer? And I used to think, well, the banks can't attract any talented front end engineers because they're not cool, and so they're never going to be able to make their products good or useful. But then I now actually feel differently about it. I think, like, they can make it good, but they, they, like, yeah, they're the talent that was taken away to Silicon Valley. They can make it as good as they want, but the regulations will make it hard. So, like, I've had so many issues with my bank, you wouldn't even believe. Like, I, it's just like, every few days, they'll, like, call me about something or, like, freeze my account when I'm traveling or, like, all these types of things.
00:40:25.614 - 00:40:56.554, Speaker B: And they're doing it because there's some law that they're reading, like the letter of the law, and they're saying, now you got to do a KYC flag on this guy. Now you got to do this. Now you got it because it's a fraud and it's like all this stuff. But I don't think they would do it if they, like, didn't have to do it. So it's the fact that crypto is not really following the laws because it sort of can't, because it's decentralized. That's why it's a bit easier to do. It's not because of the technology as much as people might think, I think.
00:40:57.654 - 00:41:27.984, Speaker C: Question for you on that. So you could make a very similar argument and people have about the Internet. And the Internet essentially is being a gigantic regulatory arbitrage in general. Taxation is different, labor is different. And you could have been standing there shouting into the wind that, hey, it's not really first principles why the Internet is succeeding, but here we are. And, you know, as much as the one thing that I always push back on a little bit when I. Cause I listen to these macro shows, and I love listening to these guys.
00:41:27.984 - 00:41:50.728, Speaker C: And I agree. I think tech has gotten way out ahead of its skis. I believe in interest rates. I believe the fed has blown asset bubbles. But then I start, then I sit down and I think to myself, okay, but is the world going in the. When the world, when all this process reverses, are suddenly steel and coal companies and, like, you know, manufacturers, are they going to become the sexy companies again? And I got to tell you, I don't think they are. I think it's a one way track.
00:41:50.728 - 00:42:10.992, Speaker C: And I think the fed is, like, blown it, and they can exacerbate the problems, but the world is moving in one direction. And, like, valuation might have gotten out of whack, but, like, I used to be a consultant. I used to work for these, like, big manufacturers, these distributors. The world is not moving in that direction, I got to tell you. They basically exist so that people. Sorry. In, like, the midwest, have, like, jobs and can support themselves.
00:42:11.048 - 00:42:37.536, Speaker B: Like, I think we need oil companies. You know, like, we still do. They are doing extremely well right now, by the way. Warren Buffett's beating the s and P this year by quite a lot. And Warren Buffett's beating the s and P. It's because the basic stuff like bubblegum companies and oil companies and stuff are kind of more attractive than the tech stuff. So it's a hard year to have crypto be a good year.
00:42:37.680 - 00:43:00.658, Speaker C: I know. And I'm, like, kind of being facetious here. I know they do legitimate good work. I totally understand. I think we're all getting reminded of that, frankly, right now. But, but, you know, I do, I do also think at the same time, the core premise holds, like, my generate, like, the millennial generation, the Gen Z generation, it's clearly moving in one direction. I don't, I don't think, I don't see those companies successfully competing for, for talent moving forward into the future.
00:43:00.658 - 00:43:45.844, Speaker C: And I will say, you know, one thing that's always given me hope for crypto throughout booms and busts and whatever is the immense amount of talent that it attracts and something that's invisible to folks who haven't been in the industry for a while. You know, when Jason and I, when we first started throwing these events in 2017, it was like, I don't want to segment people like this, but I just, for simplification purposes, I'm going to say, like 75%, like the equivalent of dog coin meme coin traders, and like 25%, like real ex, like Goldman, like real people trying to build real stuff, and it's flipped. It's definitely now, like 75%. Really. They consider, like, this is the industry I'm going to spend my career in. Very legitimate, actually trying. And then to, you still do have, like, 25% of people are, like, flipping dog coins and they're like, happy to tell you about it.
00:43:45.844 - 00:43:48.812, Speaker C: So I think that's if there's any.
00:43:48.908 - 00:45:13.106, Speaker B: But that's probably because of the price. So the FTX can recruit people because they're a valuable company now and their coins are valuable and on and on, and they're benefiting from all this stuff. And so suddenly normies on Wall street start saying, oh, I read this newspaper article and then I went down the rabbit hole and now I'm in crypto. It's like, oh, really? You're inspired by crypto in 2020, 213 years later? Oh, really? Yeah. So there's a lot of those kind of people that they're trying to do their best, but they're a bit normy because they're just responding to price incentives and then retroactively making a narrative about it. So I would say that, yes, there's a lot more people in crypto, but maybe they're only there because the price mechanism, the failure of the prices of crypto, to be realistic, has created a way for, you know, a 16 z to pay $20 million to a lobbyist to go lobby about crypto. Not so bad.
00:45:13.106 - 00:45:28.994, Speaker B: Again, I'm not bearish on crypto. I didn't say in my video it's going to zero. I didn't even say it has an expected return of zero. I just said the risk adjusted returns are not even remotely as good as they used to be.
00:45:29.574 - 00:46:04.132, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the risk adjusted part of that is super important to keep in mind. And the other thing is, the stock market has, in past generations, it can trend sideways or down for ten years. Just this up only thing does not necessarily have to continue ad infinitum. Yeah, I don't know. I think overall, I mean, you know, what is encouraging, actually, about crypto as well. But first of all, I agree exactly with your model. I think people get sucked in by the price, but then some of them stick around.
00:46:04.132 - 00:46:16.944, Speaker C: I mean, frankly, that's what happened to me and Jason. Like, both of us got sucked in by the price, and here we are five years later. So there's something to it. Definitely lost a lot of money in the beginning, but whatever. So I think, I don't know.
00:46:18.004 - 00:46:44.196, Speaker B: Price is all one of the things people don't really get. Elon Musk actually says this really well. It's like, prices of things. It's not that important with the prices. What's important is, like, what they do. If you have the price of things be really distorted, like, then human beings, like, human capital gets misallocated. So you could have a situation where.
00:46:44.196 - 00:47:18.470, Speaker B: And not be too negative here, but, like, what if all of this stuff that's been happening in crypto is, like, ten years of completely misallocated efforts? The fact that, like, there's, like, thousands of people who, like, millions of people who have all this knowledge about, like, L2s and, like, the merge and, like, this kind of stuff, maybe all of that is, like, fake knowledge. Like, they've just been reading, like, a Sci-Fi book, and then they're just gonna.
00:47:18.502 - 00:47:57.874, Speaker A: Sorry, hold on. Has that ever? So I think, I love how you said that about what if all of this misallocation of capitals really becomes a misallocation of human capital? I think that's such a brilliant way of framing that. But when in history have we ever had something like, innovation that's out of a bag? Like, something new is created, and a massive amount of capital and human talent comes into it? There's always booms and busts. Right? Oil, railroads, tech, Internet. There's always booms and busts, but it's really hard to put the genie back in the bottle. That rarely happens. This would be a one in 100 time where the genie's out of the bottle.
00:47:57.874 - 00:48:04.774, Speaker A: A trillion dollars of capital has flowed in hundreds of thousands of people, and then it just all goes back in the bottle.
00:48:06.734 - 00:48:55.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it would be. I don't think that's what will happen, but I think the key to making it not be that way. Where this has all been like a larping experiment, is to have real securities be on the blockchain all over the place, because suddenly, then the blockchain is. The tech's being used for something that is, like, clearly perfect for, you know, small private companies making stocks. But there has to be some regulatory framework for that, I guess. But that would be a bit better than like, hey, we're doing an NFT drop, you know, look at these pictures. Join the discord.
00:48:55.294 - 00:49:04.314, Speaker B: Fuck you. No, only live once. We can do better, guys. We can build more.
00:49:04.654 - 00:49:32.578, Speaker C: Yeah, I hear you on that. Maybe, to use your analogy, Jason, for the railroads, I think for me, the big difference is just time in general, stocks, assets, correct in price or time. And the people who laid the foundation for the railroads didn't see the returns. They got way out ahead of their skis. A bunch of capital got raised. It laid the foundation, laid the railroad tracks, and then, like, the next wave came in and they built the trains and they made all the money. So I don't know.
00:49:32.666 - 00:50:12.204, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's exactly maybe what's happening. And by the way, again, my entire company that I'm putting my life into and all my money into could not exist without Ethereum staking. So we're using it for a thing that works really well for what we're doing. And I think there's many other people who will be able to find use cases for it. The scaling stuff in some way is maybe the problem. Like, I think Twitter would have turned on, stake your tweets, stake your profile to get the blue check mark. They would have turned all that on if Ethereum was kind of working by now.
00:50:12.204 - 00:50:23.714, Speaker B: And that would have been fun. And they'll get there, I think, and that will make the Internet more useful, maybe.
00:50:24.374 - 00:50:47.998, Speaker C: Richard, like, one thing. So I completely understand the concern and criticism. A lot of it's. I would push back on some things, but I think a lot of it's valid. What is within crypto? Like, can you describe to us, like, originally, what is it that drew you in. And what is one thing that you're still positive on or excited about or like this? If it just works, this could be pretty cool, you know?
00:50:48.046 - 00:51:21.790, Speaker B: Yeah, there was actually, it's funny, we're mentioning Olaf and polychain. And I remember he came up to me, he was almost, like, working next to us. He was, like, working in our office at a time. And he said, you know, there's this project called maker, and should we put some money into it? An Olaf's fund had $2 million. Now it's 2 billion, I think. And I was like, they're making a stable coin. Oh, my God, this would be so valuable.
00:51:21.790 - 00:51:58.294, Speaker B: I even said to him, if the only thing that comes out of crypto is a stable coin, that would almost make the whole thing amazing. Like, you have this sort of bitcoin, which is like your digital gold, let's get scarce. And then you have stablecoins, which is like your swiss bank account you can keep. And I was like, even if that works, if only that works, crypto will be a really amazing thing for the world. And so when I look back now, we do have stable coins. They're just terrible. Makers may be a better one.
00:51:58.294 - 00:52:33.942, Speaker B: So when I do look back, I actually think. I think there's some sense of, like, I'm disappointed. But actually, if I look back, I'm like, this has been amazing. Like, I think there's plenty of good stuff that's happened in Ethereum. The one thing I hate is how much it's kind of about speculation and trading versus solving problems and numerai's use of staking. We had a huge problem that was going to break the company, which is that we couldn't trust the models we were receiving. And by forcing people to stake them, we could now trust them because they had skin in the game.
00:52:33.942 - 00:52:57.816, Speaker B: And that small thing is super powerful. And so, yeah, I think. I'm not that. I'm definitely not anti ethereum as a technology. I was very enthusiastic about it. I loved the idea of, like, Internet finance. All this stuff was so appealing to me that it was very inspiring.
00:52:57.816 - 00:53:23.274, Speaker B: I was reading the Ethereum whitepaper at work as a quant, and while reading it, I had these quant papers and they had the Ethereum white paper. And then I sort of, like, put them together to make numeri. So all of that is a very important part of my life, and I still am enthusiastic about Ethereum as a potential.
00:53:24.214 - 00:53:33.348, Speaker C: All right, I think you've already been super generous with your time, Richard Jason I don't know if you have any other closing questions, but it's been great for me. You made me think, Richard, this has.
00:53:33.356 - 00:53:45.944, Speaker A: Been really, really interesting. Yeah, really, really interesting. So I appreciate it, Richard. All right, so what's next for you, Richard? Are you turning, unfollowing everyone on crypto Twitter and just running the fund and turning off your crypto brain?
00:53:46.644 - 00:54:05.554, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'm making some. Might make some enemies, being honest, but then I think maybe more people will be honest. I do think in private. A lot of the people, insiders in crypto that I know are like, damn, this is kind of getting a bit out of hand. Say it publicly. And I think they should.
00:54:06.374 - 00:54:11.274, Speaker A: Are you gonna make enemies with future videos? Do you have more videos planned?
00:54:12.414 - 00:54:24.958, Speaker B: I don't. I keep saying I should. I need to try to stop thinking about this. What? I have no fucking skin in the game anymore, so I need to just work on my hedge fund, which is doing dandy nice.
00:54:25.086 - 00:54:43.514, Speaker A: Well, congrats, man. I'm happy for you. It's been awesome seeing what you've done with numerai, and it's cool to see. Yeah, 2017 is just this little thing that I recently launched, a token and to see what it's turned into. Yeah, super happy for you and just impressive. And, yeah, we're rooting for you, even though we tend to disagree on some of the crypto things. Still rooting for you, so.
00:54:49.294 - 00:55:00.376, Speaker B: Well, I'm also, you know, trying to, again, make a case that I feel I always. I always. It's always good to think. Have both cases. You can make both. Right.
00:55:00.520 - 00:55:01.088, Speaker C: I agree.
00:55:01.176 - 00:55:07.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so, too. Yeah. Indeed. Indeed. Yeah. Awesome. All right, well, be well, and we'll talk soon.
