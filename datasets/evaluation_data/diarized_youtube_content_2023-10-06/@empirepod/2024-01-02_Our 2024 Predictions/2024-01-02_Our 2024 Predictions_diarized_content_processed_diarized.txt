00:00:00.280 - 00:00:03.342, Speaker A: Every time I see this chart of, like, you know, we keep burning more.
00:00:03.358 - 00:00:06.030, Speaker B: ETH, it's like, yeah, but, like, are.
00:00:06.062 - 00:00:07.394, Speaker A: Users also going up?
00:00:07.814 - 00:00:09.150, Speaker B: Is activity going up?
00:00:09.262 - 00:00:11.838, Speaker A: Like, are you onboarding more people relative to other ecosystems?
00:00:11.886 - 00:00:15.918, Speaker B: And I think there will be a shift, and I think it starts with.
00:00:15.966 - 00:00:21.422, Speaker A: L two s, being more successful and onboarding more people and building great products, which I think is. Is a thing.
00:00:21.478 - 00:00:22.926, Speaker B: Right. All right, everyone.
00:00:22.990 - 00:00:51.470, Speaker C: So on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We've hosted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20. We'll see you in London. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner.
00:00:51.470 - 00:01:24.550, Speaker C: Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time. Harpy is not just a security solution. They are a peace of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. To learn more about Harpy, click the link in the show notes or visit Harpy IO Empire. All right, so we got the predictions episode for anyone who listened.
00:01:24.550 - 00:01:52.154, Speaker C: Last Tuesday, we had our kind of review of the year recaps, best product, best founder that we met up and coming company, things like that. So this episode is going to be different. We're talking about 2024 predictions. Santi said he was bringing five. He brought 13. So we are going to, we're going to walk through maybe all 13 of them, and then if you stay until the end, we might give you some price predictions here. Not financial advice, obviously.
00:01:52.974 - 00:01:54.134, Speaker B: Santa, you want to kick us off?
00:01:54.174 - 00:01:56.034, Speaker C: What is your first prediction?
00:01:56.814 - 00:01:57.638, Speaker B: I'll be very brief.
00:01:57.686 - 00:02:10.354, Speaker A: 2024 is a risk on year. Rates are down, liquidity is injected into the system, and. But maybe we have a shorter cycle. I feel really good about 2024, not so much about the second half in 2025.
00:02:13.774 - 00:02:18.510, Speaker C: Does that just apply to crypto, or do you think things like Nasdaq and everything rips?
00:02:18.622 - 00:02:19.274, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:20.054 - 00:02:25.658, Speaker C: Election year interest rates, what markets predicting two rate cuts, but maybe we do three.
00:02:25.846 - 00:02:26.546, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:26.690 - 00:02:27.018, Speaker C: Watch.
00:02:27.066 - 00:02:47.654, Speaker A: Money market flows away from money market accounts and into the market. And naturally, crypto hits a bit in a very meaningful way. Retail is still very much scarred. But I'll get later on to predictions. But where that money is going to flow is very different than last cycles. It's going to be mostly Solana and other chains.
00:02:48.354 - 00:03:12.764, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it ties into my RWA idea from last Tuesday, which was that RWAs were a bear market phenomena. And RWAs are obviously still exciting, bringing off chain assets on chain. But when theres Defi summer led by restaking, which ill talk about in a little bit, and all these other things, and tech stocks are ripping again, the last thing you want to do is plop your money into a 4% Treasuries, right?
00:03:13.544 - 00:03:27.668, Speaker A: Categorically, gambling is a huge category. See Mark Cuban, Steve Cohen. It is on the rise and so it's not stopping. And people can express that in a 24/7 market. My second prediction. You want to hear it?
00:03:27.756 - 00:03:28.556, Speaker B: Let's hear it.
00:03:28.700 - 00:03:32.428, Speaker A: Solana, no surprise, closes in on the market cap of ETH.
00:03:32.596 - 00:03:33.756, Speaker B: I've been very public about this.
00:03:33.780 - 00:03:35.196, Speaker A: I don't see a reason why Solana.
00:03:35.300 - 00:03:39.476, Speaker B: Shouldn'T be worth as much as Ethereum as an ecosystem.
00:03:39.620 - 00:03:53.174, Speaker C: All right, so let's update the probability, I think a month ago or maybe six weeks ago, you said 20% chance Solana flips ETH. What is your updated probability that Solana flips ETH? And is that by end of 2024?
00:03:53.474 - 00:04:16.926, Speaker A: Look, I mean, you could do probabilities and, like, there's an expected value kind of calculation. You can do a range of outcomes. I'll keep it very simplistic. I look at Ethereum is worth roughly 265 billion. Solana is worth roughly 65 billion. So the ratio of the market cap there is like a quarter, give or take 23.7%. I basically think that two xs over.
00:04:16.950 - 00:04:20.846, Speaker B: The next year, year and a half, let's call it a year, end of 2024.
00:04:20.870 - 00:04:24.358, Speaker A: I'm saying the market share of Solana.
00:04:24.406 - 00:04:27.434, Speaker B: Relative to Ethereum, two x's.
00:04:31.174 - 00:04:33.278, Speaker C: All right, so what is sole ETH right now?
00:04:33.446 - 00:04:36.590, Speaker A: Sol exactly. Sole ETH right now is at 0.06.
00:04:36.742 - 00:04:39.970, Speaker B: I'm saying that goes to, like point.
00:04:40.082 - 00:04:41.946, Speaker A: Uh, sorry, the all time it's at.
00:04:41.970 - 00:04:45.090, Speaker C: Point, it's a, .04 right?
00:04:45.122 - 00:04:50.890, Speaker A: Right. The lowest it went was 0.06. Uh, right now it's what a point.
00:04:50.962 - 00:04:51.894, Speaker B: Uh oh.
00:04:54.074 - 00:04:56.570, Speaker A: Sol ETH is 0.04, correct.
00:04:56.722 - 00:05:00.370, Speaker B: The highest it was like when Seoul peak was.
00:05:00.402 - 00:05:03.146, Speaker A: .06 I'm saying it probably goes to.
00:05:03.170 - 00:05:07.774, Speaker B: Like 0.15 to 0.20.15 to 0.2.
00:05:07.854 - 00:05:11.294, Speaker C: So three xs basically sold to eat three xs.
00:05:11.414 - 00:05:13.794, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a couple of ways to look at it.
00:05:14.334 - 00:05:15.142, Speaker C: You also.
00:05:15.278 - 00:05:22.654, Speaker A: It's a tricky exercise because I also think ETH catches a bid, right? So, like, ETH probably goes through all time highs as well. So if ETH is sitting at like.
00:05:22.694 - 00:05:26.862, Speaker B: Five to 10,000, you know, then that.
00:05:26.918 - 00:05:46.054, Speaker A: Also, like that also confusion by math, like how much flows are we going to get into crypto and how does that. So there's a couple of ways I slice it. The more simplistic, just to recap, I'm going to just say the percentage. Like, if you look at the aggregate market cap of Ethereum, not combined with l two s and all that stuff, just ETH as an asset, and Solana.
00:05:46.754 - 00:05:49.386, Speaker B: I think that market cap, percentage of.
00:05:49.410 - 00:05:51.854, Speaker A: Market cap will grow meaningfully.
00:05:53.194 - 00:05:58.274, Speaker B: So that is again, 24% today.
00:05:58.354 - 00:05:59.946, Speaker A: I think that can reasonably go to.
00:05:59.970 - 00:06:03.302, Speaker B: 40% to 50% at the end of 2024.
00:06:03.438 - 00:06:15.074, Speaker C: All right, give me prediction number three, by the way. I'm going to share my predictions once some of these tie into yours, and I'm going to save my price predictions until the end. But I've got some thoughts on that.
00:06:15.534 - 00:06:25.502, Speaker A: None of this is legal, financial, or any advice. We're all terribly wrong here. I don't know why anyone's listening to these predictions. There is a huge wealth effect in Solana in the same way that the.
00:06:25.518 - 00:06:36.634, Speaker B: Ethereum ICO movement, you already started to see that with Jato Airdrop with, what was the other one? Bonk.
00:06:38.214 - 00:06:43.486, Speaker A: And you have a few in the horizon. I think Jupiter coming in January, I.
00:06:43.510 - 00:06:45.742, Speaker B: Believe is likely going to be a.
00:06:45.758 - 00:06:47.462, Speaker A: Billion dollar airdrop to the community.
00:06:47.638 - 00:06:48.794, Speaker B: It's huge.
00:06:49.814 - 00:07:02.848, Speaker A: That ties into my prediction, which is NFT floors rip. People like to buy jpegs with this wealth effect. And so when you compare categorically, I think floor is two x.
00:07:02.976 - 00:07:03.720, Speaker B: It's tricky, right?
00:07:03.752 - 00:07:08.992, Speaker A: Because as the base asset that it's priced in, that sold continues to rise.
00:07:09.168 - 00:07:10.648, Speaker B: You got to think about, okay, like.
00:07:10.736 - 00:07:18.816, Speaker A: Is the floor on the sole basis going to maintain itself or it goes down. And Ethereum, we kind of saw this, there was some degradation, like price on ETH.
00:07:18.840 - 00:07:21.216, Speaker B: It probably goes down a bit, but.
00:07:21.240 - 00:07:31.736, Speaker A: Some collections actually held up. So let's just go through, like, Matlad's right now is 142 sold. That's like 14k clay. No, Sara is 36 sold out. 3.6k quex or like two.
00:07:31.800 - 00:07:33.328, Speaker B: Eight k. Sm.
00:07:33.416 - 00:07:35.656, Speaker A: SM SMBs are like ten k tensorians.
00:07:35.720 - 00:07:37.632, Speaker B: Nine k. What I'm saying is, if.
00:07:37.648 - 00:07:44.804, Speaker A: You compare, like, the most expensive popular collection in Solana is 14k today.
00:07:45.424 - 00:07:46.746, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question.
00:07:46.920 - 00:08:08.594, Speaker A: When you look at the prime blue chip collections in Ethereum, the prices are much higher. And I would argue that as more wealth, this wealth effect in Solana happens in 2024, these collections will see a meaningful rise in the floor.
00:08:09.934 - 00:08:28.600, Speaker C: I very much agree with both those predictions. So, first, one of my predictions I had, it was huge wave of air drops in Q one going into Q two money flows. A lot of that capital is in Solana. You mentioned Jupiter. I also think maybe marginfi, camino tensor. So there's that bucket. Then there's also, it also happens in ETH, too.
00:08:28.600 - 00:08:36.084, Speaker C: Like, I think there's some big bridges that are gonna have airdrops, whether it's. Well, I won't mention them, but I think there's gonna be some big bridges.
00:08:36.704 - 00:08:40.488, Speaker B: Warmhole. Right? Exactly, exactly.
00:08:40.536 - 00:09:10.848, Speaker C: So, like, that just flows capital, like, very heavily into the Solana ecosystem, but also, like a wormhole airdrop, a layer zero airdrop. That that is a lot of capital moving into the. Just into the ecosystem. Um, everybody right now base. Basically, what happened, I think, because of the Jito airdrop, is that when you talk to these founders, they have accelerated their token launches and their airdrop timeline. So if Jupiter was planning on doing it in April, they're now planning on doing it in January. You know, wormhole is planning on doing it in September.
00:09:10.848 - 00:09:13.764, Speaker C: Maybe they're planning on doing it in March, whatever, whatever it may be.
00:09:15.714 - 00:09:16.858, Speaker B: Like, someone like Jupiter is going to.
00:09:16.866 - 00:09:22.994, Speaker A: Do multiple rounds, and they've been multiple airdrops. And so that's just more activity, more incentive for people to bring.
00:09:23.154 - 00:09:45.346, Speaker C: This is sample size of one. But look what happened to Solana. NfTs. After the Jito airdrop, basically fresh capital comes in. People move from Solana into something else. New wealth in the ecosystem, they move into jpegs. I think that this idea that jpegs are dead and nfts have to become this, like, consumer use case and stuff.
00:09:45.490 - 00:09:46.258, Speaker B: Don't love it.
00:09:46.306 - 00:09:49.094, Speaker C: Jpegs are gonna have a monster. 2024.
00:09:50.074 - 00:09:58.458, Speaker A: I love paying attention to retail chats, and I just poke around. Yeah, always when there's wealth, when there's the prices pump, they're like, what collection am I gonna buy?
00:09:58.546 - 00:09:59.018, Speaker B: That's it.
00:09:59.066 - 00:10:00.162, Speaker A: People love to buy this stuff.
00:10:00.218 - 00:10:23.822, Speaker C: So one of my, so I agree with this. So one of my predictions was huge wave of air drops in q one going into q two money flows. One of my second predictions was, this is one of my main predictions for the year, actually. I have, like, these, you know, 1015 predictions, but like, five main ones. One of them was NFTs have a monster year as crypto natives make a lot of money. That's as left Bell curve as you can get. But crypto, crypto natives are going to make a lot of money.
00:10:23.822 - 00:10:57.044, Speaker C: That capital is going to flow into nfts. I think nfts are one of my highest conviction bets going into 2024. And I think they basically, there's going to be this like, l one trade probably that continues whether it's bitcoin with ETF, after the ETF, maybe it's probably ETH catches a bid. There's like folks parallelizing the EVM, whether it's like suing apdos or maybe say, or Monad, like some of them avalanche, I think catches a huge bid in 2024. After those run PF, I think pfps, that money flows into pfps.
00:10:58.184 - 00:11:11.164, Speaker A: I'm going to go and be concrete and brief because someone said in the YouTube comments that I should be brief. So I'm wondering that I think there's going to be one Solana, maybe two collections that are priced at 100,000 USD each floor.
00:11:12.104 - 00:11:13.064, Speaker B: Oh, I agree.
00:11:13.224 - 00:11:15.616, Speaker C: I think mad lads is a no brainer to get above.
00:11:15.800 - 00:11:21.080, Speaker A: Madlad's is 14k right now. I think that can 50 to.
00:11:21.112 - 00:11:24.724, Speaker B: Then maybe another. Yeah.
00:11:25.224 - 00:11:26.312, Speaker C: If you had to pick another one.
00:11:26.328 - 00:11:28.072, Speaker B: Which would it be? I don't know.
00:11:28.088 - 00:11:46.568, Speaker A: I mean, I listed Madlad's claynassaras because they're cute and the guy used to work at Harry Potter, so, you know, have a soft spot for that, like a 3.6k today. So Quex, which, you know, it's just like super native, but it's 2.8k. SMB I don't know much about, but it's a ten k. So what is SMB?
00:11:46.616 - 00:11:49.056, Speaker C: I don't even know SMB. Oh, it's a lot of monkey business.
00:11:49.160 - 00:12:01.660, Speaker A: Monkey business? Yeah. So tensorians, I think a lot of people playing the airdrop, they're like ten k. Maybe they do a huge run up ahead of the airdrop to like get that 20%, you know, play that.
00:12:01.832 - 00:12:03.228, Speaker B: I don't know. They're cute.
00:12:03.396 - 00:12:05.144, Speaker A: I own a few of these.
00:12:06.764 - 00:12:10.864, Speaker C: Just a few? Just a few.
00:12:12.604 - 00:12:14.388, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:14.516 - 00:12:25.580, Speaker C: I also think other things outside of Solana have a huge, have a huge year, I think. Okay, here's tied into my NFT prediction. I think pudgies have a massive year. I think anybody who raised a boatload.
00:12:25.612 - 00:12:28.056, Speaker B: Of money does horribly.
00:12:28.160 - 00:12:37.760, Speaker C: Yuga and bored apes, doodles, azuki, moonbirds, anyone who raised these like 30, 5100 million dollar rounds. I'm very bearish on that.
00:12:37.792 - 00:12:44.968, Speaker A: Let's put it this way, the arb here is bored. Apes continue to be priced at 65k. Penguins are at 26. That flips.
00:12:45.016 - 00:12:46.864, Speaker C: That's the pair. That's the pear trade of the year right there.
00:12:46.904 - 00:12:56.530, Speaker A: Probably one NFT trade. It's betting that penguins flip board apes not so much because board apes go down, just penguins go up. This is like the game. They launched the game.
00:12:56.682 - 00:12:57.974, Speaker B: The vision is clear.
00:12:58.394 - 00:13:00.534, Speaker A: They're stitching the real world connection.
00:13:01.474 - 00:13:03.242, Speaker B: They're going to crush. Yep.
00:13:03.378 - 00:13:05.214, Speaker C: All right, take me into your next prediction.
00:13:06.434 - 00:13:11.378, Speaker A: Continue on the Solana theme. And this probably is my last Solana one, which we kind of talk about.
00:13:11.426 - 00:13:13.450, Speaker C: I was going to say people are going to stop listening to the show.
00:13:13.562 - 00:13:15.906, Speaker B: It's okay, I don't care. Don't go. Fuck off.
00:13:16.090 - 00:13:41.202, Speaker A: I don't even know why they listen candidly. I mean, this is free melatonin. I remind people they shouldn't listen. This is a fool's errand to do these predictions, more so to laugh at ourselves at the end of the year and say, God, we're so dumb and like, you know, we're doing this for ourselves. No one else. At least ten unicorns are born in the Solana ecosystem across defi, nfts, gaming wallets, AI memes, oracles and deepin. Primarily, primarily defi and deepin.
00:13:41.202 - 00:14:05.164, Speaker A: Why Defi? You're seeing way more capital, efficiency and velocity there. Just look at what happened in Marginfi, Camino Drift. You have nfts like tensor as an infrastructure marketplace. Gaming star Atlas, Rory wallets to the extent that they launch and have a token like phantom and soulflayer AI believe render.
00:14:06.424 - 00:14:08.644, Speaker B: Obviously memes play a role.
00:14:08.944 - 00:14:32.704, Speaker A: We talked about oracles, but really Deepin is a category top two. Deepin and Defi gaming is a third. But yeah, I think those two categories will produce three, maybe four unicorns each. This is like billion plus fully diluted market cap projects. But I. One last Solana prediction and then I'll stop.
00:14:32.824 - 00:14:36.352, Speaker B: The others are non Solana. Go ahead, let's hear it.
00:14:36.488 - 00:14:39.524, Speaker A: Firedancer launches and it is mind blowing.
00:14:41.404 - 00:14:42.344, Speaker B: Say more.
00:14:43.524 - 00:15:00.524, Speaker A: Tolly talked about it launching before a breakpoint in September. I think it does launch. I guess when I say launch, there's the beta now, but I think it launches more fully flash version and it really dispels a lot of the criticism.
00:15:00.604 - 00:15:03.796, Speaker B: Of Solana halting chain.
00:15:03.860 - 00:15:17.750, Speaker A: There's a lot of, and totally been very public. There is a lot of still resiliency and client. There's only one client. So Firedancer has major, major improvements to the efficiency of the chain. Like throughput and like resiliency, liveness. Like it just.
00:15:17.902 - 00:15:18.994, Speaker B: I think it just.
00:15:19.934 - 00:15:30.910, Speaker A: People will see that and then appreciate more of the benefits of Solana. There's a great post by the helium team about the Helios.
00:15:30.982 - 00:15:35.036, Speaker B: Helios. The Helios. Sorry. Myrt's gonna kill the Helios team about.
00:15:35.060 - 00:15:40.868, Speaker A: The significance of fire dancer. People just go read that. Don't listen to what I'm regurgitating in a very stupid way.
00:15:40.996 - 00:15:41.932, Speaker B: Read that.
00:15:42.108 - 00:15:44.836, Speaker A: Take time and then appreciate if it.
00:15:44.860 - 00:15:48.364, Speaker B: Launches why it's own pathfold. That's it. Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:48.404 - 00:15:49.660, Speaker C: We'll put that link in the show notes. Great.
00:15:49.692 - 00:15:49.860, Speaker B: Peace.
00:15:49.892 - 00:15:55.104, Speaker C: Shout out, Myrt. All right, give me your next one.
00:15:55.924 - 00:16:03.224, Speaker A: Bitcoin wakes up, the dragon will rise and we'll say, okay, we have all this dormant capital.
00:16:03.564 - 00:16:06.264, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been around. We're here.
00:16:06.604 - 00:16:25.104, Speaker A: Miners always have the last say and there's a lot of fees that if people are starting to see with ordinals. And I think at least this is my top prediction. There is for bitcoin. At least there's one bitcoin l two that launches and starts a frenzy of activity.
00:16:25.764 - 00:16:28.172, Speaker B: And I'm cheating because I kind of.
00:16:28.188 - 00:16:51.034, Speaker A: Know who's going to do that. At least have one team that is going to do that. And they're very, very credible builders and they've built a lot of projects that then complete the vision for an l two. And yeah, you're going to see a lot of continued ordinal activity, but also just, again, defi. And like a whole host of things.
00:16:51.114 - 00:16:51.714, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:51.874 - 00:17:02.264, Speaker A: So it's going to be really interesting to see how, again, the bitcoin community, but like the idle capital is there and it's going to be put to use.
00:17:04.724 - 00:17:07.784, Speaker C: Who's the company? Who's building it or is it.
00:17:08.204 - 00:17:09.700, Speaker B: Can't say it private.
00:17:09.812 - 00:17:10.412, Speaker C: Cool.
00:17:10.548 - 00:17:12.316, Speaker B: We'll have them on q one.
00:17:12.420 - 00:17:20.304, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we haven't been talking about what's happening with ordinals at all, but very exciting. I mean, we should. We should do a little more bitcoin content going into the new year.
00:17:20.644 - 00:17:25.382, Speaker A: Yeah. You basically solve the security budget for bitcoin miners. Gonna love it.
00:17:25.468 - 00:17:27.734, Speaker C: Do you have a. Do you have a bitcoin ETF prediction?
00:17:29.474 - 00:17:34.130, Speaker A: I didn't want to get into that at all, but probably Q one. Like, it's just. This can happen, right?
00:17:34.282 - 00:17:37.658, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe the upside, like that's.
00:17:37.746 - 00:17:41.906, Speaker A: Do you think this could be like a surprise on the downside, like we actually don't get.
00:17:42.050 - 00:17:42.602, Speaker B: We only get.
00:17:42.658 - 00:17:47.014, Speaker C: No, I think we probably. I think we probably get it. I think that it's probably a, like a.
00:17:47.794 - 00:17:48.698, Speaker B: Maybe a letdown.
00:17:48.746 - 00:17:57.254, Speaker C: I don't think it, like, drives the price an insane amount in the. In the moment, in like that month or that quarter. Um, I actually think probably q one is like, kind of a.
00:17:58.354 - 00:17:59.506, Speaker B: The beginning of q one.
00:17:59.530 - 00:18:14.178, Speaker C: Like, January is probably a slower start to the year. Like, I think there's been a lot of hype going into. Going into the bitcoin ETF, and I think it probably might be like, light flows to start and maybe a little bit of a letdown. However, what I think people in crypto don't fully understand or appreciate is how.
00:18:14.226 - 00:18:23.018, Speaker B: Good tradfi is at selling financial products. They are like you basically this into the selling machine.
00:18:23.066 - 00:18:28.338, Speaker A: You've given someone a whole host of financial advisors to earn a higher fee on this ETF than other ETF's.
00:18:28.386 - 00:18:30.226, Speaker B: They're going to pedal that. Yeah.
00:18:30.330 - 00:18:30.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:31.514 - 00:18:34.334, Speaker B: I mean, it's just the holiday machine.
00:18:34.714 - 00:18:58.214, Speaker C: Financial institutions have been selling commoditized products for decades, and they've mastered it. Whether that's pushing it to the. Into their private bank, whether it's commercials, whether it's whatever it may be. Like they know how to sell. And I think people don't realize how crazy it's going to be to have these huge institutions selling a bitcoin ETF. Basically, I'll put quotes around this for us, so.
00:18:58.714 - 00:18:59.614, Speaker B: Indeed.
00:19:01.514 - 00:19:02.898, Speaker C: All right, I've got one for you.
00:19:03.026 - 00:19:03.814, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:05.234 - 00:19:08.214, Speaker C: Did you look into restaking since our last conversation?
00:19:08.874 - 00:19:10.290, Speaker B: I had one, yes.
00:19:10.442 - 00:19:12.266, Speaker A: All right, I have it in my list.
00:19:12.410 - 00:19:16.574, Speaker C: Oh, you have it on your list. All right, give me your restaking prediction, then I'll follow it up with mine.
00:19:18.214 - 00:19:22.342, Speaker B: There's going to be a major bug, and it's going to.
00:19:22.478 - 00:19:40.934, Speaker A: It's going to risk taking is going to be a thing. It's hot narrative, but I think it's going to make people question this rehypothecation of security and the fragility that it introduces into the system. So I think there may be a hiccup, a bug. I hope it's not a major one. I hope it's not when these things.
00:19:40.974 - 00:19:43.824, Speaker B: Have massive amounts of TVL.
00:19:45.324 - 00:19:50.820, Speaker A: But even when we had the Eigen layer looks not fought on them particularly. I think they were incredibly sharp, competent.
00:19:50.852 - 00:19:57.024, Speaker B: Team shout out to them. And I think they've done it in a measured way. These, like, you know, opening it up.
00:19:57.604 - 00:20:06.184, Speaker A: But I am worried about it, and I think it maybe I'm not calling a specific project. I just think it's going to make us question.
00:20:07.924 - 00:20:08.996, Speaker B: If it is all worth.
00:20:09.020 - 00:20:14.580, Speaker A: It and if it is introducing more fragility than benefit to the system.
00:20:14.772 - 00:20:15.544, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:16.244 - 00:20:40.304, Speaker C: So I have a two part prediction on restaking. I think restaking becomes the hottest thing in crypto in 2024. At some point, it feels like Defi summer was driven by Jito and the Solana airdrops. Restaking is going to be much larger. I think it gets really, really. Restaking basically ignites this huge yield farming craze. Super high risk, pointless tokens everywhere.
00:20:40.304 - 00:21:09.320, Speaker C: Restakers are going to layer several different layers on top of them simultaneously. Restaking basically becomes the hottest thing, and then the narrative about ETH shifts from ETH is money to back to ETH is yield. Restaking becomes incredibly hot. I think it also means that restaking becomes the new leverage in the system. Dozens of restaking companies launch and probably goes fine in 2024. I think this ends tragically in 2025. And I think.
00:21:09.432 - 00:21:14.376, Speaker A: Is there any huge unwinding liquidation, like deep pegging, like Oracle?
00:21:14.520 - 00:21:14.952, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:21:14.968 - 00:21:16.232, Speaker A: There could be a million things.
00:21:16.368 - 00:21:35.364, Speaker C: Well, first off. First off, I think there'll be a huge restaking related slashing event that will occur. So that's one bucket, but I think the other bucket is just like, there's a lot of claims on the same underlying ETH. And, yeah, that's just, that's just a dangerous game.
00:21:35.444 - 00:21:39.944, Speaker A: Like, as much as I love financial innovation, we've seen this movie before.
00:21:40.924 - 00:21:45.884, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, here I'll push even further.
00:21:45.924 - 00:22:17.332, Speaker C: Out on the predictions side here. Like, if you think about what is the next, there will be another fraud that gets built in crypto or another Luna type thing or for whether it's fraud or Luna or huge blow up. And I think that will be a restaking protocol. I think you probably get hundreds of billions of dollars locked in value in something. It grows incredibly quickly, and then it blows up. Something happens that blows it up. I don't really know what it'll be, but I think the next Luna will probably come from restaking.
00:22:17.508 - 00:22:19.184, Speaker B: Probably. Yeah.
00:22:19.844 - 00:22:29.144, Speaker A: All right, I got another one for you. AI coins reach peak mania. They crossed, like, 100 billion in aggregate market cap. That's a ten x from 9.6 billion today.
00:22:29.564 - 00:22:32.220, Speaker B: So, like, the Akashes of the world.
00:22:32.292 - 00:22:43.180, Speaker A: Render a bit tensor Akash. More projects are going to launch IO and a bunch of others as a category. I think people are going to go bonkers, and this is going to catch a major bid as more projects launch.
00:22:43.252 - 00:22:48.916, Speaker B: And, yeah, I think, you know, I'm.
00:22:48.940 - 00:23:05.790, Speaker A: Not saying I believe in even the valuations today. I'm just thinking of narratives and I think it's a ten X from here. There's 100 billion in market cap and you're probably going to see one come in the top ten, you know, so.
00:23:05.982 - 00:23:14.074, Speaker C: All right, so here. Here's why I agree with you on this prediction, actually. My dad was in town. My dad was in town, and.
00:23:16.014 - 00:23:16.302, Speaker B: I.
00:23:16.318 - 00:23:33.970, Speaker C: Always, like, try to get him to do crypto stuff when I'm with him, like, you know, set him up on a whatever, like a new wallet or whatever it is. And so he goes, yeah, I actually have do have something I want to do on chain. He goes, I want to buy. I want to buy. I think it was. It was either a cosh or rent. I think it was a cosh.
00:23:34.122 - 00:23:35.282, Speaker B: And I was like, really?
00:23:35.338 - 00:23:42.522, Speaker C: Why? He goes, well, AI is taking over. I read about it in the news all the time. The only thing I know how to.
00:23:42.538 - 00:23:45.026, Speaker B: Do it, the only way I can.
00:23:45.050 - 00:24:08.520, Speaker C: Get exposure to it as a non institutional investor or a non private market person is buying Nvidia. Nvidia seems like crazy overvalued right now. Like, missed the trade. So let me get exposure to AI. And he's like, I read in a newsletter that Akash is like, is the. Is the AI play? And I was just sitting there being like.
00:24:08.552 - 00:24:11.584, Speaker A: And he bought it and he got it so outperformed.
00:24:11.704 - 00:24:12.344, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:12.504 - 00:24:15.640, Speaker C: And I was just saying that if.
00:24:15.672 - 00:24:19.916, Speaker B: That isn't, like, peek into what is.
00:24:19.940 - 00:24:22.508, Speaker C: Going to happen in 2024, like, I don't know.
00:24:22.676 - 00:24:25.076, Speaker A: Are you saying your dad. A is retail, b is a left.
00:24:25.180 - 00:24:26.464, Speaker B: Like, left curve.
00:24:28.644 - 00:24:30.544, Speaker A: You're in for a holiday treat, my man.
00:24:33.364 - 00:24:37.396, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to talk about whether or not, I mean, my dad buys crypto like it's retail.
00:24:37.500 - 00:24:38.584, Speaker B: That's what I'll say.
00:24:39.324 - 00:24:41.492, Speaker A: Honestly, probably outperform most funds.
00:24:41.588 - 00:24:56.284, Speaker C: My dad buys crypto like it's retail. I mean, because he's not sitting here reading about, you know, makers endgame. Like, that's when you start to like, he's not an institutional investor trying to, like, right, bell curve it, getting all, you know, reading 50 page research reports. He's not sitting in the middle of.
00:24:56.664 - 00:24:59.080, Speaker A: Institutions way, way too much credit.
00:24:59.232 - 00:25:01.736, Speaker B: I don't think many, by the way.
00:25:01.760 - 00:25:17.656, Speaker C: For what it's worth, I think institutions are no different than retail. Institutions are going to sell that, sell the top, excuse me. Are going to ape into the top and sell the bottom like they always do. They're just people at these companies. So I like the AI prediction. I didn't have that on any of my predictions. I didn't have AI on any of my predictions, but I actually liked it.
00:25:17.720 - 00:25:17.992, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:18.048 - 00:25:19.088, Speaker A: My next one was restaking.
00:25:19.136 - 00:25:20.124, Speaker B: We covered that.
00:25:20.544 - 00:25:30.444, Speaker C: All right, I got one for you. All right. I think the defi Ogs, the ETH defi Ogs help take crypto mainstream. I think.
00:25:32.264 - 00:25:33.088, Speaker B: You will have a.
00:25:33.176 - 00:26:14.726, Speaker C: So I think if you look back at the last market, DeFi was the first thing to really catch the bid, and then it underperformed everything else in 20. 212-022-2023 but everything but that market kind of kicked off with bitcoin first with Paul Tudor Jones, fastest horse in the race. Then capital flowed into Defi summer. And for the last three years, it's been pretty quiet in Defi land. And I think when you look at what Cain is doing with Infinix, Leshner is doing with Superstate, Stani is now doing with Avara. They acquired family, this kind of group of companies now. And what Hayden's doing with Uniswap, I think Defi Ogs have a huge resurgence and a massive year.
00:26:14.726 - 00:26:35.102, Speaker C: I'm not saying, like, those coins, those tokens are necessarily going to do best, but I think they help, whether it's the uniswap wallet, whether it's Stani with Avara and, like, social fi and, like, the family app that they acquired, like, I think they help us take us. They help take us mainstream. Not like a consumer founder coming in and playing in crypto.
00:26:35.158 - 00:26:44.238, Speaker A: I disagree with that. As much as I love DeFi, I don't agree with that. I didn't have Defi even in my predictions.
00:26:44.406 - 00:26:45.670, Speaker B: And maybe that's not because.
00:26:45.782 - 00:26:48.878, Speaker A: And maybe that's, well, you did.
00:26:48.966 - 00:26:49.398, Speaker B: You did.
00:26:49.446 - 00:26:50.886, Speaker C: Talking about Jupiter, all of that is.
00:26:50.910 - 00:26:54.310, Speaker A: Defi, I would say I'm more excited.
00:26:54.382 - 00:26:59.598, Speaker B: About, I think, just Solana capturing a.
00:26:59.606 - 00:27:00.974, Speaker A: Lot of defi activity.
00:27:01.094 - 00:27:02.634, Speaker B: And I would not be surprised.
00:27:02.974 - 00:27:05.062, Speaker A: This ties into the prediction that I.
00:27:05.078 - 00:27:07.634, Speaker B: Have, actually is, well, I wanted to get.
00:27:07.714 - 00:27:13.330, Speaker A: They're the next two, actually, so I'll just go directly to that. I think move based languages get way.
00:27:13.362 - 00:27:20.254, Speaker B: More attention, primarily because of security, fixing re entrancy attacks. And so.
00:27:22.074 - 00:27:33.134, Speaker A: It really is about security. And I think this is aptos sui say. I think move as a category, like move as a programming language, I think gets way more attention.
00:27:33.274 - 00:27:36.510, Speaker B: That has a direct impact on these.
00:27:36.542 - 00:28:00.096, Speaker A: L1 s. It also, probably more importantly, full disclosure, I'm an investor, but movement like connecting the EVM chains with move based chains, that connectivity is very important for them to get more attention, to draw in more users and liquidity from EVM chains.
00:28:00.270 - 00:28:01.628, Speaker B: But it's really all about security.
00:28:01.716 - 00:28:08.984, Speaker A: And when you think about DeFi, every most exploits can be boiled down to an oracle problem or re entrance debug.
00:28:09.364 - 00:28:13.900, Speaker B: And move as a programming language, like, solves that.
00:28:14.012 - 00:28:27.184, Speaker C: So I had, one of my predictions was ETH moves. I said ETH moves beyond the EVM, actually. And I mean, we're both an investor in movement and shout out to Rushi over there. But like, yeah, I agree with you here.
00:28:27.264 - 00:28:57.714, Speaker A: He's been a huge evangelist of just security. And I think he's right. Ties into my second prediction around this particular topic. SVM is also a wild success. You have like eclipse. Why? Because not only, it's like a soft way for the Ethereum folks to save face on Solana as an architecture, and I think, but in a soft way, you always have to give people like that way to interact with an SVM. And when I say SVM, it's a lot of virtual machine.
00:28:57.714 - 00:29:00.778, Speaker A: So it's eclipse. And there's another project, I forget the name.
00:29:00.906 - 00:29:31.572, Speaker C: I mean, you have. Yeah, this ties in. ETH moves beyond the EVM, right? Whether it's like Polygon maiden showed you could do this, fuel network, eclipse. Starknet even showed you can do this. Like the counter argument to this is that dev tooling support for anything beyond the EVM is atrocious. It's taken us probably, what, eight years to get to the dev tooling levels for the EVM to be comparable to maybe where they are in web two. And it's not even close to comparable, but it's at least gotten a lot better.
00:29:31.572 - 00:29:38.732, Speaker C: Anything beyond the EVM dev tooling is horrible. So I'm hoping that that's actually something that gets built in 2024.
00:29:38.908 - 00:30:15.892, Speaker A: So that was my two predictions around just developer activity and connectivity of Ethereum. Well, I guess there's a third one. There's a third in this kind of bucket, I think IBC, Cosmos in general, but IBC has its moment. Ux. I've talked to so many teams the last couple of weeks doing more research on Cosmos. I think IBC has starts becoming more appreciated as a connectivity layer into many chains. I think also I'd be remiss not to look at what has been happening with injective and Celestia purely from a high perspective.
00:30:15.892 - 00:30:41.700, Speaker A: And it takes two of those projects to really draw in a lot of users interest into the broader cosmos ecosystem. A lot of builders have reached out that are focusing on improving usability into Cosmos, which I think is a higher hurdle. Like all these different chains, all different addresses that is being abstracted away. But I spoke with Sam Hart from skip.
00:30:41.732 - 00:30:43.708, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Yesterday.
00:30:43.756 - 00:30:45.068, Speaker C: I was talking to him yesterday, too, actually.
00:30:45.116 - 00:30:45.836, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:30:45.940 - 00:30:47.188, Speaker A: Oh, look at you.
00:30:47.356 - 00:30:51.744, Speaker C: He was giving us. He said our website design sucks. So he was giving me some candid feedback.
00:30:53.324 - 00:31:16.994, Speaker A: Anyways, he was very kind with his time. And I've been asking him and others is like, how do we. He made a very good point, which was, when you think about it, Cosmos fix and ux within Cosmos is so applicable in a cross chain world where you need to abstract. Like, chain abstraction is going to be a major theme next year. And Cosmos has always had that problem since day one.
00:31:17.294 - 00:31:20.966, Speaker B: And I think there might be a.
00:31:20.990 - 00:31:32.474, Speaker A: Project within the cosmos ecosystem that really nails it around this chain abstraction. And IBC fits very much into that. So, anyways, I think I'm biased. I've been spending more attention in cosmos.
00:31:33.124 - 00:31:34.828, Speaker B: Not just Solana, Cosmos.
00:31:34.876 - 00:31:37.184, Speaker A: And I think Cosmos and IBC have.
00:31:37.844 - 00:31:39.864, Speaker B: Have a good. Have a good year.
00:31:41.804 - 00:31:57.544, Speaker C: I'd probably take the other side of this. I'd take the other side of this. I think Cosmos has led the way for things for several years, and the rest of the industry has actually followed what Cosmos has done. They've never been able to. Well, actually, here's what I'd say.
00:31:58.164 - 00:32:02.214, Speaker A: I'm just saying perception is my point.
00:32:03.514 - 00:32:06.306, Speaker B: The is my point. Okay. All right.
00:32:06.330 - 00:32:12.970, Speaker C: Let me actually ask a follow up question here. Does what catches a bid in the cosmos ecosystem?
00:32:13.162 - 00:32:18.094, Speaker A: Because injective and celestial, you know, caught a major bid.
00:32:18.634 - 00:32:18.946, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:18.970 - 00:32:24.854, Speaker C: So these. So the app change, like, different things on different things. Okay. It's not like an atom token or anything.
00:32:25.708 - 00:32:27.234, Speaker A: No, that I don't like. Think Adam.
00:32:28.334 - 00:32:31.598, Speaker B: I've always struggled with Adam. I think it's other stuff.
00:32:31.726 - 00:32:34.326, Speaker C: Okay, then I tend to. Okay, then I would. Then I would agree with that.
00:32:34.350 - 00:32:34.558, Speaker B: Different.
00:32:34.606 - 00:32:36.350, Speaker C: I mean, dydi out.
00:32:36.422 - 00:32:42.774, Speaker A: Fantastic research. And part of my greater appreciation.
00:32:42.854 - 00:32:43.206, Speaker C: Look, it's.
00:32:43.230 - 00:32:43.982, Speaker A: It's hard.
00:32:44.158 - 00:32:44.726, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:44.830 - 00:32:48.230, Speaker C: Effort, capital is putting the cosmos runs back.
00:32:48.422 - 00:32:49.014, Speaker A: Good stuff.
00:32:49.054 - 00:32:49.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:49.526 - 00:32:54.210, Speaker A: I still need to learn way more. And look, I have, like, ten calls with Cosmos builders over the next two weeks.
00:32:54.242 - 00:32:54.814, Speaker B: So.
00:32:59.114 - 00:33:01.450, Speaker A: You want to go next? I have two more and then a.
00:33:01.482 - 00:33:04.578, Speaker B: Discussion, but I have two. All right, everyone.
00:33:04.626 - 00:33:35.630, Speaker C: So we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks 8th ever digital asset summit. Das. This is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard Charter FIS, JPMorgan framework folks coming out.
00:33:35.630 - 00:34:05.164, Speaker C: Wintermute Vanek Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, of view from the buy side. Three, rwas them tokenization and stable coins for global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code.
00:34:05.164 - 00:34:38.596, Speaker C: It is Empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockbuster works to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on the screen, it's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks.
00:34:38.596 - 00:35:15.654, Speaker C: If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address. Or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered. Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm. On chain. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack.
00:35:15.654 - 00:35:28.670, Speaker C: So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO forward slash empire. That's Harpy. H a r p I e I o. Empire. If you want it to be even.
00:35:28.702 - 00:35:30.634, Speaker B: Easier, just click the link in the show notes.
00:35:31.974 - 00:35:37.734, Speaker C: Do you have any l two predictions? Like what happens with optimism? Your big investor in arbitrum like ZKC.
00:35:37.774 - 00:35:40.804, Speaker A: I have too much money here to make.
00:35:41.464 - 00:35:56.080, Speaker C: I mean, I've already given you my predictions on l two s, which is any push back strongly, but I'll give it again. And I'm curious what you think, because last time we talked about it was a couple of weeks ago. I think there's basically two things that happen with l two s. One is.
00:35:56.192 - 00:36:00.008, Speaker B: There'S a big, all of them try to rebrand.
00:36:00.056 - 00:36:19.924, Speaker C: Is something about parallelizing the eVm. Here are my big buckets of l two predictions. One is they all start to talk about like parallelizing the evm. That's one thing they wake up to, the fact that they should have done that years ago, and now they all kind of scramble and race to try to do it. Second thing is that I don't think.
00:36:20.084 - 00:36:23.604, Speaker B: ZK will have the huge year that.
00:36:23.644 - 00:36:26.984, Speaker C: Everyone thinks it'll have in 2024. I still think it's a little too early.
00:36:27.804 - 00:36:29.704, Speaker A: My scroll bag's not gonna do well.
00:36:30.244 - 00:37:07.822, Speaker C: I'm sure you'll be fine. I don't think any, I don't think anyone solves interoperability for l two s in 2024. One day they will, but I don't think that's a 2024 thing. And the big thing that we've talked about is I think l two s follow blast and add native yield and it gets out of hand pretty quickly. And I think eventually bridges start offering native yield and everyone starts offering native yield. And between l two's offering yield, I think the blast people really underestimated how successful blast was going to be and continues to be. And, you know, like that, that capital is sticky.
00:37:07.822 - 00:37:10.278, Speaker C: Like that capital is not moving back to the main chain.
00:37:10.326 - 00:37:10.510, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:10.542 - 00:37:21.318, Speaker C: Once it's on blast, like you don't really see money go onto an l two, then back to ETH, it kind of just sits there. So I think a lot of l two s are going to add native yield and it's going to get out of hand pretty quickly.
00:37:21.406 - 00:37:22.034, Speaker B: So.
00:37:23.774 - 00:37:43.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I have two more around this narrative shift. I think ethereum and inspired, like Vitalik's post yesterday, I think was offered a good window into what might happen. I think Ethereum community changes this narrative away from ultrasound money and figures out a different term.
00:37:44.114 - 00:37:46.458, Speaker B: And maybe it's, I pegged it as.
00:37:46.466 - 00:38:13.384, Speaker A: Like monetary premium more so, like away from ultrasound money more towards like we're the daddy chain. Everyone else connects to us, but we're like the daddy chain. And then you figure out like economic arrangements within between chains. So whether it's monetary premium or base asset, I don't know. But I think it shifts away from, away from like this. We're burning so much ETH. Cause fees are really high.
00:38:14.124 - 00:38:15.732, Speaker B: And I think that moment happens when.
00:38:15.748 - 00:38:17.826, Speaker A: You start seeing way more usage.
00:38:18.020 - 00:38:22.554, Speaker B: You're already seeing more dex activity, more volume in Solana.
00:38:23.134 - 00:38:34.874, Speaker A: And so that continues. In the face of that, I think the Ethereum community rebrands itself and says maybe because l two s also have much more activity. I think.
00:38:37.414 - 00:38:38.430, Speaker B: It almost feels like you're.
00:38:38.462 - 00:38:55.978, Speaker A: Bragging about how fat your margin is. And I don't think that ever has played well. Like, you don't see lvmh saying, oh, you're buying a bag. Yeah, our margin's like 80%, you dumb idiot. We're manufacturing in China, same leather as like, normal brands, but we're, we, you.
00:38:55.986 - 00:39:00.594, Speaker B: Know what I mean? Like, you never want to, like, be. And I think that's, that narrative will.
00:39:00.634 - 00:39:03.814, Speaker A: Change because I think it, it ultimately.
00:39:04.314 - 00:39:07.002, Speaker B: Sort of like, you never want to.
00:39:07.178 - 00:39:14.514, Speaker A: Be bragging about how fat your margin is. And I think that's, that's basically how sound ultrasound money is.
00:39:14.894 - 00:39:24.234, Speaker B: Every time I see this chart of like, you know, we keep burning more ETH, it's like, yeah, but like, are users also going up? Is activity going up?
00:39:25.014 - 00:39:27.678, Speaker A: Like, are you onboarding more people relative to other ecosystems?
00:39:27.726 - 00:39:29.794, Speaker B: And I think there will be a shift.
00:39:30.454 - 00:39:37.238, Speaker A: And I think it starts with l two s being more successful and onboarding more people and building great products, which I think is a thing.
00:39:37.286 - 00:39:37.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:38.584 - 00:39:46.164, Speaker A: I don't want to impress on people that I don't believe Ethereum is going to be a viable ecosystem. I think it will serve its very clear purpose for certain use cases.
00:39:46.984 - 00:39:47.584, Speaker B: I agree.
00:39:47.664 - 00:39:56.204, Speaker C: There's a phenomenal piece by dBA. I think it was John Sharp who wrote it called ETH is not money. ETH is not ultrasound money.
00:39:57.824 - 00:40:00.096, Speaker A: I also want to give a shout out to people that as you think.
00:40:00.120 - 00:40:06.814, Speaker B: About how fast things move, that you should listen to. DBA is one for sure.
00:40:07.754 - 00:40:12.698, Speaker A: Logan, the frictionless guy, his podcast, also.
00:40:12.746 - 00:40:15.330, Speaker B: Really good from a technical standpoint, has.
00:40:15.402 - 00:40:37.954, Speaker A: Helped me understand other ecosystems much, much better. Yeah, those two are really good pieces of content. Last 113 for me, 13. Coinbase becomes a bank. Full on bank. There is no reason why you shouldn't be using Coinbase for everything.
00:40:38.614 - 00:40:41.326, Speaker B: And I think Brian is builder that.
00:40:41.350 - 00:40:43.062, Speaker A: He is, he's going to do that.
00:40:43.238 - 00:40:45.510, Speaker B: And I think Coinbase has a very.
00:40:45.582 - 00:40:56.758, Speaker A: Good shot at becoming a top ten financial institution in the United States and globally. And naturally, I'm biased and I have exposure.
00:40:56.926 - 00:40:59.142, Speaker B: But as we start thinking about price.
00:40:59.198 - 00:41:01.990, Speaker A: I think this is a $100 billion.
00:41:02.022 - 00:41:10.194, Speaker B: Plus company, at least, and it's sitting at like 36 shy of 40.
00:41:10.774 - 00:41:19.438, Speaker A: I think if they really get. Again, I don't want to just say blows because look, in a bull market, everything blows. Past all time highs.
00:41:19.606 - 00:41:25.634, Speaker B: I'm just categorically going to say vaporware and real stuff.
00:41:25.794 - 00:42:09.580, Speaker A: Maybe vaporware more than real stuff. But I think when I think about like a bet that I can make probably with the most amount of conviction, because it gets me very excited about the first, second and many order effects that it can have on the ecosystem. Is Coinbase becoming, like this financial institution. It plays into the ETF narrative. It plays into ETF, it plays into onboarding. It plays into, like, onboarding people not just to buy stuff on Coinbase app, but also base, and onboarding into, like, this App Store. It also plays into their focus on funding, like, non speculative use cases like Blackbird and loyalty programs.
00:42:09.580 - 00:42:12.820, Speaker A: And like, I just think this is like, I'll say it over and over again.
00:42:12.852 - 00:42:14.516, Speaker B: I. And when I tweeted, Brian was like.
00:42:14.540 - 00:42:20.976, Speaker A: Very, like, humble about it. But I liken it to this is like an iPhone moment where base will be.
00:42:21.080 - 00:42:23.368, Speaker B: When you pop up your iPhone, you.
00:42:23.416 - 00:42:28.768, Speaker A: Have a set of apps that are pre loaded. And in the very first versions of.
00:42:28.776 - 00:42:30.656, Speaker B: The iPhone, there's not much.
00:42:30.760 - 00:42:38.760, Speaker A: And Internet was kind of expensive. Now we're figuring all these things out. Now you're going to see more apps there that are not just swap and buy.
00:42:38.912 - 00:42:42.434, Speaker B: It's like, stitch it to your daily.
00:42:42.514 - 00:42:52.330, Speaker A: Interactions when you go to restaurants, when you do things social. And so that becomes, I guess, like, I'm not. I wasn't ready to make it a 2024 prediction, but, like, over the next.
00:42:52.362 - 00:42:55.402, Speaker B: Five years, the percentage of non speculative.
00:42:55.498 - 00:42:57.778, Speaker A: Use cases in crypto will grow.
00:42:57.906 - 00:43:05.954, Speaker B: And in large part, base is playing a central role in that. And so, yeah, that was my last prediction.
00:43:06.074 - 00:43:30.354, Speaker C: Yeah, I love that prediction. I've been speaking with some folks in, still talking to some of the big companies, the big brands of the world, and they basically said base is the biggest unlock they've ever had. They can't go tell their, they can't tell their CEO. They're building on something, no matter how amazing arbitram is. They're like, I just can't build on it. And now they're like, we have a publicly traded company that is regulated. We can go build on those rails.
00:43:33.534 - 00:43:34.630, Speaker B: Gigalong.
00:43:34.822 - 00:43:41.674, Speaker C: Coinbase is an incredible. I actually almost tweeted out an acquisition I'd love to see. Is Coinbase buying mercury?
00:43:41.794 - 00:43:48.146, Speaker B: I don't know if you know mercury, but I usually, yeah, they're one of the best. Like b two b banks right now.
00:43:48.170 - 00:43:52.494, Speaker C: I'd say like up and coming, like startup banks and I'd love to see that.
00:43:54.194 - 00:43:55.338, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be interesting.
00:43:55.466 - 00:43:56.346, Speaker C: I would love to see them get.
00:43:56.370 - 00:44:01.938, Speaker B: Into both individual, like individual banking and as well as, yeah, I mean, b.
00:44:01.946 - 00:44:04.414, Speaker A: Two B banking would be insurance.
00:44:04.944 - 00:44:13.764, Speaker C: As more like more and more of blockworks payments are happening in USDC, and more and more of like, my individual, like, most wires these days are in USDC. So.
00:44:15.664 - 00:44:17.472, Speaker B: I actually had one last week.
00:44:17.488 - 00:44:18.424, Speaker C: Where they requested a wire.
00:44:18.464 - 00:44:24.752, Speaker B: I was like, ooh, yeah, one defi Solana project. Same with wired today.
00:44:24.808 - 00:44:26.524, Speaker A: Actually, it shouldn't be saying this.
00:44:28.864 - 00:44:33.754, Speaker B: Did it start with an egg? Okay, nevermind.
00:44:36.134 - 00:44:55.414, Speaker C: All right, I've got one more for you. I think it's a monster year. I'm going to make this prediction every year until I'm right. It's a monster year for prediction markets. I think it's the year that prediction markets go mainstream. I think two, maybe three things. Cause this first is, it's an election year.
00:44:55.414 - 00:45:20.408, Speaker C: The general public has lost trust in mainstream polls. When I used to look at polls, id be like, oh, polling data shows this. Now im like, oh, polling data. I cant really trust that polling data. They dont really know anything. And I think its a monster year for prediction markets because of just an election year. Second thing is, I think whether its polymarket or someone else, they launched the ability to create your own prediction markets.
00:45:20.408 - 00:45:26.484, Speaker C: Instead of the company creating prediction markets, I think youll be able to almost like how you can, you know, launch your own pool.
00:45:27.384 - 00:45:42.040, Speaker A: Shane reached out. Look, I'm gonna, I was an early investor in polymarket, and Shane, I think they might have a pro. Shane's the founder. He, I think they might have like a group of curators that like create these prediction markets that are not just company employees.
00:45:42.232 - 00:45:50.640, Speaker C: I'm talking to Shane about it too. Yeah, I, I've gotten a little sneak peek into what polymarket's building next year. And like, I'm very excited about it. And then I think the third thing.
00:45:50.672 - 00:45:53.756, Speaker B: Is, if you look at why, like.
00:45:53.780 - 00:46:13.804, Speaker A: Why haven't you, did you think a particular market reaches like 50 million in volume? Because right now the most, which is like Trump based prediction, like, will he be a candidate? Will he win? Or is like at most 5 million? Liquidity has always been the challenge. Do you think we get like a market, maybe the Olympics, the election, where it's like a 50 to 100 million. I think.
00:46:13.844 - 00:46:25.062, Speaker C: I think there's a. Yeah, I think there's a 50. I haven't looked at the numbers too closely, but I think there's a $50 million market. I mean, think about, like, why haven't prediction markets gone mainstream yet? They're not degenerate enough for crypto people.
00:46:25.198 - 00:46:27.558, Speaker B: Right. I don't want to make a three.
00:46:27.606 - 00:46:29.894, Speaker A: X or two inefficient dude.
00:46:30.014 - 00:46:35.054, Speaker C: And then when there's for non crypto people, the UX is too tough. You have to connect your wallet, whatever it may be.
00:46:35.174 - 00:46:41.114, Speaker A: No liquidity. There's a mark. There's no, like, it's hard to balance your order book. Like, it's difficult.
00:46:42.574 - 00:46:43.078, Speaker B: I think.
00:46:43.126 - 00:46:45.488, Speaker C: I think that'll. I think that'll get fixed. Yeah.
00:46:45.576 - 00:46:49.504, Speaker A: Basically need to balance it. And, you know, having someone to take the other side is difficult sometimes.
00:46:49.544 - 00:46:51.440, Speaker B: Like, it's. Yeah, yeah.
00:46:51.552 - 00:46:52.204, Speaker C: So.
00:46:54.424 - 00:46:55.484, Speaker A: Do you have more?
00:46:58.944 - 00:47:00.240, Speaker B: I had valuations, one.
00:47:00.272 - 00:47:14.632, Speaker C: I said there's going to be a wide divergence between companies with tokens and without. I think it's going to be. I think there's going to continue to actually be down rounds for private companies. Like some of the series C, series D companies that raised it, you know, five to 10 billion. Like, they're going to raise it.
00:47:14.648 - 00:47:17.184, Speaker A: Like, they're going to raise.
00:47:17.224 - 00:47:25.784, Speaker C: But it'll be, you know, one, maybe two, maybe three if they're lucky. But the token companies are. I mean, the rounds are already getting.
00:47:25.824 - 00:47:33.244, Speaker B: Really, like, really different than they were six weeks ago. No gaming predictions from you.
00:47:34.464 - 00:47:48.892, Speaker A: I do have, like, it was a good point. Like, I. It was. It was the things that I wanted to discuss. I wanted to discuss catalyst, overall risks, things that could derail our predictions in a meaningful way, things that could exponentially, like, yeah.
00:47:49.028 - 00:47:49.740, Speaker B: Oh, I have one.
00:47:49.772 - 00:48:08.389, Speaker C: I have one more for you. I have one more. I have about as big. As big of bag bias as you can get here. But I also think I have a kind of unique view into this world, which is there'll be a new, new wave of media companies in crypto. So going into 2017, there were only. It was only coindesk and cointelegraphy.
00:48:08.389 - 00:48:16.426, Speaker C: And in 2018, as the, like, actually really 2020, like, this new wave of.
00:48:16.450 - 00:48:19.242, Speaker B: Media companies got, like, they were already.
00:48:19.378 - 00:48:22.010, Speaker C: Around, but they really, like, went mainstream in crypto.
00:48:22.042 - 00:48:24.386, Speaker B: It was like, whether it's blockworks, the.
00:48:24.410 - 00:48:30.938, Speaker C: Block decrypt, bankless, like, there was this new wave of media companies. And now if you look today, like.
00:48:31.066 - 00:48:34.134, Speaker B: I think Cointelegraph is decently irrelevant.
00:48:34.514 - 00:48:52.156, Speaker C: Coindesk and the block both just got acquired by exchanges and a VC firm. And I think there's this new wave of media companies that's going to pop up and I think they'll be deeply crypto native and really respected. And actually, my hope will probably end up competing against them.
00:48:52.180 - 00:48:54.940, Speaker B: But I do hope that they build.
00:48:54.972 - 00:48:58.820, Speaker C: On chain and do something with on chain media that I think is like.
00:48:58.932 - 00:49:02.604, Speaker B: So I'm excited to see what happens there. I would agree.
00:49:02.644 - 00:49:06.592, Speaker A: I hope too. But I also think it takes way more than a year to build a media company.
00:49:06.768 - 00:49:13.164, Speaker C: I think there are probably some folks who built in the bear market who end up having their time in the sun.
00:49:13.464 - 00:49:16.088, Speaker A: If there's someone who has a good vantage point out of that, I don't, it's you.
00:49:16.136 - 00:49:18.804, Speaker B: So I'd be interested to watch.
00:49:21.584 - 00:49:44.584, Speaker A: So I think, should we just talk briefly? I mean, we've been ranting for 48 minutes. Should we talk about just major catalyst risks, things that could alter these predictions? Maybe the predictions that you talked about that have the highest conviction or highest probability of happening versus. You know, I know I didn't talk about gaming. That for me was a huge onboarding catalyst. I didn't want to be specific, I mean, I've talked, but that was. I was going to save this discussion.
00:49:45.204 - 00:49:47.264, Speaker C: Biggest risks. Yeah, go ahead, you.
00:49:48.604 - 00:49:55.428, Speaker A: Catalyst gaming. Like biggest catalyst for onboarding ETF approval of people that have been on the sideline.
00:49:55.556 - 00:50:02.060, Speaker B: Number one, that from a flows perspective, most important and liquidity injections you're already.
00:50:02.092 - 00:50:05.384, Speaker A: Seeing in China, you're already seeing in other places, central banks easing.
00:50:05.724 - 00:50:13.304, Speaker B: So that continues to happen. So from a liquidity inflows perspective, that's a huge catalyst.
00:50:13.604 - 00:50:25.548, Speaker A: From an onboarding user perspective, I think it is gaming. There are major games that are going to launch. It may be the fast casual, candy crush, angry birds type of game on.
00:50:25.596 - 00:50:29.184, Speaker B: Chain that has escape velocity.
00:50:30.124 - 00:50:33.964, Speaker A: Combine that with like really good wallet onboarding and ease.
00:50:34.004 - 00:50:37.076, Speaker B: Like, I think it's so that's a huge one.
00:50:37.220 - 00:50:46.824, Speaker A: I think gaming is like going to be, from a retail perspective, huge. Along with meme coins. Like the speculation that has like always been a constant, but it's game that is new in this cycle.
00:50:48.484 - 00:50:51.892, Speaker B: And I think also the.
00:50:51.948 - 00:50:53.676, Speaker A: The low fee environment of a network.
00:50:53.740 - 00:50:58.776, Speaker B: Like Solana is huge to like when.
00:50:58.800 - 00:51:04.200, Speaker A: I compare the activity that you saw in Defi summer, very whale centric pricing out so many people to what I'm.
00:51:04.232 - 00:51:13.360, Speaker B: Seeing now in Jupiter, it is a very different type of crowd and the velocity of that capital, it just unlocks.
00:51:13.432 - 00:51:21.836, Speaker A: Nonlinear consumer behavior across everything that we've talked about nfts, you know, investing in different categories that are emerging.
00:51:22.000 - 00:51:25.980, Speaker B: It just, you know, when you think about, for instance, your dad, how many.
00:51:26.012 - 00:51:29.420, Speaker A: Trades would he do on uniswap? If he loads a wallet with $100.
00:51:29.532 - 00:51:38.436, Speaker B: How many trades will he do on Jupiter? The average holding period for in the.
00:51:38.460 - 00:51:42.396, Speaker A: Stock market and in crypto is days, maybe months.
00:51:42.580 - 00:51:44.740, Speaker B: So the velocity of that capital is.
00:51:44.772 - 00:51:48.620, Speaker A: Going to go up, is already much, much more up in a low fee environment.
00:51:48.812 - 00:51:50.384, Speaker B: So anyways, that's a.
00:51:50.724 - 00:51:51.892, Speaker A: That's a catalyst.
00:51:51.948 - 00:51:53.144, Speaker B: So, yeah.
00:51:55.444 - 00:52:40.050, Speaker C: I have a catalyst for you, which is, I think social fi ends up really having its time in the sun. I think friend tech comes back, ends up something that's either friend tech or looks like friend tech gets huge. And my really far out there prediction would be that something happens with music, nfts, that actually, like, really pulls people into the industry. And, like, I think you could have a friend tech like product, but maybe only for, like, betting on musicians or your favorite artists or something. Or maybe there's. They figure out some integration directly with Instagram, like, some huge unlock like that that I think comes from either music or, like, social or something like that, that could spark millions of people.
00:52:40.202 - 00:52:49.286, Speaker B: And on chain only fans, I mean, don't sleep on it. Definitely not. Someone's not building that.
00:52:49.310 - 00:52:50.286, Speaker A: I'll fund it in a day.
00:52:50.350 - 00:52:53.798, Speaker C: Any, like, really obvious risks that you could think of out. Outside of.
00:52:53.846 - 00:52:54.070, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:54.102 - 00:52:55.694, Speaker C: Bitcoin, ETF gets delayed.
00:52:55.814 - 00:52:56.714, Speaker B: They don't.
00:52:58.094 - 00:53:04.590, Speaker C: Powell doesn't take rates down to where people think it might go. Tether blows up anything outside of the.
00:53:04.702 - 00:53:08.938, Speaker B: Obvious ones, I'd say there's always regulatory.
00:53:09.026 - 00:53:15.322, Speaker A: Like, there's always walls of worry in crypto since day one about regulation. I think if we see a major.
00:53:15.458 - 00:53:27.634, Speaker B: Ruling that so far the courts have been very much, I think, pro crypto, at least, like, you know, if there's.
00:53:27.794 - 00:53:31.898, Speaker A: A major drawback, or, I don't want to say delaying a piece of legislation.
00:53:31.946 - 00:53:34.068, Speaker B: Because those take years, it's going to.
00:53:34.076 - 00:53:36.796, Speaker A: Be an interesting year of the elections. I don't think much is going to.
00:53:36.820 - 00:53:43.132, Speaker B: Happen, but I don't know. I think if Coinbase loses against the.
00:53:43.148 - 00:53:59.240, Speaker A: SEC, it might be, I don't know, the regulation ish. I mean, it's always a risk. I think more like maybe the FDX unwinding, and if it's very messy, it.
00:53:59.272 - 00:54:01.952, Speaker B: Might have, I don't know.
00:54:01.968 - 00:54:02.760, Speaker A: I think it's drawn out.
00:54:02.792 - 00:54:16.312, Speaker B: And I think, yeah, it impacts a subset of crypto. Not much, but, yeah, it's really liquidity. Liquidity doesn't come, nothing catches a bit. That's it.
00:54:16.368 - 00:54:25.432, Speaker A: Like, it's really just one trade. Is there liquidity in the system? And are people. Rates are low and people want to take on more risk.
00:54:25.568 - 00:54:26.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:26.072 - 00:54:35.320, Speaker A: Everything else falls after that. Of course, this is a secular trend, yada, yada, yada. When we talk about year predictions, not ten year predictions, you have to focus.
00:54:35.392 - 00:54:38.384, Speaker B: On macro, you have to focus on liquidity.
00:54:38.424 - 00:54:41.444, Speaker A: It's something I've appreciated over many years. So.
00:54:41.824 - 00:54:44.000, Speaker B: Yeah, awesome, man.
00:54:44.072 - 00:54:46.484, Speaker C: Anything else that you're thinking about going into the year?
00:54:47.384 - 00:54:53.264, Speaker A: Maybe things that don't change over the years? I was, like, thinking about.
00:54:53.884 - 00:54:54.860, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, go ahead.
00:54:54.972 - 00:55:04.764, Speaker A: A lot about, like, new things. But there's actually comical that, like, so many things in crypto don't change and it's important to inform your view.
00:55:04.844 - 00:55:05.084, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:05.124 - 00:55:06.340, Speaker A: But so anyways, I wanted to ask.
00:55:06.372 - 00:55:10.292, Speaker B: You that I have, like, five or six things.
00:55:10.388 - 00:55:11.956, Speaker C: What? What doesn't change?
00:55:12.140 - 00:55:12.612, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:55:12.628 - 00:55:14.944, Speaker A: Like, things just don't change this year.
00:55:15.884 - 00:55:16.556, Speaker B: No.
00:55:16.700 - 00:55:19.700, Speaker A: And it doesn't have to be like bad things, just like, things in general.
00:55:19.772 - 00:55:20.384, Speaker B: Like.
00:55:23.094 - 00:55:24.902, Speaker C: Say your first one. Let me think about this, because I.
00:55:24.918 - 00:55:27.514, Speaker A: Didn'T think about this for popularity.
00:55:28.334 - 00:55:29.390, Speaker B: It's like eyeballs, right?
00:55:29.422 - 00:55:32.314, Speaker A: People continue to be like, oh, TBl, TBl, TBL.
00:55:33.774 - 00:55:53.592, Speaker C: Brand and marketing matters more than the technology. We didn't even talk about da layers, but, like, there's gonna be this. I mean, it's like celestia versa near versus eigen. Like, you know, with the l two s. Like, I'm sorry. Like, I know some of your technology is better than the other ones, but, like, they've got better marketing and better brand. And it always comes down to marketing.
00:55:53.608 - 00:55:55.592, Speaker B: And brand, no matter if you're in.
00:55:55.608 - 00:56:01.804, Speaker C: Crypto or not in crypto. So that's one that will stay the same. People will always chase meme coins in a bull market.
00:56:03.664 - 00:56:14.502, Speaker B: Doge bonk with swift cock on avalanche Coq. Like those.
00:56:14.598 - 00:56:18.154, Speaker C: I mean, those. Those will go parabolic at some point in 2024.
00:56:18.694 - 00:56:20.790, Speaker A: Great post by Shao on the importance.
00:56:20.822 - 00:56:22.478, Speaker B: And relevance of meme coins.
00:56:22.566 - 00:56:25.030, Speaker A: Not just tokens, but just memes in general.
00:56:25.182 - 00:56:27.230, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:56:27.262 - 00:56:49.224, Speaker C: I mean, attention drives everything. So that will stay the same. There will be scammers and, like, some shady folks who end up getting pretty successful in crypto just like any new industry. And I think that'll stay the same. That'll continue happening. The US gets really hot again. That would be a prediction of that will stay.
00:56:49.764 - 00:56:53.372, Speaker B: Basically, I think what ends up happening is you just have this kind of.
00:56:53.388 - 00:57:07.634, Speaker C: Hot ball of money that moves between Asia to us. One year Asia's super hot, then China shuts down mining. Then it goes to the US, then us regulatory apparatus shuts it down. And you saw how successful token 2049 was this year. I think that moves back to the US.
00:57:07.754 - 00:57:09.746, Speaker B: Like, the US is just the hub.
00:57:09.770 - 00:57:10.974, Speaker C: Of capital in the world.
00:57:11.794 - 00:57:13.218, Speaker B: And I think that will stay the same.
00:57:13.306 - 00:57:17.294, Speaker C: People will lust after building in the US and getting uS investors.
00:57:17.954 - 00:57:22.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I had most of those.
00:57:22.274 - 00:57:27.494, Speaker A: There will always be walls of worry to climb in this industry. Those are never going to go away.
00:57:27.914 - 00:57:34.814, Speaker C: Tribalism continues. Tribalism is not going away anytime soon. Tribalism is going to get even worse in this bear market, in this bull market.
00:57:35.954 - 00:57:36.994, Speaker B: I'm starting to feel it.
00:57:37.034 - 00:57:47.786, Speaker A: You know, one day I'm an ETH, Maxi, and then the other day I'm an ETH. Like, you sold your account of the Solana foundation.
00:57:47.850 - 00:57:51.854, Speaker C: I'm like, yeah, sure, you wanna do price predictions?
00:57:52.554 - 00:57:55.986, Speaker A: I mean, we talked about price a lot, but sure. Like, concretely. Yeah, let's do it.
00:57:56.130 - 00:58:10.240, Speaker C: All right, I got give me bitcoin ETH soul and any, like anyone, anything else that you feel that you want to actually give us concrete price on whether it's like an l two, another l one. But the three main. I'd be curious about our bitcoin.
00:58:10.272 - 00:58:11.124, Speaker B: Ethan Sol.
00:58:12.784 - 00:58:17.032, Speaker A: Should we set the stage of what was a prior all time high for all of these?
00:58:17.208 - 00:58:18.600, Speaker B: I think I want to start there.
00:58:18.752 - 00:58:19.288, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:58:19.336 - 00:58:34.184, Speaker B: Sixty nine k, I believe. Ethereum 4.1k ish. Solana 200 and what is it, 40? Right.
00:58:34.964 - 00:58:36.544, Speaker C: 220, I thought.
00:58:36.964 - 00:58:38.624, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm looking now.
00:58:39.364 - 00:58:41.948, Speaker A: Well, the top was like 260, actually.
00:58:42.076 - 00:58:45.772, Speaker B: Oh, damn. Yeah, categorically.
00:58:45.828 - 00:58:49.024, Speaker A: All of them blow past the all time high in 2024.
00:58:51.164 - 00:59:11.934, Speaker B: All of them. I think bitcoin reaches one hundred k. I think ethereum reaches six k. And I think Solana between 701,000. What was your bitcoin 100, you said.
00:59:12.054 - 00:59:22.120, Speaker A: Okay, I have the most conviction on Solana. I'm being probably more in the fan of returns.
00:59:22.152 - 00:59:25.324, Speaker B: I think Solana has more like asymmetry.
00:59:26.504 - 00:59:28.032, Speaker A: Maybe I'm being a bit conservative on.
00:59:28.048 - 00:59:33.176, Speaker B: Ethereum and bitcoin, but that would assume.
00:59:33.240 - 00:59:36.408, Speaker A: 50 ish percent higher on the all.
00:59:36.456 - 00:59:51.252, Speaker B: Time high for both bitcoin and ETH and Solana. More than that. Right. That's a meaningful outperformance of Solana relative.
00:59:51.308 - 00:59:52.584, Speaker A: To the all time high.
00:59:53.764 - 01:00:00.584, Speaker B: So concretely, I feel, yeah, 100k bitcoin.
01:00:01.884 - 01:00:04.500, Speaker A: I think there's a probability, you see.
01:00:04.532 - 01:00:15.400, Speaker B: Like 125, 150k ETH. I think 50% off its six k.
01:00:15.432 - 01:00:18.064, Speaker A: Would be like 50% above the all.
01:00:18.104 - 01:00:20.152, Speaker B: Time high, I think driven by an.
01:00:20.168 - 01:00:23.164, Speaker A: ETF, more l two activity and whatnot.
01:00:26.904 - 01:00:31.444, Speaker B: But the one I have the most amount of focus is probably Solana.
01:00:31.824 - 01:00:33.044, Speaker A: And I think it's.
01:00:34.304 - 01:00:43.062, Speaker B: If it hits 700, that would be, you know. Yeah, at least a two x from.
01:00:43.078 - 01:00:44.114, Speaker A: The all time high.
01:00:44.734 - 01:00:45.470, Speaker B: All right.
01:00:45.622 - 01:00:47.990, Speaker C: I had bitcoin eighty k. I think.
01:00:48.022 - 01:00:53.006, Speaker B: Attention on bitcoin actually is higher, is.
01:00:53.070 - 01:01:08.812, Speaker C: Maybe peaking right now. I think after the bitcoin ETF, people will get excited about the next new shiny thing and that will become ETH. And that's really when ETH catches a bid. So I've got bitcoin at said ETH at seven to eight k. Well, let's call it eight k. About a three.
01:01:08.828 - 01:01:13.304, Speaker B: And a half x from here, two x from the Altima high. Yep.
01:01:14.404 - 01:01:16.464, Speaker C: I said Sol at 600.
01:01:16.884 - 01:01:23.004, Speaker B: Okay. And I actually think Avax is going.
01:01:23.044 - 01:01:28.824, Speaker C: To catch a massive bid and go to, I think, probably 250 on Avax as well.
01:01:29.664 - 01:01:41.872, Speaker B: I think. Look, at first, I'll look at meme coins, look at how it's performed. No, I get it.
01:01:41.888 - 01:01:44.124, Speaker C: I get it in Q four.
01:01:46.224 - 01:01:47.024, Speaker B: I think it, like.
01:01:47.064 - 01:02:12.696, Speaker C: I think subnets catch a huge, like a big narrative. I think, like, app change, like, app chains. I'm less excited about cosmos than you are. And I think, like, this idea of app chains could end up happening. I don't know, maybe it's app chains and subnets, or maybe it's institutional. Like, defi ends up happening in, like, subnet land. I'm probably biased from a couple conversations I've had with big traditional financial institutions and they're talking about Avax.
01:02:12.696 - 01:02:13.344, Speaker C: So.
01:02:13.504 - 01:02:14.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I think.
01:02:14.104 - 01:02:16.684, Speaker C: I don't know, I just. I think Avax catches a big bid.
01:02:18.624 - 01:02:20.152, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the l two s.
01:02:20.168 - 01:02:23.378, Speaker C: At some point also, I. This isn't a price prediction, but I.
01:02:23.386 - 01:02:27.250, Speaker B: Think the l two s at some point catch a catch a huge bid.
01:02:27.282 - 01:02:29.054, Speaker C: I mean, they're starting to right now, but.
01:02:30.754 - 01:02:56.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just looking at, like, if Seoul hits like 700, that's like roughly 340 billion of market cap. And I think all this math is an ethereum right now is like 270. I think. Again, going back to this discussion, it is liquidity. If bitcoin does x, I think there.
01:02:56.172 - 01:02:59.380, Speaker B: Is more beta to these younger ecosystems.
01:02:59.412 - 01:03:06.316, Speaker A: With lower market, it takes relatively less amount of flows to believe that an ecosystem can two x three x 410.
01:03:06.340 - 01:03:09.504, Speaker B: X its market cap.
01:03:10.964 - 01:03:20.356, Speaker A: I think it really starts because of how tightly correlated the space. I think that's one of the things that doesn't change, actually. There continues to be so much correlate.
01:03:20.420 - 01:03:27.108, Speaker B: Like tight correlation space and beta toward, like against bitcoin. Right.
01:03:27.156 - 01:03:35.396, Speaker A: So bitcoin, like, is sitting at 80 to 100k. That's massive. I mean, think about it from that standpoint, the amount of flows that need.
01:03:35.420 - 01:03:47.320, Speaker B: To come in for that to happen, you basically have. That would mean at 80k, taking your prediction at face value, it would mean.
01:03:47.392 - 01:03:51.888, Speaker A: Another close to a trillion dollars flow into bitcoin.
01:03:51.936 - 01:03:59.640, Speaker B: 800, 900. That's more than. That's like, basically, think about it.
01:03:59.712 - 01:04:02.288, Speaker A: That's like 80% of all crypto now.
01:04:02.416 - 01:04:05.804, Speaker B: Like, you know what I mean? Like you basically have printed.
01:04:06.664 - 01:04:11.112, Speaker A: And so, yeah, in this exercise, a.
01:04:11.128 - 01:04:17.062, Speaker B: Lot of it just boils down to what does bitcoin do? What is then the other, and what.
01:04:17.078 - 01:04:24.718, Speaker A: Are the trickle down effects and the relative share of new capital both from venture and institutions and also retail going.
01:04:24.726 - 01:04:26.878, Speaker B: To flow in what proportion.
01:04:27.046 - 01:04:30.394, Speaker A: So that was like the exercise that I kind of went through.
01:04:31.294 - 01:04:32.194, Speaker B: But, yeah.
01:04:32.534 - 01:04:40.748, Speaker A: So a lot of this is predicated on more flows coming in and it is, again, going back to. It's all macro. And the ETF is a huge part in that, I believe.
01:04:40.846 - 01:04:41.368, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
01:04:41.416 - 01:04:48.164, Speaker A: Actually a question here like the ETF. Maybe we should save this for another discussion. But.
01:04:50.464 - 01:04:53.016, Speaker B: I would love to understand in.
01:04:53.040 - 01:04:54.552, Speaker A: What version of this world can the.
01:04:54.568 - 01:05:01.592, Speaker B: ETF be a huge success, but not on chain crypto, not native crypto. Right.
01:05:01.728 - 01:05:04.804, Speaker A: And like, can you see this divergence of.
01:05:05.624 - 01:05:06.444, Speaker B: We've.
01:05:07.408 - 01:05:08.106, Speaker A: This might got be a good place.
01:05:08.130 - 01:05:09.778, Speaker B: To end food for thought.
01:05:09.946 - 01:05:13.194, Speaker A: Can you have a version of this world where the ETF is widely successful.
01:05:13.234 - 01:05:15.706, Speaker B: Catches a bid but the rest of crypto doesn't?
01:05:15.770 - 01:05:17.042, Speaker A: On a relative basis?
01:05:17.218 - 01:05:35.014, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you certainly can. I think that that world is a world where crypto, it's five years from now, crypto still hasn't solved a single real world use case is not useful. We're in the same place from a user perspective as we are today. And this idea of crypto kind of goes away.
01:05:36.074 - 01:05:38.306, Speaker B: And on the other side, you have.
01:05:38.330 - 01:05:48.770, Speaker C: Like rampant monetary stimulus and maybe like an increasingly hostile United States, like internally. And there's kind of like, people are worried about this kind of fourth turning.
01:05:48.802 - 01:05:53.146, Speaker B: Idea and there's a people, it becomes.
01:05:53.170 - 01:05:55.442, Speaker C: The, like the end of the world trade. Right.
01:05:55.618 - 01:05:57.826, Speaker B: And that's people. Yeah.
01:05:57.850 - 01:05:59.182, Speaker C: People want to buy bitcoin that.
01:05:59.198 - 01:06:07.118, Speaker B: In that trade. Yeah. Or the bitcoin. L. Two. Very good, my friend.
01:06:07.246 - 01:06:09.334, Speaker A: I think this is as good a place as any to wrap it up.
01:06:09.374 - 01:06:10.678, Speaker B: I don't know if there's anything else.
01:06:10.806 - 01:06:12.846, Speaker C: No, no, thanks, everyone, for listening.
01:06:12.870 - 01:06:17.270, Speaker B: This year, it's, I will reemphasize we.
01:06:17.302 - 01:06:25.492, Speaker A: Did this just purely for us to laugh at our terrible predictions. And at the end, I can't wait for the next twelve months and be like, God, I was like, terribly fucking wrong.
01:06:25.558 - 01:06:37.448, Speaker C: You know, someone, someone said on Twitter, I was like, how can we improve block works in 2024? They're like, you and Santi need to get more exciting in your voices. I was like, I. We are not performers here.
01:06:37.496 - 01:06:37.840, Speaker B: This is.
01:06:37.872 - 01:06:51.176, Speaker C: There are a lot of podcasters out there who are performers with the crazy faces on YouTube and stuff, and that is, that's not the game. So we appreciate you guys listening and sitting through our monotonous voices and listening to our mid curve predictions, but.
01:06:51.240 - 01:07:02.984, Speaker A: And rambling, and, you know, we need more brevity and whatnot. So I appreciate the hard criticism that what makes us, I think we've come a long way. We've been doing this, but it's just our 2nd, 3rd year we're going on.
01:07:03.104 - 01:07:17.046, Speaker C: We started, yeah, this is our second full year. Well, we start, we launched Empire March 2021, and then you joined, probably six months later, I think, September 2021.
01:07:17.200 - 01:07:24.514, Speaker A: We did a, we did a bait pilot episode with Stani, and then that worked really well. And then we said, okay, let's do this. But it was September, right?
01:07:24.634 - 01:07:29.130, Speaker B: Yeah, we're still here. Still here, baby.
01:07:29.242 - 01:07:35.294, Speaker C: Things about changing crypto Empire, baby, that was the prediction. Empire becomes number one pot.
01:07:38.154 - 01:07:40.634, Speaker A: Highest conviction bet we'll be sitting on this chair.
01:07:40.674 - 01:07:42.570, Speaker B: Because we, you know, we got other.
01:07:42.602 - 01:07:44.544, Speaker A: Stuff to do but sitting on this chair.
01:07:45.284 - 01:07:51.836, Speaker C: All right, folks, happy holidays. Hope you guys have a great new year and 2024, baby.
01:07:51.860 - 01:07:53.252, Speaker B: Big year. Big year.
01:07:53.308 - 01:07:54.540, Speaker A: Let's do it. Let's make it happen.
01:07:54.652 - 01:07:56.604, Speaker B: See you guys. Everyone.
