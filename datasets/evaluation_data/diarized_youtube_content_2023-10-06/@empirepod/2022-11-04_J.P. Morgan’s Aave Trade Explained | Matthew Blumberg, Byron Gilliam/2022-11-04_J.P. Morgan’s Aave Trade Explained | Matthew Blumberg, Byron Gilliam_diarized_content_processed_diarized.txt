00:00:00.120 - 00:00:12.834, Speaker A: If institutional deFi is just for institutions, why does it have to be on a public blockchain? Why not just have a permissioned, if the pools are permissioned, why not just have it all on a permissioned private blockchain?
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:36.264, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today, Santi sitting this one out. We are joined by Byron, the blockworks daily newsletter writer and extraordinaire, the Matt Levine of Crypto. And we are joined by Matt Bloomberg as well, who is on Polygon's institutional team, but does not represent Polygon's views here. So, Matt, Byron, welcome to the show, guys.
00:00:36.424 - 00:00:40.324, Speaker C: Thanks. Thanks, Jason. Yeah. First time caller, long time listener.
00:00:40.784 - 00:01:10.316, Speaker B: Good. We'd love to hear that. I want to focus this conversation really on the JP Morgan news. Matt, we want you to break it down for us. Here's my understanding. So basically, this week, JP Morgan announced that they have executed their first live trade on a public blockchain. The details are that they, I think, alongside DBS bank and SBI, executed a trade that involved a tokenized, tokenized yen JPY and then SGD, which is Singapore dollar deposits.
00:01:10.316 - 00:01:46.104, Speaker B: The trade was carried out on a modified fork of Aave Ark on Polygon so that the interest rates. And then they basically modified the fork of. They forked AVEarC so that the interest rates and the FX rates could be manually set. And then they used Polygon so that it was a bit cheaper. There were also a bunch of other firsts here. Right. The transaction involved like VC's verifiable credentials, which allowed the actual users to prevent the kind of KYC to have like, the necessary compliance information for the third party verifiers.
00:01:46.104 - 00:01:52.560, Speaker B: I think there are a bunch of first here. But Matt, can you just break down this whole transaction, this whole trade for us?
00:01:52.712 - 00:02:55.694, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is really part of an initiative that was set out by the singaporean government's financial arm, which is the monetary authority of Singapore. It's their sec and CFTC and everything rolled into one. And so a while ago they came out with this initiative called Project Guardian, which is meant to explore the potential benefits of asset tokenization. And so one relatively straightforward use cases is foreign exchange. We're all here for cryptocurrencies. And the way that it worked was when you have large financial institutions or really most kinds of tokenization are going to involve some sort of KYC, whether that's attesting that you're a us resident or an institutional investor or a qualified buyer or a financial counterparty or whatever the KYC elements of this actually wind up being where a lot of the innovation and tech happens.
00:02:55.694 - 00:03:51.794, Speaker C: First, I guess we should talk about Aave arc. So this is Aave's permissioned product, where it allows permissioned parties to participate in AAVE borrow latin markets. And so it introduces this notion of a permission pool, where you can only take part in this pool if you meet certain credentials. Then the innovative part that you were talking about a minute ago is this notion of on chain, verifiable credentials. This could be as simple as having a list of addresses that are allowed to interact with whatever contract, but it can also get much more complicated. You can imagine financial institutions of a certain jurisdiction can touch one product but not another. Maybe one financial institution is allowed to interact with a set of counterparties, but not another set of counterparties, even if they fall into the same broad categorizations.
00:03:51.794 - 00:04:45.500, Speaker C: And so you wind up with relatively complex logic. And that's where this verifiable credential thing happens. And the innovation here is really that the verification is happening on chain using criteria that are set out on chain as directly exposable on chain elements, almost like soul bound nfts, where that way you can write up your own contracts without having to get directly in touch with whatever third parties, and you can use this third party KYC accreditation library of credentials, and then you can reference it for whatever you need to. In this case, it was pretty simple. There were three banks involved. It was like DBs, SBI, and JpMorgan. So it was like relatively straightforward.
00:04:45.500 - 00:05:23.698, Speaker C: But going forward, you can imagine maybe a pension fund wants to buy something that's some product that's offered by one of these banks. They might have to reach whatever set of credentials. And you can bake that logic into either the contract or the marketplace or the borrow end market where it's going to take place. So that's a little bit on just the credential side in terms of the transaction itself. There's actually like a great tweet thread. We should link it in the show notes from a guy, Ty Loban, who works at JPMorgan's Onyx group, which is their crypto. I thought this group totally got spun down in 2018.
00:05:23.698 - 00:05:25.534, Speaker C: I'm like, I didn't, too.
00:05:26.354 - 00:05:47.692, Speaker B: I remember when Amber Balda was leading the group, and then obviously Christine Moy had a big impact over at JP Morgan. But I remember Amber was working on blockchain quorum, if you remember quorum, the fork of ethereum, back in like 20 15, 20, 16, 20 17. Consensus came around, and I guess kind of bought quorum. So. Yeah, there's a long history, obviously, of JPMorgan and blockchain here.
00:05:47.828 - 00:06:59.378, Speaker C: Yeah. And then I think quorum may have even like, passed hands over to, over to Microsoft. I guess their azure blockchain product lives on as like, quorum now, which is like totally wild. But anyway, yeah, obviously kind of ironic given Jamie Dimon's wild tirades on Twitter, but jPMorgan's done a fair amount of building and innovation here, right? So this specific trade you can go into, like, you can actually see it on polygon scan, which I absolutely love. I always love to check the chain. Right? And so if you dig in, you can see that there was like a permission pool, like a slightly modified version of AAVE arc, right? So aave the pools, they have parameters, like whether a liquidation should occur at whatever point, what the FX rate should be considered, should it be using an oracle, should it be some kind of fixed rate, what should the interest rates be? So they deployed this modified version where they could set those parameters. And I think the idea is it's a proof of concept.
00:06:59.378 - 00:08:12.104, Speaker C: So they're maybe really not trying to get liquidated on, on this version of permissioned aave that has two assets and three parties, but they set up this pool, and then they effectively tokenized japanese yen and singaporean dollars. And then it looks like it was kind of structured more as a bilateral borrow lend thing, where one party deposits tokenized SGD, another party deposits tokenized JPY, they borrow against each other using that fixed to on chain FX rate. And then like, whatever, you know, whatever terms they use for interest rates as well. So you can imagine, like, if you're a bank, like maybe, you know, you need like some number of singaporean dollars for some reason, for like a day or for like a week or whatever. And, you know, historically you've done this over the counter. You would call up the FX guy at the counterparty bank and they would tell you, hey, like, here's my pricing, here's my interest rate, and, and with this, you can do it all on chain, which is pretty cool. It makes the transfer in custody and all that way simpler.
00:08:12.104 - 00:08:41.494, Speaker C: But it's just a trip to see these token names. You have jpm, sgd, and then you have the Aave a jpmsgd. It's just something you're not really used to seeing. So that's broadly speaking how it works. So it used Aave for a couple of things. They tacked on their verifiable credentials to the Aave permission pool construct. And then they also use that as the borrow end market for executing this transaction.
00:08:41.834 - 00:09:03.070, Speaker B: Got it. Let me do a little recap of that and just make sure that I have everything correct. Singapore has got this initiative to get deeper and deeper into crypto. The singaporean government has been very interested in crypto for many years now. They came to Jpmorgan. What JPMorgan actually did is they basically tokenized these deposits. They tokenized SJ, SJD or SGD.
00:09:03.070 - 00:09:34.470, Speaker B: And JPY. They built an Aave pool. Basically they use, I think it was worldwide. What is it worldwide web's like verifiable. They built verifiable credentials using World Wide Web to provide this like, compliant access to AAve arc, which is the kind of like permission defi side of AAve. And they allowed them to basically swap the SGD, the SJD or SGD SGD for JPY using the permission to ave arc pool. Is that.
00:09:34.470 - 00:09:35.874, Speaker B: Am I following that correctly?
00:09:36.374 - 00:10:01.034, Speaker C: Yeah, it looks like the construct was a little bit more of a borrow, like, you know, a loan rather than a swap, but yeah, pretty much, yeah. And you know, the idea is like today we're using this w three, like verifiable credential, but like tomorrow we could use something more composable, like, you know, zero knowledge proofs. Right. Where like, it preserves that. That privacy. Because not every bank wants to have their outstanding, like, loan book directly visible on chain.
00:10:01.074 - 00:10:28.424, Speaker B: Right, right. And I think ty actually said that in the tweet thread. He said that we designed this in a way that ensures verifiable credential based compliance checks can be used by, can be used with any DeFi protocol without the protocols needing to know about the verifiable credentials, which is really cool. Right. Because it kind of frees the Defi front ends from needing to do these KYC checks. But also he said, we think. He said, we think that their on chain, that our on chain vc verification is another first.
00:10:28.424 - 00:10:52.544, Speaker B: The design isn't perfect. And he actually said in the future we want to use zero knowledge proofs. So that's pretty interesting. But Byron, I'd love to get your take, as someone who's just worked inside of some of these large institutions for a number of years, like, what's your take on this? Are you, is this exciting to see? Is this like a little bit of skepticism? You don't really know what to think about this. You just have more questions for Matt. What's your take on this?
00:10:53.124 - 00:11:27.844, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's super interesting. And I'm very curious about it, but like, I've read the. I guess there was a white paper and some tweet threads and things, and I can't say that I totally understand what they're going for. So, yeah, mostly I just have a bunch of questions. I think my first question would just be, you know, if this is, if institutional defi is just for institutions, why does it have to be on a public blockchain? Why not just have a permissioned, you know, if the pools are permissioned, why not just have it all on a permissioned private blockchain?
00:11:28.144 - 00:12:17.524, Speaker C: It's a good question. I think there's a couple of reasons. Right. So the first is like, you can have a much more trustless system if you have like, you know, credibly neutral validator sets, right? And so there's a question of where do you draw the line on who's institutional? If you're a high net worth person who's trying to trade a JPEG or send a fair amount of money to someone, then you can do it through a bank and it's effectively a private blockchain. But you might feel more comfortable knowing that all of the logic is being executed as intended. Being able to read through that contract and then being able to see that it actually makes it onto a chain, it makes it a little bit more permanent, I guess. So it helps the trust assumptions a little bit relative to.
00:12:17.524 - 00:12:58.824, Speaker C: We've all heard a lot of talk around, oh, what if all the banks just run their own blockchains, I guess, ripple model. But having this credibly neutral set of validators makes it, and we can get. It's a weird time to be saying the words credibly neutral validators, but hopefully that's the vision. And then the other thing is really, from a regulatory perspective, a lot of financial institutions don't really or can't really get into the game of operating what looks like an exchange. And so being able to outsource the legal liability is somewhat valuable too. Right?
00:12:59.324 - 00:13:16.594, Speaker A: So you mentioned high net worth individuals. Do you imagine that retail customers of the banks will be able to interact with the banks on these blockchains? I was working on the assumption that it was going to be just banks versus banks.
00:13:17.174 - 00:14:38.684, Speaker C: I think for asset tokenization broadly, there's a spectrum of what people can and can't do. I don't think individuals are going to be providing liquidity to the JPMorgan Singapore dollar, JPMorgan JPY pool anytime soon. But you could imagine if you're raising a fund and something that you would typically sell to, say, financial advisors, like a VC fund or a private equity fund, and then you need those financial advisors to distribute your product. There's a middle person there, but you could potentially go direct to customer if all you need is that assurance that the customer is legally allowed to buy and sell your product. You can imagine a world where we have tokenized XYZ products and the users go through an app or fintech front end that executes those trades on their behalf. Because the front end really their primary value in this world would be that they actually execute the KYC too, and they hold track of the database of who's allowed to touch what. But asset tokenization is a weird one because there's so many different kinds of assets and so many different kinds of permissions you have to have.
00:14:38.684 - 00:14:48.016, Speaker C: But I'm broadly bullish that we can get to a place where it's not just three banks interacting with each other, trading effects. It feels like a toy now, right?
00:14:48.200 - 00:15:08.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm assuming that it's mostly about kind of cost cutting on interbank transactions, but it sounds, but that was kind of my impression from reading the white paper. But it sounds like you think it could be a lot more than that.
00:15:08.654 - 00:16:04.908, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. I mean, you always have to ask yourself, how much cost do you really cut? Right? When do the gas fees pay for themselves and when do the smart contract developers pay for themselves? When does the smart contract risk become underwritable relative to employing three people, you know, one at each bank that are going to like call each other over the phone and like execute those settlements. But the way I understand it is that like a lot of assets, when they get, when they get passed from one institution to another, it actually does incur a fair amount of cost on the back end. There are like companies that provide those like asset transfer services that tend to take a reasonably sized chunk. So, you know, yeah, it's one part cartoon cost, it's one part just like assurances that like that third party is not going to like mess with you. And then one part, like broader financial access for, you know, albeit like in a not fully permissionless way, it's still broader.
00:16:05.036 - 00:16:30.976, Speaker A: I think a lot of the cost cutting would also just be in the atomic settlement, right? So then that would remove the need for every single participant having like large deposits sitting around. Do you think there will ever be touch points between institutional DeFi and the rest of Defi? Or are these going to be just completely different parallel systems?
00:16:31.120 - 00:17:07.034, Speaker C: I mean, now we're getting philosophical, but I would hope not. Because I think it's really important for DeFi to exist in a format that looks like what it does today in a permissionless, like, just you, the contract, and the rest of the world being able to interact with it as you please, as like, individuals. And then I think institutional DeFi should exist in its own little bubble. And my fear is that in a world where those touch, institutional defi just severely overwhelms it, and we lose a little bit of the permissionlessness that makes this important.
00:17:07.654 - 00:17:51.570, Speaker B: I have a feeling that. Yeah, sorry, Brian. I just, like, one thought on that, Byron, is I don't know if you guys listen to the Eric Voorhees Sam Bankman Fried podcast on bankless, but if anyone's listening to this and hasn't listened to that, I'd really recommend it. It's a really interesting conversation. But I think you could see a world, not that I hope that this isn't the world that we see, but I think you could see a world where DeFi, like, permissionless DeFi is like the playground, right? Like, right now, if you want to go build financial products, it takes years to go build financial products in DeFi, you can build a financial product in days or weeks. So you could have DeFi as this, like, playground of financial activity. And then once something feels like it's getting big enough, or once something you almost want to, like, take it mainstream, it goes into that.
00:17:51.570 - 00:18:21.654, Speaker B: Like that. I, like, hate to say this, but the permissioned Defi world, and again, I really hope this isn't the world that we end up living in, because I do think all this stuff should be permissionless, but I don't know. I'm just reading Ty's tweet here. It's like, tweet number four, tweet number five. He said, sidebar. As a heavily regulated bank, we cannot enable money laundering and must undertake KYC using verifiable credentials and allow lists, was crucial for us for enabling us to use Defi pools with certainty on these points. Institutional defi.
00:18:21.654 - 00:18:44.250, Speaker B: And that just tells me, it's like, I don't know. I even saw the folks who are participating in AavE arc from the get go, like GSR, Ribbit, QCP, wintermute, coin shares. Like, these are pretty crypto native funds. And it's like, I think even these crypto native funds want to participate in this KYC AML part of Defi.
00:18:44.322 - 00:19:02.602, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's a weird state that we live in, right? Where if you're like a winter mute or a GSR on one hand, you want to encourage permissionless innovation as much as you can, but on the other hand, if you have a profitable opportunity to take in the permission part of the world, then you got to take it, right?
00:19:02.778 - 00:19:05.774, Speaker B: Yeah. Byron, what else? I got you off before.
00:19:09.014 - 00:19:09.326, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:09.350 - 00:19:23.954, Speaker A: So, like, do you think this is going to be something that gets a lot of attention in the Defi community, or is it going to be like, sort of like JP Morgan coin? Like, you know, that's nice, but it has nothing to do with us really.
00:19:25.854 - 00:20:18.874, Speaker C: I mean, it's, it's tricky, right? Because there's two sides of the Defi community, and the one that makes the noise is like the speculative side. I think you could probably say this about a lot of crypto applications. Where's the speculation in JPM coin that I can't participate in as a user? Doesn't really land. But then when I first read about all of this stuff, I read about it from a place of pessimism and negativity and doubt. Because we've had so many years of so many announcements of things that happened on chain and never had the transaction hash, you could never check the chain and verify that any of it happened. I think the ECB tokenized euro bonds a year and a half ago, but which blockchain? They didn't tell us. How did the bonds work? Are they were collateralized? No real info.
00:20:18.874 - 00:20:52.456, Speaker C: Right. So it's a little interesting to see something that actually legitimately happened. To a degree. There's a lot of trust. Does JP Morgan actually hold the SGD to back up these liabilities? When institutions are actually pressing the button to send transactions on chain, that's a big step. And I don't think we've seen anything at a similar level of real actual participation from traditional banks. I don't think it's going to make waves.
00:20:52.456 - 00:21:40.710, Speaker C: Despite it being kind of a big deal, the fact that these guys have wallets, the fact that they have private keys, and they're figuring out what the best practices are for custodying and all of that, that's pretty meaningful. Um, but yeah, I don't know, I don't, I don't see it making waves in the defi space or really in the institutional space. I don't know. I, I think that this use case is really small, is the other issue. Right. Like, if you think about like, okay, singaporean dollar, japanese yen, some kind of like, loan, it's, it's not, you know, it's not like meaningful to your average person working at an institution who doesn't really have to deal with like overnight FX rates. Right? Like it's, you know, it's a little bit like neither here nor there, but maybe the next one is a lot bigger.
00:21:40.710 - 00:22:16.842, Speaker C: Maybe it's like a money market fund or like commercial paper or slowly we'll start getting bigger and bigger things. And now that sort of these companies have the mindset and tech in place to actually execute stuff on chain, you can imagine it getting snowballing really quickly. It feels a little bit like the hard part and the infrastructure is there and we've seen signals at least, that there is institutional comfort. It's not hard to imagine. It's a little bit like the iPhone. The hardware is there, the App Store is there. Building the application is just software.
00:22:16.842 - 00:22:24.050, Speaker C: Obviously, building software is hard, but it is just software. When you already have the full supply chain in place, do you think there's.
00:22:24.082 - 00:22:45.302, Speaker A: A risk that regulators will look at this and say, oh, yeah, we like that. We're totally comfortable with that. That's allowed, and that's the only kind of defi allowed. So now we're just going to just ban all the rest of. All the rest of Defi. If you don't have these verified chain Kyc things, then you can't do Defi.
00:22:45.478 - 00:22:53.194, Speaker C: That would be brutal. Yeah, it feels like there's a risk of that, right? I don't know. What do you all think?
00:22:53.934 - 00:23:30.794, Speaker B: I think that's a possibility. I would take the other side of what you just said before, though, Matt, about you're like, that this isn't that big of a deal and that people don't care about it that much. I think this use case is incredibly small, obviously. But the interesting thing from. The most interesting thing from this in my mind was that was just seeing Ty's public thread and seeing how you can just read between the lines and see how knowledgeable he is and how inherently, how knowledgeable that team must be when they're talking about. When you have JP Morgan talking about zero knowledge proofs, uh, on chain verifiable credential verification. Um, I like.
00:23:32.614 - 00:23:34.174, Speaker C: Links to polygon scan.
00:23:34.254 - 00:24:02.592, Speaker B: Right? Polygon scan, yeah, exactly. Like, these are not folks who are, you know, messing around on like, you know, just opening up like a. An anchorage or like a coinbase account, like throwing some ETH in there and maybe even like getting crazy and staking it. Like they are changing things on chain. And that's really interesting to me. And what that actually does is I think it tells the regulators that they need to catch up. So I think there's the possibility that Byron's right.
00:24:02.592 - 00:24:16.844, Speaker B: And the regulators say, ooh, this is a really nice version of Defi. Like, we can get comfortable with this. There's another thing that happens, though, where a regulator looks at this and says, okay, zkp. What the hell does that mean? Oh, zero knowledge proof. Oh, this is actually. Oh, zero. Oh, okay.
00:24:16.844 - 00:24:30.170, Speaker B: And now I'm going to try to actually understand what's going on with some of this stuff. So I think it's just what they're doing here pushes everyone else to just speed up their. The amount of information and knowledge that they need to have about what's going on.
00:24:30.322 - 00:25:08.680, Speaker C: Yeah, I think to that effect, like, Singapore is doing the world a huge service. Right. By being so crypto native or crypto forward, right? Like, you know, when I was talking to people in the UK, they were like, yeah, like, our financial authority is, like, issuing, like, know, licenses to people to, like, run crypto funds. Right? You don't see as much of that in the US or, like, you know, the. The whole thing feels, like, much clunkier and you don't have access to the same opportunities. And having JP Morgan, you know, participate in this experiment is like, whoa, hang on. You know, maybe now everyone, every regular, needs to think a little bit harder about how they're actually going to engage with this stuff.
00:25:08.872 - 00:25:15.824, Speaker B: Yeah. Matt, I want to ask you a couple questions here. One is, why do you think that they chose Aave arc instead of compound?
00:25:18.204 - 00:25:51.634, Speaker C: I don't know. I think when it comes to Aave, we have the PayPal mafia in web two. I really think the Aave mafia is going to be the web3 version of that. They're just engaging a lot harder on a lot of different fronts. Lens protocol on one end, and then you have Aave Gachi, and then you have Aave arc. I think Ave arc was actually, like, a big deal, maybe. You know, I don't know if the product really has much TVL or usage or, like, good opportunities there, but as a press release, it made a huge impact.
00:25:51.634 - 00:26:08.928, Speaker C: Right now, it's like every institution is familiar with Aave Arc, right? It is like the, you know, the optimal, like, way for if you're a traditional, like, finance shop. That's the, you know. You know. You know about firebox and you know about Aave Arc. That's my take.
00:26:09.096 - 00:26:55.044, Speaker B: I have another question here, which is, when will I feel like polygons had a huge week? There's other big news that we could talk about, which is Instagram rolled out, minting for NFTs polygon is the blockchain they chose from that. I know you're biased here because you work at Polygon, so I don't know how much you can say about this, but I'll just reinforce the fact that you do not represent polygons belief. Represent Polygon's beliefs here. When do you think polygon declares independence from Ethereum and becomes its own l one in order to capture more value for matic holders options could be next couple of years, five years, never. What do you think about that?
00:26:55.784 - 00:28:11.430, Speaker C: Uh, if you look at the polygon product suite and like everything that's getting built right now, um, it doesn't look like that's the plan, right? Like, you know, Polygon effectively launched this layer one on its own with the full knowledge that, like, or, you know, call it a sidechain, commit, chain, whatever. And I'm going to get shit for not calling it a L2, but it is a layer one, right? And you know, that was like the stepping stone, right? Like there's a reason why we raised all this money and are sinking it heavily into zero knowledge technology, right? Because we do want to build the ZKVM, which just went into testnet a few weeks ago, right, which is our, like, ZK roll up. I think Ethereum, it's already like, I was having a conversation with someone the other day, like, why does bitcoin have value? And it's like immediately apparent to us if, like if bitcoin was one of the key ways that you got into the space, obviously bitcoin has value, right? That's just like a no brainer. Uh, but for someone that's entering not through bitcoin, it's a much more confusing space. And you don't understand why bitcoin is at number one in terms of market cap. I think Ethereum has reached a similar level of Lindy effect where it's here, it's here forever, and it is going to serve as that global settlement layer. There's advantages to that.
00:28:11.430 - 00:28:57.794, Speaker C: You need your staking token to be as high value as possible, to have maximum security on the network. There's an advantage to having everything converge on Ethereum as the settlement layer. If you look at Polygon's tech, basically, where we're investing our time and money and effort is in ways to scale Ethereum rather than serve as an alternative. I mean, you can even see Sandeep's tweet about Instagram. He was like, we're bringing ethereum to the world. It's just very aligned. And that's been advantageous for Polygon from the crypto native side, because if you're a crypto native builder and you would have built on Ethereum three years ago, but then you saw what happened in gas prices the last cycle, and now you have to rethink things.
00:28:57.794 - 00:29:19.470, Speaker C: Your natural first step is likely polygon. And then if you start thinking about another EVM compatible chain like avalanche and phantom and Harmony, it reopens your world. Now you have to near, you have to rethink a whole lot of things versus Polygon. It feels like scalable Ethereum. It's the best tagline they could have.
00:29:19.662 - 00:30:19.682, Speaker B: I'm just thinking, though, how much of that last sentence I think is one of the most important sentences. I'm trying to think about how much of this is because, so you remember, so last year, last summer, Polygon introduced avail, which was like their, I think they called it like the robust, general purpose, scalable data availability buzzword. Buzzword. Like, basically they're building their own data availability layer, right? And once that's live, I don't know what stage it's at right now, but like, once their data availability layer is live, it makes me think, like, what do you need the Ethereum l one for? In my mind, what you need the Ethereum l one for is having the whole community continue to love you. Because once you move off of that, and once you settle back to your data availability layer, now you're kind of in the bucket of like avalanche and Solana and things like that, where the ETH crowd doesn't like you. But right now, when your roll ups are settling back to Ethereum, the ETH crowd likes you. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:30:19.798 - 00:31:12.944, Speaker C: Yeah, I do. And I'm admittedly not as educated on data availability as I should be, but I think it's really about security at that point. Your data availability layer still has validators. It's its own blockchain of blockchains. It's a little bit more verifiable because you can take subsampling or something and have more clients more directly participate in validating the chain, but you still have to have some kind of staked token or a similar model polygon. Avail is still very much in R and D phases, but you still need some security. I think the reason we haven't seen more talk around separating out the data availability layer is that the rest of the world isn't quite in a place where we necessarily want that yet.
00:31:12.944 - 00:31:40.754, Speaker C: And you can even think of the beacon chain as its own data availability layer, but it's the highest security one where once we get sharding and we get more slots and all that, it becomes a place that blockchains post data like the shards of blockchains post data or whatever. Yeah, it's a good question. How much is marketing? I think everything in crypto is primarily marketing at this point.
00:31:42.174 - 00:31:43.114, Speaker B: Well said.
00:31:44.584 - 00:31:46.924, Speaker C: I mean, we're discussing a press release, right?
00:31:49.664 - 00:31:58.164, Speaker B: Well said. Byron. Any other thoughts or questions on the, on the JPMorgan side of things or on polygon, really? Anything else that's on your mind right now?
00:32:01.584 - 00:32:25.108, Speaker A: I don't know. I guess one question I had was about the scalability. So I guess one of the selling points or talking points was that this solves the scalability problem of stablecoins. And I wasn't sure exactly what they were referring to. I think that was in the tweet thread that Jason mentioned before. Do you know what they were referring to there, Matt?
00:32:25.236 - 00:33:27.602, Speaker C: Boy, I got to tell you, it feels like the opposite because a stable coin that two parties get to interact with. I know exactly what you're talking about. It was the second thread. It's like, look, we have JPMorgan SGD, which solves the problem of like deploying stable tokens and without incurring the scalability issues of stable coins. Like what? You know, I do think scalability in terms of gas is important though, because if you think about these like on chain verifiable credentials, this stuff gets really complicated really quickly. If you're like an asset manager and you're trying to like tokenize some financial product, like, you know, you might have like today you have like pages and pages of legal documents specifying exactly what needs to happen in order for someone to be able to buy it, right? So being able to have this arbitrary verifiable credential, it's not really possible directly on the l one, because what you don't want is you don't want institutions coming in and being like, yeah, yeah, I'll trade you some JPY for SGD. Okay, great.
00:33:27.602 - 00:33:39.754, Speaker C: And then they go on chain, they're like, oh my God, the gas fees. Or someone's trying to deploy a contract and maybe it hits the gas limit. Right. So I think going to polygon is basically for that reason here.
00:33:40.294 - 00:33:47.582, Speaker A: So going to Polygon is for the reason that it's for the cheaper gas.
00:33:47.638 - 00:34:00.744, Speaker C: Like, you know what you're getting, right? Yeah. Like you're not going to hit a point where like you have some workflow where you settle some things on chain today and then you try to do it tomorrow and like, all of a sudden gas fees are eight times more expensive because like art gobblers are going wild.
00:34:00.854 - 00:34:13.944, Speaker A: But there must be a security element too. Like how did Polygon convince JPMorgan that their security was sufficient for institutional sized banking?
00:34:14.324 - 00:34:44.634, Speaker C: I think when it comes to security of any proof of stake system, it's about the staked assets. What trust assumptions do you have to make, et cetera? I'd expect a lot more of this institutional stuff to go to ZK rollups in the future, to be honest. This one obviously launched on the existing layer one. People wanted to press ahead and get things done, and that's a core part of the industry. But yeah, I think this stuff's going to live on gas efficiency k roll ups in the future.
00:34:44.934 - 00:35:18.984, Speaker A: Could it be on multiple chains? I feel like the way I conceptualize it is it's all these banks agreeing to share a database. Basically the essential problem is that they all keep their, they all keep their individual databases, and then when they trade with each other, they all update their individual databases and they have to hope that they updated them the same way. So my assumption is that like the benefit of institutional DeFi is that they'd all be sharing one big database. But then if it's on multiple chains, that would kind of defeat the purpose.
00:35:19.024 - 00:35:19.200, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:19.232 - 00:35:25.324, Speaker A: So is it institutional defi, is it going to be just on one chain, do you think?
00:35:25.754 - 00:36:07.324, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. And I think you're seeing a pretty big marketing push from both Avalanche and Polygon on that end. Avalanche's mission in life is to tokenize the world's assets. And to a degree, you can see in their marketing, Avalanche was buying out subway cars in New York City, which was absolutely wild. And then they bought the train cars that went between New York and Connecticut. Like they've made a pretty heavy push in the institutional space. I think Polygon, at least from what I've seen, is attempting to play in a similar space, and it's going to come down to business development.
00:36:07.744 - 00:36:56.254, Speaker A: Okay, you said they're tokenizing assets, but that reminds me of my other question, which is that JPMorgan said they've tokenized liabilities of the bank, which I don't totally understand. Like, in what sense are these liabilities in the bank? Like, if I have a bank account with JPMorgan, that is liability of the bank because I can go to an ATM machine and get cash and they, you know, they have to give me cash. But I don't really understand how that, like, how that works in the context of a blockchain. Like, I can't go to the blockchain and get cash and I can't go to, like, I can't take their tokenized JPY and send it to some other bank. I don't think so. Do you have a sense of in what sense these are tokenized liabilities?
00:36:56.874 - 00:37:11.250, Speaker C: The way I read it is it's basically like a stable coin that's represented by a singaporean dollar in a bank account somewhere similar to circle. Each USDC is a liability of circle and that can be redeemed for a us dollar.
00:37:11.402 - 00:37:21.114, Speaker A: Right. I guess I understand the redemption mechanism at circle, but I'm not sure what the redemption mechanism is would be in institutional defi. I guess that's kind of my question.
00:37:21.654 - 00:37:39.022, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, in this example, you know, there's, there's three parties and they go to, they go to each other at the end of the day and they say, nice job on the tokenization experiment, guys. Can I get my, can I get my singaporean dollars, please? You know, who knows, right? Like, it's that there's a whole bunch of trust assumptions there too, right?
00:37:39.198 - 00:37:41.794, Speaker B: Cool. Matt, anything else?
00:37:42.654 - 00:37:47.714, Speaker C: No, thanks. This is like, this is the most fun I've, I've ever had. Talking about institutional defi.
00:37:49.294 - 00:38:11.030, Speaker B: You and me both, my friend. You and me both, Matt, anything else from this week that just really stood out to you? It was a surprisingly active week just for the bear market. Like, everything going on with Instagram and their nfTs. There's actually a lot going on with NFTs right now. Instagram and their NFTs. Twitter's rolling up the ability to buy and sell nfts directly from tweets. Art Gobbler has also had an interesting week.
00:38:11.030 - 00:38:14.666, Speaker B: Anything that's just top of mind for you as you think about wrapping up the week?
00:38:14.830 - 00:38:57.784, Speaker C: You know, like, the social stuff is so interesting, right? Like, because you've got it coming from two ends here. You've got like, the lens protocol. Like, I'm going to directly have a crypto native platform where my users are going to understand what they're doing when they submit a tweet or when they send a photo to the chain or like something or collect it or whatever. Then you have the web two side of it, which is, you know, you can link up your metamask, you can link up your phantom wallet, you can directly minute tweet from the chain. It reminds me of that one tweet. Someone collected the first tweet for millions of dollars back in the day, this is the biggest cringe story. Now it's can't get sold for $5.
00:38:57.784 - 00:40:07.938, Speaker C: Anyway, I think it's so interesting that we have these two competing on ramps for users. Are people going to be onboarded to web3 social through web3 or through social? And when you're onboarding through social, you have to really worry about the user experience. For example, there's no cost to the user to mint an NFT on polygon on Instagram that's clearly subsidized. I don't know by who, but are people going to keep doing that when they have to sign a transaction? What's going on? You still have to link a crypto wallet in order to do these NFT activities on Instagram. So to what degree is the population using these things really that different? I just think that we need better private key management solutions for web3 social to work. When I try to check, I made the mistake of minting my lens profile to a wallet that's linked to my ledger. I'm sure I can transfer the profile, but I don't actually know if there's a good tool for me to do that.
00:40:07.938 - 00:40:51.616, Speaker C: I don't feel like, you know, going to Polygon scan to do it. It's like now I have to get my ledger out every time I want to check, like, you know, Leinster or lens friends or whatever. I don't know. I personally super bowled up on social as a way to directly, like, demonstrate how a lot of the, like, great qualities that we love about crypto, the censorship resistance, the composability, that sort of like, you know, like you were saying, byron, like that, that one database where everyone comes together and agrees on things, right? So it's really interesting to see the big web two. I feel like it's been a week of just big companies that weren't touching crypto before taking some big steps into crypto in general.
00:40:51.800 - 00:41:28.650, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed. I mean, I don't know if you listen to that episode we did on Empire earlier this week with Arbitrum, but it was interesting, Arbitrum's team came on the podcast with Santiago, and it was just interesting hearing them talk about how the whole Reddit deal went down. So that's not a new thing. They put out an RFP, actually, I think a year and a half or two years ago, saying, we want to launch this, putting some data basically on a blockchain. And I think 15 different companies or organizations competed on that, and arbitrum actually won it. And they've been building that for 15 months. And so now it's finally live.
00:41:28.650 - 00:41:37.168, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot of stuff. And even with this JP Morgan thing, I mean, people say institutions move slowly. This is one trade ten years in the making, right?
00:41:37.296 - 00:42:14.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, and you can fast forward ten years, right? And it's like, you know, today you have a big enough core group of people within JP Morgan to get them to participate in something like this. But in ten more years, you know, half of the employees at JPMorgan have a lens profile and have interacted with the chain in some way. And, you know, you hit this tipping point really quickly where suddenly it's like, you know, like it can come through like larger, you know, like, like a coup, like an Elon Musk, you know, takeover of Twitter. Or it can come like slowly from within, but, but you hit this like core density really, you know, really suddenly. And, you know, it's going to be pretty cool to see how that plays out.
00:42:14.512 - 00:42:23.200, Speaker A: Occupy JpMorgan, OccupyJp Morgan guys, this is a great chat.
00:42:23.272 - 00:42:33.294, Speaker B: Matt, thanks for coming on so last minute. I appreciate it. Byron, this is awesome as always. Go subscribe to Blockworks'daily newsletter. If you're not subscribed already, we'll put a link in the show notes. See you guys next time. Thanks.
