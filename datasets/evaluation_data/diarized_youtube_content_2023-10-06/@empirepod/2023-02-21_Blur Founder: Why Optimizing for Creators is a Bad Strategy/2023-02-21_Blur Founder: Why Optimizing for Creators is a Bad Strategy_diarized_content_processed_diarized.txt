00:00:03.960 - 00:00:21.754, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We've got a really timely episode today. We have Pac man founder and core contributor of Blur, as well as Santiago, who is actually an angel investor or one of the seed investors. You can correct me here, Santi, if I'm wrong, but in blur. So, Santi, Pacman, welcome to the show, guys.
00:00:22.894 - 00:00:26.714, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for having me excited about this.
00:00:27.094 - 00:00:31.599, Speaker A: Santi, was I right? Angel investor, seed, what do you want to do?
00:00:31.599 - 00:00:40.344, Speaker C: Early investor. So there is a lot of bias here, folks, but I'll be as objective as possible. But full disclosure, there is, I guess, you know, a disclaimer here.
00:00:41.804 - 00:00:55.024, Speaker A: I know you didn't know I was going to do this. I'm picking on you for the first question here, which is, you see a lot of deals. Obviously, NFT space was really hot year and a half, two years ago. Why did you make. Why did you invest in impact man in the blur team?
00:00:55.964 - 00:01:47.390, Speaker C: So, great question. I had the good fortune of knowing Pac man and first meeting him a few years back. And when I reconnected with him, I always liked to invest in repeat founders. I think a lot of times you get to see someone over the years, and particularly someone that hasn't given up and is willing to be agile, nimble. And I read this recently, great book called quit, and I think a lot of what I look for in founders Pac man has and embodies. And so I think he had a very clear vision of how the NFT market was going to evolve. And even though I didn't fully agree with the thesis at the time, I thought it was worth, like, I think it was a piece of the market that I wasn't paying enough attention to.
00:01:47.390 - 00:02:07.886, Speaker C: But then as a result of multiple conversations and then thinking more about his thesis, which he'll go into in a minute, I thought the combination of great builder that I known over the years, plus a big market that will continue to grow, was kind of the primary drivers nice for my investment, Pac Man.
00:02:07.910 - 00:02:21.562, Speaker A: I think it'd be helpful maybe to just start with that thesis then. What was that original thesis and how has that changed over time? Maybe. What is, what is the thesis of blur and your broader thesis of the NFT markets and how they'll develop?
00:02:21.738 - 00:02:44.414, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So first, just to kind of talk about the founding of Blur, because I think that kind of shares some good context, effectively, Galaga and I, my co founder, we started our first business in 2018. We ran it for three years and we sold it at the end of 2021. And in the process, of selling it.
00:02:44.834 - 00:02:46.138, Speaker A: Was that a crypto company?
00:02:46.266 - 00:03:15.156, Speaker B: It was a crypto company. It was on a small niche blockchain, so you wouldn't have heard of it, but it was, it gave us a lot of lessons. But basically, as we sold it, I got really into nfts myself. I minted a blip map as my first NFT. Really fell in love with it, because I held it up to 8th and then sold it and. And I just got super hooked, especially onto the trading side of nfts. And I just really fell in love with the trading side of it.
00:03:15.156 - 00:04:14.456, Speaker B: But I was very frustrated with the existing infrastructure. All the existing marketplaces were very retail focused and they were doing a great job at serving newcomers. But for someone like myself, who is really in the weeds, very active in the space, I wanted something that was more of a professional trading platform for nfts, especially a trading platform that wasn't slow and clunky and wasn't going down all the time. And it was very clear to me that there's this large gap in the space. And especially if you looked at even the bull market, where there is many more monthly actives in the space than there are today, it was very clear that the majority of the volume was driven by these power users. And for myself and every power user that I knew, nothing was really serving them well. So effectively, the thesis, the clear pain point on day one was that there's a need for power users that is just not filled at all.
00:04:14.456 - 00:04:49.534, Speaker B: And then second, if you look at the progression of the token trading market, and if you look at how the infrastructure developed from starting with very retail driven platforms like Coinbase, over time, the infrastructure professionalizes. Now you have Binance, BitMex, Derabit, this advanced infrastructure with all these advanced financialized products. As the space grew, the majority of the volume came from that professionalization of the space. And similarly, we're seeing a similar trend in nfts, and that's really the core thesis that blur was targeting, is building into that trend.
00:04:50.274 - 00:05:39.682, Speaker A: Okay, so maybe, maybe I want to try to like, repeat it back to you and you tell me if I get it right or wrong. Basically, the way that token markets developed was you had Mount Gox, and then you have these very retail friendly things where you can just buy and sell bitcoin, then you can buy and sell ETH. And that was the coinbases and geminis of the world that really developed. In 2015, 2016, obviously, market starts ripping 2017, and then with the market ripping in 2017, you had the development of these institutional exchanges like BitMex and Binances of the world, like Binance's institutional offering, Darabit on the option side of things and really getting built out in 2018 and 2019. And for you guys, you saw JPEG collectors go to Opensea and there's no place for the institutional NFT markets or the pro NFT trader. And that's where blur comes in.
00:05:39.698 - 00:05:41.034, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:41.194 - 00:06:11.400, Speaker A: Okay. So I also saw blur a year maybe, probably for the first time nine months ago or six months ago or something, played around. I was like, this is an awesome experience. Very trader heavy, really liked it. But what I got wrong is I thought I was like, all right, you have Opensea, which is like, dominates the market, great for the retail crowd, and then you have blur. And I always thought of them as two very distinct, different buckets. But what's become very apparent since the airdrop is like, oh, no, you're going head to head with Opensea.
00:06:11.400 - 00:06:19.554, Speaker A: So I'd be curious about how you see that market. And it's like, is there room for two? Are you going head to head? How do you think about that?
00:06:20.134 - 00:07:02.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ultimately in any sort of market, especially any sort of speculative market, right. If you look at the token exchange world, where does the segmentation lie? There's the retail infrastructure and then there's a more advanced pro trader infrastructure. And then of course, there's even a little bit more segmentation in tokens because you also have the institutional grade infrastructure. But effectively it's just retail and pro segmentations. And I think in nfts it's similar, where the only two segmentations that really make sense are retail and pro. People. Talk about verticalized NFT marketplaces.
00:07:02.714 - 00:07:49.374, Speaker B: I think there are a few niches where vertical marketplaces make sense. For example, Ens shopping for a domain name is a very different experience than shopping for like, any other NFT, really. It's like a very unique beast. And so, like a verticalized market really makes sense there. But for the vast majority of nfts, especially nfts that are speculated on, there doesn't really make sense to have, you know, niche, vertical markets. Typically the buyers and the sellers, they prefer, you know, going to where the liquidity is, where the eyeballs are, and ultimately that goes to horizontal markets. And yeah, I do think that is basically only retail and the prosumer effectively.
00:07:50.314 - 00:08:05.334, Speaker A: I mean, one thesis I've heard a lot is this vertical marketplace thesis. So today you have something like Opensea and blur. Tomorrow you might have gaming NFT marketplaces. You might have like, there'll be the JPEG marketplaces. You would probably disagree with that.
00:08:05.774 - 00:09:12.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's hard to predict the, you know, what, what types of assets kind of emerge. Like, for example, like gaming. That's something that can be unique, right? Like if you look at Axie infinity today, like, most of those NFTs are traded on like the Axie infinity marketplace, right? But they're traded in a very different way than like pretty much any other NFT. So I do believe that something like for gaming, I could see like vertical specific marketplaces, but not like I would be surprised if it's like a horizontal gaming marketplace. I would more so expect like each individual game to kind of have its own marketplace, like keep it all in house. But outside of, outside of something like that, again, like there are a few categories where it's like, I think that you probably need like a unique experience to serve the function. But for the most part, as long as the core action for the trader is buying, selling and holding, I would be quite surprised if we saw a proliferation of vertical marketplaces.
00:09:13.454 - 00:09:53.444, Speaker C: I want to take a moment to zoom out here for listeners, for anyone that hasn't been paying attention basically under a rock and hasn't understood what has been going on with, with Blur and what recently happened with the airdrop and maybe can you just give us a compressed timeline of since you started to what has happened to date and feel free to kind of pick your highlights and more curious to understand what are your highlights since you've been, since founding of the project, some of the key learnings, what are things that surprised you most about the original thesis? User behavior? And then we can go from there?
00:09:53.824 - 00:10:10.496, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a great question for context. Today is day 400 at Blur. So we've been building for exactly 400 days now. We started up in January. We raised an $11 million seed round from paradigm. We built up a team of ten. So we're seven engineers.
00:10:10.496 - 00:10:47.970, Speaker B: The core contributors are seven engineers, one designer, a chief of staff and myself. Our engineers primarily come from our MIT network. Gallagher and I. We studied at MIT before starting our first business, and we recruited friends that we knew that worked in trading and real time systems. So, for example, ones from Citadel, ones from five rings capital. Our smart contract engineer was previously working with Starkware and Makerdao under dyebridge, and our designer was previously in fintech at Braxton Square. And so we've been building for 400 days and we basically spent five months in private beta.
00:10:47.970 - 00:11:36.376, Speaker B: We first announced publicly in May of 2022. We spent five months in private beta, basically, until our retention was extremely high, until we knew that basically as a product, that people would want to use the protocol and the trading product. Then we launched publicly, and we launched with this airdrop campaign that effectively rewarded users for providing liquidity to the protocol. And a key point that is basically our holy grail is to only ever incentivize liquidity and never volume. The issue with incentivizing volume is that you just directly get wash trading. You have mev people or just random arbitrageurs, just wash trading the same asset back and forth. As long as it's a plus ev calculation, they'll do that.
00:11:36.376 - 00:12:14.128, Speaker B: They're not real users. But incentivizing liquidity, it's in a very similar way to the way that curve incentivizes liquidity on either side of the stablecoin peg. That liquidity is real, and it allows for the volume to come, because when people want to buy or sell, they of course, want to sell for the best price and buy for the best price. So we launched with that campaign. Prior to the token launch, we spent four months in that airdrop period. In that four months period, we gained a leading market share from a volume perspective. So even before the token launch, we were already doing more volume on a daily basis than Opensea.
00:12:14.128 - 00:12:47.574, Speaker B: And then we, of course, launched the token just about a week ago. And that campaign basically just brought in an incredible amount of attention to the protocol. And since then, our volume skyrocketed. And again, this is all still volume coming from increased liquidity coming into the market. A massive amount of liquidity came into the market. Like we just tweeted today, the blur bidding pools. When you bid on blur, you deposit ETH into your bidding pool and allows you to bid with ETH instead of having to use wheat.
00:12:47.574 - 00:13:35.638, Speaker B: But the blur bidding pools, now there's $130 million worth of ETH locked in the bidding pools, providing liquidity. If you look at some of the top collections, you'll notice there's like, like, on mutant apes, there's like $50 million worth of buy side liquidity present on that collection. And this is kind of an unprecedented change in the market, because prior to blur, there was really only ever, like, a few bids maximum. You know, if you want to sell, like, ten mutant apes, you basically just, like, crash a floor price pretty significantly. But now there's, like $50 million worth of bids, you know, preventing that. And in that time, we've achieved leading market share by a large margin. In the most recent days, we've been like, ten X Openseas volume.
00:13:35.638 - 00:13:53.250, Speaker B: Something along those lines. I need to double check the exact number. But basically we surpass $100 million in daily volume this weekend, which is not something that the NFT market has experienced in about a year, I would say. So it's just kind of been like an unprecedented period of growth.
00:13:53.402 - 00:13:54.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:54.234 - 00:14:01.962, Speaker C: Can you talk about the mechanism to incentivize liquidity? Because it's novel and perhaps why did Opensea not think about this?
00:14:02.098 - 00:14:12.882, Speaker A: Actually, Pakman, I'm just going to ask a really dumb question for folks who aren't on the trader side, which is explain the difference between liquidity and volume and then Santu. Really good question by Santu, too.
00:14:13.018 - 00:14:39.904, Speaker B: Yeah, great, great question. Incentivizing volume. Like, for example, many of the listeners might have heard of looksrare. They launched. What's interesting is a lot of the players that are currently in the market all launched around the time that we started building blur. We started around 400 days ago, about a week after we started. Luxray launched, x two, y two launched, Gem launched.
00:14:39.904 - 00:15:17.676, Speaker B: We basically had to start building from zero, from there, ship faster than the competition and pull ahead. But they did this very interesting campaign where they rewarded trading volume and it was basically you got like a rebate on your trades and they had these crazy gargantuan volumes, like instantly was way higher volume than Opensea. And the issue with that is that that volume wasn't real. It was just. It was just wash. Trading. Liquidity, on the other hand, is not rewarding a trade.
00:15:17.676 - 00:16:15.472, Speaker B: It's rewarding someone placing an open bid or open ask on the order book. So if you think about an NFT marketplace, like a exchange where there's an order book, and I'm assuming the listeners probably know what an order book is, but I can kind of break that down if necessary. But just like you go on, on binance, when you go to trade, you can see the bids and the asks basically blur incentivize people placing those bids and asks. You don't get any rewards if someone takes your bid or takes your ask. So actually you're kind of disincentivized from someone, you know, accepting your open order because you no longer earn rewards when that happens. And so there's this interesting difference here where in the looksrare model, you know, basically there's a direct incentive to wash trade, whereas in the blur model there's a direct disincentive to wash trade. And then what you see is that leads to significantly more organic volume.
00:16:15.472 - 00:16:42.004, Speaker B: The vast majority of volume on blur has been organic. If you look at Hill Daube, he has some really extensive wash trading analysis on all the different marketplaces. And basically, the only marketplaces that have a very little wash trading are blur and Opensea, Luxray and x two, y two, for example. The vast majority of their volume is effectively fake volume from wash trading. So hopefully that kind of gives a little bit more of a understanding of liquidity versus volume.
00:16:42.584 - 00:16:57.044, Speaker A: How much do you have? This liquidity, I guess. And volume is driven by product, the product being better versus anticipation over the air drop. And these care packages that you guys did a couple months ago.
00:16:57.664 - 00:17:00.058, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, it's hard to distinguish.
00:17:00.216 - 00:17:00.742, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:00.838 - 00:17:59.830, Speaker B: But what blur focused on from day one was really just speed bulk execution. So even in private beta, before there was any sort of airdrop campaign, traders were already, there were like numerous tweets that you can see that we retweeted, but basically traders were already kind of knocking on our doors trying to get access because it allowed them to list easier, it allowed them to buy easier. So we already had significant confidence in the product. And then on the protocol side, there is a key unlock because prior to blur, and this is like really in the weeds on the NFT market. So most people probably wouldn't be aware of this. But basically, if you wanted to bid on any marketplace before you had to convert your ETH into wheat, so you had to wrap your ETH and then you could bid, and then if you wanted to go and buy something, you had to unwrap your weth, convert it into ETH and then buy. And so there's this, a lot of friction between bidding and buying.
00:17:59.830 - 00:18:30.474, Speaker B: And what blur did on the protocol side was we created these bidding pools that basically allow you to deposit ETH into a pool and bid using that ETH. And then when you want to buy, you can also buy with that ETH as well. So it reduces, you know, it's a small, small change, but it drastically reduces the friction. And then combined that protocol level change, combined with the liquidity incentives brought a significant amount of liquidity into the market.
00:18:31.174 - 00:19:08.876, Speaker C: One of the things I want to go back to that question or focus a bit on liquidity because a lot of users skeptical might say, well, yeah, you've gotten all this liquidity because there's an airdrop, there's just care packages came out. It's been hard for some protocols, not all, to sustain the liquidity. The momentum after the airdrop curve, which you mentioned, is probably a really good example of they didnt get the tokenomics. All right, theyre one of the first, but still it is the best place to swap stable coins. The question to you is how do you maintain market share and how do you maintain the stickiness of the liquidity over time?
00:19:09.020 - 00:20:00.884, Speaker B: Yeah, thats a great question. The key thing to keep in mind is when you look at like exchanges, like binance for example. And ultimately a lot of blur strategy follows the binance model where you focus on the crypto natives and then you expand from there. And if you look on exchanges, it's not like the market makers on exchanges are, you know, have like liquidity mining incentives, right. They don't need any incentive beyond just making their spread from their market making. The issue with NFTs before was that the market was highly inefficient for various structural reasons. Basically like, you know, even just like a few months ago, a very effective market making strategy was just placing open bids on the order book across marketplaces.
00:20:00.884 - 00:20:39.514, Speaker B: Eventually someone needs to sell because they need liquidity fast. They sell into your lowball bid and then you can immediately flip it for a good profit. That is a strategy that indicates a highly inefficient market with blur, now that there's significantly more activity on the market making side, that's really the right way to think about it. Really. Before blur, there wasn't really market making and nfts, now with blur, there's a lot more market making. These are literally market makers from Defi, for example, mvp people market making from Defi. They're now market making on blur.
00:20:39.514 - 00:21:20.974, Speaker B: And a lot of them are actually market making profitably. You can do different strategies, you can market make profitably, you can market make at breakeven if you want. Of course, if you want to maximize rewards, then there's segmentation. But the thing that keeps people here is that there's an inefficient market, and you can market make profit profitably. So even if the liquidity mining incentives disappeared, there would still be market makers in the space because they already set up all the infrastructure, they're already participating in this ecosystem. And as long as there's inefficiencies in the market for them to profit off of, there's no reason for them to turn off their, their bot effectively.
00:21:21.794 - 00:21:55.964, Speaker A: Hey everyone, quick break from empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're onto app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks Research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:21:55.964 - 00:22:13.468, Speaker A: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just bought the platform. I can search for an L1. I can search for a protocol. Pull up the platform@blockworksresearch.com. Dot I search the term there's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform.

Now let's get back to the show. Santa, you know what this reminds me of is, do you remember we had meltem on the podcast maybe four months ago and we were talking about, she wrote this post called Pac Man. I don't know if you ever read it. In September she wrote this piece called building market microstructure for NFTs. And it was basically talking about how the whole NFT market is incredibly inefficient and it's all based around culture and collectors.
00:23:20.764 - 00:24:03.572, Speaker A: But where most markets end up going is around you end up building really efficient markets just because arbitrage ends up squeaking out a lot of the efficiency. And with that, you will get a lot more things in NFT markets, like better price discovery, better trade execution and better margin and clearing and better settlement, better post trade reconciliation. So I'm curious when you see the so this is the NFT markets today, what we're talking about, and you guys have obviously figured out how to bring better market makers to the table. What else is missing? I can imagine you guys are going to innovate a lot in the coming months. What else is missing from the space that you guys are going to bring to the table.
00:24:03.728 - 00:24:53.054, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I haven't read that post from Altam, but I would say she's spot on with how we think about the market. Ultimately, if you look at the progression of the token trading world, blur as a protocol is very similar to Uniswap in many ways. Uniswap is an exchange for ERC twenty s and Blur is an exchange for ERC seven hundred twenty one s and of course in the future, eleven fifty five s and any sort of NFT format. But ultimately these are assets that are being traded as we've seen the token infrastructure progress. You started with spot trading, of course, and then you add in options, margins, futures, derivatives, all these more advanced financialized products. That same thing will come to the NFT space.
00:24:53.054 - 00:25:34.910, Speaker B: The issue is that nfts are fundamentally different than ERC 20s. They're non fungible. So you can't just copy paste things that came and worked in the token trading world over to nfts. But the general theme of the space professionalizing is just fundamental to how markets work. They do become more efficient over time. People do want the ability to take more financialized actions with their assets and that's just a core behavior of these markets. What that actually looks like is still an area of active research because it is a different asset class.
00:25:34.910 - 00:25:40.314, Speaker B: But I think that general direction should give a sense of where we think the space is heading and what we'll be working on.
00:25:41.334 - 00:25:58.974, Speaker A: What is this? Wait, I just have. Sandy, before you jump in, I have one maybe. Weird question here, but what does this do to the cultural side of nfts? What does this do to the nfts are just things that you collect because it feels like where we're going is like nfts are just another token that you trade.
00:26:00.194 - 00:26:45.762, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ultimately, as the space grows, the culture changes. But you can't ignore the collector side of it. People have very strong attachments to their nfts. There's a community aspect, there's a social aspect, a flexing aspect that will never go away when you look at token trading. Actually it's interesting because if you look at the top coins, what is the one coin that every retail person knows about? It's dogecoin. Dogecoin is a very interesting cultural asset because the fact that it got popular is quite interesting because it's a token. You know, tokens like numbers.
00:26:45.762 - 00:27:13.614, Speaker B: Tokens are a very abstract thing. Like most people. Like I studied math in school. I enjoy it but you know, ultimately, most people do not enjoy math. They don't enjoy thinking in numbers and abstract concepts. And it's very unapproachable. But, you know, as humans, we really enjoy visual objects and collecting things, that this is a core human behavior that is just, you know, throughout history, humans have done and, you know, nfts are a new technology, but they're tapping into the same core human behaviors that have always existed.
00:27:13.614 - 00:28:14.248, Speaker B: If you look at the, even like eBay, when they ipo'd, the majority of their volume was from collectibles. So if you look at where do the demographics of tomorrow, what are they looking at Gen Z today? They're all about digital objects. They'll buy their Fortnite skins, they'll buy their Roblox skins. These digital items, this is effectively what nfts enable is this, you know, ownership of these digital, digital items. This is something that I don't think that, like, cultural aspect will, will ever change. Even if you get, you know, more financialization, even if you get more trading, you know, just like in tokens, like, you know, the core ethos of bitcoin as, you know, decentralized, you know, digital gold, right, or any of the other, you know, utilities of bitcoin that hasn't gone away, even though a lot of the space has grown beyond even that, right? Like there's a lot of market makers trading bitcoin. They don't necessarily buy into the ethos.
00:28:14.248 - 00:28:31.480, Speaker B: They don't necessarily care what the asset is. They're market making the space. There are funds that invest in bitcoin for various different reasons. There's a core ethos that started the space. The space can grow around it. And then there's multiple different cores coming in. But, you know, the core ethos of the space doesn't go away.
00:28:31.480 - 00:28:48.654, Speaker B: The kernel doesn't change anything for nfts. You're just going to see a similar thing where there's going to be market makers, there's going to be, you know, traders, people who are in it for various different reasons, but the collector mindset and the cohesion and the social aspect of it, that won't go away, but it will change.
00:28:48.994 - 00:28:58.018, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess, like the efficient markets, basically just the less efficient a market is, the more it benefits insiders.
00:28:58.106 - 00:28:58.282, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:58.298 - 00:29:11.464, Speaker A: And there's all this like grift and these like really inefficient markets like wine and art and most like even sneakers and things like that. So the more efficient you can make a market, the better it is for everybody, I think.
00:29:11.584 - 00:29:38.084, Speaker C: Yeah, but by virtue of being nfts, there will always be some inefficiency. There will always be a market maker incentivized to take advantage of that. So I guess my question, you mentioned Uniswap, Pac man. Just something that I want to focus on a bit now, they acquired Genie. And how do you think about Uniswap moving into nfts and potentially competing and bumping into what you guys are doing?
00:29:39.904 - 00:29:49.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say when we think through the competitive landscape, you know, to be candid, Uniswap is not a name that comes up a lot.
00:29:53.184 - 00:29:53.960, Speaker C: Okay.
00:29:54.112 - 00:29:55.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not really.
00:29:57.264 - 00:30:01.662, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, there's some about founders not thinking too much about the company competition.
00:30:01.718 - 00:30:01.958, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:02.006 - 00:30:03.142, Speaker C: But I am curious.
00:30:03.238 - 00:30:52.142, Speaker B: No, it's not about nothing about the competition. You know, we're obsessed with it from, from day one, our number one goal was always just being better than competition. It's just that, you know, I haven't really seen anything from that side of the market that has been particularly impressive. But I do see, like the, I mean, their strategy makes sense, right? Because, you know, uniswap as an exchange for tokens, it's not, it's not crazy to think and expand to an exchange for nfts. I do think the cultures and demographics, like Defi people and NFT people, those are very different groups. If you look at all the growth that blur has, had, has been in the wake of the FTX collapse like Celsius, all these huge providers of liquidity collapsing. Really the worst bear market that we've seen in crypto history.
00:30:52.142 - 00:31:22.634, Speaker B: And for a large part of that, NFT communities have not been affected because they're very separate from Defi. They didn't really custody their assets on FTX. They're self custodied. They don't really participate in tokens. For the most part, they're very different groups. So I actually think bridging those two products and protocols, it's kind of harder than it looks on the surface level because these are different communities and they don't necessarily go back and forth between each other.
00:31:22.794 - 00:32:08.214, Speaker C: It's like Robin Hood merging with like an e commerce and trying to like buy stocks and then jeans at the same time. I guess when you think about the response that Opensea's had, you know, there's been criticisms out there and look, obviously I'm biased, right, because, you know, the experience in you in Opensea for a while felt like they were not innovating much. And, you know, they have now responded recently since you guys launched the token, they are dropping fees for a limited time to zero. They're moving to optional creator earnings for all collections without on chain enforcement. So I'm curious, now that we're talking about competition, how do you think about Opensea and what they're doing?
00:32:10.234 - 00:33:02.504, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's interesting. A lot of their moves have confused me from a strategic perspective because they didn't make sense to me at the time. And I was wondering if there was something that I was missing, and it does not appear to be the case that there was something that I was missing. I think that ultimately, I do believe that the two segmentations that really make sense are retail and prosumer in this space, them shifting their strategy and what is ostensibly a shift in a strategy to kind of go after the pro market. It's not exactly what I would have done if I was in charge of Opensea. I'll just put it at that.
00:33:02.924 - 00:33:07.744, Speaker A: What would you do if you were in charge? Would you pick a lane and try to win the retail side of things?
00:33:08.644 - 00:33:57.944, Speaker B: Yeah, ultimately, I think that NFTs are something that's still incredibly inaccessible to newcomers. It's a very confusing space, and a lot of the people who come into NFTs, they really struggle in this space. Right. There's so many scammers, like scammers run amok in this space, and it's so difficult to protect yourself even beyond just the trading side of things. I think there's a lot of product innovation that can happen at the retail level, and I think that that is very, very durable. And with retail, of course, you get to charge higher take rates as well. So that can be a very large business even without capturing the majority of the volume.
00:33:57.944 - 00:34:30.854, Speaker B: And I won't go into specific features just because it's not my job to run opensea. It's for them to figure it out. But ultimately, I think we saw a lot of backlash when they made their moves. A lot of their recent changes. If you look at their product changes, it was like Blur was the first marketplace to prioritize the list view compared to a grid view. They copied the list view. Blur was the first marketplace to add stolen NFT protection, where there's a three hour limitation before bids can be accepted.
00:34:30.854 - 00:35:13.522, Speaker B: They added that same limitation with the exact same time restriction, the 3 hours, which was funny because it was kind of like an arbitrary amount of time that we chose. And then theyre very clear that they were just copy pasting and then even the fee structure, thats not even something that I necessarily would have done in their position, and then they copied that as well. So it was just quite surprising. Its pretty clear what their strategic goal is. You know, obviously we always have to be careful. Like, when I say this and anything I describe here, I want to be very clear. You know, I don't think you can ever stop being paranoid.
00:35:13.522 - 00:35:28.368, Speaker B: In this market, it's very important to consider all levels of competition from, you know, from every provider. So it's not to say that, you know, like we ignore them or anything like that. It's just that a lot of their moves I found quite surprising.
00:35:28.546 - 00:35:38.304, Speaker A: Do you think so they pulled fees to zero for what they said was a promotional period of time. Do you think they'll end up pulling the fees back higher or they'll keep them at zero?
00:35:39.364 - 00:36:46.752, Speaker B: I think the thing about building a protocol and launching a token is that you can't build a web two business and then tack on a token on top. Coinbase tried that and then the SEC came in and block them on that. There's a lot of regulatory restrictions and just like in terms of the team and the contributors and how they think about developing the space, there's a lot that kind of goes into it where you kind of have to start from day one in terms of whether you're building a protocol or you're building a web two business. And OpenSea has built a web two business. They're a Delaware C Corp based out of New York, have 100 employees, all in a single office in New York, and all of the equity value is tied into a single entity, and they've raised multiple rounds of fundraising. They have a board that is a very difficult situation to be in. It's, you know, we know who their board members are, we know who their lawyers are.
00:36:46.752 - 00:37:15.744, Speaker B: We know the makeup of their team. It's basically impossible to launch a token that standpoint. The funny thing was they actually, in their announcement about going to zero fees, they had these little OpenSea tokens dropping. And then everyone started speculating that OpenSea would launch a token. I thought that was the most Degen, original idea I've seen from Opensea since starting on blur. It was actually quite clever, but ultimately, it's really not something that can happen.
00:37:17.704 - 00:37:39.604, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I want to go back to this 400 days of building blur. What are some of the things that have surprised you the most, perhaps with. In the sense of things that you can control, things that you would have perhaps done differently, maybe not have done. Focus more time on. Less time on.
00:37:40.984 - 00:38:36.258, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's interesting because most initiatives. Most startups, and, you know, blur is a protocol, so it's not quite the same as, you know, just for context on my background, I started off as an engineer in Silicon Valley around eight years ago. After working there as an engineer, I started my first business, went through Y combinator in the winter 16 batch, and then I studied at MIT and then started, started the last business and then sold that and started blurb. So I've kind of come from a web two Silicon Valley startup background, and what's interesting is the typical advice in startups is that you need to pivot fairly often, right? Like, you never know what's going to work. You have to like change strategies a lot. You have to be very dynamic. Blur is quite a different initiative from day one.
00:38:36.258 - 00:39:28.888, Speaker B: The goal was always to build a pro trading experience for nfts, utilize an airdrop campaign for user acquisition, and build the largest exchange by volume for nfts in the space. And basically we've not deviated from that vision in these past 400 days and effectively nothing has really changed. I think the thing that's really most surprised us is the response from existing players in the space. When we evaluated the space 400 days ago, it was very clear there was such a large gap in the market. It was interesting because a lot of the players were actually antagonistic to the traders in the space. But the business model of everyone in the space was to monetize off of the traders. You take a take rate, either open cp or a royalty.
00:39:28.888 - 00:40:22.754, Speaker B: Everyone was monetizing off of the traders, but there was this, and the traders were the source of the majority of the volume, but they were very antagonistic towards the traders. So it was quite surprising. It's like, how can you hate the cohort of people that actually pay you at the end of the day? So I think just the lack of response was very surprising to us. We've only been incredibly grateful because we started so late in the market and we had to build from the ground up to build this real time trading system, to build the protocol, to build up the community. Now we've gained so much momentum that we have the vast majority of volume in the space by a large margin. And I think that's really the thing that surprised me the most, is the lack of efficiency in the market. On the infrastructure side, definitely.
00:40:23.134 - 00:41:02.374, Speaker C: Speaking of rewarding traders, you obviously launch multiple campaigns of airdrops, rewards, and then this latest airdrop, I believe it was, you airdropped over 33,000 unique wallets. Airdrops have been, they're one of those topics that are fairly contentious, some people love them, believe that they're really efficient customer acquisition vehicle strategies. Others that say it's really expensive way to acquire users, most people just claim and dump. Talk to us a little bit about the strategy, what you're seeing in terms of user behavior of the multiple airdrop campaigns.
00:41:02.674 - 00:41:43.414, Speaker B: Yeah, the key thing that we wanted to do was airdrops are a great way of getting people into the funnel. But if you don't have a product or protocol that retains the user, then you just have a bucket with a gaping hole in the bottom. It doesn't really matter how much water you throw into it. It's just all going to go away. We saw that with some of the prior marketplaces, like looks for NXuI two. They launched with these large airdrop campaigns, but their retention was atrocious. And what that did was it brought a lot of people into the door, but it wasted a lot of that attention.
00:41:43.414 - 00:42:32.754, Speaker B: For us, it was very clear that we could only launch once. We were very confident in the product and the protocol. And then the other key thing is that we think about an airdrop from a capital allocation perspective. It was always surprising to us that a lot of protocols would do these secret airdrops where they would airdrop users retroactively. That's strange, because, you know, you want to use capital to acquire new users. Using capital to reward existing users is kind of an inefficient use of capital. If you think about like a protocol, like a business, you know, you want, you want a business to allocate capital efficiently and effectively.
00:42:32.754 - 00:43:34.238, Speaker B: You don't want it to just, you know, really throw money down the drain. And I think while some protocols have done retroactive airdrops that have made users really happy, you know, it's ultimately an inefficient use of capital. So for us in our airdrop, we wanted to make it really clear that the airdrop would go to the users that made blur successful. So that's to the users that use the protocol that provided liquidity. And those are the ones that would actually get the vast, that got the vast majority of the rewards. When we were going to launch in the airdrop, a lot of people would ask me, oh, how do you incentivize recipients to hold the token? Are you going to add staking or something like that? And it was very interesting hearing that, because if you think about the holder base, you don't want forced holders, you want a long term oriented holder base. If you look at every airdrop in history, every airdrop basically gets immediately sold by the recipients.
00:43:34.238 - 00:44:10.784, Speaker B: Like, even Uniswap, where everyone would have benefited from holding, the majority of recipients sold it within the first 30 days, and then the token price shot up afterwards. If you zoom out a bit and look at airdrops in history, even outside of crypto, when the Soviet Union collapsed, they gave away land rights to all the people, basically like an airdrop of land to all the people. And the oligarchs went around buying up the land for pennies on the dollar from all the peasants and everyone. And ultimately, there's a core human behavior here where people will sell the free money that they receive. That is. Oh, go ahead.
00:44:10.904 - 00:44:12.964, Speaker C: Sounds like you've read red notice.
00:44:13.624 - 00:44:38.254, Speaker B: No, you know, actually, I sounded to read lists, but I need to read that. Yeah, but, you know, this is. It's. It's funny because people would ask, like, oh, how do you prevent that? And it's like, you don't want to prevent. You never want to fight human behavior. It's like, you know, you can't build a plane by flapping your wings. You can only build a plane by understanding aerodynamics and, you know, the laws of nature and working around that.
00:44:38.254 - 00:45:05.608, Speaker B: So when we thought through the airdrop, we shared this very publicly, we shared that this is a core human behavior. People are going to sell. They'll sell at a discount, most likely, and then that allows for the paper hands to get washed out, and then the longer term holders to come in. And then we saw exactly that behavior happen, where the tokens were sold. I think the lowest price was at, you know, 40, $0.40 or, like, $0.30 or something like that.
00:45:05.608 - 00:45:28.204, Speaker B: And then within a few days, the token is now trading at over a dollar. It was very clear that that would happen, and we shared that publicly that that was most likely going to happen. And then it did happen. It was just very interesting to see that, like, the. That just, like, core aspect of how humans work wasn't really fully recognized. But, yeah, that's really how we thought about the airdrop.
00:45:28.854 - 00:45:47.234, Speaker A: How do you guys think internally about, like, I'm almost curious about, like, on the p and L. Is this a marketing expense? Like, how do you. Is, like, how do you treat this airdrop internally? Like, was this a marketing expense? Like, how did you decide if you should do, like, 2% of supply or 10%? Like, what. What was the thinking that went into this?
00:45:47.574 - 00:46:29.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, you know, when we looked at the NFT space, so if you look at, like, opensea, right. It's it was very interesting because NFTs are a web3 native asset. If you look at tokens, tokens have Dexs, they have all this decentralized infrastructure to support token trading. But NFTs were all trading on a web two platform. And the web two platform wasn't only oriented as a web two platform, but it also was financed like a web two platform. They had a capital base, they had equity holders. The majority of the value of the business was held by the executive team and like a 16 z and a few of the VC's.
00:46:29.310 - 00:47:29.786, Speaker B: And it was very surprising to us that this was the case because this is, you know, we're in the web3 space. There's a huge unlock that's possible where you can actually protocolize the infrastructure and give away the tokens that control that protocol to the community. So when we thought about this, we were like, okay, so opensea, the bull, they raised at like 13 billion valuation, peak trading. I think the peak secondary is that like 18 billion. Of course now in the bear market and especially after blur that the equity value has gone down significantly. But ultimately when we saw that, we're like, oh wow, here is a space where if we protocolize the space and give away the tokens to the community, we can literally give away billions of dollars worth of value to the community. And when we think about as a community member, what would I prefer? Well, I want to use a protocol that gives me billions of dollars worth of value.
00:47:29.786 - 00:47:47.138, Speaker B: I don't want to use the marketplace that's run in a web two fashion where I don't have any control over the protocol, I don't have any upside in the protocol's growth. And ultimately it was really about giving that value to the community because that's going to win over the users at the end of the day.
00:47:47.306 - 00:48:06.934, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned Opensea is a web two company, they have a board, Delaware C Corp. Raised a bunch of money, 100 employees in New York. So therefore they can't do a token. How do you think about how did you weigh the regulatory risks of having a token versus the pros of doing it?
00:48:07.634 - 00:49:05.758, Speaker B: Yeah, ultimately navigating regulations and staying compliant with the law is something that's very important for every team in the space to think through. We were very fortunate because of course working with paradigm and their counsel, they have some of the best lawyers in the space on this problem. And we effectively were able to work with them from day one to structure and develop the protocol in such a way where we felt very comfortable about being able to launch a token and progressively decentralize from there. So it's something that's very hard to do after the fact. So it's very hard to start a business and then afterwards be like, we're going to protocolize and launch a token. It doesn't really work that way. You really need to think through it from day one and if you think through it from day one, you can do it, but if you don't, it's basically impossible.
00:49:05.886 - 00:49:10.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think Opensea will end up launching a token or no?
00:49:12.014 - 00:49:14.878, Speaker B: I think they'll tease it, but ultimately, no.
00:49:15.006 - 00:49:49.022, Speaker A: Yeah, this might be my last question here. And then I know Santi wants to do a little rapid fire for you is just on this topic of creator royalties. If I was advising OpenSea, one thing, I don't know anything really about this internal strategy of Opensea, but as an outsider looking in, one of their problems seems to be, I can't tell who they're optimizing for. Like, I can't tell who they want to build a product for. Whereas with Blur, I'm like, oh, they're building for traders. They're really building for NFT traders. This topic of creator royalties is something that I feel like a lot of folks are really torn on.
00:49:49.022 - 00:50:02.712, Speaker A: It's very contentious. And Opensea, they took it down and then they were like, but we still love the creators and it should be enforced, but we can't enforce it and that kind of stuff. How do you think about this creator royalties debate that's going on right now?
00:50:02.848 - 00:51:10.168, Speaker B: Yeah. What's interesting was one of the moves that OpenSea made when we first launched, because basically we launched and then a few hot collections launched and blur was winning the volume on all of them and surpassing Opensea's volume. And then they basically came out with this new policy where you had to fill block marketplaces at the NFT level in order to get full royalties on Opensea. And it was very clear to us that that was a business level decision, but it was framed as a pro creator decision and it kind of, like, spread in the market as that. And it was quite frustrating because ultimately, when we thought through our policies, we were thinking from the standpoint of what can we do to protect and maximize greater royalties as the meta is shifting. So prior to blur launching, Sudo had launched, which had no royalties at all and was gaining share. And then Gem, which was owned by Opensea, actually integrated Sudo.
00:51:10.168 - 00:52:13.322, Speaker B: That was a very surprising move to us because that was basically cannibalizing their own business and we were very shocked about that because it was also very clear it would put pressure on the other marketplaces to change their royalty stance. And then a few days later, x two, y two switched to optional royalties and directly cited gem doing it as the reason for Y. And then those marketplaces were basically gaining share. And then when we launched, we basically launched with this incentivized royalty program to try to shift at least some of the enforcement over and get traders who pay some royalties as opposed to paying no royalties. But ultimately, when we, when we think through the market, it's very clear that there is segmentation in the market, right? So there's like retail, there's collectors. Retails are price insensitive either because they are pro royalty or just because they don't know better, right? It's like when you're on Coinbase and you buy on Coinbase consumer, and there's like a fat fee, but if you go to like Coinbase Pro, suddenly you get like, you know, 75% less fees. And the only difference is just changing the URL.
00:52:13.322 - 00:52:39.202, Speaker B: So retail is of course going to tolerate higher fees. Collectors, they want to pay the royalties because they really support the creators. And then traders, they're very price sensitive. They will optimize their price. So there's very clear segmentation and the market is going to do what the market is going to do. The market will move towards efficiency, especially be propelled by the traders. And it's quite difficult.
00:52:39.202 - 00:53:13.964, Speaker B: Any structure where you're fighting the market forces is ultimately an unstable structure. So for us, you know, we were trying to figure out what is the end state here that's actually stable. And that's what we were trying to move things towards. When Opensea came out with the filter policy, we actually adopted it within a week. We would have adopted it sooner, but FTX collapsed that week. So we're like, you know, we're not going to announce this adoption policy, you know, this week, but we adopted it within a week because we were like, you know what, at the very least, this isn't sustainable. There's no on chain royalty enforcement that that can't be circumvented.
00:53:13.964 - 00:54:10.254, Speaker B: You can always circumvent any sort of like, filter system. Like, you know, people try this in defi, right? People tried so many of these policies where you get, you know, royalties on trades or you can, you know, restrict the minimum price of the asset and ultimately every sort of restriction, like market restriction can be worked around. So it's very clear that there, there really isn't a way to do this in an on chain way, but we adopted it because we felt like it was a temporary solution that could maintain at least some temporary stability that would eventually go away. And I think what we've seen now is that the market forces were too strong and now opensea kind of acquiesce and they changed their policy too, as well. I don't think that where we are today is the end state of royalties. I think that there's segmentation that can be done. I think that there's more clever ways of, of doing it where everyone is happy.
00:54:10.254 - 00:54:19.634, Speaker B: But ultimately, I haven't seen as much of a willingness in the market to experiment. But I think right now we're very clearly in a period of experimentation.
00:54:19.754 - 00:54:41.504, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you guys end up layering on more like financialization of NFT type things as the market develops, like lending and borrowing your nfts or better margin abilities. That was a very hot lead. Debated thing at the, at the end of the last cycle is like, should you be able to basically borrow off of your nfts? I'm curious how you, how you guys approach that.
00:54:41.844 - 00:55:28.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the financialization, ultimately, the professionalization, the space is, you know, blur, the community of Blur is, is very prosumer and the future products that the community will introduce will very much lean into that. I will say that, you know, when we looked at the space, we haven't seen anything that currently exists in the market that felt like it really nailed it. We haven't been particularly excited by any of the existing primitives in the market. There are a few that I think are directionally correct, but nfts are. A lot of the protocols, actually, funnily enough, just copied pasted Defi protocols and made it work for Erz. Seven hundred twenty one s. And it's just like, this is, this is fundamentally different asset class.
00:55:28.398 - 00:55:46.222, Speaker B: That's why none of the sexes, right, like every sex, launched an NFT marketplace. None of them took off because this is a different space, this is a different culture. You can't just copy paste. And we've seen a lot of copy pasting. You know, I do. I do think that there will be something here. And of course, this is something that, you know, we're fortunate enough to work with.
00:55:46.222 - 00:55:50.158, Speaker B: Paradigm, actively researching, but that's all I can share about that right now.
00:55:50.286 - 00:55:57.502, Speaker A: Yeah. Santi, my good friend, I know you are itching to do these rapid fires, so you want to fire it off.
00:55:57.638 - 00:56:11.314, Speaker C: Before we do this, Pac Man, I want to just open forum. Is there anything that we haven't touched on during this last hour that you want to touch on, want to discuss before we move on to this last segment?
00:56:11.774 - 00:57:14.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think something that I haven't seen the market internalize yet is a lot of people see Blur as the pro trader Opensea, in the same way that they see Opensea as a web two business. They see blur as this. But ultimately, this is a fundamental new primitive. The blur token holders, they control the key economics of the protocol. They have the power to accrue value and to distribute value and allocate capital. This is something that I think hasn't been internalized by the market yet, because when we think through the optimal model here, I really like Makerdao, where they have these subdaos that they're spinning up and people are able to contribute from all over the community. Something that is possible now is that the community members, and that's traders, that's collectors, that's also creators, they can actually actively vote and participate in the development of the protocol and influence over the protocol.
00:57:14.054 - 00:57:57.422, Speaker B: That is something that I don't think has really been internalized. And the other thing that I don't think has fully been internalized is that now that blur controls the vast majority of volume in the market, there's a huge unlock that is possible that wasn't possible before, which is if you were in the crypto space, but you wanted exposure to nfts, because nfts today have grown through the bear market. But we're still very much in the bear market. When you look at how crypto operates as a whole, it's. It operates in bull and bear markets. And typically, each bull market is a multitude larger than the prior bull market. Right now, we're still about, you know, like one 8th of the prior bull market.
00:57:57.422 - 00:58:38.784, Speaker B: So the growth of the NFT space from here is very clear. When you think about the players that want access and exposure to that growth, you know, prior to blur, there wasn't really way, wasn't really a way to get exposure. Like, you can't really sweep $100 million of nfts because that's. It's just too illiquid for that. But now that there's a protocol where the majority of the activity in the space happens, the blur token effectively becomes index exposure to the NFT space. And not, not just nfts broadly, but also the fastest growing segment of the NFT space, which is a pro trader. So I think that index exposure is also something that I haven't really seen fully internalized yet, but that's effectively what has been unlocked via the blur token.
00:58:41.084 - 00:58:42.024, Speaker A: Very well.
00:58:43.124 - 00:59:01.054, Speaker C: Just a reminder, folks, none of this is legal financial advice, but, yeah, I definitely appreciate those insights, Pac man. Okay, so just a quick rapid fire before we wrap it up. So let's start with what's your favorite collection?
00:59:02.274 - 00:59:16.170, Speaker B: You know, for me, it's gonna be sentimental. The blit maps were my first collection that I ever minted, is what got me into nfts. If I didn't mint the blip map, I probably wouldn't have really fallen in love with nfts. So that's gonna be my personal favorite.
00:59:16.282 - 00:59:20.654, Speaker C: We all have to thank blitmap for that. What's been your best trade?
00:59:21.634 - 00:59:34.086, Speaker B: Best trade was definitely the blip map as well. I minted it and then sold it at the 8th. And if you remember, the 8th was like around like 30 ETH ish. So incredible roi on that one, for sure. Yeah.
00:59:34.190 - 00:59:35.154, Speaker C: Worst trade.
00:59:35.894 - 00:59:49.398, Speaker B: Worst trade. Probably like the one of the art collections, like mutant garden cedars, I think was one of them where I could have bought a car with it but wrote it down to zero.
00:59:49.566 - 01:00:10.718, Speaker C: We also know that you like cars, by the way. Funny story. The entire blur team is incredibly hard working. I remember trying to convince Pacman to come out one night and he was working till very late and managing multiple time zones. So. Yeah. Second and last question.
01:00:10.718 - 01:00:15.154, Speaker C: What is the most underrated artist project out there?
01:00:16.174 - 01:00:57.386, Speaker B: Underrated? You know, that's something that I think some collectors will be able to tell you a lot more about. The creators that I see. Typically something that's interesting is I think that the talent typically bubbles up in the space in the market, largely. I used to think that the market was very inefficient, but I think that in tech and crypto, I've actually seen the highly talented people. They might be ignored for a little bit, but eventually they get discovered. So I think everyone eventually becomes known if they continued consistently producing good work. It's like you were saying with your thesis at the beginning, you like to invest in repeat founders.
01:00:57.386 - 01:01:06.226, Speaker B: And ultimately, I think the people that prevail, the market kind of recognizes them. So that's one of the really kind things about this market, is that those players do get recognized eventually.
01:01:06.290 - 01:01:16.374, Speaker C: That's the beauty and power of open source, especially last one, which I'm sure everyone's dying to know. Can you tell us why the name Pac man?
01:01:17.434 - 01:01:42.828, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So if you go on blur, you'll notice it's a very retro arcade theme aesthetic. And we chose that because ultimately, nfts, we're building very serious infrastructure. But we're here because it's a very fun space. People love collecting nfts. They love the environment. There's a lot of drama, honestly, that kind of brings people into it even more.
01:01:42.828 - 01:02:08.444, Speaker B: It's just like a lot of fun for a lot of people. And we see people who are like children, 18 years old, in this space, and then we see people who are 50 years old, executives at large companies, and they're all in the same space. This is a really magical thing, so we wanted to have fun with it. And when we think about a retro arcade theme, of course, Pac man is one of the OG games. That was really, ultimately the thought that went into it. Awesome.
01:02:08.954 - 01:02:23.554, Speaker C: Well, it's been a treat having you on the pod, especially as I'm sure you and the rest of the Blur team are incredibly busy. So really appreciate you coming on and sharing some insights and really excited to have this go live later this week.
01:02:23.714 - 01:02:37.182, Speaker A: Yeah, Pac man. Appreciate it. I would also recommend folks go to go play with Blur. I think that's the best way to learn about it is great insights on the pod, but I think it's blur. IO is the URL. And, yeah, I would recommend folks go play around.
01:02:37.358 - 01:02:59.870, Speaker B: Yeah. And, you know, just have to share. Season one was this initial airdrop that everyone probably saw, you know, on Twitter. But season two is currently active and similarly sized to season one. So everyone who's active, you know, the goal is really to be able to give away the billions of value to the community that makes blur what it is. So that's something that we'll continue to push more.
01:02:59.902 - 01:03:04.656, Speaker A: Good, Alpha. All right, well, Pacman, we appreciate it, man. And, yeah, congrats on everything.
01:03:04.840 - 01:03:05.896, Speaker B: Thank you, sir.
01:03:06.080 - 01:03:07.376, Speaker C: Thanks for coming on, Pac man.
01:03:07.440 - 01:03:07.744, Speaker B: Take care.
