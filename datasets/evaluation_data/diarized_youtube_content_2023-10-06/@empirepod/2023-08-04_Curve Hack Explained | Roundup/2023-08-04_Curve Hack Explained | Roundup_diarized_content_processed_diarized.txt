00:00:02.840 - 00:00:18.014, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. You have Ren and Andrew Thurmond, who recently joined blockworks as our lead data reporter, building out the data reporting side of the business. So, Andrew, pumped to have you not only on the podcast, but at blockworks, man.
00:00:18.174 - 00:00:19.454, Speaker B: Yeah, no, good to be here.
00:00:19.534 - 00:00:22.022, Speaker A: Yeah, pumped to have you here. And Ren, welcome back to the show, man.
00:00:22.158 - 00:00:23.822, Speaker C: Thank you. Excited to be back.
00:00:23.998 - 00:00:57.436, Speaker A: All right, guys, biggest news of the week by far was curve. Curve got hacked this week. A couple of big pools impacted had a lot of second order impacts, both on the founders positions, which have started to get hunted, as well as just on the rest of Defi. I would say there's other things happening in the industry right now too, but the curve hack was far and away the most important thing. And it's almost unfair of me to call it the curve hack because it really wasn't almost on curve, actually, it was on Viper. But maybe we can actually start really high level for folks who don't know what curve is. I know this might have.
00:00:57.436 - 00:01:08.012, Speaker A: The audience is going to be frustrated that we're digging into curve like, what is curve here, but ren, maybe you can kick it off with just quick refresher on what is curve and why is it so important to defi?
00:01:08.148 - 00:01:48.118, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So curve is a Dex. It's one of the largest dexs in the DeFi ecosystem. Along with uniswap, it lives primarily on Ethereum mainnet. It was one of the first pioneers of Ve tokenomics, where someone could lock up the native token and then they could basically use their voting power to direct emissions towards their liquidity pools, for their tokens or their products. Basically that solved a few problems for Defi. Rather than emitting your own native token and diluting your own token holders, you're able to use curve emissions because, for example, curve has a much larger market cap emissions there are a lot more effective.
00:01:48.118 - 00:02:24.326, Speaker C: And there was sort of like a whole ecosystem build out around curve. You know, you have curve convex urine staked out. There was this thing that was known as the curve wars, because as we all know, liquidity is so important. And whoever had the largest treasury or war chest of curves tokens were able to direct the most emissions to the liquidity pools. And wherever had the most liquidity in their liquidity pools, more often than not had the best product to offer to users. So curve, by far and large, has been a staple within the DeFi ecosystem for a good two, three years now. To be honest, a lot of protocols use them for admissions.
00:02:24.326 - 00:02:38.834, Speaker C: A lot of protocols are deeply interconnected into their ecosystem, and I think a lot of people consider it to be one of the Defi blue chips, along with the likes of Unisoft, Synthetix or DeFi 1.0, whatever term you want to use.
00:02:39.314 - 00:02:41.914, Speaker A: Anything that Ren missed there, I just.
00:02:41.954 - 00:03:23.544, Speaker B: Add that was a very good intro. They sort of have their niche with stable swaps in particular. They're an ideal venue and arguably the most important source of liquidity for swapping your stables, like your USDC for your USDT. This is also, this is the developer's protocol too. Michael Igorov, the founder, when I talk to actual geniuses, he's the guy they all say, oh, he's the genius. And also this is technology that's been adopted by state level actors. There's a couple CBDC proposals that are going to use forked or modified versions of curve.
00:03:23.544 - 00:03:38.400, Speaker B: So this is in addition to being, I think, the second largest Dex systemically important for very particular types of swaps. This was a really good team. This wasn't just some forked crappy project that got hacked here.
00:03:38.512 - 00:03:55.604, Speaker A: Yeah. So for folks who haven't used curve but might be familiar with Uniswap, if you go to uniswap to trade the long tail of tokens, you're going to curve to swap stables. And that's why it's really important to DeFi. Andrew, can you maybe walk us through what happened earlier this week? What happened here? Start at the beginning.
00:03:56.024 - 00:05:12.724, Speaker B: Sure was. Throughout the day on Sunday, starting at around 08:00 a.m. It was discovered that there was a flaw with a Viper compiler for a select number of curve pools that use this compiler, this version of the compiler. What this means in practicality is that a particular curve pool jpegs NfT lending profile a peth ETH pool where you could swap this NFT loan backed derivative for ether that was exploited for about 11 million in pet and ETH. Initially, funnily enough, innocence deleted tweet curves seemed to imply that this was a flaw with the JPEG protocol, and a few minutes later it came out that it was actually these curve certain select curve pools that were at risk. What happened throughout the rest of the day was a foot race, I think is the best way to call it. There were black hat hackers, what appears to be multiple different ones, usually in an exploit, there's just one guy who found a flaw and went after it.
00:05:12.724 - 00:06:38.204, Speaker B: But as the knowledge about this particular exploit and attack vector spread, multiple people decided to sort of try out stealing some money from these curve pools simultaneously to all of these black hat hackers figuring out that there was this exploit underway, and one that was possible. White hack teams, various war rooms from around the community, they were attempting to execute these sort of bailout transactions. They would drain these vulnerable pools before the black hats could, thus saving the user funds. And finally, there was a very, very interesting third party who was involved in the race, which was a couple of generalized frontrunners, which are a type of mev searcher that sees profitable transactions and steps in to execute them themselves. And there's pretty good evidence that somebody might have saved a great deal of funds, a huge amount of Ethereum, while they were sleeping, because their bot just executed these transactions for them. But we can talk about that a little bit more later. But throughout the day Sunday, I think it was a total of four affected pools and eight different transactions, some of them white hat, some of them black hat, ultimately drained about 70 million in funds from these pools.
00:06:38.204 - 00:06:47.300, Speaker B: 50 million of which we now believe roughly 50 million was black hat exploiters who managed to get away with the money.
00:06:47.452 - 00:06:52.304, Speaker A: Great summary. What kind of attack was this? How did this actually happen?
00:06:53.804 - 00:07:46.260, Speaker C: I can touch on this. So basically what happened is a reenginecy attack. Reagency attack is when a function makes an external call to another untrusted function. Then this untrusted function, or contract, basically makes a recursive call back to the original function in an attempt to drain funds. Where things kind of go wrong during a reenginecy attack is when the original contract fails to update its state before sending funds. So in layman's terms, I'm able to withdraw, say, one ETH that I deposited, but the contract does not update my balance to minus one ETH, and I'm able to just continuously call that withdrawal function again and again until I withdraw that entire pool. Specifically for this curve exploit, what happened was the code itself was fine.
00:07:46.260 - 00:08:34.875, Speaker C: It was written in Viper. Viper is like a python like programming language for EVM chains, but the compiler basically has a compiler code, and within that there was something that caused the reaction guard to fail. So it's kind of interesting. I don't have a technical background, but the code you write is fine, but basically when you make it production grade, compile it into a smart contract, then things go out of whack. And so actually this bug has been around for quite some time. This bug was first discovered in, or was first pushed to, Viper in July 2021. It was subsequently fixed in August 2021 in another update to Viper, but because Curve did not upgrade their smart contracts they compounded once in 2021, and it's been that same smart contract ever since.
00:08:34.875 - 00:08:40.423, Speaker C: There's been that potential exploit vector there for a good two years now, to be honest.
00:08:41.243 - 00:09:05.104, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of wild to see this reentrancy attack, because I think this was the same attack that was used in the DaO hack back in 20, whenever that was. 2016, I think like the original DAO that ended up forking Ethereum and into Ethereum classic as well. So it's kind of crazy to see this. So what were the pools that were impacted here? Ren or Andrew? Whoever wants to take that?
00:09:05.604 - 00:09:41.822, Speaker B: Sure, I can discuss that one. So it was a lot of ether and ether derivative pools, and then one structurally important curve Crv, the governance token for the curve protocol ether pool. So there's the jpegged Peth ETH pool, the metronome mseth pool, the alchemyx pool, arguably the hardest hit al ETH and ether, and then curve ether. So the only pool that wasn't for swapping between ether and what was supposed to be a like, asset.
00:09:41.998 - 00:09:51.342, Speaker A: Why is the. I would say one of those pools is more important than the other crve? Let's dig into that a little bit more. So why is that such an important pool?
00:09:51.518 - 00:10:40.972, Speaker C: So this is going to be a whole discussion later, but basically, curve with that pool on curve is the main on chain liquidity source for curve, the token, which means anyone wanting to swap in and out of curve and ETH has to be routed through that pool if you want, like any semblance of liquidity. If I'm not wrong, I think around like 20 million strain from that pool. So in and of itself, like, sure it doesn't really that much, but there's a few important factors here. First is that if all of the curve and Eve is drained out of that pool, the curve token price goes down by a lot, at least on chain. Maybe it doesn't go down that much on centralized exchanges, but if I'm not wrong, on that Sunday the curve price for that pool reached something like $0.15, while the price was still like 60 or $0.55 on a centralized exchange.
00:10:40.972 - 00:11:24.864, Speaker C: And so a lot of protocols that depend on it for emissions, like your emissions basically de facto just went down by like 75% from dollar value perspective. And also with those admissions, whoever receives those admissions can like sell those admissions for actual, like us dollars or like WiF. The second and more important thing is that there is a lot of curve that's collateral lending protocols by curve's founder, Michael Agaroff. And basically, if you want to liquidate that, you have to go through that liquidity pool on chain, at least. And if that liquidity doesn't exist anymore, then you can't really liquidate someone's loan. And when you can't liquidate someone's loan, as their collateral value goes down, then you kind of get, like, a big financial crisis.
00:11:26.204 - 00:12:13.838, Speaker A: So here's my understanding of how this went down, and I'm going to try to try to draw an analogy to non crypto land to almost. To try to make this more understandable, basically. So the curve ETH pool or weth pool. My understanding of how this happened is there were two different attacks. One of them was the first one, I think, was the exploiter, opened a 10,000 with flash loan from balancer, unwrapped it to ETH. They then provided 400 ETH as liquidity to the curve to the CRV. ETH pool received, like, roughly 10,000 CRve LP tokens, swapped 500 ETH for, like, a million CRV, withdrew that CRV and ETH from the pool, burned some of the tokens, withdrew the CRV, burn more tokens, swapped CRV for Ethan, and then repeated the process until, basically, the CRV had been drained from the pool.
00:12:13.838 - 00:12:48.728, Speaker A: My almost, like, dumbed down version of, like, this in non crypto terms, and, like, what a reentrancy attack is. I'm going to try this, and you guys tell me if I'm wrong here, but imagine you have a bank, right? And you have a customer, let's call him Bob, walks up to the bank teller, asked to withdraw the money. So the bank teller first hands out the money and then records the withdrawal on the bank's ledger, which reduces Bob's balance. But then suppose that there's this, like, mischievous person that also walks in the bank. Let's call them Sally, right? And Sally wants to try to exploit this system. So Sally walks up to the teller, requests a withdrawal. Teller hands over the money.
00:12:48.728 - 00:13:21.816, Speaker A: But before the teller can record the withdrawal, Sally interrupts, like, distracts them, asks a question or comments or something, and the teller, you know, starts talking to Sally, forgets to record the withdrawal. So while the teller's distracted, Sally then asks for another withdrawal. The teller forgets. Kind of, like, almost doesn't realize what happens. Forgets what happens because the first draw hasn't been recorded in the ledger. Hands over more money to Sally, and the process repeats, allowing Sally to withdraw far more money than she actually has in her account. And here, the bank would be the smart contract.
00:13:21.816 - 00:13:37.374, Speaker A: Sally is the malicious attacker, and the teller's process of giving out the money before recording the transaction is kind of like the vulnerable contract code, which sends funds before updating its state. Fair analogy. Not a fair analogy. Andrew, what do you think?
00:13:37.834 - 00:14:11.182, Speaker B: I'm trying to look it up. It's this classic old timey movie, but I think that's a good breakdown. Maybe a simpler one would be it's this scam artist who ends up adopting a little girl, and he teaches her how to do this funny trick that you can do with certain people when they're giving you change, where you just keep swapping money back and forth and they get confused and end up giving you way too much. I think that it's hard to analogize because it's so complex, but no, that's a good swing. What do you think, Ryan?
00:14:11.358 - 00:14:13.918, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a pretty good explanation, too.
00:14:14.086 - 00:14:38.514, Speaker A: I mean, I think in crypto terms, too. It's like, I read this summary somewhere and I wrote it down, but I forget where I pulled this from. So sorry for not citing it, but the. I'll just read it. The reentrancy occurred between the remove liquidity and add liquidity actions. A pool depositor should ordinarily be entitled to pool tokens equal to the product of the total pool token supply and the fraction of the depositor supplied liquidity. Liquidity.
00:14:38.514 - 00:15:07.006, Speaker A: However, due to the re entrance debug, the allotted pool tokens were calculated with the pre burn balances, which then allows the exploit to kind of infinite mint pool tokens to create this fraudulent claim on the entire contents of the pool. So, Andrew, any other thoughts on, like, Ren? I know Ren just commented this, but any other thoughts on, like, why the CRV ETH pool is so important? Or just, like, how this happened? Or details on this?
00:15:07.190 - 00:15:55.334, Speaker B: Yeah, Crve doesn't have a ton of on chain liquidity, and that curve ETH pool was arguably the largest. 110 million, 12 million or so of ether. And so if these loan positions, which we'll talk about in a little bit, ever did get liquidated, that was really where a lot of people expected to be able to do it and do it safely. And so suddenly, these Defi protocols, which had already started making noise about curve founder Michael Igorov's positions. There was some talk in the Aave governance forums, even just a few months ago, discussing how they might pose a little bit of risk. They had simply gotten too large, and the collateral backing didn't have enough liquidity. If there ever had to be a liquidation.
00:15:55.334 - 00:16:01.106, Speaker B: It all looked much, much worse after that curve ETH pool went down.
00:16:01.210 - 00:16:09.544, Speaker A: Yeah. Why is this? All right, so this wasn't actually curve that got hacked, it was a bug in viper. Is that a fair thing to say?
00:16:10.244 - 00:16:21.544, Speaker C: I think curve was still the end target of what got hacked, but Viper was sort of like the means of how they got attacked. I think that's how I would put it.
00:16:22.084 - 00:16:58.186, Speaker B: I think that, like, language diversity in Ethereum is a good thing. We shouldn't write everything in solidity. And Viper is this sort of famously underfunded project that a lot of really crunchy developers like to use. And so it's a little heartbreaking that they've sort of become the scapegoat for this. And it's also worth noting that curve is a really important patron of the language. They funded it with some Gitcoin grants and payments out of governance. And I believe I saw somebody on Twitter.
00:16:58.186 - 00:17:51.374, Speaker B: I didn't verify this myself, but the person who approved the. The commit, the push that the reentrancy attack actually used was in fact a curve developer. They are maintainers of the language, and so it's really tough to say it's one team and not another team, and I understand the instinct to do that, but these things are structures that are built on top of each other. You just assume that somebody smarter than you has done the legwork to make sure that everything is good with the compiler. And who is really at fault at the end of the day is, I think, a much more complicated question. But ultimately, do you call it a flaw in curve, or do you call it a flaw and fiber?
00:17:52.674 - 00:18:17.926, Speaker A: I guess the important question is not the semantics. The important question is, if this was an issue with curve, then the. The problem, you could. You would think that the problem is siloed to curve. But if this is a problem with Viper, which is what a lot of folks use, then my immediate. I know everyone's focus is on Michael's CRV position and the potential CRV, you know, his potential liquidations. But I feel like that is the wrong place to focus.
00:18:17.926 - 00:18:38.154, Speaker A: I feel like the real focus is on, like, you know, if everyone. I'm sure the bug has already been fixed in Viper. I'm sure that's, like, not a big deal, but if everyone's using the same smart contracting language here and compiler with Viper and stuff like that, then. I don't know, my thought goes to other protocols. Is this a concern of you guys or. Not really?
00:18:38.854 - 00:19:30.076, Speaker C: I definitely think so. I think it's more of a Viper problem, but I want to go one step further. Actually, after this exploit happened, people started pointing out that, okay, we all know solidity is probably the most used smart contract programming language, the EVM ecosystem. And solidity also has the ability for devs to sort of like auto do these optimizations when they're compiling their code. And actually in a recent child of its audit report for like a new lending protocol called Ajna Finance, the audit report basically told us that there has been several optimization bugs with solidity's optional compiler optimization. And you know, if you're a dev, chances are this is a box you check because you want to like optimize your smart contract. You trust solidity.
00:19:30.076 - 00:20:14.408, Speaker C: But over the years, starting all the way from late 2018, there's been like a significant number of high severity bugs in that solidity compiler. So for all we know, there's like one super big bug in the solidity optimizer during compound that a lot of smart contracts are vulnerable to. It's just, you know, like sometimes it's a bit of luck and no one knows what's out there. And I think that's also a problem with crypto. Right? Like it's really, really, really hard to write perfect code, like even Apple or like the best big tech companies in the world with the most developed like software engineering environments. You see like a zero day exploit pop up like every other month, to be honest. And sure they patch it pretty soon.
00:20:14.408 - 00:20:25.354, Speaker C: But still, the fact that zero day exploit can exist for Apple, it's pretty scary. And I think the same probably is the case for any smart contract programming language.
00:20:26.694 - 00:20:59.128, Speaker A: Hey everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best Defi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:20:59.128 - 00:21:29.252, Speaker A: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right, Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off. If you go to blockworks.com, permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket.
00:21:29.252 - 00:21:47.996, Speaker A: Today, when I'm recording this, that's about dollar 300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30 when buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up, let me know. Shoot me a dm on Twitter.
00:21:47.996 - 00:22:02.972, Speaker A: I would love to meet up with you there. Yeah, this just spooked me because the curve team is, I think Andrew was saying this earlier, like, is one of the best teams in the world at writing new code and building unique stuff in defi. So, you know, if they can be vulnerable to this, I don't know, it kind of spooks me.
00:22:03.028 - 00:22:23.100, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think there's another important thing that we should talk about. There's been a fair bit of community discussion, just because on Sunday morning, when the first, I think Alchemyx was the first food that got exploited, peck shield, if I'm not wrong, like, tweeted out, saying, like, hey, at alchemix, you should probably check this transaction.
00:22:23.132 - 00:22:24.468, Speaker A: No, it was jpEg.
00:22:24.516 - 00:23:09.180, Speaker C: Oh, jpEg. They basically added the JPEG protocol on Twitter, saying, hey, you should check out this transaction. And this is something they do pretty often when there's a hack going, they'll tag the team on a tweet and they'll put like a screenshot of the transaction showing there's like, a large amount of funds leaving a protocol. I think on the day there wasn't so much attention paid to it. But in the past few days, I've seen a lot of discussion on Twitter. You know, did tech shield, or, I think blogsec, also posted about the exploit, or, like, the vulnerability? Should they have posted about that exploit on Twitter before, like, getting in touch with, like, white hat hackers or curvy selves? I think there's a few sides to what happened. Apparently they tried contacting the curve team, but they didn't get a response from them, and so they had to resort to Twitter, etc.
00:23:09.180 - 00:23:55.340, Speaker C: Etc. But there is, like, a certain moral discussion to have. What is the best avenue to let someone know of, like, an ongoing exploit? Should crypto have sort of like centralized war rooms, like a group of white hat hackers that are always ready on standby to respond to, like, an exploit and. Yeah, sort of like, who is really to blame. Would the exploit or the magnitude of the exploit have been so large had they not posted that on Twitter? Because my gut feeling is that hackers, like the original hackers themselves, not like generalized front running mev bots, those people are fairly unsophisticated, I want to say. Sometimes it's just they find like an interesting quirk in the protocol. And you know, half the time you read about, you read up about hackers like they haven't figured out how to launder the money.
00:23:55.340 - 00:24:17.254, Speaker C: Like the Euler finance one. That guy had zero plan with what to do with the funds. And so perhaps he didn't have idea or other people didn't have this idea of using this reentrancy attack vector, but it's only cause boxec or peculiar. Whoever posted about on Twitter, then they were made aware of it, and that sort of exacerbated the effects of the exploit.
00:24:17.594 - 00:24:27.874, Speaker A: Can't have your cake and eat it too. Like, I don't think you can have a fully transparent industry where everything is on chain and, and not have this stuff happen. Right?
00:24:28.814 - 00:25:31.538, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I'm sympathetic to that to the extent that a sufficiently sophisticated black hat could have looked at these exploit transactions and sort of reverse engineered how it came about. But I think yesterday was a really unique situation in that there was this foot race underway between the white hats and the black hats. And you know, Richard Chen over at Otterseck wrote a great blog post about these two failed white hat transactions that didn't work because they didn't do it in time, by a matter of minutes, by a matter of seconds. The black hats beat them by a few blocks. And I think in a situation like that, peck shield laying out, and later in the day, block sec doing the same, laying out exactly how thing to execute these malicious transactions. I mean, it rises above a moral question. It might open them up to legal liability.
00:25:31.626 - 00:25:32.654, Speaker A: I truly do.
00:25:35.074 - 00:25:53.976, Speaker B: It was a unique situation. And usually pecks shield does, like, I think of them as a public good when they tweet out, hey, there's an exploit underway. But when there was still vulnerability and there were people, you know, engaged in this race against time to try and save user funds, that's a dicey situation.
00:25:54.080 - 00:26:29.922, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe before getting into the, like, how much got hacked, I was gonna shift into Michael's position liquidations. But maybe before that we can talk about these MEV bots and kind of this battle between. So there are three groups that got money out of this. There are the black hat hacker, they're the hackers right. The bad guys, basically. Then there are the white hat hackers, um, who are hacking it, but kind of siphoning off money into these safe pools with the aim to keep it safe over here and then send it back. And then there were the MEV bots, which adds a really interesting third party here.
00:26:29.922 - 00:26:47.164, Speaker A: So, Andrew, can you walk us through these three groups, but maybe focus on the MEV bots? Cause that's this, like, new group that isn't. There's usually two groups here, white hat and black hat. And there's now, we now have a third 3rd party here. I think it was coffee babe was the biggest.
00:26:47.504 - 00:26:48.104, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:48.224 - 00:26:50.088, Speaker B: My new personal hero, coffee babe.
00:26:50.136 - 00:26:50.296, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:50.320 - 00:26:53.804, Speaker A: Truly. So, yeah. Give us some details on these MeV bots.
00:26:54.544 - 00:27:19.314, Speaker B: Yeah. How to explain it in layman's terms. So I think to sort of add to your, you know, somebody's sort of playing a trick on the bank teller scenario. Imagine that they successfully do that. But right as they're walking out of the bank, somebody walks up and takes the money from them instead. And they're of the ones who actually leave the bank with the money in hand. So there's a type of Mev searcher, usually MeV bots.
00:27:19.314 - 00:28:22.746, Speaker B: Nine times out of ten, they're just arbitrageurs. They identify price discrepancies between different trading venues, and they execute these incredibly high efficiency, incredibly quick trades in order to make little slivers of profit. There are also these types of MeV searchers, known as generalized frontrunners, where they will identify profitable transactions and seek to execute them before the person who's actually identified them. Coffeebabe ETH is a really well known MeV bought and address throughout the day. Yesterday, in addition to executing two different exploit transactions that somebody else had designed, they simply used generalized front running to identify it in the mempool and execute that transaction run before the other people could. They were doing meme coin trades all day. This address, like, in addition to rescuing these funds, was trading like Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic Inu for fractions of a cent.
00:28:22.746 - 00:29:23.264, Speaker B: It's just an incredibly well designed bot, and it's worth mentioning that this address had done this in the past. There was a sushi exploit that they front ran and ended up returning the funds. So later in the day, when this poster woke up and realized they had about 4000 ETH more than they should in this bot, can you imagine waking up and figuring that out and got in touch with the affected teams and from what I understand, has returned almost all of it. They had a little bit of MP ETH, and they also front ran a second exploit of the curve ETH pool that got 2800 ETH, and I believe they've returned all of it. There might still be a little bit more MP ETH that they're holding, but this is somebody who's done this in the past. And if anyone ever kidnaps me, just send a single incredibly cracked slavic mev guy after me. That's the person I want in my corner.
00:29:23.264 - 00:29:26.024, Speaker B: They're just an incredible force.
00:29:26.884 - 00:30:01.674, Speaker A: It was wild watching this in real time. I mean, you're watching a hacker, you're watching in real time as a hacker identifies a vulnerability, tries to steal. I think the one I was watching was, like, it was worth, like, $5 million, and then coffee babe basically just scanned it, saw the trade, bid some higher gas, and replicated the transaction, outbid them, secured the funds, and yeah, they're returning the stolen ETH to curve. So it's awesome to see. I love it. I think it's exciting. Ren, anything else on the white hat, black hat Mev?
00:30:02.054 - 00:31:26.600, Speaker C: I want to say the most interesting angle for, like, a lot of these hacks, actually, not just the curve hack, is the legal angle. Like, if I'm running a generalized run runner bot, and I don't really have control over the bot, it's just like, looking at transactions, but then I'm copying a malicious transaction that's exploited some protocol. Am I on the hook for this? And then similarly, like, across the whole mev supply chain, you know, from searchers to builders to proposers, like, all of them get some proceeds for, like, bids that are placed throughout the way. If a hacker exploited, like, 1000 ETH, and he bid 50 ETH to get his bundle, like, included, do I have to give that 50 eve that I want as a proposer back? I think we've seen this play out in the past. I think it was sushi, sushi swap. Like, for example, one of the lighter veterans got a hefty chunk of 70 from that sushi exploit, and Susu was, like, begging for it back. And in the back of my mind, is Lido really, or is the proposal the one really on the hook here? Or should it be on the hacker to return the full amount of original sums, even though he used 5% of that, say, to pay the proposal to get his bundle included? I just think it's, like, a really interesting, great area that's gonna happen again and again for the foreseeable future.
00:31:26.632 - 00:31:52.044, Speaker A: Future, yeah, I agree with you. Let's drift. Focus a little bit. As this happened, the price of curve. So there's curve, the protocol, and then there's crv, the token. As this was happening, you started seeing a bunch of sell pressure on CRV, which then shifted attention to Michael, the founder of Curve CRV position. Turns out he had levered up, basically his CRV position.
00:31:52.044 - 00:31:55.874, Speaker A: What was the total amount of loans? It was like 100 million or 80.
00:31:55.914 - 00:32:09.354, Speaker B: Million or something prior to the hack. And he almost immediately started adjusting his positions and trying to pay down some of it. He had about, if I can recall correctly, 115 million in outstanding stablecoin loans.
00:32:09.434 - 00:32:59.176, Speaker A: Okay, so he had basically backed. He had basically put like 400 million of CRV, I think, and taken as collateral. These are rough numbers. I'm sure I'm getting them a little bit wrong. And had taken out $115 million loan and had used that capital to go buy some pretty nice mansions in, I think, Australia. So the sell pressure on crv kind of shifted attention to Michael's crv position and the potential of not only his liquidations, but then if he gets liquidated, what the cascading liquidations in DeFi and specifically on Frax and Aave would look like. Can you guys walk us through just like, almost this self perpetuating cycle of sell offs and people, like, what it means to almost, like, target this kind of vulnerable crv position and what you guys were watching for here?
00:32:59.320 - 00:33:51.100, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically, Michael or Mitch had a number of loan positions on five different lending protocols. Includes Ave, Faxland, avocados, Debra, and a few other side small ones. I think they were a silo and inverse, basically, on all of them, he pledged varying amounts of curve collateral, and he brought, I think, mostly USDT or some other stable coins against it. And when you borrow on a DeFi lending protocol, your loan has to stay above a certain liquidation ratio, because everything in DeFi has to be over collateralized. We haven't really figured out under collateralized lending yet. So as the value of curve went down, then people started really, really getting worried about potential liquidations from these lending protocols.
00:33:51.100 - 00:34:27.723, Speaker C: And what happens during a liquidation is basically someone else comes back and pays back a portion of the debt. It's not always 100% of the debt. It could be 50% of the debt first. And then he'll assume a certain percentage of the collateral, and in an ideal world, he'll sell the collateral for a stable to basically make, like, raw, like, atomic profit within one bundle of transactions. The problem is that you have to sell curve in order to sort of get back to, like, a us dollar denominated. Profit. And that's basically where things start going wrong, because we talked about how the curve at web flew on.
00:34:27.723 - 00:35:14.024, Speaker C: Curve itself was exploited for $20 million worth of liquidity. So if you wanted to liquidate however much curve that niche had pledged across Defi, it's just not really possible. If you looked at the stats after the curve was exploited, a $1 million curve cell had around 85% slippage. A hundred million dollar curve cell had around 99.15% slippage, or some ridiculous number. I think like a 300 million curve cell is just straight up impossible. And for these liquidations to work effectively, the slippage can't be like 85 or 95%, because the liquidator incentives is only, say, like 5% for AAVE.
00:35:14.024 - 00:36:05.630, Speaker C: And so ideally, your slippage needs to be a lot less than that if you want to incentivize anyone to liquidate. And it is sort of like a game tv problem in some sense, because if one protocol liquidates first, then whoever liquidates after him gets a worse execution price when trying to sell his curve. And if protocols aren't able to liquidate his debt at a good enough price, then what you end up is bad debt. Basically, the protocol has lost money on a dollar basis, and they have to assume that debt themselves, and different protocols handle this. Tiffany, they have insurance funds, but given the amount of Mitch's loans, chances are they would have had to dig into both their insurance fund, and more often than not, they would print their native token in order to sell that off to cover whatever bad debt they have. It's just not a good position to be in.
00:36:05.822 - 00:36:17.754, Speaker A: Andrew, what were you looking for here? As you were looking at cascading liquidations, you were looking at AavE, you were looking at fracs, you were looking at maybe the interest rate exponentially increasing in the fracs pool. What did you focus in on?
00:36:18.174 - 00:36:58.056, Speaker B: Well, yeah, there was a point, I think you mentioned this earlier, where his position was being actively hunted. It had been attacked in the past. Avraham Eisenberg of Mango markets exploit fame had previously attempted to go after this position by taking out a massive curve short position on AAVE. He ended up losing, I believe, $10 million. But during the course of the attack, Aave itself was left with about $1.6 million in bad debt as well. And so this is a position that Defi nerds were aware of.
00:36:58.056 - 00:38:08.092, Speaker B: It's arguably one of the most closely watched in all of Defi. Maybe there's people keeping closer eyes on what Justin Sun's up to, but this was a well known account with this massive position, and opportunistic traders had already gone after it in the past, and I think very much did here as well. The frac stablecoin pool was topped out. And the way Frax's market works is, if it is overutilized, the interest rate increases at some absurd level, doubling every couple of hours until either there are more depositors or until people pay back their debt. Arguably a clever design, because the protocol forced Michael Yurov to pay down a significant portion of his debt. Otherwise he would have been liquidated, and it could have led to some nasty problems. What I'm keeping an eye on, as the dust is settled, we'll talk about some of these OTC deals that Igarov executed in order to pay down a lot of these positions.
00:38:08.092 - 00:39:08.816, Speaker B: But there are a few of these lending marketplaces now that are taking what I think are pretty extraordinary measures to defend themselves and prioritize themselves relative to some of these other outlets. Abracadabra is one that attempted to pass a governance proposal earlier today that would have increased the interest rate on the curve markets by 200%. This is obviously targeting a single user. I think you start to get into questions about, is this the right ethical thing? You know, is it Michael's fault for taking out a loan on a protocol where governance had the power to do this to what? Who is in the right in these kind of extraordinary situations? And how do you handle the game theory aspect of it when it's a lot of curve to liquidate and it's unclear that all of these protocols would be able to do it safely.
00:39:08.960 - 00:40:15.714, Speaker C: I think the slightly more contentious point of that Abracadabra governance proposal was that not only were they going to jack up interest to 200% in the original proposal, a updated one, I think only is proposing 130%, but that interest would be applied directly to the collateral itself. It's not interest that's accruing on the collateral. Basically what this means is that a centralized, multisig run by the advocate average team is saying, okay, chances are you're not paying this back right now to protect ourselves, are going to slowly claw back your curve collateral, which, like, it's not a liquidation, it's like a soft and slow and gradual liquidation, and then average adaptor is going to slowly top sell that over the course of, for example, six months. I think that was a point of contention, on top of the fact that they're kind of rugging or hunting his position by setting the interest to 200%. On top of that, they're just saying, hey, you know, like, we don't care. We're going through, like, centralized multi state. We're going to slowly claw back your collateral without, like, officially liquidating you.
00:40:15.794 - 00:40:21.754, Speaker A: Are they hunting his? I don't know if I'd categorize that as hunting his position by abracadabra. Like, this just feels like them protecting.
00:40:21.794 - 00:40:22.786, Speaker C: Themselves, I want to say.
00:40:22.810 - 00:40:36.490, Speaker A: Forcing him to repay. Yeah, repay it. Knowing that he has to repay. There's a bunch of people he has to repay, and they want to get repaid first. Right. That's interesting. So the, like, summary of, like, his position.
00:40:36.490 - 00:41:05.094, Speaker A: Um, so if he was going to get. Let me tell me if I got this right. If he was going to get liquidated by Fraxland, all of his other debt positions were going to get liquidated, too, which would have meant that, like, there would be a couple protocols that would probably die due to bad debt, like. Like Mim, or, like, inverse finance and things like that. And then Aave was going to get stuck with a bunch of bad debt that they would have had to sell off in the open market. Is that like, is that kind of the second order impact of his position there, or do you think it goes deeper than that?
00:41:05.514 - 00:41:42.430, Speaker B: I think that that's a fair. I mean, it's hard to guess what would have happened. Right. One thing that he does is he tends to keep his positions all at roughly the same health level. And so I think the worst possible thing that could have happened was liquidation hit at every protocol at the same time. That would have been really ugly. But Ave's safety module, which is effectively their insurance backstop fund, they've got about 95 million in liquidity, and they would have had to sell aave to cover that bad debt.
00:41:42.430 - 00:41:49.558, Speaker B: But they hypothetically had the liquidity waiting there, and that would have been really nasty. It would have been. What's that?
00:41:49.646 - 00:41:57.474, Speaker A: Didn't they just propose to do that? Didn't Zeller over at Aave propose to start buying it back? Or are they not doing that?
00:41:58.494 - 00:42:08.514, Speaker C: They did. They might do that this morning, or at least, like, a governance proposal was put up very, very recently to acquire some of the curve, use that for their own native stablecoin goal.
00:42:11.214 - 00:42:51.554, Speaker B: Clever, but yeah, no, I think now everybody is taking these sort of half measures, but it's really curious to think about what would have happened if it had all hit at once. I think Aave where the majority of the loan outstanding loan is, I think he still has about 58 million in stables taken out from there. They would have hypothetically been able to handle it, but only if they were the only ones getting liquidated. If everybody got liquidated at the same time and the price of curve went to zero, it would have gotten really, really ugly. And it's tough to know exactly what that would have looked like, but it could have been much, much worse than it currently is, is all I'll say.
00:42:51.674 - 00:43:02.974, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like I'm looking at curve right now. It looks like money's starting to flood back into curve a little bit. Do you guys think we've seen the is the worst of it behind us, basically?
00:43:03.554 - 00:43:28.764, Speaker C: I think so. If you look at the numbers, curves, TVL dropped 50% in one day from, I think, 3.1 billion to 1.5 billion, since slowly rebounded to 2.1 billion. I would say without the OTC deals, that probably, like, the contagion would still be spreading. But I think the OTC deals has sort of calmed the storm a little bit for now.
00:43:29.544 - 00:44:03.616, Speaker B: And it is important to note, too, that Michael Igorov is a tremendously well capitalized individual. He's got a vesting schedule where, like, 140,000 curve tokens unlock to him every single day. And so, yes, that's on his dbank profile. You can look that up. And that's in addition to the curve rewards that he's a prolific defi user. He's earning farming rewards every day, too. And so the longer this goes on, the healthier his positions start to look, just by virtue of how he's arranged his portfolio.
00:44:03.760 - 00:44:33.444, Speaker A: Wow, that's nuts. I didn't realize that. We'll put a link to his dbank profile. I'm looking at it right here. All right, tell us about these OTC deals. So if he had started dumping into the market, that obviously would have been really bad for the market, and that would have probably exacerbated this. So he started doing these OTC deals that looked like three to six month lockups at a price of $40, with a call option in a three to six month lockup that can be sold if the price reaches $0.80.
00:44:33.444 - 00:44:38.104, Speaker A: Something along those lines. But can one of you guys walk us through the details of these OTC deals?
00:44:38.684 - 00:45:15.160, Speaker C: Sure. It wasn't exactly Michael selling on the open market because all of his curve is locked up as collateral. So you can't sell something that's locked up as collateral because removing it as collateral would immediately decrease the health of your loan. So what actually happened was that he agreed to sell curve to certain parties. I think I'll let Andrew dive into all of the parties that he sold OTC too. But he agreed to sell curve to a lot of these parties. And what these parties did first was that they first transferred him USDT or other stable coins.
00:45:15.160 - 00:45:42.852, Speaker C: He repaid his debt, and then after repaying a portion of his debt, he took out some of his curve collateral and gave it to whoever bought these curve tokens. Because doing it like the other way in, like how a sale should be done, like, just wouldn't work for him, given that his positions on the lending protocols existed. And he made like a bunch of OTC deals to some good, some bad people. There's different ways of looking at the solid and we dive into that a little bit more.
00:45:42.988 - 00:45:49.344, Speaker A: But who are there? DWF labs. It was Justin Sun. DCF God maki.
00:45:49.884 - 00:46:35.384, Speaker B: Yeah. Jeffrey Hwang. Michael Patron, aka Zero x Sifu, who was involved in the collapse. Well, he was a former executive at Quadriga CX, one of the largest sort of old school exchange scams. This is a lot of very well known individuals who have a sometimes spotty reputation. And you have to wonder, these are the buyers of last resort, the prolific market maker and OTC desk Wintermute, the founder, Evgeny Gavoy. He said that because of the people who were involved in these deals, they specifically declined to onboard Michael Ikarov as a counterparty.
00:46:35.384 - 00:47:30.420, Speaker B: And Igarov is also being sued by a trio of pretty well known american venture capital firms. And I can imagine, I don't know what was happening in the course of these conversations, but it's not hard to imagine a world in which he didn't have a lot of willing buyers. And so he turns to these people who are very well capitalized, but don't always have the greatest reputation. It's really interesting deal terms too. He was selling curve for about forty cents per token, which was significant haircut to the market price, about a 33% gulf there. And additionally, there is an option for the buyers to sell if the price of curve ever eclipses eighty cents. And that's now like lots and lots of curve that's circulating.
00:47:30.532 - 00:47:52.770, Speaker A: That could potentially feel like Michael's basically just trying to extend this out as long as possible because of the unlock schedule, right. The curve unlocks schedule. Like over the next, next year, 400 million curve gets unlocked, 200 million goes to the core team, 100 million goes to Mitch. Right? So it feels like he's basically just like scrambling. I mean, this is a really good deal for them. They get to buy at this. What did you say it was? 33% discount.
00:47:52.770 - 00:48:01.054, Speaker A: And then they can. I mean, they can just short on perps to cover the risk. So it's kind of a no brainer deal for them, it seems like.
00:48:01.594 - 00:48:05.214, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if they had offered it to me, I would have taken it.
00:48:06.674 - 00:48:08.354, Speaker A: Stepped up with your 50 million.
00:48:08.514 - 00:48:39.882, Speaker B: That's right. That's right. Defi reporter stepping in to save all of Defi. No, I think that the other thing that could lead to some really interesting situations, too, is that these were handshake deals. These vesting schedules are not enforced by a smart contract. From what I understand. A few people, including Machi, interestingly enough, have sort of deposited them into, have since sort of locked them of their own volition.
00:48:39.882 - 00:49:01.646, Speaker B: But some of the stuff that was sold, OTC was sent to Binance, and there's no way to have any transparency on whether or not those were sold. And so it seems like in addition to these deals being made with people who aren't your ideal counterparty, necessarily, it just really feels like it was done. Somebody making deals with their back to the wall a little bit.
00:49:01.790 - 00:49:25.190, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Usually what happens in these situations, I feel like. Like we saw it when, you know, when all the. When everything was kind of collapsing, whether it was with terra or whether it was with Celsius or blockfi or FTX stuff, is. These come in waves, right? It's like all of crypto Twitter's attention is on this for, like, three or four days. I have a feeling in the next two or three weeks, things will quiet down.
00:49:25.190 - 00:49:28.594, Speaker A: But I also have a feeling this is not the last we've heard of this.
00:49:29.494 - 00:49:50.042, Speaker B: Yeah, the positions are all healthier now. You'd need the price of curve to go down to 28, $0.27 or something like that for these to come under fire again. But, yeah, I mean, this position has been hunted in the past. It's been hunted in the last week. There's no reason to think that it won't happen again.
00:49:50.178 - 00:49:56.014, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Anything else, guys, that you think is interesting or important to talk about on curve?
00:49:56.794 - 00:51:15.814, Speaker C: I think a good question to ask here is that how did these lending protocols end up in this position? Because obviously, your blockchain is an open database. You can pretty openly see how much liquidity there is if you want to liquidate a certain specific collateral type. A lot of these lending protocols have employed risk managers in the recent years. I think it's been more of, like, come to the spotlight in the last year or so. For example, gauntlet or chaos labs, whose job is to basically help manage risk for these lending protocols and so, yeah, it really begs the question, if there is barely any curve liquidity on chain in DeFi, why are we allowing like 427 million units worth of curve to be pledged as collateral? I don't really blame Mitch here for what he did. To be very honest, I feel like I blame the lending protocols slightly more. If you let me take out a loan against an asset that I know is kind of illiquid, and you allow me to take out like $100 million, to be honest, I think most of us would have done the same just to retain like the equity or like token ownership in our own protocol or startup.
00:51:15.814 - 00:52:10.242, Speaker C: It's the job of the lender to sort of price the liquidity of that collateral asset. I think it's similar like Web two or like Trad, for example, is the peloton founder, right? At that peak, Pederson was worth so, so much, and from what I've heard, he took out a loan against his equity, went to buy a private jet, went and buy a yacht, went and buy all the nice houses. There's a similar trend there. And then when Pediton just started going down and down and down go, and Sachs kind of came here and said, hey, you have to repay your loan. And then when you realize what all of his loans were deployed in, like, it's kind of hard to do and sell like a private jet on a whim. So, yeah, I think there's a few things that are also very interesting. Gauntlet or a few other risk managers for Aave have repeatedly sort of put up governance proposals to say, hey, I think we should bring the loan value down to zero.
00:52:10.242 - 00:53:02.408, Speaker C: Don't let Mitch pledge any more curve collateral. Don't let him borrow more against his curve collateral. And if I'm not wrong, every step of the way, the community or the DAO token holders have voted against managing risk for Mitch's position, which I think is a very interesting case since the risk is obviously there. Everyone's just kind of fingers crossed, hoping that it doesn't happen. And this brings me to my other point. Where do you lending protocols go from here? Assuming that there's not much they can do about their current position, a first obvious next step would be rather than incorporating just pure oracles to use as a liquidation price, you use sort of market depth oracles either for on chain or off chain markets to see, hey, here is this amount of liquidity that's available. Here's how much you would get if you would sell x amount of this.
00:53:02.408 - 00:54:18.214, Speaker C: And you will sort of price interest rates or loan to values against that. So that brings us to another point. If, for example, there's an on chain oracle, right? And it shows, okay, every protocol, or there's a liquidity pool where someone will be able to liquidate $30 million worth of curve, okay, like they'll take a 3% slippage, not the end of the world. It wouldn't leave the protocol bad debt, right? And so you're a lending protocol, you see that $30 million worth of liquidity through oracle or something, and you're like, okay, I'm comfortable to lend x amount, right? But the problem is that multiple lending protocols are sharing that same liquidity. You know, like everyone will see as if they were acting insidal. But perhaps there will be five lending protocols out there with the exact same curve collateral, the exact same position, and all of them would need to liquidate through that same liquidity boot. Then there's also a question of basically, do I want to sort of be greedy? Do I just assume that other people won't want to maximize their profits, maximize like the LTV or sort of collateral that I'm able to purchase curve? Because at that point, you're kind of self limiting, you know? And I think we've seen enough in defi that people don't really like self limiting, even though we're all about like decentralization, managing risk, blah, blah, blah.
00:54:18.214 - 00:54:31.754, Speaker C: But people just don't like self limiting and they want to maximize their business or profit. So it becomes like a bit of a contentious point there. And those are just like a few thoughts on where lending protocols go from here.
00:54:32.574 - 00:55:09.624, Speaker B: Yeah, those. No, those are really good points. I saw Michael Bentley, one of the Euler founders, they're in the process of getting back on their feet. He was talking about how I think this is a real watershed moment for governance and lending protocols. And you were touching on this a bit when Gauntlet, the guys over there, they've forgotten more about risk than the entire of the ave Dao will ever know, right? And the Aave Dao consistently votes against them. That's a real problem. I do like models like Eulers and Ren.
00:55:09.624 - 00:55:42.366, Speaker B: Your idea about the liquidity depth oracles, you can build more sophisticated, more complex oracles, but maybe the solution is actually to make it simpler. I always really liked Euler's model because risk parameters were defined on how much depth is there on uniswap v three. And that's it. I think that this could significantly change how people think about lending architecture, because there is now this kind of universal recognition that we should not have allowed ourselves to get into this place and how do we prevent it in the future?
00:55:42.510 - 00:55:47.990, Speaker A: So really, Andrew, really, the question that you're bringing up, or I guess, who said this is Michael at Euler, I guess.
00:55:48.022 - 00:55:48.342, Speaker C: Really? Yeah.
00:55:48.358 - 00:56:17.374, Speaker A: Michael Benton you're bringing up is like, should lending protocols be governed by Dao governance, or should you let, or is there a different model that makes more sense? Like, should lending protocol parameters be set by the market or by Dow members and something like Aave, you know, it sounds like they're voting against gauntlet. I haven't followed that too closely. But, like, in Euler, the way I think it works is like, you know, the lending protocol parameters are just set by the market and, like, by market depth, basically.
00:56:17.754 - 00:56:39.094, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think, like, I think dows are good. I'm a pro Dow guy. Like Dows are, we're probably at the absolute trough of the bear market in terms of, like, Dow sentiment. Right. I think they're really good for a lot of things, but maybe they shouldn't be good for determining risk parameters of lending protocols.
00:56:40.514 - 00:58:06.610, Speaker C: Yeah, just a few extra points there. I think two things that I would like to see. The first is that since you need liquidity to liquidate a certain collateral if it goes bad, why don't daos, or, sorry, why don't lending protocols start as helping accepting LP tokens as collateral tokens? Because then you're kind of guaranteed that there is liquidity, or at least there should be some way to incentivize liquidity for a collateral that you want to accept on your lending protocol. And I think another thing that I've been sort of mulling over is the role of these risk managers. These risk managers do have a significance, significant amount of, I'm not sure if power is the right word since there is still, like, Dow governance that can vote on their proposals, but they get to set a lot of parameters, you know, like they get to change, like interest rate functions, LTV, like what markets are accepted. And I don't have a good take on this, on whether it's a good or bad thing that if in the future, a lot of these protocols, whether it's like a lending borrowing protocol or perhaps like a derivative protocol, needs to bring a team of professional risk managers to manage all of it, because it definitely should not be left to daos. I don't think DaO participants have a good idea of how to price liquid collateral.
00:58:06.610 - 00:58:26.274, Speaker C: I'm not sure even I do. So, yeah, it's just interesting to see where that future could potentially go, especially because the Dow members rejected all of Gauntlet's proposals to sort of reduce the risk. I just think there's a bit of a fundamental clash there, say, hmm, it's really interesting.
00:58:28.014 - 00:58:54.314, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess if you think about the way it works in tradfi, you're not just like, there's not one lend and borrow model that works for everyone, right. The bank is going to price the risk on a very individual basis, which I guess if you applied that to DeFi, that could work better, but you're also really fragmenting liquidity. So that's an interesting. Yeah, interesting conversation to have. So, Andrew Ren, good chat, guys. Anything else that we're missing here?
00:58:55.734 - 00:59:31.238, Speaker C: I would just say one last thing. Still staying on the lending protocol. I think there's been sort of a revival on the talks of how the price risk within lending protocols and people have come up with the idea of just letting lenders themselves decide the risk that they're willing to price rather than letting a protocol decide it for you. And so what that kind of looks like is a central limit order book for lending. You say, I'm willing to take this as collateral against whatever I'm willing to lend out. This is the Max Ltv that I'm willing to charge. I'm going to decide my own interest rate markets.
00:59:31.238 - 01:00:29.210, Speaker C: And I think the parallel here is that liquidity providers for lending and borrowing protocols may also have to get more sophisticated. Like this is a trend that we've seen indexes just inactive, unsophisticated LP's are completely getting bragged. Like every curve, every uniswap foo is dominated by like ten lp's who make up more than 8% of the liquidity. And especially with Uniswap v four Uniswap X, chances are that becomes even more complicated. And so we're moving, we're really moving to a reliance or a dependence or sort of like a centralizing force on these sophisticated liquidity providers. And I sort of see the same thing happening for lending and borrowing protocols. I think that's a whole other debate, whether like, having large sophisticated liquidity providers and being dependent on them is a good or bad thing, similar to like, is a centralized builder a good or bad thing for Ethereum.
01:00:29.210 - 01:00:32.210, Speaker C: But yeah, I think that's just a point that I wanted to make.
01:00:32.402 - 01:01:26.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I just throw it there that there's already a really good lead for the peath pool hacker. And I have a lot of friends who work in these war rooms and I know that they're some of the best analysts on the planet. So it wouldn't surprise me if even more of the money we start finding suspects and a lot of it starts coming back and so thinking about this hack and how it's going to be remembered is going to be really interesting because ultimately this wasn't even was this a top ten hack? Was this a top 20 when all said and done, the amount stolen isn't going to be that much when everything's been accounted for. But I think the impact it'll have and the way it's going to fundamentally change a lot of lending market architecture, it's going to be important for reasons other than the dollar amounts and that's pretty cool.
01:01:27.194 - 01:01:37.044, Speaker A: I like that take. Let's end there guys. This is a great conversation. I hope you guys enjoyed this, hope you guys got some value and hopefully understand why this curve hack is so important. So Ren, Andrew, thanks for the time guys.
01:01:37.544 - 01:01:39.024, Speaker C: Likewise. Pleasure being here.
01:01:39.064 - 01:01:39.804, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:01:40.384 - 01:01:40.944, Speaker C: Bye, Andrew.
