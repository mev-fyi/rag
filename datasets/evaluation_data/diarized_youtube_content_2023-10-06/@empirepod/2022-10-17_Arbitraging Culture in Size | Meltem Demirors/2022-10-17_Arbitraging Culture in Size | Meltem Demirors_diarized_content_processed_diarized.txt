00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.354, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by circle, the issuer of USDC, which hopefully, as you all know, is the preferred stablecoin of digital natives and crypto natives, with over 1.5 million holders globally. You'll hear more about USDC later in the show.
00:00:15.894 - 00:00:45.784, Speaker B: So one of the really interesting things is we believe culture is kind of the submergent property, but it's not. Culture is created. Culture is created by people who create the content. It's created by people who monetize the content. It's created by people who own the algorithms that enable you to discover content. Like, this idea that culture is somehow an emergent property is bullshit in many ways. There are emergent cultural movements from time to time.
00:00:45.784 - 00:00:52.244, Speaker B: But the process of creating culture is process very well studied. It's very influenced by psychology.
00:00:54.464 - 00:01:06.094, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. When Cain came on the show, he called himself the benevolent dictator Meltam. Today seems to be calling himself Djen Princess Meltom. Is that what we're calling you today?
00:01:06.634 - 00:01:12.666, Speaker B: I used this on Riverside a while ago, and I guess it's just. It stays. It sticks. It sticks.
00:01:12.690 - 00:01:15.854, Speaker A: It's a good. It's a Djen princess. That's a good bear market name.
00:01:17.154 - 00:01:24.166, Speaker B: Also a good bull market name. It works in all markets. We're versatile. Yeah, no, we're versatile here.
00:01:24.250 - 00:01:26.838, Speaker A: Yes. A lot of utility. A lot of utility for that name.
00:01:26.926 - 00:01:28.158, Speaker B: Max utility.
00:01:28.326 - 00:01:59.252, Speaker A: Exactly. There are two big things I want to talk about today, and then I have a feeling, knowing you, that this conversation will go in a bunch of different directions. There's one idea, which is like, that you have. That I've heard you talk about, which is, like, all we're doing, this whole thing, all this has been in crypto, is just a big story about market structure. And all we're doing here is just building probably what maybe you would call, like, more efficient market structure. New forms of market structure, market structure around things that have never had a market structure around them. So I want to talk about that idea.
00:01:59.252 - 00:02:26.044, Speaker A: And then you also have this idea around arbitraging culture. And you, more than maybe other people that I know, have been probably ahead of the curve when it comes to arbitrage and culture. So those are the two big things I want to talk about. You had this great piece on NFT microstructure that we'll put in the show notes that I would recommend people read. But maybe Melto, if you could start out just like, what do you mean by this? Has always been a story about market structure. What do you mean by that?
00:02:26.664 - 00:03:29.380, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think when people first get into the crypto space, crypto has its own syntax, its own language, and we love inventing new words and phrases and terms. But at its core, what I think has always been so fascinating about taking assets and putting them on a global, permissionless, credibly neutral settlement medium is basically the way that markets normally are constructed, right? Is you have people who want to buy and you have people who want to sell. These people need to find one another, figure out the price at which the trade will clear, the size in which the trade will clear. The trade happens, and then there's this whole workflow that happens once you match, that allows the trade to actually get executed, the trade to get cleared, meaning both parties agree on settlement. Then the trade actually settles, which means assets swap hands, and then there's post trade reconciliation. After the trade, you account for it, you do all your little paperwork, everyone's happy, trade is done.
00:03:29.380 - 00:04:29.664, Speaker B: What's really interesting, and that's the world I operated in for my seven years, my career before crypto. And then when I came over into crypto, what was really cool, and at that time, it was only bitcoin. What was really cool about bitcoin is you didn't have to construct any of those layers. Once you matched with someone, you could do everything on chain. And so one of the really cool things, if you think about market structure, is for the first time, we have all of these really interesting protocols with different features, different attributes that allow us to effectively create really efficient, automated markets using this underlying substrate. And so the crypto story, in my view, is, and has always been a market structure story. I think the challenges is a lot of people who are in crypto don't come from a market's background.
00:04:29.664 - 00:05:20.512, Speaker B: So the way they understand it, the way they articulate it, it's like engineers discovering, like, markets and finance for the first time. Not a criticism, but it's just, it's, if you're like an electrical engineer in Comp Sci, you're typically not trading markets. And if you're trading markets, you're typically not doing comp sci. There's a rare crossover of people who do do that, and those people, believe it or not, are the people who got into bitcoin in 2012, 2013 and have been incredibly successful because they understood that market story. But I think one of the things I'm really passionate about is teaching people, helping people understand what market structure is, and helping them understand what the implications of more efficient, more global, uniform market structure looks like. Because the opportunity is absolutely massive. And everything, everything has a market.
00:05:20.512 - 00:06:07.300, Speaker B: The other cool thing is we can give things that have implicit value, explicit value now, which is where the cultural capital component comes in. But we're constantly pricing things all day, right? Like your audience is deciding whether or not they want to listen to this podcast. There's an implicit utility function calculation they're doing, right? Like, everything has value to us. The activities that we've seen and spend time on, our attention, the things we care about, things we spend money on, they all have value. We now have this really cool capability to try to articulate that value in new ways and then apply this market structure to it. So again, it all goes back to market structure, which I realize people are going to get very tired of hearing me say the words market structure. I apologize in advance, but it is really, it's a market story.
00:06:07.492 - 00:06:37.484, Speaker C: Yeah, it's an interesting point you bring up, Maltem. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the common criticism we hear is, this is all speculation. And, you know, why should NFts be worth x and why should tokens be worth y? I'm curious, like what? Especially now in the bear market, where things have come down a lot, this. We keep hearing this criticism over and over. What would you say to those folks that are very skeptical of just calling crypto just a pure speculative asset class, has no value, has no worth, and tying that in with market structure.
00:06:38.224 - 00:07:24.966, Speaker B: Okay. I think this gets into a slightly different part of how markets work. A lot of people, when I talk to them about crypto or what I do or what I'm excited about, they'll say, Melton, that's great. But I live in the real world. I work with real assets and real companies. So there is, I think, Santi, to your point, this interesting perception, or this interesting bias, like a lot of people who got into investing, read Benjamin Graham's the value investor, right? I grew up in the world of corporate finance. So the way you evaluate a company is on the basis of balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement, right? Those are kind of your three holy grail documents in corporate finance.
00:07:24.966 - 00:08:24.232, Speaker B: And so there is, I think, this really interesting, again, question about utility, particularly for people who operate in the world of commodities or equities or bonds or fixed income. They operate in this world where things have a very concrete, defined function. They understand the utility. And I think the challenge for them is, again, if we think about the field of corporate finance, if we think about the field of just economics and investing more broadly, that is a science that is a discipline that has matured over the last 100, 5200 years, arguably even before that, right? We think about Coase's theory of the firm. We think about all of these innovations and these fundamental truths that we now take for granted when it comes to the world of stock companies and understanding companies that generate cash flow. Crypto is bitcoin's 13 years old, almost 1413 years old. Ethereum is about five years old, six years old.
00:08:24.232 - 00:09:08.060, Speaker B: And these new protocols are a couple of years old. So there is, this new concept is emerging. And I think with cultural capital, it's even harder, right? Like, how do you value an audience? How do you value a TikTok? How do you value a piece of NFT art? How do you value a PFP? How do you value a meme? And so this idea of real versus unreal is very much in the eye of the beholder, because, again, we have very subjective utility functions. What could be real very useful to me, something I'm willing to spend money on, is something that another person might look at and say, absolutely not. This is why worth zero. So there is kind of this interesting belief that people outside crypto have that what they do is somehow more real. But I think, again, this is like a very subjective cognitive bias.
00:09:08.060 - 00:10:03.486, Speaker B: And one of the most important things that we need to do as an industry is help dispel some of these notions that somehow markets are more or less relevant or more or less credible just because the assets they trade in or the assets they deal with are well understood or not well understood. Again, if we look at the stock market, right, people talk about like, oh, well, I do real things. I'm like, well, look, in the last two, three years, we've had a number of companies who've gone to market who produce nothing of value, who are trading at 1500 x forward pe price to earning multiples. And you're going to sit here and tell me that bitcoin's not real? I have news for you, my friend. I have news for you, my friend. The legitimacy and credibility of something is not bounded by your capacity to understand it. Market gets created, santi, when there are people who want to buy and people who want to sell, and so there are people who want to buy and people who want to sell.
00:10:03.486 - 00:10:13.406, Speaker B: It could be something as dumb as, I don't know, what's the, what's the latest meme coin? Well, didn't someone launch a horse coin?
00:10:13.510 - 00:10:15.758, Speaker A: I mean, we're talking, I was going.
00:10:15.766 - 00:10:17.918, Speaker C: To say probably, yeah.
00:10:18.006 - 00:10:58.026, Speaker B: So again, you know, are those markets real? Well, they're very much real in the sense that there are buyers and there are sellers. There's a price at which those trades are clearing and there's real money moving around. So again, I think we have to move away from this very dated idea that markets are defined by traditional assets that we can value using formulas and standard formats. There are aspects of this that are going to take time to develop, but at the end of the day, real and unreal is highly subjective. At the end of the day, back to markets. If there's a market for it, it's an asset. It might not be an asset, you understand? It might not be an asset you value.
00:10:58.026 - 00:11:47.702, Speaker B: But if there is a market for it, if people are buying and selling it, if there is volume, if trades are clearing, that is a market. And people who are early to emerging markets or new markets or new asset classes can extract a lot of value from those markets. And so I think a lot of people who dismiss crypto, who dismiss nfts, who dismiss meme coins are missing the broader narrative. Now, does it create value for society? Also highly subjective, right? But these are, again, very difficult questions because they deal with people's individual utility functions as opposed to a societal utility function, right? Which even that is difficult to define. If we look at the state of the world today and how different countries are prioritizing how they allocate or have historically allocated resources, and the impact that has had on the global economy and on inflation, can we actually talk about.
00:11:47.718 - 00:12:17.596, Speaker A: That for the speculative impact on society? Because I think when equities, investors kind of shit on bitcoin or ETH or something like that, it's quite comical because when you look at a lot of, I mean, stocks used to be a function of the ability to vote and influence the company and cash flow, right? Like in the sense that you would get dividends from the company if you buy Facebook stock, that is a purely speculative, speculative play. You have basically no voting rights and you have no, uh, you get no dividends. Um, right.
00:12:17.620 - 00:12:27.892, Speaker B: But also face. But Facebook stock, yeah. No. Doesn't trade purely on fundamentals. Right? There is no set formula that says, okay, Facebook is going to trade at a 15 x. Um, no, I agree with you.
00:12:27.908 - 00:12:30.404, Speaker A: It's purely speculative. In my mind, it's. You don't.
00:12:30.484 - 00:12:38.764, Speaker B: We call it like animal spirits. Right? That's the, the classical articulation of it, like animal spirits. But it is all markets are speculative by their very nature.
00:12:38.884 - 00:13:17.814, Speaker A: I completely agree. I completely agree. So there used to be these baked out markets, markets around commodities and companies with equities. Right? And I guess you would argue fixed income as well. Then you got these things with, like, with derivatives, where you have these, which created a massive market on top of those. We haven't been able to bet on culture, though, in the way that people have been able to bet on equities and commodities and fixed income and things like that. What does, like, why is that exciting to you to be able to arbitrage? Because the market is just making money in the market is just some sort of arbitrage usually, so.
00:13:17.814 - 00:13:23.978, Speaker A: Or betting on something going up or betting on something going down. So, like, why, why is that exciting to you? And, like, what does that unlock?
00:13:24.146 - 00:14:02.440, Speaker B: Yeah. So I do think we have ways that we historically have arbitraged culture, right. Or invested in culture. So to use the perfect example, Facebook, when Facebook acquired Instagram, right, and Instagram became part of that platform, and Instagram started to grow as the primary platform for influencers, right? Who I liken to modern day shamans, those influencers. A good way to bet on their reach was potentially to buy meta stock, right? Another way, there's actually an influencer in Italy, the blonde salad Sharafrani, who took herself public. She created a company. She took it public.
00:14:02.440 - 00:14:51.042, Speaker B: She's one of the first influencers who has publicly traded stuff. You do this also when you buy collectibles, right? A lot of billionaires, one of the assets they love to own is a sports franchise. Why? Because there's a limited number of sports franchises in the world and they've gone up consistently in value year after year after year. So these markets for culture have existed for a very long time. And if you own pieces of culture, culture does create cash flows, which is one of the things people don't understand. It could be direct cash flows, which is what we're seeing through, like the selling of merchandise or tickets or events. There are a lot of different, like, in a way, block works, right? Like, you sell crypto culture, your channel is media, but you're effectively selling access to crypto culture and knowledge, which is a form of culture, in my view.
00:14:51.042 - 00:15:16.334, Speaker B: And then you have more indirect ways of monetizing culture, which is through clout. And the crypto community is huge on clout, because we're all on Twitter. We love dopamine, we're addicted to it. It's why we fly around the world to conferences. It's why we spend a lot of time arguing about monkey pictures on the Internet. We love clout. And so clout is an indirect way that you might monetize culture and your proximity to culture.
00:15:16.334 - 00:16:17.010, Speaker B: And so what's been really interesting to observe is we've gone through these sort of evolutions of the different ways that people monetize and capitalize culture. It started with collecting art, right? Then there were brands that started to build up ip. They also capitalized on culture. Then with the advent of the Internet, there were different companies that were facilitating cultural exchange of different types. And so of those companies captured value as people saw those platforms as a way to sort of benefit from the monetization of Internet culture, whether it's unique niche subcultures or more broader, like broad mainstream cultures. Why people invest in media companies, we see it with the growth of investing in franchises and brands themselves. And now I think what we're seeing with this idea of web3 or this new articulation of culture where people can issue tokens or PFP nfts that allow people to belong to culture in a very public way, that is the next step in the monetization of culture.
00:16:17.010 - 00:16:56.964, Speaker B: And each successive wave, I think, of technology innovation gives us new ways to monetize and make this cultural capital more tangible. Because at the end of the day, again, everything converges to market. And so what we're doing effectively is we're finding more efficient ways to monetize this cultural capital. We're at iteration like six or seven of this. There will be many more iterations of this over time. And this is why I love reading Sci-Fi you could watch Black Mirror, you could read Sci-Fi books. There are a lot of books that sort of talk about this, you know, having futures markets for your reputation, having markets for clout.
00:16:56.964 - 00:17:22.574, Speaker B: Like these are these social scores, right? These are not new concepts. They've existed for a long time. It's just now we're at a point as society where we spend enough time online. We have the tools, we have the capabilities, and most importantly, I think we have the mindset and the understanding to actually articulate what this might look like and how this might work from a functional perspective, which is scary, but also exciting. It depends on where you sit.
00:17:23.834 - 00:17:48.474, Speaker C: Totally. I guess what you're saying is there's a lot of companies going back to your example of look. Intangibles show up in the balance sheet in a very meaningful way for a lot of companies. Apple has billions of dollars of intangibles. When you acquire a company, Nike sponsors a bunch of athletes. They show up as intangibles. Now and then they trickle through the income statement because they're sponsoring LeBron James or Air Jordans have created these billions of dollars.
00:17:48.474 - 00:18:21.706, Speaker C: So I guess what you're saying is you're now able to crystallize and perhaps have better price discovery on that intangible because all of a sudden you're connecting culture to these untethered capital markets that we call crypto, where anyone can bid on, if you melt them, were to decide to do the Degen princess, you know, 10,000 PFP drops, not suggesting that you do, but if you were to do it, then, then you can have perhaps is what you're saying is you can have a price on your brand today and in real time and people can then speculate on that, on what you're doing now and in the future and.
00:18:21.890 - 00:19:33.884, Speaker B: Hundred percent, yeah. And it's sort of like isas or income sharing agreements, which were talked about a lot in crypto maybe two or three years ago. And there are companies like Fairmint and others that are attempting to bring the ISA model into start startups for founders and early employees. But I do think, again, if you're able to spot cultural movements early and if there's a way for you to invest in them and own a piece of that cultural movement, which you can do now with crypto, right. I would argue meme coins are just cultural capital, but in the most sort of degenerate format. Again, what it opens up is the ability to create new markets for this cultural capital. And at the end of the day, like this is all a very large markets story because all of a sudden you're dramatically lowering transaction costs, you're enabling more efficient price discovery, and you're enabling the formation of a very efficient capital market without the need to go out, get your contract listed at different brokerages, get traded on a bunch of different venues? There's one venue, there's one market, there's a massive pool of liquidity, and it's really easy to access.
00:19:33.884 - 00:20:23.086, Speaker B: All you need is a wallet, an Internet connection, and the ability to open up a Dex, and you have a market that's incredibly powerful. We've never been able to spin up markets so efficiently before. Right. Historically, it's been you have to create a physical market or you have to work with existing market venues or you have to create an entirely new market. If we look, for example, at collectibles, right, you have to go to stockx or one of these marketplaces to trade in these assets. But what if instead of going to Stockx and actually physically trading in the new Nike dunks, I could buy a speculative market on the Nike dunks, that's what I used to do on poly market. You could bet on prices for hot new sneaker drops.
00:20:23.086 - 00:21:15.852, Speaker B: I think it was the Nike Air Force mochas that came out maybe two years ago. I bet on what the secondary market price would be. And so I was able to trade a derivative of a culture market completely in crypto and without any sort of tethering to the physical underlying. And so again, this is really a market structure and market efficiency story. And it sounds so boring and so unsexy. Like it's really, really exciting. I get really hyped up about markets and if people ever want to get really excited about markets, there's a great book, I think it's called confessions of a ticker tape operator, that goes through like the early formation of the stock market and what it was like when people were still trading like physically on a floor, which when I started trading, I was trading over the phone, we were still doing voice brokering.
00:21:15.852 - 00:21:34.278, Speaker B: It was super fucking exciting. You'd sit there, I had two handsets talking in one, I had my BlackBerry. It was exciting, it was electric. You felt a lot. If you had to do deals on face to face over the phone, you'd be screaming at people. It was really fun. I highly recommend that book.
00:21:34.278 - 00:21:47.234, Speaker B: I promise it will get you really excited about markets. Or like if you're a nerd and you like watching Wall street and sort of these old school 1980s, 1990s finance movies, like, it's cool, it's really cool, it's really fun.
00:21:47.854 - 00:22:19.200, Speaker C: Yeah. I want to get your take on utility because it's something that is, either it's the projects that emphasize or need that they need, or they feel that they should always promise a lot of utility. Do we need to have utility? Because clearly when you're betting, I mean betting has been around for centuries, people like to do it. It's fun. People go to casinos, they do derivatives, whatever. But I'm curious to get your thoughts on that because it's a common criticism of nfTs, of crypto. It's like what's actually, and you mentioned this earlier, what's the value that's being created?
00:22:19.372 - 00:23:05.652, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think utility is one of these words. Utility and community are two of my least favorite words because they get thrown around haphazardly and they mean objectively nothing. Because utility is highly subjective. Right? So if we look at an NFT, this is why. Also, by the way, the only NFT communities I've been really active in are etherocks, zero utility, no roadmap just culture, crypto dickbuts, no utility, no roadmap, just pure culture. That's it. I think the issue with utility is, what is the utility of owning a PFP JPeG? What is the utility of owning an art blocks piece of art? The utility is me flexing.
00:23:05.652 - 00:23:39.694, Speaker B: The utility is me belonging to a community. Utility is me making a statement about who I am. It's like, why do people buy rolexes? Why do people buy mercedes? Why do people buy Birkin bags? My Birkin bag doesn't have a utility. It's a handbag. Right? I could buy one for $5. I could buy one for $50,000. It doesn't change the objective function of that item, but what it changes is my cultural capital and how I believe I'm perceived and how I present myself to the world.
00:23:39.694 - 00:24:31.002, Speaker B: So I think a lot of these projects that are getting caught up in utility, like building metaverses or allowing you to own your IP, like, there's a great debate the other day, say I own a board ape, and I have the IP rights to my ape, and I get my ape printed on a hoodie. What value does that hoodie have to anyone other than me? $0, right? I'm not going to be able to auction off a hoodie with a picture of an ape on it for hundreds or hundreds of thousands of dollars. So I think we have gotten into this trap of like, oh, we need utility. What's the utility? And it's like, no, that's the wrong question. The real question you should be asking is what if the, what is the persistent cultural value of this meme or of this art or of this idea that I'm a part of? Right? For me, crypto dick butts are very simple. It's a Dick. It's a.
00:24:31.002 - 00:24:38.378, Speaker B: But they're cute, they're funny. Dicks and butts will always be funny. We're all five year olds at heart. And so, like, it will always be unfair.
00:24:38.466 - 00:24:43.016, Speaker A: Santia's trying so hard to hold back the laugh and the smile right now. He's trying to listen.
00:24:43.120 - 00:24:52.800, Speaker C: I, you know, I collect very little, very few nfts, other than punks. I do have, I do have a bag of crypto dick butts. I haven't sold it publicly, but.
00:24:52.992 - 00:24:53.724, Speaker B: Wow.
00:24:54.864 - 00:24:58.964, Speaker A: 1D equals one B. Santi. There we go. I didn't, I didn't realize you knew math.
00:24:59.824 - 00:25:19.714, Speaker B: Yeah, universal math. Yeah. Yeah. And, and so this is, this, to me, is what's so interesting, because all of this utility, I think the only thing it does is it creates expectations that actually lower the value of these projects. Right. And punks are another great example, Santi. Like, the only value of a punk is pure flex.
00:25:19.714 - 00:25:23.594, Speaker B: Like, you are a tasteful motherfucker.
00:25:23.974 - 00:25:43.668, Speaker C: Oh, why, thank you. No, I mean, I do agree with you. It's sort of like collecting Pokemon cards. And, I mean, humans always want to differentiate. Now, you can do in a digital context with an immutable trace in a settlement layer that you have certainty of it. Go try buying a watch in the secondary market. How do you know it's authentic? It's a pain in the ass.
00:25:43.836 - 00:26:19.904, Speaker B: Yeah, but this is also, I think, one of the things that will start to matter is the provenance of your NFT. So. Right, like, in five years from now, when you are the next Warren buffet and everyone's like, oh, my God. So NFT people will want to own your punk. Your punk will have more value because it was owned by you. Similarly, one of the things I'm really excited about with crypto dick butts is creating canonical, like, globalized lore around crypto dick butts, which I've been doing as our quote unquote hype priestess, which has been really fun, but then also creating individualized lore around your dick. But there's a really cool company called hype that allows you to create lore, nfts that you can attach to your NFT.
00:26:19.904 - 00:26:51.054, Speaker B: And so if people start to write stories about, like, the personality of their dick, but story of their dick, but their traits, then there are dick butts that have really cool stories that could potentially have much more value than other dick butts simply because of this cultural cachet. And so these markets, yes, they're a bit strange. They don't immediately make sense. But I think if you live in the world of the Internet and you understand how Internet culture works, like, I grew up on four chan and something awful, this makes total sense to me.
00:26:54.154 - 00:27:28.594, Speaker A: Do NFTs expand beyond, like, I think for anyone who's in crypto in 2017, they remember that, like, nfts for, you know, like, all tickets, event tickets are going to be tokenized. And then nfts got big, and everyone's like, oh, see, this is the solution. It's going to be, you know, all these, all these event tickets are going to turn into nfts. And, like, when you hear those kind of ideas, do you kind of laugh and, like, reminisce on the 2017 markets? Do you, are you like, oh, yeah, that is the future, or do, like, are nfts just deeply efficient markets? Or hopefully soon to be deeply efficient markets around culture.
00:27:29.774 - 00:28:18.556, Speaker B: Okay, so that's a complicated question. I think nfts. So one of the things. So just talking briefly about the technical distinction between a fungible token like an ERC 20 and a non fungible token like an ERC 721, I think one of the challenges with nfts and a lot of illiquid asset classes that are non uniform, right? Like collectibles, like art, like wine, like real estate date, is the money ness function. So an ERC 20 token, because these assets are fungible, interchangeable for one another, they take on this property of moneyness, meaning they can be used as a store of value, although arguably no cryptocurrency has achieved store value quite yet. But primarily they can be used as means of exchange. The challenge with ERC 721s is because they're non uniform, they don't have the same property of moneyness.
00:28:18.556 - 00:29:00.832, Speaker B: They can't be used as medium of exchange or unit of account, because nfts have a wide price range. Real estate has a wide price range. So that's really the fundamental distinction, is this property of moneyness? So the challenge comes in for me. I think when you look at the nature of how you like, value this money ness, or just do price discovery, generally something like concert tickets, or even a uniswap lp position, that's an NFT. You're utilizing this property of uniqueness to basically put assets that are different on chain. Now people are doing with peer to peer loans, which I think is pretty cool. Like, each loan becomes its own unique asset that then can trade in the secondary market.
00:29:00.832 - 00:29:35.278, Speaker B: Great. But these things are not imbued with cultural capital. These things are just different ways to represent existing financial assets. So I think there's a fundamental distinction between utilizing an ERC 721 to bring efficiency to a item, right, that already has sort of a defined value. Like a concert ticket has an x three, right. It's kind of like a long dated call option where it increases in price as you get closer to the maturity date, and as of the maturity date, it expires worthless. Because the concert tickets exercise.
00:29:35.278 - 00:30:22.334, Speaker B: I don't think people are going to trade like concert ticket stubs, although who knows? I've been surprised by weirder shit trading in the market, so who knows? But I think one of the fundamental distinctions you have to make is like, what are we trying to accomplish? And so leveraging the ERC 721 format to enable something to trade more efficiently is very different from actually creating a new type of asset and capturing esoteric value in a tangible way, if that makes sense. And that's like a very granular and very subjective distinction. I probably did not articulate that well, but to me it's very different. There's like a very big difference between owning a concert ticket or owning box tickets to a Mets game and owning a crypto. Dick butt. Very different things.
00:30:23.354 - 00:30:56.336, Speaker A: All right, everyone, time for a quick word from Circle and USCC. As a crypto user, you know the power of stablecoins, dollar digital currencies that transcend borders, banking hours and legacy financial rails well. Circle's USDC has quickly become one of the most trusted and widely used stable coins. It's simple. People use USDC because of its composability, its stability and its reserve transparency. And USDC isn't just adopted by a few of us. Defi degens and DAos and NFT marketplaces, crypto companies alike.
00:30:56.336 - 00:31:30.046, Speaker A: They all leverage USDC to diversify their treasury, asset management and ecosystem wide composability. The adoption is clear. USDC has grown to more than $50 billion in circulation since launching in 2018. We all have, and we all will continue to take shots on our favorite volatile crypto assets, obviously. But USDC is one of the easiest ways to store your funds in a stable asset that can be used to send value around the world almost instantly. It lowers the cost of cross border payments. It integrates into the growing ecosystem of crypto apps.
00:31:30.046 - 00:32:00.482, Speaker A: As a seamless, trusted dollar digital currency, USDC is a zero to one opportunity for the financial system. If you want to learn more about USDC, I would recommend you check out their recently published transparency hub on Circle.com dot. It's a great update to Circle's content on USDC. It outlines everything from links to their weekly reserve reports, monthly attestations, blog posts that are written by their exec team that highlight how and why USDC was built the way it is. Really recommend it, just go to circle.com transparency.
00:32:00.482 - 00:32:03.574, Speaker A: Access it. Now. Let's get back to the show.
00:32:05.394 - 00:32:18.146, Speaker C: Where do you other than perhaps, I mean, I guess, like specific to culture, what are you most excited about these days? Other than perhaps just pure NFT drops or maybe a project here or there that you're.
00:32:18.290 - 00:32:44.884, Speaker B: I'm not that excited about nfts, to be honest. I think most NFT communities have zero substance because precisely for this reason, like people expect utility. And I think one of the challenges for NFT communities and NFT projects that raise a lot of money, it's like, okay, you did your initial sale, you made a bunch of money. You sell a derivative, you make more money. You sell merch, you make more money. You sell tickets to an event, you make more money. But you're constantly monetizing the same community.
00:32:44.884 - 00:33:01.234, Speaker B: I think one of the really important things about great ip is when Disney bought Marvel, right? They bought a universe of 5000 characters. And I would argue that Stan Lee, who created sort of the. Stan Lee created Marvel, right?
00:33:01.774 - 00:33:02.998, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
00:33:03.046 - 00:33:29.266, Speaker B: Yeah. He created the Marvel Universe. Like, he's the original mastermind behind that. I like DC is the lesser metaverse, in my view. Like, this is a metaverse. It's an alternate universe. Brilliant, right? All of these characters, all of this lore, all of these stories, when Disney bought that Ip, they were able to monetize it in a variety of different ways, far beyond the core audience of people who would buy Marvel comic books, right? So they created movies.
00:33:29.266 - 00:33:49.410, Speaker B: The movies had spinoffs. They created merchandise. Like, now they're selling out movie theaters. The most popular genre of movies over the last few years has been superhero movies. Sorry, I'm losing my Airpods. Superhero movies, right? They sell costumes, they sell swag, they have merch lines. You go to theme park, and you can have a whole Marvel section of the theme park.
00:33:49.410 - 00:35:00.808, Speaker B: So a brand like Marvel is incredibly valuable because you can take that intellectual property and it's broadly extensible, and you can sell it in a variety of different ways and monetize it in a variety of different ways. The challenge to me with nfTs, and particularly a lot of these, like, 10,000 animal derivative collection pfps, is how do you build these concentric, growing circles of monetization at different price points around these nfTs? Number one, the NFT is largely inaccessible, right? An NFT that costs $5,000 or one ETH even, right, which right now is what, $1,300? That, to people in crypto, seems okay, but, like, the average person doesn't have $13 lying around to buy access to culture, right? They have maybe like $13 lying around, although in the new economic climate, maybe that's like closer to $5. So the ability for these products. So you have this community of 10,000 holders who are the insiders. How do you spread that culture? And how do you monetize the spread of that culture outside of that initial core group? And that's what I'm not seeing yet. And people are like, oh, we're going to make a show. Oh, we're going to do this.
00:35:00.808 - 00:35:18.914, Speaker B: We're going to make a restaurant. We're going to make a theme park. And I'm like, great, I don't want to go to an ape themed theme park. I don't want to go to a doodles theme theme park because the culture is not relevant. To me. It's a very niche subculture for a very specific group of people, and it's simply too small. Right.
00:35:18.914 - 00:36:04.134, Speaker B: So what we're really counting on is the ability for these communities and these projects to grow their cultural cache and their cultural relevance. But the way that they're doing it is completely inaccessible to broader audience. And so to me, I'm just very skeptical of like how you take something that's as niche and esoteric as a PFP collection and turn it into a rich universe. To me, it kind of starts with the inverse, which is why I've really focused on lore and storytelling with crypto dickbuts is you typically start with a great story and great characters and you work in the other direction. You don't start with characters and then say, okay, we're going to try to build culture and a story around these characters. It's generally not done that way. So I don't know how it's going to shake out.
00:36:04.134 - 00:36:31.632, Speaker B: But I would say these early iterations, a lot of these projects will pivot into trying to provide infrastructure for other IP plays. But at the end of the day, as an IP asset, as an intellectual property asset, or as a subculture that can be monetized through these ever growing concentric circles at lower price points that reach more and more people and larger and larger audiences. I don't think I've seen any projects in this space that have had the ability to translate beyond these very small niche subgroups.
00:36:31.768 - 00:36:57.896, Speaker C: There's a lot there that I want to unpack and I guess the common umbrella there is IP. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on. On how you. We've seen various iterations like Creative Commons, and then others that are more guarded and then others that have transitioned, like yuga labs and punks. I'm curious what you think of IP, if that really matters when it comes to culture and encapsulating that, like us in this world. I'm just curious to get your general thoughts on IP.
00:36:58.080 - 00:37:53.088, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not a lawyer, so I'll preface anything I say, like, I'm not the expert on this. I think Galaxy wrote a great research piece on the different licensing models for intellectual property related to NFTs. I find IP law so incredibly boring, but it's one of the things that makes America, like, the preferred place to operate a business is we have really strong rights, property rights. We have really strong intellectual property rights. We have a court system that has demonstrated its willingness to defend and uphold those property rights and intellectual property rights. That being said, when I say the word that the term IP is probably a little bit of a misnomer. The IP in this instance is like, what is the unique asset? What is the unique thing these communities have? Right? And to me, it's in order for something to become culturally relevant.
00:37:53.088 - 00:38:35.948, Speaker B: Memes are really important for the transmission of cultural ideas. And I think one of the challenges with IP rights, we saw this with Kevin Rose and Moonbirds when people started creating moonbird derivatives, and he was like, I'm going to sue the shit out of you. And he got a bunch of the Moonbird derivatives delisted. I actually think that made moonbirds less valuable because memes and imitation is what makes the original more valuable. Why do people flex? Rolex is so hard? It's because everyone wants one, but very few people can get them. So the imitators are actually making your item more valuable. It's like you have Gucci and you have Yucci or Gucci.
00:38:35.948 - 00:39:30.430, Speaker B: So I think there is sort of this question of, okay, how do you actually make this culturally relevant and culturally valuable? And I think it's really difficult to do that if people can't replicate it and create memes around it and extend the meme. And today, the most popular method for transmitting memes on crypto Twitter, right, is viral meme tweets. So if I can't viral meme tweet, if it's not easy to make funny memes out of what you're doing, like, how do you make that scale? Right. How do I transport my NFT into popular culture? Like mimetic transmission. I need to create memetic desire in people, whether that's through humor, serious cult identity. I think Moonpay did brilliant job giving a bunch of celebrities bored apes cause it made them more desirable. And then other people started buying them cause they wanted to be relevant.
00:39:30.430 - 00:39:45.010, Speaker B: But it's like, okay, now that you've given, you could give every celebrity in the world a board ape. What do you do next? How do you scale to a million people? 10 million people? A billion people, yeah, exactly.
00:39:45.082 - 00:40:14.152, Speaker C: And that's where I was going more with Ip, not so much like the different type of licenses, but more like striking that balance between having the community really bought in and feeling like they're a part of it, versus being really guarded and monetizing it. Like, I came around this company that's trying to, like, create, like, it's called story Dao, and they're trying to, like, kind of transform the entertainment industry by allowing, like, amateur content creators to, like, bottoms up, create, like, really good films. And I don't know.
00:40:14.328 - 00:40:14.904, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:40:14.944 - 00:40:43.864, Speaker C: Like, I'm not an entertainment person. Like, I'm not an expert on it, but I'm, like, I was cautious about, like, this idea of, like, allowing people to, like, kind of, like, okay, the community. But, like, create. Can the community create really good content? Like, that is going to be on Amazon or Netflix? Are you going to want to, like, stream? It's something that I'm, like, not really sold on yet. Like, I'm curious. I ultimately think you need to have, like, really good experts and it's fairly centralized, like, how you go about that process.
00:40:44.164 - 00:41:34.746, Speaker B: Yeah, but even the use of the word community, right. Like, communities require leadership, and the leadership has to have vision. But also for culture to spread, people need to be able to take aspects of that culture and replicate it in a relevant way within their unique sub community that they're a part of for the idea to grow. Right? Like, the way we transmit ideas, the memetic transmission of ideas is very much in a digital format. It's Internet driven. There are aspects of virality that we understand, and there are aspects of reality that we don't understand. But at the end of the day, it's really about, like, how do you make something as relevant as possible to as many different niches and sub communities and demographic segments as possible? And that's where I feel like crypto really falls on its face, because what we're doing is not accessible.
00:41:34.746 - 00:42:19.304, Speaker B: It's not relevant to a lot of people. I think nfts definitely took that, like, from tokens to nfts. Nfts opened up a much wider aperture, particularly, like, sports, entertainment media, I think are very fruitful avenues, but I think they're still inaccessible. I'm curious to see what's going to happen with Solana NFTs. I think if we look at volumes on Solana NFTs, and if we look at magic Eden volumes now competing with opensea volumes, that's interesting, because Solana nfts are at a much lower price point. Transaction fees are much lower. I think generally they're not as elite as Ethereum NFTs, which I think can make it really attractive.
00:42:19.304 - 00:42:22.092, Speaker B: And again, okay, what it goes back.
00:42:22.188 - 00:42:35.876, Speaker A: I have an idea on. I actually, I think ETH. I think there's a world. I was talking to a 19 year old, like, big TikTok influencer, and he goes. He goes, he goes, ETH nfts are boomer nfts. He goes, Solana. He's like, why would anyone.
00:42:35.876 - 00:42:53.472, Speaker A: He's like, we don't want those. Those eat, like, those ETH boomer nfts. We want Solana NFTs. And if you actually look at the. It's really hard to get, like, age. Like, almost like, web two data on crypto stuff, right? Like, age and, like, where people live and stuff. But if you look at a lot of the people trading Solana NFTs, they're the.
00:42:53.472 - 00:43:00.112, Speaker A: It's the gen Z, the TikTok crowd. It's not the maybe 30 and over, like, Instagram crowd.
00:43:00.288 - 00:43:22.908, Speaker B: Yeah. It's because people don't have $13,000, $30,000, $13,0000 lying around to, like, buy these nfts. That's what I think people in crypto don't get. It's like, that's. That's a lot of fucking money. That's a lot of money. I have precisely, like, $30 left in my wallet after I pay rent and whatever other expenses I have.
00:43:22.908 - 00:43:52.928, Speaker B: So I think, again, going back to market microstructure, just to nerd out for a moment, right. Market microstructure has really big implications for how things price. Right. Supply and demand have really big implications for how things price. This idea of an NFT collection being exclusive is a concept that was sort of pioneered with these. These early drops. But, like, why can't you have an NFT collection that has a million pieces that doesn't mint out immediately? And they're $3 each.
00:43:52.928 - 00:43:54.456, Speaker B: They're $5 each.
00:43:54.640 - 00:44:31.304, Speaker C: Yeah. Are there any, like, different pricing models? I think, like, Tyler Hobbes, the guy, he's really famous because he did, like, fidensis and a few others. Like. Like, our boss, he was experimenting with, like, like, pay now, mint later. Um, I think we've seen, like, very basic forms of, like, just purchasing nfts and, like, 10,000 seems to be, like, the number, the holy number. But to your point, it's not very accessible for mainstream adoption. Like, we should be having a mindset of abundance, not scarcity, that has historically been, like, the center of crypto, which is scarcity drives value.
00:44:31.304 - 00:44:56.304, Speaker C: I get it. But, like, if we're talking about, like, culture while culture spans billions, or do you agree with that? Or would you say, well, no. Like, Kryptos has taught us that you could be very successful and monetize and create a lot of value from these micro, micro culture communities or whatever, micro culture cosms. And that's fine. We don't need to go to billions of people. Like, not everyone affords a Birkin bag either.
00:44:56.964 - 00:44:57.372, Speaker B: Right?
00:44:57.428 - 00:45:00.036, Speaker C: That's fine. That's what makes a birken bag, a birken bag, right?
00:45:00.060 - 00:45:46.982, Speaker B: But then target creates like a knockoff Kelly bag. So for $30, you can feel like you own that bag or you can feel like you have access to that style. Right? So again, what I think, I do think one of the things that crypto enables, it enables very niche sub communities to congregate and create and capitalize on cultural value, right? And a great example of that is what are the malady makers, right? These are like very niche, they are specific to very niche Internet subculture, whether good or bad. That's a different argument. But they're an offshoot of a very specific Internet subculture. And they've been able to monetize that. Where they go from here, I don't know.
00:45:46.982 - 00:46:18.570, Speaker B: But yes, you can monetize that initial very small subculture. And yes, it could be profitable, but where the money actually is in all of this is in the market. Owning the market infrastructure, owning the interchange, owning the lending, owning the financialization, in my view, is where the opportunity lies. That's what I'm investing in. That's what I want to monetize. I buy nfts for fun. For me, it's a helpful way to understand and contextualize what's happening.
00:46:18.570 - 00:46:53.714, Speaker B: And in crypto, you learn by doing so, I do these things. I try to create cults around nfts because that's how I learn about culture and communities and just the different ways that you make something a meme. But really where the value is, is in the underlying market infrastructure. And so that's why I wrote this blog post on market microstructure for nfts, because I'm like, yo, everyone's so obsessed with doing these NFT drops. Everyone's so obsessed with finding the next big IP play. I'm not an IP investor. I don't know shit about intellectual property.
00:46:53.714 - 00:47:23.584, Speaker B: I know very little. What I understand is markets. The most profitable businesses in the world operate in interchange. They run markets, marketplaces and underlying market infrastructure. So what I want to own is not the nfts, although like those are for fun, those, you know, according to what I find valuable and I find interesting, are definitely fun and have a lot of personal value for me. But as an investor. What I want exposure to is the market microstructure.
00:47:23.584 - 00:47:53.558, Speaker B: That isn't just for PFP NFTs or art NFTs, but is for utility NFTs, game NFTs, whatever we want to represent as an NFT. I want to own the underlying market structure. I want to own the price discovery mechanisms. I want to own the venues where these things trade. I want to own the order books, I want to own the margining, I want to own the clearing. I want to own the financing side, and I want to own the settlement infrastructure. I want to own the post trade reconciliation systems that people are using to integrate the accounting into their books.
00:47:53.558 - 00:48:26.188, Speaker B: That is a business that I will invest in 100 times a day, all day. That is what consistently makes money. Bull Bear doesn't matter, the asset doesn't matter. Doesn't fucking matter what you trade. The marketplace makes money on interchange. When orders match and orders clear, we are making money. I think again, when you frame it from the lens of a venture investor, I just get very confused by venture investors who are buying specific game IP or specific NFT IP.
00:48:26.188 - 00:48:47.376, Speaker B: And maybe I'm dumb. That's very possible. Or maybe I just don't get it, which is happens all the time. There are a lot of things I don't understand and probably will never understand. But what I understand and what I think always makes money. You look at human history, the marketplace. And so that's why I think, like, more entrepreneurs need to focus on market microstructure and building market structure.
00:48:47.376 - 00:49:03.656, Speaker B: And I do think a lot of these NFT projects that raise tens, hundreds of millions of dollars will very quickly figure out, like the infrastructure we're building to support our quote unquote community and provide them with quote unquote utility. That's actually where the opportunity is to create persistent cash flow.
00:49:03.800 - 00:49:35.556, Speaker C: I was gonna say, where do you see the most amount of opportunities? Obviously, you have things like Opensea. It seems to me like those fees are trending towards zero, as you've seen in binance and other exchanges. One, what are the things of the stack that need to be built, particularly about nfts? And you're an investor number, and I sort of share your same view. It's easier to bet on infrastructure than it is on a specific PFP. But what are the things that have been built that you think are not working that well and things that you're investing in or actively looking to invest in in this kind of piece of the market stack, if you will?
00:49:35.700 - 00:50:32.586, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the really cool things we're seeing is on the front end, on the exchange side, a lot of NFT projects are building their own marketplaces. I think bored apes are going to build their own front end marketplace. Punks already have their own marketplace, right? Etherox have their own marketplace slash interface. They can only trade on the original website. But I think there is this trend of instead of having these sort of horizontal marketplaces that aggregate a bunch of stuff, having more verticalized infrastructure stacks that are specific to specific nfts. Because again, if these things are just protocols, there's nothing that prevents me from just creating a front end to access protocol and then branding it with my ip and making it the sort of place where people can come to consume this entire market stack. So I do think there's an increasing trend of people shifting away from marketplaces to embedding marketplaces directly into their ip, into their community, into their own ecosystem.
00:50:32.586 - 00:51:18.342, Speaker B: Ecosystem. So this is sort of this interesting trust, this interesting challenge of horizontal plays versus vertical plays. I do think one of the really cool things about blockchains, it's much easier to sort of vertically integrate the stack because you have these composable building blocks, right. So I think there's a lot of opportunity around protocols that aggregate on the front end. So price discovery and execution across sort of all of these global NFT projects. I think I was personally really excited about Solana wormhole, the idea that we use Solana as potentially the execution layer for all this NFT trading and then use Ethereum as the settlement layer or wherever the NFT is issued as the settlement layer, because you can do execution theoretically and anywhere. But I do think price discovery is a huge opportunity.
00:51:18.342 - 00:51:42.138, Speaker B: Trade execution is a huge opportunity. So how do you enable people to basically just build a front end onto global liquidity protocol for nfts? That's super exciting. Nobody's tapped into that yet. And theoretically, if all of these are sort of compatible assets, you should be able to integrate them into sort of one interface. Uniswap acquiring, did they acquire Gem or Genie?
00:51:42.306 - 00:51:45.082, Speaker A: I always get this mixed up. Genie. Genie.
00:51:45.138 - 00:51:46.922, Speaker C: I think they acquired Genie.
00:51:47.058 - 00:51:47.466, Speaker B: Yes.
00:51:47.530 - 00:51:53.868, Speaker C: And OpenSea acquired, the history of that was. So I'm an investor in blur. So it's sort of a competing thing, but.
00:51:53.916 - 00:52:41.998, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but like, I think it's really interesting that the leading Dex acquired an aggregator and the leading NFT marketplace acquired an aggregator. Why? Because they're realizing like this moat they have doesn't exist long term because market microstructure is highly mutable in crypto and highly mutable Dex has proven that, like, I have zero loyalty to Uniswap world, one inch or any sort of Dex aggregator. It's where can I get the best price execution, best price, where it's the most liquidity, right? It's like if the best liquidity is on one inch, I'm gonna go to one inch. The best liquidity is on uniswap. I'm gonna go to uniswap. NFT is same thing, right? You see already these price dislocations between looks where x two, y two and opensea. So I'm gonna go to the market that has the best pricing.
00:52:41.998 - 00:53:36.296, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot of opportunities on the aggregation side and on the liquidity side, I think on the margin side, we're still in the very early innings of lending primitives and margin as applied to nfTs. I also think this idea that NFTs are not fungible, starting to get challenged. Like if it's not a grail, it's a floor, right? And so I do think a lot of NFTs will start to see more systematic trading strategies applied to them. There's already a couple of people I've been talking to who are working on building arbitrage driven NFT investing models. So effectively, these are like statistical arbitrage models, which by the way, that is how commodities became a huge market, that's how equities became huge markets, is through these active strategies that rely on these systemic price dislocations. Right? And so that can bring a lot of liquidity into nfts. But in order for that to be possible, you need better capital efficiency.
00:53:36.296 - 00:54:21.046, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm using a lot of like nerd finance, nerd terms. But you need to be able to get leverage on your capital, right? If I can only use the collateral I have, my return on equity. My return on capital in my book is very low. If I can borrow against it and use ten x the collateral I have, but trade it like quickly in real time, like what we saw with flash loans last summer and defi, then that all of a sudden allows me to increase my capital efficiency by multiple orders of magnitude, but it also allows me to trade a much higher volume. This is how traditional markets function. You can get like eight to nine x leverage. Traditionally crypto, not so, so easy yet, although three arrows somehow mastered it by lying in double pledging collateral.
00:54:21.046 - 00:54:57.974, Speaker B: But you know, potato, potato. And then on the settlement side, I think the settlement side is pretty well figured out. But I think there are a lot of issues around post trade reconciliation, which, like, how do we make it easier for you to figure out how to integrate nfts into like, all the accounting and bookkeeping that needs to happen? Not sexy. Super important, especially for people who want to trade nfts at scale and in size. Like, that step often is the most painful and it will preclude people from participating in these markets because your internal accounting team is going to be like, yo, fuck you, we're not doing this. It's too painful.
00:54:59.594 - 00:55:01.306, Speaker A: Yo, fuck you.
00:55:01.490 - 00:55:36.414, Speaker B: No, literally even like investing in venture, right? Coinshares public publicly listed company, trying to capture venture investments and on the balance sheet of public listed company is really painful. Imagine trying to capture nfts. You have to do mark to market pricing every quarter. It has to go through audit, right? And then you have to do like a black Scholes options pricing model to try to figure out an objective market value that takes into account a whole bunch of different factors. You can't just like type in the NFT, go to like a. I don't know, what's the leading NFT pricing tool?
00:55:37.114 - 00:55:44.734, Speaker C: Oh, if you have like upshot, you have a few others that are trying to do this. I've met like six or seven different teams.
00:55:46.514 - 00:56:04.054, Speaker B: Yeah. But we bought a, we built a bot internally, right? It's basically just a machine learning algorithm where you incorporate a bunch of different data points. It took our quant team three weeks to build it. You can tweet at our bot, I think it's called shares NFT AI. You tweet at it, it'll give you price for your NFT.
00:56:04.514 - 00:56:08.466, Speaker A: What I'm hearing from you is you need like basically the. Okay, so if you go back to.
00:56:08.490 - 00:56:13.154, Speaker B: 20, you need the whole market structure stack and it needs to all fit together well.
00:56:13.154 - 00:56:32.358, Speaker A: It feels like we just built that for the ERC 20. It's like the last five years is like, you know, everyone's trying to build derivatives. Options markets used to just be able to buy bitcoin on Coinbase. Then you could buy it and sell bitcoin on Coinbase. Then you could buy and sell bitcoin and ETH on Coinbase. Then 2017, you get all the exchanges. Then you start getting like the lend and borrow platform.
00:56:32.358 - 00:56:44.634, Speaker A: Like lend and borrow platforms. You start getting like the Genesis is of the world, the blockflies of the world. You get the Dara bits, then you start getting derivatives. Folks, today, all you have is like, to trade NFTs is opensea.
00:56:45.494 - 00:56:49.214, Speaker B: So it feels like magic Eden.
00:56:49.374 - 00:57:12.524, Speaker A: Okay? Like you have a couple of. You basically have what are the equivalent to spot exchanges from 2017? Yep, that's maybe a better way to say it. But what it sounds like what you're saying is the NFT trading market is going to get institutionalized as we get better price discovery, RFQ at scale trade execution. Like Sudo swap was working on this, which was really cool, like margin and clearing.
00:57:12.824 - 00:57:48.704, Speaker B: Yeah, pseudoswap has like some structural issues because on the pricing side, like the way prices, update on pseudoswap is problematic for like the way that prices tend to move in NFT markets. But yeah, again, like this entire market infrastructure that we've created, and I think the examples we use, by the way, are around centralized financial infrastructure. Right. Like fully custodial, centralized trading platforms. I think even on the DeFi side, like we don't even have a peer to peer lending order book yet. Yeah, lending in, in DeFi is done through lending pools, which in five years I think will be a relic of the past because it's completely nonsensical.
00:57:49.404 - 00:58:08.108, Speaker A: Let me ask the real middle of the bell curve question then, which is, okay, 1st 45 minutes of this conversation all about culture. NFTs are betting on culture. And okay, we're building these like, I'd call them like NFT pro markets or like institutional NFT markets. Funds will finally be able to come in in size. You're not just like sweeping a floor on Genie anymore.
00:58:08.196 - 00:58:15.180, Speaker B: Yeah, we're building vertically integrated NFT markets that enable professional traders to participate.
00:58:15.292 - 00:58:21.780, Speaker A: Okay, so professional traders come into this market for the first time. Does that kill the culture side of things? And again, I'm sure that's a real middle of the bell curve question there.
00:58:21.852 - 00:58:32.748, Speaker B: No. Okay, here, okay, here's, this is the crazy part. Okay. This is either like, this is very left of the bell curve, I think, or maybe right of the bell curve or maybe.
00:58:32.796 - 00:58:34.372, Speaker A: But it ain't, but ain't in the middle.
00:58:34.428 - 00:58:36.584, Speaker B: No, we try to not do mid.
00:58:37.164 - 00:58:41.262, Speaker C: Nothing is ever in the middle when it comes with DJ and princess.
00:58:41.428 - 00:58:52.134, Speaker B: No, we don't do middle. I only do extremely, extremely left of the bell curve or very far right hopefully. We try not to do middling.
00:58:52.434 - 00:58:55.674, Speaker A: When you find yourself in the middle, you always go left. That's always the move.
00:58:55.714 - 00:59:03.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Turn left. Sharp, turn left. I try not to middle. I have found middling greatly reduces my joy in life and it's also not profitable.
00:59:05.074 - 00:59:05.934, Speaker A: Good call.
00:59:06.954 - 00:59:43.662, Speaker B: Okay, here's what's really cool. So one of the really interesting things is we believe culture is kind of the submergent property, but it's not culture is created. Culture is created by people who create the content. It's created by people who monetize the content is created by people who own the algorithms that enable you to discover content. Like this idea that culture is somehow an emergent property is bullshit in many ways. There are emergent cultural movements from time to time. But the process of creating culture is very well studied.
00:59:43.662 - 01:00:12.650, Speaker B: It's very influenced by psychology. There's a great book called the Alchemy. It's called alchemy, I think. And it's about like, how to market products basically in a culture driven way. Culture creation is a science. Also, by the way, financial firms do this, like, what makes the stock hot versus not hot? Where this. There's whole cottage industry that's now become a very professionalized industry of professional stock pickers, financial media, fintwit, finfluencers.
01:00:12.650 - 01:01:01.056, Speaker B: Now there's these, these communities that have done that at scale, like Wall street bets was sort of one cultural articulation of that. But there is a whole industry in every sort of vertical you look at, right, whether it's equities, whether it's art, whether it's nfts, whether it's tokens. There is a whole industry that exists around culture creation, right? And creation of trends and the manufacturing of that. So what's really cool here is we can actually start to use markets and financial capital to influence cultural capital and vice versa, right? The two are like intrinsically linked and related. It's just we're making that linkage much more explicit it now. But that has always been the case. It's just that we don't talk about it.
01:01:01.056 - 01:01:42.528, Speaker B: But that's how culture gets created. That's how influence is created. The reason you want to own a Rolex is because you're bombarded by both direct and indirect messaging and advertising that you should own one if you are a person of culture, right? The reason you want to own a crypto dick, but. And the reason both of you own crypto dick butts is because you have been led to believe both through the financial capital created by crypto dick Butts, as well as the really incredible culture created by crypto dick Butts, that 1D equals one b is a universal mathematical truth. And, you know, not owning a dick, but would basically make you middle of.
01:01:42.536 - 01:02:16.172, Speaker C: The bell curve, even though Stephen Hawkings would definitely have a dick. But based on this common principle. Last question for me, because we are, it seems like in a bear market. Well, we definitely are in a bear market in crypto. You talk about like in your last comment about Dick Butts, there is a phenomenon where if you make money on it, then you become more vested and then, you know, it's great. You know, it does add to this culture element, I think. And when things collapse and, you know, it's not fun to see the asset.
01:02:16.172 - 01:03:02.214, Speaker C: Now you have like a real time price ticker on culture. And I'm not sure that's a good thing. I'm sort of like ambivalent. I'm just neutral on this point. But when we talk about like should artists, like, we had coop talking about music nfts. And the question to him, and I'll ask you is, can this backfire on artists? Because if you all of a sudden are selling music nfts and that music nft that someone spends all of a sudden collapses in value in this market environment, are you going to lose all your fans? And should we be putting a price on culture, a real time price of degens on culture? Whereas sometimes, sometimes it's better to think that like you're Picasso, that you didn't think of anything all of a sudden accrued a lot of value, but you didn't realize that until 100 years later and that was fine.
01:03:02.514 - 01:03:46.306, Speaker B: Okay. But I think the concern you're articulating, Santi, is one that's sort of a moot point by what I said earlier, all of the things that you are culture were created by people with capital and influence. So what you're consuming that you believe is organic culture in most instances is manufactured, whether explicitly or in a more organic way. Like all culture is manufactured, all memes are manufactured. Like if you go back to the 1930s, you read Bernays propaganda, you pick up on a lot of these elements, the things that become trends, things that are cool, the things that are taste tasteful. Like there is someone somewhere profiting off of that who's directly working to influence that culture. The issue is today this happens behind closed doors.
01:03:46.306 - 01:04:59.314, Speaker B: And as a creator, it's something that you have very little access to unless you have the right relationships, unless you have the right people, the right access. And so what this does, and I think this is one of the things Coop and I have discussed a lot because I still don't understand music nfts. But I love talking to him because he's so patient and trying to explain to my very small brain how this all works. What I think is really cool about it is for the first time we're making this linkage between culture, financial capital and influence very explicit. And we're enabling people of all types to utilize these tools to create an influence culture. So what we're doing is instead of having, you know, ten culture creators, the Internet, you know, enabled us to go from having five culture creators, you know, Disney, Pixar, whatever, name your favorite cultural brand creators to having now hundreds if not thousands, if not tens and hundreds of thousands of influencers who can create an influence culture. And so you have a much broader set of opportunities and you have much more ability for creators to directly influence culture because they now have this channel to speak directly to their audience.
01:04:59.314 - 01:05:43.564, Speaker B: The next step is we are going to give the creation tools and distribution mechanisms and the market tools, by the way, directly to culture creators. And so each successive step opens up the aperture to allow more people to participate more directly and more explicitly in the creation, distribution, monetization, financialization of culture. I mean, there's still Santee. The issue is like, yes, there is always going to be ways that you can exploit that, but the question is it's better to have a thousand musicians who have a lot of money and then millions who have nothing versus a million artists who all make a living wage and can create their art, but maybe fewer super superstars.
01:05:44.064 - 01:06:08.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess what I'm hearing you say, which I think is an interesting point, I haven't thought about it that way, is that the key linchpin here is that you have perhaps capital is perhaps more accessible in this world because you have untethered capital markets and that empowers these micro creators to have a bigger say on culture and what gets pushed perhaps in a more organic way. Whereas before it was Kellogg's telling you that you had to have breakfast and.
01:06:08.272 - 01:06:13.208, Speaker B: Also, I mean organic, inorganic. I think again, is that's in the eye of the beholder. That's.
01:06:13.256 - 01:06:14.192, Speaker C: It's very subjective.
01:06:14.248 - 01:06:39.564, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So that's why it's difficult to make absolute statements on that. And I think a lot of times the people that object the most to the commodification of cultural capital, right, which is like inherently a trend of financialization, is like these things get commodified. Is this a good thing? Is this a bad thing? Well, for the gay gatekeepers, that's a bad thing. Right. Because they become less and less relevant because you no longer need their expertise. That's why I think NFTs make people so angry.
01:06:39.564 - 01:07:40.004, Speaker B: Yeah, like NFTs make people viscerally angry, just like crypto makes finance people viscerally angry. Because imagine you've spent your whole life working to get to this point where you get to gatekeep culture, and all of a sudden, there are all of these cultural movements that are getting created. There are all of these moments in fashion and art, in sports that are getting created outside of your sphere of influence. That's infuriating. Like, people hate loss of control. Change is very threatening. And so, again, you know, I think that's part of the exciting thing here, is, like, okay, we're gonna have new local points of control, but we can also enable all these, like, really niche subculture things that haven't scaled well before to actually scale and find bigger audiences, potentially, or at least be able to create more value or sponsor more creative capital to exist.
01:07:40.004 - 01:07:56.112, Speaker B: So is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? It's difficult to say. I think it depends on where you sit. If I'm a legacy brand or if I'm involved in the business of gatekeeping, then it's a bad thing. If I'm a consumer. Right. Unsure. Um, and if I'm a creator, I think it's a good thing.
01:07:56.112 - 01:08:11.880, Speaker B: I think it just really depends on where you sit. Again, that's why I go back to markets. I'm just a girl who wants to trade cultural capital in size. So, yeah, I don't need it. If I. If I can. If I can trade it, I'm into it.
01:08:11.880 - 01:08:36.734, Speaker B: So, again, there. And that's, by the way, that's what people in the world of finance do, right? Like, I don't care if it's apple or if it's Tesla or whatever. I'm not trading. I'm not emotional about trading my book. And again, as cultural capital grows, you're going to see the presence of more and more arbitrageurs who are not emotional about the cultural capital they trade. They just trade based on trends. Anyways, hopefully, that makes sense.
01:08:36.734 - 01:08:45.497, Speaker B: I always feel like such a loser talking about these things, because I think they're really exciting. People are like, this is not exciting at all. But I think it's super cool.
01:08:45.585 - 01:08:49.057, Speaker A: I think it's great. Meltam, giddy up. As you said in your post, I think it's gonna be.
01:08:49.145 - 01:09:35.837, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, but, like, look, this is, again, read Sci-Fi I have a website melting Sci-Fi reading list on it. Really good shit on there. Sci-Fi is, like, such a great. I don't read nonfiction anymore, because, honestly, most nonfiction books are just, like, blog posts with 300 pages added to sell books. Like, just make it a blog post. But science fiction is great because I think Sci-Fi writing has always been a way for us to articulate our hopes and fears as a society. So a lot of Sci-Fi books are sort of a forward look at what might happen if we extrapolate technological trends, societal trends, cultural trends forward 1020, 5100, a thousand years.
01:09:35.837 - 01:09:52.173, Speaker B: Or set them in different universes with different rules, different cultures. So I think it's actually a really interesting way to lens through which to view what we're doing. And a lot of what we're doing now has been written about by various Sci-Fi authors over the last five or six decades.
01:09:52.293 - 01:10:00.517, Speaker A: Any favorite Sci-Fi books? I guess you have that list. But any one book that folks should read, maybe outside of the obvious, like the snow crash or like the. Yeah, yeah.
01:10:00.565 - 01:10:08.460, Speaker B: I don't even think snow crash. Is that, like, great of a book? Hyperion cantos by Dan Simmons. Incredible, incredible book.
01:10:08.612 - 01:10:10.184, Speaker A: All right. Yeah.
01:10:10.604 - 01:10:37.926, Speaker B: It's like a derivative of Keats's Canterbury tales, but it's a really cool book about basically sentient AI that's modeled after Keats, the poet. And it's in this universe that's controlled by this AI, but nobody recognizes it. And there's this robot that comes from the future called the shrike. That super cool book. Read it. It's really weird. The other one that's amazing is the quantum thief by Hani Renshaw.
01:10:37.926 - 01:10:47.934, Speaker B: Me, I think that's how I say it. Yeah. Very, very good book as well. The question is, what if time was an asset that you could trade?
01:10:49.034 - 01:10:50.066, Speaker A: That's interesting.
01:10:50.210 - 01:10:58.074, Speaker B: Very cool concept. We're going to have to bend the laws of physics for that one. But anything is possible if we dream it.
01:10:58.154 - 01:11:06.774, Speaker A: You are a nerd in the finest sense of the word. And I love that you're betting on culture. Thank you for teaching Santumi how to do it. This has been an awesome chat.
01:11:06.934 - 01:11:25.314, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. And if anyone has any questions, DM's are open. I'm always happy to talk shit. And obviously tell me what I am getting wrong because there are a lot of things I don't understand. I'm just a simple woman who wants to trade culture in the side.
01:11:26.774 - 01:11:37.324, Speaker C: Princess at heart. And the best one out there. There, guys. So go follow Melton High priests. It's pure entertainment and high quality content. Thanks, guys. Melton, thanks for coming on.
01:11:37.324 - 01:11:39.384, Speaker C: We're going to have to have you on soon.
01:11:39.544 - 01:11:41.872, Speaker B: Yeah, you too. Men of culture, all three of us.
01:11:41.888 - 01:11:44.844, Speaker A: Own crypto dick butts trying to do what we can.
01:11:45.664 - 01:11:49.280, Speaker B: People of culture, amazing.
01:11:49.312 - 01:11:50.264, Speaker A: Thanks for being on the other side.
