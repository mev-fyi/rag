00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.670, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token. Are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards, or just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token.
00:00:12.702 - 00:00:13.782, Speaker B: Events for your team.
00:00:13.878 - 00:00:22.394, Speaker A: From easy to use token grant award templates through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings, make it simple today with Toku.
00:00:25.134 - 00:00:36.150, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have Lee from variant joining us once again. Been on the show again. Then we've Ben Levin from Blackbird, first time guest here. Ben and Lee, welcome to the show.
00:00:36.342 - 00:00:37.114, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:00:37.454 - 00:00:38.918, Speaker D: Thanks so much for having us.
00:00:39.046 - 00:00:55.478, Speaker B: Yeah, Ben is funny. So I was talking to my wife this morning and I was like, yeah, but this guy, Ben Leventhal is coming on the pod and he started rezzy and eater. And she's like, can he get us a reservation at Teresi? So I'm wondering, my first question to you is how many times does that happen to you?
00:00:55.646 - 00:01:03.914, Speaker C: Yeah, quite a lot. I mean, one way to think about my career is I've just been optimizing for access to the best restaurants the whole way through.
00:01:04.214 - 00:01:45.794, Speaker B: Sounds pretty fun. That sounds great. Well, guys, I think the best place to start here is actually not with Blackbird. So Ben, for folks who don't know, started both Resi and Eater and has now recently raised, I think it was, 24 million from some folks, including Lee and variant, to go build Blackbird to go help the restaurant industry move forward. But before getting into that, I'd love to just hear both of your takes on what has happened in consumer, not even consumer crypto, but just consumer the last several years. Because when I think about investing and what venture has allocated to b two B SaaS, b two b SaaS all the way through. And now it's starting to be AI.
00:01:45.794 - 00:02:00.224, Speaker B: Lee, you've been investing in consumer for a while, I think since 2015 or 2016. I'd love to. It feels like to me as this outsider, that nothing really that interesting has actually happened in consumer. But I'd love to get your take on what the last several years of consumer have really looked like.
00:02:01.524 - 00:02:55.844, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah. I think one pretty prevalent point of view is that consumer software at least has kind of reached the end of the road. Like kind of the end of civilization, if you know that book, or the end of civilization for consumer software startups, because we have a convergence of different factors. Like a, we have all the scaled network effects companies that have reached world scale and so they have the most powerful network effects that you could have by including basically the entire world's population on those platforms. And so it's really difficult for startups to be able to compete if they're building a new network. And secondly, I think the other factor is that we also haven't gotten a new computing platform or a new medium in some time.
00:02:55.844 - 00:04:11.364, Speaker D: And so you could sort of trace the history of consumer startup innovation and map it against different computing platforms, from the Internet to then high speed Internet on desktop to then mobile to then broadband mobile. And each of them corresponds to a different set of new startups that were able to be successful against the incumbents. And that new platform shift just hasn't happened for a while. And for a time being, these new platform shifts happen in quick succession and sort of trained us to think, oh, there's new opportunities for startups all the time because for the past probably 20 years or so, there were until now, we've reached the end of the road, so to speak. Yeah. And so I think consumer is, yeah, potentially in this kind of like stasis where if you look back and think about what are all the major consumer companies that we've gotten in the last decade since like 2013, you would be hard pressed to like, think of any pure software businesses that rely on network effects. I think Snap was really the last one, Snapchat.
00:04:11.364 - 00:05:10.830, Speaker D: And then we got TikTok, obviously, but TikTok is kind of an aberration where it was already sort of in existence in China, and they poured a billion dollars, literally a billion dollars into user acquisition in the US to jumpstart that network. And that's something that a startup just can't replicate. So, yeah, on the pure consumer software side, a lot of people would say, like, there's just no innovation left, like it's all incremental. Like everything that we're seeing is really incremental. And I would posit, and I think the reason why Ben and I are in crypto is because we think crypto is actually the new computing platform on which you could build new innovations that incumbents can't just co opt or can't graft onto their existing networks. And I think crypto, we could talk about all of the new possibilities that it offers for consumer builders and for consumer applications. But yeah, I think that's where we are.
00:05:10.830 - 00:05:29.474, Speaker D: We've gotten a lot of new feature innovation in the past few years in consumer software. We've gotten new features like live audio and new ways to connect with friends, but we haven't really, we haven't seen that feature innovation play out and actually create massive standalone businesses that have been successful.
00:05:31.254 - 00:05:58.054, Speaker E: So why don't we go there, Ben or Lee, if you want to talk about how crypto unlocks new possibilities, and the skeptic listener might say, well, you know, consumer is really rooted on kind of very primitive, kind of psychological kind of needs and behaviors. And, you know, why is crypto all of a sudden going to change that fundamental route, if you will? But yeah, I'm curious to get both of your perspective on this new unlock, if you will.
00:06:00.234 - 00:06:49.494, Speaker D: I'm happy to take a stab. And then, yeah, Ben, feel free to chime in. So I think like the fundamental new thing that we think crypto offers is ownership, is user ownership in the digital realm. You know, prior to crypto, you couldn't actually own things digitally. You could sort of semi own things in a platform defined way and in like a company's database, they could say like, you own some number of points or whatever items in a game, but you didn't have this kind of neutral platform that defined property rights for every user, for every asset. And so we think that's the so what of crypto. And our thesis as a firm at variant is that we invest in products and networks that make ownership a keystone of the user experience.
00:06:49.494 - 00:08:39.914, Speaker D: So ownership as a keystone of the user experience, what does that mean? That means products and networks where ownership manifests in different ways and transform the user experience and offer new experiences to users. From what we've seen before, the range of what that looks like can vary. On the lighter side of the spectrum, I think products like Twitter's profile picture feature where you can upload your NFT as a profile picture and use that to sort of display your identity. That's kind of lightly using ownership as an element of the product experience. But further on that spectrum of how deeply ownership can shape the user experience, you get to products like, I think you get to products like Blackbird, where your actual loyalty points your loyalty card with a certain merchant, with a restaurant is represented on chain and down the line, it could be composable potentially with other applications, with other merchants as well. And then I think an instantiation of this idea that really helps to paint the picture is like entirely new social networks that are platform less, that exist outside of the confines of any given closed platform, where the social network itself is predicated on ownership, shared ownership. So examples of this might be like FWB, where all the users, all the members are token holders of FWB or other daos or NFT communities, or tokenized communities, where the community itself doesn't just exist on one single platform, it sort of manifests in this platform less way.
00:08:39.914 - 00:09:27.834, Speaker D: And so I think that is like the furthest expression of what it means for ownership to be a keystone of the user experience. But in general zooming out, we think that's the. So what that crypto offers, and obviously the design space is super broad for translating that into an actual product. And we're really excited to see builders use ownership in a way to actually satisfy different human needs, ranging from like, delivering community and a sense of belonging through ownership to helping people earn through ownership. I think that's been the pillar that most products have relied on so far in crypto, helping people to speculate using ownership and sort of fulfill financial needs. But we think we can go far beyond that and deliver on other human needs through ownership.
00:09:28.334 - 00:09:30.358, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think.
00:09:30.406 - 00:10:58.314, Speaker C: I mean, I think that's spot on. And I think to take a half step back and chime in a little bit on the question of kind of innovation and then how that sort of ties to crypto, I think to me, one observation is that generally, you know, you see exciting moments of innovation happen, certainly in consumer, when entrepreneurs and engineers and creative people have new toys to play with. And I think one answer to why we sort of feel like maybe there hasn't been a ton of innovation is that there really haven't been that many new toys to play with. And the toys that exist are these really large scale things. The apparatus of Google is arguably a toy that Google has to play with and can drive tons of creativity and consumer innovation, but it's at the level of Google, similar dynamics at Snap, meta, Twitter, et cetera. But what I think then is exciting about crypto is it is actually a new toy, and it is something that changes how we think about a lot of things. I think ownership is for sure central to how we think about the evolution of consumer products that are powered by crypto.
00:10:58.314 - 00:12:12.374, Speaker C: I think about it as ownership. And to me and Lee and I have discussed this a little, I think ownership is a spectrum, and it's important to understand what kind of ownership we're talking about in the context of any particular consumer application in some cases, and obviously, there's real headwinds in the US around this kind of ownership. But in some cases, we're talking about sort of actual equity style ownership, which is clearly problematic in a lot of ways for the foreseeable future. Most notably, it's just not going to be allowed to happen in the US. But also ownership to me is control empowerment, the ability to drive outcomes. And so I think in that context, what's to come and what's happening now is super exciting because you are sort of seeing a whole range of products emerge now where these ideas are central to the consumer experience and they're driving tons and tons of excitement and growth and adoption. I mean, certainly how we think about that at Blackbird is around, I think, two.
00:12:12.374 - 00:12:58.734, Speaker C: Well, I'll say the biggest thing is ownership of your identity, which is arguably sort of a little bit to the side askew of the kind of ownership we're talking about. If in some, you know, we're not talking about ownership of Blackbird, but, but I do think it's even broader because we're saying at Blackbird, like when you tap in using one of our NFC chips, you're turning over information to the restaurant. That's information you own. I say this over and over again, but the idea that before Blackbird, as a consumer, you didn't own your own dining history is insanity. You can't walk into a restaurant and tell them where you've been unless you want to hand them a slip of paper. Right? So, like, clearly that's your information. It's clearly an example of ownership.
00:12:58.734 - 00:14:23.590, Speaker C: And for us, part of the Blackbird opportunity is shifting the dynamics and giving, in this case, consumers a little bit more control. And control, I think, of course, obviously, as we go on, like when we talk about ownership in so much as it being about control of outcomes, you know, as we see the ecosystem around fly developing, as we see the ecosystem around the platform overall developing, the idea that it becomes open and permissionless and that a group of restaurants can decide to come together and design their own loyalty offerings, or entire third party that we never saw coming decides to use fly as a means of attracting customers. That's incredibly exciting. I think that's the key thing. It's a new toy and that's why everyone's having so much fun with it. And the last thing I'll say, and then I'll stop talking for a second is just, I also think you're sort of seeing some of the insight around what's happening in the crypto community. I think it's actually trickling out to other parts of the ecosystem, sort of, let's, for the sake of simplicity, say the sort of web two ecosystem of technology, because you're definitely seeing some of the sort of ideas that are fundamental to a web3 philosophy showing up in non web3 contexts.
00:14:23.742 - 00:15:10.516, Speaker E: Yeah. I'm curious how you think about where the state of crypto is and why you decide to kind of come in now. A lot of times it's been a struggle. We talk about poor user experience in terms of onboarding and ease of use. I mean, the Internet had this problem too, at the beginning. So, like, you know, when you think about going and building blackbird versus maybe adding features to something like resi that already exists, you could layer on nfts, you have distribution already. Why kind of go through this exercise and particularly why now? I'm curious why you think right now is a good moment where still so many people are reluctant and don't want to go through key management or onboarding and jumping through a lot of hoops.
00:15:10.700 - 00:15:33.964, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think we know now enough about crypto to be dangerous, but it's still very, very early days, which makes it exciting. We don't have to make some of the mistakes that this very, very early pioneers made five and even ten years ago, but it's still brand new to 99% of people who interact with it. That makes it really exciting.
00:15:34.864 - 00:15:58.964, Speaker D: Yeah. I would also point out for Blackbird, what's really cool, if you try out the experience, is that there's different levels of onboarding that you can do as a user. People don't get thrown in the deep end. There's a progressive onboarding experience that they can go through that. I think probably some users don't even realize that there's crypto under the hood.
00:15:59.274 - 00:16:04.130, Speaker B: I signed up, I've got the app here. There's no crypto aspect. There's no.
00:16:04.202 - 00:16:29.362, Speaker D: Exactly. Yeah. So I think for the first time ever, and this probably just happened in the last year or so, infrastructure has gotten to the point where we can abstract things such that crypto is really just this enabling technology. It's not the reason why people are downloading an application and trying it and using it. It is. It is an enabler. But the reason they're there is something else.
00:16:29.362 - 00:16:50.814, Speaker D: It's for the restaurant, it's for their loyalty to collect these loyalty points or whatever. And I often say, like crypto in consumer crypto, crypto should be the how, it's not the why. And I think Blackbird is an example of this, and I think it's really powerful now that is newly possible for application developers.
00:16:51.464 - 00:17:41.228, Speaker B: So if I'm tying together what both of you guys are saying here, it sounds like where we're at today, 2023, the last seven years in consumer, there wasn't really too much that happened because we had reached this apex of the network effects and all these big social platforms already had billions of users, and it was really tough to compete against them. They already were almost maxed out their network effects. It was very, very, very tough to compete with them. And now today, crypto unlocks this kind of new competition. Right? Lee, I've heard you talk about new users, new computing platforms, and new business models. Ben, when you look at Blackbird, I mean, Sante asked that question to kind of tee this conversation up about, like, why crypto? But I'd love maybe we could go a little deeper into Blackbird. Like, what is the actual problem that you're solving? Maybe not for consumers right now, but actually for the restaurant industry.
00:17:41.228 - 00:17:42.984, Speaker B: I'd be very curious to hear that.
00:17:44.624 - 00:18:45.396, Speaker C: We think restaurants need a new set of identity rails. We think restaurants have no good ways of connecting with their customers, and they don't know how to think about retention, acquisition, engagement, the sort of fundamentals of actually customer acquisition and any other business context. And it's one of the things that keeps restaurants subscale. And so we think this is the opportunity is to think about connectivity between consumers and restaurants in an entirely new way, such that the average consumer is connecting much more often with the average restaurant. And over time, restaurants become much better at understanding who their customers are and making sure that the best ones keep coming back. That's the fundamental thing that we're doing. As we build that, and it unlocks opportunities on and around those rails, I think it's going to be incredibly exciting, but that's how to think about fundamentally what we're doing.
00:18:45.500 - 00:18:51.784, Speaker B: So why couldn't Resi build this? Like, why you founded Resi? Why couldn't Resi do this just with web two rails?
00:18:53.084 - 00:19:28.404, Speaker C: I think Resi could do some of this. I think Resi actually does do a version of this. I think our observation is there's a new opportunity. I've always said, like the technology stack of restaurants, it has to be agile and it has to be sort of customizable. So I think you're going to see lots of restaurants layering blackbird on top of Resi. I think, first of all, Resi is driven, is keyed off of a reservation. So there's some limits to how reservations can ultimately sort of inform connectivity.
00:19:28.404 - 00:19:44.984, Speaker C: But also, you know, I think Resi's a larger scale company now, thinking about other larger scale, near term opportunities. So hopefully, we can work with them to help them think about connectivity and loyalty.
00:19:45.604 - 00:19:56.464, Speaker E: So we've been talking about a lot of abstract stuff. Let's just walk through the user experience, like what does a consumer see and do when they sign up for Blackbird is what I'm dying to know.
00:19:56.924 - 00:20:31.964, Speaker C: So by and large, the first time a consumer interacts with Blackbird, it's at a restaurant. You're going to see one of our NFC chips, you're going to tap it, and we're going to issue you a membership card at that restaurant on the fly. It is an NFT. We don't make particularly a big deal of that because the consumer at that point, frankly, doesn't care. But the experience is you tap in, you get a membership at that restaurant, and now you're directly connected with the restaurant. You can message them through our platform, they know who you are. And now, as time goes on, you know, various things happen.
00:20:31.964 - 00:21:23.560, Speaker C: By virtue of the fact that you have this connection with the restaurant, you're going to continue to explore restaurants, you're going to continue to tap in. And in the Blackbird consumer app, you kind of develop a wallet worth of membership cards, and it then becomes incumbent upon us, Blackbird, to make sure you're surfacing and seeing the right cards at the right time so that discovery becomes magical. I don't think that you as a consumer need to have an unlimited number of choices. I think as a consumer, the right way to pick a restaurant is to understand, okay, where am I? Where are the interesting opportunities and which restaurant wants to see me the most? And so that's sort of how you think, how you should think about it as a consumer. It's a platform to unlock magic as you explore the world of restaurants.
00:21:23.722 - 00:21:37.544, Speaker E: Yeah, I've said before, nfts are like the perfect cookie. How do you think about privacy in this identity unlock. A lot of people might be sensitive to that. Certain jurisdictions like Europe might be sensitive to that.
00:21:39.324 - 00:22:48.574, Speaker C: So this all comes down to how we think about architecture and how we think about what goes where, what's on chain, what's not on chain, where on chain is it? So we think we've come up with an architecture that allows us to keep core Pii off chain, but represent the activity of the platform down to the individual check in on chain so that it can be a high, high signal, high value, high integrity data set, frankly, ledger of activity, if you will, in terms of the restaurant industry. But there's no question that in order for Blackbird to be to scale, and I think this applies to any broad consumer platform, Pii can't be on chain. That is maybe a pipe dream of an earlier sort of moment in time for crypto. But there's no way that works.
00:22:49.554 - 00:23:02.134, Speaker E: And walk us through the value add for the restaurants. This sort of becomes your CRM in some capacity. Customer acquisition costs. And what kind of receptivity have you been getting? What kind of restaurants are onboarded now?
00:23:02.954 - 00:24:07.328, Speaker C: Yeah, you could think about it as sort of a passive CRM, meaning it's a CRM that builds without the restaurant having to do much by way of maintaining it. The way CRMs work in a restaurant right now is somebody makes a reservation, they show up in your CRM in a resi or an open table, and then in order to sort of contextualize that guest, you have to start adding information to the guest profile. Right. And restaurants, good restaurants, tend to add things like what they like to eat or what's their spouse's name, or do they like table 23. So that's all well and good in an extremely high touch hospitality context. But our perspective is the better way to think about CRM and restaurants is to kind of do the work for the restaurant. So when we say passive, we mean that every time somebody checks in, whether that person's in your database or not, and assuming they've opted into sharing, obviously you get first name, last name, email, phone number, home, zip code, and birthday and dining history.
00:24:07.328 - 00:24:34.984, Speaker C: Right. So you've got a ton of information right out of the gate as a restaurant to understand who that guest is. That's really the core of the value prop. So that instead of this being this very, very bespoke, labor intensive process of understanding who your guests are, we're essentially giving you that information on the fly. The reception has been really great so far. It's been really exciting. Loyalty is a new muscle for restaurants.
00:24:34.984 - 00:25:17.764, Speaker C: Not for Starbucks, not for Sweetgreen, not for PF Chang's, but for the average neighborhood restaurant, loyalty is a new muscle. So there's certainly been a lot of collaboration, a lot of sort of, a lot of dialogue that Blackbird has with the restaurant to make sure that the implementation goes well. So we're very, very hands on at this stage of our existence, existence and at this stage of where the industry is. But, and we obviously expect that to be, we expect over time, restaurants to sort of pick up some of these things on their own. But, but the reception has been great. And I think restaurants really excited about what they're seeing it unlocked.
00:25:18.344 - 00:25:36.150, Speaker E: Are they skeptical of, you know, getting insights into their competitors? You know, there are two pizza chains. All of a sudden you have, you see the NFT of the user. Well, you can understand if he's going to another pizza chain across the street. And then there's like price wars and all this kind of stuff. Like is that something that is possible?
00:25:36.222 - 00:26:01.074, Speaker C: I mean, the answer is sometimes yes, but we tell restaurants that's an absurd thing to be worried about. You know, they're going to go to the pizza place across the street whether you like it or not. You either win them over or you don't, and it doesn't matter. It's not going to be about who has more information on their screen. It's going to be about where's the better experience, where does that customer get more love?
00:26:02.174 - 00:26:12.438, Speaker E: And the loyalty point system, how does it actually work? Is it transferable? Is it different programs and itself?
00:26:12.566 - 00:26:57.454, Speaker C: So every time you engage with Blackbird as a user, as a consumer, you earn points and those points become redeemable for things at restaurants. That's the core of it. Restaurants, of course, have an opportunity to configure programming so that if they want to send you a welcome cocktail on the third visit, that's also something that we support from a sort of configuration standpoint. But as we're learning more and more, I would say our belief increasingly is that the ecosystem of points, the earn and burn dynamics of the points, is what's going to be at the core of the rewards experience.
00:26:58.354 - 00:27:25.434, Speaker E: And I guess last question on this is these points. So of course, if you have Starbucks, you can use the points within Starbucks. What you're saying now is you have these blackbird points that if you're going to other coffee shops, those points are transferable and universal, which is always a drawback of web two loyalty programs, is that they're very much constrained to the partners that they decide. And now that is shifting over to the consumer and you have much more consumer preference.
00:27:25.854 - 00:27:44.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the rest, I think in fact, the independent restaurant industry needs the scale of the whole population of restaurants to make those points compelling, to make them actually valuable, to make them actually a currency to acquire customers. Yeah, I don't think any restaurant could do points on their own.
00:27:45.624 - 00:28:20.844, Speaker E: I want to perhaps get your thoughts on as a builder coming into the space now. What are some of the things that you've observed that are kind of trade offs or current limitations that you can't do for everyone? That maybe an infrastructure builder might be thinking about these challenges, but you're sitting on top of more of a consumer layer, which the criticism has been we've overinvested in infrastructure and under invested in consumer applications. I think that might be shifting, but I'm curious the challenges that you've encountered now that you're building in web3.
00:28:22.104 - 00:29:33.146, Speaker C: I think it's the challenge, I think about it as an opportunity, but the circumstance is that the infrastructure is in its early days. I mean, a lot of the technology, a lot of the stack that we're building that we're putting together in order to make blackbird work, you know, when in a web two context, when Resi was being built almost ten years ago now, like the things in that technology stack were like AWS and Twilio and Sendgrid and really mature big infrastructure providers. Now the infrastructure partners that we have are also series a stage, series b stage startups. So it's just a lot newer. You know, there's just sort of like, there's just sort of like, you know, it's a bunch of, it's, it's a, it's a bunch of upstarts all doing the thing together, which to me is an opportunity. Like our guys at privy, you know, who are, who are helping us with wallet infrastructure. I talk to Henry all the time.
00:29:33.146 - 00:30:02.064, Speaker C: Like he's going, you know, we're comparing notes, not just on how should this thing be built, but also, you know, we're comparing notes on fundraising, we're comparing notes on how to think about building companies. And I think that's really exciting. I think that's an opportunity. It allows us to be much closer to our infrastructure partners, to have the kinds of relationships with infrastructure partners that are very important and frankly impossible when you think about some of the very large scale infrastructure components in a web two world.
00:30:03.544 - 00:31:09.742, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global teams tokens. From easy to use Token grant award templates, through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure. Token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted token units, token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens. For legal, finance and HR teams, it is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens, not to mention the payroll tax obligations, tax reporting in every country that you employ someone, it is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly, and it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments. Toku makes this simple for leading teams across the space, protocol labs, DyDX Foundation, Mina foundation, Hedera Gnosis, safe Gitcoin, and a lot more.

00:31:16.814 - 00:31:22.754, Speaker B: Lee, do you get more excited about investing in the front end of consumer or kind of the back end like these tools like privy?
00:31:24.464 - 00:31:59.100, Speaker D: Well, we invest in the full range of it. So variant invests in the full stack of crypto, even down to low level infrastructure and new layer one. So, yeah, all of it. Everything. Yeah. But personally, I mean, as someone who spent my entire career in consumer startups, I used to be a consumer product manager before I became an investor, and I was building apps in the early App Store days. I have a soft spot for the application layer, and I think it's just really fun to spend time there.
00:31:59.292 - 00:32:07.264, Speaker B: Have you thought much about what Santi and Ben were just talking about? Could you see loyalty being this kind of quotes around this killer use case for crypto?
00:32:09.324 - 00:33:13.048, Speaker D: Definitely. So I think a bit of context is when I first met Benjamin, yeah, I kind of had this prepared mind, because ten years ago, I was working on this universal loyalty program through an app that was based in Silicon Valley, a startup that I was working at called Shopkick. Shopkick was building a universal loyalty program for retailers like physical nationwide, retailers like Macy's and Best Buy. And the idea was we could unite them all under one sort of umbrella loyalty program and create a network that would be more powerful than any individual retailer. It's like, you know, the sum is greater than the parts, sort of thing. And so we introduced our own loyalty program called Kiks. We were trying to go to all of these retailers, sign partnerships, get them to adopt this program, and we had this mobile app that would track users location and actually detect them inside of the store to reward them with kiks whenever they went to a partner retailer.
00:33:13.048 - 00:34:19.602, Speaker D: So this was kind of like black word, but in a different industry without the crypto part. In like 2013, back when location detection was not all that accurate and people's cell signals were not that good, so we had a lot of obstacles. But that priming was there in my mind where I thought there was this potential to create a more universal loyalty program and kind of enable users to get rewarded for their holistic behavior, not just their behavior at one particular merchant or one particular location. That was one element that made me really excited when I met Blackbird. The second element that I had in my prepared mind was over the time that I had been an investor. I started investing in consumer in 2016 at Andreessen, and initially spent four years as a web two investor before I started investing in crypto. And during that entire time that I had been investing in consumer.
00:34:19.602 - 00:35:17.940, Speaker D: I recognized that there were a lot of businesses, a lot of networks that should exist that couldn't really exist because of a fundamental business model. Challenge or challenge with scaling the network. Like the cold start problem was too difficult or kind of insurmountable unless you had a billion dollar injection from Bytedance or something like that. And so there were like a whole class of networks that I felt like should exist in the world. They would create a lot of value for users, but they just couldn't get off the ground because they didn't have the resources, or maybe they didn't have the right business model to make that network work at scale. And one class of these networks, I always thought was local networks, like local discovery, local social networks, anything that needed hyper local density in order for this network to actually have utility for users. And local networks are notoriously difficult to start because you need so much density for this thing to have any value.
00:35:17.940 - 00:36:20.024, Speaker D: And so you need to do user acquisition, but very targeted, and you need to basically blanket a certain density in order to jumpstart this app. And it was just really capital intensive to do that. And then once you did manage to maybe scale a local network, like, for instance, Foursquare, then the business model incentives you had at scale kind of diverge with your user interests, where the business model was usually based on advertising, and the merchants that are able to spend a lot of budget on ads advertising are not really the merchants that you want to discover as a user. So all of these problems were kind of swirling in my mind, and I was thinking about, how could crypto be leveraged to solve this issue of jumpstarting and monetizing a local network in a different way. And so anyways, all of those factors combined made me really interested in blackbird. And I've also forgotten your initial question that led me here.
00:36:20.404 - 00:36:54.896, Speaker E: Well, I guess I want to. Some of our listeners are not crypto natives and are skeptics. So I want to play devil's advocate here. Like, why might not. Why might this not work? Oftentimes, everyone thinks that we should decentralize everything. The reality is there's very few use cases that should be decentralized, like transferring large sums of money and custodying a non sovereign store. Value is highly valuable, but consumer, I've always felt like in 2017, we said, let's decentralize Airbnb and Uber.
00:36:54.896 - 00:37:44.524, Speaker E: And the reality is, well, that doesn't. So far, it's kind of nice to have a centralized entity that you can call customer support. If things go wrong and we get excited about this technology, but I think in consumer, not all things probably should be in a web, at least now or ever. So I guess I'm just kind of curious to get that take. And Resi could do this because what you're saying is the user acquisition right now, people might not even care that they're using crypto, and Resi is like an independent layer hovering above all these restaurants. It is kind of a, you're trusting resi in the same way that you're trusting block producers to, like, settle your data and store it. It's still a trust assumption.
00:37:44.524 - 00:37:51.944, Speaker E: So at the end of the day, a skeptic might say, I don't really understand why this needs to be in web3. Like, just go home, you know, just pack up your shit and go.
00:37:53.364 - 00:37:56.584, Speaker C: You sound like somebody who should work at a very, very large company.
00:37:57.144 - 00:38:07.924, Speaker E: Oh, well, I've been a crypto native since 2012, but I just, I can hold two different conflicting thoughts in my, like, I'm just a skeptic or playing that role in this podcast, I guess.
00:38:08.984 - 00:38:14.404, Speaker D: Well, my rebuttal, we're both ready to jump down Santi's back.
00:38:15.144 - 00:38:15.728, Speaker E: Let's go.
00:38:15.776 - 00:39:01.274, Speaker D: You know, my rebuttal to that is, like, note that when I said what interests me about crypto and its intersection with consumer, I didn't say decentralization. I said ownership, which is a different thing. Decentralization is important at the base layer to enable that ownership to even have value, for people to view what they're owning as legitimate. But at the application layer, I don't think that the value proposition is decentralization of governance or control or things like that. I think it's ownership. It's digital ownership, meaning ownership of assets that are valuable to the user. So that's my response.
00:39:01.274 - 00:39:05.142, Speaker D: I'll just. I think I had another thought, but I.
00:39:05.198 - 00:39:07.702, Speaker E: Well, Ben, I think, wants to say something, but you can own.
00:39:07.798 - 00:39:10.446, Speaker B: Big smile, Ben, I want to hand.
00:39:10.470 - 00:39:21.734, Speaker E: It over to you because you could own, I guess. I guess people, what I'm trying to say is users are not perhaps very sophisticated on understanding this nuance of what ownership means.
00:39:23.434 - 00:40:03.246, Speaker C: Look, I have an answer for you that might not be very satisfying, but I think the idea of entrepreneurship is you do things that other people could do, but you execute better and you think about things more creatively, and you find ways to create magical products. That's what happens when startups are successful. That's what you're seeing ultimately. And so a lot of companies could do this. Toast could do this. They've tried Resi could do this, opentable could do this. You know, it's about a particular feel for the opportunity, and either we'll get it right or we won't, you know.
00:40:03.246 - 00:40:39.010, Speaker C: But I don't think your question is, with respect, a particularly good one, because I think you always are sort of looking at when you're looking at when you're staring at an innovation opportunity. There's always going to be incumbents who could be doing it, but it turns out they don't. You know, and it turns out maybe we out execute them. You know, I think there's no question that there is a very high degree of difficulty to what we're doing. That's the nature of, that's the nature of a startup. We have to out execute everyone. We have to out execute our upstart competitors.
00:40:39.010 - 00:41:28.870, Speaker C: We have to out execute Resi, we have to out execute toast. But we see a path and that's why we're here. And I think that there is a tailwind provided by web3 and crypto. Some of it is an infrastructure tailwind in so much as some of these things are cheaper to build and will go faster thanks to the blockchain, like the various ledgering services that we need to make this work. Some of it is about empowering consumers. Some of it about is just, I think, to go back to something we started with, just the excitement of something new and, you know, we'll see, we'll find out. Do those things add up to success or are we ultimately going to be, you know, some really good thought starters, thought starter sort of fodder for larger companies to figure out some of this stuff.
00:41:28.870 - 00:41:30.110, Speaker C: Time will tell.
00:41:30.302 - 00:41:47.700, Speaker E: How much is payments a part of the thesis here, which is you could use a stable coin and that is frictionless, even just splitting the bill, certain solutions that are high friction points to check out. And if you roll it in, we're.
00:41:47.732 - 00:41:53.264, Speaker C: Very, very bullish on what opportunities we have in payments for sure.
00:41:55.484 - 00:42:07.064, Speaker B: Can we talk about the fly token? Ben, can you walk us through that decision? And Lee, I also want to, I don't know if you're able to share the progressive ownership piece that hasn't dropped yet, but maybe we can tie these two conversations together.
00:42:10.364 - 00:42:12.628, Speaker C: What should we talk about specifically on fly?
00:42:12.716 - 00:42:26.184, Speaker B: You guys didn't have to do a token. You didn't have to do fly token. I'd be curious why you're doing a token and then also just how you think about, I don't know, doing a token in the right way, because a lot of people have done it, I'd say in the not right way.
00:42:26.844 - 00:43:28.274, Speaker C: We talk about tokenomics and doing it the right way on a, literally a daily basis. It is very hard and we obviously believe it's very, very important to get it right. I think that the real answer, to be honest, is that it future proofs what we're doing. I think that in this regulatory environment, fly looks a lot like good old fashioned loyalty points, and we'll have to see how that works as time goes on. But I think at a minimum, what we are going to be able to do with it is open it up and make it permissionless and make it so that anyone can come in and use it. It's incumbent upon us to create a ton of utility and a ton of value in the fly ecosystem. That involves us being thoughtful about redemption and spending power on platform third party partners we bring into the ecosystem.
00:43:28.274 - 00:44:09.414, Speaker C: But once we do those things, and it's valuable, if you want to go and use Amex Mister points as a way of driving consumer behavior, you got to go and make a deal with Amex. You got to go buy those points. You got to go buy 5 billion points from Amex. You're Delta Airlines and you got to go buy 5 billion points. We are very excited about a future state of fly where you can just do that. You can buy the points on some version of an open market and you can set up your own program. We're also going to explore over time what ownership means in the context of fly, what controls what levers.
00:44:09.414 - 00:45:01.514, Speaker C: Does it make sense for us to essentially turn over to token holders? But I think one, one characteristic of the crypto ecosystem, frankly, is I think a lot of crypto natives tend to be focused on the sort of here and now opportunity. Like it's all about. Like we have people who are harvesting fly to get the absolute maximum number of fly points because they're waiting for our ICO. That ICO ain't coming anytime soon. Right. We got to be on a little bit of a. We're on a longer road here than maybe some of the previous generation of token projects were.
00:45:01.514 - 00:45:11.754, Speaker C: But that's how we're thinking about it. I mean, we're going to be very patient. We're focusing on utility and value, and it's a token because it future proofs the project.
00:45:12.054 - 00:45:15.814, Speaker E: Will you be able to take flat platform? Yeah, I was going to ask that.
00:45:17.434 - 00:45:22.154, Speaker C: The answer is someday, yes, but also not any day soon.
00:45:22.234 - 00:45:25.250, Speaker E: Today you can only earn the token.
00:45:25.362 - 00:45:39.294, Speaker C: Actually, we're in a very early stage test for burning points. You can redeem points if you're in New York, at Anton's and at Natson bank, you can redeem points for desserts and drinks.
00:45:40.114 - 00:45:40.618, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:40.666 - 00:45:42.386, Speaker E: So it's a sort of a lifting.
00:45:42.410 - 00:45:45.134, Speaker C: That up to another ten or so restaurants.
00:45:45.534 - 00:46:07.914, Speaker E: So it's a closed economy because the challenge a lot of projects have stumbled upon is like stripping or trying to push away the speculative use cases of a token where you might prop up the price of fly might just go up the wazoo and then that really hurts the consumer experience. But sounds like that's not an issue for you guys because it's closed.
00:46:08.734 - 00:46:44.214, Speaker C: It's closed for the time being. You know, we're discussing, you know, opening it up and making it tradable. Do we basically dock you half of your fly if you take it out into the open market? Is there a model where we can create the right balance of incentives and disincentives to make sure that the price stays where we need it to? But we want to be very transparent about how this is developing. These are the daily conversations here and we haven't made any decisions about what it's going to look like.
00:46:44.374 - 00:47:17.350, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess before we transition in your choice of building on base on this point alone, when you think about ownership, is the NFT like, I'm trying to think of the attack vectors because crypto is a very adversarial environment. Anything that could be gamed. There's constantly people that are trying to out smart you, if you will. Could you transfer the NFT to other people? Is it non transferable? And how do you think about kind of potentially this attack vector or people might.
00:47:17.502 - 00:48:05.452, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think we've said this publicly yet, but our plan on this around this question is you're going to have two blackbird wallets. You're going to have a wallet for your nfts and you're not going to have much control about what goes in and out of that wallet. We're going to run that for you. And the smart contract is not going to allow you to take those out of the blackbird ecosystem. And then things like fly and perhaps someday a stablecoin will be in a separate wallet where you have a lot more control. So those NFTs, I hate to disappoint some people who are excited about trading them, those NFTs for the foreseeable future are going to be pretty locked. We don't think, I guess we don't think there's two things.
00:48:05.452 - 00:48:39.744, Speaker C: One is we think the PIi problems, there are way way, way too substantial to sort of make those things tradable. And two is we don't think restaurants are there in terms of identities being tradable. This is something that Lee and I have talked about several times, because I don't want to put words in your mouth, Lee, but I think in a, in a sort of pure, in a pure web3 sense, there is a case to be made for making them transferable. But for us so far, practically speaking, we don't see a path.
00:48:41.844 - 00:48:43.624, Speaker B: Lee, what do you think? You also agree?
00:48:46.564 - 00:49:19.414, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually have come to sort of agree with that approach. Yeah, I think illiquidity can be a feature, not a bug. So, yeah, arguably a lot of the negative outcomes we've seen in the past few years in terms of applications that temporarily have product market fit, or at least temporarily grew a lot and then crashed subsequently were due to having too much liquidity in the system. So I actually think constraining that can be really healthy.
00:49:21.054 - 00:49:39.674, Speaker B: Ben, do you think of Blackbird as more of a restaurant app or a check in app where you can get rewards? Like, I could see you checking in at hotels or gyms or salons or music festivals or your favorite artists. How do you think about the Blackbird in three or five or seven years from now?
00:49:40.174 - 00:49:55.738, Speaker C: We're focusing on restaurants for now, for sure. I think the vertical focus makes a lot of sense for us, but who knows? Certainly if we get this right and we figure it out in our restaurants, there's a ton of other categories we can go and explore.
00:49:55.906 - 00:50:21.152, Speaker B: Yeah. Awesome. Maybe we can wrap with one last question for you, Lee, which is you and variant planted your flag in the consumer crypto thesis and have been at that for a couple of years. I'd say there's a lot of skepticism in the consumer crypto area right now, but you're starting to see the friend tech or Blackbird and starting to see these small things kind of pop up. What are you most optimistic about in consumer crypto as we look into 2024?
00:50:21.288 - 00:51:10.774, Speaker D: I don't think people have been skeptical about consumer crypto. I think, if anything, it's been the opposite, where people are really optimistic about it and keep hoping and waiting for something to work and really want it to succeed. Because ultimately, I think everyone in crypto acknowledges that we need applications to actually be successful or for any of this to take off. So that sort of addresses the framing of that question. But to your actual question itself, what am I excited about? I'm really excited about builders just treating crypto as the enabling technology and not the primary reason for someone to use something. So going back to that phrase of crypto should be the how, it's not the why. I'm really.
00:51:10.774 - 00:51:38.336, Speaker D: Yeah, I would be really excited to meet more founders building with that philosophy in mind. Treating crypto as the how, not treating it as the why, and using crypto to improve on certain categories or use cases where there is a real, real human need beyond speculation. So, yeah, that's, I think, sufficiently high level as to encompass everything.
00:51:38.520 - 00:51:53.320, Speaker E: Well, the beauty about this is that you can only farm so much, right? Because you can only go to so many restaurants. I mean, you could overeat, but that's not going to happen. So unlike yield farming, there's a human limitation one would hope.
00:51:53.472 - 00:51:54.624, Speaker C: You'd be surprised.
00:51:54.744 - 00:52:07.774, Speaker E: You'd be surprised how many. Well, maybe, actually. Maybe as we wrap up, Ben, what's, like, the craziest thing that you saw on Resi, whether it's, like, from a user perspective, from restaurants, like, I'm just kind of curious.
00:52:08.834 - 00:52:49.246, Speaker C: I mean, there's a lot of crazy stuff that goes on. I'll give you two. One is just how well it's all about people, how emotional people are about restaurants. You just can't. You can't underestimate how deeply people feel about restaurants, both in terms of how they're treated and in terms of access. The number one, this is like a faint inside of resi. It's no longer open because I think they've changed it.
00:52:49.246 - 00:53:41.534, Speaker C: But the Tiffany Blue box Cafe on 57th street was a pretty early resi customer. And every day they released their tables. I think it was at noon, and this was before the restaurant bots that are now running things took over. They would release their tables. And, like, at 1201, the emails would start coming from people who did not get a table at the Blue House cafe. And they were so angry, just beside themselves with, like, anger and sadness and confusion. Like, how can you not be letting me into the blue box cafe? I mean, we never, we had never seen anything like that.
00:53:41.574 - 00:54:06.452, Speaker B: Did you ever think about making it a market? Because I brought up Theresa at the very top of this. Like, it's actually real. We have friends coming in from Chicago. They want to eat it, either Teresa or carbone. And they're like, can we just buy a reservation or something? So I found this app called appointment trader. I'm pretty sure it's a scam, but, like, I was thinking, like, why doesn't resi just have a native marketplace where I could, someone could sell me the reservation for a couple hundred bucks or something. Do you ever think about doing that?
00:54:06.468 - 00:54:14.468, Speaker C: Well, you know, in terms of the history of Resi, this is Resi 1.0. We were just. We were selling premium reservations.
00:54:14.596 - 00:54:15.624, Speaker B: I didn't know that.
00:54:17.144 - 00:54:47.450, Speaker C: You probably didn't know because it didn't last that long. It wasn't palatable in 2015, 2014 when we first started doing it. But times have certainly changed. I mean, now a poem and trader, there's a whole slew of these apps. And by the way, to the sort of earlier question about why doesn't Resi do this? This is exactly the kind of thing that Resi is thinking about doing now. You know, like, this is. This is what Resi is focused on.
00:54:47.450 - 00:55:25.618, Speaker C: Like, really nailing how reservations should work. And I actually think, you know, I'm no longer involved except as kind of a cheerleader and occasional advisor. But I absolutely think Resi should be thinking about this, should be creating this marketplace, because then at least it's a first party. And the restaurants can, you know, benefit from the sales. All of the. All of the selling that's happening now is happening in sort of a gray market where, you know, scalpers are sort of roaming around, but there's an appetite for it, no question about it. I don't know that there's that many restaurants really, where it works.
00:55:25.618 - 00:55:41.820, Speaker C: I think that that's sort of the limiting factor in terms of the business opportunity. I just don't think there's that many restaurants in the world that have the kind of scarcity to command a real premium for reservations. But, you know, for the, like, half a percent of all restaurants where there is. Why not?
00:55:41.972 - 00:55:53.424, Speaker B: Yeah, there's this, like, I almost call it a violent market for these, for residents. I think. I think Dorcia is playing off that, too. Or I saw another one called res x pop up. But, yeah, I think it's a. I think there's something there.
00:55:54.124 - 00:56:02.004, Speaker C: So people feel very, very strongly that they should be allowed to go wherever they want to go.
00:56:02.164 - 00:56:11.020, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, this is a great chat. I would recommend, folks. What is it? Blackbird XYZ. I think you can also. Can you just go to the App Store and download the app as well?
00:56:11.132 - 00:56:13.918, Speaker C: Go to the App Store? Yeah, just search blackbird.
00:56:14.046 - 00:56:17.574, Speaker B: Cool folks should check it out. Lee, Ben, thank you both so much.
00:56:17.694 - 00:56:18.470, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:56:18.662 - 00:56:19.142, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:56:19.158 - 00:56:19.654, Speaker E: Thanks so much, guys.
