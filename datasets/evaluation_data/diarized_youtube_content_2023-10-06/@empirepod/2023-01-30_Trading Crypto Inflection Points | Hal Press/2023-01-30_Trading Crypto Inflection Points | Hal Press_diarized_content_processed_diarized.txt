00:00:00.480 - 00:00:23.034, Speaker A: First you're going to have seller exhaustion, then you are going to have FOMO buying. And then third, you are going to have the start of the positive reinforcing feedback loop where what happens is when you actually start to get that, it creates these violent moves. And those violent moves actually create on chain activity and on chain activity creates things like ETH burn, creates things like further interest and actually results in further price appreciation.
00:00:24.094 - 00:00:39.924, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got Mike Epilito from blockwork seven in Forsanti. And then we are lucky to be joined by Hal Press from North Rock, north rock digital sushi Omokase extraordinaire. Hal, welcome to the show, man.
00:00:40.664 - 00:00:42.856, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks for having me on. I'm excited to be here.
00:00:42.960 - 00:00:44.644, Speaker B: Yeah. You ready to talk, Omokase?
00:00:45.184 - 00:00:49.056, Speaker A: Sure. If you want to talk sushi for the next hour and a half, let's do it. All right.
00:00:49.080 - 00:01:06.066, Speaker B: Let's do it. I think, I think folks would be a little happier if we talked about this market pumping. So I want to talk about a bunch of stuff with you. Real yields, framework your thesis around. I know youve got this ETH BTC trade. Want to get your insights into how you think about l two s as well. A bunch of stuff we can talk about.
00:01:06.066 - 00:01:21.134, Speaker B: But I think itd be a good place to start by just talking about this recent market pump. We went into the year ETH was sitting around 1100 or 1200 today were sitting around 1600. Id love to just get your high level framework for how youre thinking about the market today.
00:01:21.974 - 00:02:16.154, Speaker A: Sure. And I was quite vocal about this, actually. As early as November, I put out a thread on Twitter, like after the whole FTX debacle because I was pretty bullish during the FTX kind of episode, during the digestion period. And I put out a thread kind of explaining my logic. And honestly, I'm kind of annoyed, given how much it's turned out to be true, that I didn't capitalize on it even more than I have. But just to go back to that, basically the thought process then was that by the end of the year, we were going to have reached what I'd refer to as extreme and complete seller exhaustion. And there was a large confluence of things that I felt like all coincided with that year end date.
00:02:16.154 - 00:03:03.594, Speaker A: But basically after FTX blew up, that was, in my opinion, kind of like the final shoe that dropped and everything that could have possibly gone wrong during 2022 did go wrong. And so if you were going to sell your crypto exposure, you basically had every single excuse to do so. And everyone that was going to sell, sold. And then on top of that, you had tax loss selling, you had fund redemptions, and you had traditional fund window dressing, all three coinciding with year end. So those are three technical forces on top of, like, mass capitulation. Like, I mean, you saw every magazine headline, every, like, tech prognosticator, all saying, crypto's dead. Sell your crypto, the market's over.
00:03:03.594 - 00:03:57.896, Speaker A: Like, this was a fad. And so combine all of that with the technical forces. Basically, everyone that was possibly going to sell crypto sold. And because of that, you had pushed prices to a level where there was clearly real sort of strong handed demand, because otherwise, who was buying all of that supply? Right? For every seller, there must be a buyer. So clearly what that was indicating was that at those levels, like at sub $1,200, at sub $17,000 bitcoin, there's real demand from crypto natives that just will DCA continuously at those prices into perpetuity, especially after the merge, when there's no structural supply of ETH. And bitcoin emissions at that point were quite low in dollar denominated values. And alts had mainly vest everything.
00:03:57.896 - 00:04:26.612, Speaker A: There wasn't a lot of actual structure supply left either. And so the flow dynamic was perfectly primed for a year end inflection at East 31st. There was simply no sellers left. And also that was like, part one of the thesis, and then part two of the thesis was, first of all, FTX doesn't really change anything. Like, okay, so we're down in exchange. That's not great. But, like, crypto is still crypto.
00:04:26.612 - 00:04:57.764, Speaker A: Everything that it used to stand on still stands. And actually, in a lot of ways, it probably accelerates the sort of regulation that that whole episode shows that we need. Right? And so there's potential for that actually to turn out to be a positive. And then on top of that, we've been seeing a macro inflection, just a broader macro inflection. And now the crypto market wasn't pricing that in because it was dealing with all these idiosyncratic issues. But inflation has clearly topped. The Fed is about to reach terminal rates.
00:04:57.764 - 00:05:36.318, Speaker A: Recession is proving to be probably more mild than people thought. Equity markets are 15% off the lows. Bond yields are 50 bps off the highs. Like, the broad macro is also inflecting. So all of those things created this confluence of events for year end to lead to the start of a sort of new uptrend. And then the second part of the thesis was, as soon as you had that start, it was very easy to see continuation, because basically every pocket of discretionary crypto exposure had been zeroed. And if there's one thing that crypto is extremely good at, it's creating fomo.
00:05:36.318 - 00:06:31.522, Speaker A: And so if you start to move off the lows with everybody, like, every pocket of exposure except super diamond hand crypto natives underexposed, then you're very likely to have some fOMO buying after the initial move. And so we saw that, too. And then the third part of the thesis, which actually also held, was that first you're going to have seller exhaustion, then you were going to have FOMO buying, and then third, you were going to have the start of the positive reinforcing feedback loop, where what happens is, when you actually start to get that, it creates these violent moves. And those violent moves actually create on chain activity. And on chain activity creates things like ETH burn creates things like further interest and actually results in further price appreciation. And what you get is this feedback loop where price appreciation begets activity, and activity begets price appreciation. And you start to create this feedback loop.
00:06:31.522 - 00:06:56.784, Speaker A: And that was actually the third part of the thesis, all which I laid out in November. And basically, all three of those distinct events have really happened. You had the seller exhaustion, then the fomo buying, and now the activity, self fulfilling feedback loop. And so where we go from here, um, is harder, obviously, to predict, but that is my sort of understanding as to, like, how we've gotten here. Hmm.
00:06:56.944 - 00:07:14.176, Speaker B: So, all right, so you nailed that call, right? You've got fomo buying, exhaustion, and sell in selling, and then you've got these. This, like, nice positive feedback loop that's going on on chain. And the thesis was, right. That you put out in November, right? Or December, and the market went up 30.
00:07:14.240 - 00:07:19.544, Speaker A: And I will say, as I said before, like, just because I have a feedback doesn't mean that we capitalized on as well as we should. Like, I.
00:07:19.704 - 00:07:40.800, Speaker B: You undersized, maybe you undersized it, but, like, so you got the thesis right. 40, 30, 40%. In the main ones, things like apdos are up, like, 400%. But, like, I'll focus in on ETH, because I know you spend a lot of time in ETH. Like, ETH right now is pushing up against that, like, 1650, 1700, like that. That strong wall that you. That you see oftentimes.
00:07:40.800 - 00:07:46.476, Speaker B: What, like, where do you think dark it goes from here? I know that's the much harder question, but, yeah, how are you handling.
00:07:46.500 - 00:08:35.874, Speaker A: So, this is actually one of the things that we got wrong. We thought that ETH was going to lead the early part of the yearly rally, and that wasn't true. I sort of thought that, well, at least empirically, that didn't turn out to be the case. I thought that ETH would lead because I thought that the technical selling into year end was probably greater in ETH than bitcoin because it was probably led by more institutional selling, which for whatever reason, may not have been the case. But I thought that ETH was going to rebound more strongly also because tech, typically in historical regimes, ETH is the higher beta asset. And so when the market rallies ETH BTC tends to go up, ETH BTC tends to trade with some beta goes up, and market goes up goes down, and market goes down. But that didn't happen.
00:08:35.874 - 00:09:08.060, Speaker A: And the reason it didn't happen, in my opinion, was because of Shanghai withdrawals. Well, two reasons, I think ETH BTC was crowded and second, Shanghai withdrawals. So personally, I had expected ETH to sort of underperform into Shanghai, but Shanghai is not till April. And I thought that the market would start to price that in like two months out in February. I didn't think it would start as early as January. So it happened a little faster than I anticipated. And so I think, just to get to your question, ETH has been a laggard.
00:09:08.060 - 00:09:51.324, Speaker A: I think ETH has been used as like the funding leg for a lot of these other higher beta shorts, higher beta alt longs. And also I think more of the fresh buying has been in bitcoin. And also I think ETH BTC was a bit crowded coming into the year. So all three of those have contributed to sort of ETH underperforming bitcoin and definitely underperforming alts. However, I think we've finally gotten to some levels now where ETH BTC is pretty washed out. And on top of that, the Shanghai sort of front run, I think, is largely priced in. And also I think Shanghai is not going to be that negative.
00:09:51.324 - 00:10:14.374, Speaker A: This is another thing that we can talk about. But I think the market is overly anxious about it. I don't think there's going to be a lot of supply. And like I said, we can get into the specifics of that. And at the same time, you do have structural demand in ETH now. So you have $5 million of ETH by pressure daily. And so what that means is just that, like every day, you know, people can keep rotating out of ETH, but that's just going to be absorbed.
00:10:14.374 - 00:10:45.114, Speaker A: And at a certain point, they're going to, like, they're going to run out of willing sellers. And after Shanghai, when everyone tries to rotate back into ETH, I think you're going to see ETH start to outperform again. So how it trades between now and sort of April is, is tricky. I think it probably chops around and doesn't do a whole lot in terms of, like, ETH BTC and just generally moves with risk in the market. But I do think after Shanghai, ETH BTC can restart its uptrend that it was on before.
00:10:45.414 - 00:11:00.982, Speaker C: Hal, when you say that ETH BTC was a crowded trade, first of all, can you explain why that ratio is important? ETH BTC, why do so many people track that? But then also, when you say ETH BTC was crowded, is there a very specific trade that people were putting on? And if so, how does that trade kind of unwind?
00:11:01.118 - 00:11:18.284, Speaker A: We had the trade on. It was painful. The trade is long ETH, short bitcoin. I mean, that's a structural position. I had decreased it because I was already starting to worry about Shanghai, but I hadn't taken it off to start the year. And I think a lot of funds had that position on. Right.
00:11:18.284 - 00:11:51.424, Speaker A: And so the position can be manifested in a few different ways. Like you can either as a fund, if you don't have shorts, you can just have more of your exposure in Ethan than bitcoin, or you can literally have the actual trade on, which is what we had, which is long ethics, short bitcoin, like on purpose. And so that is the trade that I'm referring to. And I think that had become a sort of consensus position because of a lot of the structural factors which I've talked about at awesome. And I think that unwound to start this year.
00:11:52.564 - 00:11:58.316, Speaker C: And why do just for folks who might not be familiar, like EBTC, that ratio gets talked about quite a bit.
00:11:58.340 - 00:11:58.476, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:58.500 - 00:12:02.504, Speaker C: And people track it. You see these charts on Twitter. Like, why is that an important ratio to pay attention to?
00:12:03.084 - 00:12:53.070, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I mean, they are the two major assets in the space, right? There's like really no other, there's no other assets that come anywhere close in terms of liquidity, in terms of staying power, and in terms of importance to the space. And so they are kind of in a category of their own. And then the relative ratio of them, it just reflects a lot of the dynamics of the space. Typically, it's been important because bitcoin has kind of been the reserve asset of the space and ETH has been the higher beta alt. And so it's used sort of as a reflection for risk appetite and risk beta. But also it's just important to try to, like, a lot of people think one's better than the other.
00:12:53.070 - 00:13:11.364, Speaker A: And so there's this like large, sort of like heated debate between the two sides about it. And that's kind of a reflection of how the market is perceiving it. And yeah, historically it's just been, it's just been a very notable ratio because those two have always been the largest tokens in the space for a long time.
00:13:14.384 - 00:13:26.924, Speaker C: Let's talk a little bit about Shanghai. I mean, can you, I'm sure most listeners will already be familiar with what Shanghai, but can you just give like an overview of what Shanghai is and then maybe we can get into sort of like the ramifications price wise?
00:13:27.944 - 00:14:11.868, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So the beacon chain was enabled a couple years ago, and that meant that there was a proof of stake chain. This was still when proof of work was live. But you could then stake your ETH on the proof of stake chain and receive staking rewards through the format. Originally they were just ETH issuance, and since the merge, they also get priority fees and Mev, which used to go to miners, but now go to stakers. And so you could deposit ETH to the beacon chain and start becoming a validator and receiving these rewards. However, you could not withdraw that ETH, and you still cannot withdraw that ETH.
00:14:11.868 - 00:14:59.868, Speaker A: So once it was a one way door, and it still is a one way door, you can deposit ethanol, you cannot withdraw ETH. Shanghai is just the name of the fork that is going to finally, two years later, enable withdrawals. And that just means that anybody that staked their ETH is now going to be able to withdraw that ETH from the beacon chain if they would like to. And so there's a lot of anxiety in the market because they look and they see, okay, 16 million ETH is staked, which is like $20 billion more, a bit more than that. And they think, okay, that is locked ETH that can't sell. And then once Shanghai is enabled, that's all going to be able to come out. And then a lot of those people probably want to sell, and that's going to be a ton of supply on the market.
00:14:59.868 - 00:15:42.556, Speaker A: Now, the reason that I don't think that that sort of knee jerk reaction is necessarily the right one is a variety of things. Well, first of all, actually over 60%, it's about 62%. I refreshed my calculations the other day of that ETH is actually already liquid. So if you stake through lido, for example, or Coinbase, you can either liquid stake. They have a liquid staking derivative or an exchange stake derivative. And if you do either of those, they give you a representative token that is liquid today, and you can trade. And these have traded very close to peg for a long time.
00:15:42.556 - 00:16:27.702, Speaker A: And so anybody that wants to exit their liquid ETH position can already have done so for 62% of that ETH. So 62% is already liquid. And the rewards on that 62% is also already liquid. So that 62% you can kind of just forget about when Shanghai happens. There is no liquidity change for that 62%. Now, the other 32% is what we care about, and that is made up of home stakers. So that's like, if I have my own validator, which I have set up, by the way, and you just set it up in your house, and you are just validating traditionally through the chain, instead of paying somebody 10% of your rewards to validate for you, then that ETH is not liquid, because you do not have someone giving you a liquid staking derivative token to represent your ETH in the meantime.
00:16:27.702 - 00:16:59.490, Speaker A: So you actually have been locked. However, the important thing is to look at the profile of those people. Really. Those are the most die hard ETH, Maxi ETH loyalist people that exist in the world. Those are the people that were liquid staking two years ago, or, sorry, not liquid staking that were home staking two years ago, when staking wasn't even being talked about very much. These are not the kind of folks that want to sell their ethnicity. They want more ETH.
00:16:59.490 - 00:17:41.496, Speaker A: Like, they're not gonna just be like, oh, I finally, after two years, can redeem this ETH experiment and sell it and move on, right? That's not who they are. They wouldn't have been home staking two years ago if that was now. Some of these people might have had changing life events or whatever and want the money. And sure, some of them are gonna sell, but I think it's gonna be a very low percentage of that 38%. And so, like, I have my own model, which at some point I'll share, and I run the numbers, and I just don't see a very material amount of notional ETH selling. And I think it's going to be spread over quite some time. So what's going to happen is the rewards on those home stakers are going to be distributed quite quickly over the first, I think, about four days.
00:17:41.496 - 00:18:21.216, Speaker A: And that will lead to a small burst of like moderate selling. But really, honestly, that's not even that much. Like we're talking in the order of like a couple hundred million dollars of ETH selling, which like, you know, that sort of flow happens on a daily basis. That's not like anything out of the ordinary. Like that's, that flow is certainly not worth 10% of ETH BTC, which is what we've already seen the ratio move, and especially, especially in like a market where it would normally have been up and then followed by probably another couple months of a similar order of magnitude selling, and then it's done right, and then that's it. Like, there is no more ETH selling ever. Like the miners have sold, the withdrawals have sold that.
00:18:21.216 - 00:18:22.164, Speaker A: That's the end.
00:18:22.664 - 00:18:25.844, Speaker B: That's the line of the podcast. There's no more ETH selling ever.
00:18:27.264 - 00:18:31.584, Speaker A: Two months after Shanghai, no more technical selling of ETH into eternity.
00:18:31.704 - 00:18:56.582, Speaker B: So I think that's a good counterargument to how to the, you know, there's going to be a big dump from Shanghai. What will the, will there be any other like structural or like rotations into maybe, like who will the, like, what platforms will come out winning this? Like will rocket pool do, do really well from this? Will Lido like do better or worse because of this, like coinbase better or worse? I'm curious to hear, like, who's going to be the beneficiaries of this rotation?
00:18:56.678 - 00:19:05.966, Speaker A: So it's a good question. I don't want to, like, I don't want to show all my cards on this, obviously, because like, you know, we obviously have positions and does this mean.
00:19:05.990 - 00:19:10.034, Speaker B: You'Re either long rocket pool or long lido? Is that what I'm hearing here?
00:19:11.414 - 00:19:40.216, Speaker A: We obviously have positions and like this is a, this is like a very important dynamic. There will be winners and losers and there's positioning to be done in regards to that. However, with that said, I would say probably, in my opinion, the most obvious winner the ETH maxis are going to like, this is Rocketpool you're about to.
00:19:40.240 - 00:19:41.604, Speaker B: Fire up David Hoffman.
00:19:43.024 - 00:20:33.484, Speaker A: I think it's rocket pool because I just think it's the most direct beneficiary of staking participation going up because you actually need to buy RPL to stake on rocket pool. And then on top of that, I don't think it's that crowded of like a fund or like fast money long. So there's probably not that much sell. The news that comes. And then third, a lot of the, well, some of the home stakers are going to migrate to liquid staking. And if those folks are going to migrate to one of the liquid staking platforms, it's very likely going to be rocket pool because those folks are decentralization maxis, and Rocketpool is like the most decentralized of the liquid staking options. And so I think for those three reasons, it probably stands to gain the most from actual Shanghai implementation.
00:20:34.224 - 00:21:08.404, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around mev, we're on to appchains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:21:08.404 - 00:21:29.104, Speaker B: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just built the platform. I can search for an l, one. I can search for a protocol, pull up the platform@blockworksresearch.com. I search the term there's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter.
00:21:29.104 - 00:21:52.948, Speaker B: Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably in the wrong business.

00:22:03.244 - 00:22:12.140, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show. There are other implications, but that's the most obvious one to me.
00:22:12.252 - 00:22:30.680, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you think about when you look at the liquid staking derivative providers like Lido, rocket pool? There's Cbeth on there as well. I mean, let's just talk about Lido and rocket pool. So what do you think about? There's like two ways to think about that. It's like a trade, right? Which is like, don't overthink it. Left side of the bell curve. Like, liquid staking.
00:22:30.680 - 00:23:02.902, Speaker C: Shanghai after, like, liquid staking, derivatives go up. Like, that's a good momentum trade. But then there's, like, a longer term kind of fundamental valuation that you could do. And this is one of those. Like, one of our analysts was talking about this the other day, which is, like, even if you take really generous assumptions for something that, like, Lido. Like, Lido is trading at a $2 billion fully diluted valuation, even if you assume they get, like, some ridiculous, like, 80% market share or something like that, they're still incredibly richly valued, basically. So I guess my question.
00:23:02.902 - 00:23:10.434, Speaker C: Yeah. On a shorter term narrative basis. But then also, like, if you could talk about them on, like, a valuation type framework as well.
00:23:10.934 - 00:23:43.258, Speaker A: So, okay, I said a few things. So, first of all, there is a real fundamental benefit here, right? So what happens is, and I've talked about this at nozzle, like, I've written a 30 page thesis back when we did the merge, about my liquid sticky derivative thesis and why withdrawals matter. And it was just purely focused on fundamentals. The reason that. Okay, so the fundamental sort of tailwind, like, why is this positive? Is really. There's two prongs to it. If you think about these protocols.
00:23:43.258 - 00:24:18.708, Speaker A: They have revenues and expenses. Their revenue comes from the 10% reward that they charge, the 10% fee that they charge on staking rewards on their products. And so that's really a factor of a few variables. But one of those variables is how much ETH they have staked. And one of the variables that influences that is staking participation rate. So, on the revenue side of the calculation, if there are more people that are going to stake Ethan, I think people have looked at Ethan being like, okay, it's 15%. Staking participation rate, like, every other proof of stake chain, is 60 plus.
00:24:18.708 - 00:24:56.108, Speaker A: So there's a lot of reasons that ETH is lower than the others and probably doesn't get to that level, but there's a lot of room for growth above 15. And one of the things holding it back is the fact that you can't withdraw. And so after withdrawals are enabled, there's a view, I think the correct view, that staking participation rate is going to go up dramatically. So, on the revenue side of the equation, that just leads to more staked ETH for everybody. Every player in the field just gets their product to get greater traction. So what does that mean for, like, lido, for example? Revenue up? That's the revenue side of the equation. And that's like, forget market share.
00:24:56.108 - 00:25:59.678, Speaker A: Like it's just the, it's a rising tide for all of the parties in the entire space, right? Because just more state deeds. Now, the expense side of the equation, really the largest expense of these protocols is the emissions that they pay to maintain the peg on their staked ETH derivative versus ETH. So, for example, Lido has to pay out Lido tokens to the curve pool such that people will lp in the curve pool and provide liquidity to maintain Peg, because otherwise they will not keep their peg after withdrawals. You shouldn't need to pay out so many emissions because there's a natural arbitrage. The market forces alone should be enough to keep peg, and so they should be able to reduce those emissions. So the actual fundamental thesis is that on the one hand, revenue is a beneficiary, and on the other hand, expenses are reduced. So you have these two prongs fueling greater fundamentals for the protocols.
00:25:59.678 - 00:26:29.354, Speaker A: Now, that's just the directional drivers. To your point, valuation is also a factor, right? Like, okay, these things get a benefit. Do they get a 300% benefit or a 100% benefit? And that's a relevant question. And I think you're right. Like, if you look at Lido valuation, I think I haven't, I haven't refreshed the numbers on my model that recently. And it depends on each price. But, like they might do somewhere like 60 million of revenue or something like that.
00:26:29.354 - 00:27:16.466, Speaker A: And you mentioned that they trade at 2 billion FTB. It's a bit higher now, but something like that. So they're trading like 40 times that bullcase revenue number, which you could argue is expensive, right? Like in the traditional stock market, that's an expensive valuation, especially for like a market incumbent that isn't going to take market share anytime soon. However, the reality is pretty much every single thing is fundamentally overvalued in crypto. Like, if you want to look at the metrics from a pure equity standpoint, you're not going to find a lot of cheap things. That's actually not entirely true. There are some cheap things.
00:27:16.466 - 00:27:52.514, Speaker A: For example, if you look at ETH, ETH pays a 7.5% yield and is deflationary. So in theory, it's trading like 13 times earnings, maybe less, actually. Twelve times earnings, which is extremely cheap. If you look at something like GMX, they generate an 8% ETH yield, which is also twelve times earnings. So there are some exceptions. But what you find is that generally in crypto, things don't really trade off valuation metrics because the holder base is not the type of holder base that's going to hold these things for ten years and see the earnings outflow.
00:27:52.514 - 00:28:12.994, Speaker A: Crypto is much more of a short term oriented audience, and as a result, the fundamentals tend to matter less than they do in a traditional equity world. And so I think it's important to understand those things. But I also think it's really important to understand that just because you have your fundamentals does not mean the market's going to reflect them.
00:28:14.234 - 00:28:29.254, Speaker B: Hal, this seems like a pretty convicted bet, and I've heard you talk about how, like most at this point, like, your job really as a trader is to take really concentrated, highly convicted bets. Is there anything that could change your decision here, whether it be on, like, ETH or liquid staking derivatives?
00:28:30.074 - 00:29:22.346, Speaker A: Oh, I just say, like, on the liquid staking derivatives, like, it's a high conviction bet. However, there's naturally, like, phases of things, right? Like, there's phases of that conviction. And I think that conviction is much stronger to start the year when no one's talking about it than it is now when the first question I get asked on a podcast is about it, right? And everyone on Twitter is talking about it, right? So, and I'm not married. I've tried to make this extremely clear in general, and I will make it clear again now, I'm not married to any position. My obligation is to my investors. And my views change all the time. So certainly my views can and will change.
00:29:22.346 - 00:29:55.094, Speaker A: And when I think that something has ran its course, I will move on to the next opportunity that I think offers me the best reward. I will not hold the same positions for five years. It's just not going to happen. And so, like, the answer to your question is, yes, things can change for me to change my views. And one of those things is just time running its course and my view becoming better appreciated by the rest of the market. Like, if that happens, then all right, like, the gig is up. That doesn't mean that I think these things necessarily have to go down, but they no longer offer me alpha.
00:29:55.094 - 00:30:29.718, Speaker A: So I need to find, move on and find something else that does offer me alpha where people aren't aligned with my view and where there is further greater potential for change. So that's not to say that's the case with everything, right? Like, there are certain things which are just structural and I believe in, and I'll hold for a very long time. But certainly my sizing and my positioning definitely impacts sort of or is impacted by my level of conviction and one of the factors that influences that is really just how differentiated I think my view is from everyone else.
00:30:29.846 - 00:30:50.274, Speaker B: Yeah, one view id love to get your take on Mike. I dont know if you want to keep talking about Shanghai, but I guess its tied into this. Its just like your real yields framework and your belief around real yields and some of this conversation that was happening more in the September October timeframe. Would love to get your updated views around your real yields thesis.
00:30:51.294 - 00:31:26.762, Speaker A: Yeah its a good question and its definitely something that I pay attention to. The gist of it is really just there's a lot of yield in crypto, but not all yield is created equal. As we've learned over and over and over and over again. There's a difference between a token paying out or minting 10% new tokens every year out of thin air and giving that to stakers and saying, oh, here's 10%. Staking reward like that is not a real yield. That is just we're diluting you by 10% and giving that token back to you. And so you feel like you're getting 10% but you're actually getting nothing.
00:31:26.762 - 00:32:03.470, Speaker A: Because for the market cap to stay constant, the price needs to go down 10% and nothing actually is happening here. There's a difference between that. And we actually have users that want to use the chain ETH and they pay us money to use the chain and we distribute that rewards to you and that's your yield. Now, that ETH yield does not come only from fees, it also comes from emissions. However, if you look@the.net effect of it is deflationary. So like the net emissions are negative and you get a 7.5%
00:32:03.470 - 00:32:23.712, Speaker A: yield. So that 7.5% yield is real yield. Like it's actually accruing to the users because they're not being diluted. And that's very different than another blockchain where they just, they just emit the tokens and then you get those as a staking reward, but you get deflated. So that's the concept of real yield. And I do think it's relevant.
00:32:23.712 - 00:32:31.484, Speaker A: Like I said before, crypto is only loosely tied to fundamentals, so it's not like the only factor that matters. But I do think it's an important consideration.
00:32:35.744 - 00:32:46.764, Speaker C: One thing that on that subject, Hal, I'd love to get your sort of thought about how other alternative layer ones do in this environment. So Aptos obviously just repped like 400.
00:32:46.804 - 00:33:01.652, Speaker A: We can talk about aptos. Aptos is an interesting case study to discuss. And I've talked about this on Twitter. I was shorted to start the year, so it's another painful one that I wish I would have. It's okay. I covered it all around six to $8. So I have.
00:33:01.652 - 00:33:07.028, Speaker A: I got out of the way before things got really ugly. But yeah, it was a painful one. That's taught me some lessons.
00:33:07.196 - 00:33:40.184, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, I'd love to. Even before getting into apto specifically, like, when it comes to it seems like Ethereum is far out in terms of winning this l one war battle that's been raging for the last two years. In your opinion, has ETH definitively won here? And there's not going to be much. Maybe there'll be some small ones that capture a small portion of activity, or do you think. Because one way. What I could see investors having learned from the last cycle is that some of those l one trades didn't pan out, but it's the only investable asset.
00:33:40.184 - 00:33:43.204, Speaker C: In a lot of ways, you could have learned that lesson.
00:33:45.024 - 00:34:43.664, Speaker A: There's becoming more investable app layer tokens, which I think is necessary. Dydx is one I've talked about a little bit. I was actually looking at it as a short, because there was this massive cliff unlock, but then they moved that, and as I dug into it on the short side, I realized how much potential there was on the long side. And now I actually think it's a really compelling long, and we could talk about that at some point if you want. But just to get into the weeds on the l one, the l one dynamic, there's so many different, like, pieces of this, of this question that I want to unpack. And so I'll try to distill it down and kind of hit on each one. But I do think that ETH has clearly demonstrated and sort of won the l one competition in terms of who's going to be the prominent l one.
00:34:43.664 - 00:35:30.084, Speaker A: It's like, I don't even know if you can even say that, though, because ETH long term is probably not even that used, that used of an l one. It's probably more of the l two chains built on top of ETH and ETH more of the settlement layer. So it's like it's not even. It's not even really clear. But I guess how I'd rephrase that is, say the ETH ecosystem has won as sort of the dominant l one ecosystem, whether that be ETH polygon, arbitrum, optimism, starkware, cksync, like, whatever, right there's so many different, like, large scale chains that are going to be built on ETH, that are all going to, like, utilize ETH as collateral. A lot of them are going to have their fees paid in ETH. They're all going to settle on ETH and pay ETH fees to do that.
00:35:30.084 - 00:36:08.804, Speaker A: So, like, that ecosystem, I think, has clearly won. And the reason that I think it's clearly won is because it's captured such a liquidity moat. Like, if you want to have an NFT collection that has real liquidity, it needs to be on ETH because that's where all the NFT traders are. And like, yes, Solana has another. And also, I am long Solana, too. Solana was one of the things that we did get right. We bought a lot of Solana under $10 because we thought that it was probably the poster child of all those technical forces of year end selling and was going to mean revert the hardest in the new year.
00:36:08.804 - 00:36:37.338, Speaker A: And that was one of the parts of the thesis that we did get right. And also, I do believe in Solana. I think that there is a real ecosystem there of developers, of more importantly than actually developers, there are users. Like, there are actually users that want to use the Solana chain. And there, and also another important thing which kind of gets underappreciated is that Solana has culture. Like, there's its own culture to Solana. It's not just like a ripoff chain.
00:36:37.338 - 00:37:11.770, Speaker A: Like it's its own thing. It has its own sort of history, its own culture, its own, honestly, influencers. Like, it has a whole ecosystem built around it that I think is the only other chain that really rivals ETH at all in terms of that culture. And so, like, I do think Solana will exist. However, you saw this, right? Like with, with D gods. Like, they moved their NFT collection from Solana to ETH and everyone's like, me included is like, geez, what a bunch of clowns. Like, they have no loyalty.
00:37:11.770 - 00:37:57.802, Speaker A: But the floor price pumps, it's like, so, yeah, I mean, that's because there's all the liquidity is on ethnic. So I think that other ecosystems will exist, and I think that certain, there will be certain winners of that second tier category. But I think ETH has won as the premier, sort of l one, at least in the foreseeable future. Nothing is set in stone. But I think for the foreseeable future, that'd probably be my view. And then on top of that, though, I hesitate to even have this discussion, because to me, ETH is more than just an l one layer, or at least to have this discussion only talk about it as an l one layer. I actually think that ETH is a better decentralized Sov store of value than bitcoin.
00:37:57.802 - 00:38:45.684, Speaker A: I actually think ETH is competing for that sort of market as well. And it's not just a application chain like l one gas fee token. I actually think ETH is probably like, if you're trying to just store value in a censorship resistant way, long term, I think ETH is a better bet than bitcoin. And that's not to say that right now ETH is more decentralized than bitcoin or more censorship resistant than bitcoin, because it isn't. But it is to say that I think ETH has a better chance in the terminal state of being a sustainable sov than bitcoin does. Because I think bitcoin just faces a lot of sort of fundamental foundational flaws that ETH has actually solved.
00:38:46.504 - 00:38:50.124, Speaker B: Can you, can you go deeper there, Hal? Can you just say more about that?
00:38:52.144 - 00:39:54.162, Speaker A: Sure. And this is something that also I have spoken about and written about. But basically, the gist of it is, I do not think long term, like, if we're going to talk decades, I do not think that an sov can just keep paying for its security by emitting tokens to miners and having them just sell those back into the market. I think long term, what you need, and this was actually written in the bitcoin white paper, and this was the vision of Satoshi, was that security cost needs to transition from pure emissions to actually fee generation. So rather than getting people to mine the token, because they get the token emissions, you need them to mine, because they get the fee pool, because that fee pool is sustainable and doesn't inflate the total supply. The problem is, bitcoin doesn't generate any fees, and the fees have been down only for a long time. And there's only one chain that actually does.
00:39:54.162 - 00:40:34.890, Speaker A: Only one l one chain that. Well, there's two. The other is BNB. But BNB is so non decentralized that it's not really in the conversation for this. Outside of BNB, there's only one chain that does generate fees that are sort of large enough to actually cover the security budget, and that's ETH. And on top of that, ETH is not as decentralized today, but has the potential to get there like I envisioned a world in ten years where Vitalik is no longer really involved with ETH. The developers have all turned over the roadmap has mainly been completed and the developers are fulfilling more of like a maintenance role similar to the bitcoin.
00:40:34.890 - 00:41:25.074, Speaker A: Developers like, the bitcoin has a core developer team, too. It's not like it's any different. It's just it's less important to bitcoin than ETH's developer program is to ETH, because ETH is actually still evolving and bitcoin really isn't. But I think that ETH can get ossified to a point where it looks a lot more like that in the future, but it still generates fees, and at that point, it will be equally decentralized, equally censorship resistant, because I also think they're going to be able to solve the issues with censorship on the staking layer and much more sustainable long term, and as a result, going to be just a better decentralized store value than bitcoin long term. And so I will concede it's not today. But I think what really matters, especially, like, if you're somebody who has a lot of money and you're trying to store your value, you're not trying to store it for like five years. You want to store it for like decades.
00:41:25.074 - 00:41:30.314, Speaker A: I don't think you can have the conviction that bitcoin is going to be that in a few decades. I think you can.
00:41:32.594 - 00:42:11.254, Speaker C: I think one thing that I'd be curious to get your thought on is the way I see this is there's a branding element here that people don't often talk about, which is just like, what is the one word that you associate with bitcoin? What's the one word that you associate with ETH? Same way that companies get one word when you think about their brand. And bitcoin staked it all on this digital gold narrative. And in a lot of ways, that was limiting. But what it is, is very simple and very easy to understand. And that's what I want, that the ETH, because it does so much else. It does so much more than that. It complicates it, it dilutes it.
00:42:11.254 - 00:42:28.726, Speaker C: People don't think, at least most people, I would argue out in the world, don't think money store value when they think of ETH. So when I think of what's going to make these things a store of value, what are their paths? The path for ETH now to grow is to. To increase its utility in a crypto ecosystem.
00:42:28.830 - 00:42:29.094, Speaker A: Right?
00:42:29.134 - 00:42:55.962, Speaker C: Like, that's a soup, and that's everything that we're talking about in the show here. Bitcoin doesn't have that it's basically lost that battle, but its road to growth is off chain buying. It's like, it's like macro funds. It's like, you know, at the highest level, potentially countries or central banks buying it. So, like, what do you, do you think that's an appropriate framing? And when you lay it out like that, I mean, where do you think the bigger growth driver is for? For both of these assets?
00:42:56.058 - 00:43:18.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think. I think you're correct. Like, regardless of what I think, the market perception is the market perception. Right. It doesn't matter what I think. It just matters what the market thinks. And I would agree, because ETH does do a lot of things, people don't actually see it for what it necessarily is.
00:43:18.334 - 00:44:10.916, Speaker A: And that thought necessarily, that doesn't necessarily have to remain the case. Like, it just takes one sovereign or one, like, country or whatever to buy as a store of value. And then, you know, people might just start view it differently. But I think at current, that's certainly been the case. And so I do think that I agree with you on that point. And I, and I do agree, like, certainly that other pool of capital is extremely large and could conceivably represent a larger growth driver than just the crypto natives buying more ETH to keep using in this crypto economy. But the other point that I think is kind of relevant, though, is that there is a very large structural difference, which is that because of these inefficiencies that exist with bitcoin, there is just more bitcoin emitted to miners every day, and that just gets sold every day.
00:44:10.916 - 00:44:26.904, Speaker A: And because ETH has actual fees, there's just ETH bought every single day to buy ETH. So it's not just your incremental buyer, it's also the structural forces that I think are arguably more important. And their ETH has clearly won. And so that is definitely a big factor.
00:44:28.884 - 00:44:29.660, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:44:29.732 - 00:44:46.796, Speaker C: Maybe we can get into aptos here, because so much of the discussion about aptos run has been like, oh, they shouldn't be doing, this is ridiculous. Aptos is valued as much as hated rally. Hated rally, most hated rally. But if I had to maybe take.
00:44:46.820 - 00:44:50.212, Speaker A: A guess at a reason how we, like, do they love.
00:44:50.268 - 00:44:51.384, Speaker C: They love the Aptos.
00:44:53.964 - 00:44:56.500, Speaker A: Korea has been the main driver of the Aptos rally.
00:44:56.652 - 00:45:44.252, Speaker C: Yeah. So one force that always tends to get underestimated is there's, like, a tremendous, like, dampening of volatility. Forces like assets get bigger just because the amount that's needed to marginally, like, move the price is like so much larger and larger that like bitcoin, I think was like the first, if you want to call it like a victim of this. And I think ETH is now in that pool too, where like just the marginal amount of buying or selling to move the price of these assets are higher. And like Aptos is in that low liquidity category, which it can just rip like this. And some, I think it was Ryan Watkins that made a pretty interesting point, which was that until you get a valuation framework that everyone agrees on for these l one s, this is going to continue to happen. That like there'll be a big move and then people value l one's like relative to one another.
00:45:44.252 - 00:46:05.320, Speaker C: So they'll be like, oh, like ETH is worth like $200 billion. Here's this like upstart. Maybe it'll be worth 5% of that, which is like an arbitrary number. And because it's low liquidity, in many cases low float, it just rips. So is that kind of the dynamic aid? Is that the dynamic that you see with aptos? And do you see that general dynamic, like kind of continuing into the future with.
00:46:05.432 - 00:46:44.994, Speaker A: Well, there's a few dynamics. There's a few dynamics with apdos. It's an interesting one. First of all, I think a lot of people were shorted to start the year, as indicated by the fact that I was shorted to start the year. I think that was a consensus thing, because I think part of this, get part of this at the very heart is about fdv versus market cap. And I think ultimately, like fdv is the relevant metric because that's what represents the total tokens. However, in any shorter period of time, FDV truly is a meme.
00:46:44.994 - 00:47:37.660, Speaker A: Like, it actually doesn't matter because it's not liquid. It's not like the portion of liquid participants. They're not part of that. If at those market cap is 200 million, but its FTV is 3 billion and Solana, or lets say matic market cap is 3 billion and fdv is 3 billion, theyre the same valuation. However, theres only $300 million of people long Aptos and theres $3 billion of people long Matic. So if 10% of the people move from Matic to Aptos, Apdos doubles and matic goes down 10% like it does the market cap, in terms of the actual money flows, is what matters. Now, long term, if you want to put a pear trade on for three years, you could do FTV because ultimately those tokens will become liquid again, and then they will reflect that.
00:47:37.660 - 00:48:19.576, Speaker A: But it's just way out in the future, especially for something like Apdos, where the investor unlocks are not actually until September, then FDB truly is a meme. And this is one of the things that we got wrong, is that we were looking at it on FTV, but FDV is not relevant so far away from the unlocks. So that was, like, one factor. I think you had a lot of people short, and then the market just systematically targeted everything. People were short rationally, so, because they knew these people are going to have to cover, and they all did, me included. Thankfully, I covered earlier, but, yes, everyone covered. And so the market kind of targeted those shorts, and Aptos was a poster child of it, and so that was what got it going.
00:48:19.576 - 00:48:59.482, Speaker A: And then, as I've said many times before, in crypto, well, in every market, this is the case, but it's definitely the case in crypto, price leads narrative and not the other way around. And so. And the fact that people were short apdos, that's all you needed for it to go up, right? It wasn't because app does is a great chain. It just, like, the market knew people were short and they could squeeze them, and so they did. And then the people covered, and the price ripped because it was low float and everyone had to exit a small door. And then people say, oh, well, hold on a second. Maybe this Aptos chain is the next big thing.
00:48:59.482 - 00:50:04.232, Speaker A: And then, like, I think, I don't. I don't want to, like, generalize, but I have heard that in Korea, a lot of the things that the investors focus on is gaming, and L1 S and Apdos has marketed itself as a new gaming l one. And so I think, like, naturally, there was a fit there. And so, for whatever reason, there's been a ton of retail buying in Korea of Apdos. And those guys, just like they are, they're very good at this. Then we've seen this in the past where, like, these tokens just go on crazy runs when this happens, and there's korean retail buying. And so I think the fit with the profile of the chain, with the fact that it was shorted, with the fact that the price had already gone up, with the fact that the unlocks were so far away, with the fact with the year end inflection, all created this confluence, which created the Apdos rally.
00:50:04.408 - 00:50:27.288, Speaker B: So this is something I didn't actually even realize is the connection with South Korea. But I have blockworks website pulled up here, and we just published an article that says, um, Aptos surge triggers flashbacks of Ripple's 2017 bull run shorting positions in the south korean crypto market might hold some answers to the token spike. And I pulled it up and the, uh, in South Korea, they just kicked off the jangle blockchain foundation week, which.
00:50:27.376 - 00:50:33.696, Speaker A: Is, this is the other thing that I was going to tell you, which is that there's actually the start of a series of hackathons. This is actually the reason that we.
00:50:33.720 - 00:50:36.964, Speaker B: Cover, and Aptos is really heavily promoted there, I guess. Right?
00:50:37.104 - 00:51:11.164, Speaker A: This is the reason that we covered. Thankfully, we figured this out was that there is the start of a whole series of at those hackathons. The first one is in Seoul on February 2, and it's going to be very promoted. There's going to be a lot of gaming announcements, et cetera. And so as soon as I realized there was this date on the calendar that people were eventually going to figure out and get behind, we cannot be short this until after that date at the absolute earliest. And, yeah, so all of those things. All of those things.
00:51:13.784 - 00:51:23.524, Speaker B: Okay, so, all right, so really interesting lessons learned from Apdos. How does this then apply to how you tackle, like, the l two trade?
00:51:26.504 - 00:51:55.014, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know that it's that necessarily related to the l two trade, but it certainly influences, like, how I think about sort of managing the fund just in general. Like, I'm constantly learning. Like, honestly, I think back, you know, we only launched 13 months ago, and I was, I had no experience managing a crypto fund, that. It was pretty funny timing, actually.
00:51:55.164 - 00:51:58.450, Speaker B: What did you tell? What were you pre crypto?
00:51:58.562 - 00:52:37.654, Speaker A: I did, I did five years at Morgan Stanley in a variety of roles, and then I did one year at Maverick as a. As a hedge fund analyst. I had some money management experience at Morgan Stanley because I ran a derivatives booked there for three years. But, like, we launched at the Pico, Pico, Pico, top of the market. Like, literally couldn't have timed it any better. Like, our initial mark on Ethan was 4650 on these first of 2021, and then ETH proceeded to go down 80% in a directly straight line over six months. And our whole thesis was the merge, right? So we obviously had a decent ETH allocation.
00:52:37.654 - 00:53:24.604, Speaker A: So, like, as I think back to that, there's so many lessons learned along the way. And then. But wait. But I never experienced a bottom. I never experienced, like, what a bottom looks like, how the market, like, trades on a bottom, because I'd only experienced not only from the top, and then this was the first sort of this, the year end like, that's why I said, like, I'm a little annoyed at myself. I didn't capitalize on it better, but, like, I was bullish and so I was, like, buying in December and I took the firm's net position up and I bought a lot of alts, but there was other things that I didn't do, which I should have done. In hindsight, it was obvious that the market was going to target the low float tokens, that everyone was short, but I hadn't had the experience to realize that.
00:53:24.604 - 00:54:00.354, Speaker A: That's the lesson learned from apdos. And I can talk about this because the next bottom is not going to be for many years, and anyone that watches this is going to have forgotten about it by the time we get there. I'm not giving up any alpha by saying it now, but when you get to bottoms like that and you have this, like, this really heavy sell pressure, and you can identify some reason why you think there's going to be an inflection, like, you actually don't want to buy the good tokens, because those are all tokens that have good tokenomics and have unlocked and whatever. They don't. They're not. They're not. They're.
00:54:00.354 - 00:54:39.194, Speaker A: They're hard to move. Like, we got somewhat fortunate in that we bought Solana and it pumped just because it pumped a lot, just because it had gone down so much. But, like, that wasn't actually the right profile of a token to buy. What you wanted to buy was these things that had extremely low float and other people were short, but I just didn't have that framework. So that's really the lesson that I learned. Does that apply to the reason that I say it doesn't necessarily apply to the l two trade? Is this different than the l two trade? The l two trade? I don't even know what the l two trade is, frankly, but to the extent it's buying l two s because they're going to launch, that's just a very different thing than what happened with Apdos.
00:54:39.734 - 00:54:57.246, Speaker B: It's a good lesson. I mean, let me then rephrase the question. Like, you believe in the ETH ecosystem, a lot of things will settle to probably l two s instead of l one instead of. Instead of ETH. Like, how do you think about, like, arbitrum versus optimism and, like, just the l two landscape? Yeah.
00:54:57.310 - 00:55:15.918, Speaker C: I also do just want to say, like, this is a great project, and I'm sure everyone's like, that support. Like, I love Ben Jones and what they're doing at optimism, but optimism is like the definition of that as well. It's got like $500 million circulating supply off a 11 billion fully diluted value. And op was a token that ripped as well. So I feel like that does fit that.
00:55:16.006 - 00:55:16.678, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:55:16.726 - 00:55:40.990, Speaker A: For the same reasons. Yeah, the same reasons. I was not short optimism because I was bullish on the e pico, but it was a short target for a lot of people. Like, people were shorted, it was low float. What happened? Like same thing, like optimism. GMT, dydx, apdos, Stargate, it doesn't matter. Any token, that was heavily shorted in low float.
00:55:40.990 - 00:55:46.758, Speaker A: They all ripped. Like, it didn't, it didn't matter what was going on. Like, that just shows you, like, this isn't about fundamentals, this is about.
00:55:46.846 - 00:56:01.534, Speaker B: But Hal, actually, let me dig in for a second there. Like when you say people are targeting the places that have shorts, that seems like a very like hedge fund, like a fund mentality, but then it's also like, okay, well, a lot of this rally and something like aptos is very retail south korean driven.
00:56:01.574 - 00:56:25.614, Speaker A: So like when you tells doing it too, like go on crypto Twitter. You go on crypto Twitter and people are talking about this. Like GCR tweeted this and it was correct. Right? Like everybody is aware of this dynamic and like, it's like, okay, who targeted the short squeeze in GameStop retail? Yeah, same thing.
00:56:25.734 - 00:56:26.926, Speaker C: That's really funny.
00:56:27.110 - 00:56:30.846, Speaker A: Yeah. Shit.
00:56:30.870 - 00:56:31.678, Speaker C: I had a question for you and.
00:56:31.686 - 00:56:32.518, Speaker B: I totally blanked high.
00:56:32.566 - 00:56:52.958, Speaker C: But let's talk about l two s, though, because that's like the next big. I've got sort of two more dynamics I want to cover with you. But like, what are your thoughts on? Sort of, look, it's, I mean, we're recording this on January 27. We're sort of like the heart of a bear. Right. And maybe, maybe price action is going to improve from here, which is, I think, Jason, my general framework. But like, it's going to probably be a bear, Mark.
00:56:53.126 - 00:56:57.892, Speaker A: Sorry. So you're telling me, so you're telling me it's time to sell? No, no.
00:56:57.988 - 00:57:01.572, Speaker C: Well, yeah, yeah, actually, yeah, I said it was time to buy, so, yeah, it's time to sell.
00:57:01.748 - 00:57:03.804, Speaker A: I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
00:57:03.924 - 00:57:22.344, Speaker C: No, I'm extremely reliable contraindicator. But there's still like a bear market left. And like when you kind of look out into the rise and about things that people are excited about, like l two s definitely, like you just kind of mentioned, like, l two s is something to be what are your sort of, what is your sort of general framework for when you think about the major L2s today and, like, how important of a sector is that going to be?
00:57:23.934 - 00:58:03.934, Speaker A: I think it's going to be extremely relevant. I think it's going to be relevant for ETH and I think it's going to be relevant for the l two s. I think I'm a little, like, skeptical long term of the l two tokens, because there's going to be so many of them competing for the same mind share, whereas there's only ever going to be one. Ethan. So if you're asking me like, my five year view, do I think optimism outperforms ETH? Like, definitely not. I think ETH outperforms all of them over any long period of time. Doesn't mean that there won't be trades to be had.
00:58:03.934 - 00:59:06.554, Speaker A: I don't have very strong views about sort of, like, which l two is going to win, for which reason, and like, which ones you should be buying. I'd say my stronger view is just that. I think when you have Arbitrum launched, optimism launched, Matic launched, Zksync launched, Starkware launched, all promoting the adoption of their chain on ETH, all trying to onboard new people, paying people for partnerships on their chain. That is going to be a powerful dynamic in terms of bringing users to the Ethereum ecosystem. If Arbitrum onboards a user that wasn't in crypto, it's very likely that that user is going to buy RB and also buy ETH. And so you're basically getting these free marketing budgets from all the chains built on ETH. And I think that's going to be a powerful dynamic for ETH itself.
00:59:08.434 - 00:59:41.084, Speaker C: I would agree with that. I agree with that. I have one thought and idea to run by you here, because I think it's worth talking about. And just for the end state of crypto, where does the user value capture occur right now? People say people are users of Ethereum today. I think most people might agree that ten years from now, people aren't going to be users of Ethereum. Right? Like people are ultimately going to use apps. You don't think so?
00:59:43.384 - 00:59:47.616, Speaker A: I think there will still be users. I think it will be whales mainly, but there will still be users.
00:59:47.760 - 00:59:55.672, Speaker C: Okay, well, I guess, like, the point I was trying is, like, most people will come to, like, I'll tell you.
00:59:55.688 - 01:00:03.308, Speaker A: That I will concede what I think the point you're trying to make is, like, it won't be super widespread mainstream adoption. Yeah.
01:00:03.476 - 01:00:11.644, Speaker C: Yeah, that's that's, like, ultimately ETH. If you think about ETH's business model as selling block space, then they'll do that to other blockchains and, like, whales that want to transact.
01:00:11.684 - 01:00:20.024, Speaker A: Right. So I think your question is, like, what is the use that the mainstream adoption is going to come to crypto for?
01:00:21.124 - 01:00:27.740, Speaker C: I guess I'm asking you to. This is a really tough question, but, like, let's say there's a value chain of, like, there's an app that a lot of people use.
01:00:27.772 - 01:00:27.964, Speaker A: Just.
01:00:28.004 - 01:00:41.764, Speaker C: It probably won't. It might be this, but, like, let's say it's a decentralized exchange that maybe, like, is a roll app, right? Kind of like a layer three that would set. Would go down to a L2 that ultimately then gets routed to ETH. Where is this, the value capture accrue?
01:00:41.804 - 01:00:42.004, Speaker A: Right.
01:00:42.044 - 01:00:47.064, Speaker C: Like, across that chain. Do you see what I'm saying?
01:00:47.684 - 01:01:06.152, Speaker A: Yes. So you're saying there's a decentralized exchange built on optimism. They charge a user $10 to do a trade in a commission. How much of that value accrues to decentralized exchange? How much of that value accrues to optimism? How much of that value accrues to e?
01:01:06.328 - 01:01:08.084, Speaker C: That's exactly what I'm asking you.
01:01:08.424 - 01:01:38.230, Speaker A: So, I think the majority. There's two buckets. There's, like, the trading revenue. So, like, if you pay $10 in commission, that's, like, their trading revenue. The majority of that is going to recruit to the app layer. Like, when DydX was built. Actually, this is a perfect example.
01:01:38.230 - 01:01:41.638, Speaker A: Right? Because DyDX was built on starkware. Starkware, yeah. Yeah.
01:01:41.806 - 01:01:42.086, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:42.110 - 01:02:18.568, Speaker A: So that was the example. So the majority of the value when a user paid went to DyDX, and then some minority of that went to starkware for facilitating. And then what? Went to starkware. Starkware had to pay some portion of that to ETH for settlement. And I think. So I actually don't know the exact numbers, but I have seen them in the past, and I, if I recall correctly, of that second bucket, more value accrues to ETH than the l two. But it's, like, in the same order of magnitude.
01:02:18.568 - 01:02:51.304, Speaker A: We call it, like, 60 40. And then the majority of value, though, accrues to the app layer. However, there's only one ETH, and then there's ten l two s, and then there's 100 apps on all the l two s. So, yes, each one of those 100 is going to generate the majority of the value, but they're all going to contribute to the l two, and then all the l two s are going to contribute to either. So ETH is only going to get a small portion of each individual transaction, but they will see a cut of every transaction.
01:02:53.204 - 01:03:36.306, Speaker C: The reason I was asking is for another podcast was doing research on aggregation theory, if you've heard of that, by Ben Thompson. There was an idea in there called the smiling curve. And the smiling curve is a dynamic used to describe the pc industry in the early days. And it's called a smile because like if you divide up like R and D over here at the beginning of the production of PCs, then there's fabrication in the middle, then there's like brand and consumer, like the interaction with the actual customer. The way value would accrue was a smile, whereas there was actually a lot of value in owning the relationship with the customer. There was a lot of value in the R and D and patents and everything at the beginning and nothing in the middle. Nothing in the middle.
01:03:36.306 - 01:03:45.514, Speaker C: They just got smoked. And it was highly commoditized. And like, honestly, when we described like these dynamics, I could sort of see that playing out, you know what I mean?
01:03:45.554 - 01:04:52.136, Speaker A: And, yeah, so that's an interesting point. I do think the app layer is going to generate a lot of the value, and I do think ETH is going to generate a lot of it. That's kind of like the two ends of the smile and the l two s are more like questionable. But I actually think, and this is an important point that I think we should discuss, which is that like, I actually don't know how much it matters for ETH, specifically how much value they capture. Because like I said, I actually think of ETH as competing for the decentralized SoV market cap too, which is arguably like bigger than this sum of future cash flows from staking market cap. And I also think that ethanol has a tremendous amount of value just from being adopted and used as collateral for a variety of things, right? Like, if you own ETH to buy nfts that are denominated in ETH, which everybody does, that provides value to ETH. That has nothing to do with how much fees ETH generates.
01:04:52.136 - 01:05:36.684, Speaker A: And if you buy ETH, because ETH is a decentralized SoV a la bitcoin, that value also has nothing to do with how much money ETH generates. So I think I'm hesitant to focus too entirely on it, because it's not really the most important point. It's a part of the value proposition, but it's not the only one. And I mean, this can sound contradictory to the fact that I say that all one s don't have a lot of value because they don't generate fees. The difference is alt L1 s also don't have a native ecosystem that requires the l one token, and they also don't have decentralization that allows people to buy them as decentralized sovs. So in their case, it is the only actual source of value and they happen to generate none of it. But for ETH, it has the other sources of value, so it is actually relevant.
01:05:36.684 - 01:06:27.858, Speaker A: So those two aren't actually necessarily contradictory. But, yeah, I just want to make that point. Ultimately, I don't think ETH is going to stay deflationary. I think l one fees will compress and ETH price will go up, and it'll probably reach some steady state of very minor inflation, like less than 1%. But as long as it's adopted for those other utilities, as long as it keeps being used and the ecosystem keeps growing and the economy keeps growing, I still think that the price can perform very well. And another reason for that is that this is really a key point, is that ETH emissions are very different than bitcoin emissions because they go, because one is proof of stake and one is proof of work, right? If you're a staker, you just, like, buy a liquid staking derivative. You have no cost.
01:06:27.858 - 01:07:01.562, Speaker A: Like, when I get paid, like, I have, I manage whatever I manage for the fund, and then I also have my own personal crypto investments that I just, like, don't. I don't ever trade my pa because I don't want to conflict with the fund. But, like, I own some crypto assets for like, ten years, 20 years, 30 years that I'm just, like, never touching. And ETH is the. Is the main one that I own. And, like, I obviously own a version of staked ethnic, but I'm never like, oh, crap, I need to sell my staking rewards because I paid expenses to get them. So the emissions that people get from staking rewards don't actually end up hitting the open market for the most part.
01:07:01.562 - 01:07:20.144, Speaker A: But with bitcoin, the emissions that miners get, they all end up hitting the open market because they all have tons of expenses they need to cover, and so they all need to sell them. And so even if ETH is slightly inflationary, that doesn't mean it has net supply. It actually still has net demand as long as the fee pool is significant because that issuance is not actually being sold.
01:07:23.044 - 01:07:32.104, Speaker C: I think that that's a super compelling argument. By the way, I think that was, I think that you sort of made me change my mind on that, that idea. It's a very super important dynamic.
01:07:33.084 - 01:07:36.540, Speaker A: Well, happy to help, Hal.
01:07:36.732 - 01:07:58.354, Speaker B: I want to maybe end it with this question, which is, because I know we got to jump in a second here. Things we're talking about today is like long ETH excited about liquid staking derivatives, talking about l two s. Is there anything that's maybe less? I would say those three things are very in the narrative, very talked about today. Is there anything else that you're really excited about that are maybe more on the fringes?
01:07:59.134 - 01:08:50.944, Speaker A: I think the most contrarian take I have recently is about DyDX. I think DyDX is another hated token because it's been a terrible, valueless governance token and most people hate it. And it has this low flow dynamic. However, I mean, we can talk about this one quickly because I think people will find it interesting. But I have long thought that if you could get a good app layer token that actually has product market fit, actually generates revenue and actually returns that revenue to users in an efficient fashion, it would be super powerful. And I think an exemplification of this is GMX. GMX has a lot of flaws, but it fits those buckets.
01:08:50.944 - 01:09:32.230, Speaker A: And because it does, it's been an extremely successful token. And I think DyDX has the potential to be that supercharged. Because DyDX is by far the market leader, has by far the best ux, and is now seemingly very committed to solving the other issues that have held them back. So the fact that they delayed the token unlock a year tells you a lot. Like the team is willing to work with investors and can see the vision and they don't want to sell here. They know what's being built and they know that the token is going to be worth a lot more in the future once they complete the vision. And so I think that's a really strong reaffirmation.
01:09:32.230 - 01:10:09.320, Speaker A: And then like, I think v three is probably going to come in the third quarter. Once v three comes, it's going to fit the description of what I just outlined. Assuming they execute for like the first time in this, in this entire kind of industry, whereas like they generated $350 million of revenue, even at current value, it's a $2 billion fdv. Like the actual market cap is like sub 350 million, but the FDV itself is 2 billion. So they're going to be trading seven times real revenue. That's unheard of in this industry. And all that revenue is going to accrue back to the token holders.
01:10:09.320 - 01:11:02.650, Speaker A: The vision is that when they create the new chain on Cosmos, you're going to be able to get a DYDX token, which, by the way, then will be an l one, and we'll have some l one premium re rating. Second of all, all the rewards are going to flow back to validators, so you're actually going to receive the yield. And that's also another way to solve the regulatory issue. You're not turning on a fee switch, you're just returning revenue to the stakers. That's the ability to bypass that regulation via creating an l one. And then on top of that, nobody owns it because everyone was scared away by the fact that there was this massive unlock. So all these funds that are desperately searching for an application layer token that they can own, that actually has valuation support, that actually has utility, that actually has product market fit, well, you're potentially going to see one exist for the first time in eight months and no one owns it.
01:11:02.650 - 01:11:33.034, Speaker A: And it's super low float and it's super illiquid and like, everyone hates it. So I think, like, I don't know whether this is going to work or not, but as a fund, we just have a position now that we've, that we've accumulated that's like, I'm just putting this away and I'm forgetting about it and I'll come back in eight months and see what's happened with this launch. But there's like massive potential here. In my opinion. That's a pretty contrarian take. I don't think a lot of people have kind of articulated that.
01:11:33.734 - 01:11:44.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. One more thing just to. Sorry, I know Jason said it was going to be the last question, but just to, like you talked about, sort of one of the dynamics, like pumping crypto right now, is the change in rate regimes.
01:11:44.654 - 01:11:44.830, Speaker A: Right?
01:11:44.862 - 01:11:46.726, Speaker C: Like, everyone sees inflation rolling over and.
01:11:46.790 - 01:11:49.114, Speaker A: We can talk about macro for a minute if you want.
01:11:49.614 - 01:12:19.564, Speaker C: Could we just close it on that? Because it seems if I had to outline a macro thesis, it would be that we're going to get stop start inflation. This is the classic thing that happens in inflationary periods. There's a cyclical rollover in inflation. It's largely gas prices and stuff like that. Then we'll ease rates before we should necessarily. And then it tends to rise up. And also, like, we haven't even seen a lot of the impacts that you would have thought that you would see.
01:12:19.564 - 01:12:34.972, Speaker C: Some from such intense monetary contraction. Like housing hasn't gone down, the labor market hasn't gone down or, like, hasn't been disrupted. So, like, do you see. And earnings haven't dropped at all, or earnings have been, like, pretty steady state. So, like, what, do you see any, like, macro overhang here that concerns you or.
01:12:34.988 - 01:12:43.172, Speaker A: No. So the issue with this question is that we could spend another hour and a half discussing. I know, dude, I'm sorry. I know.
01:12:43.268 - 01:12:44.744, Speaker C: Can of worms right at the end.
01:12:46.554 - 01:13:33.774, Speaker A: But I've got ten minutes. So there's, like, a lot of, there's a lot of different things to break down. And I don't want to, like, ramble too much on macro and, like, bore people at the end of this. But I'll give you my. I'll try to give you my condensed take. I think at the crux of this is inflation and trying to understand what is inflation, what drove inflation, and then trying to use those inputs to forecast future inflation. So the first part of the question is, what actually is inflation? So I think a lot of times, people confuse inflation with prices.
01:13:33.774 - 01:13:58.362, Speaker A: Those are not the same thing. Inflation is not an absolute price gauge. Inflation is the rate of change of the price gauge. So for inflation to moderate, you do not need prices to moderate. Prices are not going to moderate. And people, I think, confuse that with thinking that inflation is not going to moderate. Like, I think a lot of people think prices are never coming back down.
01:13:58.362 - 01:14:21.444, Speaker A: And so inflation is going to be like structures. We don't need prices to come down. We just need them to stop going up. And then inflation goes to zero. And if you get even prices to tick down off the very picotop, that's actually deflation. Like, if price goes up 20% and then drops 1%, you have deflation. And so I think that's an important first point.
01:14:21.444 - 01:15:02.404, Speaker A: Then the second point is what's actually driven this inflation? And I think there's been really two main forces. One was COVID. For 30 years, we had structurally declining inflation. And in my opinion, that was driven by a lot of structural forces, most importantly, population dynamics, which, by the way, ain't changing. And then all of a sudden, you had this massive surge in inflation. And I think clearly that indicates an acute driver, not some change in structural dynamics. And what was the acute driver? COVID.
01:15:02.404 - 01:15:27.284, Speaker A: So COVID created inflation for a variety of reasons. First of all, it crimped. So inflation is really just like so many things in markets. It's just a product of supply and demand. It's just either more buyers of the asset or more sellers of the asset. And then that determines whether price goes up or down. And so when you think about it in that lens, COVID did two things.
01:15:27.284 - 01:16:00.956, Speaker A: It crimps demand. It made it harder for factories to get together and produce stuff. It created supply bottlenecks, which all had an impact of reducing supply. And then it also boosted demand. And it boosted demand in a variety of ways. One, it forced people to be stuck at home. So they bought all kinds of different things that they wouldn't normally buy, including new homes and, like, computer electronics and home furniture and whatever dogs, like, people just bought all kinds of things.
01:16:00.956 - 01:17:05.754, Speaker A: And then another reason that they did that was because there was this initial perception that COVID was going to create a very hard economic period because it was causing unemployment and all this disruption, et cetera, which, by the way, didn't actually turn out to be the case because the society very quickly learned to adapt and deal with COVID But this 19 was the view. And because of this view, it gave central banks a green light to implement extreme, easy monetary policy. And this had an effect of massively supercharging demand. So they one handed people tons and tons of free money, which was, like, crazy. But then they also took interest rates to zero. And then on top of that, started printing more money. So, like, they did everything you could possibly do to supercharge demand at a time when demand was already being supercharged by the structural shift of COVID And then this all happened at the same time that supply was crimped.
01:17:05.754 - 01:17:47.144, Speaker A: So you created, like, the perfect storm to see prices astronomically rise for everything. And that's what happened. Prices went bananas on everything. You can look at price of any good, and it just was, like, on a trend. And then went, like, straight up into the right extremely quickly. And that's kind of where we are, right? And that creates a very dislocated price that takes prices to a very unnatural level because of that supply demand dynamic. But then what's happened since? So COVID is now basically over, right? I go around, I don't even see anyone wearing a mask.
01:17:47.144 - 01:18:11.116, Speaker A: Everyone in factories is back to 100%. Like, actually, now you actually. This is one of the things, like, things tend to overshoot, right? You create all this artificial demand, and then all these places start building the capacity to handle it, and then the demand disappears. But they still have all the capacity, right? So now everything is actually oversupplied. Like, well, oversupplied. It's actually timely that you ask about this, because I used to be a semiconductor analyst. Intel had their earnings.
01:18:11.116 - 01:18:44.220, Speaker A: They're one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Litmus test for sort of supply demand bottlenecks. They said they are seeing, and this is a quote, the largest inventory correction in history. So you now have massive oversupply, and so that's on your supply end of the equation. And then what happened on the demand end of the equation? Rates are the highest they've been in a decade. Federal policy is the tightest it's been in a decade.
01:18:44.220 - 01:19:24.314, Speaker A: They're draining money from the system, and everybody just spent all their savings on buying all this new shit they don't actually need, and now have no more appetite to buy anything. So your demand has, like, fallen off a cliff and supply has gone through the roof. And this has happened at the same time that prices have been dislocated to a level that's, like, completely unnatural to the upside. So for me, and I've had this view for a very long time, before it was like consensus to think this. It's becoming more consensus now as it plays out. But I've been talking about this for the better part of seven months. It's pretty obvious to me that that's going to lead to deflation.
01:19:24.314 - 01:19:43.838, Speaker A: Like, prices are actually going to come down. It's not that they're just going to go up more slowly, they're going to come down. And we've actually already started to see this. So I tweet this all the time. Like, used car prices are a perfect example. They were on a trend, hadn't moved in ten years. All of a sudden, magically they go up to 30%.
01:19:43.838 - 01:20:18.662, Speaker A: What do you think is going to happen when the dynamics that drove that 30% increase reverse? They're going to come down. And what's happening? They're coming down. Home prices coming down. Computer, electronics products coming down, food prices coming down, commodity prices coming down, freight rates coming down. Every price, asset prices coming down, they're all going to come down. And so now that, like, if you understand what inflation is, it's the rate of change of the price, not the absolute level of the price. The price is not going to come back down to where it was, but it is going to stop going up, and that is going to create deflation.
01:20:18.662 - 01:21:00.686, Speaker A: And more than that, there's going to be some, like, adjustment period and it'll settle out. But there's simply no reason that any of the structural dynamics have changed. As a matter of fact, population demographics have actually probably accelerated and we just built out all this excess capacity that we don't actually need. So it's very hard for me to see any justification for why we would have structurally higher inflation after this episode. I think you have a blip up, a blip down, and then right back to the trend that you had before. I can't think of any reason why it would happen any other different way. And so in that context, I actually don't think it's going to be this big battle to get inflation down.
01:21:00.686 - 01:21:45.328, Speaker A: I think pretty soon you're going to be hearing people worried more about deflation than inflation and that's going to allow central banks to stop being as tight and that's just going to lead to resumption of the previous dynamics that we had. That has been my base case for a very long time, continues to be my base case today. I could be wrong, but that's what I think. And that's been a very contrarian view. And a lot of people tell me I'm stupid and naive because I don't understand how business cycles work and that's never how it works, but that's how I think it's going to happen. And also I think people don't give central banks enough credit. I actually think Jerome Powell has done a pretty good job.
01:21:45.328 - 01:22:30.178, Speaker A: Okay, yes, he made mistakes, but he has a freaking hard job and a very thankless one at that. And I think they do a better job than they get credit for and they are more competent than people give them credit for. And I actually think they will be able to handle this. Like people say, how are you sure that inflation is going to come down? Because the Fed's not going to let it keep going up. They have the tools to bring it down and they're going to bring it down. And then who's going to manage the soft landing? The same competent people that are going to bring inflation down. Now I actually think that Jerome and the whole Fed team is done a better job than people want to give them credit for, will continue to do a better job than people give them credit for, and will actually accomplish this.
01:22:30.178 - 01:22:43.134, Speaker A: And it's not going to be a straight line. That doesn't mean risk assets are going to go straight up into the right forever. But in twelve months time, I think we're going to be in a lot more of a settled, stable monetary regime than we are right now.
01:22:45.394 - 01:22:59.682, Speaker C: I agree. Yeah, I think that's honestly a super fair take. And I agree with that point that the Fed deserves more credit than people give. I mean, they navigated this like could have gone a lot worse when the whole world shut down. I appreciate you indulging my question there at the end.
01:22:59.698 - 01:23:03.354, Speaker A: How. No worries. It took exactly ten minutes. Yeah.
01:23:03.514 - 01:23:09.174, Speaker B: This is great, man. Thank you for coming on. This is awesome. Um, and appreciate you coming on.
01:23:09.714 - 01:23:11.274, Speaker A: No worries. Thanks for having me.
01:23:11.354 - 01:23:11.914, Speaker B: Yeah, man.
01:23:11.994 - 01:23:12.274, Speaker A: Take care.
