00:00:00.520 - 00:00:28.970, Speaker A: The anxiety that you will feel, which then comes at the detriment of everything else in your life. If you're trying to chase every single narrative, I don't think can be overstated. If you're a full time trader, sure, it makes sense. If you are anything else, a founder, a builder, you don't work in crypto. It's just your hobby. If you try to chase every single narrative, you will drive yourself and everyone around you mad. If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain.
00:00:28.970 - 00:01:10.112, Speaker A: And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain. To put it nicely, that is why we are incredibly excited to have the wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast, stewards of the wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show, we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole NFT. Just for empire listeners, this episode is brought to you by PayPal here at Empire. You know that Santee and I are really into real world use cases and always on the lookout for the next killer blockchain app. We're excited to share that PayPal has arrived in crypto to unveil a way to seamlessly connect fiat to digital currencies.
00:01:10.112 - 00:01:31.620, Speaker A: Later in the show, you will find out how you can use PyUsd to check out at millions of online stores. All right, everyone eat. Denver weekend. Santi and I are not at Denver. We stayed home to make sure we could get a good podcast in for you. So, Santi, how you doing, man?
00:01:31.812 - 00:01:34.716, Speaker B: Konnichiwa. I'm doing great. How are you?
00:01:34.860 - 00:01:41.744, Speaker A: I think you gotta give some context around that, or that is going to seem quite odd to people.
00:01:42.484 - 00:02:19.794, Speaker B: I'm in Tokyo attempting to run the Tokyo marathon this Sunday, and I say attempting because I have. I've been nursing this shin, splint and ankle pain, but I finally, today I had this breakthrough where I figured out what it was like. The worst is being in pain and not knowing what it is. Because sometimes pain can, like, start. You feel like you have knee pain, but the real issue is like your hip or something else, biomechanically. And I just felt a huge relief. 2 hours before recording this pod, I'm like, oh, it's here.
00:02:19.794 - 00:02:48.570, Speaker B: And then, like, the mind just plays weird tricks on you. Every time I'm running a marathon, like, leading up to it, it just. It's mental gains, which is kind of nice because it's so. It's a bit distracting to what is going on in crypto? I'm kind of focused on running the race. And actually, if I don't run it, if, like, Sunday morning, I wake up and I'm just not feeling it, or I start running and I'm not feeling it, I'm prepared to just walk away, which is important.
00:02:48.642 - 00:02:51.414, Speaker A: I feel like it's a good mindset.
00:02:51.874 - 00:02:55.722, Speaker B: Yeah. So a lot of joy, a lot.
00:02:55.738 - 00:03:02.654, Speaker A: Of complaints seem to come around, around these marathons. Sick in the last one. Some shin splint made up thing.
00:03:03.834 - 00:03:09.178, Speaker B: Hey, I don't know, man. I'm, you know, I'm getting old, I guess. How old?
00:03:09.226 - 00:03:13.014, Speaker A: How old are you? How old are you? Are you. Will you dox that?
00:03:13.054 - 00:03:22.238, Speaker B: This is zero knowledge proof. I am above 30, below 35. So I'll let listeners try to guess.
00:03:22.366 - 00:03:24.662, Speaker A: Nice. Cool.
00:03:24.758 - 00:03:30.166, Speaker B: We're not meant to run marathons. I think people forget. It's become this huge popular.
00:03:30.230 - 00:03:33.114, Speaker A: Do you read the book about running barefoot?
00:03:34.254 - 00:03:59.394, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, it's documented in my hometown, my home country, Mexico, the tarahumara. And it's kind of wild. I've seen people do, in certain marathons, you see all kinds of wild people that are like, there's a guy that always runs with a pineapple on his head. There's people that run barefoot. I don't know. I prefer to run on my carbon plated Nike shoes that make me feel like I'm going to run 2 seconds faster.
00:04:01.174 - 00:04:07.616, Speaker A: Fair enough. Yeah. That's what I would be on to. I'm like, give me the. Give me those good shoes. Yeah. So eat Denver week.
00:04:07.616 - 00:04:12.444, Speaker A: Why did you, um. So did you skip it for the marathon or you. You're not a big conference guy in general?
00:04:13.544 - 00:04:38.268, Speaker B: No. Although e Denver historically has been a good conference. Um, there's a lot of people there. Uh, got so many, like, hey, are you in Denver? Um, there's some really good panels. I'll probably be. What I like to do is I'll go to YouTube and, like, listen to some of the, um, uh, you know, panels in two x speed. Because the reality is sometimes when you're in these conferences, you can't even, like, listen.
00:04:38.268 - 00:04:54.268, Speaker B: Well, the setup is not great. They're all spread across the city, and so. And it also, like, you're catching up with people, so you miss a lot of the panels. But I like to go to one or two conferences a year because it's kind of important to meet people in real life.
00:04:54.396 - 00:05:00.964, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. No, it is. It is. You've got some. That's how you met Stani. Right? And did the.
00:05:01.044 - 00:05:32.974, Speaker B: Yes. So I credit my best trade, one of my best trades to going to actually out here before COVID The last DEf Con before COVID was in Osaka. And it was actually, I was thinking a lot about that this week. Not only like this playlist of 2021 came about and it was literally was like reminding me of the exact same moment. Devcon, Osaka. I was applying to a 16 z crypto while at the same time talking to Bennett parafy.
00:05:33.594 - 00:05:39.810, Speaker A: And this can have been 2021. You mean 20. It must be way early. Yeah.
00:05:39.842 - 00:05:47.306, Speaker B: 22. The playlist is a bit tricky, but yeah, 2020. I say 2019. 2020. I think it was 2019 or 2020. Right.
00:05:47.450 - 00:05:48.974, Speaker A: When did you join paraphy?
00:05:49.754 - 00:06:05.734, Speaker B: 20. Great question. We talked for like six, seven months before I officially joined. And in that process, I was applying a 16 c because they were looking for a partner and I got pretty far there. They didn't end up hiring me. They hired Ariana.
00:06:06.954 - 00:06:10.174, Speaker A: Oh, is you versus Ariana. I have a funny Ariana story, actually.
00:06:10.994 - 00:06:15.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I do too. Shout out to Ariana. She's great.
00:06:16.034 - 00:06:34.808, Speaker A: She was running a. She was running a bidet company or something. Oh, no, she was running a. Before she joined a 16 Z, she was running a. You know, she had her different fund that like, kind of got absorbed into Andreessen, if you remember that. And we, we want her to speak at like one of the first blockworks events. And I think the company was called tushy.
00:06:34.808 - 00:06:50.076, Speaker A: So I just cold emailed her like every week and was just like, got poop. Because, you know, no, no one knew. No one knew blockworks. No one would respond to Mike and I. We had to do ridiculous stuff to get people to respond. So we sent that like ten times. And then she finally was like, please stop.
00:06:50.076 - 00:06:51.704, Speaker A: Please stop emailing me.
00:06:53.004 - 00:07:16.064, Speaker B: It's an important, like, pause there because we both, if you go back not too long ago, this is 2020. We're talking about 2019. It feels like we're nobody. You're lost. You feel like you're. I felt at the time like I was writing a lot. I was coming through, trying to document and learn from my mistakes.
00:07:16.064 - 00:08:01.114, Speaker B: From 2018, I've done incredibly well, but kind of I wanted to feel like I didn't, was not feeling very relevant and I wanted to have a bigger impact. I felt that joining a 16 Z would be a good move because I think they have one of the best microphones as a tier one vc firm. Being the most aggressive in crypto at the time, I felt that it was great opportunity for me to kind of jump into, like, a step function. And really, I don't know, they had great podcasts. Like, I love writing. I'm like, okay, this could be a great move. But it was like, you feel like you're a bit like lost because no one cares about crypto.
00:08:01.114 - 00:08:30.644, Speaker B: But going to conferences at the time was like the best thing that for me was to meet people. And in that process, I. It was right before I joined parafy, just coming back to the story of Defcon, and there was like 20 booths in Defcon and Ave was one of them and it was Ethel and at the time, but they still had that cute little ghost. And I was like, well, this is interesting. And so I. I met Stein. He was like sitting in the booth by himself.
00:08:30.644 - 00:09:03.094, Speaker B: And it was my second deal, paraphy. The first one was Kyber, but it was the same strategy at the time. It was like redesigning the tokens so that you would reward only stakers, not everyone, because a lot of these tokens were in exchanges run like finance after the ICos. And you're like, well, you probably should reward active participants. And at the time, it seems so obvious now. And anyways, it was probably one of the best deals that I've done. Lend was at like 5 million market cap or something like that.
00:09:03.094 - 00:09:27.254, Speaker B: And it was hard to buy. So we had to, we had to go direct, we had to go OTC and convince Stani and the team that we were the right partner for them, put in a lot of work to convince him. And it was a great journey and I'm excited to go to London just to bring it full circle to conferences because I will grab dinner with Stani, who's one of my closest friends in crypto, I'd say.
00:09:27.954 - 00:09:47.374, Speaker A: Yeah, they had a bad announcement this week, so lens is now fully permissionless. I think they had their biggest or one of their biggest signup days ever, actually. Yeah. Shout out to them, man. Markets ripping this week. We've got a calm energy for what this week has looked like. So bitcoin ran up to, I think it touched 64, maybe hit 63.
00:09:47.374 - 00:09:51.334, Speaker A: Five. Yeah, Coinbase went down for a little.
00:09:51.374 - 00:09:57.310, Speaker B: Bit, for a little bit. Zero balances on their account.
00:09:57.462 - 00:10:07.104, Speaker A: Yeah, we're seeing zero balances, but that, I mean, that is about as clear of a sign as you can have that the market is coming back, is when, is when Coinbase fits us out for a little.
00:10:08.804 - 00:10:35.462, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. It's been interesting. The, over the last couple days have been having good conversations with the folks of like Jason Maple Leaf capital, who's been on the pod, again, a great thinker. He's out here in Asia at least. And we were just talking about his positioning. He was actually fully deployed in October, and he was telling me, look, I felt uncomfortable.
00:10:35.462 - 00:11:07.704, Speaker B: And we were talking about the relative opportunity of going more, doing more private deals versus liquid, and in what ratio you would allocate to your top three, four positions, how we would think this cycle would play out. It was just a really good discussion. I love talking to folks like Jason. There's a couple people that I go to to rebound certain ideas. But, yeah, everything's well. I don't want to, like, dictate the. How we take this conversation.
00:11:07.704 - 00:11:40.530, Speaker B: One of the things that I try to pay attention. Two things. One, the relative outperformance. So when bitcoin does ten, you know, 10%, 7%, what is the relative beta on a one day, seven day, 14 day, 30 day period of some of the other things that I like and how do those behave? And the reason I look at different timescales is because, as we all know, oftentimes bitcoin rallies, first it stabilized, it sets a new level, and then everything else kind of flows.
00:11:40.562 - 00:11:40.682, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:40.698 - 00:12:15.958, Speaker B: It's in the eats, souls of the world and then alts in that sort of sequence. But, yeah, I sometimes wonder, like, why certain things are underperforming. Like, you know, narratives like AI are such clean bets because there's not a lot of baggage from the prior cycle. It's. It's somewhat mean because a lot of these things are not, like, really have much traction. It's just sort of like a very hot narrative, similar to meme coins. Also, bitcoin is like the ultimate meme coin.
00:12:15.958 - 00:12:52.514, Speaker B: And I was talking to someone else, like Jordan, who's ex synthetics, and we were talking about just what bitcoin can do, the cycle that it hasn't. That hasn't done in prior cycles because of the ETF. Anyways, a lot to talk about. I'll pause here, but just giving you some ideas of the things that I'm thinking about. The other one is, I think people have already caught up to this idea that the ETF was certainly not priced in. So again, what is now people are thinking about, okay, there's the sequences. Probably an ETH ETF, and then how do you play that?
00:12:52.934 - 00:13:24.882, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think, look, bitcoin is about, what, 10% away from, 5% away from full price discovery mode. It seems like it's. You start to feel that time in the market when things are entering real price discovery, and it feels like, we're kind of on the precipice of that. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw an all time high in March for bitcoin. Um, I think, uh, there's a couple things going on. Like, people are pretty shocked by these all time, by, um, by the, uh, the ETF flows. So that's obviously the.
00:13:24.882 - 00:13:53.454, Speaker A: One of the big things. Um, it's. We'll talk about the uniswap governance, uh, the uniswap fee switch, and, um. But it seems like Coinbase may have won this big case behind the scenes, which we can talk about in a little bit. Um, and, yeah, this ETF. So, I mean, I had some conversations with people over the weekend who, it seems at this point, there's, like, a greater than 50% chance this ETF gets approved in May. Um, and that's a.
00:13:53.454 - 00:13:55.494, Speaker A: In May. Yeah.
00:13:56.834 - 00:13:57.338, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:13:57.386 - 00:14:13.386, Speaker A: I mean, I know nothing. I truly know nothing. I just spoke with folks who. No way more than I do, and they said, look, they'd put it at, you know, probably 55 45 or 60 40 that an ETF gets approved in May. So, yeah, I mean, it's cool to see this happen. It's. You know what it is? It's.
00:14:13.386 - 00:14:49.584, Speaker A: You remember when Solana was running this fall and I kind of said, I was like, look, this is great. It doesn't feel like a proper rally, though. It doesn't feel like. It feels almost more like the 2019. You remember the binance Ieo run when, like, coins ripped, but then, like, pulled back a little bit and it's kind of quiet for a little and there's consolidation. I was like, that bull run reminded me a little more of what that felt like in 2019. What's happening now reminds me of the early days of 2020 after COVID or in, like, you know, third week of March, 4 week of March after Black Tuesday.
00:14:49.584 - 00:14:59.464, Speaker A: It's a proper bitcoin led rally, which is like, almost every rally is every time it should be, I guess I would say.
00:14:59.854 - 00:15:05.374, Speaker B: There's no. There hasn't been a single rally. It hasn't started with bitcoin rally. It's the nature of fun flows.
00:15:05.414 - 00:15:06.014, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:06.174 - 00:15:33.554, Speaker B: There's also not been a single cycle where you're 10% of the top of the prior top, and it doesn't get blown past that in every prior cycle. Once you get to 10% of revisiting the prior cycles top. Kudos to Xiao, who brought this to my attention. You blow through it. So I. I'm of. I'm still operating under the mind that this year will be very positive for just markets.
00:15:33.554 - 00:16:05.134, Speaker B: Crypto as well. Very much risk on. And Solana is interesting, obviously, the esol ratio has gone down. What is it, 40% since, to quote some of the, some of the good trolls out there, that we were hyperventilating the Solana narrative. And now we've been quieter. I continuously remind people that most of my portfolio is still ETH centric. But I like to talk about things that are catching my attention.
00:16:05.134 - 00:16:18.624, Speaker B: And I still believe that there's no reason why Solana can't reach Ethereum's market cap. I still hold that. So, you know, am I coping? No.
00:16:20.044 - 00:16:21.224, Speaker A: Am I crying?
00:16:21.684 - 00:17:16.798, Speaker B: I think the. No, I mean, I think, look, my portfolio is certainly outperforming Solana because it's still very much publicly look at the things that I've invested most of the best l two s on the seed rounds and I'm still very much, you know, holds Ethereum, so. And Ethereum exposure in the ecosystem, so. But yeah, I think the, a lot of the big market participants are heavy, overweight ethereum at the moment, just given the narrative, like a lot of them probably missed. And you see this time and time again, if you miss a big narrative like the ETF for bitcoin, then. And if you're seeing the price action for bitcoin and the fund flows into bitcoin being a three times larger asset than Ethereum. More.
00:17:16.798 - 00:17:41.410, Speaker B: Right. Four now. But I'm thinking about like at the time of pre ETF, then imagine what the price action does to Ethereum, not only because it's a smaller asset base, so you're starting from a smaller base. So the incremental flows into an ETF of Ethereum has a probably a bigger impact, but also the proof of stake component of it. Like there's just less float out there.
00:17:41.562 - 00:17:44.002, Speaker A: Yeah. So those two things.
00:17:44.138 - 00:17:48.050, Speaker B: Anyways, I think a lot of folks might are piling onto this trade.
00:17:48.202 - 00:18:10.474, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. So I laid out this tweet. I had a real bull market tweet here where it's got, it's got 985,000 views, almost 5000 likes. It's the first time like, you know, engagement. It's funny, we had so internally in the bear market, we were kind of split on our leadership team at blockworks. Some people really wanted.
00:18:10.474 - 00:18:34.242, Speaker A: Mike and I were like, you can't grow top of funnel numbers, you can grow bottom of funnel, you can grow ARR, subscriber numbers, things like that. But you can't grow top of funnel, you can't grow your twitter following that much in bear, it's no matter how much you press, you just can't grow it. And, you know, some other folks were like, no, no. We just got to keep growing, growing, growing. I was like, you. I'm sorry, you just. You just can't.
00:18:34.242 - 00:18:38.762, Speaker A: It's just the nature of crypto. You just can't grow. And so now that the bull I.
00:18:38.778 - 00:18:49.330, Speaker B: Use, I looked at your user base and my user base that, you know, you remember that competition that I won? We probably each didn't grow more than a thousand followers during the bear.
00:18:49.522 - 00:18:52.370, Speaker A: Yeah. And now it's crazy there.
00:18:52.442 - 00:18:54.230, Speaker B: Every week, I'm gaining a thousand followers.
00:18:54.362 - 00:19:22.394, Speaker A: Yeah, same, same. It's just with the bull market. So, anyways, this is big bull market tweets. I want to lay this out. So I laid out the four stages of a bull market, and for context, I think one of the biggest, if not the biggest tweets I've ever done was the three stages of a bear market. And I've got a lot wrong, but I think that those three stages ended up being really right. And they not only were good for these kind of pithy little tweets, but they actually helped inform blockworks strategy.
00:19:22.394 - 00:19:54.376, Speaker A: And so I want to kind of share. I'm going to quickly do the three stages of the bear, and then I want to get into the four stages of the bull to hopefully help one or two people who are listening to this. If you're a founder, kind of, like, figure out how you should be kind of angling your company, or if you're an investor, like, maybe think about allocation. So, as a reminder, three stages of the bear, you have the unwind. This is like, the excitement and the greed from the bull market still exists. You have these assets that sell floors. Valuations get cut, but companies don't really make the tough decisions, like killing products, doing layoffs.
00:19:54.376 - 00:20:09.880, Speaker A: Things still seem all right. It doesn't really feel like a bear market. Stage two was forced, forced capitulation. And that's where it's really started to get ugly. Right? Narratives started to die. Prices fell 80%, then fell another 80%. Layoffs started to happen.
00:20:09.880 - 00:20:28.202, Speaker A: Mainstream media and, like, cynics kind of. That's when you get, like, the cynics who really rise up in stage two, they kind of laugh and shout. I told you, and I would say Luna last year. Excuse me. This was 2022. Luna sent us into stage two. It's like the diamond hands become the four sellers, and they sell not because they want to, but because they have to.
00:20:28.202 - 00:20:50.478, Speaker A: Right? Celsius didn't want to sell. They had to sell. And there are a lot of companies that blew up in that stage. And that's kind of like, the lower the prices go, the louder the bears got. Louder the bears get, the lower the prices go. It kind of creates this vicious cycle. And stage two, that's when you get these prices that crash really violently, and the excitement kind of gets replaced by anger.
00:20:50.478 - 00:21:12.984, Speaker A: Stage three, I would say, is what the last was, what kind of the early half of 2023 was like, which is just bottomless exhaustion. And I know. I mean, you were mentioning this in 2019, when you're saying, like, I just want to be relevant, basically. Like, I want someone to care about crypto. This is the bottomless exhaustion pain. And it's. It comes after the max pain.
00:21:12.984 - 00:21:38.668, Speaker A: There's max exhaustion. There's no bounces, there's no narratives. Prices consolidate sideways, or they just trend down a little bit. It's really boring. And at the bottom, anger is replaced by silence. I would say those three stages helped, I think, inform how blockworks thinks about when we should start hiring again, what the market will look like. So I laid out these four stages of a bull market, and I want to lay them out here.
00:21:38.668 - 00:22:02.482, Speaker A: I'd be curious to see if you agree with this or not. So, stage one of a bull market is rebirth. The exhaustion from the bear market still exists. You have these sparks of hope. They pop up and they kind of fade away. You have a few new narratives that arise but are quickly killed by apathy. And this is when a lot of the media or your friends, if you talk to them about crypto, are still really focused on the bear market blow ups.
00:22:02.482 - 00:22:37.814, Speaker A: Right? CNBC, they're still covering FTX. Your friends are still talking about SBF, but all the while, prices are quietly recovering. Your investment that went down 90% in the bear market just went up five x, but still down 50% from the highs. And only the people in this cycle, I think, who realize that we're in a bull market are the folks who have probably seen two cycles. We were talking about this in probably summer of 2023, saying, look, I think we're at the start of a bull market. Um, and I think. And.
00:22:37.814 - 00:23:02.220, Speaker A: And the people who I saw talking about that were, like, very deeply crypto native people who have seen multiple cycles. Most people are still in belief, disbelief at this point that it's a bull market. That's stage one. This is like, I don't know what you think of this, but I would say probably Solana coming back a little bit, uh, friend tech. Like, when friend tech kind of popped up, I was like, that was a sign to me. I was like, all right, this market wants something. Like, maybe it's not friendtech, but the market wants something.
00:23:02.220 - 00:23:18.584, Speaker A: That's stage one. I think we just entered stage two, which is excitement. The bear market has officially ended. Coins are nearing all time highs. Some coins have blown past all time highs. Everyone in crypto understands that we're officially in a bull market. But in.
00:23:18.584 - 00:23:34.622, Speaker A: I'd put quotes around this, the real world, outside of crypto, people, like, they're not texting you, they're not messaging you. They're not. Like, they're not fomoing back into bitcoin. And that's stage two. You kind of feel this weird combo. I don't know how you. I saw you kind of.
00:23:34.622 - 00:23:59.072, Speaker A: I think your tweet was a sub tweet of Mike's. Mike said, I don't own enough coins. And you said, you do own enough coins, but I think you've kind of. A lot of people feel this weird combo of excited and anxious, right? Your stack is growing, your portfolio is growing, but you feel like you don't own enough coins. I said on Twitter, your company starts hiring, you start ordering the guac again at Chipotle. Life is good. All your crypto friends are winning.
00:23:59.072 - 00:24:16.392, Speaker A: This is the calm before the storm. So I think we're in this phase right now. Stage three is euphoria, right? Everything blows past all time highs. There used to be a new narrative every week. Now there's a new one daily. Gets super hard to stay on top of everything, super hard to track everything. Private markets get really crazy.
00:24:16.392 - 00:24:37.226, Speaker A: So right now, behind the scenes, there's a lot of funds that are raising these funds. In stage three, the funds announced, these $500 million funds, they skip the DD. They race to deploy. Every week there's a new company that announces $100 million raise or mainstream again. Forbes, Bloomberg, CNBC, they love crypto. Then weird things happen. We start to shift to stage four.
00:24:37.226 - 00:24:54.924, Speaker A: At the end of stage three is like Fortune 500. Start buying bitcoin. Athletes and artists get involved. Crypto permeates mainstream culture. Everything. Everyone starts to believe that we're going up forever. And in this stage, you're going to start seeing people saying, this is the real institutional cycle.
00:24:54.924 - 00:25:17.242, Speaker A: The ETF flows make it so that crypto goes up forever. This is the stage when you start to see those kind of things. And what you want to look out for is delusion seeping into your decision making. And then there's stage four. Right? Complete disconnection from reality could also be described as insanity. Nothing makes sense anymore. You and your company have more money than you thought you'd ever have.
00:25:17.242 - 00:25:45.692, Speaker A: Your friend, who knows nothing about crypto launches a token and is worth hundreds of millions overnight. There's probably going to be a crypto person, or a founder and investor buys a sports team. Justin Bieber joins Farcaster. Crypto company spends a billion dollars on marketing. That is where a lot of people get arrogant and lazy in this cycle, and it ends up causing them a very tough, arrogant. Yeah. So anyways, I'd be curious what you think of those cycles.
00:25:45.692 - 00:25:50.064, Speaker A: And like, I mean, you've, you've lived through it even longer than I have. Like, what do you think about this framing?
00:25:52.804 - 00:26:32.034, Speaker B: Yeah, generally I think it offers a good blueprint of things to be aware of. Most importantly, avoiding catastrophic mistakes. And I think it's a good framework for most people, I would say. I think people are still arrogant and lazy. I don't think that we need to wait for the end. There are certain things that are delusional and make no sense today as they did in the bear market, like friendtech. And so certain things, like generally, I do agree.
00:26:32.034 - 00:27:32.754, Speaker B: But yeah, I think it's a good framework for most. I was thinking about last cycle going through the bear and kind of making sure to be. I think it's important to. You asked me in, I think last year, if I was of the mind that you should always hold certain things like bitcoin and ethereum and never sell, or if there was a price target at which I would sell, answered, yes, there is always a price target by which I would sell. There's always an opportunity cost. And I'm just of that mind that there comes a point where things don't make sense and that level, no one really tells you what that is, but I'll give you perhaps a different perspective. And I tweeted about this today, I won't read the entire tweet, but seems to have resonated with certain people.
00:27:32.754 - 00:27:59.070, Speaker B: You know, there are many things that change and others that never change. And I read this week on the way here, this book by Morgan Housel, which is dubbed, I think, things that never change think it's the name of the book. 1 second. I will pull it up. It is called, yeah, same, same as ever, Morgan Housel. Highly recommend.
00:27:59.182 - 00:28:05.630, Speaker A: I read his first one, psychology of money, and it was really good. Yeah, he's a great writer, same as ever.
00:28:05.702 - 00:28:24.514, Speaker B: Morgan Housel. It's hard to read in the bowl. I appreciate that. Read that. It's really, really good. So it got me thinking of things that never change and things that will change and certain things never change. Like, I think things will get crazier, probably crazier than what you initially think that they, they can get.
00:28:24.514 - 00:29:02.162, Speaker B: And it's always important when you reach that level. It's not you. It's not that you're a genius. It's that things are just getting crazy. And that probably is a good indicator of being aware of what you're doing, maybe taking down leverage, maybe changing your life, if you can, things like that. You know, there will be pullbacks, there will be whiplashes of -20 -10% days, even in a raging bull market. So it's important, especially not.
00:29:02.162 - 00:29:10.534, Speaker B: So it's important to don't get liquidated and survive. I think.
00:29:12.514 - 00:29:12.946, Speaker A: It is.
00:29:12.970 - 00:29:41.464, Speaker B: Again, I won't read through all them, but I think that the, those were the bigger points that I wanted to emphasize. The other thing is, you don't have to play every hand. Right. The best players don't play every hand in poker in the markets. So your point around. I think there's a part in the cycle where even in a bear market, it was difficult. It has been difficult for the last, since Defi summer to keep track of everything that's going on.
00:29:41.464 - 00:30:33.534, Speaker B: And, you know, there's going to be incredible opportunities in deepen, in AI, in defi, in who knows what other, like gamble, fi, like gamefi, socialfi, different ecosystems, cosmos, l two s, Solana, Filecoin, you name it. Right? So, I think it's, you know, some people may give you the impression that they're on top of it all, but I always like to remind myself that I need to do one or two things very, very well. Yeah, one or two. One aave 150 x 1000 x in a cycle with decent conviction in size. And. And that should carry you through the day, I think.
00:30:35.214 - 00:31:35.340, Speaker A: Hey, everyone wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santi and I, and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best, like uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the empire listener? This opens up a huge number of multi chain use cases across defi, nfts, governance oracles, and more. By supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including Sui Solana, different ETH, l two S theorem, and a whole bunch more. That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it.
00:31:35.340 - 00:31:55.332, Speaker A: Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time. Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion. And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for empire listeners.
00:31:55.332 - 00:32:36.978, Speaker A: Hit the link in the description to claim your unique wormhole NFT. Today, the days of not using crypto for really anything in the real world are over. It is time to start using crypto in everyday transactions, whether that's shopping online or just buying a bagel on the street. We're excited to tell you about Py USD PayPal's entrance into web3. PayPal is proud to share an open letter to the crypto community that outlines their commitment, their roadmap, and their goals in the digital currency space. PyusD seeks to transform how you interact with your digital assets available today. You can send your crypto to your PayPal account, swap it for PyUSD, and then use it to check out at millions of stores.
00:32:36.978 - 00:32:59.482, Speaker A: PayPal invites you, all the empire listeners, to be a part of this journey. Hit the link in the description of today's episode to read PayPal's open letter to the community. It gives you a really good sense of what their vision is. Take the next step by signing up for a PayPal account. Today, the future of crypto payments starts with PayPal. Yeah, I think we're. We've.
00:32:59.482 - 00:33:35.242, Speaker A: In my mind, we've entered the part of the cycle where it's probably best at this point to assuming you've spent the. Done the hard work in the last year, to position yourself accordingly. We've entered the part of the cycle where it's best to just sit on your hands. Here's what people want to do. What people want to do, and what people have the tendency to do is both to take out a bunch of leverage on their coins because they feel like they don't own enough coins. That's definitely the wrong move. But what people have the tendency to do is start to chase narratives, because in the bear market, there's a new narrative, let's call it every month to two months.
00:33:35.242 - 00:34:00.362, Speaker A: Now there's a new narrative every probably two weeks or three weeks. Very soon, there will be a new narrative every day, actually. And you can't really fathom that until it actually happens. There's truly going to be a new narrative, like at least three a week. And you start to get. I would say there's a money component of this, but there's a psychological component of it. You start to basically, first off, trading in and out of these things.
00:34:00.362 - 00:34:38.594, Speaker A: I promise you, you will end down, at the end of the day, you will end down on your stack. But the other thing is the psychological component that comes with that, the, like, anxiety that you will feel, which then comes at the detriment of everything else in your life. If you're trying to chase every single narrative, I don't think can be overstated. If you're a full time trader, sure, it makes sense. If you are anything else, a founder, a builder, you don't work in crypto, it's just your hobby. If you try to chase every single narrative, you will drive yourself and everyone around you mad. And.
00:34:40.614 - 00:35:34.854, Speaker B: I'll add some, I definitely agree. I'll add some nuance. The first one is, so what happens if you didn't do the quote unquote work, do you think? Probably the vast majority of people either feel it because it's real or feel it because it's psychology. They might be allocated, but they still feel, to your point, they don't own enough coins, they don't have enough exposure as a percentage of their net worth, whatever. I think I'll go out on a limb to say that. I think in crypto, every time I think that I've missed a particular project coin that I like, more often than not, the market gives me an opportunity to buy it at a price that I like because it comes back to that level and I want to. I keep reminding myself of that.
00:35:34.854 - 00:36:26.818, Speaker B: And I keep a shopping list nice and handy. I let it have a written piece of paper that I carry with me with certain things. To look at it, I have alerts. And so, you know, because I think that's the position where perhaps a lot of people are in today because they feel like, oh God, you know, they didn't buy ethereum at a thousand, then they didn't buy it 2000, then they didn't buy it at 3000, they missed it or bitcoin at ten, waiting for ten. They didn't buy it at 20, they didn't buy it at 50. They're not maybe going to buy it now, but so what do they do? It's per, it's really paralyzing and you so and so forth, where you can look at Solana as well, and it went down 80 and then now it's 120 and, yeah. Oh, my God, you know what's going on? That's where I think it's just very important to go deep, spend more time than you probably think to do one of two things.
00:36:26.818 - 00:36:45.738, Speaker B: One, like, just think about and whatever framework you have, just think about what you feel comfortable holding, what is most likely not going to shake you out. And again, you can add qualifiers, you can add comps, you can add whatever it is that you.
00:36:45.866 - 00:36:46.210, Speaker A: Whatever.
00:36:46.242 - 00:37:30.706, Speaker B: An analysis framework. I don't want to say fundamental, because I guess there's little to latch onto, but just do deep work, get involved in these communities, talk to these founders if you can. Most of the time you can. And I think that's like a really good use of time. The other thing is, if you look at DeFi summer, and I appreciate things never unfold the same. By definition, a man doesn't cross the same river twice. But during Defi summer, compound launch, liquidity mining, you had this huge run up and rerating these moments of re ratings.
00:37:30.706 - 00:38:07.300, Speaker B: We're going to talk about the uni proposal and what seemed to be a quick re rating of defi coins, governance tokens. Shout out to degen Spartan that has coined the meme worthless governance tokens. It turns out they may have value after all, but there's a very quick re rating. The market wakes up and it can happen overnight. A subtle catalyst, like a proposal, like the uni, one that have been, by the way, countless others before. But why is this different? And I think we're going to want to talk about that. But in that moment, I would argue that there is a difference between chasing every narrative, but I wouldn't advise to do that.
00:38:07.300 - 00:39:16.804, Speaker B: Like constantly trying to trade everything. I would advise to pay attention to every narrative that is unfolding as much as you possibly can and your time permits. Of course, there comes a time of diminishing returns if you never double click, if you never spend meaningful time on one that you like. But, for instance, now, I'd be probably doing myself a disservice if I'm not paying attention to AI or deepen or define Solana or social fi or forecaster or whatever, even though I may not necessarily have invested there or not, or it's a really small percentage of my portfolio, I still need to pay attention to that because my role as an investor is I cannot miss a huge vertical and category and crypto is in a state where we're still throwing stuff at the wall to figure out what's going to work. I had a poll a couple of weeks ago saying what narrative is really going to make crypto very tangible. And it was like gaming nfts, defi, deep in AI. And the top two, number one was deepen, which I actually agree with.
00:39:16.804 - 00:39:56.616, Speaker B: And the number two is AI, which is a bit abstract. I think AI certainly brings a lot of attention and you could reasonably that it might be a really good exposure for a lot of people that can buy Nvidia to buy AI coins. They also have, you know, it's more elusive. So, you know, people just, it's really hot narrative outside of crypto as well. And. But deepen is probably one of those things where people really appreciate the tangible use case in their day to day life, whether it's because you have free mobile. You know, I just invested in this company, Geonette, that has getting a ton of traction with like industry folks.
00:39:56.616 - 00:40:23.264, Speaker B: It's one of those projects that is getting more traction outside of crypto than within crypto, which I find really interesting. So anyways, to round out this thing, I think you should always pay attention to every narrative that's getting decent traction. You could look at coingecko top categories and understand like what's trending. Like there's a million ways that you can cut this. Pay attention. Don't necessarily trade it, is what I'm saying.
00:40:24.924 - 00:41:02.430, Speaker A: Unless I would push people to do the hard work of basically it's not even that hard of work, but I would push people to basically sit down and say, all right, there's going to be like, there's probably 20 different things, right? There's. There's the l one trade, there's l two s, there's nfts, there's meme coins, AI defi. There's kind of new defi and old defi. There's equities, right? There's the miners, there's the coin, there's coinbase equity, there's gaming. Obviously there's deep in, you know, there's a million things. If you could only pick five or six of those, what are you picking? Right? Because if you buy everything, what you.
00:41:02.462 - 00:41:06.598, Speaker B: Pick today might change what you pick in a month. Like a really bad fraud.
00:41:06.646 - 00:41:12.762, Speaker A: That's mine. But I don't know, I would. I take the other side of that. Like I. Yeah, a really good.
00:41:12.858 - 00:41:46.304, Speaker B: We're in just a state of the infancy of crypto, where a really good project can be an industry defining movement in canvas. Like, like, imagine if you were sitting in pre defy summer and compound launches liquidity mining, and you had an opinion on other stuff and you didn't pay attention to that. The market gave you, by the way, nine months to a year to pile onto that trade and outperform meaningfully. You didn't do that. And you're getting paid to be an investor in the space.
00:41:47.164 - 00:41:48.972, Speaker A: That's a good point. That's a good point.
00:41:49.068 - 00:41:51.020, Speaker B: Oh, like that.
00:41:51.052 - 00:41:51.300, Speaker A: That's.
00:41:51.332 - 00:42:01.584, Speaker B: I, that's my approach. I'm always curious and playing around with stuff which, by the way, that's brought. When you think about doing work, I think using these things.
00:42:01.924 - 00:42:16.592, Speaker A: You know, the key thing is there, though, Santi, there's. You're an investor. That, that's, that's actually the key thing. I think you have to know the game that you're playing. So. I am not a professional investor. I would actually rather sacrifice upside.
00:42:16.592 - 00:42:33.404, Speaker A: So, like, let's say you want to make 100 x this cycle. I'd be comfortable. But, like. But with that hundred x, it's going to take lots of founder calls. It's going to take spending time every day thinking about your investments. I'd rather honestly get a 50. I'd rather make half the money that you'd make if I can.
00:42:33.404 - 00:42:48.698, Speaker A: Five x at best. Seven X. I'm making up the 150. Whatever. Let's say ten or five x. I'd rather actually make half the returns that you make. But be able to spend 99% of my mental energy on blockworks.
00:42:48.698 - 00:43:05.224, Speaker A: So I think you got to know the game you're playing. Right. Like, there's a lot of builders and founders who then bull market hits, they end up spending like 5 hours a day trading and investing and thinking about that. Like, that's not the game you're playing. You got to know the game you're playing.
00:43:05.604 - 00:43:08.436, Speaker B: Absolutely. Well, we should have started there, right?
00:43:08.500 - 00:43:09.732, Speaker A: Yeah. Know the game.
00:43:09.748 - 00:43:14.972, Speaker B: You know you can't. Yeah, exactly. Um, do you want to talk about.
00:43:14.988 - 00:43:17.024, Speaker A: This uniswap, uh, governance?
00:43:17.404 - 00:43:49.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I just want to. I want to emphasize one thing, uh, because I admire certain, um, professional investors. One of them is George Soros, which borrowed certain concepts around thinking of probabilities, like Howard Marks and George flexivity, obviously thinking of probabilities. Soros would change his mind constantly. Like, he would be bullish in the morning, bearish in the afternoon. So this idea of like a CMS coined it. You want to be right or do you want to make money? And being, putting ego aside, the other one is, which is very relevant for this discussion, I think is stan drunken Miller.
00:43:49.934 - 00:44:18.276, Speaker B: And he has this great quote when he gave a private conversation, which is now on YouTube, and he says, look, if I like something, I don't wait to finish the work, quote unquote. By the way, you never finished doing work. You constantly are updating your thesis and models. But if you like something, it could be a hunch. It could be doing five minutes of work, put in the position and. And then do more work. And if you like it more, add to the position.
00:44:18.276 - 00:44:56.404, Speaker B: If you don't like it, cut. And I think that is very refreshing, by the way, coming from probably one of the most successful fund managers ever. And it's very refreshing because sometimes we're of the mind that we need to do a ton of work. And whatever that means is like very, very nebulous. It's very subjective. You also hear folks like Bill Ackman before COVID he put on a huge. He basically bought like credit default swaps on a lot of things and made a killing.
00:44:56.404 - 00:45:26.304, Speaker B: And he was going through that analysis and he said, this took us an hour of less than an hour of discussion in investment committee. You're like, okay, so what I'm trying to say is like, time is not the barometer here. And unfortunately, that's all. Oftentimes what we are trained to think of, it's like, oh, I'm spending 5 hours a day. You know, I don't. It's difficult because sometimes it's like these guys are not necessarily punting stuff. It may seem like it, but they're constantly observing the market.
00:45:26.304 - 00:45:54.584, Speaker B: To your point, they are getting paid to constantly live, breathe, observe markets. And if you're paying enough attention, I feel that you can kind of get a feeling for emerging narratives. And like when you tell me, join forecaster, I cannot not be it forecaster. Like, I cannot miss it. Something good may come out of that because it's getting decent traction. I'd be stupid not to look at it. I'd be stupid not to look at AI coins.
00:45:54.584 - 00:46:38.274, Speaker B: And so it is challenging because there are so many narratives. You can get lost, you can be paralyzed. But anyways, I don't know. Teach his own right. I'm not Stan Rock Miller. I don't have his success or track record. But I think it's also just very refreshing to see someone like that that has been so successful, be very open minded and like, I think where most people, I guess to finish this conversation, most people probably end up spending too much time doing research, not enough thinking about how they're gonna structure and size the position, which is equally as important.
00:46:38.274 - 00:47:19.574, Speaker B: If you're right without size doesn't matter, or if you're right with the wrong structure, it doesn't matter. So it's very important to think about structure and portfolio composition, especially in crypto, which you can express your view in so many different ways, right? There's liquid, there's privates, there are equities, there are just so many different ways that you can get exposure to the space. So anyways, it's fun. Have fun, folks. Seriously. No, no, seriously, like have fun. It's, it's a most intellectually rewarding space, I think, especially as a trade.
00:47:19.574 - 00:48:13.924, Speaker B: Like I, I remember to this day, I try to convince so many funds back in 2012, 13, 1415, even 16 before ICO madness to invest in the space. And even after the ICo mania, especially during the bear markets, like my former boss at Sage, we would reach out and we'd have lunch and he'd be like, oh, you still like this crypto thing? Like see, I told you so. I'm like, what are you talking about? We're up like over 100 x. But sure, we're in a bear market. And I'm like, I say, Ned, like I've probably seen more cycles than most professional investors in their eighties at this point because crypto just is a huge learning curve and you have to like learn new things along the way, be a venture capitalist plus high frequency trader at the same time and everything in between. So anyways, it's a really boring and fun journey.
00:48:14.744 - 00:48:45.052, Speaker A: All right, so this week let's talk about this proposal. I'm trying to find out. I might just read Aaron's post. Here's the TLDR. Nevermind, I'm not going to read that thread. The first tweet was the most important thing, which is that uniswap is now considering basically driving fees back to token holders. It's basically this large scale upgrade where the fee mechanism would now reward uni token holders that have delegated and staked their tokens.
00:48:45.052 - 00:49:22.258, Speaker A: And the reason this is important is you're laughing at the degenspartan claim about useless governance. Tokens. There are all these tokens that launched, right? There are all these tokens that launched, a lot of them launched in Defi and Defi summer and they gained a lot of traction and they're kind of the hot coins for a while. And then they have basically trended down for the last three years. And it's got. There's a Bloomberg Defi index out there and it's down 85% from all time highs right now, whereas a lot of other things are nearing all time highs. And basically this Defi token narrative has completely died.
00:49:22.258 - 00:50:05.276, Speaker A: And it's caused a lot of apathy, I would say, in the governance space in Defi. And it's had a lot of people question like, what are these tokens even doing? And the solution to this is to drive value accrual back to the tokens. However, you can't do that historically, or at least I'm not a lawyer, neither are you. But my understanding is that you haven't been able to do this historically because of the risk. If you turn on a fee switch, drive that value and dividends essentially back to the token, then it can be claimed as a security. Again, I don't know if that's the actual reason, but that's what kind of narrative is uniswap. Turning this on is obviously a really cool proposal.
00:50:05.276 - 00:50:34.880, Speaker A: It's big for Uniswap, but it has massive ramifications across the industry. You saw a day later fracs said, look, we're now considering doing the same thing. I think every defi founder is basically talking internally and saying, look, if Uniswap did this, that means they know something. Then we can hopefully consider this. And I think there's probably a bigger. Again, I don't know anything, but I think there's probably a bigger story here. There's probably a big legal win behind the scenes.
00:50:34.880 - 00:51:08.780, Speaker A: It probably didn't come from Uniswap. I think maybe Coinbase wanted dismissal and it's not public yet, or something like that. You actually had this tweet from Paul Gruol, the chief legal officer at Coinbase, who tweeted maybe two or three weeks ago. He said, look, if you're word to outside counsel is a little bit of advice, if you have a huge win, let your internal lawyers tell the CEO before the outside lawyers tell the CEO. So that me, I'm reading between the lines here, but I think coinbase probably had a decent legal victory. Um, and yeah, there's a. You're talking about big re ratings.
00:51:08.780 - 00:51:12.044, Speaker A: Like this was the re rating 50%.
00:51:12.084 - 00:51:48.524, Speaker B: A lot of defi governance tokens were up big on the day and on the week. And, um. Yeah, I don't know, like, uh, you know, there's been a few proposals out there over time to turn on the fee mechanism. It also was interesting because Sushi already had, is distributing that to stakers, and it was also up like 20% that day, which is, again, markets are not necessarily rational. It just brings more attention to Defi as a category. And, oh, by the way, these protocols are working and are generating a lot of fees and, oh, there's value here. It's an attention game.
00:51:48.524 - 00:52:11.524, Speaker B: And I think a catalyst like this, a lot of people seem to be really positive on the fact that Coinbase is probably going to win this case against the SEC. And that has, I think, really big ramifications, implications on the regulatory front. Just another win for the industry. So we'll see. Certainly encouraging, I'd say.
00:52:11.604 - 00:52:17.904, Speaker A: Here's the counter. Is that so? Gabriel Shapiro from I don't know where. Is he at Delphi?
00:52:18.204 - 00:52:20.556, Speaker B: He's at Delphi now, or he's not.
00:52:20.580 - 00:52:34.340, Speaker A: In his metallux labs. This is the Delphi thing they're building anyways. So, yeah. Gabriel said, I'm so confused by that. This is the counter argument. He said, I'm so confused by this, and why what Uni is doing would change anything. The law hasn't changed one iota.
00:52:34.340 - 00:53:09.644, Speaker A: There's no special sauce to their, quote, new strategy. Maybe they just finally hired a lawyer who is no moron. Only took them four years. Sorry to be harsh to Uniswap's doubtless pricey lawyers, but, howie, case law was always clear that there can be an expectation of profit without receiving fees and distributions and dividends. So it was obvious that the fee switch should not be the deciding factor in token securities analysis. And, I mean, he goes on to call what Uniswap has been doing for the last couple of years predatory structures. But, so I don't, I don't know his beef with, with Uniswap, but, yeah.
00:53:10.304 - 00:53:36.568, Speaker B: Listen, we can be, have an intellectual debate of why DeFi tokens rerated. The reality is the market maybe just put a little bit more attention. The fees are going to the admin contract folks. Whether they distribute them or not. Is the difference between, imagine a startup that is generating billions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars, and they're having it in the balance sheet, and you could see it in real time. You're not getting that dividend. Oh, by the way, that has tax implications.
00:53:36.568 - 00:53:53.494, Speaker B: Maybe they're reinvesting in growth. Maybe they're just there. So, like, from a enterprise value component, like market cap standpoint, you're buying these things off of cash, presumably, again, presumably because the market's not rational. Anyways.
00:53:54.154 - 00:54:13.334, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Big shout out to Matt Feibeck, who was on the roundup last week. Matt and Bo Spencer. So Blockworks is a pretty active delegate in Uniswap Dao. We have about 500,000 Uni tokens that have been delegated to us. I think we're one of the bigger delegates in Uniswap now.
00:54:13.334 - 00:54:37.674, Speaker A: We also have a seat on the Uniswap deployment committee, so. But Matt and Spencer have been doing great work. There was actually two. In the, in the official forum post, they call out three initiatives that delegates have taken in the past year, and two of them were led by blockworks research. So we have, I mean, I'm excited to see why, what Uniswap is doing. I like it.
00:54:38.134 - 00:55:03.728, Speaker B: We'll see. Yeah, it's been. It's good to have more activity and shake up from non vc holders because they've been. There's been a lot of apathy because I want, didn't want. They have been reluctant to vote, so they've been delegating votes to these, like, student run organizations who have no fucking business like voting on these things. I actually think real votes should go to more folks like you as opposed to the pen club. No disrespect, but they have.
00:55:03.728 - 00:55:16.134, Speaker B: I don't know, feels like a bit of a. Bit of a theatrics there anyways. Like, you guys are closer to the mail folks in college. I don't think so.
00:55:17.354 - 00:55:20.002, Speaker A: I will say I spent time with the pen folks last weekend.
00:55:20.058 - 00:55:22.842, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:55:22.858 - 00:55:23.746, Speaker A: You're good.
00:55:23.890 - 00:55:25.378, Speaker B: They are good and they're thoughtful.
00:55:25.466 - 00:55:51.002, Speaker A: I've. So I have a. I have a prediction. I have a prediction on Uniswap, which is that if you think, okay, so Uniswap also launched Uniswap extension this week. It's basically, it's like a metamask competitor. It's a phantom competitor, backpack competitor. Well, I guess backpack and phantom or salon base, but it's a metamask competitor and it's really cool.
00:55:51.002 - 00:56:16.394, Speaker A: I actually got an early demo of it, played around with it. It's really nice. Instead of living in your chrome extension, it actually kind of pops down into the sidebar of your screen, like in frame. It's actually quite nice. Do you remember how people thought about Coinbase two years ago? Bloated, hasn't innovated. Not really doing much. We want alternatives outside of Coinbase.
00:56:16.394 - 00:56:26.402, Speaker A: You know how quickly that has changed now and how. I mean, Coinbase is now one of the most dominant, most innovative, best companies in crypto, hands down. Like no holds barred in my mind.
00:56:26.578 - 00:56:29.614, Speaker B: I think it hasn't gotten enough credibility.
00:56:30.624 - 00:56:41.564, Speaker A: I think uniswap basically just had a huge sophomore slump and is about to just come out swinging in 2024. So that's good.
00:56:42.064 - 00:56:46.444, Speaker B: Maybe that's what it takes to have a renaissance of Defi.
00:56:50.264 - 00:57:06.744, Speaker A: I have one more hotter take related to Coinbase, which is. I think this is going to pave the way whatever's happening behind the scenes, I do not know. I think Coinbase will launch base token in the next twelve months.
00:57:08.044 - 00:57:14.224, Speaker B: Oh, and the regulatory landscape shapes up in the way they might spin out. Jesse's team.
00:57:15.524 - 00:57:23.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think. I think we see a base token, even though they've said they're not launching a token, all that. I think we will get a base token in the next twelve ones.
00:57:24.774 - 00:57:39.414, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean, there's a version of the world where you have regulatory clarity and, you know, tokens, like we're dancing around something that will be largely irrelevant, I think, in a longer time scale.
00:57:39.574 - 00:57:39.982, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:40.038 - 00:57:45.234, Speaker B: And it's actually be quite refreshing that these things are seen as what they are. And.
00:57:46.974 - 00:57:47.718, Speaker A: You know, we.
00:57:47.806 - 00:58:36.674, Speaker B: There needs to be some rules and places in guidelines in place. And I think that will open up the design space for tokenomics and just be more transparent and focused on driving value to these protocols. These protocols are generating a ton of value. I mean, Uniswap at one point was generating more volume within coinbase with like twelve employees. The market, traditional markets are really focused on ETF's. Now when you have an ETF of a DeFi protocol like Uniswap or a basket of protocols, an analyst, equity analysts start comparing this and they understand how lean and mean like crypto protocols are. They will be going bonkers.
00:58:36.674 - 00:59:12.420, Speaker B: Like you value ethereum relative to SaaS companies on their fee generation. You can value these protocols relative to other companies and equities and like tech companies, and they are vastly more capital efficient on numbers metrics. It's just wild. I'm waiting for that day to happen and probably happens in the next three years, to your point. I want to go back to something that ties both the DeFi discussion and the markets discussion for context. Bitcoin is down 10% from its all time high. ETH is down 30% from its all time high.
00:59:12.420 - 00:59:46.734, Speaker B: Seoul still down 50, even though it's had a massive day that it's at 132 and Defi. So BTC down ten east down 30, sold down 50. Defi down like still 80%. And certain alts still down 80% to 70%. So, yeah, I think the important metric, again, to re emphasize Xiao's observation is anytime BTCs come within 10% of its prior all time high, it doesn't stop there. And then everything else, presumably, if it stabilizes, should flow.
00:59:50.834 - 00:59:55.854, Speaker A: Anything else from this week? Blast miss. You know, talk about.
00:59:56.674 - 00:59:57.458, Speaker B: Huh?
00:59:57.626 - 01:00:02.714, Speaker A: Don't talk about blast. Blast miss. There's two, 2 billion of tvl now in blast. 2 billion.
01:00:02.794 - 01:00:03.466, Speaker B: That's right.
01:00:03.570 - 01:00:06.466, Speaker A: I think there's launch today and it.
01:00:06.530 - 01:00:09.054, Speaker B: Will launch tomorrow, I believe, Friday, tomorrow 30th.
01:00:09.674 - 01:00:13.134, Speaker A: There's no, there's no, uh. No Feb. No. Feb 30, my guy.
01:00:13.914 - 01:00:18.974, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. Then, yeah, I guess today, um.
01:00:19.954 - 01:00:20.362, Speaker A: Today.
01:00:20.418 - 01:00:21.674, Speaker B: This is a leap year, right?
01:00:21.714 - 01:00:23.026, Speaker A: Leap year. Leap year.
01:00:23.090 - 01:00:24.666, Speaker B: Nice. Nice.
01:00:24.770 - 01:00:26.974, Speaker A: Bitcoin always goes up in leap years. You know that.
01:00:30.114 - 01:00:31.454, Speaker B: I guess I do now.
01:00:32.914 - 01:00:37.734, Speaker A: Causation, correlation. I do. I do not know, but correlation and causation.
01:00:39.204 - 01:00:44.044, Speaker B: Nice. Well, yeah, I mean, the happenings coming, ETF's coming.
01:00:44.164 - 01:00:49.572, Speaker A: What kind of companies were building on blast? A lot of, like, very. The narrative right now is like, very degen.
01:00:49.748 - 01:01:22.274, Speaker B: Let me give you some insight view here. I got forwarded a Google Doc with all the submissions across different categories, different tabs, all the different categories. Dex, perps, nfts, social fi, gamefi and other infrastructure. I looked at it and I tell Pac man, I'm like, dude, I'm going to pull an all nighter here. And I got it for a couple days. And he's like, you're only looking at 16% of the submissions that we called, like, we filtered. I was like, jesus Christ.
01:01:22.274 - 01:01:52.666, Speaker B: And very encouraging. So there was a couple of mixed new. One, completely new projects to existing projects and other ecosystems that wanted to deploy on blast, actually. And some really good ones at that. So those were probably the two different categories. Very strong. I would say, like, I had to rank them of like, 1231 would be, I would take a meeting.
01:01:52.666 - 01:02:15.824, Speaker B: Two, I would definitely use it. Three, I would invest with what I know. And in every category, that was one, three, at least. At least one, three which I would invest. And I've done that. I've invested in a few projects over the last couple days, and a lot of twos of things that I would want to use and a lot of ones. So, anyways, really exciting.
01:02:15.824 - 01:02:28.826, Speaker B: I tweeted about the projects that I found most interesting. There's a lot of winners. I think what's been obviously most interesting is sort of this redemption arc that it's going through.
01:02:28.850 - 01:02:29.034, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:29.074 - 01:03:19.916, Speaker B: A lot of people were critical of the launch, and I think the team acknowledged it and we'll get past that. But I think, again, important to pay attention to these narratives. Like, builders want to go where there's going to be users, and the blast ecosystem is going to be among the best day one or in the first couple of months. And, you know, without naming names, I got a lot of l two projects, a lot of other ecosystem projects reach out and said, what can we learn about blast? You know, Dave, I said this at the time, I took heat. Never fade a good builder. My thesis for blast was to team the build blur. Would you fade the tensor team? Like, no.
01:03:19.916 - 01:03:33.652, Speaker B: Like, you just don't. And so anyways, there was a rug this week. Like, there will be scams. Of course. There's a lot of teams are, you know, eyeing the incentive. The incentives are right. Of course.
01:03:33.652 - 01:04:05.808, Speaker B: You know, the, there's a huge airdrop for builders. Like, you know, again, you want to be skeptical or critical of that. Like, you have to incentivize this stuff. It's an attention game, and this is what it takes. Right. So, yeah, we'll see. You know, I'd say, like, everything, it will probably take time, but there's a lot of really, I would say really solid projects that are, you know, when you think about the start of most, most ecosystems, like, I think it, it starts with DeFi, right.
01:04:05.808 - 01:04:18.124, Speaker B: And it starts with a good Dex, a good money market and maybe hopefully perps. Right. And so there's really solid projects across those three categories and very interesting.
01:04:20.664 - 01:04:21.144, Speaker A: Social.
01:04:21.224 - 01:04:29.404, Speaker B: Fi project as well. But it's sort of djenny and so, yeah, we'll see. I think it's going to be quite interesting how it shapes up.
01:04:34.024 - 01:04:35.244, Speaker A: I think that's it.
01:04:37.274 - 01:04:37.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:37.714 - 01:04:39.414, Speaker A: Oh, housekeeping.
01:04:40.154 - 01:04:41.074, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
01:04:41.194 - 01:04:51.218, Speaker A: Empire. Empire meetup at das. Right, Wednesday. Shoot, I forgot the time. I think it's 04:00 p.m. Or 06:00 p.m. 04:00 p.m.
01:04:51.218 - 01:04:54.054, Speaker A: Or 06:00 p.m. On, on Wednesday of Das.
01:04:54.754 - 01:04:55.562, Speaker B: Nice.
01:04:55.738 - 01:05:08.650, Speaker A: So, yeah, be there. We're also going to do something. So. All right, so, permissionless, who are we? I'm not sure I'm supposed to. I'll just share it because it's the end. Maybe people aren't listening to the end of the podcast. Permissionless launches on Tuesday.
01:05:08.650 - 01:05:36.624, Speaker A: Permissionless launches with the first 50 speakers on Tuesday. Very excited about that. So are you, are you, did you make the cut? Are you there? No idea. Probably not, hopefully. So we've got a permissionless channel in Farcaster now, so go join that. But also we are going to give five free tickets away to permissionless. Top five casters in the Empire Channel.
01:05:36.624 - 01:05:50.980, Speaker A: So there's an Empire channel. It's got like 350 people. The top five most active people in the Empire Channel on Warpcast are going to get free tickets to permissionless. We'll take a snapshot April 30.
01:05:51.012 - 01:05:54.460, Speaker B: Don't say it. No, just don't say when the snapshots change.
01:05:54.492 - 01:06:05.334, Speaker A: Just kidding. We will take a snapshot at some point in the future. You don't know when, though. Oh, yeah, I forgot. See, this is why I don't run a token. I don't know how to play the game.
01:06:05.494 - 01:06:08.994, Speaker B: Yeah, that's gonna be great. I finally finalized.
01:06:09.934 - 01:06:10.454, Speaker A: Wow.
01:06:10.534 - 01:06:23.032, Speaker B: I was very stupid. I mean, finally finals, my travel for Das. So I'm very excited to meet up with a lot of people there and I think it should be really good time and discussion.
01:06:23.208 - 01:06:25.552, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. Agreed.
01:06:25.608 - 01:06:34.056, Speaker B: This might be our first. Is this going to be our first, like, pod community meetup? Yes. Right. We didn't have one in permissionless.
01:06:34.120 - 01:06:50.224, Speaker A: Yeah, first official one. There's going to be a lot of good stuff. Like we're going to build a whole, like, empire station, I think at permissionless. We're going to have the setup and do live recordings on site and all that. All that kind of stuff. But, yeah, this will be the first test run, so you guys better show up so that I can convince the team to go. Go bigger.
01:06:50.224 - 01:06:51.084, Speaker A: Permissionless.
01:06:51.704 - 01:06:53.696, Speaker B: Nice. Amazing.
01:06:53.840 - 01:06:54.216, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:54.280 - 01:07:12.576, Speaker B: Um, okay, well, again, we usually close out with recommendations to read or listen to. I'll emphasize same as ever, Morgan Housel I know bear markets are really hard to read, but if you do have the time or audiobook, I found it to be a very light read. You'll finish it in a day. Really good.
01:07:12.760 - 01:07:13.160, Speaker A: All right.
01:07:13.192 - 01:07:18.094, Speaker B: Sometimes I also have one, same as ever, Morgan House.
01:07:18.434 - 01:07:28.474, Speaker A: Same as ever, Morgan Hassell. Shout out Morgan Hassel. I also have one avatar, the last airbender on Netflix. It's a banger.
01:07:28.514 - 01:07:32.482, Speaker B: I have, I need it. I need, I need, I needed this because I'm like sitting here.
01:07:32.578 - 01:07:40.254, Speaker A: I'm not, I'm not actually kidding. It's a great show. My wife is out of town for a week and a half or two weeks or something.
01:07:41.274 - 01:07:42.506, Speaker B: It's dangerous.
01:07:42.690 - 01:07:49.414, Speaker A: So. Yeah, dangerous for the raging. I'm firing into Avatar, the last airbender.
01:07:49.714 - 01:07:55.346, Speaker B: I'm like, wandering around the streets of Tokyo and listening to, like, podcasts and music.
01:07:55.410 - 01:08:01.334, Speaker A: And I will, no, I'm actually going to, I'm actually going to Vegas tomorrow to go see, um. To go see u two at the sphere.
01:08:01.714 - 01:08:07.022, Speaker B: Oh, I know the manager, actually. Well, I'll dm you. I've gotten to know him really well.
01:08:07.098 - 01:08:08.834, Speaker A: Of the sphere or of you too?
01:08:09.454 - 01:08:12.950, Speaker B: Oh, no, he's like the right guy. Of Bono and all the.
01:08:13.022 - 01:08:14.430, Speaker A: Oh, wow, that's cool.
01:08:14.622 - 01:08:26.766, Speaker B: And he's there? No, definitely not. No, no, the polar, like opposite of crypto. But, uh, nice.
01:08:26.910 - 01:08:29.154, Speaker A: So, yeah, that should be cool. That should be cool.
01:08:29.574 - 01:08:35.192, Speaker B: Oh, that'd be great. Okay, well, anything else?
01:08:35.368 - 01:08:54.224, Speaker A: That's the pod, let's call it. Thanks for listening, folks. We'll see you next week. Hey, everyone, thanks for tuning into today's episode.
