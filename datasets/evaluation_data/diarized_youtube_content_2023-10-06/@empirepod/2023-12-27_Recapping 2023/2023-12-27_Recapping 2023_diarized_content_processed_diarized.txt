00:00:00.280 - 00:00:04.022, Speaker A: Not only do I have an answer for you, but I'm following through on.
00:00:04.038 - 00:00:10.166, Speaker B: Our bet, which is you didn't shave. Wow.
00:00:10.350 - 00:00:26.626, Speaker A: Breakout star of the year are the balds. Jeremy Allaire, Brian Armstrong merch, and Selkus. On the policy front, phenomenal job by the balds. And I have followed through, and I have shaved my head, as you can see in this picture. All right, everyone.
00:00:26.690 - 00:00:48.654, Speaker C: So, on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We posted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code. Empire 20. We'll see you in London.
00:00:50.674 - 00:00:52.714, Speaker A: What's up, man? We're back.
00:00:52.874 - 00:00:53.658, Speaker B: Oh, we're back.
00:00:53.746 - 00:00:54.322, Speaker A: Relive.
00:00:54.418 - 00:01:06.394, Speaker B: I hit that record. Oh, wow. Sneaky. Hello, everyone. It's been my brain's frying and all cylinders. You know, it's like, it's a holidays. I get it, but it's like, it is busy.
00:01:06.394 - 00:01:16.818, Speaker B: It is. I'm. I'm excited about this pod, too. You know, I think it, uh, you know, predictions are always really hard, but I think it's really exciting time.
00:01:16.946 - 00:01:20.386, Speaker A: I'm excited, too. Before we jump in, dude, I thought you were going to shave your beard.
00:01:20.450 - 00:01:27.032, Speaker B: I did. I did. I did. But we haven't recorded in two weeks, and, like, you. You bailed on me. And, like, look at this protection.
00:01:27.088 - 00:01:36.392, Speaker A: Look at mine. All right, so look at my nasty ass beard. I was like, santi's gonna shave his beard. One of us. We can't be a beardless podcast over here.
00:01:36.488 - 00:01:43.048, Speaker B: So I was like, yeah, yeah, you're looking. The stash is coming out, dude.
00:01:43.096 - 00:01:44.112, Speaker A: It's disgusting.
00:01:44.168 - 00:01:46.672, Speaker B: I face where it's disgusting.
00:01:46.768 - 00:01:53.096, Speaker A: Yeah, I gotta shave it. You either have to, like, power through the next few weeks or shave it, and we're going shave right after this. So.
00:01:53.160 - 00:02:07.684, Speaker B: Well, I wasn't gonna, like. I had, like, a full week where I knew I was, like, not gonna see anyone or do anything critical publicly, so I was like, all right, this is when I shave. And I hadn't shaved in literally twelve years. It was, yeah.
00:02:07.984 - 00:02:09.564, Speaker A: Little baby face auntie.
00:02:10.104 - 00:02:17.124, Speaker B: I probably lost six years. You know, I. That was a consensus when people like, yeah.
00:02:19.024 - 00:02:40.328, Speaker A: You want to. Okay, so here's my vision for this app. I think we should do this in two parts. So we've got these questions, like, breakout star of the year, best founder you met all year breakout company, crypto product of the year, business of the year, worst investment of the year. That's kind of like segment number one. That's the first bucket. So we'll do that.
00:02:40.328 - 00:02:51.912, Speaker A: Then we can take a quick breather and then we can go into predictions for the year. I think we each have five to ten ish predictions we can bounce off each other's. I have not seen yours. You have not seen mine. So.
00:02:52.048 - 00:02:52.272, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:52.288 - 00:02:53.444, Speaker A: Does that sound good to you?
00:02:53.984 - 00:03:06.264, Speaker B: Sounds good, yeah. I'm more excited about, like, talking about how wrong I was on so many things. You know, it's always good to keep us a bit grounded.
00:03:06.344 - 00:03:08.804, Speaker A: Oh, you want to review our 2023 predictions?
00:03:09.144 - 00:03:51.060, Speaker B: Well, we don't have to go through all of them, but I think, like, at least for me, the biggest miss was like, it was not on my bingo card that the markets would rally and perform the way that they, they have this year. Like, the Nasdaq had its strongest start of the year. Like, I was sitting there in March and I'm like, or March or April. And, like, the Nasdaq was like, having its strongest, like, year to date performance. I'm like, you would ask me that. That was an, I would have described an incredibly low probability of that happening. You were coming into 2023 with this idea of, like, rate hikes.
00:03:51.060 - 00:04:39.730, Speaker B: Were there inflation still very much there? Anyways, I was very much caught off guard. And it makes you wonder, right, because you're entering 2024 with a lot. I think the consensus is risk on, right. That the Fed has finally tipped its hand at saying that it's going to lower rates. And so crypto markets react very quickly to that in the same that they reacted very quickly in November of 2021 where there was intimation of inflation problem and rate hikes. The crypto markets took a beating before traditional markets. And so you wonder now, the consensus now is risk on how is 2024 going to shape up? Is it going to be the inverse of what happened in 2023 or is it just going to be a fantastic boom? That's what's on my head right now.
00:04:39.802 - 00:05:08.686, Speaker A: So looking back at our 20, let's actually start there. That's interesting. Looking back at our 2023 predictions, I've got some of these pulled up. I actually think six years of making these predictions, these were the best predictions we've ever made or that I've ever made personally. And I think it's probably easier to make predictions in a bear market. That makes me think than in a bull market. In a bull market, humans are so bad about thinking exponentially that, like, things can get so far out ahead of what you were able to predict and what you're able to comprehend in a bear market, these are actually something pretty good.
00:05:08.686 - 00:05:28.830, Speaker A: So let me walk you through some of these. So I said, first one was talking about fat wallets. I said, the growth of self custody and fat wallets, metamask has never faced real competition. That's going to change this year. And I think that did change. Right? Like things like Phantom and other, you know, other, other, yeah, wallets. I think probably Phantom's the main one, but other wallets did pretty well.
00:05:28.830 - 00:05:44.146, Speaker A: Coinbase wallet has grown, I think, pretty substantially this year. So that was the first 1 second one was, I said, a tier one defi app builds its own chain. And Dydx, you could say do. I mean, DyDx would be this one in my mind.
00:05:44.210 - 00:05:58.194, Speaker B: Dodx maker playing with an idea. Look, I think this is going to continue to be a trend where every major defi protocol at some point was, and even an l two, what's stopping arbitram from doing its own l one?
00:05:58.354 - 00:06:20.694, Speaker A: Well, then that gets into the question, what's the real difference between l two and l one, my friend? All right, here, let me run you through a couple more of these. The kings of trading and NfTs lose market share. So this was a two part. I said Uniswap is going to pass Coinbase and volume. That very much did not happen. But I said, uniswap is going to drastically fall. Excuse me, Opensea is going to drastically fall in market share.
00:06:20.694 - 00:06:32.214, Speaker A: And that has definitely happened, which is going to get into one of the breakout in our next section, breakout companies of the year. I said punks, flip apes. Remember those conversations? We were talking about apes all the time and punks.
00:06:32.954 - 00:06:51.130, Speaker B: I was very much of the minded. There was no enduring value to bored apes, and punks would both take a hitting a hit. But for a while there, I was pretty wrong. Like, I think bored apes took longer to come back to gravity and like earth, and I think. But the flipping has very much happened.
00:06:51.162 - 00:07:06.294, Speaker A: And oh, here, here's what I got wrong. I said, NFT industry goes through major growth and changes like Defi in 2019. We move past the JPEG era of NFTs did not happen. Still very much in the JPEG era, very much.
00:07:07.354 - 00:07:09.002, Speaker B: I don't think it's going to go away.
00:07:09.138 - 00:07:23.974, Speaker A: Solana survives. There you go. That one did not. I said Solana survives. ETH narrative is reinforced with the merge, zkevms and l two adoption. Everybody loves l two s, but problems with l two start to arise.
00:07:25.674 - 00:07:26.454, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:30.014 - 00:07:41.318, Speaker A: The last one I said was Daos put leaders in place. Didn't you see, like, the synthetics council? But, like, that's not like a new thing, necessarily. I think so.
00:07:41.486 - 00:07:46.470, Speaker B: No, no, no. Yeah. Trying to pull up mine.
00:07:46.542 - 00:07:47.878, Speaker A: I don't have yours, but.
00:07:47.966 - 00:07:52.154, Speaker B: No, no, no, I'm trying. When was this? June, April.
00:07:53.154 - 00:07:54.174, Speaker A: This is James.
00:07:54.554 - 00:07:57.090, Speaker B: Yeah. No, no, no, I'm going through it.
00:07:57.242 - 00:08:14.402, Speaker A: I said, gary Gensler out as SEc chair. That was an optimistic prediction. That did not happen. I said, complete bitcoin miner capitulation. I honestly have not followed the miners closely enough, but I think the miners. But now they're doing pretty well. I think so, yeah.
00:08:14.418 - 00:08:22.264, Speaker B: I mean, it all falls price to large extent. Yeah. Very good.
00:08:22.724 - 00:08:32.424, Speaker A: All right, you want to get into this year's 2023 review? Let me hit you with the first question. 2023 crypto product of the year.
00:08:35.324 - 00:09:11.630, Speaker B: Solana. I'm calling that as a product because most people wrote it off. And. And I think it is a product in the whole conversation around integrated versus modular. And I think people are appreciating the components of Solana as a very unique architecture relative to other competing l one s. And I think most of crypto, whether it's because it's tired or doesn't do enough work, likes to bucket things in a very simplistic way through analogies or through comparisons, but I think was a product. I think Solana is very unique.
00:09:11.630 - 00:09:39.064, Speaker B: There's no surprise people might be looking at my public statements about Solana as something that has just come as of recent. But my history with Solana goes back years. Like, I did that deal early on. I've been a hackathon judge. I've been known them for a long time. And I will say the things that changed for me was just going deeper and deeper and understanding more of the mechanics. There was a big aha.
00:09:39.064 - 00:10:35.520, Speaker B: Moment that I faced that I had not too long ago, because it was really just going deeper into, what are the biggest criticisms of this network? And then inverting and saying, can they be fixed? Are they big enough? Are they real criticisms? And so, anyways, that, to me, was a big inflection point in my understanding of the network. So I think, for me, at least, I see it like every other blockchain. L1. It is a product. I think Solana actually sees themselves as a product and understands what exactly they're trying to build and who they're trying to sell it to. And to me, that was a big realization because a lot of the criticisms around the higher hardware requirements, I think, require you to believe that it is a product and there is someone out there want to pay for a higher hardware requirement. Because if you're building decentralized, synchronized global state that is competing against Nasdaq or NYSE, then yeah, someone will pay for that.
00:10:35.520 - 00:10:42.288, Speaker B: It is hugely, hugely valuable for anyone who comes from finance and other places. Right. So anyways, I think that's product of.
00:10:42.296 - 00:10:58.378, Speaker A: The year, best product of the year. Solana. Mine was two part of Friendtech and Privy. So in my mind, Friendtech almost kicked off the bull market frenzy. Friendtech was the moment where it was like, okay, this market doesn't seem like it's back.
00:10:58.496 - 00:10:58.926, Speaker C: Like now.
00:10:58.950 - 00:11:45.512, Speaker A: I think you can very definitively say we are back in a bull market. Friendtech, if you look back, I think we'll be seen as like this kicked off that bull. Maybe it wasn't, maybe it didn't kick off the bull market, but maybe this was the signal that we were back in the bull market. This frenzy of trading and buying and selling your friend, I know you didn't, I don't think you ever joined Friendtech, but I think Friendtech was the first time we were like, okay, is it decentralized social? Is it consumer? That got a lot of people excited after this kind of twelve month lull. And the secondary product, I would say there is the app, I think, that enabled it, which was privy. So privy brings this kind of like web two caliber ux to crypto products. And I think people saw it for the first time with Friendtech.
00:11:45.512 - 00:11:59.814, Speaker A: I'm not an investor or anything, I have no skin in the game here, but I think it's going to be a really powerful product to onboard this next caliber of folks. And we just started to see what was possible with, with friendtech there. So that would be my product of the year in 2023.
00:12:00.914 - 00:12:01.694, Speaker B: Yep.
00:12:03.074 - 00:12:08.414, Speaker A: Which one are we going to next? How about, uh, how about best founder of the year?
00:12:11.674 - 00:12:12.734, Speaker B: What do you think?
00:12:13.634 - 00:12:34.384, Speaker A: I will say, first off, I am trying to not say the obvious ones. So the best founder in my mind, you know, I think would be probably Brian Armstrong. But I'm trying to not pick on the Brian Armstrongs of the world and the Tolies and Solanas of the world. I would say I'm going to pick a weird one here, which is Luca Netz of pudgies.
00:12:35.684 - 00:12:36.740, Speaker B: We had them on.
00:12:36.892 - 00:13:00.258, Speaker A: Yeah, we. If you look at what pudgies have been able to actually accomplish, I think in the bear market, people wrote nfts off as dead. People said there's no anyone who tries to offer utility. That's a fool's game. They have grown. They have 10 billion views on Giphy, 1 million followers on Instagram. They launched in 2000 Walmarts, they're topping the charts on Amazon.
00:13:00.258 - 00:13:13.380, Speaker A: They're selling out collectibles. They went up to ten ETH or twelve ETH. They launched the Lil pudgies cross chain thing and they're launching their own game that seems to be basically almost built.
00:13:13.562 - 00:13:15.336, Speaker B: The previous seems amazing with a very.
00:13:15.400 - 00:13:17.072, Speaker A: Small amount of capital, mind you.
00:13:17.128 - 00:13:19.400, Speaker B: So I certainly route up to Yuka.
00:13:19.552 - 00:13:22.484, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm giving it to, I'm giving it to Luca of pudgies.
00:13:23.104 - 00:14:14.890, Speaker B: I like that. I'll pick the obvious. And people I think at this point are going to say, like, you totally been sponsored by the Solana foundation or whatnot, but totally for me, because that to me, was instrumental in really, you know, appreciating everything that he has done. And I've always liked him, observing him through this difficult time, how he publicly behaves himself, how he is very grounded, very focused on the product and the end goal for Solana, delivering the best consumer experience. But also, I mean, my God, I mean, Solana hitting its lowest point. And then over this twelve month period, having this kind of like a phoenix rising from the ashes starts from the top. And I think the amount of leadership and like, grit, integrity, like, just commitment that it takes to turn it around.
00:14:14.890 - 00:14:46.940, Speaker B: Of course, it was not just him, but I think speaking to so many of the different Solana based projects that I'm an investor in, they all look up to him. I mean, it is highly influential. And I think in the same way that Vitalik wields a lot of power within the Ethereum community, as you know, Toli is just. Yeah, rose to the occasion and is really like, you know, steered the ship to where it is today. So it has to be him for me.
00:14:47.092 - 00:15:02.634, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think the job of an l one founder is to basically inspire and set the vision and inspire other founders to come in and build. And Tolly's done that better than anyone else. All right, breakout star of the year.
00:15:04.574 - 00:15:07.434, Speaker B: You go for it. I'm cheating.
00:15:08.814 - 00:15:13.502, Speaker A: Not only. Not only do I have an answer for you, but I'm following through on.
00:15:13.518 - 00:15:16.834, Speaker B: Our bet, which is you didn't shave.
00:15:19.814 - 00:15:36.676, Speaker A: Breakout star of the year are the balds. Jeremy Allaire, Brian Armstrong, Mercury and selkus on the policy front, phenomenal job by the balds. And I have followed through and I have shaved my head, as you can see in this picture. Oh, God, you're cheating.
00:15:36.740 - 00:15:54.774, Speaker B: Breakout stars. Is that like a. Does it have to be a single person or can it be a. I guess for you, it was just. Yeah, I think. I think Coinbase, for me, I would agree there. Like it has been.
00:15:54.774 - 00:16:41.058, Speaker B: It continues to be even more so now. The most important company, you know, we've. Look, crypto's always had this regulatory wall of worry. The crackdown intensified and look, some of it is difficult because there is a lot of, you know, there is stuff that needs to be cracked down on, but a policy like that, like the. I guess, like it required someone to push back, right. And say, hey, listen, like, what they've done in fighting against and staking their ground, I think has been really instrumental for the industry. And I've always had faith in the court systems, but, like, actually seeing it, I think they continue to.
00:16:41.058 - 00:17:01.324, Speaker B: They're still fighting. Right. And to me, it requires well resourced, capitalized company. Not only that, but they launch base. And I think they're very much focused on being that onboarding, safe experience for so many people. And I'm really excited about that. I think base, as we think about huge catalysts, base is going to be one from an operating perspective.
00:17:01.324 - 00:17:22.082, Speaker B: And so it is actually really impressive when you think about innovators dilemma, a company that is willing to reinvent itself for the greater good of an industry. And I just think it's going to be a case study not just within crypto, but just in general. The company that was very much focused on making sure that this industry succeeds, even if it comes at the expense of certain revenue lines.
00:17:22.178 - 00:17:43.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I would say Circle's in that same boat. Right? Circle. Remember when Circle owned what, Poloniacs, they had one of the biggest OTC desks in crypto. They had the retail app. In 2017, I was buying more crypto through Circles mobile app than I was through Coinbase. They were one of Coinbase's biggest competitors. And Jeremy basically shut that all down just to go all in on USDC.
00:17:43.014 - 00:17:51.314, Speaker A: I have a feeling circle ends up ipoing. I don't know if it's 2024 or 2025, but that seems like a company successful.
00:17:51.774 - 00:18:03.886, Speaker B: Jeremy, they've also done a lot of regulatory kind of lobbying work since as far as I can remember. But, like, Jeremy's like a highly successful founder. Before, crypto didn't have to do this. Yeah.
00:18:03.910 - 00:18:04.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:04.302 - 00:18:10.710, Speaker B: And he's choosing to do hard things because they matter. And I think that's very impressive.
00:18:10.822 - 00:18:17.254, Speaker A: All right, the bald caps got to come off. That was my bald breakout. Stars of the year with the balds.
00:18:17.414 - 00:18:18.430, Speaker B: There we go.
00:18:18.622 - 00:18:30.614, Speaker A: All right, man. Breakout company of the year. I'm going to give this to two companies in Solana. One is Tensor and one is Jito. If you look at. I mean, the success of. We'll start with Tensor.
00:18:30.614 - 00:19:00.702, Speaker A: Tensor, if you look at the metrics, started the year with, there were kind of four Solana NFT exchanges. There was magic Eden had about, I think it was about 80% of the market share. There was Hayd swap and coral cube and tensor, if I remember correctly. And it was basically magic Eden at 80%, the other two at 5%. Tensor had maybe 2%. I want to say, at the beginning of the year, they have overtaken magic Eden and have just come to basically dominate. Not only.
00:19:00.702 - 00:19:31.056, Speaker A: I think the first thing was dominating the Solana NFT ecosystem, and now, I mean, like, they're in the conversation. When you bring up, it's, you know, opensea blur, tensor, like, they're in the conversation. And I love the two founders. Like, they are just, they epitomize, like, young, scrappy hustlers. You know, keep it very lean. We had one of them on. We had actually both them on Empire, and, like, they refused to get a new headphones because.
00:19:31.056 - 00:19:53.696, Speaker A: Because they're like, we're not out of the. You know, they refused to buy newer headphones, and they're, like, $100 to get new headphones. And I don't know, I just respect that level of scrappiness. It reminds us, reminds me a lot of block works in the early days of block work. So, yeah, tensor would be one of the breakout companies of the year. The other would be Jito. Lucas and the Jito team are just like, they are at the backbone of how all transactions happen in Solana.
00:19:53.696 - 00:20:31.954, Speaker A: They are, like, about as close to the metal as you can get in Solana. And not only that, I think they had a very important emotional moment, almost for Solana ecosystem with their airdrop. So many people made so much money, they basically were able to pull forward and increase the acceleration of the Solana ecosystem, both from a capital perspective. And I think they were this beacon of hope for a lot of other Solana founders saying, oh, my God, we can do this, too. Whether you're tensorflow, whether you're Jupiter, we can launch a token. It can be successful. We can do this even with a young, small, scrappy team.
00:20:31.954 - 00:20:34.854, Speaker A: And I think so, yeah, I would give it to both Tensor and Cheeto here.
00:20:36.434 - 00:20:55.366, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I did have the tensor guys. I interviewed them a couple of weeks ago. Incredible story. People should go listen to that episode. I would agree with that. At risk of not being called too biased in Solana, I'll throw out a few candidates. One is, I think, thematically, this modular movement is incredibly impactful.
00:20:55.366 - 00:21:29.372, Speaker B: I think every technological revolution goes to this unbundling and rebundling phase and the ability to kind of that unlock. I think Celestia was instrumental in that. There's others, of course, but I would think. I very much believe modularity is a very important theme to give more flexibility into how you kind of dissect the different pieces of what a blockchain does. Execution, data availability, consensus and settlement. And I think that is very much a big unlock. And thematically will continue to be a really strong trend.
00:21:29.372 - 00:22:06.804, Speaker B: So probably that the other one is bonk. When you think about how that has been instrumental for. It's rallying, really. It was so impactful for developers that received this airdrop that were in this developer Dao Solana. It was probably what kept them alive. It is the most integrated coin in Solana, and people can laugh off memes, but I think the more you live and breathe crypto, the more you appreciate that. So again, break route, whether you agree then or not, I don't really care.
00:22:06.804 - 00:22:45.464, Speaker B: I think I'm thinking about the impact as I think about breakthrough. That's what I care about. And I think it is. We can argue all you want about memes and how serious they are or not, but I don't think you can win the argument as saying that bog didn't have an impact on Solana and taking it to where it is now, like, rallying it. So I'd be remiss not to mention that I was going to say another again, Jupiter for me was, I think, a breakout company. Why? Because, no surprise, I live and breathe defi. I've been interacting with it since the early days.
00:22:45.464 - 00:23:08.678, Speaker B: I gotta say, the product is phenomenal. It is a delight. And I think the more you talk about, like, when you onboard people, the real. Every time you go to these holiday events, which are, like, painful, right? Oh, you're in crypto. Okay, well, tell me, tell me a crypto company that is actually fun and easy to use. You know, it's always like. It has been a very difficult question to actually, like, answer.
00:23:08.678 - 00:23:09.174, Speaker B: Is that.
00:23:09.214 - 00:23:10.710, Speaker A: Is that how most people talk?
00:23:10.902 - 00:23:34.386, Speaker B: Yes. You know, it's like, you know, cairns of the world, you know, like, it's like, it looks, some of it is right. Jupiter provides very delightful experience. Like the, like, being able to DCA, like, setting limits and. Just a delight. Yeah, it's, it's great. Like, look, whether you want to accept it or not, the biggest use case now is swap.
00:23:34.386 - 00:24:07.744, Speaker B: Like, DeFi is the ability to swap and trade, and it is the primary kind of use of blockchains right now and collecting. But there's still. Tensor is very much like a financial product. Jupiter just has made that delightful. It's really nice and it really makes you appreciate when you have the ability to do things in a very low cost manner. It unlocks nonlinear consumer demand. Like, it's just like, yeah, then, yeah, I'm gonna swap a lot of these things.
00:24:07.744 - 00:24:32.124, Speaker B: Like, the frequency just goes up, orders, magnitude. So I think they built a phenomenal product. I really enjoyed it. And, you know, it's not an endorsement, but it is one of those where, think about it, put it this way, we think about breakout companies or just things that you really like, is what are going to be those two or three companies apps that you point to normies to use. Probably tensor. Probably Jupiter.
00:24:33.464 - 00:24:33.824, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:33.864 - 00:24:34.352, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:34.488 - 00:24:40.608, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I tweeted out early November.
00:24:40.656 - 00:24:41.644, Speaker B: I think it was.
00:24:44.624 - 00:24:49.484, Speaker A: Just how impressed I was by Jupiter. And that was kind of like one of the wake up aha moments I had.
00:24:50.944 - 00:24:51.884, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:24:53.304 - 00:25:03.606, Speaker A: All right. I got some more personal questions. We haven't talked about these. I'm not sure if you're open to answering or what you're not, but best. Yeah, exactly. Put it on. Put the, put the shield on.
00:25:03.606 - 00:25:06.234, Speaker A: Best personal investment of the year.
00:25:09.494 - 00:25:24.158, Speaker B: I sized up Solana aggressively. I called it out in this pot at eight, and I was very much just, you could do it in size. So of course I'm biased, but I.
00:25:24.166 - 00:25:27.150, Speaker A: Don'T even think Solana hit eight. I thought it bought me like twelve.
00:25:27.302 - 00:26:15.234, Speaker B: No, it was like, close to eight, I think. And it was around that time I publicly sit in this pot and it was like, so. But I do a lot of private investments, so maybe I'll highlight things that I'm excited about. There's so many. The problem is, any answer I give, I'm gonna get shit for, like, for some of the others, but I've been paying more attention into public stuff. I think I recently did a deal that I tweeted about. Like, I didn't specifically mention this company, but let's put it this way.
00:26:15.234 - 00:26:51.892, Speaker B: There are. I'll give a copy answer. But, like, think about all the companies that raise a lot of money before the end of the last cycle, you talk to them, they're like, are you getting any love from your investors? No, none of them have talked to us. They've continued to build through the bear. They're building useful, interesting products and categories that get a lot of attention. But for whatever reason, the companies and I've met a few are just not getting any love. And it reminds me so much of last cycle where I met like the OG Defi people, right? Synthetix had raised a huge ICO through haven rebranded.
00:26:51.892 - 00:27:31.414, Speaker B: No one was paying attention. Lend, no one was paying attention. But when you see founders that it has been difficult. Twelve months, continue to build, continue to ship. To me it's like, would I rather invest in a private deal, venture deal where the founder is probably opportunistic. You're going to continue to see from now on forward, you're going to see so many new people come to the space that want to raise for AI for whatever use case, right? Do you understand if that team is going to build through difficult times? Probably not. But what I like about these companies that have shipped and maybe have a token is they haven't given up and they're well resourced.
00:27:31.414 - 00:28:05.668, Speaker B: That's the kind of founder and you have that. It's meaningfully de risked. This company in particular is building really interesting products in the cosmos ecosystem and implementing IBC, you know, which I think is very underrated. It's probably one of the most underrated, underappreciated pieces of tech, but I think it's going to be hugely impactful in multi chain world. So I'm really excited to see that. And yeah, I won't name, I mean, I can name the company, but yeah, I recently did that deal and I'm working with the team very closely.
00:28:05.836 - 00:28:07.188, Speaker A: Who is it? Can you.
00:28:07.356 - 00:28:10.584, Speaker B: Picasso. Picasso. It's a composable finance team.
00:28:12.074 - 00:28:24.786, Speaker A: Yeah, that's funny, man. It's funny watching you get all just. There's a lot of shit being thrown around Twitter right now. Like, you don't share, you don't share your, you don't share the investment. Like people like, oh, you're hiding something. You share it.
00:28:24.890 - 00:28:25.810, Speaker B: You're showing your bags.
00:28:25.842 - 00:28:29.094, Speaker A: You're showing your bags. There's no way to win here.
00:28:29.794 - 00:28:51.564, Speaker B: It really is difficult because I come from a world of like, you know, I don't like, look, none of it is financial advice, not, you know, and people in crypto are very, just generally, like, I just don't feel necessarily comfortable because you have two minutes to describe something and, yeah, like, yeah, it always is kind of uneasy.
00:28:53.144 - 00:29:16.380, Speaker C: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London. March 18 to 20th for blockworks is 8th ever digital asset Summit. Das. This is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie.
00:29:16.380 - 00:29:37.092, Speaker C: It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, charter FIS, JPMorgan framework. Folks coming out. Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs. There are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the having and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, rwas tokenization and stablecoins.
00:29:37.092 - 00:29:55.780, Speaker C: Four, global regulatory frameworks. Five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments. And six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is empire 20.
00:29:55.780 - 00:30:05.236, Speaker C: There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code, and you get 20% off.
00:30:05.260 - 00:30:12.004, Speaker A: That is empire 20. All right, so what about. That's the best. What about the worst investment of the year?
00:30:12.164 - 00:30:13.064, Speaker B: Real estate.
00:30:13.404 - 00:30:15.052, Speaker A: Real estate, 100%.
00:30:15.108 - 00:30:48.622, Speaker B: It's a fucking scam industry. The friction costs of coming in and out. I would argue you rarely, rarely. Like, okay, so you can do a leverage and all this stuff. But, like, man, was I constantly reminded of why we do crypto, because I am I. So I have this very little patience for when I see friction when there's redundancy. Like, when I asked, when I go to a doctor and they ask you to fill up form again, or like, real estate, like, it is a scam industry.
00:30:48.622 - 00:31:21.088, Speaker B: There's all these people that extract fees for no good reason. And it was just, I. It's a scam, really. They, of course, they got. There was a major lawsuit this year of all the realtors that were, like, extracting so many fees. Like, it's just, it's one of those industries. Coincidentally, when I was looking at traditional enterprise software investing, like, there's this company realpage, and they were trying to, like, shake up and modernize real estate industry, but it is just, it is politics.
00:31:21.088 - 00:31:42.274, Speaker B: It's messy, like zoning and development, and it is like, yeah, it's one of those industries where it's slowly, like, finance resisted the modernization thing, and a lot of it is because it's heavily regulated. And I'm just a big believer in deregulation and let markets settle. Anyways, it was a very bad experience because.
00:31:42.394 - 00:31:47.130, Speaker A: Were you doing, were you doing, were you investing alongside developers? Were you investing in real estate funds?
00:31:47.202 - 00:31:58.202, Speaker B: Were you doing. Personally, I've done. I've done sponsor deals for a long time, but no, personally, like, I bought property and, like, it's just unclear to.
00:31:58.218 - 00:32:01.730, Speaker A: Me that you were these, like, multifamily, like, what, what types of single family?
00:32:01.802 - 00:32:18.214, Speaker B: Like, single family. Yeah. I know. It's a very extractive industry. I don't think you outperform. There's a whole host of ongoing fixed costs. I don't think it's a very viable business model, candidly, not just because of high rate environment.
00:32:18.214 - 00:32:24.654, Speaker B: I just think it became more and more popular in a low interest rate environment. You're basically doing a carry trade.
00:32:26.354 - 00:32:26.834, Speaker A: Where.
00:32:26.914 - 00:33:06.234, Speaker B: You'Re borrowing very cheap and then you're renting it out or whatever. But it is probably my worst investment, not just this year, it's just in general, because. Not because I lost money, because of the opportunity cost and the time that I spend. It's really when I, when I think about, as I was going through this exercise, there have been companies in crypto that I've lost more money on, but the time element, time for me is the most expensive thing. And I invested a lot of time, even though I. Yeah, it was just draining. I will probably not ever do it again.
00:33:08.134 - 00:33:11.954, Speaker A: Will you still stay allocated to real estate funds?
00:33:14.454 - 00:33:37.826, Speaker B: No, no. I love crypto, and I'm just constantly reminded that this is my edge and this is where I want to play. And I'm very well into stomach volatility. I think there's ways to go around that and hedge, but I. Yeah, I'm just gonna. By the way, I put in way more risk. I took money outside of real estate, put it way back, more into crypto, and I'm very comfortable with that.
00:33:37.826 - 00:33:42.706, Speaker B: This is where I play. That's what I like, and that's what I'm. You know, I'm not gonna pretend to do anything else.
00:33:42.810 - 00:34:08.826, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. My worst investment of the year, personal investment, was I have a worst angel investment. I mean, on the angel side, a lot of angel deals shut down mid this year. The real, some of the really early ones, early stage one shut down or a couple pivoted to AI in the middle of the AI hype cycle. Like pivoted AI but a couple of them shut down. A couple of them returned $0.20
00:34:08.826 - 00:34:26.624, Speaker A: on the dollar, $0.30 on the dollar. So that was on the angel side. It was actually pretty remarkable to see the variance in how different founders handled it. Some handled it very professionally. I have no. I have no hard feelings against someone who returns capital like that is a very courageous thing to do, in my mind.
00:34:26.624 - 00:34:45.860, Speaker A: And some more people should do it, by the way. Yeah. And I like to the people who returned capital, I was like, I was like, I will back you hands down next time you do it, just because of how respectful and over communicative they were. And then there were some folks who basically just ghosted. I was like, I know you shut down, but come on, buddy.
00:34:45.932 - 00:34:56.846, Speaker B: I'm still tracking down three companies that I'm like, guys, I know you were closing down. Where's the capital? Yeah, I don't care if it's two cent. I don't care if it's $0.99. It's out of principle, just to it.
00:34:56.950 - 00:35:14.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Worst personal investments of the year were probably the Defi majors. I bought some uni, some lido earlier this year, and they just haven't done anything. So just. Just a fool's trade at this point.
00:35:15.774 - 00:35:20.594, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it could be a fool's trade one year, it could be a fantastic trade the next.
00:35:21.646 - 00:35:29.024, Speaker A: So all one. Right, most. What do you want to do? Most exciting founder that you met? Sector that you're most.
00:35:29.524 - 00:35:31.844, Speaker B: Let's do sector to watch in crypto.
00:35:31.924 - 00:35:33.664, Speaker A: Cool sector to watch. What do you got?
00:35:37.004 - 00:36:09.884, Speaker B: Two. One of them probably is alt l one s. And I know it's tiring, but I think it's going to be important to, like, pay attention to different designs. You know, this is aptos sui se, also Solana. Like, I think. Yeah, I think the tricky part of that is that every cycle, there's a bit of fatigue. I think people constantly dismiss them.
00:36:09.884 - 00:36:31.114, Speaker B: There's. I would encourage people to go listen to Jordan was the frictionless capital. Logan, the frictionless capital. Guys. I think they have very, very good content and also appreciation for these. Next. Call it next gen l one s.
00:36:31.114 - 00:37:24.494, Speaker B: My thesis, and I tweeted about this not too long ago, is that this cycle will see a growing divide of the haves and the have nots in terms of where you start seeing usage at scale, and you're certainly seeing it in Solana, but I think it doesn't stop there. And so the question to me is, that's the most important thing. Of course, if you don't compromise security. And of course, there's less Lindy in some of these networks, but I think this cycle, we want it. As I fast forward, like two, three years, it will be a time where finally we start seeing more scale and more mainstream adoption across varying degrees of use cases. Not just collecting, not just, you know, nfts and financialization of such, but more so just real use cases and more users coming on. And I think it will be.
00:37:24.494 - 00:37:54.944, Speaker B: I think that alone will shake up the composition of mind share. And look, I don't want to say this in terms of, like, I'm not being, um, dismissive of ethereum. I think I stand to lose a lot if Ethereum doesn't do well, but I think it's something to pay attention to. Yeah, but I think it's. You could be lazy about it, and I think most people are being lazy about it. And the other one is probably deep in.
00:37:55.964 - 00:37:57.444, Speaker A: Ah, I also had deepin.
00:37:57.524 - 00:38:23.204, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think Deepin is. There's a. It's pretty exciting. It's a lot of things. I mean, it's been around for such a long time, filecoin, you know, live, peer, like, these things exist for such a long time. What is different now, perhaps, is you start to see other kind of more exciting things as well. Like, you know, related to AI, like decentralized compute, you know, the renders and the cautious of the world and the tensors or whatever.
00:38:23.204 - 00:39:10.330, Speaker B: But it also is like helium and hivemapper and all these things. Like crypto, I think is very interesting from a coordination to solve coordination problems. And when you solve coordination problems, it allows you to revisit certain business models. Like, I remember passing on healing the first round, a multi coin guy shared it with me and I said, no, this has been tried before in web two. And boy, was I wrong. Like, you know what I mean? Like, I think that some of these ideas that have been tried in the past are worth revisiting and can actually work with incentives, and it can fix the inertia to bootstrap networks. And I think we're in this state where people being very critical of incentives, that they're not sustainable because most teams don't get them right.
00:39:10.330 - 00:39:26.026, Speaker B: But incentives are instrumental to anything, not just in crypto. And I think crypto, that's the glue of tokens, are the glue to help and coordinate more efficiently. And deepen is kind of primed for that. So, yeah, I think it's a really exciting sector.
00:39:26.130 - 00:39:55.264, Speaker A: Yeah. So I put two sectors, I said restaking, which I can talk more about in the predictions part of this episode. And then deep in. So I said, deepin kind of breaks down into two buckets. There's physical infrastructure and digital infrastructure. So the digital is kind of what has been around for a little while, like file storage and decentralized VPN's, general purpose stuff, machine learning, Akash, things like that. And then there's the physical infrastructure side, which helium was the kind of first movie here.
00:39:55.264 - 00:40:06.588, Speaker A: Then there's hivemapper, but there's, you know, 5G Iot Wi Fi. There's some cool geospatial stuff going on. So, yeah, both the physical infra and the digital infra side of Deepin, I would say we can get into it.
00:40:06.596 - 00:40:06.692, Speaker B: It's.
00:40:06.708 - 00:40:25.034, Speaker A: My first prediction is, like, this kind of ETH is money idea, and this ETH is money narrative is going to start to go away as people realize the best thing right now that ETH has is yield. And, like, that's. That's what's going to. That's what's going to come back. However, um, are you worried about security?
00:40:25.814 - 00:40:27.430, Speaker B: Rehypothecation of security?
00:40:27.582 - 00:40:38.926, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, so, I mean, my fir. Actually, hold on. Before. Before we get into this, like, I want to. I want to kind of cut this episode into. I want to do the slow, slow, slow, slow, Santi, slow.
00:40:38.926 - 00:40:50.254, Speaker A: So, all right, we're going to. We're going to do. We're going to do restaking in a sec. We will. I promise you guys, we will get into that. But we're going to end this episode with the most overhyped sector of 2024. Then we will cut it.
00:40:50.254 - 00:40:57.150, Speaker A: And in the next episode, we are doing our predictions for 2024. So I will ask you, most overhyped sector of 2024.
00:40:57.182 - 00:41:03.194, Speaker B: What do you think coming into this? Like, great question. I don't know.
00:41:05.294 - 00:41:12.834, Speaker A: I'm gonna. I will throw an at you, which is rwAs. I think RWAs was a total bear market narrative.
00:41:13.374 - 00:41:18.392, Speaker B: Wait, but you said 2024. I thought you won most overhyped of 2023, like, coming into 2022.
00:41:18.448 - 00:41:48.614, Speaker A: And what is the most overhyped thing right now? And I think. I think it's Rwas. I think that Rwas are. They're great. Like, I love the centrifuge, guys. And got dinner with Leshner the other night and was talking about super state, which I think is really cool what he's working on. But I just think RWAs are, like, such a bear, like, boring bear market thing that kind of, like everyone talks about in the bear market and then in the bull market, not many people are going to pay attention to it.
00:41:48.694 - 00:42:30.378, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm going to pick AI, mind you. I think the things that are most hyped also have the most amount of opportunity, but it is understanding and dissecting the real versus the non real. I think there's an incredible amount of hype in AI right now. Bitten to Akash, like, all these, in a lot of, like, I've seen like 30 Dex in the last two weeks of, like, the same type of business modeling in AI. Is it real? I think it is. I just recorded a podcast with Daniel from Modulus, which I backed, and Casey, who, like, studied AI before. It was cool.
00:42:30.378 - 00:43:05.204, Speaker B: And, you know, is a fantastic investor, and she really has a good eye for what is real and what is not. So I won't, like, go too much into it, but people should go listen to that episode because I wanted to record that to really, like, parse through what is real, what are the products, and so, and it's just in general, AI. I mean, it's, of course, incredibly fascinating. The thing about technological revolutions, I think, is the timing of it. Right. We tend to over what is it that the fantastic quote from Bill Gates. We overestimate what we can do in two years, underestimate what we can do in ten.
00:43:05.204 - 00:43:34.660, Speaker B: I think that has been true for crypto, and I think that will be true for AI, where everyone's spending all their venture, basically, all the venture funding has gone into putting in order capex for Nvidia H 100s. But a lot of the pitch decks that you see in crypto around, like, you know, like getting access to GPU's on the fly is a bit overdone, I think. Like, certainly, certainly have no rhyme or reason to understand how these things trade.
00:43:34.812 - 00:43:39.204, Speaker A: Yeah, our folks, that wraps up part one of the.
00:43:39.244 - 00:43:40.132, Speaker B: Was that part one?
00:43:40.228 - 00:43:44.104, Speaker A: That was part one. I hope you, I hope you came prepared with your part two.
00:43:44.844 - 00:43:45.508, Speaker B: Yes.
00:43:45.636 - 00:43:50.452, Speaker A: All right, good. All right, folks, we will see you in a couple days. We'll be back, see on the other side.
00:43:50.588 - 00:44:13.272, Speaker B: Are we gonna be back with you? Your shaved head, for real? And I'm willing, as again, I'm willing to shave my beard. All of it. God, this is just, this is like, I'm trying to think of all the crypto companies that, like, pretend to do something but are not really under the hood. Like 99% of cryptography.
00:44:13.448 - 00:44:14.604, Speaker A: Mullet, baby.
00:44:17.424 - 00:44:20.216, Speaker B: All right, all right. Maybe I'll shave my beard for the.

We wanted to take a second to just remind you about our upcoming digital asset summit in London, March 18 to 20th. Santi and I got your back. Seats are limited, and we hooked you up with a 20% off discount code. It is Empire 20. If you heard it earlier in the podcast, there's a little competition running at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets.
