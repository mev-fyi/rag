All right, everyone, welcome to the world's greatest stablecoin episode coming here live on Empire. We have Santi, we have Nick Carter, and we have Martin, first time guest, but sounds like longtime listener, so, Martin, Nick, good to have you guys.
00:00:58.182 - 00:00:58.876, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:58.980 - 00:01:00.060, Speaker C: Thank you for having me.
00:01:00.172 - 00:01:20.188, Speaker A: Yeah, pumped to have you guys. So there's. It's funny, Santino and I have wanted to do a stablecoin episode for a while. There are kind of two ways to approach a stable coin episode. There's like, why are stablecoins set up to be this colossal success? Right? There's US is issuing more debt than ever. China's selling down its treasuries. There's probably the pitch that you would give to a us politician.
00:01:20.188 - 00:01:38.096, Speaker A: Like, we need stable coins to further us dollar demand across the world. Then there's the. Nick, I heard you talk about this in your token 2049 and Mainnet. Talk about. I think it's token 2049. Like eurodollars, stablecoins are kind of almost just doing what euro dollars did 50 years ago. So that's one way to approach this.
00:01:38.096 - 00:02:06.630, Speaker A: The other way to approach this is, look, stable coins are just a better product. They're easier to access us dollars and they're more efficient. And what we're going to try to do here in this episode is accomplish both of those. So, Nick, I'm going to pick on you first. Can you almost just give us, like, the setup for stable coins as you see it today? And you can either approach that from, like, eurodollars perspective or just demand for dollars. I guess they're kind of one in the same, but, yeah, give us the setup for stable coins right now.
00:02:06.782 - 00:03:11.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, my perspective is you can't start with the ways that stable coins are potentially accretive to us interest. That has to be the second part. The first thing has to be okay, what are stable coins good for? Why do people want them? Why are they growing? Or frankly theyre shrinking right now, but why are they generally growing? And then from that okay, given that stable coins are a thing now and theyre not going away, how is that supportive of us interests? How could it be supportive of us interest? So that was the subject of my main net talk. I think my preferred lens is why are stablecoins even a thing? Because I have this notion of the crypto critic in my head just denying the usefulness of stablecoins. And so im always trying to sell the industry to outsiders. That motivated my talk at Mainnet. And I think for that, thats why I wanted to go back into the euro dollars history, sort of the early history of euro dollars, kind of sixties and seventies, to draw those parallels.
00:03:11.306 - 00:03:57.686, Speaker B: Explain. Well, its actually not that uncommon for sort of alternative forms of money to emerge, especially if the local monetary banking system is restrictive in some way. So it's a natural thing that happens to market driven phenomenon. And to push that analogy further, sometimes, even if this is an outside money, not in the literal sense, but a money that's outside the US banking sector, sometimes it ends up being folded in to the formal governance sector in some sense. And that could be the natural progression. We saw it with euro dollars. Obviously with the Fed ultimately embracing the euro dollar system and supporting it, we may well one day see that with stablecoins too.
00:03:57.686 - 00:04:24.534, Speaker B: So the thrust of my argument on stablecoins is its a market driven phenomenon, its emerging in response to real need. Its not an artificial thing. Theres genuine use for this thing worldwide that were seeing, which is also disconnected from crypto speculative dynamics in a large sense. And potentially this thing could be something that the US ends up embracing as opposed to being hostile towards.
00:04:24.574 - 00:04:59.264, Speaker A: Mike yeah, so eurodollars were created as this, I think it was Russia maybe creating them in a french or a uk bank account. Basically the way I understand it is eurodollars are almost like stablecoins that were created as a solution to settle dollar transactions without relying on the traditional banking system. And yeah, I think it was Russia who created them in the fifties or sixties you mentioned, to transact in dollars while avoiding asset seizures. And then you fast forward 60 years and stable coins were created because Bitfinex had trouble banking. Nick, what are the similar like? Can you just double click on euro dollars for sack to kind of share the similarities here?
00:04:59.384 - 00:05:40.224, Speaker B: Yeah there's a bunch. So there's also some disanalogies like euro dollars aren't typically like those are just kind of banking system dollars that are issued out of foreign banks. So not us banks. So they're not strictly backed, as the convention is, with stable coins by all short term treasuries or anything, or cash like that. So those are kind of more ordinary bank liabilities, which are backed by whatever the portfolio of assets it is that that bank has. So that's kind of a big dis analogy that I would emphasize at the start. And they may not even strictly be backed by dollar assets, which is another complication.
00:05:40.224 - 00:06:38.936, Speaker B: But yeah, I think the motive for them was, okay, people wanted to transact with dollars globally, especially as we emerged from World War two. The US became the dominant trading partner for everybody. And the british pound lost its standing in the fifties as a global reserve. And at the same time there were foreign nations that werent necessarily aligned with the US, wanted to transact with dollars, but were concerned that the US would be weaponizing the dollar system, which of course they love to do. So, yeah, I think one of the first examples was Russia creating these dollar deposits in France and later London in banks there, so that they could be more remote from the US banking system. With time, it just became more convenient to do this. Also the US banking system had a whole bunch of restrictions, theres a thing called Reg Q, I believe, which capped the amount of interest that us banks could pay out.
00:06:38.936 - 00:07:43.864, Speaker B: And so there's kind of certain banks realized they could attract dollar deposits, again, foreign banks, they could attract deposits if they offered a higher rate of interest than what the regulatorily defined rate was in the US. And so that's another big reason the euro dollar market grew with time throughout the sixties, as dollar trade became more widespread globally, this market continued to grow. And then in the seventies, we had the oil shock and the emergence of the petrodollar, which was basically the fact that the dollar became this important reserve currency for the trade of oil. The Saudis agreed to sell their oil for dollars and it became essential to have these offshore dollars to facilitate global oil trademark, especially after the oil shock in 73. So at that point, the US, they'd initially been pretty skeptical of the euro dollar market. It was growing without their supervision. They were worried that they would have a loss of monetary control.
00:07:43.864 - 00:08:47.104, Speaker B: We're talking about dollar deposits potentially, which did ultimately eclipse the size of the local domestic banking market. So they were worried about it and kind of puzzled over what to do with it. And ultimately they created sort of dollar liquidity facilities with a lot of foreign central banks, especially the allied ones, so that the dollar deposits in those local banking systems would ultimately be backstopped by the Fed in the time of crisis. So that was kind of like the institutionalization of the eurodollar market, which happened kind of late sixties, early seventies, as the Fed went from being fearful of this thing to kind of embracing it. So the parallels I draw would be, one, a desire to transact with dollars outside of the aegis of the Federal Reserve. Clearly also the case with crypto dollars. Stablecoins exchanges worldwide have had difficulty settling with their clients for years and years.
00:08:47.104 - 00:09:25.626, Speaker B: Bitfinex has been kind of hounded. They were the ones behind tether. That that meant that they could maintain one or two banking relationships and have dollar liquidity with their clients. So that was a huge unlock for them. Another one is the market was an opportunity for these independent offshore regulators and regulatory domiciles to distinguish themselves, which certainly happened with London, with euro dollars. London became the hub of this, and we see happening with stablecoins and crypto. You see certain jurisdictions really embracing it as the US moves away from it.
00:09:25.626 - 00:10:04.094, Speaker B: You see it in Singapore, Bermuda. We'll discuss today, Hong Kong, potentially Dubai. You see a lot of these regulators playing the game to attract these kinds of deposits, track this activity. You saw that with eurodollars. You see that with crypto dollars at variable interest rates, interest rates being zero or low in the US, that facilitated the growth of the eurodollar market, as well as euro dollars offered higher rates. You saw crypto dollars paying higher rates than tradfi in 21, 22. That was a huge thunderstorm here.
00:10:04.094 - 00:10:25.032, Speaker B: Then the last parallel, which hasn't happened yet, hasn't played out yet, is even though the US was initially skeptical of this offshore market, they ultimately found it supportive of their interests. And so that hasn't happened with crypto dollar stables. Right now. The stance is still pretty hostile, but you could expect that ultimately they would kind of see the light and change their mind there.
00:10:25.168 - 00:10:51.934, Speaker A: Yeah, there's this. Let's approach this from the other angle, right, which is like stable coins as the product, right? Better efficiency, better access. And there's this. I don't know if you guys ever listened to Wenzis Casaris, who started Zappo, which ended up becoming Coinbase custody, but he has this quote about. He says, it's, he says, I think the US is the hardest place in the world to explain bitcoin. Why? Because the money works and the government works. And he goes, Argentina is one of the easiest.
00:10:51.934 - 00:10:55.118, Speaker A: And I think, Martin, you are from Argentina or Spencer.
00:10:55.166 - 00:10:56.742, Speaker C: That's correct. Yeah, yeah.
00:10:56.838 - 00:11:09.370, Speaker A: I was looking at this publication in Argentina, which I heard you mentioned on a podcast, and I can share the screen right here. It's Lacion.com forward slash or dot here, I'll share it right here.
00:11:09.442 - 00:11:12.402, Speaker C: Just the homepage. That's the biggest newspaper in the country.
00:11:12.578 - 00:11:37.842, Speaker A: Biggest newspaper in the country. There are $4 amounts here. There are four different, basically rates for dollars. There's the CCL dollar, the tourist dollar, the blue dollar, and the official dollar. So what I'd love to hear from you is basically, why are there four rates and take us on the ground in Argentina to help us understand why is there this demand internationally for both the US dollar and stable coins.
00:11:38.018 - 00:12:18.516, Speaker C: Yeah. So the demand for dollars is the inflation in Argentina right now is like about 100%. So I was in Argentina back in May 1, and the blue dollar was around $400, 400 pesos. So the number that you see there at 800 now was half of what that is. So there is a real inflation problem. The causes are traditional because of inflation, deficit, over printing of money. But then what Argentinians have learned, and the inflation has been over 40% per year since at least 2008.
00:12:18.516 - 00:12:56.436, Speaker C: So Argentinians have learned to inflation is a reality. How do I hedge against inflation? So everyone's a CFO. And the most obvious way in which you hedge against a 40% inflation, you go to a harder currency. And that currency, the default, has been the dollar. So even before stable coins were a thing, you have a market like official market for dollars, that is highly restricted, unless you are connected to the government in some sort of way, or you're doing some of the exempted industries, where you have access to this dollar, you cannot access it. So then a secondary market for dollar gets created. That's the dollar blue.
00:12:56.436 - 00:13:23.302, Speaker C: And then as a secondary market, you have all sorts of ways to arbitrage this market. You can buy stocks in New York and then transfer them to Argentina. That's an implied dollar. That's a CCL. You have a dollar where you can buy casino chips in a casino in Uruguay that has a location in Buenos Aires. So you can arbitrage those two. You can travel to Chile if you're close, and you can swap your card.
00:13:23.302 - 00:13:52.516, Speaker C: And then whatever your card does, it's another dollar. So all these numbers of dollars starts to explode, and then the government starts to control them. So they will put specific taxes to each of these. So you have the dollar Netflix, which is a tax to make sure that the Netflix purchase amounts are very close to what the blue dollar is. So that creates that explosion in numbers. What you see in La Nacion is a summary of the most important ones. There's other sites that have, like, there's like 15 of these dollars.
00:13:52.700 - 00:13:55.180, Speaker B: There's also the dollar crypto, right, which.
00:13:55.212 - 00:13:56.124, Speaker C: Is based on what?
00:13:56.164 - 00:13:57.344, Speaker B: P two P markets.
00:13:57.644 - 00:14:38.304, Speaker C: Dollar crypto is all the P two P markets and all the exchanges. So you have like, that one. If you double, that's an average of, like, a bunch of markets. And the dollar crypto is probably the best predictor of what's going to happen with the dollar, because it's 24/7 right? So all of these exchanges, there's people who arbitrage all these dollars, and stablecoins came in and they offered a better way to access dollars. So what was the way in which we used to save dollars before is you would go and buy dollars in person and you would get a piece of paper. Is that dollar fake or not? You don't know. And sometimes they will put fake dollars in that transaction, and then you try to put them in an atm in the US and they fail.
00:14:38.304 - 00:14:58.094, Speaker C: So you have that risk, you have custody risk of paper money, where you put it in a safe in the bank. 2001, there was a coralito in Argentina. They opened the safes. So, like, the safe in the bank is not safe. So you put it in your home, but someone can break in. So you have a lot of custody problems with. With accessing dollars.
00:14:58.094 - 00:15:21.688, Speaker C: Stablecoins solve a lot of that problem. So stablecoin is a very easy to access. You access it with a local payment network. You buy your dollars, the custody is simpler, and then you can pay other people internationally with. It is just a better product out there. And that's why you're seeing the explosion of stable coins in Argentina. You still have skeptics, right? Like, anywhere.
00:15:21.688 - 00:15:37.272, Speaker C: But the penetration of stable coins are like, everyone will know what they are. And it's just a matter of, do I think I'm sophisticated enough to manage the technology or not? And that's the big question, is the ux, it's not the, do I think this is better than having a dollar in my bank today?
00:15:37.328 - 00:15:46.530, Speaker A: How do you get dollars? How do you get dollar? I've heard you share the story about someone on a. A bike shown up and used Tron. How do you actually get dollars today?
00:15:46.722 - 00:16:31.564, Speaker C: Yeah, so when we were discussing the analysis that Nick presented, we were like, why is tether growing and USDC going down? And I think there's two different markets you have. USDC is more defi. It's more like economic activity in Ethereum. And then USDT is more people accessing dollars in emerging markets. And that market in TrOn is continuing to tether, is continuing to grow, and TrOn is a network that emerging markets are willing to pay for gas just because it's cheaper. So Usdt in Tron is the winner. And all of the network effects in Argentina, but also in Turkey, in all these countries, these guys are winning in terms of how you access it.
00:16:31.564 - 00:17:08.974, Speaker C: There's multiple ways. What most of the, let's say you're a developer in Argentina, you work for a company from Silicon Valley, you get your salary paid in crypto, and you need to pay rent. What you'll do is you'll probably, you have a contact, you message them through WhatsApp and say, I want to sell $1,000. The company, like, it's a small shop, will send someone on a scooter with a bag with, like, their backpack, with a paper bag full of, like, pesos. And like, imagine the pesos. They're, like, super bulky. You have people, like, tourists that go there, like, they take their pictures because it's, like, so much money.
00:17:08.974 - 00:17:35.554, Speaker C: So they have their backpack full of pesos, and then they give you, like, a bag. You don't even count them because it's so many. You just count, like, how many stacks you have, and you give them like, ten bills of 100, or you'll give them a transaction with USDtron settled in person immediately. And then the person just goes and you have your pesos for your rent, for whatever expenses you need to do. And then the opposite is also true.
00:17:35.934 - 00:17:38.114, Speaker D: How much merchant adoption is there?
00:17:39.094 - 00:18:26.032, Speaker C: Merchant adoption? Whoever you want to pay and say, hey, do you take stable coins? They will probably take them. In terms of them pushing for that. You're not going to see signs everywhere about this, because, of course, the government doesn't want this market to materialize. So usually if you ask, you're going to be able to pay for your expenses on USDT. There's also, like, we have a ton of tourism from neighboring countries, Brazil in particular. A lot of the Brazilians that come, they pay with USDT because it's easier than bringing their own currency, and they also save on their own taxes from consuming foreign currencies.
00:18:26.198 - 00:18:28.864, Speaker A: And this happens on Tron because it's cheaper than ETH.
00:18:29.204 - 00:18:52.984, Speaker C: It's cheaper than ETH. I think Tron, the timing in tron was really good. They understood that emerging markets needed something cheaper. And none of the l two s today are going after this market. I feel like you need to actually be on the ground and try to break that network effect. Today, there's cheaper versions than Tron, but Tron just, like, scaled so quickly, and they were the only ones at that point in time.
00:18:53.384 - 00:19:12.680, Speaker A: What is the. So, I know in some emerging markets, I don't know how it works. In Argentina, you can actually have dollars in your bank account. So what is the difference between dollars in a bank account in an emerging market versus claim on a dollar, which is in the bank account? That's basically a claim on the dollar versus a claim on the dollar with something like stablecoins. How do you think about the difference there?
00:19:12.832 - 00:19:49.694, Speaker C: So let's talk about Argentina. But then I think this translates to a lot of emerging countries. So if you have a claim on a dollar on a bank in Argentina, you have a claim on $1 collateralized by whatever that bank has, which usually is not a lot of dollars. If they have dollars, usually they get swapped against notes from the central bank. Until the central bank of Argentina cannot support those notes, they default, and then your dollars get converted into pesos. And that happened in the eighties, it happened in 2001. Probably it will happen again soon because they're argentinian.
00:19:49.694 - 00:20:49.208, Speaker C: Like, if you look at the reserves of the central bank, they are, like, almost going to zero. So you have that claim. When things are good, you feel like you have a dollar until something happens and you don't have a dollar anymore. When you have a stable coin, you are translating that like you're still trusting someone to hold an asset. The question is, you're trusting someone that's regulated, in our case, for instance, Bermuda versus Argentina, and you're trusting a regulator that is telling you, hey, you need to disclose what you have collateralizing these assets, and that collateral is like short term us treasuries versus, in Argentina, it would be a portfolio of credit cards, mortgages, car loans, etcetera. Right? So the collateral quality is way better on a stable, on a well constructed stablecoin. And also the legal framework or the regulator, who you're trusting in the end, you're trusting a centralized party, but who that party is is a higher bar than holding deposits locally.
00:20:49.208 - 00:21:01.284, Speaker C: So I think those are the two main advantages from a claim perspective. The other advantage is just stablecoins being programmatic Internet money. But in terms of the claim, I think those are the two differences.
00:21:02.384 - 00:21:33.374, Speaker D: Do you have a sense of penetration within Argentina? And, Nick, I want to go back to something you said earlier, which is the aggregate demand of stablecoins has actually been shrinking. If you look, over a five, six, seven year period, it's grown tremendously, but in the near term it has sort of stagnated or just gone down. But Martin, maybe if you can give us on the ground adoption within Argentina, within these markets where inflation's ramping, people prefer to hold dollars versus just traders using it because rates are better in tradfi than DeFi.
00:21:33.994 - 00:22:21.870, Speaker C: I think what you said is exactly that USDC is going down because the opportunity cost of holding USDC is 5%. You cannot make that with a level of risk that makes sense in Defi. So people are just exiting, and I would say whoever could exit has already exited the system on the USDT side as a proxy to emerging market use case of stablecoins that continues to grow. Nick invested and sees a lot of deals of centralized exchanges that operate locally in this emerging market. And we also serve them as customers. They are continuing to grow. Right? Like the demand for dollars as stablecoins from local people, but also businesses continues to scale up and the use cases of stable coins continue to build.
00:22:21.870 - 00:22:41.986, Speaker C: So it's like a tale of two worlds. On the speculation side or like very ROI focused side of things, you see a very big decline. I think that will come back pretty soon. But then on the kind of real I need a dollar use case that continues to scale. Yeah.
00:22:42.010 - 00:23:08.390, Speaker B: And it's also like, it really depends what variable you're looking at. I mean, yeah, the, you know, it depends if we're counting ust at all. Not ust, but ust. I mean, that was what, 20, 30 billion in UST at peak. I think that was a loser for the most part. So if you count that, the supply of stables cap would reach 180 billion. I believe if you don't count it, it's less.
00:23:08.390 - 00:23:48.680, Speaker B: And now it's drawn down to around 125 billion. And I think a lot of that drawdown reflects rate sensitivity. I mean, the vast majority of stable coins don't pass along any interest at all. If you're a USDC holder, you presumably have pretty easy access to just getting the treasuries. So it would make sense that as the tradfi rate exceeded the crypto rate, the supply of stables decrease. I think that will turn. I think most folks that are rate sensitive have exited, especially as opportunities get better in the crypto market and sort of the crypto rates starts rivaling the tradfi rate.
00:23:48.680 - 00:24:29.852, Speaker B: Again, I think you'll see that turn. The other metrics to look at are the transactional value of stablecoins is down slightly, not that much over the last two years, but it's flat on a decreasing monetary base, which implies higher velocity. You see that in the numbers. So each unit of your generic unit of stable coin is turning over more frequently. If you look at monthly active users on chain, that's growing, that's at an all time high. So a lot of the usage metrics are actually up or at all time highs. Historically, even though the monetary basis stablecoins.
00:24:29.908 - 00:25:20.974, Speaker C: Is down and anecdotally saty, you're seeing more people that wouldn't use stablecoins in the US. I've onboarded people that are 60, 70 year old that use stable coins because they just trust stable coins better than they trust the local banking system because they use them for payments. So you're seeing that adoption continue to kind of scale up. So I think that it's still like, not like, I think the banking system, at least in our GTA, is still bigger than the stablecoin market. But this is like, stablecoins didn't exist, like practically about like three, four years ago, that TVL was almost like close to zero. And now it is continuing to scale. So I think that that flip will happen at some point pretty soon.
00:25:21.474 - 00:25:33.706, Speaker D: Yeah, like, I believe the, there's one presidential candidate for Argentina who's, you know, very knowledgeable in crypto, very pro crypto, and says at some point we should have, obviously, Argentina and peso, I think I heard him say that.
00:25:33.810 - 00:25:36.250, Speaker A: Is this Mila, the Javier Mila guy?
00:25:36.322 - 00:25:36.810, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:36.922 - 00:26:11.762, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, I'm just curious to understand how you see, like, stablecoin growth continuing in a place like Argentina. Like, what is the, what is a 510 year horizon for, like, hey, do you at one point see all transactions? Just, why wouldn't they be denominated in stable coins? Obviously, you know, the government can come in and force your hand. I'm kind of curious how you. But I think we're nowhere near there. You know, I think that seems like, what are the biggest challenges? Is it, hey, the wallet kind of infrastructure sucks. People are still skeptical of crypto.
00:26:11.762 - 00:26:20.146, Speaker D: People are not very tech savvy or, hey, just merchants don't want it, or the government just hates it. So I'm curious how you think about the limiting factors, too.
00:26:20.290 - 00:26:58.914, Speaker C: I think a good tell story there is Venezuela. Venezuela has had higher inflation and longer than Argentina. And there, if you go to merchants, you do see payment networks, like blockchain payment networks that merchants advertise. And I think that comes to the fact that, like, the dollarization, there is an even stronger case than it is in Argentina, I think there's, of course, a UX problem that I think we need to solve. Right? Like a payment in crypto is. Still takes longer, and it's more complex than a credit card, and it's more complex than cash. Like, we still need to solve that problem.
00:26:58.914 - 00:27:49.994, Speaker C: But then the other problem is, which is the actual tension that merchants have is what happens with the government when they come to enforce, what happens when the tax collection agency comes in and sees this, how do I solve this? And the tension there is that pressure versus continuing to using the peso. I think Venezuela has broken that. And, like, bolivar loses value so much and it's so hard to use. Like, the stacks of money are just, like, so big that, like, they went. They went full in Argentina. I think before you see merchants can actually advertise this as a payment product, you still need a little bit more inflation to kick in. And some of those problems, if millet wins, I think that could be.
00:27:49.994 - 00:28:07.494, Speaker C: I think the transition is easier said than done, but let's imagine that happens. I think that could be massive for stable coins, because then you turn this into an official product. I think there you could see a good sized chunk of the economy moving.
00:28:07.534 - 00:28:14.582, Speaker B: Into stable coins because everyone in Argentina that's using stables is breaking the law, so to speak. Still.
00:28:14.638 - 00:28:15.394, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:28:16.934 - 00:28:29.290, Speaker A: Do they self cut? Like, let's say they're transacting in tether. What are they actually, where are they actually keeping that tether? Are they doing self custodying it? Is it like the defi mullet, just like sitting in a fintech app? Like, what does that actually look like when you pull up your phone?
00:28:29.402 - 00:28:54.944, Speaker C: I would say in terms of individuals, it's 80 20, 80%. Use a fintech app. In terms of volume, like actual stablecoin volume, I would say 50 50. People who hold more tend to soft custody. And especially after Luna happened and all of that, people that have significant balances. And by significant, I mean 20, $30,000. Right? Like, it's not like millions.
00:28:54.944 - 00:29:26.472, Speaker C: Those people are like, okay, I want to soft cast it because they've seen Luna happened and FTX collapse, and they're like, I want to. And they saw the correlit in 2001, so they've seen what happens when banks collapse. Right. It's not a foreign thing for an Argentina to see that. So I think self custard is like, I would say about 50%, but then kind of the more retail, smaller users still use the. The DeFi mule it, and then all of the, like, the 50% of self custard is usually store value. Most of the transactions, I would say it's like 95% happen on the c five side of things.
00:29:26.528 - 00:29:50.904, Speaker D: So is that also because of privacy? Like you wouldn't want to, you wouldn't want to send like a small transaction because people can, you know, inspect the wallet and say, oh, this guy actually has a ton of money, and then you're a target because crime in Argentina, as there is in these emerging countries, is a big problem too. And so the privacy side of things, I don't know if people are truly aware of it, but for that reason, you want to use like a centralized exchange to send out.
00:29:50.984 - 00:30:27.150, Speaker C: I've never heard that. Like, I think in the crypto circle, like, we know this. The reason they use CFI's more is the experience is easier, right? Like you can pay with a QR code, you're connected to the local payment system, you can pay with a card. So like, it's more convenience around the usage of crypto. Like, for instance, myself, I hold dollars on a c five app. I don't hold all of my holdings there, but I hold enough that that is paying me a portion of yield. And then whenever I spend, I spend with my credit card and they get auto converted at the current rate, so that way I don't have to hold any pesos.
00:30:27.150 - 00:30:42.424, Speaker C: I'm not exposed to the peso, but I can still spend locally without, like, I'm never doing a transaction to swap. I never have to estimate how much they're going to spend or anything like that. So I think that's that quality of experience that brings users to c five.
00:30:43.204 - 00:30:55.716, Speaker B: Anecdotally, I'm seeing an explosion in these defi mullet apps, basically mobile money apps, neo bank style apps that are just powered by stables. On the back end are these legacy.
00:30:55.780 - 00:31:03.264, Speaker A: Players, Nick, are these like Monzo and N 26, kind of like the legacy fintech players who just get excited about stables or these new startups?
00:31:03.344 - 00:31:19.724, Speaker B: We're seeing both. We're seeing both. I mean, you're seeing traditional emitters like Moneygram getting into it. You're seeing Martin, you film me. And there's one particularly big one in LATAM that's a legacy player that's getting into stables as well.
00:31:20.104 - 00:31:22.528, Speaker C: There's, well, Mercado Libre, right?
00:31:22.616 - 00:31:23.640, Speaker B: That's what I was thinking.
00:31:23.752 - 00:32:07.426, Speaker C: Yeah, they're like the. They were covered by eBay, but today they work more like an Amazon and they have one of the biggest, like today they're mostly a payments company and they were working with Paxos and recently they signed a deal with USDC, with Circle. They're starting in Chile, but they're going to allow chilean peso to USDC conversion and transactions. So essentially you're bringing the dollar to the biggest payment network in the country. Right. So it is so prevalent that in Argentina they're thinking that they're passing a law so that they open their APIs for other people to use because they're like the biggest winners in the category. So you're talking about like, it's not even Venmo or Zelle.
00:32:07.426 - 00:32:15.802, Speaker C: It's like even more prevalent than that. It's like your visa, if you will, in terms of like how prevalent that is. And those guys are bringing stable coins in.
00:32:15.938 - 00:32:27.328, Speaker B: There's a big deal with Grab, which is like the super app for Southeast Asia. Like when I was in Singapore is grab for everything. And they just signed a stable coin deal, I think just two weeks ago.
00:32:27.456 - 00:32:30.164, Speaker D: Do you know who that was with?
00:32:31.144 - 00:32:43.128, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think it was Paxos, but I'm going to double check. There's also something weird with them where the stable coins are not erc twenty s and grab their something else. Nfts.
00:32:43.296 - 00:32:44.304, Speaker D: Oh, interesting.
00:32:44.384 - 00:32:46.044, Speaker B: Non fungible stable coins.
00:32:46.584 - 00:33:40.418, Speaker D: I wanted to ask you, Nick, as an investor and how you think about these network effects, obviously, you know, I mean, like, it's interesting that TROn has gone traction in these local markets because they just understood the local market, they understood the gasless component. People are really sensitive to that. But what's really stopping any of these neo banks saying, hey, we can do exactly what tether is doing and maybe in a better way without the checkered background or whatever. And then like, it just feels like there's a ton of opportunity to launch maybe even other denominated major currency denominations like euro stablecoin. We haven't seen really a large euro denominated stablecoins like circles come out. But I would think that there's a lot of appetite and a huge opportunity to even maybe take advantage in undercutting someone like tether and saying, hey, we're going to actually pass through some of the yield, half of it or whatnot, to the end customer. And that's huge.
00:33:40.418 - 00:34:05.134, Speaker D: Now you're giving people access to a more stable currency and yield for folks. The appendix here is the amount of profitability. Tether is hugely profitable, maker is hugely profitable, but they're not passing that yield over like traditional banks. So I'm curious, Nick, how you think about is this an investible opportunity or do local rules, regulations really give you pause?
00:34:05.254 - 00:34:29.526, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a great question. I think the status quo, whereby some entity that has a float, some financial intermediary, they're leaving it all on the table and all of the underlying yields are going to the issuer. That's not going to be the case on a go forward basis, of course. I mean, tether earns, I don't know, $86 billion. Market cap rates are 5%.
00:34:29.630 - 00:34:35.314, Speaker D: Aren't they like the top five largest holder of US Treasuries? Like more than like some of the Emirati countries?
00:34:36.014 - 00:35:13.534, Speaker B: I think I did the numbers recently. I think all the FiabAC stable coins collectively would be considered the 16th largest holder of treasuries of the sovereign level. Very big. But yeah, tether is larger than some sovereign nations for sure, than many, and they have 60 employees. So I believe they're the most profitable business per employee on the planet, which is remarkable. We're seeing a shift where exchanges, really, anyone with a float will either partner with an interest bearing stable coin, or partner with a non interest bearing stable coin, but receive some of that yield, or roll their own stablecoin. So we're seeing both things happening.
00:35:13.534 - 00:35:59.484, Speaker B: I'm seeing stablecoin as a service, startups getting traction going to some of these neo banks, remitters, anyone with a float, and helping them launch and list their own stablecoins. Because rates are so high, anybody that has a float is a bank now. And for a stablecoin, if you choose not to pay into the yield, it's massively accretive. So the whole terrain is changing. And the big stable coin issuers tether might be a special case, because they feel like they've such an advantage in network effect that they can not change anything about the business model. But USDC, the number two, they now realize they need to react. Paxos whole business model is white label stable coins.
00:35:59.484 - 00:36:20.104, Speaker B: Like busD, for instance. They had a rob share with binance. We're seeing not tether, but the other top stable coins realize they need to start passing along some of the yield, whether through partnerships, or they'll be disrupted by the interest bearing stable coins like mountain. And there's many others as well.
00:36:21.764 - 00:37:17.004, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new DeFi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Bumper alleviates this by allowing you, the user, to lock your tokens into the protocol and set a price, no matter how much the market fluctuates, your investment in your token won't fall below the predetermined value. When you compare this to traditional options platforms, Bumper offers a non custodial and actually cheaper, on average alternative that protects the value of your crypto from market price drops. If you are looking to earn a yield on your crypto, bumper has you covered. By depositing USDC into the bumper protocol, you can earn a return which is derived from the premiums paid by protection buyers. Early adopters and empire listeners have a chance to claim a part of the $250,000 early adopter bump rewards.
00:37:17.004 - 00:37:46.490, Speaker A: Go check out bumper. It's bumper five. Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global team's tokens. From easy to use Token grant award templates, through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure.
00:37:46.490 - 00:38:32.758, Speaker A: Token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted token units to token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens for legal finance and HR teams. It is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens, not to mention the payroll tax obligations, tax reporting in every country that you employ someone, it is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly. And it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments. Governments. Toku makes this simple.

00:38:32.758 - 00:39:02.758, Speaker A: empire or click the link in the description. Nick, what do you think? You mentioned this one thing about regulation. You said a lot of the folks in Argentina who are still using tether in this way, I think it's kind of illegal and how they're doing it. The government could inevitably come after them if they really wanted to crack down on this. What do you think of crypto collateralized stables? And I think roughly we're at five or 6% of the market today. Where does that market go if you fast forward 2345 years?
00:39:02.926 - 00:39:48.262, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's interesting how you count it, because Dai started as a fully, right. I was trying to figure out, and I think if you look at it today, it's like maybe less than 20% of the supply of daIs. Actually, Ethan, there are newer ones like raft libre finance, Athena is launching. That will be, I think, solely staked ETH based on staked ETH derivatives. Dai is a funny story, because, of course, they started as this pure thing where they were just backed by ETH, and then over time, they became a USDC interface, and now they're RWA interface. So I think if you did the full accounting, it would be less than 2% of the stablecoin supply, which is truly crypto collateralized, which I think is a shame. I think we need an array of different options.
00:39:48.262 - 00:40:26.890, Speaker B: We need the sort of quite regulated, fiat backed in a variety of different jurisdictions. But also, I think there is an unmet need for more decentralized, maybe even completely smart, contract based stable coins that are issued based on crypto collateral. The fact that ETH pays a yield now is, I think, really accretive. I think that segment will now become economical. It wasn't really before Dai had these issues where they couldn't keep the peg, and so they had to introduce USDC into the mix. The fact that ETH now has this yield. Yeah, this is the slide.
00:40:26.890 - 00:40:56.314, Speaker B: The fact that he says this yield means that this is not possible. I think so. I see this growing. People maybe have some, like, PTSD from terra Luna, but it was a very different situation. I mean, Terra just was not reserved. I mean, it was, it was very partially collateralized. All these models have different collateralization approaches, but they're all fully collateralized, at least in theory.
00:40:56.314 - 00:41:25.784, Speaker B: So I think, like, the people, you know, they still kind of struggle a little bit with the UST thing, and, and they. Because USD's whole narrative was, this has to be a crypto native stablecoin. That's the only way to have it be decentralized. And so if using that same language to sell people on your news, stable coin, people might be suspicious. Yeah, I think this will be a very meaningful segment. Some people will always want the most crypto native, most decentralized solution. So I think you'll see winners here.
00:41:25.784 - 00:41:32.474, Speaker B: I think you could see north of 10% of stablecoin market cap be sort of crypto, crypto based stables.
00:41:34.214 - 00:42:12.494, Speaker D: If you were to design a protocol today, like, obviously, there's been countless, like, algorithmic stable coins and experiments. It's a hugely, like, fascinating field, like, from game theoretical perspective. And I think we, we haven't stopped with, like, there, there will continue to be experiments. Like, how would you design it? There have been, like, people talking about, like, linking it to inflation or purchasing power locally, but then that's huge fragmentation. Do you base it off of something off of the dollar or like, some sort of commodity. If you were to like wave a wand and design something like, how would you do it?
00:42:14.034 - 00:42:33.672, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm curious. I wouldn't want it to, I wouldn't want to link it to a unit of account that's not the dollar actually, because you run into troubles when you have something that's appreciating relative to the dollar. And also there are gold backed stable coins, they haven't, they're not really that popular.
00:42:33.848 - 00:42:35.680, Speaker D: Like Paxos has one.
00:42:35.792 - 00:42:48.816, Speaker B: Yeah, Paxos tether has one too. And I know Brian Armstrong talked about flat coins. I think those meant to be inflation indexed. I didn't even know how you'd accomplish that, frankly.
00:42:49.000 - 00:42:50.776, Speaker A: You need a better CPI first.
00:42:50.920 - 00:42:57.844, Speaker D: Well, yeah, moving target, that is the definition of inflation. But tips, right.
00:42:58.864 - 00:43:26.818, Speaker B: A is a geographically contingent thing. So to me, inventing a new unit of account is a huge mental hurdle for people. And I think that is why stable coins are so dollarized, is people dont want to do accounting and all kinds of arcane currencies. Bitcoin started off as a crypto unit of account on exchanges. Remember all these prices were quoted in units of bitcoin. That was this massive mental friction. I mean, even you had nfTs.
00:43:26.818 - 00:43:43.490, Speaker B: ETH was the unit of account for NFTs is ETH. It is ETH still? Yeah, it is ETH still. But then you have to like to do this additional transformation. It's like, well, you know, did I win on this trade or lose on the trade to, you know, incorporate the ETH exchange rate? It's like this whole, that's assuming you're.
00:43:43.522 - 00:43:56.770, Speaker D: Cashing out, right, but because if you conceptually think of the economy as denominated ETH, and then, and you're never cashing out in the real world, like in the metaverse. And you know, presumably you could always think about in ETH terms, but at some point you gotta feed yourself and that is still in dollars.
00:43:56.882 - 00:44:00.214, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an optimistic approach, I think.
00:44:00.954 - 00:44:03.802, Speaker D: I'm not like that, I'm just, you.
00:44:03.818 - 00:44:09.214, Speaker B: Should really be thinking of it in units of like avocados and steak and, you know.
00:44:11.594 - 00:44:11.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:11.930 - 00:44:43.444, Speaker B: Like ultimately it's all about purchasing power. It's all, it's ultimate about your real purchasing power. So I just from, I think from what we've seen, like trying to devise a new unit of account is difficult. And we saw, was it the Rye guys, they had their stable coin, which was initially launching units of PI dollars, as in like $3.14, not like the food. And that really confused people. It was like flat in dollar terms, but it was a different unit of account, which was endlessly confusing.
00:44:43.444 - 00:44:48.584, Speaker B: So I would do it in dollars, you know, I would just do it in plain old dollars.
00:44:48.924 - 00:45:21.806, Speaker C: I have. We thought a lot about this, right? Whether you want to be money or whether you want to be an investment. And I think there's. There's two different categories there. And if you want to be money, it has to be very simple for people to think how much money they're sending you without any math. So, for Lido's example, they did stake Deeth, which pegs to Ethan, which makes it very easy for you to know how much money you have whenever you acquire this asset. And they decided to be kind of like EOA first or kind of like consumer first and then defi second.
00:45:21.806 - 00:45:39.830, Speaker C: And they had to do rap, stake, deed. And a lot of the complications that came with that. But I think that was the right choice, despite all the work that happened with integrations. I think for stablecoins, you're going to see the same thing. You're going to have stable coins that are worth always $1. We took that route. And then stable coins that will appreciate in value.
00:45:39.830 - 00:46:20.406, Speaker C: We have the wrap USDM. And the question is, do you want to be defi first, right, to prioritize integrations, or do you want to be money first and make it easy for people to do payments in your currency? And to me, of course, dollars is the biggest market, but in general, the take has to be, you have to be one of whatever people think, right? So it's $1, r1, €1. That that needs to be the unit. And then I think inflation coins or flat coins or energy based coins and so on, they're going to end up being investments. But I don't see, like, someone like my mom sending a payment on a flat coin. Like, how is she going to do the math, right?
00:46:20.510 - 00:46:21.998, Speaker D: So too much mental overhead.
00:46:22.046 - 00:46:28.078, Speaker C: It's a question of, like, do you want to be money or do you want to be an investment? And I think that's the key.
00:46:28.246 - 00:47:10.598, Speaker D: I mean, what you could do is you have. And what I want to ask you guys is, obviously, you're doing sounds like the same model of fully collateralized or largely collateralized, go out and buy treasuries or a basket of high grade stuff, whatever it is. And then you clip some yield, and then you can wrap. You can have versions of said, whatever coin you have, and then people can trade illiquidity for some yield through a wrap version of the underlying thing that is always kind of resembles one to one to a dollar, and shouldn't lose its peg unless people have concerns around your credit history.
00:47:10.726 - 00:48:01.698, Speaker C: So the way we think about the peg is most stable coins are backed by traffic assets, or at least all the fiat backed stable coins are. So you always have this question of reserves are there. But like, if everyone wants to redeem on a Saturday, like, there's no way to access it, right? Because the market opens on Monday, and then you have t plus one settlement and so on. So there's always the liquidity concept like arrangement of the stablecoin. But if your collateral is good, which I think the consensus today is short term yield treasuries, no commercial paper, no long term assets, those should always be good as long as your setup is correct. The second point is, okay, now that you have this asset, how do you make it yield bearing from a stablecoin perspective and also allow for the appreciating asset. So I think staked.
00:48:01.698 - 00:48:33.134, Speaker C: It's the right formula. Right. So you get airdropped in a very efficient way, which is the rebasing. So if you have your eOa, you just see money coming in every day without having to do anything. And then if you wanted to use it in Defi as a collateral, as anything else, you wrap it and that becomes a constant balance ERC 20, that most of Defi knows how to work with. So, yeah, I think that's the model that at least we talk a lot with several issuers. Transfero in Brazil, we talk with noom finance.
00:48:33.134 - 00:48:42.586, Speaker C: They are issuing coins in several countries. Everyone is going with the same model. Right? Like pegged, like plain asset and then wrapped. Appreciating asset.
00:48:42.670 - 00:49:01.130, Speaker D: Yeah, I want to double click on something you said earlier, which is what happens on the weekends, which there's some limitations. Right? Like we saw this with circle a few months back, I think it was six months where because of this lack of infrastructure, like certain big players have started, have stopped operating during the weekend.
00:49:01.282 - 00:49:07.890, Speaker B: Yeah, the US government destroyed. Well, that signet. Like that was.
00:49:07.962 - 00:49:09.002, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:49:09.058 - 00:49:10.428, Speaker B: That was their usefulness.
00:49:10.546 - 00:49:59.496, Speaker D: As that went away that weekend or the following weekend, there was huge concerns around being able to actually settle these things. And so you saw the USDC deep peg for any rational investor. You look at that and that's an efficiency. It should go back to the peg. But those moments of deviation from the peg, I think, really hurt consumer confidence in using something like USDC. So the question to you guys is, like, again, going back to this idea, like, how do you see like that as a challenge and overcoming those moments where, you know, the dollar never deviates because, you know, at the end of the day, you're trusting the fighter planes and the muscle of the United States to be the dominant.
00:49:59.680 - 00:50:10.144, Speaker C: Let me, let me. Let me caveat that the dollar does deviate. If you go to Argentina with a dollar, the old dollar that has a small face versus the big. Oh, right, yeah, there's like, those deviate.
00:50:11.284 - 00:50:13.100, Speaker B: Hang on a second. You gotta explain this.
00:50:13.132 - 00:50:14.068, Speaker C: So this is an insane.
00:50:14.116 - 00:50:17.220, Speaker D: There's some dollar bills that people, like, in other countries do not.
00:50:17.252 - 00:50:17.396, Speaker C: Like.
00:50:17.420 - 00:50:18.900, Speaker B: They're like, there's non fungibility.
00:50:19.052 - 00:50:28.636, Speaker C: Exactly. So even the dollar is non fungible. So this is not only a crypto thing. We can get to the crypto weekend liquidity. I have lots of opinions there. But, like, the. This story is funny.
00:50:28.636 - 00:51:03.576, Speaker C: So if you go to an ATM in the US and you insert, I think it's the small face, the one that's the newest. And the big face we're talking about, Benjamin, it's $100. You put a big face. I think the big phase will be returned more often than the small phase. So the ATM will not take it because it had, I think, lower security, kind of for counterfeit. So if you go to Argentina with the big face, they will discount that, like, one or 2% from the traditional. Like the newer version of the dollar.
00:51:03.576 - 00:51:04.328, Speaker C: Yeah, there you go.
00:51:04.416 - 00:51:04.824, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:04.904 - 00:51:07.656, Speaker C: So even the dollar is not completely.
00:51:07.720 - 00:51:11.024, Speaker D: Some of them don't even take them. They're like, no, come back with a real one.
00:51:11.184 - 00:51:21.464, Speaker B: This actually happened to me in Singapore. I gave. I was paying them physical us dollars for some reason. For an Uber, the driver is like, yeah, I can't take those. They're crinkled. They're too crinkled. The money changes are gonna take them.
00:51:21.464 - 00:51:35.894, Speaker B: And so I fanned out every dollar in my wallet. I'm like, you pick, like, a deck of cards, pick the ones he want. And he's like, going through. And, like, there's non fungibility with even how wrinkled the dollars are, the further you get it from the US.
00:51:36.874 - 00:52:08.048, Speaker C: Nice and crispy. Yeah. So that is with the fungibility of the dollar. Not every dollar looks the same. I think if we go to the private money eras, the private bank notes were like, we're taking differently. Like, depending on the distance and how hard it was to actually redeem that value. So I think this kind of, like, the note that is redeemable at $1 for a certain number of parties being valued at a different price than the redeemability price is something that is constant in the economy.
00:52:08.048 - 00:52:50.040, Speaker C: Right? Like now we're seeing it with stable coins, but we've seen it with other assets in the past. In terms of the weekend that I think the circle weekend is a very good learning lesson because we had two things at the same time. We had a liquidity question, right? Like you couldn't access redemption of USDC Coinbase stopped the one to one conversion on prime. But there was also a solvency question on the reserves, right? There was a. Estimates were 3% hole in the reserves. And the thing about a hole in the reserves is the last man standing will eat 100% of the loss. So you have a game theory problem where if you redeem early, you might collect something, but if 97% of the people redeem and you go, you get zero.
00:52:50.162 - 00:52:56.076, Speaker B: Yeah, because it's a first and first out basis. It's not your pro rata share of the reserves.
00:52:56.180 - 00:53:29.830, Speaker C: Exactly. Until they go for bankruptcy. But like, you cannot declare bankruptcy on the weekend. And if you do, then the question is like, what is the cut of time that the bankruptcy court is going to take? So you have. Once you get into solvency questions, I think the fear is a lot more rational than it is when it is a liquidity question. So I think that's the learning from the, the circle weaken is you have a liquidity problem, but you also have a big solvency question. And the big thing there, I think is like in the pyramid of money, you used to have gold, now you don't have that anymore.
00:53:29.830 - 00:53:51.130, Speaker C: You have fed reserves. You cannot access that as any stable coin issuer. So those are not accessible. So the next thing is T bills. But then you have bank deposits. And bank deposits are uninsured loan to a hedge fund that happens to be license as a bank. But like if that health fund goes under, you lose your assets above whatever the insurance level is.
00:53:51.162 - 00:54:03.014, Speaker D: During the regional banking crisis, I think a lot of people realize that that discrepancy and then move directly into t bills because, yeah, if in a situation of bankruptcy, you know, it's quite different treatment.
00:54:03.554 - 00:54:44.768, Speaker C: And the question is, as a stable condition, what do you do now? Right? So you know that banks are risky. No matter what bank you have, you still have a percentage risk that it goes under unless it's adjacent. But JCIBs won't bank stablecoin issuers for several reasons. So the question is how do you build your reserve structure and how do you ensure liquidity by doing that. So everyone is innovating and trying new things. For instance, what we do of course, the SLA for every stable coin issuer is t plus two, but no one wants to go t two because that affects your secondary market price if market makers cannot redeem. So what we are building is a network of partners that allow us to do crypto repo transactions.
00:54:44.768 - 00:55:18.462, Speaker C: So that sounds like a very complex way of saying, take a USDM, which is a claim on a t plus two basis, and give me a USDC or USDT now and then I'll pay a fee. And then you use big balance sheets. So people that are actively working in crypto to access this liquidity on a kind of as needed basis, I think the market is going to go more towards that type of solution to solving liquidity, rather than bank deposits or other forms of liquidity. I think you'll see other experiments, but that's the direction we are going.
00:55:18.598 - 00:56:17.290, Speaker B: One of the big tragedies of stables in this country, one of the things that's holding the sector back is the fact that there were two networks which allowed fiat to move at the speed of crypto for the sake of weekend settlement, for stablecoins, which was sun insignet, and in the process of the banks failing or being murdered, whatever your opinion is in this country, my view, they were assassinated. They didn't just suicide themselves. You know, who is the sniper? The Nydfs. In the case of signature, you know, like signature, I think in particular, was one of the big casualties here. Apparently solvent. When they were shuttered, Cygnet, which was their fiat clearing network, which allowed dollars to move at the speed of crypto, that one was not sold in the FDIC acquisition process, where they were divesting all the signature assets. They just let that wither on the vine, which is crazy.
00:56:17.290 - 00:56:40.714, Speaker B: No other bank has been able to build anything like that because they're terrified of the signature treatment happening to them. So that's something people don't talk about. Stablecoin infrastructure in this country was degraded because we lost these fiat clearing networks. And you need fiat to move at the speed of crypto, otherwise you get these discrepancies when we're not in banking hours.
00:56:41.014 - 00:56:41.398, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:41.446 - 00:56:45.674, Speaker D: And can you just briefly explain how Cygnet worked?
00:56:46.294 - 00:56:49.278, Speaker B: Oh, man. Martin, I might have to draft you in for this one.
00:56:49.366 - 00:56:53.654, Speaker D: It sounds like it's just basically, Martin, what you're talking about, like this repo market, but yeah, yeah.
00:56:53.734 - 00:56:59.230, Speaker C: Cygnet was a. I think they even used a private blockchain internally.
00:56:59.302 - 00:57:02.310, Speaker B: So essentially what they did is they.
00:57:02.342 - 00:57:44.616, Speaker C: Extended the, like, you had to be a customer of signet to participate. So every participant was a kybid. So imagine this is a fully kybid private blockchain. And then your wallet, which was your account balance, could be transferred 24/7 so what they did is they opened this window from kind of like the traditional Monday through Friday banking hours timeline to 24/7 for internal transfers. If you wanted to do a wire or access any other type of payment network, you had to go outside. But if you were dealing with circle and another exchange, and your market maker and everyone was in the same ecosystem, you could do all those settlements as long as you had balances in the account 24/7 so, amazing product.
00:57:44.800 - 00:58:32.552, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the, the beauty of it, and this is why it can't be rebuilt today, was that most of the relevant crypto entities in the US were banked by either Silvergate or signature, in particular. Signature. The problem was, after FTX, the Fed went to all the banks and they said, yeah, you cant have more than 15% of your deposits be pertaining to crypto. This meant that none of the banks could get a critical mass of crypto firms all on their own internal network. So it was kind of a nice point in time that we had like two years of functioning fiat infrastructure on the crypto side. And ever since the Fed created that edict, now the banks can't get that network effect, so nobody's able to do it today.
00:58:32.728 - 00:59:07.054, Speaker C: And if you go offshore, you still need a correspondent bank in the US to access, like, for money to come in and out from your ecosystem. Right. So you still need access to swift or wire infrastructure with a corresponding bank. So in the end, even though this bank is offshore, the US establishment, pushing the correspondent bank means it's very, very hard to actually build and advertise and all of that, even if you are outside of the United States. So that's also what's making it very hard for this network effect to build in banks in other jurisdictions.
00:59:07.594 - 00:59:19.740, Speaker D: Exactly. So that's what I wanted to go back to, which is this repo kind of market that you're talking about. I mean, ultimately, wouldn't you face the same constraints or challenges if you try to access, like, the swift network or you're kind of not even touching that.
00:59:19.852 - 01:00:01.276, Speaker C: So the good thing about a crypto repo market is you do that fully on chain. So let's say you have USDM fully backed by treasuries. I send it to you on a Saturday, you send me USDC, I send it to my customer. So then the customer fills immediate redemptions, and then I repurchase that USDM on a Tuesday from you. So essentially what I need is traditional bank access. I don't need a bank that banks everyone else, because I will settle that transaction via traditional fedwire and on ramp without needing that bank to bank all of my other partners. So it's kind of like a good solution for now.
01:00:01.276 - 01:00:05.620, Speaker C: Of course, the previous solution was way better, but this solution allows you to.
01:00:05.652 - 01:00:18.390, Speaker D: Provide that immediately, swapping, like for like stable coins. So you're never actually interacting with the traditional rails. It's just all within. So assuming that the corresponding parties agree to that and are okay with it.
01:00:18.462 - 01:00:25.446, Speaker B: You need a counterparty with Us DC reserves that's. They're willing to part with it on the weekend in exchange for a fee, right?
01:00:25.470 - 01:00:48.880, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah. And usually if you're a market maker, right, you have a ton of, like a ton of you're making markets. So you have this USDC in several places. And these balance sheets tend to be like, you can go from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Right. So this scales to like that level, you are not going to be able to settle transactions on the tens of billions, but at like that level, you can if you pay.
01:00:48.880 - 01:00:51.224, Speaker C: Like, the question is, what apy are you paying them?
01:00:51.264 - 01:00:53.128, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just sort of market clearing rate.
01:00:53.256 - 01:00:55.204, Speaker C: Exactly. So, yeah.
01:00:55.664 - 01:00:57.896, Speaker D: And where are you in terms of developing that?
01:00:58.080 - 01:01:02.232, Speaker C: So there's an announcement that's going to come up pretty soon, so you can.
01:01:02.248 - 01:01:03.912, Speaker D: Make it now if you want. I mean, we love announcements.
01:01:04.008 - 01:01:27.056, Speaker C: Yeah, let's see Chris there. But, yeah, we're going to make this announcement with a partnership pretty soon, and then that will allow anyone who holds our token to swap into other types of stables, even on the weekends at a very large rate, instead of having to wait for ducktiplus two.
01:01:27.200 - 01:01:42.674, Speaker D: And this repo market, do you envision it being mostly or exclusively institutional, or do you have like, you know, like a construct like AMM has basically allowed anyone to be a market maker? So would presumably retail be able to play in this market and earn a yield?
01:01:42.834 - 01:02:39.060, Speaker C: I think the retail market participates. So the flow of funds is you generate an asymmetry in the AMM, which triggers the market maker to try to balance that out, and that requests money from us. So in the end, our customer would be, in this case, most likely the market maker, or it would be a large centralized exchange. What we were going back earlier, doing their own stable, having large redemptions over the weekend, so they would sell into us a lot of USDM. So those would probably be the two biggest customers. And then for you as a consumer, the benefit of this repo market existing is the secondary market price is very tight to one on the weekends, which if you don't have it on the weekends, you should see a higher spread, because for the opportunity to be worthwhile, usually for you to take longer term, like exposure, the opportunity is to be better than an arbitrage. Right.
01:02:39.060 - 01:02:40.428, Speaker C: So that's the benefit for you.
01:02:40.516 - 01:03:03.932, Speaker D: When we've seen some inefficiencies between centralized exchanges and deFi, that ARB usually goes away fairly quickly. And that's the beauty of like, the interaction of these two ecosystems, is that these arbitrages get arped out fairly quickly because sophisticated players just. And so it keeps the system presumably imbalanced, unless there's, of course, a fundamental, like going concern of degradation and trust.
01:03:04.108 - 01:03:28.516, Speaker C: Exactly. The power of the arbitrage is it's delta neutral, so you're not taking any directional risk on anything. So if you're going to make $7 and gas is five, the bot will make that transaction and will capture those $2. Whereas taking a liquid liquidity arbitrage, where you're waiting for Tuesday, you're going long on a specific asset. So that number needs to be better. And it's probably on the thousands for someone to come in and make that deal.
01:03:28.620 - 01:04:02.574, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, Nick, I want to. I mean, obviously we're recording this episode, and over the weekend we were talking about yet another government shutdown in the US. And of course, we keep talking about the unsustainability of the growing debt and interest expense and the long we keep going back this. And I don't want to make this like a political, you know, an economic like, podcast, but I'd be remiss not to bring it up. And I want to get your takes on just how you think about. Again, the collateral here is treasuries. Sounds like everyone's, like, gravitating to that.
01:04:02.574 - 01:04:16.686, Speaker D: Like, what are your thoughts around, just generally the fiscal irresponsibility and state of not just the US government, but other governments and what is the most pristine collateral, and how do you see that evolving, if we're changing at all?
01:04:16.790 - 01:05:05.670, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. It is kind of ironic that we're talking about bring treasuries on chain and stable coins, of course, are all backed by treasuries. And then the treasury is something that us crypto people have been kind of trashing for the better part of a decade now. But it's interesting. I mean, treasury yields were deeply negative for a while in real terms, and now they're actually positive, which is pretty cool. So everyone like Luke Grohman likes to talk about financial repression, which means you run inflation hot and you pay a lower nominal yield. So then the delta means the government can reset their debt position, bring down the debt in real terms, which actually they were able to do a certain amount with the negative real yields that we saw right now today, yields are positive in real terms.
01:05:05.670 - 01:05:23.736, Speaker B: So it's pretty remarkable. So that's good for savers. Of course that's bad for the government, right? So we really looking at the debt charts here, I mean, these are official us, these are CBO projections, the government's own projections, where you just see the debt to GDP level just going parabolic.
01:05:23.800 - 01:05:24.764, Speaker A: That's nuts.
01:05:25.664 - 01:05:31.444, Speaker B: And yeah, I mean, it is nonlinear interest expense is over a trillion dollars. Now.
01:05:33.664 - 01:05:48.724, Speaker D: If this country, this slides, if you slap away, you just look at that and you say if it was Greece or Turkey or Argentina or any other country that's running debt to GDP levels of this nature, there would be a huge, huge degradation trust. And then you would see like a deep, like a.
01:05:50.104 - 01:06:25.794, Speaker B: And the other feature is, I mean, foreign holders of treasuries are divesting. So Japan is divesting for kind of mechanical reasons to defend the yen, and China is divesting, I would say, for more political reasons, which is they fear the Russia treatment, even though it'd be kind of mutually sure destruction. If we seize China's reserves. I think they, you know, no one had ever seen the US sanction a g 20 nation before. Like, we've sanctioned small nations many times and seize their reserves. Venezuela, Afghanistan, Libya. I think we did it too.
01:06:25.794 - 01:06:53.834, Speaker B: Like the US has done this. Actually, a number of times they've seized official reserves in dollars of these smaller, more pariah nations. Russia was a huge incremental change there. So I think China is wary of having too much exposure to treasuries. They also may think it's a bad store value asset. Fundamentally, the math for the math to work, inflation has to return and yields have to be negative in real terms. And that, of course, means that treasury holders will lose.
01:06:53.834 - 01:07:16.868, Speaker B: So over the coming decades, even though things are nice and positive in real terms right now, over the coming decades, that's going to have to happen. Unless there's a demographic change or a productivity unlock and we can kind of grow our way out of trouble. I mean, if GDP growth picks up, then we can bail ourselves out, basically. So that's kind of the big asterisk.
01:07:16.916 - 01:07:26.824, Speaker A: On the only way to get out of this chart, Nick, is either inflation to basically eat away at the debt or some colossal productivity unlock, which, you know, maybe could be AI or something.
01:07:26.864 - 01:07:28.000, Speaker B: Like that, or we could default.
01:07:28.032 - 01:07:28.224, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:28.264 - 01:07:46.328, Speaker B: That's also. Well, there's two options. Three options, really. Inflation, which I think is most likely, one, default, which the US is. I don't think we intend to do that. Or, yeah, demographics could change, but that doesn't look likely. We could also raise taxes massively.
01:07:46.328 - 01:08:19.188, Speaker B: I don't think we're going to do that. So good luck trying to get elected. Yeah, exactly. So in democracies, there's like one way these things go, which is you do the kind of COVID deleveraging through inflation and capping yields. And with the long yields rising just in the last week or so, like we're starting to see central bankers get a little nervous. They're just like, oh, we don't know why the 30 year is rising. So much so that I think you would expect to see more conversations about doing yield curve control in the coming weeks, actually.
01:08:19.188 - 01:08:51.342, Speaker B: So look out for that. But yeah, the one way out here that's the good case would be productivity unlock. And actually I do think AI can be that. I think AI can add two to three points of GDP growth for a decade or so. I think of it as consequential as the amount of nuclear power. So I do think it is a massive productivity unlock, which could potentially help us out of our very unfortunate fiscal position without requiring a ton of inflation. I think it'll also be very disruptive at the same time.
01:08:51.342 - 01:09:02.474, Speaker B: So maybe it won't be good for society, it'll increase inequality. But, yeah, I'm actually kind of weirdly optimistic about this. Even though on their face the numbers look really bad.
01:09:04.214 - 01:09:13.134, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, I tend to agree with you. The only real nice scenario here is productivity growth and AI adoption.
01:09:13.174 - 01:09:19.034, Speaker B: Nuclear, I mean, yeah, we might have. Nuclear fusion might become a thing. Like, there might be some kind of space.
01:09:19.654 - 01:09:43.806, Speaker D: The issue though, I just saw a chart over the weekend of like, how many new reactors are being built. Not all. These are like the huge reactors, like small module reactors. Like China is building like 20 or 30. Russia, Turkey, basically all developing countries are building a ton of these. And then, like, France is building one, but they already get like 75% of the energy from nuclear. No other kind of country in the European Union is building any or is serious about it.
01:09:43.806 - 01:09:55.742, Speaker D: The UK is building one, but I think it's like a massive operation is going to go way above budget and then the US is building one or two which is, like, laughable. So, yeah, I mean, I think, yeah.
01:09:55.758 - 01:10:27.274, Speaker B: I mean, ultimately, growth is our ability to marshal our resources and energy is the discount rate. So if energy is expensive, you're not going to have good growth, which is what the EU is dealing with. I mean, they made their own bed because they, in my opinion, have this kind of suicidal energy policy. The US is in a much better position. Like, we are the ones shipping lng to Europe and ripping their faces off with the spread there. We are an energy rich nation. It's just a matter of finding the political will to exploit it if we.
01:10:27.274 - 01:10:49.114, Speaker B: And like, you know, if you look at european growth over the last decade, like, a lot of that was because they had cheap russian gas. You look at our growth, our disinflation over the last decades because we had the shale revolution. So a lot of this is downstream of energy. Yeah. So the question is, like, will we find the will to unlock that and, you know, use more nuclear, whatever it is.
01:10:49.694 - 01:10:55.158, Speaker D: Nice. I love episodes when we go back to nuclear because this is something that we've had, like Josh Wolf and we've.
01:10:55.166 - 01:10:56.694, Speaker A: Done some, like, only nuclear.
01:10:56.774 - 01:11:10.406, Speaker D: When you think about the two most non consensus things in the world right now, it is probably crypto and nuclear. Like, talk about, like, two things that we know can offer a lot of benefits, but the world just has a very negative view towards them.
01:11:10.590 - 01:11:18.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, basically I think what we need is, like, for Germany to acknowledge, hey, we screwed up by turning off all the nuclear reactors, just woke.
01:11:18.942 - 01:11:29.064, Speaker D: Policies where like, they were shutting down their only remaining nuclear reactor months after the war started. And you're like, well, yeah, I think they.
01:11:29.224 - 01:11:46.976, Speaker B: After Fukushima, I think Merkel shut down seven reactors. Yeah, I was baffled by that because you don't have tsunamis in Germany. You don't have earthquakes either, for that matter. Also, the german reactors would have been able to withstand Fukushima because they were newer reactors.
01:11:47.160 - 01:11:50.248, Speaker C: Yeah. What's going on nearby? So you're still taking the risk.
01:11:50.296 - 01:12:00.996, Speaker D: Anyways, France in the meanwhile is, you know, they have a ton of strikes, but they're not related because of the energy prices keep going up. They've. Yeah, just shocking.
01:12:01.100 - 01:12:32.216, Speaker A: Um, guys, I have one more question for you here. Like, kind of playing this out. So you, uh, Martin, you guys got registered in Bermuda, I think you said what happens when Singapore. So Singapore just had some, like, very positive stable coin regulation, I think it was. So Bermuda, there's UAE is becoming like pretty pro stablecoin as well. Hong Kong becoming pro stablecoin. What happens when like the major usdenominated stable coins are all getting issued out of like the UAE and Hong Kong.
01:12:32.216 - 01:12:39.528, Speaker A: What? Like what does that do for, is that a good thing, a bad thing? It does like, you know, nothing to really look into there. What do you think?
01:12:39.536 - 01:12:40.608, Speaker C: You mean for the US?
01:12:40.776 - 01:12:41.884, Speaker A: Yeah, for the US.
01:12:42.224 - 01:13:22.748, Speaker C: I think it's a very good thing that despite you trying to kill it, you're generating forced buyers of treasuries because in the end we don't participate in the auction. We buy at whatever price, right? So you're a price taker. So you're generating in the, so in the demand curve, you're generating a bunch of demand that is like you would take it at whatever price. And this is some people that argue against this. It's like, okay, you're changing a dollar for a stable coin. It's still a dollar, right? I think the argument is stable coins penetrating are changing other currencies to the dollar. You can see whole economy start to move into dollar.
01:13:22.748 - 01:13:49.466, Speaker C: So it's like net new dollar demand that is purchasing treasuries. So I think that's the disruptive thing that I think is very hard to feel in the US because stable coins are not. Most people here don't understand why you need them offshore. It's like, of course I would swap and store my value and transact here. And I think that net new purchaser of us dollars and Treasuries is the biggest benefit in the country.
01:13:49.610 - 01:14:27.334, Speaker B: I put a sheer reason, I just think it's good for the average American in that it makes our debt more manageable. In theory, if crypto becomes unstable, coins become a huge asset class at say trillion dollars. It's not good for the quote unquote deeds deep state like it's not necessarily good for Washington's ability to project power indiscriminately through dollar rails because there's more transactions, dollar transactions happening elsewhere. The issuers are going to be domiciled elsewhere. They're going to be less accountable to the US government. So good for ordinary Americans, not necessarily good for like the political ambitions of Washington.
01:14:27.454 - 01:15:03.554, Speaker C: And let me caveat there, Nick, which is I think the thing that is going to be prevented with stable coins is the coverted government enforcement because all of the stable coin issuers are going to support whatever a court requires. I don't see a stable coin issue that's going to be, oh, we're going to, we're not going to support a us judge saying that we need to block this asset. What you are or the FBI or an actual enforcement. What you don't have is kind of like the behind the scenes power that gets inflicted via intermediaries just because stable coins are so transparent. So I think that behind the scenes power is what Nick is referring to.
01:15:03.674 - 01:15:25.978, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, like, if you're, if you're talking to a regular, you're like, well, why wouldn't you? Like, it's just overwhelming. Either net, like neutral or overwhelmingly positive. Like growing demand for us dollars and greater transparency. Like, think about the shadow economy. Like how many transactions being done in cash. Well, if you're the IR's or the tax Authority of India or whatever country, you have no visibility into that. Now all of a sudden you you do.
01:15:25.978 - 01:16:18.734, Speaker D: If all of these transactions are are happening in a public blockchain, and that's hugely beneficial. I mean, at the end of the day, Martin, I sort of agree with your view, which is, you know, you either like, accept that and then, and then you're you're very much pro that irrespective of who you are. Like, I just, maybe the more important question is, like, how far off or how far away do you think we are to get to that state where we just like ten x the stablecoin volume and adoption? And I guess as we think about wrapping up the episode, what are the major catalysts you see in the horizon? Both, Nick, from an investing standpoint, things that you may be thinking about wallets or things like mountain protocol. And Martin, from a developer entrepreneurial standpoint, what are some of the catalysts that you see?
01:16:19.514 - 01:16:37.634, Speaker B: I'll start. I would say the crypto rate has to go back above the fiat rate for the stablecoin supply to start growing again. The adoption of stables. And it's mainly happening through these intermediaries like fintech apps. Defi mullet. Right. That is 100% happening.
01:16:37.634 - 01:17:03.530, Speaker B: In fact, we've been inundated with these kinds of pitches over the last couple months, mainly EM focused. But virtually every country you can think of, it's like, will be the stablecoin wallet for x. We're seeing that. So that's just happening anyway. I don't think that's going to go away. It's not like the fiat currencies of the world are going to start becoming credible again. So I think you're going to see episodes of this sort of crypto dollarization occur.
01:17:03.530 - 01:17:29.994, Speaker B: And I've been predicting this for years, and it hasn't happened outside of maybe Venezuela. So I'll just keep predicting and eventually I'll be right and then at that point I'll celebrate that. But yeah, I mean, I don't see any specific catalysts. I mean, dollarization, Argentina could be one, for instance, but that is sort of happening on ongoing basis. But yeah, for me, the number one thing is actually crypto yields coming back above tried fi yields. So I think that'll probably happen in the next twelve months.
01:17:31.614 - 01:18:11.102, Speaker C: I have a more positive view than Nick. I think you're going to see growth in dollar, in stable coins, because now you have a better dollar that you can sell with a stable coin than not having a stable coin. Right. So if you think about the euro dollar banking system in most countries, you're going to get a dollar interest bearing account if you're a very large corporate, but your average kind of SME and consumer doesn't have access to that product. So these kind of defi mullets capturing that demand, I think you're going to see a lot of that. So high yield checking accounts for individuals, for SME's. The SME side, I'm very excited because it was a.
01:18:11.102 - 01:18:57.706, Speaker C: A segment that didn't have a business model before, and now you have one because the business model has always been swaps. SME's don't swap. But now that if you can get an interest margin, you can, you can serve them. So I think that that's one in terms of the rate of crypto going above traffic. I think the way that happens is if you start bringing in the risk free rate into all of your blue chip protocols, so you start to stack the risk free rate plus whatever fees are generated, let's say, on an Amm. So I think we're going to see USDM stake teeth pools instead of USDC ETH. So instead of paying USDC and getting deflated out in ETH, you're going to get your staked ETH rewards and then you're going to get your risk free rate on dollars.
01:18:57.706 - 01:19:30.114, Speaker C: So that is a pool that will pay more than the risk free rate. You're going to get a USDM staked brazilian real pool. So now you have a forex like clearinghouse that can pay more, that is more efficient than what you have. So I think those are going to be the places where you deposit money and you're going to be able to, with a very limited additional risk, which is the smart contract risk that you're taking. But that most have been very vital tested. You're able to generate above kind of risk free rate returns. And I think that's what's going to bring institutions back in.
01:19:30.454 - 01:19:58.246, Speaker D: I mean, of course, the first condition you mentioned requires that there is no choke point operation in these places, which you would think that there is some opportunity that these countries, as we've seen, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, really appreciate that. Hey, this is an opportunity for us to step up and become more relevant in the financial hub and develop that. But importantly, if governments really want to make this impossible, they can.
01:19:58.430 - 01:20:12.942, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we're seeing the opposite of choke point we're seeing outside the US. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like a direct reaction. I mean, Hong Kong said they have a stable coin regulation coming next year. Singapore, pass one. You'll see it in the UAE as well.
01:20:12.942 - 01:20:21.554, Speaker B: Bermuda. I'll be in Bermuda next week. They love stable coins. They love crypto. So we're seeing the reaction abroad to basically the failure in the US.
01:20:21.944 - 01:20:46.040, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. It's so fascinating. Like just as you described in open nick, like the euro dollar market coming to being in the sixties, seventies, we're seeing the same but stable coin. The parallels are very much there. This has been a fascinating episode. We haven't even talked. I think there's so many other topics that we can delve into, like insurance and all the different kind of securitization of staking yields and all this stuff that could be embedded into these products.
01:20:46.040 - 01:21:01.714, Speaker D: It just feels like it's very nascent category, but it is kind of the trojan horse of crypto. And, you know, really appreciate you guys perspective and coming on and talking about that. Anything else you guys want to end with or, you know, perhaps like, you know, parting thoughts and places where people can follow your work?
01:21:02.654 - 01:21:13.974, Speaker B: Look, watch my talks. My token 2049 one I think is key one. So it's, you know, a lot of the fintechs I'm talking about, like, I put all their names on a slide. So if you want to dig in further. Yeah, it's.
01:21:14.054 - 01:21:16.406, Speaker A: We can link that. We can. We'll link that in the show notes.
01:21:16.590 - 01:21:26.006, Speaker C: And then for us it's ontusdm. That's our Twitter handle. And then my person is. So you can follow my thoughts there, too.
01:21:26.150 - 01:21:31.430, Speaker A: Cool. Nick Martin, thanks for coming on the podcast. Martin. Thank you guys, to have you. Nick, good to have you back as always.
01:21:31.582 - 01:21:32.542, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
01:21:32.718 - 01:21:33.654, Speaker C: Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate.
