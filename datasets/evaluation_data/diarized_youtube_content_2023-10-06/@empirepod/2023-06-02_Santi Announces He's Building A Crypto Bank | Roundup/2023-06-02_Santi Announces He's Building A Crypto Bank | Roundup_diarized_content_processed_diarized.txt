Empire all right, everyone, after a two week, three week hiatus, I'm back. I'm pumped to be back. I missed you guys and Santa. I missed you, man.
00:00:27.790 - 00:00:28.710, Speaker A: How you been?
00:00:28.902 - 00:00:33.606, Speaker B: I'm doing great. You know, it sounds like it was great. A honeymoon. So welcome back, sir. A lot of love.
00:00:33.710 - 00:00:42.494, Speaker A: It was lovely. It was a good time. Not too shabby. You, you grew a beard while I was gone looking. I mean, you've always had a beard, but, like, this is a bear market. It's getting a little longer, huh? Yeah.
00:00:42.534 - 00:01:08.146, Speaker B: You know, I just sort of feeling it. I've thought about this. I've thought about shaving it all together, but I've had it since my second year at JP Morgan as an analyst. And I was riding the elevator with Jamie diamond because it was like he was in the floor above us, and he would look at me and be like, why are you like, you're supposed to shave every day? And I just did it because I wasn't into that following. Like, I was wearing a suit and tie, something. I'm gonna be rebellious. Look, I had an offer back then to go to a private equity fund.
00:01:08.146 - 00:01:23.390, Speaker B: So I felt like, you know, it's like, I know, it's like when you're a senior in high school, you already know which call you're gonna go to see, you know? So ever since then, it's just sort of been my way of, I don't know, I feel I like it, but I'm either going to grow it a lot and then just shave it all and just go.
00:01:23.542 - 00:01:48.570, Speaker A: Which reminds me, you know, it's funny, I have some, I think people in those very cookie cutter jobs like to rebel in these small, funny ways. Like, they'll be like, um, I have a bunch of friends who work in banking, or now, I guess now pe a couple hedge funds and stuff. And they're like, yeah, yesterday, should have seen the socks I wore. I had a little bit of chocolate cake at lunch. I'm like, oh, you, you rebel. You, you really.
00:01:48.762 - 00:01:59.254, Speaker B: Crypto libertarian values expressed via beer, you know, makes me sleep better at night, folks. Jason reminds me, I don't think you ever shaved your head, though.
00:02:00.194 - 00:02:03.454, Speaker A: The bull market comes back. No. What was the deal? There was no deal.
00:02:03.834 - 00:02:08.454, Speaker B: You said that you were gonna be in solidarity with Coinbase Brian Armstrong.
00:02:09.794 - 00:02:11.170, Speaker A: This is what Mike said.
00:02:11.282 - 00:02:20.294, Speaker B: Mike. We gotta get Mike on the pot because I. I believe that you said you're going to go bald. So I'm still waiting for that. If you go bald, I'll shape my beard. Let's put it that way.
00:02:20.674 - 00:02:23.194, Speaker A: This is a much worse deal for me as a horrible.
00:02:23.234 - 00:02:27.614, Speaker B: I don't. I don't. Welcome to negotiation one on one, sir.
00:02:28.754 - 00:02:35.714, Speaker A: Nailed it there. Nailed it. Yeah. We'll consider maybe if Brian here, I'll. Maybe if Brian comes on the pod, I'll. I'll shave my head. There's.
00:02:35.714 - 00:02:37.530, Speaker A: There's my deal. If Brian's listening to this.
00:02:37.642 - 00:02:39.940, Speaker B: There you go. Lot to talk about this week.
00:02:40.042 - 00:02:50.080, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, I think it was Ryan. Sean Adams tweeted, I think it was Ryan. He tweeted out, uh, for. For crypto ogs. Which market is, uh. Which.
00:02:50.080 - 00:03:26.036, Speaker A: Which bear market is worse, this bear market or the last bear market? And I thought it was a. Maybe we could talk about that, because I'm definitely. I think for. I think I remain, like, incredibly excited by things that are going on right now. But now that I've been back for a couple of days, like, I've definitely noticed a lot of apathy and a lot of, like, I had a friend who's been in crypto for, like, four years, and he's like, I'm kind of questioning why I'm doing this. And I think, like, we just reached that stage of the bear market, and I'd like to hear what you think about Ryan's question. So maybe I'll just ask it directly here.
00:03:26.036 - 00:03:31.588, Speaker A: Like, you've seen a bunch of bear markets. Is this bear market worse than the last bear market?
00:03:31.756 - 00:03:33.304, Speaker B: His question was, is it darker?
00:03:33.404 - 00:03:34.456, Speaker A: Is it darker? Yeah.
00:03:34.520 - 00:03:56.632, Speaker B: And I think it's an interesting nuance. I think it is darker. It makes it seem darker because the magnitude of the scans are larger. FTX huge, terra huge. Like, the sheer number of people. And the magnet, like, the loss is greater, and so it feels darker, but in no way shape or forms it worse. Like, not even.
00:03:56.632 - 00:04:12.966, Speaker B: Like it's in. It's not even comparable. In the pain that you felt and the uncertainty that you felt. Like in 2011 or twelve, there was existential risk. You didn't know if this was going to work. And it was, like, largely bitcoin back then. Felt fragile.
00:04:12.966 - 00:04:32.188, Speaker B: Feel like, really like you're putting your savings there. It's like I'm not even. I put my bonus there from JPMorgan. I said, I'm going to lose this, but I'm comfortable with that. There's a great novel quote that says, investing in seed adventure. You're, you should be prepared to lose it all. And I sort of ascribed to that back then.
00:04:32.188 - 00:04:54.584, Speaker B: So there was a lot of existential risk back then. There's huge wild swings, bitcoin going for like, it went to that mount Gox. Like Mount Gox, my God, that was huge. There was no infrastructure. So, no, I don't think it was worse. And then, and then the ICO boom, like, yeah, there was a lot of pain. A lot of projects like did some dumb stuff like holding ETH and their treasury depleted.
00:04:54.584 - 00:05:36.914, Speaker B: Um, and then you're sort of left wondering, okay, this is a money raising machine. Are we ever going to do anything with that? But today, like, first of all, I don't think we're in a bear market. Like, we've rallied 80% from the bottom and yet people are having mental breakdowns on Twitter. I mean, this is just a state of the, like, people are just conditioned in a way where not only in crypto but just in traditional markets, the holding period is dramatically reduced. Young investors have zero patience. And you could look at that both ways. You could say it makes it really tough for projects that have a token for NFT communities because if you're not delivering, meaning if price is not going up, people just can leave.
00:05:36.914 - 00:06:15.012, Speaker B: And the second, I guess the alternative view to that is that presents incredible opportunities for people that are patient because I don't think it's nearly as bad. I think there's a lot of excitement to your point. Like you're building a media company. There's a huge opportunity in building the Bloomberg of crypto and you guys are doing that. There's huge opportunity in, actually, I think crypto really rewards people and is rewarding them. Now, if you continue to keep your head down and build and you're patient, you don't do dumb stuff like position your portfolio or whatever to be patient. We're not in a, we're not, we haven't seen pain.
00:06:15.012 - 00:06:38.814, Speaker B: Like when we hit a $1,000, you remember we have these discussions like three months ago. I said, I think, I think the bottom here is like, you know, ETH at a thousand or slightly below that. We started to see some real pain, like anything but ETH below 800. There was like huge amount of like MKR loans that would have to be refinanced or liquidated, but we're nowhere near there.
00:06:39.394 - 00:07:13.002, Speaker A: And do you, okay, I tend to agree with that. By the way. I want to get, I want to talk about, like, this kind of little mini bear market rally that we've had. But I actually tend to really agree with you. I think the, it really comes down to in the last bear market, there was an existential crisis of, is this going to work or not? And now it's just like, like, how long is this going to last? And, you know, I remember this conversation. I've shared this before, but I'll share it again. Like, I remember Mike and I having beers in 2019 late at the office one day.
00:07:13.002 - 00:07:15.882, Speaker A: I think we're trying to sell tickets to some conference.
00:07:15.978 - 00:07:16.954, Speaker B: We started in conferencing.
00:07:16.994 - 00:08:04.104, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It was like we were behind on ticket sales for an event, and we were, like, just ripping out LinkedIn messages, trying to get people to come this event, and we're like, damn, if this thing doesn't work, what are we going to do? And I think one of us was like, I think Mike might have said, oh, it'd be fun to work at Netflix or something like that. And I think that actually just really some. And, like, today, I don't think Mike or I could ever imagine not working in crypto. And I think that really kind of sums up, like, the difference back then was nobody knew if this stuff was going to work. And I think a lot of folks were like, are we ever coming out? Like, are we ever coming out of this? Is there going to be a light at the end of the tunnel? And now it's like, I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I just have no idea what it's going to be.
00:08:04.104 - 00:08:12.834, Speaker A: I have my own predictions on when, on when this thing will turn around, but there's no question in my mind that this will turn around. And that's the biggest difference. Cycle.
00:08:12.874 - 00:08:44.324, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I definitely agree with that. It is difficult because when you're investing, founders, and as a community, I think we tend to over promise and in some ways under deliver, depending on the snapshot of time where you're looking at, have we made the progress that we promised? And there's always that gap. Right. A large, in large part, last cycle was this infrastructure gap because we promised, you know, we would decentralize everything under the sun, but there was no infrastructure to support scalability. Right. Cryptokitties congested the network, and that really marked, like, the top of the cycle. And here we are now.
00:08:44.324 - 00:09:17.556, Speaker B: Because you could have, you could have had this exact same discussion back then and said, we're done. Like, you know, even something is like, we're literally putting pictures of cats on the blockchain, which happened in the Internet too, by the way, in the nineties. Like, people were like doing that in the early days and fast forward now and like, NFTs are all the rage and they're real and brands are excited and they're the cookies of web3. And they're going to be explosive. We know that. I mean, there already are being explosive like this idea of digital property. And so two different cycles now, NFTs really are carrying the day in many ways, huge onboarding mechanism and funnel.
00:09:17.556 - 00:09:55.532, Speaker B: People are excited about that. And it's just a, I use it as an example to conceptualize these moments where, you know, we tend to over promise under deliver, but you just have to be patient. Like gaming is going to be, is coming. I mean, you, you, at least now you've come such a long way in the infrastructure side of things that you, the question now is more, does this really matter? Is there a real use case here? People are still going to play traditional games. Why would they come to web3 games? And some people, some skeptics rightfully so, are saying none of this really matters. And I think credibly, you can point to many examples. Mike had a great tweet.
00:09:55.532 - 00:10:51.466, Speaker B: I tweet about this last week is people are opinionated now about the things that they either like or don't like on chain and are commenting on real substance inactivity. That wasn't the case in prior cycles. And so the question really is, how big is this going to get? And I think a lot of us here, I was having this great discussion this week with the founder of Blur. We met in person and I was telling him, hey, how do you see the NFT market? How big does Blur get? And he's like, he said, I'm not as excited about real world assets, but I do think that NFTs are going to be explosive. It were just tip of the iceberg and a lot of it is collectibles. And I sort of like really like, is thinking this word of like, you know, we tend to like visualize how crypto is going to fit in our current life. But I think a lot of the use cases, we, it's hard to imagine, but it was hard to like, this is the case with every sort of technology.
00:10:51.466 - 00:11:22.420, Speaker B: And so, yeah, we just have to be patient. But, you know, let me ask you a question. Like a lot of the team, I have noticed a lot of teams now like a noticeably uptick in teams shutting down. And even, it's not just like investors in the community that are losing interest. But it's really like that whole subset of, like, a third of founders that are not really in it for long term are leaving. And so that's the hardest thing to see, to be honest. But otherwise, yeah, I think.
00:11:22.582 - 00:11:45.444, Speaker A: I think, well, they're just a lot more. I think what happened? So I'm seeing the same thing. Like, there are just so many companies shutting down right now. Like, really quietly shutting down. So we have. Let me look in our candidate, we use this tool called Ashby for, like, I don't know, tracking candidates. I think we've had, like, 5000 applicants to blockworks in the past, in the past 30 days.
00:11:45.444 - 00:12:17.214, Speaker A: And, you know, the fundraise definitely helped drive some attention there. But I think, yeah, I think we've had somewhere between, like, let's call it five to 6000 applicants roughly. And there's a lot of data there, right. So you can start to actually see who's applying. And for the first time in the market, you're seeing a lot of founders of, like, sub ten person companies applying and, like, publicly, like, their companies are still working. But what that tells me is, like, they raised 18 months ago, they can't raise now. They're maybe looking to apply for our vp of research role or our director of product role.
00:12:17.214 - 00:12:54.982, Speaker A: So there and then also you can start to get some interesting insights into what companies maybe aren't going where it's not going so great. In the series C, series D, companies with 50 applicants from this one specific company, I'm like, ah, seems like things are not going so well over there right now. But then, just to close out this conversation on the bear market, from a emotional side, I think we just talked about that. But if you just look at the numbers, each bear market is less bad than the last one in terms of, like, the drawdown. Right. 2011, we pulled back 94%. 2015, we pulled back 87%.
00:12:55.118 - 00:12:57.814, Speaker B: 2019, which is, by the way, is a huge difference.
00:12:57.974 - 00:12:59.222, Speaker A: It's a huge. Yeah, yeah.
00:12:59.318 - 00:13:00.382, Speaker B: Like, huge difference.
00:13:00.478 - 00:13:01.154, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:01.734 - 00:13:03.654, Speaker B: Because the relationship is not linear. Right?
00:13:03.774 - 00:13:23.184, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly. So it always changes by, like. So it was 94%, then 87%. 2019 was 84% or 85% drawdown. And then this bull market or this bear market, I think we've drawn down. I don't think we've drawn down 80%. I think down like 78 or 79%.
00:13:23.304 - 00:13:27.084, Speaker B: Yeah. For ETH. Yeah, it's roughly there, I think.
00:13:27.984 - 00:13:30.544, Speaker A: So anyways, you're drawing down, like, a lot.
00:13:30.584 - 00:13:36.726, Speaker B: It's a massive drawdown, 61%. And bitcoin is less I believe I'm just checking now.
00:13:36.880 - 00:13:38.818, Speaker A: So. But if you look at like total.
00:13:38.866 - 00:13:41.650, Speaker B: Market cap of the 61, both bitcoin and ethereum are down.
00:13:41.682 - 00:14:03.970, Speaker A: So it's a dampened draw. Drawdown. Anyways, I tend to agree with you on that. Let's, you had, there's another tweet I wanted to talk about, which is you tweeted out that you're thinking about building something, and you. There were a couple of options. You said, I have a growing desire to build something in crypto beyond investing my own capital and education through the Empire podcast. I have a few ideas.
00:14:03.970 - 00:14:31.690, Speaker A: I thought it'd be fun to open source it. You said media company fund with outside lp's and crypto friendly bank. And crypto friendly. It was interesting to see the results. 2000 people voted, 7% voted for media companies, 7% said that you should launch a fund, and 77% said you should build a crypto friendly bank. So before we talk about the crypto friendly bank, I actually would love to just get your, like, what's going on in your mind right now? Like, you want to get back to building something. Like, tell me about how you're feeling about things right now.
00:14:31.802 - 00:14:56.258, Speaker B: Well, I want to preface all this by saying I don't think I'm a good builder. I think I'm a better investor. But investing could. But I have a few ideas, largely inspired by a lot of the false starts that we've had in the last cycle. And a lot of ashes, there's fallen giants. And so in large part is probably this is like the worst time. Like, you can ask someone and say, I want to build a bank.
00:14:56.258 - 00:15:26.198, Speaker B: Given everything that's going on, people think you're crazy. Small bank is like collapsing. Right. It's really hard to specifically want to do crypto stuff, like your signatures down, silvergates down, you know, and then, and then, you know, traditional, like huge banks. Right. But I actually think, like, I look at that and I get inspired because I think that this is perhaps the best moment in time to do that. But even before that, like, I left paraphy because I wanted to just spend more time in working founders and managing funders.
00:15:26.198 - 00:16:10.398, Speaker B: You, it's, know, great. Like, the relationship that I have been is, you know, I think it was a great run, but I just wanted to spend most or all of my time investing and not so much, like, doing everything else that involves, like, being at a fund with outside investors. And now this podcast is my, one of the, my main focus because I think the, the goal is to, you know, have open discussions and, you know, educate people without bias or, you know, as much less bias as possible. I think we've done good work here, but there's more to do, right. There's a lot of stuff that we can do. And so I've, over the years, worked with a few people that I really like, and I would love to assemble a great team to. I think I'm.
00:16:10.398 - 00:16:45.224, Speaker B: Even before the survey, I was, like, leaning towards the bank and it was nice to see that. And so, yeah, I think that's. Where am I going to be involved in day to day? No, I have no business in running a bank. There are smarter, more competent people to do that. But if I can assemble the team and help start it and guide it with everything that I've lived through over the years in crypto and observed, I come from Churchill finance background, then I think it would help the space. Like, I was just. I've been more and more thinking of someone's going to pick up the ashes and rebuild something that actually works.
00:16:45.224 - 00:16:57.424, Speaker B: Like, if you think that blockfi was a terrible business, you're absolutely wrong. It's a great business. Terribly managed. So swap up the team. So it's. It's almost like that idea.
00:16:57.764 - 00:17:10.636, Speaker A: So tell me about this on day. Are you thinking a b, two c bank, like a blockbuster is a b two c bank? A b two b bank would be like a cr. What are they called? Brigade.
00:17:10.780 - 00:17:42.839, Speaker B: Everything back. Everything. Like servicing individuals that want to onboard and off. Off board, you know, crypto, but also institutions, I think. What is it? You know, I'm mindful of timing and I think this is a huge, like, herculean effort. It might not work, but I think going through the process will be worthwhile to understand, really, like, also get it close to regulators, especially in Europe. I think it happens in Europe.
00:17:42.839 - 00:18:19.214, Speaker B: I'm based in Europe and I've gotten. No, you know, how banks operate here, whether it's in the UK, France, or Switzerland. I think it's Switzerland, but Switzerland historically has been crypto friendly. But Mika, I think opens up a good possibility to maybe do it outside of Switzerland and the European Union or in the UK, which is also kind of move forward. And, yeah, you know, I think there are a few companies out there that already do it. You know, revolut's also trying to, you know, spin up their own kind of bank and service crypto. So there's ongoing efforts, but, yeah, I don't know.
00:18:19.294 - 00:18:22.206, Speaker A: Hmm. How serious are you about this?
00:18:22.350 - 00:18:26.438, Speaker B: Pretty serious. I like, I've been in ongoing discussions for the last, like, three months.
00:18:26.526 - 00:18:26.838, Speaker A: Nice.
00:18:26.886 - 00:18:41.518, Speaker B: I think this is. I initially had, as you recall, an insurance. An idea to do an insurance company right early, though yields are terrible, and for that reason, it just doesn't work. But I think if you have a good banking platform, it then allows you to do so many other things.
00:18:41.686 - 00:18:54.150, Speaker A: So you would go. So let's walk through the strategy a little bit. So you would not run this. You might be, like, the chairman, one of the founders. You would hire a CEO who really understood banking. Would you hire them from crypto or from traditional capital markets?
00:18:54.182 - 00:19:14.650, Speaker B: Both. You know, I think the team looks like the top hires are a great banking executive. That is. That actually doesn't have a maturity mismatch. You know, I think the folks at Blockfi, no disrespect, but had no business and didn't understand risk. You need to be really good. And the mismatch, like, is what gets every single bank.
00:19:14.650 - 00:19:33.436, Speaker B: The Silicon Valley guys at some point lost it because they had this asset liability mismatch. So hire someone from JP Morgan, I think, like, someone like. What's her name? Not Mary Meeker, but, yeah. What's her good luck life masters, for instance. He was.
00:19:33.500 - 00:19:34.852, Speaker A: She was running digital asset.
00:19:34.908 - 00:19:42.344, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And she was like. She was huge inspiration. There's a great book called Fool's. Fool's gold, and she was like, she's.
00:19:43.884 - 00:19:45.548, Speaker A: Credit default, but she's smart.
00:19:45.596 - 00:19:52.580, Speaker B: Like, she knows how banks work. So something like that. Like an executive from. From JP Morgan or a big bank.
00:19:52.692 - 00:19:57.036, Speaker A: Well, Jamie diamond doesn't run for president of the United States. Maybe go talk to him.
00:19:57.220 - 00:20:10.140, Speaker B: Someone like that. Plus also someone in the regulatory policy side that really understands crypto, you know, someone like Rebecca, for instance. And then, like. And then on the operation side, just guys who get banking.
00:20:10.292 - 00:20:15.452, Speaker A: Are you subtly, like, recruiting Rebecca through publicly mentioning her name to try to get her to.
00:20:15.628 - 00:20:25.432, Speaker B: We've been super close. Like, we were close, you know, since the Aave days and even before then, but. No, no, no, I am. I'm excited about it.
00:20:25.508 - 00:20:25.864, Speaker A: Nice.
00:20:25.944 - 00:20:26.792, Speaker B: As I said.
00:20:26.968 - 00:20:32.832, Speaker A: What do you think? You will, uh, we'll. We'll raise, because this is obviously a bit. You need a lot of capital to go do this.
00:20:32.968 - 00:20:35.952, Speaker B: No, I mean, not like a ton.
00:20:36.048 - 00:20:44.044, Speaker A: Okay. You need. You need some capital. So you have $10,000,000.10. Okay, so you need 10 million. Would you put this up yourself, or would you raise it externally?
00:20:44.664 - 00:20:45.928, Speaker B: Uh, the partner.
00:20:46.096 - 00:20:46.488, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:46.536 - 00:20:47.720, Speaker B: And then maybe raise a bit.
00:20:47.832 - 00:20:48.576, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:48.760 - 00:20:54.854, Speaker B: But, uh, I think the key here is getting a license and part of getting the license is having a good team.
00:20:55.394 - 00:21:08.414, Speaker A: Well, part of, or you could take the other strategy. You could actually do the FTX strategy, which is. Maybe I shouldn't say the FTI strategy. But you can buy the licenses. Yeah. There's really cheap, there's some really publicly traded.
00:21:09.634 - 00:21:18.524, Speaker B: Yeah. A lot of these, like some of these licenses you can buy in distress, like they're in receivership. Issue is you don't want to get that bad replica. I want a clean slate.
00:21:18.944 - 00:21:19.416, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:19.480 - 00:21:48.730, Speaker B: And make a splash because I've hired the top executives and a serious team. Crypto deserves a good bank and a serious team. Like I want JP Morgan quality. I come from JpMorgan. I'm biased there, but, you know, high quality, talented individuals and maybe they have interest in crypto personally. And so they, they see this as it is worthwhile to have and dominate the market. And we could start in Europe or the UK and then go from there.
00:21:48.730 - 00:21:52.922, Speaker B: Like, I'm optimistic because the banking license, timing wise sequence, it sort of takes.
00:21:53.018 - 00:21:57.654, Speaker A: Why would you start in Europe when most of the crypto companies today are in, are in the US?
00:21:58.874 - 00:22:03.906, Speaker B: I just think, I think the regulatory environment is friendlier here.
00:22:03.970 - 00:22:04.954, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:05.114 - 00:22:23.234, Speaker B: And I'm based here like Switzerland is. It's just, I think a place where my head goes, but I'm open. Like I'm exploring all avenues, probably like Dubai, for instance. But like, I just feel that a top quality bank needs to either be based in Europe or the US.
00:22:24.374 - 00:22:30.394, Speaker A: Agree wholeheartedly. All right, sir, we'll have to. You have to keep.
00:22:30.694 - 00:22:40.716, Speaker B: I'll close this out. If anyone is interested, please reach out. I'd love to. I'm in the sort of that phase where I'm talking to everyone and anyone about it. There are ongoing efforts and whatnot, so.
00:22:40.740 - 00:22:48.204, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. Good stuff, sir. That's exciting. What, what next?
00:22:48.364 - 00:22:51.700, Speaker B: I'm getting the market, by the way.
00:22:51.812 - 00:22:58.564, Speaker A: I like it. I like it, I think. So you. Is there anyone else? Are you going to do this with the co founder? Are you going to?
00:22:58.684 - 00:23:05.756, Speaker B: Probably, yeah, definitely. Definitely. I'm not good at a million things that are required to execute here. To the best.
00:23:05.820 - 00:23:07.308, Speaker A: Why do you think you're not a good builder?
00:23:07.436 - 00:23:08.664, Speaker B: Oh, I've tried it before.
00:23:09.084 - 00:23:10.356, Speaker A: You don't like it or you don't think.
00:23:10.380 - 00:23:23.148, Speaker B: You're like, I don't have the patience for it. I have too many ideas and I love investing because I want to do many things and I would rather empower someone with capital and some guidance then, like getting my hands, like, really.
00:23:23.276 - 00:23:35.944, Speaker A: So funny that you say that I feel like I'm not a great investor because I don't have the patience for it. I'm like, because with building, you can go do so many things. Like, you can have a thought one day, and then you can go. You can go see it out in the world the next day.
00:23:36.584 - 00:23:43.484, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, I. It has helped me, like, I try to build this company with a few folks. A validator running validators.
00:23:43.784 - 00:23:46.664, Speaker A: Oh, pre Lido days. Right. We should actually.
00:23:46.744 - 00:23:55.280, Speaker B: Yeah. By the way. Yeah. Because someone tweeted, like, mike was like, this is great investment. Like. But, no, I just sort of realized, like, I don't. I love investing.
00:23:55.280 - 00:24:20.932, Speaker B: I just. I just love. I like thinking about where things are gonna go and, and having my hand, like, the. Being in a position, a platform where you can see what other teams and collecting that information and have a good pulse and where the state, the industry is. But, yeah, like, the running that company was like, I was thinking about Lido before Lido existed. And so when I saw it, I knew the guys that were running it, they were crushing it. They would always crush it.
00:24:20.932 - 00:24:25.292, Speaker B: They would win every single game of state competition for cosmos. They ran the best validators.
00:24:25.348 - 00:24:25.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:25.964 - 00:24:46.992, Speaker B: And so when they were raising, I'm like, take all my money. And so parafy ended up being the first or second largest investor in Lido in the seed round. And everyone is passing on it. People were like, critical of is their merit in having a, like, a cluster of validators. And you have to believe proof of stake was going to happen. And theorem was like, still in that process.
00:24:47.168 - 00:24:49.088, Speaker A: Was that lama shuck or whatever?
00:24:49.176 - 00:24:50.232, Speaker B: Constantine.
00:24:50.408 - 00:24:51.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:51.272 - 00:24:54.048, Speaker B: Those guys P two p, like, they, they know what they're doing.

00:25:48.794 - 00:26:05.026, Speaker A: Empire. Let's talk lido, then. So there's basically there's FUD happening with Lido. I'd say right now, the lido situation, to kind of summarize it, is that there's. There's a total of 19 million ETH staked on Ethereum. 6 million of that ETH is staked on Lido. So the.
00:26:05.026 - 00:26:27.346, Speaker A: The math right there for you, for you all, is 36% of all staked ETH is staked with lido. Some more data points. More than 32% of all validators are using Lido. Currently, lido is the number one protocol on ETH with TvL of more than 13 billion. That is more than twice the TvL, the second largest project, which I. Rockable. No, which is maker.
00:26:27.346 - 00:26:28.082, Speaker A: Maker.
00:26:28.178 - 00:26:30.258, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. Yeah. I thought you were just talking about.
00:26:30.306 - 00:26:51.794, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is. It's close to all. I think it's. 6% of all the ETH in existence is inside of Lido right now. Lido turned on the withdrawals, I think it's two or three weeks ago, had basically no effect on TvL. Over the past month, Lido's TvL grew by 11%.
00:26:51.794 - 00:27:23.140, Speaker A: So, basically, I mean, Lido is just dominating right now. And I think the Fud or the pushback on Lido is that 36% of all staked ETH is held by one entity. And if you look at maybe what folks in the Solana ecosystem or in other ecosystems are saying, the pushback here would be that this kind of centralizes ethnicity and that, like, this, this is just net negative for the system. I would push back on it, but I'm curious. I mean, you've been involved with Lido since.
00:27:23.292 - 00:27:44.056, Speaker B: I would encourage people to go listen to a conversation that. I believe we had Constantine here even before I started officially. Didn't we have him talk about Solana? Like, there was an episode on Solana that we did, and Constantine was actually an early investor in Solana as well, and so we had him on here in Empire believe, and it was him and me talking about Solana. No. Well, maybe we should.
00:27:44.080 - 00:27:47.904, Speaker A: We should have them on. I was talking to him about coming on, and it's just never.
00:27:48.064 - 00:28:33.820, Speaker B: I'll ping him for sure, but I think the. The TLDR is. I think there is a risk, of course, that if anything were to go wrong in the light of smart contracts and not allowed ETH that's no longer accessible or there's a bug or whatever, it's problematic. But people should be aware that there are a number of entity validators within the lido ecosystem that constantly get reviewed, and it's not like just one, you know, party that is validating. There are a number of people in that lido ecosystem that do it, is my understanding, and has been for a while, I believe. But. So, yeah, I just want to point that out.
00:28:33.820 - 00:28:55.864, Speaker B: Right. I mean, there is a risk, of course, and there's always smart contract risk, but there's a lot of Lindy, of course, now in how they manage their operations and how they sort of, the committee itself manages reviews, which validators get inducted into this kind of like, federation of sorts.
00:28:58.164 - 00:29:05.074, Speaker A: Liquid staking was always going to be a winner take all game. And, yeah, winner take most. Winner take most.
00:29:05.114 - 00:29:57.334, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, look, it's a fluid market, right? A lot of people are looking at the rates that you can get on some of these various liquid staking derivatives and then easily move around. And so now that the market's a bit more fluid, now withdrawals are enabled, then I think it naturally, there may be some more, I guess, movement, and that ratio may, may fluctuate over time. But the reason I brought up the Solana kind of point is, I think when you're thinking about blockchains, generally speaking, I think it's natural tendency for these systems to cluster and have some concentration. And because the argument for Solana has always been, well, it's really hard to run a validator. The computing costs are much higher than Ethereum. Like, in Ethereum, anyone with a raspberry PI can, like, run a node, but no one really does.
00:29:57.334 - 00:30:18.934, Speaker B: Right. In practice, no one kind of, very few people do that. And so it's just important to remember, like, yeah, of course you want to push decentralization, and in a perfect world, you would want to have that number go down. But the question is, if it's going to happen, it's happening already. I mean, 6% is, I would say it's, like, not ideal, but it's not also huge, right? It's not like 50%.
00:30:19.054 - 00:31:32.944, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I think there are two important things to think about here, too. One is, what's the alternative? The alternative is, if you look at the top staking folks, it was decentralized exchanges like Kraken and binance, and now Coinbase is coming up there. So would you rather have all of this capital and ETH inside of Lido, or would you rather have it inside of the centralized exchanges? For me, I'd way rather have it inside of lido. And then the other thing that I think you have to consider. So if you believe that the end state for liquid staking is a winner take all or winner take most market, then you kind of have to think about like, well, are you fine with that? And if you're not, or are you not fine with that? And if you're not fine with it, then how do you. You're basically, you're basically asking Lido to self limit the amount of, the amount of market share that they have, which sends the message that if you get too much market share, Ethereum is going to, like Ethereum and the Ethereum community are going to go against you, which I actually think has a really negative repercussion of disincentivizing builders to build really big and successful companies and, like, value added projects on top of Ethereum.
00:31:33.764 - 00:31:34.404, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:34.524 - 00:31:43.764, Speaker A: So my pushback for, my advice for people who don't like Lido gaining all this market share is like, free market, go build a better product. Lido's got the best product on market right now.
00:31:43.884 - 00:32:04.284, Speaker B: There was a poll that, I mean, for this discussion, it's kind of ongoing and important. Like, Deejon Spartan has kind of been covering it pretty well. There's a poll that, um, talked about what you just said, like, Lido poll with people. Lido could vote. Of course, it's a, should Lido, like self limit? And the overwhelming, you know, majority said no. Like 99.81% said no.
00:32:04.284 - 00:32:44.606, Speaker B: Now, of course, you know, these are people that have Lido. So, yeah, they're biased, obviously. It's kind of a. But still, you know, uh, there's a concept called, like, ferric victory, which is if you're a lido holder, like, at what point do you push it? I think the, you might look at that if you're a light holder and said you want to make sure that this is the dominant player. And of course it's like. But then if there comes a point where you don't want it, maybe right now it's fairly low, and you say, could it go to 12%? Yeah, why not? But if after a certain limit, I think even as a lie to holder, you say, wait for the good of the ecosystem, you kind of don't want it to go up above a certain range.
00:32:44.780 - 00:33:28.950, Speaker A: But I don't think any pushback, if there's any pushback on Lido, I actually think people are focusing on the wrong thing here. If you had to push back on Lido, I don't think it's about their market share and about monopoly, because I think that liquid staking will always, like, that market is, like I said, going to be a winner take most market. I haven't looked in a couple of months at the number of addresses that control the protocol. But last time I checked, I think it was around 50 or 60. And like, that number should probably increase. So that would maybe if I had, if I'm trying to pick a problematic thing here. Yeah, let's move on.
00:33:28.950 - 00:33:35.742, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Let's talk Animoca.
00:33:35.918 - 00:33:44.544, Speaker B: So, and by the way, this is, I think, the most important thing. If you're going to listen to one thing of this episode, I think it says so.
00:33:44.884 - 00:34:03.964, Speaker A: Ryan weeks at the Block reported that. Let me just read this story. So, Animoca, this is the title. Animoca chair says turbulence of last two years to blame for delayed 2020 accounts. This was kind of like, seemed like a nothing burger story. No one reshared this story, really. But let me read some of the highlights here.
00:34:03.964 - 00:34:53.529, Speaker A: Animoca Brands was given an extension until the end of Q one this year for publishing audited 2020 accounts, but it is yet to do so. Chairman Yatsu said the impact of events in 2021 and 2022 are to blame for the delays. Are partly to blame for the delays. Animoca is yet to produce a long delayed set of accounts for 2020. They have been given an extension to file an audit, their audited financial report for 2020, which was originally due to australian regulators by the end of 2022. The once listed firm negotiated a later filing date, pushing the deadline to the end of the first quarter of this year, with subsequent Quint accounts to be filed later in 2023. A spokesperson at Animoca did not expect to miss the deadlines.
00:34:53.529 - 00:35:49.632, Speaker A: They said two months after the revised date. Thick a spokesperson said at the time that Animoca did not expect to miss the deadlines, but they did, in fact, miss the deadlines. But two months after the revised date, the accounts are yet to appear. This could be a total nothing burger of a story, but we are too deep into the bear market and have had too many of these kind of things that when I see something like this, my spidey senses start going off. And I think there are a lot of conversations about, like, when you see something, a lot of times in the bull market, people would see kind of like, weird things like this and wouldn't say anything. And I now feel like it is my responsibility and your responsibility and to call out things like this, I'm very hopeful. This is a total nothing burger and they're just slammed.
00:35:49.632 - 00:35:55.576, Speaker A: But, man, I know what we've done an audit at blockworks. I know what it takes to do an audit.
00:35:55.760 - 00:36:02.844, Speaker B: Sorry, but even if you're slammed. You do not miss your audit for, was it two, three years now? Two years?
00:36:03.184 - 00:36:07.296, Speaker A: It's mid 2023, my friend. The 2020 audit is not done. Come on.
00:36:07.360 - 00:36:40.804, Speaker B: Losing my mind. Yeah, yeah. I think there's an interesting, before I give my thoughts here, and by the way, we're paying a lot of attention to this and we will be reporting on it. And if someone from Animoca wants to come forward and explain the situation, we would love to do that. So there's an interesting statement from the believe. It's Yatzu. The chairman says that the issue here, why purportedly they're delayed, is they are, quote unquote.
00:36:40.804 - 00:37:13.206, Speaker B: Let's say we made an investment in 2022, in 2020, and it had an impact in 2021 or 2022. They want to reflect that impact in the 2020 accounts. And that's basically what's causing quite a bit of these delays. Right. So my, I read that and I need to validate and confirm this by looking at their financial statements. But my intuition is that it's related to how they hold their investments and how they account for those. So for context, right, at MoCA is a huge holding company.
00:37:13.206 - 00:37:54.964, Speaker B: They've made, I mean, God, they made every investment under sun on gaming. And, you know, so they, they have their hands on a lot of investments, hundreds probably. And so anytime. And this brings me back to my days when at Parafi, like when, when you're marking a position, you have to at some point, right? If you make an investment, you typically carry it a cost, right? If it's venture, and then it takes time. And if they raise around or they have a liquid token but it's locked, then you have to somehow account for that in the balance sheet. Sorry. In the financial statements, as a holding company, kind of, you're reporting like, you know, the value of your book.
00:37:54.964 - 00:38:19.770, Speaker B: And I think that that's the discrepancy here. And that's why they've delayed. Now the question becomes, well, what kind of policy have and how have they marked their positions over time? To your point, around FTX, this is a huge problem, right? Some people are a bit more aggressive than others and how they mark their positions. And so, well, that was the whole.
00:38:19.802 - 00:38:27.466, Speaker A: Thing that started to unravel them as they marked these positions. Super low float, like FTX got a.
00:38:27.490 - 00:39:08.314, Speaker B: Lot into trouble because they were marking their serum position and borrowing against that, which is a, in a liquid position. And two, it's very low float and price discovery is, you could argue, that's not the real price of the project, right. A lot of these crypto projects raise money or have a token and there's like less than 10% of the circulating supply, of the total supply is circulating. Sorry. And so the, the valuation of that project like is not in the billions. It's like if you try to sell your position right now you will not get that price. And a big indicator of that is secondary market activity.
00:39:08.314 - 00:39:48.532, Speaker B: The price in the secondary market is a far more realistic barometer of the value of that position. And if you look at the secondary market historically over the years, like over the last six, seven years, the discounts on these illiquid positions tend to be at least 30, 40, 50, even up to 90, 80%, right. If you're holding like a liquid bag of a gaming project are you're not marking that a price of token right now say they have a ton of axie, maybe they invest in Axie and axie has a token price. You go on Coingecko and you see the price. You're not in your books. You should not be multiplying the price of that.
00:39:48.628 - 00:39:49.756, Speaker A: No, no.
00:39:49.860 - 00:40:24.384, Speaker B: With your position which is locked and you can't sell today. And even if it was not locked there's like different discounts that I think of in my brain. One is a liquidity discount, the other one is sort of like illiquidity, meaning it's locked. Like you can't practically sell it, it's not freely traded. The other ones of course are more structural, which is you can't sell the position like marketable marketability. If you're a huge holder, good luck trying to offload that book. Like Tiger for instance is offloading a bunch of their tokens.
00:40:24.384 - 00:40:47.590, Speaker B: When they do that everything's unchained. You could see that. And prices go down 20, 30%. Like after huge unlocks sometimes. Depends on the secondary market activity. But again it's worth focusing on because animoca is a big player in the space. What did they, they used to be public.
00:40:47.590 - 00:40:54.494, Speaker B: They're no longer public. Right. They got delisted by the australian securities Exchange. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:40:56.194 - 00:41:06.054, Speaker A: Just, yeah. Just putting up the red flag on this one to make an audit is like take a lot of work. But it's a pretty simple thing if your books are in order.
00:41:07.474 - 00:42:03.644, Speaker B: Well you said something. Yeah, you said something really interesting because bull markets tend to abscond these things. Like you know, I mean in raging bull market if you're valuing your book none of this kind of really matters, right? You don't get margin called, you can meet your whatever. But as soon as prices go down, good luck. You know, there's a huge unraveling. I hate that that'll be the case, but it's not looking good. And I sort of have a few questions, like, where are the investors in Animoca? Like, if I'm an investor, I'm not, but if I were an investor in Animoca, you know, I'm like, who's calling chairman? Who's on the board? And who's saying, hey, guys, like, what's up? Like, who's in the supervisory committee? Who's in the financial committee? Like, is there zero? Like, it's just crazy sometimes.
00:42:03.644 - 00:42:46.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, mind you, this happened. Andron, like, bad accounting policies have, like, taken down so many companies. And, like, even though, even though large auditing firms have stepped, you know, after FTX, I think, like, even before that, a few large auditing firms have said, look, we're not going to audit crypto companies. Matter policy. But still, I think, you know, there are firms doing audits out there. And if you're a holding company, it's fairly straightforward about, like, you know what I mean? Like, there's some nuance and reporting that needs to be done, like, footnotes and whatnot, but it's not rocket science. No.
00:42:49.074 - 00:42:51.414, Speaker A: We'Ll keep an eye on it. Let's move past.
00:42:52.514 - 00:42:57.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we'll talk more about it next week once we look at the financial statements.
00:42:58.794 - 00:43:04.490, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know if the financial statements are public. I, like, I don't want to. Yeah, I want to look into it.
00:43:04.522 - 00:43:15.358, Speaker B: They're not. Um, okay, well, if someone from Animoca wants to come and talk about this stuff, would love to. Okay. We don't raise fud, but it is alarming. It's concerning.
00:43:15.406 - 00:43:44.012, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty concerning. Let's talk about the SEC. If you guys remember, the SEC. A year ago, the DOJ and the SEC charged this former Coinbase product manager with insider trading. His name is Ishaan. Wahee. They charged Ishaan and two others said that they made more than a million bucks trading on insider information, um, uh, specifically, like, based on confidential information about future listings, uh, that, that this PM got from being a PM at Coinbase.
00:43:44.012 - 00:44:28.434, Speaker A: Uh, there's actually a pretty interesting thing that just kind of went under the radar here. The SEC just entered a proposed settlement in their case against Ishaan, uh, the, the former Coinbase PM. I'm not sure what this, so, and, like, the full story here is that he pleaded guilty to the DOJ charges and settles, but strongly contested the SEC charges paradigm. The fund also filed a brief supporting Ishaan's defense against the SEC, arguing that the tokens could not be deemed securities even if they were initially sold in securities transactions. And it looks like the SEC just entered this proposed settlement. I think it's a pretty big deal here, actually. I think it's a complete surrender on the SEC's behalf.
00:44:28.434 - 00:45:07.232, Speaker A: I think it shows the weakness. And the SEC's, like, big theories about secondary market trading of crypto. I think it's a pretty decent and meaningful development for the industry. This is probably me talking my book and being biased because I don't think that personally think that the SEC should be involved in all of this. But, yeah, I don't know. DOJ got a guilty plea, but the SEC completely folded when they got hit with this pretty intense pushback on their claims that tokens trading on secondary markets were securities. And, yeah, I'm curious if you agree with me that this is that big of a deal, or if you're just like, yeah, this is a nothing burger.
00:45:07.408 - 00:45:36.226, Speaker B: No, I think it's very important and I think it's a part of a broader trend here of. It's nice to see some of these cases where there is pushback. You go to court and you get a better interpretation as opposed to immediately kind of folding and settling. And I think so it's encouraging to see that. Always said this, you know, I have faith in, when we talk about the US being against crypto, I don't. I don't think it's the case. I think I still have faith in the court system and the proper interpretation of these things.
00:45:36.226 - 00:45:47.698, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think that the key, the key, as you said, is this idea that, like, you know, tokens trading on secondary marketing on securities, and I think Coinbase really got behind that paradigm. Got behind that. And it's good to see that for sure.
00:45:47.746 - 00:46:05.394, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we'll see. I mean, this could just be them as well. Like, the optimistic view is that the SEC realized their case is weak and they gave up. The other view is that, like, this was just drawing a bunch of resources and they need to free up resources for their finances.
00:46:05.694 - 00:46:11.262, Speaker B: Chairman Ganser has come out requesting for more budget and.
00:46:11.358 - 00:46:12.474, Speaker A: Oh, you don't say.
00:46:15.414 - 00:46:40.240, Speaker B: By the way, as an aside, we're talking about budget on the debt ceiling resolution that got passed. It would be interesting to see the budget of the SEC, if it went up or not, or stayed the same, because they did a number of cuts, not like super material, but there was a cut. And I'm curious what the budget of the SEC looks like over the next coming years, but maybe we can talk about that next week.
00:46:40.312 - 00:46:41.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know what it is.
00:46:41.392 - 00:46:49.440, Speaker B: But, yeah, I don't know why. There was just, it just popped in my head as we talked about. Are they, you know, because he claims fairly understaffed. Yeah, yeah.
00:46:49.472 - 00:47:01.528, Speaker A: Well, they did pull back the. Remember the IR's got approval to hire like, 140,000 new people or something like that. Did that get part of the debt ceiling negotiation? Was pulling some of that back.
00:47:01.616 - 00:47:02.152, Speaker B: I see.
00:47:02.248 - 00:47:15.524, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. There are a couple interesting things that got caught, clawed back. Like, one of them was COVID. There are a couple of things. Axios did a good article on it. Um, okay, what else, man? I think that's kind of it for this week.
00:47:15.524 - 00:47:27.888, Speaker A: Yeah, don't send your money to bend on ETH or any of these other, like, random addresses that are promising, you.
00:47:27.896 - 00:47:44.816, Speaker B: Know, if you want to send your money. Guys, there's a lot of charities and research institutions out there, like, constantly reminded of, like, just do that. Like, you know, I'm not here to say how you should spend your money and you've hard and you pay, you know, work, worked hard for it and whatnot. So. Yeah.
00:47:44.920 - 00:47:45.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:46.024 - 00:47:47.736, Speaker B: It is amusing to see, for sure.
00:47:47.840 - 00:47:52.584, Speaker A: Yeah, it is awesome, man. What are you doing this weekend?
00:47:52.624 - 00:48:24.152, Speaker B: Any, any books, by the way, or series? Oh, you know what? I want to talk about this. There was a polymarket poll on who. So I watched succession, finally finish it yesterday, and I was shocked at the result. And this will not be a spoiler alert, but polymarket ran a market, I guess, on who the next CEO of succession is going to be. And it was like, when I looked at the poll, I couldn't believe it. And it ended up being right. It's fascinating.
00:48:24.152 - 00:48:37.082, Speaker B: Prediction markets and like, the sort of clustering of wisdom of the crowds, if you will, can work in some instances. It's pretty interesting to see that. So anyways, I watched succession. Pretty cool, pretty entertaining.
00:48:37.218 - 00:48:37.894, Speaker A: Nice.
00:48:38.514 - 00:48:45.642, Speaker B: There's a Conor McGregor documentary out there that came out also interesting. You know, those, those.
00:48:45.738 - 00:49:06.296, Speaker A: Well, I have a recommendation. Obama has this new show on Netflix called working. It's just four episodes. Basically, he goes to three american workplaces. One is the Pierre Hotel in New York. The other is this, like, home healthcare place. And the other is a self driving car startup, the one that acquired uber self driving car unit.
00:49:06.296 - 00:49:28.854, Speaker A: And he basically, in each episode, looks at one part of the totem pole of the workplace. So the first episode is about the lowest people, quote unquote. The next is like the mid people. The third is like the upper class of the companies. And that's as far as I am. I haven't got to the fourth, but I'm assuming the fourth episode is like the CEO or something, or the. The chairman.
00:49:28.854 - 00:49:57.210, Speaker A: Pretty interesting series looking at. I think it's interesting because I'm also just about to start this book called poverty by Matthew Desmond. He wrote this book that was really good called evicted a couple of years ago. And I don't know, just kind of examines how being poor in the US is very different than being poor in a bunch of other rich countries and have two friends I really respect who highly recommended it.
00:49:57.242 - 00:50:10.330, Speaker B: Kind of like the hillbilly eulogy which was gained popularity a few years back. Guys, like, being poor in America is not being poor in like, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Maybe that's not the right.
00:50:10.402 - 00:50:14.242, Speaker A: Not real, not really that. But that was also a good book.
00:50:14.418 - 00:50:33.974, Speaker B: That was a good book. Speaking of, like, I think around this idea of poverty, there's a great YouTube, great book, but like, the world is not as bad as it seems. I think Hans Rosling, who passed away, but he has great YouTube. I think it was a TEd talk, but it's on YouTube. Find it. It's really good. Whenever you lose faith in humanity, in the world and whatnot.
00:50:33.974 - 00:50:53.798, Speaker B: Like, go look at that. Because I think the media 24/7 news cycle tends to portray the world in a far, far worse situation because of huge problems in the world. But it's really interesting when you apply actual data and statistics and look at how far we've come. Less conflict, you know, mortality rates, poverty. Like, statistically speaking, we are in a way better place.
00:50:53.926 - 00:50:54.350, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:54.422 - 00:51:06.914, Speaker B: Than we were like 5002 hundred years ago. So that's not to say that we can't do better as humanity, as humans, but nonetheless, we'll end it on a cheerful note, you know, go out and have some. Some fun this weekend.
00:51:09.654 - 00:51:10.974, Speaker A: We have a ton of open roles.
00:51:11.014 - 00:51:11.614, Speaker B: Yes.
00:51:11.774 - 00:51:13.142, Speaker A: Come work at block works. That's my.
00:51:13.198 - 00:51:21.230, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's nice to see that. And, you know, permissionless is coming up. So excited about that. I'll make the plug. You know, you see this? You always plug this now and playing it.
00:51:21.302 - 00:51:21.902, Speaker A: I love it.
00:51:21.958 - 00:51:26.222, Speaker B: I'm excited about it. I'm excited to go to Austin and hang out with crypto peeps.
00:51:26.358 - 00:51:29.006, Speaker A: Nice. All right, sir. Be well. Enjoy the weekend.
00:51:29.110 - 00:51:29.542, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:51:29.598 - 00:51:33.294, Speaker A: Thanks for listening, everyone. And we'll see you on Tuesday for another episode awesome.
00:51:33.334 - 00:51:33.614, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone.
