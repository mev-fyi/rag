00:00:00.360 - 00:00:18.750, Speaker A: My investors know that I'm long only to me, actually a one way street. It's genuinely a vortex for the entire world's capital and all the money that exists out there. I think it is the greatest wealth redistribution that will happen in the modern era. And I think in hindsight, we will look back on it as being obvious.
00:00:18.902 - 00:00:43.370, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so on empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We posted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20. We'll see you in London. This episode is brought to you by Toku.
00:00:43.370 - 00:01:17.114, Speaker B: If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token. Are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards, or just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team. From easy to use token grant award templates, through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings. Make it simple today with Toku. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have Olaf Carlson, we founder of Polychain employee at number one from Coinbase back in, I think, 20 12, 20 11, 20 13.
00:01:17.194 - 00:01:18.978, Speaker A: Early 20, 1313.
00:01:19.026 - 00:01:21.414, Speaker B: That's right. But Olaf, welcome back to the show, man.
00:01:21.714 - 00:01:22.954, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:01:23.034 - 00:01:39.120, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think so. Last time you were here was May 2022. The peg on USD just broke. Went from a dollar down to like $0.30, went back up to, I think it was trading at around sixty eight cents. At the time of recording, Luna had fallen from like $84 down to two or $3.
00:01:39.120 - 00:01:56.554, Speaker B: Um, and I asked you this question, which was, uh, you've been through many market cycles, right? Saw the crash of 20 11, 20 14, 20 18, and now we can say 2022. I would love to just ask the same question that I asked you back then, which was like, what is your framing for how you view the markets today?
00:01:59.054 - 00:02:56.484, Speaker A: Crypto is most of the time in a bear market. Like, when you just think about the amount of time you spend in the market, it tends to go up very, very quickly and then sort of bleed out. Over the course of several years, this cycle, so to speak, has played out several times. I just think it's patience. I think crypto is, in a sense, a relatively easy category to invest in, in that you just can sort of buy and hold, and there's very little counterparty risk if you do it right, because your only real counterparty risk is sort of a protocol. You don't have to manage too much exposure to lots of third parties that are holding assets or executing trades or things like that. But at the same time, it's easy for market participants to get really distracted and sort of short term oriented.
00:02:56.484 - 00:03:32.396, Speaker A: In general, people who have just had a long term view in crypto, I think have done the best relative to people who have tried to move really quickly and get where they're trying to go in six months instead of over the course of, say, five years. So I don't think it's that different. I've always been very long term oriented. This is a big project. If we're going to replace the global financial system with software that nobody controls, it's going to take a while, but not that long. It's come a very, very long way over the last ten years.
00:03:32.500 - 00:03:51.254, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you think about, I guess, just positioning as it relates to, I guess, both private and public investing? When you think about when you see what's happening in the market today, maybe it feels like the markets were entering a new cycle. Bull market is maybe kicking off either now or soon. How do you think about just positioning the fund?
00:03:52.074 - 00:04:30.532, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, these are questions about market cycles, but the reality is market cycles are a reflection of things that are happening underneath. Prices are a reflection of reality that's happening underneath. I don't think it's. Does it justice to think just in terms of market cycles. The reason that we are where we are today is because people built things that actually mattered. It's not like bitcoin has just swung up and down randomly. You have the launch of Coinbase in 2012.
00:04:30.532 - 00:05:18.514, Speaker A: You have the launch of Ethereum in 2015. You have the launch of a lot of the infrastructure around Defi and NFts in 20, 1819. In these bear markets, real things get built that lead to market cycles. I think that paying too much attention to prices is you're by definition, following other people who are paying attention to what's happening underneath. And that's these real things that result in markets moving. So I think there's a lot of chatter in crypto about market cycles and prices. I think it's all misguided.
00:05:18.514 - 00:06:05.120, Speaker A: If everybody could just start paying attention to real questions like what's the best way to scale applications that are embedded inside blockchains? That's a very complex question, and the answer to it will give you insights about is the way the market's going to move or how to invest if you're sitting there just on Twitter chattering about prices, you're not going to beat the market. You're probably going to lose to even just market beta because you're just distracting yourself and you're really misunderstanding fundamentally why prices move. Prices are not random. They're a reflection of things that are reflection of basically market participants having insights of one type or another.
00:06:05.232 - 00:06:05.924, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:06.504 - 00:06:38.324, Speaker A: So, you know, I don't spend most of my time on, so to speak, the markets. I spend most of my time looking at businesses and technologies being built and how those things are going that then informs my view on markets and what to buy, what to sell, how to think about it. So I just think if you spend your time on this kind of qualitative reality that underlies prices, you're going to have a much better time.
00:06:38.444 - 00:07:07.284, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe we can go into some of those topics, but you brought up this idea of the best things get built in the bear markets. You brought that up on the last podcast we had, Coinbase. We've had Coinbase in, what, 20, 2015 Bear Market, 2016 OpenSea, and like, 2018 Uniswap. Maybe you could add that to 2019 as well. What do you think got built in this past bear market that really excites you?
00:07:07.824 - 00:07:34.242, Speaker A: So the entire suite of L2, so called. That's a complicated bucket, but I would call it L2 technologies, zero knowledge, cryptography based technologies that's both for scaling and privacy projects like Celestia, projects like Arbitrum. Celestia is a data availability layer. So also sort of a scaling project.
00:07:34.338 - 00:07:36.274, Speaker B: Just got off with nick an hour ago. Yeah.
00:07:36.394 - 00:08:30.974, Speaker A: Oh, great. And then Eigen layer is still in. It's not fully live at full scale, but I think Eigen layer is in the process of getting there. So a lot of these are kind of these core infrastructure pieces that are the result of years and years of fundamental research in cryptography, distributed systems, peer to peer networks, and how to best scale these things. I do think it's easy to forget that when you're not a crypto native and you're sort of tinkering or just kind of testing out one of these apps, they're still pretty horrendously difficult to use, and there's a lot of hoops to jump through. And so I think that simplifying the user experience around these is going, you know, it requires, like, real improvements to these technologies. Yeah.
00:08:30.974 - 00:09:35.594, Speaker A: The only, you know, the other one that comes to mind is, I would call it the next generation of these social finance experiments. So things like Friendtech and Tomoe that are adding a financial incentive layer to the person to person interaction that already exists in these social media applications. And I think that has huge potential. We've kind of gotten this attempts at this in small ways, like through steemit way back in 2015, bitcloud in 2021, and now this generation. And I think there's really something there. It's sort of like axie infinity, right? It ultimately collapsed, but there's obviously something there, right, to get as big as it did. So this is another category where I'm just waiting for the right team to have the right execution.
00:09:35.594 - 00:09:44.298, Speaker A: And I think something is very big there from a consumer perspective. But those are the things, top of mind for me that have launched over the course of the last year or so.
00:09:44.386 - 00:10:15.232, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe we can just go deeper into l two s then and just where, just like these. It's funny, we had a new employee start the other day, and I was explaining the first generation of the Ethereum killers, like the original icos basically back in 2017, kind of that wave, but I think. So it's funny. So blur launched blast yesterday, and I think the general reaction was, everyone's really sick of all these l two s launching exchanges, are now launching l two s. There's all these l two s. But I think people are quick to forget that.
00:10:15.232 - 00:10:54.784, Speaker B: I mean, this kind of wave of l two s has only really been around for, I'd call it maybe two years, you could say. I think Uniswap launched on optimism and arbitrum in summer of 2021, if I remember correctly. So it's really been only around for two years. What is your just general framework for how you're viewing? Like l two s relative to maybe the app chain thesis, which I thought was going to happen on cosmos, but it looks like it's also happening on maybe the l two s as well, versus other ecosystems like Celestia and what they're doing with the da layer relative to maybe what Solana's doing. What is your framework for, I guess you could call this big bucket the modular versus monolithic debate.
00:10:55.404 - 00:11:01.432, Speaker A: Yeah. So we could spend an hour.
00:11:01.568 - 00:11:03.232, Speaker B: Yeah. How much of that tea do you have?
00:11:03.408 - 00:11:55.646, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think, to summarize, in general, I think a kind of modularized stack makes more sense to me for peer to peer networks and things that are trustless. It also just makes more sense to me from an engineering perspective. It's like, let's not depend on one system. Let's build lots of different systems that are interchangeable and can be optimized in each of their relative components rather than depending on a single system. The only real downside I see to that is interoperability across applications. And it's, you know, I don't mean to downplay the downside.
00:11:55.646 - 00:12:48.924, Speaker A: Right. That's, that's a big deal. And one of the core value propositions of, you know, web based applications and also blockchain based applications is that they're all freely interoperable. So I think that's kind of the big question, is there's a certain simplicity to a monolithic architecture. Um, it's just kind of like easier to reason about mentally, um, ultimately, though, I don't think it, it works quite as well, um, for long term scale. Um, and I think it presents a bit more like risk to, um, to the system. I mean, if we're going to build again like the global financial system, um, on the Internet, I, you know, I broadly struggle to see that existing kind of on one piece of tech or like one network.
00:12:49.084 - 00:12:57.344, Speaker B: I get the risk side of that. But what's the like? Why doesn't it scale? Because wouldn't the argument be that it's actually easy, maybe easier to scale on something like Solana?
00:12:58.764 - 00:14:28.406, Speaker A: So peer to peer systems, you know, if you're going to have a resilient, decentralized system where you assume that sophisticated, well financed attackers have real motivation to take down the system or halt the system in some capacity, if you're designing with that framework in mind, which I think is the only way to design, if you're building the global financial system, obviously you can't assume everybody's nice and it's all Kumbaya. You need mutually untrusting parties to be able to operate on the same substrate. I think that scaling assist, I mean, we're getting into a debate that is more properly explained very technically, but at a high level, I think that it's very hard to scale a peer to peer system with billions of users in one kind of monolithic architecture. It makes more sense conceptually to me to break it up into different pieces that all sort of settle back later, in a sense. So that's broadly where I stand on it. I do think it's. I'm happy that we have the burbling chaos in crypto of every experiment being run simultaneously.
00:14:28.406 - 00:14:52.614, Speaker A: It's the number one way to ensure that the entire thing works long term. And I don't, you know, I, obviously I have to invest and place bets on the way I think this future will play out. But broad brushstrokes, you know, I care about the entire thing succeeding like the entire project of crypto. And I'm glad that every single experiment is being run simultaneously.
00:14:52.694 - 00:15:14.764, Speaker B: Yeah, if I remember, did you guys co lead the seed in DyDx several years ago? I think five years ago. So I'm be very curious just to hear what you think about like the app chain thesis dy DX moving from. What were they building on Starkware? I'm just curious how you think about like apps as they hit scale, moving on to like their own sovereign chains.
00:15:15.064 - 00:16:38.654, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of the original complaints about the Ethereum architecture is that every single application has to compete in one fee market, right? What that means is that the transactions or software executions that have the highest p and l for the end user end up getting bidded to the top of the block auction. It means that things like large derivatives trades end up taking up block space away from trading dog playing cards or something like that, right, where the end user is not expecting p and l maybe at all. So I think that argument has real merit to it. Every time we see, for example, a big NFT mint or a big ICO or something like that, you have market participants bidding up block space for that time period. And regular users sometimes can't get, they're just normal transactions to execute in a timely way. I think that app chains allow a specific application to escape that fee auction and block auction.
00:16:38.654 - 00:17:05.616, Speaker A: They're sacrificing some level of interoperability in exchange for a more predictable consumer experience for their users. I think it's just a trade off. I don't think there's a right way or a wrong way, but I think for an application like DydX, execution matters a lot, right? You can't have derivatives trades failing because there's an ICO or something.
00:17:05.720 - 00:17:10.444, Speaker B: Yeah, some big board ape mint or something like that crushing your trades.
00:17:10.824 - 00:17:55.962, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So I think that in a case like DydX, it's quite logical to me that the users value predictability and stability more than interop. That's probably not the case for other types of apps. This is why these questions about the best way to scale or different architectures, they're very nuanced and it's not one size fits all. I don't think there's a silver bullet and I don't think one way is best for every different type of application, developer or user. So I'm just glad every experiment's being run simultaneously. We have an open market, and eventually that market will figure it all out.
00:17:56.058 - 00:17:56.506, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:56.610 - 00:17:56.802, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:56.818 - 00:18:30.922, Speaker B: It almost does feel like if you are a founder in crypto, you are basically building from a ecosystem first perspective, then figuring out the app occasionally. So you're like, maybe I want to build on Ethereum, or I'm a Solana developer. And then you figure out the app as opposed to traditional systems, which would say, nobody says, hey, I'm building on AWS. Let me then figure out the app. You say, look, here's my wireframes, here's my figma. Here's what I'm trying to build, what's best for me. Where should I go build this? It does feel like it's flipped sometimes.
00:18:31.018 - 00:18:41.490, Speaker A: Do you think developers make those decisions based on something other than the best user experience? Because I think developers, 100%, I think.
00:18:41.562 - 00:18:42.826, Speaker B: Now for the first, I think they're.
00:18:42.850 - 00:18:46.414, Speaker A: Agnostic and they build for the best user experience, 100%.
00:18:47.914 - 00:19:10.434, Speaker B: I would say yes, except for the fact that the user aggregation layer historically has been in crypto, it's been at the l one layer. So whereas in traditional systems, that's not how it should actually work. It's like AWS doesn't have. The user hasn't aggregated all the users. So you don't go build on AWS for the users in crypto. That's how it's worked. You will actually go build.
00:19:10.434 - 00:19:18.114, Speaker B: I think that you will build on something that is a worse user experience because they have the distribution. But that's a flawed system.
00:19:18.734 - 00:20:06.532, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if I would call that flawed. That's how just so many different things work. We have so many different kind of legacy ways that there's distribution, just like roads versus railways or something like that. You're always kind of trapped in those legacy distribution systems. It takes a long time to shift tech standards. People are going to always build on the best distribution. You know, like, getting distribution matters so much more than an elegant piece of technology.
00:20:06.532 - 00:20:07.260, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:07.372 - 00:20:11.224, Speaker B: How do you guys. I mean, you. How many portfolio companies do you guys have?
00:20:13.084 - 00:20:18.540, Speaker A: Probably, you know, total investments we've ever made? Probably around 200.
00:20:18.652 - 00:20:40.974, Speaker B: Around 200. So how do you think about it? Like, if someone came to you today, where. And they want to build in defi, they want to build a new, I don't know, purpose market or something like that. Like, are you. Should they go build their own sovereign chain on Cosmos? Should they do it on Celestia? Should they go build on l two? If it's on l two, where should it be? Should it be on Solana? Like, how do you direct that guidance?
00:20:42.514 - 00:21:30.236, Speaker A: Well, it depends on what their goals are. And broadly, it's just what's going to allow you to get the most users the fastest and build a good product that's offering value to users. So I often think that entrepreneurs and developers might have a better sense of that than even I do. Right. But broadly, we're very agnostic. I don't have a strong opinion other than if you're building a consumer product, you need to just go get users, and your go to market approach matters a lot more than a very elegant castle in the sky piece of software that nobody can use.
00:21:30.340 - 00:22:10.608, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed. And it does seem like a lot of this is starting to get abstracted away. I had coffee this morning with this company privy, the founder of privy. They were embedded wallets inside of frontech, and it seems like a lot of that is the infrastructure is actually getting fixed there, or just getting not fixed, but getting improved upon. What about just one more question on this, Olaf. How much weight do you place on? I guess what I'd call narrative simplicity, which I would describe as if you're a developer coming into Ethereum. You can choose arbitrum, you can choose optimism, Zksync, and so many others, as opposed to, like, look, that's confusing.
00:22:10.608 - 00:22:18.204, Speaker B: Let me just go build on Solana because it's the. Or avalanche or whatever. The simpler option. How much weight do you put on that?
00:22:20.904 - 00:22:52.924, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you know, I think. I don't know if that is, if it is simpler like you might think it is. But, you know, I like, again, it's like, build where you think you can acquire users fastest. Right? Like, I. This is complicated questions. You have to make a bet on where users will go. You have platform risk.
00:22:52.924 - 00:23:42.512, Speaker A: As a developer, this is not that unique to crypto, just across everything. If you're going to build, let's say, on a social media network, it's like, do you build on Instagram or do you build on TikTok? And you do have to, on some level, have a prediction about where those platforms are going to be five years from now. In the early days of the Internet, it was the decision to build on the Internet instead of advertising in catalogs or something. There is platform risk. As an entrepreneur, there's jurisdictional risk. If you're going to start a company in America, you probably should have some level of view about where that country is going to be in five or ten years. Um, so, you know, this.
00:23:42.512 - 00:24:10.524, Speaker A: This never ends. Like, as an entrepreneur, you're making a bunch of layered directional bets, um, that you should have some view on. Yeah, um, I. I just. I have views on these things. But the reality is, um, for me, you know, it. It's clear because we're asking these questions that nobody has a definitive answer right now.
00:24:10.524 - 00:24:17.124, Speaker A: I can't look at a crystal ball and know exactly how this is going to play out. I kind of have a probability weighted view, is the way to put it.
00:24:20.384 - 00:24:45.654, Speaker B: What about maybe switching gears a little? What about leverage? If you think about the last cycle, I think you could probably categorize this as the leverage driven cycle, whether it's block five, Genesis, Celsius, the list goes on. And that was, I think, actually great at the beginning, and it kickstarted a lot of things, but obviously ended up in flames. How do you think leverage evolves in the next cycle?
00:24:49.714 - 00:25:32.142, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of interaction between leverage and sort of like, larger financial markets and like interest rates. For example, the fact that during COVID interest rates basically were at zero, there's a lot of capital available. I think that leads to macro level more leverage. I think if interest rates go up, you probably see less leverage. If interest rates go down, you see more. I know it's a very basic observation, but I think it is a big part of what led to leverage in the previous cycle. And I think in general, crypto is a very reflexive asset.
00:25:32.142 - 00:26:31.662, Speaker A: So what I mean by that is demand often goes up as price goes up, which is sort of against, like, microeconomics 101, right? Where if prices go up, you assume demand goes down. Here, demand in a sense goes up because the price going up sort of is the project. So as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable, the probability of it succeeding as sort of an electronic gold or non sovereign store of value is going up and up and up. So you're in this interesting position where one thing I've said in the past is that the risk reward of buying bitcoin is equivalent at every price, because the price going up is the project of becoming this store of value system.
00:26:31.798 - 00:26:49.286, Speaker B: Yeah. What about another form of leverage, which is restaking? You mentioned Eigen Laird. Just be curious to get your general views on restaking in the next cycle. And the way that I've been thinking about it is it's almost maybe this cycles form of leverage, like within Ethereum.
00:26:49.350 - 00:26:49.550, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:49.582 - 00:26:58.194, Speaker B: It's more claims on the same existing ETH. But be curious if you think that's the right framework to be looking at this or just in general, how you view restaking.
00:26:58.614 - 00:28:04.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think one interesting thing is we're going to see very high kind of velocity of money in these systems because you can rehypothecate the same unit of money to secure many, many different applications, pieces of middleware and things like that. So I do think that with this restaking, you're going to see on assets like ETH that can do that restaking, potentially see very good yield, where if you're securing many, many different pieces of middleware, including the main ethereum chain, and you're getting paid to do it in each one of them, I think a big part of unlocking that is going to be slashing. And one tricky thing about proof of stake networks is the vast majority of the time when people are slashed, it's because of it an administrative or operational mistake. It's not actually because they were trying to attack the system.
00:28:04.306 - 00:28:05.906, Speaker B: They're not a malicious actor.
00:28:06.090 - 00:28:59.894, Speaker A: Yes, of course, the protocol cannot tell intentionality, and so it can't really tell if you're malicious or you just misconfigured your node. I think solving that problem is going to be a very big part of how we can get this sort of restaking ecosystem to be very big. Because if you can solve that problem through an insurance product or something else, there's lots of different approaches. It just means you could have it auto restake. And so you're just like, I'll sign up for every single piece of middleware that people can come up with if that's the case. And I suspect that there's lots of different types of applications that could use the security afforded by an ethereum like system. I think you could see ETH become like a supercharged asset.
00:28:59.894 - 00:29:09.304, Speaker A: Right? I know that's sort of a dumb way of putting it, but what I mean is getting yield from lots and lots of different places all at once.
00:29:10.924 - 00:29:29.184, Speaker B: Because all these other blockchains will want to rent one of the most valuable things in crypto, which becomes ETH security. So ETH starts exporting security to other, like Dapps and blockchains and stuff like that, and ETH just becomes this, what you call it, supercharged asset because of. Is because of that. Is that the right thesis?
00:29:29.604 - 00:29:57.210, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. I mean, every type of middleware that needs the security afforded by this massive system just pays those restaking nodes for it. So you also get, I think, a more precise marketplace for how to value that security today. I don't think these things are priced in a super efficient way, in part because nobody really knows what they're worth.
00:29:57.322 - 00:30:14.234, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think we'll see more and more? I guess if you extend that out enough more and more l one s. Like I saw Celo, which used to be an l one, is now becoming an l two, like being a little more ethaligned. Will we see it? Will that trend continue, do you think?
00:30:15.054 - 00:30:15.834, Speaker A: Yes.
00:30:17.574 - 00:30:18.314, Speaker B: Why?
00:30:18.734 - 00:31:24.338, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think that it's become very clear. Bootstrapping your own blockchain system, getting distribution to users nodes, having an asset that's liquid, having a stable system that people can build on, having developers take that sort of platform risk on your system, it's all really, really hard. And so I think that it's become clear launching your own blockchain is a very difficult proposition, whereas plugging into an existing system, obviously much easier. So I think we will likely see that migration continue. I also think that future launches will be much more likely to be, just say, a L2 system or on a L2 system, like an existing one, like arbitrum, instead of trying to build their own sovereign trust network.
00:31:24.466 - 00:31:32.054, Speaker B: Yeah. This is a totally out of left field question, like switching gears a little bit. But how excited are you about bitcoin still?
00:31:33.154 - 00:32:23.210, Speaker A: Oh, very. I mean, I think bitcoin has carved out a very clear value proposition, which is not doing anything. And I think there's no, but I'm serious. I think there's real value to that governance quote you can really view as a security vulnerability. Right. And the system being able to change at all in any capacity, you could view as a security risk, which I think is appropriate. So in the context of bitcoin, you know, just the assurance that it is what it is, I think is the right way for it to be positioned in the market.
00:32:23.322 - 00:32:30.454, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think something like. Or I don't know. Have you been paying attention to ordinals and the resurgence of ordinals and fees on bitcoin? Have you been following this?
00:32:30.834 - 00:32:35.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that, you know, building all these stuff on top of bitcoin makes no sense to me.
00:32:35.722 - 00:32:49.804, Speaker B: Okay. That's. Yeah, it feels foolish to me. It feels like try to be, you've got the best product market fit in all of crypto right now, arguably, outside of maybe that or stable coins, and stop trying to be something that you're not.
00:32:50.504 - 00:32:54.800, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, nobody controls bitcoin. Yeah. Like, no, I think it's important.
00:32:54.912 - 00:32:56.312, Speaker B: There's no CEO making.
00:32:56.448 - 00:33:36.094, Speaker A: I just think it's important to point out that this is just an absolutely chaotic, permissionless market where anyone can do anything, anywhere. Yeah. So it's, it's, you know, it's hard to say. Don't, you know, don't change the bitcoin narrative or something like nobody controls that. But I do think just from an entrepreneur perspective, it's like, why try to build on this platform apps that already were built and exist on other systems and have for years? It's like it doesn't make any sense to me.
00:33:37.474 - 00:34:16.734, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks, 8th ever digital Asset summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan, framework folks coming out Wintermute Vanek Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the having and the spot ETF.
00:34:16.734 - 00:34:40.038, Speaker B: Two, a view from the buy side. Three, rwas tokenization and stablecoins. Four, global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is empire 20.
00:34:40.038 - 00:35:21.438, Speaker B: There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20. This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global team's tokens. From easy to use token grant award templates, through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure, token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted token units, token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens.
00:35:21.438 - 00:36:07.230, Speaker B: For legal, finance and HR teams, it is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens, not to mention the payroll tax obligations. Tax reporting in every country that you employ someone, it is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly, and it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments. Toku makes this simple for leading teams across the space, protocol Labs, DyDx Foundation, Mina Foundation, Hedera gnosis, safe getcoin, and a lot more. Reach out to toku@toku.com.

00:36:07.262 - 00:36:10.782, Speaker A: Olaf, you said 20 12, 20 11, 20 11.
00:36:10.878 - 00:36:24.674, Speaker B: What do you think of in terms of, like, if you had to categorize the first ten years of being in crypto versus the, maybe the next twelve, the next ten years? Like, what do you think are the kind of key differences between what the industry used to look like versus what it will look like?
00:36:26.254 - 00:37:16.424, Speaker A: Um, I mean, I think the first one is that, I mean, it didn't, it wasn't an industry. It was just an open source software project. Um, you know, and I think it was in just total obscurity, like, real obscurity until 2017. Um, and even then it was, like, quite niche. I think 2021 was the first moment where we saw, like, a glimmer of, you know, real mainstream awareness of this whole thing. You know, the, the next ten years are going to be defined more by institutional acceptance and adoption and what that looks like. And I think that just means how different geographies react to this.
00:37:16.424 - 00:37:55.314, Speaker A: It means how companies like, say, coinbase scale and how they grow internationally or work with regulators. It's building just a lot more in public. People are paying attention. A lot more people care about this. But I mostly think that the first set part of this project was a bit of ideological. Like, most market participants joined for ideological reasons or like they were, you know, interested in the tech or, or something. I think the next wave of users are just pragmatists.
00:37:55.314 - 00:37:55.690, Speaker A: Right?
00:37:55.722 - 00:37:57.934, Speaker B: Like, they don't coming in for the ideology.
00:37:58.954 - 00:38:11.660, Speaker A: Yeah. They're here for. To accomplish a very clear goal, and this thing is a tool for them. It's not like an end in itself. So I think that at this very high level is probably the biggest shift.
00:38:11.732 - 00:38:36.654, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think some of those products will be? I mean, the argument, I think, is like, the first ten years, people came in for this ideological. It was an ideological user base. Maybe you were a libertarian, maybe you were down with the banks, whatever it may be. But now, the next ten years, you'll have these pragmatists who are coming in, who have no interest in the ideology. They just want good products from a product perspective. Like, what, what gets you excited there?
00:38:37.154 - 00:38:50.546, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, um, you know, this is a pretty common opinion, but I. I think it is my opinion overall, it's probably social media systems that have a financial incentive layer.
00:38:50.610 - 00:38:52.974, Speaker B: Like, like a, like a friend deck, essentially.
00:38:53.354 - 00:39:34.166, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, you know, I. Like I mentioned, there have been multiple attempts in this category. You know, steam, it, bitcoin tech. What I've seen is that there is a spark there. I've seen lots of regular non crypto users sign up to these apps, and there is something there for real, I think, getting the form factor right, it's not clear that we have gotten it right, but something there, I think is possible to get to global scale, like billion plus users. The second category is gaming, basically, and it's very similar.
00:39:34.166 - 00:39:51.926, Speaker A: It's adding a financial incentive layer to the already existing application logic in a video game. So it's not like reinventing per se, video games or social media. It's just adding a financial incentive layer to a lot of the user behaviors that already exist there.
00:39:51.990 - 00:40:09.936, Speaker B: So for social fi, you get less excited about this idea of, like, you know, you can't get canceled or you can't get, you can own your own data. You get less excited about that. More excited about, look, they're like, basically embedding financial markets into social platforms.
00:40:09.960 - 00:40:15.880, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, definitely. The average user doesn't care about sensors here.
00:40:15.912 - 00:40:18.304, Speaker B: I agree, I agree. I think that's always been a foolish value.
00:40:18.384 - 00:40:34.074, Speaker A: Like the average user that says, oh, wow, like, you know, I have a small influencer following on some XYZ platform, and if I sign up to this new one, there's like $80 waiting for me or something, right? Like that.
00:40:34.494 - 00:40:55.534, Speaker B: I mean, how many of your, I don't know if you do this, but I have friends who will, or I, or I'll do this. Either. It's like, I do it with music and I'll do it with accounts where it's like, I found that song early. Like, I found Fred again early on or something. Or so the ability to bet there, or the ability to say, like, hey, there's this big Instagram account. They have 500,000 followers. And I'm like, oh, I found them when they had 2000 followers.
00:40:56.034 - 00:42:01.334, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. The ability to turn all of these mechanisms into markets is, it's very clear how that could be compelling to your average user. Imagine if you could get paid for being the best TikTok scroller, right? Like, the number of people that are already competing in that without getting paid is in the hundreds of millions and billions. So if we can add markets to things like curation of content, like I said, we already have massive, massive scale content curation systems out here, and it's just adding a financial incentive layer to a lot of these behaviors that already exist. And I think that adding that financial incentive layer can also, like, extend the sophistication of these systems and also lead to kind of new behaviors that maybe are a level of work people were unwilling to do voluntarily.
00:42:01.714 - 00:42:13.964, Speaker B: Yeah, it reminds me of this tweet that you send. I forget when it was a while ago, it was like over time, the, the lines will blur between playing a crypto embedded video game and working a job.
00:42:14.904 - 00:43:08.324, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's in a sense like you and I already work for bitcoin, and I think that this just gets extended more and more and more where you can embed, if you can basically align a sort of work or output with a financial reward in a protocol, you basically get a bunch of people working for that protocol. Right. And I think that the people that are playing around in video games where they're getting rewarded for playing the game, like sometimes that sort of, quote, useless. And what I mean is that the video game isn't doing anything per se. It's like an end in itself.
00:43:08.324 - 00:43:40.342, Speaker A: But I think there's other mechanisms where you can make the behavior a means to an end. So, for example, labeling to train a machine learning algorithm where you think you're playing like this little picture game, but you're really actually contributing to a labeling system for a machine learning system. That's just off the top of my head, but it's, it's where you have a gamified, financialized, like, experience that actually is, is work for somebody or something.
00:43:40.478 - 00:43:42.662, Speaker B: Yeah. No different than captchas. Right.
00:43:42.758 - 00:43:45.006, Speaker A: So, yeah, you guys have been doing.
00:43:45.030 - 00:44:26.484, Speaker B: A ton of research and work and investing in privacy, but, like, the best part about friendtech and the worst part was that you could see everyone who was buying and, you know, also on the flip side, selling your shares. Right. So I remember I was having dinner with, dinner with someone who I thought was a buddy, and he sold my shares like 2 hours before the dinner. And that should be, I'm half joking about that, but also I remember being like, oh, man, he's selling my shares. And I'm curious how you think about just like, okay, there'll be financial markets for all. Not just in financial markets, how we historically think of them, but in social markets and things like that. How do you think about privacy? And would love to just hear the work that you guys have been doing in the privacy space.
00:44:27.374 - 00:45:34.290, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that privacy by default is obviously, to me, very important for everything. And I think the ability to opt out of it and sort of reveal can be very important in certain circumstances as well. But broadly, like, for this to go mainstream in a big way, we need privacy right. We need businesses to be able to have bank accounts that aren't public balances or spending that isn't public, or, you know, the ability to sell your friends, friend tech key or something privately. So, yeah, I mean, I think privacy is going to be critical here for long term success. I think that, as was revealed with the growth of the Internet, on average, people don't care about it that much by default.
00:45:34.290 - 00:45:56.088, Speaker A: We don't have very good privacy on the Internet in sort of non crypto. I think we have an opportunity to fix that with crypto, but, you know, so far, it's clear that it's playing out the same way. People, on average don't care that much. But I think that getting to global scale, it's a very important component of this.
00:45:56.256 - 00:46:26.154, Speaker B: All right, so we talked social fi leverage, restaking. I guess those are, like, those almost feel semi obvious to me in the next one to two years that they'll continue. What are some things that you're. I guess when I think of you and, like, polychain, I've always thought of you as being someone who's good at thinking on the margins of society. I'd just be curious, like, crypto or non crypto? Like, what are some things that you're paying attention to on the margin and, like, on the fringes that maybe are starting to seem obvious to you that don't seem obvious to other people yet?
00:46:27.294 - 00:46:46.152, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm very excited about, like, wearables that can. So there's a surgical approach to, like, a neuralink type surgical approach, which is.
00:46:46.168 - 00:46:48.524, Speaker B: Going into FDA trials, I think, right this week.
00:46:49.264 - 00:47:28.826, Speaker A: Yep. With sort of embedding, computer augmented capacity to the human brain directly. Right. There's a different approach, which is using wearables. So it's non surgical. And usually this category is based on a kind of new research that's called focused ultrasound. I think that's a very big deal, because if you can get that to work, it means that developers could program brain states, basically, like, you'd have the ability to programmably say, I want to be alert, or I want to be sleepy, or I.
00:47:28.826 - 00:47:43.442, Speaker A: I want to be relaxed, or I want to be whatever. Right. If we can build that thing, people are going to put that on and they're never going to take it off. It's like bigger than mobile phones to me.
00:47:43.578 - 00:47:46.214, Speaker B: What is this focus focused ultrasound?
00:47:47.114 - 00:48:50.328, Speaker A: It's a wearable version of something that can use focus ultrasound, which it basically stimulates in a research setting with cubic millimeter accuracy, specific parts of the brain. So it's related to transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is what we've kind of used today to activate different parts of the brain using an external device. It's substantially better at targeting a certain area than transcranian, than traditional transcranial magnetic stimulation. And so it's still kind of in the research phase. It's, you know, this is pretty far from being, like, commercially available in a consumer product, but if it does work, it's a very big deal because you're going to be able to put this thing on and basically program whatever type of brain state you want to be in. Like, if you want to be sleepy, you want to be relaxed, you want.
00:48:50.336 - 00:49:09.444, Speaker B: To be alert, imagine it also be, I mean, I know nothing about this. I'm hearing about it for the first time, but I'll look into it. But I imagine it would be not just helpful for your states that you're in, but also, I mean, if you can target that deep or that, that, that specific of an area layers deep into the brain, you can probably start to remove some, some bad stuff, whether it's like a tumor or some, something like that.
00:49:10.584 - 00:49:36.778, Speaker A: Um, yeah, I don't, I don't. Yeah, it doesn't quite work like that. It's more like it's just stimulating a very specific region of the brain. But it's, you know, I'm very excited, too, about surgical approaches. The problem is, like, the go to market with the surgical approach is obviously tricky from multiple angles. There's a regulatory issue. There's just like a consumer trust issue.
00:49:36.778 - 00:50:23.616, Speaker A: It's going to take a really long time to get everyone feeling comfortable with, like, surgical brain implants, especially this feeling that, wait, I got, like, version one. Should I have waited for version two or things like that? You know, I think just the surgical approach, I'm very excited about it, but it seems tricky to go mainstream with that quickly. This wearable approach. If it works, it's a really, you know, it seems pretty easy. Um, and the, the other thing that's nice about it is if, like, you don't like the way it makes you feel or something, or it gets hacked or something, you can just take it off. There's no, like, um, surgical implant that's like, just sort of in there. Um, so I'm excited about that.
00:50:23.616 - 00:50:30.528, Speaker A: Um, when it comes to wearables, um, I think that, yeah, if I was going to say one category I think people aren't looking at very much, it.
00:50:30.536 - 00:50:32.124, Speaker B: Would be, what about inside of crypto?
00:50:34.094 - 00:51:24.844, Speaker A: Inside of crypto? I think there's a lot of awareness around eigen layer, but I think that it is still under hyped for how big a deal it is, because it allows you to take this security afforded by Ethereum that we pay billions and billions of dollars for every year in the form of minor rewards or validator rewards. It allows you to apply that security to arbitrary application logic. I think that's a really big deal. And I think we're going to see a lot of things launch that wouldn't have if not four eigen layer.
00:51:26.904 - 00:51:31.328, Speaker B: Like what, Olaf? Or like what does that unlock that we couldn't do before?
00:51:31.496 - 00:52:45.264, Speaker A: I mean, any, any. So this is what makes it a big deal, is that it's very hard to imagine all the ways it will get used. You know, like the fact that in the past, to get that level of trust, you had to launch a crypto asset with the kind of peer to peer network attached to it and get the asset to have value and liquidity and get developers to build on top of your platform. It's very tricky to execute and get right the ability to take away all that and just plug into Eigen layer and say, oh, all of a sudden my application has nation state level security. It's got protection from any sort of attack or hacker. It's hard to imagine all the different types of apps that either exist today and would move to an eigen layer like system, or will be uniquely enabled by this existing. A simple example is like an oracle system.
00:52:45.264 - 00:53:23.384, Speaker A: Feeding a price that's not endogenous to a blockchain into a blockchain is actually really, really hard. It's sort of an equivalent problem of feeding a valid block into a blockchain, right? Where sort of, by definition, there's a huge financial incentive to feed in bad data. And you have this. The whole system is basically designed to validate the legitimacy of this one piece of data that's not inside the system and added to the system. So it's really, really hard to build with Eigen layer. It's very easy to build something like an oracle system.
00:53:25.124 - 00:53:48.896, Speaker B: We can come back to this idea that we started with about cycles as we think about wrapping this up. I listened back to this episode that we did back in May 2022, and you said, this line, you said, now begins the era of buying, not selling. And I think that was a pretty good call. Maybe I'd ask the inverse of that, which is like, how do you think about selling, not buying and when to start thinking about that?
00:53:49.000 - 00:54:26.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I don't sell. I think that this is a one way street, to be honest. I know that it sounds maybe ludicrous to people, but I really think that crypto assets will outlive fiat money in the long term. So to me, it's like a one way street. The goal is not to go from dollars into bitcoin back to dollars. It's just to convert into crypto.
00:54:27.224 - 00:54:42.650, Speaker B: So I get that. I actually agree with you. I had this debate with Santiago, who couldn't make it today on the last round up podcast that we did. But I don't sell, like, I don't sell my bitcoin. I don't sell my ETH. I'm not like, trying to, like, trade in and out to stack more sats. Like, I don't do that.
00:54:42.650 - 00:55:06.390, Speaker B: And he was arguing that you should have a price target on everything, the counter. So I actually really agree with you. The counter, I might have those, like, you have lP's that you have to report to. So price of ETH hits $20,000 in this cycle. Like, do you think about taking any money off the top to, like, because you have to send a quarterly investor report or something to polychain lP's or.
00:55:06.422 - 00:55:29.954, Speaker A: No, my investors know that I'm long only. Well, so I. You know, I. It's. It's, to me, actually a one way street. It's genuinely a vortex for the entire world's capital and all the money that exists out there. I think it is the greatest wealth redistribution that will happen in the modern era.
00:55:29.954 - 00:56:28.246, Speaker A: And I think in hindsight, we will look back on it as being obvious. But we're in it right now, and it can be quite confusing, even though so far, when I look at the validation, we've seen just this incredible growth. It's inarguably been the best investment category of. Of the last decade. And I have very little reason to believe anything has changed. Like my initial thesis around this category I developed over ten years ago, and it's basically just played out. It's also expanded substantially because back then I did not foresee that arbitrary programmable logic could be executed inside these secure blockchain systems.
00:56:28.246 - 00:57:10.856, Speaker A: I assumed it was just about this one asset and a payment system for that asset. I did not foresee things like synthetic assets or marketplaces for trading or lending being actually embedded inside blockchains. It's expanded from just money to money and finance. Now I think it's expanding to, like, money finance and application logic. Right? So I think it's turned out to only be bigger and broader than I could have ever expected. And I just need a really convincing reason to change my view, because it's been nothing but validated.
00:57:11.000 - 00:57:39.486, Speaker B: So I'm not here to try to convince you of that. I'd be curious, though, like, one more question on that note would be, on a macro scale, I very much agree with you. And, like, so I also don't really sell things, but I'm curious how you think about. So, like, bitcoin ETH never sell. Maybe you have, like, a couple other assets you're never selling. Do you have other things in your portfolio where you say, look, there is something that could cause me to sell. I don't want to name any names, but, like, insert project here, like ETH bitcoin, I'll never sell.
00:57:39.486 - 00:57:45.836, Speaker B: But this and this, like, maybe in this cycle, I'll sell it. Or if you're taking a position on something, you just don't sell it.
00:57:46.030 - 00:57:54.736, Speaker A: Well, it's all. It's all fastest horse, right? So, like, you know, when I say long, only, I mean, like, long crypto long.
00:57:54.800 - 00:57:56.752, Speaker B: Well, that's okay. I know you're long crypto, but on.
00:57:56.768 - 00:58:35.750, Speaker A: A micro, you have some level of diversification, you know, inside crypto, and then you want to have the fastest horse inside crypto. Yeah, but I think one thing that, you know, your friend who says you want to sell the thing, like, they're still trapped in this idea that there is a foundational unit of account that's sort of, like, cosmic or something, when it's. There isn't. There's just relative value between different assets. Like, there is no default. Go back to thing. It's just the value, dollars.
00:58:35.750 - 00:59:18.394, Speaker A: The dollar is just another asset, and it has a lot of liquidity, but every asset is only valuable relative to every other asset, and you just want to own the fastest horse if you're growing a portfolio. So, to me, the whole idea to be in crypto is because I think it's the fastest horse category. And then inside the portfolio, you want to have some level of diversification to make sure you're, um, you're diversified a bit, and then you just want to own the fastest horse inside crypto. So, um, I know that's. I didn't answer your question directly, but that's.
00:59:18.434 - 00:59:33.386, Speaker B: You did, actually. You did. I. This is, um. This is maybe too personal of a question. We can cut this out of the podcast episode if you want to, but, um, do you own. Do you own assets outside of crypto? Do you own stocks? Do you own real estate? Do you own, like, do you or is it all crypto?
00:59:33.490 - 00:59:36.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I I do, but the vast majority is crypto to.
00:59:38.564 - 00:59:48.304, Speaker B: Olaf. Man, this is an awesome conversation. Anything that we didn't talk about that you really wanted to cover, plans for polychain topics inside of crypto, anything we missed?
00:59:49.764 - 00:59:58.172, Speaker A: I think we covered a lot. There's always more to cover, but I think we covered a lot of the big topics here.
00:59:58.268 - 01:00:00.556, Speaker B: All right, thanks for coming on, man. Always a pleasure.
01:00:00.620 - 01:00:02.038, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me.
