All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have Sandeep, one of the founders of Polygons.
00:00:41.744 - 00:00:44.328, Speaker A: Sandeep, man, welcome. Welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:00:44.496 - 00:00:46.896, Speaker B: Yep, thanks. Thanks, Jason, for having me here.
00:00:47.000 - 00:01:12.128, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, man. So what I want to talk about today is Polygon 2.0, which is super exciting. And the way I was thinking about doing a little prep for this episode and was reminded by how much you guys have going on at Polygon. You have Polygon proof of stake, the proof of stake network. You have Polygon zkevm, you have Polygon maiden. You have polygon supernets, which is the app chain focus scaling solution.
00:01:12.128 - 00:01:48.504, Speaker A: You have Polygon id, and then you have what I think a lot of folks who listen to empire know you for, which is these crazy big biz dev deals with folks like Reddit, and I think it was maybe Nike too, and Starbucks and folks like that. And it seems like your goal for Polygon 2.0 is bringing this all together through this kind of network of zero knowledge l two blockchains. So I think what would be helpful here is, before getting into the what of Polygon 2.0, I'd love to get into the why of Polygon 2.0 and why this is the, it feels like the culmination of all of your work the past five years. Would love to hear about that.
00:01:48.844 - 00:02:57.898, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that the why for us has remained always very, very, you know, has been very, very consistent. And that is, how do we create the web3 infrastructure for mass adoption? It might sound, you know, cliched because of the last four or five years, because we are all stuck in the same, you know, same stage where everybody keeps saying that we want to see mass adoption, mainstream adoption and whatnot. But here we are now where we still don't have a lot of good applications built on web3. But basically the goal is that from our side is to create that infrastructure. I would argue that we don't have Dapps because we don't have scaling as of now, none of the chains or none of the applications that you see today. Or, you know, people keep saying that there is so much of lock space, but where are the applications? None of these actually, you know, none of. None of the applications have that kind of scalability.
00:02:57.898 - 00:03:47.100, Speaker B: Like, if any one of them, you know, goes really viral and starts having like 1 million, 2 million daily active users, that app alone will break the chain, whatever that app app is or whatever that chain is. So that's why, like, you know, the quest is that we create this infinitely scalable, you know, blockchain infra where people can develop these trustless applications and grow it to multimillion users. So that, that, that's where the, that is the why of that. Like, why is. Yes, like, we believe that web3 is basically the next evolution of humanity. Like, how we conduct our businesses, like, how we live. We live our lives in the, in these digital worlds for the mo, for most of the times.
00:03:47.100 - 00:04:49.210, Speaker B: And, you know, all the. All our digital life is controlled by some institutions which are in the middle. Like, you know, in this case we are recording, let's say, via some third party, the, you know, online podcasting or you watch YouTube or you are your own email. Everywhere there is a middle party and big institution involved in between. And we all know that how much the low trust environment has got created in the past few decades. So why web3? Obviously, we seem, or we expect this new trustless era to come in wherein applications or our digital lives that we are living, we can live it, live this life more trustlessly. And, you know, and hence we need an infra which can actually accommodate, let's say, 100 million users, 100 million daily active users, right? And for that, I don't think anybody, any infrastructure, you know, chain or anything is ready.
00:04:49.210 - 00:05:45.920, Speaker B: And Polygon 2.0 is our, like, you know, attempt to consolidate all the kind of different parts of the research that we have done, whether it's like the. Was of the polygon Pos, which started as a plasma, or with the ZK, which includes like different kinds of, like, you know, EVM, non EVM, like Maidan, for example, is non EVM. And all of these cheap things coming together in like an environment which has consolidated liquidity. Because what we are building is this whole ecosystem is about building these financial rails for this new age, you know, finance world. Like right now, blockchains are still primarily confined towards the financial use cases. And these financial use cases, you don't need this modern environment and we need, like we need this environment to be infinitely scalable as well.
00:05:45.920 - 00:06:26.238, Speaker B: As you know, the liquidity needs to be consolidated. Like I keep giving this example of like if you see the web two world today, the web two world is practically, practically infinitely scalable. You can launch as many applications every other day, new websites, new applications are launched, more capacity, more servers are added into the system. But the current web two system is the Internet of information. So information is very seamlessly interoperable. Like, you know, we are talking like I am probably on UAE's network and you are somewhere in the US Internet, us network. And these networks are connected with each other.
00:06:26.238 - 00:06:52.924, Speaker B: We can create, share and exchange information seamlessly. Same way should be possible with web3 for value. And that's why like Polygon 2.0 is there infinite scalability. You can add as many chains, as much scalability into the ecosystem, but the liquidity is still consolidated with one single trust layer, or trust less layer. I would say that is ZK provided by the settlement layer of Ethereum.
00:06:53.044 - 00:07:10.204, Speaker A: Hmm. So what's happening with what is. How would you define Polygon 2.0? I was reading about it, it seems like there are governance updates to economics updates, the pos moving to kind of, you've got the validium and then you've got the ZKe EVM. Can you give us basically like break it down into a couple of components here of like what's actually happening with 2.0?
00:07:10.244 - 00:07:38.486, Speaker B: Yeah. So see all the governance and token update and everything, these are just means to achieve that trustless and community governed network. But what the network is doing is very simple. Like if you see, like we started with the quest to build the L2 networks. So we have the Polygon Pos chain, which we are like, because when we started, the approach was plasma. People used to talk about state channels, then optimistic roll ups came in. And we know the problems with optimistic roll ups.
00:07:38.486 - 00:07:53.626, Speaker B: They are like kind of a midterm solution. And then, but then, you know, we and everybody, every researcher in this industry knows that and understands that ZK is the end game for all of this, right? All of these trustless systems, or these chains, as you would call it.
00:07:53.690 - 00:08:09.514, Speaker A: So can you explain that real quick, just like before we move forward, can you explain why optimistic is this kind of like short term solution? Because if you look at the l two space, most people are like familiar with optimism and arbitrum, and those are both optimistic solutions right now. So can you explain why ZK is the.
00:08:09.594 - 00:08:51.882, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So essentially in these L2s, what exactly you are doing is you are having, you are doing some computation on an off chain environment, right? Which is like, let's say, the chain of optimism, arbitram, whatever it is, right? And you essentially, with L2, what you want to do is you want to prove this computation completely on Ethereum. And you want to make sure that users, if the users stop trusting this chain, they can exit based on Ethereum only. They don't have to come to this chain. They can exit from Ethereum only. These are the two main things that you're trying to do. How optimistic rollups achieve that is they say that, okay, you have to do computation on a separate side so that you can scale.
00:08:51.882 - 00:09:40.220, Speaker B: But what you have to do is you have to still provide all the data back to Ethereum and the proofs of the state transitions. Why you have to provide all the data. And that is exactly why it's called optimistic. Right? Optimistic means like, there is nothing special that you are doing technologically, technology wise. It's a fairly simple technology. If you see, like, there is nothing special you are doing, what you are doing is optimistically assuming that the L2 chains are working fine, the sequencer, single operator sequencer is working fine, but you expect the sequencer to put the data and the proof on Ethereum. And if something goes wrong, since all the data of the transactions is on Ethereum in a minified way, anybody can actually check if the chains are working fine.
00:09:40.220 - 00:10:20.098, Speaker B: And the moment you find that there is some level of fraud has happened, or the code has been executed in a bad way, in a fraudulent way, then somebody can initiate. This is called fraud proof. And there is a delay of seven days. You do a seven day withdrawal period. That's why when you use optimistic roll up, it needs, it takes seven days for you to withdraw your money back to the main chain. The reason for that is that you need to give enough time for everybody in the community, and you assume that somebody would be watching this, and the moment they find something, some fraud, in that they will raise the fraud proof. That's why you need a seven day withdrawal period.
00:10:20.098 - 00:11:07.394, Speaker B: But if you see, as a technology wise, as I explained, there is a fairly simple technology, all the transactions are happening on L2. You put all the data back on Ethereum, and you put all the proofs back on Ethereum. That's why the costs are also fairly high for optimistic roll ups, because you are putting all the data back on Ethereum, even though it's minified, but you still have to pay. But in case of ZK. What you are doing is ZK is, without going into the details of ZK, what ZK is allowing you to prove a computation that you did just by providing me a kind of a constant size proof, constant size move means that which takes same amount of computation every time for me to verify. So let's say you are that chain, let's say Jason, right? And you executed 100,000 transactions. You don't need to give me the data of those hundred thousand transactions.
00:11:07.394 - 00:11:30.006, Speaker B: You don't, you know, you don't. I don't need to know anything about that. All you need to give, give to me is that here is your ZK proof of all the previous, like, you know that the current state, right, current state to the next state. And you just give me the proof. I verify it on Ethereum. And the moment I verify, I am 100% sure that everything you did, it is correct. So you can already imagine the amount of scale you can achieve right now.
00:11:30.006 - 00:12:08.882, Speaker B: With optimistic roll ups, you have to put all the data back on Ethereum, whereas with ZK rollups, you don't even need to put the data back on ethereum. You can have it off chain. And as far as that data has fair enough data availability guarantees for you, you are fairly sure that this operator cannot cheat with it, because that ZK proof, the mathematical proof is, will not allow. So you can say the trust model is in ZK. It's fully being trusted by maths. In case of optimistic roll ups, you are relying on some sort of socio economic games that somebody from the community might be watching it and will raise the fraud proof. Another problem with that is like the optimistic change.
00:12:08.882 - 00:12:46.908, Speaker B: Let's say you have one chain, it's fine. Like you can assume somebody is running a full node of the chain and which is these are fast chains, right? These produce fast blocks. And running a, running a node for a L2 chain, you know, cost you around, let's say, you know, maybe at least two to 3000 or $5,000 a month roughly, right? If you want to run all the chain to check the check for the fraud, right? So $60,000 a year minimum. I'm saying you want to, you want to run, you need to run a full node. Now imagine you have ten optimistic chains. Now somebody from the community needs to run these ten nodes minimum. And this is the minimum requirement.
00:12:46.908 - 00:13:32.294, Speaker B: Otherwise you are testing that guy only, right? And so it says that's 600k if, let's say this is ten, if it is hundred chains. Now the similarly, the cost goes to $6 million, somebody has to run, or as a community as a whole, has to run $6 million worth of notes to constantly check for those fraud proofs. So hence those socio economic proofs do not scale. Especially for the app chains, they do not scale. Whereas in case of ZK proofs, you can have like millions and millions of chains, you don't care. As far as the chain is, the proof is being submitted to Ethereum. You don't care whether there's a guy who's sitting on a college dorm room and has built a game and you are using that game and you have $500,000 in that game.
00:13:32.294 - 00:14:11.638, Speaker B: You don't, you don't mind that much. And same case, you can think about this app chain thesis, why it did not cosmos. I love Cosmos community, one of my favorite projects in the ecosystem. But then Cosmos app chains do not scale because of this property, only because you have ten chains. One of them has 100 validators, which is fairly secure, but others have five validators. And all of these chains are connected with IBC. So if you are moving $1 million from this five validator chain to the 100 validator chain, you know, the 100 validator chain needs to trust these five validators.
00:14:11.638 - 00:14:31.634, Speaker B: Because if there is a fraudulent, let's say consensus fraud that happened on that five validator chain, now you are stuck with a $1 million, which is a bad value that came to you in case of ZK. If both these chains were sharing ZK proofs with each other, it doesn't happen. And that's what is one of the main thesis behind the Polygon 2.0 as we go along on that.
00:14:31.714 - 00:14:42.402, Speaker A: Got it. So what you're saying is all the governance changes, the tokenomics changes, changing matic to poll, these are all secondary things that are. The goal is to move forward. This Zk EVM network.
00:14:42.458 - 00:15:11.014, Speaker B: Yeah, ZKVM network, which has two key characteristics, as I said, the characteristics. First, infinite scalability. That you can have 1010 thousand chains in this ecosystem for everything works perfectly fine as far as the ZK proof is going back on Ethereum. Second, unified liquidity. Infinite scalability. Unified liquidity. How you unify liquidity is we have this LX Ly bridge, which is which we are going to launch a faster version of that.
00:15:11.014 - 00:16:11.994, Speaker B: All these chains, liquidity is connected into one single bridge. So you can move your funds from one chain to another without going to Ethereum right now, this kind of interoperability, you will get in, let's say every 30 minutes, but then very soon you will have a fast aggregator layer, which we call the aggregator layer currently or interop layer where each chain can actually push their proof every 10 seconds. And every ten second, once the chain has pushed the ZK proof on this aggregator layer, every other chain can simply observe the ZK proof and allow any kind of incoming or outgoing transaction value coming to and fro from this chain. So all these chains become interoperable at a time scale of like two to 10 seconds. And if you see, if you want to see like that, let's say I am on a gaming chain and I want to swap my game tokens against USDC on Polygon ZkevM. So I do a transaction. This game chain submits a proof in 10 seconds.
00:16:11.994 - 00:16:50.982, Speaker B: The moment this proof is submitted in 10 seconds, the other chain, let's say ZKevM now knows that this particular proof has come in from this chain. And any cross chain transaction I am sending ZKVM chain knows that, okay, this transaction is legit, is kosher. And you know, I do the swap and then now the ZK proof, ZK chain submits the proof in 10 seconds. And now if I have a USDC going back to the gaming chain, the gaming chain knows that ZKVM has executed correctly and it allows me to get my USDC back. So in 2020, 5 seconds, you get, you are, you are on a different chain. You don't have to bridge and all that stuff. You just do a single trustless transaction, one or two trustless transactions and you are done.
00:16:50.982 - 00:17:44.796, Speaker B: That is the kind of, so what it starts doing is all these chains then start feeling like one single block space. And this whole block space can have now millions and millions in DP's, let's say, I mean millions in TPS over the time as these things scale. And if you actually look back, you will see the Internet has also scaled in the same way. And from the Polygon side, we are not here to create a project which happens in crypto cycles that you have a project and for one cycle it's great and all that. No, we are very clear that we want to become, as I have also said, that we want to become top three players or top three projects in the space. BTC, Ethereum, they have had a big impact on the, on the world and we want to be the third project after them. Or like join a list of these projects which have that level of impact.
00:17:44.796 - 00:17:50.340, Speaker B: That's the goal of polygon and there is absolutely no compromise on that.
00:17:50.452 - 00:18:26.160, Speaker A: So Sandeep, extend this vision out like more than just one year. Like if I'm trying to get inside your brain for a second and like think about your maybe five year vision or something, I feel like where you're going with this is your vision of the world. Might be you have this Zk tech that basically makes it possible to prove a wild variety of things. Like maybe you could have cosmos chains on polygon or optimistic roll ups. Let's say someone does decide to do optimistic roll ups, they could still build on polygon, right? Or absolutely. Starbucks wants to build and Uniswap wants to build and guy in a college dorm room wants to build. This all happens on polygons.
00:18:26.160 - 00:18:28.412, Speaker A: That that's your longer term vision.
00:18:28.508 - 00:19:00.966, Speaker B: Our goal is that you have this block space, which is basically, essentially everybody's trying to create trustless competition. I think that blockchains, the trustless competition is actually a much bigger phenomena. We all think when we talk about blockchain, we talk about decentralization, but actually it's not the right thing. Decentralization is a means to achieve trustless competition. Now with bitcoin, that trust less competition is payments. Ethereum, that trustless competition is any kind of generic program. So we all are trying to create this trustless competition environment.
00:19:00.966 - 00:19:38.010, Speaker B: And as polygons. To answer your question very specifically, that what we are looking for is that imagine in five years from now, you have 1020 or tens of thousands of chains, 10, 20, 30,000 chains, which are all like, you know, which can be layer ones, which have their own tokens, which are validiums, roll ups. You can define them in two big categories, validiums and roll ups. Roll ups means you are putting your data also back on Ethereum. And validiums means you can, you are, you can, you are having your data off chain. So you can be a layer one. Nobody cares, right? You know, you can be a layer one having data on your side.
00:19:38.010 - 00:20:05.784, Speaker B: But you are still proving back on Ethereum. So there is one single. The baseline of security for everyone is the moment you receive a proof of a chain on Ethereum. You know that, that execution till now is perfectly, it has been done perfectly. There's no fraud. So in five year old, five, five year long goal would be that you have these tens of thousands of chains. All of them connect back into Ethereum, settle back into Ethereum using these DK proofs.
00:20:05.784 - 00:20:24.170, Speaker B: And there is cross chain interconnectivity, you know, possible with them. And this is also infinitely scalable. Like, you know, from 20,000 it could go to hundred thousand chains. It can go to 500,000 chains. This architecture that at Polygon 2.0 that we have proposed, it will still scale. So that's the main one.
00:20:24.170 - 00:20:56.234, Speaker B: And if you ask, like, some of the researchers in the space, they would tell you that this is probably like, you know, very bold, but also one of the most practical, you know, architectures, which, whether it's polygon or somebody else, but whatever comes out of this would look very similar to this. When somebody, when a protocol comes out or a project which becomes the mainstream web3 or become aws of web3, everybody is using them, they will have something similar in their architecture.
00:20:56.314 - 00:21:04.786, Speaker A: Yeah. What you're really implying is this isn't just the end game for Polygon, but you think this is the end state for what infrastructure should look like.
00:21:04.850 - 00:21:05.734, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:21:07.714 - 00:21:13.396, Speaker A: I would describe polygon as a side chain. I think maybe is the word to use right now. And you're moving.
00:21:13.580 - 00:21:33.540, Speaker B: That's, that's our biggest branding problem, that Polygon PoS, until the time we recently announced that Polygon Pos will be upgraded to ZK. Till the time we upgraded to that, like, you know, Polygon branding will have this problem. Like, people think Polygon Pos is a site where Polygon Pos is a side chain. But Polygon ZKVM, for example, is a full blown L2. It is as L2 as it gets.
00:21:33.612 - 00:21:44.640, Speaker A: Okay, true. So. But like. But you keep. So, okay, so then why. So you're moving to the ZkevM validium. This is where some of the technicalities go beyond me.
00:21:44.640 - 00:21:57.680, Speaker A: But would you ever think about going, becoming a full scale, like a full scale roll up to the way I understand, like a full, like a full scale roll up versus validium is. There's slight differences there, like you were just explaining. Yeah, yeah.
00:21:57.752 - 00:22:23.946, Speaker B: So Polygon PoS will always remain a validum because it has its own validators which are storing the data. But the ZK proofs are implemented. It is putting a data, it is putting the ZK proofs back on Ethereum till that time, currently. So, okay, let me explain it. Polygon Pos is a side chain. It has its own validators. It just puts a checkpoint back on Ethereum for the current state of the chain.
00:22:23.946 - 00:22:55.006, Speaker B: Once the ZK proof plugs back into the polygon Pos chain, because the data is still managed by the validators, Polygon Pos becomes a validium. Right. But polygon ZKE EVM is a separate chain which puts both the data and the proof back on Ethereum. So that's a full blown roll up. So the polygon 2.0 architecture, which is a multi chain architecture, it will have validiums, it will have roll ups. Who knows? Like, as you said, like it might have cosmos chains, which are.
00:22:55.006 - 00:23:02.030, Speaker B: It might have some layer ones which are proving back on Ethereum. So that's, that's, that, that's what it's about.
00:23:02.142 - 00:23:08.022, Speaker A: Got it. One last question on this. Then we can move past it. Right? Now you have how many validators? You have like 100 validators or something?
00:23:08.078 - 00:23:08.270, Speaker B: Yes.
00:23:08.302 - 00:23:11.206, Speaker A: And they, they control the bridge back to Ethereum.
00:23:11.350 - 00:23:11.718, Speaker B: Yes.
00:23:11.766 - 00:23:14.206, Speaker A: That, that will change with this, right.
00:23:14.350 - 00:23:55.328, Speaker B: That will become trustless. Then the validators don't control the bridge, they just control the sequencing of the transaction. And why that is also important is that things think about like, you know, the current layer, L2s that are there. Like, you know, which includes polygon ZKVM, includes arbitrum, includes optimism. Why? Like, you know, I think we, you know, the Ethereum community has not discussed that much because, you know, we try to follow the narratives. But actually if you have a single sequencer chain and which is, which is, let's say very big in Defi, right, for example, base chain. Now imagine on that base chain, or I am polygon ZKVM, or let's say I'm arbitrum or optimism.
00:23:55.328 - 00:24:33.960, Speaker B: And there is a high volatility period in the market where there is 100 million loan from my team only. Let's say whoever is running the sequencer, sequencer has 100 million loan on Aave, which can get liquidated because of the volatility period. And now there is an incoming transaction from an oracle, which is changing the price, which is like updating the price. I can simply for that, like, you know, the blip where the wick goes below and then comes back. I can simply sense of the oracle transaction at that point in time. So then my loans are not liquidated and then bring it back. So for the Defi chains, eventually all these layer ones, for now it's okay.
00:24:33.960 - 00:25:06.784, Speaker B: People are trusting the sequencer team or the project team that they are running it. Okay. But eventually for DeFi at least, if a chain wants to be L2 chain wants to be defi chain, they need to be decentralized so that if one sequencer is not accepting Oracle's transaction in next second or 2 seconds later on other one will accept that. So with Polygon POS, I think that it will become the first L2 which is fully decentralized. Once it gets updated, hopefully, like, you know, it becomes first. But maybe by that time, some other L2 also is able to launch something decentralized sequencing.
00:25:07.684 - 00:25:41.456, Speaker A: Who do you think of as your, like, if I were sitting in your shoes, think about my competitive set. I'd probably put it in three buckets. There's like, there's optimism in arbitrum. Then there's probably like Coinbase, there's like base, right? And then there's these like ZKs that, you know, talk about the tech, have like supposedly really good technology, but maybe haven't gone to mainnet yet. Even, and, you know, maybe 2024, even 2025 will be the big years for them. That's kind of like how I would, how I would see the three competitor buckets. I'm curious if you see it like that and maybe who you think of as like your main competitor there.
00:25:41.640 - 00:26:42.250, Speaker B: Yeah. So see, from the Ethereum community then, in Ethereum community right now, we are like, you know, everybody is such an, everybody is at such an early stage that, you know, thinking that on Ethereum community, we try to at least like, you know, maintain that mindset that anybody who's scaling Ethereum is fine, like we are also. But if you ask me, the competitors, I would say anybody who's providing trustless computation is a competitor to each other, right? So because the target addressable market is the same, like everybody who's looking to build either in Defi, other gaming or whatever they are trying to build, that's why I said trustless computation is a much bigger phenomena then, you know, this decentralized blockchain that we are talking about. And anybody who's building that trustless computation engine is, in a way, is a competition competitor. So, ZK, optimistic roll ups, maybe, you know, some other approaches that might come up, they, you know, in a way are competing with each other.
00:26:42.362 - 00:27:00.174, Speaker A: So if I'm a founder listening, let's say I'm a founder listening to this, I've just raised my seed round and I'm looking to maybe, I don't know, I'm playing dabbling and I'm trying to figure out if I should build on base, I should build on optimism. Arbitrum polygon scroll how do I, how do I make that decision?
00:27:00.474 - 00:28:04.974, Speaker B: Yeah, so if it, like, it depends on so many things. Like if you are a long term, long term founder, like you are building an application and you believe that this will be a big application in five to ten years, then you have to see, I actually look for two, three things. Like I would look for the users maximum integrations, like which, which particular chain has maximum integrations into various exchanges and various liquidity providers. On ramp off ram. Which chains have better? If I'm building defi, for example, which has more liquidity? If I'm building a gaming application, which chain has more of these gaming communities where I can get the early users and things like that? But then in the short run as a founder, many people also look for novelty factor, for example, because in this market, like all people, reward is some sort of novelty. So right now, maybe base chain is a good example. Good, good option where like for the first two, three applications, five applications, who will launch there? They will have this novelty factor.
00:28:04.974 - 00:28:43.308, Speaker B: Once those have launched, then, you know, it kind of goes away. Same will be applicable to any other chain which are doing the airdrops, like upcoming airdrops. For example, arbitrum had a massive airdrop and, you know, that kind of incubated a lot of projects in their ecosystem. So similarly, that, that will, that I feel that will happen for scroll and other things also. And maybe, you know, if Polygon is launching some other, you know, layer tools and things like that, maybe their novelty factor would be there. So those kind of things, but depends on like, if you are building defi, you would, you would want to choose for liquidity. If you are building gaming, you would want to choose for distribution to gaming.
00:28:43.308 - 00:28:50.024, Speaker B: If you are building something like social and all that, you would want to have, you know, distribution to normal, like crowd.
00:28:51.444 - 00:29:28.686, Speaker A: All right, everyone wanted to talk about vouch again, our favorite insurance provider for crypto companies. If you are building in crypto, you have probably come to realize that contracts need insurance. Partners demand insurance. And as a founder myself, trust me when I say you owe it to not only yourself, but your investors and your clients and your customers. And I'm not just talking about any insurance. Their exclusive coverages are tailored specifically for crypto companies that can address issues like protections for regulatory defense, recognizing daos as insured, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities, and even covering the loss of digital assets. They're in it with you.
00:29:28.686 - 00:30:00.444, Speaker A: Whether you're working on l one s, l two s, dows, MPC wallet providers, building a protocol, and a lot more. So whether you're just scribbling your next big idea on a napkin or gearing up for a big fundraiser, maybe thinking about that IPO or an acquisition, don't leave things to chance. Get insured today with 5% off vouchs. Exclusive coverage for empire listeners using code Empire. Think about it this way. With vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind, everyone. We'll get back to Empire in just a minute.
00:30:00.444 - 00:30:30.778, Speaker A: But before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bank lists put on together. It is the biggest, best defi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:30:30.778 - 00:30:54.606, Speaker A: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff. That will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off.
00:30:54.606 - 00:31:11.912, Speaker A: If you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes.
00:31:11.912 - 00:31:24.964, Speaker A: Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up. Let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there. You want to talk about tokenomics or governance?
00:31:26.864 - 00:32:30.854, Speaker B: I can talk about tokenomics also first, because, you know, like, this is a question from many people that, you know, we actually, when we rebranded from Matic network to Polygon, at that point only we had said that, you know, this is due on us, that, you know, we need to upgrade the Matic token, which was a single token, single chain or token chain or single chain token. This will migrate into this multi chain environment where multi chain, you know, tokens are there. So I think on that front, you know, what we have built is basically, we believe that this pole token is upgradation of matic. And that upgradation allows it to become multi chain, right. And also allows it to, you know, kind of serve this whole, you know, multiple chain, you know, environment. Like when I. What I mean to say is that previously, like, I think, and that's why we call it a third generation token.
00:32:30.854 - 00:33:07.798, Speaker B: Because if you see the first generation token BTC, with BTC as a holder, you have no way of holding BTC. And with that contributing into the, contributing into the network, like, you cannot stake that network. You can't. You need to have miners like you know, which are, which is separate stuff, separate setup to contribute into BTC. Then came Ethereum, especially after the merge. Now, if you are a ethereum holder, you can participate in the network for securing the network. And then Polygon kind of tokens will be these third generation tokens where you can actually secure multiple chains in your ecosystem.
00:33:07.798 - 00:34:06.370, Speaker B: So not only you can validate and earn rewards transaction fees from one chain, you can earn transaction fees from multiple chains. And the second part is that you can also play multiple roles in polygon ecosystem. You can be a validator or a sequencer, you can actually be a prover, you can actually become a data availability provider. And you can also be an aggregator of these proofs. And we expect that to, for running this whole large trustless ecosystem, this will generate a lot of transaction fees. And that will go to the people who are for the polls takers, which will be running these chains and different kind of services. So you can also think that polio has kind of like, as popularized by Eigen layer, like restaking, but we call it like multi staking, like, you know, because Eigen layer restaking is built on top of Ethereum protocol, whereas this multi staking mechanism is built in protocol, in Polygon.
00:34:06.370 - 00:34:11.066, Speaker B: So you stake a stake once and then now you just can subscribe to multiple chains.
00:34:11.130 - 00:34:14.474, Speaker A: Let's become a validator for multiple polygon chains. Yeah.
00:34:14.514 - 00:34:33.274, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, if you want. So if, let's say you are a validator node, Jason, then you can say that, okay, this new chain is coming up and this is run by, let's say, based, like base is being run by Coinbase exchange. Let's say some other exchange is running. And you would say, okay, I would like to be a validator on this chain. And then you, you pick and choose that chain, that kind of stuff.
00:34:34.774 - 00:34:57.198, Speaker A: And the other thing it does that I don't think you just mentioned, is it, um. So you guys have this 10 billion supply cap right on Matic, which is now going to become pol. You guys are switching to an inflationary model, right? I think this is to incentivize validator participation and then probably also just continue funding the treasury in maybe a better way. But what's the rationale behind that?
00:34:57.286 - 00:35:46.898, Speaker B: Yes, yes. So as I said, that the matic is moving from a single chain token to a multi chain token. So we need to have initial validator incentives which can actually incentivize people to run and validate multiple of these chains. So which means, what it means is that in that case, you know, we have, we have provision for 1% of, you know, addition of this fees every year, 1% every year, which is less than, let's say, I think bitcoin is 1.8%. Ethereum is also, you know, minting is, but Ethereum also has burning mechanism, but I think it's more than 1.52% or something like that. So it's very like kind of a low but base security, you know, rewards for the validators.
00:35:46.898 - 00:36:46.914, Speaker B: Like you know, we all discussed that if BTC, if the rewards keeps going down with every habitat, what incentive for the validators to minus run that. So that, that is one part. Then secondly, we have also provisioned for a limited amount of time from, for five to ten years to have 1% of the treasury in Pol token, which can be used to further grow the ecosystem. And the reason for that is that you see that every other quarter, actually some new L2 token is launching with a fresh treasury. And what happens is that all these like for example, arbitrum optimism when they launched the markets assign them a value based on keeping, lets say matic token originally when it was the only kind of L2 protocol available, the kind of assigns a value around that, right, like in the market cap. And now you have other L2s like arbitrage and optimism being there. The third one, whatever protocol will launch their new token.
00:36:46.914 - 00:37:33.622, Speaker B: They will also get assigned somewhere there. And those protocols have from day zero, then billions of dollars in treasury. So it kind of puts the treasury or polygon ecosystem at a kind of a handicap where other ecosystems have much more money to incentivize and grow the chains, grow their kind of ecosystem. So that's why we kind of provision 1% per year for next ten years and the community can decide like if it needs to be 2% for the first two years and then one 1% for next six years or 2% for five years. All that is flexible. But the point being that the treasury or the community needs to agree that, okay, we need to have till the time in next three to five years when these infrastructure wars are going on. Polygon is not handicapped.
00:37:33.622 - 00:38:17.408, Speaker B: Polygon community ecosystem is not handicapped to keep acquiring more and more developers to it, because no other protocol can also kind of, you know, spend more than one 1.5% of their treasury legitimately if they don't want to experience a huge amount of, you know, sell pressure into the markets. So kind of, it kind of puts polygon at par with other chains, especially who are launching with the new token. Because Polygon is like four years old token, 90% of its supply is out and all those things. So the ecosystem needs a way to sustain and secure and keep growing. On the distribution and adoption front, on.
00:38:17.416 - 00:38:34.536, Speaker A: The governance side, we can talk about it quickly. It seems like you guys are basically breaking into three main governance pillars, which is protocol governance, system, smart contracts governance, and community treasury governance. Why is. Why is this the. I'm curious, like, what learnings in the last couple of years led to this kind of three pillar model?
00:38:34.720 - 00:39:05.804, Speaker B: Yes. So see, like, the one is the protocol governance, right. If you see Ethereum and bitcoin, they are not their core protocol. And client development and core things are not. Not governed by the. By the community. Ethereum, for example, has a core devs group where everybody can join, anybody can join, they can raise their opinions, and there is a rough consensus off chain that happens, and then people upgrade the clients and other validators also have to upgrade the client.
00:39:05.804 - 00:40:06.474, Speaker B: That's the way these are governed. So some of the parts of those kind of protocols, we don't think. I think bitcoin and Ethereum have proven to have a very good model, and we don't need. You don't need community governance on that. Like, we are the token holders which have no understanding of those hardcore technology details because we want to be real with the governance. Like, we don't want to call it governance for the sake of calling it governance and asking all the people to vote on things where most of the people have, you know, don't have much understanding, then you have the protocol smart contract governance, which are the smart contracts which are being, you know, like all these L2 smart contracts where, you know, they have the bridge contract and all those things. So there, the community, if there are any kind of further, any kind of upgrades that are coming, coming in, we can actually take the vote from the community or put a times a time, you know, as they call like a time delay into that time lag.
00:40:06.474 - 00:40:40.284, Speaker B: And, you know, with that, any kind of upgrade is coming, is going. It has a, let's say seven to 30 days period where community can review and say, okay, this change is going in. This affects the security. Everybody take out their money and all that, right? So that's a governance mechanism. So, you know, no change can go immediately. But for the state of L2, as you see, like, these are smart contracts. Every other day, defi smart contracts get hacked and all that and those kind of things with those kind of contracts, you know, nobody can tell in advance.
00:40:40.284 - 00:41:05.428, Speaker B: So you. We also have a, we also will and all the L2s have this security emergency upgrade community or security committee. All the L2s have, like in the past you must have seen that Polygon Pos. A lot of people said that, oh, this is a multi seq and all that. It's just that we did not brand it more fancy. Like all the, all L2s, big, small, supported by Vitalik, whoever it is. Everybody has that security committee.
00:41:05.428 - 00:41:10.564, Speaker B: But again, it's the power of narratives in crypto and you know, people kind of, you know, people who.
00:41:10.644 - 00:41:15.476, Speaker A: You guys have had a couple of those narratives go against you. Like the side chain narrative. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:41:15.500 - 00:41:48.668, Speaker B: It's the same thing. Like, you know, right now for example, like the, like, I mean, again, you know, we don't want to like call that all those things out. But actually if you see optimism without the fraud proofs or base chain, for example, without the fraud proofs and they are single server side chain, at least in our case, there are hundred validators on that side chain. These are single server side chains. Right? So, but, but again, like no, no shit towards optimism and base chain. Like they are, they have been trying to build their part, right? Like whatever. We were also trying to build our plasma part.
00:41:48.668 - 00:42:26.124, Speaker B: But then obviously when you have, you know, teams from the Silicon Valley and supported by large VC's and all that, it's easier to form those narratives and, you know, kind of bypass. Imagine if Polygon had done something like that. You also are remembering some of those narratives going against. If we had done something like that. Let's say we launched our ZK proof without the proofs and say that ZK proofs will come later on. Like we will be killed out there, right? So you know, that's the advantage of being from the Silicon Valley and maybe us and all that and having the support of a lot of institutional investors and things like that. But that's perfectly fine.
00:42:26.124 - 00:43:19.684, Speaker B: What I was saying is that, yes, coming back to the governance, that the smart contract governance community can also be. Community vote can also be taken. But mostly it will be actually the time lags that will be implemented and community will have the way to review, but this will be off chain governance. And then there is this third part of governance which is the community treasury and all that there. Again, we want to involve community on like right now. Till now you must have seen that Polygon labs and some of the, you know, other other parties in the system or in the ecosystem, they are actually doing a lot of bd work and things like that. Now with this strategy, we want more and more community to be involved, how they will be involved, as per the compliance structures of us and all that, because the regulation on daos also keeps on increasing, keeps on growing.
00:43:19.684 - 00:43:41.504, Speaker B: And I think largely everybody understands that if you have a pool of money which is controlled by token holders, that's not considered very this thing. But we have to find out a way where the community is fully involved in taking some of these decisions, growing the ecosystem, and, you know, we are able to do it in a very, very compliant way.
00:43:41.584 - 00:43:47.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Sandeep, anything else on Polygon 2.0? Because I want to move to another topic unless there's anything else.
00:43:47.952 - 00:43:57.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I think like we discussed most of the part, like, you know. Yeah, we discussed that infinite scalability and unified liquidity with that aggregated layer. I think we discussed most of it.
00:43:58.894 - 00:44:41.530, Speaker A: The other thing that I think people know polygon for are these big bd deals. Right? Like who are some of them? Starbucks meta stripe, Adobe adidas Draftkings, like some Reddit, some of those big names. I'm curious, I was looking at the TVL on Polygon, and it doesn't come from Starbucks, no surprise. And Nike and folks like that. It's aave three, it's aave two, it's uniswap v three, it's curve, it's balancer compound, et cetera. It's the name that kind of you would expect. So I'm curious, looking back like a year and two years later on some of these deals, what are your learnings? Maybe the pros of doing these deals and then the unexpected negative downsides of doing these deals.
00:44:41.602 - 00:44:57.754, Speaker B: Absolutely. So again, this is one more part where Polygon is stuck with kind of narrative. Let me ask you this question. For a proof of stake protocol, what do you think is more important? Like TVL or the transaction fees generated on the network?
00:44:58.214 - 00:45:00.734, Speaker A: The transaction fees on the network, exactly right.
00:45:00.774 - 00:45:20.472, Speaker B: Because TVL has no, like, TVL matrix, as a matrix is just a leading indicator that this chain must have a lot of. But imagine if I, if we have an Instagram chain or Instagram on our chain, and Instagram is generating $10 million of transaction fees, that transaction fees is going to the protocol token.
00:45:20.598 - 00:45:24.516, Speaker A: Right. The transaction fees are ten times more important. No, I agree with that.
00:45:24.620 - 00:45:50.334, Speaker B: Exactly. All these deals. Now. Now if you want to open, let's say crypto slam. Open crypto slam and go to 30 day view on that and check that as per 30 days, which are the top, what is the top protocol there by volumes. I'm saying, like, you know, I mean, I don't want to actually, you know, say this part, but I'm just saying on the volumes by this one, like, check the top three.
00:45:50.874 - 00:46:05.394, Speaker A: What D. Market board, Apiac club draft kings, DraftKings. I see what you're saying. Oh, 680,000 transactions, 30 days, up 113%. 14,000 Buyers. I get, I see what you're getting at.
00:46:05.514 - 00:46:11.834, Speaker B: So basically. And now check, like, you know, just Google, like, Reddit. Number of, number of nfts on Reddit.
00:46:11.954 - 00:46:12.306, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:12.370 - 00:46:50.758, Speaker B: There are 16 million nfts that have been generated by Reddit holders with a on chain non custody wallet, which, and the chain, these nfts are minted on chain. So 16 million transactions were done by Reddit, which actually would have given easily, I think, a revenue of roughly 250 to polygon validators. That is the part that should be like. But only problem is that we only care about the speculative use case. Like Nike Swoosh, for example. Check Nike Swoosh, what Nike Swoosh is doing. Just later on, you can google how many holders they have.
00:46:50.758 - 00:46:51.582, Speaker B: I know, I saw it.
00:46:51.598 - 00:46:55.270, Speaker A: I'm in a, I'm in a group chat with some of the Nike crypto. I mean, yeah, third.
00:46:55.462 - 00:48:00.870, Speaker B: Right. So what I'm trying to say here is that because the whole narrative, and again, it needs, we don't have that narrative power in the, you know, on Twitter, because we don't have, like, those influential investors who can actually talk, and then it becomes narrative. Right. If we say nobody, you know, people say, okay, we are saying. But basically, what I mean to say here is that lens protocol, for example, many of these protocols might not have a lot of value trading on the chain, but they will be generating a lot of transaction fees, which is the most important part for polygon. But also, I would also say that that value is definitely the leading indicator of how much activity is there on the chain. And I would say if you go to the TVL also, even though Polygon has not done any sort of liquidity incentives for last two years, you still see, like, polygon after, like, in the ethereum ecosystem, it's polygon arbitrum, and then, you know, Ethereum, arbitram and polygon.
00:48:00.870 - 00:48:32.764, Speaker B: That's the number three. And that also arbitram recently, like, in the last four, five, six months, they came up because of the, like, like, you know, obviously they have a great community, but also airdrop. And whatnot so what I mean to say there is that there is a lot of, you know, traction there, you know, and you should also like one more thing like Jason, I would say that if you go to the main page of this crypto slam. If you go scroll up and just go to the main page. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here. Yes.
00:48:32.764 - 00:48:50.508, Speaker B: The home page. Just click on crypto slam logo. Yeah, just click on crypto slam logo. Oh, and then go to the chains. Basic. Basically there is a, you know, on the top you have rankings. Rankings and chains, blockchain rankings.
00:48:50.508 - 00:48:56.348, Speaker B: And then you do 30 days, basically just do a 30 day average of that. You see where polygon is.
00:48:56.436 - 00:49:02.672, Speaker A: Yeah. And listening, you've got a theorems number one and polygons number two. Then it goes Solana method.
00:49:02.728 - 00:49:45.832, Speaker B: And you know, like, actually you, one could argue that Solana had like, I think in the recent times, like only nfts going on over there, right? And then Polygon community actually, like, you know, in the NFTs started like six, eight months back last year, November, December. And you know, a lot of projects are doing well and projects are doing well over there. And it's claimed, and you already must have seen on the defi side. So on the Defi side, also TVL wise, after Ethereum arbitrum, it's polygon. So see, NFTs rank two, Defi rank three in ethereum ecosystem. Gaming. Gaming, you know, I don't even know like how many people know about gaming because gaming, nothing in gaming has actually exploded.
00:49:45.832 - 00:50:17.734, Speaker B: But in terms of the games building on polygon, especially with the immutable x, which is the, which used to be like the, you know, number of, they have like 150 to 200 games building on them. They completely migrating over to Polygon. You know, Polygon is like probably from the rank two, it will be easily around one to two orders of magnitude. Like orders of magnitude. I'm not saying two x, three x, I'm saying minimum ten x and up to, you know, like 90%, 90 x. Also from. Because the rest 10%, I think Polygon has like 80% to 90% of that market.
00:50:17.734 - 00:50:47.334, Speaker B: And 10% is distributed between like various layer one, L2s and things like, like that. Very little gaming on that. And most of these games, there is also this interesting stat maybe I can share with you later on, which says that in 2022, there was around 1.4 billion, $1.5 billion of funding in the, or $2.2 billion of funding in the web3 gaming space. And if you consolidate the numbers and extrapolate them, you will realize that around 80% to 90% is polygon.
00:50:47.334 - 00:51:05.146, Speaker B: And IMX, you know, ecosystems and polygon alone is like, you know, around Ethereum. So if you see, like, multiple and brands. The fourth segment I was talking about Defi rank three, NFT rank two. Gaming, absolutely rank one. Like, there's no even. Not even second on that brands. No second in that all.
00:51:05.146 - 00:51:18.454, Speaker B: Most of the brands are polygon. So if you see in terms of adoption, like, we are actually very focused. And I told you the why of Polygon is only about adoption. Like, we don't. We believe. We. I should not say we don't care about the narratives.
00:51:18.454 - 00:51:30.550, Speaker B: We believe that eventually these narratives will subside, will matter. But right now, all the money in crypto space is basically on social layer. There's nobody cares about this.
00:51:30.622 - 00:51:46.586, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Yeah. What do you think of decentralized social, like lens and farcaster and what's happening on Friendtech? I'm curious. What is this? A. I know you're very bullish on gaming. Is social something you're excited about or. Not really, no, I am.
00:51:46.650 - 00:52:30.016, Speaker B: I am excited about the social side, where I feel that there is something there, but not like this. I mean, whatever gets popular or viral, actually, if you see that, and that's the whole kind of, what I say, misfortune or unfortunate. That is very unfortunate for the industry that even now, any use case that becomes viral, that has some speculative angle to it. Right. So, you know, like, where people are trading these things and all that. Like, I don't think, like, social with only these games will become really big. You need to have, like, some fundamental value being delivered to the users.
00:52:30.016 - 00:52:59.864, Speaker B: On top of that, like, of course there is native money. You can add some of the things. So I feel social to become really, really mainstream. Crypto social to become really mainstream. We are some years away from that. I am very bullish on lens protocol, for example. Obviously, I am biased because they are built on Polygon, but I think Stani knows he is actually building an ecosystem around it instead of himself building few apps so it can slowly, slowly, slowly can start getting network effects.
00:52:59.864 - 00:53:04.504, Speaker B: The thing with these things is once they go viral, they really go viral.
00:53:05.964 - 00:53:26.984, Speaker A: Yeah. Agreed. As we think about wrapping it up, Sandeep, I just want to zoom all the way out. I have almost a non crypto question for you, which is if, let's say you were in a room, let's say you're in a room with maybe 500 institutional investors and execs from fortune. Five hundred s and stuff. And none of them really understood crypto. And they, they asked you this one question.
00:53:26.984 - 00:53:35.640, Speaker A: They said, sandeep, can you explain to me the business model of Polygon? And they don't know crypto. How do you, how do you think about explaining that to them?
00:53:35.792 - 00:53:58.578, Speaker B: Yes. So when you say business model of Polygon is the business model of protocol, not the polygon. There is no Polygon Labs is a company and it is also non profit. It does not generate profit, right? It's a part of the foundation only. So there is no profit that comes to this. What happens is that you are building a protocol where both demand and supply is outside of you. Demand is demand.
00:53:58.578 - 00:55:11.982, Speaker B: What is the demand for? Demand is for trustless computation. Whether you are doing in a decentralized way or you are doing in a single sequencer way, that you are just providing trustless compute. And you have these third party developers who are on the demand side, who will be using these services and they will be paying transaction fees for various parts of the network, who will get this transaction fees. That is the supply side. And that also is outside, like where you expect the community and the whole, like, you know, people from the whole world to join this and join this protocol and run various different kind of nodes or services, which, which will be served to these demand side people who are looking for trustless compute. And in this between whatever transaction fees is being generated, that goes to the supply side people, that is people who are running the nodes. Now, how does it connect to the overall, let's say, token ecosystem or whatever? For example, in case of ethereum, how does it connect to the value of ethereum? Is that all these, or in case of polygon, also, all these validators, they stake, they have to, because they have to provide these services, there needs to be some way for them to act or their incentives to be aligned in the direction of working positively towards the network.
00:55:11.982 - 00:56:03.842, Speaker B: So they stake these tokens and these tokens stake tokens, determine how much gas fees or how much part of the transaction fees they take. The larger number, amount of demand here, which is generating larger amount of transaction fees in the network, the more your validators of your token holders who are becoming your validators, they are going to generate that fees. And ideally, if that fees, let's say today, if 5% is a US fed rate, if today your network is generating $100 million in transaction fees. So ideally your token should be valued minimum 20 billion. If 100% of that is staked, minimum $2 billion, because that's like 100 million is 5% of that fee. So people are staking that amount of capital to earn that 5% yield yearly on that. So that should actually how it relates to this.
00:56:03.842 - 00:56:24.564, Speaker B: And then some of the tokens are owned by all the projects, treasuries and all that. And they have to use it till the time the projects, you know, reach, reach and escape velocity. And from there, the foundation also can dismantle itself. The project becomes ossified. It goes. That's how, like, there's no business model for these. Like, there's no money making for the teams who are building it.
00:56:24.564 - 00:56:33.064, Speaker B: All their incentive is in those tokens, actually, that if those tokens appreciate in value, probably, you know, the, the founders will also get something, right?
00:56:33.764 - 00:56:37.268, Speaker A: I hope you would get something, Sandeep, if you guys, if you guys accomplish.
00:56:37.316 - 00:56:40.234, Speaker B: This, it's a long.
00:56:41.494 - 00:56:59.634, Speaker A: The last question I had for you is, so Mike and I spend a lot of time thinking about just getting inspiration from other businesses outside of crypto. Right. Whether that's Bloomberg or other media companies or data platforms or whoever it may be. I'm curious if there are businesses outside of crypto that you look to for inspiration.
00:57:01.334 - 00:58:10.214, Speaker B: Outside of crypto businesses. I think, like, you know, off late, what I, what I see is, like, crypto is so speculative in nature, right? Like, you know, I actually have started appreciating the normal traditional business model where, you know, people have, like, you know, you put input capital and you build something around it. Like, you build a factory, you build something and then, you know, you are generating revenue out of it and hope that revenue minus cost is, you know, is positive. I appreciate those models also, because there's, like, so much of speculation in crypto, and we are trying to build this decentralized, you know, ecosystem where community participates and, you know, everybody participates. But then the thing is, there are very, very small part of our community is interested in things which are not speculation, so, which is like, kind of a hard and unfortunate part of, you know, our thing. And I think we need to do well on that because let's say in five years from now, you still have to invite people like me who are building infrastructure for these podcasts. That means we have failed as a collective.
00:58:10.214 - 00:58:11.502, Speaker B: You should be inviting apps.
00:58:11.598 - 00:58:14.358, Speaker A: Need the apps and the consumer things. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree.
00:58:14.446 - 00:58:21.478, Speaker B: So anything, all. Anything more like, you know, you want to ask from me, controversial and all that, that would be more fun.
00:58:21.606 - 00:58:35.200, Speaker A: No, no. I think this is a good overview of Polygon 2.0. Good shout out. Kind of the l two wars, infrastructure wars that are going on interested in getting your take on some of these like BD deals and. Yeah, man, great conversation.
00:58:35.312 - 00:59:21.574, Speaker B: No, and one more thing. I think this thing is that we have also launched this Polygon CDK, which is basically the consolidation of all the Polygon technology which can be used to run your own chains. Like run your own ZK chains. Like this has been already there a lot of players like IMX and IDEX and, you know, so many applications and so many palm network and all that they have announced that they are building their ZK chains using this. But, you know, for us, we had to, we wanted to bundle it into one single package. So Polygon CDK would love people to check that out, especially the founders to check that out. Like you can build your own ZK chains, which can be completely sovereign.
00:59:21.574 - 00:59:54.746, Speaker B: You can have like, you know, ZK proofs which provides you like five to ten minutes or half an hour, you know, maximum half an hour movement to and fruit movement of the funds. Liquidity from ethereum to. From ethereum to your chain, which is not possible with optimistic roll up chains. For example, you have a seven day withdrawal period. And for the larger chains, they can have these fast withdrawal services. But for app chains, like, you know, it will be very, very hard for you to provide fast withdrawal services. So that's a very big advantage in that, in that mode.
00:59:54.746 - 01:00:28.394, Speaker B: So no seven day withdrawal period. And second part is that these are future proof. ZK chains are definitely like more future proof. And more and more scalability is coming to that because provers are like polygon provers, for example, are very, very efficient. So it's like hardly any cost for you. So I definitely recommend founders who are looking to launch their own app chains do look at the ZK technology, because technology is fairly mature for you to launch your main nets with that. And also, this is the only path that will provide you interconnectivity, like using the Polygon aggregate layer.
01:00:28.394 - 01:01:00.290, Speaker B: Also it provides you the interconnectivity or liquidity aggregation or seamless movement of liquidity across chains. So if you launch with this, let's say with Polygon network, your liquidity or your chains, liquidity is connected across multiple chains, so people can move to and fro without even coming to Ethereum, their funds. And in future, as I explained at the start of the podcast, that, you know, you would be able to have cross chain transactions in a matter of like two to 10 seconds, 15 seconds, which is almost like all these chains start feeling like they are one single.
01:01:00.442 - 01:01:03.234, Speaker A: That's great. Sandeep, man, a pleasure having you on.
01:01:03.394 - 01:01:03.834, Speaker B: Thank you, sir.
