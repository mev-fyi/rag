00:00:00.400 - 00:00:01.870, Speaker A: When you're a project that you're still.
00:00:01.902 - 00:00:04.510, Speaker B: Very early stage, but for whatever reason.
00:00:04.542 - 00:00:10.558, Speaker A: You launched the token and that token is down 90%, 95%, you know, market.
00:00:10.606 - 00:00:14.646, Speaker B: Caps of 20 million or so and.
00:00:14.670 - 00:00:27.070, Speaker A: You have 10% of that. Like, that's 2 million. Maybe that buys you another year, but you still have to have to cut meaningful amounts of headcount and whatnot. And so in, practically speaking, you're not even, you don't even want to sell 100% of your treasury.
00:00:27.142 - 00:00:27.754, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:28.674 - 00:00:35.734, Speaker A: So it's a very difficult position that a lot of teams are in right now that I think you're just going to have to close shop.
00:00:37.834 - 00:00:41.374, Speaker C: You see, Mike is in Montana where it's negative 40 degrees right now.
00:00:42.954 - 00:00:52.642, Speaker A: It's crazy. This is real winter. We're talking about weather here, folks. But yeah, I think a lot of people are really exhausted and they just.
00:00:52.818 - 00:00:56.846, Speaker B: The real question now becomes, is 2023.
00:00:56.910 - 00:01:00.274, Speaker A: Going to be as bad of a year as 2022?
00:01:01.294 - 00:01:07.086, Speaker B: Naturally, I think people, you know, when things have gone very bad, I think.
00:01:07.190 - 00:01:09.046, Speaker A: You just turn negative and it's hard.
00:01:09.070 - 00:01:11.382, Speaker B: To like see the light at the.
00:01:11.398 - 00:01:30.516, Speaker A: End of the tunnel. But it's an interesting question I think a lot of people are asking themselves right now, and I'm seeing across a lot of the different groups. I mean, is how will 2023 shake up? And I know we're going to talk about it tomorrow and the roundup of like predictions, but yeah, it's interesting. I don't have a good answer for that, to be honest.
00:01:30.660 - 00:01:56.314, Speaker C: Yeah, well, anyways, man, we missed you on the show here, gallivanting around the world, so it's good to have you back and we missed you. We certainly missed you. We had a couple good episodes. We have some amazing episodes lined up for January that I'm super pumped about. But in any case, it's good to have you back. How you feeling about things? Obviously, you've taken like two weeks, two weeks off from the markets. Hopefully close your screens a little bit.
00:01:56.314 - 00:01:59.154, Speaker C: Just love to hear how you're feeling right now.
00:01:59.774 - 00:02:02.902, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I think it was.
00:02:02.918 - 00:02:05.554, Speaker A: Good to take two weeks off. Just clear my mind a bit.
00:02:06.134 - 00:02:08.534, Speaker B: And as I come back, you still.
00:02:08.614 - 00:02:46.044, Speaker A: Look at some pretty bad headlines. Bank of Japan kind of raising rates, which is, I think, a pretty big shift in stance that they've probably been the only major central bank that has kept stubbornly rates low, but they've now flipped. But yen obviously reacted to that and so that's big. And then inflation numbers across the board just continue to persist higher and the UK numbers came out today. Mexico numbers came out today. There were record kind of levels of inflation, and the market's kind of reacting pretty negatively to that. The Nasdaq is down like 3% today.
00:02:46.794 - 00:02:48.930, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been interesting.
00:02:48.962 - 00:02:52.282, Speaker A: I mean, obviously this is not a macro episode, nor am I a macro.
00:02:52.338 - 00:02:57.426, Speaker B: Expert, but yeah, it's been in many.
00:02:57.450 - 00:03:06.290, Speaker A: Ways just this continues to be the major headline and all other assets kind of trading in tandem with the Nasdaq and the S and P. So, yeah.
00:03:06.402 - 00:03:08.530, Speaker B: That'S been, there's a lot of other.
00:03:08.562 - 00:03:10.042, Speaker A: Interesting developments in crypto, but on the.
00:03:10.058 - 00:03:13.006, Speaker B: Macro front, yeah, things are, continue to.
00:03:13.030 - 00:03:18.074, Speaker A: Be fairly bleak and doom ish, I guess.
00:03:18.654 - 00:03:25.634, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you have any anecdotes from past cycles that help inform you as to, like, where in the cycle we're at right now?
00:03:26.574 - 00:03:29.790, Speaker B: Well, as it relates to macro, no.
00:03:29.862 - 00:04:02.654, Speaker A: Because most of my professional career I've invested in a low interested environment and so I don't have a lot of things to hold on to. Certainly an investing. Yes, like, I think like prior cycles, it's hard, really hard to time this. And I think there's a great episode of Stan Duncan Miller that came out this summer we've talked about in this show, but I think it's fairly in strike when you see someone like that be very humble and say, these are kind of unprecedented times. And he's seen a lot, mind you. Right. And he's one of the more seasoned investors out there.
00:04:02.654 - 00:04:08.524, Speaker A: So I'm not here going to tell people that I have more insight than someone like him.
00:04:10.064 - 00:04:12.360, Speaker B: The question is, like, what does that.
00:04:12.432 - 00:04:37.754, Speaker A: Mean for, for crypto as an asset class? I think a lot of the, it does feel like a lot of the sentiment is very negative, like extremely negative, and people are exhausted. And that generally tends to coincide with, you know, everyone's looked at the kind of the cycle and the emotions like pain, disillusionment, despair, anger. You know, I think we are like.
00:04:38.894 - 00:04:41.326, Speaker B: You know, in that state where the.
00:04:41.350 - 00:04:54.198, Speaker A: Overwhelming sentiment is very negative. The positive thing is there's like two different crypto Twitter feeds. One is founders continuing to ship really interesting stuff and kind of unfazed. They're well capitalized.
00:04:54.246 - 00:04:57.294, Speaker B: They just keep their heads down and.
00:04:57.414 - 00:05:25.890, Speaker A: See there's like a lot of shifts that are going on at the macro level that I think bode well for particular verticals in crypto, like social and stable coin adoption and, you know, a lot of the pruning of recursive leverage and probably good, you know, regulation coming out next year that clarifies a lot of things. It could be positive for crypto. So, like, impossible to predict where we.
00:05:25.922 - 00:05:28.634, Speaker B: Are leaning on prior cycles.
00:05:28.674 - 00:05:45.734, Speaker A: It does feel to me like we're, you know, bottoming. Do we have another leg down, maybe, possibly? Like it's always possible. But, yeah, to me, it feels like we're, you know, bottoming, if you will. I don't know if you agree with that or what you think.
00:05:47.194 - 00:06:12.914, Speaker C: What about not on the macro side, Santi? What about just like in, in crypto land? And specifically, I'm curious if you. I'm curious on how you think about that. Like, do you try to time it with the macro and think about, like, crypto fitting in with the macro and you're trying to time the bottom there almost? Or you, do you think about past anecdotes from other cycles that you've experienced and not, not in macro, but in crypto?
00:06:13.214 - 00:06:16.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the big distinction now.
00:06:16.238 - 00:06:18.906, Speaker A: Is the opportunity cost that you have on your capital.
00:06:19.070 - 00:06:22.306, Speaker B: You know, before you were holding cash.
00:06:22.370 - 00:06:24.498, Speaker A: Was not very compelling.
00:06:24.626 - 00:06:26.650, Speaker B: You were paying, you're getting paid 0%.
00:06:26.682 - 00:06:39.414, Speaker A: Of your bank account bonds. You know, we're not really compelling either. And so from that standpoint, now you have a. The opportunity or clip 5% on cash deposits.
00:06:39.994 - 00:06:51.358, Speaker B: And, and that's a big distinction. Now that plays in my thinking, which is, am I getting paid enough to take more risk and enter the market? And mind you, I de risked a.
00:06:51.366 - 00:07:14.062, Speaker A: Fair amount November of last year. I was partially lucky, but it was just by virtue of timing of events as I was transitioning and positioning my portfolio now that I came off of parafi and just was transitioning into just thinking about deploying my own capital and repositioning my portfolio. The thing that I didn't want to.
00:07:14.078 - 00:07:17.126, Speaker B: Be in a position not knowing that.
00:07:17.150 - 00:07:21.674, Speaker A: Things were going to get pretty bad, but just having a feeling that from a personal standpoint, I wanted to have.
00:07:22.214 - 00:07:27.198, Speaker B: More liquidity because most of my assets are illiquid. And so it never hurts to have.
00:07:27.286 - 00:07:31.274, Speaker A: A pocket of liquidity. And so it happened partially by luck, I think.
00:07:32.014 - 00:07:33.502, Speaker B: And so now the question is, at.
00:07:33.518 - 00:07:39.486, Speaker A: What point do I enter the market? So that's different this cycle than past, like, past cycles. I was just holding a bag and.
00:07:39.510 - 00:07:43.150, Speaker B: Just was not really looking to do.
00:07:43.182 - 00:07:56.914, Speaker A: Much other than just see it through. And now we're in a very similar state. Assets are down 80% from their highs, right? 80, sometimes 90% across the board, bitcoin, ETH, and then all the other alts.
00:07:58.334 - 00:08:00.766, Speaker B: But the thing that is really, that.
00:08:00.790 - 00:08:11.330, Speaker A: I'm really thinking about is am I getting paid enough to enter and take risk back on in a meaningful size? Yeah, you might, like, cost ever your way in. I think that's always been a good.
00:08:11.362 - 00:08:13.538, Speaker B: Strategy, thinking that you're never going to.
00:08:13.546 - 00:08:15.454, Speaker A: Be able to, like, time it perfectly.
00:08:16.034 - 00:08:17.106, Speaker B: You know, when you see an asset.
00:08:17.130 - 00:08:19.858, Speaker A: That you, like go down 80%, you liked it at the high.
00:08:19.906 - 00:08:20.210, Speaker B: You.
00:08:20.282 - 00:08:23.454, Speaker A: You certainly should like it now if fundamentals haven't changed.
00:08:25.994 - 00:08:27.130, Speaker B: But, but it's.
00:08:27.242 - 00:08:32.962, Speaker A: It's very tempting to just, like, sit on cash and get paid 5% until you. There's, like a number of things that.
00:08:32.978 - 00:08:39.886, Speaker B: I want to get clarity on, on the macro side, but, yeah, it's, it's.
00:08:39.910 - 00:08:47.074, Speaker A: Very tempting to just earn that 5% yield and then, like, rotate just the yield piece into risk assets.
00:08:47.494 - 00:08:49.782, Speaker B: You know, certainly, like, cost everything my.
00:08:49.798 - 00:08:57.350, Speaker A: Way in ETH or some of the other things that I like investing in, early stage stuff. But yeah, on the valuation side of.
00:08:57.382 - 00:09:00.782, Speaker B: Things, what is fairly similar to, like.
00:09:00.878 - 00:09:03.508, Speaker A: January of 2019 is seeing a lot.
00:09:03.516 - 00:09:06.660, Speaker B: Of assets trade even below their, like.
00:09:06.852 - 00:09:16.860, Speaker A: ICO prices or latest round valuations, which is now, you could argue, a lot of valuations, latest round valuations were, like.
00:09:16.892 - 00:09:18.532, Speaker B: Propped up and, like, you know, you.
00:09:18.548 - 00:09:19.724, Speaker A: Shouldn'T even look at that number as.
00:09:19.764 - 00:09:22.044, Speaker B: Something real and maybe they will never.
00:09:22.084 - 00:09:26.784, Speaker A: Recover to that level. But it's an anchor psychologically. A lot of investors look at that.
00:09:27.484 - 00:09:31.560, Speaker B: And so, but it's fairly interesting to.
00:09:31.592 - 00:09:45.320, Speaker A: See a lot of really quality projects that are well capitalized. Some are even trading out, like, have cash reserves and, like, the book value of their assets is like, higher or like one to one to, like their market cap.
00:09:45.512 - 00:09:49.520, Speaker B: That's fairly distressed, I think, and compelling.
00:09:49.632 - 00:09:51.088, Speaker A: And we saw that in 2019.
00:09:51.176 - 00:09:55.266, Speaker B: So those are the, I look at that and I say, okay, well, it.
00:09:55.290 - 00:09:56.370, Speaker A: Feels to me like a lot of.
00:09:56.402 - 00:10:08.162, Speaker B: Investors are in this state where they're bracing for survival and, like, you know, like, indiscriminately chopping stuff to just go.
00:10:08.178 - 00:10:21.882, Speaker A: To cash quickly, end the year, buy some time to just think and have some breathing room. And those are kind of the times where I think are the best investment opportunities, where just people go to extremes, both on the ups, up and down.
00:10:21.938 - 00:10:23.780, Speaker B: And I think we're in that state.
00:10:23.812 - 00:10:30.544, Speaker A: Of extreme paranoia, pessimism, you know, and.
00:10:32.484 - 00:10:34.420, Speaker B: So it's, you know, we get to.
00:10:34.452 - 00:10:57.596, Speaker A: Relive an opportunity to deploy the same strategy in stuff that you like. Hopefully, you've done the work, you've done the homework. The question that I like to ask myself is, like, if you're patient, if you have more than one year time horizon, you kind of. I think that's easier to see. Really good entry points. Like crypto is yet again, like in prior episodes, I thought, okay, the market cap of crypto is going to go down to a trillion.
00:10:57.780 - 00:10:58.836, Speaker B: Then Terra happened.
00:10:58.860 - 00:11:10.332, Speaker A: I said, no, let's revise that. I revised that to like 800. And we're sitting at a little bit lower now, I think. What is it, 832 billion with some inflation.
00:11:10.388 - 00:11:10.580, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:10.612 - 00:11:23.914, Speaker A: Because that's like circulating market cap. There's projects that have inflation. So four or 5%. So, you know, roughly speaking, you're kind of at, at a billion or so. Can it go down to 750? Can it go down to 600 most? Yeah, obviously.
00:11:24.254 - 00:11:30.206, Speaker B: But, like, you know, in five years time, do you think a crypto is.
00:11:30.230 - 00:11:31.234, Speaker A: Not going to go away?
00:11:32.214 - 00:11:34.246, Speaker B: Like, things are very different today than.
00:11:34.270 - 00:12:18.954, Speaker A: What they were in 2019? You have multiple verticals. Like, yeah, okay, you had cryptokitties back then, but you have, like, tangible NFT markets that while volume has come down, you have really good brands entering the space. You have former presidents issuing nfts that we'll talk about in this episode. Like, you know, what's different this time than it is last time is that crypto as a whole is entering a new stage where it's finally being used. And increasingly so as we look forward over the next, like, twelve to 24 months. You and I have invested in projects and other projects that I'm not an investor in. I just have a feeling that we're going to see some really cool applications, front facing applications that give people a really good understanding of what digital ownership means.
00:12:18.954 - 00:12:21.326, Speaker A: Whether they appreciate the back end, they.
00:12:21.350 - 00:12:26.438, Speaker B: Appreciate the tech, doesn't really matter. But, like, usability drives a lot of value.
00:12:26.526 - 00:12:34.230, Speaker A: And I think that's secular of macro in many ways. Like, okay, are people going to shell out like 100,000 to buy nfts?
00:12:34.262 - 00:12:37.846, Speaker B: That's a very small crowd, but that.
00:12:37.870 - 00:12:48.442, Speaker A: Doesn'T mean that nfts need it. Like, not all nfts are going to be 100,000. Like crypto punks, if you will, or board a. It feels to me like a lot.
00:12:48.458 - 00:12:54.298, Speaker B: Of the tech infrastructure has been deployed over the last 1012 years and you're.
00:12:54.346 - 00:13:14.534, Speaker A: Finally in a position to deliver credible, workable, scalable, consumer facing applications. And I think that's going to be independent of macro. Anytime you have a fun product that delivers really tangible value, people are going to use it. And, you know, I think the same is true for the Internet.
00:13:15.074 - 00:13:20.054, Speaker C: Yeah. Are you doing anything with your portfolio right now or are you just kind of staying put.
00:13:23.074 - 00:13:35.818, Speaker A: Well, by choice or just force. Like a lot of the projects that I invested into liquid, so I can't really do much. I'm like rotating that piece. So I'm like largely staying put.
00:13:35.866 - 00:13:37.632, Speaker B: And we talked about this before we.
00:13:37.648 - 00:13:41.880, Speaker A: Start recording, but I think a lot of the mistakes that I made historically.
00:13:41.952 - 00:13:45.200, Speaker B: Over the years has been like doing.
00:13:45.312 - 00:13:54.808, Speaker A: Too much, like over trading over, you know, and, and so it's really tempting because sitting in many ways, like, just.
00:13:54.856 - 00:13:56.808, Speaker B: Sitting tight is probably one of the.
00:13:56.816 - 00:14:08.312, Speaker A: Hardest things to do because, you know, as a type a, like, you always want to feel like you're doing stuff and I think sometimes that gets in the way.
00:14:08.368 - 00:14:08.964, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:10.064 - 00:14:11.856, Speaker A: Writing does help to like, make sure.
00:14:11.880 - 00:14:15.152, Speaker B: That I understand why I did an investment and.
00:14:15.168 - 00:14:35.860, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Like, I thinking probabilistically, like, if a protocol has done 100 x and what was the probability of that doing another ten x, then you probably should manage risk, take chips off the table and invest in other stuff that has higher probability of giving you better return. But yeah, right now I'm not doing much. I am seeing really interesting deals from.
00:14:35.932 - 00:14:38.620, Speaker B: Like very seasoned founders that are coming.
00:14:38.652 - 00:15:03.834, Speaker A: Into crypto at like 15 million, 20 million, 10 million, valuing 1510, those deals would have gotten done at 50 million. So like a five x multiple, you know, earlier this year. And I think that's, that's fairly compelling. But to be honest, the number of, in terms of deal flow, it's gone meaningfully down.
00:15:04.254 - 00:15:35.174, Speaker C: Are the properties on the term sheets changing? Like the liquidity preferences and things like that? Like how much are you seeing that change? Because a year ago it was entirely in the founders favor. Right people, no board seats, like basically no, just like anything I need to do to get into this deal, I would do as a VC right now. The VC's have been on the wrong end of that for the last twelve months. And so I think I'm slowly starting to see these provisions get put back in place in these term sheets. So I'm curious what you're saying.
00:15:35.834 - 00:15:43.930, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. Board seats. Yes, liquidation preference is. No, I think that's still one to.
00:15:43.962 - 00:15:44.534, Speaker B: One.
00:15:46.834 - 00:15:48.554, Speaker A: Pro rata rights, more so.
00:15:48.594 - 00:15:53.070, Speaker B: Now the biggest term that I think.
00:15:53.102 - 00:15:54.754, Speaker A: Hasn'T changed is liquidation preference.
00:15:55.134 - 00:15:59.990, Speaker B: Like in traditional tech land, in pretty.
00:16:00.102 - 00:16:15.874, Speaker A: Bad situations of liquidity crunches, when capital markets dried up for a lot of tech companies, like you would see liquidation preferences of like two x, two and a half x. And those are still not coming back, I think, at least not in crypto.
00:16:17.834 - 00:16:18.290, Speaker B: So.
00:16:18.362 - 00:16:42.290, Speaker A: But yeah, I think like board seats, definitely. Also instructed by FTX. And the lack of just. There was like no board altogether. I think people are now pushing more so to have a board seat if you're the lead investor, but the structure remains the same. Just the valuation numbers come down dramatically and that's really compelling as an investor, I guess, as an anecdote, the second.
00:16:42.362 - 00:16:44.836, Speaker B: Piece that I, that I'm monitoring and.
00:16:44.860 - 00:16:49.904, Speaker A: Looking at more closely now is just overall tech valuations, like secondary market valuations.
00:16:50.324 - 00:16:51.984, Speaker B: And what people are selling.
00:16:52.724 - 00:17:10.368, Speaker A: You know, there's a fair number of platforms that one can have access to if you're an institutional investor in the US, like equity, Zen, and a few others. Where you see secondary market like these are like either existing investors, whether it be employees or venture funds, that are selling shares, sometimes common, sometimes preferred.
00:17:10.516 - 00:17:13.096, Speaker B: So naturally, just as a one on.
00:17:13.120 - 00:17:47.794, Speaker A: One, preferred shares have more rights, are higher up in the capital structure, so should have a higher value than the common. And if people are selling, if you see preferreds being offered in the market, that means an institutional investor that is a venture fund is selling. And I think that's a bigger signal than common, unless it's a founder selling like foundry shares. But a. A lot of these valuations, like the price that is being transacted out in these secondary marketplaces is like consistently 40, 50, 60% down in the last round.
00:17:49.974 - 00:18:13.668, Speaker C: I think even more than that is what I'm saying. Like, we are. I saw a deal earlier this week. It was they had, I think their last public raise was 10 billion plus they. Maybe a month ago I saw secondary shares come through at 3 billion. I was like, wow, it's down 70%, 80%. Now this, I think it was on Monday or Tuesday, I saw them come through at like 1.5
00:18:13.668 - 00:18:18.652, Speaker C: or 1.8. Now you're down 90% in the secondary.
00:18:18.828 - 00:18:23.224, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, I mean, I would assume.
00:18:24.324 - 00:18:48.064, Speaker C: Yeah. My take on that is, I think who's selling those shares right now are the non crypto VC's. Like the tigers of the world. I'm not saying actually tiger, but like the non crypto native institutions who maybe got in late in the cycle, didn't actually believe in crypto, chased the narrative. Now they're looking at their book and saying like, just get me out of this asset class. I don't want anything to do with this. I don't believe in it long term.
00:18:48.064 - 00:19:01.764, Speaker C: Like, you had that tweet earlier this week, or last week, you're like, continue holding crypto if you believe in XYZ. And I think there are a lot of folks who don't believe in that, so they're doing what you should do when you don't believe in something in your portfolio which is dumping it.
00:19:02.204 - 00:19:07.104, Speaker A: Yeah. You were talking specifically about crypto equity investments.
00:19:08.124 - 00:19:10.036, Speaker C: Crypto equity investments, yeah, yeah.
00:19:10.100 - 00:19:13.384, Speaker A: I was talking just generally about, like, just tech.
00:19:13.684 - 00:19:18.492, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Oh, I mean, yeah. Tech deals are. I mean, like, these are like, you.
00:19:18.508 - 00:19:32.024, Speaker A: Know, free ports of the world, just like traditional tech unicorns that are not public yet. There's a fair amount of secondary activity going on and at pretty indiscriminate prices.
00:19:33.924 - 00:19:40.548, Speaker B: And so I'm looking at that fairly closely because I think it's one of.
00:19:40.556 - 00:19:43.516, Speaker A: The more instructive metrics to understand where we are in the cycle.
00:19:43.620 - 00:19:46.436, Speaker B: Meaning, like, if someone is willing to.
00:19:46.460 - 00:20:02.256, Speaker A: Let go of something at, like, that discount psychologically, you could. Putting aside the idea, is it worth. Is this asset worth this much billion or 10 billion? Because sometimes you don't have a lot of insight into the current valuation, burn rate, a couple other things.
00:20:02.320 - 00:20:06.352, Speaker B: Right. But just from a psychological level, it.
00:20:06.368 - 00:20:12.924, Speaker A: Is very hard, I think, for an institutional investor that, to swallow that amount of a haircut.
00:20:14.784 - 00:20:15.712, Speaker B: Where a lot of.
00:20:15.728 - 00:20:42.354, Speaker A: Times it's permanent capital. Sometimes, as you alluded to, could be a tiger fund, like a hybrid fund that is marketing to market and has redemptions. But if you're a venture funding, you're selling at that level. I mean, you must be really hurting because you have, like, 510 years of permanent capital. And so anytime you see an actor do that, you have to wonder, like, how bad is it for them?
00:20:42.854 - 00:20:44.510, Speaker B: Is it bad for other people who's.
00:20:44.542 - 00:20:51.106, Speaker A: Buying on the other side? And you saw a lot of secondary market activity, like, a lot pick up in, like, the trough of last cycle.
00:20:51.130 - 00:20:52.014, Speaker B: In crypto.
00:20:53.754 - 00:20:55.802, Speaker A: Like, in January of 2019.
00:20:55.898 - 00:20:59.298, Speaker B: We were seeing some what now made.
00:20:59.346 - 00:21:03.626, Speaker A: Or broke funds, to be honest. Like, framework bought a huge chunk of.
00:21:03.650 - 00:21:08.754, Speaker B: SNX at, like, just at the pure bottom.
00:21:08.794 - 00:21:24.284, Speaker A: This is January 2019. And, you know, at paraphy, it's public now. But, you know, we did a fair amount of, like, just direct buying from teams and because that's really the only way you could, like, when an asset.
00:21:25.144 - 00:21:27.592, Speaker B: When an asset's not very liquid, and.
00:21:27.608 - 00:21:44.764, Speaker A: Now you have a combination of a lot of. A lot of liquidity haven't dried up in the market by virtue of all the blow ups. So a lot of these projects, if you want to get access to, you need to go and buy from an existing investor directly from treasury of the team and or founders.
00:21:45.144 - 00:21:53.936, Speaker B: And if you start seeing a lot of that, then it, to me is always the more interesting metric that I'm.
00:21:53.960 - 00:21:57.444, Speaker A: Looking at now to understand where we're on the cycle. To go back to your original question.
00:21:57.864 - 00:22:09.728, Speaker C: Is that happening right now? Santi, are funds buying, do you still buy direct from protocols, from their treasuries? I remember that was a thing a couple of years ago where I think.
00:22:09.736 - 00:22:12.476, Speaker A: We pioneered that, to be honest. At parabon, I.
00:22:12.500 - 00:22:15.340, Speaker C: Well, I think you. I think you guys did nail that. A paraphy. You guys had a whole.
00:22:15.412 - 00:22:22.540, Speaker A: And then you saw like. And then, and then like Lido did. Did the direct thing to sushi try to do this.
00:22:22.692 - 00:22:23.452, Speaker C: I think that was.
00:22:23.508 - 00:22:25.904, Speaker A: Or dragonfly. Well, it did it with par.
00:22:27.804 - 00:22:28.236, Speaker B: It was.
00:22:28.260 - 00:22:40.672, Speaker A: It was dragonfly. They tried to do that light. Oh, I think we could. Got rejected. I don't know if it went through, but paradigm did it light. Oh, and there was a proposal from Lightspeed when Amy was there to do it with sushi and got rejected, but.
00:22:40.848 - 00:22:45.888, Speaker B: Yeah, that, well, not so much in.
00:22:45.936 - 00:22:46.804, Speaker A: Crypto.
00:22:48.584 - 00:23:01.128, Speaker B: I think, but a lot of teams that have that hold like 1020 percent of the tokens under treasury, maybe more, are exploring the possibility.
00:23:01.296 - 00:23:16.134, Speaker A: They're kind of in a tight spot because the prices come down so much on the liquid token that even if they wanted to raise something to extend their one way for like 18 months or another year, that 10% of the treasury is not even worth that much.
00:23:17.794 - 00:23:20.254, Speaker B: So it's really tricky to.
00:23:21.034 - 00:23:24.770, Speaker A: In a very tricky position that they're at where they can't really sell from.
00:23:24.802 - 00:23:28.002, Speaker B: Treasury because it's not even going to.
00:23:28.018 - 00:23:33.308, Speaker A: Accomplish what they want now, which is extend their Runway. So, yeah, it's really tough, actually, a.
00:23:33.316 - 00:23:36.104, Speaker B: Lot of teams here are facing that.
00:23:38.084 - 00:23:40.812, Speaker A: And they're kind of. I don't see a easy way out.
00:23:40.828 - 00:23:44.580, Speaker B: Of that kind of, because you might.
00:23:44.612 - 00:24:13.670, Speaker A: Try to raise, like, when you're a project that you're still very early stage, but for whatever reason, you launched the token and that token is down 90%, 95%, you know, market caps of 20 million or so, and you have 10% of that. Like, that's 2 million. Maybe that buys you another year, but you still have to have to cut meaningful amounts of headcount and whatnot. And so, practically speaking, you're not even. You don't even want to sell 100% of your treasury.
00:24:13.742 - 00:24:14.354, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:15.254 - 00:24:22.314, Speaker A: So it's a very difficult position that a lot of teams are in right now that I think you're just going to have to close shop.
00:24:22.694 - 00:24:51.526, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so, too. I mean, I think. I mean, next year is just going to be a bloodbath for crypto startups. I think the first folks to get impacted in the market from all this, starting with Luna into three arrows into FTX, into Genesis, was firms who basically touched the markets in some way or another. What's going to happen next year is I think you're going to have a lot of the 2021, 2022 startups run out of money.
00:24:51.700 - 00:24:52.522, Speaker B: Some of them are going to get.
00:24:52.538 - 00:25:19.284, Speaker C: Acquired, a few will be able to raise new rounds, but at like an 80% down round. And then this is going to have all these other second order impacts. Right. Tech salaries are going to come down, tech jobs are going to come, are going to deflate, VC's are going to start. I mean, the GBT three narrative is hitting at a actually pretty interesting time right now because like naturally VC's start investing in other sectors. If you're a VC right now, you're like, ooh, shiny new thing. AI.
00:25:19.434 - 00:25:20.600, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:25:20.712 - 00:25:22.248, Speaker C: So, yeah.
00:25:22.296 - 00:25:42.204, Speaker A: To be fair, though, tougher for a lot of people. Yeah, I think was it sequoia or someone else? It has a great memo on this. You know, these are times where if you're in a position of strength, there's a lot of crypto startups that raise meaningful rounds that you could have argued were too much capital thrown at them.
00:25:42.624 - 00:25:44.104, Speaker B: This was true for last cycle to.
00:25:44.144 - 00:26:17.578, Speaker A: Filecoin, hashgraph, dfinity, a number of other projects raised, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. Now you have similar, well capitalized startups that they're not going to run out of cash. They're probably like, and they're in a very strong position to go out and acquire talent. And, you know, these include without bias or without particular order, but like arbitrum, astic, starkware, optimism, uniswap. Uniswap, yeah, so, exactly.
00:26:17.626 - 00:26:21.130, Speaker B: So I think, you know, that is.
00:26:21.162 - 00:26:23.962, Speaker A: Going to be certainly a lot of m amp a activity is going to.
00:26:23.978 - 00:26:28.050, Speaker B: Happen next year, aqua hires for sure.
00:26:28.242 - 00:27:20.484, Speaker A: And I think, you know, people that are surviving this is true. Many cycle are going to emerge in a very strong position. You know, to be fair, I mean, a lot of times the other thing was how healthy is the private vc market today? I'll just make one, a couple observations. One, sometimes rounds don't get announced down rounds particularly. So there's a selection bias where only the up rounds that were negotiated maybe six months ago are announced today. For instance, like I'm thinking of ASIC. They raised like what, 100 million from a 16 z recently that may have gotten negotiated months ago in a different market environment, because the market environment has changed so much since March when the Fed started raising rates at an unprecedented rate, like seven rate hikes, it went from 0% fed funds rate to four and a quarter.
00:27:20.484 - 00:27:38.344, Speaker A: And you look like Katie Hahn, for instance, raised a massive fund, Han Ventures. She was publicly on Bloomberg is discussing how meaningfully she's just like not deploying right now and just being very opportunistic because she thinks, like, there's going to be more opportunities to buy at a lower price.
00:27:40.244 - 00:27:42.188, Speaker B: And so you have a number of.
00:27:42.196 - 00:27:43.428, Speaker A: Other funds that have raised capital.
00:27:43.516 - 00:27:46.292, Speaker B: So the other observation is a lot.
00:27:46.308 - 00:27:52.036, Speaker A: Of times the headline number that they say, hey, fund x, raise 100 million, 500 million, a lot of times that.
00:27:52.060 - 00:27:53.452, Speaker B: Capital might not be committed.
00:27:53.588 - 00:27:58.724, Speaker A: And when they go out and try to call that capital from investors, that may not come through.
00:27:59.624 - 00:28:03.880, Speaker B: And so the amount of dry powder might be, you know, I would probably.
00:28:03.912 - 00:28:09.124, Speaker A: Haircut that by 50% maybe as like a true deployable dry powder.
00:28:11.664 - 00:28:15.004, Speaker B: But yeah, so I think, you know.
00:28:16.264 - 00:28:57.500, Speaker A: We'Re still seeing a fair amount of deals get priced at, you know, flatter up rounds for teams that are continuing to do progress across a number of kind of verticals. As you said, I think the most important thing is what's last cycle? It was like Defi and then NFTs that like kicked off. It was Defi that really kicked off last cycle. Putting macro aside, because macro is not an issue for pure crypto, the question is like, it, people are really bearish on crypto right now. Sentiments flow. What's going to be that? That one or two catalysts that ignites the next market? From a secular perspective, it renews interest in crypto. Like, obviously the obvious answer for some might be it's going to be macro.
00:28:57.500 - 00:28:58.604, Speaker A: It's all dictated by macro.
00:28:58.644 - 00:29:01.420, Speaker B: But to some extent, I think, yeah.
00:29:01.452 - 00:29:20.560, Speaker A: Macro might come back up, but investors might just turn to the next shiny thing, which is probably AI. So what's going to be that catalyst that gets people really excited about crypto? And I've had fair amount of discussions with people about this and I think it's gaming. I continue to think it's gaming. Maybe there's other stuff, but I think.
00:29:20.592 - 00:29:23.080, Speaker B: Gaming to me feels like, like that.
00:29:23.112 - 00:29:26.884, Speaker A: Killer kind of use case. It gets people really excited about coming back to crypto.
00:29:32.104 - 00:29:54.922, Speaker C: Developments. I think next week is going to be the big, the big episode, right. The predictions episode, the crossover episode with Mike and Mark Usko hitting it from. Maybe they'll hit it from more of a macro perspective. We'll take maybe the more degen perspective here. I'm really excited about that conversation, but there were some interesting developments this week. So the first place I wanted to start is actually with Visa.
00:29:54.922 - 00:30:51.602, Speaker C: You know, we're in a bear market when the most exciting news of the week came from Visa and what actually happened. So Katherine Gu came on Twitter. She's an infrastructure and crypto specialist at Visa. Took to Twitter to share some news about the company's exploration into actually account abstraction, which is this widely discussed topic in the ETH community. Specifically, she shared news about Visa's ambition to become the, as she put it, or as they put it, to become the liaison between the real world and crypto by implementing account abstraction to give externally owned accounts eoas, which you can think of, that's a metamask wallet, for example, more functionality. And specifically, I think if I understand it correctly, their team worked with Argent to deploy an auto pay feature on a private chain on Starknet. So this is a pretty interesting development to see someone as big as visa.
00:30:51.602 - 00:31:22.614, Speaker C: I mean, visas always push the boundaries and like the traditional, I think of them and stripe as pushing the kind of innovation card pretty strongly in the payment space. It's really them and visa. In my mind, it's just cool to see them experiment. I have a pro and a con here, but I think in general, it's cool to see them experimenting with things like Argent and Starknet and account abstraction, which is this idea that Vitalik introduced a couple of years ago. So, yeah, I'd love to get your take on this.
00:31:23.674 - 00:32:05.404, Speaker A: Yeah, super exciting and again, super positive. Headlines get buried in bear markets. Visa, I mean, first, was historically been fairly ahead of the curve in terms of stablecoin adoption. And you're right, this is a big deal. Not only huge validation for Starknet, but also just maybe setting up a path towards, like, payments, right? Because payments has been one of those areas where people have been really excited about payments as being like a killer use case, but it hasn't really taken off, right, because you have stable coins and, you know, like micro payments and just auto purchases and like, that whole.
00:32:05.564 - 00:32:09.756, Speaker B: Area has been largely kind of, you.
00:32:09.780 - 00:32:23.412, Speaker A: Know, underdeveloped and hasn't really taken off. And so this, this to me feels like, again, largely enabled by the efficiency that you can get through an l two environment like Starknet. And anyone that wants to refresh their memory and start to go and listen.
00:32:23.428 - 00:32:26.392, Speaker B: To the episode that we recorded with.
00:32:26.408 - 00:32:28.928, Speaker A: The start knit guys, I think is really interesting.
00:32:29.016 - 00:32:33.472, Speaker B: Right? So, you know, not to mention, you.
00:32:33.488 - 00:32:40.724, Speaker A: Know, the huge distribution base that visa has. And so I think it's super positive.
00:32:41.904 - 00:33:53.774, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's a backstory here to this announcement, which I think is a pretty interesting one. They did an internal hackathon, I think, which is how this, which is, which is actually where this came out of. So in my mind, first off, that's just a really good sign. When a company is big, a public company as big as Visa, and someone who's been around as long as Visa does an internal hackathon or competition, and can drive innovation inside the firm all the way up to where the point to where they're actually doing press releases around this and product launches, that's just bottoms up innovation that I think is really impressive. So the backstory from what I know about this is there was an internal hackathon in February or March around one big problem, which was how can an ether owner pay a bill with crypto at a future date while temporarily away from Internet? How could someone who owns ETH pay a bill at a future date while temporarily away from Internet service? So that's a pretty interesting, like that. It's just interesting to see visa taking on these like real, real world challenges.
00:33:53.774 - 00:34:14.776, Speaker C: And there are a lot of people who have taken this on, right. There's actually EIP 1337. I think it was around subscriptions. There are some like smaller companies that have tried taking this on like streaming payments and subscription payments on ETH. And look, this is still private network on start. Like it's still not fully out there in the world yet to play with. But like, I think it's very cool.
00:34:14.776 - 00:34:18.284, Speaker C: Shout out to Katherine and their team for making this happen.
00:34:18.944 - 00:34:20.160, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, when you think about.
00:34:20.192 - 00:34:22.984, Speaker B: Like there are certain friction points when.
00:34:23.064 - 00:34:49.578, Speaker A: One tries to subscribe, get access to paid behind the wall content in traditional, like the stack right now of you go to a website, try to subscribe to particular web, you know, service. There's a lot of card abandonment, if you will. And certainly there are companies on the margin that have made this much more efficient. Certainly something like Apple Pay is super efficient now and Apple is introducing more security measures.
00:34:49.706 - 00:34:52.882, Speaker B: But still, again, we know the challenges.
00:34:52.898 - 00:34:59.814, Speaker A: And limitations of working with Apple can be really tough at times. Someone like Visa is always thinking, hey, how can we make.
00:35:00.474 - 00:35:04.054, Speaker B: It's fairly interesting now where know people.
00:35:04.094 - 00:35:06.134, Speaker A: Always talk about the institutions are going to come to crypto.
00:35:06.174 - 00:35:12.102, Speaker B: And I think like in many ways they're going to come for the sole reason that this is like first and.
00:35:12.118 - 00:35:48.540, Speaker A: Foremost like a pretty grassrooty retail first market. And you know, there's I was looking at like, for the predictions episode, the amount of stable coins in circulation I thought was going to be like 1 trillion this year. It certainly isn't. It's like 150 billion, which is still a lot, a large number across many number of users worldwide. Visa is a worldwide network. And so I think stablecoins continue to be like this kind of Trojan horse killer product that many people want to use and could meaningfully streamline a lot of the friction points when someone tries to make a transaction and the settlement of that. And it's fairly interesting.
00:35:48.540 - 00:35:51.412, Speaker A: Just the last observation I'll make is a lot of times the narrative in.
00:35:51.428 - 00:36:02.404, Speaker B: Crypto is product x is going to blow up a legacy player and is going to render that particular service useless.
00:36:02.944 - 00:36:05.152, Speaker A: And I think there was another, there.
00:36:05.168 - 00:36:06.928, Speaker B: Was one episode where I think it.
00:36:06.936 - 00:36:14.424, Speaker A: Was brought on by a particular founder that said, no, crypto just amplifies a particular service, existing service, and it's like.
00:36:14.544 - 00:36:17.352, Speaker B: Net positive to the existing solution.
00:36:17.408 - 00:36:19.896, Speaker A: I think it's really refreshing to one.
00:36:20.040 - 00:36:21.964, Speaker B: Kind of get around that take.
00:36:22.904 - 00:36:49.434, Speaker A: And certainly visa, I think, believes it if they want to continue to be relevant for maybe younger generations that skew more towards using crypto products and things like stable coins, like they're thinking ahead in how they capture and acquire and retain and maintain relevance over the next ten years with younger generations that are going to be more crypto savvy. So it starts the journey for that starts today, not like in five or ten years. You know what I mean?
00:36:50.734 - 00:37:30.726, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. And this is all right, so there's two things in my mind. When something like this comes out, you want to think about the second order implication of it, right? And there, there are two things that are interesting in my mind. One is, uh, like this solves an actual real world problem. So crypto, like a genuine, uh, auto payments are a genuine pain point in consumer payments from actually a merchant cost perspective. And what I mean by that is, uh, so recurring payments, if you actually look at them like from an inside out, they, they generate a new fee for each individual payment where arguably you're really just kind of making a single payment, but there's a new fee. That's.
00:37:30.726 - 00:38:13.556, Speaker C: That happens every time there's an individual payment. And I remember, man, I got to find this Wall Street Journal article. There's a Wall Street Journal article about how banks actually asked Apple in, I think it was last year, to treat recurring payments as a single charge back then. And I don't know, visa solution to this, using Argent's wallet and account abstractions like, pretty, pretty interesting. So I think that's why it's interesting in my mind is it actually solves a real world problem. The other thing is, does this unlock. So the background of these accounts is that the way that Ethereum works right now is there are two different types of accounts.
00:38:13.556 - 00:39:09.796, Speaker C: There's eOas, like metamask. Externally owned accounts, or user accounts might be a better way to put it, and then contract accounts, which automatically run the code, like the smart contracts. What I think this visa proposal does, which, again, is similar to EIP 1337, is it essentially merges the two into a single account, which turns the smart contract for executing commands into a software wallet, which can now store crypto. And that's what account abstraction is. So if I remember correctly, you probably remember this better than I do, but the idea of turning a smart contract into a wallet itself is this was proposed a long time ago by Vitalik back in, like, 2015. It was formalized in the last bull market in 2017, as I think the original proposal was EIP 86 or 96. I want to say I think it was 86, but this has been stagnant for a really long time.
00:39:09.796 - 00:39:44.846, Speaker C: So one thing that could happen here is Visa's proposal could rejuvenate interest in this if, like, Vitalik actually marks it as a draft, or however Ethereum proposals work these days. And so what ends up happening there is like, what if, I don't know, like, think about the second order implications for nfts, for example, like, the business model of nfts is one time drop and then royalties. Maybe you could see nfts moving to a subscription based business model, for example. So, like, I think there's all these second order things that will come from this. It's like renewed interest in. In subscriptions on the blockchain.
00:39:45.030 - 00:40:19.754, Speaker A: Yeah, back in the day, I still remember. Yeah, it's a great thought. I think there's still a fair amount of friction in payments in traditional tech land. The, like for a SaaS company, for instance, like renewals and the. In the dropout rate, because you can't, like, charge that credit card again for, like, retail sales is staggering. There's like billions of dollars that are lost because the flow is not very streamlined. And as you said, if you think about it, like, if you signal intent.
00:40:19.914 - 00:40:23.002, Speaker B: To subscribe for a year, and you.
00:40:23.018 - 00:40:29.214, Speaker A: Could do that through a smart contract, and maybe you can revoke permissions.
00:40:31.034 - 00:40:31.346, Speaker B: Based.
00:40:31.370 - 00:40:59.924, Speaker A: On certain terms and conditions, but anytime that you can codify that, then it's going to be much better than the current flow, which still has a lot of dropout and friction points. And so this is, I mean, there's like fair amount of well capitalized startups, some of which have been acquired, Bolt and some others that have tried to like, optimize that payment flow, which is still not fully there there. And you could largely solve that through account abstraction and like a smart contract.
00:41:00.424 - 00:41:35.334, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, there's like this interesting dichotomy though, between being really excited about this and then on the other side, like the oligopoly of visa is one of the main reasons I think that get people into crypto, right? Like merchant fees, cross border fees, really inefficient rails. I think it's one of the motivations for people to build in crypto. So it's just like my brain is trying to be, is wrapping its head around like, man, really, really excited about this, but also like, oh, man, like rent seeking visa coming in and doing this. Like, should I be excited about it? You know what I'm saying?
00:41:37.064 - 00:41:40.736, Speaker B: Yeah, but in some way, shape or.
00:41:40.760 - 00:41:43.816, Speaker A: Form, like, the amount of fees that.
00:41:43.920 - 00:41:46.784, Speaker B: You know, a network like visa can.
00:41:46.904 - 00:42:19.250, Speaker A: Attain over the next 20 years, I think they probably looked at themselves in the mirror, honestly and said, yeah, that's not going to be the case. So we need to add additional business lines and functionality to grow them over time. Because charging, you think about like a Wells Fargo or, sorry, like a, you know, like some of these remittance payment operators that used to charge 8% to move money cross border, like, that's going to like go away meaningfully. Like transferwise, revolut. Some of these companies have made it, have really attacked their business model. And so then they turn to like.
00:42:19.282 - 00:42:21.194, Speaker B: Crypto rails, you know, look at like.
00:42:21.234 - 00:42:47.474, Speaker A: Bitso, for instance, that has taken a meaningful share of their minsflow business. Like, you know, in many ways, like, whether you want to accept it or not, but like any, your margin is my opportunity kind of thinking. Like any, like Peter Thiel says, is better best, which is anytime margin is artificially high, that's going to go away at some point. It's going to go to like near zero at some point. So however, you can milk that for.
00:42:47.554 - 00:42:51.506, Speaker B: 1020 years or whatever, but eventually new.
00:42:51.530 - 00:43:01.316, Speaker A: Technology comes in and evaporates that. And so can you outlive that? And I think Visa is probably really smart in coming out and trying to.
00:43:01.460 - 00:43:02.660, Speaker B: Get ahead of the group.
00:43:02.852 - 00:43:23.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's great. I don't know, no Ponzis, no tokens. I think it was Polinia who responded this, I was like, no Ponzi's, no token chilled, no conspiracy theories, just a real world problem with a viable solution. And I like it also. Yeah, I think it's. I think it's time for account abstraction to, like, come into the mainstream in crypto. Right.
00:43:23.100 - 00:44:12.874, Speaker C: Because if you think about the way that we do things in crypto today, it's actually pretty inefficient. So, like, if you use a Dap on Ethereum, you have to make a new transaction for every single on chain transaction, which is, I mean, it's just a pain in the ass, honestly, when gas fees are super high. But with account abstraction, you can now bundle, transact, like, multiple transactions into one, and then execute the sequence of operations in, like, one. I think they call it an atomic transaction, I'm pretty sure. Or like a multicolored transaction, something like that. So, like, if you look at uniswap today, it requires, if you want to provide liquidity on uniswap, like, thinking back to it, you approve each of the two tokens, then you deposit them with multicall. You could basically just do this in one transaction, which is quicker, easier, more secure as you remove the need for this infinite approval.
00:44:12.874 - 00:44:17.194, Speaker C: I don't know, I think it's a natural next step.
00:44:17.574 - 00:44:18.886, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:44:18.910 - 00:44:26.206, Speaker A: I think more thinking should go into, and I'm sure other people, if there are certain people that have, are smarter here, we should bring them on, because maybe a key theme next year will.
00:44:26.230 - 00:44:27.966, Speaker B: Be now that you've deployed all this.
00:44:27.990 - 00:44:54.304, Speaker A: Infrastructure, particularly like, you know, l two s, and maybe, you know, interoperability across chains and what have you. Like, what are some of the more real, tangible use cases that can be embedded in traditional workflows? These are one example, but I'm sure there's many others. And so maybe more thinking should, should be applied to that as opposed to just working Uniswap and deploying another chain. And so that was a theme that I had last year, which is, what are some of the use cases that.
00:44:54.384 - 00:45:03.884, Speaker B: Have been tried haven't worked, but as you deploy more infrastructure, then maybe you should reconsider that.
00:45:04.264 - 00:45:06.704, Speaker A: And so it's maybe time to think.
00:45:06.744 - 00:45:08.624, Speaker B: About that a bit more.
00:45:08.664 - 00:45:20.864, Speaker A: And it's really exciting to see a company like Visa actually start doing that, which is fairly exciting. Having a hackathon thinking about account abstraction is great.
00:45:21.204 - 00:45:53.074, Speaker C: Yeah. I can see a world where you open like the Visa app. It feels like a normal app with no seed phrase, like just your biometric, but really there's an account abstraction, abstracted wallet, on the back end, you can make USDC payments to your merchants or apps, instant settlement to merchants, no bank fees, non custodial. Boom. Mass adoption is coming. Super exciting. But I think, but I think, like, one question that, you know, the visas of the world, I'm sure are thinking about is, like, when, like, in today's world, there are card fees, but right now they're abstracted away from the consumer.
00:45:53.074 - 00:46:06.226, Speaker C: So, like, how do you get a consumer to switch away from that? It has to be such a better experience. So. But I don't know. Kudos to visa for the research. I'm looking forward to seeing a live deployment. Right?
00:46:06.370 - 00:46:18.822, Speaker A: Yeah. When normies asked me a question around, like, where's crypto going? Why does it need to exist? These are common themes and questions that we get asked, especially in the holiday season. And it's always like, I always, like, bring up my phone and say, look.
00:46:18.878 - 00:46:20.434, Speaker B: Look at all the apps that you have.
00:46:21.054 - 00:46:28.926, Speaker A: And maybe that doesn't change the next five years. Maybe you still love and use your Wells Fargo, your bank America chase, your.
00:46:29.070 - 00:46:34.062, Speaker B: Whatever, revolut, but maybe the apps don't change.
00:46:34.118 - 00:46:35.750, Speaker A: But what the apps leverage in terms.
00:46:35.782 - 00:46:37.132, Speaker B: Of the backend will.
00:46:37.188 - 00:46:38.684, Speaker A: Probably most of your apps in your.
00:46:38.724 - 00:46:41.468, Speaker B: Smartphone in the next five years, ten.
00:46:41.516 - 00:46:44.624, Speaker A: Years, will be using crypto in one way, shape or form.
00:46:45.164 - 00:46:47.612, Speaker B: You may not even notice that, but.
00:46:47.708 - 00:46:50.044, Speaker A: What you will notice is that consumer.
00:46:50.084 - 00:46:52.172, Speaker B: Benefit that you talk about lower.
00:46:52.228 - 00:46:59.744, Speaker A: Maybe you get approved for your mortgage in seconds, and maybe the rate that you get is very compelling.
00:47:00.684 - 00:47:05.996, Speaker B: And maybe, you know, the options that.
00:47:06.020 - 00:47:51.708, Speaker A: You have and what you can do with your capital with whatever is just meaningfully, the menu of options just expands dramatically. And so I think that's the more exciting thing here, that when crypto over the last ten years has put the user a lot of responsibility on the user to understand this technology, especially at the infrastructure level. And that historically has never been the case of mainstream adoption. Like, people don't like to think about how an airplane or a car or a bicycle works, or much less the Internet, which is much more abstract, they start just kind of using it if they get a tremendous amount of benefit. And back to the initial question, I.
00:47:51.716 - 00:47:56.622, Speaker B: Think we're closer to that than most people, I think, feel, because a lot.
00:47:56.638 - 00:48:08.582, Speaker A: Of the judgment is really clouded with macro. But I'm fairly optimistic that a lot of the core work at the infrastructure level has been done. And as you stitch together and deliver.
00:48:08.678 - 00:48:11.206, Speaker B: Workable products in the next, like, next.
00:48:11.230 - 00:48:45.736, Speaker A: Year, we'll start seeing that you already started seeing some, like, pretty cool games launch and some of these, like, applications and, you know, you're gonna, it takes one or two really cool applications to really, like, ignite this movement. And so, yeah, I think assuming that crypto is gonna hit mainstream when people start, like, understanding how to set up their own private, like their manager own keys and, you know, set up their own wallet is unrealistic. But I think there's a number of builders from our vantage point we are investing in that have that top of.
00:48:45.760 - 00:48:49.198, Speaker B: Mind and are gonna and are going.
00:48:49.206 - 00:48:52.070, Speaker A: To think from a user centric standpoint first for the first time ever.
00:48:52.102 - 00:48:52.294, Speaker B: Really?
00:48:52.334 - 00:48:55.394, Speaker A: Now that you have really good infrastructure to support the backend.
00:48:56.134 - 00:49:32.644, Speaker C: Yep. Speaking of gaming, big announcement from Yuga this week. Yuga Labs obviously creator four date yacht club appointed the activision Blizzard president, Daniel Allegre as its new CEO. Pretty big news. I mean, Activision, in my mind, like, Activision Blizzard is the creator of World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Diablo, like a bunch of big blockbuster games. Microsoft is currently attempting to acquire them for like, I think, $70 billion TBD on if that goes through, obviously, or not. So high level thoughts on this one?
00:49:34.224 - 00:49:48.554, Speaker A: Yeah, anytime you see that kind of executive move over to crypto, it just further validates and also lowers the career risk for other executives out there that might be thinking and exploring crypto in a very so huge splash.
00:49:50.014 - 00:49:58.470, Speaker B: I think that trend will probably continue to persist. Like, let's just face the fact, right? The reality is if you're an executive.
00:49:58.582 - 00:50:08.198, Speaker A: Maybe your 401k or the value of your options for, if you're working at a tech startup has gone down dramatically, but you still think about, like, career risk.
00:50:08.246 - 00:50:14.986, Speaker B: Right. And a lot of times crypto has been, you know, very hard to manage.
00:50:15.050 - 00:50:30.474, Speaker A: That risk for a lot of people because you sort of feel like it's like going to like an activist fund in fintech, like in traditional, in tradfi, once you go to like, an activist fund, you're not going back to a normal hedge fund or like, you're just branded as like, yo.
00:50:30.594 - 00:50:33.514, Speaker B: So I think that barrier has slowly.
00:50:33.554 - 00:50:38.266, Speaker A: Gone down and continues to go down. And so, yeah, it's just, again, really.
00:50:38.290 - 00:50:40.916, Speaker B: Exciting to see someone like that, you.
00:50:41.060 - 00:50:45.384, Speaker A: Know, that he has millions of other options to do whatever the hell he wants.
00:50:45.884 - 00:50:50.212, Speaker B: And the fact that he's chose crypto, I think is representative of a lot.
00:50:50.228 - 00:50:52.224, Speaker A: Of founders that I see now that.
00:50:52.524 - 00:50:57.620, Speaker B: Are coming to crypto and they have, like, they could just, you know, sail.
00:50:57.652 - 00:51:03.100, Speaker A: Away into the horizon for the rest of their life because money's, you know, they've just made it and they can do whatever.
00:51:03.172 - 00:51:05.708, Speaker B: But, you know, Mark Andreessen said it.
00:51:05.716 - 00:51:07.468, Speaker A: Best and which is smart people want.
00:51:07.476 - 00:51:09.358, Speaker B: To work on hard problems and want.
00:51:09.366 - 00:51:24.918, Speaker A: To work collectively and build in an open source environment versus a closed one. And I think that is a key hallmark of crypto from a human capital standpoint. And the clustering of that is bar none. Like, that's just a hallmark of was Silicon Valley in the early days, still is.
00:51:24.966 - 00:51:27.870, Speaker B: But like open source in a distributed.
00:51:27.902 - 00:51:36.634, Speaker A: Context, trying to solve really hard problems, account abstraction, zero knowledge proofs, it is just really fascinating stuff. And there remains a lot of unsolved.
00:51:37.294 - 00:51:40.846, Speaker B: Challenges that I think smart people want.
00:51:40.870 - 00:51:49.194, Speaker A: To naturally take up the challenge. And so it's really exciting to see and I think we'll hopefully continue to see more of that trend. Continue?
00:51:49.574 - 00:52:47.802, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw a lot of posts on Twitter that were like, this is just a washed up web two exec who is coming into web3 for a big paycheck and doesn't care about the mission and the tech and NFTs will only be able to succeed as a countercultural movement. And that seems like a very small minded view, I would say. It's like, okay, NFT, like most great movements start as a counter cultural movement and eventually grow past that. So I think things like this, like Visa and then Daniel Allegra joining you guys, their new CEO, are like almost one in the same. In my mind, it's like it's crypto growing up, which has, is bad for the ethos of crypto, probably, but is good for the industry growing up and like getting bigger and like this technology infiltrating, like, industries. So it kind of depends which viewpoint you, you come at it with. I think this is one of the, is probably the biggest hire ever in the NFT space.
00:52:47.802 - 00:52:52.554, Speaker C: I think this is a massive hire. I think it'll be really, really, really good for you guys.
00:52:52.594 - 00:52:59.556, Speaker A: Obviously his, like, you mean it's not kid Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather and some of these folks issuing nfts.
00:52:59.700 - 00:53:27.304, Speaker C: Actually, those are, I was more thinking of Trump issuing nfts. That was the biggest news of the year. Yeah, no, he's got, like, look, he's got, obviously he's got, when you hire someone like this, they don't just come with experience. They come with access to talent. They come with deal flow. They have come with a knowledge of, like, I love that they hired a Coo, not a CEO. Like, he comes with a knowledge of like how to run a massive operation that has billions on their balance sheet.
00:53:27.304 - 00:54:07.984, Speaker C: The bearish view is probably like, he's not scrappy enough for a startup environment. I still, you know, that's a fair counterargument. Like, time will tell. I actually think the more interesting experience is actually not his two years at Activision, it's his 16 years at Google, where he was the company's president of global and strategic partnerships and their president of shopping and payments, as well as their president of Asia Pacific and Latin America. Like, you don't, you don't get those titles at Google unless you can execute. And he did that for 16 years. And like, yeah, so if we're going.
00:54:07.984 - 00:54:27.184, Speaker A: To compete against, yeah, if you're going to compete against and build the real metaverse and try to compete against someone like Facebook, you need to bring in a lieutenant like him. Like, he's general, that you need to, like, muster the collective effort and keep people in line. And I don't think you break the ethos.
00:54:27.604 - 00:54:30.276, Speaker B: I think you just bring discipline of.
00:54:30.300 - 00:54:31.956, Speaker A: How to scale and build an operation.
00:54:32.020 - 00:54:34.636, Speaker B: That is, it's a tall order to.
00:54:34.660 - 00:55:22.752, Speaker A: Build a metaverse, people, if Facebook can't, hasn't successfully done it, and people getting a lot of criticism to assume that a scrappy startup is going to be doing this without, like, Google brought in Eric Schmidt at a right time where the company needed someone like him. And Larry and Sergey took the role that they are creatives, but you need leadership like Eric, who had a ton of experience before coming to Google. And I think Eric was instrumental to Google's continued success over the years and, like, really revamping and, like, bringing on different business lines and bringing structure to an organization that has grown in Alphabet and what it is now and their dominance in the search market, I think Eric played a huge role in that. And I think maybe that's the kind.
00:55:22.768 - 00:55:24.072, Speaker B: Of thing that we'll see here.
00:55:24.248 - 00:55:56.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I sent some texts out just asking about this guy being like, is this guy the real deal? The texts I got back were like, I mean, so here's some things I didn't know that I learned about him. He joined Google to basically create their presence in Latin America. Like, what a crazy initiative. And he joined the year that they launched Gmail. So, like, he's not someone who came in when, like, Google was this massive platform already. I mean, they're already big by 2004, but, like, 2004 that didn't even have Gmail. And I haven't, like, fact checked these dates, I think.
00:55:56.866 - 00:56:48.580, Speaker C: But I think it sounds like 2004 is when they launched Gmail. And so he came in to, like, grow that he did such a good job in Latin America that he then went to Asia and did the same, same thing, opening up their offices in China, India and Southeast Asia, and basically led their mobile expansion into APAC, which is pretty, like, boom. That's crazy in and of itself. Then he led their engagement strategies across news media, entertainment and telco, and created their monetization strategy across maps. So he did that, then had success there, and then went and did that again on the shopping side of the business. So he basically led their, like, global shipping program. And one thing that I got a text about what he did is, like, he was responsible for figuring out their logistics and last mile delivery from their shipping strategy, from their shopping strategy.
00:56:48.580 - 00:57:05.098, Speaker C: Like, anyone who's worked in shipping knows that last mile delivery is one of the most complex things to figure out. So, like, I don't know, when I first saw this, I was like, splashy, higher, not excited. When I. When I dug deeper, I'm like, I think this was a brilliant hire by, by them.
00:57:05.186 - 00:57:07.218, Speaker A: So, yeah, bullish.
00:57:07.266 - 00:57:08.414, Speaker C: Daniel Allegra.
00:57:09.194 - 00:57:12.106, Speaker A: Yep. Daniel, if you're listening, we'd love to have you on the show.
00:57:12.290 - 00:57:18.658, Speaker C: I. I pinged him, didn't get a response, though. Nothing so far.
00:57:18.746 - 00:57:22.338, Speaker A: If someone that knows. Well, maybe someone that knows Daniel, on.
00:57:22.346 - 00:57:25.234, Speaker B: Our behalf, thank you very much.
00:57:25.314 - 00:57:26.334, Speaker A: Happy holidays.
00:57:26.794 - 00:57:32.306, Speaker C: Exactly. Um, any. What else. What else happened this week?
00:57:32.370 - 00:57:32.906, Speaker B: Uh.
00:57:33.010 - 00:57:33.738, Speaker C: Uh.
00:57:33.906 - 00:57:39.346, Speaker A: Should we cover the FTX stuff? DCG and FTX, probably the two things that we can breeze through not to.
00:57:39.370 - 00:57:46.274, Speaker C: Like, I know people you haven't been around the last couple of weeks. Auntie. I'm ridiculously tired of talking about FTX. But we.
00:57:46.314 - 00:58:08.638, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the only thing about FTX is Sam signed the extradition papers. He went to the emergency room. God knows what happened in this prison, which is ranked top five prisons in the world, worst prisons in the world. So I think he changed his course of mind and said, no, I'd rather be in a us jail. So he's now, I think he was boarded a plane yesterday that the US sent. He's in custody by the FBI. He's in the US now.
00:58:08.638 - 00:58:11.914, Speaker A: Trial could be as soon as next Thursday. I believe.
00:58:14.134 - 00:58:17.694, Speaker B: Caroline and Gary, his other.
00:58:17.734 - 00:58:22.788, Speaker A: Co founder, turned against him and are cooperating with the feds, maybe others, potentially.
00:58:22.926 - 00:58:24.264, Speaker B: I don't know what's happening with Sam.
00:58:24.304 - 00:58:55.324, Speaker A: Trabuco, Ryan Salami, some of the other high executives in FTX, and whether they're cooperating with the feds, but, yeah, that's quickly. The rundown and the second the bail was set at a quarter of a billion dollars for SBF, which is an interesting figure when you consider that it coincides closely with the number of funds that were hacked during the whole FTX kind of bankrupt, like, before bankruptcy. So, yeah, I think that's the latest on FTX. The minute on FTX.
00:58:55.744 - 00:59:17.116, Speaker C: I would recommend reading the Southern District of New York's 38 page document on this. Pretty interesting. It comes to light that this wasn't something that began in the bear market. The way that they wrote it, it makes it seem like this is something that's been happening since the beginning of the company's inception, which would be a wild thing, but.
00:59:17.140 - 00:59:24.144, Speaker A: You mean the. The whole Alameda FTX. Alameda, like, getting funds from customer deposits and then using those.
00:59:24.564 - 00:59:37.804, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It makes it seem like there was more than 10 billion that was spent and lost. I would just recommend reading this piece. Yeah. Let's talk about DCG. So, let me pull up Barry's tweet. So, basically.
00:59:37.804 - 01:00:25.458, Speaker C: So, like, as a quick reminder. So you've got Grayscale, subsidiary of DCG. They've been trying to pursue turning their closed end fund, which is GBTC, into a bitcoin spot ETF over the past what feels like many years, and they keep getting rejected by the SEC. So Barry hasn't been too vocal on this in the last couple of weeks, obviously, just because Grayscale and Genesis and DCG are all going through some tough times right now. He tweeted out a Wall Street Journal article that had the caption, if Grayscale's bitcoin ETF Dreams fail, firm may try a tender offer. So, if you dig into this, the options could include a tender offer for up to 20% of the outstanding shares of the $10 billion trust. Which is an interesting number.
01:00:25.458 - 01:00:56.984, Speaker C: Right. 20% of 10 billion, 2 billion. I think that's the size of the hole for Genesis. Right. So what they would do is that would be basically like a direct appeal to shareholders to sell their shares at a specific price. The way I think I see it is that DCG needs a lot of cash to repurchase shares that are trading at what's like a 45% discount to Nav right now. This would help reduce the discount, which would, in turn, improve the health of DCG's book value margin.
01:00:56.984 - 01:01:08.754, Speaker C: Yeah. Some are speculating that DCG needs to sell some of their liquid BTC, or ETH holdings, um, which has the. Well, you know, I don't know that that's more speculation, but I'm curious to get your take on this.
01:01:08.794 - 01:01:12.258, Speaker A: On that, yeah, on that point, it was fairly interesting.
01:01:12.306 - 01:01:17.386, Speaker B: Last Friday, there was a lot of.
01:01:17.410 - 01:01:19.610, Speaker A: The top holdings of DCG took a.
01:01:19.642 - 01:01:24.674, Speaker B: Big hit, like near and all, like Zcash.
01:01:24.754 - 01:01:35.484, Speaker A: And if, like, this may have been people in the market front running what they felt was gonna be DCG, like, offloading a lot of these assets. But I haven't confirmed that they were the seller.
01:01:35.524 - 01:01:38.092, Speaker B: But it does feel like Barry kind.
01:01:38.108 - 01:02:08.854, Speaker A: Of also cryptically tweeted, like, it's happening without saying what was happening on Friday. But look, DC has a history of, like, like, doing trades in low liquid environments. Like, why would you do this on a Friday? Over the weekend, it felt to me like there was gonna be an announcement coming this week around, like, the bankruptcy, maybe forced bankruptcy. It felt like the last straw for them to, like, recoup some capital and liquidity. But, yeah, it's really interesting. A lot of people in the market are also trading around the assets that DCG has. Maybe an anticipation of knowing that they're going to have to be a four seller at some point.
01:02:08.854 - 01:02:09.670, Speaker A: So they're shorting them.
01:02:09.702 - 01:02:14.086, Speaker B: And so, yeah, a lot of noise. But I do think that it was.
01:02:14.110 - 01:02:25.570, Speaker A: Interesting that a lot of the assets that DCG holds are taking an abnormally higher beating than the rest of the market. And this has been a fairly common trend this year.
01:02:25.602 - 01:02:25.770, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:25.802 - 01:03:05.768, Speaker A: When, like, people get access to, they sign in NDA, they get access to, like, the. The book of a particular distressed player, and then they short that. Right. In this case, DCG is very public around the assets that it has on the liquid side especially. So, yeah, it's, I think, a narrative to watch, and a trend to watch is, as you look at all the carcasses of this year and what they hold and what maybe a bankruptcy court is going to have to settle or sell, these are assets that are going to probably underperform. And we know the portfolios of a lot of the players, like, three arrows and other funds in the space are going to have to liquidate.
01:03:05.936 - 01:03:20.414, Speaker C: Yep. You think Genesis makes, like, what happens with the whole DCG business? Like, does. Basically, does DCG end next year with genesis, grayscale, coindesk?
01:03:22.714 - 01:03:26.370, Speaker A: When you mean ends, like, they cease to operate and exist? They shut down?
01:03:26.442 - 01:03:27.058, Speaker B: No, not.
01:03:27.146 - 01:03:32.614, Speaker C: And, like, do they, what, what happens to these assets? Like, do they sell any of them off? Do they, like, what are they.
01:03:33.274 - 01:04:09.942, Speaker A: I think there's going to be a restructuring, maybe a consolidation of what the crown jewel of this business is, which continues to be, you know, the 200, 300 million of ARR that they get on management fees on the grayscale products. From an incentive standpoint, I think it's unless he really has to get, like he's not going to want to give that up. And by he I mean bury. So who knows? I am not very optimistic that this will be converted into an ETF until we get, until the whole SPF and other regulatory stuff comes out and gets clarified and codified.
01:04:10.038 - 01:04:12.396, Speaker B: I don't think that would be seeing.
01:04:12.420 - 01:04:20.332, Speaker A: An ETF anytime soon. And so for that reason, I think that grayscale continues to earn that nice fee and recurring cash flow there.
01:04:20.508 - 01:04:23.652, Speaker B: On the genesis side, I don't think.
01:04:23.668 - 01:04:28.732, Speaker A: I need too many predictions, which I'm terrible at. But yeah, I think someone will have.
01:04:28.748 - 01:04:31.544, Speaker B: To step in because I'm not using.
01:04:32.724 - 01:04:48.858, Speaker A: Even though certain parts of their business continue to operate, I think damage has been done and on a reputation standpoint, it's hard from the fiduciary standpoint as an trying to work with them right now, I think a huge void in.
01:04:48.866 - 01:04:55.414, Speaker B: The market has been probably going to be filled and the next DCD will emerge.
01:04:56.594 - 01:05:05.320, Speaker A: Liquidity is really dry right now, continue to be dry. So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what you think. I don't have much insight here.
01:05:05.482 - 01:05:10.476, Speaker C: No, I agree with that. I don't have much insight. Yeah.
01:05:10.580 - 01:05:14.864, Speaker A: Are you buying coindesk? Not to put you on the spot, but.
01:05:17.004 - 01:05:20.144, Speaker C: No, no, not at $300 million.
01:05:20.884 - 01:05:22.940, Speaker A: And folks, this is where we close around up.
01:05:23.012 - 01:05:23.944, Speaker B: No, I'm kidding.
01:05:25.964 - 01:05:40.366, Speaker C: There's one other piece of news here, which binance is acquiring Voyagers assets, I think so FTX offered 1.22 billion. Right? 1.2. And this bid comes in at like one I think was the bid.
01:05:40.430 - 01:05:41.646, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:05:41.750 - 01:05:45.126, Speaker A: 1.01 or whatever, which I think in bankruptcy.
01:05:45.150 - 01:05:54.950, Speaker C: How it works is it you have to pay the fair market value of the assets, right. At today's current prices plus some sort of fee. It's not a normal bidding process.
01:05:55.022 - 01:05:55.634, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:56.414 - 01:05:56.702, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:56.718 - 01:05:58.980, Speaker B: I'm not as familiar, but I think.
01:05:59.012 - 01:06:01.196, Speaker A: That that's right from what I read.
01:06:01.380 - 01:06:28.992, Speaker C: Yeah. No, man, I don't think we're not buying coindesk. I do think there will be consolidation in the crypto media space. Right now. You have a lot of players. You have like, I mean, you were on vacation when all the stuff with the block came out, but like right now you have blockworks in the block and coindesk and decrypt and Cointelegraph and defiant and NFT now and all these media companies. I would assume that that probably shrinks to three.
01:06:29.088 - 01:06:38.936, Speaker A: Well, me, yeah, I do think. Well, I saw the blocks, though, like a video share shattering to see how that one of the co founders, like, had taken in a huge loan from SPF.
01:06:39.000 - 01:06:40.712, Speaker C: Not, not co founder, actually not co.
01:06:40.728 - 01:07:00.100, Speaker A: Founder, but sorry, it stepped in as CEO. Yeah, pretty crazy, the amount of interconnectedness. That's something that I did not expect. But yeah, we'll talk about that more tomorrow on predictions and maybe really excited. I spent a lot of time.
01:07:00.132 - 01:07:01.824, Speaker C: Do you have a prediction about crypto media?
01:07:03.084 - 01:07:03.980, Speaker B: I think you're right.
01:07:04.052 - 01:07:08.596, Speaker A: There's going to be huge consolidation. Not huge, but these businesses tend to.
01:07:08.620 - 01:07:13.724, Speaker B: Shine and are kind of secular, irrespective of market prices.
01:07:13.804 - 01:07:17.866, Speaker A: And sometimes interest gross a lot during bear market, and there's a lot to cover.
01:07:18.010 - 01:07:18.698, Speaker B: Like a lot.
01:07:18.746 - 01:07:25.346, Speaker A: I mean, movies are going to be made out of this stuff. And I think it bodes well for crypto media. I think it's a great asset not.
01:07:25.370 - 01:07:27.154, Speaker B: To like, pump your bags or anything.
01:07:27.194 - 01:07:42.334, Speaker A: But I think we're going to see some consolidation. Maybe people entering the space want to have exposure to crypto. Crypto media feels like a good, like a good play to capture the growth in the space without taking a particular view on prices.
01:07:42.734 - 01:08:29.570, Speaker C: It's been interesting hiring, actually right now because, so if you look back a year ago, it was really hard to hire for anyone in crypto, but it was really hard for us to hire because if you're an applicant, you look at media company versus big exchange or go work at a fund or something like that, and it's really hard to hire because media is probably more boring, I would say, on paper, than working at some crazy crypto startup that just raised $20 million. And now I will say hiring has been. Has been the best hiring market. Like, the number of amazing, like, ten out of ten people that are joining blockwork starting in January actually is like at a record high. And it's because it's like, people like, you know, it doesn't matter if markets are going up or down. Like, you still need information businesses.
01:08:29.602 - 01:08:36.026, Speaker A: So some fascinating reporting to be done and investigative journalism. And, yeah, that's coined.
01:08:36.090 - 01:08:42.768, Speaker C: Like, Coindesk has. I mean, blockworks has had amazing journalism. Like, Coindesk kicked this off with Ian Allison story. So big shout outs.
01:08:42.816 - 01:08:43.576, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:08:43.720 - 01:08:44.072, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:08:44.128 - 01:08:44.296, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:44.320 - 01:08:59.952, Speaker A: No, this is like a great movie, as we always end episodes with, like, great book and movie recommendations around journalism. One of my favorites is the pelican brief. Great novel, but moving to about, like, water huge. There's another documentary that is on the plane, which talks about like, the erosion.
01:08:59.968 - 01:09:02.496, Speaker B: Of journalism across the world, and it.
01:09:02.520 - 01:09:15.598, Speaker A: Covers different markets, Brazil, Mexico, the US, and how so many, like, towns have, like newspapers have shut down and so they don't have, like, coverage. And that's huge.
01:09:15.646 - 01:09:15.878, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:15.926 - 01:09:17.478, Speaker A: I think the role of media, a.
01:09:17.486 - 01:09:19.286, Speaker B: Lot of times we talk about there's.
01:09:19.310 - 01:09:44.146, Speaker A: This growing distrust of media, of fake news. But I do still think that it's worth revisiting. Like, media plays a huge role in empowering civic participation and keeping checks and balances in place of, like, arming citizens with information. The problem is a lot of citizens don't trust the quality and the veracity of that information. But I do think that, like, there is a huge opportunity, and I think.
01:09:44.170 - 01:09:46.634, Speaker B: You'Re seeing it in crypto, where independent.
01:09:46.674 - 01:09:54.258, Speaker A: Journalism, there's a place for that and voices can be heard and it brings to light, like, really remarkable stuff.
01:09:54.306 - 01:09:56.770, Speaker B: And it really, I think media is.
01:09:56.802 - 01:10:17.628, Speaker A: Going through this transition in the same way that it went from traditional print to online and the New York Times kind of getting ahead of that curve and really reinventing their businesses and others not, and failing. But yeah, it's, this maybe could be just a whole episode in of itself because you're advantage. Like, you're in a great vantage point to understand the transition that not just media for crypto, but just media in.
01:10:17.676 - 01:10:28.334, Speaker B: General because it's not going to go away. But how do you regain trust and how do you keep reporting the truth?
01:10:29.194 - 01:10:49.694, Speaker A: Because I think that's where most people will continue to get their information and it's not going to be in social media. I think maybe it's a combination. Maybe it's some sort of different hybrid, but yeah, it's, it's super important. And I think media and so many people are just not in a good spot in terms of where they're getting information.
01:10:51.694 - 01:10:52.834, Speaker C: Completely agree.
01:10:53.334 - 01:10:53.750, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:10:53.782 - 01:10:57.094, Speaker C: And good. Final. Any book here? What?
01:10:57.134 - 01:10:57.590, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:10:57.702 - 01:11:06.714, Speaker A: Before any, any books or movies, I think this other, that I have to say this is the best time of year to watch Harry Potter. If you don't like.
01:11:07.454 - 01:11:09.582, Speaker C: It's always a good time of the year to watch Harry Potter for you.
01:11:09.598 - 01:11:50.504, Speaker A: Something, you know what I mean? Like, but like Christmas is particularly like special to go back and watch Harry Potter. I will say if you're tired of, in a crazy world, you get tired of the normal mood. There was the 20th year reunion documentary that was made and launched earlier this year. I actually watched it again on a flight. It's great. It's really, really neat, this 20th anniversary of Harry Potter and a really good insight, look into the different characters and how you just get their perspective. So I'd encourage everyone to go and see that.
01:11:52.764 - 01:12:11.940, Speaker C: I just started. I, so I just finished the Teddy Roosevelt book about going down the Amazon for the first time. And he's like an absolute maniac. And I want to read. He's a just nuts. Like he ran for president third time lost, went down the Amazon river when he's like 50 with his son. Got sue, everyone got super sick.
01:12:11.940 - 01:12:27.042, Speaker C: Like, there were like, yeah, native crazy book. I just started George Friedman's book called the Storm, the storm before the calm. And that is I'm twelve pages in, so I can't report back. But that is.
01:12:27.138 - 01:12:28.098, Speaker A: What's that about.
01:12:28.266 - 01:12:55.766, Speaker C: Basically, it's like the coming crisis of the 2020s. Like, I think it's a little need more fear. Love doomsday. I just, I'm leaning into the. No, it's like it's, it's a, it's a geopolitical book about like how everything's changing. I have a feeling it's gonna be a bit doomsday, a bit like if you've ever read the fourth turning, like, I think it's like in that same category. But it's come highly recommended from a couple, couple macro nerds that I love.
01:12:55.766 - 01:12:57.074, Speaker C: So. Yeah.
01:12:57.574 - 01:13:04.756, Speaker A: Okay. Fantastic. Is this a good time to wrap it up and save our energy for tomorrow's big episode?
01:13:04.950 - 01:13:06.964, Speaker C: This is a good time.
01:13:08.384 - 01:13:23.576, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, it's great to be back and hope everyone is doing well out there. If you're traveling for the holidays, hope you get home safe and in time. And we'll be back tomorrow with our yearly predictions, which was going to be a really fun episode. I'm looking forward to.
01:13:23.720 - 01:13:27.136, Speaker C: Indeed. All right, my friend. See you on the other side, my friend.
01:13:27.280 - 01:13:27.720, Speaker A: Yep.
01:13:27.792 - 01:13:28.368, Speaker B: Take care.
01:13:28.456 - 01:13:31.404, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. I.
