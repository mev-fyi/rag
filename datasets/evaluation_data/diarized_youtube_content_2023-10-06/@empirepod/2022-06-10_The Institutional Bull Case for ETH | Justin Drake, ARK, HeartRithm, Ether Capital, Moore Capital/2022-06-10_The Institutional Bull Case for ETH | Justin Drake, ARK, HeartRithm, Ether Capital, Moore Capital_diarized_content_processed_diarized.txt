00:00:01.680 - 00:00:17.934, Speaker A: Okay, so this panel is about the bull case for ETH for institutions. Basically the stories that we can tell institutions so that they get excited about ETH, I guess. Shall we go through a quick round of intros, starting with Frank?
00:00:18.054 - 00:00:18.714, Speaker B: Sure.
00:00:19.934 - 00:00:21.034, Speaker C: Mine was all.
00:00:23.574 - 00:00:35.934, Speaker B: Can you hear me okay. Hey, everybody, I'm Frank. I'm a crypto analyst at Ark invest. We're best known as public equity ETF manager, but we've also been actively researching crypto since 2015.
00:00:36.794 - 00:00:37.322, Speaker A: Hi, everyone.
00:00:37.378 - 00:01:02.254, Speaker D: My name is Greg Kaufman. I work at heart rhythm. We are a $90 million crypto yield fund. We are. It's a quantitative orientation designed to be market neutral. We also have a social impact orientation, where 5% of our performance fees go towards impact, and that will scale to 50% as we get to a billion dollars. I was running around in traditional finance for 15 years before joining this firm, so I'm very happy to be here in my polo shirt and sneakers.
00:01:02.914 - 00:01:22.894, Speaker C: My name's Brian Mosoff. I run a company called Ether Capital. I think we're one of the biggest public companies holding ETH on our balance sheet and also staking a meaningful portion of it. We're staking just over $100 million right now of ETH, and we helped, alongside purpose investments, launch the world's first bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's in Canada. Actual spot ETF's.
00:01:29.114 - 00:01:59.244, Speaker E: Can you hear me? My name is Sam Jernigan. I started my career at JpMorgan. I was in proprietary trading until the Volcker rule. I've worked at a few different macro funds. I started the first macro fund that could trade. Can you hear me? I started the first macro fund that could trade crypto from Mike Novogratz's family office during the bear market of 2018. And then I joined more capital in early 21 to build out liquid crypto.
00:01:59.904 - 00:02:14.404, Speaker A: Okay, great. So my opening question is, how sophisticated are institutions? Are we very early in the game? Is this an opportunity for maybe retail to front run institutions as opposed to what usually happens?
00:02:17.044 - 00:03:16.284, Speaker D: I can talk to that. So, at heart rhythm, we run educational webinars three times per month, and it's defi focused on DeFi for institutions, DeFi for family offices, DeFi for wealth managers, that they're an hour long. 90% of it is educational about DeFi, which involves a lot of talk about Ethereum, given that 65% of total value locked is based on the Ethereum Ethereum blockchain, and 10% is about our firm. And we're having over 200 people register for each of these webinars and 60 to 90 people attending live. We're raising about $5 million per month from an average of nine different people or groups. And for the first, and that's over the last five months, I would say it's mostly been from high net worth individuals that are tech executives or crypto native or single family offices. Over the last two months, we've seen a lot of interest from corporate treasuries, wealth managers, and funda funds in terms of pensions, endowments, foundations.
00:03:16.284 - 00:03:46.952, Speaker D: The more typical institutions that we all would think of, they are dialing into the webinars and maybe booking a one on one meeting. But I think allocations from them are another six to nine months away. And I think the events of last week have helped push that out further. There are some crypto forward institutions that already have allocations or have already done the work and are using the sell off to buy into the market now, I'd say, but those are in the minority.
00:03:47.128 - 00:04:08.244, Speaker C: I would just add that I think it's still early for the Ethereum narrative. Retail is buying ETH, but institutions first. The asset that they were focused on was bitcoin. Bitcoin has a very clean and simple narrative. Ethereum, in a lot of conversations, requires more imagination. Here's going to be this platform with all this really interesting activity. What kind of activity? Well, you could do that.
00:04:08.244 - 00:04:56.662, Speaker C: You have to really help people understand why people would want to use Ethereum. But I find it's really helpful in these educational seminars because we run a lot of them as well. You look at a website like cryptofees, dot in Fo, and you just see just enormous usage on Ethereum. And what I like about that website is to help them say, listen, you may not understand what the specific activity is, and some of it will be a spectrum of, on this side, stable coins and traditional businesses using a blockchain, and then you're going to have crypto native activities. But if you just abstract all that away and look at the daily fees, there's no question that Ethereum has a lot of activity on it. And so I think that their first focus on bitcoin, but they're starting to do their homework. And then I think as we switch to proof of stake, and you can take these, you know, unproductive commodities and turn it into a yield generating instrument.
00:04:56.662 - 00:05:17.714, Speaker C: That is a big narrative, along with the ESG story that a lot of these institutions are focused on or have mandates in their funds of what they can and can't hold, or how they have to evaluate things. That's really bullish for Ethereum. And I think you're right that we're still three months, six months, nine months away from them really waking up and saying, hey, this is an asset we need to pay attention to.
00:05:18.134 - 00:06:03.020, Speaker B: I think it's also really important to define institution because institutions exist across the space spectrum, right? Like, there's a large number of crypto native hedge funds that are executing really advanced trading strategies, but there's also state pension funds that are going to be a lot slower to move into this because they're risk averse for a variety of reasons. One example, I recently heard Anthony Lewis, who's a director of blockchain at Temasek, which is a singaporean sovereign wealth fund, and he described trying to introduce crypto to their asset management book. And you get all these red flags that get raised instantly. We don't know how to account for this. We don't know how it's treated for tax purposes. We don't know how to custody it. And so he thought, and there's the risk, right? This could go to zero in a matter of days like we saw last week.
00:06:03.020 - 00:06:29.774, Speaker B: And so he said, okay, ignore the volatility risk. Let's start with just one ether and just try in custody one ether. And so he made a business case. He went to the product team, he went to the accounting team, he went to the legal team, he went to the compliance team and did all this work and eventually got them to custody one ether. And that took over a year. And so you talk about slower moving. The retail investor can download metamask and get access to thousands of assets instantly.
00:06:29.774 - 00:06:34.430, Speaker B: So retail is advantaged. Institutions are slower in one end of the spectrum, but not all ends.
00:06:34.582 - 00:06:41.366, Speaker D: That's amazing. We should white paper that and put it out there. I love it. Just the exercise of doing that for an institution is fantastic.
00:06:41.430 - 00:06:48.170, Speaker B: Yeah. And the beauty of it is, once you custody one ether, that's no different than custodying 1000 either, right? It scales.
00:06:48.282 - 00:06:49.994, Speaker D: Is that institution's name public or.
00:06:50.074 - 00:06:51.494, Speaker B: Yeah, it's Temasek.
00:06:53.394 - 00:07:47.792, Speaker E: So can you hear me? So I have a lot of conversations, either at Wall Street Denners, hosted by my friend Christine, for example, or I do a lot of calls with other investors, other hedge funds, other asset managers. I think it is still very early. The events of this past week in particular have driven that point home to me. I was getting calls, questions from people where they didn't realize there was a difference between Ponzi ust a fiat stablecoin like USDC or Daisy. Some people just quickly were like, oh, dies, just like Ponzi ust. I'm like, no, it's not. They're like, but it's under collateralized.
00:07:47.792 - 00:08:29.538, Speaker E: I'm like, no, it's over collateralized. And I was shocked by that, to be honest. That was a surprising takeaway. I think in general, though, at a high level for sophisticated Wall street investors, they know that Ethereum is different, that it's a cryptocurrency with some utility. But I think where individual investors have an advantage is that they're actually taking time to engage with the Ethereum protocol. And so they know that utility, they appreciate it, they know that it's different. Whereas I think, unfortunately, most of us on Wall street, there's so many different assets and so many other things going on.
00:08:29.538 - 00:09:02.564, Speaker E: In some cases, there are compliance that don't let you actually even use this stuff, believe it or not, or own it at a lot of firms, which prevents the learning process, unfortunately. So Wall street is still very early from a perspective of understanding the space. And I think also unfortunately, like retail, they tend to be easily sold on lower quality new projects. If it's new, it must be good. Wall street and retail, I think, are overly sucked into that unfortunate cycle.
00:09:03.104 - 00:09:35.844, Speaker A: Okay, so if I were to summarize, there's a wide spectrum of different institutions, some of them sophisticated, but for the most part, we're very, very early. So I guess what I suggest we do in this discussion is kind of start with the most basic narratives and kind of walk our way through to some of the more complicated ones. So, I mean, for me, one of the, the most simple, the simplest narrative is like owning Eve is like owning a share of the Internet of value. Is that a narrative you agree with, or do you have something even simpler than that?
00:09:38.344 - 00:10:49.170, Speaker E: Can you hear me? I 100% agree with that. In fact, I try to remind people when, for example, crypto is trading very sensitive to macro, that you're taking a big risk by reducing exposure for some unrelated macro causality, because you may not be able to get back in. And there's a you stand to lose significantly if you do not own your piece of the future global settlement layer. And maybe that's ETH, maybe that's another blockchain, but that's a risk if you decide to reduce exposure aggressively because you're worried about some exogenous factor. And I think that there are investors that have realized this. You've seen a lot of institutions actually begin staking to the beacon chain where they're thinking about ETH in particular. But also Solana and other assets as more of a vc type investment, where they kind of want to prevent themselves from trading it to some extent, where they want to kind of put it in another bucket.
00:10:49.322 - 00:11:34.334, Speaker C: I, like you just said, this global settlement layer, and often when I'm talking to people who are new to the space or fund managers I described, the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is bitcoin is a settlement layer to clear one asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum is this settlement layer to clear any activity. And as I was saying before, there's a spectrum, and the spectrum can be crypto native activity. The spectrum can include stable coins, and then there could be tokenized version of stocks, bonds, things that will come from traditional finance later. And so the exciting part about Ethereum is that you're capturing all of that value into one platform. And so it's this global settlement layer that's politically neutral that anyone can plug into, regardless of the type of activity they're trying to perform.
00:11:34.994 - 00:12:00.772, Speaker A: Right. So Ethereum, ether basically becomes this index asset and abstracts away all the complexity of the activity. So I guess if you've convinced an institution that they want a share of this settlement platform for the Internet of value, what's the next step? What's the execution like? What is the simplest way for them to buy in custody? Ethan.
00:12:00.788 - 00:12:32.214, Speaker C: Okay, I guess my microphone is up. I think that ETF's are the easiest access point for them. They already are able to purchase ETF's for any other asset, so it's the cleanest and easiest. I think one thing that changed in the bull run of, I guess, starting the second half of 2020, is there weren't access points, really, for people who weren't tech native prior to 2020. The only way you could buy crypto is signing up on an exchange. Maybe it was regulated. Maybe it wasn't regulated.
00:12:32.214 - 00:13:03.902, Speaker C: Take possession in a self hosted wallet, trust the exchange, and ETF's did change that game because it gave an access point to a different set of investors who couldn't find a way to do custody or how they would buy it. And they just wanted directional exposure to the price of the assets, and they didn't have them before. So I think ETF's will be certainly a catalyst, and then over time, I mean, I don't know that we'll see funds custody, taking possession of the assets themselves. I don't know that they want to take on that risk, but I would say structured products is really the first access point for them.
00:13:04.038 - 00:13:04.286, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:04.310 - 00:13:27.034, Speaker B: As an asset manager in the public equity space. We experienced this. We would love to hold ether, but we can't. And we got our first exposure to bitcoin in 2015 through buying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which isn't a great vehicle to get exposure. And we had to get a special letter from the SEC just to do that based on prospectus of our fund. And so these barriers coming down like an ETF makes a big difference.
00:13:30.954 - 00:14:03.934, Speaker E: When I launched the macro fund in 2018 to trade liquid crypto, that was difficult because there wasn't qualified custodians. Coinbase actually had institutional coverage. They shut it down, and then they restarted it because they thought it had died. Christine Sandler, who ran it the first time, ended up leaving, and she went to fidelity. So it was difficult at that time. It was very hard. Insurance policies didn't exist.
00:14:03.934 - 00:14:52.726, Speaker E: You know, we didn't have as robust a framework for extraction windows and delays and all these type of things. I think that. I mean, frankly, I think that if you're very careful and you choose high quality counterparties, you should be able to. To hold safely and even stake and participate in the network ETH in particular. One thing I would say, though, I think that I thought that this example where he talked about demasek doing one look, sometimes that's the best way to start, and the organization finds out it's not as scary as they thought it was. And I think that that's a great, a great path. A lot of places should try that again.
00:14:52.726 - 00:15:25.434, Speaker E: You're running a risk if you don't. I think that there's going to be a panic, by the way, from the banks at some point, because you've noticed of the last 24 months, the banks have woken up, that fintechs snuck in underneath them. And a lot of, I think JPMorgan in particular has been making some kind of last minute acquisitions in the fintech space. I think the banks are going to wake up and realize, oh, my God, wait a minute, this network has done more transactions than visa last year. And remember, the banks own visa and Mastercard. They launched those networks. They were the largest primary shareholders.
00:15:25.434 - 00:15:34.634, Speaker E: And I think that you may see a panic moment at some point in the future where the banks realize that they don't own that share of the future. Settlement letter.
00:15:35.414 - 00:15:56.084, Speaker D: I was talking to one of the custodians yesterday, and they have 500 institutional investors, 80 of them were more funds than pensions or family offices. And he said they have relationships with 30 or 40 different exchanges. And he made it sound like it wasn't that difficult. You can buy your ether on one of the exchanges and then custody it with them. I don't know the mechanics of that.
00:15:56.704 - 00:16:08.804, Speaker A: Okay, so, to summarize, it was really, really difficult a few years ago, but it's becoming increasingly simple. We have the exchanges, we have the ETF's and the futures. Yeah.
00:16:08.844 - 00:16:27.356, Speaker E: So a lot of large funds that have not yet gotten to where they want to do either an account with Coinbase or a similar fund where they don't like the fact that grayscale trades at this discount and blah, blah, blah, they will use the CME futures because that's well within the regulatory framework.
00:16:27.420 - 00:17:01.470, Speaker A: Okay. I guess in terms of staying with the simple narratives, I think everyone understands that the merge is huge in terms of reducing the power consumption. And I guess my question is, on a scale from one to ten, how much of this is it an unlock in terms of reducing friction for institutions to buy in? Are there internal policies around ESG that are currently preventing institutions, and are we going to see that the merge being a new wave of institutions coming in?
00:17:01.662 - 00:17:40.393, Speaker C: I would say that the merge in terms of the energy consumption is a little bit helpful to some funds that have ESG mandates. I think a bigger thing is the transaction fees and the ability to participate in the network usage is a big deal and generating the yield. So for funds and institutions that take a long, or I guess, a low time preference to these assets to generate, probably on the low end, 4%, on the top end, 20%, and maybe it turns into a blended rate of seven or 8%. I mean, that's a big deal. I think that is going to be the thing that wakes them up and says, we need exposure here, and we're going to find an access point.
00:17:40.853 - 00:18:09.050, Speaker D: I would agree with that wholeheartedly. I also think there's a huge element of a lot of institutional investors waiting for post merge, because even if it's a 0.1% chance that this doesn't go well, they're going to wait. Especially in light of the events that happened last week. I think the ESG narrative is important. It's definitely going to help. And in my experience, having worked for a firm that did a lot in ESG, was also minority owned.
00:18:09.050 - 00:18:21.794, Speaker D: I always found those things to be tiebreakers in terms of allocations versus stuff that would win allocations. Occasionally you could win in an allocation, but it was all about the performance of the firm or the asset.
00:18:22.174 - 00:19:04.784, Speaker A: Okay, so to summarize, ESG maybe is a tiebreaker, but not the primary consideration. There's more important considerations, such as the staking yield as well as the execution risk that comes with the merge. So maybe days, weeks, months after the merge is when we will see more interest focusing on the merge event. One of the narratives, the memes, is the triple havening. And the reason is that the issuance will go through the equivalent of three bitcoin havenings. So each bitcoin happening occurs every four years, and it's a halving of the issuance. And we're roughly going to have an eight x reduction in the issuance.
00:19:04.784 - 00:19:12.324, Speaker A: For institutions that are, I guess, familiar with bitcoin happenings, is that a compelling narrative?
00:19:17.464 - 00:19:59.244, Speaker E: I think that it was definitely something they were focused on last year. It had a lot of traction. I think crypto is very out of favor on Wall street right now. I mean, people are kind of borderline panicked. I mean, I get just weird calls and questions from people. I think that it's obviously, I think what's most important is that that reduction issuance be rational and not manufactured. And for me it is the most beautiful and perfect rational transition.
00:19:59.244 - 00:21:00.186, Speaker E: One of the points that I often point out to Justin, I asked him to talk about a lot more. So I'm going to do it, which is that it's important to realize that Ethereum is about to undergo a massive productivity boom. And that will coincide perfectly with the reduction in issuance, which also has benefits to the sustainability of consensus longer term, under a proof of stake system, with the reduction of that issuance. So the economic design, I give a lot of credit to the community and I think some of it has come together coincidentally. But I give a lot of credit to the community for the thoughtful and just. It is precision perfect in terms of the way that rollups are going to provide a hundred x scale at the same time that issuance is going to come down. And proof of stake stake, ideally to prevent existing holders of ETH from accumulating too much over the very long term.
00:21:00.186 - 00:22:00.862, Speaker E: You want a low nominal issuance, and ideally in Ethereum's design, you're going to have validators paid in real yield rather than in nominal returns, which is very important, again, to keep the system decentralized. So I do not think that people, again, I think that they kind of got this bitcoin halving idea late last year. Institutions, they've kind of forgotten about it. Everybody's worried about the fed and macro. I think that when I point out this productivity boom, I try to remind people about greenspans during the nineties when he was able to keep interest rates low because of the Internet revolution. It's a similar type of sweet spot that Ethereum is going through, and I don't think it is being fully appreciated now, but I think it will be probably coincident with and after the merge. There are a lot of Wall street banks now that are starting to write thoughtfully about Ethereum and the merge in particular.
00:22:00.862 - 00:22:02.434, Speaker E: And I think some of that will come out.
00:22:03.574 - 00:22:56.414, Speaker B: If I could add one more, I think this is probably a controversial opinion, but probably worth saying. But in our view at least, proof of stake consensus is inherently more centralizing in the token holder base than proof of work. In proof of work, you have new issuance going to miners, and those miners are using off chain resources to validate transactions and provide security and consensus. And when they earn this new on chain asset, they have to sell that to the market to pay for those off chain resources that they committed to the chain. And so you have a token new issuance that is being distributed over time to new buyers rather than the existing holders of wealth and resources. And I think you have this for selling behavior that's going away with the merge, which is great for the actual token price. But if you look at the token holder base rather than those assets being sold to new holders, the new issuance goes to the existing holders.
00:22:56.414 - 00:23:39.294, Speaker B: And so you see this over time with a lot of existing proof of stake change. You also see it with Ethereum right now with the stake centralizing with exchanges and with Lido, for example, which is over 30% of the stakeholder. So that's concerning in a way, but it's also great for Ethereum being the only proof of stake chain that's reaching proof of stake after being proof of work first. So the chain has been around for almost seven years and has had seven years to decentralize this token holder base, whereas every other proof of stake network has this venture capital money with lockups and cliffs that have a much more centralized holder base. And so I think it's a trade off, but it's a trade off that Ethereum is well positioned to be positioned for.
00:23:39.674 - 00:24:10.684, Speaker D: And just real quick, when talking to institutional investors, I might use slightly different language. Instead of using triple halvening, I would say the supply is going to be reduced at heart rhythm. We talk about our fund as a crypto yield fund, not a crypto token fund. So people, institutional investors are familiar with yield and fixed income, and their mind goes in that direction. We might be talking about this later, but you can actually do a DCF on ether because there's revenues attached with it. And explaining that to someone that has an equity mindset is helpful.
00:24:10.984 - 00:24:17.720, Speaker C: I saw Justin Smirk. I think he wants to add something about bitcoin and Ethereum centralization. So I saw that smirk.
00:24:17.872 - 00:24:18.544, Speaker A: What do you want to try?
00:24:18.584 - 00:24:19.408, Speaker B: Please go ahead.
00:24:19.536 - 00:24:20.752, Speaker C: Justin's just waiting.
00:24:20.888 - 00:24:59.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to respond to Frank. So basically, as a designer, I had a realization recently that the force selling is independent of proof of work and proof of stake. And you can basically simulate the force selling in the context of proof of stake. So in the proof of stake system, we have, for example, in ethereum, we have half a million ETH issuance per year, down from 5 million ETH per year. And so what you could do, if you wanted to, is you could just artificially issue 4.5 million ETH per year and just feed it to a uniswap pool. And that would be like artificial for selling.
00:24:59.134 - 00:25:44.344, Speaker A: I mean, the other kind of counter argument is that there is some for selling, even in the context of staking, because you have to pay your income taxes, right, because the rewards are income in most jurisdictions. But this is. I digress, I guess. Sam, you mentioned that, you know, the reduction in issuance maybe was appreciated some time ago, but maybe is not appreciated today. What if we combine the reduction issuance with the really healthy amount of fee volume and the burn, and we combine that into a new narrative where basically the ultrasound money narrative where the supply starts going down, is that something that's attractive to institutions?
00:25:45.624 - 00:26:37.378, Speaker E: This is where Ethereum is a unique asset. So ETH does not have any competition in this realm. I mean, somebody was mentioning the crypto fees chart earlier, there is no competition. None of the other blockchains are used that much. And to the degree that they are, there are very high inflation to subsidize those transactions. And I think what this perfect economic equilibrium is creating on Ethereum is where you have real economic activity that is driving the reduction of what is currently 4.5% inflation down to about 2% via the burning of transaction fees.
00:26:37.378 - 00:27:57.564, Speaker E: After the merge, when inflation goes down by 90% or issuance goes down by 90%, you'll then enter a period where Ethereum becomes a real yielding asset at the same time that you're having this massive productivity boom. And there simply is no, there is no competition. And I think this is a point that is just starting to get out there. It is critically important that the economic design, and I think it is perfectly set up, but the economic design accrue value to the underlying base layer or to ethereum. And the reason why is because for a friend like Christine and other people like Drew, who used to be at Goldman, who have really done amazing work in terms of trying to deploy real financial activity onto a, the most robust chain that we have, ethereum. Ethereum's market cap, for example, would need to be in the trillions in order to credibly secure the types of economic activities that I think that probably most people in this room don't appreciate are already being toyed with. But that can very easily start to take place more regularly.
00:27:58.604 - 00:28:27.240, Speaker B: I think this is a big learning experience for institutions. I think there's a crypto aware investor that looks at Ethereum and says, well, high fees. Why isn't avalanche or solana better? And it's important to help them understand where the fees are coming from. And it's demand for block space. It's not an inefficient design. There's a fixed supply of block space, and there's a very high demand to settle on Ethereum. And that's why people are willing to pay for that block space.
00:28:27.240 - 00:28:41.644, Speaker B: If you have the same utilization and the same desire to pay on other chains, you might see higher fees. And the trade off is you may have a higher supply over there, but it's a sacrifice of decentralization at the core layer in terms of how much it costs to actually operate the network.
00:28:42.024 - 00:29:10.564, Speaker A: So talking about this demand for block space and this issuance, maybe there's a way to rephrase that in terms that institutions are comfortable with, which is namely revenue. The burn is revenue and issuance is expenses. I guess a question for Greg is, now that we have this very clear revenue and very clear expense, does this mean that we can reuse some of the models that we use, for example, for equity?
00:29:11.344 - 00:29:40.672, Speaker D: So my colleague Ryan Alice, who couldn't make it today, he put together one of the first dcfs on Ethereum. He presented it on bankless, I think, in January or the beginning of February. And it's a very popular episode. You can find it on YouTube. And we also, we have a sister organization called Coinstack, which is a podcast and a newsletter. And yes, he ran a DCF. There's definitely some assumptions in there.
00:29:40.672 - 00:30:22.574, Speaker D: I think the current DCF that he, he ran has Ethereum at $6,200. So what you do is you take the revenue from Ethereum, for example, in April it was $507 million. You times it by twelve, that gets you to $6 billion. You put a discount rate in there, and then you make some assumptions in terms of how it grows. And I'm still curious as to whether, how that would be received by someone that has a. An equity analyst type role at an institution. I was talking to someone that is very senior at a $30 billion pension plan yesterday about this concept, and she said she was open to taking a look at the DCF model.
00:30:22.574 - 00:30:34.294, Speaker D: This is the beginning stages of it. I joined heart rhythm relatively recently, so I personally want to try this concept more with investors.
00:30:34.814 - 00:31:16.826, Speaker E: It does resonate. It does resonate. And just to state the obvious, you cannot do a DCF on any other, on any other blockchain or asset because it doesn't exist. But for Ethereum, you can. I've seen, you know, I think there's a analyst at Bloomberg who I give a shout out to. He did an excellent one, and I think he did a range of models. And it's somewhere between basically six and 9000, based on the current economic activity, which seems reasonable, but doesn't include any type of monetary premium, which I think is just pure upside on top of that.
00:31:16.826 - 00:31:27.710, Speaker E: But definitely the equity folks, that they go from kind of glazed over in their eyes about crypto to, oh, this is interesting. I had no idea. When you show them the DCF type.
00:31:27.742 - 00:32:05.874, Speaker D: Analysis, and what I would say is, it's important that we're doing this panel here at permissionless, but we should also be doing these kind of panels where the institutional investors hang out. So there was a conference last week called AMA Alternative Investment Management association. There were major institutional investors there. There's a conference next week called Iconnections in Miami, where major institutional investors go to meet funds. Like me, I volunteer for an organization called KaIA, CAIA chartered Alternative investment analyst. It's like the CFA or the CPA, but for alternative investments. There are 12,000 members of this organization, many of whom are institutional investors.
00:32:05.874 - 00:32:15.254, Speaker D: So do you do a webinar on a bull case for ethereum in language that resonates with them to the point you're making?
00:32:15.634 - 00:32:16.298, Speaker A: Jason?
00:32:16.426 - 00:32:46.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a great stepping stone. It makes it more approachable. But it's also a good bridge to teach the traditional investor about the new metrics in crypto, because it's not just the old fundamentals. There's new fundamentals. You can look at the, you might say total value locked in defi, but to a traditional investor, you say the Aum, but you can look at anything from on chain analytics, the long term holder base, the percent of supply locked in smart contracts, new fundamentals that can be used to value a new asset class, not just the old fundamentals.
00:32:48.564 - 00:33:23.374, Speaker A: Okay, great. So if I were to kind of summarize the rising complexity, we started with this very simple narrative that you can buy a share of this settlement platform for the Internet of value. Maybe now you can kind of quantify things a little bit, model things. And I guess maybe the next step in the sophistication would be staking if is a productive asset. I guess the question is how powerful is this narrative of being productive? If you do want to go and enjoy some of that APR, like where do you stake? How do you stake?
00:33:24.754 - 00:34:02.930, Speaker C: I think currently it's still very difficult for an institution to be able to stake. I know at ether capital, when we wanted to deploy our 1st 10,000 ether, there was no support really from the custodians yet. They hadn't figured out how they would do the multisig. We ended up bringing in a CTO and redoing our multisig. We partnered with Figment to run validators, so there's not a lot of access points yet to stake. Depending on what jurisdiction you're in and what regulatory requirements you have. Some regulators may not think it's appropriate to use an NPC based wallet to custody a large amount of ETH.
00:34:02.930 - 00:34:35.310, Speaker C: So I think that there's a lot of friction, at least in Canada. I'm based in Canada. For exchanges that want to offer staking, they have a requirement from the regulators that they can't have more than 80% of their assets outside of cold storage. So they're bumping up against this 20% limit. So it creates a bunch of friction. But I think post merge you'll see more custodians solve how they're going to custody ETH. There's, I guess, a lot of opportunity there, and there's still a lot of reporting complexity.
00:34:35.310 - 00:35:35.724, Speaker C: I can say that as someone who's a public issuer, converting all of this information to IFRS accounting standards is a complete nightmare. And so this kind of tooling is an opportunity for the industry to any new entrant who's looking how they can support institutions or build software that's going to be needed as we go into the next five years or ten years, as more people want to stake and institutions get involved, these kind of problems are going to need to be solved. So it's still very, very early and really complex to stake in any kind of structured product and to do it at scale in a safe and appropriate way. You know, it's one thing to say I have a ledger and generated some keys, and you know, you staked or whatever provider you choose. It's another thing to say, how do you do this with $100 million or $200 million? What does that look like? How are you monitoring the validators and making sure that your attestation time is correct or you're not getting slash? All of this kind of tooling still needs to be be built.
00:35:38.944 - 00:37:11.962, Speaker E: I think that every time I mention Ethereum to Wall street people, I remind them that it is a productive asset as compared to bitcoin, which is a non productive asset. And when you include, in fact, bitcoin issuance and maybe some cost of storage or lost income from short term treasury bills, that actually has a, a negative carry. Further to that point, I think one view of Ethereum in the post merge world that is starting to catch on, and I'm still having trouble communicating it well myself. But is this idea that staked ETH effectively is very similar to an emerging market local currency bond in a lot of ways, and where you can actually hedge out the local currency risk, you can receive the real yield from Ethereum. And for macro investors who do this in emerging market countries all over the world, when you put it in that terms, it's like, oh, this is a no brainer. Where other country in the world can I get a high single digit real yield, which is basically nowhere. And in fact, depending on the instrument you're using to hedge out the currency risk, should you choose to do so, I think that currency theory would suggest that if you can receive a positive real yield on an emergency market asset, you probably want to be long the underlying currency.
00:37:11.962 - 00:37:49.772, Speaker E: But if you wanted to do it, hedge out the local currency, sometimes you could even capture the forward curve and catch up and, and catch additional carry. So there are environments in Ethereum where you can get basically a risk free double digit return from real economic output, not just an issuance type of inflation. And that is a unique, this is unique to Ethereum. This is still kind of bleeding edge, I think, and people are just starting to think about it, figure out how to bust a play it.
00:37:49.948 - 00:38:39.610, Speaker A: So, just to summarize, I think what Sam was saying is that there's this trade you can do where you can capture the yield and not be exposed to ETH. Basically, you long staked ETH, you short non staked ETH, and then you capture the yield. And I guess with the merge coming up, we have the transaction fees that are going to add to the yield. And so right now we have 12.5 million ETH stakes, which is about 10% and that could grow quite a bit, you know, to 20%, 30%, 40%. And I guess my last question, because we're soon out of time, is it seems that ETH is designed to be collateral money, right? It's designed to be collateral for staking and collateral for Defi. And in that context, it's like very low velocity money.
00:38:39.610 - 00:39:07.414, Speaker A: And just like gold, which is very low velocity money, most of the gold is just held, not moving in vaults. Does this mean that there could be an argument for eve to accrue monetary premium above and beyond kind of the utilitarian value that is provided by the sale of the block space?
00:39:08.874 - 00:39:09.654, Speaker C: Yes.
00:39:10.794 - 00:39:54.282, Speaker B: I mean, if you look at like we're talking about activities that are taking place on chain, whether it's, you're providing liquidity or using exclateral to take a loan or liquid staked ETH, ether has to be the most pristine collateral, because ether is what's securing the chain. If ether is not secure, none of it's secure. And so I think by default, if you're using wrapped bitcoin, there's a trust assumption there. If you're using anything else, there's some additional assumption. By default, ether has to be the most secure thing that's happening on Ethereum. So I think it will be that pristine collateral. And then if you look at like, I like to think of Ethereum as many emerging economies being built on top of it, there's the entire defi space, there's the web3 NFT space, and ether is already being used as money in those.
00:39:54.282 - 00:40:03.854, Speaker B: It's the most liquid pair on uniswap. It's the what. Every NFT is denominated in Opensea, except for a few. So yeah, I think it does deserve a monetary premium.
00:40:09.814 - 00:42:06.424, Speaker E: I think Justin knows I have almost an extreme view on this, which is whatever asset wins, wins. The credibly decentralized money layer of the Internet, where money is programmable, will accrue potentially an extreme amount of monetary premium. I mean, if you think about it, Ethereum can actually be programmed to be anything. You can program it to be Tesla, you can program it to be us treasury bonds, you can program it to be gold. And if we take for example, make or die, I mean, there are plenty of protocols that simply have derivative assets that are collateralized by a stable asset like DAi, and which ultimately is collateralized by ETH. I like to kind of say like, what is the minimum total addressable market for collateralized ETH into stablecoins is probably 10% of all chinese deposits, which is call it $3 trillion. If you think about the fact that every year about $500 billion tries to leave China via capital flight, when people find out that you can simply buy ETH, wrap it up into dai and create dollar bills, a phenomenon that has not existed in the post Bretton woods era, it's a fundamental shift, and I'm guessing that, again, whatever asset becomes the settlement layer or the layer of value and the underlying collateral for that, in this case ethereum, should accrue a lot of monetary premium.
00:42:07.884 - 00:43:24.002, Speaker A: Ok. And I guess we really need to wrap up, but I guess I'll try to summarize some of what has been said here. There is going to be a lot of demand for EFAs collateral money, in particular in the context of stablecoins, because we need decentralized stablecoins, as we've seen that uncollateralized stablecoins don't work. And what is the other way to do decentralized stable coins is to have fully collateralized stable coins. And that if we want to have trillions of dollars of stablecoins, well, we're going to need trillions of dollars of pristine collateral. And in order to get to that point, we're going to need to accrue monetary premium, because if we look at the DCFs, that's going to give us valuations on the order of maybe 1 trillion or several trillion, but we need to get to ten times that, basically being a situation like gold, which has about the ten x monetary premium. And so if we can basically simultaneously be ultra high velocity money and capture this, provide the utility and capture the burn, and simultaneously be ultra low velocity money and be collateral, we kind of have the best of both worlds, where we have an asset which is kind of dual purposed.
00:43:24.002 - 00:43:54.964, Speaker A: On the one hand, it's like a share in a company, and it can be valued using this DCF. And on the other hand, it's digital money for the Internet, a type of gold which deserves monetary premium. And I guess that's the bull case for. For Eve. Okay, we're out of time, but I guess the panelists are happy to answer questions probably after the. After this. Thank you.
