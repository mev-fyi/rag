00:00:00.440 - 00:00:05.765, Speaker A: Just to share like how I'm. I am uncomfortably bullish at this point. I really am. I'm. I'm.
00:00:06.185 - 00:00:11.625, Speaker B: Look at the man. Look at the man in his eyes glass. I am really fidgeting on the chair.
00:00:11.745 - 00:00:35.175, Speaker A: I really am. I'm coming back from Token and Breakpoint being like these people online have no are so disconnected from reality because the loudest people on crypto Twitter are the traders and they have been sitting in the midst of just choppiness for six months. And I am here. I'm in the trenches with 20,000 people who are building really cool shit.

00:01:57.395 - 00:02:04.947, Speaker B: Well, what happened now? Now. Now we're not in a room and I look like a. Now we're seems to.
00:02:05.091 - 00:02:09.855, Speaker A: I actually gotta make my chair a little taller. Here you go.
00:02:14.275 - 00:02:15.291, Speaker B: Who's tall now?
00:02:15.363 - 00:02:15.975, Speaker A: Right?
00:02:17.845 - 00:02:29.861, Speaker B: So I love cursing, by the way. So like, you know, if we. If we. I don't know if we get like a little rating on Spotify. That's censored content, explicit content. You know that sticker and CDs. Yes, I'm showing my age.
00:02:29.861 - 00:02:33.985, Speaker B: Like adult. Like explicit content. That little black sticker on the bottom.
00:02:34.845 - 00:02:41.461, Speaker A: Yeah, let's. I'm going to pull up the. I'm going to pull up the comments while I'm doing that. How was. How's the trip? How's the trip?
00:02:41.533 - 00:02:41.693, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:41.709 - 00:02:46.261, Speaker A: How's the break point and token and what did you think of Singapore as it wrapped up.
00:02:46.453 - 00:03:13.491, Speaker B: Oh, amazing. I tweeted about this. Two of the kindest things people have ever done to me happened this week or that week. This guy Kai published here, actually, I'll show it to you. I was gonna say I think my bookshelf might just collapse and stuff, but he gave me this book. He now open sourced it, but for anyone that's viewing this, it's like Wrecked Mistakes from the trenches. He went by 0x Chancellor.
00:03:13.491 - 00:03:51.705, Speaker B: Now he's kind of still pseudo anonymous. But anyways, he assembled this and I think time is the best investment that anyone can give you. So he basically interviewed probably, I think it's like 50 of the most degen people in crypto and asked them, what are your top three mistakes? And then he assembled them, collect them, and then just publish, like created this book. And anyways, I had a really fantastic meeting with him in Singapore. He's based in. I guess I won't say, but yeah, we. Then he dedicated the book to me.
00:03:51.705 - 00:03:59.677, Speaker B: Yeah, no one's ever done a book like, I guess I've made it in life. Jesus. It feels.
00:03:59.821 - 00:04:03.165, Speaker A: That's cool. What are the big mistakes? Have you read it yet?
00:04:03.325 - 00:04:19.085, Speaker B: No, I have, yeah, of course. I read it while I was in Singapore and then on the flight back he published a great thread on it summarizing it. And by the way, people want access to the book. I didn't want to force him to do it. I just sort of kept it. I didn't name names. And then he came out and said, yeah, I'll publish it.
00:04:19.085 - 00:04:43.055, Speaker B: So he open sourced it, but it usually runs around common themes. Leverage. Just don't play with leverage as a ticking bomb. Not forming your own thesis, selling too early seems to be a common error, which I sort of don't think is that big of an error. It's just sort of like, again, error. Process or outcome. But process errors are definitely leverage.
00:04:43.055 - 00:05:04.387, Speaker B: You know, a couple people obviously had hacks and you know, FTX money in FTX sizing is a common mistake that a lot of people really point to. So yeah, and then just listening to friends and like not doing their own research. Yeah, seems to be a common denominator here.
00:05:04.531 - 00:05:12.575, Speaker A: All right, so give us your maybe tell us about how you're feeling about things. Market's ripping. Right, so salon is up 9% in a week.
00:05:16.115 - 00:05:18.975, Speaker B: Is now back. Oh yeah, Whiff is back above $2.
00:05:22.395 - 00:05:32.829, Speaker A: Maybe let's start there. Where are you in terms of. So, yeah, whiff is up 22. But last you said on this podcast, you were. There's a. There's a couple months ago you were thinking about trimming some meme coins. I'm not sure what.
00:05:32.829 - 00:05:39.293, Speaker A: What you did there. What. So where are you sitting in with these meme coins? Did you end up taking the money off the top? Did you do.
00:05:39.389 - 00:06:01.517, Speaker B: Not off the top. I did take some size off. I put it back on. I'm kind of in my private books, you know, sort of fully allocated, so to speak. I've said this in my panels that I took in 2049. I generally think that the market's too focused on the election. And I think I am of the mind that it's.
00:06:01.517 - 00:06:20.195, Speaker B: It is important, but I think people are pricing it too conservatively and so like very binary. It's either going to be really good or really bad. And I think the money's in the middle. And so I'm willing to. I was of the mind that I should. I felt. Felt compelled to put on more risk.
00:06:20.195 - 00:06:45.967, Speaker B: You're also seeing the Central bank of China inject more liquidity into the system. And I think people. I've been observing China a lot. People should go listen to Joe McCann's interview in November of last year. He also references China and like the central bank and injection of liquidity, they're obviously having more systemically like the US like it's an untenable situation. They have basically 2008 on their hands. They have like a bunch of like underperforming loans in the real estate sector.
00:06:45.967 - 00:07:14.619, Speaker B: Everyone knows it. The question is like a lot of these, like Internet, Chinese Internet companies are trading at like distress levels, like sub 10 PE ratios. Like that's just bananas in my mind. It's like I look at that and the coupon that you can get some of these like structured products. And to me that's just a signal that the market is incredibly bearish on China. And I think just get paid. Whether it's crypto or in some of these other alternatives, so to speak, when people are just as Howard Marks likes to describe, the pendulum swings to extremes.
00:07:14.619 - 00:07:37.679, Speaker B: Crypto is very much like that. And it. Yeah, I just think it's. It's just topical. I think I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing, particularly coming out of Singapore, you know, like talking to founders that I'm an investor in or just not an investor in. A lot of energy in the Breakpoint conference. A lot of product shipping.
00:07:37.679 - 00:07:49.465, Speaker B: I still need to catch up on a lot of the videos, but I've been very public. I'm very. And I Think you have too. I'm very bullish on certain categories that are going to be pretty impactful to showcase people what crypto is all about.
00:07:49.585 - 00:07:50.313, Speaker A: Like what?
00:07:50.449 - 00:07:53.793, Speaker B: Deep in. Teep it deep. Deep in.
00:07:53.849 - 00:07:54.593, Speaker A: Oh, deep in.
00:07:54.689 - 00:08:06.841, Speaker B: You cannot argue reasonably with a person if you tell them. Would you switch your mobile operator if you can say 50% and it's the same plan or even better in terms of reliability.
00:08:06.953 - 00:08:07.249, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:07.297 - 00:08:17.725, Speaker B: Same speed. Like, you know, I mean we, we've never had that, we've never had that clear, coherent, no brainer argument for crypto.
00:08:18.825 - 00:08:28.765, Speaker A: So what is the. If you are listening to this and you say, oh man. Okay, Santi, I know he said think for yourself, but I don't want to think for myself. I just want to follow Santi into these trades. How do you put on a depend position?
00:08:30.065 - 00:08:31.377, Speaker B: First of all, I know he said.
00:08:31.401 - 00:08:34.809, Speaker A: The biggest mistake that people make is following other people in these trades, but I don't.
00:08:34.857 - 00:08:36.275, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for.
00:08:36.425 - 00:08:36.895, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:36.975 - 00:08:53.595, Speaker B: First of all, none of this is legal or any advice for that matter. I am highly unreliable. Should not be trusted. I can change my mind on a whim. So anyways, now that that's out of the way, here's how you should know. I'm kidding. I mean there's public, obviously.
00:08:53.935 - 00:09:22.575, Speaker A: Do you know why you can't listen to people, by the way, about what they remember in. Actually, I won't, I won't actually dox any. Well, you know people, people change their minds all the time and they don't always announce it. So let's say you see on Twitter or let's say, yeah, let's say you see on Twitter that someone sold a bunch of their whiff. Well, you might want to go home and sell a bunch of your whiff because you trust that person. But then the next day they change their mind. They said, actually I just saw a bullish signal and I bought back my whiff.
00:09:22.575 - 00:09:28.407, Speaker A: But you. But they didn't. But they never updated you on that. So now you're, you're caught and Whiff is up 20% and you're.
00:09:28.471 - 00:10:08.527, Speaker B: It's selective announcement of and probably survivorship bias and whole host of bias like some of these traders like are LARPing and if they're actually correct they'd be like the best investors of all time, which they're not because they're running like private paid groups like on telegram. I'm like, there's a big disconnect here. I don't have a paid telegram group. Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever see one, it's a scam. And so you know, I mean like these self proclaimed like the best traders on crypto like have these paid telegram groups. I'm like well if you're really that profitable like why do you need to like sustain yourself on paid telegram groups? Nonetheless, I digress. Deepen I express it through largely private investments the likes of Geo.
00:10:08.527 - 00:10:45.495, Speaker B: Well actually Geonet has a token but look my investments I guess I'll tell you Andrina, you're an investor in Adrena, it doesn't have a token but that's one way to express it. I guess if you're more practically speaking for people that are investing in tokens you could look at no surprise, helium. Very encouraging. The mobile carrier offloading is huge I think so that's something that I'm really tracking. The other ones are like you know, you have highmapper, you have. I'm just listing like in no particular order like just the public the largest Deepen projects. You could buy a basket of those.
00:10:45.495 - 00:11:42.385, Speaker B: I would caution and I would encourage people like there are very meaningful differences amongst these Particularly the thing that I would focus on in terms of doing diligence. So I'll give, I guess this would be useful is focus on like the token economics for instance I met a lot of projects are like hey, we've been able to you know cert like we've been able to you know map like 50% of the roads in India and you're like wow, that's great. And they're like so you basically penetrated 50% of the market and you've only generated less than a million dollars in fees. So you're telling me the market opportunity is nothing. So I think that's a challenge in both the opportunity and Deepen that not all models are going to really work. Not because traditionally infrastructure has been very much like monopoly regulated monopolies are just artificial, like natural monopolies in the sense that they're very capital intensive. So because of that it's very concentrated.
00:11:42.385 - 00:12:41.999, Speaker B: And so insofar as Deepen lowers that CapEx cost, allows small incumbents to come in and disrupt the market again doesn't necessarily mean that the TAM may be very big that the total addressable market is saying okay you can build a next cellular mobile like a next telecom in the US that's multi billion dollars. But the fallacy might be how much does that actually translate into revenue? Because either the price comes down because you're undercutting, right as a monopoly comes down then you might not be able to charge as Much. And so the revenue trend, I think the market's not dumb in the sense of like there's a reason why a lot of these deepen projects don't trade at multi, you know, multi billion dollar stuff. Right. And so it's either tokenomics are off or the monetization is unproven. Right. They might have been able to scale the supply really well, but the demand's not there, the users are not there, the usage is not there.
00:12:41.999 - 00:13:12.605, Speaker B: Like again, you could really incentivize people to get on the network and mine a particular token. That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to stick around or they're going to use the product. So, you know, Helium, for example, probably the most. I'm not actually an investor, but you know, probably the most interesting and project in terms of traction. They are trading at a $1.6 billion valuation, so. And then there's like vaporware that trades at 7 billion.
00:13:13.265 - 00:13:16.805, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you seen the metrics of Helium's metrics recently?
00:13:17.225 - 00:13:19.713, Speaker B: Like the. I'm mostly looking at the carry offloading.
00:13:19.849 - 00:13:28.697, Speaker A: Yeah. The carrier data. Here. Let's. I just, I just found this on Twitter. I don't know the source of this, but this is the, this is the chart. I'm talking about some.
00:13:28.697 - 00:13:37.665, Speaker A: The chart looks something like this. I don't know if this is the exact right chart, but like. Yeah, I mean, it is, it is, it's working. Yeah, it, it's working.
00:13:37.745 - 00:13:49.523, Speaker B: What? A carrier would not offload traffic onto the Helium network if they didn't think it was reliable. They wouldn't risk their core business. Right. The, the, the TLDR it is 100,000 signups.
00:13:49.636 - 00:13:50.091, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:50.205 - 00:13:51.229, Speaker B: Right offload.
00:13:51.342 - 00:14:05.665, Speaker A: 59, 50, 60, 60 terabytes of data right offloaded, which has gone parabolic and 143,000 daily subscribers. So these are subscribers, other carriers that connect. Yeah.
00:14:07.525 - 00:14:29.225, Speaker B: Look, everyone should go read primer on this stuff. No one will, I guess. So the TLDR is. Networks rely on other networks to share coverage. Right. If you're a subscriber to ATT or Verizon, you might go to a particular region that AT&T itself doesn't have coverage, but then they rely on other networks to provide service. And they're always.
00:14:29.225 - 00:14:54.089, Speaker B: The challenge is always like the peak load balancing is like they need to have enough capacity for peak usage and consumption. But of course, not all the time. You have that. And so that's why it becomes important to be able to offload some of that traffic. Subscribers, whether. Because they're in a particular region or just too much traffic and congestion. They use and they're starting to use more so the helium network to solve for that.
00:14:54.089 - 00:15:03.575, Speaker B: And that's very encouraging. I. That obviously translates into as you just brought this up, how much helium is being burned? Right.
00:15:05.595 - 00:15:17.867, Speaker A: How do you think about when you see metrics like this that are good, but helium's. The narrative around helium and the soft stuff around helium have been like soft in the past. How do you think about those two things?
00:15:17.971 - 00:16:14.547, Speaker B: I'm not an expert. We'd have to bring in maybe Kyle or someone who's very much into it because I think again, the nuances like okay, the tokenomics and the revenue, the monetization piece, I still haven't dug enough. As I said, I don't have a position but I'm, I'm looking at this as a case study into just deepen as a category. Yeah, but you know, to me it is, I would guess so said differently, if you were to describe helium to someone and you probably could tell them, hey listen, it has all these usage and stats and like where do you think it would be trading on a fully diluted basis? Over, under, by the way, high, like circulating to total token like you know, market cap is 1.2, fully diluted is 1.6. A lot of those tokens are already in circulation. So it's like 75% of those tokens are in circulation.
00:16:14.547 - 00:16:45.535, Speaker B: So a lot of it's been vested. And in the market, I would probably guess that most people would estimate that it's over 1.6 billion and fully diluted, particularly if you frame it in. I don't know, let's look at Ondo for instance. Flavor of the month, 8 billion, which I'm bearish on by the way for a few reasons. I just think Treasuries become less or less interesting in a world where rates go down.
00:16:47.595 - 00:16:52.331, Speaker A: There are so many people offering Treasuries into the on chain market that it becomes a very commoditized.
00:16:52.483 - 00:17:26.137, Speaker B: That's a commoditization. The appeal of punting Treasuries goes down as rates come down. And so I think the more interesting opportunity that I think the market's waking up to is what are those? It's like money markets, right. The Avis of the world, the Caminos of the Caminos have been on a tear. Full disclosure, investor in both. But I think there's a reason why that is and I think the market's sort of waking up to that idea that like the higher yield opportunities and the Ability to capture fees is going to go more towards less tokenization of Treasuries and real estate. Some of this stuff more so money markets.
00:17:26.137 - 00:17:36.715, Speaker B: Right. That people are doing recursive leverage and spec like you know what I mean? Like that, that is where a lot of the fees end up in a higher risk environment, so to speak.
00:17:36.795 - 00:17:44.255, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a pretty. By the way RWA xyz. I don't know if you've ever been to this site. It's a really good resource to look at all these treasuries.
00:17:44.595 - 00:17:49.891, Speaker B: So who has the highest? For instance, it's blackrock. Right. Biddle.
00:17:50.083 - 00:17:59.971, Speaker A: So treasury product metrics, it's Biddle which is BlackRock. That's BlackRock fobxx I think that's Franklin Templeton I would assume.
00:18:00.043 - 00:18:00.695, Speaker B: Okay.
00:18:01.475 - 00:18:13.367, Speaker A: Oh here we can look at it here. So top entities. Okay. So they break it down by protocols. So Ondo's at 600, securitizes at 500 million. Franklin Templeton's at 400 million. That's their Benji product.
00:18:13.367 - 00:18:26.847, Speaker A: Then it, there's a big drop off. It goes hash note, open Eden, then super states around 100 million. Then it's a big drop off. Right. Centrifuge people know that name. 35 million the issuers. If you flip over to this tab.
00:18:26.847 - 00:18:53.375, Speaker A: Yeah. BlackRock is in the lead at half a billion. Yeah, this will get shaken up because there's a huge program, it's called Grand Prix. It's MakerDAO Grand Prix. It's a billion dollar incentive program. They're basically taking a billion dollars of like unallocated I think usdc. I'm sure I'm botching this but they're taking a billion of USDC and then allocating it to some of these people and buying treasuries with it to get the yield on it.
00:18:53.375 - 00:19:00.115, Speaker A: So I think some will flow into. Gotta imagine Ondo Superstate, blackrock folks like this.
00:19:00.825 - 00:19:46.445, Speaker B: Yeah but you know, I mean back to deepen like I guess it'd be interesting if we were to do a poll and be like where do you think deepen this particular name trades knowing the backdrop of some of these metrics, actual usage and I guess yeah I actually would invite listeners or someone that would like to come on the POD next week, explain to me why what has been challenged or like I'd like to have a debate of like the bull case and the bear case for helium as an example or Geonet. But let's, let's talk helium because I think that's like the, the like The. The most important deepen protocol right now because it is. Just has the most amount of traction and visibility. Or I'm happy to construct.
00:19:46.565 - 00:19:47.797, Speaker A: No, no, no, no, let's do that.
00:19:47.821 - 00:19:52.517, Speaker B: My brain and that. I'm happy to, like, come prepared. I'm not as prepared next session.
00:19:52.581 - 00:19:54.387, Speaker A: Would you take the bull case or the bear case?
00:19:54.501 - 00:19:57.615, Speaker B: I could take both. I'm gonna construct both arguments in my brain.
00:19:57.735 - 00:20:01.115, Speaker A: Who, by the way, switching gears a little, who won the debate with you and A. Vitro?
00:20:01.495 - 00:20:15.583, Speaker B: I actually think of each other was more articulate, he presented more facts, and I think he did a really good job. I think he won. Actually, the poll say that I win. But of course, I mean, you were.
00:20:15.599 - 00:20:16.919, Speaker A: At a salona conference, so.
00:20:16.967 - 00:20:26.035, Speaker B: I was at a salon conference. We both had to. We both had to take both sides of the argument. So we just came at it from different perspectives. But I think you do a really good job.
00:20:26.155 - 00:20:39.975, Speaker A: Nice. I have a. I have an investment I'd like to put in front of you. Oh, yes, we got the Poly Market live. Hoffman. Hoffman versus Warwick.
00:20:40.395 - 00:20:45.043, Speaker B: Yes. I caught up with Kane on Singapore.
00:20:45.139 - 00:20:53.915, Speaker A: That dude is looking good these days in terms of his. He's. He's been bulking, he's been training, he's ready for the fight.
00:20:54.255 - 00:20:56.071, Speaker B: I actually.
00:20:56.183 - 00:20:57.535, Speaker C: He's sober too.
00:20:57.655 - 00:21:20.205, Speaker B: I've been trolling Kane, like, he was. They did this part, this Infinix event with. With Omega er and Infinix, and they text me before the event, like, they had these F1 simulators. And, you know, like, Kane was like, Kane's talking. He's like, I'll crush you, man. Let's put one salon on the line. I'm like, fine.
00:21:20.205 - 00:21:41.925, Speaker B: And he's like, I've been training. You know, I'm like, kane, not because you have a fancy car. Does it mean that you're gonna be good in the simulator? I'm like, you're training. He's like, you're training for running, you're training for karate. You're training for like, simulators. Like, you know that, you know, you're like a mile wide, an inch deep. And he's like, oh, you get all triggered by that.
00:21:41.925 - 00:21:56.445, Speaker B: Funny thing is though, that in this. In this event, they had these two simulators. I think Kane was like, okay. And then his other partner, Igor was okay. And then the Andre and Miguel from second lane, they're actually professional, like Porsche.
00:21:57.185 - 00:21:57.785, Speaker A: Really?
00:21:57.905 - 00:22:10.377, Speaker B: Yeah. I didn't know this. So they told me this when we were in F1. And of course, they smoked everyone out of the water. They're like, really good drivers. And so anyways, just as a reminder, anytime you talk shit, there's always a guy that's quiet in the background.
00:22:10.441 - 00:22:12.205, Speaker A: There's always a guy. Yeah.
00:22:12.585 - 00:22:14.725, Speaker B: Anyways, back to this. Who do you think wins?
00:22:15.455 - 00:22:16.407, Speaker C: Oh, man.
00:22:16.551 - 00:22:18.855, Speaker B: Don't pull up the market. The market's already. The market's.
00:22:18.895 - 00:22:33.759, Speaker A: Look at this. No, I. You think the YouTube comments are good? Look at the. Pretty sure David Hoffman's a proud drinker of Toyland. Oh, David's popping off. David goes, I eat more steak than you. Oh, this is funny.
00:22:33.759 - 00:22:39.944, Speaker A: All right, so the. We are recording this Thursday afternoon. Hoffman is a 35% chance.
00:22:40.025 - 00:22:45.803, Speaker B: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, there's less than $7,000 in this market. So I can go in here and punt the odds.
00:22:45.859 - 00:22:51.015, Speaker A: Like, I think, oh, man, this is. I think there's some money to be made in this market.
00:22:52.755 - 00:22:58.815, Speaker B: For sure. There's. There's. There's gross. You know, for context, Kane came box back in the day.
00:22:59.555 - 00:23:08.627, Speaker A: So if you put a thousand bucks on Kane right Now, it's a 30% return. You put a thousand bucks on Hoffman. Yeah, 65% return.
00:23:08.691 - 00:23:13.363, Speaker B: Oh, okay. Yeah, the market's saying that. Sorry, I got this wrong. The market's saying that Kane.
00:23:13.459 - 00:23:14.739, Speaker A: No, the market's saying Kane won.
00:23:14.827 - 00:23:21.375, Speaker B: Yeah, 65. I actually think it's closer than that. 50. 50.
00:23:22.235 - 00:23:26.235, Speaker A: All right. Put your money. So. So then you should bet on Hoffman.
00:23:26.395 - 00:23:38.399, Speaker B: I. Look, no, listen, I'm not gonna make a prediction on this, but I. I mean, I sympathize. Kane's my friends. I'll put money on. Am I gonna bet against my friend? God damn it. I have a lot of flaws, but loyalty is not one of them.
00:23:38.447 - 00:23:52.791, Speaker A: Yeah, true, true, true. So we had some regulatory stuff this week, so, like, regulatory policy. Public. Public sector. So Richie Torres had some epic comments. Maybe we could play that and listen to them out loud. Nick wrote a great piece.
00:23:52.791 - 00:23:54.207, Speaker A: Nick Carter wrote a great piece in.
00:23:54.271 - 00:23:58.395, Speaker B: Pirates Wire, which for anyone that doesn't know what's that.
00:23:59.105 - 00:24:37.865, Speaker A: Pirates Wire was a. Is an independent media company created by this guy Mike Solana really took off during COVID As. I think there were a lot of people fed up with, like, fed up with, like, either government overreach or, you know, maybe they're pro libertarian or they're fed up with the mask mandate, or they're fed up with lockdowns, or they're fed up with, like, the woke movement or, like, it was all that, you know, kind of crowd, I would say needed a place to consume information. And Mike Solana created Pirate's Wire. I don't know when he created it but I associate it with like coming up during COVID and yeah, it's an independent media brand.
00:24:38.325 - 00:24:43.237, Speaker B: So what was the extent of his post, Nick?
00:24:43.301 - 00:25:05.033, Speaker A: Basically so I've skimmed it ahead of this but I need to, it's a very, it's a long piece. I need to actually sit down and read it. The things that I wrote like the bullets that I wrote down as I was like looking through it. So one is that silver basically Silvergate. So Nick's been writing about Operation choke point. Obviously chokepoint 1.0 was Obama basically debanking a lot of the.
00:25:05.033 - 00:25:30.729, Speaker A: I think it was marijuana companies, gun companies, things like that. Nick has been talking about 2.0 which is purposefully debanking a lot of the crypto companies. So when Nick wrote this piece he said look, I feel very vindicated. A lot of what I called out back in March when there's this banking crisis has actually come true. So reading through some of the bullets I wrote down. So Silvergate voluntarily liquidated in March 2023.
00:25:30.729 - 00:26:12.405, Speaker A: It wasn't a forced liquidation, it was a voluntary liquidation where they were crushed by regulatory pressures. And one of the takeaways of this piece is that there was there, there was a bank run but they actually survived the bank run. It was the regulatory pressure that forced them to liquidate. So that was one second is that the Federal Reserve allegedly imposed a secret 15% cap on crypto related deposits which killed Silvergate's business model. So the Fed Yeah put this 15% arbitrary and secret cap on crypto related deposits. Silvergate obviously has a lot of crypto deposits. So that, that really hurt their business.
00:26:12.405 - 00:26:40.411, Speaker A: Nick called out Senator Warren's public letters which kind of questions Silvergate's practices, said that her letters, her public letters questioning Silvergate's practices started to fuel the downfall. And then Nick calls into question a potential alliance between Warren and who's the short seller? Mark Cohodes where they kind of like targeted Silver Gate together.
00:26:40.563 - 00:26:47.989, Speaker B: And Mark and notorious short seller, he was, he was very much vocal on this for a while.
00:26:48.117 - 00:27:26.077, Speaker A: So what I think when Nick calls out and again I have to like fully read the piece because this was just me skimming it is that Cohotes was kind of fueling Warren with some pieces of information and Warren would just publicly write, you know, kind of write out what this short seller was saying and she, you know, she'd kind of write it out in these public letters. And so Silver gets collapse kind of then Triggered this domino effect which took down sub and signature. I'm trying to think if there's anything else in this piece. I mean is it really. I mean I'm not doing the piece justice. There's an amazing piece that Nick wrote. We will link to it and you should actually go read this full piece.
00:27:26.077 - 00:27:29.665, Speaker A: It'll take you, take you like 30 minutes or something. But it was a good one.
00:27:32.285 - 00:27:50.675, Speaker B: So I guess on this point, not to how do you think about all of that in the context of just the election? I want to touch briefly on that, just if you have any updated views based on where you sit and also based on your conversations with folks over the last couple of weeks.
00:27:51.655 - 00:28:40.933, Speaker A: Well, so Kamala came out and had these two pro crypto statements this week which were what I would call the, the minimum viable positive crypto statements that she could make. There was like the, I mean I'll just candidly the lamest it was. It was better than not saying anything. So where she's been right now. So here's my summary of this. She everyone, everyone didn't like Biden because Biden was kind of in coots with Warren and Gensler and hadn't, hadn't really done anything to help the crypto industry. Then obviously there's the hot swap and commonly gets put in place and the whole industry I think was kind of anxiously awaiting maybe a pro crypto Democrat in Kamala and it's been disappointing the last month or two because she hasn't said anything.
00:28:40.933 - 00:29:00.425, Speaker A: She's been very quiet and hasn't really laid out her policies. Now she hasn't, it's not like she hasn't laid out her policies on crypto, but she's laid out her policies on a lot of other things. She hasn't really laid out any policies on anything. Right. I was with a healthcare executive earlier in the week and he's like, yeah, we haven't heard anything about health care. We have no idea how she thinks about health care. And it was, you know, same, same as crypto.
00:29:00.425 - 00:29:43.275, Speaker A: So this week she spoke at a wall at a thing on Wall street and made one statement about being, I think pro crypto or something like that. Then yesterday, yesterday she came out and I will share, I added manufacturing in aerospace remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies. So. Right. So what she said was we will remain dominant in AI, quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies. So you've got a couple of people on crypto Twitter, I think it was Hayden Adams, David said You know, this is the pivot. Kamala is officially pro crypto.
00:29:43.275 - 00:29:55.743, Speaker A: I don't. I'm. I don't think that is the case. I'm. I'm waiting for. I think to be. I think to be pro crypto after so many years of being anti crypto, you need a much stronger.
00:29:55.743 - 00:30:03.759, Speaker A: You can't just throw block. First off, what is this word? Blockchain. You can't just throw blockchain in with quantum computing and AI. You have to. I need to.
00:30:03.847 - 00:30:08.383, Speaker B: I want to launch a token on Pump Fun to be convinced.
00:30:08.439 - 00:30:09.675, Speaker A: Yeah. I need.
00:30:12.255 - 00:30:22.155, Speaker B: Let's just check the poses, ladies and gentlemen. You have one political candidate, it wants to launch a token. The other one continues to use this blockchain terminology. That's it. I think just going to leave it at that.
00:30:22.255 - 00:30:28.899, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I turned off by the word blockchain, by the way. I think it's from the blockchain, not bitcoin era.
00:30:28.947 - 00:30:31.135, Speaker B: Yeah, crypto. Blockchain, not crypto.
00:30:31.755 - 00:30:32.723, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:30:32.779 - 00:31:00.885, Speaker B: So, I mean, listen, politics will you do. And it will say not do anything to get elected. So, yeah, you know, yeah, whatever. But I was like, on this point, on this point, the odds have been all over the place. I think Kamala has been ripping actually 55, 45 now as of late. So take that for what it is. Also, the crypto pack has been donating a lot to Camela as well.
00:31:02.305 - 00:31:05.205, Speaker A: I didn't know. That far. Yeah.
00:31:06.065 - 00:31:06.845, Speaker B: Anyways.
00:31:08.905 - 00:31:10.405, Speaker A: Really? Where'd you see that?
00:31:12.305 - 00:31:14.323, Speaker B: I may have heard it, but I.
00:31:14.379 - 00:31:22.815, Speaker A: Interested. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I didn't know that. So anyways. So that. So that happened this week. I think people are, you know, it's.
00:31:22.815 - 00:31:47.669, Speaker A: It's just a little behind the scenes, like, we've reached out. So at permissionless, we have several congressmen and senators coming to speak, and we've just had a lot of political interest in the conference. Just because it's a week out from. Or, excuse me, it's a month out from the election. We have sent an equal number of invites to both Republicans and Democrats. We would like to have. We actually would like to make this more of a bipartisan conference instead of a partisan conference.
00:31:47.669 - 00:32:03.345, Speaker A: Even though I know a lot of people in the industry vehemently disagree with me on that. That's just the decision that we've made. We'd like to make it more of a bipartisan conference. The. There have been several conservatives, Republicans. Right. Who have accepted our invitation.
00:32:03.345 - 00:32:20.995, Speaker A: Mike Lee, senator from Utah, is coming. John Curtis, the most likely incoming senator from Utah, who's replacing Mitt Romney's. Who's replacing Mitt Romney is coming. Tom Emmer is coming. Right? There's several Republicans who have accepted Tom.
00:32:21.495 - 00:32:22.995, Speaker B: Behind the stablecoin bill.
00:32:23.535 - 00:32:24.295, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so.
00:32:24.335 - 00:32:28.959, Speaker B: He usually comes with one that is great clips about him interviewing like, he's great.
00:32:29.127 - 00:32:45.685, Speaker A: There's only one Democrat who's accepted our invitation. I've emailed the number of people who we've spoken with. We've had calls with senators, congressmen. Only one person has accepted our invite. So it was pretty disappointing. And that is. That's Richie, Richie Torres, by the way.
00:32:46.545 - 00:33:04.863, Speaker B: Who did a fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. Go listen to that clip. Yeah, basically corners Gensler. He says, hey, you know, is, is a New York Yankees ticket to security? And he's like, no. And then he's like, okay, well, how is that any different from some of these NFTs? Right?
00:33:04.999 - 00:33:08.975, Speaker A: Right. So can you hear that?
00:33:09.055 - 00:33:10.431, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Beautiful plate.
00:33:10.543 - 00:33:38.255, Speaker D: Mr. Gensler, suppose I were to sell you a Yankee ticket and tell you that the Yankee ticket could appreciate in value and could be resold at a profit in the secondary market. And as is the case with all sports tickets, suppose the proceeds from the sale of the Yankee ticket goes toward paying for the Yankee game. By selling you the Yankee ticket, am I entering into an investment contract with you and therefore conducting an unregistered security offering?
00:33:39.555 - 00:33:50.771, Speaker E: I appreciate the question. I don't know all the facts and circumstances, but I don't think so. I know where we're headed here, Representative, but I don't think so in that Yankees.
00:33:50.803 - 00:33:54.685, Speaker D: So a Yankee ticket is not. And why is the Yankee ticket not a security?
00:33:55.545 - 00:34:01.593, Speaker E: Well, it's really a question, and the courts have been clear on this. Is the offer and sale specifically with.
00:34:01.609 - 00:34:05.725, Speaker D: A Yankee ticket, though? What. When you're buying a Yankee ticket, what are you purchasing?
00:34:07.425 - 00:34:10.561, Speaker E: You're buying access to a Yankee game.
00:34:10.593 - 00:34:11.569, Speaker D: Is that fair to say?
00:34:11.697 - 00:34:14.793, Speaker E: I understand it's been a while since I went to a Yankee game, but.
00:34:14.969 - 00:34:16.049, Speaker D: You'Re welcome to our Yankee.
00:34:16.137 - 00:34:19.145, Speaker E: I used to live in New York and my three daughters were all born in New York.
00:34:19.185 - 00:34:40.644, Speaker D: So in the Stoner Katz case, the creators were selling an NFT that offered access to an animated web series. From the standpoint of federal securities law, is there a legal difference between buying a Yankee ticket that offers you the experience of a Yankee game and buying an NFT that offers you the experience of an animated web series?
00:34:41.664 - 00:34:44.844, Speaker E: Again, I don't want to comment on any one specific.
00:34:45.624 - 00:34:50.112, Speaker D: Well, it was a settlement, the fait accompli. It's not an ongoing litigation. You can comment on it.
00:34:50.248 - 00:35:02.137, Speaker E: It's about how is something offer and sold and is it offer and sold as an investment contract? Are individuals looking to a common enterprise anticipating profits based on the.
00:35:02.241 - 00:35:06.565, Speaker D: I'm familiar with the definition. You're avoiding the question. Thank you.
00:35:07.465 - 00:35:12.897, Speaker A: Oh, Adam. Oh, you're muted.
00:35:13.001 - 00:35:15.125, Speaker B: That was good. Yeah.
00:35:16.645 - 00:35:17.669, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:35:17.757 - 00:36:26.671, Speaker B: That was good. This is, this is what I mean by. I'm not as a lot of the discussions that I had in the last couple of weeks have been around, you know, asking a fund manager or just people, hey, how do you think about the election risk? And a lot I just think that a lot of people are giving it too much weight in their decisions. And while it may be true that in the near term there may be some dislocation to the order of 10, 20% plus minus like in either direction, I just think that I can't be but excited about that. Both the short term mindset of a lot of allocators on one end, like people are only talking about the election and the particular movement that that might have like 10, 20% in an asset class that I'm underwriting. 10x is nothing. You know what I mean? There's a disconnect there that I think this is why you can make why I'm excited in this asset class because there is that time preference and too much weight on near term things that don't factor into my thinking as much when I'm focused on the long term.
00:36:26.671 - 00:37:20.559, Speaker B: And the compounding effects of like this is either going to be a zero most likely or like ten very asymmetric outcome. And so I pay attention to these opportunities because I see them as an opportunity in the sense that most people are distracted in many ways. Right. And you're looking at all the Breakpoint videos and all the traction and token and then you're seeing this amount of too much nearsightedness combined with this encouragement of on both sides of the aisle, it's become more and more clear that there needs to be rulemaking, there needs to be policy. And every court case, most court cases are not being won like by the, you know, three later agencies. They're being won by crypto projects set Fair point. You need to be well capitalized.
00:37:20.559 - 00:37:55.415, Speaker B: You need the resources to fight it. But crypto continues to raise money to fight it off. As a lobby, as an industry, we've become better at that coordination. So even if you're not ripple or coinbase that you don't, you know, of course it helps to have these coffers to like, you know, pay the legal bills. But I just. This is what I mean by I'm not as concerned about the election, and I just think that it's certainly important, but it's not. I think it's going to be a divided house.
00:37:55.415 - 00:38:10.751, Speaker B: And so the worst, I guess the worst case is we don't get enough policies via stablecoin bill or some other sensible regulation the next four years. That to me is probably like I'm just kind of underwriting that.
00:38:10.903 - 00:38:11.675, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:14.095 - 00:38:49.419, Speaker C: Hey everyone, Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is where are all of crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on the show, so I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the Universal Intent Machine Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexes on each chain disaster.
00:38:49.507 - 00:38:49.707, Speaker A: Right?
00:38:49.731 - 00:39:22.329, Speaker C: But here's the good news. Thanks to Intense, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Anoma's Solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background. We're excited to see what cool Dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with Anoma, you can follow them at x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net Special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode. Let's face it, building on crowded L1s or expensive L2s is just not going to unlock the next generation of applications in crypto.

00:41:10.885 - 00:41:31.933, Speaker A: Dude, I'm with you. I actually was going to tweet this and then I was like, I'm not sure I'm supposed to tweet things like this, but like, it is. I think people are so uncomfortably off sides right now because they've gotten so caught in this, like, consolidated period of like six months of choppiness that they forget what could be coming. I would say.
00:41:32.029 - 00:41:35.085, Speaker B: And I'm right. It's like you, you should be updating your.
00:41:35.165 - 00:41:40.665, Speaker A: Just to share like how I'm. I am uncomfortably bullish at this point. I really am. I'm. I'm.
00:41:41.125 - 00:41:46.525, Speaker B: Look at the man. Look at the man in his eyes. I am really fidgeting on the chair.
00:41:46.645 - 00:42:12.965, Speaker A: I really am. I'm coming back from Token and breakpoint being like, these people online have no. Are so disconnected from reality because the loudest people on crypto Twitter are the traders and they have been sitting in the midst of just choppiness for six months. And I am here. I'm in the trenches with 20,000 people who are building really cool shit. Yeah, that is the traders. No, that cover picture.
00:42:12.965 - 00:42:21.459, Speaker A: That cover picture of the people on crypto Twitter and you smile on your face is me. Because I am just excited by the.
00:42:21.467 - 00:42:39.995, Speaker B: Way I just say this guy, the way that he knew that my favorite to put in the forward, like my favorite excerpt of a speech from Teddy Roosevelt. He's like, the book is dedicated to me. And he starts off by saying the credit belongs to the man is as scratch as a man's Assanti who is actually in the trenches.
00:42:40.155 - 00:42:42.203, Speaker A: In the arena. Yeah, in the arena.
00:42:42.299 - 00:42:43.643, Speaker B: I'm going to get roasted for this.
00:42:43.739 - 00:42:44.523, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:42:44.619 - 00:42:45.547, Speaker B: But it's amazing.
00:42:45.691 - 00:43:13.175, Speaker A: I mean, at the beginning, okay, China is doing massive liquidity, both monetary and fiscal stimulus. We are cutting rates and we're about to have a decision on the election where I don't think it necessarily even matters who's going to be elected. It's just the market hates the uncertainty of not having elected. It's like, come on guys, like, be a little more like just look, look, look two months out. You don't even have to look a year out. Like, just look two months out.
00:43:13.265 - 00:43:45.507, Speaker B: So yeah, it's, we're going to see a relief. And most of the times it's like you see it up or down, it doesn't really matter. The long term trajectory, you know, you all see the chart, right? It's noisy. But I just, you know, I can't help but be encouraged by a lot of the traction and I continue to believe we're entering a consumer application phase of this industry. You're seeing it in different pockets. It's real. And a lot of times it's sometimes very important to re underwrite your thesis.
00:43:45.507 - 00:44:15.949, Speaker B: And I appreciate some of these things might have been tried in 2014-2016-2018-2020, 2022. The space is moving fast and I think you need to, you need to be constantly on top of it. And you know, traders can make a lot of money. You know, I guess the difference is know the game you're playing. Either you're a trader or an investor. But like if you're going to be investing, you should and you're underwriting the type of return that probably you're requiring to take this amount of risk. You should be paying a lot of attention, but you should be actually paying attention in the right areas.
00:44:15.949 - 00:44:32.277, Speaker B: Meaning go look at all goddamn Break breakpoint videos and less lines on a chart. Go understand what's happening in China. You know, that matters. Liquidity, injection matters. Like the market. Like China Internet's like rally. Like, look at Baba.
00:44:32.277 - 00:44:42.419, Speaker B: Baba has gone from 70, 60 bucks to plus 100 in like matter of in this week. Yeah, it's just wild.
00:44:42.547 - 00:44:49.379, Speaker A: Yeah, we released a good Solana dashboard. Have you seen this thing?
00:44:49.427 - 00:44:50.443, Speaker B: I saw that, yep.
00:44:50.539 - 00:44:54.875, Speaker A: Yeah. So we actually made it free. So big shout out to the.
00:44:55.035 - 00:44:56.415, Speaker B: Were you a breakpoint?
00:44:56.835 - 00:44:58.939, Speaker A: Yeah, I went for, I went for like a day.
00:44:59.067 - 00:45:00.575, Speaker B: Nice. What did you think of it?
00:45:01.715 - 00:45:21.595, Speaker A: It was a pretty incredible event. I mean from an event organizer perspective, it was like one of the best organized events I've ever been. And then I just loved the focus on like, I would say front end products instead of infrastructure. You know, obviously they don't have to focus on infrastructure because they are the infrastructure. So it's, I mean, I think, great.
00:45:21.635 - 00:45:25.107, Speaker B: Point that you had a, you know, Friar Dancer announcement, but that was fired answer.
00:45:25.171 - 00:45:44.175, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Yeah, I thought it was, I thought it was an amazing event. Actually one of the best crypto events I've ever been to. I thought the like, sponsorship activations were good too. Like John Boats pull up bar, check out roasted on Wormhole. Yeah, we're, yeah, we can, we can talk about that later. But Wormhole had the like bridge from like one place to another.
00:45:44.175 - 00:45:47.183, Speaker A: I thought it was, Yeah, I thought it was a great event. I mean, I thought it was the.
00:45:47.199 - 00:45:50.055, Speaker B: Best, best crypto conference I've been. Full stop.
00:45:50.175 - 00:46:06.753, Speaker A: The debates were great. Yeah, we, I mean we're gonna take a lot of. Like, every time I go to these conferences, I just take inspiration for how to make our events better. And sometimes I go to these and I'm like, you know what? There's, there's really not much here I'm going to take inspiration from. But Break Point's one of those events from like they did the little thing.
00:46:06.849 - 00:46:24.297, Speaker B: They didn't give me any reason to leave. They had good beverages, cough good coffee. The speaker lounge was well situated where I could, you know, it was, I had all my meetings there. I was, it was incredibly productive. It was just, it was just flawless. In my mind. It was really good.
00:46:24.297 - 00:46:36.975, Speaker B: You know, most of the conferences have crappy food and just give me good coffee and variations of coffee that I want to have and don't give me a reason to leave. You know what I mean? Like, it was just good. Yeah, it was very good.
00:46:37.095 - 00:46:54.191, Speaker A: So we're thinking about this from a conference organizer's perspective. The industry is about to have what happened in SaaS where there used to be these big SaaS events and then you started seeing all the big SaaS companies. Salesforce, HubSpot, et cetera, Twilio create their own conferences.
00:46:54.343 - 00:46:55.111, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:55.303 - 00:47:04.071, Speaker A: And so Avalanche has something in like two weeks in Argentina. Solana has, has had Breakpoint. You're going to start seeing more of these.
00:47:04.143 - 00:47:07.935, Speaker B: You have side events. Like Monad's probably going to do one in New York.
00:47:08.055 - 00:47:11.119, Speaker A: I heard Mona is doing one, I think next week actually.
00:47:11.287 - 00:47:14.423, Speaker B: No, but they're going to have a more developer, like a devcon of sorts.
00:47:14.599 - 00:47:14.975, Speaker A: Basically.
00:47:15.015 - 00:47:17.595, Speaker B: What you're saying is everyone will have a defcon of their own.
00:47:18.135 - 00:47:24.103, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm not like breakpoint wasn't really devcon. It was, it was their Own unique flavor on what a good conference.
00:47:24.159 - 00:47:26.447, Speaker B: But that's def con, right. For Ethereum. Like that's amazing.
00:47:26.471 - 00:47:26.791, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:26.863 - 00:47:30.519, Speaker B: You have these ECC events and eth. Global events.
00:47:30.567 - 00:47:40.895, Speaker A: What are you as an attendee, more likely to attend, like so I guess because you like salon, so you'd attend that. But maybe you're not going to attend another ecosystem.
00:47:40.975 - 00:47:52.865, Speaker B: No, I've attended the Avalanche one. I attended the Optos one in Korea, I'm likely attending one in Amsterdam. But it's more for allocators. Legend for legends.
00:47:54.125 - 00:47:55.229, Speaker A: For legends.
00:47:55.357 - 00:48:00.061, Speaker B: Legend for legends. Yeah. And you have to ask. I mean I. I think that's the name.
00:48:00.093 - 00:48:02.025, Speaker A: Is that the name of the event? Yeah.
00:48:03.365 - 00:48:44.013, Speaker B: I'd like to from time to time just check into these events to get a feeling for different. Like, I think there's value in going to a developer centric conference to get an understanding of the developer community. There's value in, you know, going to a more generalized conference like token 24 9. Like just amaze and surprise of just how big this industry is. As we covered in the last weekly roundup, like just felt like Dreamforce. Just really gives you an understanding of like the entire apparatus of crypto, like sales and marketing teams closing business deals and just felt very different vibe and environment, which is good to see.
00:48:44.149 - 00:48:44.493, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:44.549 - 00:48:55.541, Speaker B: I don't know, I'll probably like do. It's always. I'll do a sample size. Right. Probably always go to Breakpoint. I'm not going to DEFCON this year. I just, you know, I don't like Thailand.
00:48:55.541 - 00:48:58.501, Speaker B: Sounds cool, but yeah. Bit over travel.
00:48:58.613 - 00:49:10.273, Speaker A: So we just launched, we just announced. I know we have permissionless coming up in a couple. In two weeks actually. Which by the way, we just had our two biggest ticket sale days ever. So we're probably going to increase the price. So go get your ticket. There's a code.
00:49:10.429 - 00:49:11.245, Speaker C: Empire.
00:49:11.705 - 00:49:16.361, Speaker A: I actually don't know what we're doing anymore. Empire 10 or 20 or 30. Just start typing Empire.
00:49:16.553 - 00:49:20.138, Speaker B: The discount is. Yeah, start from 50.
00:49:20.190 - 00:49:23.137, Speaker A: There could be an empire 90. Who knows? Yeah. I don't know.
00:49:23.201 - 00:49:25.245, Speaker B: Damn. I think. Am I going to get a free ticket?
00:49:25.625 - 00:49:26.765, Speaker A: Not this year.
00:49:28.225 - 00:49:55.385, Speaker B: I actually gave. I actually bought a ticket for Breakpoint because I didn't know if I was going to speak or not. I bought it like way, way back and then of course I got a free ticket as a speaker. Anyways, I was prepping for the debate and this guy's like, oh, I think someone from Coinbase was like, we need to get someone in. I'm like, well, there's no more tickets. I'm like, hey, well, here's my QR code. And the bet that I told this individual is like, as long as Coinbase prime supports withdrawals, USDC and Salana.
00:49:55.385 - 00:50:07.943, Speaker B: God damn it. This is the condition. So. Hey, by the way, Brian or whoever, like, if you listen to this, I fronted a ticket to one of your guys. So support USDC on Solana, please.
00:50:08.009 - 00:50:09.314, Speaker A: I ran into all Those guys, the F1.
00:50:09.354 - 00:50:09.721, Speaker B: All right.
00:50:09.762 - 00:50:11.615, Speaker A: How was, how was your F1 experience?
00:50:12.275 - 00:50:18.187, Speaker B: That was good. It was really good. Shout out. I mean, I went with second lane, guys. It was. I mean, I bumped into you. It's great.
00:50:18.187 - 00:50:22.451, Speaker B: I mean, the circuit is really special. It's like Monaco. But something about the night makes it.
00:50:22.523 - 00:50:23.067, Speaker A: I like the night.
00:50:23.091 - 00:50:23.227, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:23.251 - 00:50:25.855, Speaker A: Yeah. It was the first time I'd ever been to F1. It's cool.
00:50:26.315 - 00:50:31.735, Speaker B: To be fair, it's not a very good spectator sport when you think about it. Like, I appreciate it.
00:50:32.155 - 00:50:34.299, Speaker A: And then you wait like 10 minutes and then they come.
00:50:34.347 - 00:50:39.737, Speaker B: It's like a fly in your eye, in your ear. It's annoying. So. Ladies and gentlemen.
00:50:39.761 - 00:50:49.121, Speaker A: Yeah, but it was fun. We were in the. So I was in the McLaren paddock thing and Lando obviously won. So that was a cool. That, like, that was a cooler experience than actually seeing the cars fly by.
00:50:49.193 - 00:51:06.367, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's. Most people are watching TV or you want to be listening to the commentator. So it's actually, I'm surprised of like, product market fit here. Of like, I've been in many races, different circuits. It's not a really cool spectator sport. Most people go because of the allure of like.
00:51:06.367 - 00:51:36.855, Speaker B: Oh, you know, it's like these, like Greek gods go into these $100 million cars and like, they're just living the fast life. And it's like so disconnected from reality that it's. Yeah, you know, you know, there's this phenomenon of like, if it's somewhat like attainable, it generates envy and frustration. So like imagine. So, Yana, maybe your childhood friends, they see that they grew up with you and so there's an element of related. Like you can relate to that. And so a lot of times most of the envy comes from people in your inner circle.
00:51:36.855 - 00:52:05.117, Speaker B: You're like, oh, wow, this guy Johnny killed it. But you remember Johnny Stupid. Like, we're like, grew up together, you know, the same school, how this. And because it's so like close to you. But these guys, like these four wheel drivers are like on a whole new dimension. They're like, they're like Greek gods, you know, they're like, oh my God, like, you know, they're like they're dating models and like they're going from country to country racing. Like, they're just like the modern day gladiators and like someone about that like people love.
00:52:05.117 - 00:52:06.853, Speaker B: And especially obviously the Netflix series.
00:52:06.909 - 00:52:08.357, Speaker A: The Netflix series also. But.
00:52:08.381 - 00:52:10.949, Speaker B: But even before then, it's like not a very fun sport.
00:52:11.037 - 00:52:11.705, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:12.005 - 00:52:46.471, Speaker B: And by the way, like, I've met a lot of drivers here that like. Yeah, I think that it's less like necessarily skilled to be in the driver's seat. A lot of the decision comes down to less so skill, more so how marketable a driver is. So there's a reason why you have now Japanese, a Chinese and an American driver in the paddock. You know, as soon as Liberty Media bought it, like they made that transition, they added more races in these places. Huge markets, like certain drivers like Checo are very marketable. Like the Mexican.
00:52:46.503 - 00:52:48.275, Speaker A: You go to Mexico City, Checko is.
00:52:48.735 - 00:52:49.827, Speaker B: More popular than present.
00:52:49.911 - 00:52:50.651, Speaker A: It's crazy. Yeah.
00:52:50.683 - 00:52:52.011, Speaker B: The President's not very popular, but anyways.
00:52:52.043 - 00:52:54.907, Speaker A: Yeah, Check has got to be like the most paid guy on that.
00:52:55.091 - 00:53:03.491, Speaker B: No, he's not. No, no, no, not at all. But he's, he's, he's, he's very, very lucrative for Red Bull. Like, extremely lucrative.
00:53:03.603 - 00:53:08.163, Speaker A: He's like, okay, yeah, not him personally, but the amount of money that he brings.
00:53:08.219 - 00:53:23.921, Speaker B: No, he brings, Yeah, I mean, like, exactly, like the amount of merch and viewership that it attains. It's crazy. So, like, I've met for instance, the Formula E. He's a really good Formula E driver. And he's like, yeah, I was racing with Lando and Max and these drivers, like. And George, like, like I was. I.
00:53:23.921 - 00:53:36.800, Speaker B: A lot of times I won the race. Like, it was competitive. I was like, so why are you not in the paddock? He's like, I don't know. I didn't have 20, 30 million dollars to like buy a seat. I'm like, oh, okay. So you have to. I mean, there's only what, 12 cars in the paddock.
00:53:36.800 - 00:53:48.201, Speaker B: Yeah. 18, 20. No more. 20. 20. Yeah, it's like very competed, but it comes down to a lot of it. Just why I like Lewis because like Hamilton, because like the guy like come.
00:53:48.201 - 00:53:50.145, Speaker B: Most of these come from like pretty affluent families.
00:53:50.185 - 00:54:11.507, Speaker A: Like, so you see a lot or actually, we can skip that. Actually, there is one non crypto thing I want to get your take on, which is you just. I don't know if you can. We can skip we can cut this part if you don't want to talk about it. But I am curious, like you just went to this event with non crypto people, some like investors and stuff. And I'm just curious like their view on the markets and what. And I don't know if you talk crypto with them at all.
00:54:11.507 - 00:54:13.691, Speaker A: And they're very wealthy people and like.
00:54:13.723 - 00:55:21.775, Speaker B: Just I know you're a family office event here as hosted by Apollo. No, crypto doesn't come in the conversation. Everyone seems to agree the market's really expensive, we're hitting all time highs and you know, they get nervous about that. And so the theme of the conversation was you should like as a family office you have more flexibility to think longer term and so you should be investing more in the private market. So obviously you can get that pitch right from someone that their business is private markets. But I think I related to crypto because again I think I've always gotten more clarity when I know what my long term like investment. Like the longer you have, the longer time horizon you have on these things, I think it just minimizes a lot of noise and you start saying, okay, if this business is spitting out 16% cash flow then you know, it's a good solid business.
00:55:21.775 - 00:56:08.421, Speaker B: I'm willing to put it in set and forget it. Like again, I've been listening to founders podcast too. I think it's great because you know, the common theme is like businesses that control their costs survive, like Costco, Amazon, like these businesses are ruthless in terms of managing costs. And so I don't know, it's just really good. I've been hearing you hear certain like core themes come up over and over again across different investors, different, you know, people in different industries from metals and mining to technology to crypto. It's like the theme is pretty much the same but I don't know if any of that makes sense. I mean there was a lot of things that we talked about but it was just, yeah, it never.
00:56:08.421 - 00:56:42.429, Speaker B: There's like simple things, right? Like for instance, like private equity as an asset class is challenged. Like financial engineering doesn't work when you can't saddle a company with debt. When that debt and cost of service that goes up 3x we're not going to a record low interest rate environment again. So you, you have to update. Is that, is that going to be a really viable business model? Well, no. Right. So, so who, who can win? It's like if you're still, you need to buy a good asset, right, At a good price.
00:56:42.429 - 00:57:06.051, Speaker B: If you've overpaid like I guess concretely there's going to probably be a lost vintage of funds that like are not going to make any money on their investments. Like if you invested in SaaS like private, took a company private or bought it out in the private markets and you paid a crazy multiple and you were just betting on that multiple to stay the same and just like de lever and like build equity value.
00:57:06.123 - 00:57:23.524, Speaker A: Some of these late stage crypto companies got 100. They're valued at 100x revenue. Right. Fireblocks, chainalysis and they're great businesses by the way. Great, great. Fireblock is going to do like 100 to 120 million ARR. Chain 150 million ARR.
00:57:23.620 - 00:57:30.827, Speaker B: But you paid 10, 15, 20 times forward like you are. Good luck trying to get that multiple in the public markets.
00:57:30.891 - 00:57:31.091, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:31.123 - 00:57:33.235, Speaker B: So none of these companies are going to be taken public.
00:57:33.355 - 00:57:33.587, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:33.611 - 00:58:11.657, Speaker B: You're going to try to refinance that debt. Hey, different, different rate. But I think you know a lot of times like you can make money in any market condition, in any market environment there's always pockets that are overlooked. And you could say that about crypto is like a arb on like institutions not being able to allocate to the asset class since forever and now until recently you can think about meme coins as levered bets on these ecosystems and so most funds aren't going to touch them. So there's like these structural arbs that arise in any market condition. Right now most money is being invested into basically levered Nvidia. Right.
00:58:11.657 - 00:58:17.457, Speaker B: Like you're buying the index, it's passive. So active management actually becomes more interesting.
00:58:17.561 - 00:58:18.245, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:19.025 - 00:58:32.497, Speaker B: I don't know. It's just common. Like nothing will replace doing. Don't work like go do your own work. Like I don't know, it's just like no. Or pay someone. Pay someone decent amount of money to do work for you.
00:58:32.497 - 00:58:33.689, Speaker B: Like this is why I invested in.
00:58:33.737 - 00:58:35.045, Speaker A: Did you hire your analysts?
00:58:35.995 - 00:58:41.815, Speaker B: I'm working through it. I'm structurally. I also want to do a private equity fund. But that's the topic for a second conversation.
00:58:44.355 - 00:58:45.295, Speaker A: Breaking.
00:58:45.835 - 00:58:47.011, Speaker B: I tweeted about this.
00:58:47.083 - 00:58:47.775, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:48.475 - 00:58:53.971, Speaker B: But the last three weeks have been useful to people.
00:58:54.003 - 00:58:56.175, Speaker A: Like the idea when you ran and buy them in Asia.
00:58:57.515 - 00:59:30.005, Speaker B: Yeah. The simple description which I think great ideas or decent ideas can be crystallized in one or two sentences. I want to do business model transformations with crypto elements. Doesn't mean it's going to have a token. I just generally think there's an incredible amount of opportunity to Streamline friction points in different business models with crypto elements. And I'm focusing on the cost side of the equation because I know I can, I know the option value, you can drive the top line. But that's the easy part.
00:59:30.005 - 00:59:55.455, Speaker B: If I can get comfortable buying a business and underwriting a decent great return above my hurdle by streamlining friction points and costs. As an example, failed checkout, massive market. I mean massive problem. Billions of dollars at stake. I think some like 20 to 30% of all retention like churn. And some of these businesses happens because failed checkout or failed like renewal. Think about that for a second.
00:59:55.535 - 01:00:01.711, Speaker A: I know that does not but Adyon, I mean that's like. And stripe like that's their.
01:00:01.903 - 01:00:04.367, Speaker B: Yeah. Like streamline. But it's still an issue.
01:00:04.471 - 01:00:05.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:06.455 - 01:00:30.555, Speaker B: So optimizing on that like cac, you can grow ltv, you can like, you know LVMH has been experimenting with this but like instead of trying to convince businesses to adopt crypto, I'm just going to go knock on the door and buy them solid businesses and just transform it with crypto elements. And so the playbook is. It depends for the sectors that I'm focused on is consumer retail. So I've identified.
01:00:30.675 - 01:00:34.323, Speaker A: Oh, I thought you were saying you were trying to solve the failed pay the failed.
01:00:34.379 - 01:00:36.467, Speaker B: No, no, no. You're saying one example.
01:00:36.571 - 01:00:37.451, Speaker A: I get it, I get it. Yeah.
01:00:37.483 - 01:00:38.979, Speaker B: So if you're, if you're churned rate.
01:00:39.027 - 01:00:41.547, Speaker A: You move companies onto crypto rails.
01:00:41.691 - 01:00:44.091, Speaker B: Exactly. If 10%, the customer doesn't even know.
01:00:44.283 - 01:00:47.821, Speaker A: You'Re pulling the revenue immediately up 10%, 100%.
01:00:47.973 - 01:00:50.445, Speaker B: That, that is a massive unlock of value.
01:00:50.485 - 01:01:01.385, Speaker A: I had a buddy who bought SaaS businesses and the only thing he would do, I mean he did other things but like the main thing he would do, he would just double the prices just as any. Double prices? Yeah.
01:01:02.565 - 01:01:06.461, Speaker B: Loyalty programs. Yeah. Token gatekeeping.
01:01:06.573 - 01:01:07.265, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:08.805 - 01:01:28.225, Speaker B: You know, increasing ltv. Again, I'm not. That's the easiest part. Look at ALH and what they've done with NFT pendants. Digital twins, you mean like I'm. There's a couple of like core bets that I'm willing to make. Like the amount of digital purchases will not only go up to par with physical goods, but eclipse that.
01:01:28.225 - 01:01:46.451, Speaker B: Because your digital presence and identity is far more visible and important than as we consume and spend more time online. And your digital closet is fucking empty. Why is it the brands are not offering you a QR code to basically have a digital twin? It's like obvious.
01:01:46.563 - 01:01:47.019, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:47.107 - 01:01:48.907, Speaker B: And so you go in and you do that.
01:01:49.051 - 01:01:57.695, Speaker A: Yeah. Why don't we close that conversation? Because I know there's a lot more there, and then we can do an entire episode on. On the vision for what you're building.
01:01:58.395 - 01:02:17.995, Speaker B: This is not an offer solicitation, by the way. I'm just fleshing out my ideas. But the simple thesis is everyone's focused on exporting crypto inside out. And I think that no one is doing this, and the opportunity is vast. I'm looking to buy. I mean, it's. You can go and acquire large businesses and transform them.
01:02:17.995 - 01:02:19.863, Speaker B: Crypto is just an operating standard.
01:02:19.919 - 01:02:21.235, Speaker A: How much do you think you'll raise?
01:02:21.575 - 01:02:23.675, Speaker B: Oh, I know probably zero, but.
01:02:24.935 - 01:02:25.471, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:02:25.503 - 01:02:27.871, Speaker B: It just. I will find out.
01:02:27.943 - 01:02:28.823, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:02:28.959 - 01:02:33.315, Speaker B: Fuck around, find out. I'll be fucking around a lot.
