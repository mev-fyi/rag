00:00:00.840 - 00:00:11.474, Speaker A: It's really hard to want to buy one of these tokens when you just stake ETH and earn 7%, borrow against it and then use it to buy whatever you want.

00:00:47.784 - 00:01:19.530, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today we have an interesting guest, I'd say so, Santi and I have been following this account, icebergy, for many years, and we were interested to bring him on. He's an anonymous account, anonymous person, but we want to spend a little bit of time just hearing the backstory of Bergy, who is a self proclaimed dev angel investor focused on crypto, created the crypto whale bot. So, Bergy, lot to talk about, my friend. How you doing?
00:01:19.722 - 00:01:29.220, Speaker A: I'm good. Thanks for having me. This is my first podcast appearance. Please be patient with me if you know.
00:01:29.412 - 00:01:32.540, Speaker B: Santi and I have been doing this for two years. We're still learning, my friend. It's all good.
00:01:32.572 - 00:02:06.314, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the things that I always find interesting through COVID, you end up meeting so many people in the space that you actually never meet in real life. And I don't know if we've met in real life. We've crossed paths, but maybe one never knows. But if you were to ask me how to describe icebergy, the account, the way you tweet and how I'm hearing your voice, there's a huge disconnect in my brain right now. So I would just love to understand, like, just tell us your story. Like, how did you get started in crypto? Like, anything that you can disclose about who you are, like, what you pay attention to, would love to just kind of start there.
00:02:07.214 - 00:02:48.066, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess, like, I didn't really buy bitcoin in, like, the first bubble of, like, 2013, but one of my really good friends was, like, always telling me, buy it, buy it. And, like, that was at, like, $300 before it ran up to, like, a don't know. It was just so confusing. I was in, like, college trying to buy, like, like, litecoin and download this wallet, and I just, like, was like, this is crazy. I'm not going to do this. And kept in touch with them over the years, and then in, like, 2016 started getting back involved, and I just was, like, buying bitcoin.
00:02:48.066 - 00:03:30.654, Speaker A: I, like, gamble on sports, I guess, because that was kind of the only thing going on then, and just kind of, like, lost all my coins, like, gambling on sports, which obviously I should not have done. And that kind of, like, gave me a good lesson for, like, the future of, like, don't let's, like, blow these coins on stupid stuff. And then really got involved in, like, 2017 with, like, the Ico mania. And that whole hype cycle was, like, really. It was. There were a lot of, like, sketchy projects and stuff, but you could kind of see, like, where the excitement and everything was headed. And so from then just got, like, really interested in, like, ethereum and that whole ecosystem.
00:03:30.654 - 00:04:23.312, Speaker A: And then I, like, survived the bear market. I built that whalebot on telegram and just use it as a way to, like, stick it through the bear market, learn some new skills, and, like, just, like, survive. And that was kind of the hardest part, just making it through there and kind of just after surviving, you just, like, meet all these interesting people and network through Twitter. I never really wanted to be, like, a traitor or, like, like, an influencer, I guess, and then it just kind of, like, just went with the flow, and then defi summer happened, and it just kind of went from there. Mostly just focused since then on chain stuff and new projects, and. I don't know. It's just been crazy since Defi summer.
00:04:23.488 - 00:04:43.614, Speaker C: How do you look at on chain activity, and how do you kind of piece together some of these narratives? And perhaps maybe just tell us what are some of the narratives that you're paying attention to now? What are the narratives that you think are most overhyped? What are the narratives that I think are developing? Maybe people are not paying enough attention to, but will be big over time.
00:04:46.074 - 00:05:22.684, Speaker A: The on chain stuff is always very interesting because, like, a lot of the on chain, like, threaders, like, put out information that's old or, like, this whale bought this token, staked it. But, like, having a lot of money in crypto doesn't mean, like, you're like, a genius anywhere. It doesn't really matter. Like, it doesn't make you, like, a genius trader. It's like, if you saw, like, the whole peppy thing, people just got really lucky, and then there's still people writing threads about, so. And so bought a million dollars a peppy, and some of them just been getting chopped. Chopped up and losing everything they made.
00:05:22.684 - 00:06:06.024, Speaker A: So a lot of it is just, like, actually, like, watching wallets and, like, you tagging your own wallets on etherscan or there's some other apps that popped up, like, somewhat recently, like, in telegram to, like, track. There's a lot of these, like, sniper bots and, like, snipers, like, trading on chain, so you kind of have to, like, watch. And then they kind of evolved. Like, some people kind of get, like, hot streaks of, like, I guess, like, the whole meme coin kind of really changed, at least recently changed a lot of them. Like, the trading and, like, the way things have been moving on chain.
00:06:08.044 - 00:06:11.684, Speaker C: Were you a part of Pepe? Were you early to that? Did you start noticing it?
00:06:11.724 - 00:06:48.362, Speaker A: No. My friend told me to buy it at, like, $20,000, like, market cap. I was like, I'm not buying another one of these things. There was this meta on chain for, like, the longest time where, like, they would top out at, like, 40,000, not four hundred k, and then it would just be down only because everyone would just dump on you. So I kind of just got, like, really sick of it because, like, when you're bored, like, that's kind of all there is to do. Like, there's either the NFTs or just, like, punching on these random, like, meme coins. And I just got tired of it.
00:06:48.362 - 00:07:03.624, Speaker A: I was, like, not buying another one of these because every single other one of them has gone down 90%. I'm sure I bought, like, at least four or five different peppy coins in the past, and they've all just went straight to zero. And, of course, the one I, like, don't buy goes, like, $2 billion.
00:07:04.084 - 00:07:15.504, Speaker B: Bergie, do you think it's. Do you think it's more valuable from a trader's perspective, do you think it's more valuable to trade based on narratives that are happening on the chain or narratives that are happening on crypto Twitter?
00:07:17.684 - 00:07:41.968, Speaker A: They're kind of two and the same, because, like, most of the time, it's just price leading. And, like, the best, like, advertising for something is kind of like the price moving up, pricing moves up, then more people pay attention, and then it's kind of, like, not flywheel, but it just kind of, like, the momentum builds on top of itself.
00:07:42.136 - 00:07:42.672, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:42.768 - 00:07:53.944, Speaker A: And so, I don't know, it's. It becomes almost a self fulfilling prophecy of, like, as prices up, more people use it, and then just. It kind of gets the ball rolling.
00:07:54.524 - 00:08:35.716, Speaker C: I'm curious to get your thoughts on narratives. You know, it sounds like the half life for a lot of these narratives has just gone down. I mean, like, pepe, for instance, is sort of faded into irrelevance. Now. It may come back, but then you have stuff like doge that ebbs and flows, but has been more resilient. So this concept of, like, reflexivity, you know, it can really escalate very quickly, spiral up, but it can also spiral down in this sort of attention game where it's super hard to get the incremental attention. What are some of the things your frameworks to understand? Like, what's an enduring narrative? And that will persist, especially, like, as a trader, as an investor, as someone that's been around the space for so long, you kind of want to.
00:08:35.716 - 00:08:48.565, Speaker C: I'm curious, like, what your average holding period is, how comfortable you are holding things, a long term horizon, how you manage risk, maybe opening up a little bit into kind of your frameworks and your style of investing.
00:08:48.749 - 00:09:45.024, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of move a lot slower than, like, the average, like, crypto person. Like, I hold things for like months to, like years. Not years, but like a year, like the Max probably, unless it's like a major, like ETH or bitcoin. Um, so a lot of these hot narratives I don't, like, jump on right away unless it's like, there's like an actual product or like something to, like, use. Like, for example, like, I was an investor in blur and I was kind of late to it, but I didn't invest in it until I got to, like, actually use the product. It really helps, like, when you're actually, like, out experiencing and like, using all these different chains or like, products and you can actually see, like, okay, maybe I'll actually use this, or maybe this isn't just some dumb narrative. Like, I didn't really catch a lot of, like, remember the AI coins were pumping in like February? I just didn't really see.
00:09:45.024 - 00:10:19.364, Speaker A: I don't. I still don't really see AI, like, the current iteration of it, like, AI coin, until like, eventually we get maybe like some sort of like, chat GBT interface. Like a actual, like, doing the governance for people might be like an interesting thing that happens, like an ohm fork with an AI. Managing the dao would be pretty interesting to see because you'd have a really strong community following this AI. I just don't know if that's really possible.
00:10:19.484 - 00:10:29.664, Speaker B: But do you use these products because you actually find value in them or because it's the best way for you to then get Alpha by seeing what's coming.
00:10:30.384 - 00:11:12.550, Speaker A: A little bit of both. So, like, you can do a lot of, like, the airdrop farming, which is pretty, like, profitable to, like, do, but, like, then just airdrop, like, farming and using these new products, like, you can actually see, like, okay, maybe I actually do want to buy a stoke. And then you get, like, deep in the weeds of, like, the discords, the telegrams and, like, just random things on Twitter. And you can kind of see, like, after using it for a little bit. Okay, maybe this is actually useful or, like, the community strong. They actually believe that this is actually a useful product. But, like, most of the stuff on chain that's useful is just, like, trading tools, lending and borrowing.
00:11:12.550 - 00:11:17.594, Speaker A: Just like people just want leverage and just want to, like, gamble and punt on things.
00:11:20.174 - 00:11:49.500, Speaker C: I'm curious what your thoughts are on, you know, Solana, for instance, where it's perhaps still getting a lot of usage on chain, like, metrics are strong nonetheless. You know, just got delisted from Robinhood, a bunch of other apps, and it's very polarizing. And so when you look at something like that, does it, do you pay attention to that? Do you just generally, what are your thoughts on Solana? Maybe other ecosystems that are less in the limelight, you know, not a theory.
00:11:49.652 - 00:12:08.428, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I like Solana as, like, an idea, but it's just been, like, impossible to make money on it. Just every token I buy just goes straight down. Or every NFT doesn't do too high. I mean, we were of the mind.
00:12:08.476 - 00:12:28.244, Speaker C: That we fairly well, at least you portray yourself as someone that is a good trader. Is it what you just said, is that more describing kind of the current state of times where the market's been choppy? It's fairly hard to make money in the current environment or just generally speaking?
00:12:28.784 - 00:13:17.328, Speaker A: No, I would say it's been a pretty great year on chain since Al Nita disappeared. All the farming has been pretty decent. Finding a product has been pretty good. Like, you don't have, like, a perk being listed right away that they, like, just short your token, farm it to death. But, like, I just take a lot of puns and a lot of, like, opportunities, and I guess that kind of leads, like, your big winners definitely outweigh any losers. But, like, if you keep getting, like, all these paper cuts over and over and over again, like, on a certain chain, then you kind of, like, you kind of walk back and go, maybe I'm doing something wrong here. There have been a lot of, like, interesting new projects, like, dropping on Seoul, but I just don't really know who's using them.
00:13:17.328 - 00:13:50.204, Speaker A: Like, they have the whole, like, the Mev stuff, that tensor. There was another one, too. I don't know. One of my friends who's really deep in the weeds has been buying these. He sees them as, like, a very one sided bet. Like, it can only go to zero, but, like, the caps are pretty small, and as long as the team, like, is still, like, tweeting or, like, doing things, then it's probably, like, a decent bet. I just, I don't know, I just, I bought, like, a couple soul phones, like, maybe get airdrops and stuff.
00:13:50.204 - 00:14:24.904, Speaker A: So, like, I'm out here, like, using this stuff, and, like, it's even for me to, like, make money on some of these chains. It's just kind of, like, it's either too much work when you just go, like, an EVM roll up or somewhere easier with, like, new projects, new teams. Like, maybe I'm just not as well connected in, like, the Solana ecosystem or, like, some of these other chains that I don't, like, know everything that's going on there, but it just seems much, much more difficult there as of right now.
00:14:25.444 - 00:15:05.904, Speaker C: You know, as a, as a listener, they're probably wondering, you know, you started in Wall Street, Betsy talked about AMD. Now Nvidia is all the rage. Why even spend time in crypto anymore? Why not just go to a traditional market, get leverage, trade these things? You could probably use a lot of the same strategies you're doing to play in traditional markets. Liquidity is really drying crypto now, so why even stay here? You know what I mean? Why not go to traditional markets and play with the same kind of stuff? You know, you have Nvidia's of the world that can, you know, print massive candles that you no longer kind of see in crypto.
00:15:06.844 - 00:16:19.836, Speaker A: I just think it's much more competitive. I've been buying, like, AI stocks, like, since January, so, like, I still, like, do it, but, like, I just, it's much more, like, passive, turn my mind off. I just want to, like, beat the s and P and the, that's kind of it with, like, text or, like, stocks. I just think that the edge in crypto that I have and I think most people probably have is much, much higher than, like, playing in a traditional market. I always am a little hesitant to, like, trade options and do all that because I figure the person who's selling them is a little bit more sophisticated than I am and paying much more attention than like I am. You can like take punts and stuff like that. But I don't know, I think with like network and people I've met and probably most people in this space, you can still have a bigger edge in crypto than like traditional markets because I have a lot of friends in traditional markets and the work they do, they're listening to earnings calls at like 02:00 a.m.
00:16:19.836 - 00:16:33.184, Speaker A: And that's not really something I really want to be doing. And they're reading all these earning reports and comparing and contrasting of like different, different markets. And it just is a.
00:16:35.164 - 00:16:35.620, Speaker C: I can.
00:16:35.652 - 00:16:53.434, Speaker A: Have like a, you know, you can have like a telegram chat and discord channel where like everyone's working all the time in crypto and I think probably like 1020 people can probably do more research than I would be able to do on myself for traditional markets.
00:16:53.934 - 00:18:08.868, Speaker C: I think this is a really important point. When I first came to crypto from traditional markets, you're sort of thinking that especially when a lot of this information is on chain, I mean it's like continuous financial statements, like looking at the health of a protocol, looking at like Aave for instance, looking at the number of originations and positions and you sort of think like everyone's paying attention and it's going to be super competitive and you second guess yourself because you're saying, am I missing something? Like why is it, why is there a big disconnect between something that's getting a lot of usage traction but the price doesn't seem to reflect that at least what your fundamental value or your value, which is a question of itself. But then you're wondering. It's curious because there's a lot of information on chain. But my assessment is most people don't show up to discord or they're not paying attention. And you have access to these teams like it's just crazy because there is more information, there's more transparency, but a lot of people don't do the work. I'm curious, like talking about Defi, for instance, they're, you know, it's proven time and time again that it's resilient.
00:18:08.868 - 00:18:43.964, Speaker C: A lot of, a lot of activities moving on chain. You look at some like uniswap or curve, some of these protocols like continue to chug along and proven to be fairly anti fragile or resilient at least. But the price doesn't reflect that for a lot of these projects, you know, it's down only. So I'm curious, like how much attention do you pay to Defi. What your thoughts are on DeFi generally because prices really have not really recovered and have been in this kind of down only mode for a while now.
00:18:44.864 - 00:19:33.522, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Defi is actually really useful specifically for trading on chain. The one thing that's very different than like, like, punting on like a, like a perk exchange, like just a traditional, like, crypto exchange, is like, you can only. There's only so many assets and stuff you can trade. And so, like, borrowing against assets that you already own is like, it's like soft, like less leverage than you get, just like trading. But then, like, trading on like, an exchange. And that kind of opens up a lot of doors and possibilities that aren't, like, really available on chain or like, on exchanges for like, the Defi products. They're like super useful.
00:19:33.522 - 00:20:14.704, Speaker A: But like, that doesn't mean the token is going to go up. Like, we've seen this many times where like, a super useful protocol and the token doesn't have to go up. And I'm kind of like, I really like Defi. The tokens are hit or miss. The only thing I'm really concerned about is since, like, ETH staking and like, ETH deflationary, a lot of these ETH ratios are not really. It's really hard to, like, want to buy one of these tokens when, like, you just stake ETH and earn like 7%, borrow against it, and then use it to buy, like, whatever you want. A lot of people think it's because they're not returning revenues to, like, the token holders.
00:20:14.704 - 00:21:08.444, Speaker A: But even if they did that, I don't think that's going to mean the token's going to go up. You know, then you kind of get caught in like, the, the value trap of, like, this token makes this much, should be this much. And that doesn't mean you always make that much. And I don't know, you just get into a weird game of like, almost going back to traditional markets of like, valuing these things based on revenue. I don't know, I still think. Do you remember back in the defi summer, the, um, what were they calling it? The, like, app chain? Not app chain, but the app value accrual thing. I still feel like that might be possible, but it's going to take these things, like, the tokens to become like actual, like, monopolies on chain and like, kind of to dominate their.
00:21:08.444 - 00:21:31.704, Speaker A: They're already dominating their section, but real, like, I just don't know what they have to do. Like, completely dominate their segment and then get maybe more broad of like, was it horizontally? It's still just hard. Like they're all kind of trying to do the same thing to a point.
00:21:32.444 - 00:22:04.904, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean you could. It's a great point. I mean, a cynic would probably say, or just someone would say, hey listen, you're better off investing in the layer one token because that's going to capture MeV versus investing in Defi token. Even though like you still, you're starting to see these clusters. Like uniswap dominates. Like as a Dex, it just commands market share like no other aave compound. You could argue like a duopoly there maker, you know, as well.
00:22:04.904 - 00:23:00.574, Speaker C: But none of these tokens have really performed. I mean, they drastically underperform ETH. And so I guess it sort of begs the question, like, generally I found that even for early stage investing, it is very hard to outperform ETH over the medium to long term. And that was even before, to your point, where you have this deflationary asset that has a staking component to it, you can earn a nice yield. I guess where I'm trying to go with this is how has your style of investing changed since you got started? You talk about being part of the ICO craze. You talk about buying bitcoin in the early days. You have a whole range of possibilities now narratives, and it's a very expanding universe of things that you can buy.
00:23:00.574 - 00:23:18.154, Speaker C: Are you value momentum? I'm referencing traditional investing styles, but contrarian. What is your style of investing? What are some of the more useful frameworks that you hold onto to make sense of this market?
00:23:18.534 - 00:24:19.012, Speaker A: Vividly? Remember back in 2017 buying these altcoins and just massively underperforming bitcoin and also then massively underperforming ETH in certain periods. And that experience of, like, underperformance is just kind of like soul crushing. So since then, I've always, like, back in like, 2018, 2019 was you had to outperform bitcoin because that's just like, what? Well, you had to. It turned into like, outperformance and cash because everything was just going down. But like, in a bull market, the underperforming ETH, or like underperforming bitcoin, you might as well just do nothing. You're better off just doing nothing and just holding those. And outside of, like, I guess I kind of see it similar to, like, passive, passive, like investing in like, s and P 500, where, like, your main goal is just to, like, outperform.
00:24:19.012 - 00:25:07.594, Speaker A: Like a killer year is just like outperforming the spy. And so I used to use that as a similar framework, too. If I can outperform ETH and bitcoin, like, that's pretty awesome. And so just have a majority. That's kind of why I like the lending and borrowing so much is because you can hold a majority of your assets in ETH or bitcoin and borrow against that to take these smaller size, but, like, higher risk, higher reward on these, like, smaller cap potential, like, plays while still having, like, the performance of ETH and bitcoin as, like, the underlying portfolio. You just have to be very careful for something like last year to happen where everything blows up, and then the best performance you can do is just hold cash.
00:25:10.614 - 00:25:50.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, and what is your on this point? How do you think about holding cash stables? Certainly there's some risk earlier this year about holding particular stablecoins. A good deep peg. What's your latest positioning? Or how have you repositioned your portfolio over the last year or so? Where you've had multiple blow ups, there's counterparty risk, there's liquidity risks, there's on and off ramping risks. How have you processed all of that? And how have you repositioned your portfolio to weather any sort of impending wins that we're seeing?
00:25:51.654 - 00:26:49.676, Speaker A: I was pretty big into the yo farming stuff, and so that kept a lot of my portfolio and stables for a while. Luckily, I didn't touch ust or anything like that, so I've kind of dodged a lot of the on chain stuff. I just use that as, like, a way to, like, not be all in and, like, just have something on the sideline either to, like, buy a dip or, like, you know, like, when USDC de pegged, that was such an easy trade because everyone was just super panicked, and I just, like, bought a bunch of USDC and I don't know, I've seen that happen so many times. I don't know if you remember the tether blow ups where it went to, like, 0.9 quite a few times. And I just see that as if one of those blows up. Crypto is kind of, like, over, not over, but it's not going to be in a very good place.
00:26:49.676 - 00:26:55.904, Speaker A: So I just buy it, and then that's like a few, like 10%. That's pretty good for, like, a weekend.
00:26:57.724 - 00:28:04.734, Speaker C: I want to go back to comparing, like, last cycle to this cycle. A lot of times you need one or two narratives that seem subtle at the beginning to really kickstart more interest, more attention, and an enduring bull market. I guess the problem is that looking at historical restarts and cycles, you had this ample liquidity in the market because of a very record low interest rate environment. And im curious to get your thoughts on how you think about investing in a state of the world where its just very different ballgame when you have higher interest rates and less liquidity in the market for people to punt and gamble on crypto and traditional markets. Does that compute? Does that change how you think about the opportunity cost and how you think about where the space can actually go, actually recover? Does it take longer? I'm sort of curious how you process all of this.
00:28:05.914 - 00:29:06.364, Speaker A: Yeah, the whole liquidity thing definitely is effect, but I think it's kind of overblown. I don't know if you saw those accounts on Twitter just talking about the TGA, like nonstop where I've never heard anyone talk about the TGA for like seven, eight years. But it's definitely have like an impact on like, some of these coins where like. Yeah, I just see it as if prices aren't, like higher. If I don't really think prices are higher in a year or two, I think I'm kind of, like, wasting my time here. And like, if that, you know, like, if I didn't really think prices would be higher in like a year or two or like, this technology was actually, like, useful, probably better off just going to do something else. And so I see it as, like, you know, at the top, like, things are never better, never get better, but at the bottom, things are always the worst and can only get worse.
00:29:06.364 - 00:29:43.474, Speaker A: And I always think there's somewhere in the middle of both of, like, I try to, like, I definitely have a more optimistic outlook, like, majority of the time. So I just never really think things are as bad as, like, what people really think. I don't know, I guess I'm kind of just like a. Not like a dumb bull, but that's kind of like, how I position. That's why I, like, would hold, like, stables on the side. Because I know my bias is pretty heavily weighted to, like, up. But if my goal is just to survive, then I just have to survive until it's easy again.
00:29:44.054 - 00:30:56.402, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think everyone in the space generally, there's a tendency to be optimistic because you just one, you can compare it to the progress that you've made over the last six, seven years on the infrastructure side on a number of fronts. And, you know, if you liked ETH back then at 1400, like five, was it three years ago, four years ago, it's really like it now, when you have l two s, you have much more traction, you have much more narratives and use cases. But, you know, that's not to say that it's going to recover as fast, and survival is key. Right. And so I'm just kind of curious, in your mind, like, talking a little bit more about survival. Like, what are some of the things that you're doing that have been most helpful to kind of survive cycles? Like, if you could just spend a moment there, like, maybe what's starting? Like, what's your allocation? Like, at any given point in time? Like, how much do you hold cash? And I bring this up because, like, I've been listening to, like, you listen to someone like Stan Duckenmiller, legendary investor, and he says, look, I just don't see a fat pitches coming to this point. Like, I want to invest when there's a fat pitch, and right now there's none.
00:30:56.402 - 00:31:11.594, Speaker C: And it's a really tough environment, so. But people don't like to hold cash, and so maybe I'll start asking the question, like, how much cash do you hold at any given point in time, and how do you manage kind of surviving through these cycles?
00:31:12.894 - 00:31:42.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't really. I'm trying to think of how to, like, say, like, put this. I don't really have, like, an exact framework. It's kind of more just like that. And, like, if I have, like, a token that, like, just really outperformed, like. Like, just sell some to cash, you know, like, it doesn't hurt. There's always another opportunity, and it doesn't hurt to, like, miss stuff.
00:31:42.186 - 00:32:24.298, Speaker A: It doesn't hurt to, like. I mean, I've held things up multiple percentage and then just down to, like, reentry. It just kind of happens, and, like, I don't know. I don't really see. But you don't have to hit every single pitch or, like, you just don't want to, like, strike out, like, and, like, lose everything. So, like, just a majority in, like, like, the majors for now until things become interesting. I've just been thinking about this a lot lately of, like, so in, like, 2021, it was, like, pretty clear, like, layered ones would, like, take off, you know, with, like, the BSc season.
00:32:24.298 - 00:33:39.974, Speaker A: And if I were to tell someone now of, like, if someone asked me, like, what crypto do I buy to, like, make a ton of money? I don't know. You know, like, it seems a little bit more obvious back then, but even now, like, some of the market caps are pretty high. So, like, I've just been trying to like, think about, like, what's, like, for, like, next cycle or, like, next kind of narrative, like, what will really outperform. And it's just like, you just have to think about it for a long time and, like, maybe there isn't one and maybe it's just ETH or, like, maybe it's just bitcoin, especially with all the regulations and stuff. So for, like, surviving, I think I do like 30, 20% to 30% cash and then just stables and then, like, majors and then maybe like 20, 15% for, like, duramate. So it's like 30 cash, 30 stables, and then ETH bitcoin and then, like 1020 percent for, like, speculative plays. Like, any deals that might come through or, like, some hot narrative pops up.
00:33:41.114 - 00:33:49.918, Speaker C: When you're holding just before we move on. Jason, just on this point alone, like, curious if you've diversified away, you say you have cash, not stables.
00:33:49.966 - 00:33:54.454, Speaker A: That means you sort of like stables. I use them like, interchangeably.
00:33:54.614 - 00:33:54.934, Speaker B: Got.
00:33:54.974 - 00:34:02.994, Speaker C: Okay, so, like, roughly, if I'm hearing you right, it's, what is it, 40, 60% at any given point in time? Stables?
00:34:03.694 - 00:34:05.354, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds about right.
00:34:06.134 - 00:34:10.362, Speaker C: Wow. Are you know some of the yields that stables or.
00:34:10.498 - 00:34:14.226, Speaker A: Yeah, here and there when it was crazy.
00:34:14.250 - 00:34:22.658, Speaker C: Now that, like, what are your thoughts around, like, defi yields, like the yield on stable coins? Like, you're better off, like, buying treasuries. Why not? Just.
00:34:22.706 - 00:35:12.756, Speaker A: I've kind of, I've kind of walked away from it in the last couple of months just because the yields aren't really worth it. But there was a good time where it was like 20, 30% for like, like two years. That's like, pretty, pretty good. I need to figure out something to do with that, like, the stable allocation now because I feel like, yeah, I don't know. The yields haven't been very good. And then, like, I don't really want to buy t bells because I figured you'll outperform buying, like, this year buying stocks, but here already pretty allocated a stock. So I don't really want to chase that crypto the regulations a little bit iffy, get through the other side of that.
00:35:12.756 - 00:35:33.074, Speaker A: Like, maybe the XRP thing goes through and be much more heavily allocated. But I don't know, a lot of, like, I just did a lot of, like, lending and borrowing with my e. So that was kind of like how I used that as, like, very low leverage. And so that's kind of why I held a lot of cash or stables.
00:35:33.374 - 00:35:50.634, Speaker C: Yeah. Absent in this conversation was nfts. I'm curious do you think about one nfts? Because you mentioned blur. Do you think about nfts in this portfolio? Or do you just have a separate bucket collectibles? They don't even compute in the investing kind of portfolio bracket.
00:35:51.774 - 00:36:23.834, Speaker A: Yeah, no, the NFTs are. I always write them off as zero. And that's like a added bonus of like, okay, I sold this for x amount. That's pretty, like, you know, it's pretty nice for nfts. I haven't really seen, I don't know, the NFT summer was crazy where you just buy Artbox for 0.1 ETH and sell them for like three to five and just, people weren't really paying attention to, like, art blocks. And I don't know, I feel like that eventually comes back, but in like a different way.
00:36:23.834 - 00:37:06.014, Speaker A: I don't know if you've seen recently, like, the Jack butcher stuff's been really popular. Like, the NFT people have kind of, like, written off and have, like, abandoned nfts. I feel like to, like, trade meme coins. They've sold all the NFts to buy meme coins. So I still think, like, NFts are, like, super interesting, but they're more of like a, they're like fun something to do. So, like, you don't like trade up and chop and like, lose all your money. It's kind of just like a time investment to keep yourself busy because, like the best nfts I ever, like, bought were, like, cheap and like, they didn't really, like, have like a meaningful impact.
00:37:06.014 - 00:37:24.576, Speaker A: But then other people started to, like, think they were like blue chips or like something like super valuable. And so I don't know, I, NFTs will come back, but they're like how having their own little drought, I'd say.
00:37:24.760 - 00:37:27.484, Speaker C: 2018 moment for ERc. Twenty s, I guess.
00:37:28.544 - 00:37:44.084, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't really, the thing I'm worried about nfts is, again, like, the ratios. Like, if you can just stick your ETH, why would you put 50 ETH into something? Yeah, they might go up in, like, dollar amounts, but I don't really know if they outperform in, like, ETH terms.
00:37:45.444 - 00:38:29.764, Speaker C: No, certainly I'm curious, generally speaking, when you make an investment, and I've heard you say you have different, sometimes you look at it in a short term basis, but it's never more than it sounds like a year, do you go into an investment or a trade with a particular number in mind of when you punch out, it becomes too big a percentage of your portfolio you clock, you beat the spy, you beat the benchmark, whether ETH or bitcoin. I'm curious how you think about. Or if you even think about, look, if it reaches this price, I'm out. If it's 20% this year, I'm fine with. And anything above 20, I'll just cut and go to stables.
00:38:30.824 - 00:39:12.930, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, like, another one. Just depends on the market of, like, I've had some mistakes of, like, you know, trading your p and l or trading, like, your unrealized gains. And, like, I. From my experience, just, like, setting an actual number you want to hit for a certain investment just never has worked out well for me. And I look at it more of, like, a market cap kind of thing. If it's at this market cap, then okay, like, I should just. Even if I don't really want to, I'll just take some off because I know I have, like, a bullish bias or, like, I'm not really probably, like, thinking clearly, so I don't know.
00:39:12.930 - 00:39:44.326, Speaker A: And then I've had it the other way of, like, just selling too early and you miss out because you're trading, like, a number and not, like, you know, like, the trade still going. There's still, like, there's momentum. I don't know. I think back it, like, there's some podcasts I listen to. A lot of crypto stuff kind of depends. I don't really fully believe it, but the whole ta stuff, I don't know. I've gotten much better at.
00:39:44.326 - 00:40:29.974, Speaker A: Okay, this is kind of died off. The momentum stopped, and I don't know. It's still just something I'm not perfect at to exit something for, like, now I see it as maybe it's a little different because, like, a bear market, and I still might want to own these tokens if things turn around. And so I don't really. It's kind of, like, market dependent and, like, how things are going. And, like, you can answer a little bit. You can kind of tell, too, with, like, euphoria of, like, people on Twitter where, like, they're like, do you remember that safemoon guy, like, screaming and April 2021? I was like, oh, okay.
00:40:29.974 - 00:40:39.754, Speaker A: That's probably, like, I don't know. There's, like, little signs and stuff of, like, okay, maybe it's time to pull a little bit off.
00:40:41.454 - 00:41:06.476, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Thales, a new frontier in simple on chain options. Here's what you do. You choose an asset, a strike price, and the market you want to participate paid in, and that's it. With its powerful and capital efficient Amm based architecture, Thales is able to offer low fees, automated liquidity and effective utilization of leverage. With no funding rate and known payouts. They just launched this new UI. It's super clean.
00:41:06.476 - 00:41:25.984, Speaker B: Step one, you choose an asset. Step two, you choose a strike date. Step three, you pick a market and choose the USD amount. Getting exposure to crypto assets price action has never been easier because of thales. Here's what you got to do. You got to go to Thalesmarket IO t h a L e S market IO. Thailey's market IO.
00:41:25.984 - 00:41:42.788, Speaker B: They're on arbitrum and optimism. Go play around. Choose a crypto asset, choose a strike date, pick a market, choose the USD amount. Bada bing, bada boom. Check out thalease market. Let's face it, concentrated liquidity is hard. And that's why I'm super excited to partner with carbon for empire.
00:41:42.788 - 00:42:29.456, Speaker B: Carbon is a new Dex on Ethereum that makes concentrated liquidity easy. With carbon, LP's can now automate your liquidity strategy with custom on chain limit orders and range orders. Want to buy a token when it dips and sell it when it spikes? With carbon? You can now set a strategy that buys in on one price range and sells in a higher range on repeat. Using a single source of automated rotation. Liquidity strategies can be created for any standard ERC 20 token. I recently checked out the carbon beta that just dropped pretty blown away by the liquidity strategies that carbon enables on chain. It has these rich trading features that you'd expect from a centralized exchange, except carbon is fully on chain, decentralized and non custodial.
00:42:29.456 - 00:42:53.116, Speaker B: Just connect your wallet. It's carbon defi XYZ. That's carbon d five. Choose a trading pair, set your buy and sell ranges and amounts. Hit create and you're done. Carbon automatically moves your liquidity into your selected ranges as the market moves. Last but not least, I'm excited to announce that carbon is running a ROI trading competition until July 11.
00:42:53.116 - 00:43:21.840, Speaker B: Here's how to play super easy two steps. One click the carbon link in the show notes. Two create a new carbon trading strategy. You are now eligible to win USDC rewards based on the performance of your strategies. LP's it is time to take back control of your liquidity with carbon. Check out the link and get started today. Now let's get back to Empire Bergy I want to get your take move away from the trading side a little bit and just talk about a couple of the big topics that are happening right now.
00:43:21.840 - 00:43:35.664, Speaker B: So one of them is roll ups and just like the L two space. But would be curious to get your take on, like, optimism versus arbitrum and just, I guess, what's happening in the roll up in the L two space in general right now.
00:43:36.364 - 00:44:19.886, Speaker A: Yeah. There just seems like a very big disconnect of communities between optimism and arbitrum. It's always seemed like, I guess, because arbitrum was more of an open starting point when they launched, so more projects were open to building there. I don't know if you remember there's like that nigh on cat on Arbotrum that everyone's like, farming. It was like all of Arbor Trump ETH was in this nyan cat or arby cat kind of thing. And I think that kind of, like, started the, like, degen kind of, like, aspect of, like, arbitrum. It was just like a very different set of communities.
00:44:19.886 - 00:45:00.264, Speaker A: Like, the optimism one seems much more maybe like, I don't really know how to put it, of, like, a vc focused kind of thing, where a lot of people just seem to hold their tokens and don't sell them all the time. So things kind of just behave very differently than, like, an arbitram. An arbitrage is much more like degenerate or, like mercenary capital, where, like, they're looking for, like, a quick trade, quick flip. And outside of some of the few major ones that have been big success on Arbitram, it's kind of like, it's very fast. It moves much faster.
00:45:03.964 - 00:45:16.954, Speaker B: How do you see the role of space playing out once all the ZK evms get launched and go to Mainnet, maybe later this year, the scrolls of the world, do you think that, what's the impact on the. On the L two space?
00:45:17.614 - 00:46:18.494, Speaker A: See, I don't really know, because, like, the optimistic ones, the optimistic ropes just have, like, a pretty big lead on them, which is like, people building on them, users comfortable with them, and then the Coinbase, really, the Coinbase chain will be very interesting to, like, how they direct people in there. Like, if you saw, like today, Robinhood's like, making everyone sell. If they don't pull out the Solana, Matic and Cardano, and I think they'll drive a lot of trading volume through their wallet to get people over there. And I just don't know how the ZK, like, roll ups catch up to kind of like the head start they got. I know, like, they'll be, like, supposedly more efficient, cheaper to use. You can withdraw your money really fast. But if, like, Coinbase is the bridge endpoint for some of this stuff, you can still move your money around pretty fast.
00:46:18.494 - 00:47:11.108, Speaker A: And so I think it comes down more to what becomes, like, a better user experience. Where will people want to be trading? Where will they be able to make more money? The meme coin and stuff on ETH, that was just people throwing around crazy amount of money to buy these meme coins. And you didn't really see that on any other chain. And I just don't see how some of these things get that sort of traction or, like, people using them outside of, like, a token. And, like, the token, everyone's just farming. Like, if you look at the user metrics of, like, the ZK stuff, I know it's still early, so it's hard to, like, verify, but, like, it just seems like it's just people like farming. Yeah, like, the airdrop.
00:47:11.276 - 00:47:27.044, Speaker B: Bergie, do you think one thing that we haven't seen is value accrue to nfts on anything basically outside of ETH? I guess you had it with the mad lads in Solana a little bit, but do you think eventually nfts can get big on roll ups or. Not really, yeah.
00:47:27.084 - 00:48:11.306, Speaker A: So I've been thinking about this, too, of, like, why that happened. And I think it's similar to, like, the meme coins where, like, that's, like, where the liquidity is, and that's where, like, people are, like, taking puns and, like, aggressively buying things, whether or not it works out for them. And I guess the NFts maybe didn't take off on roll ups or anything like that because, like, opensea wasn't deployed there. And, like, that was more of, like, a muscle memory of, like, when you wanted to go buy an NFT, you just went to opensea. Like, that's just where everyone was. That's where all the attention and money and everything was. There's just not really on some of these other chains, it's just hard to keep track of everything.
00:48:11.306 - 00:48:53.354, Speaker A: Like, all these NFTs, and if they're not, like, going up or like, you're just holding, there's no buyers, then people just get impatient and just, like, floor it and get out. So I think it kind of has to do with, like, the attention and there wasn't, like, opensea wasn't deployed there and then. Yeah, maybe also too, like, the NFT people, like, you couldn't create, like, your sometimes, like, you couldn't put your profile pic on certain chains or anything like that as, like, your twitter profile. So I don't know, it was kind of a lot of things but I still feel like they should eventually, but I just don't know what's holding it back.
00:48:54.194 - 00:48:58.374, Speaker B: Yeah. Bergie, what do you think is the most misunderstood thing in crypto right now?
00:49:00.434 - 00:50:26.970, Speaker A: That's, I think, probably just, like, the meme coins of, like, a lot of people think it's, like, I get, like, people by the top lose their money, but, like, just please don't, like, put all your money into your meme coin. But, like, I don't think people understand, like, the meta of, like, how intense, like, the things have changed around, like, meme coins and, like, the attention they've been getting. It just seems like it's, like, a offshoot of, like, there's, like, a very big disconnect between the people trading these and, like, people, like, trading on, like, exchanges where, like, some of the tooling and, like, to, like, buy and snipe some of this stuff on chain has really, really changed in the last few months where, like, one of these bots, it's a little. It's not. You don't hold your own keys, so you have to, like, give your money to the spot to, like, do everything for you, but you can, like, click buttons to trade for you. And it was really one of the top, like, earning defi protocols, which is really crazy. I just think people don't really, like, the market's telling you where everything's kind of going to, like, this shit, coin casino kind of thing, but a lot of people are kind of afraid to, like, admit that.
00:50:27.122 - 00:50:38.254, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Anything we haven't talked about that you think is really interesting or overhyped or under hyped or other things you're paying attention to that we haven't talked about.
00:50:42.764 - 00:50:57.984, Speaker A: I've been trying to think of, like, what could, like, revitalize, like, defi. I don't really know, like, what does it. Do you guys have, like, any thoughts on that? I'd be curious to hear, like, what you. You think? Because maybe you've seen something that I haven't.
00:51:01.204 - 00:51:03.940, Speaker C: In terms of narratives, like, what.
00:51:03.972 - 00:51:09.944, Speaker B: Brings back Defi summer, another defi bull market? I mean, it's been yet two years since we've seen the bull market in Defi.
00:51:11.104 - 00:51:12.684, Speaker C: I think regulatory clarity.
00:51:13.344 - 00:51:14.124, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:15.824 - 00:51:39.894, Speaker C: You know, you mentioned the XRP case. Generally speaking, I feel like if that goes through in a positive manner, I think I'd like to see the design space for token. Tokens really kind of come back, because I think it's been hampered dramatically by this limbo and regulatory kind of uncertainty.
00:51:40.394 - 00:51:47.134, Speaker A: And I've been seeing a lot of teams, like, very hesitant to drop a token now, which.
00:51:48.874 - 00:53:03.312, Speaker C: Doesn'T make sense from a timing perspective. The market's soft, you have regulatory risk, but you have to do it at some point. I mean, we go back to this idea where like, it was like blockchain, not crypto. And I'm very much of the mind that you need to have a token for these things to coordinate activity and to decentralize and to, you know, compensate people. And the value accrual is set in a way in the, expressed in a token. I'm very much of that belief, and I would hope that with regulatory clarity, we can have a path forward where we can actually just think more clearly and objectively about how to design tokens without, with a clear framework in place to say, okay, we're going to follow these rules. It could be, you know, fine, we're compliant, we're okay, we're following this playbook to eliminate regulatory risk and then just think clearly of how to design airdrops, how to just, I think it just frees up a lot of mental health, like, a lot of headspace that has been going to navigating this uncertainty that is in the market.
00:53:03.488 - 00:53:55.436, Speaker A: Yeah, I clearly remember becoming almost like a bitcoin maxi in 2019 where it's like, everything. Why does this need a token? But I definitely changed my mind of probably everything should have a token, whether good or bad. At least you should try it. But now navigating around these, like, we can't do this because blah, blah, just seems like you're taking too much like, mental, you know, like, mental energy to like, it should just be a token. It shouldn't really be. And should have like, these set frameworks where like, you can have like a value accrual of it without having to, like, walk around the lines, you know. Yeah, I guess that would probably be like the most, like, I just don't know how the XRP case will go.
00:53:55.436 - 00:54:04.780, Speaker A: It seems like they'll probably seems like things are going good with some of their things they've acquired recently.
00:54:04.892 - 00:55:00.616, Speaker C: But I think I saw an interesting data point today. I don't know how true this is, but they've earmarked and or split, spent 150 million on this defense XRP has, and Coinbase and Binance apparently is earmarked over a billion. And I'm not sure how, again, haven't verified this, but if it were to be true, I mean, putting aside figures, I would think that, look, both Coinbase and binance and grayscale have plenty of resources to, to fight this. And I think the outcome of that is positive. I've been encouraged by the courts and how they're interpreting it. And the hope would be that we get finally some rules in place, some guidance. You already have, Mika, in Europe, the UK is coming out with clear guidance.
00:55:00.616 - 00:55:11.314, Speaker C: I think that's all it really needs. I mean, I'll ask you the question, like how much capital do you think has been on the sidelines over the last six years because of this regulatory overhang?
00:55:14.254 - 00:55:52.526, Speaker A: I just don't. Because some of the big funds raised a ton of money in 2021 and it didn't really seem like they could allocate all of that. So I don't really know if there was that much money on the sidelines waiting to buy. And then like bitcoin, ETH, they both have, like, I think most people consider them commodities. I'm sure there's people who don't. So I don't really know how much money is on the sideline. Maybe it could be like a career risk of like you don't want to be buying this because like of regulations if you're like in traditional finance.
00:55:52.526 - 00:56:05.714, Speaker A: So maybe there's some money on the sideline there. But the only thing that gives me a little bit pause is these. Some of the big VC funds weren't able to allocate, it seems like, all their capital in crypto.
00:56:07.214 - 00:56:20.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good point. Fair point. I mean, a lot of those strategies are early stage. Like some of these funds just want to allocate into private stuff, which is capacity constraint. Would agree there. But.
00:56:22.014 - 00:56:33.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess they don't really have a mandate to be buying things. Their mandates to like go buy early stage stuff. So I don't know, maybe there is actually a decent amount on the sideline.
00:56:35.234 - 00:56:57.818, Speaker C: Yeah, I just generally think like a lot of people have turned away from thinking about crypto, even nfts, if you're. Because of this regulatory overhang. Now, encouragingly, we're seeing brands like LVMH, like just tread along and Nike and some other. Just look at. I think NFTs are in a different position.
00:56:57.986 - 00:57:01.894, Speaker A: That soul bound one was kind of interesting that they're, they're coming out with.
00:57:06.034 - 00:57:32.336, Speaker C: But yeah, I don't know. I mean, it legitimizes a space. At minimum credentializes it. It allows us an industry to move forward and have a stronger defense. I think still there is a lot of room to meet this narrative and promises with actual product. I think there's always that deficit we saw it in prior cycles. I think there.
00:57:32.336 - 00:57:38.872, Speaker C: It continues to be here today. Like, gaming, we're nowhere near producing, like, super high quality games. It's gonna take time.
00:57:39.048 - 00:58:01.344, Speaker A: Yeah. The gaming thing always has given me a little bit of pause. Like, you can. You can see the vision, but the execution of it just seems so difficult to actually pull off. I don't know what it takes to actually pull it off. And I just don't really. For most people, I don't really think it, like, for people in crypto, it's not very.
00:58:01.344 - 00:58:04.252, Speaker A: It's just hard to invest in or buy.
00:58:04.428 - 00:58:05.224, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:06.444 - 00:58:11.224, Speaker A: Because you have to, like, play the game to know it's good. And that takes a big, like, time investment.
00:58:12.984 - 00:58:22.644, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Anything else? I mean, questions for us or just things that are on your mind you're paying attention to that you want to talk about?
00:58:23.664 - 00:59:06.784, Speaker A: You know what, actually, the social media stuff is kind of interesting, too, just the user experience of it and, like, crypto. Like, the two main ones are, like, warpcaster and lens. And, like, the apps are pretty good. They're useful, but I just don't know what takes it to get the snowball rolling of people, like, actually logging in there and using it. And that kind of ties into, I guess, like, the meme tokens were kind of, like, not. They were a decent iteration on, like, the social tokens, which people always, like, talked about over the years. But I don't think it was a very good iteration of it.
00:59:06.784 - 00:59:27.294, Speaker A: But it might be, like, laying the groundwork for it. But you can get a lot of trouble for that stuff. So I just don't know. I can see kind of, like, where it might go. I just don't know how the execution of actual social tokens might implement in the real world.
00:59:27.954 - 01:00:02.454, Speaker C: Well, let me ask you a question. Obviously, there was bitcloud that gave a coin to each creator. Is a creator coins? You're someone that has 100 plus, 130,000 plus followers on Twitter. You produce good content. Did you ever want. Are you dismissive or where do you stand in terms of bit cloud type? I'm not saying just bit cloud, but just the idea of having a token representing your social currency. Do you think that this is, like, steam it?
01:00:02.494 - 01:00:02.670, Speaker A: Right?
01:00:02.702 - 01:00:30.386, Speaker C: Like, do you think that that tampers with. A lot of us just are on Twitter because that's where we engage with people, but you're not doing it to. To, like, be a paid chill, you know, like, in many ways, I think it may tamper with the genuine aspect of you just want to engage and you want to communicate. And the minute you introduce, like, value to that, you. It sort of distorts it in a very different way and it just changes the game. Some people might like it, others don't. Right.
01:00:30.386 - 01:00:38.814, Speaker C: I mean, there's a bunch of influencers out there. I'm curious, like, what are you, where do you stand in terms of bit cloud models creator coins?
01:00:40.554 - 01:01:42.894, Speaker A: I've always seen, like, I, like, didn't want to be like, an influencer, I guess. So I just use it as, like, a way to, like, network and talk to people and, like, keep active. Like, ask what? It's like the best Google in the world where you can just ask questions and ten people will tell you right, ten people will tell you wrong, and then it's like a very good public chat room. I wouldn't want to, like, have a token, but I would want to maybe, like, punt on it, like, buy other people's tokens because, I don't know, I think it would be kind of fun, interesting, but they can see it kind of going a bad way, too. So the bit cloud, they just, yeah, that was a weird one. I didn't really know what was going on with that one, but maybe I don't really. I feel like you just have to try it and see what happens, but you have to be very careful because it can go very wrong, you know, and that can kind of kill, like, one of these platforms.
01:01:43.194 - 01:02:03.574, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, we announced lens this week. Like I was in a best friend lens. I mean, I have a good relationship with, with the Aave team and Stani. I created my lens profile to be very transparent. It is hard to change your flow. You're used to going on Twitter and that's where the conversation is.
01:02:03.574 - 01:03:02.982, Speaker C: And I've talked to Stani about ways to kind of insert yourself in that flow. And the thing that comes to mind is, can you create some sort of app where if you tweet, it automatically posts on lens, like by default? And then as an initial hook just poured over the content. Airbnb did this great strategy where they reverse pulled all the listings that were on Craigslist and then just slapped a really nice picture because Craigslist is kind of shady for real estate listings. And then they just hired photographers, created beautiful UI, Ux and pictures, and that was really all it took to kind of source all the inventory and the content to the platform. If you could somehow do that, you know, I think what was encouraging at the time where I started looking at lens was, you know, this time where a lot of people got the platform right. You had, like, president of the United States. It's losing his Twitter account and people get shadow banned.
01:03:02.982 - 01:04:01.866, Speaker C: And it's, they've been changing the algorithm so much that it's difficult to understand how, like, sometimes it's just, it's been difficult to understand engagement. And if I don't, like, I think about it, but I haven't seen it in practice. But I think if someone were to, like, say, hey, go to lens and look at your profile, like, if assuming you already have the content there, like, all my tweets are on lens, and then someone could say, hey, look at all these analytics of, like, hey, look at. You can maybe play around with curation and engagement and, like, like, maybe that's what, like, there's, like, there's going to be. I think if these things ever work, there's going to be a killer function value add that you don't have on Twitter that allows you to connect with your audience, understand engagement, and maybe get higher. Like, right now, I'm really lost in. Every week there's changes to the Twitter platform.
01:04:01.866 - 01:04:12.694, Speaker C: Like, right now, I look at comments and then there's, like, somehow there's like a, there's a relevant, you know, I mean, like, if you scroll down comments and then you see, like, uh, what is it?
01:04:13.274 - 01:04:15.538, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, yeah, they throw, it's like a.
01:04:15.586 - 01:04:24.298, Speaker C: Discover more. Yeah, discover more. I'm like, guys, no, like, I don't care about that. Like, you're messing my brain too much. There's also.
01:04:24.346 - 01:04:26.442, Speaker A: This search is completely broken.
01:04:26.578 - 01:04:42.690, Speaker C: Search is broken. Um, you know what else? Uh, you know, the, the classic one that always gets me is like, the. For you and following, I'm like, just don't show for you. I'm just, this is the reason why I just follow certain people.
01:04:42.762 - 01:04:48.254, Speaker A: Like, I've seen, like, three people die on Twitter in the last, like, day. It's been pretty awful.
01:04:48.874 - 01:04:49.530, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:04:49.642 - 01:04:54.454, Speaker A: And so I don't know why they put those out there. Like, for just in the for you page.
01:04:54.934 - 01:05:30.290, Speaker C: You know, generally think, like, there is some interesting experiments going on in Twitter where it felt like it was super static for such a long time, you know, subscribers. And there's this idea that subscribers able to get the emails from there. You know, all these things are, like, interesting. But that's not to say that that's where I am. Like, if I'm the lens team, I'd be looking at saying, you know, there's a big part of creators and, you know, people that are on this platform that would appreciate being perhaps more targeted in the curation and the content generation. And, like, look. Look at Facebook.
01:05:30.290 - 01:05:51.590, Speaker C: Like, I haven't been on Facebook since years because the feed went from being, hey, this is cool. An aggregated view of my friends, too. This looks like Times Square, and it sucks. I want to get out of here as quickly as possible. Just, you know, I mean, it's terrible.
01:05:51.782 - 01:06:09.790, Speaker A: These, like, the social media. You just need a reason to, like, open the app, like, once a day. That's, like, really what they need to, like, work on. If you can find a reason and then it becomes, like, muscle memory, you can have a reason to, like, openness to, like, look at it once a day or, like, once a week or something like that.
01:06:09.822 - 01:06:11.846, Speaker C: Like, yeah, just habitual becomes a habit.
01:06:11.910 - 01:06:32.774, Speaker A: I don't know. But then there's all those other ones, like the blue sky in Nordstrom. I haven't even. And then Instagram was supposedly coming out like a Twitter clone. It just seems like too much, but I feel like there's. There has to be some opportunity here for something like that. It's just kind of like a forgotten aspect of, like, crypto.
01:06:32.774 - 01:07:17.436, Speaker A: If you remember back in, like, 2017, there were all these crazy ideas people have. I thought, like, lending on chain was, like, the dumbest thing. I was like, why would I ever want to win like, crypto? Turns out that was, like, actually a pretty good use case. But there are a lot of things from that cycle where, like, okay, now it makes sense. Like, in practice, there's got to be a bunch of those ideas from past cycles, even the. Even this past one. And, like, nfts and just crypto in general, that I probably have a big use case in the future or not use case, but maybe a hype cycle or someone actually builds something interesting.
01:07:17.540 - 01:07:44.874, Speaker C: Mm hmm. It's a great observation. I've been thinking more about. Let's go back to some of the things that we were bullish on in the last cycles that didn't end up working. Let's revisit that, because in that list is going to be a killer use case, because the infrastructure is different, the environment's different, especially in crypto, where you have, like, the infrastructure deployment cycle is such, where you have layer two. It's just a different ballgame.
01:07:45.454 - 01:07:49.790, Speaker A: Yeah, the layer two is really open up a lot of, like, more computational.
01:07:49.942 - 01:07:53.114, Speaker C: That you reopen the design space in an interesting way.
01:07:53.414 - 01:08:12.374, Speaker A: You just have to be careful because, like, a lot of them, that's like, the bugs and stuff and some of that stuff, like, a lot of them shouldn't be happening, of like, they're just common mistakes that just slip through, whether, I don't know, some. Some of them might be intentional, some of them are just honest mistakes.
01:08:12.874 - 01:09:07.444, Speaker C: One of the best traders, I think it was Kobe or someone else that said, like I heard him say, he was telling me, like, the best investments that he'd made was not the first iteration, but the second iteration, the second best idea. Like he said, I made way more money on litecoin than bitcoin. Or, I mean, I'm quoting, but not say it was Kobe, but like, you know what I mean? And in many ways, that was my thesis. With Ave, you were, you had compound, it had raised money from well known VC's, but then you had land at the time and it was public and the team hadn't given up. And it was the same model, but it was trading at like a quarter of the valuation or so, but at human capital loan, you were in the money. And I think oftentimes we get caught up in look, narratives are important in the space, and sometimes a lot of these projects may not recover because they're just an attention economy. If you're not in the top 100 coins, it's really difficult to gather attention.
01:09:07.444 - 01:09:45.124, Speaker C: But I think fundamentally over a decent amount of time, to your point, on tracking on chain activity using these things, I think you get a lot of confidence from it is price is super important, but ultimately, I think it's. You have faith that over time, if something is delivering value and people are using it, it's going to get more attention. And if it gets more attention, then it's more users show up and it sort of restarts that cycle. And if it's not that protocol, it's another protocol, right? If it's another. If it's not, you know, a derivatives platform on Ethereum, maybe it's a derivatives platform on an l two or some other chain, you know?
01:09:45.164 - 01:09:48.664, Speaker A: Yeah, just some of like, the user experience needs to, like, improve.
01:09:48.844 - 01:09:53.804, Speaker C: Yeah, well, sir, I mean, isn't everything in crypto?
01:09:54.264 - 01:09:58.312, Speaker A: Have you ever been liquidated on chain and then, like, you go to check, your money's just gone?
01:09:58.408 - 01:09:59.016, Speaker C: Oh, boy.
01:09:59.080 - 01:09:59.884, Speaker A: There's no.
01:10:01.424 - 01:10:18.414, Speaker C: I've been liquidated. I was liquidated on chain in that black Thursday. I had some positions in Dydx and Maker and I was like, okay, DyDX especially was, was, had a really faulty oracle and, and it was. I lost a fair amount of ETH on that one.
01:10:19.394 - 01:10:31.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just like, you don't get any email you just go and like, oh, unless you have like, a wallet tracker where like, you get alerts and stuff. It's like, oh, yeah. I mean, that's not good.
01:10:31.274 - 01:10:48.558, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no notice, it's, it's like, thanks for playing. Come back. Not even come back later. It's just like, thanks for playing. The defi saber, for instance, was something that I discovered in that process, like, automatic, like, like, refill and managing a position. You're not going to get a call, but at least they're smart contracts. And I'm not endorsing people should do their own research.
01:10:48.558 - 01:11:20.924, Speaker C: But for me, I looked at that and say, oh, it's pretty cool functionality where you set the limits of when a refill collateral automatically so you don't get liquidated. And of course you're trusting flash loans and their ability to execute these transactions and rebalance the position so that you don't get liquidated. What usually coincides with a really congested environment. High gas fee environment, but, yeah, like, yeah, you know, I think we learned through fire, I guess, in many ways, as early beta testers in crypto.
01:11:21.264 - 01:11:53.468, Speaker A: Yeah, it just comes with the territory, I guess. But, like, that's kind of like the user experience on some of these, like, perp dexs and shit. It's. You can see where it's headed, but it's still, like, unironically early where, like, there's no way some of this stuff will get, like, adoption. But you can see, like, the groundwork being laid of, like, where this could potentially be, like, used. And I think, like, a lot of people just miss that. Of, like, it's always like, no, like, this is the worst.
01:11:53.468 - 01:12:16.072, Speaker A: Why would anyone use this as, like, stupid, pointless, and I don't know, like, a lot. Like, we sure use, like, crypto quite a bit for, like, not having many use cases, even if the current use cases are mostly, like, speculation and, like, just trading, which, as far as a.
01:12:16.088 - 01:12:18.164, Speaker C: Question, do you think that's bad?
01:12:18.784 - 01:12:25.434, Speaker A: I don't really think so, but I can see why people would consider it not very, like, productive to society.
01:12:26.414 - 01:12:38.870, Speaker C: Well, does. By that token, does that not render Netflix, Hollywood, Vegas, all kind of sport leagues not economically productive and bad for society? And though they should be all go to zero.
01:12:39.062 - 01:13:19.248, Speaker A: No, I don't think it's, like, a bad thing. I just think it's. You listen to these people and it's like, crypto is, like, the gonna save the world, save society, unbank the bankless, and I think you kind of get distracted and, like, the current iteration of it and you can't, you don't, you kind of lose sight of like, what, like bitcoin and like, ETH and like, these things could actually end up doing. It doesn't really make a lot of sense. Maybe not a lot of sense. Take that back. Of like, the use cases in different countries are very different.
01:13:19.248 - 01:13:50.214, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people don't really realize that because they've never lived anywhere else. So most places, you don't have to worry about capital flight. You don't have to worry about your dollar devaluing or access to a bank. But even in western countries, banks are kind of a pain in the ass to deal with if you want to transfer a certain amount of money. And with reason, I mean, there's reasons why those laws exist, but it's still just, I don't know, a pain.
01:13:51.434 - 01:14:47.072, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I think we could, as an industry, be more honest and at the same time realize that, you know, a big part of this is just greater consumer preference and optionality, and that's a good thing. Anything that enhances that, especially in a transparent manner, you know, is good. And people are going to do things that they value. And whether you, you know, the role of, of a regulator should not be to have an opinion on whether a particular thing has value or not, is whether, just to make sure that if people are going to show up, that it's an equal, fair playing ground, you know, with access to information. And, and, and that, I think, is something that sometimes is lost in so many people where, you know, government is, is there to police, but not to having to tell people what their preferences should be or should not be. Everyone at the end of the day is, it's a free society.
01:14:47.072 - 01:14:58.324, Speaker C: Like, people have independence to do whatever they want with their money. They want to send it to Ben ETH. Well, you know, just, just at least make sure that you understand why you're sending it and what you're going to get out of it.
01:14:59.264 - 01:15:29.836, Speaker A: Yeah, some of those seems to be a pretty big disconnect in some of this where like, you know, like, in traditional markets, getting, like, data or like, any of this information can be, like, pretty hard to, like, come by and crypto is like, the most, like, open. You can get, like, data from any exchange super easy. And I don't know, it just seems like, it seems like one of the most free, not like it's perfect, but like, it's pretty open and accessible to just about anyone.
01:15:29.980 - 01:15:31.956, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%.
01:15:32.140 - 01:15:41.844, Speaker A: Whether, like, you know, you're trading like, like a jpeg with like a cat on it. Like, that's fine. Like, go for it. There's nothing wrong with that to me.
01:15:41.884 - 01:15:42.404, Speaker C: Absolutely.
01:15:42.484 - 01:16:01.896, Speaker A: I mean, and I kind of think, like, speculation drives like, innovation to where, like, you need, you need people speculating, you need, like, people experimenting or else, like what? I don't know. How do you know if anything is usable or, like, an actual product that could be without people speculating?
01:16:02.080 - 01:16:29.164, Speaker C: It was true for the Internet and has been true for pretty much every major breakthrough tech out there. And so I think we're in. Just got to remind ourselves of that and allow for that creativity to flow. And, you know, as you said, the most important thing is reminding ourselves of the core elements here, which is it's a more transparent, equal playing ground. And that is the most important thing. How can we do, how there are things that certainly we can do on the regulatory side to make sure that that fairness and transparency holds true. Right.
01:16:29.284 - 01:16:56.818, Speaker A: But a lot of that data, yeah, most of its on chain. Some of the token unlocks and, like, actual token metrics, not metrics like tokenomics, have been, I don't know, there's a lot of room to improve there. Definitely improve. It seems to be getting a little better. But, like, defi llamas, the amount of data that DeFi llamas put together is pretty, like, incredible.
01:16:56.946 - 01:17:02.602, Speaker C: Yeah. They now have a vesting tab, which is not perfect, but at least it's a great step to illustrate that.
01:17:02.778 - 01:17:13.230, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good start. There's a big disconnect from reality and what people see.
01:17:13.402 - 01:17:42.314, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, this has been a fascinating discussion. I mean, it's just so interesting to get into your brain as someone who, you know, I followed on Twitter by just getting to know the person behind the profile. As we think about wrapping this up, I just want to ask it like, one or two questions. One, like, how optimistic are you relative to, like, six months ago, relative to last cycle? Like, if you were to, on a scale one to ten, how do you, where do you stand right now in terms of state of the industry and how excited you are about it?
01:17:43.814 - 01:18:31.396, Speaker A: I think it comes in waves where, like, things will be super interesting, like, this year where, like, there'll be some new, like, thing to do on chain and then it just stops all of a sudden. But I don't know, it's in like 2018. 2019. People are always, like, clamoring for, like, an altseason, but I feel like we'd never the all season, like, never really stopped since, like, defi summer. It was just really crazy. Because, like, some of my friends made more money this year than, like, almost in, like, 2021 from just, like, you know, like, the meme coins or, like, certain things they've done on chain, which is just, like, really crazy because, like, you see everyone on twitter, like, it's over. There's nothing going on.
01:18:31.396 - 01:19:03.418, Speaker A: And it just seems like there's always been a very big disconnect from, like, people just trading on exchanges versus, like, actually going out and using the stuff to, like, experience what's actually going on. So for, like, my level of, like, I don't know. I try not to hold. To, like, have, like, a strong opinion here. It just kind of seems like, whatever, I think it continues. Um, but I think we've seen, like, the low. I just don't know what.
01:19:03.418 - 01:19:27.904, Speaker A: Other than, like, finance getting absolutely, like, frozen website shut down, what could actually, like, send us back to those lows? So I'm kind of just, like, neutral of, like, there'll be, like, certain narratives, certain new things that pop up, but it's not, like, go all in, lever up, we're going to the moon. Just kind of, like, wait and see.
01:19:28.804 - 01:19:33.636, Speaker C: What was that thing? Popped it. Not that. Never.
01:19:33.820 - 01:20:06.074, Speaker A: Just, yeah, balanced tinkering. Go airdrop farm. And see, like, I also think, like, a lot of exchanges probably won't be listing tokens for, like, as hell as it did in the past. So we'll have to see how that changes the market. And I don't know, maybe we go to, like, everyone's on chain. It'll take a little bit, but because the products aren't as good, it's more expensive than trading on exchange. It's more expensive.
01:20:06.074 - 01:20:31.834, Speaker A: You can lose your money pretty easily, but I think most of the opportunity will be in, like, on chain stuff of any. It could be any. I have no idea what it could be tomorrow, you know, because I didn't really see, like, the peppy stuff. Like, I didn't see it going in a billion, $2 billion. It's, like, really insane until, like, it really started going. Well, I guess I missed that one.
01:20:33.094 - 01:20:44.374, Speaker C: Well, the one thing's for certain, we're gonna. By nature of how fast the space moves, you're gonna miss stuff. But thing is, I think just consistency and being patient and just curious, I guess, pays off.
01:20:44.414 - 01:21:11.434, Speaker A: Yeah, curiosity and, like, never being afraid. Never, like, being afraid to go try something or, like, kicking yourself and, like, oh, I missed that one. I should have. That one's always been, like, the worst mindset because there's always something else that can come. It's okay to miss things. It's okay to, like, not catch everything, but you just have to pay attention and, like, don't give up is, like, how you can, like, do well, I think.
01:21:12.414 - 01:21:23.508, Speaker C: Sage advice, iceberg eat. Thanks so much for coming on this. A pleasure getting to know you, and I think our listeners would appreciate that as well. So great discussion. Really enjoyed it. And thanks again for taking the time.
01:21:23.676 - 01:21:24.356, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:21:24.460 - 01:21:25.244, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
