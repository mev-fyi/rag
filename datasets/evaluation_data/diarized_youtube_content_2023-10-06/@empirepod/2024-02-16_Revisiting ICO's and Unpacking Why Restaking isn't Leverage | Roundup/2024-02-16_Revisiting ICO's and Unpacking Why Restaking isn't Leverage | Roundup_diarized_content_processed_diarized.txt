00:00:00.160 - 00:00:19.994, Speaker A: I said, the top ten to 20 crypto assets will have an ETF in the next three years. That was my tweet. I stand by that. And I think the timing factors in that there's an election this year, that things are slower and perhaps the next administration is more friendly. But we now have a bitcoin ETF. We likely may have an Ethereum ETF later this year. An ETH ETF.
00:00:19.994 - 00:00:23.914, Speaker A: That setup is just incredible.
00:00:25.334 - 00:01:01.878, Speaker B: If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain. And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain, to put it nicely. That is why we are incredibly excited to have the wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast, stewards of the wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show, we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole NFT just for empire listener. This episode is brought to you by Paypal here at Empire. You know that Santi and I are really into real world use cases and always on the lookout for the next killer blockchain app.
00:01:01.878 - 00:01:23.274, Speaker B: We're excited to share that PayPal has arrived in crypto to unveil a way to seamlessly connect fiat to digital currencies. Later in the show, you will find out how you can use PyUSD to check out at millions of online stores. And we're back. What's up, man?
00:01:23.614 - 00:01:24.834, Speaker A: Hey, how's it going?
00:01:25.534 - 00:01:30.264, Speaker B: Good. I can't tell. I can't tell. The mood you're in today.
00:01:31.364 - 00:01:40.516, Speaker A: I'm in a mood. I'm not in a mood. I'm just, you know, this is the one of the funnest things I do every week, so, you know.
00:01:40.580 - 00:01:44.864, Speaker B: Nice, nice. What's going on? How's the week been?
00:01:45.764 - 00:01:50.508, Speaker A: Really good. Really good. Cycling. It's cold, but it's good.
00:01:50.636 - 00:01:52.276, Speaker B: So you back home?
00:01:52.300 - 00:01:57.804, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, back home. It's good to be back and just have a routine for once.
00:01:57.884 - 00:02:03.144, Speaker B: Nice, nice, nice. Yeah. Awesome, man. Well, we had a. We had a crazy week, huh?
00:02:04.124 - 00:02:09.452, Speaker A: Yeah. It's always eventful. What has been going on? What's on your mind?
00:02:09.508 - 00:02:15.964, Speaker B: Which we talk about. I want to talk about a couple things. So you've been using Farcaster. I'd love to get your honest thoughts.
00:02:16.124 - 00:02:17.100, Speaker A: I joined forecaster.
00:02:17.172 - 00:02:30.764, Speaker B: I did join Forecaster. We got you. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on after having used it for weeks. That's one. Market's ripping, right? Bitcoin's above bitcoin's. Sitting 52 today. ETH is sitting at 28.
00:02:30.764 - 00:02:41.624, Speaker B: Solana, 115. Right. Things are. Things are moving. So I'd love to hear your take on the markets just where we're at. I'd love to. Excuse me, I'd love to talk airdrops.
00:02:41.624 - 00:03:11.996, Speaker B: Starkware Airdrop happened this week. Decent bit of controversy around it in terms of they did this basically thing where I think they started the vest two years ago and did, like, a secret unlock that two years ago. People like, I don't know, some people really liked it, some people didn't like it. So we should talk airdrops. And I think that'll lead into a. I want to have a conversation with you about, like, just how the fundraiser funding markets work, fundraising markets work in crypto. And I don't think a lot of people understand what's happening in the private markets today with these kind of, like, special rounds, venture funded rounds.
00:03:11.996 - 00:03:26.970, Speaker B: I want to kind of peel the curtain back on those, and then I. Maybe we can get into a conversation about. There was a Chris Berniske tweet talking about restaking as leverage and. Yeah, maybe we can, like, open that conversation up and talk about it.
00:03:27.122 - 00:03:28.654, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds great.
00:03:28.994 - 00:03:46.144, Speaker B: Cool. We. I also will just say I heard you guys feedback about the Das ads on this episode. So I think if our producer gets my message in time, we will not have a das ad on this episode. We're trying to make the ads more interesting. Ads are interesting in crypto because.
00:03:48.084 - 00:03:48.492, Speaker A: They.
00:03:48.548 - 00:04:10.024, Speaker B: Don'T work like traditional web two ads, in the sense that it's very expected to have ads in web two land. In crypto, people are very adverse to ads. So we're actually working on some stuff at blockworks to try to figure out how we can make ads more interesting. So, anyways, we hear your feedback on the Das ads. Pulled them from this app. Going to make them a little more exciting. Click the link.
00:04:10.024 - 00:04:27.564, Speaker B: Santi. Let's start with the market. So bitcoin's up 16% week over week. ETH is up 17%. Solana is up 11%. Avalanche is up 18%. Yeah, markets.
00:04:27.564 - 00:04:46.898, Speaker B: Markets cruising. We are now sitting at 52k, up from basically three weeks ago. Bitcoin was sub 40k. Bitcoin was sitting at 39. We're up to 52. Um, largely, I would say, driven by. People are surprised at the x, uh, at the flows of the ETF.
00:04:46.898 - 00:05:11.032, Speaker B: Um, and I think there was a couple of weeks ago, uh, Chris Berniske came out and basically said, look, I think we. We chopped for a while, uh, some. Some people obviously agreed with him because he's been so right for a while. Ari Paul came out and said, um, look, I'm on the other side of, you know, Arthur Hayes and Chris. He said, look, I'm, I'm, I'm tentatively on the other side of the sell the news meme. I'm betting against Arthur and Chris. I don't have much opinion on the macro side view that is kind of a toss up over the next three months.
00:05:11.032 - 00:05:45.394, Speaker B: But on the crypto idiosyncratic side, we see very low leverage levels, neutral sentiment, healthy market positioning. And he said, I think the pattern matching of the ETF approval to previous events like 2017 futures listing are actually bad analogies. All of those comparable events occurred far later in the bull cycle in context of a far greater bullish leverage and hype. In my opinion, we are in medium term, medium timeframe bull trend prices likely higher in six months. So that was Ari's take so far. Ari seems to be right and I'd love to get your take. And just like in terms of how you're thinking about this market today.
00:05:47.494 - 00:06:44.076, Speaker A: I've said it a number of times, it's really hard to be like you can be right in weak and then wrong in a month timeframe over long time horizon. Bull posting does incredible wonder is because bears eventually get liquidated and die. And so I agree with the latter part of the sentiment, which is, yes, I don't think this is like bitcoins at 52. There's nowhere near attention there on bitcoin, even though we had the most probably if you were to go back five since I've been in the space, if you were to ask me what would have been the biggest events that would solidify this as a asset class, it would be an ETF approval. We've had it and it's been largely okay event. And maybe it's because we talked about it for so long that once it happened, it was a bit of a baby blues kind of situation, but inflows continue to be really strong. We're nowhere near hype.
00:06:44.076 - 00:07:21.002, Speaker A: And so that's, I think, really positive open interest leverage in the system doesn't seem to be as high as in Defi summer. And so I agree with that. I think were in a prolonged bull market. Bull markets also exhibit drawdowns from time to time, week on weeks. You study every single cycle. You would have had moments and weeks where the market was down 10%, 15% depending on thats for bitcoin and ETH. Now the beta on Alts is even higher.
00:07:21.002 - 00:07:51.284, Speaker A: So its just important to like factor that in. And so, yeah, it's pretty crazy that we have an ETF approval. Inflows are really strong and we're debating for bull or bear market. Also, I just want to point out one thing. Every time I try to time these things, I just remind myself of how small crypto is. I'll give you an interesting stats here for all the AI folks out there. Nvidia this year is up 44% year to date.
00:07:51.284 - 00:08:49.994, Speaker A: They. So this year alone, Nvidia has added around 550 billion in market cap. That's a third of all crypto, give or take. So just whether you want to, I think it's a useful comparison because crypto is a drop in the bucket. So I say this also because I don't think crypto is getting enough attention at all by traditional allocators. From time to time, ping some of the larger funda funds and the institutional allocators, at least in the western hemisphere, are not touching crypto yet. And maybe you're doing that through an ETF, like registered investment advisors to some extent, but alternative investments like money flowing into hedge funds and venture funds in the space is basically zero.
00:08:49.994 - 00:09:25.644, Speaker A: So I think that's also a good barometer of where we are in the cycle. I think we're early and it feels, putting aside all the macro stuff, geopolitical stuff, election stuff, you know, this is a very small asset class. It is a real asset class. Just got an ETF approval now. I think one of the things that I was thinking about this week is there's no shot in my mind that we don't have at least five to six to seven ETF's in a two to three year time horizon.
00:09:27.464 - 00:09:30.444, Speaker B: Five to six ETF's for different.
00:09:30.744 - 00:09:53.588, Speaker A: The top, call it. I said the top ten to 20 crypto assets will have an ETF in the next three years. That was my tweet. I stand by that. I think the timing factors in that there's an election this year, so things are slower and perhaps the next administration is more friendly. But we now have a bitcoin ETF. We likely may have an Ethereum ETF later this year.
00:09:53.588 - 00:09:58.984, Speaker A: An ETH ETF. That setup is just incredible.
00:09:59.414 - 00:10:15.142, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you. I just showed that chart for anyone who's watching on YouTube, but if you, if you look at this year, bitcoin flows have, uh, bitcoin ETF flows are 4.1 billion. Gold ETF flows are -2.4 billion. I was trying to find the exact data.
00:10:15.142 - 00:10:52.858, Speaker B: Some people had minus two. Some people had actually minus five or 6 billion stuff to find the exact number. But, uh, basically it looks like Gold ETF's or capital and gold ETF's is now flowing into bitcoin ETF's. And I mean, if you zoom out and just think about, like, the ETF flows so far are beyond the wildest dreams of. I think Nick said this, Nick Carter said this. Well, like, beyond the wildest dreams of any of the most bullish analysts. If you go back and read the analysts predictions on Wall street from November December and into early January, before anything happened, what's happened so far is beyond the wildest dreams of any of the most bullish analysts.
00:10:52.858 - 00:11:19.658, Speaker B: And if you, I know you've talked a lot about, like, the sales orgs at these places. Like, a lot of the asset managers haven't even activated their sales orgs. Right? Like, a lot of the, these financial institutions, like Blackrock hasn't even like, turned on their sales.org when they're talking about bitcoin. Like, it's not like that's been rolled out across the entire company and, like, has been taken to. It's still very, very early days. And, yeah, it's pretty crazy.
00:11:19.658 - 00:11:34.094, Speaker B: What do you mean by, what do you mean when you say that the LP's, the money isn't flowing into the venture funds in crypto yet? You're saying when they're, a lot of them are raising and they're having a tough time raising.
00:11:34.554 - 00:12:07.344, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And Fonda funds in the US, based in the US. My question to them was like, are you getting interest from family offices, endowments, pension funds? And they're like, no, not for crypto. I think most people are just busy clipping Nvidia gains and money market gains. Yeah, it was interesting. Also, Coinbase activity, they reported earnings this week. The stock has done a, since December, has kind of went all the way up to 160, down to 110, and hovered pretty volatile range.
00:12:07.344 - 00:12:50.380, Speaker A: JPMorgan, for instance, had a bearish call on the stock. They abandoned that. Today they're moving to neutral stance again. I think analyst sentiment towards stock like Coinbase is also indicative of how the market's really thinking about it. I think the reason why they were bearish is not just on crypto alone. It's the fact that the ETF now allows people to just go direct and have exposure, as opposed to having a proxy exposure through Coinbase. But nonetheless, I mean, I just think it's anecdotally, a lot of banks are not even recommending buying the ETF.
00:12:50.380 - 00:13:09.424, Speaker A: If they get interest from clients they can purchase on their behalf. But they're not calling, you're not picking up the phone and kind of doing a boiler room operation of just pitching at least the larger registered investment advisors, wealth managers. I don't think many of them are just proactively calling clients about this stuff yet.
00:13:09.764 - 00:13:10.584, Speaker B: Yep.
00:13:11.924 - 00:13:34.784, Speaker A: And maybe Hunter from Bitwise, which they just crossed a billion, he might have a different opinion on what type of rias. And if you were to canvas the entire Wall street apparatus, who is really actually flowing, driving, flows into these vehicles, I would argue that it's not the JP Morgans of the world.
00:13:35.104 - 00:14:00.704, Speaker B: Yeah. If you look at, I think this is a good barometer of how folks are feeling. So why combinator, the big accelerator, put out their request for startups? I don't know. If you can see, if you're watching on YouTube, you can see it on my screen. And they put out a bunch of, there's basically 20 requests for startups. Better enterprise. Like better enterprise SAS glue, eliminating middlemen in healthcare, a way to end cancer.
00:14:00.704 - 00:14:18.148, Speaker B: AI to build enterprise software. Llms for manual back office processes. Only one out of 20 of these was related to crypto. And it's stable coins. It's called, it's number 15. It's stablecoin finance. And I did a little command f here for crypto.
00:14:18.316 - 00:14:19.428, Speaker A: Oh, did you?
00:14:19.596 - 00:14:45.088, Speaker B: I did, I did. There's no, there's no mention of crypto in all of y combinators request for startups. So I think that actually is a decent barometer for like, the sentiment from, from outside the industry. And I, I sent this tweet out and I stand by it. I don't think mainstream sentiment picks up until we hit all time highs. Right? Like, bitcoin ripped through fifty k. First of all, timelines, pretty quiet.
00:14:45.088 - 00:15:12.742, Speaker B: Bitcoin ripped through 50k. Timeline was pretty quiet. Bless you. Uh, and I got, I got zero text. I got literally zero texts from friends about bitcoin hitting 50k. My guess is it gets crazy once bitcoin hits 65 or 70k, because at that point, anyone in the world who has ever bought bitcoin at any time in their life is now in the money. And when you're in the money, you look at your account, you say, oh shit, I'm up a little bit.
00:15:12.742 - 00:15:17.034, Speaker B: Let me start paying attention to this thing again. So I think that's when it starts to get crazy.
00:15:17.854 - 00:15:18.914, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely.
00:15:19.694 - 00:16:02.094, Speaker B: Yeah, we're, we're definitely entering phase two of the bull market, though. It's a, it'll be, it'll be cool to see. How does this impact how you think about like buying stuff and like allocating to the liquid markets? Because if you remember our episode six months ago, we said, look, you know, there's actually a ton of opportunity in the, in the liquid markets. And you had actually, I know you, you do a lot in the private markets. You, this was maybe six or nine months ago you said, actually, I'm having a lot of fun, like looking at the public markets and buying things like, you know, that are, that are, that I think are really, really cheap and completely liquid. How does this, like, numbers are going up, prices are getting back to near all time highs for some things. How does that impact how you actually think about allocating just into the liquid markets?
00:16:03.474 - 00:16:19.294, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I haven't really revisited my strategy as of late. I think probably I want to skew more liquid over the next three or six months, nine months.
00:16:19.654 - 00:16:21.078, Speaker B: You want to skew more liquid?
00:16:21.206 - 00:17:23.454, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm less certain about how 2025 is going to shape up. I also think, I don't know, like funds in the space, there's like some overhang where you have high water marks and a lot of them are trying to just like finally are coming up for error. I don't know how that plays in. I think one of the things that I'm going to be really paying attention to is how these starcor is a, probably a good example of pretty old project, been in development for a number of years. How does that trade and how do VC's, the larger wallets that are getting their allocation, how are they behaving? Are they holding? Are they selling? I think it'd just be interesting how that rotation happens. But otherwise, I mean, I still mostly do early stage and I continue to just recycle money into early stage.
00:17:23.454 - 00:18:10.946, Speaker A: I'm of the mind that the things that I think more about is like categorically am I over, over or underexposed to a particular sector or theme or ecosystem? And that's where I try to pay the most amount of attention. Um, inherently, these things have a short duration. So I think of them, like, while early stage crypto, yes, is kind of like early stage, the duration of it is, is pretty short in the sense that I don't, I feel like I don't need to pay as much attention to. There will be a liquidity event, most likely, where, I mean, you could have liquidity on, on something after three years, which is really short for venture, I think. But I care more about just, I think in this business, you cannot miss a big. A big. A new.
00:18:10.946 - 00:18:56.402, Speaker A: A new trend, a new project. Like, if you miss Celestia, well, are you exposed? Like, you haven't exposure, modularity? If you don't have exposure to an ecosystem like Solana while you in sui or say, or aptos or whatever, like, paralyzed, you know, chains. So I think these are sort of the thing, like, are you underexposed to gaming? Overexposed to it is. Those are the things that I think more about less. So you're right. There was a time where I felt that it's good to monitor private valuations, on average, for seed, for a, for b, and how much money is flowing into that relative to kind of valuations of liquid tokens that may be teams that are farther ahead, but the token is just really abandoned. Right.
00:18:56.402 - 00:19:04.482, Speaker A: Falling off the cliff, off the top 100. So that's where I might find opportunities. I was doing a lot of that over the last six months.
00:19:04.658 - 00:19:17.614, Speaker B: Is there a certain point in the market where you basically just say, hands up, prices are too high? Let me just sit. I'm allocated. Let me just sit right now, and I'll wait to allocate in the next market when the prices go back down?
00:19:21.794 - 00:19:23.094, Speaker A: Yeah, there is.
00:19:23.874 - 00:19:24.322, Speaker B: There is.
00:19:24.338 - 00:19:50.082, Speaker A: And sometimes you go to conferences and you see a lot of exuberance, and it's like, like, scene from the big short. That's when the easy, really easy money starts flowing in. I think it gives me. This is part of the reason why I don't like to go to conferences, because every time I go to them, it's. I get. I get that desire to sell, but I shouldn't, because, you know, if you hold for 510 years, it's like, you know, it's.
00:19:50.098 - 00:20:12.564, Speaker B: Okay, so here's a story for you. So I was. I might have told you this already, so just stop me if I already told you, but I was sitting. So this is breakpoint 2020, 1 second week in November. And I was at the multicoin party at Solana, breakpoint in November of 2021, which is basically like. Yeah, it's at the rooftop. Yeah.
00:20:12.564 - 00:20:20.520, Speaker B: Oh, hello. I actually did see you later that night, I think, at the Delphi at that.
00:20:20.552 - 00:20:22.960, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that was the day after. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:23.072 - 00:20:56.626, Speaker B: Ridiculous Delphi party. But, um. Okay, so I'm sitting next to, uh, Ed Moncado, or Ed Moncada, uh, the found the founder of Blockfolio, who ended up selling blockfolio to FTX. And, uh, he's just sitting in the back and I go sit next to him. What's up? Been a while. And, uh, he goes, look at, look at this. So, I mean, I don't know if you remember, there's that wall of, like 20 year old kids who were all like, MIT and Harvard dropouts and all the VC's were like, basically walking next to each of them, basically talking to them about their startups, and, like, kids were literally getting funded, like, on the spot at this multicoin party.
00:20:56.626 - 00:21:15.352, Speaker B: And Ed goes, look at this. He goes, see all this? See all of this? See those kids? See them getting $50 million pre seed rounds. He goes, sell it all. Sell everything you own. And that night was the literal top of the market. So. Yeah, yeah.
00:21:15.352 - 00:21:52.094, Speaker B: Um, okay, let's, let's, uh, let's, let's switch gears a little bit. So you mentioned, um, is starkware. Um, so Starkware had an airdrop this week. Strk. Um, uh, I would say there was some controversy around. So I think they did a similar, like, distribution strategy. So it was a, I think it was like, 12% grants, 10% foundation, 8% unallocated 2% donations, 9% to the community in rebates, 9% in community provisions, 33% to core contributors, and 17% to starkware investors.
00:21:52.094 - 00:22:37.804, Speaker B: You tell me if I'm wrong. I think that's relatively similar to how other folks like Arbitrum have done it. Anyways, they ended up launching on. There's this platform, aevo, that does pre market, basically can tell you, like, what the price is, and you can kind of trade and go long or short. Pre the token going live, it was trading at like, buck 75, which gives it an implied fdv of $17 to $18 billion. For reference, the fdv of other l two s, and I get the whole fdv is a meme, whatever, but for reference. So starkware at 18 billion, optimism is 16 billion, arbitrum is 20 billion, IMX immutable, 6 billion.
00:22:37.804 - 00:23:16.480, Speaker B: So it's trading around, like, in between, basically optimism and arbitrum. The. So I think all of that was fair. All of that was fine. I think the controversy was that I should really pull this up so I don't botch this, but something along the lines of, they did a secret unlock about two years ago to start. Basically, they basically distributed the tokens quietly two years ago so that the vesting period would actually start before. So that if you're like an investor or you're an employee, you can actually sell instead of basically getting that token.
00:23:16.480 - 00:23:29.250, Speaker B: When the token goes live, like everybody else, then you have to wait. A lot of people do. Four year vest, one year cliff. Now they can actually sell it much sooner than other people. So I don't know if you followed this whole thing.
00:23:29.432 - 00:23:41.674, Speaker A: Well, I was following it also. It was hard not to because there was very visceral reactions to it. Some people seemed to like it, other people seemed to not like it. And the meme, of course was like, if you got the airdrop, then you liked it. If you didn't, then you didn't.
00:23:42.294 - 00:23:42.702, Speaker B: But.
00:23:42.758 - 00:24:01.334, Speaker A: So anyways, it was, it was interesting. I don't know, I can't think of like retroactive airdrops have been a thing, but this, when you call it secret vesting, it may imply that it was like not disclosed to some, but to others. But I. It's interesting.
00:24:01.374 - 00:24:01.846, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:24:01.910 - 00:24:11.966, Speaker A: The FDV, I think, is a little bit whack. But, you know, see how, let's take a normalized view like over the next 30 days of how this thing trades. Right. But, yeah.
00:24:12.030 - 00:24:20.790, Speaker B: Why do you think. Why do you think it's out of whack? Because someone like, I think they're, I think their TVL is like sub 100 million. Is that, is that why not so much TVL?
00:24:20.822 - 00:24:27.882, Speaker A: It's just, what is it? 17 billion FTB? Yeah, I guess it's like right in line with arbitrum and optimism trade, so.
00:24:28.018 - 00:24:28.578, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:28.706 - 00:24:32.294, Speaker A: Maybe it's not that out of whack, actually. Yeah.
00:24:33.634 - 00:24:36.534, Speaker B: I don't know. But congrats to starkware for getting the.
00:24:36.834 - 00:24:38.374, Speaker A: They've been on development since.
00:24:39.274 - 00:25:16.162, Speaker B: I'm actually, I've actually gotten to know their team decently well over the last couple months. And I'm a big fan of what they're building and like super sharp develop sharp developers. Um, and like, what they're doing with Cairo is like a very, very difficult thing and a lot of developers really like it. Like basically choosing Cairo I think was this tough as the programming language was like this tough decision that will eventually be rewarded. Um, the, but my feedback to the starkware team is, uh, the air, bad airdrops don't actually matter that much. People move past them in a week. Um, and people move on to the next airdrop.
00:25:16.162 - 00:25:45.866, Speaker B: Right. Remember last week everyone's talking about dimension, now everyone's talking about starkware. Next week someone's going to be talking about the next thing. My feedback to someone like a starkware and two teams doing airdrops is there's always going to be people who are angry with you and like these, like airdrop farmers and things like that. There's always going to be thousands of those who are mad at you. If you let yourself get consumed in the emotion of, like, dealing with those people, uh, and you snap back harder than they're kind of coming at you. It reflects really, really, really poorly on your brand.
00:25:45.866 - 00:26:09.324, Speaker B: And I think starkware got caught up on that. I saw some screenshots on Twitter of, like, some folks on their team, like, going off on people, and it's just a bad look that, like, then that actually reflects negatively on your brand for, for more than just the week that people are upset about the airdrop. So I agree. Get your thing out there, make the announcement, write a really good blog post, and then shut the hell up for a week is my feedback.
00:26:09.704 - 00:26:10.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:11.584 - 00:26:11.936, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:11.960 - 00:26:37.288, Speaker A: It's never easy, I think, airdrops, you're going to invariably alienate costs and controversy, people that didn't. You never get a perfect, but. So, yeah, I mean, I think as good as any, I think in terms of the allocation, the way the mechanism and whatnot. So I was surprised. I thought I was going to get a yes. Like, they mentioned some ecosystems, like immutable, that you've gotten airdrop. And I checked some wallets and I didn't.
00:26:37.288 - 00:26:39.284, Speaker A: So it was a bit odd.
00:26:39.864 - 00:26:47.176, Speaker B: Yeah, I had that with a, I had that with dementia because I got some, I got some pudgies and I was, I didn't get anything. And I was like, what am I?
00:26:47.280 - 00:26:51.124, Speaker A: Maybe the snapshot. Yeah, it was pretty post snapshot, I guess, maybe.
00:26:51.544 - 00:27:25.080, Speaker B: Yeah. Because I originally, I think I actually thought I had some at some point. And then I went back and checked and I didn't have. So anyways, it doesn't matter, but it actually brings up a bigger question of, like, we talked about these airdrops last week, and I've been thinking about that conversation a lot. I would love to just expand on, maybe peel back the curtain a bit on what's going on in the venture markets and how these things are actually happening. And I tweeted this thing out about icos. What do you think of the way that the current system.
00:27:25.080 - 00:27:50.964, Speaker B: Okay, so for people who don't know, the way that the system is set up today. All right, so actually, six years ago and seven years ago, there was these, basically the way that Ethereum went live was with, this was basically with like, the first ICO, or at least the first popular. I think it was actually the first ico. It was like a crowd sale. And for anyone who was around in 2017, you probably remember these ice. The ico mania, basically. And every day there was a new ICO.
00:27:50.964 - 00:28:28.516, Speaker B: It was essentially like. It was essentially like chasing tokens and, like, kind of airdrop farming. Like, everyone's chasing these icos, and there's new hot ico, and you would go on them. The way I did it was, I would, like, go on my ether wallet, it'd go on my ether wallet. And then there'd be an ICO, and you'd send some Ethan, and you basically cross your fingers and hope that something happened on the other side. Hope that the ICO eventually went live, and then you would get those tokens, and then you would hope that that basically worked out. The ICos ended up getting a really, really nasty reputation for, I would say, two reasons.
00:28:28.516 - 00:28:46.302, Speaker B: One is, uh, a lot of the companies and founders back then came in at the end of 2017, and they were just chasing. They're. They were like. They're kind of quintessential scammy crypto people. And they were, like, not good founders. A lot of them were pretty damn crazy. Uh, nearly every single person lost money on icos.
00:28:46.302 - 00:29:19.926, Speaker B: Like, it just was not a good system. The second reason it got a bad rap is the. It was the 2017 version of. Of leverage. So, if we say that Genesis and Blockfi and those folks kind of pumped the market higher than it should have been in 2021, icos pumped the market higher than it should have been in 2017. And the downside of this is that there was this basically cliff. The market fell off a cliff because all the icos had to essentially sell Ethereum to keep funding themselves.
00:29:19.926 - 00:29:49.450, Speaker B: Because you would send in your ethereum, they would send you the tokens, their treasuries. There weren't stable coins then, really, except maybe, like, tether and stuff. But, like, they would denominate their treasuries in ETH, because everyone thought number was continuing to go up. So now all these companies were sitting on a big bag of ETH, and to keep funding themselves, they kept selling ETH, which then caused ETH to go down. It was this nasty, reflexive thing. So then what happened is all these venture firms were started. So pre 2017, there really weren't many venture firms.
00:29:49.450 - 00:30:32.944, Speaker B: It was like, maybe Pantera who, blockchain capital. There are a couple of venture firms. Then there's this huge wave of venture firms that raise money. Paraphy framework, all the classic ones. I think, actually, polychain maybe was around earlier, but all the venture firms, electric, Dragonfly, etcetera. Now, the way that the venture world works and how the fundraising market works is there will be your traditional fundraisers where you will lead, like venture firm leads around, or whatever you want to call it. And then in between some of these rounds, and especially pre TGE, pre token generation event, there's a strategic round.
00:30:32.944 - 00:31:30.246, Speaker B: And that's when the company goes out and says, hey, look, we're raising at a billion dollars from Andreessen, but you, influential angel, we'll get you in at 500 million, or flip those numbers, hey, raising it 100 million, we'll give you a discount at 50 million. And basically they raise from 50 to 100 angels, and it kind of gets the angels on their side and they give them a discount because maybe the angels are more helpful than the VC's. And then when they launch, they can say when they do their token generation event, all the angels that they wanted to get, who are maybe influential, are on their side. Then the token launches, and it's this mad dash for an airdrop. And it's like what happened with starkware and what happened with dimension? And it's a total shit show every single time for one reason or another. And the argument that I want to make here is that this system is actually a much worse system than icos. And icos weren't actually a bad system.
00:31:30.246 - 00:31:50.944, Speaker B: It was just that the industry was so immature. There were no nfts, there was no defi, there was like no infrastructure built out that the reason icos didn't work is not because of the structure, but because of regulatory fear and subpar founders and subpar companies. And I'd love to hear. So that's my, that's my argument to you, and I'd love to hear what you think of it.
00:31:54.444 - 00:32:25.944, Speaker A: Yeah. This sort of train of thought is very similar to what Kane has been very vocal about. Kane, the founder of synthetics, they actually raised one of the largest icos. It was probably the ICO that was an investor in there. And the question is, he was like, we should go back to icos. I think it's a very interesting train of thought. You also have people like Kobe trying to disintermediate this whole venture, PayPal mafia, if you will.
00:32:25.944 - 00:33:18.264, Speaker A: Icos are very. The purest form of a capital market where you have direct access to people. The arguments around not allowing that is that people are not very sophisticated. No, that's like accreditation rules that are outdated and antiquated, where they're actually based. So accreditation rules are actually set for administrative and cost burden reasons, not so much sophistication. Do you realize this, like, this whole threshold of like are you making over 100 or 150k or whatever it is, or join 200? It's more so based on like back in the day, it like every time you had a new shareholder, like it required, like it was expensive to add an incremental investor. Now it's like zero, right? Smart cost of zero with technology.
00:33:18.264 - 00:34:41.764, Speaker A: I think there was a middle ground where you go back to an ICO and you have, which by the way, a lot of. I guess the question is as long as icos and as long as in whatever mechanism, I'd say it doesn't matter if it's an ICO venture round, as long as there are the proper disclosures, the proper information propagated to the same people, like the same information propagated to everyone. I think that's, you know, and some sort of standard of what is disclosed, right. I think that's the most important thing that people need to be aware of and, but yeah, I mean, era is something that is very interesting actually to like is a venture investor more or less sophisticated than a community member? Probably the community member knows more about the project than the partner at whatever name and like allow them to. And in private conversations with a lot of founders, they've been wanting to do this, they've been wanting to go direct to the community and because of course they get criticism. It's like, why are you doing a venture round? Like we're here in the discord, we're here adding value, we're here like contributing and we can't invest. And it is a very valid argument.
00:34:41.764 - 00:35:30.494, Speaker A: And unfortunately it's been the regulatory risk or concern. And so the fundamental question is who's getting hurt? I think the current model, a lot of the retailers not participating in the value creation, by the way, in the same way that they're not participating in traditional venture, right. Which is a shame. So I don't disagree with you. I would want to go back to that system because it brings more competition, right. It levels the bar to maybe also get rid of airdrops altogether. Like, I think airdrops are peaked in terms of the percentage that is being given to the community.
00:35:30.494 - 00:35:44.628, Speaker A: If you go to a system where it's a pure ICO, you allow people to participate and have skin in the game and that's it. Like it's a, it's a more competitive environment and that's a really good thing, I think.
00:35:44.796 - 00:36:02.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, air. So airdrops are in. So icos are better. Better in two reasons. One is they, they were better incentive alignment mechanism than airdrops. Airdrops are incentivizing the wrong people. Airdrops are incentivizing renters, not owners.
00:36:02.220 - 00:36:25.650, Speaker B: And icos incentivize to owners people who actually want like a stake in that business. And I think basically they also fixed this. I don't know. We're back in the web. Two era of venture firms make the money and then the community doesn't make the money. It's no different than ipos. You can make obviously, money in the public markets.
00:36:25.650 - 00:36:47.380, Speaker B: But I don't know. I think that was one of the cool premises of icos, is that anyone could get in at an early level. And right now Starcore at 17 billion eigen layer, what do you think? Eigen layer launches that. I'd say 25 billion minimum. Probably. Probably 25, maybe 30 billion. Man, it's going to be tough for people to make money on that.
00:36:47.380 - 00:37:14.374, Speaker B: And it would have been cool if there was an Eigen layer ICO that people who are into staking and restaking stuff could have got in. Now there needs to be things. There needs to be, I would say mandatory disclosures. There needs to be. There needs to be something. But I don't know. This, this I, this, this market structure of like VC's forcing private deals with discounts and lockups like add us.
00:37:15.594 - 00:37:17.654, Speaker A: VC's are not forcing that.
00:37:18.674 - 00:37:19.814, Speaker B: No one's forcing.
00:37:20.394 - 00:38:18.614, Speaker A: Market regulatory environment is forcing it. Because there have been investors, well, not so much investors. There have been teams and founders that have been wanting to go back to this model, but they won't like, it's just very challenged now. I think there's always going to be a opportunity to create a gated ICO. One interesting mechanism would be with proof of on chain activity and measure of contribution, you invite people like think of lido to or eigen layer with restaking. Based on your amount of restaking, you have a certain allocation and maybe you can get that as an NFT that allocation. You can maybe trade that NFT to someone else at a premium or a discount if you don't want that allocation, or you can't fill that allocation and that naturally creates a secondary market all on chain.
00:38:18.614 - 00:38:40.194, Speaker A: The problem, of course, is, well, in order to get that state, there's still a need, I think, for private capital or funding of a white paper, so to speak. And that was an ICO. Your point initially around like scams exists. I mean, it's important to like, I think dissect, okay, like scams exist everywhere. It's not that ICOS promote scams.
00:38:42.414 - 00:38:43.158, Speaker B: Like.
00:38:43.326 - 00:39:17.364, Speaker A: Scams will happen whether it's an ICO or it's a venture route. Like, there's still scams. The ICO mechanism in and of itself does not, I think, promote a scam. I think, if anything, it creates a more visible environment where the issue is there can be some fomo, because you saw a lot of that fomo during the ICO boom and in the spur of the moment, it's no different than farming or maybe we're going to have this year restaking, chasing of yield. We're really caught up. But that happens in every market. That's just human psychology.
00:39:17.364 - 00:39:41.164, Speaker A: In this environment where the markets open 24 7365, you know, you see it more visibly. But to say that icos will, like, attract, like, you know, are these facilitators of, like, crappy teams raising money? Like, yeah, like, obviously it happens, but it's not the mechanism. I think, you know.
00:39:42.904 - 00:39:43.352, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:39:43.368 - 00:40:27.134, Speaker A: Like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be dismissive of an ICO for that particular reason, is what I'm trying to say, because I think those, there will always be those type of opportunist founders, scams, whatever. It's just the nature of the game. It happens in crypto, it happens in other industries, too. Right? So, yeah, I just want to point that out because I think that's probably one of the biggest criticisms of icos that I keep hearing on and on and on. And it's like, I don't think that's enough to go back to a model like, where it's a bit more. Where it is more egalitarian, where it is more like perhaps meritocratic based on contributions value made on chain. And it's really the same mechanism that teams are, are going about to design an airdrop campaign.
00:40:27.134 - 00:40:30.734, Speaker A: You can use those same parameters for an ICO.
00:40:31.154 - 00:40:51.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess the count. I guess one of the reasons they probably won't come back is there's this. Have you ever looked at the startup fundraising platforms like start engine or crowdfund? Like, you know, I guess Kickstarter, you could call it this, like we funder, GoFundme fund.
00:40:51.334 - 00:40:53.350, Speaker A: You talk about an adverse selection problem.
00:40:53.542 - 00:41:23.470, Speaker B: Adverse selection, exactly. It's like the number one best founders are going to go to Parafi and framework and ten t and folks like that and Polychain and the tier ones second best, like the folks who aren't able to make it are going to go to the second class and the third phase are going to go to the ICO platform. Is it really, I mean, like when I see a company on seed invest or Republic or GoFundMe, like, what that tells me is you tried to raise money and you got turned away.
00:41:23.542 - 00:41:24.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:24.422 - 00:41:30.326, Speaker B: And now you're like, well, shit, I still need to raise money. So let me go, like, try to do a community fundraise.
00:41:30.510 - 00:41:40.320, Speaker A: Yeah. It's never the instance. Yeah, no, I agree. There are some instances where, like, you might do both. Right. It's not a or b. It can be.
00:41:40.320 - 00:41:54.044, Speaker A: There is going to be this round. It's led by named Fund, and you reserve an allocation that is an open mechanism where community members can bid on whatever curve or can just bid on the allocation.
00:41:54.824 - 00:42:17.492, Speaker B: I think that. Okay, so you know who did this was actually Kraken. Do you remember in 2019, Kraken did a crowd fund, they raised 13. So Crackland was raising at a $4 billion valuation. They raised 13 million. I actually think they did the crowdfund to put a price on their equity, but they raised 13 million from 2000 investors. And they used some crowdfunding platform.
00:42:17.492 - 00:42:18.908, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know who they used.
00:42:18.956 - 00:42:25.384, Speaker A: But, yeah, if you're a consumer business, this is also a good mechanism from a go to market perspective.
00:42:27.444 - 00:43:31.234, Speaker B: Everyone wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santia and I, and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best, like uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the empire listener? This opens up a huge number, number of multi chain use cases across defi, nfts, governance, oracles and more, by supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including Sui Solana, different ETH, L two s theorem, and a whole bunch more. That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it. Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time.
00:43:31.234 - 00:43:50.720, Speaker B: Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion. And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for empire listeners. Hit the link in the description to claim you're unique, wormhole.
00:43:50.720 - 00:44:21.930, Speaker B: NFT. Today, the days of not using crypto for really anything in the real world are over. It is time to start using crypto in everyday transactions, whether that's shopping online or just buying a bagel on the street. We're excited to tell you about Py USD PayPal's entrance into web3. PayPal is proud to share an open letter to the crypto community that outlines their commitment, their roadmap, and their goals in the digital currency space. PyuSD seeks to transform how you interact with your digital assets. Available today.
00:44:21.930 - 00:44:53.544, Speaker B: You can send your crypto to your PayPal account, swap it for PyUSD, and then use it to check out at millions of stores. PayPal invites you, all the empire listeners, to be a part of this journey. Hit the link in the description of today's episode to read PayPal's open letter to the community. It gives you a really good sense of what their vision is. Take the next step by signing up for a PayPal account. Today, the future of crypto payments starts with PayPal. Shall we talk restaking? Do you have thoughts on this?
00:44:56.084 - 00:45:02.820, Speaker A: I've been giving way too many thoughts here. I'd like to hear your thoughts on it first. Yeah, yeah.
00:45:02.852 - 00:45:29.244, Speaker B: I mean, so basically, I'll read this tweet from, from Berniske. He said, he said, while we're still relatively early in the cycle, sneaky leverage always finds a new form. Oh, there you go. He says, in 2017, it was icos. In 2021, it was the lending desks. In 2025, it will probably be rampant restaking. So this sparked a whole conversation on Twitter.
00:45:29.244 - 00:46:04.490, Speaker B: My answer to this is, it depends how you define leverage. So in my mind, the obvious answer is, yes, this is leverage. But there's basically many, many types of leverage. There's like operational leverage, and then there's financial leverage. Right? There's like the financial leverage would be borrowing a bunch of assets in order to borrowing a bunch of assets to then go long. That's like going levered long, basically. Um, and so there's like two.
00:46:04.490 - 00:46:26.014, Speaker B: Two degrees of leverage. I would, I would say, have to enter the conversation. It's like operational leverage and financial leverage. Then it's like the degree of leverage that you're taking, right? So if you. Or here's, here's a question for you. If you stake your ETH, right, as a reminder to folks, staking is you take your ETH, you deposit into the staking contract. Restaking is you take that staked ETH, and you deposit into a restaking contract.
00:46:26.014 - 00:46:28.574, Speaker B: Do you think that staking is leverage?
00:46:30.494 - 00:46:33.554, Speaker A: No, not in of itself.
00:46:34.774 - 00:46:36.434, Speaker B: Interesting. Why not?
00:46:37.774 - 00:46:51.974, Speaker A: Just the mechanism of staking does not introduce more leverage. What you do with a staked asset may introduce more leverage, but in and of itself, staking does not introduce more leverage. Right.
00:46:52.054 - 00:47:15.466, Speaker B: I think, yeah. So this was. Okay, so I, like, read all these replies to Berniske. This is why people weren't agreeing on Twitter is because there's a different understanding of leverage. There's folks who think that depositing into a uniswap LP pool is leverage. There's folks that think staking, depositing your assets into a staking contract is leverage because you're doing something and you're getting more out with your money, basically. And people call that leverage.
00:47:15.466 - 00:47:39.908, Speaker B: I don't. I think I would call that operational leverage. I don't think it's financial leverage. I think that financial leverage is basically like. And the difference here is anything being borrowed, you're putting in one ETH, you're getting back one ETH, and a little bit of yield on top. Nothing's really getting borrowed in financial leverage. You're putting down something and you're getting more back in return, and something's actually getting borrowed.
00:47:39.908 - 00:47:48.812, Speaker B: So I think, to your point, restaking is basically, it's a new instrument, like a new financial.
00:47:48.868 - 00:47:50.480, Speaker A: It is a facilitator, for sure.
00:47:50.512 - 00:47:58.960, Speaker B: It's a facilitator of creating leverage. It's a new derivative that can kind of, or instrument that can then create leverage. That would be my definition of it.
00:47:59.112 - 00:48:10.360, Speaker A: Yes, I agree. It's a. There's a good faq from the Eigen layer team. They put it out, I believe, two, three weeks ago. People should go read that. And I. They go sort of.
00:48:10.360 - 00:49:02.254, Speaker A: They make this point, which is eigen layer in of itself does not create their opinion. More leverage, more risk in the system. It is. But they do concede that it's these liquid restaking tokens. And what happens at that layer is what may be a challenge, may present these risks. And in some ways, I think that is true. But also it begs the question, like, should you be trying to use the right word here? Should you have an opinion or a policy or risk framework in place to mitigate what the liquid restaking token does or does not do? And I'm not sure.
00:49:02.254 - 00:49:06.010, Speaker A: I guess we could maybe discuss that, right?
00:49:06.202 - 00:49:13.994, Speaker B: I don't. Yeah, you're saying different parameters to limit what, what the, what the restake token can actually do.
00:49:14.734 - 00:49:18.526, Speaker A: Well, not so much what it can or can't do. It's more the amount.
00:49:18.590 - 00:49:18.790, Speaker B: Right?
00:49:18.822 - 00:49:56.308, Speaker A: Like, if you're Eigen layer and you see the liquid restaking protocol come, and I'm just. I'm trying to think of, like, is there. Is there a framework in place that you can implement that? The, like, if you're Eigen layer, they have this kind of security council, right, of containing the amount of, like, restaking. On restaking. On restaking. Can you clamp down on that? Can you, like. I mean, I guess I'm getting ahead of myself here.
00:49:56.308 - 00:50:01.484, Speaker A: Is, like, what is the worst that can happen with liquid restaking?
00:50:03.504 - 00:50:33.530, Speaker B: The worst that could happen is there's probably basically, like, a big slash, I think, is that there's a big slashing event. Right? Like, I think mechanically, staking and restaking are the same thing, but you now have multiple. You've now basically increased the number of claims on the. On the same asset. So therefore, you've increased the number of, like, slashing conditions and slashing risks on the same asset. And I think that's why people would say, look, maybe it's not leverage, but it's increasing risk in one way or another. You know? It's not.
00:50:33.530 - 00:50:42.090, Speaker B: It's not like you're taking out, like, a margin loan or something, but it's increasing some sort of risk in the system. Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:50:42.162 - 00:51:40.126, Speaker A: I'm going to be cautious here, because I am getting ahead of my skis. Like, I would like to have this discussion with someone at eigen layer or someone, and we should. We should bring. Maybe someone from eigen layer could be Calvin and someone from the liquid restaking token protocols to come in and discuss this point on leverage is a good one. I think that's less contentious. What is more contentious is, what is the point of all these liquid restaking tokens? And at what point do you stop? At what point you just assume that people are going to want to chase the highest yielding opportunities? At what point do we, do we make sure that, to use this Chris word, sneaky, at what point do we make sure that leverage does not creep up on the system to a degree where it can have a systemic risk on protocols or ecosystems?
00:51:40.310 - 00:51:45.830, Speaker B: Yeah, we've pushed the boundary of, I think, our. Or at least. At least of my.
00:51:45.902 - 00:52:04.914, Speaker A: Basically, like, I have some opinions, but they're not really relevant here. I would like them more just have a discussion. Like, a pod, in my mind, would involve the top three liquid restaking protocols and someone from Eigen layer discussing this point. Exactly, because I think we had it in our predictions that if anything like Ethereum.
00:52:05.534 - 00:52:06.782, Speaker B: Well, you remember when we had the.
00:52:06.798 - 00:52:31.252, Speaker A: Eigen layer team on, they said initially they're going to have the security council that is going to really make sure that the system is operating correctly. And these valid, I think they call it the Security Council that is very like human centric governed and has an opinion on like, the security frameworks of the system. Right. Do you remember that?
00:52:31.388 - 00:52:32.544, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:52:33.404 - 00:53:29.774, Speaker A: And my criticism back then, I think I still hold this view is that, like, I guess you have to have that, but over time, like, like, it doesn't give me much confidence. So, like, the whole point of these systems, I think, is to be like, as governance light as possible. Like Ethereum as an l one does not have any government. You know what I mean? It doesn't have any governance. I think coordinating from a shift to proof of stake was a herculean effort and that required a whole bunch of coordination. But it's a very governance light. L two s introduce more governance in the equation and then protocols on top of that, like DeFi protocols and whatnot, are like, you know, have these governance tokens, but as a base protocol, I think you don't, like, you want to really, really minimize the amount of governance, human like interference or interactions that happen and have a say, because I think that just degrades the trust guarantees.
00:53:29.774 - 00:54:12.704, Speaker A: And I think also humans are like, time and time again, like, not really competent to make these decisions. So my criticism was, I think Ethereum probably figures out some sort of scalability Roma. It is figuring it out live, like through modularity and, you know, parallelization some like Monad and all this, you know, stuff like Celestia and whatnot. But it is adding more. Like it is giving up that this, on this particular thing that I think is pretty sacrosanct, which is government like governance light. And whereas you don't have that, like in, in other ecosystems, like. Like Solana, for instance, like you want it.
00:54:12.704 - 00:54:16.028, Speaker A: And so, yeah, it's just.
00:54:16.156 - 00:54:17.204, Speaker B: Is it going to work?
00:54:17.324 - 00:54:43.024, Speaker A: Is it like a catastrophic thing? No, but it just introduces a vector that I think should be talked about more. And ultimately it might be necessary, might. It's okay. But I personally prefer systems that have as least amount of like, human judgment in there because it just makes me uneasy. You know what I mean?
00:54:43.604 - 00:54:45.624, Speaker B: I do, I do. Just.
00:54:46.244 - 00:54:59.364, Speaker A: But yeah, anyways, that was my rant on, like, ethereum security, like scalability roadmap, but yeah, on this, like with restaking stuff, I think she'd have a dedicated pod to talk about this.
00:54:59.484 - 00:55:07.664, Speaker B: Yeah, our last conversation here you joined Farcaster. You're one weekend. What do you, what do you think? Good in the bad forecaster?
00:55:08.684 - 00:55:31.984, Speaker A: Good stuff. Good stuff. To Dan. I got to say, I talked to Dan three years ago or so, and he was building this, and I've had immense respect for Dan from the sidelines because I know how early he was. He was early in Coinbase. I think he's a very deep, thoughtful thinker. And to see someone, like, take time to really make a decision of where to build, I think that carries a lot of weight and has a lot of gravity.
00:55:31.984 - 00:55:51.722, Speaker A: It's a seamless platform. Starting from the very beginning. I ping you, hey, how do I set this up? You send me a link. I went through it. I set it up seamless. It was web two experience. There was some things about security and whatever you can, but it was very much seamless.
00:55:51.722 - 00:56:10.454, Speaker A: Onboarding. Charge you $5, which is perfect. How much does Twitter charge you for verification? Like, similar, right? So it was like, whatever. Very easy onboarding. So points there. Here's where I don't. Things that I didn't like, and I'll go back to the things I like, but I'm going through sequentially the flow.
00:56:10.454 - 00:56:41.834, Speaker A: What I didn't like was, like, it asked me for interest, and it was like ten buckets. So I clicked some, you know, crypto, books, travel, whatever, and then I didn't realize this, but so I joined. And then I see the Empire channel. That was my first tweet. And then two things. One, I didn't like that I, based on my interest, which is pretty cookie cutter list, I immediately followed, like, 70 people or 50 people. I'm like, no, make it optional.
00:56:41.834 - 00:57:08.572, Speaker A: Why is it that, like, now it's the awkwardness of unfollowing people? Like, I don't want to. Why are you determining who I should or shouldn't follow? Maybe give me a glimpse into the type of content that I'm going to be able to see. Right, right. When I click into it. Maybe just show me now the channel, also show me how this goddamn thing works. Like, give me a guide of how it should be casting. Turns out that, like, you know, it is kind of intuitive, but, like, it would be nice to just, like, have a.
00:57:08.572 - 00:57:21.626, Speaker A: Here's how it works. Here's the kind of things that you can do here. Here's how it's different from x. Here's how it's very similar to X. Like, here's the type of users. Like, just give me something, right? It was just like, all right, like, all of a sudden, I follow 100 people. What?
00:57:21.740 - 00:57:22.214, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:57:22.254 - 00:57:43.486, Speaker A: Like, I actually don't want to follow. These people have, like, I unfollowed, like, 80% of them. I'm like, I want to consciously follow people here. So that was a bit, like, I tweeted this today. I casted this today, and publicly I was like, this change. So am I using the app constantly? No, not yet. Am I cross tweeting? Like, tweeting and casting the same thing.
00:57:43.486 - 00:58:13.684, Speaker A: I'm running experiments of, like, where I do the same tweet and cast to see the type of engagement. Engagement is nowhere near. Right. And I guess the word engagement is tricky, right? Because I'm just judging by, like, number of likes, which, of course is like, you know, I have just shy of a thousand followers on forecaster. I have, you know, 100 x that in on x. So I guess the ratio is pretty high, I'd say. But still, I don't know.
00:58:13.684 - 00:58:26.452, Speaker A: I'm still kind of working through it. It to, if be honest, I still don't know what casts are or how to do them or use them. Casts, you just send a tweet? No, no, not cast, but, like, the frames, right?
00:58:26.508 - 00:58:28.196, Speaker B: Frames, yeah, yeah.
00:58:28.300 - 00:58:44.494, Speaker A: The casts are easy. Like, it's, it's, I'll say, like, it's super easy to just the cast, right. Like the symbol that you tweet, it's, like, super intuitive. I guess you can select the channel. The question is, if I select the empire channel, is that can also go on, like, other, I guess. No, right. Like, if you're not in the Empire Channel, you're, you may or may not see it.
00:58:44.494 - 00:58:44.958, Speaker A: Probably not.
00:58:45.006 - 00:59:06.046, Speaker B: You will still see it. You will still see it. I think the Farcaster team is thinking about something where, like, you could tweet out or you could cast in a channel and no one else would see it. Or you can cast in a channel and everyone else sees it. But right now, when you, like, tag the Channel empire. So, by the way, if people don't know there's a on warp cast, there's a channel for empire. There's like 250 people in it, all listeners of the pod.
00:59:06.046 - 00:59:08.514, Speaker B: And people hang out and ask questions and talk about the podcast.
00:59:09.434 - 00:59:10.122, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:10.258 - 00:59:11.814, Speaker B: So good talk.
00:59:12.954 - 00:59:14.898, Speaker A: No, we're definitely not the largest channel.
00:59:14.986 - 00:59:17.054, Speaker B: We're the biggest channel on all of warpcast.
00:59:17.754 - 00:59:23.450, Speaker A: We're not the number one. No, I mean, seriously, as much as I want to believe that, like, no.
00:59:23.522 - 00:59:27.586, Speaker B: We have 200, not yet. And base has 100,000 people.
00:59:27.650 - 00:59:31.314, Speaker A: So actually, that's pretty impressive, actually, base is 100,000.
00:59:31.474 - 01:00:02.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I had a cool, I had a cool warpcast moment, far caster moment this week. So it was actually the best off chain, excuse me, best on chain to off chain experience I ever have, have ever had. And it was inside of a frame. And I think anyone who wants a peek into the future of consumer and the future of consumer crypto should literally go do this right now. So I was scrolling on warpcast and I see a mint a penny frame from this guy Garrett, who works at Coindesk. Actually a great guy. And he's been like basically pump like.
01:00:02.124 - 01:00:15.044, Speaker B: He's been like sharing all the best frames that he can see. He's a good follow on Warpcast. So basically scrolling. I see Garrett share this frame. It says mint a penny. And the flow basically went like this. So you click mint a penny inside of your frame.
01:00:15.044 - 01:00:36.738, Speaker B: It's just a big picture of a penny. Click mint a penny. The frame. So then I minted that Nft of the penny. The frame then automatically transitioned to say get a hat because it recognized that I had this NFt in my wallet. So anyone who didn't have the NFT in their wallet, it says, get a penny. Anyone who has the NFT, that frame now says get a hat.
01:00:36.738 - 01:01:06.688, Speaker B: So then I click get a hat. It then opens up a coinbase shopping page with a picture of a $30, like really nice, like high quality $30 hat. And then the page automatically read that the get a penny NFT was in my wallet. So the $30 hat on this like normal page, not turned into a dollar, into a $0.01 hat. And then, so then I clicked, I click checkout. And then it was one click checkout with shopify and it was done.
01:01:06.688 - 01:01:21.840, Speaker B: And this was all on mobile, all in like 30 to 60 seconds. Click mint a penny frame turns into get a hat. Click get a hat, opens up a coinbase page. $30 hat becomes a $0.01 page. One click checkout with Shopify hats. Gonna be at my house in a couple days.
01:01:21.840 - 01:01:22.376, Speaker B: Get away.
01:01:22.400 - 01:01:22.964, Speaker A: That.
01:01:23.704 - 01:01:25.696, Speaker B: I wear that. I'll wear that. Yeah.
01:01:25.840 - 01:01:27.804, Speaker A: With hat, with hat.
01:01:27.944 - 01:01:30.464, Speaker B: I am now with hat, with hat.
01:01:31.964 - 01:01:46.836, Speaker A: That's pretty interesting. That's really, I mean, yeah, this is a really good observation. Like people that are on the sidelines thinking that it is crypto, still very cumbersome challenge ux. It is. They're in for a surprise. Yeah, a real surprise. Like, it is seamless.
01:01:46.836 - 01:02:27.234, Speaker A: I've always felt that payments descriptions with stable coins is the way the future, like NFTS subscriptions like, I'll leave you with this. The amount of dropout, the amount of, like, lost revenue from e commerce is astounding because credit cards fail. Or, like, subscription renewals is a huge problem for not just retail, but enterprise software companies. Like, because the credit card expired, the payment had a false negative, all these crazy, stupid things that should have been figured out by now. Guess what? You don't have that problem with crypto and you can make micro payments. Like, it's just streaming payments. Savlier is a really good protocol.
01:02:27.234 - 01:02:49.314, Speaker A: Like, it's just. Yeah, like, we're, you're right. It does. This type of flow is something that perhaps we should really encourage people to use more and more to showcase to normal people in their day to day interactions of what is possible with crypto. Right? Like, like, it would be nice to see a video of, like, here's how you check out in normal web two. Here's how we check out crypto. Who's faster?
01:02:49.614 - 01:03:25.704, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So we have a monthly all hands with blockworks that Mike and I lead. And I think we have like 60 people at the company, maybe 65 now at blockworks. And we just have everyone get on once a month. We share, like, basically, how did the last month go? What's happened? What are the goals for the next month? And, like, what are the big initiatives at the company? And, like, what do we think? And then there's like a ama section and stuff like that. And we had, we did a whole section on forecaster, and we basically said, like, look, as a, as a company, it's not just Mike and I, like, as a company, we're pushing into farcaster, and we've got like a farcaster channel now.
01:03:25.704 - 01:03:50.930, Speaker B: And people are, we're like, we're pushing on it. So, yeah, I think anytime you do something like this, it's a, you will never be successful with a new thing if you just half asset. So, like, my idea around forecasters, like, let's go all in for 90 days and let's wake up maybe four and a half months, and we'll wake up at the end of June, at the end of Q two and basically say, do we keep going or do we stop? Was it worth it or not worth it?
01:03:51.002 - 01:04:02.442, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think it has a, those type of bets are really interesting from when founders do that because it could have a pretty asymmetric payoff and the downside, fairly limited. I mean, like, this was the other idea.
01:04:02.498 - 01:04:27.084, Speaker B: Like, if you, we have yet to actually get on TikTok as a business. We have like a couple videos because the. And we should probably be on TikTok. But to go create like TikToks and channel, like, you can't just repost somewhere. Like it literally takes a different type of person to go build a TikTok. But Warpcast is really easy to just like we can take. The team runs on Twitter and now that Twitter team, it's very easy for them to get up on.
01:04:27.464 - 01:04:29.440, Speaker A: Its called cross indication of channels.
01:04:29.512 - 01:04:30.328, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:04:30.416 - 01:04:49.534, Speaker A: So nice. Good man. Well, something to obviously report back on and keep tracking. But yeah, really shout out to Dan. I mean, he's really good stuff, what he's built, and we need more of those. We need more consumer applications. And I think we're entering that phase.
01:04:49.534 - 01:05:35.148, Speaker A: I think that is the most exciting way. Going back to circling this podcast is really about this discussion around, like, who fucking cares if who's right around a couple of weeks if we're in a bull or bear market again, the real fundamental question is, do you believe this is a lasting technology? And if you do, you kind of invert, then does your timing matter? No, because you're never going to get it right because humans can't predict this stuff and markets are completely irrational at it, and so you can't do it. To think that you can is just a fool's error. You're going to be right today. Chris is going to be wrong, quote unquote, today. He may be right. You know, in a month from now, who cares, right? Like, at the end of the day, more focus should be on paying attention to what is really happening on the ground level.
01:05:35.148 - 01:06:47.680, Speaker A: You're trying out fast forecaster. Like, compare that to your experience in 2017 when you're funding that ICO crypt is not perfect, but, like, do you see a window towards this completely, like, completely changing the fabric of e commerce and subscriptions and customer acquisitions and retention and what? Like, yeah, I do like stable coins. Have you used it? Not just like pontificate, have you actually used stable coins? Like, okay, like, have you tried phantom? Have you tried Jupiter? Have you, like, looked at an NFT and what people really like? You know, I get like, that maybe gaming is a little bit more like bare bones still, but, like, every different kind of vertical is in different places, but in the aggregate, like, that's what I care most about, right? Because that's how I think of my allocations in verticals is like, I do. I cannot afford to miss out on a huge vertical. And social is one where I've, like, probably kind of been a little bit wary of, like, I obviously have an investment in lens. I'm not an investor in forecaster. But, you know, seeing this type of stuff is really encouraging, actually.
01:06:47.680 - 01:07:08.862, Speaker A: Yeah. The question is, are they gonna, like, are they, will they be able to scale? But it's also really kind of crazy, right? Like, you look at these, like, examples that are made, like, Harvard Business school case studies, vitamin water, coconut water, all this crap. It literally was like Rihanna and 50 cent got behind this crap and like, it.
01:07:08.918 - 01:07:10.486, Speaker B: Yeah, 50. Let's go.
01:07:10.550 - 01:07:49.696, Speaker A: You know, like, 50 cent would have been going bankrupt that he not done this deal. And then Rihanna's a billionaire because she, like, got, like, a huge equity stake in coconut water or something like this. Yeah, it's. The thing is, what is really encouraging is the creator economy, to use a cliche, kind of overused vc term at this point, is very real. Tick tock. These phenomenons, like, the individual power of not just celebrities, but genuine people that are content creators is huge. What is probably missing is how these creators monetize.
01:07:49.696 - 01:08:32.124, Speaker A: And I think crypto is that place where more and more creators are going to naturally gravitate to through nfts, through whatnot. And because it is just a better system, I think you're still going to have platforms, you're still going to have TikTok, of course, that are more centralized and whatnot. But when you compare, the economic argument for a creator is going to probably be stronger, joining a web3 protocol that distributes a far greater share. So I guess my last question for you is, when will we see most of forecaster users which has gone parabolic? I think. Didn't it cross, like, over 100,000 or so?
01:08:32.464 - 01:08:35.456, Speaker B: Well, there's 100,000 followers of just the base channel.
01:08:35.520 - 01:08:39.225, Speaker A: Yeah. But I think it's over 100,000. Mostly crypto native.
01:08:39.369 - 01:08:39.881, Speaker B: Mostly.
01:08:39.937 - 01:09:01.697, Speaker A: Mostly historically ethereum centric. But when do you think we're going to see, like, major mainstream. I don't want to say like a Taylor Swift, but, like, you know, like a mister beast or whatever on Farcaster this cycle? Yeah. Is that going to be a bullish or is that going to be the top?
01:09:01.785 - 01:09:26.270, Speaker B: It'll be in the. It'll mark. It'll mark the top or something. And then, like, yeah, I think at some point in 2025, like, I think dozens if. I think many, many, many celebrities end up getting on far Caster in maybe ten to 20% chance, second half or end of 2024, but definitely in 2025. I mean, I don't know what you're like. It also depends on how you think about the cycle?
01:09:26.302 - 01:09:28.154, Speaker A: Imagine if Trump goes on forecaster.
01:09:29.094 - 01:09:29.662, Speaker B: I wouldn't.
01:09:29.718 - 01:09:38.884, Speaker A: I mean, like, something like, if I'm Dan, I would be, like, focused on, like, capturing this election. Like, if you have, like, because obviously Trump got banned from Twitter.
01:09:39.944 - 01:10:12.026, Speaker B: I mean, I think that will happen in this cycle. Like, I think you'll be listening. Like, I don't know if you ever listen to the Lex Friedman podcast. Like, I think crypto people will end up getting on as crypto gets intertwined and bitcoin gets intertwined with, like, more and more of society and, like, the market ends up ripping and bull market and stuff like that. Like, those celebrities will get on Farcaster, like, crypto. Crypto celebrities, like the big founders and investors will get on Lex Friedman and get on 60 minutes and we'll get called to talk in front of Congress and things. Like, it'll, it all just get intertwined.
01:10:12.026 - 01:10:12.506, Speaker B: So.
01:10:12.610 - 01:10:24.974, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Well, we'll see. I'm going to continue to use it. So thank you for this activation energy that is so necessary. So you, I will always credit you for onboarding me to forecaster.
01:10:26.534 - 01:10:27.670, Speaker B: Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
01:10:27.702 - 01:10:36.782, Speaker A: Is there an NFT that, like, can track who on boards think you're with your ref link you can trace, right? They know that you, I think you.
01:10:36.798 - 01:10:39.486, Speaker B: Can trace who has signed you sent.
01:10:39.510 - 01:10:41.310, Speaker A: Me a link and it had a unique URL to it.
01:10:41.342 - 01:10:41.822, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:10:41.838 - 01:10:54.732, Speaker A: I think you can trace by default. Yeah, yeah. Nice. Good stuff. We haven't done this in a while. Any content, movies, books that you're listening to found interesting lately.
01:10:54.868 - 01:10:59.904, Speaker B: I have not opened a book in three weeks, and that's how I know that bull market.
01:11:00.364 - 01:11:01.324, Speaker A: It's exactly right.
01:11:01.364 - 01:11:24.716, Speaker B: I was gonna say that it's crazy. Like, I, you know, the podcast in the bear market that I was listening to, like, I started listening to, like, non crypto podcasts a little more in the bear market just by the end of the bear. Like, I just like audiobooks I was reading a little more. Like, I was listening to, like, just, I don't know, back listening, like, invest, like the best or all in, or my first million or like, these other podcasts. Now I'm like, like your stories of.
01:11:24.740 - 01:11:31.300, Speaker A: People, how they almost went bankrupt, like you in crypto, then they come back and full raising force, like, and give you something. Yeah, we have. We've been there. Yeah, that's right.
01:11:31.372 - 01:11:35.884, Speaker B: So, yeah, exactly. I'm like, oh, my God. Like, he, he was almost bankrupt, too. Yeah.
01:11:35.924 - 01:11:44.260, Speaker A: I can make guys Elon Musk almost bankrupt tight. So, like, if you round trip, if you've round tripped your crypto gains, like, hold on, hold on.
01:11:44.452 - 01:11:56.954, Speaker B: So, but, like, dude, I wake up Wednesday morning and I'm like, let's fucking go. I get to listen to Xerox research podcast. Like, all right, Friday morning or, like, Saturday. Like, I get to listen to Bell Curve Tuesday. Like, new episode of Bell curve. Like, so I'm.
01:11:57.534 - 01:12:21.646, Speaker A: I think one of our first conversations that I had with you, and especially when I was looking at the investment, was like, you're right. Like, now I. You rotate from, hopefully you're listening to Empire and then you can go to lightspeed and then go to bell curve and then come back to empire. Like, it's a full week. And then we have the combo now with Ryan and Tommy. Like, I think our initial vision was, like, becoming your everything. If you want to.
01:12:21.750 - 01:12:44.062, Speaker B: Like, we want to own that. We want to own the stack. We want to own the entire information stack. For once. You are crypto native, basically. Like, we will let other people, the coin desks or coin telegraphs of the world, like, play with the onboard people into crypto, whatever. Our theory, though, is that, like, you only spend a little bit of time on that layer of the stack and eventually you get pulled into crypto or you leave.
01:12:44.062 - 01:13:01.056, Speaker B: And we care about the people who are, who are here to stay. We care. We care about the, as Ryan from bankless would say, like, the settlers. Like, we care about the crypto natives. And if you want news, we've got news for you. If you want a daily podcast or daily newsletter, we've got that for you. If you want more niche shows, more technical shows, we've got that for you.
01:13:01.056 - 01:13:25.500, Speaker B: If you want to come to conferences, we've got that for you. We're launching permissionless three in two weeks with only 50 plus speakers. We're excited about that. Yeah, we. And then we've got the research and data platform now where we're launching a full. Like, we literally rebuilt this thing based on customer feedback from the last, uh, 21 months. Uh, we've rebuilt the entire platform, uh, especially the front end.
01:13:25.500 - 01:13:30.624, Speaker B: And we're launching that at. In about a month. So. Yeah, like, we. We want to own the whole stack.
01:13:31.084 - 01:13:37.024, Speaker A: This was an ad without being an ad. We have not without being an ad.
01:13:38.484 - 01:13:43.534, Speaker B: All I could ask you is go buy a ticket to Das. Use code Empire ten.
01:13:44.994 - 01:13:47.466, Speaker A: I think there's an event for empire listeners and community.
01:13:47.530 - 01:13:48.970, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Thank you.

01:13:54.026 - 01:13:59.334, Speaker B: Dude, I literally forgot three times in a row. Uh, to bring this up, we have actually share the details.
01:14:00.434 - 01:14:21.442, Speaker A: Well, like, I'm cautiously going to share them because I'm still figuring out my travel. But there is an event, the conference starts Monday. The 18th, right? Or something? Yeah, 18th or the. Through the 21st or so. It's like Monday through Wednesday or Thursday. And there's a meet up on Sunday before the conference starts for Empire and Bell Curve.
01:14:21.458 - 01:14:22.330, Speaker B: Listen on the margin.

We had first bitcoin mining episode we've done in almost two years. It was. I would really recommend listening to this episode. We'd never talk about mining, but, like, very good overview of.
