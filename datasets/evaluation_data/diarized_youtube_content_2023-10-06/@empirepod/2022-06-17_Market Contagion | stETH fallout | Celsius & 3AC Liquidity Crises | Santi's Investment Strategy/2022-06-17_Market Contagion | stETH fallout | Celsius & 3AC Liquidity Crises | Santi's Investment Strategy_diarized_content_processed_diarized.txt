00:00:00.240 - 00:00:23.714, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by BitMex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. I think we will probably have a lot of newcomers to the show. First time listeners to Empire. I'm really excited that you guys are tuning in for this podcast. We are.
00:00:23.714 - 00:01:07.164, Speaker A: Today we have. This is kind of the structure that I'd like to go through today on this episode. We usually do these weekly roundup episodes where we kind of COVID the last week. We're going to zoom out and just cover the last couple of months in crypto, starting with boom one, how did we get here? Like, what the hell has just happened over the last couple of months? So we're going to start with, how did we get here? Next, we're going to give a little bit of an overview on, like Steeth stated, lido, because I think that's actually important to the conversation, uh, surrounding the next two topics, celsius and three arrows. After covering celsius and three arrows, we'll get into talking about contagion. Okay. The big question on everyone's mind is, like, what happens next? What are the different things to fall? Funds, companies, people, individuals.
00:01:07.164 - 00:01:25.888, Speaker A: What happens from here? That will tie us into the next big question of, have we seen rock bottom yet? Uh, which obviously ties into what everyone wants me to ask Santiago, are you buying yet? Santi, have you pulled the trigger? And then we can zoom back out to tie this conversation together. What will we see in the next few months? Santi, how's that sound to you?
00:01:26.056 - 00:01:28.284, Speaker B: Sounds great. Cool.
00:01:29.024 - 00:01:32.480, Speaker A: Have you listened to that Stanley Druckenmiller John Collison episode?
00:01:32.512 - 00:01:32.760, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:01:32.792 - 00:01:32.936, Speaker A: No?
00:01:32.960 - 00:01:33.704, Speaker B: Okay. Amazing.
00:01:33.824 - 00:01:46.432, Speaker A: You did. You did. Okay. So one of my favorite stories in there is Drucken Miller basically saying just his story of how he played the. Him and soros actually played the.com bubble. Right.
00:01:46.432 - 00:02:00.552, Speaker A: He was short when the market was longing. He went long when the market started to turn. He, like a daily. Right. He literally top ticked it, he said, by an hour. He basically made all the wrong calls. He made, like, back to back to back wrong calls.
00:02:00.552 - 00:02:21.136, Speaker A: Was down 18%, then went up like 40%, then went down 18%. And at that point, it was like, maybe March of 2020 or like 2020 or of 2000 or 2001. And he basically said, screw it. I'm done. I'm throwing in the towel. He goes to George Soros and he says, I'm walking away. He tells his investors, you can have your money back.
00:02:21.136 - 00:02:43.336, Speaker A: If you want it, you can pull your money out of the fund. And he goes to Africa for three months with his kids. And man, I'm excited that we got you back on this episode. This is your first episode in a couple of weeks, and you too are back from Africa. You have pulled a drucken Miller. You've had some time to think, you've had some time to decompress. So hopefully your thoughts are as insightful as Drucken Miller's.
00:02:43.336 - 00:02:44.386, Speaker A: You up for the challenge?
00:02:44.520 - 00:03:03.514, Speaker B: That's a tall order. I'm still in Africa, so maybe this will inspire me to be more like him. Which, by the way, zooming out as an investor, I really look to Soros and duck and Miller as kind of like, I ascribe to that kind of type of philosophy and frameworks more so than perhaps any other investor out there.
00:03:03.894 - 00:03:30.088, Speaker A: So how do we get here? The markets? Let's look at some of the data today. Santi. The University of Michigan Consumer sentiment index just cratered from 58 to 50, the lowest level ever since that data collection began in the 1970s. The Fed raised interest rates by 75 bps on Wednesday, the largest rate hike since 1994. CPI rose to a new high, up 8.6% year over year. The two year is at 3.27,
00:03:30.088 - 00:03:54.774, Speaker A: the highest it's been since 2000, 715 years. The Dow has been down ten of the last eleven weeks. This is the first time this has happened since the Great Depression. Uh, average gas prices in the US just crossed $5 for the first time ever. Gas is now up 63% on the year. I think that's record levels, uh, gas levels, um, in the United States, markets and crypto are in a free fall. ETH is near 1000.
00:03:54.774 - 00:04:05.954, Speaker A: Uh, bitcoin is near twenty k. The total crypto market cap is below 1 trillion. Again, crypto feels like it's in a free fall now below early 2021 prices. How did we get here, my friend?
00:04:06.634 - 00:04:36.510, Speaker B: Oh, that's a really interesting question. I mean, I think like a lot of investors, you would have asked, like at some point there was going to be a day of reckoning on. Like when you have seen central banks print money the way that they have and the market kind of react to that. You know, everything was up, everything was hitting all time highs. And, you know, you read just to point another type of investor that has kind of been like a canary in the coal mine. This is like Howard Marks from Oaktree. So super, really good investor, really good credit investor, and macro investor like Stan Druckenmiller.
00:04:36.510 - 00:05:23.734, Speaker B: And you look at his letters and over the last like 1015 years, he's been saying, like, this has to stop at some point. Ray Dalio, again, the market cycle, the challenge as an investor is it's not so much that you understand that market's going to come down and crash at some point and need a correct and reverse like, and revert to the mean. It's timing that and understanding when that's going to happen. I think broadly speaking, look, I'm not a macro guy, there's people that are much more sophisticated than I am. But I think certainly the war in Ukraine was a big catalyst to detonating what has been. You basically invade the bread basket of Europe and that's going to have a whole host of things, including energy prices have gone up through the roof, especially in Europe, because Russia controls a lot of the natural gas inflows into Europe. And Europe has been largely neglecting nuclear energy.
00:05:23.734 - 00:06:01.924, Speaker B: France supplies a lot of nuclear to other countries, but know, Germany has cut down nuclear over the last decade. And so, you know, obviously that contribute energy contributes a lot to CPI and food prices as well. Food prices are up over 30% year over year because, I mean, this year alone, because, you know, Ukraine and Russia supply 10% of the world's calories. Number one, fertilizer. I think that has been a big detonator. When people see that kind of inflation, then I think it kind of boxes central banks to do something. And when you rise rates, it sort of has this cascading effect.
00:06:01.924 - 00:06:35.456, Speaker B: Once you rise rates the way that you have, I think the central banks have been trying to catch up. They're reacting to this stuff as opposed to getting ahead of it. And then that's what has triggered a lot of this. When rates rise and people start this, anything that is risk on anything that is like stocks and farther onto the risk spectrum, including crypto, collapses pretty dramatically because your discount rate is much higher. And so naturally valuations fall. Yeah.
00:06:35.600 - 00:07:10.496, Speaker A: So the Fed is getting pretty intense here, right? They're raising rates, they're selling off assets from their balance sheet. Asset prices are crashing, inflation is not budging. There's an economic contraction in q one. It feels like the entire situation is a complete mess. I think a lot of folks like ogs and crypto knew it could get this bad, but nobody knew how quickly it could happen. And I think for me, I've just been really honestly surprised by how fast and how brutal this bear market has been, actually. And I'm kind of saying, why was I so surprised by this.
00:07:10.496 - 00:07:22.894, Speaker A: I feel like it's always like this, but I'd be curious to get your take. We knew we could have a bear market. We knew prices could fall 80, 90%. But this specifically feels really, really intense to me. I'm curious to get your take on that.
00:07:23.394 - 00:08:11.524, Speaker B: I mean, I've always told people the narrative around crypto has always been, it's an uncorrelated asset class. And I never believed that. I just thought that it's more of a technology bet than it is a hedge on macro. Looking back, I was reflecting, I said, well, yeah, sort of like, over the years, you've had crypto crashes, but it's always been under an environment where the Fed has printed a lot of money. You've been on quantitative easing, and so a lot risk assets. Inherently, you've done very well since the global financial crisis in QE started. And so, look, can bitcoin and specifically bitcoin and other hard assets be a hedge against inflation? And it is going to take decades for bitcoin ossify as like this non sovereign store of value.
00:08:11.524 - 00:09:00.084, Speaker B: I do believe that every cycle that we survive, it hardens that perhaps more, but it's not, we're not at that point yet. I mean, it took gold centuries for people to, like, ascribe some sort of value to that, to this scarce metal. There's more scarcer metals, a terrible semiconductor. You can't store it easily, you can't transport it easily. But cultures love gold, and it has become this social construct of value, but it took like centuries for that to happen. I think it is possible for bitcoin to get there, but it's tough to tell someone that this is going to be an uncorrelated asset class. I think you just assume this is a very high asymmetric bet on technology.
00:09:00.084 - 00:09:53.854, Speaker B: It can have a lot of interesting properties across, you know, the way that governments operate, the way that we coordinate as humans, the way that we organize as societies, businesses, but it's going to take time. Right? And like, you know, I feel like we need to be really patient here. I'm not, to be fair, like, I'm more calm now than I was in other cycles in 2018. And this is more personal for me because in 2018, like, I had a thesis, but it wasn't as solidified. And I was, like, reflecting on, like, how did I sort of miss, like, I guess the extent by which in which is you're saying that how do we get this far and this quickly? And I think it's just one thing, candidly and I'd be interested to get your perspective, which is like, it's just rising rates. Like, we've never, it's just new, right? And I haven't invested in a rising rate environment. And I tweeted about this, like, a month ago.
00:09:53.854 - 00:10:25.478, Speaker B: I said, now is sort of the time that a lot of us are going to understand how good of an investor we are. Because when, you know, we just never been in this paradigm. And just to reference one thing he said earlier, which I would encourage everyone to go watch that interview with Stan Buckmiller, is, he's like, I'm very humbled by the market. It's like a new, it's a new environment. It's really weird. And I think people are in this process of understanding how to play that. And if someone like Stan, I'll say this and I'll stop talking.
00:10:25.478 - 00:10:56.452, Speaker B: If someone like Stan Duncan out comes out and says, I don't know what to do, I'm kind of, like, on the, on the sidelines, which I think he was shorting the market. I think he's now on the sidelines. It's just, ie, cash or neutral. If someone like that, something like that is, is doing that, then you just sure as hell know that everyone else right now is bracing for impact and just wants to survive. And so when that happens, it's just an indiscriminate sell off across everything. You're like, I just want to be able to live to see another day.
00:10:56.588 - 00:11:12.200, Speaker A: Right. I mean, if someone like Druck Miller, who says, I think his specific point is that you can't, when you don't, historically, over the last 30 years, when he doesn't know what to do in equities, he pivots over to bonds. Right. You can't do that today. And I think. But it's just a really difficult situation. Right.
00:11:12.200 - 00:11:36.892, Speaker A: We've, the structural macro flows of crypto are against crypto. Right. I think it's just uncharted territory for crypto right now. And I think the fight, I think maybe it was Chris Berniske said this, the fight going on in markets is so much bigger than what's happening in crypto right now. We have a multi decade macro shift. We have potential stagflation. We have world war three, what it feels like in Ukraine.
00:11:36.892 - 00:11:53.860, Speaker A: We have famine on the horizon. It feels, it's, it's. We've never invested in crypto, like, uh, through, through this kind of period in 2018 and 2019. I was talking to some folks at blockworks about this. Uh, that was a tough period for crypto, but in general, global macro, like, that was fine, you know, so that was fun.
00:11:54.052 - 00:12:30.404, Speaker B: Um, and again, like, um, one last thing I would say is, um, I I felt that we were going to dip below a trillion market cap crypto. I saw some pretty negative skew on the downside. My initial target was 1500. Beat ETH 25,000 BTC. I revised that down to 1000 ETH 20,000 BTC. Can we go lower? Probably always. Again, it's very complicated market that we're under, but I think you don't want to be a hero in this market.
00:12:30.404 - 00:12:53.826, Speaker B: I haven't. I still feel that there's downside, particularly because I've said that the biggest challenge that we have in industry is self sabotage. And we've seen a lot of that recently. Bear markets just break things that haven't worked. A lot of the bullshit out there. And right now you're coming and testing that very clearly. We can get to this much more later.
00:12:53.826 - 00:13:28.664, Speaker B: In the episode celsius, three arrows. A lot of things. When these, when bear markets kind of come, they're great in many ways because people become much more scrutinizing of things and become much more aware and critical of things that haven't been working. And we're seeing that very clearly. Maybe to some, like, overextent, like, people are now, like, creating a lot of FuD on. Like, the tether fud is back on. Like, everything that people, like, every fud that you can imagine comes back on now, right?
00:13:29.404 - 00:14:17.086, Speaker A: Which there's some in fear states, people revert to the past in fear states, right? They're blinded by fear and they're kind of unable to think clearly about their theses, which I think is, you were saying your mental framework is so different than 2018 because it probably ties back to, you have a very strong core theses now that you've told me over and over and over again. And maybe in 2018, 2019, maybe you didn't have it as much. And so I have a feeling just from our telegrams, you're still seeing the future very clearly right now because you have those theses. I think in times of euphoria, though, people think they might see the future clearly. But when markets turn, you lose those theses really quickly. And we saw this, right, like, in the outcome of the bear market of 2017 or 2018. 2019 tokens, right? Tokens were not real.
00:14:17.086 - 00:14:38.974, Speaker A: It was like tokens. These things are scams. It's all about equity in companies, right? That was like what came out of the 20, 1818 2019 bear market, which was wrong. Right. We were just too early with tokens. And in the bear market before that, it was blockchain, not bitcoin, came out of that bear market. And you'll probably see something in this bear market, something around either nfts, probably.
00:14:38.974 - 00:14:51.834, Speaker A: Maybe daos. Actually, people will probably revert back to saying daos are not real, like companies, not Daos is probably the new blockchain, not bitcoin. But again, the thesis is right. It was just a little too early.
00:14:52.244 - 00:15:38.674, Speaker B: I want to go back to something you said earlier, and, look, I've seen some people being very critical recently, which just goes to this idea of, what did we miss? A lot of ecs were super bullish, and now people come out and parade and say, oh, we saw this coming. Things can't be this way. And of course we were going to correct. Look, I want to be, this is why I don't like to give predictions. I want to remind people, don't confuse optimism about this technology, about this movement, with also on the other side of your brain, reasonable valuations. And the challenge with crypto is that you really don't have a consensus around how to value crypto assets. It is doubly challenging.
00:15:38.674 - 00:16:09.794, Speaker B: And plus, it's a liquid venture asset class, like add. On top of the whole, confusion and panic in the market. On top of that, a new asset class where people don't really know how to value in true price discovery, including bitcoin. Like, yeah, of course you are. You should be always prepared to see this kind of drawdown in these assets, including bitcoin. 90, 80%. Can we go down further to 500 ETH? 200 ETH at.
00:16:09.794 - 00:16:39.370, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's not out of the question. Why? Because, I mean, it is just very challenging times and. But that being said, I am still very optimistic, and my long term thesis about this space has not gone away. In fact, I think it reinforces that, like, these periods are important to go back to a drawing board and say, listen, dow, governance is a theater. It's not working. We need to be way better at understanding how these things operate.
00:16:39.370 - 00:17:07.180, Speaker B: Like, look at the rari kind of tribe discussion, look at the merit circle and Ygg discussion. Those are going to be interesting precedents to say, how do we actually operate daos? Is this like, is this a very loose form of LLC? It's all bullshit, or are we actually creating the new LLC for the Internet? You know, look at Defi. I think Defi has been very orderly. Like, the liquidation's happening. Defi the Celsius. I think now people understand. Okay, wait a minute.
00:17:07.180 - 00:17:59.902, Speaker B: If I can't, like, if I can't audit my collateral, if I don't understand how my funds are being used, whether it's Lehman brothers, Bear Stearns, Celsius, derivate, whatever, then, yeah, we should be kind of more critical of that. And then it reinforces the need for Defi. And so in many ways, like, I just want to remind listeners that, like, I'm very bullish about this technology, but the challenge is narratives always get out of fundamentals. I think I've always said that, and I will stand it. And that's why I went to cash largely, you know, in November, December, and I've been going to cash because I'm just sitting in cash because I do see more opportunities coming this way when there's pain in the market. But I don't want, I'm not trying to be a hero. I am trying to, like, you know, be in a position of strength to back really smart teams.
00:17:59.902 - 00:18:18.262, Speaker B: And over the last couple weeks, I continue to deploy, I continue to invest in early stage stuff. That's my lane, that's my niche, that's my edge. But public markets, including ETH stocks everything to me. I don't feel like having edge, and I'm not eager to, like, jump in there yet.
00:18:18.358 - 00:18:50.254, Speaker A: Yep. All right, I'm obviously going to ask you the question of are you buying? But we're going to wait to do that. Make people sit through us talking about three arrows in Celsius and staked ETH, because I think it's really important to the conversation, and then we'll get into where we see the bear markets. I actually want to start with steeth because I think it's really important to both the Celsius situation and three arrows. So I'm going to do my best to try to describe what's going on with steeth and this, like, proverbial peg, even though it's not really a peg. And I'd love for you to correct me where I get this wrong. So, basically, to understand steeth, I think you have to understand Lido.
00:18:50.254 - 00:19:44.008, Speaker A: Lido provides this liquid staking service. Users are able to lock up any amount of ETH for validating purposes. And when they do that, they receive the steeth token steth, which can then be as often you get the steth token and then you rehypothecate that in defi to earn yield across defi, each steeth is redeemable for one ETH after the merge, but importantly, not before the merge. So steeth is backed one to one by staked ETH on the beacon chain. And this ETH is illiquid until a post merge hard fork historically, right, Steve and ETH, they trade one to one, thanks to they've got a very deep liquidity pool. And just like general sentiment that these are, quote unquote, like pegged assets, right. What happened though, is when terra, the whole terra and Luna situation happened, people basically began to question assumptions across crypto.
00:19:44.008 - 00:20:15.578, Speaker A: And one of those was steeth is like, should there be a peg of steeth to ETH? Um, and people started to just look at liquidity. And actually what happened is the curved steeth pool. Uh, steeth to ETH pool lost over 80% of its liquid ETH in just a couple of weeks. And so that makes people start to question, to really question the assumptions, right. People started to realize that these aren't actually one to one pegged assets. You've got a liquidity premium, or, uh, maybe discount, if you want to call it that. You've got Lido risk, you've got risk of the merge, uh, getting delayed.
00:20:15.578 - 00:20:33.668, Speaker A: Liquidity dried up on curve as people swapped their steeth back into ETH. And so the so called one to one peg, even though it really isn't a peg, began to break. And today it's trading at 94.94 steeth to ETH. So just a quick overview there, because I think it's really important. How did I do there?
00:20:33.836 - 00:20:48.414, Speaker B: Well, it's great. Look, full disclosure, I'm an investor in Lido. I was a steed investor in Lido. So, you know, obviously I have some bias, but that gives me some perspective. You're absolutely right. Look, it's not a peg. Every state is backed and fully collateralized by ETH.
00:20:48.414 - 00:21:23.584, Speaker B: The issue though, is these things should have never traded at par. Like, naturally, there should be an illiquidity discount because it's a time value. Money, okay, there's some lido incentives that kind of compensate for that. But if you look at other derivatives or like other stake ETH, kind of, this is anchor a few other, like stake count. I think there, there are other in the market. I think finance is another. And these are all traded into some degree at a discount.
00:21:23.584 - 00:21:38.676, Speaker B: And that's, it's like a closet. It's not like a close in mutual fund, but it's kind of like that, right? You look at GBTC discount, like these things should have a discount because you know, you're taking some risk and like, you know, there's an opportunity cost. Yeah, yeah.
00:21:38.780 - 00:21:40.174, Speaker A: I think that's a really good comparison.
00:21:40.284 - 00:22:18.224, Speaker B: And, yeah, and so, like, you know, again, like, it traded, you know, a par for a long time. When it first launched, it kind of, like, was pretty volatile, like, around, like, this 90 cent range. And. But now, of course, as people are for sellers and they want liquidity, especially in these market conditions, Alameda Celsius, or big holders of stake, these now, of course, they've been needing liquidity, which we'll get into later in the episode, then. Yeah. That puts more downward pressure, and you see a trade at a lower discount.
00:22:18.604 - 00:23:01.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think what a lot of people. I think what I just said about steeth, just the overview, is a widely understood thing. I think maybe the less understood phenomena is that Lido, to gain market share, needed steeth to be widely adopted by these defi protocols. And to have it adopted by the protocols, it was really helpful if it was one to one, and it was historically one to one. What happened is these DeFi protocols set their risk parameters, and just funds also set the risk parameters as if one ETH equals one steeth. So then funds and also companies like the Celsius of the world took out these massive levered, or just really massive positions, as if one steeth equals one ethan. And that's where really shit hit the fan.
00:23:01.804 - 00:23:20.684, Speaker A: And what's happened is that the market has realized that, yeah, steeth is. Steeth is a function of everything that goes into pricing. A token. Right. Desire, like supply and demand. It's the volume and liquidity of the market. How well can the market handle sell pressure? It's the likelihood of maybe smart contract risk.
00:23:20.684 - 00:23:27.610, Speaker A: It's the likelihood of a successful or a delayed merge. Right. These all go into the price of lido or, excuse me, of Steve.
00:23:27.732 - 00:23:47.798, Speaker B: We talk about themes and narratives a lot. This is perhaps one of the most important things that people need to understand. People get into trouble and to do two things. One of them is a mismatch of assets and liabilities. Right? This idea, right. Celsius was yield farming, had perhaps staked ETH. And you have depositor money.
00:23:47.798 - 00:24:07.434, Speaker B: When people want you, you know, everyone wants their money. You can't redeem it. Then it becomes a problem. Right. And so, as an investor, you always need to be very cognizant of what are your liabilities, what's your debt position versus your assets. Right. And if there's a mismatch in duration, then you got to be really careful around how you manage that.
00:24:07.434 - 00:24:29.974, Speaker B: And very few people can do that over an extended period of time. Successfully. Lehman, Bear Stearns. There are literally skeletons and graveyards along the way throughout history. And the second point is tied to this is leverage. Asset class as volatile as crypto. You know, it's a difference between speculating and gambling.
00:24:29.974 - 00:24:49.594, Speaker B: We are all speculating here about the promise of this technology at some point will be truly revolutionary. But add on top of that leverage, and you are just literally counting your days because you, you know, you are putting so much risk of not being able to see that day.
00:24:50.054 - 00:25:03.062, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. Let's talk about Celsius. Um, because they are an example of something that got impacted by Steve Celsius. I have a feeling most people know what it is. It's a, uh. I kind of hate this term, but it's a CFI app, right? It's not a DeFi protocol.
00:25:03.062 - 00:25:45.714, Speaker A: It's not a centralized, it's not like a JP Morgan or Bank of America company. It's a centralized crypto company that, that uses Defi. Um, and it gives users access to, like, trading high yield deposits on stable coins and crypto, crypto backed lending. They had raised a ridiculous amount of money, for lack of a better term. They'd raised over $850 million of venture from different pension funds, I think some sovereign wealth funds, some of the best venture firms. At one point, they custodied nearly $30 billion of funds for almost 2 million customers. So these are, these are, these are really big numbers, right? Almost 900 million of venture raised, almost 30 billion of Aum, almost 2 million customers.
00:25:45.714 - 00:26:36.154, Speaker A: These are really large numbers. How this happened, how everything that we're seeing in Celsius happened. Here's my kind of explanation. As I understand it, Celsius has been operating almost more like a degen hedge fund than a bank, or like, they're like a bank on steroids, basically what they've been doing. So here's what Celsius does, is they take deposits they issue on and off chain loans. Um, so they might issue, like, off chain loans to different market makers or hedge funds. They might issue on chain loans into different DeFi protocols, and then they keep the interest rate on the spread, right? So if they, let's say they advertise, um, 5% on USDC deposits, which I think at one point they were doing, what they then do is they might swap that USDC, uh, into, like, UST, and then put that into anchor and make 20% on the UST, and at one point, and then they keep the 15% spread.
00:26:36.154 - 00:27:01.138, Speaker A: At one point, they had, I think it was over $500 million of exposure to UST on anchor. So here's what happened. And, like they have, Celsius has been known probably more than blockfi, more than any of the other lenders for taking risk. Right. Last December, they had, they admitted losses related to the $120 million Badger Dow hack. And I think a lot of people looked at that, and they're like, wait a minute. My money is.
00:27:01.138 - 00:27:27.708, Speaker A: I'm a Celsius customer, and my money's in badger. This badger Dow thing, which is, like, this new protocol, like, okay, that's a little weird, but it was the bull market, so people didn't think much of it. Anyways, moving forward here, Luna failure likely started a lot of the trouble that we see today with Celsius. Right. There are some rumors that they had exposure, like I mentioned, of up to a $500 million of USC on anchor. Um, but they also did that with different stable coins and. And ETH as well.
00:27:27.708 - 00:27:45.820, Speaker A: Right. So let's. This is kind of how it ties together with steeth. For ETH deposits, Celsius was promising between six to 8% in interest, with a lot of that is likely earned from staking rewards on, uh, through steeth. Right. But the biggest issue is that assets held on the beacon chain are completely locked up. Right.
00:27:45.820 - 00:28:18.280, Speaker A: You can't unstake those for now. So, obviously, like we talked about, lido solves that problem through this liquid derivative asset called steeth. Uh, Steve was trading at one to 1 celcius, probably in the risk parameters, said that it was trading at one to one, uh, because it needs to match its assets to its liabilities. In a bull market, that all works out. Right? All is good in the bull market. But with a liquidity crisis and the bear market, the steeth to ETH ratio, technically not a peg, began to slide. Now Celsius customers ETH deposits and swapped a liquid, uh, staked ETH, assuming it would trade one to one with.
00:28:18.280 - 00:28:44.192, Speaker A: With ETH. Now it's trading at had over $500 million worth of, worth of steth, which starts to become a really concerning position if the merge gets delayed, because obviously, then they can't redeem it for ETH. And so, like, basically, you just had this cascading fear in the market. Crypto continues to fall. Depositors lose confidence. They want their funds back. Celsius has illiquid assets trading at $0.93
00:28:44.192 - 00:29:07.400, Speaker A: on the dollar. Liabilities, like you mentioned, greater than assets. People, more and more people lose confidence. The cycle continues. It just came out. Celsius is a $400 million leveraged wrapped bitcoin maker position that they have to keep toggling up to avoid public liquidation prices. All that comes to a head when Mashinsky and Celsius announced that they are freezing withdrawals from Celsius.
00:29:07.400 - 00:29:16.184, Speaker A: So there's a lot more to talk about here, but that's kind of the summary. What do you make of this whole position and just unfolding of Celsius here? Santiago?
00:29:16.844 - 00:29:56.924, Speaker B: Well, I thought that was a great summary. I think a lot of this started to kind of unfold when they lost. I want to say I was trying to pull up the numbers and we can reference it, but they lost a lot of money on USD, on anchor. Was it 500 million? I thought it was like 176 million. Maybe that was state count because there was also a hack on state. I might be wrong, but anyways, they've been pretty degen on their yield farming strategies historically to, as you say, play this spread, right. To go after capture, more yielded than promising their depositors.
00:29:56.924 - 00:30:41.934, Speaker B: And so that kind of level of risk taking at some point came to hurt them. They lost a lot of money in a lot of these hacks. DeFi is still very risky. Right. And so when you're putting that amount of money on chain without insurance, and ultimately they started losing money for customers, I think like that, they probably hoped that they were going to be able to absorb that over time and kind of like pump that. That obviously came, became much more of an issue when this spot started and people started, like, trying to withdraw their funds. Layer on top of that, the liquidity, kind of this mismatch of assets and liabilities, and it was a classic bank run.
00:30:41.934 - 00:30:56.298, Speaker B: Right. I don't know for a fact that they're insolvent. I mean, obviously they became really close to being liquidated on chain. One of their vaults on maker. They fixed that. I think there's a rap. Bitcoin, kind of, the liquidation price of that is, like, really close.
00:30:56.298 - 00:30:58.814, Speaker B: Like it was 22k. It was, I think it was $25,000.
00:30:59.124 - 00:31:01.364, Speaker A: Liquidation price is at 17k today.
00:31:01.404 - 00:31:10.684, Speaker B: It's 1716k now. Yeah, they were, they've repaid that. And so they, their health score kind of went pretty, pretty, like, close to being liquid.
00:31:10.724 - 00:31:26.348, Speaker A: And that's a big position, right? Like they. Celsius has the. I think it's the largest wrapped bitcoin vault on maker. There's a. The last I saw, I might have this wrong, but I think it's like 24,000 wrapped bitcoin. So what's the, what's the math on that? 24,000 times, like what's bitcoin at today?
00:31:26.396 - 00:31:27.524, Speaker B: 20 or something?
00:31:27.604 - 00:31:30.306, Speaker A: So I think it's 22 times 24.
00:31:30.370 - 00:31:32.746, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like, it's 50 or 500.
00:31:32.930 - 00:31:33.738, Speaker A: Yeah, 500.
00:31:33.786 - 00:31:35.690, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:31:35.802 - 00:31:37.482, Speaker A: That is a massive position.
00:31:37.618 - 00:31:45.890, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. Look, I mean, I think I. If you're a customer, I don't know.
00:31:46.002 - 00:31:46.442, Speaker A: They.
00:31:46.538 - 00:32:16.426, Speaker B: They haven't resumed withdrawals, is my understanding. But, yeah, I mean, I never have used Celsius. I would encourage most people to kind of look at this, and if you have assets there, hopefully you can get them out. But it further emphasizes this idea that, you know, you want to be in control. And the premise of Defi has always been, you need to be able to audit your collateral. 24 7365. Like, if you put your money on Aave and you want to.
00:32:16.426 - 00:32:36.344, Speaker B: You want to borrow against your collateral, you want to head, you want to short, you want to do whatever you can, always being. You're always. You can always audit that position and control it. Right. If you repay your debt, you can always get your money back like that. And look, again, the criticism of Defi has always been, it's. It's over collateralized, and I get it right.
00:32:36.344 - 00:33:15.792, Speaker B: This is not very efficient, but still, I mean, I think, like, it is transparent and just fully collateralized and, like, you know, over collateralized, actually. And. And so this is, again, just the challenge with crypto has always been that people don't feel really comfortable, like, being their own custodian. They don't want to manage their keys. They want to put it in an app, and most people feel really comfortable with that. And so, yeah, it's just an unfortunate situation. I hope they survive, because, I mean, they have a lot of customers, and so if you're liquidating all at once, all of those customers, it's pretty bad for the industry.
00:33:15.792 - 00:33:31.064, Speaker B: Like, a lot of people just don't want to come back. So, hopefully they survive and they do better. You know, risk management, whoever is running risk in these strategies needs to seriously reconsider what they've been doing.
00:33:32.404 - 00:33:52.632, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think it's a good reminder for folks that when you see six to 8% yield, you're like, oh, Celsius offers 68% yield, but my bank of America account offers only 0.01% yield. You're like, no brainer to put it in Celsius. There's risk every time you see apy. Right? And so I think there's two kinds of Celsius users.
00:33:52.768 - 00:34:22.867, Speaker B: Sorry, there's two kinds of users of Celsius, I think. Or maybe there's more. But there's like two archetypes. One of them is people that understand what you just said, which is, yeah, I understand they're doing some crazy stuff, but I'm just gonna play this, and it's not going to be me. I'll be able, the music will stop, but I'll be able to, like, I'm not gonna be the last sucker, and I'll be able to get my money out, right. I know people that have been doing that, and they knew the risks. And there's another type which is more inherent, like the Luna situation, which said, hey, look, this is.
00:34:22.867 - 00:35:15.612, Speaker B: It should be fine, right? Like, you know, they have no idea of level of risk that exists still at the smart contract level for DeFi. And unfortunately, Celsius is not your typical bank. Now, again, banks in global financial crisis have this issue, too. And so the Volcker rule and all this stuff that has been implemented since is trying to mitigate and address, like, the capital reserve requirements, and they constantly get tested. Banks are heavily regulated and audited today, constantly for this reason. But Celsius has gone, is not, or has pretended to not be subject to the same level of scrutiny and regulation as traditional banks. Now, of course, now this puts into question, should Celsius be regulated? Should these c five apps be treated the same as banks? And candidly, the answer is probably yes or actually yes.
00:35:15.612 - 00:35:36.464, Speaker B: Now, you can argue that they're my. On the, on the margin, that could be treated to some extent, somewhat like there could be some exceptions, but I am not. I'm of the mind that they should be treated like banks, because anytime you're, you get deposit or money and you're controlling that, then you should be subject to the same of scrutiny that a bank.
00:35:37.044 - 00:36:22.652, Speaker A: Oh, I'm not sure. Okay, so there's two things there. One is the point that you made that this is not that much different than what banks do. Yeah, I mean, I think there's a tradfi analogy here to this firm called MF Global, which folks in finance who were around pre 2008, 2009 would remember them. They had 42 billion aum. They were a massive derivatives and commodities brokerage firm that basically just went belly up. They were basically taking customer funds and making bets on european bonds that those bets didn't work out and they went belly up, from my understanding, or there's long term capital management is obviously the really famous analogy as well in terms of the regulation side.
00:36:22.652 - 00:36:37.696, Speaker A: I think it's just important to remember that, yes, Celsius is a CFI company. They're not a defi company. Okay, so let's say, yes, you regulate Celsius. Do you also regulate compound and AAve with those same regulations?
00:36:37.840 - 00:37:21.562, Speaker B: No. No. For the reason I'm in agreement with you for the very precise distinction that compound and AAVE are smart contracts. They are not controlling your funds. They can't. You're always in control of your funds. Now, they can liquidate your funds based on certain parameters, but very specific set and rules of a smart contract that what you should focus on for AAVE and compound is this idea that the smart contract, the immutability of the smart contract, meaning you want to have a certainty that Stani, Robert and company cannot change a smart contract to, at some point, be able to modify that and control your funds.
00:37:21.562 - 00:37:34.054, Speaker B: And as long as that is true, meaning truly immutable code, then. Then I think you. That that level of guarantee is enough to not regulate it like a bank.
00:37:34.354 - 00:37:36.442, Speaker A: I think that's a good point. Right.
00:37:36.538 - 00:38:03.978, Speaker B: Okay. They may be able to pause, change certain parameters to protect user funds, to implement certain changes, but never control your funds. Never kind of like sweep your wallet. Right. And so as long as that's true, that's how you make the distinction between Celsius. I centralized financial applications and institutions and providers to decentralized applications and providers.
00:38:04.146 - 00:38:29.930, Speaker A: It was crazy seeing Mashinsky tweeting the day before they basically announced that the withdrawals were frozen. I think he was tweeting at dudas that Celsius withdraw withdrawal freezes are fud. We have enough liquidity. Our job is to fight tradfi together, though. I guess this is the natural thing that you do. And the banks were doing it in 2008 2009 saying that, or 2007 2008, like, saying that they were fine, too. But I guess that's all you can do when there's about to be a bank run.
00:38:29.930 - 00:38:32.014, Speaker A: But, man, that was. That was not a good look.
00:38:32.754 - 00:38:39.854, Speaker B: No, I mean, look, I have my reservations. I pass in the seed round. I met the team early on, and I just. I just didn't give you a hunch.
00:38:41.354 - 00:39:08.200, Speaker A: Empire is brought to you by Bitmex with the launch of their spot exchange. Bitmex is running an insane promo right now. We wanted to give you the inside scoop. Here's the deal. For the next two months, users who trade $250 worth of crypto on Bitmex's spot exchange will be entered into their million dollar giveaway. Prizes range from thousands of dollars all the way up to $500,000. That's right.
00:39:08.200 - 00:39:37.952, Speaker A: Trade $250 on Bitmex for a chance to personally win $500,000. Beyond the million dollar giveaway, new users can also get up to 200. Beamex Bmex. That's Bitmex's new token coming soon just by creating an account and going through KYC and trading. So you can actually get BitMex tokens just by creating an account and trading. The more you trade, the higher your chances of winning. What are you waiting for? Go to bitmex.com
00:39:37.952 - 00:39:55.110, Speaker A: today. Sign up for an account bitmex.com dot what happens from here with Celsius. So there's rumors. Let me, let me share some of the rumors. I don't know if any of these are true. There are rumors that Alameda or DCG might buy up some of the distressed assets.
00:39:55.110 - 00:40:31.194, Speaker A: There are rumors that, well, I guess Nexo, who's Celsius's competitor, is making a public offer. There's, I think they hired Citygate or, excuse me, citigroup to advise on financing options. They brought on like a top law firm to advise on possible solutions. TLDr, I mean, they have $10 billion of, there are about 10 billion in customer assets in Celsius. Only about a billion and a half are accounted for in public Celsius wallets. So you talk about this mismatch of liabilities to assets. There is a clear mismatch there.
00:40:31.194 - 00:40:32.964, Speaker A: What do you think happens with Celsius.
00:40:33.114 - 00:40:43.864, Speaker B: Just to go, they might, like, all those assets might be like sitting with Genesis and a few other like, folks funds even that are doing yield farming strategies. So like, it's going to be hard to do a roll up on chain. But no, I agree.
00:40:43.904 - 00:40:47.800, Speaker A: Like, no, true. There's 500 million with, with maker, there's, you got to add up all those, correct?
00:40:47.832 - 00:41:29.804, Speaker B: Yeah, but look, I mean, hopefully they've sort of found someone to provide a backstop and like inject some liquidity. And I'm speaking this, I don't know for a fact that they're like totally insolvent. Like, I'm not prepared to say that they might be just facing, I don't know what the buffer is of what their requirements are. I don't know how much depositor are in queue. I think slowly, progressively they start allowing, and hopefully they reintroduce the ability for users to withdraw funds to some extent and maybe offer them an incentive to like keep funds in the platform and commit to like keeping them for a couple months and giving them some incentive with Celsius token. I don't know. They probably will do this.
00:41:29.804 - 00:42:04.630, Speaker B: I'd be as a user I would be probably, like, not very encouraged by that and just try to get my money out around the speculation for DCG. You got to remember that Barry is a restructuring lawyer, I think, and so he pro. And on top of that, DCG obviously is front and center been trying to get approved in ETF to, like, fix this idea. Like GBDC, THC, all these different, like, mutual funds. Those are mutual funds are trading at a pretty big discount, and so they might absorb that because they can probably more easily absorb that. DC as a huge balance sheet and a venture portfolio. So they probably might be able to.
00:42:04.630 - 00:42:39.242, Speaker B: So the scenario is someone, and I just heard, I just saw on Twitter, I'm not sure if this is true, that the existing investors probably will not give Celsius more money. Like, this is, like, the canadian pension fund probably is not going to inject more money into Celsius. I doubt that that scenario is going to happen. Uh, can Celsius find another, like, equity investor, like, borrow? Like, maybe that's an area one, and buy more time, um, and hope that the market corrects. And they. Scenario two is that they somehow short the market and they're able to back. Back the coins, and then, like, you know, you.
00:42:39.242 - 00:43:01.096, Speaker B: You're in a much better, like, financial spot or. But, yeah, hopefully they don't go down for the reason that, uh, you know, I don't want to see all these users be in pain, um, more so than they've seen now the value of their holdings go down because of the market. Um, so, yeah, I don't know.
00:43:01.200 - 00:43:14.124, Speaker A: I think. I think there are probably four. If. If the assets don't match the liabilities, there are probably four outcomes. One is external funding from existing investors. That's probably off the table, like you just said. Second is a big loan.
00:43:14.124 - 00:43:29.754, Speaker A: The third is an acquisition. Right. Like, Nexo came along and proposed to take over their assets or they go bankrupt. I think those are really the only four options. So, yeah, I'm also rooting for Celsius, and, yeah, they have 1.7 million customers. I'm really rooting for them.
00:43:29.754 - 00:43:30.162, Speaker A: I hope.
00:43:30.218 - 00:43:32.122, Speaker B: I'm rooting for the customers of Celsius.
00:43:32.178 - 00:43:35.434, Speaker A: I'm rooting for the customers. I'm rooting for the customers. Yeah, exactly.
00:43:35.594 - 00:43:38.534, Speaker B: I'm rooting more for Defi. And.
00:43:41.714 - 00:43:51.774, Speaker A: Let'S talk about three arrows. You give me your overview on three arrows. Who they are, what they do. Kyle and sue. How long have you known these guys? What's your background with 3 hours?
00:43:53.434 - 00:44:32.854, Speaker B: I've had limited interactions with sue and Kyle. I know their story. I mean, they started both, I think, in Japan, they're like FX traders. And then they set up shop in Singapore and started with proprietary capital, meaning their own capital. I'm pretty sure that they haven't raised from external capital for like 3 hours proper. And I would classify them as traders, not necessarily like very like market makers traders. I think that's their DNA.
00:44:32.854 - 00:45:06.002, Speaker B: And they grew up to a point, I think, up to 18 billion in kind of Aum. Again, not. This is all kind of piecing together information. It's not very like, I don't know for a fact, but, like, assume that they grew to multiple billions. And they are very important players. And a couple of strategies, one of which has been kind of playing this like, grayscale premium historically, like GBTC, the. Some of these instruments have traded at a premium.
00:45:06.002 - 00:45:41.920, Speaker B: And you could have, like, a very popular strategy was to capture that premium, like, like, be kind of neutral and just capture the premium. These have now traded at a very steep discount, 20, 30%. And so that is, that has obviously impacted them and others in the market. They also, of course, have invested in a number of other funds, including Defiance capital. This is Arthur's fund. They kind of seeded that starry night capital, which is an NFT fund. And from their balance sheet, they've invested in a lot of rounds, like Dydx and a few others.
00:45:41.920 - 00:46:35.898, Speaker B: And they're an important player in the market on the venture side, on the trading side. And they use many different providers, and there's a lot of connectivity in the ecosystem with three arrows because they have such a big balance sheet. And of course, so, like, hopefully people understand, like, this is a very big entity in crypto. They play on a number of protocols. A lot of other organizations have exposure to them, some of which have come out publicly recently to kind of talk about the situation that's going on. I started hearing rumors about their financial position and insolvency of being margin called meaning for people unaware, you know, is, you know, they had a lot of leverage, leverage positions. And so when the value of the collateral drops, you know, you need a refill.
00:46:35.898 - 00:47:11.898, Speaker B: You need to, like, fix your, you know, whoever's on the other side providing you that capital calls you and says, hey, you need to, you know, put more ETH, otherwise we're going to liquidate you. Right. And so I think that was, people started hearing that you actually, you were the second person to ping me about this. And. And there was some rampant kind of speculation about their position, like no one has heard about from Kyle and Sue, which have a very historically, had a very, like, visible and public kind of voice on going crypto Twitter. People are like, oh, they haven't tweeted in days. Zoo kind of, like, deleted his Instagram profile.
00:47:11.898 - 00:48:05.474, Speaker B: And now people, like, start, like, really kind of doing these conspiracy theories like they're on the run. They're like, they've deleted, like, every reference to every coin in their, in their bio on Twitter. But more concretely, I think a lot of these providers that interacted with three arrows came out saying, hey, listen, we actually haven't heard from them. They kind of, like, yanked a lot of the capital from our trading accounts and we haven't heard from them. And so, and then sue kind of came out in response and saying, hey, we're going to, in a very kind of, like, serious tone, more character like, uncharacteristic of, like, how he typically tweets. It says, like, we're kind of working through it, which to me, felt like he was acknowledging part of that. But I haven't heard since, and I don't think there's been an update from him since that tweet.
00:48:05.474 - 00:48:07.586, Speaker B: So I don't know if I fill in the gaps.
00:48:07.730 - 00:48:13.822, Speaker A: I mean, I'll give my thoughts on 3 hours in a second. Can you explain to folks how margin calls work?
00:48:13.898 - 00:48:44.272, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, like, say that I have. Say that I have, like, one ETH, and I want to borrow against that because I want to, you know, go borrow against that and buy more ETH. Like, say that I deposit ETH with Genesis, which is a big kind of entity owned by grayscale. Sorry, DCG. I give Genesis one ETH. I deposit with them, and I say, hey, guys, I want to borrow on that position.
00:48:44.272 - 00:49:47.594, Speaker B: How much? And they say, well, you can borrow 60%, 70% of the value of that ETH, and say ETH is at a thousand for round numbers. So you can borrow 600 or 700 on that, right. And they will typically tell you, look, if the value of that collateral, which is a thousand today, ever drops below, you know, 800 on the 600 that you borrowed, two things can happen. We're going to call you and you say you need to keep a certain percentage ratio relative to what you're borrowing so that the, whoever is the lender always wants to keep a margin, because if you can't put more collateral to keep that ratio, they want to protect themselves because they're taking some counterparty risk. Was saying they want to have enough time to be able to. They have the ability to take that collateral and sell it almost immediately because they're not in the business of being taking a view on where the market's going to go. These market makers don't, are not.
00:49:47.594 - 00:50:01.454, Speaker B: They're typically very neutral on the market. They're just providing these services. They don't have necessarily. They don't want to have balance sheet risk. Right. They don't want to go long ETH or short ETH. They just want to provide these services to people that need liquidity and want to borrow against their asset base.
00:50:01.454 - 00:50:50.070, Speaker B: And so what probably ended up happening is, as we know, that three arrows was running a very kind of levered portfolio of ETH and a number of other assets, Avax probably, and a number of other crypto assets, some of which are liquid, some of which are liquid. And so the basket of that at some point as a market crash in the way that it has recently, you know, these guys call them up and say, hey, you need a new postmort collateral, and if you can't do that, you get liquidated, which as we have now learned that 3 hours was in a margin called and maybe, maybe liquidated part of their book. I don't know. Combine that with Celsius and combine that with other folks, that's a four seller.
00:50:50.222 - 00:51:06.220, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. These things are all tied together. So here's my. So three arrows is one of the largest funds in crypto. I think you mentioned 18 billion. I've seen different folks tag it as at the peak it was 15 billion. Someone mentioned 22 billion to me, someone mentioned 20.
00:51:06.220 - 00:51:09.140, Speaker A: That's the ballpark size to put it in perspective.
00:51:09.212 - 00:51:19.572, Speaker B: Paradigm, I think has like 8 billion, a 16 c, raised four and a half, recently had two. Maybe the value of portfolio is much larger, but like this is massive fund top, right.
00:51:19.628 - 00:51:32.000, Speaker A: They started in three arrows was. Yeah, exactly. One of the biggest funds in all of crypto. They started the fund maybe a decade ago. Like they're very early. Kyle and Suzu, I think they went to high school together. They also traded together at Credit Suisse.
00:51:32.000 - 00:51:53.998, Speaker A: They're traders, right. And they've made a lot of money playing the different l one bets. So terra solana, nier, avalanche. They made a lot of money playing different l one s. Mina, I think as well. Polkadot, Kusama. Like they've been in those very deep into defi Aave, Balancer, DyDx, lido.
00:51:53.998 - 00:52:19.188, Speaker A: They're in a lot of those as well. Trader Joe, they've invested in the equity rounds of like blockfi, dare bit fireblocks, darkware. They're in axie infinity. So they've made a lot of money on the venture side, but also, or on the liquid side, but also, really the venture side. And this is where it gets kind of interesting. There was this great thread by Degentrader, I forget his name. We can link to it, because I want to give the guy a shout out, basically.
00:52:19.188 - 00:52:42.148, Speaker A: Here's what he said. He said the last public number for three arrows, assets were tagged at 18 billion. I strongly suggest the real amount to be lower by then. There were rumors of them pledging their dare bit stake, even though they had already disposed of them economically. Here's where it gets interesting. Let's assume half of the portfolio's venture half is liquid. So now the 18 billion gets cut into 9 billion and 9 billion.
00:52:42.148 - 00:53:16.232, Speaker A: Assume that all, all of that was in. Let's just assume that that has gone down maybe 70 or 80%. This puts their liquid portfolio at two or $3 billion at best. But if you add in a lot of the l one s and these altcoins, realistically, their liquid portfolio would have been drawn down to a billion dollars or less. This then starts to make. So everyone's like, $18 billion fund. How can they be insolvent? Well, when you understand that their liquid portfolio might be down to less than a billion, this starts to make sense on why they can actually get margin called.
00:53:16.232 - 00:53:20.864, Speaker A: And not being able to meet a margin call is kind of the death now for any hedge fund. Right?
00:53:20.904 - 00:53:25.376, Speaker B: Crypto or tradfi, long term capital management, Lehman Brothers.
00:53:25.560 - 00:53:26.444, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:53:27.464 - 00:53:32.924, Speaker B: So many funds during COVID like, time and time again, you get margin call, you're pretty much done.
00:53:33.224 - 00:53:51.108, Speaker A: And I think they are realizing what hedge funds have realized and made the same mistake. They're amazing traders. They've also been in a lot of the great venture deals. Their problem is liquidity. Right. They have been on the wrong side of a lot of illiquid synthetic trades. First, the GBTC trade, which now trades at a 30% discount.
00:53:51.108 - 00:54:00.436, Speaker A: Uh, they got really offsides on the steeth trade. Right. Um, I think they had, like, 30,000 steeth so far. Um, but that number's probably higher. Yeah.
00:54:00.500 - 00:54:01.984, Speaker B: Down to 16,000 or something.
00:54:02.324 - 00:54:29.058, Speaker A: Exactly. It's, uh. They made a $560 million investment in locked Luna, which that is down to, I don't know, probably zero now, or like $5 billion from 560 million. They're down probably 99% on that. And they've, it's. There are a lot of rumors of them now using their, the venture side of their portfolio, that the actual equity as basically collateral. So it's interesting.
00:54:29.058 - 00:54:56.254, Speaker A: I spoke with one of the big funds in Asia today, and I was like, what's your take on three arrows? They're like, we do not deal with three arrows. They are too smart. They're the smartest people in the industry. We will not trade with them because we will lose when we trade with them. But I think, so they're, they're brilliant. Kyle and sue are both brilliant, but they just mismanaged risk and got two offsides on the illiquid, on the illiquid side of things.
00:54:56.294 - 00:56:09.204, Speaker B: So, yeah, I don't want to say, like, for a fact, because I haven't talked to them. A, I do think they're very sophisticated professional traders, and, but I don't know if they're insolvent. I don't know the extent by which they haven't been able to meet their margin calls. Like, I just want to be very clear and transparent that I'm not operating under information that I know that they're insolvent or not assuming. But look, there is always some element of truth into these rumors. We haven't heard from them. So, you know, if they want to come on and discuss that, more than welcome, but I will, I will go back to what I said, a general statement, because people want to hear, hey, how do I, how can I, I think you always look at these things, whether they're true or not, and you then say, assuming they were true, then how do we navigate the one as a, how do we navigate generally in this current environment? What can we learn from it as an industry? And personally, how do you navigate a bear market? How do you become a better investor? I think these moments, you look back and say, if there was a mistake, how can I avoid that? And I think it goes back to the overarching theme of this conversation, is, don't play it, folks.
00:56:09.204 - 00:56:41.764, Speaker B: Do not use leverage. Just stay away from it. Leverage should be used to mitigate risk, not to increase risk. Very few people understand that. And how do you actually do that is difficult for people to understand. And so just, just don't use it. And second, you know, don't let greed get to you, right? Whenever you're, there's this mismatch of assets and liabilities, whenever you're living ahead of your means, whenever you're, look, I'll tell it from my personal stance.
00:56:41.764 - 00:57:20.450, Speaker B: Most of my portfolio is illiquid. Like, over 60% of it is illiquid. Now, say that I invest in project a. I will be vesting over three four years say that the coin lists and it's trading at a billion, this great valuation. I don't look at that and I say, whoa, I just did 100 x. I say, I'm gonna keep it a cost and maybe apply some sort of like, profile, say, okay, I'm going to invest over x period of time. I may have liquidity over the next four years, but I don't.
00:57:20.450 - 00:58:27.124, Speaker B: Most of the time in my brain, I don't compete that big number. And I say, whoa, whoa, I've made this great return. Let me go out and pretend that all that is liquid and spend more or invest more again. You always want to be in a position of strength, whether you have multiple sources of income, passive income, another job, whatever it is. But you managing liquidity and constructing a portfolio that can allow you to be in a position of strength and give you the time and the luxury to go out and spend like as animals do, not most of their time, not doing much, just simply thinking about, about the future, thinking about observing the market, not necessarily playing it, not necessarily having to react to these very brutal market conditions. Like right now, I've been in this sort of, like, sidelines since I left paraphy. Like, I'm investing a lot of my capital into very early stage deals, how I size those positions.
00:58:27.124 - 00:59:32.554, Speaker B: There's a lot of thinking that goes into that because I always want to maintain, which I didn't have in 2000, in the last crash. Like, I had another job. Like I was working for, like a health startup that I've been a part of because I love healthcare. Like, I had other sources of income, which allowed me to kind of, like, not have to sell my crypto assets. Like, live day to day. A lot of other people in crypto, like, borrow against their ETH stack and other positions, using maker and whatnot, in hopes of then repaying that. But that's very tricky, right? And so, you know, again, I'll stop talking here, but I think the lesson for me in the last cycle that I've applied in this cycle, which I feel much more calm, is be to be, always have liquidity, to be able to not have to give up on your thesis, to not get liquidated, to live, to actually, like, you know, as much as we love the metaverse, we still need to eat and consume in the real world and spend.
00:59:32.554 - 00:59:59.324, Speaker B: And so, you know, that if that's like that, that to me, would be like the number one takeaway out of all of this, which is right now. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to respond to this market movement. I don't have to sell assets forcibly. I can buy more if I want. We'll get to that later. And that, to me, is like, maybe you're in the same position, right? You're building I right now, I'm just thinking and observing.
00:59:59.324 - 01:00:32.826, Speaker B: The same little leopard sleeps 18, 20 hours a day and hunts for four, but in those 4 hours, he fucking hunts. He's able to do that because he's been resting most of the day. And I think Stan Druckenmill also references, like, you want to be kind of zen and just observing things. You go in a casino, you're playing blackjack. If you're playing every hand, that's the surest way to actually, like, die. Like to lose all your money. You shouldn't have to play every car that you're dealt.
01:00:32.826 - 01:01:04.894, Speaker B: And crypto is difficult because it's 24 7365 market, and it can be a casino, but you don't have to play it. You don't. Deacon Spartan provides a lot of wisdom. And again, time again, he says, listen, guys, like, you don't have to play the market all the time. Sometimes the best strategy is to just sit on your hands and observe and not react to all of this craziness that's going on like this. Crypto. Listen, is crypto going to go away? Do you think that crypto is going to die?
01:01:05.514 - 01:01:06.730, Speaker A: Obviously not.
01:01:06.922 - 01:01:34.522, Speaker B: The idea of building decentralized institutions and protocols that. That no one can easily control the ability to transmit value and have digital property, you think that premise is going to go whether it's expressed as an NFT or a token ERC 20 or whatever. Do you think that fundamental premises capture the imagination of artists, investors, creators will go away?
01:01:34.618 - 01:01:35.574, Speaker A: Of course not.
01:01:36.874 - 01:01:52.302, Speaker B: And so why would you. What's the whole point of, like, being greet again, just, you want. Is it going to take five years? No, it's probably going to take 15 years, 20 years to get there. But again, people get greedy.
01:01:52.478 - 01:02:06.946, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Contagion, three arrows is one of the biggest borrowers and clients for the lenders. Globally. Celsius is one of the biggest lenders. Right. A lot of the lenders might be a little offsides right now.
01:02:06.946 - 01:02:31.418, Speaker A: They operate these big $10 billion balance sheets, maybe even bigger, and they don't have much of an equity buffer there. Um, obviously, different lenders are. Are different. Like Genesis, for example, like, really clean lender like that. Genesis is probably, uh, Genesis is, like, very amazing. These lenders aren't all treated equal, but still, uh, lenders are going to end up protecting themselves by withdrawing credit from the system. Uh, loans are going to be recalled.
01:02:31.418 - 01:02:49.444, Speaker A: Credit is going to be shrunk. When credit leaves the system. There's less money overall in a system. Less money in the system equals less money for coins, bad for coin price. Right? Price goes down. What do you think comes next? We saw Luna, then Celsius, then three arrows. What's next?
01:02:50.024 - 01:03:33.554, Speaker B: I think we'll continue to see speculation and some thought around the financial position of other funds more concretely. I do look, I mean, everyone that's been long, crypto is down 80, 90%, 80%, at least 60, 70%. Unless. Unless I think most big funds in crypto didn't have the stomach to short the market. So assume that most of them are down. So if there continues to be pain in the broader markets, I would assume that there's going to be some redemptions from traditional investors that want to just chop this part of their portfolio, take the win, because, mind you, most investors say that you invested in a fund three years ago. Most funds of at least a year, lockup, you're still very much in profit, at least two, three, five, x.
01:03:33.554 - 01:03:54.334, Speaker B: Right. So if you get a lot of redemptions and these funds are down more for selling. Right. As soon as you get a reduction, you need to sell. So I think it's going to take, like, probably another, a couple of quarters for all for these systemic effects to kind of run their course. Right. A lot of the big funds in crypto might have to close shop.
01:03:54.334 - 01:04:47.550, Speaker B: You know, if markets continue to be really volatile, there might be another. You asked me this question, like, four episodes ago or something, which is when I said my prediction was some funds would just die. He said, are they going to explode, or are they just going, like, what's going to happen to them? And my thesis was, most of these funds will probably be so underwater that they close shop. Like, this is Melvin capital, for instance. That was on the wrong trade of, like, GameStop closed shop, because if you're down 80%, this happened. A lot of crypto funds in the prior cycle, like, you need to, like, go back to par, which means the asset needs to go up over 80% to, like, actually then make some profit on the carry. And if you're not doing that for a couple of years, like, you can't pay employees, sure, you're charging 2% management fee, but it's very difficult to contain or run operations.
01:04:47.550 - 01:05:40.998, Speaker B: And the perverse incentive is to just close shop and start a new one. If you can get more money, like. And so I think that some funds are going to die that will put some downward pressure on the market. And so that's why I think it's not probably going to be a v shaped recovery here. So on this particular point around the connectivity that 3 hours has and Celsius has on some of these other providers lenders, I see less risk there. And you tell me if you disagree, like, I don't think Genesis is going to die or is in a precarious position. Dervitt came out saying that they have an insurance fund and that there are some small accounts that are in debt, but nothing, like, truly systemic or that would put them in a, like, nothing that would be worrisome.
01:05:40.998 - 01:06:28.004, Speaker B: Again, we'll see if that's actually true. But a lot of these exchanges and providers have insurance funds. They made a lot of money over the years, some of which has been put into this kind of like, insurance pocket to potentially cover some bad debt of some players that might not be able to position, that might not be able to liquidate easily and cover the loss. And so I don't see a type of systemic Lehman, another Lehman bear stern situation. Like the, a lot of people doing the analogy over and like, literally global financial crisis for crypto, Luna Celsius now 3 hours and stuff like that. I don't think we're. I don't think there's that much more contagion other than like, continued downward pressure for the remainder of the year.
01:06:28.004 - 01:06:29.204, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:06:31.424 - 01:07:22.920, Speaker A: I mean, on three arrows, I mean, they're one of the biggest borrowers from every lender. Like, they are at many of the lenders. They're the biggest borrower from every single lender, whether it's blockfi, Genesis, Nexo, Celsius, every lender, I think takes a hit. But I don't think it really hurts any of the lenders too badly. Let's talk about tether, which I didn't want to actually bring up, but I've had more texts about tether from. I usually get texts about tether when things like this happen from the no coiner crowd and friends in banking who don't believe crypto is a real thing. I've had more texts about and messages about tether from, like, real crypto people, like crypto founders or investors or builders or whatever it may be, just being like, hey, like, are you watching some of this stuff? And some of the things people are texting about is like, you know, in times of fear, usually tether trades at a premium.
01:07:22.920 - 01:07:45.934, Speaker A: And now it's trading at a. Sometimes it's been trading at a discount. Like, not a huge discount, but slightly below a dollar, kind of, for the last couple of weeks, actually. I usually dismiss tether fud. Like, I just. I'm like, that's more tetherfud. Um, I've just been pinged a lot about it, and, like, risk is a factor of probability times, consequences.
01:07:45.934 - 01:07:51.834, Speaker A: Right. And the consequence here is so high that I think it's worth talking about, uh, just the probability.
01:07:52.334 - 01:08:21.124, Speaker B: Yeah. Uh, tether fud continues to come up time and time again, especially in these moments. Um, I've actually never gone through the flow of redeeming tether for dollars, uh, in their, whatever entity, Sam from Alameda. Like, Alameda's a big player. And I think at some point, there's a great thread on, um, this was, like, almost a year ago. Um, this slide came around, and Sam and some of the Alameda folks said, no, we actually, like, are pretty close to this. And we were able to easily swap usdt for dollars.
01:08:21.124 - 01:08:46.539, Speaker B: Uh, the latest, like, audit report. Like, of course, they have some exposure. Like, it's not, like, fully back 101. Like, meaning, like, the same with the USDC is right. They have, like, proof of reserves and whatnot, but they have some commercial paper and they have some exposure to others. Relatively low risk, short duration assets, but against some risk. I don't know.
01:08:46.539 - 01:09:15.637, Speaker B: I don't. I'm not an expert on this topic. I don't want to say that it's, like, bulletproof. If you ask me where I hold my money, it's stables, it's USDC. I just feel more comfortable holding us DC. And now, interestingly, today, USDC or senator came out saying that they were going to launch a euro stable coin, fully backed. So again, I just feel much more comfortable holding USDC.
01:09:15.637 - 01:09:21.250, Speaker B: But I don't want to come across as this skeptic. I don't want to. About you.
01:09:21.322 - 01:10:05.687, Speaker A: No, I don't know enough. Yeah, me too. So transparency is interesting, right? The benefit of DeFi is that one of the benefits of DeFi is that you've got this fully transparent system. What's happened, though, in this market is that in a down market, you can really see who's offsides and who's, like, basically overexposed themselves when everything is really transparent and on chain. So what happens when you can actually see this stuff is that a lot of the funds will go well, basically, like, the funds will and the trading desk will actually hunt down some of these positions, maybe push the price down to get these big positions liquidated, then they make money on the trade. When the forced liquidation goes through. A, I guess, does that actually happen? And b, is that a negative consequence of transparency?
01:10:05.855 - 01:10:59.234, Speaker B: Yeah, it's sort of like, I think a lot of people were really watching very closely the position of that big WBTC vault and Celsius, like, not fixing that collateral and other really large vaults. Because now that you see that, you can put a lot of, like some actor can try to like liquidate that and push the price down. It takes, it takes a lot of capital to do that. But, yeah, it's an interesting question when they're so transparent, I guess. I think certainly more transparent than tradfi. But, you know, you can shorts, you can create short squeeze, you can look, DeFi is very adversarial with transparency. You have the possibility to, when everyone knows your position and your price, you get liquidated or mechanism flaws and like, like USD.
01:10:59.234 - 01:11:48.626, Speaker B: Right? Then you can attack it, you can, you can take it, you can arbit, it's basically an arbitrage. Like you could call it on the tag, you can call it whatever, but it's, it's an art form of arbitrage. The hope is that over time, like these systems, these vulnerabilities, or I will call them inefficiencies, not vulnerabilities, but inefficiencies in these systems, meaning mispricing of assets like these arbitrage possibilities get armed out faster and faster and faster. So you build more robust protocols. But, you know, I like to, I like to like zoom out for a minute and say, look, the amount of liquidations that have happened on AAVE and compound have been orderly. DeFi continues to work. There are no bailouts in the aggregate.
01:11:48.626 - 01:12:24.948, Speaker B: In the whole, like, at the individual level. Yeah, it's not fun if you, if people know that they can liquidate you at 1000 ETH and ETH is at 1100, and someone might say, hey, you know what, I don't like Yano. I want to liquidate him. I'm going to try to push the price down, I guess, like, we all know where these prices are. But again, like, it's harder and harder. It's pretty hard to like manipulate the market, like push the price down this much and make money out of that. But I still, I'm more encouraged now on Defi, more and more.
01:12:24.948 - 01:13:01.734, Speaker B: I mean, the, the way that we've seen these assets move pretty violently and liquidations happen, like, was just telling you, like, this is a very adversarial system, but it's also anti fragile in the sense of, like, it has been able to withstand the chaos in the market in a very orderly way. It continues to function. And you have a lot of certainty when you use truly what I call defi protocols, like Alban compound. Like, I feel very comfortable, like depositing my money in these. Not an endorsement because I know where my. But again, personally, I use these platforms because it's better than Celsius.
01:13:02.434 - 01:13:22.474, Speaker A: Things are cascading down. It feels really, really bad right now. Um, stress has been kind of recursive across the ecosystem. Price crash equals layoffs and hiring freezes. Speculators with leverage are now underwater. Lenders are in trouble with those speculators. Uh, retail users who deposited with lenders they want out there is for selling across the industry.
01:13:23.694 - 01:13:34.582, Speaker B: Just be patient. Like, don't. Don't chase the market. Let the market come to you. I wanted to hold cash to buy pain. I haven't seen true, true pain.
01:13:34.678 - 01:13:35.982, Speaker A: What is true pain?
01:13:36.118 - 01:13:58.674, Speaker B: I want to see a forged seller. I want to see a bull, a perma bull be chopped and just have to sell because he's being liquidated or he has redemptions or something. And when I see that and I track wallets and I'm looking at this stuff, and when I see someone sell forcefully, that's when I'll hit the bid. I'll lift that.
01:13:58.974 - 01:14:24.274, Speaker A: Six weeks ago, you said, I said, are you buying? You said, I'm waiting for Max Payne. I am waiting for Max Payne to start buying. And I said, what is Max Payne? And you said, when giga longs or perma bulls are forced to sell. And that's what we're seeing now. I was like, okay, sure, sure, we won't buy yet. And sure enough, this week we have perma bulls who are being forced to sell. Is this rock bottom?
01:14:27.734 - 01:14:57.680, Speaker B: Probably not. Again, I think probabilistically, I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm not buying yet for the reason that I think this is probably going to take much longer to play out. Both specific to crypto, meaning funds having to sell. We need to get more clarity and resolution on celsius on 3 hours on derivate. That's one component. The other is just macro.
01:14:57.680 - 01:15:39.618, Speaker B: I think it's getting. There's a number of things that I'm watching closely. Food prices, this kind of, you know, how other central banks respond to what the US is doing. The situation in Japan feels like might be the first big country, developed nation where modern monetary theory collapses. And that, to me, is something that I think I want to talk about more in a later episode. I want to bring more people to talk about this because, you know, Japan's been pretty like that. Japan has twice a level of government debt to GDP than the US, and the US is pretty bad, I think.
01:15:39.618 - 01:16:18.644, Speaker B: And Japan is twice that level. And if Japan fails, and then it kind of really puts into question like this, like, Chicago school, modern monetary theory and saying, wait a minute, can you actually, can central banks actually get away with, like, this printing? And I think it's very, if that happens, then it's gonna really kind of. I don't know what that means for the US. I don't know what that means for the euro. I don't. And so I think, like, that's what I'm looking at. And I'm very cognizant of the, this idea that I haven't invested through rising rates.
01:16:18.644 - 01:16:30.038, Speaker B: I want to be, I don't, I don't feel compelled to do anything other than, like, hold cash. Like, yeah, okay, I'm being inflated out, but, like, at least I'm not, like, losing 80%, right.
01:16:30.086 - 01:16:34.074, Speaker A: Cash is the best thing. Funny enough. Cash is the best thing to hold in this inflationary period.
01:16:34.814 - 01:17:16.168, Speaker B: Like, I, I feel, I feel like there's probably, like 20, 30% downside here on crypto. I would feel more comfortable at that level. I don't know. I talked to a lot of other funds, some of which are in a position of strength, some of which have, like, started, like, dollar cost averaging. You know, I'm not a short term trader. I like to, I like to remind myself what I think I'm good at, which is early stage investing, and I will continue to do that. I just this week talked to three teams, really smart guys that want to build in crypto.
01:17:16.168 - 01:17:49.954, Speaker B: Three, like, literally a founder that has exited two times, three founders, all of what have exited don't have to work a day in their life. They want to build in crypto. And so as long as that continues to be true, I'm very encouraged by that. And I want to make sure that I can continue to invest these teams and my current teams. I'm also, you know, again, the other flip side of this. I don't mean to come across as super bearish, but, you know, the merge is coming. That's very, I think, as I would agree with Travis, it is the most important, I think, event in crypto, full stop.
01:17:49.954 - 01:18:09.886, Speaker B: And I think the implications for ETH are pretty important. And so that, to me, feels like it's going to happen in the next coming months, two, three months, August, September, the merge will happen. I think it's already been tested, so it's very encouraging, and that's a very positive setup for ETH.
01:18:09.990 - 01:18:45.916, Speaker A: I have a question for you. Do you try to buy on the down? So, like, are you going to try to time the market on the downside and almost risk catching a falling knife, or do you wait for, I had that thread about stage one, stage two, stage three. Stage two is like a shit ton of fear and like fear in the market. Stage three is basically just boredom and consolidation and like a period of quietness. Do you wait on the downside and you wait for like the craziest days, like maybe the day where it seems like three arrows might be collapsing, or do you wait for post consolidation quietness? Maybe you don't hit the bottom perfectly, but you get it five or 10% off the bottom. What, what's your strategy when you try to time these markets?
01:18:46.020 - 01:19:19.014, Speaker B: Ooh, yeah, great question. I don't try to tick top the bottom, absolute bottom, but I would ascribe more to what you just said, which is when it's quiet and despair and everyone kind of doesn't even want to talk about ETH. It's like, it's like the, it's too painful to even talk about. It's like Voldemort. It's like he who must not be named right. When, when ethics, when crypto categorically is that asset class that no one wants to talk about, then I would feel more comfortable. But I don't know how I'm going to play it.
01:19:19.014 - 01:19:59.354, Speaker B: Let me frame it this way. If I were to raise a fund right now, today, if you gave me $100 million, 200, a billion dollars, and I have at least a year of what capital for two years, then yeah. This, I think, a pretty interesting entry point across these assets. Pretty, pretty interesting entry point. If you have a longer than one year horizon, which I do, then this is, in my estimation, a pretty compelling entry point. And, but I wouldn't buy like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't immediately like, deploy all of it. I would scale it.
01:19:59.354 - 01:20:23.330, Speaker B: And the best strategy that I've always employed since I first discovered the sales I buy every day, and I don't have to think about timing the market, I just know that this kind of do that. But over a long term, with two, three, 4510 years, I continue to believe we're going to have the possibility and we're going to see ETH at a thousand or less than that and a 10,000 over the next two, three years. And so that's a 10th.
01:20:23.362 - 01:20:36.106, Speaker A: That was my strategy in 2018, 2019. That just worked well, was I tried to turn off my brain and I just had a dollar cost. Every time I paycheck it, every, every two weeks, it was I day just had a dollar cost average into bitcoin.
01:20:36.170 - 01:21:00.350, Speaker B: And you probably outperformed 99% of funds and then get liquidated and built. Block works. You know what I mean? So, like, at this point, as my philosophy has always been, I want to minimize all kinds of distractions in my brain. Time trying to time market is a distraction from. For me, I'm not a trader. I want to think about other things. I want to be able to do other things, maybe build.
01:21:00.350 - 01:21:30.250, Speaker B: And so I don't want to be sitting in front of a computer, like, looking at charts and ta and all this crap, which I don't know. I've never met anyone that can systematically time markets. But I do know that this is, to me, the best trade that I can make. Like, this movement is the most important thing that will probably happen in my life. And I think we're so goddamn early to that, that in spite of all this chaos will come out of it stronger. The things that will survive. And I have a short list of things that I think will survive.
01:21:30.250 - 01:21:44.114, Speaker B: I'm very compelled to buy and. And I'll scale in what's on I want it. Certainly. And look, none of this financial advice, folks. Again, I'll continue to say this over.
01:21:44.154 - 01:21:48.474, Speaker A: You've got the disclaimer. Legally, we're good.
01:21:48.634 - 01:21:51.110, Speaker B: I can't. For Jimmy, like a paraphy, like I was.
01:21:51.222 - 01:21:51.966, Speaker A: You're going to get clipped.
01:21:51.990 - 01:21:52.166, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:21:52.190 - 01:21:57.550, Speaker A: Someone's going to clip this and be like, financial advice. And I bought ETH, and it's down below a thousand now.
01:21:57.702 - 01:22:18.928, Speaker B: I know, I know. That's why I do this. Look, every situation is different. I can't give advice. Every has a different liquidity position. But in my shortlist is ETH, bitcoin, some blue chip defi assets, and. And some.
01:22:18.928 - 01:22:46.724, Speaker B: Some games out there. A lot of them, like, on the private side. But, like, again, if I. If I were to deploy from scratch, it would be mostly ETH, because, a, it's very liquid. I don't move the market I can use. It's very pristine collateral, and so is bitcoin. And in this market, I think you're seeing, you have seen, you'll continue to see a rotation flight to quality once things kind of normalize.
01:22:46.724 - 01:23:37.262, Speaker B: It's still flight to quality, meaning ETH and bitcoin. And I'm not as compelled to like invest in part upper layers of the stack just yet, which are like a levered bet on ethereum, for instance, or like another l one. I feel really strongly about ETH right now. Like, honestly, like 80% of my assets would be like, like I would say like 60% ETH, 20% bitcoin, and the rest like a small basket of other pretty interesting, like DeFi protocols like maker compound aave that have like, like money markets are pretty compelling or pretty killer use cases. So I'd kind of do that. And this is, and this is removing the illiquid stuff, which I don't love. And I do mostly, you know, I'm just talking about public stuff here.
01:23:37.358 - 01:24:18.940, Speaker A: If you have, um. So I think there's probably a lot of folks who are sitting maybe in a similar position as me, which is you bought a bunch, you've got your core position in crypto, which might be like blue chip defi, maybe a bunch of ETH, a bunch of bitcoin, and then you've kind of got this like long tail. Like the rest of the 10% of your portfolio is like you got half percent allocated to, like this random thing. You got half percent and you're down 90% on some of these tokens. Do you shed those tokens? Do you shed, do you basically just sell them off, take the loss for tax harvesting? Or do you sit on them? Or obviously you have to reevaluate your thesis on all of them, but let's say you don't like some of them. Do you sell them at what feels like the lows or do you just hold on?
01:24:19.092 - 01:25:09.574, Speaker B: Well, that's a very broad based question. I think you need to constantly ask yourself, like, is this project building meaningful utility? And further, is this valuation warranted? Yeah, it's a difficult question to ask just broadly, but look, can an asset that's down 80% go down another 50%? Yeah, absolutely. But if you have conviction, then it just depends. I think it just depends how closely. Sometimes when you have this, like, it's weird how the brain works, because a lot of times we end up spending disproportionate amount of time in these small positions that we want to work. And we feel like we're holding that like, like doge bag that might like, you know, randomly, like, you know.
01:25:10.834 - 01:25:13.746, Speaker A: No, but Drucken said he's like, sizing is 80% of this.
01:25:13.770 - 01:25:41.138, Speaker B: Sizing is 80%, 100%, like portfolio construction. And I think he said something really interesting in that episode, which is when you're right and you're not always right, and you have to assume that you're never, for the most part, not going to be right. But when you're right, you feel you're in a hot streak, or you feel you're right, you want to be extremely right, and you want to pile on that. For me, it was, you know, paraphy I was in before. Paraphrase is very right on defi. I was using it. I was close to synthetics.
01:25:41.138 - 01:25:58.996, Speaker B: I was observing maker, and I just. I was. I was lucky that I was using it and close to some teams, and. And to me, it felt like it was like we. I really kind of, like, went in on that, but it took time. It took time. I think I was just, like, mostly, like, observing.
01:25:58.996 - 01:26:23.688, Speaker B: I was sitting on ETH, and then I said, oh, and I was using Ethan, like, using maker with my ETH and, like. But sometimes, yeah, you're right. Like, we tend to spend. I think I would, as an investor, I would just think about how much energy and time are you spending on these small positions, and are they actually going to move the needle? And some look, some can. What is a one. We've all seen it, right? This is a temptation. A 1% in your.
01:26:23.688 - 01:26:51.644, Speaker B: But still a 1% position in your portfolio can be. Can grow to 20, 30%. Like, I'll give an example. Like, I sized Aave pretty small the portfolio initially, and then it became, like, what was, like a 2% position? I think every position should be at least 1% of your portfolio. If you don't have the conviction to size a position to 1%, then probably means, like, a, you don't understand it enough. B, it's just, like, not. Not even worth it.
01:26:51.644 - 01:27:07.600, Speaker B: But if I would always, like, size at least 1% of your portfolio, and we feel comfortable because you're gonna have to spend time on that. And so, thematically, obviously. Yeah. So, like, if you're not gonna put at least 1% of your. Of your bulk on it, don't even bother.
01:27:07.672 - 01:27:26.732, Speaker A: Like, I think most new folks coming into crypto do is they basically throw, like, a. Well, whatever the amount. Amount is of that they do, 1000 or 10,000 would make up the number, like, $100, the same amount into, like, 20 different positions. Whereas, in reality, you should probably size that down to, like, five to eight positions and adjust based on your thesis on them.
01:27:26.868 - 01:27:28.224, Speaker B: But, yeah.
01:27:28.844 - 01:27:51.496, Speaker A: Uh, I have a qu. I have a question for you, which is we, in 2017, the market hit 830 billion market cap. We're down to 904 today. So what's the math on that 12%? If we fall another ten, do you think we fall another 12% and hit the peak of the 2017 market?
01:27:51.640 - 01:28:21.634, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like, I think we're going to look back on this moment in history and say, yeah, gosh, it was, it was really tough, really tough situation for every investor out there that is inherently long. And most investors are, are taking a huge pain. And I think we were look back and say, yeah, kind of. What were we thinking? Like, it's sort of, and I don't want to come across as facetious or like, oh, I was right because I I'm down a lot, folks.
01:28:21.634 - 01:28:47.320, Speaker B: Like, I'm, I'm long. This asset class, I'm not shorting. I went to cash. For me, it's just I'm in a defensive position now, but I'm still, most of my book is net long, like, and so I want to just kind of, like, preface that. But I think we're going to look back and say, yeah, like, it was rising rates. You're coming off of this huge period of money printing. You have COVID that hasn't gone away.
01:28:47.320 - 01:29:18.004, Speaker B: You have the situation in Ukraine. You have food prices, rising food prices. You have energy. Like, a lot of these things are coming together all at once. Crypto continues to be a speck of dust. It is an asset class continues, increasingly recognizes as a really interesting asset class, but investors don't act rationally and they chop these positions. And so I really like this.
01:29:18.004 - 01:29:58.542, Speaker B: Like, there's this episode and invest like the best. And one guy is reflecting on what happened in 2008 and said, what happened then was a lot of investors brace for impact. And every investor there comes a time where, like, the more sophisticated part of your brain, human, higher cognitive process shuts out and says it becomes super primitive. And you literally are just the primitive l one brain, reptilian brain says, I want to just survive. I think everyone has been hitting that right now. And when that happens, people go to cash because they want to survive. But very quickly, people hate sitting on cash.
01:29:58.542 - 01:30:21.108, Speaker B: Right? People hate sitting on cash. You want to deploy that inherently. People need to deploy that. Managers need to deploy that. And so I think I will, I continue to believe that there will come a time where most people after, I feel like we're in this process where, like, there's still a lot of moving pieces. People don't understand them. Even Stan said this right in his interview.
01:30:21.108 - 01:30:58.700, Speaker B: Like, I felt that he was just observing meaning probably hold neutral to maybe slightly bearish. But once we get more resolution, and I think this will take some time, a quarter or two, to get the Q. Like QE, the Q two earning numbers from a lot of general stock market. Then I think once it kind of dust starts settling, we have some still stability, whether that may be maybe one or two weeks of just kind of the market kind of the amplitude of these market movements. Are you seeing the Nasdaq and, like, the market, like, everything in the. Everything. The stock market today in the US was down at least 3%.
01:30:58.700 - 01:31:13.544, Speaker B: Like, that is. That's pretty brutal. Like, I think, like, that's a one or two. That's a one or two sigma event. Like, that's pretty bad. More value got wiped in the market today than the entire market cap. Of course, crypto, like, multiples of what crypto is worth.
01:31:13.544 - 01:31:52.384, Speaker B: Like, just put that in perspective. But I think, like, going back to your original question, I think I'll start feeling more comfortable scaling into the market more aggressively when I see to your point on stage three, which is things are still kind of negative, but stabilizing. Seeing a 3% move in the market. Like, I just kind of. Kind of want to. Want to wait a bit for people to kind of understand the magnitude and process a lot of information that is coming out. And I think there will probably be, I don't know, a three to nine month window where you'll be able to actually, like, really, really go hard at things that you like.
01:31:52.384 - 01:32:27.224, Speaker B: And right now, I think we're entering that, but we're not there, there yet. Like, in 2018, 2019, like, you could you have pretty much, like, full six months to be able to scale aggressively in Ethan Defi. Right. And still make a fantastic return. Like, when compound launched their liquidity mining rewards, that kind of really triggered and catalyzed, like, the whole defi summer. You could have invested a lot of money there. And in the subsequent weeks when there was a lot of interest, and you would have caught Wi Fi, you would have caught this entire wave.
01:32:27.224 - 01:33:05.942, Speaker B: Right? Even nfts. Which talks about what Stan, again, we keep going back to saying this is a genius, which is, you don't have to time it exactly there, but you. But being willing to really put more money to work in things that you see conviction in and constantly process that information. And I think the market's going to allow us to, like, scale into trades that are going to be pretty. Pretty, like, pretty meaningful return drivers in your portfolio. And I think we're going to have that ability to do that over the next. Like, three to nine months.
01:33:06.118 - 01:33:07.358, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I agree.
01:33:07.446 - 01:33:07.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:33:07.702 - 01:33:39.916, Speaker A: We're seeing all the signs of the bottom in my mind. The three arrows thing, the Celsius thing. You have layoffs across the board, right? Bitso 10% Gemini 10% Coinbase 18% block 520 percent Bitmex 25% there are some more big ones that haven't been publicly announced yet. Smaller projects are shutting down. Like, shout out Jai, who's just an amazing builder. But I think shutting down the tribe or shutting down Rory capital, you have, like, down rounds are starting to quietly happen. But you.
01:33:39.916 - 01:33:59.664, Speaker A: This doesn't feel like, this feel doesn't feel like the time to buy in my mind as well. I agree with you because you haven't seen the period of quiet. Right. It's just like, trust your gut here. And does this really feel like you could have a bull market come out of this period? No, it doesn't. Like, people are freaking exhausted. People are wiped, and the market still, I don't know, it just feels like a bad.
01:33:59.664 - 01:34:13.952, Speaker A: Yeah, still feels like a bad time. And we also haven't seen that stage three of boredom. We haven't seen that. Just like that period of when your friends. Now, now my friends are texting me, hey, are you okay? We need a period of your friends forgetting that I even. That crypto even exists.
01:34:14.088 - 01:34:14.856, Speaker B: Right, right.
01:34:14.920 - 01:34:18.266, Speaker A: That's. That's when you buy. So, yeah, agreed.
01:34:18.400 - 01:35:00.688, Speaker B: I think at some point, like a lot of these pension funds, a lot of these venture funds are going to wake up and say, wow, we're pretty down. How do we make up and where do we invest again in the next? Look, I love technology. Technology is what gets humanity out of trouble. Other than biotech, crypto is the most exciting piece of technology for our generation. And you're going to want to, want to belong this asset class over the next ten years. Like, like, I think every major investor is going to belong this asset class because it is the next arc of the Internet. We don't have to regurgitate these thesis, but I think people understand that right now is in survival mode.
01:35:00.688 - 01:35:38.474, Speaker B: And so, folks, take care. Don't use leverage. Don't do anything crazy. If you're using centralized institutions, banks that have a lot of exposure to crypto providers have a lot of exposure to crypto. Be wary of that. Use the Horcrux model, which is separate your assets in multiple wallets, different providers. Again, central, the overarching theme, macro theme, like mega Trend has been now, I think increasingly, hopefully, people understand, centralized institutions have been failing us over the last 20, 30, 40 years with COVID health organizations terribly underprepared.
01:35:38.474 - 01:36:23.554, Speaker B: Central banks and banks in 2008, both Celsius Terra, I would describe as centralized because it was not very transparent. And like, a lot of the activity there was being operated by LFG and centralized institution. The idea to collateralize and all of it was kind of centralized. And so be very skeptical of centralized institutions, people that can't provide you very straightforward answers of where your assets are, of how they're being used. Like, I think, you know, I'm not, like, you know, don't put your, like, tinfoil hat on here, but, like, be very practical and expect very straightforward answers, especially moments like this. And if you can't get a straightforward answer from whoever, then, you know, dig deeper.
01:36:23.854 - 01:36:30.126, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Nfts will go into their. Into their first ever bear market.
01:36:30.230 - 01:36:30.488, Speaker B: People.
01:36:30.526 - 01:36:51.492, Speaker A: People will get skeptical about daos. Remember what we're actually building here. Uh, remember that this is just a bear market and that things return. Uh, there are some friends who have come into crypto, and this is maybe their first bear market, and, uh, they're freaking out over open sea volumes, right? Open sea volumes used to be, like two to 3 billion a month. This month, it's less than 500 million. Right. There's a massive.
01:36:51.492 - 01:37:06.144, Speaker A: It basically looks like it falls off a cliff. That'll keep happening. Most of these nfts will go to zero or they'll fall 97%. Right. Uh, dows, people will say daos shouldn't exist, or like that. You know, we all had, we had it wrong with daos. Zoom out.
01:37:06.144 - 01:37:30.002, Speaker A: Long term game. Uh, recreating the financial system and just building an open, permissionless world takes decades. It doesn't take years. So. And I will just add that bear markets reward people who are curious enough to use new products, uh, to use crypto native products, without the need for massive apys and without the. A financial incentive there. And anyone who played around with Defi in 2018, 2019, you will get rewarded.
01:37:30.002 - 01:37:33.250, Speaker A: It's just not as clear. So follow your curiosity in the bear market.
01:37:33.442 - 01:38:11.044, Speaker B: I'll leave you one anecdote here, because for me, it's been very interesting to be out here in Africa. And I was talking to one of the safari guides, and he was asking me about what I did, and I was trying to explain to him, and I asked him a question. I said, you want to buy a car? You want to buy a house? Do you have access to credit? He said, it's kind of difficult. Yes, because I have, like, a steady job. I've had it for three years, and the company that I'm employed is very reputable here in this country, and they like it. I said, okay, what kind of interest do you get charged? What are the. What are the terms? He said, 40%.
01:38:11.044 - 01:38:29.676, Speaker B: 40%? I'm like, okay, well, that's illegal in many other places. And. But I said, imagine a world where you can. I can look at a lot of the data. So he had a smartphone. They said, how long have you had that smartphone for? He said, oh, I've had it for, like, four years. So do you pay your bill? Do you have a plan? He said, yeah.
01:38:29.676 - 01:38:52.088, Speaker B: Do you pay that every month? He said, yeah, I've never missed a payment. I said, okay, great. What if I told you that I could use that data and other pieces of data in your smartphone, in your interactions, and build a credit profile for you and lend to you at, like, 15, 20%? And he literally hounded me the rest of the trip. He's like, when can I. Like, how. Like, I'm really. And so, to me, that's.
01:38:52.088 - 01:39:26.594, Speaker B: That's the bright side of this stuff. And look, these narratives, the banking beyond bank narrative has been pushed to extremes, but credibly. I do believe that we're going to reach a point where, like, again, I like to remind myself of, like, this is, like, the. The practical business sense is the Bezos mentality, which is your margin, is my opportunity. You know, mean, like, there is so much potential here, and the only thing that we need to do is make technology relatable for people. If I were to start to talk to this guy about, like, decentralization and all this crap, you listen, man.
01:39:26.714 - 01:39:30.174, Speaker A: No, no, we're just building better. Yeah, we're just a better product.
01:39:31.154 - 01:39:41.652, Speaker B: I'm not a. I'm not a. I love punks, but I'm not a crypto, like a. An anarchist, if you will. We need to be really practical, and we need. And. But again, technology is relatable.
01:39:41.652 - 01:40:24.982, Speaker B: Increasingly, crypto is very relatable to people. Nfts are very relatable to artists that want to, you know, connect with their audiences. Whether you're a musician or a painter or whatever, like, that idea is not going to go away. And Defi, in my mind, has been largely neglected, but it's giving you every crisis, every major, like, violent move in the market, and you're absorbing these. That gives you a lot of lindian confidence. So, yeah, look, the more important thing is, hopefully, this is people, the takeaways for this episode is not what to do specifically. None of this is, like, I don't want to be prescriptive, but it's more so, like, there's been a lot of failures.
01:40:24.982 - 01:41:02.974, Speaker B: There probably continue to be a lot of failures. Observe that, learn from that. And I think that makes you a better investor, makes you a better builder. And so, yeah, you know, you know, I think a lot of people have been in pain, but I wanted to ask you, like, you're obviously building blockworks. Like, how are you managing your team? One, are you hiring? Like, how are you as a builder? We talked about a lot of, like, my, like, as an investor, but, like, there's a lot of builders out there. How are you thinking about this market and the decisions, if any, that you wanted to take? Has that changed?
01:41:03.634 - 01:41:27.206, Speaker A: I think we're in a really unique position with blockworks because we've never raised a dime of venture capital money. We focused on getting profitable from day one of the business. And so we've run a very different kind of crypto business than most folks. Right. We've been profitable for four years. Um, we've were bootstrapped. We just launched this research product a couple of weeks ago that's going really, really, really well.
01:41:27.206 - 01:41:45.238, Speaker A: And we've got a. Just a really strong, sturdy business. Like, we're not trying to find product market fit. We didn't go raise 50 mil and, like, have a massive burn. And so I think we're in a little different position than most crypto companies out there. So because of that, yeah, we are still hiring, actually, when most folks are laying off people, we are still hiring. I think, though, that.
01:41:45.238 - 01:42:01.070, Speaker A: I think, though, Santi, I. I'm in the same position as you right now. Like, Mike and I are basically feel like we're in kind of, like, wait and see mode, right? We're capturing market share. We're excited. We're still talking to folks to bring people on board. We've got open positions, but we're. But we're also just.
01:42:01.070 - 01:42:19.900, Speaker A: You don't want to make any rushed decisions in this kind of market. And so we're kind of in, like, all right, slow things down. We told everyone at the company, like, if you're. If it's 05:00 p.m. You're debating, like, whether you should jump on another call, you should send that email, or, like, go for a walk. Go for the walk. Close your computer, zoom out, take a breath of fresh air.
01:42:19.900 - 01:42:31.344, Speaker A: There's going to be another bull market at some point. We're going to race to capture market share in this period. Just slow things down for a couple of weeks. That's what we're doing right now.
01:42:31.804 - 01:42:42.514, Speaker B: Yeah. Again, I didn't plan the strip thinking the market was going to crash, but it's been a welcome, really, for me to just be close with my parents, thinking and observing everything that's going on.
01:42:42.604 - 01:42:43.118, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:42:43.246 - 01:42:57.974, Speaker B: And again, I said this when we were talking for this episode, which is, I think, as a. As a builder, as an investor, these are the moments that really define what you do. And it's very encouraging. Like, I feel very alive right now. Me, too.
01:42:58.054 - 01:43:17.296, Speaker A: Me, too. This is what I talked to Mike about this week. These are the periods that define who's a good leader, who's not a good leader, what's a good company, what's not a good company? And thankfully, we've done this right. We built through the bear market. We launched blockworks December of 2017. So the first two years of the company were just building in a bear. So we like these periods.
01:43:17.296 - 01:43:43.394, Speaker A: So, Santi, you missed episode 100. This is technically episode. I think it's like 102, but it has been a joy hosting empire with you. It is not easy sometimes showing up day in and day out when there are so much going on. Crypto is so crazy. There are a million other things we could doing, and yet we still show up at least two times a week, sometimes three. Sometimes I force you to do a fourth episode at the height of the bull market.
01:43:43.394 - 01:43:54.582, Speaker A: And, yeah, man, I just want to say it's been an absolute pleasure hosting empire, and I'm looking forward to another building this through the bear market. And I also appreciate everyone for listening to this.
01:43:54.678 - 01:44:39.998, Speaker B: Absolutely. Look, it's been one of the best things that I'm doing right now, and especially now, I think people, we have a true ability here, and hopefully this is useful to people. And if there's anything else you want to hear, but, yeah, no, this is honestly, at this point, the biggest impact that I think I can have in crypto is just connecting with people through this podcast. Hopefully, this is useful for people, and we'll continue to do this. No matter what the price, market cap, and market conditions, we're going to continue to show up and we're going to continue to deliver this weekly roundup and also bring in super smart builders, investors to share their perspective. And hopefully, this forum is useful to people to navigate. Bull, bear, crab, and all other kinds of market conditions will be here and delivering quality insights to you guys.
