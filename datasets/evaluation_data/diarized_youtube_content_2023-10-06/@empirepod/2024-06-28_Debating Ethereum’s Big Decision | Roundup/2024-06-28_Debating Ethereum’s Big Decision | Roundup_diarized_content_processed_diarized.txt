00:00:00.400 - 00:00:20.726, Speaker A: We've been really, in ethereum land, myopically focused on the hardware requirements for the validators. And so we just keep unbundling things that validators have historically done and saying, hey, we can have our cake and eat it too. We're still decentralized. Look at how many validators we have. Look at how low the hardware requirements are. But then we just keep giving more and more things to relays and builders. Hey yeah, this network is super decentralized.
00:00:20.726 - 00:00:28.380, Speaker A: We've got hundreds of thousands of validators, but we've got three builders that build all the blocks, right? At some point that has to be a factor.
00:00:28.720 - 00:01:13.196, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by say Se's v two upgrade introduces the first high performance parallelized EVM already live on public Devnet mainnet comes later in Q two. You can follow along with the SaI journey on Xe network. Say is spelled S e I go follow say on x say network. Hey everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of Empire Marinade. Marinade is a staking protocol on Solana, Lana and the only stake pool that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards and automatic downside protection with their new protected staking rewards. Optimize your sole stake with Marinade by hitting the link in the show notes. Big thanks to Marinade.
00:01:13.196 - 00:01:46.960, Speaker B: We'll talk more about them later in the show. Everyone, the Polygon Community grants program was launched with 1 billion tokens, all for Polygon builders. Really excited to share that on today's episode of Empire. Season one of the Polygon Community grants program is now live. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon projects. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon technology grants. Big thanks to Polygon for sponsoring Empire.
00:01:46.960 - 00:02:17.684, Speaker B: Mantel LSP is a permissionless and non custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum and governed by Mantle. Mantle restakes 100,000 me to generate massive eigen layer points every day. Basically your chance at being part of the eigen that will be given out to meth holders on mantles l two. You can check it out. Meath thats m e t h mantle XYz campaigns. Thats a mouthful. We'll put a link in the show notes for you to check out and learn more.
00:02:17.684 - 00:02:40.420, Speaker B: Big thanks to mantle. All right, what's up everyone? We are back with the roundup. We got a whole squad today. YouTube comments clearly or not enjoying Santa and me. So we brought on Mark, new research analyst at Blockworks Research. Came over from coin shares, and then founder number two, my lesser half, mister Michael.
00:02:41.680 - 00:02:51.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually Jason and I actually played a game of ping pong for the rights to founder number one and your boys founder number one, so I.
00:02:51.320 - 00:02:57.380, Speaker B: Didn'T know it was the only sport mike is good at. It happens to be ping pong guy was JV his senior year, but, yeah.
00:02:58.600 - 00:03:01.984, Speaker C: Well, none of you guys are good at weightlifting, unlike me, but, yeah, sure.
00:03:02.112 - 00:03:03.584, Speaker B: Santi has the lifting. Ben.
00:03:03.712 - 00:03:04.688, Speaker C: Fucking cranking.
00:03:04.784 - 00:03:05.040, Speaker B: Great.
00:03:05.080 - 00:03:13.312, Speaker C: More creatine, less lifting. But, yeah, I just came back from a five hour bike ride and I'm absolutely cooked, so I'll let you guys talk while I figure out Mark's.
00:03:13.336 - 00:03:15.888, Speaker B: Like, I thought we were talking about some intellectual conversation.
00:03:15.984 - 00:03:25.446, Speaker C: No, we never do. We never do, by the way. I mean, none of this is legal or intellectual discussion, as people already know. So if you're listening, then you probably are going to be dumbed down in this conversation.
00:03:25.558 - 00:03:39.090, Speaker B: Yeah. So we got to start with the YouTube comments. Zero. Zero X. Alex said Yano looks like he's about to launch a vampire attack on Santi. So that was not super kind. I don't know if they're commenting on my.
00:03:39.470 - 00:03:41.094, Speaker C: I don't even know what that actually means.
00:03:41.142 - 00:03:42.070, Speaker A: What does that even mean?
00:03:42.150 - 00:03:46.502, Speaker C: I don't even want to explore it or entertain it, but please elaborate, sir.
00:03:46.606 - 00:04:00.194, Speaker B: Santi gonna blow a disc in his back trying to show his. Show his dog when he should have Jason match his runtime. Oh, yeah, no, I'm not gonna do that. Mmm. Yeah, these are. We got some kind comments. We got some kind.
00:04:00.194 - 00:04:05.594, Speaker B: Oh, I guess you got to get a better mic, Santi. Yeah, that's it.
00:04:05.642 - 00:04:07.202, Speaker C: This is better testing.
00:04:07.266 - 00:04:11.866, Speaker B: Better gobble the mic. All right, Mark, how you.
00:04:12.018 - 00:04:16.186, Speaker A: I think they were calling you pale. You know they are calling pale. That's the. Yeah, yeah.
00:04:16.218 - 00:04:23.380, Speaker D: Loki. I didn't want to say that, but, yeah, that's what I was thinking. Not from how it looks from the comments.
00:04:24.800 - 00:04:29.900, Speaker B: Mark, I'm glad you already feel comfortable enough at black works. I'm glad that you're glad you're enjoying it.
00:04:30.400 - 00:04:39.032, Speaker C: Mark, is this your first and last appearance at Empire? You will lose all access to email upon reporting.
00:04:39.136 - 00:04:43.416, Speaker B: Mark's, like, kicked off of slack. That's weird. My slack just got shut down.
00:04:43.528 - 00:04:44.620, Speaker D: Oh, with it.
00:04:47.220 - 00:05:02.600, Speaker B: Santia, I saw you just invested in mega eth. Mega eth just had their. Announced their fundraise. It seems like Eth, but fast chain eth. What is. Tell us about why Mega Eth is so freaking hyped in the last couple of months.
00:05:04.660 - 00:05:33.084, Speaker C: Look, I was talking to teams that are very opinionated. In the first five minutes of a conversation with these guys, they were like, we want to push the limits. We're going to run a centralized sequencer and run it hard so we can get the most performance out of the UVM. I'm like, great. And so you either like that or you don't. But the fact that they're very opinionated about that, I like, and it's something that I've been thinking about. Like, I also had a conversation with, like, Logan and shout out to the frictionless guys.
00:05:33.084 - 00:05:53.768, Speaker C: He's obviously very bullish on Solana, like, next gen high throughput chains. And he's like, we were talking about, like, if you were to re architect or do something with the EVM, like, how would you do it? And he was describing this. I'm like, you're basically describing Mega eth. And he's like, oh, interesting. And so then he went out and talked to them. And so that's how I see it. And it's a great team.
00:05:53.768 - 00:06:24.020, Speaker C: They're cooking hard. I went out to Berlin to meet their batch of, like, first set of, first cohort of projects that are building on top of mega. I would invest in, like, I think there were eight teams. I would invest, like seven out of the eight. Yeah, super impressive. So, yeah, quite excited, Mike, we're going to have them on the pod so people can learn more about it in the next couple of weeks.
00:06:24.180 - 00:06:27.200, Speaker B: Yeah. Mike, what do you think of the mega eth?
00:06:27.940 - 00:07:16.062, Speaker A: I like mega ETH because it just makes a lot of sense to me from like, the trade off that Ethereum made is we're going to have a, you know, pretty slow, relatively non performant main chain, but we're going to push a bunch of people up to roll ups. And I think that Ethereum can and should basically push the limits up there. That's the whole point of roll ups. So, yeah, I really like it. I think the other reason I kind of like it is it's accelerating to the end game of where roll ups are going. Roll ups are competing on cost and speed and performance and all of the stuff that mega eth is leaning into super hard. So it's kind of like, remember how retail brokerages were, you know, it used to cost, you know, $50 to make a trade, and then everyone kind of just slowly undercut each other by a couple bucks until Robinhood just said, zero fees.
00:07:16.062 - 00:07:29.574, Speaker A: Screw it. Everyone trades for free. It feels like that's what mega EtH has kind of done, and they're just skipping to the inevitable conclusion of how rollups are going to design themselves. So I don't know the team personally, but I like it from a strategy standpoint.
00:07:29.702 - 00:07:50.136, Speaker B: Yeah, feels like that's a good lead in, actually, for this first conference. So I want to talk about a few things. One is Solana blinks. Two is like, there's actually a lot of movement on ETF's this week. There's Solana Etf's and Eth Etf's. But actually, this first place to start. And the reason I wanted to bring Mark and Mike on the show is around what Mike was saying about the end game of roll ups.
00:07:50.136 - 00:08:13.526, Speaker B: And it feels like the kind of conversation around ETH is changing. And there are these decisions that ETH made that are different than the core decisions that Solana made of. It does feel like the ETH camp might be re evaluating that. And there was actually a Charlie Noyes tweet that I'm going to use to kind of kick off this conversation. So just to read this. So Charlie is one of the founders of paradigm. He said, here's what I basically think we should do.
00:08:13.526 - 00:08:29.406, Speaker B: One, make l one, make the l one more hospitable for apps. Two, Max da. Or I can break this down. Max EB to drop validator count tons, raise the gas limit substantially. Three, cut block time. So that's under make l one more hospital for apps. Number two, Max da.
00:08:29.406 - 00:09:01.796, Speaker B: So breakdown of this is fix the blob pricing and gossiping scale the blobs pure das ASAP. And three is stabilize MeV. And the second tweet under this was actually maybe the more important one, which he said, this means recognizing that solo staking is not sustainable. Timing games aren't a big or urgent problem. The dominant form of MeV is LVR, which is sub linear in block time. So cutting block times will actually make this situation better and deprioritizing other stuff. So the reason this is such an interesting tweet from Charlie is what he's talking about are a lot of the.
00:09:01.796 - 00:09:26.890, Speaker B: He's saying eth should go in the direction of. I think that'll some of the decisions that someone like a Solana maybe has made or some of the other. I think Logan from that Sante called out from frictional, the high throughput chains have made these decisions. So, Mike, let me tee you up for this conversation. You've been pretty active in the blockworks research subscriber chat. Like, why is this so, why is this such an interesting tweet from Charlie here?
00:09:28.470 - 00:10:32.248, Speaker A: Yeah, I can, I guess, get it at a high level, and then Mark or Santa would love to get maybe a more in the weeds take from either of you guys. But I think the exhuming out there are the scaling problem in blockchains. There's only really two big frameworks for how to approach that, which is to layer it and say, okay, we're going to keep the computers and the bandwidth requirements on, like, eth main chain static, and we're going to move a bunch of the computation up to another layer, or you just make the boxes bigger on your main chain. And like, those are the two different routes that Ethereum and Solana have gone. And so there are, frankly, challenges with both of those, with both of those approaches. The Ethereum approach to Solana has always been, well, when are you going to stop making the boxes bigger? How big is too big? At one point, are you participating or preventing people from participating in consensus, et cetera? And that's, I think, pretty valid knock on Solana. But I think there's been this you can have your cake and eat it, too approach in Ethereum, which is not actually accurate.
00:10:32.248 - 00:11:45.348, Speaker A: And a huge part of that has been the PBS design philosophy. And the PBS design philosophy basically says, hey, in consensus, we're going to recognize that there's a lot of work that goes into consensus and it's okay to have specialized parties participate. So historically, the proposer would do everything, and we've been just unbundling the roles that the proposer does, and we've been giving them to builders. Now, the challenge as ETH roadmap has gotten more complex and as we're trying to actually ask the l one to do more again, which is the pre conf, part of the story, is that the builder centralization part of the story is becoming more and more of a problem, and there is a trade off there. And so I think maybe where this is coming to a head, I don't want to speak too much from paradigm or Charlie's standpoint here, is that we're saying, hey, there's actually some issues with the ETH scaling roadmap today. There are some real technical problems like Interop, but also we're centralizing builders to a real extent. And maybe if we want to solve the interop challenge, we can actually make some improvements to eTh main chain and make some pragmatic changes instead of pre comps, which are extremely complicated, have a lot of negative externalities and are going to take a long time to implement.
00:11:45.348 - 00:12:02.452, Speaker A: So paradigm has been super deep in Ethereum infra builds for a long time, and they're kind of invalidating a lot of the sacred cows or speaking against some of the sacred cows, I think that the Ethereum community's had. So it's just interesting to hear them come out and comment like that.
00:12:02.596 - 00:12:07.920, Speaker B: Yeah. Mark, what do you think about paradigm talking about some of these sacred cows that Mike mentioned?
00:12:08.320 - 00:12:44.122, Speaker D: Yes, I mean, I don't know if it's more like, let's move more towards high throughput and abandon the existing roadmap. I think it's more like let's prior, like, shift our priorities because, I mean, right now a lot of people, you know, I don't like having to use Ethereum at 02:00 a.m. just to get the lowest transactions. If I want to do something right, that's, that's not fun. And I think it's, it's really about like reprioritizing the UX, just like kind of borrowing from Solana. So I think, like, Solana has actually been really good. As for competition for ETH, like, it's the first real alt l one that I, I wouldn't even call it an alt l one anymore.
00:12:44.122 - 00:13:50.250, Speaker D: And I think a lot of people in the community are kind of getting fed up of these deep research long term goals that are deemed as very high and sacred and need to come first before everything above Ux. So I kind of agree with them with most of that tweet, but there are some aspects of it I have mixed feelings or might not agree with at all. But then I still do agree with Ethereum's how you broke down the two scaling parts. I still do agree with Ethereum's vision because, I mean, the only kind of analogous example I have is the current Internet, and that is not all on one layer and that is not fully synchronous and doesn't look like that. And yet it's one of these, if not the best thing that we've created. And nobody's having an issue with 200 millisecond response times when you buy something on Amazon. So I think if you're really bullish on crypto in general, you can't imagine that one chain can handle it all.
00:13:52.150 - 00:13:54.450, Speaker B: Santi, agreed or disagree?
00:13:57.040 - 00:14:20.456, Speaker C: I don't like making analogies to the Internet because if you're gonna do it, then just this, stick to the Internet, you know? So, like, I appreciate analogies are really good to, like, I don't know, get people to understand things, but we're building something fundamentally different. And so, I don't know, I. I still agree in a multi chain world, but, yeah, that's just the caveat.
00:14:20.568 - 00:14:20.856, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:20.888 - 00:15:15.296, Speaker C: I don't have a particular opinion on the, it's interesting to see paradigm like, tweet about this. Obviously, they've been more ethereum focused and centric. But let me ask you a question, Mike, or mark. Even if you were to implement a lot of these changes on the margin, how competitive do you think it is to something that is just built from scratch? Because a lot of the discussions that we've had here in the pod is integrated versus modular. That's one set of debates, and the other one is, if Vitalik were to build ethereum today from scratch, he would do a lot of decisions that you can't do. Like, these are like marginal improvements, but there are more fundamental parallelization that you're just not going to get. So I'm curious, even if you were to implement the things that you agree with here the most, one, what are the things that have the most amount of impact? And two, what does it actually mean for the end user? Because that's, I think, the most important thing.
00:15:15.296 - 00:15:20.260, Speaker C: Or the developer that is deciding whether to build on Ethereum or just go somewhere else.
00:15:22.890 - 00:16:16.862, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. I think one of the challenges about this debate is that there are multiple debates and issues that are getting conflated into one here. And I think to maybe respond to actually something that Mark said, and to respond to you also, Santi, is I think there has recently been sort of a change in the zeitgeist of what people want to talk about in crypto. And I think people are frustrated with solutions that feel kind of rube Goldbergy or very complicated, or have very long timelines when there are simpler solutions that are available. Like, what do users really want? At the end of the day? They want transactions that are fast and cheap. And there's been an enormous amount of effort to maintain the decentralization properties of Ethereum while delivering that to users. That is the roll up scaling roadmap.
00:16:16.862 - 00:16:56.660, Speaker A: Um, but, yeah, I think I'm just on record saying this, but, like, I'm kind of a hater of precomps for this reason, because I don't think, to your point, Santi, like, I don't think users care about that. I don't think users, I don't think users are, like, begging for l one proposer pre comps. This feels like a top down push from Ethereum, right? And there's just, there are easier, like way less complicated solutions. Like this isn't going to be a challenge on Solana because the block time is so much shorter. You could sidestep this entire infra debate just by having shorter block times and slightly higher requirements for bandwidth than hardware for proposers, which Ethereum should probably do.
00:16:57.120 - 00:18:05.580, Speaker C: This has been like sacrosanct. Right? Mark, I know you want to jump in here, but coming from someone that was more Ethereum aligned, a big part of my journey of really appreciating Solana was actually a conversation I had with Logan. Again, Logan keeps coming up from frictionless, um, it's like the people in Ethereum historically, like, oh, solon has higher, higher hardware requirements and that's an issue for decentralization. And at the end of the day, it's very philosophical because no one, like in Ethereum, like if you look at concentration, like no one's really running a raspberry PI and like their kitchens, you know, and like, the reality is the idea of higher hardware requirements used to be an issue that I had in my mind. And then I look closer and it's like people should go listen to the pod that we have with anatoly, the second one, like after the year in, after FTX collapse. And it's like when you actually look at the piano of blockchains, like it's like you either believe you're going to make a lot of money by running a validator and like you front the capex and you believe that this is where a lot of fees are going to come through or you don't. And if you don't, that's a more fundamental problem.
00:18:05.580 - 00:18:30.992, Speaker C: But I actually think that like hardware, the higher hardware requirements are not. It's sort of like eth bod to Solana. And I don't see it as an issue. The end of the day, people are going to front those higher hardware requirements because they can make a lot of money with fees. And that's just the state of things. If you believe that users and activities can happen in that blockchain, then you don't have a problem. Like the same with the bitcoin miners are willing to front huge millions of dollars in ASIC chips.
00:18:30.992 - 00:18:32.840, Speaker C: Like, just the reality of things.
00:18:33.380 - 00:19:19.690, Speaker D: I'm going to agree with you there because even on that same .1 of Charlie's comments was talking about raising Max Eb the effective balance. It has some other benefits. But one thing I think we're going to see out of that is the validator count dropped drastically, which is the point. But there's something like 10,000 full nodes on Ethereum, whereas there's a million validators, so we're kind of like 100 to one. And I think if it drops down closer to, like, 10,000 validators, and then we see Solana has, what, a couple of thousand validators running already? I think the difference between the two doesn't start to look as drastic, and then you start to question how much is hardware really a factor in that, in that decentralization game?
00:19:21.790 - 00:20:12.818, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's probably, like, here's the thing about this design philosophy of PBS that I actually agree with is there's going to be like, if you look at the transaction supply chain, either of Ethereum or Solana, it's really complicated, and it's only going to get more complicated. So I agree with this high level, I agree with this high level idea of specialization of labor and trying to be strategic about which actors are doing which things. But I think that we've gone too far in PBS. And my perspective or diagnosis, and anyone listening can feel free to push back, is that we've been really, in Ethereum land, myopically focused on the hardware requirements for the validators. And so we just keep unbundling things that validators have historically done and saying, hey, we can have our cake and eat it, too. We're still decentralized. Look at how many validators we have.
00:20:12.818 - 00:20:44.092, Speaker A: Look at how low the hardware requirements are. But then we just keep giving more and more things to relays and builders. At some point, if you're going to talk about one network being more decentralized than the other, you have to do it holistically. You can't only cherry pick one metric, because it just doesn't really make that much sense from my perspective, to say, hey, yeah, this network is super decentralized. We've got hundreds of thousands of validators, but we've got three builders that build all the blocks, right? Like, at some point, that has to be a factor.
00:20:44.276 - 00:21:09.090, Speaker B: Mike, can you explain, for folks who maybe don't listen to bell curve every week and they're stuck listening to Santina Yammeran on Empire, can you explain maybe this PBS design philosophy, and specifically you and I have talked about it being compared to maybe taxi medallions, in a sense. Can you maybe get into this a little bit? Or the proposals, I guess you could say, are compared to the, uh, medallions and taxis.
00:21:10.270 - 00:22:31.320, Speaker A: So, um, if you run a validating node in Ethereum, you get to participate in consensus. So you put up a certain amount of collateral. You put up 32 ETh in collateral, and then you invest like some minimal amount of ongoing energy costs. And then you also invest your time, right? So you're like, but then what you're, what you are allowed to do is participate in consensus. And your reward for doing that is you get some amount of issuance, but you also get, you can build blocks and people in Ethereum land figured out first and a long time ago, that you can actually, depending on how you order those transactions within blocks, you can actually make some money, or quite a bit of money if you're really smart. And that actually building those blocks and trying to optimize profitability on those blocks is actually something really well suited for very, it's a very sophisticated activity that's really best suited for hedge funds specifically or people who are very crypto capital markets savvy. And so that along with, in the beginning of, there used to be these things called priority gas auctions, which was searchers bidding against each other to front run, and they created all this gas was, this was kind of like an early version of this idea of saying, hey, there are going to be a bunch of blocks that are built in this off chain auction, which is mev boost, which was created by flashbots at the time.
00:22:31.320 - 00:23:15.356, Speaker A: And then thats going to be transmitted to proposers who basically just get to sign off on the highest amount that theyre going to get paid. And so that was the beginning of this mev boost was an unofficial, non specced version of proposer builder separation, where initially you had one entity, which is the validator, and they built the entire block themselves. And then you had two entities, because this one entity has the right to propose a block. They have a block monopoly. They have the right to propose that block to Ethereum. But then you actually have this other entity, which is building the block in a profitable way, which is the builder. So that's like the design, that's the design philosophy here.
00:23:15.356 - 00:24:31.474, Speaker A: And recently what's been happening in Ethereum is like, well, actually, what if we want to give more rights and flexibility and create more financial, financialize this very valuable contract right that proposers have? So what if I want to be able to sell the right to propose in the future, right? Or, and that's basically what, what pre confirmations are. So you're actually adding financialization to this, this like contract, right. And at the same time, you're unbundling a lot of the responsibilities of participating in consensus. So if you push that all the way over to the limit. What proposers really have is this really valuable right, which is granted them by the protocol, which is to have a monopoly on building a block at some given point, and then they farm that out. They outsource the actual building of the block to like to the, to the builders. So I think what this kind of looks like is something really similar to what the medallion service in NYC taxis look like, which is if youre a medallion, like if you drive a cab in New York, you have to put up a bunch of money, you pay for this thing called the medallion, and that gives you the right to drive around and pick people up and make money.
00:24:31.474 - 00:25:15.646, Speaker A: And in Ethereum, it looks pretty similar. What you really have as a proposer is this protocol enforced right to make a block, and then you have to put up collateral to effectively purchase that right, and then you farm it out to someone else that actually does the work for you. But that's the challenge as we financialize, as we increasingly financialize that right and try to grant more ability to the people that have the monopoly, but they can actually perform that work themselves. You're just giving all the execution around that stuff to builders, and that's what's causing this whole big issue and problem. But that's like my take on. And so I think proposal builder separation is right. We just need to have a more nuanced thought about like what the division of labor should be.
00:25:15.646 - 00:25:21.814, Speaker A: Should it be 1% of work as the proposer and 99% are builders? Or should we move it back a little bit?
00:25:21.942 - 00:25:36.850, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think you're tying that to the thing you said before that question. You would argue that, look, we're all super focused on validators right now and how many validators you have and how big are the validators. But nobody in Ethereum land is talking about the maybe builder centralization that's happened as well.
00:25:38.030 - 00:25:40.400, Speaker A: They are behind closed for sure.
00:25:41.700 - 00:25:46.092, Speaker B: Maybe not that no one's talking about it, but people should be more focused on it and talking about it.
00:25:46.276 - 00:26:08.970, Speaker A: What do you guys think? Mark and Santi? So this is coming to Solana as well. If you listen to Zano and Lucas from Jito, they're also looking at it and being like, we also are heading towards proposer builder separation. So do you think this is an ETH thing? We've been, we're knocking Eth quite a bit here, but this is also going to come to Solana at some point as well. What do you guys think about that?
00:26:09.630 - 00:27:00.760, Speaker D: It's kind of fitting from this talk, from research day, we're all building the same thing, and there's always a. There's a box in the middle that does all of the work. I'm of the philosophy that it's okay to have some centralization in terms of, like, the execution and the specialization of certain tasks. Once the verification of it is decentralized, like, once the verification of it is decentralized, once there's an alternative fallback option, and once there's like no censorship resistance, I don't see why there's an issue. I mean, PBS has been running externally out of protocol for the past few years now, and, you know, it users, it's more or less the same thing. The only issue there is like Mev with amms and front running. But apart from that, I don't really see an issue with it.
00:27:00.760 - 00:27:03.300, Speaker D: I don't know if you have any thoughts, Santi.
00:27:05.160 - 00:27:06.820, Speaker C: No, no, I would agree with that.
00:27:09.000 - 00:27:37.556, Speaker A: Also. There's one. There is a difference as well. I feel like the ETH research community is taking a lot of knocks for being like, why are you focusing on this stuff? I think a lot of the stuff that they're actually explicitly focused on in the roadmap is the right stuff to be focused on. But there is a. There's almost like an out of band channel as well, which is especially around these pre comps. These are privately funded infrastructure companies and people are kind of cheering them on and moving them towards the solution.
00:27:37.556 - 00:28:24.204, Speaker A: And we haven't talked about some of the negative ramifications of something like, I think that's what happened, by the way. I have no idea. But I think the reason paradigm is being more vocal about this stuff is because there are really negative drawbacks to preconfirmations. You are further incentivizing vertical integration between relays and builders. You're creating multi block mev, which just makes censorship and mev extraction much worse. Honestly, I think the paradigm guys are being like, hey, this private market infrastuff that some people are pushing forward here is going to create way more negative externalities than benefits that we're then we're going to see in Ethereum world.
00:28:24.372 - 00:28:44.360, Speaker B: Also, I think people are just fed it like pre comps. Who. Someone was on a podcast talking about pre comps, talking about it taking two or three years, like, we just don't. And if someone's saying it's going to take two or three years, that means three or four. Like when you compare that to what's happening in some other ecosystems where it feels like things are shipping on a quarterly basis. I think people are just fed up with the long shipping times, honestly.
00:28:45.220 - 00:29:57.242, Speaker D: But I mean, the thing is, we have precomps now, like all centralized sequences and all the roll ups do preconce now. And I think, you know, everybody, everybody's talking about decentralizing the sequences. So then we're going to get this new decentralized marketplace of sequences that, you know, will be the big block in the middle. It will actually allow roll ups to say, okay, look at us, we don't have a centralized sequence anymore, and it could possibly allow for them to capture some of the MEV that's happening in their own systems. That right now is probably happening by people who are placing their RPC nodes closer to the centralized sequences. But I think the thing is, if we're going to have decentralized sequences in a shared marketplace already, and it seems like that's inevitable, why not give them the role of pre comps to do in the meantime? Because I think that what Ethereum is doing with PBS, with restaking with precomps, it's, it's letting the free markets decide what is the best outcome for this trial and error accelerationism. And then when whatever we converge on as the best outcome, Ethereum is just going to enshrine it and it's like, okay, this is the best solution, we'll do this.
00:29:57.242 - 00:30:00.270, Speaker D: But I think the problem is that they're just taking long to do that.
00:30:01.130 - 00:30:43.638, Speaker C: Well, listen, Mike, I think you bring something really important. It is difficult to like from, especially where I sit, I'm not as technical, but like things take a long time to build. So like to be critical of like certain things that the Ethereum foundation or like the Ethereum, there's multiple people, researchers, right? It's hard, right. Because sometimes like you have to do the difficult stuff that is not immediately going to impact users to then, you know, in two, three years time have a really meaningful impact. Like EIB 1559, right? It took forever, but ultimately, like, you know, hey, you know, I think it was a really good thing. Solana's gonna at some point have to implement that. So it is kind of like, I appreciate it's really frustrating, but I think it's just important to take a longer term view.
00:30:43.638 - 00:31:08.740, Speaker C: But I want to play a game because this relates, by the way, for mega, these narratives are really interesting. We talk about decentralizing. The sequencer is something that is constantly talked about. Let me ask you a question. If you're an l two user, what's the most important thing for blockchains, if we're going to use a blockchain, what's the one or two most important things?
00:31:09.520 - 00:31:15.264, Speaker B: Transaction settles quickly and your transaction goes. Yeah, transaction goes through, something actually happens.
00:31:15.312 - 00:31:20.580, Speaker C: Unchief mark, you said it is the valid. I don't know, Mike. If you want to take a guess.
00:31:22.000 - 00:31:30.226, Speaker A: I mean, I think you want strong settlement insurances. You want to make sure your shit isn't going to get censored, and then you want it to be as fast and cheap as possible. Are those that.
00:31:30.258 - 00:31:48.938, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I think you all said a combination. It is validity and, like, verifiability of the execution. Like, you can, you know, it's settled, but also you can verify it, right? You can contest it. Right? So when it comes to l two s, the most important thing is fraud proofs. Like, that's one thing. If you're going to use an l two, it is fraud proofs.
00:31:48.938 - 00:32:26.424, Speaker C: If it doesn't have a fraud proof, run away. Like, and so, like, the question becomes, like, why is decentralizing the sequencer such a hot topic? Because for me, it doesn't. It can impact liveness and censorship, but it doesn't compromise verifiability. Like, you can have your money stuck in the l two, but at the end of the day, you can take it back. If you have fraud proof, you can prove, hey, this is malicious, and you can bring it back to the other one. It might take time and there might be an issue, right? You might get liquidated or whatever, but you're not going to get rugged. And so I think, like, for me, it's like, yeah, you decentralize and sequencer, I get it.
00:32:26.424 - 00:32:55.920, Speaker C: It's sort of more of a hand wavy thing. And the reason I bring this up is because I think it just tells you the big disconnect between what the market and market participants think is important and what is actually important for blockchains, it's a big gap. Like, Mike, you probably know this better than anyone. Like, it's just like, why are we talking about decentralizing the sequencer? Build goddamn broad proofs? Like, I mean, like, there's one thing that is super important and there's another that is not important at all. Like, at all.
00:32:56.700 - 00:33:03.360, Speaker A: Also, there's a multi sig and the contracts are upgradeable, you know, like, right.
00:33:06.780 - 00:33:25.880, Speaker C: So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know if you guys want to apply to any of that, but it's just, for me, it's just like, I appreciate that some things, like, needed take years. And I'm willing to be patient, but I'm not willing to be patient when you don't have fucking fraud proofs. Like, why did you raise $50 million and don't have fraud proofs? I'm sorry. Ridiculous.
00:33:28.500 - 00:33:30.068, Speaker A: Mark, what are you gonna say?
00:33:30.204 - 00:34:18.356, Speaker D: I think, I mean, yeah, I get the whole thing. I think people, I think we're in this new trend of shipping things before they're built, but just because we have to, otherwise, where will the users be? And then when you ask what's important for users, I agree, like, you know, validation and verification. But I'm thinking of, like, that's like second tier of users. I'm thinking like first tier of users, like people who don't, who don't worry about the Amazon purchases, don't think about all of that backend stuff. They just want, they want cheap and fast transactions. And I think that's why we have centralized sequences right now, because we had to skip a couple of steps to give a certain type of users. And I think possibly the most important, if you want mass adoption, the users who are not supposed to be caring about the backend stuff, we want to give them that same web tool like Ux.
00:34:18.356 - 00:34:21.160, Speaker D: Sorry to hit you with the Internet analogy again.
00:34:22.700 - 00:34:26.760, Speaker C: Would you agree this would make a super opinion. I'm like, they're going to run a centralized sequencer.
00:34:28.380 - 00:34:57.938, Speaker D: And so now I think there's a third type of who is more like an investor user. And this is where I think, like, decentralized. Any sequencer is nice, is because you can, like, for instance, arbitrum can sell its sequencing rights to this shared marketplace, and now they can give that MEV back to token holders or rebate gas or, but, or whatever their implementation of it is. But the point is they can use it to benefit the token holders or the users, but they're tapping into new financial resources that wouldn't be possible with.
00:34:57.954 - 00:35:45.030, Speaker A: A centralized, I've got a question for you guys related here, but something that's interesting is that, okay, the Ethereum, l two s, they've been, most of them have been, the big ones like Optimus and margin have been live for a number of years. There's a bunch of experimentation on distribution, like what blasted and on the actual architecture, which is what mega eth is doing. Bitcoin, l two s are just getting started. They're in the very early days. There are no clear winners yet. I would be curious, what lessons have you guys learned from how ethel two s have played out then? How would you advise bitcoin, l two teams both a to get the best outcome for like what is just the best outcome for what bitcoin l two s could look like. But then also, how would you advise teams, like what mistakes would you tell them to avoid?
00:35:46.850 - 00:36:24.416, Speaker D: I just have one point here. I think it's not a very not the best tick, but I, you know, if your bitcoin l two s are calling themselves l two s now, without truly being l two s, they're still trusting a multi stick at the end of the day. But ethereum l two s aren't true l two s either. None of them are like stage twos. So I think one thing from a marketing side, lean on that. Lean like we're going to build this and ship it probably before it's finalized. I'm sorry, that's a really bad take, but it seems like that's how you're going to get the most competition and accelerate the movement further and actually get what might be the best l two.
00:36:24.448 - 00:36:56.458, Speaker B: For bitcoin this episode is brought to you by, say, Sei's belief about the world I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world. Agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what say has done with their v two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today.
00:36:56.458 - 00:37:29.952, Speaker B: They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest evm l two s on the market today. Say v two is now live on public Devnet with mainnet scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with say on x at say network. Sei network. Big things to say. Hey everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of Empire.
00:37:29.952 - 00:38:10.910, Speaker B: Marinade is a staking protocol in Solana. I remember when they launched, I think it was back at a Solana hackathon and they were funded with this 80k grant. It's super cool to see how far they've come. They're the only stake pool today that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards and automatic downside protection. With their new protected staking rewards, you can stake natively or liquid, stake with marinade and get the same high performance delegation strategy that thousands are using already to stake your soul to over 100 of the best Solana validators. Marinade has been live for over two years and they have audits completed by four of the top security firms in crypto. The delegation strategy is a first of its kind.
00:38:10.910 - 00:38:46.678, Speaker B: So if you're staking your Solana, if you want to start staking your Solana, if you want to get some yield from your soul, start staking today with marinade. Go hit the link in the show notes. Big thanks to Marinade for everything that they've done in Solana staking land. Go check them out. Go stake your Solana with marinade today. This episode is brought to you by Polygon. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto, liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains with the ag layer, that was a big mouthful.
00:38:46.678 - 00:39:08.500, Speaker B: So I'm going to tell you what it means in my, in my words. There's all these things popping up, l two s and l three s, and it's chaos, right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the AG layer to tap into the liquidity of the ag layer and the users of the ag layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the ag layer. It's hot. It's by Polygon Labs.
00:39:08.500 - 00:39:30.976, Speaker B: They've got the Polygon Community grants program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for polygon builders. Season one. It's live right now. It features 35 million in matic to support the next generation of polygon builders. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Dot technology forward slash grants. That's Polygon technology forward slash grants.
00:39:30.976 - 00:39:59.152, Speaker B: If you talk to anyone, let them know blockwork sent you. This episode is brought to you by Mantle. Mantle staked ether, which is me, serves as the value accumulating receipt token of Mantle LSP. The base yield is currently 3.2%. But there's also more. On top of that, Mantle restakes 100,000 me to generate Eigen layer points every single day. Mantle is now the third largest address getting Eigen layer points.
00:39:59.152 - 00:40:22.980, Speaker B: A big part of the Eigen that's going to be distributed is actually going to be given out to meth holders on Mantle l two, including all the dapps. And there's daily screenshots. Bridge the me to an l two, that's bridge, Mantle XYZ. You can enjoy being a part of the hopefully eigen that will be given out to me holders. So big thanks to mantle for letting empire listeners know about this. Really exciting. Thanks again, Mantle.
00:40:22.980 - 00:40:45.288, Speaker B: Right, so Mark, you're saying the recommendation is just look at what all the ETH guys did without fraud. Like they basically just launched like sidechain secured by Multisig, not technically an l two, but they were actually able to get market share. So like they got market share even though they're just this little side chain secured by. You're saying go do that or you're saying learn the lesson and don't do that.
00:40:45.424 - 00:40:59.328, Speaker D: I'm saying. That's what I'm saying is not, it's not a good take, but if you want to get the use, like if you want to get users, we'll do that. Or you can wait until everything's fully shipped and you can be 20th l two, like Tyco who has everything running and no users.
00:40:59.384 - 00:41:21.514, Speaker C: It's, I mean, I'll take the opposite of that because the. I think people are. You hear this in pitches, right? I've been pitched ten bitcoin l two s. And yeah, we're going to do basically. Basically that it's like the Ethereum roadmap. People don't care about fraud proves I don't care about. I'm like, I get it.
00:41:21.514 - 00:41:34.950, Speaker C: DJ's are going to chase yield, but you fundamentally don't understand your customer. Most bitcoin holders probably will be a bit more different than your Ethereum Degen, I think.
00:41:37.520 - 00:41:41.264, Speaker A: Santi, what about blockfi though, just out of curiosity because.
00:41:41.312 - 00:41:46.496, Speaker C: Well, true. Yeah, I mean like this is the paradox of the bitcoin maximalist brain.
00:41:46.568 - 00:41:47.260, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:47.680 - 00:42:23.710, Speaker C: Which unfortunately what you're, what Mike is saying is they were very critical of like bridging over using WBTC or, you know, but then they ended up putting their money in block fi and, you know, the rest is history. So you're right. I mean, I think it's, it's a really important point, I think on the margin. It's sort of a psychological subtle thing when you're like people are in always encrypted the double standard. Right. You're critical of stuff that happens on chain, but like you're using centralized exchanges. You kind of have to.
00:42:23.710 - 00:43:06.534, Speaker C: In many ways, I think the infrastructure and security off chain has like improved vastly like. But it was like sort of, I think a different era. I wouldn't point the blockfi as a thing to suggest that like people are not going to care about what they're doing on chain is what I'm trying to say. I think, look, the most important thing is being very, the thing that I tell all teams is just be very transparent in where you are, in your roadmap. Like if, and people should go listen to arch ark, archite. So I invested in them. And when they're going through it, I'm like, let's just accept the fact that, like, when you're interacting in an l two, there is some security trade off.
00:43:06.534 - 00:43:35.160, Speaker C: There is some trade off, just period. Don't, like, if you're a team, just don't say there aren't because you're going to be chewed. Like, blast learned this the hard way when they launched and then they retracted. They're like, look, they, you know, that the fact risk free, nothing is risk free in crypto, period, full stop, nothing is risk free ever in it. And so I think, like, the more you are transparent, if it's a multisig, then just say it's a multi sig. And we're working on fraud proofs. And I think users, I think appreciate that.
00:43:35.160 - 00:44:11.210, Speaker C: And, you know, if you have issues as a user, go to l two beat. But yeah, the recommendation is ideally in a perfect world, you know, get fraud proofs when you launch. And I think you play the long game. You want to build the best reputation. And I think it's one of those things that it's really hard if you have an incident or you have an issue, you know, you want to be known as the most kind of technically competent, secure l two. There's a reason why arbitrum is number one.
00:44:12.190 - 00:44:17.650, Speaker D: Arbitrum used to say we inherit the full security and decentralization of Ethereum on their homepage.
00:44:18.770 - 00:44:21.390, Speaker C: Do they say, is that still on their homepage?
00:44:22.250 - 00:44:40.450, Speaker D: I think it was last month when I checked. I did a whole bitcoin l two piece. And so I was looking at the marketing of these different l two s. I mean, I'm not faulting them for it, by the way. Right. And I think they're a great team and they're honest actors and all of that. But I'm just, I mean, there's a.
00:44:40.610 - 00:45:19.084, Speaker A: I think there's a through line to what both of you guys are saying, which I'm, I'm on Santi's team in terms of, you should just always be as transparent. It's really obvious when teams aren't transparent and then they have to double down and they're aggressive founders and nobody likes that. But there probably is some. I think there's an element of truth marked to what you were saying as well, that, yeah, if you get. Be honest about it, but just get what the market wants out there as quick as possible, because there are these big network effects. And I would be curious, Santa, your perspective as an investor here. You look at something like arbitrum or optimism, and then you look at the investment opportunity behind one of these new l two s, maybe a mega eth.
00:45:19.084 - 00:45:36.428, Speaker A: And what I see as the competitive advantage that arbitrum has is network effects. They've got liquidity isn't really a problem on. People talk about liquidity fragmentation all the time. On l two s, it's liquid enough. On arbitrum, that's basically, it's more liquid than many. Most l one s. They've got this network effect.
00:45:36.428 - 00:45:56.220, Speaker A: They've got apps, they've got a bunch of eth, they've got deep liquidity, all that stuff. But then you look at something like mega ETH, they probably got better tech, they've got incentives, and they'll have a lower valuation. So how do you, as an investor, look at, like, new l two, like, mega eth versus, like, market leader, like arbitrum?
00:45:58.520 - 00:46:31.878, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, for me, I think it's worth, it's a way to express, like, these. For me, it's worth backing teams that are willing to experiment at the l two s. Like, l two s are here to stay. I think arbitrum is not going to go the direction that mega is. And for me, I want to see ethereum be great again in the sense of like, yeah, I'm going to back Mega because it's just a different type of design choice, and I want to see that play out. I think it's worth for the ecosystem to experiment across multiple parameters.
00:46:31.878 - 00:47:24.398, Speaker C: So for me, yeah, the valuation is lower, but more fundamentally, the different kind of use cases it might be. You know, I think Mega will end itself for different types of apps that perhaps may not be well suited in arbitrum. I've always been in the mind that it's going to be a world of multi chain, and that includes, like, different l two s. So that's how I think of it. You know, if it's a really good team that is willing to experiment on something that a particular l two is not going to, then why not, right. You could argue that blast in the same way, like, blast was just native yield and it was built by a team that understood because they built blur the opportunity cost of capital, where you can take it. And so it's just different things, right? And so, you know, I've just sort of accepted the fact that it's going to be.
00:47:24.398 - 00:47:50.648, Speaker C: We're going to have hundreds of l two s. Perhaps the thing that we don't have to talk about it here, but you remember, like, in Defcon, like, it was, composability is. Was a thing that, like, when. When there was zero l two s, it was like, oh, composability is going to break. What's going to happen? Like, this is going to be really bad. And then. And then I spoke with, like, a systems engineer who was, like, really old and, like, I guess senior, and he'd been around, like, the eighties and the Internet.
00:47:50.648 - 00:48:21.616, Speaker C: I'm like. And I asked him the questions, like, hey, I don't have that perspective. But, like, someone like you, like, didn't the Internet go through this kind of problem as well? Like, where, you know, not composability, but in the sense of, like, just stitching together just different standards or whatever? He's like, absolutely. Like, he's like, I'm not worried about composability. I think this will be fixed. It's just a matter of, like, you know, composability is not a kind of, like, I think it's a spectrum. So anyways, like, what I'm trying to say is, I think we should probably be more focused on mark to something you said, which is always bringing it back to the user.
00:48:21.616 - 00:49:10.070, Speaker C: So there's going to be hundreds of l two s. Well, how do we make it a very seamless experience? Someone like Kyle out there saying, like, hey, when you look at the wallet, like, the user is definitely going to notice his money is in different. Like, if you have USDC on ten different l two s, how can we make it so that liquidity moves seamlessly across these l two s? And whether that's bridges or something else, right? Layer zero or chain, whatever. But I think that's where I think we should focus more resources and attention into, like, accepting the fact that we're going to have multiple l two s, each with their own thriving ecosystems and liquidity. And how can we make it super easy for the user to either abstract that away or to make it seamless to hop around and, you know. You know. So I would like to see more of that.
00:49:10.070 - 00:49:15.018, Speaker C: I think we're under indexing in terms of attention and resources there.
00:49:15.074 - 00:49:37.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me ask you guys a question that I think the answer is. I would assume you all think no, but I'm curious if anyone thinks yes. So we're talking about ethereum, like, maybe moving towards this, like, decreasing block time for faster confirmations and increasing the bandwidth to pipe through more transactions and things like that. Do you think that apps will come back to building on the Eth l one, or has that ship sailed?
00:49:39.290 - 00:49:43.274, Speaker A: I think it just sailed. Personally, what do you guys think?
00:49:43.442 - 00:49:46.778, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I don't see that unless some drastic changes.
00:49:46.874 - 00:49:50.110, Speaker B: Okay, I do too, but I didn't know if anyone would take the other side of that.
00:49:51.460 - 00:50:38.320, Speaker A: It's the cost thing. Okay, here's a maybe to get back to the bitcoin. So here would be a really interesting challenge for, like, if I was in charge of a bitcoin l two, I'd be thinking about this. What is interop going to look like in between bitcoin l two s? And here's the challenge, is that we as users are all like, hey, if bitcoin or ethereum or any of these chains are going to scale, you need l two s that are not probably synchronously composable, but they're composable. There's good interoperability between them. But if I was the CEO of a leading l two, I also know the network effects that you get. And actually, if I'm the biggest one, what's my incentive to be interoperable with smaller l two s? Because then I'm literally just churning users.
00:50:40.260 - 00:51:30.760, Speaker C: Well, this is a very great question when you put it in context into where blast is trying to do right. And for people that are, may not be as familiar, like, obviously they announced the airdrop claim when you went out and claimed the airdrop, like they announced, like, they're, they're basically trying to vertically integrate and just build a super chain, build a wallet, build, and just own that customer through and through. So I think these wars with l two s. Yeah. I don't think there's any incentive to. Perhaps if you're a builder of an l two to have interop, you may want to vampire attack another l two, but there's, but it's just, it's one directional. It's, it's like once you're in my l two, like, you're sticking around here and I'm making everything possible to have you stick, stay around.
00:51:30.760 - 00:51:36.320, Speaker C: And I think that's clearly what blast is doing. I mean, and I think others will follow suit as well.
00:51:37.090 - 00:52:08.364, Speaker D: Yeah. If you're a smaller alto, you just have to hope that you can and you realize there's no path forward to becoming one of the major players. You just have to hope that other people join this composable network, whatever form that may be. And hopefully that aggregate of l two s grows larger than some of the majors. But then that also gets into this thing, like, even with the shared sequencing and, like, you know, polygons, aglaya, all these extension stuff. Like, they're not. I think a lot of people think they're, like, l two exclusive.
00:52:08.364 - 00:52:28.240, Speaker D: Like, l one chains can join a shared sequencer network. And then I start to, like, wonder, is there even, like, any advantage of being a roll up in terms of composability there? So, I don't know. It's messy. And I think. I think the incentives are in play for, like, the major l two s on bitcoin or ethereum to, like, maintain their siloed network effects.
00:52:29.540 - 00:52:56.460, Speaker C: Yeah. As we ran out, I want to maybe ask you guys a question. Like, um, it has felt that the interest in bitcoin, l two s and nft, like, ordinals, has, like, faded recently. Uh, did we get far too ahead in the narrative? Um, or what are you guys seeing there? And are you equally as excited as you were three months ago?
00:52:58.570 - 00:53:35.732, Speaker A: Oh, man, I think this is such a good question, Santi. All right, so I guess it depends on that blockfi question that we were talking about. And how much are people going to want to use their bitcoin to do other things on chain? Like, what are the cultural? Like, how culturally do people think differently about ETH versus bitcoin? And I could see it really going either way. I've waffled on this a lot, and part of me is like, you know, the culture there is, you put your bitcoin in your cold storage, you're buried with your ledger, and that's a good life, you know, and that's the attitude of the bitcoiners. And then there's also. But also a part of being, like.
00:53:35.796 - 00:53:38.604, Speaker C: Red meat and animal organs and shit.
00:53:38.772 - 00:54:02.436, Speaker A: Red meat economics, moving down to Miami. And then there's. And then there's another part of me which is like, you know, bitcoin is over a trillion dollars of wealth. That's a huge step up from Ethereum, which is 300 billion. That's a huge step up from Solana, which is 80 billion. And there's nothing to do. Like, you can't do anything.
00:54:02.436 - 00:54:40.270, Speaker A: This is part of the challenge that eth suffers is the fragmentation of, I go to this l two, or that l two, or I could stay on, you know, I could get a loan through maker or Aave, or I could buy an NFT or there's so many things to do with your eth that actually fragments it. I kind of think I've actually heard one of the bitcoin l two guys give me this phrase, a virgin ground. Like, there's just nothing to do with your bitcoin. And even a smaller percentage of people with fewer things to do it could hit. So I don't really have a ton of conviction on ordinals. But I wouldn't be surprised if this was just the beginning. I think it could get.
00:54:40.350 - 00:54:48.904, Speaker B: Mike, what's your take on bitcoin restaking after talking to you? Had the episode with David on Bell Curve. David from Babylon, for those aren't familiar.
00:54:49.032 - 00:54:57.768, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's going to come down to how functional a platform built on bitcoin versus something like eth can be.
00:54:57.864 - 00:55:01.352, Speaker C: Like, isn't Karak trying to do this as well?
00:55:01.536 - 00:55:34.870, Speaker A: Yeah, Karak is really leaning into multi asset and that's a whole other dimension to this. Like, I'm not really sure if the. Like, the way liquid staking, for instance, has played out of is that it's very ecosystem specific. Lido initially tried to expand onto Polkadot and Solana and it just didn't work. Maybe there's an alignment issue there. Staking operators are really close to the metal of the protocol, but it's been very ecosystem specific. It could be different in restaking, but restaking is also really close to the metal of the protocol.
00:55:34.870 - 00:55:58.570, Speaker A: So it wouldn't surprise me if the same dynamic played out that there was the ETH restaking, the bitcoin restaking, the Solana restaking. So I just. I'm not sure about that dynamic. But then also, you can't smart. There's no smart contract functionality on bitcoin. They use the script, which is pretty non performant. And my sense from the Babylon guys is that they've been really clever in terms of how to build that mechanism.
00:55:58.570 - 00:56:11.700, Speaker A: But I just don't know. To be honest, I'm kind of waiting to see it in production and try to get a sense of the demand. I don't have a lot of conviction around it yet. What do you guys think?
00:56:12.160 - 00:56:38.290, Speaker D: I get that people want to do more with their bitcoin. Like, we're seeing TVL on some of these other, like, bitcoin l two s rise up activity. Kind of rising up, kind of fading. But then just because it's that bitcoin mentality, how many people are going to want to put their bitcoin at stake, risk their precious bitcoin to secure some other chain. I find that one a little bit harder to believe, but.
00:56:38.370 - 00:56:58.034, Speaker B: Okay, so this was my. That's what I was thinking too, Mark. But never underestimate a crypto person's desire to get an extra three to 5%. Like, I have this with ETh. I'm like, why are you, like, in the early days of staking, like, why are you risking all of your eth on these random websites just to get an extra 3.5%?
00:56:58.202 - 00:57:25.006, Speaker C: Because you're shooting for a ten x plus. That's the counter argument. That, and it's a insurance policy. If you thinking about bitcoin right now, I think, no, no, but because I've talked to a lot of funds, I'm like, yo, I'm not going to stake for another extra percent. Some people don't even, like, validate. You know what I mean? Like, they're not even doing it. Because I'm like, you know what? I don't care about that extra 8% again, people don't understand compounding or being inflated out.
00:57:25.006 - 00:58:09.446, Speaker C: They're like, this is either gonna be a ten x plus or it's gonna be a zero. And that's how I've sized it and how you think of it now, the question is, we're making generalizations, right? I don't think we fundamentally, it's hard to build for the current set of users because I think that one changes over time drastically as you onboard millions, which I think will happen at some point. If that doesn't happen, then none of this matters. We're gonna fail as an industry. So I kind of go back to something that, like, Tolle's been kind of really pushing for. It's like, more value should accrue at the app layer. And if we're not, if that doesn't hold true in the next 510 years, crypto is going to be very much on the fringes, because one, I don't think bitcoins like a digital gold.
00:58:09.446 - 00:58:30.144, Speaker C: I'm sorry, guys, I'm going to say it. It's a social construct. I get it, but not enough. It's nowhere gold took centuries to ossify is a store value, and I think bitcoin continues to be a risk asset. This is how I think of it. I get all the properties in austrian economics. I don't think the normal user is buying bitcoin necessarily for that reason.
00:58:30.144 - 00:59:00.522, Speaker C: So I kind of think. I can't think of any industry where, like, where you have the possibility to make, to bring on more capital, efficiency, and that hasn't been tapped on. Like, that hasn't been like optimized. Right, which is what you're saying, Mike, which is there's just this. Bitcoin is bitcoin dominance, like 50% of the entire crypto market cap. That's just like a sleeping dragon. Is it gonna be 100% of it? No, the same with it.
00:59:00.522 - 00:59:27.820, Speaker C: It's not for Ethereum or Solana. There's always a subset of users. They're just gonna be like very pure. But for the most part, I think people are gonna wanna, you know, given the choice of, to make capital, wants to go in places where it could be more productive fundamentally, I'm trying to think of the counterargument of that. It's like maybe gold, but even gold, like with ETF and some other things, like, it's been like hype, there's been on the margin, like it's been made more productive. I guess.
00:59:30.720 - 00:59:42.840, Speaker A: This is literally that you hear gold bugs talk like, bemoan the fact that more institutional investors don't own gold. That's part of the argument that eventually everyone's going to have to buy gold. The reason people don't do it is because they can't model the cash flow.
00:59:42.960 - 01:00:28.722, Speaker C: That that's like the go rather real a reit or whatever, you know, I mean, like, yeah, I don't, I think the other can of worms is like, well, for bitcoin, I think you want l two s and ordinals to work because of just fees. The minute you have more fees, I think, one, you miners already appreciate how lucrative that can be. And if you don't have fees, then I really question the security budget for bitcoin long term. And I think at some point that comes and bites you in the ass, and it's not in 40 years. I'm sorry, guys. It's like you discount it back. And at some point that an asset like Eth, an asset like Solana, becomes far more interesting because it's productive.
01:00:28.722 - 01:00:30.430, Speaker C: It has cash flow attached to it.
01:00:32.100 - 01:01:16.724, Speaker A: So ive got a question for you guys, or maybe a statement that I would love to get your guys perspective on. You know, everyone loves to say now that all these different designs of blockchains are converging, its like, okay, bitcoin looks a lot more Ethereum like now its going to have roll ups to kind of a like a slow, non performant base chain, some other execution environment that inherits some of the properties of the base chain and then proofs are going to get posted and thats when the base chain is going to be. And that's what bitcoin looks like. That's what ethereum looks like. Celestia, even Solana in some sense, if they get something like PBS, you kind of see everyone moving in, like, roughly the same direction. Although I do think Solana and Ethereum are meaningfully divergent from one another. But then I do think that once we all accept, okay, these things are all going to look really similar.
01:01:16.724 - 01:02:09.270, Speaker A: There are some important design decisions that are going to be really hard to the devil's in the details on some of these small design decisions. Like, the fact that you can't do much on the bitcoin main chain just from like, doesn't have smart contracting is really difficult. And my understanding is that Celestia doesn't have that either, but their language is just much more accessible for ZK stuff. Whereas on bitcoin, everyone's trying to jimmy everything in and it's just going to make shipping way more difficult. Block times, like Solana block times versus Ethereum block times feel really significant because you don't have to do anything, like, based pre conformations. You can just start. If Solana roll ups are a thing, you can just go boop, boop, and it's going to be 400 milliseconds, so no one cares.
01:02:09.270 - 01:02:28.724, Speaker A: Honestly. Even chains like Avalanche, which get a lot of shit, they built for interop from day one. Cosmos built from interop from day one. Celestia's got an interop plan from day one. I get why Ethereum is trying to do the base precomp thing. It needs to be state sponsored because there's no incentive. I feel like everyone went off into these directions.
01:02:28.724 - 01:02:43.760, Speaker A: Then we're all going to come back, but then we're going to realize that the decisions that each chain made, like the devil's in the details, and it actually is going to matter a lot. Do you guys agree with that? And if so, what do you think the most important changes are between them?
01:02:45.950 - 01:03:30.386, Speaker D: I do agree with that, and I think the final goal of all of them is or destination is really going to be path dependent. Like, what did you start off? Prioritizing first is going to really shape the outcome of your end end goal. And which. And I think that's. I mean, obviously that's why Solana is so popular. They optimize for the execution and for the UX. I mean, even, even the small things like the team bringing out that phone, which was a success by luck, or even this blinks application that's coming out like all of that shows you where their head is at and how they think about bringing onto mass adoption versus how ethereum thinks with deep research and censorship resistance.
01:03:30.386 - 01:03:39.910, Speaker D: And yes, I think it's really a path dependent. And if one thing I can see is that Cosmos path probably wasn't the best one.
01:03:41.260 - 01:04:02.684, Speaker C: Well, let me ask you a question. Well, first of all, I would agree a lot with what you said about Solana. It's just very refreshing. It's the integrated experience. The user really appreciates it. This blinks thing is huge. Most teams talk about tapping into Ethereum for liquidity, and that's where the users are.
01:04:02.684 - 01:04:26.300, Speaker C: I think it's thinking in very small scale. I think Solana says, I'm going to go where the action and the users are in the Internet, like, across the Internet, not in web, in blockchains. And I think it's super interesting. Most teams try to build distribution. Solana just was like, nah, I'm just gonna try to embed and make it super easy. Hayden had an interest. Tweet, like, that uniswap tried to do this and it didn't kind of work.
01:04:26.300 - 01:05:16.052, Speaker C: We could try to, like, have tears as to why, but the question is so, like, if you're an l two, you're incredibly successful. And we've asked Stephen this question and he had an answer, but, like, do you think we're going to have an l two that is very successful and then branches off away from Ethereum? I get, like, the l one, the security properties, and, like, you don't want to recreate that. But, like, imagine a world where, like, you have millions of users in an l two. You can argue maybe that's possible, but just imagine that wave of one. I'm like, shit, you have an l two that is incredibly successful. Wouldn't they be hyper incentivized to just, like, be like, we're just going to go, like, the Monad route or the app to.
01:05:16.116 - 01:05:17.764, Speaker B: I think. I think we'll see that something.
01:05:17.892 - 01:05:42.802, Speaker C: And then, like, because if you're an l two, you're like, I'm thinking, blast your guys. The blast is in chrome and you've already seen Monad and Aptos and Avalanche and be like, in five years time, Mike, to your point, you're going to probably have a really, really good understanding of what's the best execution environment. And then at that point, you're like, yeah, I'm just going to fork that. Boom, adios, ethereum.
01:05:42.946 - 01:05:56.872, Speaker B: Okay, so I think the answer is yes, Santi. And to answer Mike's question, and your question at once. I think all of these things are building towards one. And then, like Mike said, it's going to. You're going to kind of converge and then diverge. And then converge and diverge, and that'll be like, over the years, we'll see that.
01:05:57.016 - 01:06:06.624, Speaker C: Maybe telegram, because I, from my understanding is that we haven't talked about telegram. That's kind of the elephant in the room, but, like, we're all salivating about their distribution, but it's really hard to build. The tech is kind of shit, I think.
01:06:06.752 - 01:06:20.112, Speaker B: Here's the difference. I don't think it has to do with what. Mike, Mike, I agree with you in one sense. Like the block times and all that kind of stuff, we're going to wake up and realize that these little details did matter. I think it comes down to the culture, actually. Like. No, no, no.
01:06:20.112 - 01:06:28.702, Speaker B: Not the culture thing. No, no. Santi. As, as someone in the investors. No, no. Let me just push back on you. The culture of.
01:06:28.702 - 01:06:31.574, Speaker B: You can have three identical companies building three identical things.
01:06:31.662 - 01:06:34.530, Speaker A: What Jason wants to say is, as a founder.
01:06:35.830 - 01:06:45.326, Speaker B: No, no. Okay. Santi, we. Santi, we talked to someone. We talked to someone deep. We. I guess I shouldn't blow it who it was, but we talked to someone.
01:06:45.326 - 01:07:09.888, Speaker B: And after we stopped recording, he said, I'm thinking about changing chains. And we said, why? And he said, look, all the tech is commoditized at this point. Yeah, you've got these little differences. This person's ZK. This person got bigger blocks, smaller blocks, whatever. But the culture of this chain that he wants to move to has a bigger focus on consumers. And he said, it's the culture of the founders and the people who work at the labs and the foundation.
01:07:09.888 - 01:07:15.352, Speaker B: He said, all the, all the tech is all the same at this point. And I genuinely believe that. And, like, if you talk to all the.
01:07:15.376 - 01:07:21.086, Speaker C: I don't think the tech is all the same, is what I'm trying to say. I think the tech will be. It will very much the same. It will be. Yes.
01:07:21.118 - 01:07:21.970, Speaker B: It will be.
01:07:23.150 - 01:07:24.010, Speaker C: Uh.
01:07:26.470 - 01:07:37.702, Speaker B: I'm not saying the culture of the community. I could give a shit about that. I'm not saying the community. I'm saying the culture of. No, I know that, but I'm saying that. But that stems from the culture of the, of, honestly, the founders in the early team.
01:07:37.806 - 01:07:57.556, Speaker C: I don't agree. Yeah, here's, here's what I'll get up. I'll give Ethereum. The problem that Ethereum has is it's far too decentralized at like, the shipping level there are. When we're talking about Ethereum versus. It's very difficult to compare because people should just appreciate, like, Solana right now. Like, it's a Solana foundation, Solana team.
01:07:57.556 - 01:08:09.480, Speaker C: Like, it's just one organization. Yeah, there's a lot of teams. Like, blink actually wasn't built by the foundation. It was built by what's. It's dialect. Dialectic. And.
01:08:09.480 - 01:08:40.682, Speaker C: And, like, the ZK stuff was built by, like, helios and Guido and a bunch of teams. So, like, there are, like, different dev shops out there that are, like. Which is actually pretty impressive, but it's nowhere near, like, theorem is kind of, like, this huge organization that it's so hard to coordinate. And actually, one of the things that I'm think is going to be interesting is once you have fire dancer, like, Solana's going to kind of move more in that direction. Right. You have two clients. Like, you have to now just kind of just becomes harder.
01:08:40.682 - 01:08:52.050, Speaker C: And so, like, I sympathize with Ethereum. It's, like, actually really hard versus, like, top down directive. Like, if or any other chain is, like, very much top down. And that makes it far easier to, like, make changes, you know?
01:08:52.790 - 01:09:24.042, Speaker A: Okay, I agree with that. Santi, here's another thing as well that I think this is. And again, I don't want to knock Ethereum to bash here, but the reason I never liked the ultrasound money meme was because it just, bitcoin had already won that brand. Like, think about it, from actually less of, like, a. I agree with you, by the way. You know, I think the culture stuff is important, but also there's a branding element that I think people don't appreciate as much in crypto, bitcoin is a really easy to understand, quick brand, and brands only really get, like, one word, right. You can't.
01:09:24.042 - 01:09:50.016, Speaker A: If you have to use a sentence to describe your brand, you've already lost. And so bitcoin has, like, you know, safe, secure, immutable. Like, it has those words, like money. Um, and Solana, if you look at the recent marketing things they've done, payments, blanks, and they're like, fast, fast, cheap consumer. And that's really easy to understand. And it's a huge category. And I think that's the challenge for all.
01:09:50.016 - 01:10:19.444, Speaker A: I think if you're an l one, you need to have a good understanding of what is your word and what is your culture. And I don't know, part of Ethereum's decision to focus on money and the ultrasound money, I didn't like that because I thought they had a really great brand. It was like, technology platform, tech platform optimist. But now it's gotten dragged. Are they money or are they tech? Is it about credible neutrality? It's like, there are all these words. It's very fragmented. And this is cosmos challenge, too.
01:10:19.444 - 01:11:03.060, Speaker A: Like, this is literally what took down cosmos is that they don't have a common shelling point. You actually have a lot of successful cosmos chains. Celestia is a cosmos chain era chain, Dydx. But everyone's like, the cosmos is dead because there's not this common shelling point brand umbrella thing, which has been really critical. And I think that goes on to ET because I actually have also thought for a while, like, why wouldn't arbitrageim just launch its own l one? For as long as an l one is able to create this huge cross current that apps can draft underneath, then there's not much reason to, like, why would you leave the distribution? You know, the light is shining on you, but as soon as that gets fragmented, then there's no longer that incentive to stay. I think.
01:11:03.880 - 01:11:27.372, Speaker C: I think it's one of those things where it's inevitably going to happen at some point by one chain one l two, and then it's going to really incentivize others. But that may take. That's dependent on usage. I think when you actually hit the limitations, because right now no one's hitting. We talk about DP's and all that jazz. That's not the main critical issue right now. The issue is, right, customer acquisition, building useful apps that people want to use.
01:11:27.372 - 01:11:35.720, Speaker C: We're not hitting the TPS is irrelevant. We're not hitting these, like, limitations. It's more of the user experience. And then I think it might.
01:11:36.820 - 01:11:52.476, Speaker D: I think a major l one might happen. My major l two might leave, but I think it might disincentivize because it might be great. You might get an l one premium in terms of your market value, but your costs to run the chain are going to go up substantially. And then you. I mean, the whole point.
01:11:52.628 - 01:11:54.172, Speaker C: Isn't that the same argument with hardware.
01:11:54.196 - 01:11:59.724, Speaker D: That we just had, incentivizing the validators? Yeah. So now you have to do that.
01:11:59.772 - 01:12:01.036, Speaker C: Think about that for a second.
01:12:01.188 - 01:12:01.660, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:01.740 - 01:12:35.656, Speaker C: Why was Solana Solana? It was chicken and the egg. Everyone has this problem, too, but the l two right now is punting this decision because there's no reason to do it now. You have hundreds of millions of users or 100 million users base. Dell one, it stays with the l two. Why wouldn't they just kind of detract? They will, it's, it may not happen now. It's not going to. There's no incentive, but like convincing validators to like to join.
01:12:35.656 - 01:12:46.250, Speaker C: Look at dy DX. They were successful, you know, I'd argue not, but I mean, they were successful in convincing validators. Yeah, yeah, you can't.
01:12:46.290 - 01:13:41.230, Speaker D: But I think that's anyway, but I more see it as like, as these chains are going to be back end stuff, like it's really about which of the web two or web3 developers are going to put link this protocol in the backend of their web two looking up. I mean, and I think that's like when stripe did their demo, they live demo. They chose Solana because, because they just thought that would be, that was most likely to go through, would be quick and fast and make for a nice demo. And it worked to their credit. And so I think when we think mass adoption, I don't think it's going to be as like dedicated to one chain or the other. I think it's going to be which major app besides integrate this protocol into their backend. And then for that, I don't really see any point of you leaving some NL1 like Ethereum for the liquidity and potential to get, to get to that point.
01:13:42.250 - 01:14:24.102, Speaker A: Can I make an observation about the apps that have been successful so far? Most apps that have been successful so far solve a problem that an L1 creates. So like, what I mean by that is what are the big apps on Ethereum? Lido Maker, Aave Uniswap. Right? It's for people that wanted leverage on their ETH, for people that wanted a way to hold wealth in a stable way. On chain. Uniswap basically exists too, because of like Mev and arbitrage, right? It's not because people want to trade against some smart contract counterparty. It's sex Dex. Arbitrage is why volume flows through that.
01:14:24.102 - 01:14:48.746, Speaker A: And so I actually, like I used, I am in this phase of going through thinking of apps and like the l one commodity money thing, platform is being really separate. But I actually think they might be more intertwined than you then you'd think, and maybe this all changes when we get some mini clip style game. But I think they're pretty related, actually. What do you think Santi does?
01:14:48.778 - 01:15:24.758, Speaker C: That's a good observation for ethereum. This is why the whole Eigen thing is the saving narrative for ethereum this cycle. I just questioned how much are we going to push this financialization narrative for ethereum, like, okay, take your eth, restake it 100 times, and then, and then what? There's only a subset of users that, like, at some point of like, hey, maybe I should just go and try this. A lot of stuff, because you have deep end, you have AI, you have. It's not to say that it can't work in Ethereum. This is why it's important to experiment different l two s that might create a Solana type environment. Like, just like when I say that.
01:15:24.758 - 01:16:12.028, Speaker C: A far superior user experience in the l one. No, now the question is, like, yeah, like, you could look at arbitrary was a pretty good experience too. So, like, I'm just kind of like, I have these conflicting views in my brain because I invest in. I don't know what the answer is. I think we're not supposed to know the answers to any of this, by the way, because it's so goddamn early that we're not. I think we'll look back and be like, what the hell are we thinking? Okay, like, to be fair, Solana, who was it? Myrrt had a good tweet about, like, what Solana and Ethereum have gone, right? And it was, I think it was something to the effect of, like, Solana has been very good with. Deep in has been very good with perhaps AI, certainly memes and Ethereum is farther ahead on social.
01:16:12.028 - 01:16:27.890, Speaker C: That's like a missing gap with Solana. Maybe that's a culture thing, Yana, that you're trying to get at, but, like, feel like fantasy pump, fon forecaster, they're all on Ethereum, so maybe that's the culture thing. You're trying to get at.
01:16:29.630 - 01:17:07.034, Speaker A: Someone. I did an episode with Lucas from Cheeto, like, a year and a half ago, and he said, the irony of so liquid staking adoption on Ethereum and Solana are like inverse of one another. Solana has a super high stake rate and really low penetration of liquid staking, like three or 5%. And on Ethereum, it's got a much lower stake rate. I don't know what it is, around 30%, something like that, but a much larger percentage of liquid stake. And it's because. There are a bunch of reasons, but it was because there was the merge in the beginning, and there was such a large ux challenge that Lido came in and solved.
01:17:07.034 - 01:17:46.108, Speaker A: And so Solana built a lot of infrastructure into the actual chain. Like, you can natively delegate in Solana, which you can't do in Eth, and as a result, you have a smaller infrastructure company. But does that mean it's better for users? I don't know how to answer that question, but it was Lucas who made the observation that, ironically, the really poor staking experience in Ethereum is what gave birth to the rise of this massive company in the form of Lido. So it's kind of what you're saying. So I don't really know which one is better or worse, but it's interesting. Do you guys want to talk about blinks for a couple seconds? Because blinks, I do think, are super.
01:17:46.164 - 01:17:48.000, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:17:48.580 - 01:17:51.400, Speaker A: You know, what do you think about them? I'd be curious, your take.
01:17:53.020 - 01:18:20.780, Speaker B: Um, so I guess just to tee up the conversation for anyone who missed blinks, basically. What, uh. I didn't even know it was not Solana who launched this. It sounds like it's dialectic who launched this. Um, blinks allow you to plug to do, to run a blockchain transaction on any, like, web two, front end, basically. So imagine you're on, uh. I think the examples I saw on Twitter were like, you're scrolling your Twitter feed and like, you can, uh, let's say, stake directly through helios, or you can, um.
01:18:20.780 - 01:18:54.650, Speaker B: Uh, what was another example? You could, like, make a swap directly on Jupiter directly in your Twitter feed. So it's an extension of what we saw on Farcaster. If people were paying attention to farcaster frames, I it's basically what it looks like they're trying to do is bring these far caster frames to the whole web. You can do it on Twitter and even things like LinkedIn and stuff like that, I think people are building for. But blockworks could use this. Blockworks could. If we wanted to run a transaction on our website instead of.
01:18:54.650 - 01:19:20.626, Speaker B: It basically allows you to run a salon and transaction on any site, is my understanding. I saw a couple of examples from Helios and Jupiter. I think it's cool. I think it's like, I do remember, like Santi was saying, so Hayden tweeted this out, like, look, we tried this in 2019. It didn't really take off. I think the counter to that is just like, there was no one here in 2019. Like, that was like the pico depths of the bear.
01:19:20.626 - 01:19:32.332, Speaker B: Like, that wasn't just the bear. Like, that was the. That was the dark time of the bear. I don't know. Yeah, 2019 sucked. I don't know. What do I.
01:19:32.516 - 01:19:35.244, Speaker C: So I'm going to create an app like, where were you in the darkest times?
01:19:35.292 - 01:19:36.240, Speaker B: Where were you?
01:19:37.260 - 01:19:39.140, Speaker C: Where were you in March 2020?
01:19:39.300 - 01:19:41.044, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
01:19:41.172 - 01:19:42.120, Speaker C: I was thinking.
01:19:45.740 - 01:20:11.220, Speaker B: I think they're cool. I'm, like, less thinking about blinks as a product and more just, like, as someone who likes marketing a lot. Just, like, I feel like we've been too, like, shitting on Ethan liking Solana here, but, like, it is just a phenomenal. Solana has just done such a good job of everyone's. We're talking about this infrastructure fatigue. They've just gone, like, they've just hit the consumer stuff at the exact right time. And they're just like, everything they do is just, like, speed, speed, speed.
01:20:11.220 - 01:20:37.848, Speaker B: Consumer, consumer, consumer apps, apps, apps right now. And, like, if you're a chain, like, the number one thing you need right now is founders coming and building on you. And, like, Solana is a pretty enticing place for people. So I feel like we're being too overly hype beyond Solana and anti eth on this podcast here. But, like, I think blinks is a very cool product at the. With the only reason of, like, the base layer reason of just, like, someone needed to try this. Will it work? Will it not work? I don't know, but, like, someone had to go try this.
01:20:37.984 - 01:20:48.930, Speaker C: We talked about forecaster. You know, you guys did a big push and not trying to see if it worked or not. Is this just better? Like, how would you compare cast to blinks?
01:20:49.590 - 01:20:59.690, Speaker B: I mean, it kind of reminds me of, like, so, I don't know. I haven't even used blinks, to be honest. I haven't tried the product or anything like that. But you remember when clubhouse was booming during.
01:21:00.710 - 01:21:04.398, Speaker C: I ran a. I think it was like a 24 hours hackathon.
01:21:04.534 - 01:21:06.118, Speaker B: You influence with Stani?
01:21:06.214 - 01:21:13.356, Speaker C: No, with Stani, we ran this fucking. It was like wild. Scotty fell asleep. I think he was snoring. I'm like, sonny.
01:21:13.478 - 01:21:22.664, Speaker B: He was like, yeah, remember clubhouse? And clubhouse was booming. There is, like, a $4 billion valuation now. And then Twitter launched spaces.
01:21:22.752 - 01:21:23.416, Speaker C: Spaces.
01:21:23.528 - 01:21:43.990, Speaker B: And then clubhouse died overnight. And I'm not saying that's actually going to happen to farcaster, because I think far caster and Dan are, like, too damn good to let that happen to them. But seeing this, I was like, this is the same product. Just like, they're allowing you to do things in the feed, basically. So I think it's cool.
01:21:44.410 - 01:22:23.152, Speaker D: I remember when Clubhouse came out and I didn't have an iPhone, so I wasn't too upset when Twitter just cloned them. And I was like, yeah, now I have a chance to be cool. But, yeah, I think I thought the same thing when I saw the 1 minute video for blinks I thought it was like an interface agnostic version of frames, and I haven't used it. I've just seen, like, little examples online. But I'm hoping it's. I'm hoping it doesn't push Solana too much, or at least you can change that out. And I hope that you can pay for it using regular fiat, because I think those are the kind of things I want to.
01:22:23.152 - 01:22:35.420, Speaker D: I want this to abstract away all the complexity of, like, a blockchain in the backend for, like, regular users. I want it to be on a LinkedIn scroll feed, and you can buy tickets for permissionless using one of those links.
01:22:37.240 - 01:22:38.460, Speaker C: What's LinkedIn?
01:22:40.040 - 01:22:59.000, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Wait. I actually have a funny story about LinkedIn. So we talked about Yano, and I actually did play, like, three years ago for a ping pong game for the title of founder number one and founder number two. And this was at an off site, and I had a couple drinky poos. And after I won, I changed my title on LinkedIn. Yeah, changed it.
01:22:59.000 - 01:23:03.006, Speaker A: I was like, founder number one. Like commander in chief or something to us.
01:23:03.128 - 01:23:05.710, Speaker B: And then a couple of drinks. Mike's like, nine beers in.
01:23:06.970 - 01:23:10.162, Speaker C: How many drinks do you have? Two. More like seven.
01:23:10.346 - 01:23:18.750, Speaker A: And then. And then, Yano, you, like, a couple months ago, you were like, dude, is this actually your LinkedIn? And it had been there for, like, three years.
01:23:19.050 - 01:23:23.682, Speaker B: Commander in chief at blockwork. So I was like, dude, I think you gotta change your sales reps. Like.
01:23:23.706 - 01:23:33.702, Speaker C: Hey, someone pointed this out. Your sales conversion ratio goes up, like bye. By a couple percentage points because people take it seriously.
01:23:33.726 - 01:23:36.930, Speaker A: Because you're like, yeah, God, that was.
01:23:37.390 - 01:23:39.214, Speaker C: Can't remember the last time I checked LinkedIn.
01:23:39.382 - 01:24:13.934, Speaker A: No, no, me either. So here's the. I think that, to answer your original question there, Asante is, I think that the advantage that Farcaster has is if Farcaster had real adoption, it's mobile. It's like mobile first, which is the big thing. And this is desktop, which most people don't use Twitter on desktop anymore. And I guess one thing I was so I think it's a hugely positive thing, and I think it's very cool. But then I was really thinking, I was like, do I want to do these actions on Twitter? What am I used to doing on Twitter? I'm mostly just used to reading and posting and writing.
01:24:13.934 - 01:24:21.730, Speaker A: And I was like, maybe I could learn to do these other things, but it's kind of a new learned activity.
01:24:22.240 - 01:24:34.060, Speaker B: But imagine Mike, let me push back. Imagine it wasn't just financial tracts. Imagine it wasn't just financial tractions. Like, imagine we had a link to permissionless and it was like, buy a ticket, and it was just directly in the feed.
01:24:34.600 - 01:24:35.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:24:35.360 - 01:24:59.468, Speaker B: And that was the original idea of why we were leaning into Farcaster. And the problem was, no, we didn't have any users on Farcaster. So what blinks allows you to do is these actions in app, like, mint mint a tweet or mint a mint an NFT, or buy a ticket to an event doesn't. Or make a swap or do some financial traction, but you're meeting the users where they are. And that's the intent is. Yeah, like, I looked at the, um, I was looking at, uh.
01:24:59.524 - 01:25:01.356, Speaker A: What are Blake's intense santi.
01:25:01.428 - 01:25:03.972, Speaker C: Wait, did I just say that? Oh, my man.
01:25:03.996 - 01:25:09.196, Speaker B: Like, listen, Solana had a two year, two year high in daily transactions. Like, the day they rolled out blanks.
01:25:09.228 - 01:25:41.376, Speaker C: Like, I think this is going to be explosive. Like, I think most people underestimating this thing. People sold, rallied 8% because of the ETF. I'm like, again, I'm more way, way more excited about blinks and what that does for conversion. And people don't appreciate this, but, like, like, cart abandonment is a multi billion dollar, like, like, market. Forget about stripe. Like, just, these are the things that, like, people because they don't have a good appreciation for these things.
01:25:41.376 - 01:26:05.560, Speaker C: Like, I've invested in a company that, like, try to fix card abandoned and try to do faster checkout. You don't have that problem. Stable coins now put that exact. Like, most people now shop through, like, Instagram. They see a thing, they have to, like, open a browser and that. It's like, still three steps. Like, my hallmark for investing is, like, anytime you remove friction from a flow, it creates nonlinear results.
01:26:05.560 - 01:26:24.080, Speaker C: That's blinks in my mind. And it's meeting it. You're not like, it's not push or pull. It's like, it's like, oh, come to crypto and create a wallet and do all this crap. No, you want to buy a ticket or permissionless, click this thing. Done. Like, it's just better than a web, too.
01:26:24.080 - 01:26:41.600, Speaker C: It's better than putting your credit card info. That's it. Like, you know what I mean? Like, Senegal with Apple Pay, whatever. Like, it just for people that are still critical to, like, the web, the flow of web3 is, like, inferior to web two. I think they're in for a bit of a surprise when they go and try blinks.
01:26:42.220 - 01:27:02.204, Speaker A: You know what? I agree with that, Santa. You know what people. Well, I guess if I were in charge of the blinks product. You should dog food. Some use cases here, like, go instead of. This is actually something that I see in crypto a lot because there's so much infrastructure. They're like, hey, we're a permissionless marketplace.
01:27:02.204 - 01:27:07.540, Speaker A: Anyone can do anything. Here's this menu of stuff for to do. And people just come and they're like, I don't know what to do with this.
01:27:07.660 - 01:27:09.372, Speaker C: And paradox of choice.
01:27:09.556 - 01:27:29.356, Speaker A: The paradox of choice. Exactly. Oh, really? Okay. Put on the list. But it would be, you know, Solana, I don't know if they could just go to a couple influencers and be like, hey, we'll, like, work with you. Like, what are your, you know, what's your little influencer business? Like, we'll help create some custom things for you, or go to blockworks and be like, hey, we want to. So help us, guys.
01:27:29.356 - 01:27:37.130, Speaker A: But, yeah, set something up. Cuffs, and we're cool for permissionless tickets that you couldn't do otherwise, like, I don't know, like, dog food it a little bit.
01:27:37.290 - 01:28:02.756, Speaker C: Well, Solana, summer just kicked off in Lisbon, so instead of having hacker houses, maybe you should have these hacker elite units, Navy SeaLs, drop in at companies and be like, all right, give us. If I. If I were them, I'd be like, I'd go to these companies and give us three weeks to prove how we can meaningfully sandbox it, meaningfully improve, be more productive in your sales organization. Will work for free. If you like it. Boom.
01:28:02.828 - 01:28:21.960, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. Actually, I know we're, I know we're almost close to time here, but we haven't actually talked about the biggest news of the week, which is that bell curve guys are forming a pickleball team, and we're going to smoke the Empire pickleball team.
01:28:23.060 - 01:28:24.298, Speaker B: Fighting words.
01:28:24.444 - 01:28:27.918, Speaker A: Oh, okay. I like that Santi asked that. I feel much better about our chances.
01:28:28.014 - 01:28:31.102, Speaker B: I'm just fighting for Santi. We got to start practicing, my man.
01:28:31.246 - 01:28:32.846, Speaker A: Have you not played pickleball, Santi?
01:28:32.918 - 01:28:33.150, Speaker C: Never.
01:28:33.190 - 01:28:33.838, Speaker A: It's great.
01:28:33.974 - 01:28:37.822, Speaker C: I play real sports, guys. I appreciate pickleballs, the fastest growing sport in the world.
01:28:37.966 - 01:28:42.970, Speaker B: But, I mean, Santi, you're a runner. That's not a real sport.
01:28:44.390 - 01:28:45.990, Speaker C: Okay, well, not a real.
01:28:46.030 - 01:28:47.210, Speaker B: Not a real athlete.
01:28:49.790 - 01:29:07.636, Speaker C: My frustrated dream is to, like, be a professional athlete. Never going to happen. Listen, we're gonna. Can we address the biggest elephant in the room here? Are we gonna have a, like, weight room booth in permissionless? I'm happy to sponsor part of it. I'm happy techno gym or whatever.
01:29:07.668 - 01:29:24.780, Speaker B: Like, my pitch to you, is we have a sponsorship sales team. You should buy your own booth. You should literally buy a booth and call it and just literally put your face all over the booth and put the only thing in the booth. There's no, like, you know, selling things. There's no merch. It's just a squat rack or a bench.
01:29:25.360 - 01:29:37.580, Speaker C: Honestly, I'll have. I'm willing to do that. Someone like weights would have a squat rack, a treadmill and like a peloton or whatever.
01:29:38.480 - 01:29:53.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I got. I don't know how much you squat. Sansi, I was actually. Yeah, I'm proud of you for making that 800 club. I was going to tell you, I. Because my backs been all messed up and I got. Finally got back over like 200, and I was going to brag that to brag to you about that, and then you were like, oh, mister 800 club over here.
01:29:53.666 - 01:29:55.570, Speaker A: So you're squatting these days.
01:29:55.730 - 01:30:04.786, Speaker B: It's all, it's all an elaborate. To get Santi to buy a fucking booth at permissionless. It's all a big sales pitch.
01:30:04.858 - 01:30:09.746, Speaker C: Tell me we're in a bear market, have all these funds buy a booth. Come on.
01:30:09.778 - 01:30:12.090, Speaker B: The lengths I'm going to to sell sponsorship booths.
01:30:12.210 - 01:30:33.760, Speaker C: Very pretty creative part of the reason why I invested in this. But anyways, if you're a fan, I'm actually. Shout out if you're a listener, you want to sponsor a booth with me. Honestly, if you're going to sponsor a crappy booth and give stickers, or are you going to have a booth with, like, the weight racks? Well, guess where people going to show up. You know, the peloton, the weight rack, and the. In the treadmill.
01:30:35.420 - 01:30:38.240, Speaker B: Mark, I know where I'll be. I regret joining this episode.
01:30:51.060 - 01:30:53.124, Speaker C: How long have we been doing empire for?
01:30:53.292 - 01:30:57.960, Speaker B: I don't know. I know, I know. I think three years. And Mark is the first one to flex on Empire.
01:30:58.860 - 01:31:01.236, Speaker C: We have never flexed in this three.
01:31:01.268 - 01:31:02.028, Speaker B: And a half years.
01:31:02.084 - 01:31:07.262, Speaker C: We might have to change that. Yeah, different shirt for that, but anyways.
01:31:07.446 - 01:31:08.118, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:31:08.254 - 01:31:08.710, Speaker C: Okay.
01:31:08.750 - 01:31:13.318, Speaker B: All right, good. I just got embarrassed by Mark.
01:31:13.414 - 01:31:15.110, Speaker C: Can you dm me your house?
