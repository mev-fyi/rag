00:00:00.280 - 00:00:04.334, Speaker A: Basically answers the question you asked before, which is, am I going to use.
00:00:04.374 - 00:00:07.278, Speaker B: A bank where the protocols are in.
00:00:07.286 - 00:00:12.038, Speaker A: The background, or am I going to access Aave and compound and whatever directly?
00:00:12.166 - 00:00:12.646, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:12.750 - 00:00:17.382, Speaker A: And the answer is, in our opinion, the former, for probably 99% of people.
00:00:17.518 - 00:00:20.230, Speaker B: You're going to access Abra bank, and.
00:00:20.262 - 00:00:21.590, Speaker A: Within Abra bank, you're going to earn.
00:00:21.622 - 00:00:23.350, Speaker B: Yield, you're going to be able to.
00:00:23.382 - 00:00:25.354, Speaker A: Trade, you're going to be able to.
00:00:25.534 - 00:00:28.434, Speaker B: Borrow, and you're going to basically be.
00:00:28.474 - 00:00:32.654, Speaker A: Using something similar to metamask in the background. You just won't know it.
00:00:36.314 - 00:01:01.926, Speaker D: This episode is brought to you by Circle, the creator and issuer of USDC. With over 1.5 million holders globally, USDC is the preferred stablecoin of not only DeFi, but our entire industry. You'll hear more about USDC later in the show. All right, everyone, we're going one on one. Mano Imano with Bill Barheit, one of my favorite folks in crypto, CEO of Abra, founder of Abra Real. I think we tossed around the word og a lot.
00:01:01.926 - 00:01:09.886, Speaker D: I think, Bill, you gave the first ever TED Talk back in the day, like 2011 on bitcoin. So been here for a while. Welcome to the show, my friend.
00:01:10.070 - 00:01:10.662, Speaker B: Thanks, man.
00:01:10.718 - 00:01:14.734, Speaker A: So great to see you. Congrats to you guys as well, and all the success. It's been awesome to watch.
00:01:14.854 - 00:01:26.946, Speaker D: I appreciate it. I'm repping Bill and I are twinning today. I'm repping my Abra shirt as well. Gotta represent Bill. Yeah, yeah, we got, I know, I know. People got to watch this on YouTube. We're twinning out here.
00:01:27.090 - 00:01:28.450, Speaker A: We give good swag.
00:01:28.642 - 00:01:44.730, Speaker D: Exactly. You guys do have good swag. You do have good swag. So, um, before getting into crypto, I want to talk about macro. You came on the show, uh, in April of 2021. I think it was, it was like April or May of 2021. And you basically laid out kind of like your thesis and some predictions.
00:01:44.730 - 00:02:05.250, Speaker D: And in your view, what you saw happening in 2021 was market was going to get crazy. There was still a bunch of excess liquidity in the system. Look out for big bull market in 2021. But you said, look out for 2022. Things could get a little scary. Inflation gets out of control, interest rates hike up, market comes down, and I will got to give it to you. Got to give credit where credit is due.
00:02:05.250 - 00:02:31.478, Speaker D: You've done pretty well with those predictions. But one of the big themes that you were talking about is what Ray Dalio talks about for the fourth turning macro fans out there. Who's it Neil, how talks a lot about which is like this 80 to 100 year old debt cycle that's coming in. And you tweeted out, don't try to trade the end of an 80 year debt cycle back in July. So I just want to get. Can you explain high level, this concept of the 80 year debt cycle bubble and where you see us at today in relation to this bubble?
00:02:31.646 - 00:02:42.054, Speaker A: Sure, Ray explains it better than I do, but my simpleton explanation is based upon this idea of human frailty commingled with idealistic economic theory.
00:02:42.094 - 00:02:42.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:43.564 - 00:02:47.580, Speaker A: Monetary theory, in my opinion, should be based upon this idea of sound hard.
00:02:47.612 - 00:02:49.812, Speaker B: Money, where human beings shouldn't be able.
00:02:49.828 - 00:03:23.332, Speaker A: To interfere with the definition of that money. And traditionally, we've always tried our best to do that at the beginning of these cycles. The last cycle was no different. I think pre world War two, we were maintaining 40% gold reserves, and basically, post Bretton woods, it was 100%. And the western powers all agreed to let us hold their gold and basically peg everything to the dollar for foreign settlements. And so what happens over time is that human frailty comes into play. And because this isn't mathematically set in.
00:03:23.348 - 00:03:26.228, Speaker B: Stone, politicians are allowed to more or.
00:03:26.236 - 00:03:53.620, Speaker A: Less change this whenever they want. And they do so in the current debt cycle. Nixon took us off the gold standard in 71 after we couldn't afford to finance the Vietnam war anymore without running up massive debts. And that continued. And we all know what's happened to the purchasing power of the dollar ever since. But what people don't realize is we didn't invent this concept many times in the past. As a matter of fact, it's happened, you know, ten times over the last 750 years.
00:03:53.692 - 00:03:53.900, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:53.932 - 00:04:22.210, Speaker A: So it does appear again. Dalio, his changing world order book is phenomenal. He does a very good job of laying out the reasons why we appear to be in the late stages of this current debt cycle, which we talked about when we last met. And this is continuing. All the macro stuff that we're seeing now really, really supports my thesis, unfortunately. And, yeah, you know, this. This new term of the fourth turning is.
00:04:22.210 - 00:04:26.682, Speaker A: Is getting traction with. With a lot of folks now, and it seems that we're.
00:04:26.738 - 00:04:28.694, Speaker B: We're, you know, heading in that direction.
00:04:29.274 - 00:05:02.610, Speaker D: Yeah, it's kind of crazy to see a bunch of the fourth turning like the macro folks, the, you know, the Lynn Alden camp and the dollar. Who is it? The dollar milkshake guy. Like a lot of these folks I've been listening to for years, I'm like, oh, man. I'm like, probably too sucked into your guys's macro bubbles here and, like, too bought into the, like, macro podcast scene. But, man, you guys seem pretty smart right now. I'm just curious, like, where you see us, like, what is the, what's your framework for, like, how you're viewing it, September 2022? Like, how do you, what's your framework for viewing, like, where we are almost right now?
00:05:02.802 - 00:05:20.024, Speaker A: Yeah, it's tough. And the reason it's tough is that I think that, you know, Raoul pal has this comment, crypto is macro. Macro is crypto. And that's one of the reasons why, as kind of a, a reformed fixed income guy, I do feel like I.
00:05:20.064 - 00:05:22.536, Speaker B: Get the basics, and crypto has enabled.
00:05:22.600 - 00:05:43.240, Speaker A: A lot of that. And it's become part of my day job to understand where this is going. The challenge is that we're in this environment because crypto is macro. Macro is crypto where we're very dependent upon what the Fed does and at the margins. When you're in a leveraged economy where everybody's been dependent upon 30 years of falling interest rates, when that breaks, it's.
00:05:43.272 - 00:05:46.878, Speaker B: Ugly and it broke the bond.
00:05:46.926 - 00:05:51.486, Speaker A: Markets basically have been crashing since more.
00:05:51.510 - 00:05:52.794, Speaker B: Or less late spring.
00:05:53.294 - 00:05:57.430, Speaker A: And that has to stop at some point because our economy is completely dependent.
00:05:57.462 - 00:05:58.874, Speaker B: Upon that not happening.
00:05:59.774 - 00:06:06.342, Speaker A: So we're at this kind of essential tension right now, in my view, where interest rates are going up.
00:06:06.478 - 00:06:08.350, Speaker B: The markets expect that that has to.
00:06:08.382 - 00:06:09.630, Speaker A: Stop because things are breaking.
00:06:09.662 - 00:06:11.030, Speaker B: The yen is tanking.
00:06:11.062 - 00:06:51.518, Speaker A: It's in free fall. It's becoming worthless. The tide has gone out in Europe because of Russia. Now we can see who was naked, and it was the entire european economy all along. The zero growth in Europe since more or less the late eighties, as opposed to negative growth, was more or less predicated on a combination of cheap energy and us exports to the US. And the exports to the US aren't going to work in a model where the dollar is skyrocketing and Russia is basically, we basically said, you can't buy russian oil anymore. So Europe is going to have an abysmal winter unless it becomes the warmest winter in history.
00:06:51.646 - 00:06:52.794, Speaker B: Europe's in trouble.
00:06:55.814 - 00:07:30.104, Speaker A: You can just look at a series of policy blunders that we've made over the years, the last few years that have led us to this point. But to a certain degree, it was kind of inevitable just because of the dollar's position in the market. So now the question is, the Fed has become a horrible trailing indicator for the current state of affairs. They look at inflation, core inflation data, CPI, and things anyway, things like rent, which are always going to come last. Inflation has hit a brick wall. The economy in the US has hit a brick wall.
00:07:31.084 - 00:07:34.196, Speaker B: And they will admit it probably when.
00:07:34.220 - 00:07:38.252, Speaker A: We'Re in month five of the recession, you're going to basically hear them kind.
00:07:38.268 - 00:07:40.196, Speaker B: Of pat themselves on the back where.
00:07:40.220 - 00:07:51.492, Speaker A: They basically say, okay, mission accomplished. We see that the core data is now aligned with our stated goal of getting inflation into control. And we're going to pause and watch what happens when they say that.
00:07:51.588 - 00:07:56.504, Speaker B: What they actually mean is we're all fucked. The economy hit a wall months ago.
00:07:56.884 - 00:07:58.824, Speaker A: And we don't know what to do next.
00:07:59.284 - 00:07:59.620, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:59.652 - 00:08:00.700, Speaker A: But we're certainly not going to keep.
00:08:00.732 - 00:08:03.444, Speaker B: Raising rates and we're actually pretty close to that.
00:08:03.604 - 00:08:03.900, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:03.932 - 00:08:23.220, Speaker A: If you look at the IMS data, it's basically going to like, it looks like it's ready to fall off a cliff. Supply chains are basically saying, you know, factory orders are basically way out of whack with reality and that inventories are going to go through the roof and it's going to be an ugly Christmas. So I don't know, but if that's.
00:08:23.252 - 00:08:28.212, Speaker B: All true, but that's kind of my base case right now, is that the.
00:08:28.228 - 00:08:30.916, Speaker A: Economy has hit a brick wall and the next four months are going to be ugly.
00:08:31.020 - 00:08:44.220, Speaker D: Economy hits a brick wall, next four months are going to be ugly. You tweeted last week, look for short term weakness in risk on assets, but then look for the big fed pause in Q four. After that, it's game on. What does that mean?
00:08:44.412 - 00:08:49.548, Speaker A: So the big fed pause is what I just said when they basically have no choice.
00:08:49.716 - 00:08:52.436, Speaker D: Stop yanking interest rates up right now.
00:08:52.500 - 00:09:02.444, Speaker A: The market is basically assuming that that's going to happen now. And it scares me a little bit. But for the most part, the path of pain, as Ral likes to say.
00:09:02.484 - 00:09:04.504, Speaker B: For most assets right now is up.
00:09:04.844 - 00:09:24.994, Speaker A: And I think the markets are going to seek the path of optimum pain here. And I do think that the Fed is going to have no choice but to pause. I thought it would come in September. Now I think it's going to be either November or December. I think the markets are pricing in high threes, maybe 4% before the pause comes.
00:09:25.154 - 00:09:26.774, Speaker B: At that point.
00:09:27.194 - 00:09:31.298, Speaker A: And maybe even leading up to that, I think we're going to see a.
00:09:31.386 - 00:09:35.818, Speaker B: Big, fast move up in risk on assets.
00:09:35.866 - 00:09:46.426, Speaker A: Now, I'm not day trading this. That's not my job. Most of our clients don't want to day trade this. So the point for them being that, hey, we can accept the fact that there may be a little bit of.
00:09:46.450 - 00:09:54.140, Speaker B: Short term volatility, slightly off the lows from the summer, but the 30 year.
00:09:54.172 - 00:10:05.964, Speaker A: Kind of downward channel in interest rates is going to get back on track because the Fed is going to have no choice via this pause but to admit what they've done. And even if they don't use those words, and it's going to be game.
00:10:06.004 - 00:10:07.704, Speaker B: On for risk on assets at that point.
00:10:08.164 - 00:10:15.506, Speaker D: Interesting. So you think that this all happens, that this all comes to fruition? Probably like latter half of this year, maybe early half of next year.
00:10:15.620 - 00:10:41.874, Speaker A: Oh, I'd be shocked if it took until next summer, but I would say the last year to drop will be unemployment. And the rate of job openings is now plummeting. And I think we're going to basically see actual full employment percentages plummet going into the Q one, and we'll see if they wait until then. My guess is that we get the pause in sometime between November and January.
00:10:42.214 - 00:10:44.598, Speaker B: Um, you know, we'll see.
00:10:44.766 - 00:11:06.534, Speaker D: Where is the. So, like, if you read Dalio's book, you've got this, like, the. The big cycle behind, like, empires rising and falling. You've got, like, new world order kicks it off. Then you've got, like, prosperity, debt, big debt bubble. Uh, and then, like, it's kind of like, peaks out with this, like, big wealth gap, which then, like, tips over into this debt bust. Uh, I think Dalio would argue that china's, like, going up right now.
00:11:06.534 - 00:11:38.232, Speaker D: They're in the big debt bubble. Big wealth gap is coming. Us is on the other side of the debt bus. So us is like, we started printing money and credit. The next phase would be obviously, what Dalio would say is revolution and war, which then leads to debt and political restructuring and then new world order. Sometimes one of my issues maybe, that I take with the bitcoin, the very core, hardcore bitcoin crowd, is that to. For bitcoin to have success or.
00:11:38.232 - 00:11:57.136, Speaker D: It's almost like the worst the US does. You're almost like, rooting against the US. You end up, like, when you are have a disproportionate amount of your wealth in bitcoin, you almost end up rooting against the US. And you're like, yes, like war, like revolution, like the failure of the US dollar. That would mean bitcoin would go up to a million dollars. Do you like. I'm curious how you.
00:11:57.136 - 00:11:57.800, Speaker D: Just how you think.
00:11:57.832 - 00:12:24.780, Speaker A: I get your point. I have a lot of, I'd call them crypto friends who are, at their core, hardcore anarchists. And I don't root for the dollar to fail. I don't root for any economy to fail. I think I'm a realist and I recognize that when you're basically creating a bond market driven debt bubble like the one that we've been creating for the.
00:12:24.812 - 00:12:29.348, Speaker B: Last 45 years, that it's unsustainable, it.
00:12:29.356 - 00:12:33.238, Speaker A: Has nothing to do with your political ideology. It's mathematics.
00:12:33.286 - 00:12:36.794, Speaker B: And so I have this kind of.
00:12:37.734 - 00:12:40.982, Speaker A: Visceral reaction to like, yeah, it's finally going to fail.
00:12:41.118 - 00:12:44.430, Speaker B: To know we can still fix this, right?
00:12:44.462 - 00:12:51.510, Speaker A: We could adopt a hard money standard, gold or something else, or do something else, or adopt digital money that you can't inflate.
00:12:51.622 - 00:12:53.594, Speaker B: Now, I don't think that's going to happen.
00:12:54.254 - 00:13:08.930, Speaker A: I think they're going to let it fail and they'll figure out a way to restructure debt and, you know, and the US won't be the power that it was because we won't be able to settle transactions in dollars at global scale like we can today and maintain reserve currency status. And I think we're 15 years away.
00:13:09.002 - 00:13:10.322, Speaker B: Which is not a long time.
00:13:10.458 - 00:13:14.634, Speaker A: I think we're 15 to 20 years away from that happening. And the question back to your original.
00:13:14.674 - 00:13:17.874, Speaker B: Point is, is there going to be war? I don't know.
00:13:17.994 - 00:13:32.172, Speaker A: I don't want it to happen. I have no reason to believe that this time is any different since, you know, it's like the matrix or in the 23rd version of the Matrix. Well, we're on the 15th version of trying to create sound money, and we keep failing, but we keep failing for the same reasons.
00:13:32.228 - 00:13:34.704, Speaker B: And there is an out this time.
00:13:35.004 - 00:13:41.212, Speaker A: I just don't think that the powers that be feel any incentive whatsoever than to continue the course that we're on.
00:13:41.348 - 00:14:12.464, Speaker D: Yeah, it's funny when I see things like tornado cash and like the US sanctioning tornado cache, this feels like I just went whitewater rafting. So I'm going to use a rafting analogy here, which is like, I feel like the US has fallen out of the boat. They're going down these like class four rapids. They've fallen out of the boat and they're like grabbing onto the shore and like grabbing onto these like twigs, and the twigs almost just like they can't. They can't hang on. And like, that's what it feels like when I see them doing things like trying to sanction tornado cash, like, you guys have fallen out of the boat, you're just trying to hang on.
00:14:12.624 - 00:14:12.920, Speaker C: Sure.
00:14:12.952 - 00:14:13.632, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:14:13.768 - 00:14:14.016, Speaker B: Sure.
00:14:14.040 - 00:14:21.368, Speaker A: There's so much wag the dog politics that goes on right now. And it's, and again, we didn't invent this. If you go back in history in.
00:14:21.376 - 00:14:23.228, Speaker B: These stages, it's happened many times.
00:14:23.276 - 00:14:39.492, Speaker A: I mean, all of the kind of focus on SEC enforcement of crypto companies. And like you said, let's sanction software. Sanction software. How do you sanction software? It's out there like the RIAA tried to sanction bittorrent.
00:14:39.508 - 00:14:40.748, Speaker B: It didn't work out too well.
00:14:40.916 - 00:14:42.892, Speaker A: And this is more resilient than that.
00:14:43.028 - 00:14:45.396, Speaker B: So what is your plan?
00:14:45.580 - 00:14:52.270, Speaker A: Well, obviously the plan is we don't have a plan except to basically divert attention from the eye of Mordor towards.
00:14:52.452 - 00:14:53.858, Speaker B: You know, something else.
00:14:53.906 - 00:15:00.242, Speaker A: And I guess tornado cash right now is something else. I'm not saying that tornado cash isn't to the wag the dog concept.
00:15:00.298 - 00:15:03.134, Speaker B: It's not used for anything nefarious.
00:15:03.834 - 00:15:07.522, Speaker A: But any technology tool is used for something nefarious.
00:15:07.618 - 00:15:09.938, Speaker B: Anything. I don't care what it is.
00:15:10.106 - 00:15:10.506, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:10.570 - 00:15:20.734, Speaker A: Are we going to outlaw pencils? Because I could, if you were standing next to me, I could stab you in the eye with a pencil, you know? So obviously this has not been well thought through.
00:15:22.764 - 00:15:25.884, Speaker B: But the bigger point is, what's the plan?
00:15:26.044 - 00:15:27.852, Speaker A: What's the broader plan here?
00:15:27.988 - 00:15:29.300, Speaker B: And there is none.
00:15:29.492 - 00:16:13.424, Speaker D: Remind me to take a look to see if you have a pencil in your hand next time I stand next to you at desk. I'll keep an eye on that. But I do want to get your take. Actually, I want to go a little deeper into crypto here. Speaking of bitcoin, one thing I've been debating on calls with Mike recently, and we've been trying to talk through this is like, uh, almost just like, what is the narrative for bitcoin? And what is. I mean, narrative is kind of a fluffy word, but like the investment thesis, you know, the ethic, uh, bitcoin correlation is like, it's going back to what looks like highs that we haven't seen since, like 2017, like the height of the bull market. But we're also in the, in the depths of the bear, usually in the depths of a bear, uh, you would see the bit, you know, bitcoin, uh, doing much better than, than ETH, but you're not seeing that this time around.
00:16:13.424 - 00:16:24.746, Speaker D: And like, we're, we're heading into the merge. Uh, you've got, like, all the narrative, the conversation is around ethereum. And it just kind of makes me think about, like, what is the thesis for bitcoin right now in your mind?
00:16:24.850 - 00:16:25.090, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:25.122 - 00:16:35.250, Speaker A: So I have a very clear vision in my mind about where bitcoin wants to go and where ethereum wants to go and why, and they will explain that.
00:16:35.322 - 00:16:37.378, Speaker B: But to your comment about, about the.
00:16:37.466 - 00:16:40.410, Speaker A: Price movements and correlation, I do think.
00:16:40.442 - 00:16:42.888, Speaker B: They will diverge at some point.
00:16:42.936 - 00:17:06.080, Speaker A: I don't know whether it's going to be three months or three years or 30 years, and I don't really care that much because my macro thesis points that both of them going higher for different reasons over time. For me, bitcoin is basically fully committed to being the base layer of a hard monetary system, and ethereum is fully committed to being the decentralized Internet, the application layer for decentralized Internet as hard money.
00:17:06.232 - 00:17:08.929, Speaker B: It's very hard to change. You know, you can't change the atomic.
00:17:08.961 - 00:17:30.937, Speaker A: Structure of gold, for example, and it should be not equally hard, but extremely hard because it's software to change that base layer of this new monetary system that bitcoin wants to be. And hence no appetite, obviously, for anything other than proof of work, which I totally understand. There should have been an appetite for increasing the block size. I was on the wrong side of that debate.
00:17:31.065 - 00:17:32.001, Speaker B: I still don't think I was wrong.
00:17:32.017 - 00:17:33.453, Speaker A: I just lost. There's a difference.
00:17:35.553 - 00:17:38.604, Speaker D: You think bitcoin should have increased the. Should have increased 100%.
00:17:39.024 - 00:17:44.096, Speaker A: There's zero. There's just as little doubt of mine today as there was back then.
00:17:44.240 - 00:17:47.440, Speaker D: Oh, really? Wait, can you tell me more about that?
00:17:47.512 - 00:17:48.764, Speaker B: Oh, Occam's razor.
00:17:49.304 - 00:18:24.684, Speaker A: The simplest answer to scaling bitcoin is not. By the way, Taproot is an amazing innovation and upgrade for bitcoin. I have no problem with snor signatures and all the other things that improve bitcoin over time, even though they're hard and they are a little complex. The path of least resistance is to increase the block size, which Satoshi herself, himself wrote about many, many times in very clear terms. How Moore's law supports the scaling of bitcoin to a certain degree at the base layer, completely ignored. No one is interested in it, and so it's fine. I've forgotten about it for the most part, and I move on.
00:18:24.684 - 00:18:53.510, Speaker A: But as the base layer of money, it needs a modicum of scalability at the base layer. But we've put all of our eggs in the kind of bank lightning basket for scalability of bitcoin, with the base layer being relatively small. And it is what it is. But that's independent of how a billion people can access bitcoin.
00:18:53.662 - 00:18:55.358, Speaker B: It is sound money.
00:18:55.486 - 00:19:23.454, Speaker A: It's past the. Gavin used to refer to bitcoin as a test in 1314, maybe even up to 15. Nobody refers to bitcoin as a test anymore. Since it's here, since it has real world use, since it is used in Ukraine, in Venezuela, and Turkey, and people are reliant on it, it's incumbent upon us to make sure it has zero downtime is secure, and it just works.
00:19:23.494 - 00:19:24.274, Speaker C: And it does.
00:19:24.654 - 00:19:25.230, Speaker B: Why didn't.
00:19:25.262 - 00:19:51.624, Speaker D: Can you take me? I don't want to get too sidetracked by the block size wars. There's probably a whole podcast, an entire show that you could do around this, like several different episodes. But I mean, this was kind of a war that rattle that waged on from like, what, mid 2015 to the end of 2017, concluding in probably like November, December 2017. Why didn't your like, what happened here? Can you just kind of conclude the story for folks who are maybe newer to the space?
00:19:51.784 - 00:20:10.996, Speaker A: There's a really, really good book on it. I don't agree with the way the book was written in terms of, like, it's very supportive of the site that won. But ultimately, in my opinion, what it came down to is there was this corporate faction of exchanges, folks like myself, wallets, and then there was the developer.
00:20:11.180 - 00:20:13.388, Speaker B: Kind of anarchist faction, okay?
00:20:13.516 - 00:21:06.504, Speaker A: And the corporate faction wanted the block size increase. They recognized that the utility of bitcoin over time was going to decrease. The fees for on chain transactions were skyrocketing. I remember when mining fees or network fees per transaction were averaging like $40 in late 17. And at that point, everything just changed in terms of the utility of bitcoin. And then there was this kind of backdoor agreement to basically increase the block size after we activated segwit. And that agreement was really only done with this kind of corporate side of bitcoin supporters and really had no deep interaction with the core developer community node operators.
00:21:06.504 - 00:21:51.936, Speaker A: Some miners were involved. And so people felt like, hey, because bitcoin has no CEO, because bitcoin is not a company, how is it that you group of corporate types are thrusting this solution on top of us? And who are you, right? You're not bitcoin. And they're 100% right in that regard. The way that the corporate part of this community tried to hammer the upgrade on top of the rest of the world was its fatal flaw. And that never should have happened. And my guess is that if we had figured out a way as a community to have an intelligent discussion, we would probably much bigger blocks today, and we wouldn't be having this discussion because it wouldn't have been a corporate driven thing anyway. There's a couple of actually pretty good.
00:21:51.960 - 00:21:52.768, Speaker B: Books on this already.
00:21:52.896 - 00:22:06.604, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll put a show, I think it's. Jonathan Beer wrote a book on this. We'll throw a link in the show notes. I mean, let me. Not about the block size words, but does that make you skeptical if you think that the community made the wrong decision here, bill, does that make you skeptical on, like, dow decision making?
00:22:07.264 - 00:22:07.912, Speaker A: No.
00:22:08.048 - 00:22:08.392, Speaker B: No.
00:22:08.448 - 00:22:09.328, Speaker A: Because it's competition.
00:22:09.376 - 00:22:09.560, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:09.592 - 00:22:40.932, Speaker A: So the difference is that you can have a million daos trying to do the same thing and all basically come to different conclusions via vote on what they should try. And it's like, it's the same as evolution over time. Different changes give you different benefits depending upon what environment you live in. And hopefully the cream rises to the top and the strongest survive. Bitcoin is a little bit different because it has network effects. It's hard money. There's not a lot of competition for that right now.
00:22:40.932 - 00:23:01.852, Speaker A: And so that leads to this prevailing perspective that it shouldn't change. It should be as close to its structure for all time. And changes are slow and hard. And conceptually, I do agree with that. But the idea of changing the block size is not about changing bitcoin itself.
00:23:01.908 - 00:23:02.704, Speaker C: It's not.
00:23:03.284 - 00:23:18.148, Speaker A: And so the ability to change a block size is actually a built in feature. So there's a two different. So your question is a little bit of a non sequitur, because I'm not really talking about changing the structure of bitcoin.
00:23:18.236 - 00:23:18.812, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:18.948 - 00:23:45.974, Speaker D: Interesting. I want to get back to Ethan bitcoin bill, because what I'm really leading to here is I'm almost pushing us down this proverbial thought funnel into this huge announcement that you guys have coming up, which I don't want to unveil yet. I want to hold back on that for a second. But I do want to get your take on. Just make. I just want to make sure I understand your thesis here. It sounds like your thesis is that crypto is the future of, like, future of banking and finance will be built on crypto rails.
00:23:45.974 - 00:24:00.612, Speaker D: Crypto based banking is the future of financial systems. In this system, bitcoin will be used as collateral. ETH will be used as, like, the transaction layer and the token layer, and things will get built on top of Ethereum. Am I. Am I, like, understanding your thesis correctly?
00:24:00.778 - 00:24:01.624, Speaker A: Fantastic.
00:24:01.704 - 00:24:02.924, Speaker B: I need to record you.
00:24:04.864 - 00:24:05.744, Speaker A: Totally agree.
00:24:05.864 - 00:24:06.792, Speaker B: Yeah, you nailed it.
00:24:06.888 - 00:24:17.960, Speaker D: I mean, in the. So in this system, like, when you look at things, like, you know, we talk a lot about makerdao on the show, or, like, compound or Ave, or some of these, like, blue chip tier one defi protocols.
00:24:18.112 - 00:24:18.520, Speaker C: The.
00:24:18.592 - 00:24:30.168, Speaker D: The collateral is. It's not bitcoin, it's. It's ETH. Right. So do you think that, like, eventually bitcoin gets, like, all bitcoin gets wrapped and moves on? Moves on chain? Like, I almost want to talk more tactically about how that actually happens.
00:24:30.168 - 00:24:30.424, Speaker C: About.
00:24:30.424 - 00:24:39.792, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's a fantastic question. That's why I think products like thor chain are really interesting, because then you can start to do things like cross.
00:24:39.848 - 00:24:42.968, Speaker B: Chain in a way that don't break the core tenets.
00:24:43.016 - 00:24:49.576, Speaker A: Meaning if you have to basically wrap bitcoin and trust a central custodian in order to use bitcoin as collateral and.
00:24:49.600 - 00:24:53.368, Speaker B: Defi, you're defeating the purpose of having.
00:24:53.416 - 00:24:59.928, Speaker A: DeFi because now you've created an unnecessary weak link in the chain, which is the trusted third party holding all the bitcoin.
00:25:00.056 - 00:25:00.608, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:00.736 - 00:25:44.950, Speaker A: And so I think some of these kind of cross chain protocols will be able to deal with bitcoin collateral using smart contract based models over time. And that's the promise of some of this stuff to me for composability and other. We'll see. But it's very complicated, it's very early. But I also think that there is a case to be made that for certain types of transactions, using ETH as collateral is okay. So the two aren't necessarily at odds with each other. And ethereum, I think, is going to go up in price because of all the use cases, because of the fact that it's really become deflationary ahead of where bitcoin is, et cetera, et cetera.
00:25:44.950 - 00:25:46.958, Speaker A: But it's never going to be sound.
00:25:47.006 - 00:25:50.926, Speaker B: Hard money the way bitcoin is or.
00:25:50.950 - 00:25:57.158, Speaker A: Is becoming, simply because of this philosophy that as the future application layer of.
00:25:57.166 - 00:25:59.080, Speaker B: The Internet, it needs to evolve to.
00:25:59.112 - 00:26:10.272, Speaker A: Meet all of the requirements of the application layer of the Internet. And those requirements are changing over time, and we haven't even gotten to scalability yet. That's coming next after the merge.
00:26:10.448 - 00:26:57.682, Speaker D: As an empire listener, you know the power of stable coins, these dollar digital currencies that transcend borders, banking hours and legacy financial rails Circle's USDC has quickly become one of the most trusted and widely used stable coins in our entire industry. It's simple. People use USDC because of its composability, stability and reserve transparency. And USDC isn't only adopted by us empire. Defi, degens, Daos, nft marketplaces. Crypto companies leverage USDC to diversify their treasury, asset management and ecosystem wide composability this adoption is evident in USDC's growth. They've grown to more than $50 billion in circulation since launching USDC just four years ago in 2018.
00:26:57.682 - 00:27:44.826, Speaker D: We all have and will continue to take shots on our favorite cryptos, but USDC remains one of the easiest ways to store your funds in a reliable, stable asset that can be used to send value around the world, almost instantly lowers the cost of cross border payments and integrates into the growing ecosystem of web3 apps and DeFi applications. As a seamless, trusted dollar digital currency, USDC is a zero to one opportunity for the global financial system. Learn more about Circle and USDC by checking out the link in the show notes. Now back to the show. Let's tie Abra into all of this, right? This we've got global macro, we've got the end of this 80 year debt cycle, we've got your thesis on bitcoin as collateral. ETH is this transaction layer. We've got defi that's getting built, and then obviously we have Abram.
00:27:44.826 - 00:28:18.622, Speaker D: It's been a really rocky time in crypto for some of the centralized platforms, and there are some that honestly didn't make it through this through and won't make it through this bear market. You guys have done incredibly well, it seems like through this, I mean, you guys have processed over like 7 billion in transactions. I think you're in 150 countries, you've got, these are probably old numbers, but 2 million users, a couple billion under management, you guys seem to have done incredibly well. I'm curious, how did you guys do so well through the bear market when some of your competitors not only struggled, but a couple of them went under?
00:28:18.798 - 00:28:34.830, Speaker A: Sure. So this is something that I predicted was going to happen. If you go back and look at other interviews I've done, and it wasn't just me trying to slam competitors, it was me watching cowboyish banking practices with.
00:28:34.902 - 00:28:38.752, Speaker B: No sense of risk management and, you.
00:28:38.768 - 00:28:47.944, Speaker A: Know, ethical practices and unethical practices in many cases. But let me take a step back. So we built Abra as the crypto banking service that we wanted for ourselves.
00:28:48.104 - 00:28:49.728, Speaker B: So I said, okay, I'm going to.
00:28:49.736 - 00:28:51.616, Speaker A: Do one of two things. I'm going to build the service I.
00:28:51.640 - 00:28:53.456, Speaker B: Want, or I'm just going to basically.
00:28:53.560 - 00:29:26.684, Speaker A: Make it work via hardware wallets and Defi, and do a whole bunch of stuff that I don't want to have to do. And so we basically designed Abra to have the ability to earn yield, the ability to trade, the ability to borrow against holdings. We're launching a credit card. My goal for this year was originally to be able to turn off my bank account and have Abra become my default bank account. We're inching closer. The credit card that we announced with Amex is getting us very close. And then there's some other cash features that we'll be adding later, but we're getting closer to that.
00:29:26.684 - 00:29:36.896, Speaker A: On top of that, you have the responsibility as a crypto bank for, you know, tried and true risk management practices which aren't crypto specific.
00:29:36.960 - 00:29:39.672, Speaker B: There are pieces that are crypto specific.
00:29:39.728 - 00:29:48.512, Speaker A: When you're doing things like DeFi to generate yield. But collateralized lending has been around for decades. This is not a new concept.
00:29:48.688 - 00:29:49.024, Speaker C: Right?
00:29:49.064 - 00:29:50.624, Speaker A: I mean, look at long term capital.
00:29:50.704 - 00:29:52.524, Speaker B: Management in the nineties.
00:29:53.064 - 00:29:59.552, Speaker A: What happened in the last few months and over the spring and summer looks and smells exactly like that. The fact that it was crypto versus.
00:29:59.608 - 00:30:01.004, Speaker B: Equities makes no difference.
00:30:01.454 - 00:30:19.318, Speaker A: So that's why Abra has managed to thrive in this environment, because we recognized from the beginning that these risk management practices were going to be necessary in order to have a long term view of where crypto is going as the future of banking.
00:30:19.486 - 00:30:39.384, Speaker D: All right, so we've got Abra set up. You've had amazing success in all these different areas. You've got the private wealth management division. You've got the retail side of the business, what I would call, like the prosumer. You've got the institutional side up and running. You had this goal to create, to basically unbank yourself, which I think is a good goal. It's a good product vision, I would say, to be able to use it yourself.
00:30:39.384 - 00:30:57.158, Speaker D: What was the missing step to unbanking yourself? Because I think a lot of folks have had that. A lot of you guys might have had that for years. Your competitors might have had that. But there's always this missing link of having, I'll let you fill in the gaps. But what has been missing, I guess, lead us into what you guys are launching.
00:30:57.246 - 00:31:32.630, Speaker A: So I think this idea of kind of unbank yourself is not really realistic. Also, nobody really, the average consumer, anyway, doesn't think that way. The average consumer says, okay, am I getting a high quality service? Am I getting access to my investments? If I want to invest in crypto, do I trust my bank? First of all, are they doing right by me? And I think the issue with the banking system is that a lot of people don't trust the banks. The banks don't want to have a certain type of customer because of all.
00:31:32.662 - 00:31:35.294, Speaker B: These kind of draconian compliance and risk.
00:31:35.334 - 00:31:48.246, Speaker A: Issues that they're faced with and dealing with constantly. So what I wanted is I want to basically have a cryptocentric service for managing my money, making payments, because I believe that's the future of banking, and.
00:31:48.270 - 00:31:50.504, Speaker B: We want to lead the way in that.
00:31:50.544 - 00:31:57.192, Speaker A: And so that's how we've kind of looked at this, you know, unbank yourself model. I wanted to be able to turn.
00:31:57.248 - 00:32:03.624, Speaker B: Off my bank account, not because I want to live in a cash economy. I want to live in a cryptocentric.
00:32:03.664 - 00:32:17.800, Speaker A: Economy because I believe that's the future. I believe it gives me more choice around lending. It gives me a stable monetary asset to hold my money in over time. It gives me access to be able to have a single kind of source.
00:32:17.832 - 00:32:20.856, Speaker B: Of truth for everything that I do.
00:32:21.040 - 00:32:28.624, Speaker A: Versus the current system. And I'm hopefully not going to have my account turned off because I'm buying.
00:32:28.664 - 00:32:32.084, Speaker B: Bitcoin with my debit card, which I hear every day.
00:32:33.824 - 00:32:35.960, Speaker A: That's what it means to us to.
00:32:35.992 - 00:32:37.912, Speaker B: Be crypto first cryptocentric.
00:32:38.048 - 00:32:57.732, Speaker D: So what was the blocker? Basically, because I know a lot of folks have tried to do this, but what was the blocker to actually becoming this crypto centric bank that, you know, if I'm using Wells Fargo or Bank of America like I do, still, you can put more and more capital onto platforms, but, like, I still need to have a bank account for a lot of different things.
00:32:57.828 - 00:33:12.024, Speaker A: It's a combination of embracing the right regulations. We're a global company, so it's not just in the US, but embracing the right regulatory models globally, putting the services in place that deal with what 80%.
00:33:12.204 - 00:33:14.432, Speaker B: Of a user needs to do with their bank account.
00:33:14.568 - 00:33:14.816, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:14.840 - 00:33:19.040, Speaker A: So you need to be able to pay your bills, get your deposits, buy.
00:33:19.072 - 00:33:21.040, Speaker B: Stuff at the point of sale, get.
00:33:21.072 - 00:33:27.000, Speaker A: Access to credit when you need it, school loans, car loans, mortgage, et cetera, et cetera.
00:33:27.032 - 00:33:29.016, Speaker B: So those are all the pieces that.
00:33:29.040 - 00:33:32.896, Speaker A: You'Re going to see over time. We have people using crypto as credit.
00:33:32.920 - 00:33:35.832, Speaker B: Today to take out million dollar loans.
00:33:35.968 - 00:33:53.552, Speaker A: At very low interest rates, or in some cases, 0% interest, using bitcoin as collateral. We announced the American Express card, which we're going to launch, targeting q four. That will allow you to make purchases using either crypto as collateral or your existing credit report, or both. All of these things needed to be.
00:33:53.608 - 00:33:56.624, Speaker B: Very well thought through to get Abra.
00:33:56.664 - 00:34:09.593, Speaker A: To the next step, which we're obviously announcing today. It's a never ending game, meaning we're going to be at this for years. I think we're going to leapfrog the traditional banking system in the next few.
00:34:09.633 - 00:34:11.373, Speaker B: Months, is my prediction.
00:34:12.393 - 00:34:31.073, Speaker D: So is your goal to have folks, like, right now? Again, for me, I have traditional, like, I would call them traditional bank accounts, like a Bank of America or a chase or a Wells Fargo account, and then I've got my Abra account and others. Is the goal to basically help folks move away from the Wells Fargo and the bank of America and Chase?
00:34:31.193 - 00:34:32.345, Speaker B: Eventually, yeah.
00:34:32.489 - 00:34:57.728, Speaker A: I think when you see how stable coins work now, how you can earn yield on stable coins, how you'll be able to use stable coins for a combination of cash payments with finality, where you might, as a merchant, offer a discount, where there's no reversal to something like credit based payments, where you can borrow against bitcoin, where there is the opportunity for reversing a charge per normal American Express, Visa, Mastercard, network standards.
00:34:57.896 - 00:35:00.320, Speaker B: All of that is possible with crypto.
00:35:00.392 - 00:35:18.854, Speaker A: And not with a traditional bank. Now, some of that you can do with Metamask and Defi today, if you're not only initiated, but you're very technically astute, you can deal with key management, we call it. If you have a PhD in metamask and you can deal with the madness, that's fine. But the opportunity for a billion people.
00:35:19.194 - 00:35:21.914, Speaker B: Is to become the bank that does.
00:35:21.954 - 00:35:24.834, Speaker A: What metamask enables with a simple user.
00:35:24.874 - 00:35:28.402, Speaker B: Experience, key management built in, so that.
00:35:28.418 - 00:35:33.434, Speaker A: You don't have to know anything about it. But one of the core tenets should be, I could take my stuff offline.
00:35:33.474 - 00:35:37.330, Speaker B: Whenever I want, even if I'm trusting the bank for when they are managing.
00:35:37.362 - 00:35:44.242, Speaker A: My stuff, and they're right size in terms of regulation, and that's what we're moving towards.
00:35:44.298 - 00:35:44.562, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:44.618 - 00:35:50.802, Speaker A: I see Abras future as basically the crypto bank that basically says, we're going to do what Metamask does, but we're.
00:35:50.818 - 00:35:52.146, Speaker B: Going to make it trivially easy.
00:35:52.250 - 00:35:59.730, Speaker A: You're not going to see all of this nonsensical, what's my backup phrase? How do I sign this transaction to move forward all the stuff that people.
00:35:59.762 - 00:36:03.054, Speaker B: Don'T understand, and that's going to become the bank of the future.
00:36:03.554 - 00:36:37.322, Speaker D: It really. So it feels like there's one of the biggest. Santiago and I talk about this a lot. There's this big dichotomy in crypto between leaning in becoming regulated, KYC, AML, basically setting up your company for success in the United States and capturing as large of a market as possible. The other side of it is staying as decentralized as possible, creating a very censorship resistant system at the expense of. Of users. And, like, I would honestly say a good example of this is, like, fellow OG Eric Voorhees, who I'm assuming you know decently well, just, we know each.
00:36:37.338 - 00:36:38.346, Speaker A: Other quite well in the space.
00:36:38.410 - 00:36:58.284, Speaker D: Like, he opted for the censorship resistant, decentralized route, lost probably 98% of users, but, like, kept the, like, I don't know, like, the tried and true, like, crypto ethos. So I'm just curious, like, how you. When you, like. I just. I don't know. I'm trying to figure out the question here. Like, how do you measure those two?
00:36:58.744 - 00:37:03.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I think trust is a spectrum, and I think the need for trustlessness.
00:37:03.152 - 00:37:16.104, Speaker B: Is also a spectrum. And that need goes from Venezuela, Ukraine, Turkey, to us, Singapore, you know, Switzerland on the other side.
00:37:16.264 - 00:37:27.438, Speaker A: And within that entire spectrum of the need for trustless systems and the need for decentralization, there are going to be pockets of users all the way on.
00:37:27.566 - 00:37:29.398, Speaker B: My right here that are still going.
00:37:29.406 - 00:37:30.982, Speaker A: To want to be their own bank.
00:37:31.038 - 00:37:32.838, Speaker B: Via hardware wallets, because they can, and.
00:37:32.846 - 00:37:41.086, Speaker A: They understand what I just said. Whereas the vast majority of people have no idea what a hardware wallet is, what a private key is, even with.
00:37:41.150 - 00:37:46.306, Speaker B: Bitcoin at 600 million market cap, they have no idea. Okay?
00:37:46.450 - 00:37:51.250, Speaker A: And so the role of a crypto bank should be to provide those on.
00:37:51.282 - 00:37:54.106, Speaker B: Ramps and off ramps, provide high quality.
00:37:54.170 - 00:38:08.434, Speaker A: Services that I can get myself via a hardware wallet or metamask if I know what I'm doing via Defi and other lending compound and other protocols. But to eliminate the complexity of having to understand how those protocols work, from my user experience, all I'm saying is.
00:38:08.514 - 00:38:10.058, Speaker B: You want to borrow, here's the interest.
00:38:10.106 - 00:38:12.186, Speaker A: Rate, here's the collateral requirements, here's the contract.
00:38:12.250 - 00:38:13.054, Speaker C: Sign it.
00:38:13.604 - 00:38:18.684, Speaker B: You want to earn yield, here's the product, here's what we do with your.
00:38:18.724 - 00:38:20.940, Speaker A: Collateral that you're depositing, here's how much you earn.
00:38:21.052 - 00:38:21.916, Speaker B: Here are the terms.
00:38:22.020 - 00:38:22.804, Speaker A: Here's the contract.
00:38:22.884 - 00:38:23.704, Speaker C: Sign it.
00:38:25.884 - 00:38:28.964, Speaker A: We can disclose what protocols we may be using if you want to dig.
00:38:29.004 - 00:38:32.624, Speaker B: In, to either you as the consumer.
00:38:33.124 - 00:38:35.412, Speaker A: Or the regulator who's overseeing that space.
00:38:35.468 - 00:38:37.452, Speaker B: On your behalf, because in banking, there's.
00:38:37.468 - 00:38:39.104, Speaker A: No such thing as caveat emptor.
00:38:39.794 - 00:38:42.242, Speaker B: The regulator plays that role whether we.
00:38:42.258 - 00:38:51.578, Speaker A: Like it or not. That's what it is. That's what they do. You're now disclosing those things to the regulator, who's saying, yes, we accept that it's okay that you're using this DeFi.
00:38:51.626 - 00:38:54.186, Speaker B: Protocol to generate yield, for example, or.
00:38:54.210 - 00:38:56.346, Speaker A: That you're basically doing collateralized lending to.
00:38:56.370 - 00:38:58.674, Speaker B: Generate yield, or that you're lending to.
00:38:58.714 - 00:39:20.294, Speaker A: Consumers who have deposited collateral with you and you're doing XYZ with the collateral. So that's the future of banking, in my opinion. Some people are calling it now like a web 2.5 approach, where web3 protocols are used with a web two interface, which gets you 75% of the way there from a decentralization perspective.
00:39:20.674 - 00:39:22.202, Speaker B: But the key in that point, pardon.
00:39:22.218 - 00:39:23.922, Speaker A: My pun, is that you still have.
00:39:23.938 - 00:39:26.290, Speaker B: To be able to take possession of.
00:39:26.322 - 00:39:39.772, Speaker A: Your stuff whenever you want. That assumes, of course, you haven't given it to somebody as collateral, in which case that's fine. I mean, you accepted that risk when you did that. But if it's a savings account or a trading account or a liquid yield.
00:39:39.828 - 00:39:41.572, Speaker B: Generating account, I need to be able.
00:39:41.588 - 00:39:44.396, Speaker A: To take that stuff out 24/7 whenever I want.
00:39:44.540 - 00:39:48.184, Speaker B: And if I'm not able to do that, there's something wrong with your service.
00:39:48.524 - 00:39:49.028, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:49.116 - 00:40:09.082, Speaker D: So when you look at the Defi right now, you look at the compounds and aaves and makers and uniswaps of the world, do you see them eventually getting mass user adoption? Do you see them competing with the fintech companies, the neo banks, the traditional banks, or do you see them sitting in the background enabling services like Abra to generate yield and et cetera?
00:40:09.178 - 00:40:16.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I see it at scale as the latter. Because they'll never be able to reach the billions.
00:40:16.626 - 00:40:17.946, Speaker C: Never with the.
00:40:18.010 - 00:40:19.810, Speaker D: Because of the complexity or because of the regulations?
00:40:19.842 - 00:40:21.394, Speaker B: Because of the complexity.
00:40:21.554 - 00:40:22.254, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:22.994 - 00:40:39.102, Speaker A: I think outside the US, the US is 300. Let's round it up. 400 million people out of 8 billion. The vast majority of the planet does not worry about regulation as it relates to using all the services you just mentioned.
00:40:39.278 - 00:40:40.154, Speaker C: They don't.
00:40:41.494 - 00:40:46.974, Speaker A: So that's not the issue. That's not what's hindering the population. What's hindering the population is.
00:40:47.014 - 00:40:48.846, Speaker B: Okay, hey, mom, I'm going to get.
00:40:48.870 - 00:40:53.786, Speaker A: You set up to basically trade some crypto. First, go open up chrome. Oh, you don't use chrome.
00:40:53.850 - 00:40:57.786, Speaker B: Okay, install chrome. What's chrome? Okay, she knows what chrome is now.
00:40:57.890 - 00:40:59.738, Speaker A: Now you need to install this metamask.
00:40:59.786 - 00:41:01.738, Speaker B: Extension on your chrome browser.
00:41:01.786 - 00:41:02.258, Speaker A: Okay, great.
00:41:02.306 - 00:41:03.414, Speaker B: What's an extension?
00:41:03.994 - 00:41:05.130, Speaker A: You got it? You understand what it says?
00:41:05.162 - 00:41:06.414, Speaker B: Okay, what's metamask?
00:41:06.914 - 00:41:12.774, Speaker A: You see where we're going with this, right? So that's step two, by the way. I'm not even at step eight, nine and ten.
00:41:13.074 - 00:41:19.228, Speaker B: So you've already lost 95% of Joe and Jane public. All right, so the question.
00:41:19.316 - 00:41:22.184, Speaker A: But my mother uses, I think she uses bank of America.
00:41:23.964 - 00:41:25.276, Speaker B: I have a Bank of America app.
00:41:25.300 - 00:41:35.388, Speaker A: Can I use that? That's probably what she would ask me. Now, you could laugh at that question, and it is funny, but the reality is, when you think it through, it's a very logical question.
00:41:35.516 - 00:41:36.348, Speaker B: I have a bank account.
00:41:36.396 - 00:41:37.356, Speaker A: Why can't I use my bank account.
00:41:37.380 - 00:41:42.412, Speaker B: To do all the stuff you're talking about? We know why she can't, but it.
00:41:42.428 - 00:41:45.670, Speaker A: Doesn'T make sense to her. Okay, so we want to be that.
00:41:45.702 - 00:41:47.674, Speaker B: Bank of America for the next generation.
00:41:48.014 - 00:41:58.990, Speaker A: And that's going to need the services you just described. Now, to your question, I don't know if it's going to be sushi or aave. Are they going to have competitors that kill them? Are they going to scale?
00:41:59.062 - 00:41:59.994, Speaker B: Are they going to.
00:42:00.294 - 00:42:03.214, Speaker A: Are other companies that we have protocols we haven't thought of going to rule?
00:42:03.254 - 00:42:07.314, Speaker B: I don't know. That's one of the things I love about our space.
00:42:08.414 - 00:42:12.318, Speaker A: But those protocols, whatever they become, are the protocols that are going to be.
00:42:12.326 - 00:42:13.260, Speaker B: The future of banking.
00:42:13.382 - 00:42:25.004, Speaker D: What you guys just rolled out today, was this a tech challenge, a product challenge, a licensing challenge, regulatory challenge? Like, how did you go about? Almost like all of it, I'm assuming.
00:42:25.304 - 00:42:42.238, Speaker A: Yeah. So let me explain what we did in clear terms and what we're announcing, and then I'll put it all in context if that works. So today we're announcing a couple of things.
00:42:42.286 - 00:42:44.234, Speaker B: We're announcing the formation of Abrabank.
00:42:44.774 - 00:42:55.750, Speaker A: Abra bank is a us state chartered depository institution. It's in the process of being formed and it should be live either late.
00:42:55.782 - 00:42:57.326, Speaker B: This year or early next year.
00:42:57.510 - 00:43:13.706, Speaker A: All us users retail and our private banking and probably our institutional will be migrated to be customers of Aberbank. To my knowledge, it's the first. It will be the first depository institution dedicated to crypto live in the United States.
00:43:13.850 - 00:43:15.250, Speaker B: There are several trusts that are.
00:43:15.282 - 00:43:24.442, Speaker A: That are live, but there's no full depository institution. True bank live today in the United States. I believe this would be the first.
00:43:24.538 - 00:43:24.890, Speaker C: Okay.
00:43:24.922 - 00:43:54.282, Speaker A: It's something we've been working on for a couple of years, and then we have an international version of this, which is also actually going to be live sooner, probably in October. And most of our non us customers will become customers of Abra International, which is this new international license holder, which more or less mirrors the capabilities from a licensing perspective as its us counterparts. And to your question, this is a legal challenge which we worked on and are working on now for a couple of years.
00:43:54.378 - 00:43:58.074, Speaker B: It's a technical challenge, it's a marketing.
00:43:58.114 - 00:44:15.644, Speaker A: Challenge, because we have to explain all this. And every, you know, we're, I think we're like 165 people now. Every one of our employees is involved in some aspect of this, from support to sales, to technology, to our big legal and compliance team, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
00:44:16.304 - 00:44:35.360, Speaker D: I'll maybe give you a layup then, on the marketing side of things, because I'm assuming a lot of your users will be asking the question that I'm about to ask, which is depository institution. Congrats. Sounds really hard. I'm assuming this took multiple years. What does that mean for me, the user? Like, how does that make the user's experience different?
00:44:35.472 - 00:44:40.352, Speaker A: Okay, this basically answers the question you asked before, which is, am I going.
00:44:40.368 - 00:44:43.432, Speaker B: To use a bank where the protocols.
00:44:43.448 - 00:44:48.368, Speaker A: Are in the background, or am I going to access aave and compound and whatever directly?
00:44:48.496 - 00:44:49.000, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:49.112 - 00:44:53.736, Speaker A: And the answer is, in our opinion, the former for probably 99% of people.
00:44:53.880 - 00:44:56.552, Speaker B: You're going to access Abra bank and.
00:44:56.568 - 00:44:57.960, Speaker A: Within Abra bank, you're going to earn.
00:44:57.992 - 00:44:59.696, Speaker B: Yield, you're going to be able to.
00:44:59.720 - 00:45:01.728, Speaker A: Trade, you're going to be able to.
00:45:01.896 - 00:45:04.784, Speaker B: Borrow, and you're going to basically be.
00:45:04.824 - 00:45:07.712, Speaker A: Using something similar to metamask in the background.
00:45:07.808 - 00:45:09.004, Speaker C: You just won't know it.
00:45:09.784 - 00:45:26.012, Speaker A: That's the promise of DeFi and web3 for the masses with a very usable experience that is compliant with local laws when you need a trusted third party in the middle. Because I have no idea how to.
00:45:26.028 - 00:45:29.020, Speaker B: Use all this metamask stuff and use.
00:45:29.052 - 00:45:37.144, Speaker A: These protocols that you and I were talking about earlier. Abro wants to be that web3 bank for everyone.
00:45:38.164 - 00:45:39.104, Speaker C: That's it.
00:45:39.924 - 00:45:43.384, Speaker D: The ultimate Defi mullet, right? Defi in the back, fintech.
00:45:44.164 - 00:45:45.180, Speaker B: That's it.
00:45:45.372 - 00:45:46.084, Speaker C: That's it.
00:45:46.164 - 00:45:55.238, Speaker A: It's a composability system to put it back in DeFi terms today, that basically gives you a compelling user experience where.
00:45:55.406 - 00:45:59.670, Speaker B: We'Ll curate most things for you, but not everything.
00:45:59.742 - 00:46:02.366, Speaker A: We'll actually give you at some point.
00:46:02.430 - 00:46:04.262, Speaker B: A full web browser inside of the.
00:46:04.278 - 00:46:06.398, Speaker A: Average experience that lets you go to.
00:46:06.486 - 00:46:08.886, Speaker B: Any site on the web today that.
00:46:08.910 - 00:46:15.646, Speaker A: Would require something like a metamask or other service, but automatically uses your aver bank account so you don't need that.
00:46:15.830 - 00:46:19.954, Speaker B: Web metamask like experience, which everyone hates.
00:46:21.184 - 00:46:23.096, Speaker A: That's where this web3 bank is.
00:46:23.120 - 00:46:25.484, Speaker B: Headed, and we'll be there.
00:46:26.104 - 00:46:29.072, Speaker A: Most of that will be there this year, and pieces of it will continue.
00:46:29.128 - 00:46:30.936, Speaker B: To launch over the next year, including.
00:46:31.000 - 00:46:43.496, Speaker A: The credit card and NFT support and reward points as tokens via our CPRX system, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It's all coming together under this banking umbrella now, and it's just us giving.
00:46:43.520 - 00:46:45.260, Speaker B: Our customers what they've been asking for.
00:46:45.432 - 00:46:45.972, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:46.068 - 00:46:57.220, Speaker D: Now that you have these licenses, I mean, what, obviously it takes six to twelve months to roll all these products out, but what comes next? Do you guys make acquisitions? Do you guys, do you look to go public?
00:46:57.332 - 00:47:23.742, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, good question. So we're in final formations of these entities now. The bank will be live, we hope, in Q four, possibly q one. That's abra us version of Abra bank, and then the international version of Abrabank. Abra International should be live in October, and that will come first. And so there'll be lots of changes to, we're now calling Abran Abra boost as of today.
00:47:23.742 - 00:47:41.326, Speaker A: And that will be live in the app, I think, by the end of the month. And there'll be announcements around that. And so there's going to be a whole bunch of changes to have more ways of earning yield that are now compliant with local bank regulations. So all of these questions about how.
00:47:41.350 - 00:47:44.510, Speaker B: Do I legally pay yield, it becomes a non issue.
00:47:44.542 - 00:47:48.510, Speaker A: In some cases we're using DeFi, some cases we're using centralized lending.
00:47:48.702 - 00:47:50.894, Speaker B: But a bank can pay interest, right?
00:47:51.014 - 00:48:13.698, Speaker A: So we're basically going to be paying you interest as Abra bank or Abra International. And so you'll see debit products, credit products in addition to the Amex card. You'll see cash products for getting your salary. It just, it's just going to keep building on this for both, for all three legs of our stool, for our retail clients, for our private banking high net worth clients, and for institutional clients.
00:48:13.786 - 00:48:25.454, Speaker D: What do you think about after this? Obviously, it takes time to roll this out. It's a big headache to roll this out. You should pat yourself on the back. But what's next? Do you guys, do you look to go public in the states? What is the big goal?
00:48:25.794 - 00:48:42.870, Speaker A: There's two things that really matter to me coming out of this. The first is transparency. And so as a bank, we do have to make certain disclosures public. You'll be seeing all kinds of reserve statements and all the things that you would want in terms of transparency for.
00:48:42.902 - 00:48:44.870, Speaker B: A company that is a bank.
00:48:45.062 - 00:48:56.726, Speaker A: And this is something that we looked each other in the eye and said, okay, this is a lot of work from a systems perspective, from a regulatory perspective, from a board oversight perspective. And we all decided we were ready.
00:48:56.750 - 00:49:00.226, Speaker B: To sign up for this a while ago. Right.
00:49:00.250 - 00:49:01.370, Speaker A: We're just now able to talk about it.
00:49:01.402 - 00:49:06.554, Speaker B: And then the second is, you know, how do we future proof the business?
00:49:06.714 - 00:49:07.010, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:07.042 - 00:49:41.316, Speaker A: So what comes after nfts? You know, what comes after icos? Well, it was Defi and nfts. Thank God. It was something else, something better. Right. And so, well, what's next? What are the next type of contracts that may feel similar to nfts but really evolve the space? And we're putting the pieces in place for it not to matter what comes next. So that you can automatically use Abra regardless, meaning if it's Ethereum based or Solana based or polygon based or matic, it doesn't matter. You'll be able to use Abra when you go to that webpage or download that app.
