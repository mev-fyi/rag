00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.354, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Circle, the issuer of USDC, which hopefully, as you all know, is the preferred stablecoin of digital natives and crypto natives with over 1.5 million holders globally. You'll hear more about USDC later in the show.
00:00:16.014 - 00:00:16.598, Speaker B: All right, everyone.
00:00:16.646 - 00:00:27.120, Speaker A: We have, I think, the most requested episode that we've had in, what, maybe six, seven, eight months here, which is basically when Santi and I talk about things happening on Defi, we tend to talk about things happening on Ethereum.
00:00:27.192 - 00:00:27.424, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:27.464 - 00:00:50.284, Speaker A: Compound, aave maker, uniswap, kind of these, like, what you think of as, like, ETH protocols. A lot of folks have requested that we do a big Cosmos episode. We put out a call to action saying, who should we have to do a Cosmos episode? We got back a lot of responses. Jack and Zaki were the overwhelming response and the favorite to represent the cosmos crowd. So, Jack and Zaki, welcome. Welcome to Empire, guys.
00:00:50.744 - 00:01:19.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a huge pleasure. I've been. I've known Santi for a long time, and it is really exciting to be here. I've also been a fan just keeping up with everything going on in Defi. Yeah, Defi. I mean, to me, like, there are many applications of blockchains, but Defi is my favorite, and it is the thing that I love and understand the most. So whatever chain it's on, I like it the best.
00:01:19.524 - 00:01:20.944, Speaker C: It's the most fun of them.
00:01:21.604 - 00:01:43.948, Speaker A: Indeed. I'm excited to talk about it. I think it's really important. I was spending a lot of time thinking about this episode, thinking about where to start. And I think it's actually important to start with the history and the backstory of Cosmos, which we rarely do. But I think it's important because Cosmos, when I think about it, is like this interesting case of. It's been talked about since 2015.
00:01:43.948 - 00:02:10.530, Speaker A: 2016. Really? 2017. The token hit the scene in 2019. It's this interesting beast of, like, it's rare that something in crypto hasn't failed, but hasn't really super thrived. I would say it's kind of just, like, done well over the last several years. And so maybe, Saki, if I could ask you to take us back to that 2015 conference in Mountain View. Ideas are getting talked about, proof of stake delegation.
00:02:10.530 - 00:02:12.410, Speaker A: Take us back to the early cosmos days.
00:02:12.482 - 00:02:39.976, Speaker B: Okay, so I want you guys to imagine the world of 2015 in crypto. Basically, no one cared is the biggest answer to the extent that anyone cared. You could sell blockchains to banks. It was just. You were just aging this bizarre innovation theater. And I had a startup company called Skew Chain, and we were doing a lot of that innovation theory. SKU chain is still around, but.
00:02:39.976 - 00:03:05.876, Speaker B: And, like, actually, you know, some of the enterprise blockchain stuff is still, like, alive from that era, but the, you know, and then so what there was is there was this thing, there was this. This email list. It's called the crypto Economic Research group forum. It was a Google group, you know, really, really ancient technology. A Google group. The children, like, nobody. This is like discord for.
00:03:05.876 - 00:03:48.086, Speaker B: For, like, very old med. Like, this is your world, right? And it was actually quite like, it was an invite only Google group, but, like, Vitalik was on it. You know, like, a lot of the, like, a lot of CEO's of, like, early crypto companies were on it. We were running this thing called blockchain University, where we were inviting people to, like, come to our office on the weekend and, like, learn about blockchains. It was this. It was a crazy world, just sort of so unimaginable, and, like, literally you could fit, like, everyone who was interested in thinking about public blockchains, like, in one room of, like, 75 people. So we had this idea.
00:03:48.086 - 00:04:28.254, Speaker B: We came up with this idea, liding, from, who was one of them, the co founders of Dfinity, at the end of the day, had this idea of, why don't we have the mailing list? Like, come, like, why don't we invite the mailing list to come visit us in person? We're gonna get the mailing list together. So that's what we did. And Jay wasn't on the mailing list, but he was a friend of mine, and we've been talking about tenor, and I'm like, this Jay guy has really cool ideas about proof of stake. Why don't I put him in the same room with all these. What were the leading lights of blockchain back then? And so the whole thing is on YouTube. You could still watch it. There's a Twitter account also that tweeted it out.
00:04:28.254 - 00:04:55.008, Speaker B: I can get links for your show notes. But got all this stuff together. So Vlad and Vitalik were already friends, and Vlad was off. Vlad was being. Vlad was always Vlad. And Vlad brought one of his friends from college to this event, Ethan Buckman. And like I said, I think if someone were to write a comprehensive history of modern.
00:04:55.008 - 00:05:26.824, Speaker B: Of the history of blockchain, that conference ends up being, like, the most important thing that ever happened. Like, I don't think Vitalik ever really took proof of stake seriously until he saw Jay's tendermint presentation, I think that really got the. And I remember talking to him afterwards, it really got the wheels spinning on. Like, oh, this can really be a thing. Like, there's this thing other than nakamoto, proof of stake. Like, definitely got his on his wheels turning. But also that.
00:05:26.824 - 00:05:59.624, Speaker B: Then Ethan, who had been working on a build a version of Ethereum for the banks called Eris back in the day, was like, hey, this tendermint thing is really cool. Maybe I can start contributing to it with Jay. So they hit it off, and that was the world of 2015. So it is probably best understood that Cosmos is not an Ethereum killer. It is a pure project with Ethereum. It has coexist. It is as old as Ethereum.
00:05:59.624 - 00:06:28.084, Speaker B: It comes from very much. And it just sort of. We decided to prioritize. Jay really wanted to make proof of stake a thing that people would take seriously. It was really his mission. And that meant he wanted academics, professors, like the people at IBM research, all of these people. He wanted to convince every single, like, the smartest people in consensus, the most legit people in consensus, that, like, this could be a real thing.
00:06:28.084 - 00:06:52.014, Speaker B: So, you know, tendermint journey goes on 2016. So they try and sell tendermint to banks in 2015. Fail miserably, thank God. And 2016. Jay and Ethan are like, we want to do a public chain. I have some ideas. My version of the history.
00:06:52.014 - 00:07:12.208, Speaker B: Everybody else has their own version. My version of the history was I had this idea that I had been bouncing around, which was take Mark Miller and Dean's work from the nineties. They have this crazy website called ewrites.org dot. They were proposing the system. I got real frustrated with Vlad and Vitalik's sharding ideas. I was just like, this is never going to work.
00:07:12.208 - 00:07:36.284, Speaker B: Turns out, seven years later, they agree with me. At that time, I thought it was never going to work. I was like, let's try and figure something else out. Mark Miller had this website, ewrites.org, comma. It had this whole protocol for running smart contracts just on ordinary servers. No blockchain where the change went, so you didn't have to solve data availability.
00:07:36.284 - 00:07:57.642, Speaker B: So then I was like, why don't we do this? But, like, instead of having it be servers, make them tendermint. Explain this idea to Jay and Ethan. Ethan goes off and writes the cosmos white paper. It was called nuclear back then. Jay immediately shares it with Gavin and Rob, and that turns into polkadot. And here we are.
00:07:57.658 - 00:07:59.094, Speaker C: Wasn't it supertanker?
00:07:59.594 - 00:08:08.226, Speaker B: Supertanker. Was the idea before nuclear, which was not the Mark Miller idea. The idea that's sort of like celestia is now.
00:08:08.410 - 00:08:20.994, Speaker A: Saki, what was the issue that. So you said Vitalik wasn't taking proof of stake seriously until Jay brought this presentation about tendermint to the table. What was the problem that Jay was trying to solve here?
00:08:21.114 - 00:08:50.524, Speaker B: There was this problem with slashing, which was. So you do the bad thing. Everybody only thought in blockchains. Everybody was only thinking nakamoto, consensus. Nakamoto, proof of stake. Nakamoto. But you have this problem in proof of stake, which was, okay, so you equivocate here, you get slashed up here, but you make a fork before you get slashed, and you don't see the slashing on the fork.
00:08:50.524 - 00:09:42.506, Speaker B: And this is just the never ending problem of everyone's proof of stake algorithms. Back then, it was like, how do you actually. And then Jay was like, what if you have finality? What if you just actually don't have a fork? What if you resolve the forks and you include the slash in consensus and everyone agrees that you got slashed and now you don't have this problem anymore? Now slashing and proof of stake compose, which was slashing, was Vitalik's idea. He had the slasher blog post out in 2014, but didn't really have a solution to this. And he had, like, some crazy complicated mechanism that he was proposing in the slasher paper. And Jay was like, no, but like, what if we just have, like, two f plus one agreement and consensus, and then you have finality and then slashing just works? And he was right. And that, like, I think, really changed Vitalik's perspective on the whole thing.
00:09:42.506 - 00:09:45.894, Speaker B: But this is like my reconstruction of, like, eight years ago.
00:09:46.314 - 00:10:14.136, Speaker A: It feels like. It feels like a lot of the ideas that are kind of like, what I would call mainstream ethics today, proof of stake. Like, honestly, like, very. Almost what feels basic, like slashing and delegation and, like, liquid staking now is, like, very hot. It feels like a lot of these things are like cosmos ideas from eight years ago that I think a lot of people don't realize that Cosmos folks kind of came up with because maybe Cosmos didn't, like, propagate the narrative well enough or something. But is that we've always been terrible at that.
00:10:14.160 - 00:10:15.484, Speaker B: We're trying to fix that now.
00:10:16.264 - 00:10:52.908, Speaker C: I mean, when I first found Ethereum, it was before I was working in blockchain. I was working kind of in traditional cloud technology, and I was building developer tools at the time. And I remember installing solidity and compiling my first contract and uploading it, and my first thought was, this is a terrible developer experience. No one's going to use this. And I think that that's why we went down that app. Like, that's a huge part of the reason why I ended up finding Cosmos. I was like, oh, this app chain thesis makes a lot more sense to me from kind of a traditional scaling perspective, and, like, we should go down this route.
00:10:52.908 - 00:11:13.424, Speaker C: But what I don't think a lot of the people who were in Cosmos anticipated is how much appetite there was for this public smart contracting environment and what would sort of come out of that. So, yeah, we had a lot of these ideas about the fundamental consensus stuff, but about the application environment. We've been in a different world for a while.
00:11:13.924 - 00:11:36.740, Speaker A: I want to fast forward. Okay, so you've got the very early days. You've got this mountain view conference. Cosmos brings a lot of the big ideas to the table. Fast forward maybe three, four, five years. You guys introduced Adam in maybe 2019. My understanding, and again, this is, like, total outsider view, is that a lot of the fighting and, like, the split within Cosmos that, like, I remember, I think it was early 2020.
00:11:36.740 - 00:11:50.244, Speaker A: It was like, jay stepping down. There's infighting. And I was like, oh, this thing's dead. Like, this thing's gone. That was, due to, my understanding, is, like, something about the hub and something about Adam. So can you maybe fast forward us to, like, 2019, 2020?
00:11:50.984 - 00:12:11.564, Speaker B: I don't know that that was, like, you know, the core narrative is that there was always a lot of tension. Like, Jay was never an easy guy to work with, and there was always a lot of tension. You know, I felt like I was holding project together with my bare hands, and maybe Jack can agree that I was holding project together with my work.
00:12:12.544 - 00:12:13.000, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:13.072 - 00:12:19.360, Speaker B: Like, you know, it's like Ethan was just, like, constantly, like, ready to quit. Like, half the.
00:12:19.432 - 00:12:19.824, Speaker C: Half the.
00:12:19.864 - 00:12:51.958, Speaker B: Like, most a lot of the engineering teams also. It was, like, basically the shared vision that we, like, this, like, belief among people like Chris goes and Sunny and Jack and Ethan, that, like, we were building the correct thing, and that was all. And we, you know, that it was. There's so many names that I could put who just, like, put so much faith. Like, the incentive alignment was completely screwed up, like, all kinds of problems, but, like, everybody really believed we were building the right thing for the long run. And so everyone really put together. And I'm like, yeah.
00:12:51.958 - 00:14:01.706, Speaker B: But I did feel like I was holding the thing together with my bare hands. And so in part of our vision, like, the part of the reality of it was, on one hand, the thing that kept everyone together, though, before launch was that if we didn't launch, like, nothing would ever exist, right? If we didn't actually finish tendermint, if we didn't actually finish, get proof of stake out there, like, none of the other stuff that we all were imagining that started to come into existence would exist. So it really kept everyone in this pressure cooker, but it was, like, really hard. Like, I mean, we took, like, we took Jay and Ethan to, like, a cabin in Colorado for, like, a week and, like, stuck them with, like, basically an executive coach trying to just keep the thing alive for, like, another couple of months. Like, we were really, it was a really hard time. But one of the things that, like, really changed the game in 2019 2020 was once Cosmos was alive and, like, Binance adopted the Cosmos SDK, Adam got listed everywhere. We didn't need tendermint, the company, anymore to keep the project alive.
00:14:01.706 - 00:14:36.750, Speaker B: I mean, that was the honest truth. And so when Jay decided to, like, become more difficult to work with, as sometimes he does, Jack and I quit. The engineering team spun out into the new organization working for the foundation. The kind of purple pill style drama that happened in maker basically happened in Cosmos. And in some ways, just like, maker survived. We survived. But a lot of it was just the certainty of once we had kind of gotten the technology where we needed, we didn't need to all be trapped in.
00:14:36.750 - 00:14:51.154, Speaker B: We didn't necessarily have to keep working with Jay. But that is the test of whether or not you built something decentralized. Can it survive that? Can you burn the bridges and jump?
00:14:51.854 - 00:15:33.622, Speaker D: I remember talking to you in San Francisco right around that time because I was actually looking at investing in the tendermint round. Which paradigm end up leading. That was, I think, one of the first investments paradigm did. I think one of the things that is really interesting when I first discovered Cosmos was this idea that tendermint has been pretty battle tested and the credit around proof of stake and having a different consensus engine other than Nakamoto consensus is pretty battle tested, and most people are really surprised. And look, we're a day out of the merge, which has been in the works for such a long time, but I think most people don't really appreciate tendermint is a consensus engine. It's pretty battle. It tested, like, byzantine, fault tolerant kind of system.
00:15:33.622 - 00:15:46.814, Speaker D: And, and that other projects have adopted that, like, you alluded to, like, finance and Facebook was looking at using it for their, you know, Novi or Libra and Terra, you know, and so Facebook.
00:15:46.894 - 00:15:50.194, Speaker B: Could spend, liked it so much, they rewrote it in rust.
00:15:50.614 - 00:15:54.570, Speaker C: Right, and made it pipelined. It's like a. Yeah.
00:15:54.602 - 00:16:26.516, Speaker D: And so what I'm trying to get at is there's sort of, I think most people would be surprised to learn around this idea that proof of stake is not like something new that's coming online tomorrow. Of course, it gets more validity, Ethereum having migrated to it, and we'll see how it works out. But I'm curious if you could give listeners more appreciation for that type of consensus that you guys really kind of worked on over the last couple of years and how battle tested it has been, because it is very timely. Now that we're a day out from.
00:16:26.540 - 00:16:30.664, Speaker B: The merch, you want to talk about the early days of the Tenderman testnets, Jack?
00:16:31.244 - 00:17:07.264, Speaker C: Yeah, we've done so many of these networks at this point, and there was this strong culture of testnets, and you see a lot of people doing incentivized testnets now. And that's what Zaki and I did with Game of stakes first and then game of zones for IBC. But Solana did one, near did one. All of the major l one s kind of did it. And that was a result of our work. I think one of the, also the whole validator community around Ethereum and Lido that gets so much press. Like those people were all Cosmos Genesis validators.
00:17:08.124 - 00:17:26.582, Speaker D: I'll put a pause there because I was, I think we were the largest investor. One of the largest investors in Lido was a parafy because I knew those guys back in the day running validators and running like these, these game of steaks that you're talking about. Yeah, those guys had a ton of experience. And so when I looked them like, yeah, these guys are super battle tested, they were like the number one validator.
00:17:26.758 - 00:17:35.806, Speaker C: It was crazy. We were all figuring it out together in this, like, weird set of riot chat rooms. There was this, like, OG riot chat room that's like completely lost to history at this point.
00:17:35.830 - 00:17:39.990, Speaker B: I'm sure the Bison trails founders met each other in that chat room.
00:17:40.022 - 00:17:40.278, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:40.326 - 00:17:45.056, Speaker B: Like many businesses, you know, I think.
00:17:45.080 - 00:18:28.844, Speaker C: One of the cool things about proof of stake is when you stand these networks up, it's like a barn raising. It takes sometimes 100 different people all collaborating to do that. And that's what created this kind of strong validator community that's gone out and seeded all of these other proof of stake networks like Polkadot and Nier and e two as well. But it was that huge series of testnets and then going and launching Cosmos chain after Cosmos chain, where we kind of built that capability, and a lot of it is around the developer ease of use and the operator ease of use that we built into the software to help run these things. And, yeah, man, that was such a fun. That was such fun work.
00:18:29.984 - 00:18:59.084, Speaker A: I want to push us forward into basically the app train thesis, the cosmos thesis, and why you guys are here and why this is so important to talk about. What maybe, Jack, can I pick on you for this one? And then, Zack, you will see if you agree with Zach. What is the cosmos thesis around? App chains are better apps. To build better apps on your own chain, you do it on your own chain instead of on this monolithic chain like Ethereum. But can you say it much more elegantly than I ever could?
00:18:59.504 - 00:19:29.114, Speaker C: I look at this from a history of computing standpoint. I think about blockchains a lot like computers. A single smart contracting blockchain is a lot like a supercomputer. It's single threaded. You could make these things multithreaded, and that's a whole other discussion. And people like Sui and Aptos are working on that. But if you have a single threaded computer, there's only so fast you can make that thread spin, and you can either make the computer a lot bigger, or you can make a bunch of different computers and network them.
00:19:29.114 - 00:20:24.734, Speaker C: And if we look at the history of computing, all the way up through the early eighties, people thought, maybe we're gonna have all these supercomputers, and then everyone have a terminal connects to it and do your processing there. And it wasn't really fully until Google developed Mapreduce in the early two thousands, when they were networking together tens of thousands of computers to build compute clusters that were thousands of times more capable than the largest supercomputers, when it became obvious that computer networking was the way forward. And I think that blockchains are this way, too. If you look at it from a fundamental perspective, trying to shove all of the apps on the world on one single threaded computer, that's going to fail. It's going to be really expensive, maybe there's use cases for it, and it's really cool. And I think that the synchronous composability stuff around things like flash loans could have never developed outside of that. And there's a lot of dirty topics there.
00:20:24.734 - 00:20:51.904, Speaker C: But fundamentally, I think what the app chain thesis is, in order to scale blockchains to meet the demands of seven to 8 billion people in the world, there's going to need to be a lot of them, and they're going to need to talk to each other. And if that's the world that you're building for, what you end up building looks a lot more like IBC. It looks like a software development kit for organizations, companies, apps to build their own blockchains. And I think that's kind of the fundamental app thesis as I see it.
00:20:52.444 - 00:21:22.866, Speaker D: So maybe we can spend a minute there, because I think a critic here might say, wait a minute. I understand that not every application needs to have the exact same level of security. A game is different than a Defi application. Depends on what you're transacting and the value that's being exchanged. But walk us through from a project perspective, you're using the shared security model. And I want people to really understand that because I don't think it's a concept that is kind of. It could be intuitive, but it could be difficult to wrap your head around that.
00:21:22.866 - 00:21:35.504, Speaker D: How does it actually work, this shared security system? If you're a new developer, you want to come to Cosmos and build there? Maybe just spend a moment walking us through how that would work.
00:21:36.044 - 00:21:44.900, Speaker C: Are we talking about shared security on the Cosmos hub? Are we talking about shared security in a system like Polkadot? Are we talking about shared security in a system like Celestia?
00:21:45.092 - 00:21:46.716, Speaker D: Let's pick the Cosmos hub.
00:21:46.900 - 00:22:18.936, Speaker C: Okay, just to be clear, most cosmos chains now have their own validator sets. Yes, I do agree with you. Not every application is going to need its own validator set. I would argue, however, that an application, once it reaches a certain size, will likely want its own validator set. I think that's a different conversation. But in shared security on the Cosmos hub, the Cosmos hub validators will validate your chain for you. The way that this would work as a developer is you build your chain using all of the same toolkit that you would use to build a standard Cosmos chain.
00:22:18.936 - 00:22:37.344, Speaker C: Then you would put up a governance proposal in the Cosmos hub and say, hey, Cosmos hub validators, do you guys want to run our chain? Two, if the hub validators accept that, they start running that software or else they get slashed by consensus and that chain is now live trusting the hub validator set for their security.
00:22:37.804 - 00:22:45.064, Speaker D: In this case, they would be earning some sort of validation rewards from that new chain.
00:22:46.074 - 00:22:46.974, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:22:47.314 - 00:23:12.346, Speaker D: Yeah. And how does. So there'd be the coS. So to visualize it, there'd be the cosmos hub. All these different chains that make proposals. What's the limitation in terms of the number of chains that can make proposals is there like an upper bound, or do you end up spinning different hubs for different type of use cases? There's a defi hub, there's gaming hub. I'm curious how this kind kind of, of scales out.
00:23:12.530 - 00:23:51.410, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this gets down to kind of a difference in engineering cultures. In cosmos, we really strongly believe in kind of ship and iterate. Get a good v one out there, get users, and then build on. So with that sort of framing, the first version of shared security that we're shipping to the cosmos hub is a v one. Every validator on the cosmos hub validates each of the child chains. And for that, there's probably a practical upper limit of around ten to 20 chains that can be validated in that way. A v two of shared security takes only a portion of the validators and a portion of the stake on the cosmos hub and provides security for the child chains.
00:23:51.410 - 00:24:16.456, Speaker C: And that's a much more scalable architecture. Now, I will note that V two version of interchange security as a child chain, you could rent security from, say, the cosmos hub and osmosis and maybe dy DX chain. And in that way, each of the chains sort of create this interlocking web of security with each other. That's a different system. But the first system, like ten to 20 chains, is kind of the upper bound.
00:24:16.640 - 00:24:55.636, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, I don't want to get too ahead, but just one topic that I want to get more understanding. This is more for listeners. I think the follow up question to that is, well, talk to us about renting and how expensive that is. And if you talk about this transition of a chain, you know, at some point will want to have its own validator set. But in the shared model, initially, like, how expensive it is for them, you know, and what kind of, what's their calculus when they're making the consideration of deploying and going to cosmos versus perhaps another ecosystem. Like, I'm sure the renting cost is something that they think about, and, but.
00:24:55.660 - 00:26:04.794, Speaker B: I'm curious to get your perspective as a ecosystem right. When you were, when you're sort of breathing one of, like, whether you're breathing like the a dao on top of ethereum into life or like one of these daos as chains that we have in cosmos into life, it basically comes down to how you're going to allocate tokens over the lifecycle of the project. And what we've seen a lot in cosmos is quite substantial, and generally in proof of stake is a lot of very large validator incentives upfront to come over, join our chain, be part of it. Just in terms of total token supply and initial issuance, initial liquidity, very large allocations. It's like evmos, osmosis. All of these things are just printing massive staking and delegation validator rewards. One of the things that I think that is a consequence of interchange security is you're going to start seeing a lot of different experiments now in token allocation and how you spend your token budget on things.
00:26:04.794 - 00:26:43.262, Speaker B: So it's like neutron when it launches. Neutron is one of the early interchange secured chains. It's a general purpose smart contract environment by one of the teams that is a core contributor to Lido as well. The p two B validator team. They keep coming up because they are the best, but they're building a permissionless smart contract chain. They can be a lot more deliberative about how they allocate the neutron token because they don't have to spin up a validator set for nothing. They have to send some amount of neutrons to cover the incremental costs of spinning up new nodes and stuff like that.
00:26:43.262 - 00:27:11.514, Speaker B: But people are running the validators. Their bills are being paid by the atom token, the cosmos hub, largely. And now you're starting to share costs among these two daos. So it allows you to have chains that spin up that don't have a native token that send their transaction fees to the Cosmos hub. We're going to have a key part of the sort of atom 2.0 thesis is we're going to do a bunch of stuff around Meb in this environment. There's a lot to go here.
00:27:11.514 - 00:27:23.194, Speaker B: And so I do think the character of Cosmos chains and the feel of Cosmos chains and the economics of Cosmos chains are really set up for a revolution in 2023.
00:28:09.954 - 00:28:36.648, Speaker A: Jack, talk about the different advantages. Like Santi asked a really good question about the shared security. I called folks like Cosmos folks before this, doing a little prep for the episode. One person says shared security is the most important thing. The other person says like communication, interoperability is the most important thing. The third person says, if you don't have your own blockchain as an app, you're going to leak value from the economic transactions of the Dapp users. Why would anyone want that? Wouldn't you want to capture the value? Three different answers, three different people.
00:28:36.648 - 00:28:45.794, Speaker A: So in your guys minds, what is the core reason, core thesis behind moving onto your own app chain? The security, the communication, the not leaking value.
00:28:46.654 - 00:28:47.870, Speaker C: Saki, if you want to take this.
00:28:47.902 - 00:29:48.734, Speaker B: The answer is different for every project. And that is the glorious thing, right? Okay, so the core of the app chain thesis, to me, is actually full stack optimization. I think one of the things that, I think one of the reasons why Cosmos, like, if I had to guess, like one macro reason why Cosmos is sort of on the top of everyone's minds, is suddenly talked about this project that is an overnight success after having been worked on for eight years, is basically, I guess, our thesis, and our thesis has played out, which is we were like, people don't know what apps they're building. We don't know how to build anything in Defi. We don't know all these things are just concepts. We don't know what's going to work, what's not going to work. And honestly, one deficiency of cosmos is the iteration cycles are much longer than shipping.
00:29:48.734 - 00:30:23.394, Speaker B: Smart contracts on top of Ethereum, on top of roll ups, all this stuff. The lifecycle of a build out is typically six to nine months, is a typical mvp build out on top of the Cosmos stack. We could do a lot to make that shorter, but that is a big part of life. People have to decide what they want. Dydx rewrote. This is their fourth rewrite of the app. They've learned a lot from their user base about what actually matters.
00:30:23.394 - 00:31:05.402, Speaker B: What do they actually want? This deeper build out, this more complex, less ship and iterate build out that they've been yielding in Cosmos. They have a lot of actual, like, this is what our users want. This is what market makers want kind of information. And so one of the reasons why we think that Cosmo is because of the last, like, three, two, three years of building out in DeFi, people now have a much better idea of what would work, what would not work, what is worth the slightly higher engineering costs, but the ability to do full stack optimization, to, like, fully optimize top to bottom the system to do the app.
00:31:05.538 - 00:31:46.256, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting point, Zaki, where I felt that osmosis really put Cosmos back in the map. I mean, IBC took a while to ship, which I was kind of waiting for and really excited because the common kind of criticisms that I keep hearing, Mike's like, it's a very interesting design, very modular. Like, I agree with everything you said, but I just don't know. Value is going to accrue to atoms, and you're taking a bet on that being the primary hub. And to me, it's like, I was waiting on IBC and I was going to the conferences, and nonetheless, we fast forwarded now, so you have osmosis, really, I think, put Cosmos back in the map. It's like, okay, wow, they've really taken a lot of designs from Defi and Ethereum and made a lot of optimizations to that. And then you're seeing now DyDx migrate over.
00:31:46.256 - 00:32:06.474, Speaker D: I'm curious if you guys can comment on what, like, you guys are so deep in it, like, what is going through the mind of the team at DYDX? And do you anticipate other projects moving over and deploying their own chain after seeing what DyDx is doing?
00:32:07.694 - 00:32:30.668, Speaker B: I'm excited about this. I will say a couple of things. One is I can walk you through the thought process of DYDX, because I went along with a bit of the journey with them, which is, you know, they built star. They built on top of Starx, right? So Starkex is this product by, you.
00:32:30.676 - 00:32:35.268, Speaker D: Mean the team built it for them because they didn't really have developers for them.
00:32:35.316 - 00:33:00.334, Speaker B: And then they built a lot. They built the order book. They built the matching engine. They built, like, the collateral system. Like all kinds of stuff. Like, it's not like they built nothing, but like, there's this, like, core settlement engine. Like, essentially you could think of it almost having the same sort of function as, like, what IBC does in Cosmos, right? It was basically a bridge between what was going on in their application and what needed to be settled onto the Ethereum chain.
00:33:00.334 - 00:33:42.138, Speaker B: Starcore built this for them, and they were very happy. They do a billion dollars of volume every day. It's crazy. It's an amazing product. It's like the most product market fit that we've seen in anything in Defi compared to centralized exchange trading, DYDX, it's an absolutely state of their art product. But as this over compliance and as the sort of compliance with the sanctions regime has kind of this thing that credit to the DyDx founders for seeing this months in advance, maybe even more than a year in advance. They were like, well, we have this problem, which is we're running a centralized order book, right? We're running a centralized order book.
00:33:42.138 - 00:34:28.134, Speaker B: We have to. We are in a tenuous regulatory position that we are not censorship resistant. If we want to be the liquidity engine of the world, we are not censorship resistant. Ethereum is censorship resistance. We are not because we run the set of servers that match everyone's orders, et cetera. So then they how to decentralize apps that have this architecture has been an honest struggle for Starkware. I talked to Ellie and Yuri all the time, all the roll ups are also struggling with, how do you decentralize their sequencers? You come to this question of, well, if you wanted to keep Starkx, but also have a decentralized sequencer, you kind of have to bolt Starkx and tendermint together.
00:34:28.134 - 00:35:42.604, Speaker B: And that's a research project, how to do that? What the best way to do that is Starkware has some blog posts about wanting to do this, but it's at least two years out anytime soon. So then DYDX, but DyDX wanted to go faster, and they were like, what can we do? So then they were like, well, okay, so they're saying use tendermint. Okay, like, what would we do with tendermint? And then they started, they sort of rediscovered a design for Dex that, like, sunny and I had, like, been, like, working on, like, back in 2018. This idea of this, like, in memory multi chain order book or multivalidator order book, where the, where the Dex, unlike serum or other Cwob style dexs that we're familiar with, rather than having the Dex on chain, you have the Dex in the validators server itself, or you have the order book there, and then you only settle on chain. You can provide an experience that basically looks, with a lot of engineering effort, you can build an experience that looks like FTX basically on top of an architecture like this. It's going to be amazing, but it's also decentralized in censorship resistance. I'm real excited about what Duidx is building.
00:35:42.604 - 00:36:31.996, Speaker B: It's going to interoperate with IBC, but then you also have this stuff. Their token potential can be debated, but has a value accrual problem. Now the token becomes a staking token. You get MeV accrual to the validators and the people who stake with them from liquidations on the chain. Now you are operating in this full stack economic zone where you actually can integrate the token, integrate censorship, resistance, really build something amazing. Yeah, like, I mean, kudos to the DyDX team for both, like, figuring this out, finding themselves. No one sold tendermint to them.
00:36:31.996 - 00:36:36.604, Speaker B: There's no, like, tendermint salesforce that, like, marched into their office and was like, hey, like, you should invest in.
00:36:36.644 - 00:36:40.544, Speaker C: Well, I would go ahead and say that Zacky is the tendermint sales force.
00:36:42.004 - 00:36:45.412, Speaker B: They'd already decided they were already spun up on tendermint before we was ever.
00:36:45.428 - 00:36:49.544, Speaker D: It's like the best salesman is the one that tells you he's not a salesman, and then you're like, just convinces you.
00:36:53.374 - 00:37:09.714, Speaker B: Yeah, they were pretty far. Let me just finish this one thing. It was like, yeah, they were pretty far down the tendermint road by the time I got there. But they've been very collaborative with the entire cosmos community, and it's been a real pleasure working with them.
00:37:10.214 - 00:37:27.004, Speaker A: This might. I'm not even entirely sure this question makes sense, but if I'm thinking about this in the right way, once an app reaches product market fit and, like, really takes off, are they, like, are they disincentivized in a way to contribute back to the security of the hub or the security of the protocol?
00:37:27.784 - 00:37:32.920, Speaker B: Like, if you're overcharging, it's like a really interesting. I mean, do you have any thoughts on this, Jack, before?
00:37:32.952 - 00:37:55.428, Speaker C: I mean, I think the public goods public goods funding problem is serious in this industry. And, like, we see that in Ethereum quite a bit. Zucky and I have been pretty deeply engaged in trying to figure out how to get a lot of these new chains that are spinning up to contribute back to the core software. I think we've got some exciting stuff to announce at Cosmoverse.
00:37:55.476 - 00:38:29.096, Speaker B: But, yeah, I would also say that. So we have, on one hand, we are sort of building interchange security in such a way that exiting the system and entering the system is actually going to be pretty easy. You could have a sovereign chain and decide you want to move to the shared security model. We're going to have a relatively well tested upgrade path for that. We're also going to have a relatively well tested path for, hey, this isn't working out. We would like to part ways. Now.
00:38:29.096 - 00:38:53.626, Speaker B: There are downsides to making leaving so easy. It definitely is going to put pricing pressure on the system, but it also should make it a stronger incentive to join. So I think a lot about that I'm not going to really do. We're not going to do it any different way. At the end of the day, we're not going to produce an artificial barrier just to keep people in the system. And hopefully, the shared security adds enough value that people want to stay just.
00:38:53.650 - 00:39:36.474, Speaker D: For listeners to conceptualize. This would be like, for instance, you have very successful defi project comes and says, hey, I want the shared security from the Cosmos hub. It initially, it benefits from the validator set. It just focuses on building the app. Fast forward a year, they're getting a ton of traction, and they might want to just spin out, build their own, and convince validators that have been part of the cosmos hub to say, hey, come just to my chain and just call it a day. If I'm interpreting what you're saying that is certainly feasible and possible. And I'm curious if there have been attempts to do this and if there have been projects that have done this already.
00:39:38.374 - 00:39:42.566, Speaker C: Projects that have switched back and forth between shared security already or just like.
00:39:42.630 - 00:39:46.834, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. Just exited the cosmos hub and just launched their own chain.
00:39:47.254 - 00:39:47.686, Speaker B: Sure.
00:39:47.750 - 00:40:02.742, Speaker C: Right now, the cosmos hub, it's not live. We don't have it. So every cosmos chain right now runs their own validator set. A lot of this stuff around multilayered security and roll ups and kind of theoretical at this point.
00:40:02.838 - 00:40:24.294, Speaker B: Well, there's a testnet running. There's a testnet running. It goes live on the hub. We have this whole portfolio of. So neutron is the publicly announced one, and then we have a bunch of things in heaven. It's crazy. We actually have a decentralized biz dev team with 15 different entities sitting in a telegram chat, and we figure this stuff out.
00:40:24.294 - 00:40:34.354, Speaker B: And when people want to join the cosmos hub, now you have to sign at least four NDAs with different entities just to make any progress. But people do it. It's wild.
00:40:37.414 - 00:41:10.522, Speaker C: That's kind of an interesting sideline on Cosmos, is I see a lot of complaints about low voter participation in daos on Ethereum and the way we built cosmos governance. Each chain is effectively a dao. And there's been a lot of work on making effective daos in cosmos. And when Zack is talking about a decentralized business, bizdev.org, that's our biz dev Dao for Cosmos. And we've got a lot of really great dao tooling around governance. And we've used these things fairly extensively.
00:41:10.522 - 00:41:22.174, Speaker C: An average cosmos hub governance proposal at this point gets 60 to 70,000 votes. And that's just orders of magnitude more voter participation than you see in a lot of ETH based daos.
00:41:23.314 - 00:41:56.276, Speaker A: All right, everyone, time for a quick word from Circle and USCC. As a crypto user, you know the power of stablecoins, dollar digital currencies that transcend borders, banking hours and legacy financial rails well. Circle's USDC has quickly become one of the most trusted and widely used stablecoins. It's simple. People use USDC because of its composability, its stability, and its reserve transparency. And USDC isn't just adopted by a few of us. Defi degens and Daos and NFT marketplaces, crypto companies alike.
00:41:56.276 - 00:42:36.666, Speaker A: They all leverage USDC to diversify their treasury, asset management and ecosystem wide composability. The adoption is clear. USDC has grown to more than $50 billion in circulation since launching in 2018. We all have, and we all will continue to take shots on our favorite volatile crypto assets, obviously, but USDC is one of the easiest ways to store your funds in a stable asset that can be used to send value around the world almost instantly. It lowers the cost of cross border payments. It integrates into the growing ecosystem of crypto apps. As a seamless, trusted dollar digital currency, USDC is a zero to one opportunity for the financial system.
00:42:36.666 - 00:43:03.494, Speaker A: If you want to learn more about USDC, I would recommend you check out the recently published transparency hub on Circle.com dot. It's a great update to Circle's content on USDC. It outlines everything from links to their weekly reserve reports, monthly attestations, blog posts that are written by their exec team that highlight how and why USDC was built the way it is really recommended. Just go to Circle.com transparency to access it. Now let's get back to the show.
00:43:04.674 - 00:44:01.410, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess where I was going with this is the hub and spoke model is now looking more like, or will probably look more like point to point mesh security kind of architecture where you have maybe an oracle interacting with a defi, like a perps protocol and that they could like, they're very active zones, they can have a lot of shared security and they have a vested interest in both of them. And so like, look, it's like trade routes historically. Like if you have a trade route between, you know, country A and country B, then that builds relationship and you don't have wars. When someone breaks the trade route, you get wars. And so like the Suez Canal and stuff like this. So my question really is, and where I've struggled with this is we don't like to like make speculation or make any financial advice here, but the criticism and concern that a lot of people over the years have had is talk to me about value accrual. And by the way, this just does not apply to cosmos atom as the center like security substrate or whatever this applies to.
00:44:01.410 - 00:44:19.920, Speaker D: Is this more of a philosophical question on value accrual? And Jack, you kind of alluded to this with public goods. What accrues value in this transition? I'm curious how you guys think about all of that. Um, value accrual. And it's a very broad and open question, but nonetheless, apps accrue value.
00:44:20.072 - 00:44:48.560, Speaker C: Um, and you know, the cosmos hub as an application was never theorized to accrue value. And you know, Adam 2.0, I've been reading quite a bit more. We've been in these working groups the last few months, and Zucky's been leading a lot of that and been especially over the last couple of days in preparation for cosmoverse. Reading up a lot on that. We've got some really exciting things coming for Adam, the application. But, yeah.
00:44:48.560 - 00:45:05.152, Speaker C: What accrues value in this world in which we've built a bunch of open source code that helps underlie all of these things? Well, it's the applications and the networks of people and validators that end up accruing the value, and that's kind of where it should be in a lot of ways.
00:45:05.328 - 00:45:59.716, Speaker B: So, a couple of comments. One of the best memes, I think, in Cosmos is that Cosmos is coming to kill your fat protocol thesis. You've got your fat protocol thesis. We, like steel manned the building of the thing that murders your fat protocol thesis. That's the first cosmos meme about value accrual. I think the second thing is absolutely true, which is in the long run, assuming blockchains are actually good computing platforms that, like, lots of people use, the application layer is the layer that has the queerest, is the stickiest, is the place where the application accrues value. And I imagine that what I'm expecting of the world is the top 20 tokens will just be different sports teams.
00:45:59.716 - 00:46:18.196, Speaker B: Sure, you'll have a sports team, and we'll cheer when some big application comes to our sports teams. Little neck of the woods. But at the end of the day, the sports teams will just be like, we make a product, people go on tv, they buy nachos. Like, this is where the value accrual is. It's great that you have. This is. So that's the third thing.
00:46:18.196 - 00:47:04.354, Speaker B: And then the third thing is like, one of the things that we did for a whole variety of reasons was essentially we were like, if you look at the original Cosmos white paper, it talks extensively about the Cosmos network, how we think it's all going to work, how IBC is going to work, all that stuff. It doesn't say anything about it, just basically says, there will be this atom token and you can stake it. Yay. And really doesn't really have a story about what this token is for. I think you'll see. And I continue to be dropping hits until twelve days from now when we go on stage and we'll open the kimono. But this thing that we've been working on for months.
00:47:04.354 - 00:47:55.466, Speaker B: But the other thing that is true is. So the other thing is, I don't know, I've hated the Polkadot mechanism, the parachain auction mechanism. I was like, if you have a thing that is actually scalable, there's no scarcity, and it's hugely adversely selecting to be airdrop 30% of your tokens to the dot holders to get a slot for two years. That's just a value accrual. It's like an adverse selection nightmare. You want to build the best, bring the best protocols. So how do we build a value accrual mechanism for Adam that doesn't have adverse selection, that understands that the biggest value accruers in the Cosmos ecosystem are going to be the applications, and Atom is not going to be itself a Defi application platform in the truest sense of the word.
00:47:55.466 - 00:48:33.974, Speaker B: It's not going to be a dydx. But how do we still align value accrual in Cosmos? And things that we only dreamed about in 2016 are now very real things. Like, we saw Olympus Dow happen, we saw MeV as a real thing, that we actually know how the MEV market will behave. There's a lot of stuff. So the three legs of the school are look at things like Olympus stout, look at things like liquid Lido, look at things like flashbots. These are all really exciting things. From these pieces, we construct our Atom 2.0.
00:48:34.914 - 00:49:26.800, Speaker D: Yeah, but to be fair, though, and I get that, I think my understanding is Atom serves as, when you're slashing, there needs to be, there's this security substrate, there's value at stake, and you can get slash, and you're staking your atoms, and that secures the chain. Right. And so initially, if you have a zone, like you're a project, Adams become like this kind of glue that most people should align towards, at least initially, to support, because you benefit from, I guess, incremental projects coming into and making the hub just more thriving, if you will. And so there should be some alignment in, like, atoms as that valuable security currency. I don't know if you kind of agree with that.
00:49:26.992 - 00:49:55.148, Speaker C: I think at Adam 2.0, yes, that's definitely the case. And we've worked hard to make that narrative true. I think that the biggest criticism of Cosmos, the hub, over the last couple of years has been we built a lot of open source software that anyone can come in and use. There's no guarantee that they're going to use atoms for anything. And the fact is, they have ended up using atoms for a bunch of things. They've repeatedly airdropped the atom token distribution.
00:49:55.148 - 00:50:24.514, Speaker C: They built defi protocols, things like ist that rely on atoms. Atoms have become the de facto fiat on ramp and off ramp throughout the interchange. There's a bunch of other network effects that Atom has had, but none of that is guaranteed at a software level. Once we have interchange security and there's projects launching underneath it. Yes. For those projects specifically, that's the sort of atom economic zone. We're going to see a lot of value accrual there at Adam.
00:50:24.514 - 00:50:53.862, Speaker C: But right now, with the 50 chains out there, there's no guarantees for atom holders. We built a lot of public goods infrastructure to get to this point. Bootstrapping a network of blockchains, a very, very hard problem. I remember when I started talking with Zackie, I was like, okay, so wait, we're going to launch one blockchain and then we got to build an application framework to build a bunch of blockchains, and then we got to build the network thing to get them together. We need to make sure there's a critical mass. I was like. He's like, yeah, yeah.
00:50:53.862 - 00:50:58.194, Speaker C: I was like, okay, all right, well, we got a lot of work to do. Better get started.
00:50:59.454 - 00:51:04.998, Speaker A: Socky, I have a question. You were kind of hinting at this presentation that you're giving around, like, Atom 2.0 and September.
00:51:05.046 - 00:51:22.450, Speaker B: It's not just me. I just want to be very clear. There have been a lot of Adam 2.0. There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen. I will be like, this is the opening act of cosmoverse, which is this big cosmos conference that's in MiDI in two weeks before Defcon.
00:51:22.642 - 00:51:29.014, Speaker A: Can you hint at any new inflation schedule? EIP 1500, 5900 percent.
00:51:29.354 - 00:51:33.054, Speaker B: No, no. We're going to make EIP 15519 look like a joke.
00:51:33.914 - 00:51:34.542, Speaker A: Boom.
00:51:34.658 - 00:52:01.406, Speaker B: Like, we're basically doing, like, we're doing a version of enshrined. Like, it's. There's a version of enshrined proposal builder separation in there. There's a version. There's a new inflation schedule. We are not just going to be exponentially inflating everyone until the sun burns out because we know how to design proof of stake systems that no longer require that. And we are going to be.
00:52:01.406 - 00:53:04.644, Speaker B: Yeah, and, like, we think we figured out an alternative to, like, something like parachain auctions for, like, aligning with the new tokens that are appearing in the ecosystem so that, like, when people are actually, so, like, we think we can, we have an even stronger alignment mechanism designed than, like, the airdrop mechanism, which sort of works, but it's like, kind of this, like, I do have my criticisms of the airdrop mechanism, which is basically, you're, like, throwing a lot of marketing at your product right when it is most immature, which is like, kind of makes no sense. And so, you know, there's a lot of. Yeah, so, you know, I do think that this is, I'm honestly, I'm so excited about it, but like it's a, it's a, it's, it's a tricky thing to like talk about in such like weird terms. And like, I'm just like I'm really looking forward to just like we're all going to, we're going to like talk about it. I think we're going to start out with talking about the inflation schedule and that stuff. And then like, my section is the talk is really going to be like deep in the weeds on the value accrual mechanisms.
00:53:05.424 - 00:53:56.866, Speaker D: I want to talk about just, well, I was going to ask you what you guys were spending most of your time on, but I think you've touched that on various kind of questions. I'm curious, like, I don't want to spend too much time on Ethereum, but I do want to revisit one topic that you mentioned earlier, which is you see coexistence. And I think that is refreshing. Take I think a lot of times most people think about maximalism and, you know, Ethereum killers and whatnot. I think the cosmos vibe generally has not been that historically, and I don't think it is today. But I am curious, what do you see Ethereum moving or proof of stake as early as tomorrow with the merge happening and how does that impact cosmos on the margin? Really interested in hearing your thoughts around that and how you see the state of cosmos interacting with Ethereum over the next twelve or year or two.
00:53:57.050 - 00:54:20.094, Speaker C: I think that it makes it actually a lot easier to interact with Ethereum from an interoperability perspective when it's proof of work. You've got a lot of issues with building bridges and this is one of the huge reasons why the bridge issue has been so huge over the last few years. Proof of stake offers hope of a better environment for that.
00:54:21.734 - 00:54:43.222, Speaker B: I also think that we briefly talked about that there is a really cool post on ETH research about sort of a path to like IBC natively to Ethereum. You know, I've been waiting for this day, for the merge day since 2015. I mean, I'm so excited.
00:54:43.398 - 00:55:30.494, Speaker C: Like, I mean, Zucky and I went and built the gravity bridge, which is a piece of technology to allow trustless bridging between evms and, well, not trustless. I mean, standard proof of stake trust assumption bridges between ETH and cosmos. So, you know, and especially as the ETH narrative starts to shift towards ETH being a settlement layer for a bunch of roll ups, that is basically the same multi chain narrative we've been pushing for many, many years. So, you know, we're excited for ETH to come join us in proof of stake land. We are excited for more and more chains and more and more protocols to be out there. And I think, Santi, you asked like what we're spending most of our time on these days. What I spend a lot of my time doing is working on re enabling composability between different cosmos chains.
00:55:30.494 - 00:55:41.870, Speaker C: And asynchronous composability looks a lot different than synchronous composability, and there's a lot more developer tooling required for that. And that's basically what my company, strangelove, spends most of our time.
00:55:41.902 - 00:55:45.394, Speaker D: Sounds oxymoronic, but can you talk a little bit more about asynchronous composability?
00:55:45.844 - 00:56:10.784, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So asynchronous composability is what the Internet is. It's HTTP requests. If you've ever been a JavaScript developer and you've sent an Ajax request, you get a promise back. And then once that promise resolves, you get the underlying object below it. There's some additional latency there. And the programming languages and programming paradigms that you use need to be able to express that.
00:56:10.784 - 00:57:03.000, Speaker C: When you're in the smart contracting environment in Ethereum, you can say, I need to know how many tokens are in this aave pool, and in response to that I might take some action. You can know that there's an amount of tokens in that pool at a given time, and then you can go ahead and take that action. When you add latency in queries, it accurately models the real world in a lot of ways. It takes time to pull this data, but it doesn't paper over those issues, but it does expose those directly to programmers in a way that makes it harder. You can still build highly composed defi systems if you've got two chains with extremely low latency. The IBC connection between those chains will also be extremely low latency. You can do it in a very low latency way, but it's not in a zero latency way, and you get fewer guarantees.
00:57:03.192 - 00:57:05.812, Speaker D: Could you have asynchronous flash loans?
00:57:06.008 - 00:57:08.144, Speaker C: Oh, Zucky, do you want to talk about Cinderella loans?
00:57:09.604 - 00:57:12.908, Speaker D: But by the way, just. Okay, go ahead, Zucky, because I have a fun story about them.
00:57:12.956 - 00:58:00.874, Speaker B: So I mean, like there's like, two massive projects like R and D projects in the cosmos ecosystem. To try and get us flash loans, which, you know, again, can show, like, how cosmos can be difficult is frankly, like, the honest answer to this question. But, like, so the team at Anoma, which is sort of an offshoot of the cosmos ecosystem, has this thing called typhon, which is actually redoing tendermint consensus so that you can have a validator set that votes on blocks for multiple chains at the same time. So you can actually have. You can be like, I need to do synchronous composability with this other chain. We're going to get the validator sets to vote on the blocks together so that you get this fused block. It's insanely ambitious.
00:58:00.874 - 00:58:41.964, Speaker B: I have this other thing that I propose that I have a little JpEg of the text written up that is floating around called Cinderella tokens, which is basically a way of overlapping, where basically you can daisy chain a bunch of economic interactions asynchronously over multiple chains and then atomically settle them all simultaneously. Obviously, it's a wild idea. It brings to mind carriage rides and turning in things into pumpkins, and I'm not sure which one of them is actually going to be. The typhoon is also a really cool primitive.
00:58:44.104 - 00:59:20.822, Speaker C: A third way this might happen is you have a lending protocol that controls assets on many different chains, and in response to liquidation, demand can move the collateral that would be behind the flash loans to the individual chains, and then the chain developers can use that synchronous environment on that individual chain to do the liquidations. There's a bunch of different, like, Mars protocol is a good example of a protocol that's looking to do things like that. But, yeah, I think that this particular problem shows the differences in developing in a synchronous environment versus developing in an asynchronous environment.
00:59:20.998 - 00:59:57.574, Speaker D: Yeah, I remember, like, talking. This was a big topic in the last Defcon we had in Osaka. Everyone was talking about composability, net breaking, and, like, there was someone that, I forget who that says exactly what you said, jack, which is, like, the Internet, like, evolved in a similar manner. Like, it's just a latency issue. And, you know, we talk a lot about, like, synchronous, and that's cool and great, but that's not to say that, like, this idea of composability breaking is a little bit, I think, overblown, and I think, in ways just increase the, like, the thread. And there's a critical latency that you can have and tolerate in certain applications, and not all of them need to be like, like that.
00:59:57.874 - 00:59:58.394, Speaker B: There you go.
00:59:58.434 - 01:00:00.574, Speaker D: But, you know, I'm really dumb, and I'm not a developer.
01:00:01.714 - 01:00:33.950, Speaker B: Another intuition, right, is that every ethereum transaction comes with this. Like, I'm going to take out, what we call in programming, a mutex on the entire world. I'm going to take out a lock, I'm going to freeze the entire world and do a bunch of stuff and then unfreeze the world. And that's where you get synchronous composability from. But this, like, freeze the world primitive, can actually be written into the virtual machines of chains. So you can be like, I would like to freeze this, the world or this part of the world, and then only unfreeze that part of the world when something else happens. Right.
01:00:33.950 - 01:00:39.954, Speaker B: We have to build like, essentially programming languages to express these concepts, but there's no reason why we can't.
01:00:40.254 - 01:01:07.574, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, Java, the beauty of all this is programmable money. And I think. You sure? I mean, I think, like it. Fair enough. A lot of people hate flash loans because they're just like, allow for these exploits to happen. It's not the flash ones are bad, but I think, Bisaki, what you're saying is maybe you have some sort of guardrails and conditions that could actually be positive to protect at some point. Like what you could, I guess, like it's hard to, like, say, what is an adversary? Like, like malicious flash loan, if you will.
01:01:07.574 - 01:01:20.714, Speaker D: But if certain conditions are met, like, like if the oracle price jumps like crazy, then, well, maybe you shouldn't allow that synchronous, you know, flat like flash alone. Maybe you should, like, stop it. And so that's not bad in my mind.
01:01:21.134 - 01:01:50.386, Speaker B: I mean, it has been cool. This is the one thing that has been cool, has been watching Cosmos chains validator. I mean, there's this interesting liveness threshold too, which is Ethereum really has, even in v two, really prioritizes liveness. It's very hard. The chain doesn't halt. The cosmos network thinks of the liveness over the course of the, over the entire network as probably the thing to prioritize. And if an individual chain halts.
01:01:50.386 - 01:02:09.294, Speaker B: But this is also expressed in the Ethereum world, where roll up chains can halt without the Ethereum based chain halting. So we all end up at the same thing. But a lot of cosmos chains have defended themselves against software bugs and stuff like that by halting and fixing the bug without letting attackers walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars.
01:02:09.994 - 01:02:47.864, Speaker D: What are you, I mean, maybe transitioning more to. You guys have been around the space for such a long time. We can keep talking about Cosmos, which I want this to be a go to for people that want to learn about, generally want to learn about Cosmos and all the excitement that happening under the hood. But I'm also really curious to get your perspective on observing the space for so long. Kind of what are the things that if you weren't focused on what you're doing today, what else would you be doing? If you had total freedom of choice saying you can't do what you're doing now, what else would you be focused on and trying to fix in the space or, and, or build either the.
01:02:47.904 - 01:03:10.014, Speaker C: Interoperability thing, which is what I'm already working on. So I guess it's kind of cheating. And I guess if I can't pick interoperability, I would probably pick individual chain scaling. There's really cool stuff going on over at Solana. I remember talking to Anatoly and that team early when they were building. I was like, this is really cool. When I worked in web two stuff, I worked in a database that did a million inserts a second.
01:03:10.014 - 01:03:21.604, Speaker C: All that database optimization stuff is super fun. I'd probably say the database optimization, consensus optimization piece of it as well. What I would pivot to if I had to.
01:03:26.584 - 01:03:27.816, Speaker B: I continue to.
01:03:27.880 - 01:03:28.960, Speaker C: I already do all of it.
01:03:28.992 - 01:03:34.244, Speaker D: Saki's, like, looking on the right. He's like, well, here's my whiteboard. Let me see. There's ten things here.
01:03:35.504 - 01:04:12.584, Speaker B: I mean, like, I do work on a lot of different stuff, but privacy continues to be, like, a huge problem that needs to be sorted out. Like, all of the stuff that happens, like, the things that excite me are basically privacy MeV. I'm really excited. I do want to see the, I want to see the Ethereum roll up execution layers, become peers to the Cosmos SDK. That's like, that's really a thing I, like, want in my heart. Like, if I couldn't work on Cosmos, I couldn't work on the Cosmos SDK. I would probably be like, like, trying to.
01:04:12.584 - 01:04:34.912, Speaker B: I would be at optimism, trying to turn bedrock into a Cosmos SDK into, like, the next Cosmos SDK or at fuel or at, like, any of the ZK companies or, like, like, I like all of those things, like, feel to me like doing cosmos again. And I still, and I like, I don't think that any of this vision will be really correct until, like, we have those things become peers to the.
01:04:34.928 - 01:04:44.354, Speaker A: Cosmos decay because it's good for competition for the space, and it's good. Good. It's competition for Cosmos, and that inevitably is good for the space. Or, like, what? Why is that? Saki?
01:04:45.734 - 01:05:41.666, Speaker B: Because I fundamentally, like, I don't like, even within the cosmos, SDK, we've tried to build this, like, very flexible thing, and we're just constantly having to make trade offs, right? Like, we can't please every possible developer, you know? And I don't think that you can. So I just. I honestly, like, I think, like I said, I think the purpose of this space is to give, like, I'm an infrastructure builder. I think sommelier is probably the most applicationy thing that I've ever built in, like, the last, like, eight years. And it's still very infrastructure. And, like, there are team, like, we, there are decentralized teams really building the applications on top of sommelier, which is, like, tends to be my pattern, but so I'm an infrastructure builder, and what I want is the infrastructure for people to build truly amazing applications to exist so that the space actually ends up being worth a damn.
01:05:41.770 - 01:06:23.514, Speaker C: If IBC is actually successful, what it does is provides a common communication framework to allow these individual chain builders to optimize the shit out of that and for capital to flow to the most efficient, best run chains. And, like, the core goal here is programmable money, this global computing substrate that anyone can permissionlessly come and use, if that's our goal, having as many experiments as possible, as many crazy different architectures, what fuel is doing is fantastic. All of these different execution layers, that's how we get to mass adoption, really.
01:06:23.874 - 01:06:53.104, Speaker D: I, when I first learned about IBC, I was in, like, San Francisco blockchain week way back, and all the Berkeley folks were there. To me, that was, like, one of the more exciting things I've heard and has always been in the back of my mind. Like, I was just waiting and waiting and waiting for it, and then the whole kind of drama ensued and it was delayed. And you talk about, like, if it works, like, for us and listeners, like, how will, like, what are the KPI's? What are the things that you're looking at to measure success of IBC?
01:06:53.524 - 01:07:28.696, Speaker C: I think that we've seen huge amounts of volume travel across the system, and I think that was the first KPI that I wanted to see. And we mentioned Terra sort of obliquely on this podcast. But when Terra was connected to IBC, we were doing massive volume over those pipes, like tens of billions of dollars every month. That was really cool. The KPI's that I care about now are how many non Cosmos ecosystems get hooked up? I'm working actively on a Polkadot integration. We're working on a couple of privacy chain integrations. We need to really spin that effort up.
01:07:28.696 - 01:07:55.444, Speaker C: We talked about the e two IBC integration. There's a lot of sort of excitement and firmament about that right now. I expect that to pick up. But the KPI that I care most about is non Cosmos chains doing IVC right now. And I think that that's how if we're actually creating HTTP for blockchains, which is like, why I am in this, we need to support many different computing architectures. So, yeah, that's great.
01:07:56.024 - 01:08:29.574, Speaker D: How easy is it for developers? Like, how easy was it for the DyDX team to come out over and kind of learn about Zak? You mentioned how far along they were in their journey when you approached them. But I'm curious, do you think that's representative of new developers coming to the space and want to build on WASM and Cosmos wasm? And is that like a fairly. Is the tooling there? Is the developer experience there? And how does that compare to other ecosystems, like Solana, Polkadot, Ethereum? In terms of ease of onboarding of developers?
01:08:30.754 - 01:09:17.572, Speaker C: The cosmosm tooling for building on top of the sort of like Cosmos native VM thing is actually excellent. I've been avoiding rust, and Zackie will laugh for a long time because I'm a gopher, but I've been doing a lot of rust smart contract stuff lately because we've been working with a bunch of those teams, and you can write your contracts, generate a front end write off of it based on that, have all of your chain bindings ready to go. So that dev tooling has gotten a lot better. The Cosmos SDK dev tooling is actually also quite good in a lot of places. I think a huge problem, though, is people come into the ecosystem from all these different directions. And like ignite, which is the old Tinderman company, built the best Cosmos SDK onboarding tooling. It's called Starport.
01:09:17.572 - 01:09:58.788, Speaker C: Dennis now works for Strangelove, but that tooling is great. But there was a whole part of the ecosystem that was much more in the infrastructure side what Zackie and I work on, and we didn't have a whole lot of exposure to that. So when we brought new chains, then we'd be like, oh, yeah, here's this. Like, we have this way we've been doing it. So the way that sort of devtools proliferate throughout the ecosystem is not nearly as top down. And I think that that's been a huge problem for developer experience and discoverability. But there are excellent tools, and we're doing a lot right now in terms of Cosmos SDK dev to make it easier to build.
01:09:58.788 - 01:10:15.684, Speaker C: And, like, that's squarely where cosmos focused. The work that I'm doing right now is to build a dev environment for IBC and this asynchronous composability stuff. And I think that's kind of the furthest behind, but we're also way out ahead of other ecosystems.
01:10:16.224 - 01:10:30.526, Speaker A: Zaki, you mentioned Mev earlier. In blockchains, all roads lead to Mev. I'm just curious how you guys plan to. How you plan to capture Mev. How do you plan to distribute rewards from mev? I would just love to hear the mev plan.
01:10:30.640 - 01:11:07.398, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, the first. Okay, so, like, again, we'll start out with the lore. So Andrew Miller and his co authors had this consensus paper, which was the first consensus academic consensus paper ever to cite tendermint, which was very special to us, which actually talked about, like, building a consensus algorithm that had, like, what was essentially mev mitigation in it. It was called honey Badger back in the day. This is actually what helium uses on their blockchain, that there's not really any MEv on their blockchain. So it's kind of a little bit beside the point.
01:11:07.398 - 01:11:41.818, Speaker B: And they're giving up on it because it is a bit of a pain. But the other thing we did over the last year is there's this thing, it's, again, deep in the Cosmos dev environment called ABCI. It's one of Jay's original ideas, which is separating the consensus. So, like the consensus algorithm, the application layer are separate. You can actually. You don't have to use the Cosmos SDK to build cosmos chains. In fact, anoma and Penumbra are two very prominent examples of chains that are not using Cosmos SDK but are using tendermint and IBC.
01:11:41.818 - 01:12:27.542, Speaker B: So you can pick and choose the parts of the stack. And the fact that anoma and Penumbra have done all this work have made it easy for other teams to also use this, because before there was only one example of implementing IBC, now there's more than one, which is cool. So the way they interact with tendermin is this thing called ABCI. And so we have this thing called ABCI, which we've sketched out, which is we've made every step of the tendermint consensus algorithm programmable. So not just like we produce a block, you give it to the application, produce a block, you give it to that. But which is how currently ABCI works historically. So next Tendermint release has the first pieces of ABC I in it, Tendermind 0.37.
01:12:27.542 - 01:12:57.884, Speaker B: And ABCI is like a playground for building different ways of mitigating MeV. Mitigating Mev. Or like redirecting it, you can build all kinds of differences things. So like, just with the features of Tendermint 0.37, you can build enshrined proposer builders operation, or in features that are coming in Tendermint 0.38, you can build an encrypted mempool. You can build.
01:12:57.884 - 01:13:23.358, Speaker B: So what we are really trying to do in this typical Cosmos way is unleash the app chains to innovate on all the different possible ways of managing MeV. But also in Atom 2.0, we are doing this whole basic thing that is basically we want to broadly, across the interchange secured environment, do a version of in tried PBS to align incentives, correct.
01:13:23.526 - 01:13:52.366, Speaker A: All roads in blockchain lead back to meV. I feel like all roads in Cosmos lead back to your presentation or the cosmos presentation in ten or eleven days. So I'm excited about that. Zaki, one more question for you or Jack, whoever wants to take this is just like, does the best version of the cosmos thesis involve some proliferation of IBC on ETH? And I'm not sure if that's also a good pivot into sommelier and what you guys are building, but whoever wants to take that, I would say that.
01:13:52.470 - 01:14:25.042, Speaker B: So basically, the gravity bridge, we built this thing called the gravity bridge, which allows us to do IBC like, things between cosmos. And so we have sommelier. There's also a gravity bridge which does token bridging. The canto blockchain, which may be more familiar to Ethereum. Audience is a big user of that blockchain. There's also something called Axelar, there's also a bridging protocol called Axelar. But honestly, none of these things are as great as speaking native IBC.
01:14:25.042 - 01:15:02.290, Speaker B: If we could speak native IBC to Ethereum, it would be awesome. I would love to get rid of our. I would love to get rid of the gravity bridge from the sommelier stack, but we have most. But in the spirit of pragmatism, we have built the kind of application with sommelier that you could build on top of Ethereum in a world where Ethereum natively supported IBC. We have. And like, which is basically where, like, you actually have. We have.
01:15:02.290 - 01:15:49.694, Speaker B: We have some of the application logic lives on Ethereum. Like the user facing pieces of Ethereum, logic of application logic for interacting with familiars, defi apps lives on Ethereum. The governance strategy, rebalance, a lot of other layers, value accrual layers, incentive alignment layers, all live on the cosmos chain. And this produces, we think, a really cool segmentation of concerns that allows you to take advantage of this gas efficient alternate environment to do things that are hard to do on Ethereum, but giving people the benefit and the security of being on Ethereum mainnet for custody of funds. Because we don't bridge tokens on Sennellia, trade execution is what we bridge.
01:15:50.334 - 01:16:38.636, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that one way to think about this is the sort of cross chain versus interchain thing. And if you look at what sushiswap did, they want to deploy the same contracts on a bunch of different chains. And that has the obvious downsides of fragmenting liquidity, fragmenting control of the protocol, making things a lot more difficult to manage. And if you step back and look at it critically from an app architecture perspective, you'd like all of your management and control functions to live in one place and be controlled by a DaO or something. And then it would have these kind of storefronts on all of these different chains to allow it to take advantage of liquidity there. And that's exactly what we built with Som. The gravity bridge manages contracts on these different chains where it allows these users to come up to the storefront and buy financial products.
01:16:38.636 - 01:17:26.290, Speaker C: But all of the revenues for those accrue back to the Som validator set and back to the som token holders. And you know, this is also the way osmosis works. All of the liquidity for the Dex is on one chain and it has these storefronts on all of these other chains. And especially, you know, osmosis is working with the feature, working on a feature right now where you'll be able to send tokens in via IBC. They will swap in a pool that you specify, and then it will send the tokens back out via IBC, see, on any other channel. And then in that case, osmosis is really just this pool of liquidity, and people are sending tokens in and then they're going back out to wherever they want to go. And I think that's kind of the end state for all of these Dexs, is the interface that they expose is this IBC interface.
01:17:26.290 - 01:17:36.930, Speaker C: And then tokens are going to be moving between chains and swapping in flight. And that's what we built the infrastructure for. That's a great example of asynchronous discomposability.
01:17:37.122 - 01:18:02.280, Speaker A: Yeah, guys, this feels like a good place to start to think about wrapping this there. I think there's so much more Santi and I could. Could talk about with you guys liquid staking and, like, jack, I want to get. Really want to get your take on, like, general purpose zones and stuff, but I think we should probably leave that for a cosmos episode. Round two. I'm thinking maybe after the presentation. But is there anything else that, like, glaringly obvious questions that.
01:18:02.280 - 01:18:09.556, Speaker A: Or topics that you guys want to talk about or questions that Santia and I missed, or you want to save it for the next step? Santiago.
01:18:09.580 - 01:19:05.064, Speaker B: The things that are most misunderstood about Cosmos is, like, one of the ways in which we are, like, ethereum is that we are this much more of, like, a developer collective than we are, like, a company. Right. Jack and I happen to share some companies that we both created and stuff like that. But this is part of the whole fractal of relationships in cosmos. And people get, we onboard people into the ecosystem in all kinds of strange ways. We have join builders, which is actually a formal program now that the foundation runs, for getting into the cosmos. But just getting involved in the debate on Twitter, hitting people up on Twitter.
01:19:05.064 - 01:19:34.624, Speaker B: There are all kinds of strange and wonderful characters in the cosmos ecosystem, and every validator is running their own little influencer business, which is also just a fun little aspect of cosmos. It is a little bit of a. It is a little bit of an intimidating world. You know, when, when, you know, people, when. When funds everybody, people hit me up. They're like, how do we get on board? I'm like, there is no. It's not like there's one company.
01:19:34.624 - 01:20:09.804, Speaker B: There's. There's, like, all these companies, all these different funds, all these different things, but it is a very free environment. And I think to, like, kind of loop back, like, this is. This was a thing that made a big difference for DYDX, which was when they looked at, like, could we build what we need on arbitrum, on optimism, on starkware, they're like, we're talking to a vendor when they talk to Cosmos. They're like, here's a bunch of open source devs. How can we help? What do we want? What can we do together? How can you influence our roadmap? We will try to prioritize your needs. It's just a very natural give and take.
01:20:09.804 - 01:20:25.074, Speaker B: That is the way we build cosmos, and it's very different. So I think that's always the thing that is, like, I want to keep reemphasizing to different audiences because it's the thing that's, like, the most. Unlike all the other non ethereum ones.
01:20:26.214 - 01:21:04.630, Speaker D: Yeah. And I am like, I've heard this, for instance, yesterday, like, Starbucks announced a collaboration with Polygon. And you could argue that they don't have the best tech, but they hired this guy from YouTube, Ryan Watt, and he's been, I think, very good and convincing enterprises. And I think common criticisms I hear are enterprises have been seared into their mind that Solana has downtime issues because of all the kind of issues that it's had. True. Although unfair, because this has happened to other chains as well. But it's just very interesting.
01:21:04.630 - 01:21:54.314, Speaker D: It's sort of like the VHS versus Betamax kind of conundrum, if you will, which is. And the question really is, like, can you really be successful as this really kind of collective that you talk about? Or do you wish at some point, and maybe this is, like, the initial kind of idea behind tendermint that kind of disbanded for better or for worse. But I'm curious, if you had to redesign it from. And you go back in time, would you have had perhaps more structure or, like, a marketing department or something to go to really just be the front and center of anyone, like, particularly enterprises or, like, validators or whatever, and. Or do you think that that really kind of doesn't really matter in the long term?
01:21:55.494 - 01:22:21.774, Speaker B: Man, this is, like, the existential crisis that I feel like every single day on is, you know, like, I'm gonna be very honest. Like, I don't. Like, if you made me run the biz dev deal to, like, bring Starbucks onto a Cosmos chain, I think I would kill myself. I just don't care. Like. Like, this is not an exciting use.
01:22:21.814 - 01:22:25.474, Speaker D: Case of even if you got free coffee for life. No.
01:22:26.774 - 01:22:27.554, Speaker B: Yes.
01:22:28.414 - 01:22:30.274, Speaker C: Zack. Zackie's an Eric.
01:22:30.844 - 01:22:32.384, Speaker A: Like, that was a good shot.
01:22:35.124 - 01:22:36.624, Speaker D: Blonde roast, anyone?
01:22:37.084 - 01:23:00.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, honestly, it's so, like, to me, I'm kind of, like, you know, I'm glad. I'm sort of glad that these polygon people and their, like, army of South Asians can. Is, like, willing to, like, kind of do this, like, enterprise sales stuff. It's probably good for the space in the long run, but I do like the weird. I do. I do get more excited about weird defi shit than I do.
01:23:00.602 - 01:23:08.538, Speaker A: Is it polygon? Built on Cosmos? Tinderment? On tinderment. 2019 version of, like, the cosmos.
01:23:08.586 - 01:23:13.274, Speaker B: Yeah. They have a fork of a pre cosmos hub. Launch version of Tendermind.
01:23:13.394 - 01:23:16.386, Speaker D: I was waiting for Psyche to say that. I was like, when is he going to drop it?
01:23:16.570 - 01:23:37.702, Speaker C: There was an office park in Bangalore that, like, discovered the SDK hydrobot. Hydrobot in, like, 2018. And they all went on to found a bunch of companies. But vitwit is the team that's been working with the Polygon team for a long time, and they kind of were.
01:23:37.798 - 01:23:55.796, Speaker B: It's honestly just, like, hilarious that this one office park somehow got cosmos pilled and it's just kind of spiraled out from there and now covers the entire south subcontinent with various. There's so many indian cosmos teams and stuff like that.
01:23:55.820 - 01:24:00.492, Speaker C: It's just persistence and sentinel and. Yeah, there's a bunch of them.
01:24:00.668 - 01:24:13.660, Speaker A: Yeah, guys, this was a great conversation. Appreciate you guys. I'm marking it right now. We're going to do around two after the presentation. This is a fantastic conversation, and, yeah, appreciate you guys coming on Empire.
01:24:13.772 - 01:24:14.156, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:24:14.220 - 01:24:15.860, Speaker C: Gentlemen, thank you very much.
01:24:16.052 - 01:24:17.744, Speaker B: If I don't live up to the hype.
01:24:19.804 - 01:24:22.236, Speaker D: You definitely do. You definitely do. You don't.
01:24:22.340 - 01:24:30.012, Speaker B: No, no. At the presentation, like, if Adam 2.0 is not fire, like, you can just, like, bring me on and just, like, yell at me.
01:24:30.188 - 01:24:35.252, Speaker A: The real question people should be asking, it's not, is the merge priced in? It's, is Adam 2.0 priced in?
01:24:35.428 - 01:24:36.476, Speaker C: It's not.
01:24:36.660 - 01:24:37.292, Speaker B: It's not.
01:24:37.348 - 01:25:00.586, Speaker D: None of this is legal, financial, or any other advice, for that matter. And so now that I got that out of the way, I always say it. Where can people. Before we go and to condition people to prepare for the next episode, where can people keep tabs on you? What's happening in the ecosystem? What are the best? We'll link it to the show notes, but, like, what's, like, the top one? Two places where people can follow your work and see what you're up to on a constant basis.
01:25:00.770 - 01:25:06.426, Speaker C: Zackie? Twitter is a pretty good spot to follow Cosmos, as is my Twitter, I would say, but I'm a bit biased on that.
01:25:06.490 - 01:25:28.298, Speaker B: Cosmos is very much. I mean, that's another thing. It's like, we are very, like. I think that's one of the reasons that is different about Cosmos is I don't know why this is, but, like, cosmos founders of, like, different chains and all of them have, like, pretty good Twitter clout. Like, they're, like, pretty actively engaged. They, like. And so, like, you know, typically, like, when you go to a conference, like, you don't see, like, just me.
01:25:28.298 - 01:25:49.214, Speaker B: You see, like, two, three, four other Cosmos founders. They're on stage, they're like, whereas, like, you know, you go to a near a conference and, like, you just see Ilya from Nir and you're like, where are the other near people? Like, there must be. Well, they clearly exist. Like, they have their own conference, Elizabeth, right now. But, like, they don't, they're not really, like, out there, like, you know, mixing it up in the in the Internet.
01:25:49.294 - 01:25:55.874, Speaker C: Yeah. I think what a lot of people would say is because we didn't have any marketing, that's why we've all had to build our own Twitter followings.
01:25:57.054 - 01:26:03.678, Speaker A: Like, give me the marketing budget. All right, guys, this is a good place to wrap. Appreciate you guys coming on. This is awesome. And see you guys for round two.
01:26:03.846 - 01:26:04.894, Speaker D: Congrats on all the work.
01:26:04.974 - 01:26:05.414, Speaker C: Thank you, guys.
