00:00:02.760 - 00:00:24.554, Speaker A: Yeah, the timeline for crypto just keeps getting more and more surreal. Like every time we say wow, it's, you know, you will look back and like, it was crazy, and then it's like, oh, no, it's crazier. And so I'm just going to stop saying it because I guess we should expect the totally unexpected but very exciting times, right, sir?
00:00:25.554 - 00:00:33.394, Speaker B: Indeed. Indeed. I will, I will. I will say it's not just crypto, though. It is the entire financial system. It is crazy time, so. But anyways, it is good to have you back.
00:00:33.394 - 00:00:39.054, Speaker B: I know you took a couple little time off. Sounds like it was a good trip. It's good to have you back.
00:00:39.994 - 00:00:46.254, Speaker A: I obviously been following a lot of what's been happening and. Yeah, it's just a lot to cover.
00:00:46.594 - 00:01:01.258, Speaker B: Yeah. I really hope people aren't watching on YouTube. I feel like I'm looking real pasty white coming out of the winter. You clearly got some, some sun. Looking pretty tan these days. This is not a good contrast going on here. We need a little like the video editors need to.
00:01:01.386 - 00:01:04.534, Speaker A: It's really the light issue, you know, but.
00:01:07.354 - 00:01:26.252, Speaker B: Sweet, man. Where should we. Oh, I have housekeeping to cover. One is blockworks, three housekeeping things. One is for people who listen to Bell curve. We just announced that next season is going to be on MEV, and that Hasu is from flashbots is gonna co host that. So really excited about that.
00:01:26.252 - 00:02:19.786, Speaker B: The second piece of housekeeping is that we announced that digital asset summit, which is our buttoned up kind of institutional conference that we've been hosting for four years now in both New York and London. We are moving it to Washington, DC for 2024. 2024 DC. Huge year politically, but also just. We believe that DC is now the most important city in the world when it comes to crypto, and that the decisions made in DC with regulators, lobbyists and politicians is at least short term going to really impact the direction of crypto, which obviously we're going to talk a lot about on this episode. So we're moving digital asset summit to DC and partnering with the folks at the Blockchain Association, Jake and Kristen and the team over there. Then the third piece of housekeeping is that blockworks announced a grants aggregator yesterday or earlier this week.
00:02:19.786 - 00:02:52.784, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're calling it Grant farm yield farming in the bull, grant farming in the bear. And if you have 310 different grant programs listed and 125 different active rfps. So if you or your company is looking to go pick off grants or rfps or bug bounties, we should have everything listed there. But if you don't see something, if your protocol or your team or your dao is not listed, the grants are not listed there. Just hit me up dm me on Twitter and we can get those added asap. So that's the blockworks housekeeping for you.
00:02:53.604 - 00:02:56.788, Speaker A: That's. Well, that's really exciting. The grand stuff for sure.
00:02:56.956 - 00:03:02.004, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we're pumped about it. We're pumped about Das to moving to DC.
00:03:02.124 - 00:03:26.362, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, there's just so much that's happening. I would agree that DC has become increasingly important and they've. They've ratched. Like, there's certainly. I keep thinking about that episode we recorded with Jake and Rebecca last year. I was thinking of October, September. And he said, yeah, like, we can expect a lot of more kind of enforcement actions and regulatory activity.
00:03:26.362 - 00:03:37.332, Speaker A: And, you know, here we are. And, you know, fast forward. It seems like every other week it's. They've just been really increasing the. The activity. So maybe we just like tick through all of them and then.
00:03:37.418 - 00:04:00.504, Speaker B: And then come there. There are three big ones from this week. There's Coinbase, Coinbase, and Coinbase is obviously the biggest. Then Sushi and then Justin sun. Why don't we start with Coinbase? So basically the. I'm going to read Paul, what's his last name? The chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer at Coinbase. I'm going to read some of his tweet.
00:04:00.504 - 00:04:30.292, Speaker B: He posted a nice Twitter thread. Basically, Coinbase just received a Wells notice the. From the SEC. And for people who aren't familiar with wells notices, they specifically are not a huge deal, but they usually proceed an enforcement action. And specifically this enforcement action, it seems like is going to. Is going to be around. The SEC targeting Coinbases both spot market regarding some of the tokens they're listing, their staking service and potentially their.
00:04:30.292 - 00:04:54.784, Speaker B: Their wallet and Coinbase prime. So it's pretty big enforcement action that they think is coming down the pike. Um, let me read you some important things that I. That stood out to me from the blog post and from Paul's tweet. One is that over the past nine months, Coinbase met with the SEC more than 30 times. For the, uh, people trying to do some public mental math here, that is three times a month. More than three times a month.
00:04:54.784 - 00:05:31.316, Speaker B: That is almost every single week. Coinbase has been meeting with the SEC, sharing details of their business to try to build this path together towards registration and regulation. And what Paul said is that during the past several months, the SEC has basically given Coinbase zero feedback on what to change and how to register. And that instead today they received wells notice. And the backstory here is that when Coinbase filed to go public in 2021, the SEC, I don't know if you ever actually read the SEC, but it was so freaking detailed into Coinbase's ds one.
00:05:31.340 - 00:05:32.054, Speaker A: You mean.
00:05:32.244 - 00:06:16.520, Speaker B: Excuse me? Yeah, the s one. It was so freaking detailed on their entire business. And I went back and skimmed it and they had 57 different references to staking and details on their asset listing process. And so the SEC reads the s one, approves them to go public knowing all those details. Now they have changed their mind basically on what is allowed. And instead of having a conversation with Coinbase, they've basically just regulated by enforcement action. And so what, what Paul and the team did over there is that last July, almost twelve months ago, they filed a petition with the SEC calling for more regulatory clarity, which I think has kind of become the consensus in crypto, which is that we used to not want regulation.
00:06:16.520 - 00:06:21.504, Speaker B: Now it's like, okay, just give us regulation, but just like, just give us a framework here. Just give us some.
00:06:21.544 - 00:06:24.914, Speaker A: By the way, that that sentiment and approach has been going on for the last like six years.
00:06:25.024 - 00:06:25.566, Speaker B: Yeah, just.
00:06:25.590 - 00:06:42.234, Speaker A: Just give us something fundamentally important. And there was more, something more than bitcoin. People just went to the SEC and in different approaches and styles and said, can we just get clarity? Like, I've been in that position and it's not, it's not coming.
00:06:42.614 - 00:07:14.232, Speaker B: Right. Well, I remember, do you remember Jay Clayton? Obviously. So Clayton was not super friendly on crypto, but he was at least always willing to take a meeting and always willing to have a conversation and to work with folks and to give them feedback. And under Gensler, the SEC basically just stonewalled these companies. And now the strategy, we talked about this when Rebecca and Kristen were on the podcast. The strategy is just stay as far away as possible. Coinbase has taken a different approach and is like, look, we'll power through it.
00:07:14.232 - 00:07:49.860, Speaker B: We've got a lot of money behind us, good policy and legal team. We're going to go meet with them. And that has completely, I think the SEC, it's fair to say, kind of backstabbed them. And the reason this is so crazy is that Coinbase is a licensed and regulated crypto business in a bunch of first world countries like Australia and Germany and Singapore and Ireland. And they're even regulated by other us federal regulators. Right. They have a DCM and a DCO license from the CFTC and many other us state regulators who give out money transmitter licenses.
00:07:49.860 - 00:08:02.980, Speaker B: The SEC, I think, has basically gone rogue here, and they remain the sole outlier here. So that's my high level overview on what's happening and a couple of my thoughts, but I'd be curious to get your take on this.
00:08:03.132 - 00:08:40.098, Speaker A: I go back to. So there was an enforcement action similar to Kraken, and they settled on their staking program. There was an important distinction, I think, where the same, like the Coinbase folks came out and said, our staking program is structured very differently and this is why it's compliant. Whereas Kraken was paying not based on like algorithmic, like, network inflation and staking rewards, it was more at their discretion. And that was, I think, the issue with the Kraken staking program. Coinbase, on the other hand, and my understanding is they just. They're just flowing through whatever is being paid out by a particular blockchain.
00:08:40.098 - 00:09:30.724, Speaker A: So if you're staking your ETH, CB ETH, then the reward itself is based on the staking emissions, like the rewards that are being emitted by the blockchain. And then, of course, they're taking some sort of fee for providing that service. And I think that's very different. And so it's just interesting because then that no longer seems to be the case. And so I would be really curious to understand then, what is the issue with Coinbase's earn program? Is it all of. Just full on all of the staking kind of earned programs, or is it particular blockchain, particular specific token itself? Or that has been problematic. And, yeah, the second one is kind of the registry, like the listing process, which, I mean, they seem to think that it hasn't changed since they ipo'd.
00:09:30.724 - 00:10:05.528, Speaker A: And then the question is, which assets in particular are problematic, or is it all of them? Or just. I mean, it gets to the broader question of, you know, which has been in the past. Like they. They just go after certain tokens that they deem to be securities, but they do it in a sort of a way which is very specific. So, yeah, a lot to unpack. I really like the thread that Brian Armstrong came out saying, like, said, hey, listen, we will fight this. He made a great analogy, said, it sounds like, you know, the rules.
00:10:05.528 - 00:10:40.074, Speaker A: Like, we were clear to do this in April 2021. And then the referee just came back and said, oh, no, we're going to change the actual ruling here on the field, which is like, really. I can appreciate why it's really frustrating. And so, I mean, I tend to view this as there are three, I think, really important regulatory kind of processes going on in the US. One of them, of course, is now Coinbase. The second one is the grayscale. The grayscale one, I think there's a lot of things going on there, but part of it is approving an ETF.
00:10:40.074 - 00:11:44.550, Speaker A: And so I guess those two are really important for crypto because they will hopefully provide just more clarity. And I think if you just look at how the judges have been responding in the grayscale case, it's really been kind of more favoring, like grayscale, I would say, and toning down the SEC's kind of what they are actually entitled to kind of regulate and go after. And so, look, I think it's very early to say if that's going to be the case here, but I certainly think one, Coinbase has a lot of resources to fight this and they want to do that. And second, I think it just brings more awareness in the space. And I think we'll also shed light on broader sentiment, which is the SEC, as a reminder for folks, doesn't have the ability to implement policy, can regulate through these enforcement actions. But that doesn't mean that's not the rule of law. It sets a precedent for sure, but it's not rulemaking.
00:11:44.550 - 00:11:59.368, Speaker A: That's up to Congress. And so Brian, of course, also said, hey, listen, it's really important, as you said, of how we elect congressmen and other elected officials. And I think that's going to be a big part of the next election cycle in the US.
00:11:59.496 - 00:12:32.302, Speaker B: Yeah. Here's. I think one of the most important things to know about this is that Paul and Brian and the whole Coinbase team, I mean, first off, pretty remarkable response from a publicly traded company to come out against the SEC like this. Like, first off, just, you know, kind of air collapse for them right now. The Coinbase lawsuit is going to take forever. There are going to be facts. If there are facts to fight over, which Coinbase will find facts to fight over, it will go to an appeal.
00:12:32.302 - 00:13:03.350, Speaker B: And Gary's going to be gone in two years, Max. If you talk to people on the Hill, if you talk to people in DC, he is one of the most detested people in DC right now. I don't think he actually cares about regulating Coinbase. I don't think compliance of Coinbase and regulation here is the goal. I think the goal for Gary right now is pure chaos. I think his goal, the lawsuit itself is the goal. Compliance and regulation of Coinbase is not the goal.
00:13:03.350 - 00:13:14.238, Speaker B: The goal is to distract and delay long enough to throw all of crypto to basically throw it off. And I think that's important to recognize.
00:13:14.286 - 00:13:29.194, Speaker A: Here we just, in summary, like I said, three, as I mentioned to the other one is the Ripple case XRP, which has gone on for years. So in summary, Coinbase, Grayscale plus Ripple, three independent cases I think will, my hope is expedite regulatory clarity in the US, which we haven't had.
00:13:30.134 - 00:13:30.702, Speaker B: But you're right.
00:13:30.718 - 00:14:10.022, Speaker A: I mean there are some conspiracy theories going on around. Like is this just a broader kind of full on attack on crypto when you then layer on top of what has happened to signature and Silvergate and the manner in which that has happened and then the USDC situation, and then my understanding is that Kraken also is in a bit of a tight spot here because I think ach withdrawals and deposits just are no longer enabled. And I think a lot of basically they're going after the on ramps for crypto. And if you shut that down, then it becomes really problematic to get exposure to the space and it really hinders the space from a growth perspective.
00:14:10.118 - 00:14:59.246, Speaker B: Preston. Yeah I want to put on my, I just fully agree with you. I dont want to put on my tinfoil hat too much here. But its very interesting that this is coming at the same time as the, whats the right way to put this? Not the collapse of the financial system, but SVB and signature and First Republic and all, and the banking system having its biggest catastrophe since, since 2008. If you want to put on the tinfoil hat, you say that. Here's the take the regional banks and the two biggest risks to centralized financial control and CBDC implementation in the United States are regional banks and crypto. And if regional banks and crypto won't back down and aren't naturally dying out, you have to systematically eliminate both of those.
00:14:59.246 - 00:15:47.994, Speaker B: And that would be my tinfoil take of the goal here is financial control and better surveillance and CBDC implementation, which feels inevitable at this point. And there are two things standing in the way for that to happen, and it's crypto and regional banks. And when you think about Gary and it's like, when something like this is happening, it's like, what is his motive here? Gary wants to take Yellen's job. Right? Gary, Gary wants to be in that treasurer seat. And that would be a role that directly looks over financial control and CBDC implementation. And I think he might be trying to make his potential job in two years from now easier. So that's my tinfoil hot take, well.
00:15:49.054 - 00:17:02.248, Speaker A: I don't want to get too far deep down the rabbit hole, but there is this thing that I want to make people aware of, which is executive order 6102 that was enacted at April 5, 1933, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and that basically prohibited anyone from holding gold. And so, of course, there are certain folks that are looking at that and saying, are they actually at some point going to ban owning crypto in the US? It's happened before with gold, and it's not crazy to think that it will happen again with crypto at some point. And, well, like, what does that actually mean? And I don't know what the probability of that happening is, but it's certainly like autism capital discount on Twitter. Then I would agree with this take, which is there's absolute non zero chance that the US federal government comes for personal crypto asset seizure at some point for american citizens. And just today, again, the SEC, I'm kind of, like, processing all this live. The SEC has, like, a general resources website link, and they issued a press release today saying, again, continue to exercise caution for crypto assets.
00:17:02.248 - 00:17:07.896, Speaker A: It's sort of an investor alert. So this White House that is such shit.
00:17:07.960 - 00:17:14.604, Speaker B: That is bitcoin is up 45% since the banking system had biggest collapse in 15 years.
00:17:15.064 - 00:17:25.232, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I mean, look at that. There's all these great memes, which is like, the White House also had a report on it, like, earlier this week. So, of course, like, okay, did you.
00:17:25.248 - 00:17:26.364, Speaker B: Read the White House report?
00:17:26.944 - 00:17:38.344, Speaker A: I mean, it's like, do they actually understand the space? Like, they were like, there's a great chart saying, like, which. Which derivatives platforms? And, like, these are like, half of them. Like, are obviously, like, not legit. So let me read these.
00:17:38.384 - 00:17:55.368, Speaker B: Let me read these. For anyone who didn't read the White House report, the top ten crypto derivatives platforms according to the US government. BTCEx, binance, BTCC. Here's the fourth one. Deepcoin. I went to deepcoins website on my phone. It didn't work on mobile.
00:17:55.368 - 00:18:16.352, Speaker B: The website didn't work on mobile. Bing X, Bitget, OKX, Bybit, Mexc. Those are real bitmart. Like, they don't, they have no clue. They're so far off from knowing what these, what the, what this industry looks like. It's. Yeah, it's.
00:18:16.352 - 00:18:17.816, Speaker B: It's pretty wild to see.
00:18:17.880 - 00:18:56.064, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of thoughts around what's happening recently. Like, I want to zoom out. Just like, I don't want to go too much deep into what has happened in SVB and some of the regional banks. And. But, I mean, I'd be remiss not to, like, think about, like, okay, there's clearly something going on with a lot of banks, and more and more people are waking up this idea of, okay, what actually happens when you deposit your money in a bank and very quickly, trust can degrade in this environment where the world is uber connected and information moves really fast. And so these bank runs happen.
00:18:56.064 - 00:19:44.474, Speaker A: Now, I'm not saying that all regional banks are, are exposed like Silicon Valley or First Republic, but, I mean, a lot of it is just social consensus, right? And if consensus can tilt really quickly, you saw it on Wall street bets. You saw it now with Silicon Valley bank with basically, I think, 35% of their depositor base wanted to withdraw on a particular day. No single bank is structurally engineered to process that. And so, yeah, as a generation, you're waking up this idea of, like, okay, well, you kind of do value a lot of the core principles of crypto. And you're right. I mean, I think you look at that and you, you have a lot of really important certainties when you're interacting crypto that just, you don't have in the traditional system, and more and more people are waking up to that.
00:19:44.594 - 00:19:44.938, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:44.986 - 00:21:04.250, Speaker A: And so, like, I always, like, during this period, which I think is actually unprecedented, like, I think we'll look back in this moment and say this was, like, a very important, perhaps we're seeing another 2008 event unfolding in real time. And I sort of feel that. But I was reminded during this period of, like, when I first discovered crypto, you just sort of think through different scenarios and say, okay, and what. What does the world look like when bitcoin becomes like a global reserve asset? Like, what does it actually mean? And in one version, it's really kind of more rosy, which is it becomes like, things become denominated in bitcoin, and it becomes such an important thing that every country kind of adopts it. But the more likely scenario is it's not an easy transition, and you can understand why people that control the money printing don't like that. And the second observation that I want to, just to get your take on is so, like, if you think, like, regional banks have a problem, like, fundamentally, the problem is, like, this duration mismatch, right? Like, you're holding these securities, you know, to maturity, but, like, if you get withdrawals, you have to sell them. And if you're selling 0%, like, bonds, there's, like, a very simplistic rule of thumb, which is for every, like, 1% increase in rates.
00:21:04.250 - 00:21:33.786, Speaker A: Like, there's, like, some, like, like, basically, if you need to sell it, like, the discount on that is. Is like, similar. And of course, all these banks are holding 0% treasuries. Treasuries are now 3% or 4%. And so if they need to sell those treasuries that they bought a year ago at 0%, that creates a big gap. The regional banks got bailed out by the US government. What happens to all the central banks that are holding a lot of these treasuries at 0%? They also have liabilities and pensions to fulfill.
00:21:33.786 - 00:21:50.504, Speaker A: They also, by the way, unlike regional banks that got bailed out, they can't be bailed out, and they can't print money as easily without consequences. Here's what happens to them. If you're a central banker in some sort of country and you're holding a lot of these treasuries, aren't you thinking about bitcoin right now?
00:21:50.664 - 00:21:53.044, Speaker B: Okay. Lot to break down there.
00:21:53.704 - 00:21:54.296, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:21:54.400 - 00:21:55.240, Speaker B: Lots of analysis.
00:21:55.272 - 00:21:58.472, Speaker A: Arizona empire, sir. There's a lot of thoughts in my mind.
00:21:58.648 - 00:22:22.356, Speaker B: Yeah. Clearly you had a good little trip. A lot of time to think what I think here. Okay, here's the transition to bitcoin as a global reserve currency. There is no scenario in this world where that is a smooth transition. The US dollar is the global reserve currency. There's no.
00:22:22.356 - 00:22:57.040, Speaker B: We've. I don't think. I mean, we've never had the global reserve currency experience colossal inflation or hyperinflation or whatever it may be. And to people who say that that is not coming, I'm not trying to fear monger or whatever, and I'm sure people saw that, like, saw the Balaji bet. It's starting to feel like that at some point, the US is going to have to choose between keeping its banking system and keeping the US dollar from runaway inflation. Those are like the two. I don't think you, like, fast forward.
00:22:57.040 - 00:24:00.212, Speaker B: Like, I don't think it's the Balaji 90 days thing, but I think it's like, at some point, whether it's a year from now or two years from now or three years from now, the US is going to have to make a really conscious decision between, do you save the banking system or do you save the US dollar? And ten times out of ten, I think they'll choose the banking system. And so then it's like, okay, what does that do for the US dollar? Gives it this runaway inflation, and we've never seen a world where the global reserve currency. I don't think we have, maybe we have, goes through this, goes through this extreme inflation. So I don't think, I don't think it's an easy transition. But one last point, just to your thing about these sovereigns and these central banks holding treasuries, that is the bold case for bitcoin. Here you have, let's like, 2012 to 2013 cycle was driven by libertarians and technologists. 2016 to 2017 was retail flooding in 2020 to 2021 was institutional money, high net worth money, trying to get in, trying to basically find upside in this colossal, like, you know, COVID world where money was being printed.
00:24:00.212 - 00:24:15.052, Speaker B: 2024 to 2025 could be driven by sovereigns in this race for defensive positioning against a world where the global reserve currency is inflating away. So I've really gone full tinfoil hat on this.
00:24:15.108 - 00:25:15.164, Speaker A: No, no. I mean, is it because I fundamentally think that, like, I don't think we're crazy in thinking that. I just have this feeling that an intuition that these are really unprecedented times, like probably more so than 2008, because a lot of what happened in 2008, you just didn't have a system, an alternative system. Now you do, and the world's become more connected and it just poses the question of, like, if 2008 would have happened and you had crypto around, what would have happened then and there, now the financial systems feels increasingly fragile in other ways than it was in 2008. Now you do have an alternative system. And so, yeah, I mean, it's going to be really interesting to observe that probably will forecast or predict a few things. Regulator activity is going to continue to increase.
00:25:15.164 - 00:26:21.324, Speaker A: Like, if you didn't think that adoption of crypto is going to happen without regulator really ramping up their efforts to stop this, then just look at what happened in China over the last ten years. Like, they've been trying to ban bitcoin and crypto forever because it allows citizens to kind of, like, for capital to flee a country that fundamentally has tried to stop that. And so, you know, that's problematic, right? When most chinese, like, nationals can only buy real estate and government bonds and now all of a sudden they can buy some, like, you know, crypto, then that's really problematic for them because they can't control that. And, you know, anyways, that's just one example. The other one is like, I would encourage people to understand what has happened to bitcoin in moments where, like, there's been banking crises, like Cyprus experience, bank run, and then bitcoin really gained a lot of adoption there. And so, yeah, to say the least, I've been warming up to bitcoin quite a bit, especially not only because of macro and not just bitcoin for that matter, but like bitcoin at one point I just didn't own any. Now I definitely do.
00:26:21.324 - 00:26:59.064, Speaker A: And I think a lot of that is also we had munib coming on. It's been very encouraging to see kind of the sentiment shift and the developer community. It seems like bitcoin to utilize this untapped, a lot of liquidity and capital that's kind of stuck there and do something more than that. That's number one. Number two is obviously all the stuff that's going on. If there is a version where there's mass adoption, it's probably going to happen first with bitcoin and then flow into other projects, of course, really continue to be really encouraged by Ethereum and some of the other projects and use cases. But yeah, at a fundamental level.
00:27:00.924 - 00:27:01.188, Speaker B: I.
00:27:01.196 - 00:27:03.464, Speaker A: Think bitcoin really takes off first.
00:27:04.244 - 00:27:57.696, Speaker B: I think that I want to dig into that, into just your bitcoin positioning for a second. But bitcoin gets mass adoption if we are forced to adopt crypto in a way that is, in a, in a way that isn't like a pretty way, I'd say Ethereum gets mass adoption if we are able to adopt crypto in a way that is like good for the world. I'd say things getting built, apps getting built that are really friendly and like easy to consume and just better products, that's the path for ethereum to get adopted. The path for bitcoin to get adopted is, I'd call it forced adoption, is when people are looking for a way to opt out of the financial system and store their capital in a digital bank that doesn't have any collateral risk. Then bitcoin gets adopted.
00:27:57.880 - 00:27:58.552, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:58.688 - 00:28:13.532, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me, let me ask you, Santi, so you rotated it out of, do you rotate out of some alts or out of some e into cash? Out of some cash. And what percent is of your, what's your, like, ETH to bitcoin ratio right now?
00:28:13.728 - 00:28:36.204, Speaker A: 80 20. Still continue to be heavily, like, I'm counting Ethan ETH. Well, actually pure ETH and bitcoin, it's like probably, probably 70 30. If I count other projects that are like part of the ethereum network, then it's higher, obviously. But from a pure comparison, probably. I mean, it's still heavily skewed towards.
00:28:36.244 - 00:28:43.664, Speaker B: E. And is there anything that could make you go into, allocate even more to bitcoin?
00:28:44.084 - 00:28:58.916, Speaker A: I just want to time the way that I rotate out of cash, I program like I've always. The kind of approaches is like I want to accumulate over time and like cost average my way in. So I'm doing more of that.
00:28:59.060 - 00:28:59.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:59.604 - 00:29:44.742, Speaker A: With pure cash that's been like sitting there in a bank account. So yeah, it's pretty interesting. Like if you would have like DOS, like there was some stat that I did, someone in a group like kind of posted if you like, cost average your dollar, like DC eight in like dollar cost average into bitcoin since it hit like its peak of 61,200 or something. Since that moment in time to now you're basically in profit. I fundamentally think that that's like, again, none of this is advice, but for me it's difficult to time these markets and entry points. But I just generally think that like when sentiments very sour and these kind of things are happening, for me, it's a better way to not try to time the market and just kind of build a position based on certain parameters. And so that's kind of how I'm approaching it.
00:29:44.742 - 00:30:00.676, Speaker A: So I don't want to buy all at once. But I am looking to answer your question concretely. I'm looking to increase that ratio more towards bitcoin. And that's not to say that I'm like selling ethereum to buy bitcoin. It's more. So I'm rotating cash into bitcoin.
00:30:00.780 - 00:30:27.674, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me ask you this. It feels pretty clear that any american crypto investor should actively distrust this administration and that the risk of holding your crypto in a custodied exchange is getting to be a little bit scary. What are your thoughts on holding crypto inside of even one of the tier one exchanges right now? Just too risky to do as an American or you think it's fine?
00:30:28.414 - 00:30:51.944, Speaker A: Well, you have to count their balance out. Are they going to properly set up their keys and manage security? Right. I continue to believe the US is a country where the system and the judicial system, you have to have faith in the courts. You just kind of have to. If not, then I don't know. It's difficult to operate. But I do have faith.
00:30:51.944 - 00:31:49.922, Speaker A: And this is why I go back to this example of it's been very interesting to observe how a judge responds and reacts to a case where the SEC is kind of one end of the spectrum, really aggressive, maybe overstepping, and then the judge kind of tones it back and says, wait a minute, let's actually look at the rulemaking and what the SEC is allowed to do and not allowed to do. And let's objectively talk about this, which I want to give the, the US legal system an opportunity to respond to what is, to your point, felt like a bully in a space that just wants to cut this and not give any guidance and go after certain companies, Coinbase, meeting them three times a week and then just like that feels like a bit of bullying. I want to understand how the courts interpret that and any kind of judicial like response that I think is going to be fundamentally important for me to form a full opinion on how this will kind of play out.
00:31:50.058 - 00:31:51.658, Speaker B: Really? Yeah.
00:31:51.826 - 00:32:17.824, Speaker A: So that's it. And so I don't know how long that's going to take, by the way, but encouraged by, like, I'm not a, like, Ripple. Some people are now like the enemy of your enemies, like my friend. And so, like, look, I think Ripple has a lot of resources. It's been fighting a battle for years now. So these things are going to take, unfortunately, more time. But there's a few of them that I think will bring in shed more clarity.
00:32:17.824 - 00:32:57.732, Speaker A: I am investing, and today I committed to investing in another wallet, which is really kind of like, I can't talk a lot about it. I will at some point because I want to talk to a team if they allow me to do that. But it's really leveraging account abstraction and a lot of really cool principles that make it easier and more intuitive for people to. And also secure for people to, like self custody, their own assets. So thematically, we talked about wallets here with Xiao and a few. I think wallets are going to be very, very important account abstractions. Comes at a fundamentally important time where people should be more and more thinking about self custody.
00:32:57.732 - 00:33:24.120, Speaker A: Now, I don't want to say take your coins off exchanges now, I'll balance that comment by saying I've been really impressed with Coinbase. Full disclosure, I have position in Coinbase, but I just think that it's been refreshing to not only, like, understand the roadmap and their willingness to, like, really just push the space forward. And as someone that has been in the space, like, I want to support them.
00:33:24.152 - 00:33:24.416, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:24.480 - 00:33:46.432, Speaker A: And I fundamentally also think that it's a name that I track a lot of to understand what the broader sentiment is. And look, you look at Coinbase and people don't understand their business, they don't understand the roadmap, their vision. And I think it's, it doesn't get enough credibility from like, Wall street and crypto natives.
00:33:46.488 - 00:33:46.680, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:46.712 - 00:34:01.144, Speaker A: It's like really impressive to them because it's probably like a really kind of shitty position to be in. Right. You're not in either camp and you always get shit from both camps. But even more impressive, they continue to put on the really cool stuff.
00:34:01.264 - 00:34:36.422, Speaker B: Yeah. Though I do think that as Coinbases embrace this more, like on chain mentality, I'd be hard pressed to find people in crypto who are not behind Coinbase right now. And if you're not behind Coinbase's vision right now, I'm not sure what you really do in crypto right now. Yeah. I mean, Coinbase is on the front lines. I think the most important thing that you brought up there, Santu, was you have trust in the US legal system. And I think that's an important reminder that ultimately Coinbase is ready to fight here and they're in a really strong position to do this.
00:34:36.422 - 00:35:01.860, Speaker B: And it's a reminder that the SEC does not make the law. The SEC makes allegations which ultimately get tested in court. And oftentimes, as we're potentially seeing with Grayscale, the SEC is wrong. Right. We talked about this on the roundup a couple of weeks ago. The SEC got picked apart by grayscale attorneys in the appellate panel in the DC circuit. And you can bet that Coinbase is ready to do the same in the coming months.
00:35:01.860 - 00:35:21.540, Speaker B: And it'll probably honestly take years, the coming years. And between Grayscale and Coinbase, these two firms. Yeah, and ripple. But whatever you think of those firms, whether you like them or not, they are now that someone posted this on Twitter, like the torch bearers of stopping the death of crypto in the US. And I don't think that is overstated.
00:35:21.652 - 00:35:51.934, Speaker A: So, yeah, like, look, if you're a politician in the US and you're running for public office, I think next cycle, I wonder. I'm not, I'm not. I can't vote in the US, but, like, I think this crypto is going to become a topic of conversation, more important than before, which is an obvious take, but more so, I may be asking you, and I wonder what our listeners think that are based in the US, how important do you think crypto is going to be in the next election cycle?
00:35:57.114 - 00:36:24.350, Speaker B: Interesting. You say that. I'm in San Francisco and have just had a lot of meetings with folks in San Francisco, and topic of conversation in nearly every meeting is 2024 elections. It will be. I don't think it'll be a big topic of conversation. It won't be a top down thing. It's not like you have Trump and DeSantis and Nikki Haley and Biden getting up there and talking about crypto that much, I don't think that's going to be a thing.
00:36:24.350 - 00:36:46.730, Speaker B: What I do think will be a thing is where crypto money flows and which candidates they support. And there is one candidate that basically the entire industry has pooled their money together and is pushing forward right now. And because they are. Because people think that they will be pro crypto. So.
00:36:46.922 - 00:37:19.724, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I would think so. It's just fundamentally, like, just, I want to really emphasize this point. Like, I think that good governments are ones that have really robust system where not a single person or entity can at will change core principles and rules. And I think that sometimes can be lost when you see all this noise. And so I. You have to have faith in that. If that's not the case and change the system.
00:37:19.724 - 00:37:56.856, Speaker A: But the US, I think, has a really good, like, three prong system of checks and balances. And when one comes out, really, one is skewed. You're sort of banking on. At the end of the day, there's a legal interpretation of what, you know, certain people can and can't do. And, like, also, like, I just, like, would love, like to understand, like, you always want to go to first principles. Like, what is the harm that is being done here? You know, there's been a lot of harm done because there hasn't been an ETF approval. You know, like, look at the discount of GBTC.
00:37:56.856 - 00:38:17.488, Speaker A: It's been like seven. What is it, $7 billion of, like, that gap. Like, that's true. That's a lot. Like, what at this point? Like, it's a trillion dollar asset class. It has a ton of innovation and human capital behind it. Like, come on, guys, like, what's the end goal here? Consumer protection.
00:38:17.488 - 00:38:35.674, Speaker A: Fine. No one in. Most people in crypto are not. Only the scammers don't want. Everyone in crypto can agree that we. Yes, we want fair, transparent markets. Yes, we want information disclosures that everyone's on the same foot because that then increases the likelihood of other market participants to enter crypto, and it should be a fair market.
00:38:35.674 - 00:38:56.526, Speaker A: Like, we all agree that it's a transparent system. God damn it. Not everyone can read a smart contract, but that's okay. Like, all of this information is in the public record by default. It is a system that is built because it's transparent. How is that. How did that narrative all of a sudden become, this space needs to be, is super bad and stay away from it.
00:38:56.526 - 00:39:23.454, Speaker A: Like, I don't know. Like, we're going to look back on this and say, okay, it was very clear why people didn't want this to gain adoption. But it's sort of like, if you, what's the end state? There's this notion of a fear victory. Like, you win, but you lose so much. Do you really want, like, all, like, this. This innovation capital will not go away. Like, I think it's captivated the imagination of developers and people.
00:39:23.454 - 00:39:51.400, Speaker A: And I just spent the last week with, admittedly, people that either don't like crypto or don't know much about it, more older people. And the way that I've been explaining it to more folks, and I tweeted about this today, which is, I'm not asking you to believe in any coin. So, like, before we, like, they ask you, like, oh, you're in crypto. It's like, oh, you know, but like, you know, they either come up with some weird thing, like, I love Cardano, which is like, surprisingly, like, a lot of people that I meet are like, I love Cardano.
00:39:51.432 - 00:39:53.856, Speaker B: Like, every, every uber driver everywhere.
00:39:54.000 - 00:39:54.512, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:39:54.568 - 00:39:55.496, Speaker B: And the other one is like, oh.
00:39:55.520 - 00:40:47.104, Speaker A: You know, like FTX and all this crap. You're like, listen, let's not even talk about price. Let's just agree on the reason of existence of this space. Can we agree that before crypto, you couldn't have digital property and immutability? Like, those two properties are really fundamentally what makes crypto, crypto special. Because you talk to anyone out there, they're the collector or they're a lawyer, or they're a real estate investor or an artist, you're like, okay, wouldn't it be nice to now have the enforceability of something digital, which everything now is mostly digital property records. There's a lot of art that's digital information propagated in a digital manner. Wouldn't it be nice to have a seal of approval that says, this happened and there's a record of that, of time and space, and you can't change that, and no one can change that.
00:40:47.104 - 00:41:11.862, Speaker A: A lot of people say, well, in the US, we trust our local office. There's a public record. I'm like, fine, if you're not in the US and in other countries, then this is really valuable. But even in the US having that redundancy, it's almost like an insurance policy. You bought a property, you have a deed, you have a land title, you own that. But it's also digital record. And anyway, and it's, no one can modify that.
00:41:11.862 - 00:41:45.372, Speaker A: And, oh, by the way, the court can also recognize that record in a digital context, which cannot be tampered with. Now, you tell me that you don't think that that's a killer use case. You probably don't know anything about business and how the world works, and then you then understand, and then the question is, oh, yeah, like, I believe in blockchain, but not crypto. I'm like, that's like, that's like advanced crypto for dummies, which is like, you can't have the coordination and all the funky cryptography happen without a token. But you never want to say that to people. They'll kind of slowly understand that once they start using it. So you just say, okay, fine, just.
00:41:45.372 - 00:42:32.194, Speaker A: Just go use crypto, and then come back and, like, tell me, like, you know, I mean, but, like, it's a bit of a rant, but that's been my approach now to a lot of people. And I bring this up because how do we, like, gain approval of people and how do we onboard people? And I think fundamentally, that's been a problem of crypto. That's like a marketing problem that we have. There's no coordinated narrative on it. Unfortunately, there's a lot of focus on price. But I think if we just tone it back and say, okay, like, let's just understand how in your daily life, this could actually be super helpful. Everyone can agree on, I think, that digital property and immutability, core concepts, and then you're saying, which chain actually can provide that security? And then I think that's kind of the flow.
00:42:32.194 - 00:42:44.794, Speaker A: And that, I think should be more and more emphasized in the public discourse when we talk about why this space shouldn't try to be killed. And so, anyways, I don't know what you think about that, but I'll stop talking.
00:42:45.714 - 00:42:46.974, Speaker B: That was a good rant.
00:42:47.754 - 00:42:51.298, Speaker A: I'm telling you, man, there's a lot that I've been thinking about.
00:42:51.426 - 00:43:43.058, Speaker B: Here's what I'd say. Crypto still, this is GBT. It's general purpose technology that presents this immense potential, but also has new challenges. And whenever you have that, it's really important for policymakers and regulators and politicians not to play venture capitalist and not to try to guess which technology is going to be valuable and which isn't, and to remain to basically keep tech neutrality as a core principle of good policy for as long as humanly possible. And you have a whole industry of VC's, like, picking winners and losers is hard enough for the professionals. It's a really dangerous game when government should get out of it. And I don't know if you've ever, have you ever heard of Minitel? Do you know Minitel? Here's a fun little history thing.
00:43:43.058 - 00:44:27.230, Speaker B: Minitel was this video text online service that was accessible through phone lines. It was probably the world's most successful online service prior to the World Wide Web. It was invented in France. And in the Internet's early days, the french government, or France had a state run, it was a state run service called Minitel, and it offered news directories and e commerce. The one thing that they got wrong is they said that they didn't need to adopt the Internet. They said that Minitel was sufficient and that no new infrastructure was needed. Well, you can, I, you can assume you can guess what happened to Minnitel.
00:44:27.230 - 00:44:38.314, Speaker B: There's no minitel anymore. We shut down because they didn't adopt the Internet. And I don't know, like, that's just a familiar, like, you just think about that. And replacement with, like, the financial system right now.
00:44:38.354 - 00:44:38.906, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:44:39.010 - 00:44:40.082, Speaker B: It's a familiar story.
00:44:40.178 - 00:45:30.964, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, it's so crazy to think that, like, everyone now uses the Internet and it's a core piece of their flow and like, okay, guys, 2002. So the consensus was this is worthless technology and should go away because it created all this financial speculation and bubble that hurt a lot of people in 99. And so, you know, go away. Like, go look at interviews of Bill Gates and the Today show and, like, you know, and then the same company then dismissed smartphones. And so I think fundamentally, it is really hard to predict the future. There's a very, very few people that can, like, they saw smartphones and the idea of what that would unlock and create new kind of opportunities. And so, like, I just go back to this idea.
00:45:30.964 - 00:46:21.054, Speaker A: Like, there's really smart people in this space and, like, you should never kind of bet against human creativity and innovation and, like, certainly not in an open source context. Like, this is, like, I think also something that is, should be more and more appreciated. Like, all of this is happening in an open source. Most of it is happening in an open source environment. And that fundamentally expedites how we innovate by trial and error and people building on the work of others. And that's here to stay. And it needs to happen without going too much into technicals, but it is also uniquely enabled by crypto because the problem with open source in web two is that it's really hard to agree on contributions and sustain, like, the sustainability of a contribution.
00:46:21.054 - 00:46:51.634, Speaker A: It's like, look at Wikipedia, it's open source. There's all these mods that correct information. Wikipedia is interesting analogy because it's gone from being outlawed. Your professors wouldn't allow it. It was like you had to use Microsoft, like Encarta or Encyclopedia Britannica, which is really expensive and was updated once a year. And now Wikipedia is like de facto like the source of truth, if you will. Why? Because it's in the open and people can contest certain pieces of information.
00:46:51.634 - 00:47:09.968, Speaker A: It's being updated very frequently and Carta doesn't exist anymore. No one's ever buying Britannica, Encyclopedia Britannica anymore. Well, I loved, my parents, never want to buy it to me, so it was pretty expensive. But anyways, so this is why I bought the Wikipedia NFT, if you remember, and then contributed to Pleaserdo.
00:47:10.066 - 00:47:13.692, Speaker B: What did, what do you think? What did we pay for that doesn't. Pleaser on that.
00:47:13.828 - 00:47:15.996, Speaker A: Yeah, pleaser on it. Like we bought it for a million bucks.
00:47:16.100 - 00:47:16.380, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:16.412 - 00:47:21.148, Speaker A: So, um, so anyways, I think, by.
00:47:21.156 - 00:47:30.804, Speaker B: The way, Wikipedia, Mike and I both, whenever Wikipedia has um, the, like at the top, like con. Contribute, contribute, always contribute.
00:47:30.844 - 00:47:41.312, Speaker A: Yeah, well you do, but that's not very, that, that's a great point because I wanted to bring that up. Very few people do that. Like they're constantly asking people for donations. It's a very unsustainable, I use video like daily.
00:47:41.368 - 00:47:46.644, Speaker B: I think there's always a disconnect with certain holes.
00:47:46.944 - 00:48:53.030, Speaker A: There's always a fundamental disconnect with really powerful technology because sometimes it provides so much value but doesn't monetize enough. And that is, I think the problem with a lot of open source stuff like Wikipedia, crypto on the other hand, says, no, wait a minute, we have a token and that token is gonna represent a lot of the contributions. Now not everyone's a contributor to Ethereum, but if you think about the people that earn Ethereum, miners and these people that are providing security, we're stakers, I'd say, that provide security to the network that then allows that to be the fundamental premise by which people want to build on top of ethereum, then you don't have that problem of constantly asking for donations. It's that the token itself represents this balance in the market that says if it's valuable and you're contributing that you are earning ETH or you're paying for ETH. If you want to consume these open resources available to anyone, they come at a cost. And from an economic perspective, that's like fundamentally a really powerful concept because then you really can build on the open source systems that we talked about in a prior episode. As well of this fallacy of what is it? The common goods are problematic.
00:48:53.030 - 00:49:52.074, Speaker A: And I think a token really solves that from a coordination standpoint. At the end of the day, all of this is a coordination problem where people sometimes get a lot of value, but you can't coordinate and you can't agree upon how much you should pay for that. Water, a park, you name it, right? And so you have taxation systems. These networks have taxation systems, whether it's you're consuming gas or paying an ETH. And so anyways, it really creates a very sustainable, I think, more harmonious, like, system where contributors are being rewarded and it sets you up for a long term viability where you can have these systems actually thrive without, like, an enforcement, a central government, like saying, yo, you gotta pay taxes. So anyways, like, yeah, I think it's, these are the times just to kind of round out this out, because there's other stuff we need to cover. But these are the moments where you really reflect on, why am I actually here? Yeah, why did this actually matter? And I think, like, if you've been around, I gotta say, if you've been around for the last year, you're like an OG.
00:49:52.074 - 00:50:16.574, Speaker A: OG. Pick whatever NFT badge we're gonna have to mint for all the people that have been through, because it's what's happened in the last year, I think, has been probably, like, compressed, like, equally as important as what happened in the last, like, ten years in crypto history. I don't want to diminish what has happened before, but certainly it's felt like, you know, it's been a lot.
00:50:16.694 - 00:50:20.014, Speaker B: Yeah. Should we move on?
00:50:20.394 - 00:50:23.334, Speaker A: Yeah, let's move on. Like, starting to get tired.
00:50:25.354 - 00:50:25.802, Speaker B: And this.
00:50:25.818 - 00:50:27.934, Speaker A: Has been a monologue. I apologize, folks.
00:50:28.754 - 00:51:02.930, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break from empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're gonna love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're on to app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app trains, we're on to liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:51:02.930 - 00:51:20.428, Speaker B: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just built the platform. I can search for an l one. I can search for a protocol, built the platform of Blockhost research.com. I searched the terminal. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform.
00:51:20.428 - 00:51:47.458, Speaker B: It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. And you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their Twitter handles today, links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to platform. If you are ready to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup.
00:51:47.458 - 00:52:14.158, Speaker B: Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code Empire. Ten got you back. Check out the links in the description to find out more. Now let's get back to the show. All right, can you see this? All right. As of Thursday, 01:00 p.m., Eastern, we are looking at a.
00:52:14.158 - 00:52:41.724, Speaker B: So the airdrop just went live today. We're looking at a $13.76 billion fully diluted valuation. Total airdrop current value is sitting at 1.75 billion. The latest price update coming from, I think probably from different Dexs is a buck 38. How many holders do we have? We have 182,000 people have claimed the airdrop.
00:52:41.724 - 00:53:00.460, Speaker B: Who's holding this stuff? Arbitrum holders. The DAO is the biggest. Okay, so it's all the daos. Binance. It looks like these are just where the token is being held. 474 million claimed tokens. 40% of the tokens have claimed riding.
00:53:00.460 - 00:53:05.016, Speaker B: Um, interesting. Yeah.
00:53:05.040 - 00:53:13.656, Speaker A: This has been in the total amount, like, if eligible wallets, like 600 and, like, close to 700,000.
00:53:13.840 - 00:53:14.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:14.512 - 00:53:15.456, Speaker A: It's a big number.
00:53:15.600 - 00:53:16.324, Speaker B: Yep.
00:53:17.064 - 00:53:23.784, Speaker A: Yeah. No, it's mean I'm biased because I'm an early investor.
00:53:23.944 - 00:53:43.468, Speaker B: Yeah. Hmm. Any takes on what, what this does or, like thoughts on air? Like, I. Let's not talk. Let's not talk about the price, but any thoughts on this airdrop actually feels different than other airdrops. I would. I would put this and the blur airdrop in a different bucket of airdrops.
00:53:43.468 - 00:54:24.362, Speaker B: And what I mean by that is I think that the. Well, only time will tell, but I think that the users that started using blur and started using really GMX, kind of like farming for the arbitrum airdrop, I think those users will actually stick around. Unlike all path airdrops where you kind of farm. You get the token, you dump the token, you move on to another product. I actually think that the products are starting to get good enough in crypto, where these airdrops are maybe a viable marketing strategy again. I mean, they are. Yeah, no, they are, but, like, it used to be, you get the users, but you don't retain any of the users.
00:54:24.362 - 00:54:30.054, Speaker B: I think that GMX people started using GMX and they're like, holy shit, this is actually a great platform. I'm going to stick around.
00:54:30.874 - 00:54:52.844, Speaker A: I mean, that's what you're banking on. And the fact that, like, if you look at the arbitrum ecosystem, like, there's some, I would characterize the first version of airdrops as like, okay, we'll give you some free stuff. There's not much to do here, but come and claim it now. Like, there's a lot going on in the arbitrum ecosystem, and there's a lot of apps like GMX and others that people use and discover, and they stick around.
00:54:52.884 - 00:54:53.276, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:53.380 - 00:55:40.952, Speaker A: It's not all users importantly, like, just having, I mean, I'm close with the arbitrum team. I know how thoughtful they were in trying to parse through and target these wallets, make them unique. So there was, like, I think, like, they identified more than, like, 280,000. Like, same person, like wallets. Multiple wallets correspond to the same person. And so, yeah, like, they were close with Nansen, and I think they were just very methodical. And if you look at the way that they rolled out their testnet way back when, they were very thoughtful and not rushing it, and where other projects tend to rush, like, arbitrage has just been focusing first on, let's actually build security and have a stable network.
00:55:40.952 - 00:56:08.516, Speaker A: And, like, I appreciate the network's pretty congested now, or down, like, okay. Like, but still, they've been, they've been just thoughtful around it, and, you know, it's good to see that. Right. It certainly hasn't feel rushed. But, you know, there is a time, I think the time has come for a number of reasons, that people should go listen to the arbitrum episode that dropped last week, the reason for this token and to, like, bring out, you know, create this sort of council and centralize the sequence. There's a number of reasons why. Right.
00:56:08.516 - 00:56:16.038, Speaker A: And so it just, there's a natural time and a place to have a token. Airdrops are big part of that kind of distribution strategy.
00:56:16.166 - 00:56:24.950, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, if you look at active addresses by chain, arbitrum and optimism were basically mirroring each other. And now it's. I mean, arbitrum is just ten x.
00:56:24.982 - 00:56:51.722, Speaker A: What was impressive was that arbitrum had a comparable level of activity without a token. And I think that fundamentally speaks to the value proposition of that network and the activity that's going on there and the services and apps that are available there now. You could argue like, okay, there was a time where people intimated, okay, there's gonna be a token at some point, but I think a lot of it was organic. Not all of it was just like very opportunistic people. Time will tell, of course. And we'll have to look at the retention of that airdrop.
00:56:51.858 - 00:57:00.626, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about. Someone's gotta correct me, someone's got to dm me after this. I don't know if it's Euler.
00:57:00.730 - 00:57:02.466, Speaker A: This would be a nasty post on YouTube.
00:57:02.490 - 00:57:13.544, Speaker B: But yeah, no, I think it's like, I think it's like a meme of people mispronouncing this. I'm going to call it Euler, and someone can tell me why I'm wrong. But have you been following this hack? Yeah.
00:57:13.584 - 00:57:14.204, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:15.104 - 00:57:47.268, Speaker B: So I'm going to try to give an overview on this Euler hack and then everyone can correct me and tell me why. I just don't have a big enough brain to understand this, but. Okay, so Euler got hacked on Tuesday. The developments around the Euler finance exploit took this kind of unexpected twist. I think you could call it after the ronin exploiter. People remember there's this big Ronin hack. The ronin exploiter sent two ETH to the Euler hacker with an on chain note that you could read on Etherscan to decrypt an encrypted message.
00:57:47.268 - 00:58:21.564, Speaker B: And if you looked at the GitHub repository linked in the message, it contained a security vulnerability which suggests that the Ronin hacker was attempting to then phish the Euler hacker. Because if the Euler exploiter signed the message with the package, their private key could have been encrypted. The Euler team responded to the Euler hacker with a message advising them to be very careful using the encryption tool. Now you've got the Euler team. Euler team gets hacked by the Euler hacker. But the Euler team's advising the hacker like, hey, don't open that. It looks suspicious.
00:58:21.564 - 00:58:59.334, Speaker B: The hacker has been. And the reason that they suggested they do that is because the hackers got all their money. And the hacker had previously been in talks with Euler through these on chain messages discussing the return of. I think it was like 90% of the funds, which is like roughly $190 million worth of crypto. So the TLDR is Euler hacker gets like $200 million from oiler, from Euler finance. Then the Ronin Hacker messages the Euler hacker trying to phish them, trying to get them to basically send them the hacked money. The Euler team sees that and they're like, hey, hacker, be careful out there because we need to get that money back.
00:58:59.334 - 00:59:30.720, Speaker B: So it's kind of unclear whether these messages between the two hackers were part of an actual attempt to steal funds or if it was kind of just like two parties putting on a show. And then last week, the Euler hacker sent 100 ETH to the Ronin hackers wallet, which created confusion over potential links between them. And then the wildest thing is, people have been speculating that the Ronin hacker is allegedly Lazarus group. Which at this point, I think we've got enough for a movie.
00:59:30.872 - 00:59:55.224, Speaker A: But this, the Ronin Hacker, I think that's been the Lazarus stuff was pretty well known. I think what's crazy was everything seemed to be okay until, for no good reason, apparently, the Euler hacker or Euler hackers and 100 ETH to the Ronin hacker wallet. So it's like, okay, wait a minute. That doesn't make any sense in this plot.
00:59:55.644 - 01:00:07.004, Speaker B: So, so, like, so Euler or Euler hacker hacked you? Euler for the. Hacker hacked oiler for 200 million. Hacker then sent a hundred ethel to ladder us.
01:00:07.044 - 01:00:26.800, Speaker A: Basically oiler the same guy. Like, it's like, uh. It's like, it's crazy that there's no reason why they would send 100 e to someone that, like, try to, like, have them download a secure, like, a package that would have compromised and had they signed something with it, that would have drained their wallet. Like, it's like, uh. That doesn't make any sense.
01:00:26.912 - 01:00:29.536, Speaker B: No. So, anyways.
01:00:29.680 - 01:00:31.840, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Pretty crazy.
01:00:31.912 - 01:00:33.744, Speaker B: It's enough for a screenplay. Um.
01:00:33.784 - 01:00:34.684, Speaker A: Oh, definitely.
01:00:35.304 - 01:00:42.362, Speaker B: You've been following the defi llama drama. I just want to say that because it rolls off the tongue. Well, defi llama drama, you know.
01:00:42.418 - 01:00:45.538, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good one. I have been following it.
01:00:45.666 - 01:00:47.554, Speaker B: Are you close with that, too?
01:00:47.674 - 01:00:52.454, Speaker A: No, I just know a few people there, but I haven't talked to them while all this has been going on.
01:00:54.234 - 01:01:33.678, Speaker B: Basically, you have, like. So Charlie basically created Defi llama and funded it and stuff like that. And, and then Xerox Ngmi came onto the scene, joins the team or co founded it or whatever. Has less equity than Charlie, funded it. Less than Charlie is what Im hearing from folks, but hes kind of much more public facing. And I mean, when you think of Defi long, when you think of Xerox Ngmi having built most of it, even though maybe he didnt do as much in the early days, and now hes done a lot more. And so Charlie was like, all right, guys, we got to monetize this thing.
01:01:33.678 - 01:02:01.068, Speaker B: Let's do a token. And Xerox Ngmi was like, we're not doing a token. And now you had these two factions of the company. It'd be like if Mike was like, we're launching a blockworks token. And he posted that publicly on Twitter. And then I posted, no, we're not launching a blockworks token. And then if you're an employee, you have to be like, am I on Mike's side or am I on Jason's side? And some of the people, like, the person who ran the Twitter account was like, yeah, token side.
01:02:01.068 - 01:02:35.654, Speaker B: And then the person who ran the telegram account was like, no, token side. And there's a bunch of drama. But now it seems like it's been resolved, saying that the fork had been. So what they did is they forked NgMi forked the code, created a new thing called Lamify. But it looks like that fork's been canceled and the website is going to continue to work on a single domain. But I think it's just a reminder of the lack of clarity in terms of who owns what in crypto. And the idea of shared ownership of a project doesn't always elegantly map onto real world ownership of things.
01:02:35.814 - 01:02:50.070, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I mean, it goes back to the prior point that I was making around why token fundamentally serves as a coordination mechanism. Now, there could always be disagreements of, like, in this case, the equity would have to map out certain tokens, right?
01:02:50.102 - 01:02:50.502, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:50.598 - 01:03:18.048, Speaker A: Because then the team would take a certain percentage of the, usually how this works is the team would take some percentage of the total tokens, and then that would be distributed to all the contributors, that is, employees of this company, which is fundamentally the core disagreement here between zero X NGMI and Charlie. So they should just go and have a coffee, talk about ownership, and then, for the good sake of the space, continue to provide a good service that DeFi Loma does.
01:03:18.096 - 01:03:23.744, Speaker B: So, Lamka, a couple beers or maybe just skip straight to the vodka and.
01:03:24.044 - 01:03:31.388, Speaker A: Well, it's always, it's always a point of contention. Like, this is not a crypto problem, this is just a startup problem.
01:03:31.516 - 01:03:39.972, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I got. That's all that. Oh, oh, sushi. Obviously well, we touch on sushi too much because we just did that whole.
01:03:39.988 - 01:04:27.564, Speaker A: Okay, that I want to make. Is they, similar to my understanding, Uniswap's also gone. This kind of subpoena, and a lot of other DeFi projects have. In this case, it was, I think the entity that was set up in the US just wants the MasterChef now, which is based in the US. They created a company, and so they got subpoenaed, and they try to set up a legal defense fund in the order of 3 million with a contingency of another million to basically kind of go through this process. And so interesting kind of governance discussions around that. Some projects did reach out to me and say, hey, what does it actually mean for, if you have liquidity in sushi, if you're using sushi, what could happen? And I said, well, my understanding is, one, it's a subpoena, so it's a request for information.
01:04:27.564 - 01:04:53.592, Speaker A: And it's to the core contributors, not like the smart contracts are deployed. Like, you know, like, look at tornado. Like, smart contract deploys smart contract. Now, if it's immutable or not, that's important. Things that probably we should understand is what can, like, the upgradability of these contracts severe, providing liquidity. Can they freeze that liquidity? Can they stop that liquidity like USCC can?
01:04:53.648 - 01:04:54.272, Speaker B: Right.
01:04:54.448 - 01:05:25.492, Speaker A: And so I encourage these teams, say, hey, have your engineers actually look at the code. Once you're an LP, or you're, especially if you're an LP in some of these pools, then does the team have any ability to upgrade a contract to freeze those funds, or can they not? And I think that's a more important question. Right? Yeah. And it goes for Uniswap as well. Now, I'm not a developer. I can breed contracts, but not to this level of, like, sophistication. But it would be good to know, you know.
01:05:25.508 - 01:05:26.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:26.244 - 01:05:29.504, Speaker A: Not just for sushi, but for Uniswap and other protocols. Right.
01:05:30.764 - 01:05:33.104, Speaker B: So my understanding is that.
01:05:35.404 - 01:05:35.940, Speaker A: I'm trying.
01:05:35.972 - 01:06:18.904, Speaker B: To figure sushi is not the only one who has got this and that there are going to be many more of these in the coming, maybe even weeks, but definitely months. There are a couple, like, when you get one of these, I don't know if this is the case in Sushi, but I know another team that will probably make it public soon that they're being asked to hand over all of their, like, every telegram message the founders ever sent, every email the founders ever sent, every slack message anyone at the company has ever sent, and it's a. Yeah, it's. Yeah. Just probed around there with the SEC. But I think here, Voorhees. I think Voorhees had a really good take on this, which is because shapeshift basically decentralized the company.
01:06:18.904 - 01:06:49.778, Speaker B: Not basically shapeshift, decentralized had a centralized company. Decentralized. The company lost 99% of their users because of it. But in order to keep operating in a way that Eric felt was along the ethos of how they wanted to operate, he did it, and his tweet nailed it. He said, sushi created a legal entity in order to reduce liability, but then that entity and that individual Jared associated with it got subpoenaed. He said, PSA, public service announcement. If there is an entity, it is not a dao.
01:06:49.778 - 01:06:59.342, Speaker B: Don't let lawyers talk to incorporation unless you want to be in it, unless you want to be a corporation. And I think we're going to see a couple more of these coming soon. Yeah.
01:06:59.358 - 01:07:01.954, Speaker A: I mean, there's a lot also going out after Terra.
01:07:02.334 - 01:07:05.366, Speaker B: Right. Oh, do you see Doe? Doe just got arrested.
01:07:05.510 - 01:07:09.806, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess that's a good way to end this. Like. Yeah, apparently doe got arrested in Montenegro.
01:07:09.950 - 01:07:10.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:11.174 - 01:07:23.250, Speaker A: Haven't been. Like, I've seen some reports, but it hasn't hit mainstream media or the police hasn't come out. Interpol saying, confirmed yet. And this is Thursday, so.
01:07:23.442 - 01:07:25.298, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, also, there were rumors that he.
01:07:25.306 - 01:07:29.266, Speaker A: Was there, like, he was in Serbia and I guess close to Serbia, and so.
01:07:29.450 - 01:07:42.090, Speaker B: Yeah. The SEC also sued Justin sun for the unregistered offering and token trading, manipulative trading, unlawful touting of crypto asset securities and some celebrities.
01:07:42.242 - 01:07:47.762, Speaker A: Settled already. This is, like, Akon and Lindsay Lohan and a few others. That out.
01:07:47.938 - 01:07:50.522, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, I think Jake Paul.
01:07:50.698 - 01:07:51.962, Speaker A: Yeah, Jake Paul, too.
01:07:52.098 - 01:07:52.610, Speaker B: A lot.
01:07:52.682 - 01:07:56.394, Speaker A: They've settled because they were being compensated and didn't disclose it, so.
01:07:56.474 - 01:08:11.634, Speaker B: Yeah. So what's the lawsuit for? Justin said, the lawsuit alleges that sun sold billions of TRON and BTT as securities and failed to register with the SEC, and he's accused of fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRon through extensive wash trade.
01:08:11.674 - 01:08:13.454, Speaker A: Wash trading through employees and whatnot.
01:08:13.554 - 01:08:14.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:15.054 - 01:08:18.806, Speaker A: Did he also lose his diplomatic status with one of these caribbean islands?
01:08:18.990 - 01:08:21.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
01:08:22.614 - 01:08:23.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
01:08:24.054 - 01:08:26.234, Speaker B: Cool, man. Feels like a good place to end.
01:08:26.734 - 01:08:40.478, Speaker A: I think so. I think we covered in most of it. Like, we. We didn't talk on macro, but, you know, we did talk about the regional banks and how that implicates implications. Crypto, Coinbase, sushi, arbitram yeah. Things should be great, man. Any.
01:08:40.478 - 01:08:47.474, Speaker A: Any parting thoughts or good boats or movies? Exciting episodes coming up.
01:08:48.254 - 01:09:00.194, Speaker B: Yeah, we do have exciting episodes coming up. I'll plug that. We have Kane. We have Kane from Synthetix coming on Monday. Pumped to talk about that. The resurgence of synthetics is fun.
01:09:01.334 - 01:09:07.034, Speaker A: Yeah, that's gonna be really cool, because Kane has so much, and, I mean, he's an old timer. He's seen a lot.
01:09:07.462 - 01:09:27.490, Speaker B: Yeah. Of. We have a big conversation with Amy and Andrew, the head, the two crypto leads at Morgan Stanley. Both two of my favorite people in the space, and they're very crypto native, and they're both inside of Morgan Stanley, so that'll be a fun conversation. Yeah. Good stuff going up.
01:09:27.642 - 01:09:28.786, Speaker A: Great stuff coming up.
01:09:28.890 - 01:09:29.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:30.554 - 01:09:40.002, Speaker A: All right. This place feels a good place to end. Thanks, everyone, for listening. Appreciate you bearing through all my rants, and it's great to be back. So we'll be back here next week.
01:09:40.098 - 01:09:41.394, Speaker B: See you on Monday. All right.
