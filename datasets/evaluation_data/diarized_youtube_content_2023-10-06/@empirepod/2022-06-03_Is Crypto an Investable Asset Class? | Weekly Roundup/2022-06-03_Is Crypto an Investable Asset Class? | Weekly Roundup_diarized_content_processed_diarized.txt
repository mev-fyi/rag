00:00:00.320 - 00:00:18.350, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire, today's Weekly roundup. We are joined by Mister Byron. Byron. I still. You've been here at blockwork since September.
00:00:18.350 - 00:00:28.026, Speaker A: I call you Mister Byron. I don't actually know how to pronounce your last name. Gilliam. Gilliam. He is the Matt Levine of Crypto. He is the idol of your inbox. He is a crypto connoisseur.
00:00:28.026 - 00:00:29.894, Speaker A: Mister Byron, welcome to the show.
00:00:30.194 - 00:00:30.930, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:00:31.082 - 00:00:34.458, Speaker A: Do you wanna tell us how to pronounce the last name? Is it Gilliam?
00:00:34.626 - 00:00:41.274, Speaker B: The family calls it goes by Gilliam, but I generally say Gilliam to anyone who might have to spell it. So either way works.
00:00:41.354 - 00:00:44.706, Speaker A: Gill, isn't there an I at the end of it, though? Gilliam.
00:00:44.810 - 00:00:46.890, Speaker B: There's an I. There's two eyes in it.
00:00:47.002 - 00:00:48.346, Speaker A: Silent eye, though, huh?
00:00:48.450 - 00:00:52.574, Speaker B: There's a silent eye. I think it's a scottish pronunciation.
00:00:52.714 - 00:01:10.878, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, however, your family pronounces your last name, I think is the real pronunciation. I don't think it should be anyone. I don't think anyone else dictates how you pronounce your last name, Byron. All right, so there's a lot to talk about today. I want to cover Opensea, just the DOJ, DOJ charges against Nate. I want to talk about the optimism.
00:01:10.878 - 00:01:31.810, Speaker A: Airdrop. Curious to get your take on just vc private market arb that's happening right now. Arthur Hayes wrote an interesting piece. I'm curious to get your take on. I don't know if you read that yet. Maybe get some last final thoughts on terra Luna. But before we do that, you joined blockworks September 1, September 5 7th.
00:01:31.810 - 00:01:57.566, Speaker A: Somewhere early September. The market was riding high. We had, like, two or three more months of the bull run. Everything was working. And I just remember when you joined, you really threw yourself into crypto, and now it's like, nine months later, and things haven't been going so well for the last six months. And maybe some of these things in defi that you were super excited about, maybe you're just seeing that. Like, maybe you're a little less optimistic about them.
00:01:57.566 - 00:02:08.118, Speaker A: So I would love to get your thoughts on how the last three or four or five months have been for you just in your journey into crypto.
00:02:08.286 - 00:02:44.252, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, first off, I want to apologize to everybody for causing the top. You know, if I thought leaving crypto would reverse it, I would do it. I would take the charge for everybody, but I don't think it works that way. So I'm not going to. But yeah, it's been interesting. I think that probably your long term view is in many ways conditioned by your first six months in the industry. And I'm a major victim of recency bias and things like that.
00:02:44.252 - 00:03:05.868, Speaker B: So I am going a little bit bearish, but that's probably excellent news because I, you know, historically, I'm always bearish at the bottom. It's not going to be a bottom unless I'm bearish. So I think it's, I think that's good news for everybody. Nice. But yeah, it's been, it's, it's been really interesting. I'm not even sure where to start. Like, I came into it looking for lottery tickets.
00:03:05.868 - 00:03:41.564, Speaker B: Like I was going to find the next Solana and I was going to put $1,000 into it and it was going to go up 8000 times and I was going to be rich. I've given up doing that. I don't think that there are a lot of lottery tickets around. I thought that I was going to stumble on all kinds of amazing, undiscovered investments that were going to be the next Nike or Microsoft or something, but I've kind of stopped doing that. Also, I don't think that's what crypto is about. I entered it kind of thinking that cryptos were basically tech stocks. They're software.
00:03:41.564 - 00:04:25.564, Speaker B: So I kind of thought cryptocurrencies were going to be higher beta tech stocks. But I don't think think that that's what they are anymore. I think my major takeaway at the moment is that I'm not totally convinced that crypto is an investable asset class. It's definitely a tradable asset class, but I'm increasingly looking at it more like commodities and not equities. Commodities. Equities have a natural upward bias because, you know, companies get more productive over time. They generate cash flow, they buy back stock, they pay dividends, they benefit from inflation.
00:04:25.564 - 00:05:07.374, Speaker B: So even if they're not going up in real terms, they're probably going up in nominal terms. But that is not the case with cryptos. Right? Like, cryptos are certainly at the moment, they're, you know, as a whole, they're not generating, they're not generating cash flow. They're, you know, they're consuming cash flow. I'm not sure that they get more productive over time. All those biases that bail you out in equities, I'm not sure that they exist in crypto, so I'm more looking at them now like copper or something like that, or the swiss franc or something. I'm looking at them more like commodities or currencies than equities.
00:05:08.394 - 00:05:44.002, Speaker A: That's really interesting. I think there would be, maybe I would have two pushbacks on that. One is the overused analogy of looking at the early.com days is none of those were investable companies, except for maybe the five or ten that were the Amazons and googles that came out of that era. And then several years later, obviously Facebook and Snapchat and Instagram and things like that. So one question I would have for you, and the second pushback might be that there are revenue producing protocols and projects, specifically in Defi, something like an Aave or a maker. Like they do spit off cash flows.
00:05:44.002 - 00:06:09.374, Speaker A: The cash flows obviously look a little different because they're, well, we can get to that in a second. But when you think about whether or not does this change basically, like, are we just too early in crypto and it just looks something like investing in the Internet in 1990, 819, 99, 2000? Or does this feel like a byproduct of just how these projects and how the industry is set up?
00:06:09.834 - 00:06:48.062, Speaker B: Yeah, at the moment I think it's the latter, but I reserve the right to change my opinion before this podcast is over even. But I guess I have two structural concerns. One is that the mega winners in equities are a function of two basic things. I think. One is that they create a moat around a business and then they can just extract profits from inside their castle forever. Right. And two is that they have, they almost always have some singular leader in the beginning, a founder or whomever who is taking giant risks, and then the giant.
00:06:48.062 - 00:07:16.234, Speaker B: For some of them, the giant risks pay off, like Bezos or Phil Knight or whatever. And neither of those things are true in crypto. Crypto is open source, right. So I think it's very difficult to build a moat. Like, I think uniswap has a little bit of a moat. Cause everyone just goes there, even though they could go to one inch or whatever. But the moats are going to be shallow in crypto, I think, which is going to make it very difficult to extract rents, which is great.
00:07:16.234 - 00:08:09.592, Speaker B: That is a massive feature and not a flaw of crypto, but it's great for users and not necessarily investors. Then. The other thing is that if cryptos are really going to be daos, then they are not going to have that singular founder leader making giant risky decisions all the time, right? Like you are just not, you know, if you have to take a vote of the entire Dow for every major or minor decision, you are just not going to take the risks that Jeff Bezos took or Phil Knight took or whomever. So for those two reasons, I'm a little bit skeptical that crypto is going to produce those giant winners for investors. I still think that amazing things are going to be built. I just don't think that you are going to get the returns out of them like you would do in equities.
00:08:09.768 - 00:08:27.960, Speaker A: Tell me more about that founder one. Someone like Hayden at Uniswap or Stani at Aave. Why are they not going to take the risks? But someone like Bezos or Phil Knight would take the risks because they've already made a bunch of money because their equity is liquid earlier on. Is that the thesis?
00:08:27.992 - 00:09:09.586, Speaker B: No, I guess I'm thinking more of kind of an idealized Dow where the decision making is genuinely decentralized. So yes, early on, certainly when before a token is listed and when it's just vc investments or whatever, in those situations, people can still take the big risks. I don't know enough about the decision making at Aave or something like that, but if we don't want cryptos to be securities, then they're going to have to be decentralized. And if they are decentralized, they are not going to be risk taking. I don't think so.
00:09:09.610 - 00:09:43.226, Speaker A: There are moats in crypto. They're just not the traditional moats that you see. I think one of the strongest moats in, I think there's two different kinds of moats. One moat in tradfi is just the shittiness of the product, makes it very tough to switch over. So leaving my bank of America or Wells Fargo account, it's just like, I just know the headache that comes with it is going to be a total pain in the ass. So that's almost like their moat. Like bank of America checking versus ally, bank checking versus Wells Fargo versus JPMorgan versus Goldman checking.
00:09:43.226 - 00:10:15.864, Speaker A: And they're all the same. It's the same product, right? So you could probably argue that like the brand is actually the moat there because it's the exact same product. So the brand is the moat. That, or the brand probably gets you in and like it's marketing and then like the shittiness of the product is almost the moat. And maybe in web, too, the moat is just that you build, and at least in social media, the moat is that you actually build this massive audience that you don't own. So, like, I have built a big audience on Twitter, but not on Instagram. And so I'm not going to port over, like, there's no way to port over my Twitter.
00:10:15.864 - 00:10:21.604, Speaker A: So you don't think that those moats. Do you think any sort of motes exist in crypto? That's just like, there's less of a moat?
00:10:22.224 - 00:10:46.956, Speaker B: I'm not sure. I just thought, I've only been in here since September, so I'm just very much trying to, trying to figure things out. You know, as you know, the newsletter I write is basically just me figuring things out from a tradfi perspective. So I'm pretty confident that the moats are lower in crypto than in tradfi. And that is good. That's definitely a feature and not a thing.
00:10:46.980 - 00:10:49.020, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good for the user, maybe bad for the company.
00:10:49.172 - 00:11:27.368, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think there are some motes, like I said, with Uniswap and OpenSea seems to have a moat for some reason. They've seen off looks rare pretty well so far. But if it's open source software that can be copied and forked and vampired, I don't think you were ever going to be able to take 80% margins. Like, you're a SaaS company. Crypto is not ever going to let you take 80% margins, I don't think. Which is great if you're a user, but it's not great if you're an investor.
00:11:27.446 - 00:12:05.174, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to touch on one thing that you said before getting into any of, like, this week's news, which is you are. You're not looking for the these, like, 100 x outlier winners. Like, you're not trying to find the Solanas anymore. What's the second order thing of that? You're not finding these so that you are. Instead you are placing your money with what, the blue, the quote unquote blue chips. Like, instead of trying to throw 20 little small bets on, like, the next hundred xers, you're just kind of putting your money into, like, uniswap aave these kind of like, blue chip defi projects you're putting it into back into the l one s where.
00:12:05.174 - 00:12:09.634, Speaker A: What does that mean that you're not actually putting your money into these, like, next hundred x ers?
00:12:09.974 - 00:12:54.974, Speaker B: That's a good question. Yeah, I don't. I mean, at the moment, I don't have anything that I'm, like, high conviction on, so I can't really say where I'm putting my money. Ma'am, first of all, I've lost most of my crypto money, so there's not a lot of it to put anywhere. But I think one thing that I generally, I'm looking for more tactical things. What's going to do well over the next two or three months, instead of lottery tickets, where it's all or nothing, hold it for five years and either you're rich or you're a zero. But the problem with that, I haven't done much of that tactical stuff now because it's really time consuming, consuming.
00:12:54.974 - 00:13:29.764, Speaker B: You have to be. I don't know how people have time for it, really. Like, I think there's loads of interesting things happening and happening in the curve wars and stuff like that. And I think that if you spent the time truly understanding the tokenomics, then you can have an opinion on FXS right now or vote blocked curve or whatever. But that's like, it was a massive time commitment. And so at the moment, I haven't really been trading very much.
00:13:29.884 - 00:14:52.990, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like one of the best arbitrages in crypto over the last two years has been betting on early stage companies because there was a massive amount of exit liquidity from retail. So a lot of the early stage venture space just got so overheated and so insane because it was honestly really hard to lose money if you're doing any sort of angel investing or early stage investing in companies that eventually converted equity into a token and had a saft. As soon as that staff went, as soon as the equity got converted to a token, the token went live on some exchanges, you basically exited to a bunch of retail who would buy up your token. It feels like that arbitrage is going away and it feels like actually there's. Things have flipped. A because there's not that retail demand to soak up that exit liquidity, but B it just feels like the private markets have got so overheated, like layer zero, raising at a $3 billion valuation when there are some pretty solid other bridging companies that are public and have tokens that are so, so, so undervalued, at least relative to the 3 billion. So do you think that things are flipping and do you think that the public, whereas the last two years, everything was so focused on the private markets, are we going to a world where maybe a lot of the opportunities exist now in the public markets?
00:14:53.182 - 00:15:37.096, Speaker B: That would be great. If that's the case, I would say that the first thing that has to happen is that the private market valuations have to come lower. I'm not sure that those are too high. I'm not sure that that means that the public valuations are too low. So far, have not found anything where I think, like, wow, that is really cheap. And that's probably because I'm coming from a tradfi perspective and I'm trying to figure it out on traditional metrics like earnings and earnings multiples and things, which is kind of confusing to me because it seems like on the one hand, crypto has a very limited pool of buyers, right. There are not that many people who are in crypto.
00:15:37.096 - 00:16:22.736, Speaker B: And it seems like the same money gets recycled around from one thing to the other. But on the other hand, the valuations of listed tokens, to the degree that valuation makes sense in crypto, seems really high to me. I think maker on token terminal, maker trades on 15 times earnings, which is the same as 15 times sales in crypto, which is like. I mean, that doesn't seem like it's screamingly cheap, right? So I don't. I think it's good that if private valuations come lower, but I don't think that means that public valuations are a super bargain at the moment. At least not that I found. I would love to find some that are.
00:16:22.880 - 00:16:30.164, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's go to some of the news from the week. So we're gonna start. You wanna start optimism or Opensea?
00:16:30.464 - 00:16:42.114, Speaker B: I don't know. Opensea, I think is ridiculous. I think I read that the person whose name I've forgotten, did he get sentenced?
00:16:42.534 - 00:17:34.834, Speaker A: I'll give you a little overview. Basically, a couple months ago, this guy, Nate Chastain, who was a product manager at Opensea, was accused in, actually, when you joined Blockworks, I think it was in September of 2021, of secretly buying, I think it's 45 nfts based on confidential information that he knew as a PM that they would soon be featured on OpenSea's homepage. So basically he was a PM. He knew that these nfts would get listed on the homepage of OpenSea, which just like getting listed on Coinbase, pumps the price of something. It's kind of like the NFT version of like a new asset listing on Coinbase, and then he would flip those for an easy profit. Opensea CEO Devin Fincer came out and said, I do think that there was a misframing of it as insider trading with, we don't view nfts as financial assets, so that does not apply. That's a very specific term for a very specific thing.
00:17:34.834 - 00:18:00.982, Speaker A: So that was Devin Finster, the CEO of Opensea's take back in September, this past Wednesday. We're recording this Thursday afternoon. So yesterday, Nate was arrested for wire fraud and money laundering related to insider trading. What are you, what are your take, what's your take on this? Yeah, but I think important to note, this was, I think, the first insider trading case in crypto, or maybe just the first insider trading case in nfts.
00:18:01.158 - 00:19:10.244, Speaker B: Yeah. I think insider trading is a subset of fraud. So I think saying that it's not a financial product is not going to get you out of it. Like, you know, I think it's just considered fraud. Like the buyer has defrauded the seller of their rightful profits, which I think is ridiculous, you know, like, who is the victim here, really? Like, the person who wanted to sell their on chain receipt for a JPEG. They have been defrauded because they didn't get to sell it after it was listed on Opensea. Like, that seems like a very tenuous thing, you know, and if you're talking about equities, if somebody is somebody's insider trading a stock, then you can make the case that they are making markets less efficient and markets have a purpose, which is to allocate capital to the economy, and therefore, in some way the economy has gotten slightly less productive.
00:19:10.244 - 00:19:54.834, Speaker B: If you're talking about flipping nfts, I don't know. I don't know what the disbenefit of that is. I also think that surely the FBI has better things to do than police NFT trading. I can't believe that they pay any attention to this, which makes me a little bit concerned. Like maybe this is the thin edge of the wedge to crack down on all of crypto, because why do they care? To me, it's more like if they were policing the trading of in game items in a video game or something like that. That, to me is more akin to NFT. That's more what NFT trading is than trading equities.
00:19:54.834 - 00:20:01.414, Speaker B: And I think I also read that the guy was sentenced to a year in prison. Is that correct?
00:20:01.574 - 00:20:07.086, Speaker A: I think it's longer. I think it's much longer. I mean, if it actually goes through, I think it's much longer than that.
00:20:07.110 - 00:20:11.318, Speaker B: I mean, that is unconscionable to me. Like, that just seems totally insane.
00:20:11.406 - 00:20:17.236, Speaker A: Like, how is this, which he is charged, carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
00:20:17.390 - 00:20:19.088, Speaker B: Has he, has he been sentenced?
00:20:19.216 - 00:20:20.444, Speaker A: No, I don't think so.
00:20:21.264 - 00:20:26.764, Speaker B: I mean, that's just. I can't understand that at all. That's just. That's just totally crazy.
00:20:27.584 - 00:20:48.164, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. This is actually. I'm reading the justice dot gov comma. I'm reading the press release from the Department of Justice, the Southern District of New York. Chastain, 31, of New York, New York, is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, each of which. Each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. So up to 40 years in prison.
00:20:48.164 - 00:20:50.044, Speaker A: That's ridiculous.
00:20:52.104 - 00:21:26.472, Speaker B: There's no scenario in which flipping jpegs should get you removed from society is just not that important. And I mean, the guy, the poor guy, the guy is clearly. I mean, he's lost his job. Obviously he's been humiliated. I would say that he's already served his time. I certainly think that Opensea should be policing this because it is reputational damage to them. But I do not see why the FBI needs to get involved, and I certainly don't see why anyone should have to be in prison.
00:21:26.608 - 00:21:40.782, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think there are a couple of thoughts here. One is companies are going to. This is. Sets the precedent for. Companies are going to have to do a much better job of actually policing this internally. So basically, any marketplace business is going to have to do a better job here.
00:21:40.782 - 00:22:08.094, Speaker A: Uh, obviously, Coinbase. The Coinbase pump, right. When an asset gets listed, um, on Coinbase, it's been. I think they've actually taken pretty strong measures to, uh, to fix this over the last several months. But, um, back in like 20 17, 20 18, 20 19, it was pretty standard for like, the price of an asset to really pump before the asset actually got announced that it was getting listed on Coinbase. Uh, and it was. And it was really just Coinbase employees who were pumping it.
00:22:08.794 - 00:22:27.634, Speaker B: My impression from reading things, and this is mostly Twitter, and everything on Twitter is true. So it's definitely correct. My impression is that most of that was a function of people scouring Coinbase's GitHub page and looking at test nets and things like that, which is not insider trading. That's public information.
00:22:27.714 - 00:22:39.230, Speaker A: It's no different than hedge funds buying data that hedge funds buying data that shows, like, how many people were shopping at Walmart last year, like aerial footage.
00:22:39.262 - 00:22:43.662, Speaker B: Except you don't even have except you don't even have to buy it. It's free if you're clever enough to figure it out.
00:22:43.758 - 00:23:27.562, Speaker A: Right? Or you look on Google Maps every three months when they take the screenshot of the Walmart parking lot and you can see if it's full or not. Okay, so first implication, I think exchanges like Coinbase, like OpenSea, are going to have to take much stronger measures to make sure there isn't insider trading on their platform. I think that this is probably also the first domino. Um, I think the regulators are just trying to make an example of Nate here. It's a completely bullshit case in my mind, but this is them just making, um, putting their foot down and saying, like, look, we're coming after, we're coming after crypto. And I think a lot of folks in the industry had always said crypto isn't a security, therefore it can't be regulated. Uh, therefore insider trading can't be regulated.
00:23:27.562 - 00:23:32.710, Speaker A: And this clearly shows that that was one of the biggest misconceptions, I think.
00:23:32.822 - 00:23:36.830, Speaker B: Yeah, that's not correct. It does not, does not have to be a security.
00:23:36.982 - 00:24:04.154, Speaker A: I think that is one of the biggest misconceptions in the industry is that insider trading does not just apply to securities, which is really important for folks to know. Yeah, you got to feel for Nate. Feel bad for the guy. Optimism. Here's what happened with optimism. We talked about optimism a couple of weeks on, weeks ago on the podcast with Santiago. Basically, optimism deployed 5% of their op token contract before they made.
00:24:04.154 - 00:24:26.574, Speaker A: So that optimism was releasing these tokens. They did an airdrop. They had a little hiccup this week, though, which is before they deployed the token contract, before they made the airdrop announcement. Some users noticed this. Before the announcement, they started claiming their tokens. Optimism then tried to scramble to fix this. They launched a claims UI and made an announcement.
00:24:26.574 - 00:25:04.094, Speaker A: This kind of just like the hoopla around this kind of overwhelmed optimism's RPC endpoint. And a lot of users experienced, like, failed claims for the next several hours. What happened here? I'm going to pull this up. Basically, the community, what happened after. So they had about 250,000 eligible wallets, but there's this new proposal by a community member to ban anyone who sold their airdrop tokens from future airdrops. I'm not sure. Did you see this? Did you see this proposal?
00:25:04.214 - 00:25:05.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. I think it's great.
00:25:05.782 - 00:25:07.394, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think?
00:25:07.734 - 00:25:46.794, Speaker B: Well, I mean, coming from Tradfi, the thing that always happens is when there's a hot IPo, every big account puts in for ten times the amount that they actually want. And then whatever they get for their allocation, they just immediately sell it. And everybody knows it happens, but you can't prove it. So every account will say, we love this stock. We want as much of it as we can, so we can keep it forever. And then they sell it on the opening price. So I think it's totally, this speaks well to crypto that you can actually see exactly what's happening.
00:25:46.794 - 00:25:58.692, Speaker B: And you can hard code it. You could hard code rules to prevent it. I don't really think that you should, but I think it's really cool that you can.
00:25:58.828 - 00:26:04.028, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you explain that to us? What does that look like when, let's say, Goldman's taking a company public?
00:26:04.116 - 00:27:02.706, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a hot, you know, if there's a hot ipo, which there hasn't been many lately, so, you know, whatever, you know, Facebook at the time or whatever, you know, a lot of times, everybody knows it's going to be up 2030, 50%. So the biggest accounts will put in for many more times than what they actually want. And they will get an allocation to the IPO, in theory, because they're going to be a good long term shareholder, but in reality they get the allocation because they are good customers of Goldman Sachs or whomever. Goldman Sachs best customers will get the biggest allocations to the Goldman Sachs ipos. Some of them will genuinely want to be long term holders. But on the hot ones, typically they just sell on the first day and it's just free money for them. And this is the same exact thing, except that you can see what everyone's doing and you can't see that in tradfi.
00:27:02.706 - 00:27:17.894, Speaker B: In Tradfi, Goldman issues the ipo to whatever big account, and the big account sells it with Morgan Stanley. So Goldman Sachs has no idea what they've done. But in crypto, you get to see exactly what everybody's done, which is amazing.
00:27:19.124 - 00:27:52.580, Speaker A: Empire is brought to you by Bitmex with the launch of their spot exchange. Bitmex is running an insane promo right now. We wanted to give you the inside scoop. Here's the deal. For the next two months, users who trade $250 worth of crypto on Bitmex's spot exchange will be entered into their million dollar giveaway. Prizes range from thousands of dollars all the way up to $500,000. That's right, trade $250 on Bitmex for a chance to personally win $500,000.
00:27:52.580 - 00:28:15.712, Speaker A: Beyond the million dollar giveaway, new users can also get up to 200. BMex. BMex. That's Bitmex's new token coming soon just by creating an account and going through KYC and trading. So you can actually get BitMex tokens just by creating an account and trading. The more you trade, the higher your chances of winning. What are you waiting for? Go to bitmex.com.
00:28:15.712 - 00:28:33.680, Speaker A: Today. Sign up for an account bit m e x.com dot I thought this was the funniest proposal. I think it was such a silly proposal. I think what happened is their token fell, like, I don't know, the updated price probably fell 50 or 60%. It might be a little more than that. I haven't checked the price in a little while.
00:28:33.680 - 00:29:18.134, Speaker A: Fell like 50 or 60%, which obviously caused some people in the community to say, get all mad and riled up that people are selling their tokens. And what they were discussing is, like, barring anyone who dumped their tokens from future airdrops, which Mike wrote about this, actually, in the Memorial Day newsletter. I don't know if you read that, his piece, but it's like, there's this thought in crypto that you should just be rewarded because you were early. And it's kind of a silly thought, right? It's kind of a silly thought that, like, you didn't really do much work, but because you're early, um, you should get rewarded. And, um, that's just not really how it exists in traditional. In traditional financial markets, and for good reason. Right? Imagine.
00:29:18.134 - 00:29:45.756, Speaker A: I think the example that Mike used is like, imagine if series A investors, when the company was raising a series b, they were like, give me more tokens. Give me, excuse me. Give me more equity. Give me more. A larger allocation here. We're not going to pay you any money, but we deserve more equity because we were early. And it's just this, because we were early, that exists in crypto that doesn't really exist anywhere else for good reason, because you have to either put in work or put in capital to get equity.
00:29:45.756 - 00:29:57.196, Speaker A: And so this just feels like optimism's community or not all of them. One or a couple of folks getting pretty mad that the price of their token went down and that these early people were dumping well.
00:29:57.220 - 00:30:34.572, Speaker B: But I think there is a use case for bootstrapping usage by incentivizing usage with tokens. I think that makes sense, like, with looks rare or something. I think it has to be well designed. And we've learned over the last year that it's not easy, but I think there's a legitimate use case for rewarding early users. And I also think that I agree that this proposal is kind of silly. And Coby's either responses are probable. His own proposal was absolutely hilarious.
00:30:34.572 - 00:31:24.998, Speaker B: So it was so funny. But I do think that there are these types of things in crypto that don't exist in tradfi, which I think would be an advantage to crypto. In tradfi, everyone gets the same dividend, but in crypto you can lock up your tokens for a year and the people who lock them up get a higher dividend. Like that's. Why not do that? I think Tradfi CEO's would love to be able to incentivize longer term holders. Probably the most consistent number one complaint about american capitalism is short termism. And this would be if tradfi companies could do what you can do in crypto, that could totally address that.
00:31:24.998 - 00:31:36.954, Speaker B: You could incentivize longer term holders to the disbenefit of shorter term holders. So I wouldn't dismiss it. I think there's something there. It just has to be really thoughtful and well designed.
00:31:37.614 - 00:32:19.746, Speaker A: So I agree there is something there and you should benefit early users. I think it's more the mentality around airdrops that's frustrating to me. I remember when the uniswap airdropped happened, there was not a single user who complained when that happened. Like, it was happiness all around. Everyone's making money, everyone's all happy, and that just like set the standard for airdrops. Now what's happened with airdrops is they feel very like, gamed and it feels like these like, sophisticated users have a clear advantage and everyone's trying to play the Airdrop game and people are, people get upset if like, the price of the token goes down, I guess kind of like when the, when an IPO happens and, and the price of it goes down, people are upset. But I don't know.
00:32:19.746 - 00:32:39.294, Speaker A: We saw Juno maybe a month or two ago, they confiscated $35 million in tokens from a whale who they thought game the airdrop. Now you have the optimism community discussing punishing sellers. I don't know, it just feels like take your tokens and be happy and do things that reward that accrue value.
00:32:40.114 - 00:33:07.338, Speaker B: Surprise. Airdrops are, I think, probably should not be a thing anymore. And even retrospective airdrops probably should not be a thing anymore. But I think you could design a thoughtful airdrop where you just lay out exactly the behavior that will get the next 5% of an airdrop or something and kind of pinpoint the usage that you're aiming for. I think it seems like that would be doable and useful.
00:33:07.516 - 00:33:12.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you read anything around layer ones as public goods?
00:33:12.702 - 00:33:14.674, Speaker B: A little bit, not very much.
00:33:16.614 - 00:33:46.802, Speaker A: You could make the argument that some of these layer ones are public goods or that something like optimism is a public good and that they didn't really have a monetization strategy at launch. And I think the comparison here could be something like Twitter. Twitter is basically just a public good. I didn't really have a monetization strategy. And then they tried finding monetization early or, excuse me, later. It feels like that's maybe what some companies are doing right now, like some L2s by saying like, it really is almost like a layer. It really is almost like a public good.
00:33:46.802 - 00:33:50.938, Speaker A: And then they're trying to find monetization later by just launching a token.
00:33:51.106 - 00:34:20.604, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't totally understand why L2s should have tokens. And I correct. Like my, my thought was that it's kind of like layers two are kind of like a wework thing. Like they buy block space on the layer one and then they resell it at L2. And maybe the way to monetize that is by taking a little tiny spread between buying it on layer one and selling it at L2. I don't think that's the case with optimism.
00:34:20.604 - 00:34:46.019, Speaker B: Right, because it's denominated in ETH. I think the benefit goes back to Ethereum. I'm not really sure. I don't know the details. So I could see where L2s would be monetizable, but it does not seem like a great business to me. Again, these are not going to be software companies with 80% margins. The L2 that's going to win, I'm assuming if it has a profit margin, it's going to be razor thin.
00:34:46.019 - 00:34:50.503, Speaker B: It's going to be thin enough that nobody else can be bothered to fork it.
00:34:51.283 - 00:35:12.460, Speaker A: Yeah. I think what the skeptic would say is that the op token is basically just exit liquidity for insiders and VC's and that something like op. And you could even argue other layer one tokens, even ETH, there's not really a clear value accrual system there, but.
00:35:12.532 - 00:35:23.020, Speaker B: I think there is. For L2s, there is a first mover advantage. If you collect a lot of liquidity on your L2, then other people are going to want to be on your layer too. So if you can.
00:35:23.052 - 00:35:28.264, Speaker A: But that's a disconnect. You're separating the network from the token there.
00:35:28.724 - 00:35:50.782, Speaker B: Well, but I'm just saying if you can use the token to incentivize usage, then that might have real long term value. I'm not like, that is not a token that I would want to buy, but I could see why they would do it and I could see why long term, that might be the best thing for the protocol.
00:35:50.918 - 00:36:11.862, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, I'm a huge fan of optimism, and I just, I'm trying to play Devil's advocate to a lot of this. Santiago and I did an episode kind of about the optimism token release when they announced that they were going to do this a couple of weeks ago. So you guys should go listen to that, which is a little more optimistic about optimism. So anything else on optimism you want to touch on here?
00:36:12.038 - 00:36:19.274, Speaker B: That is the full extent of what I know about optimism. I do not know. I do not even know enough of it to be expressing an opinion, really.
00:36:20.804 - 00:37:21.904, Speaker A: That's why we bring you on here, Byron, to talk about things that we have no real clear guidance on. One thing I do want to get your take on is that touches maybe the traditional financial world a little more than optimism. Launching a token is partnerships between miners and oil companies. Exxon, ConocoPhillips, marathon Oil, and some other oil companies are running pilots with BTC miners to use what otherwise would have been wasted gas from oil wells to power bitcoin mining operations. Do these new partnerships change the narrative around, like, bitcoin as bad energy as a dirty form of energy? Does clean bitcoin play into this? Actually, just zooming out, what are your thoughts on a lot of these? The Exxons and the ExxonMobils of the world and the big oil companies. Oil and gas companies starting to get into bed with the bitcoin miners and starting to bitcoin mine.
00:37:21.984 - 00:38:37.954, Speaker B: Yeah. From a crypto perspective, I think that if we're hoping to benefit from having a benefit from teaming up with the oil industry, then I think we're kind of in a bad place. The oil industry is not anybody's favorite either. So I'm not super hopeful about that. I'm also not hopeful that anyone is really going to understand the nuance of bitcoin being generated with waste, natural gas, or some form of energy that was going to be wasted and is therefore a zero cost. I do think the reality of it is that it's super valuable, and I think that it could, in fact, accelerate the transition to renewable energy because it's going to a renewable energy product that can mine bitcoin for free on the side, is going to be easier to start up and cheaper to finance than one that isn't. I think there's a real substantial argument to say that bitcoin could become a net positive for the environment, but there's one that is super hard to quantify.
00:38:37.954 - 00:38:50.856, Speaker B: I don't know how you quantify that. And two, that is like such a nuanced argument that and the case against bitcoin is so deeply entrenched that I'm not super optimistic that that narrative is going to take hold.
00:38:51.000 - 00:39:03.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I would have to agree with you. I want to get your take on a couple more things before we wrap this up. You tweeted a week ago Defi's killer use case front running. Tell me more about that.
00:39:03.672 - 00:39:05.912, Speaker B: That was a little clickbaity, I'll admit it.
00:39:06.088 - 00:39:15.184, Speaker A: Well, you got some retweets. Your Twitter's kind of booming these days. At bgilliam. 1982 I love.
00:39:16.244 - 00:39:28.268, Speaker B: Not a catchy handle, but I wasn't that. I wasn't really thinking about having a following when I signed up. But the benefit of that is that people think I was born in 1982, which that is not my birth year, but people think it is. So I'm not gonna. I'm not.
00:39:28.436 - 00:39:30.104, Speaker A: What's 1982 from?
00:39:31.244 - 00:39:39.914, Speaker B: Before I quit drinking, I was a large fan of french red wines. In 1982 is the all time greatest year in french red wines. Interesting.
00:39:40.004 - 00:39:44.230, Speaker A: Did you make the Twitter when you were drinking nice french red wines?
00:39:44.422 - 00:39:51.718, Speaker B: It's very possible there was a high. Whatever, you know, whatever time it was, it was a high probability that I was drinking a glass of french red wine.
00:39:51.766 - 00:39:56.074, Speaker A: Fair enough. Fair enough. Defi's killer use case front running.
00:39:56.974 - 00:39:59.910, Speaker B: I'm forgetting what that was in response to. I think that was. Oh, was that.
00:39:59.942 - 00:40:11.858, Speaker A: That was the wireless anon tweeted the real bull case for defi apps becoming their own interoperable apps. Specific l one s is to capture the value created by protocol. Mev few understand this, right?
00:40:11.906 - 00:40:44.950, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if the whole industry is going to be based on MeV, then I think that's a sorry state of affairs, because Mev is essentially front running. Right? Is there a better way to look at Mev? It's reordering transactions to the validator or miner's benefit, which to me is just front running, and that's totally fine. If that's what you have to do to. To secure the blockchain, that's totally fine. But that surely cannot be the one thing that the entire industry is built on, I hope.
00:40:45.102 - 00:40:46.734, Speaker A: Is there a way to prevent this?
00:40:46.854 - 00:41:19.636, Speaker B: The way to prevent this is to create better use cases, and I think those use cases exist. Payments, I think, is an amazing use case. Banking the unbanked, bringing real world assets on chain like maker is trying to do is an amazing use case. I don't think, you know, I don't think Mev is required for any of those things. You might need it to secure blockchains, but I'm hopeful that somebody will figure out how to secure blockchains without that. I think, like, I think cosmos is doing that.
00:41:19.660 - 00:41:19.772, Speaker A: Right?
00:41:19.788 - 00:41:36.860, Speaker B: Like, I don't think. I don't think you have to have mev. I think there's. If you're. I just think, you know, I am not a blockchain engineer, so I don't. I don't understand the details of this stuff, but if the. If Mev is the only way to really monetize blockchains, and I.
00:41:36.860 - 00:41:38.374, Speaker B: I think. Think crypto is in trouble.
00:41:38.534 - 00:41:41.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Why is front running a bad thing?
00:41:42.014 - 00:41:51.430, Speaker B: That's a tricky question. That's kind of like, why is inflation bad? It's like you never. Not something I've ever thought about. It's just bad.
00:41:51.622 - 00:41:59.286, Speaker A: Inflation is bad because it makes people who don't have assets, it makes their prices of everything higher, so then they.
00:41:59.310 - 00:42:37.490, Speaker B: Have less money and they getting same for same for crypto. Like, if I get front run every time that I trade a crypto, then that makes dealing in crypto more expensive than it otherwise would be. So, yeah, I think it's just inflating the expense of using blockchains and defi apps and stuff, and that's making it more expensive for users and more profitable for the miners and validators, which is not what we need. We need more users. We need miners and validators, too, but ultimately we need users.
00:42:37.642 - 00:42:48.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Two more takes I want to get your thoughts on. One was zero x homs, which I really like. This guy, I don't know who he is, but he's had some really good takes on Twitter recently.
00:42:48.242 - 00:42:50.362, Speaker B: He's anonymous. You're not supposed to know who he is.
00:42:50.458 - 00:43:12.874, Speaker A: All right, well, maybe it's not a he. Maybe it's the sheet or neither. Crypto needs. They tweeted out, crypto needs $102 billion of retail inflows to keep stabilizing the market cap. Can you explain this to me, how he got here? And do you agree with it or disagree with it?
00:43:13.614 - 00:44:01.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure that that $102 billion number is not correct because it's just a very rough approximation, but I think it's directionally correct. The easiest way to think about it is just to think about bitcoin is the miners all have dollar denominated costs. They have to pay taxes and they have to buy GPU's and whatever, whatever. And the way they pay for all that stuff is they sell the bitcoin that gets issued to them. So there is a steady outflow of bitcoin. There are structural sellers of bitcoin. And for the price of bitcoin to go up, there has to be new buyers coming in that are larger than the structural sellers.
00:44:01.934 - 00:44:42.584, Speaker B: So as an owner of bitcoin, you're totally dependent on new buyers coming in. That is not the case in equities. Equities as a whole generate cash. They pay dividends, they buy back stock. So whatever that is, five or 6% a year, whatever the number is, depending on the state of the economy and stuff, that is a tailwind for equities. All things being equal, if the new buyers and the new sellers balance out, you would expect equities to go up five or 6% a year because equities generate cash. It's the opposite in bitcoin.
00:44:42.584 - 00:45:33.704, Speaker B: If the natural buyers and sellers even out, you would expect it to go down to the degree that the miners have to sell bitcoin. I think that is true for the whole of crypto. There are just not very many profitable blockchains or protocols in crypto. I don't think there are any profitable l one s like maybe ETH post merge, but not ETH right now. And I think there are very few profitable protocols. One that I'm aware of is Makerdao. I think yearn always had been, but I had even read an article at one point that they were loss making in the first couple of the years, first couple months of this year, which is, you know, because they protocols have real expenses.
00:45:33.704 - 00:46:29.474, Speaker B: Like they have to pay devs and they have to, and they have to pay for the merch that they give away for free at permissionless and stuff like that. And the way that they pay for that is by, is by using their own tokens that they issued to themselves. So it kind of looks like they don't have expenses because they're just paying for them with, you know, pre issued tokens, but those tokens get sold. So that's like, you know, just the same way that miners are always selling bitcoin to pay for their expenses, protocols are always selling their own tokens to pay for their expenses. So that's, you know, that's a, that's a headwind for crypto as a whole, which is the opposite of equities. You know, equities has a tailwind from cash generation and crypto has a headwind from the emissions. Whether it's 102 billion or not, I have no idea.
00:46:29.474 - 00:46:31.362, Speaker B: But that's directionally, I think it's correct.
00:46:31.418 - 00:46:35.506, Speaker A: Does this tie back into your earlier comment that crypto is not an investable asset class yet.
00:46:35.610 - 00:47:18.394, Speaker B: Yeah, basically, if you just think about the price of bitcoin, if I think about the price of a stock, I can think about its earnings, and then I can think about what multiple those earnings should get, and then I can decide should it be higher or lower than here? But if you're thinking about bitcoin, you're just thinking about the price, you know? And when people make, when people talk about, like, oh, you know, I don't think it's going lower than 20,000. That's because, like, the last time it peaked at 20,000 or whatever, you know, it's just some, your price prediction is some derivative of price, which is circular. Right. So in that way, and which is totally great for trading, but it just, it's not really for investing, I don't think.
00:47:18.514 - 00:47:29.424, Speaker A: Yeah, but isn't all that you're saying here just that, um, these aren't cash flow generating things and that they need more cash coming in to keep the business alive, which is just like what venture capital is?
00:47:29.884 - 00:47:35.076, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. It definitely could change. It could be totally different.
00:47:35.140 - 00:47:46.548, Speaker A: It doesn't seem like that bad of a thing. It just seems like we're at the stage of the industry where this is a venture backed, venture backed industry and not a cash flow generating industry, like how a lot of tech was for the last 15 years.
00:47:46.636 - 00:48:12.714, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I think you could. You could. But it's just like, for me, it's just like how I try to conceptualize it. So for me, it's kind of like if I'm thinking about buying a token, I sort of think about, like, it's kind of like buying it at the series b raise with the intention of selling it at the series C raise, you know? So, yeah, I think it's very much, very much more venture capital than listed equities.
00:48:12.874 - 00:48:16.174, Speaker A: Anything else you're looking at these days, Byron? Luna two?
00:48:16.514 - 00:48:26.646, Speaker B: No, I do. I do have some. I do have some weird things trapped on Luna one that I need to figure out how to get out. I don't have too much of an opinion on Luna two.
00:48:26.790 - 00:48:33.158, Speaker A: Anything else that you're paying attention to, either in crypto or in just, like, broader global macro markets?
00:48:33.246 - 00:49:33.722, Speaker B: I guess stable coins are. I always think stablecoins are interesting. Yesterday's note was about tether, which I went, and I started to look at tether a little bit more deeply, expecting to come out with a very bearish take that this is a Ponzi or whatever, but I actually had the opposite I actually think that it's good for crypto because I think people are. If you look at their end of March financials, they had $160 million of equity, which is basically nothing. And they had a 6% allocation to crypto. And if you like haircut that by 30% or whatever bitcoin has done, they probably have negative equity of like 1.5 billion now, which if a money market fund in Tradfi had negative equity of 1.5
00:49:33.722 - 00:50:11.638, Speaker B: billion, it would be a race for the exits, right? And crypto, it's not bothering anybody. Tether is still happily trading at $1, and the tradfi take on that would be crypto. People don't understand finance and they don't know what they're doing. And that was kind of the take I was expecting to have when I went to it. But as I thought about it a little bit more, I think people probably know that and they're just not very bothered. I would assume that people think that tether is going to do the right thing and they're going to divert the earnings from the fund back into the reserves until they get back to being fully collateralized. And crypto having just survived UST going to zero.
00:50:11.638 - 00:50:37.610, Speaker B: They probably don't care very much whether tether is worth exactly $1 or $0.97. Like, ninety seven cents to a crypto person. Sounds like a dollar just rounded up to a dollar, which is great. I think that makes crypto more anti fragile and less panic prone than tradfi. I went into tether expecting to come out skeptical, and I actually was actually the opposite. I actually think it actually came out with a pretty positive take.
00:50:37.742 - 00:50:47.490, Speaker A: Yeah, they. The size of USD, USDT redemptions over the last two weeks, I think was $10 billion.
00:50:47.642 - 00:50:48.534, Speaker B: That's a lot.
00:50:48.834 - 00:51:24.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that rivals the size of the largest banking withdrawals in history, which is quite a large amount. On the other hand, Tether was very, very excited and very. They're really pushing that. They were able to handle withdrawals of 12% of their deposits in a week, which isn't that impressive of a thing. Banks see outflows of 12% of their deposits a week all the time, though. I guess the counter argument to that is that that's generally matched by corresponding inflows.
00:51:24.406 - 00:51:52.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you can look at it different ways. Let's just say if tether was actually only worth $0.90, then they could just. The first 90% of withdrawals would get 100% of their money, and then the last 10% would get zero. So the fact that they are processing redemptions is great. And that means it's not a total fraud. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get all of your money back.
00:51:52.478 - 00:52:15.456, Speaker B: I think you will. I think there's a funny line in tethers documents where, you know, it lists all the risks. And the last risk that they, that they list is we could abscond with the reserve funds, which I thought is very, which I thought was very amusing. But if they were going to do that, they would have done it already. Like, they weren't going to hang. You know, they wouldn't. They wouldn't have waited.
00:52:15.456 - 00:52:18.720, Speaker B: So I personally trust tether to do the right thing.
00:52:18.752 - 00:52:21.364, Speaker A: But just because you're optimistic on tether right now. Okay.
00:52:21.664 - 00:53:04.866, Speaker B: But just because they're processing a lot of redemptions is not necessarily being that all is copacetic. That's kind of like the take that Luna was our Lehman moment and we survived it, which I think is a terrible take. Luna is not systemically relevant to the world. The problem with Lehman was that it had $600 billion of real world assets. Luna did not have that. It had 40 billion of mostly paper gains, fake assets. So I don't think, yeah, I do think it was admirable that crypto just sailed through that without anything really happening.
00:53:04.866 - 00:53:25.054, Speaker B: But I think there was that one fellow that was tweeted about Luna not needing a government bailout. That's a pretty low bar. You were setting the bar for crypto. Really low. That's like congratulating yourself for not having a gin and tonic before noon. Congratulations.
00:53:25.954 - 00:53:43.042, Speaker A: It's the line of the episode. Byron, that's a good place to end it. Congratulating yourself that you didn't need a government bailout is like having. Congratulating yourself that you didn't have a gin and tonic before noon. It's a good way to end it. Byron, this was great, as always. If you guys aren't subscribed to the Blockworks newsletter, you should go read Byron's pieces.
00:53:43.042 - 00:53:47.824, Speaker A: He's got some spicy takes. And Byron, hope you enjoy the rest of the week, my friend.
00:53:47.994 - 00:53:51.204, Speaker B: This is funny.
