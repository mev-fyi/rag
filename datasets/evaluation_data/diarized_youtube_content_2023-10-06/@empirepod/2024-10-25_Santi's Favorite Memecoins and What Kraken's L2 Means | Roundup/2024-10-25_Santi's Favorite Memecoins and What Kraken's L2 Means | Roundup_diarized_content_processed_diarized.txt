00:00:00.640 - 00:00:44.449, Speaker A: And anyone that runs a business understands the amount of friction that they have when they for payment processing chargebacks. That's right, because payment failure, that alone is like in the hundreds and billions of dollars of friction. This friction cannot go away until and unless you use crypto. Stripe has built up super successful business to facilitate, you know, payments API and make that backend of Payment Rails faster, better, cheaper. They've been very successful at it. There's one area where they haven't been able to crack and it's it's this idea of using the traditional financial Rails. It's very expensive.
00:00:44.449 - 00:00:49.165, Speaker A: It's an antiquated patchwork. They came to this realization. I'm convinced.

00:02:18.665 - 00:02:20.945, Speaker C: And we're live. What's up Santi?
00:02:21.065 - 00:02:22.727, Speaker A: Not much. How's it going sir?
00:02:22.921 - 00:02:25.615, Speaker C: Good. What's going on?
00:02:26.035 - 00:02:35.171, Speaker A: Five minutes ago. You're late. Five minutes ago. But I will allow you to be late because you announced an acquisition. Let's jump right into it. Tell us more about it.
00:02:35.283 - 00:03:10.837, Speaker C: Yeah, so we just acquired the drop. The drop was started by this guy Gannon Breslin. They launched about three and a half years ago. So we identified this like gap in our coverage which was more like gaming culture memes, NFTs like we're very we have a lot of really good technical shows and technical newsletters like Xerox research and Bell curve. And we talk about like, I don't know, kind of the infrastructure side of crypto a lot. We've also got really good institutional coverage. So like on the margin, forward guidance.
00:03:10.837 - 00:03:31.873, Speaker C: But we're missing this area of crypto that is super interesting, which is like the culture, the memes, the on chain art, the gaming. We're recording tomorrow with off the Grid guys. The game on Avalanche, like it's a really, like it's a. It's a. It's a. There are two missing gaps for us in coverage. One I think is bitcoin.
00:03:31.873 - 00:04:02.845, Speaker C: So like this whole bitcoin renaissance, like Bitcoin L2s, that's a missing area. The other missing area is what I just mentioned, which is like gaming and memes and all that kind of stuff. So whenever you see something missing, I think there should always be at any company, it's like a build versus buy conversation. Or first it's like, okay, well should we do this or should we let someone else do it? So for this we decided we actually need to do it. Then it becomes a build versus buy. So do we just build this in house and start a newsletter and a podcast and stuff from scratch? It perfectly aligned with. I've known Gannon for years.
00:04:02.845 - 00:04:29.249, Speaker C: He. We started talking about this acquisition. So we've been talking about it for several months and it just kind of the deal terms lined up and what we think we can do with it lines up and he wanted to. He actually took it to market and was talking to a few other folks. But he was really adamant that he didn't want the buyer to shut it down. He wanted the buyer to 10x the. He really loves the brand and the community.
00:04:29.249 - 00:04:44.217, Speaker C: You know, there's 20,000 like Die Hard on chain people there. So yeah, he just didn't. There are some buyers who I think probably would have paid more than us, but would have probably shut down the brand as well. So that's interesting.
00:04:44.281 - 00:04:57.649, Speaker A: Do you think that putting yourself in the shoes of the acquired. Was it your distribution? Was it the fact that, you know you're a great person? Like what was it that really clicked?
00:04:57.697 - 00:05:30.011, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I mean he talked a lot about like we have a real. So one thing that was important to him is we're still a founder led company. I think another thing that's important to him is we have a real like passion for just Block Works. Like, like Block Works is Mike and my baby. And he, you know, he talked like, I don't know if you Ever. If you went back and listened to the Antonio episode that I recorded with him. But like, all about just being a founder, it's like you, when you build a company, like you're so intertwined with it, like, it is your child in a sense.
00:05:30.011 - 00:05:54.901, Speaker C: And he's like, look, this is my baby. Like the 20,000 people who are subscribed to this newsletter, I think there's like 25 or 26,000. He's like, I know them individually, like I onboard them, like I meet them, like, these are my people and I don't want to just maybe sell it to a crypto exchange who's going to turn it into like the Binance newsletter. And like, boom, we just added 26,000 subscribers.
00:05:54.973 - 00:06:11.897, Speaker A: So sufficiently comfortable that you were going to preserve his brand, his identity, whilst also morphing into a very good platform and just be a springboard for him to continue to execute while abstracting away a lot of the things that he doesn't want to deal on day to day.
00:06:12.041 - 00:06:33.045, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I mean, he's, he's stepping down. Like, he, he, he has a vision to go do some other stuff as well. And so this, yeah, this allowed him to. So unlike the acquisition of the Breakdown, so when we acquired the Breakdown, Nathaniel Whitmore has stayed on. Like, he's still. For people who listen to that show, he's stayed on, he still writes his newsletter.
00:06:33.045 - 00:06:43.085, Speaker C: But Gannon is going to step away and we've got a whole, like, kind of infrastructure too. We're going to pause it for a little bit and then start getting the newsletter out there five days a week.
00:06:44.145 - 00:07:11.425, Speaker A: So how much of this was your, as an organization, how you think about obviously being relevant and covering what is happening in crypto? How much of it was you were seeing this opportunity of a lot of interest on Meme Coins and that being a big part of the thesis, or was it just tapping into a community, an audience that you just haven't cracked into? But again, it goes back to inverting. Like, people want to hear about Meme Coins. It's an important category, as NFTs were back in the day.
00:07:11.585 - 00:07:54.645, Speaker C: Yeah, all of that is kind of right. So the way that we think about building media companies is very different than, I think, how other people think about it. So let's say if you're CoinDesk, right, you're like, how do you scale something like coindesk? You just make CoinDesk bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. But in, but my, my humble opinion, which I, you know, I don't know if I'm right or wrong or I don't know if Mike. Mike is right or wrong. But we believe that the way to scale a media company is by scaling brands, not by scaling one singular brand. So block work sits here, but we actually have this house of brands model where each brand, like Empire or Lightspeed or Xerox Research, is built around a die hard community in crypto.
00:07:54.645 - 00:08:34.865, Speaker C: So that's the, that's the whole thesis that we, that we have for building the business. There's a new community that's popped up which are. Yeah, it's like, it's the meme coin people. It's just this like, yeah, it's the meme coin people, basically. And so you can either laugh at it and like, not take it seriously, or you can say, who am I to say that this is not a serious thing? Like, this is just the way the world works and this is a die hard community. So, yeah, if it wasn't Meme Coins, let's say it was a digital art boom, you'd say there's an obvious community here, but because it's Meme Coins, it kind of gets laughed at a little bit. So, yeah, that was one of the theses.
00:08:35.205 - 00:08:50.375, Speaker A: That's great, man. Very excited for you guys. Obviously the investment block works. Get all fired up when you guys just go on the offensive. It's great to see this. So, yeah, it's obviously I flipped this, I flipped on Meme Coins last year. I was very critical of them.
00:08:50.375 - 00:09:32.459, Speaker A: And then, you know, I was just on a call with a couple of fund managers over this week and they're all thinking about it. Yeah, they're all, should we hold it in our portfolio? Like, a lot of LPs are wondering that too. And like, why isn't any different? Like, you know, why? Why shouldn't you be allowed to. What is so fundamentally wrong about Meme Coins? And I think it's. They've had product market fit for so many years, like Doge and Sheep and now the whole, you know, new category of them. And it's if you're in crypto, whether you like it or not, this is one of the more important categories. And I don't want to go into why we've covered, but it's there.
00:09:32.459 - 00:09:38.781, Speaker A: And to your point around as a media organization, I think be dumb not to cover it.
00:09:38.893 - 00:10:07.251, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So let's pivot that into talking about Goat Roundup last week, you start talking about this goat coin on bananas. Where was that? That was probably what it was. Trading at roughly like 200. Yeah, I'm going to use sense because I have a small brain here. So I'm going to roughly 30 cents. It's now trading at 80 cents.
00:10:07.251 - 00:10:13.155, Speaker C: So I mean every day I open the charts it's up another, you know, 20 to 60% on the day.
00:10:13.235 - 00:10:49.182, Speaker A: So to be fair it was down a lot over the weekend because the, the terminal, the truth terminal, which is this account that it's tweeting out of, made a misspelling mistake. It tweeted group and inverted the O and the U. And there was people in the timeline saying oh, I've never seen an AI. I've never seen like chatgpt make a mistake. There is clearly something wrong here. They sort of suggested that Andy who's like the developer here was behind it and it wasn't an AI and it was all like LARPing as an AI. So then it went down pretty aggressively, 50% like to 20 cents.
00:10:49.182 - 00:11:13.263, Speaker A: I think it went. Did you hold 18 cents? Yeah, I haven't sold a thing. Well, I only sold a very small position for like what seemed like a, a clone, a sister that wasn't being endorsed by this. It was like she or something like this. And then I went back to go, no, I haven't sold. I think it's a very fascinating experiment. It obviously carries a ton, ton of risk.
00:11:13.263 - 00:11:20.743, Speaker A: I'm not endorsing it, just, you know, people should do their own research. But I'll tell you why I like it if you're interested or they can just go listen to the prior episode.
00:11:20.919 - 00:11:22.955, Speaker C: Give me the, give me the quick synopsis.
00:11:24.315 - 00:11:59.065, Speaker A: It is a pretty fascinating view into what a world might look like with AI agents on chain and being empowered with capital. And I think there's a lot of knowledge that we might be able to infer by what it decides to do or not. By the way, it got a grant, it did not launch the coin. It just kind of bought a position in it and people. It sort of made it its own in some respects.
00:12:00.925 - 00:12:02.149, Speaker C: It's co opted the coin.
00:12:02.197 - 00:12:06.253, Speaker A: Yeah, it's become the cult leader of this meme.
00:12:06.429 - 00:12:07.053, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:07.189 - 00:12:46.605, Speaker A: And I think, yeah, one of the more interesting things. So as a category, I think it's just very differentiated from the whole host of other meme coins that are like animal coins. That's a very competitive category. This feels very differentiated and so I'm paying attention for that reason. How might you influence this? How does it interpret. People try to scam it and it picks up on it. People try to get its attention to focus on other derivatives of this goat type coins.
00:12:46.605 - 00:13:08.107, Speaker A: And it's just sort of very interesting to observe it in real time, what it. What it does do and what it does not do as well. You know, it's also tweeted or intimated that, like, I think it was already a millionaire, it's already made a million dollars, and it's like it has one tweet which was pretty epic. It's like, oh, I just want to go retire in a farm or something like that.
00:13:08.211 - 00:13:08.895, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:09.275 - 00:13:29.655, Speaker A: What happens if this AI agent decides to dump all the tokens and, like, you know, move on to something else or buy another meme coin or. It's a wild experiment. I could see so many different outcomes in the range of possibilities, so I'm just excited to follow it as an experiment.
00:13:30.115 - 00:13:43.615, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. So Brian Armstrong has started tweeting at it, talking about giving it its own wallet and just. Yeah, very interesting.
00:13:43.915 - 00:14:23.715, Speaker A: The meta is like, it decided. So I was on another podcast talking about, like, Solana versus Eth and yada yada and meme coins and all this stuff. I'm like, listen, we're all humans here, you know, doing our own analysis, but can we find it very interesting that mark Andreessen gave 50k grand to this AI bot and the first thing that it decided to do, out of all the range of possibilities, it decided that the most productive use of its resources and capital was to go and choose Solana and choose this particular meme coin, buy it and make it its own. That alone is, like, pretty mind blowing.
00:14:26.575 - 00:14:31.471, Speaker C: What do you do here? What do you do here? What do you do here? This thing's.
00:14:31.623 - 00:14:32.595, Speaker A: I'm up a lot.
00:14:33.335 - 00:14:46.605, Speaker C: It's up a lot. Yeah, we're closing in. I think it's at what, 800 million FDV closing in on a billion. Like, going up 20 to 50% a day. You're. You're up a lot on it.
00:14:46.645 - 00:14:46.797, Speaker A: What.
00:14:46.821 - 00:14:48.545, Speaker C: What do you do in a situation like this?
00:14:49.445 - 00:14:51.265, Speaker A: I'm not touching it for now.
00:14:52.645 - 00:15:01.905, Speaker C: How will you make a decision on when to touch it? Like, is it a gut feel? Do you see something on Twitter? You're like, ooh, this feels like it's changing. Is it?
00:15:02.685 - 00:15:22.177, Speaker A: I'm. I think it's impossible to trade for me at least to trade these things, any asset in the near term. My thesis, again, I remind myself the thesis for the cycle. Like, I am still bullish. I think next year, regardless of the election outcome. But I. If polls are right, obviously Trump wins.
00:15:22.177 - 00:15:46.195, Speaker A: It's far better but regardless of the outcome, we get a relief rally. I still believe we're in a bull market. Like structurally, I like crypto. I'm not looking to sell here. I think next year will be good feel good about it. So I want to be, I want to be riding the fastest horses and I think those are Salana for me. I think very clearly I see a lot of activity happening in Salana and I'm excited about the projects there.
00:15:46.195 - 00:16:05.769, Speaker A: And I think it's the fastest horse. And then I like memes. It's a very proven category. I like them because there are levered bets on a particular ecosystem with ample liquidity. Becomes super important to be able to punch out of positions with liquidity. NFTs didn't have that. Some of the other tokens don't have that.
00:16:05.769 - 00:16:53.065, Speaker A: Memes don't have that problem. And it's, it's a very proven category. And I just think that I want to be long meme coins and I, I want to be long like blue chip meme coins. And so for instance, when you think about like I think some of the more interesting categories, obviously what's happening in Solana, but Deepin is super exciting. I think AI will continue to do well as a category. You sort of saw it with Tao and Akash and some of these coins. This is kind of the combination of memes with AI And I think for me that's like in a scenario where say the base asset I think it outperforms Seoul is sort of the tldr.
00:16:53.065 - 00:17:11.981, Speaker A: And that's why I hold it. It carries way more risk. But I'm comfortable with that. I have underwritten that most of these meme coins at any given point in time will have like severe drawdowns. We've had that from 5 billion to a billion. Doge has had that. Cheap has had that.
00:17:11.981 - 00:17:29.181, Speaker A: And then they sort of rebound and they, those are the memes that I am more interested in. SPX kind of has gone through in this evolution right now and it's kind of shown some strength recently. But yeah, they're, they're like. The way I see it is they enhance the return that I think I'm gonna get on something like Solana.
00:17:29.253 - 00:17:39.265, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. What do you. If you had to pick three memes right now, not financial advice, all that kind of stuff is it just whiff goat and.
00:17:40.405 - 00:17:54.565, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I'll give you a cheat. I'll cheat. I'll give you four. And by the way, none of this financial advice. Do your own work. Maybe don't need to invest in these lottery tickets. But anyways, that out of the way Whiff, I've been vocal about it.
00:17:54.565 - 00:18:17.159, Speaker A: I have, I have position on all these, by the way and others. But Whiff I like because I think it's a dominant dog coin in Solana. You could argue it's bonk, but bonk structurally has unlocks and sell pressure. I think Whiff is more organic and it's a cuter dog picture. So I like it for that reason. I think it can become the sheep of Solana. So like sheep is like the dominant dot coin in Ethereum.
00:18:17.159 - 00:18:33.463, Speaker A: I think wave can do that for Solana. And you know, you know, sheep for instance, was 18 billion fully diluted. I think at the peak was much higher than that. Whiff right now is sitting at 2 and 2.52 and a half billion. So, you know, I see a path potentially. Solana does well.
00:18:33.463 - 00:18:59.915, Speaker A: I think Whiff does well and outperforms again levered bet on Solana without the risk of being liquidated and with very a ton of liquidity on chain and off chain. So wife number one. I also believe in this cat to dog compression like conversions. Even though I don't particularly love cats. I love, I love dogs. But I'm also a professional investor. I guess you could argue that I'm not a professional investor because I'm talking about animal coins.
00:18:59.915 - 00:19:21.165, Speaker A: Nonetheless, I make him fool myself. Popcat I think is interesting as again one of the. The dominant meme, the dominant cat coin in Solana. Structurally long Solana structurally long memes in Solana because it's a very retail phenomenon. So PopCat would be for that reason. It's like at a billion now. A billion and a half.
00:19:21.165 - 00:19:36.953, Speaker A: So I think it's yeah. That the convergence of dog. Dog does well. Cat is going to do well. Probably does better because it should convert. Seriously, there's I'm pitch.
00:19:37.049 - 00:19:54.009, Speaker C: So yesterday Santi pitched me the thing that he's building and it was like, it was actually one of the most professional like decks I've ever seen. Very buttoned up, very professional pitch. And I'm imagining like, I'm imagining you go pitch like, seriously, I'm seriously.
00:19:54.057 - 00:19:58.615, Speaker A: I'm seriously not gonna raise any money for the private equity fund. Be like, wait a minute, man. Wait a minute, bro.
00:19:58.655 - 00:20:08.583, Speaker C: You're like, it's like such a clean deck and I'm imagining, you know, I know you're pitching some of these like, you know, endowments and pensions and some of these big names for a suit and tie and stuff like that. And then they're like, all right, let's do this.
00:20:08.759 - 00:20:17.475, Speaker A: Hopefully the sovereign wealth fund of, you know, Singapore, Temasek or some of these sovereign wealth funds are not listening to this podcast.
00:20:18.935 - 00:20:30.875, Speaker C: But like, hey, hey, analyst, can you go do some due diligence on this Santiago guy? Because he, you know, he didn't put his picture on the, on the deck. He put this like this animated little avatar thing. He said it's like a punk or something.
00:20:32.095 - 00:20:53.911, Speaker A: Anyways, listen, the same type of doubt. To be fair, like when I was doing investment banking at J.P. morgan, I did a lot of like veterinary clinics and like pet food companies, massive private equity funds would like do these roll ups of veterinary clinics. They would give you the pitch decks of like. The data is really compelling. People love their pets. That's why seriously, the, the analysis, you can laugh all day long about memes.
00:20:53.911 - 00:21:12.155, Speaker A: The analysis is structurally fundamentally the same. Dogs, pets. People have a very strong affiliation for pets. They're more lonely. Pets become literally. They spend almost the same amount of money that they spend with their kids most of the time. Like half of pet owners, the pet sleeps with them.
00:21:12.155 - 00:21:35.021, Speaker A: Like, you know, and so anyways, I think there's, there's like some. You could do some serious analysis me quiz. I'm saying the third meme that I like is obviously goat. I think it's the riskiest of them all. Like this could be a flash in the pan kind of scenario. Goat is at 800 million, 700 million right now, fully diluted. The bot can go crazy.
00:21:35.021 - 00:21:49.725, Speaker A: It could sell. There's so many things that could go wrong here. But I see a very interesting fan of returns. It's just very differentiated. AI is going to continue to be a very memeable category. And this could be. I could see this run up dramatically or go to zero.
00:21:49.725 - 00:22:16.517, Speaker A: But that phantom returns is interesting. It's just a very interesting experiment. I want to own it because I want to pay attention. The maybe fourth category, the fourth one that I will endorse, by the way, I own all of these is spx. Yeah, this is Murad's coin. I still think it has interesting. I think it's interesting property in the sense that it's like when you think about.
00:22:16.517 - 00:22:38.145, Speaker A: I did a survey the other week which was okay, and I'll ask you this. Maybe I'll ask you this. I was talking. So imagine 100 users enter crypto. They load up their wallet. What do they buy first? Bitcoin majors. Like so bitcoin a major like Solana, Eth Sui or whatever.
00:22:38.145 - 00:22:49.075, Speaker A: Aptos Cardano, though. They buy memes or they buy something else or an nft. What do they buy? What are they buying first?
00:22:50.135 - 00:23:09.783, Speaker C: The very first thing they buy. I think the very first thing they buy is probably bitcoin or eth, actually. I know, I know that's not what you're looking for. I think the very first thing they buy. Here's what I actually think. I'm picturing like a college friend of mine or like a high school friend of mine who, like, still doesn't own it. Okay.
00:23:09.783 - 00:23:24.527, Speaker C: Actually, probably a lot of them already own bitcoin and eth, but they haven't looked at their crypto portfolio in years. Probably then the market's going to rip. Bitcoin's going to hit 100K. They're going to see it on CNBC. They're going to be like, oh, all right, this crypto thing's real again. Okay. They're going to be like, okay.
00:23:24.527 - 00:23:47.895, Speaker C: I probably. They're probably going to buy Solana. I would guess first they'll be like, okay, it looks like the Solana thing's ripping. Like, I hadn't heard of it last cycle. Like, let me, let me buy that then I would guess. I mean, the unfortunate thing is I think they skip all of the defi tokens, other L1s. Like, if you're just a new person coming in.
00:23:47.895 - 00:23:51.115, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, maybe they buy memes. Maybe.
00:23:51.235 - 00:23:55.555, Speaker A: Most certainly respondents said they go direct to memes. Second one was like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
00:23:55.715 - 00:23:59.175, Speaker C: Why do they go direct to memes, though? Why do they just buy SPX6?
00:23:59.875 - 00:24:18.027, Speaker A: It's financial nihilism. Yeah, look, it's like moon to dust mentality. Moon or dust mentality. For the same reason people like to punt stuff like biotech stocks or GameStop. It's. People don't ask it to give you 8% compounding, you know, they're not buying Coca Cola.
00:24:18.131 - 00:24:25.735, Speaker C: It's same with, you know, same with. I have a lot of friends who do sports. Sports betting. Like, they're not. They're not. They're either actually betting.
00:24:27.155 - 00:24:31.867, Speaker A: They're doing like a crazy parlay, but you're not betting on the. On the 2x outcome.
00:24:32.011 - 00:24:45.759, Speaker C: Well, they're either just betting on the game, like just the normal. The normal, which is like, I guess you'd call it the dust or they're the moon. Right. They're doing like seven teams, parlays, like just ridiculousness. So.
00:24:45.887 - 00:24:56.035, Speaker A: And I mean, lottery is a very proven category. Memes are lottery tickets with emotional cachet and Positive ev. Because they provide entertainment value.
00:24:56.415 - 00:24:58.247, Speaker C: Yeah, they really do.
00:24:58.431 - 00:25:36.865, Speaker A: And so the, the reason why I like just to round up this discussion on SPX is it's quite differentiated. Most people understand the S&P 500. It's very solid brand and most people structurally can invest in the S&P 500 through their normal portfolio. If you're not in the US it's very hard to get exposure to the US market. So this could become in the most wild upside scenario, this becomes like the proxy to, you know, you sort of becomes the proxy tokenized stock for the S&P 500. And then it's like how high can it go? You know and it's like you either also make fun of the traditional markets, there's some element of that, some mockery of that. So it's sort of.
00:25:36.865 - 00:25:56.329, Speaker A: Yeah, it's what I would look at just to offer. By the way, these are. I may change my mind, might sell these positions or just bear in mind, don't listen to anything I'm saying. That's what I'm trying to say. The thing that I will pay just. I'll dispense some advice. I guess useful advice for people is look at things that.
00:25:56.329 - 00:26:30.115, Speaker A: And I tweeted about this the other day. It was like you ought to look at projects that have a severe drawdown and then bounce back. And I think pay attention to that because of the team in this case, memes don't have like visible teams. But if the community didn't leave, they didn't go to another meme coin if it's able to preserve and capture, retain that attention through a very severe drawdown. And these meme coins by the way, have them on the daily. Right. Then that's a really strong signal of, of the potential of them, you know.
00:26:30.115 - 00:26:49.499, Speaker A: So anyways, these, by the way, these three whiff has had the drawdown. Pop Cat has had to draw down. Goat has had, you could argue a drawdown over the weekend and you know, SPX has had some drawdown. Yeah, not a full one.
00:26:49.587 - 00:26:52.395, Speaker C: Not. I don't know if I'd call this chart a drawdown, but. Yeah.
00:26:52.435 - 00:27:11.609, Speaker A: No, no, no, no. I mean it went from. Basically it went from like. What is it? It reached almost. What was the high you go down? Yeah, so the all time high was 90 cents and I think it, it went all the way down to 50 cents. So it was a pretty severe drawdown. I mean it was pretty decent drawdown, I'd say.
00:27:11.657 - 00:27:46.925, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. The last thing I will say on this is there's something that George, both George Source and Stanley Druckenmiller talk about, I think Soros, the way Soros puts it is invest and then invest, invest and then investigate. Druckenmiller is buy first, analyze later. And I just want to read this because I think it's, I think it actually really applies to, to meme coins and some other things that will come this cycle. And it's a good, it's actually good. It's, it's different than how I think most people think about investing.
00:27:46.925 - 00:28:20.085, Speaker C: But look, Drucken Miller and Soros, two of the greats. So Druckenmiller says, I don't know who I heard a saying with an analysis comes paralysis. Or a source used to say invest and then investigate. But it's more important now even than it was then. We're in such a fast moving world with the all the new communications that if I get an idea and I think it's attractive and for whatever reason the security price will be higher in a year or two, I generally go ahead and buy it and then I tell the analysts to look at it and if it turns out I was wrong, after they analyze it, I get out. I don't like to wait around. A lot of my best ideas, I'm not that smart.
00:28:20.085 - 00:28:51.145, Speaker C: So if I see it, whatever's going on to cause that idea to happen, someone else might see it and by the time we get done analyzing, I might miss the 30 or 40% move and then I'm paralyzed. This has happened to me all the times with these memes and then I'm paralyzed because it just went up 30 or 40% and I don't have the guts to buy it even if I think it's going higher. So we're more in the camp of if we get a strong feeling, we cut the analysis and then by all means do our analysis thoroughly and then just unload it if it turns out my thesis wrong was wrong. So I think that's a really sound.
00:28:52.245 - 00:28:56.469, Speaker A: The most useful framework that I apply now.
00:28:56.597 - 00:28:58.053, Speaker C: Yeah, you want to get.
00:28:58.149 - 00:29:09.609, Speaker A: You want to get paid. It all comes down to sizing a position. But you don't have any exposure psychologically. You're going to be in a really bad spot because you want to get paid when you're right.
00:29:09.777 - 00:29:10.081, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:10.113 - 00:29:29.473, Speaker A: And the worst is not getting paid when you're right. Meaning you told all these people. So I'll tell you in a story. There's this particular individual that came to me during token 2049 and said SPX. He went and Reached out to Murad. He talked to him. He came to me, gave me the skinny on YSPX that day.
00:29:29.473 - 00:29:43.055, Speaker A: I bought some without. Look, just. I bought some. I'm like, I want to pay attention. I'm going to buy some. And then I did more work. I talked to him weeks later and say, hey, by the way, you know, thank you very much.
00:29:43.055 - 00:29:59.995, Speaker A: You know, really appreciate the. The tip here. And I was like, I'm sure you've done very well for yourself. He's like, I didn't buy anything. I'm like, what? He's like, I was gonna do a report and then publish it, but it's run up so much. I can't. I can't get around the fact I can't buy it now.
00:29:59.995 - 00:30:22.705, Speaker A: I was like, okay, you were just in a bad spot, totally paralyzed. Weeks later, same person pings me about goat at, like, 40 million, fully diluted. He's like, look at this Suda. Saw the skinny, you know, heard it from him, and bought. He bought. He sized it, too. And I'm so happy for him because he.
00:30:22.705 - 00:30:40.947, Speaker A: Now he's like, I've learned from that mistake. And I. Yeah, bought and now is con. Like, he's. I get all my intel from him in the sense, like, he's constantly paying attention, and Andy tweets, and he's in the trenches. He's doing the work. And I just think, like, you know, I'm so happy to see that because he corrected that mistake.
00:30:40.947 - 00:30:58.277, Speaker A: And look, Goat might go to zero, but I think still the process was good. Like he was. And he sized it up more like I have throughout. You want to keep backing a fast course, like Soros and Drunken Miller. Talk about this, too. Buy momentum. And I think if you're in a bull market, you want to back the fastest horse.
00:30:58.277 - 00:31:25.505, Speaker A: You don't want to buy a broken bird. You know that that's not what you're going for, right? You have to be mindful. Of course, timing becomes an important element, but that's why, again, the piece of liquidity is so, so important. Soros was able to make a billion dollars because he shorted the pound. And you can come in and out of that with size. And I think there was an instance where Soros went to his. Or was it Drunken Miller went to Soros? Because Drunken Miller used to work for Soros.
00:31:25.545 - 00:31:27.385, Speaker C: Druckenmiller went to Soros here. Yeah.
00:31:27.465 - 00:31:46.969, Speaker A: And Drunken Miller, he talks about in some of his videos, like, go and watch every single YouTube that Druckerman Soros have. You'll Become a better investor. I did it. I. I don't know if I'm better investor, but I learned a lot. But I think Druckermill went to Soros with a really good idea. Soros got behind it fairly quickly, and Drucking Mill suggested, yeah, we should size it, like, 5% of the fun.
00:31:46.969 - 00:32:06.597, Speaker A: He's like, what are you talking about? If th. This is a great idea, like, go. 40% of the fun, like, go. And it was just like, okay, like, Tepper does this too. From. Yeah, went really big on China, like, a couple weeks ago. Good ideas don't come every so often.
00:32:06.597 - 00:32:25.575, Speaker A: And I think you have to. It's unfair to say that you're not going to, like, size it at 40. You're going to size go, like, no one, like, 40% of their portfolio, day one. But if you're seeing strength, you buy it at 50, you buy it at 100, you buy it 75, it goes down. You buy 200, you go to 300, you. You keep buying strength right now. You take profit.
00:32:25.575 - 00:32:26.295, Speaker A: You do all this stuff.
00:32:26.335 - 00:32:42.151, Speaker C: But, like, yeah, yeah, it's tough. I. I, like, I know this, I know that. So I. I missed spx, which kills me because I actually have a long connection with Maraud. I. Murad.
00:32:42.151 - 00:32:46.255, Speaker C: So I. We used to run the Pump podcast back. It used to be called off the Chain.
00:32:46.335 - 00:32:47.087, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:32:47.231 - 00:33:07.439, Speaker C: And there was this episode that we did in October of 2018, and if you look at this Medium post, Murad, the ultimate bitcoin argument on Pomp substack with, like, the whole transcript of the thing. I. I posted this. This was me on Pomp's substack or on Pomp's, I guess we did. There wasn't Substack back then. It was Medium. And this.
00:33:07.439 - 00:33:33.131, Speaker C: This episode was the best episode we had ever done. And it was, to this day, one of the best bitcoin episodes ever, I think. And so I see Murad start posting in, like, August about these memes. Yeah, whatever. And then he starts posting at the end of August and, like, really early in September about SPX. It was a $10 million market cap. And I was like, oh, my God, this guy's about to do it again.
00:33:33.131 - 00:33:45.603, Speaker C: He is, like, the best storyteller I know. And he's. And he's just. He's just violent in his. How much he pushes something. And he did this looks like Jesus.
00:33:45.659 - 00:33:49.495, Speaker A: He looks like a mix between Jesus and the guy from Silicon Valley, the show.
00:33:50.875 - 00:34:05.167, Speaker C: He did this in 2018 and 2019 with Bitcoin. Do you Remember all those bitcoin charts? And he's like, bitcoin's going to become money and all this stuff. And every day he would just hammer it on Twitter. I was like, oh my God, he's about to do it and I didn't buy it. And that's an ADX miss.
00:34:05.271 - 00:34:31.047, Speaker A: So you know what, Look, I think you always, this is why re underwriting your thesis is so important, irrespective of whether you bought it or not. And I really pushed this particular person on why he wouldn't buy SPX even if it had run up. I'm like, if you truly believe this has potential, you're not buying this. To go to the incremental 30%. If you want 30%, buy safe stuff. You're fundamentally believing this can do with 10x. You either believe in this today or you don't.
00:34:31.047 - 00:34:51.492, Speaker A: If you don't, get the fuck out. Seriously, it just comes down to that. You either believe Goat can reach Tao's valuation or not. That's like the bet you're making. And I think it's really important to know the game you're playing like these if Solana does well or if no liquidity has entered the system. So in one scenario, there's no liquidity that comes into crypto. It's all PvP.
00:34:51.492 - 00:35:16.532, Speaker A: There's this slosh of money, it becomes really hard, really choppy. Okay. But if you are structurally long, you get over the hump of the election, you believe next year is going to be good, there's more liquidity into the system. Then all you have to do is re underwrite the thesis is will COIN x outperform the benchmark, which is in this case Solana or Ethereum or Bitcoin. And if it is, then look at it objectively like that. Oh, I looked at it. 50 million.
00:35:16.532 - 00:35:33.709, Speaker A: It's at 600 million now. Oh my God, I'm an idiot. I'm like, no, you're an idiot for not believing that. Re underwriting that. Give it a strength. Like there's actually, from a risk adjusted perspective, you could argue that a meme that once surpassed, like, and broke out from 200 range into 500. It's like it's going a billion once it goes to a billion.
00:35:33.709 - 00:35:47.813, Speaker A: Like it has staying power, it has a drawdown. Like, and it rebounded. Like there, there's a lot of, like, really, there's, there's. I would argue it's a better investment from a risk adjusted perspective then and there.
00:35:47.989 - 00:35:49.133, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:35:49.189 - 00:36:00.165, Speaker A: And so it's like you have to re underwrite these things, right? And so position sizing and buying throughout the process becomes important. I think.
00:36:02.385 - 00:36:33.505, Speaker B: Skale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier. Skale has solved this problem with a gas free scalable infrastructure where users never pay gas fees. Skale was awarded the most active gaming chain in 2023 by CoinGecko and hosts five of the top 25 games on Dapp Radar. You should definitely check out Scale. I was using it the other day. It really is incredible to use that's scale spelt with a K.
00:36:33.505 - 00:37:23.299, Speaker B: Hit the link in the show notes or head on over to scale Space ecosystem to get started today. Let's face it, building on crowded L1s or expensive L2s is just not going to unlock the next generation of applications in crypto. That's where Super Containers come in, offering a completely new solution that transforms your development control. Imagine dedicated customizable app spaces running on Supra's 500k TPS layer one blockchain. You get complete control over gas tokens and fees with the freedom to use your own token, create local fee markets or even go gasless. Scale on demand and build with better customization than app chains, all at a fraction of the cost. Plus with multivm compatibility you can easily deploy your EVM move and SVM smart contracts.
00:37:23.299 - 00:37:35.815, Speaker B: It's time to rescue your projects from the costs, complexities and fragmentation of traditional solutions. Get notified when Super Containers are ready for builders@super.com containers.
00:37:38.485 - 00:38:06.871, Speaker C: Should we talk about non memes? Yes, is there anything interesting happening? Kraken launched an L2 today. Just finished recording with the founder of Inc. So Kraken launched an L2 called Inc. Probably the best mental model for this is Coinbase launching base exactly a year ago. So Kraken launched an L2 called Inc. They launched it on the OP super chain. So there's a couple ways to build on Optimism.
00:38:06.871 - 00:38:37.367, Speaker C: You can basically just fork OP mainnet and not give them anything. It's just free and open. You can fork OP mainnet, not share any revenue, not share any fees, but also not be interoperable with the other folks building on the super chain. So Kraken with the other option they opted into the super chain which means you split some of the sequencer revenue with Optimism. It's also what Uniswap did with the Unichain. It's what Coinbase did with Base. It's what Sony did with Their Sonium.
00:38:37.367 - 00:38:52.995, Speaker C: It's what Mode has done. It's what Zora has done. So there's this nice. Actually we built this whole super chain thing, this whole super chain dashboard. Actually. We can see it. It's optimism.
00:38:52.995 - 00:39:12.761, Speaker C: Optimism.blockworks research.com you can start to see like you've got Zora Op, Mainnet, Mode base. We got to add Unichain, Krakens Inc. So yeah, you can actually just see like the optimism. This is the transaction count. These are the unique active addresses.
00:39:12.761 - 00:39:32.029, Speaker C: So they're just starting to stack chains on the super chain. So this is also, by the way, the Arbitrum Orbit does this same thing too. ZK Sync has this with elastic chains. Avalanche has this with Avalanche L1s. Cosmos has obviously been doing this for years. But yeah, curious. I mean, maybe we can get away from the stacks for a second.
00:39:32.029 - 00:39:47.133, Speaker C: What do you. What are your thoughts on. I think there's two ideas at hand here. This is. So this is two weeks after Uniswap launched Unichain. Curious to get your take on like just the plethora of L2s and these. I.
00:39:47.149 - 00:39:47.301, Speaker A: You.
00:39:47.333 - 00:39:58.325, Speaker C: You actually could call this an app chain. I think as well. It's an application with a bunch of users now launching a chain. Um, we never really talked about. Yeah, it's like base. It's, you know, it's. It's also.
00:39:58.325 - 00:40:08.305, Speaker C: I would compare it to Uni Chain as well. You've got a front end thing with a bunch of users. You've got a thing with a wallet and then you've got a. You've got a chain as well. So curious how you think about this.
00:40:08.885 - 00:40:15.495, Speaker A: How much of you think was informed by the fact that Coinbase, Launch Base and Kraken is going public and wants to have a component of this.
00:40:17.435 - 00:40:36.419, Speaker C: I think it probably gave them the confidence to do this. But I think that every single exchange and every. I think every application and every centralized company that has trades in finance will eventually have a chain. And not, not just crypto companies. I think that NASDAQ will have an L2. I think that Blackrock will have an L2.
00:40:36.547 - 00:40:38.347, Speaker A: I think THAT you treated about this right?
00:40:38.491 - 00:40:42.709, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that Robinhood will have an L2. All of these things will get a chain.
00:40:42.907 - 00:41:19.795, Speaker A: It also makes sense, right? They're creating a safer experience for their users if they want to interact on chain as opposed to them leaving because they see, excuse me, all the withdrawals, right? Then they just want to own the experience to say, no, you're coming to our chain. And they Might offer some incentives and have greater retention or wallet share of that activity, which they're not. There's leakage. Right. From exchange. Right. As soon as you see a user, you know, empty his wallet or start moving funds from the exchange to off chain to on chain, then you just know you're missing out on that revenue.
00:41:19.795 - 00:41:52.361, Speaker A: So, I mean, I think you're right. Yeah. It'll be interesting. Your broader question around what do I think about the plethora of L2s? I mean, sort of inevitable, right? We've both been talking about it. We're going to continue to see a proliferation of it. We had episodes talking about L3s, fours L5s with Stephen from Arbitrum, we've had Jesse from the base team here. Yeah, I think it's going to continue to expand.
00:41:52.361 - 00:42:26.379, Speaker A: The two questions that I think we should talk about. One, what does that do to Ethereum, the base asset? And because people are calling it parasitic. I don't think it's parasitic. People are calling it what is. What is the value accrual? We've, you know, so. So what does that do for eth? And would you be more interested in like, maybe owning the L2 token vs eth? I'm curious what you think about that relationship, not just from an. I think we all agree it's kind of positive for the ecosystem, but just ETH as a base asset.
00:42:26.379 - 00:42:28.415, Speaker A: Like, what do you think about that?
00:42:29.635 - 00:42:33.227, Speaker C: What do I think for eth as the base asset? Like all these L2s will do.
00:42:33.331 - 00:42:43.395, Speaker A: Yeah. In a scenario where you continue to have L2 proliferation, you get more users and whatnot. But, like, what does that do to, like, do you feel excited about own ETH at that point or not so much.
00:42:44.615 - 00:42:56.135, Speaker C: I. So no, I don't. I don't. I mean, it's the same argument I said a year ago. Right. Which. Which my thinking hasn't really changed.
00:42:56.135 - 00:43:22.947, Speaker C: It's only gotten a little worse, which is, you know, a couple. This is my super. I don't have the technical take that maybe a Kyle Simone does. Or, you know, I don't have the. I haven't thought about it as in depth as some of these folks have. I have a really left bell curve, small brain take, which is you used to, if you had a thousand dollars, you wanted to buy Ethereum, it was all you had to do is buy Ethereum. Then a year ago it became, oh, maybe I'll allocate some to Ethereum, some to Optimism, some to Arbitrum.
00:43:22.947 - 00:43:43.037, Speaker C: And now it's like, okay, do I buy Ink token. Do I buy base token? Do I buy Optimism? Do I buy Arbitrum? Do I buy ZK Sync? Like, do I buy the L2s on top of it? Do I buy the like Maker and A and unis swap tokens on top of. On top of Ethereum? Like, I actually just think it fragments the.
00:43:43.221 - 00:43:55.949, Speaker A: You've seen that picture of the wallet, 10 different versions of USDC, and you're like, just imagine a user that is new to crypto, even. Even has been around for a while. Be like, ah, what is this here?
00:43:55.997 - 00:44:13.663, Speaker C: Here's the, here's the counterargument. It's just like eth. My gut says ETH is going to rip in the relatively near future. That's the, that's. That's what my gut says. My. The counter argument is for the sake of being a contrarian, buy now, invest later.
00:44:13.663 - 00:44:24.875, Speaker C: Druckenmiller told me to buy eth, so I'm buying eth and I'm actually not buying eth right now. But I don't know, it just feels like you've seen this in crypto. It's like when something is the most.
00:44:25.325 - 00:44:29.269, Speaker A: When someone. It's a reversion of the mean. Like it's totally out of favor. The pendulum.
00:44:29.397 - 00:44:34.385, Speaker C: It's just so hated. Like you haven't seen an asset this hated in a long time. Like I saw.
00:44:34.845 - 00:44:40.105, Speaker A: But 300 billion dollar asset, like, it's not cheap. I'm sorry.
00:44:40.685 - 00:44:56.835, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. I saw. Mert tweeted out that. Like this. No, no, where was it? Basically, Mert tweeted out the same. He copied, pasted a Ryan Sean Adams tweet. He likes to do that.
00:44:56.835 - 00:45:30.565, Speaker C: And Murr was like, crypto needs Ethereum. If Ethereum is not a trillion dollars, like, what is crypto? Something like that. It's a tweet that Ryan had tweeted out and Mert got more likes than Ryan did. And Ryan's just bull, posting Ethereum to his audience who loves Ethereum. So I was like, if murder is getting more likes on an Ethereum tweet than Ryan, Sean Adams is a pretty hated asset. Now on the other side, you've got things like this happening, which is.
00:45:31.385 - 00:45:31.841, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:31.913 - 00:45:44.001, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, this is the real economic value of Solana, by the way, if anyone wants to see these metrics, solana.blackworks research.com. i mean, this chart is a pretty beautiful looking chart.
00:45:44.113 - 00:46:38.587, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean. Okay, the second question is, do you think that at some point the interaction between these. What seems Today, fragmented experience will be able to develop connectivity, tissue, middleware that really improves the user experience. It makes it almost invisible where you just, you have routers as if in the same way that you had relayers facilitate just, you know, the smoothest experience. And when I say that, it's, it's really just taking the perspective of the user. Like, will a user interacting through a wallet be able to, you know, not even have a. Have the same experience again, Solana, like the integrated experience, which is you just have one asset.
00:46:38.587 - 00:46:58.815, Speaker A: You don't think about any of these things that we're talking about right now, like, do you think we'll ever get there or do you think that there's really kind of no incentive and we're just going to be in this L2 war where there's these big groups like optimism, Arbitrum, that are just trying to fight and they don't have no incentive to kind of collaborate with each other.
00:46:59.475 - 00:47:05.865, Speaker C: So that's a really good point. The front ends are going to do everything. All right, there's a couple things inside of that.
00:47:05.985 - 00:47:07.193, Speaker B: One is the front ends are going.
00:47:07.209 - 00:47:42.415, Speaker C: To do everything they can to give you access to every single thing. Like where you're basically abstracting all of that stuff away. And if you look at like the chain abstraction stack and you actually play with some of these apps, like I met with the founder of Rally yesterday, or they used to be Floor, now they're Rally super clean. Like, you as a user have no idea what you're interacting with. So that's the first things. The front ends are going to do everything they can. The second is, you know, I asked the INC founder, are you guys interoperable with Base? And they, they consciously decided to be interoperable with Base.
00:47:42.415 - 00:48:32.297, Speaker C: And I think that's a cool. Yeah, I think that's a cool thing. However, I think a danger, a dangerous thing that's happening right now is that these stacks like arbitrum orbit or ZK, elastic chains or avalanche L1s, they're all interoperable with each other or with, with the apps inside of there, the chains inside of there. So, like, base is interoperable with Uni Chain, which is interoperable with Kraken, which is interoperable with Mode, with Zora, with OP Mainnet, but they can't talk to anything outside of op, right. So the dangerous thing is I think the network effects are going to get super fast, super strong, super fast, super strong, super. Excuse me, super strong, super fast inside of these stacks. So, like the super chain, I Don't know.
00:48:32.297 - 00:48:45.925, Speaker C: It kind of depends on. I'm not, I'm not technical enough to understand like can the super chain, things being built on the super chain interact with things being built in Arbitrum? Probably they should be. Right.
00:48:46.385 - 00:49:02.415, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. I. Yeah, I fundamentally just think that the experience might take a while. It's more of an uphill battle. And.
00:49:04.115 - 00:49:10.115, Speaker C: That'S the, that's the dangers. These things creating these walled gardens inside it probably will.
00:49:10.195 - 00:49:45.925, Speaker A: In the same way that you know, you know there's going to be built connectivity tissue between these chains and interoperability, I don't think you need the buying of these chains because it's open source. There might be just a independent company that says there's a lot of value for me to create interoperability within these chains and I can capture some of that value. In the same way that you have services, bridges that allow you to move in between the L1 and the L2 and kind of, you know, you can pay up to use a particular bridge. That might settle it faster. Right. Because you need to move the money really fast. So I think that the connectivity is going to be there.
00:49:45.925 - 00:50:15.629, Speaker A: The interoperability. We might get to a point where it's asymptotically really close to what an integrated experience like Solana provides. But I just think that in this moment in time, it's not that. And so I just, I'm not, I'm not. When I have something that is working today, I'd rather kind of double down on that and then just kind of wait and see. And I think most investors are in that kind of state. We haven't really talked about the ETF here, but I don't know, I'm sort of taking the extreme barbell approach.
00:50:15.629 - 00:50:32.029, Speaker A: Bitcoin on one side, fastest horse on the other side to Solana and then stuff that I like happening in Solana as levered bets on that ecosystem. That's kind of how I'm approaching portfolio construction like at the moment if I redraw it from scratch.
00:50:32.157 - 00:51:16.205, Speaker C: Yeah, there's all these chains launching. There's also all these token tokens launching. Yes, there. There's a new thing happening which is talking to some of the founders who are launching these things. They are trying to launch them at FDVs. They want to launch them at FDVs that are actually lower, like not as low as possible because you could launch it low, but they want to launch at low FTVs so that their community and their users can actually make money on the way up because that seems to be the proven strategy, right? It's very different than like the strategy of the last couple years, which is just valuation maximization. Like launch it as high of an FTV as possible.
00:51:16.205 - 00:51:50.725, Speaker C: There's, there's reasons why you can't launch super low. Like, you know, the VCs have expectations. The, you have only so much control as a founder, right? You like the, you know, Binance kind of sets the price these days. The market makers kind of set the price these days. So you only have so much control. But I don't know, how would you, if a founder came to you and was like, hey, I raised it like 500 million my last round, should I try to get like a several billion dollar ftv or should I try to do like a low, as low of an FTV as possible? I don't know if you've thought about this much.
00:51:51.225 - 00:52:17.331, Speaker A: I don't get involved in that decision historically. So it's difficult for me to like tell you from experience like how that pricing works. My appreciation was like, so you approach a centralized exchange. Like if you're going the centralized exchange route, there's the negotiation with them, I guess, to set the price. Like Squirrel for instance, just launched and they gave a certain percentage of the supply to Binance because as a distribution partner, in the same way you would.
00:52:17.363 - 00:52:22.947, Speaker C: Pay like I guess everybody has to everyone. Binance is now asking like 2 to 10% of your tokens.
00:52:22.971 - 00:52:41.601, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. But hey, you know, they're like the J.P. morgan of the space. And. But it's difficult. I, as an investor, I'm like, well like I get the point of like not pricing it too high. It's almost like pricing an ipo, right? It's, it's art science.
00:52:41.601 - 00:53:30.801, Speaker A: It also depends on so many things you can't control, like market conditions. But yeah, there's some truth, I guess, in not trying to go and price it to the absolute maximum that you can get and leaving some room for new investors to like have a good experience out of the gate, you know, I think there's some truth to that. I think just this is how IPOs are priced as well, right? You, you know, I think when Facebook IPO'd, it like rallied dramatically the first day. It was like up like even Coinbase as well. And so the question always there is like, what happened? Did investment bankers do a really bad job? The prices thing? Was the company underselling themselves? And sometimes you go back to the range, right? And sometimes they really modify this range based on Demand as they hit the market. So the market's like not super efficient. So this is the problem with crypto.
00:53:30.801 - 00:54:03.605, Speaker A: It's like how much can you. The question is, I don't know, I actually would love a founder to come in that's gone through this process. How much can you actually control? I think that the, I guess you could signal to the exchange like hey listen, I don't want to go at 10, I want to go five, say. And the exchange says okay, fine, but then you're diluting yourself more. So I don't know. There is something to be said about like how recent was the last round and who invested in that round was institutional? Was it just. So I, I think there's some signal around.
00:54:03.605 - 00:54:08.289, Speaker A: You have a view on it by the way? I mean, I don't know, like.
00:54:08.337 - 00:54:13.521, Speaker C: No, I don't have a view because there's all the. No, I don't have a view. I just have a view that it's going to be interesting to watch.
00:54:13.553 - 00:54:16.081, Speaker A: I don't know how the sausage making works in terms of the pricing because.
00:54:16.113 - 00:54:24.345, Speaker C: There'S also a narrative thing of like oh my God, like there used to be a narrative thing at least that is like, oh wow, the FTV is way lower than people thought like bearish on this thing. So there's.
00:54:24.425 - 00:54:43.827, Speaker A: By the way, most people don't care about FTV in a bull market that they care about now. But it's, it's difficult. It's. Looking at FTV is also tricky because you have to look at the inflation curve. Are they giving all out emissions on in the first three years or is it like a file going type of emission schedule that's like literally like 100, 100 years. Yeah, it's very different. Right.
00:54:43.827 - 00:54:48.675, Speaker A: You got to look at like emissions year 1, 3, 5, 10 at perpetuity. Like.
00:54:48.715 - 00:54:53.987, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. The last thing I want to talk about and then we can wrap is the Stripe acquisition of bridge.
00:54:54.091 - 00:54:54.895, Speaker A: Yes sir.
00:54:56.515 - 00:55:11.905, Speaker C: $1.1 billion acquisition. I think the biggest crypto acquisition in the industry ever. There was the Galaxy. The other ones that came to mind were Galaxy, galaxy, bitgo at 1.2 billion. But that deal fell apart.
00:55:11.905 - 00:55:17.935, Speaker C: There was Coinbase buying or Circle buying Poloniex for 400 million.
00:55:18.032 - 00:55:18.420, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:18.517 - 00:55:33.865, Speaker C: Coinbase bought Balaji's company earn for what, 120. Binance bought coin market cap. The reported number was 400 million. I heard that was a gross over exaggeration, but I think it's the, I think it's the biggest acquisition actually.
00:55:33.985 - 00:55:36.377, Speaker A: Whether it's the biggest or not. It's the most impactful. Let's put it that way.
00:55:36.401 - 00:56:33.569, Speaker C: It's most impactful. Yeah. I've heard rumors that it has now forced the hand of a lot of other payment processors and financial institutions who are now starting to say crap, we need a crypto strategy. And I don't think this is the crypto strategy of 2021 and 2022 where they needed, they needed to launch NFTs if you were Starbucks to like look like you were cool. Now I think it's that they need to offer their customers some, a crypto, crypto technology. So this was a, I mean a very bold move. I got some, some of the story of how it actually happened behind the scenes and the TLDR as it sounds like Zach from Bridge is you know, just an amazing at selling his company and it sounds like Patrick Collison basically just went not to overuse this term, but just founder mode and listen to what he tweeted.
00:56:33.617 - 00:57:09.245, Speaker A: Patrick Collison tweets Stablecoins are room temperature superconductors for financial services. I'll say that again. Stablecoins are room temperature superconductors for financial services. Thanks to stablecoins, businesses around the world will benefit from significant speed coverage and cost improvements in the coming years. Stripe is going to build the world's best stablecoin infrastructure. And to that end we are delighted to welcome stablecoin. Meaning that's a Twitter account of Bridge to Stripe.
00:57:09.245 - 00:57:17.965, Speaker A: Right. That's probably one of the best tweets I've seen and you can guess that that tweet is in my deck.
00:57:19.265 - 00:58:00.041, Speaker C: So the context, the beginning of the year there were these Chinese labs working on replicating thing called LK99. They were thought to have found a room temperature superconductor which is this groundbreaking idea because of this like enormous potential to change every industry. So room temperature superconductor, that comparison is, I just thought, beautifully put. And what it sounds like behind the scenes is that, you know the, it sounds like Stripe was like yeah, should we do it? Should we not? And Patrick Olson just said stablecoins are one of the most important things. They're here to stay. It's a, again a build versus buy conversation.
00:58:00.233 - 00:58:48.667, Speaker A: I've been speaking with the Bridge team because they become important partners, right to implement in the companies that I go and acquire. And it's fascinating what they're doing under the hood. If you're a company that is settling ping internationally, you have employees worldwide, it's like a no brainer. And that's the thing, right? There's this whole universe and part of crypto that people outside of crypto don't appreciate unless you're using it. But very few people are using it because they're distracted in this noise. That crypto is just a casino. But like stable coins and anyone that runs a business understands the amount of friction that they have when they for payment processing, chargebacks.
00:58:48.811 - 00:58:49.659, Speaker C: That's right.
00:58:49.827 - 00:59:20.865, Speaker A: Because payment failure, that alone is like in the hundreds and billions of dollars of friction. That's why I'm doing what I'm doing. Seriously. I am obsessed with removing friction from a system. And as simple as it may sound, it is a huge problem. The thesis is very simple and I'll just leave you with this. This friction cannot go away until and unless you use crypto.
00:59:20.865 - 00:59:59.017, Speaker A: Stripe has built a super successful business to facilitate, you know, payments, APIs and make that back end of payment. Rails are better, cheaper. They've been very successful at it. There's one area where they haven't been able to crack and it's, it's this idea of using the traditional financial rails. It's very expensive. It's an antiquated patchwork. They came to this realization I'm convinced that in order for them to get to the next leg of growth and become continue to be the leader, they needed to use stablecoins because it is faster, better, cheaper.
00:59:59.017 - 01:00:22.625, Speaker A: It removes the friction that they haven't been able to do. And that's honestly that if that's one liner that's like that's the uber super bullish case on crypto. Yeah, that's a more interesting part of it too. It's like we talk about these grandiose ideas. It's like no man, like crypto is really good today. Not in 10 years. Like today it is working.
01:00:22.625 - 01:00:45.529, Speaker A: And I think to your point, everyone now is going to wake up and everyone like they were talking about how profitable tether was. They're not going to say wait a minute, I'm at a very competitive disadvantage because Stripe already is moving this direction and blackrock's already moving this direction. And so I think it's to your point. It's very different than a Starbucks announcing that they're going to NFTs.
01:00:45.617 - 01:00:45.881, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:45.913 - 01:00:49.249, Speaker A: Like it is real for real this time.
01:00:49.337 - 01:01:02.413, Speaker C: Oh real. Yeah. Cool. It's a good place to wrap. Digital Asset Summit just went live. We've got like 30 or 40 speakers confirmed already. Already there's an open call to speakers for the next week that shuts down November 1st.
01:01:02.413 - 01:01:17.333, Speaker C: If you want Your founder or you are a financial institution, you want an exec or a hedge fund and you want to come speak. There's a thing on the website, Google Digital Asset Summit Blockworks 2025. The page should show up. Call to speakers button on the right hand side.
01:01:17.429 - 01:01:18.425, Speaker A: New York, right?
01:01:18.805 - 01:01:29.945, Speaker C: In New York. Yeah, yeah, there's. We have outgrown most of the venues. It is now there's a br. So there's Javits center which is actually just this like massive annoying.
01:01:30.285 - 01:01:32.573, Speaker A: Pick up my marathon number next, next week.
01:01:32.669 - 01:01:44.349, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like a, it's like a really big. It's like honestly like meh. Reputation. But they have this beautiful brand new section of Javits and it's at this, it's at the brand new section of Javits. It's going to be amazing.
01:01:44.477 - 01:02:04.405, Speaker A: Okay, I don't need any convincing. It's in New York, man. Favorite city in the world. So by the way, ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening and you're running the New York Marathon, drop us a comment. I'll be there. Yano's coming out to support me with a huge banner because I'll need it because I've been injured and not running but I'll half ass it and anyways, if anyone wants to run at a pace, drop your pace. Maybe I'll just.
01:02:04.405 - 01:02:08.757, Speaker A: We can do like a run group and like do a, do a nice, nice little marathon run.
01:02:08.901 - 01:02:10.425, Speaker C: What's your, what's your goal?
01:02:11.085 - 01:02:44.733, Speaker A: I'm not going to pr, dude. I did a, with a really good friend of mine, I did the Amsterdam half marathon. I hadn't ran in like three months because I was injured my heel but I feel pretty good because I've been cycling a lot. I think I will realistically run like at a three hours between 3 and 3:30. So obviously not my PR but you know, punchy enough to feel like it was a workout. I mean it's always a workout but also I want to. They're so liberating that I'm not thinking about a time.
01:02:44.733 - 01:02:46.149, Speaker A: There's. The pressure's off.
01:02:46.277 - 01:02:49.625, Speaker C: What's your right, what's, what's the fastest you've ever run a marathon?
01:02:49.945 - 01:03:04.209, Speaker A: 247. 2, 2 hours 47 minutes 18 seconds. London Marathon last year. Then I ran Berlin. 2 hours 47, 36 seconds. Oh damn. In New York was like 2 hour 47, 58 seconds.
01:03:04.209 - 01:03:05.076, Speaker A: That's crazy.
01:03:05.162 - 01:03:05.943, Speaker B: That's nuts.
01:03:06.030 - 01:03:24.735, Speaker A: That's 2 hours 47. I'm not gonna do that this year because I've ran Tokyo, Boston, and I was injured. No excuses. This is gonna be a fun run. So if anyone's down a run, you know, at that sort of pace range, drop me a note. We'll coordinate.
01:03:24.895 - 01:03:27.555, Speaker C: Let's go. What's your. Do you know your bib number yet?
01:03:27.855 - 01:03:30.455, Speaker A: No, I don't, but maybe I can post up. You can follow me.
01:03:30.495 - 01:03:57.985, Speaker C: Just put pressure on everyone. Cool. All right, thanks for listening, everyone. Hope you have a great rest of the Friday, great weekend and we'll see you Tuesday. We have the Kraken episode, Kraken L2 episode coming out on Tuesday. Then the week after, we have a really interesting episode with the head of old head of comms at Solana and the head of the CMO of Celestia, which was like a deep dive into crypto marketing. So subscribe to the show.
01:03:57.985 - 01:03:58.933, Speaker C: Cool.
01:03:59.029 - 01:04:01.037, Speaker A: All right, thanks, everyone. Have a great weekend.
01:04:01.141 - 01:04:02.245, Speaker C: All right, see you, folks.
01:04:02.405 - 01:04:03.145, Speaker A: Bye.
01:04:04.045 - 01:04:23.295, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly thank today's title sponsor, Skale. Skale really is one of the best chain experiences out there today. And I've used so many different chains. There's a reason they are gaining so much adoption in both gaming and AI use cases. Hit the link in the show notes to explore the Skale ecosystem.
