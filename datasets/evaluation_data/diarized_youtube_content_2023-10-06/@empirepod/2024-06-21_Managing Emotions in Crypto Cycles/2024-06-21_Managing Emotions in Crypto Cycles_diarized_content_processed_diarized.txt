00:00:00.480 - 00:00:24.610, Speaker A: A day that you're holding on to something is a day that you're buying. So think about it. Every day that you hold something is a day that you buy that position at that price. Overall, I think you should constantly, maybe not daily, optimize for mental clarity. Whatever you do, pay attention to the things that give you more mental clarity and pay attention to the things that disturb cloud your judgment because this industry is not easy. Markets are not meant to be easy. Otherwise everyone would be making money.

00:02:09.820 - 00:02:14.004, Speaker A: It's been all right, man. We've forgotten about this podcasting thing that we do, but here we are.
00:02:14.132 - 00:02:17.880, Speaker B: Yeah. Looking very european chic today.
00:02:19.020 - 00:02:21.200, Speaker A: Oh, oui, merci, monsieur.
00:02:26.500 - 00:02:30.350, Speaker B: Look, I got a plant. I can see now.
00:02:31.090 - 00:02:35.870, Speaker A: This is a very Covid. You're like baking sour bread dough.
00:02:37.130 - 00:02:46.634, Speaker B: I never. I never fell for that trap. I didn't get sucked into that trap. Oh, dude, I look very pale today. And you look. I look paler than usual. And you look tanner.
00:02:46.634 - 00:02:49.430, Speaker B: The YouTube comments are going to eat me alive.
00:02:51.050 - 00:02:57.014, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I've been. I've been more openly documenting. Why? My workout.
00:02:57.182 - 00:03:00.678, Speaker B: Yeah. So, Philip, Phil said 100 pr.
00:03:00.734 - 00:03:10.010, Speaker A: I was bike yesterday. I did 50k in the bike today. Did 30k running two days ago. Just. Just cooking.
00:03:10.950 - 00:03:22.180, Speaker B: Not too shabby. I hit. I forget if I told you. I think maybe I told you I was trying to hit the 800 club in lifting, which is. What was that?
00:03:22.600 - 00:03:24.980, Speaker A: Pounds? That is for non pounds.
00:03:25.440 - 00:03:26.128, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:26.264 - 00:03:27.472, Speaker A: UK listeners.
00:03:27.536 - 00:03:27.688, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:27.704 - 00:03:28.380, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:29.120 - 00:03:36.540, Speaker B: 800 pounds by end of year. And I hit it this week, actually, so. Yeah, six months early. Dude, the YouTube comments.
00:03:39.120 - 00:03:41.960, Speaker A: Why the hell are these guys talking about, like, training? We'll get to that.
00:03:42.040 - 00:03:54.570, Speaker B: I forget if I read this one in the last. In the last episode. The Yano Santi handsomeness ratio is almost perfectly correlated with etc. Down only for Yano. Let's pray the bottom is in.
00:03:55.630 - 00:03:56.930, Speaker A: Whoever you are.
00:03:58.150 - 00:03:58.910, Speaker B: Salute.
00:03:59.030 - 00:04:00.174, Speaker A: I'll buy you a beer.
00:04:00.302 - 00:04:06.130, Speaker B: Salute. How about this one, Santi? Showing another one of the sweater collections made by grandma.
00:04:06.510 - 00:04:12.638, Speaker A: I did. I collect. I collect a lot of things, by the way, this is, like, my sweater.
00:04:12.814 - 00:04:15.276, Speaker B: Yeah, you do. All right.
00:04:15.398 - 00:04:25.380, Speaker A: I think I have more sweaters than, like, shirts, trousers combined. Five or hundred sweaters.
00:04:25.800 - 00:04:27.620, Speaker B: You don't have a hundred sweaters.
00:04:28.160 - 00:04:28.940, Speaker A: Yes.
00:04:29.560 - 00:04:31.980, Speaker B: Why? You live in a place where it's sunny all the time.
00:04:33.360 - 00:04:37.580, Speaker A: I travel, yes. There's some I haven't used.
00:04:39.160 - 00:04:52.464, Speaker B: Do you do your own shopping? Yeah, I don't know about that. All right, man, what are we talking about today?
00:04:52.512 - 00:05:27.590, Speaker A: So, listen, everyone wants to know what's going on in the market. We've been down the environment since March, April, give or take. No matter how you sliced it, it's been pretty painful for a lot of folks. And if you look at it, like, on a USD pair, it looks ugly. If you look at it on a bitcoin pair, it looks uglier. It's an interesting time in the market because, like, bitcoins at 65.
00:05:27.750 - 00:05:33.206, Speaker B: 65, yeah. 65 peaked out at 71, 72 back in March. 73.
00:05:33.238 - 00:05:50.216, Speaker A: We look at the timeline, and it looks like we're in, like, a post FTX collapse. Like, the world is imploding. Our main character, Ansem, is going through this sort of Archie cult. He's been buried on the time. He's been crucified.
00:05:50.368 - 00:05:53.280, Speaker B: We got a little ansem existential crisis going on.
00:05:53.400 - 00:06:27.922, Speaker A: You would think that it gets easier every cycle, and yes, it does, because you make mistakes. I have a thesis for the cycle, but we're human. Investing is very psychological. It is still painful. It is still, like, you still feel these range of emotions. So anyone out there that is portraying themselves as this stoic character that doesn't feel emotion is just. I'll just, like, it's important, grounded to reality, because you still second guess yourself.
00:06:27.922 - 00:06:36.370, Speaker A: You still wake, like, it's never easy because crypto is a very volatile market, and, yeah, here.
00:06:36.830 - 00:06:47.730, Speaker B: I don't get the aspect of, like, the panic on the timeline, though. I got to be honest. Like, I, like, are just levered to the tits on some of these coins.
00:06:48.710 - 00:06:55.206, Speaker A: You don't have to be levered to the tits. All you have to do is look at your portfolio value, go down 60% in 30 days.
00:06:55.398 - 00:07:17.800, Speaker B: But it's like, I don't know, are you trading around this stuff, though? Like, I know Joseph, our producer, was like, I'd love to hear how you stomach the volatility and your process for decision making. I do want to hear the decision making side, but, like, stomaching the volatility, I'm like, I mean, you just, like, you just don't sell when these things go down 10% unless you do, actually, unless you're always changing.
00:07:18.300 - 00:08:06.428, Speaker A: That's not necessarily true. Right? I mean, it is impossible to one speak. What I'm doing may or may not relate to whatever the listener is doing, because every portfolio is unique, every position is unique, but historically, you have the likes of. By the way, being more smart here doesn't necessarily help. It actually might get in the way. Isaac Newton famously fumbled a bag of tulips he called the bubble, invested in ithood, sold, reinvested like, conveyed early profits, got back into it, imploded, literally, like, died broke. I think Stan Druckenmiller, one of the best investors of all time, got the tech bubble totally wrong.
00:08:06.428 - 00:08:27.488, Speaker A: He was right on the thesis. He was down the timing. He, for such a long time, shorted tech stocks, lost, like, $100 million or whatever was really down, and then unwound the short, closed it, I think, went long. The days, literally, before the top and the bubble popped.
00:08:27.624 - 00:08:28.300, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:29.640 - 00:09:00.679, Speaker A: You have, you know, long term capital management. Like, what I'm trying to say is the common denominator across all of this is a, being smart doesn't necessarily mean you're going to, like, be more equipped to handle volatility. Two, it really hurts when other people are making money and you're not, which is part of the reason. What explains this, that, I think, is the Achilles heel of nine out of ten people, is seeing other people make.
00:09:00.719 - 00:09:03.431, Speaker B: More money than you, great point. I agree with that.
00:09:03.535 - 00:09:49.120, Speaker A: That persists in any market environment. There's people making money in. Aih, if you didn't long Nvidia, you're like, well, shit, I should have just sold all my crypto stuff, not deal with any of this nonsense. It just pumped it in video. And then the third point, which is probably more interesting, that I've been thinking about a lot, is we're all here, we all believe in this stuff long term, but investing is very psychological sport. And when you ask me, you're describing prior cycles. We tend to overfit now because hindsight's 2020, and so the story fits very smoothly in prior cycles.
00:09:49.120 - 00:10:38.802, Speaker A: But I'll just remind people, in any market, bull market, you have these drawdowns of 1020, 30% on major assets, let alone everything that's all and higher beta. So positions being down 60, 70%, does that invalidate the bull market? No, not necessarily. It has also been a very challenging crypto environment where it's like PvP, there's these hot balls of money that move around, and there's some great tweets that we can link in the show notes that actually try to quantify. And I tend to think that we've been sort of in that environment where new, like, we had an influx of flows coming in last year. Q four. Q one. I don't think there's been new flows coming in.
00:10:38.802 - 00:10:45.546, Speaker A: And so we have this constant rotation from french to memes to now something else.
00:10:45.658 - 00:10:47.170, Speaker B: Celeb coins. Yeah.
00:10:47.250 - 00:10:47.870, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:49.130 - 00:11:09.844, Speaker B: So anyways, all right, let me ask. Let me ask you a few. Yeah, YouTube comments are not going to like you on this one. All right, first question here would be, I'm looking at my portfolio and I would categorize it into. Okay, so three. Three buckets of the portfolio. So I've got, like, bitcoin eth.
00:11:09.844 - 00:11:20.520, Speaker B: Solana. Like, I'm just like, I'm holding these things, basically. Um, actually ended up selling a big chunk of one of those for the other, which we can talk about if you're interested. Um, so I've got.
00:11:21.100 - 00:11:24.720, Speaker A: For bitcoin and Ethan, I've gotten.
00:11:24.760 - 00:11:38.336, Speaker B: I'm more overweight. Solana. Yeah. Than the other two. I'm more overweight. Solana. Then I've also got another group of things that I think will do well.
00:11:38.336 - 00:11:56.690, Speaker B: So I've got, like, some AI coins, like a render or a cosh. I've got things. And this is, like, extremely non financial advice. I have no idea what I'm doing. Things like maybe some allocation to the move exposure, whether that's sui or aptos. I've got the AI exposure with a renderer caution. I've got the meme coin exposure with something like wif.
00:11:56.690 - 00:12:26.448, Speaker B: That's like the second part of the portfolio. Then I've got the third part, which I want to ask you about. I've got all these coins that I'm still sitting on from just the last couple of years, things like OG defi tokens or other l one s. And I'm not very excited about them, but I just can't bring myself to sell them. They're not that much money, right? It's not that much. And I'm just like, yeah, it's not a big difference. Like, man, if, like, let me one example might be like, uni or something.
00:12:26.448 - 00:12:52.470, Speaker B: Like, uni is probably not going to, like, outperform Sol here or outperform even maybe bitcoin here, but because it's just like, you know, it just hasn't been a loved token. But I'm like, am I really going to sell uni? And I'd just be curious how you think about that. That third bucket of the portfolio where you're just kind of sitting on these things. Maybe it makes up a small percentage of the portfolio. Yeah.
00:12:55.850 - 00:13:03.390, Speaker A: Are you holding that as a moon bag or to pay attention to the ecosystem or just for tax reasons?
00:13:05.420 - 00:13:30.480, Speaker B: I'm holding it because, honestly, this is going to sound like a really idiotic investment strategy. The idea that if uni something, I'm just going to keep picking on uni. If uni ever ripped, I'd be like, what an idiot I was. Here I am, paying attention to uni, super involved in the community, going to the events, talking to the team, and I sold.
00:13:32.070 - 00:14:15.896, Speaker A: So here's my two things. One, a day that you're holding on to something is a day that you're buying. So think about it. Every day that you hold something is the day that you buy that position at that price. And so overall, I think you should constantly, maybe not daily, but I think you should constantly redraw your portfolio from scratch every so often, quarterly, monthly, annually, however you want to do it. I think it's important, probably shorter cadence in crypto, because things are moving fast. That doesn't mean that you change things.
00:14:15.896 - 00:14:33.786, Speaker A: You just re underwrite. So that's point one. By the way, a lot of Defi tokens are looking pretty good. Like, you look at synthetics, like it's just been like a. They're flat in the month, but they're not as volatile. They're actually, you know, they're just steady. Slowly kind of accumulate.
00:14:33.786 - 00:14:40.378, Speaker A: Like, you know, just. You could tell it's probably, like, a lot of funds accumulating these positions based on, like, charts.
00:14:40.474 - 00:14:44.570, Speaker B: Yeah, uni's up, you know, from four to ten in a year. Like, just slowly going up.
00:14:44.610 - 00:15:29.570, Speaker A: But the second point is probably more important for. For folks is I don't think you construct your portfolio for the upside case. I think you construct it for the downside case. Because if your logic and your reasoning is, I would hate myself if I don't have something, because it didn't outperform the base asset, major asset, whatever your benchmark is, I think you should always be looking to outperform Solana or ETH or bitcoin or all three combined. But I think in this environment, you have to constantly. And I tweet about the CLD. It's like how.
00:15:29.570 - 00:16:01.240, Speaker A: I think risk is one of those things that we try to. It's not very properly understood. Like, most people equate risk to volatility, and it's not the same thing. Analysis could be very volatile. It doesn't make it necessarily riskier. Second, I think, more importantly, I think risk is very subjective. Someone from the outside might say, these goons are just talking about relative risk within crypto, the entire asset class of shitcoin.
00:16:01.240 - 00:16:34.706, Speaker A: Someone that doesn't understand crypto, might look at it as extremely risky. The same like, you might look at biotech as extremely risky. Category like, what do you know about phase one, phase two for a particular drug candidate, nothing. But if you're in the field, then that has way less risk because you're a domain expert. You're living, breathing it constantly. So this is like, the point that I think really kills you is, oh, people making money on meme points. And then you, you like, you're like Isaac Newton, you're like, shit.
00:16:34.706 - 00:16:43.746, Speaker A: People make money into lips. Like, you need. At some point, you just understand at some point it's gonna get to you. At some point you're gonna fall to it.
00:16:43.778 - 00:16:46.106, Speaker B: So you gotta hop on the bike because.
00:16:46.218 - 00:17:15.110, Speaker A: Yeah, no. Well, do you have, like, a small ticket for your sanity? I'm not here to tell you one strategy is better. The other. I think you. My most important takeaway for this episode is optimize for mental clarity. Whatever you do, pay attention to the things that give you more mental clarity, and pay attention to the things that disturb, cloud your judgment, because this industry is not easy. Markets are not meant to be easy.
00:17:15.110 - 00:17:48.790, Speaker A: Otherwise everyone would be making money and so that's the thing that I like. A day like, the last two days haven't been easy. Have been very volatile. Have made me question the portfolio. I've been transitioning for the last month into higher, kind of more defensive, into higher quality stuff and pruning a lot of the portfolio. Is it the best decision? Probably not. I'm probably selling some stuff in there is going to be a hundred bagger, likely.
00:17:48.790 - 00:18:18.700, Speaker A: Probabilistically, is a very, very low probability of that happening. But I just remind myself of the core principle, which is don't lose money. I always want to have money when other people are scared shit and we're not in that environment. And the third one is, I just feel better soon as I do something. Like I'm. I just feel, and I'm nothing. And this is like something that I want to ask you a question.
00:18:18.700 - 00:18:27.124, Speaker A: Like, sometimes, like, okay, investing, that meant to be easy. Like, does that mean that we have to endure all this pain? And, like, not necessarily.
00:18:27.172 - 00:18:27.476, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:27.548 - 00:19:04.276, Speaker A: Like, I stole part of a position yesterday, and I've been thinking about doing it more aggressively over time. I haven't. I did it, and I immediately felt some, like, relief. Famously, Soros got. Every time he wanted to sell, his cue was he got intense back pain. This is funny, but, yeah, I think, anyways, I don't know if any of that makes sense or go and talk more about it, but I'm not here to tell you what or what not to do. If you want to have these buckets, if you want to have a moon bag, ultimately, like, I would just.
00:19:04.276 - 00:19:09.004, Speaker A: Whatever is it that you do, I think optimize for mental clarity.
00:19:09.132 - 00:19:33.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the two takeaways, there are one every day that you're holding something, you're buying it, and to optimize for mental clarity and for sometimes, I mean, we talked about this a couple months ago when I was saying, look, sometimes I'm actually comfortable giving up a little bit of the upside because I'm running block works. And like that, that's where my mental, that's where I spend 98% of my brainpower. Right.
00:19:33.302 - 00:20:26.356, Speaker A: So, yeah, like, yeah, because I think you, you have to get one or two things very, very right. It's sort of a parallel distribution. Crypto liquid, too, and privates. But I think what you just said is so important, can you get yourself comfortable with the idea that you're going to give some of the upside and capture 60, 70, maybe 50% of the return? And if you can underwrite that and be happy with that and build a process around that. I think that if you can compound, then I think you'll be really well in the long run. Yeah, like, okay, it's not 100 x, but if you constantly do three x, like every two, three years, like, yeah.
00:20:26.388 - 00:20:27.484, Speaker B: You'Re good, you're good.
00:20:27.572 - 00:20:41.598, Speaker A: Do the math and you'll do well. The problem, the problem is like concentration. If you can do it in a concentrated manner, then all the better. And that, for that I think you need a lot of mental clarity.
00:20:41.654 - 00:20:51.570, Speaker B: A lot of how many, how many tokens make up, let's say the majority of your portfolio right now, 1010 less.
00:20:52.070 - 00:20:53.774, Speaker A: On the liquid side. Ten.
00:20:53.942 - 00:20:54.430, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:54.510 - 00:20:59.520, Speaker A: On the private side, I have a lot of positions I made of. I make, I'm very active there.
00:21:01.660 - 00:21:04.920, Speaker B: And, yeah, how are the private markets for you right now?
00:21:09.940 - 00:21:12.404, Speaker A: Like what am I seeing or what am I investing or how am I thinking?
00:21:12.452 - 00:21:18.652, Speaker B: Yeah, what are you seeing? Like what kind of valuations, what's happening where, like what ecosystems are you investing in? What kind of companies?
00:21:18.836 - 00:21:42.350, Speaker A: It's cooled down marginally. Like, I'll fire off quick things. Tan ecosystem, a lot of interest. I think it's percolating. So telegram ecosystem is like an outlier. Valuations have subsided a bit. Like, I think they're pausing this pace of like really high vals.
00:21:42.350 - 00:22:13.262, Speaker A: And I think founders getting a little nervous in terms of just closing these routes. So they want to compromise on the price because when price goes down a bit, they're like, hey, well, this is an insurance policy I'd rather just close around. So one company revised down from 75 to 50. And I told them, guys, this is 50 ftv. And they got it done. And I think so, yeah, I still am. Look, my operating assumption is that any investment that I'm making now on the private side is going to be a next cycle kind of thing.
00:22:13.406 - 00:22:31.652, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think we're at that point too. What, uh, so when you see the telegram go going like that, like, how do you think about, uh, buying ton the liquid coin? Did you do the, did you do the discounted private thing? When the time around a couple months.
00:22:31.676 - 00:22:58.150, Speaker A: Ago I got an offer, but, uh, nope, I'm not taking it. I did a lot of the, I actually don't have any exposure to ton. I'm looking at an l two right now, similar to movement, but kind of for time. And the idea is that it's actually quite hard to build on telegram and like, there's a really good tweet about like, this guy went through all of the kind of basic thing telegram. Raton, in the ecosystem, I don't have any exposure to you.
00:22:58.890 - 00:23:00.390, Speaker B: No, no.
00:23:01.530 - 00:23:18.360, Speaker A: I tweeted a poll recently, yesterday, and it was like, you're a builder. Where do you want to build next? And I appreciate, man, because, I mean, you can only sport. Thank you, Elon. So you're a builder. Can you decide?
00:23:18.700 - 00:23:20.748, Speaker B: I was like, oh, my God, how many people just got?
00:23:20.844 - 00:23:47.086, Speaker A: He was like, where is Solana here? Where is insert my bag? We all know where I stand on Solana. Let's list it. Telegraph bearer chain or bitcoin, l two s. And yes, I could list sui. Yeah, whatever basic. This is, the constraint that I had. Telegram came number one at 39%, followed by Aptos 31, barrel chain 18, and bitcoin.
00:23:47.086 - 00:23:51.490, Speaker A: L two is twelve. Yeah.
00:23:52.470 - 00:24:33.044, Speaker B: So, okay, so maybe this is a good time to bring up. So I just spent the last couple hours at Monad's office. So Monad had this thing this week in New York called Monad Foundry, and they brought a bunch of developers in and a bunch of founders, and people gave different talks. And so I was hanging with Yunus, one of the founders, and Keone and Kevin, the CMS intern, turned full time intern of Monad, and I ended up meeting a lot of the founders who are actually building on Monad. So the first takeaway is like, Monad has this actually booming ecosystem right now of people who are building on them already, which is really cool to see because they don't even have, I think, mainnet comes in several months. Actually. We're not too close.
00:24:33.044 - 00:25:14.862, Speaker B: The big takeaway for me is that there's five places, according to all of the founders in the room. So this is kind of self selecting for people who've decided already to build on Monad. Here are the five ecosystems that those folks debated building on Monad. Blast, base, Solana, and Barachainen were the five that got brought up. Probably talked with 1213 different founders, like, different companies building on Monad. They've all chosen Monad, but of the ones that they decided between is base, blast, Monad, Solana, and Barachain. So now you're kind of self selecting.
00:25:14.862 - 00:25:47.370, Speaker B: Like, I'm sure a lot of people are building on something like optimism or arbitrum or polygon or Zksync or whatever it is, but like, this Washington, it's the kind of people who are building on Monad are choosing those companies. So I thought that was really interesting to just hear why they've done it. The TLDR and why they're building on Monad was for them, a lot of them actually came from Solana or debate. It was down to Solana versus Monad. And in their experience, building on Solana was too difficult. It's not about rust versus solidity. It's about something that I'm going to completely botch.
00:25:47.370 - 00:26:02.430, Speaker B: Something about object oriented versus something oriented. I need to understand it better. I'm not going to pretend like I understand it, but they just said it was a little bit too difficult for them. So Monad kind of gives you a lot of what Solana has with, like, bastion, goodchain, but on the EVM. So I thought that was interesting.
00:26:03.810 - 00:26:04.698, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:26:04.874 - 00:26:08.510, Speaker B: You're hiring an analyst? Yeah.
00:26:11.370 - 00:26:12.634, Speaker A: I should just travel.
00:26:12.802 - 00:26:13.826, Speaker B: What'd you say?
00:26:14.018 - 00:26:17.896, Speaker A: I get my best ideas when I travel. This was this idea that.
00:26:17.928 - 00:26:18.928, Speaker B: Were you traveling?
00:26:19.104 - 00:26:21.180, Speaker A: I was traveling. A family office. Spent money.
00:26:21.640 - 00:26:24.020, Speaker B: Nice. How was any. Any takeaways?
00:26:24.520 - 00:26:32.848, Speaker A: I didn't talk about crypto. Like, like, there's like presentations about word invest and like, the room was like family offices from Amia.
00:26:32.944 - 00:26:34.680, Speaker B: So you're there?
00:26:34.840 - 00:26:51.560, Speaker A: Yes. Well, no, they were like, they were like. It was meant catered for, like the young people within the family office. So, like, the sun's up. Yeah. Largest retailer in Spain, you know, like largest real estate developer in Saudi and stuff like this. But I was.
00:26:51.560 - 00:26:58.168, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I guess I would say Gen Zero, which means, like, I was like, so, like, it's my family office. Like, what do you mean?
00:26:58.184 - 00:27:00.616, Speaker B: Like, your dad could be Gen Zero. It's good to be gen Zero.
00:27:00.768 - 00:27:01.488, Speaker A: I'm Gen Zero.
00:27:01.544 - 00:27:01.976, Speaker B: It's like.
00:27:02.048 - 00:27:04.300, Speaker A: And then I was the only crypto person there, probably.
00:27:05.120 - 00:27:06.740, Speaker B: So they didn't mention crypto.
00:27:07.240 - 00:27:22.806, Speaker A: They talk about like AI and like futuristic stuff and I where to allocate and nothing about crypto, although there were a lot of questions from the clients of the bank, talking about asking about, hey, what about crypto?
00:27:22.998 - 00:27:50.874, Speaker B: You're hiring this analyst. You said things he or she would do a manage their own liquid book. I'll give them five hundred k to a million to start, then they grow from there. They get to keep 20% of the profits, they stay on top of teams in the portfolio, and they provide research on emerging trends and ecosystems. I see this as a stepping stone. If they're successful managing their book, I'll help them branch off, launch their own fund or just give them more capital. Looking for someone with experience prior to giving to on chain resume and excellent reference checks.
00:27:50.874 - 00:28:00.882, Speaker B: Walk us through this decision, because this is something that you and I have talked about for I feel like years at this point, you've been thinking about it. Thinking about it. So what made you actually make this decision?
00:28:00.946 - 00:28:50.046, Speaker A: Well, it's just easy. I think it's just like, no different than investing in a yemenite company. But I want to, one, optimize for being surrounded with someone. Or this could be actually, I actually foresee multiple interns or multiple analysts. So, like, I want to have like, a desk starting to. Most likely someone had a great tweet about, like, why just hire two? Which I think is a great idea, but yeah, potentially, like, oversee, like two or three or four, and they just cover certain sectors that I'm not going to pay attention to, and they're going to go deeper, they're going to catch it faster. And I think it's just a realization that there are people far better than me to do this in the liquid side of things, and I want to learn from them purely.
00:28:50.046 - 00:29:17.880, Speaker A: It's just an investment into bringing more brain power, the organization. That's really it. Because the thing I miss the most about being a paraphy is just the const. It's like every day kind of thing. And now I don't do it every day, but I do it like, I have a network that I go to certain people, but it's very ad hoc ish, and I appreciate that. It's probably better to do it more frequently, and the only way to do that is to have someone internally.
00:29:18.380 - 00:29:26.172, Speaker B: All right. Any rules around what they should invest in or free? You're giving them a million bucks and you're saying, go, go make as much money.
00:29:26.276 - 00:29:40.860, Speaker A: My philosophy is I'm not going to hire somebody, tell them what to do. I'm hiring some that are smarter. I'm not going to tell a safant how to make money. Like, follow best practices across risk management and security.
00:29:41.720 - 00:29:45.272, Speaker B: Do they get a salary nominal?
00:29:45.336 - 00:29:46.040, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:29:46.160 - 00:29:46.680, Speaker B: I probably.
00:29:46.720 - 00:29:56.674, Speaker A: This is someone that has already made some money and is looking to just, you know, get involved and maybe have allocation to private deals that I.
00:29:56.682 - 00:30:02.074, Speaker B: Do you have an idea of where this person should come from? Like, should this person, like, no, I.
00:30:02.242 - 00:30:03.550, Speaker A: Don'T care where they come from.
00:30:06.210 - 00:30:13.030, Speaker B: No, I'm like, how many, how many applications do you think you should have? Put a Google form link or something?
00:30:13.850 - 00:30:20.364, Speaker A: No. Part of the process is, can you get to me without me? No, no, that's. It's part of the reason.
00:30:20.532 - 00:30:21.332, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:21.516 - 00:30:24.684, Speaker A: Like, if you really are smart, so.
00:30:24.732 - 00:30:27.380, Speaker B: You'Ll get an intro to you or.
00:30:27.500 - 00:30:30.276, Speaker A: You will find a way. I'm not going to tell you how.
00:30:30.428 - 00:30:36.684, Speaker B: I saw, I saw someone commented and said, where should I apply? And you said, insert here. And I was like, yeah, that's good. Yeah.
00:30:36.812 - 00:30:44.320, Speaker A: I'm like, find me wherever I back companies because they literally tweeted, like commented on a tweet that I had.
00:30:45.270 - 00:31:06.382, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we, I mean, we've, I posted sales jobs before and people are, people dm me and be like, what? Like, uh, or people will comment, be like, where do I apply? I'm like, dude, we got, we got a careers page on our site with the job posted. If you're in sales and you can't figure that out, we got bigger problems. So, okay, who's, who stood out like any other, there were like two or.
00:31:06.406 - 00:31:30.996, Speaker A: Three people that came highly recommend from people that I respect. And they, the way they kind of formatted the doc, what they put in the dock was like, very well formatted, very well organized. Like, I was like, I looked at it for 2 seconds. I'm like, okay, I have a folder now. I'm just putting everything that I like on that folder. And there's a lot of unread stuff in that folder, but I'll get to it this summer.
00:31:31.148 - 00:31:34.596, Speaker B: Yeah, that's cool.
00:31:34.628 - 00:31:35.132, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:35.276 - 00:31:38.038, Speaker B: Look, it's a really good opportunity, I think.
00:31:38.054 - 00:32:11.976, Speaker A: So I like, I think this is, I want to maybe, okay, like, not, not like Julian Robinson. Get us out. I have no way to compare myself to Julian Robinson, but I want to incubate. Like, I've helped start a couple of funds in the space. Like this guy Jason from foliage maple leaf capital. Him and I were like, chatting literally every day about Defi and Defi Summer, to the point where I was like, he was at a hedge fund and he was producing really good research. I'm like, gosh, at one point, we explored hiring him, and then I said, you're too good.
00:32:11.976 - 00:32:44.224, Speaker A: You should go start your own fund. And then I invested in his fund. I'm probably gp clarifying, you know what I mean? Like, we were big supporters, and I kind of want to do that. I think the space deserves better managers. I think they're out there. And so the best part of our crypto is like, it's a space that is like, ever expanding. And I think, like, I look at, like, in any other industry, like, could you make a name for yourself and start a fund in your twenties? Difficult, right? Not impossible, but just difficult.
00:32:44.224 - 00:33:10.510, Speaker A: Of course, in hedge fund land, you make money great. But I think crypto is a different animal, and I think it allows for that. And people that really make do the work and are like, in the trenches, like, get handsomely rewarded. And I appreciate you're not going to be an analyst because you make more money outside. So you have to be your own fund manager. And the structure that I envision is 80 20. Like, you keep, like, you know, you, you, man, effectively I'm an LP.
00:33:10.510 - 00:33:46.252, Speaker A: And then if they're successful, like, yeah, go, you know, go and start your own file. Yeah, and I'll help you do it. I'll part of the GP for sure. And the thesis is that like, if you, like, if I do this for the next five years and I probably maybe have like a program where I bring in one or two people every year or say three or four people and you cut to one or two were successful, like, hey, you know, in five years you have like ten people to start a fund. That's pretty cool. So, yeah, I think that's kind of how I thought about it.
00:33:46.396 - 00:34:19.428, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I've always thought this kind of apprentice, I'd call it an apprentice model, should be more popular. I think it's the biggest career hack that you can make is if I were, if I were 22 or 23, what I would do is I would email the top 50 people or 100 people who I looked up to both in investing or, I mean, for me, I wouldn't do investing. I would do like founders probably. So I'd email the top 50 founders. I'd be like, let me just come work for you. Give me minimum wage or give me whatever it is, give me a highly incentivized compensation structure and let me just come study you for two years.
00:34:19.428 - 00:34:27.092, Speaker B: And then I, with the goal that I want to eventually go launch my own thing, but I just want to learn from you and study you. That's, if I were 22, that's what I would do.
00:34:27.236 - 00:34:36.200, Speaker A: There's like ton of asymmetry, positive asymmetry from like just emailing that and doing that. Yeah, because like, when you're in your thirties. No, it has to be when you're young.
00:34:37.060 - 00:34:55.516, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's the Teal. Like you mentioned Julian Robertson and like, teal fellowship. I think the Teal fellowship came out of like, teal. Peter Thiel would every year have a new, like one or two apprentice. Apprentices. Basically. He's got all this other stuff with young, like he takes the blood of 18 year olds and stuff like that.
00:34:55.516 - 00:35:00.812, Speaker B: But, uh, but it came out of the apprentice model and he's like, this is working so well. Let me just start a whole fellowship around this.
00:35:00.876 - 00:35:15.854, Speaker A: So, you know. Yeah, that's kind of the goal. So, yeah, I think it's someone that, you know, want to. I also don't want to micromanage these people. I was like, you don't strike me.
00:35:15.862 - 00:35:18.050, Speaker B: As a big manager kind of guys.
00:35:19.830 - 00:35:23.478, Speaker A: That I have. I just don't have calls. I don't. I don't like having calls.
00:35:23.614 - 00:35:23.950, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:23.990 - 00:35:33.646, Speaker A: Unless you want to talk to you, I'll talk to you, but it's just like, I want to call some night. Just pick up phone and call. But I don't like these calls. I hate calls, folks. Just, if you want to get to me, chat. I love chat.
00:35:33.798 - 00:35:38.652, Speaker B: Yeah, that's. You're very responsive on telegram. I'm super, like, very responsive.
00:35:38.726 - 00:35:40.256, Speaker A: Yeah, I just hate calls.
00:35:40.288 - 00:35:56.160, Speaker B: They're so, like, yeah, we just implemented no call Wednesdays at blockworks. No, not mandatory. Yeah, no, no calls. So we're hiring a blockwork. So people want to have no calls on Wednesdays. Mandatory. No internal calls.
00:35:56.200 - 00:35:58.176, Speaker A: I'm hiring no calls ever.
00:35:58.328 - 00:36:05.580, Speaker B: Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me. Yeah, I don't even want to talk about funds. Poaching analysts. Sensitive subject right now.
00:36:06.130 - 00:36:07.950, Speaker A: Vloggers is a great organization.
00:36:11.090 - 00:36:18.770, Speaker B: We got permissionless coming. Go buy your ticket. Tickets. Go up to 499 soon. They're 199 today. Go buy your ticket. Just.
00:36:18.890 - 00:36:20.410, Speaker A: Yeah, go buy it.
00:36:20.490 - 00:36:22.018, Speaker B: I just gotta plug it.
00:36:22.194 - 00:36:26.650, Speaker A: Why? Can you explain to me why, like, I love skiing. I think all the snowbird.
00:36:26.810 - 00:36:42.390, Speaker B: I'll explain Salt Lake. I'll explain Salt Lake. I, like, very strongly believe that the best conferences. There are two types of conferences. There are conferences in cities that are, like, built around a city. So, like, we have that with Das, right? Das is in New York and London. It's super easy.
00:36:42.390 - 00:37:06.456, Speaker B: You're working at the fund. You hop over to Das from two to six. Like, it's great for what I'm trying to. What we are trying to build with permissionless. I think there's an element of going to a foreign place that is actually nothing to do, but it's actually crucial to the experience. It gets you out of your comfort zone. You are fully committed.
00:37:06.456 - 00:37:13.528, Speaker B: You're not going bouncing around, really, the city. Like, like our, like, our best event ever was Palm Bead, permissionless, and Palm.
00:37:13.544 - 00:37:15.580, Speaker A: Beach in Salt Lake.
00:37:17.240 - 00:37:18.740, Speaker B: True, true.
00:37:19.520 - 00:37:22.424, Speaker A: You'll find me on hold with drinking fucking cold brew.
00:37:22.552 - 00:37:36.172, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, but, like, I. I mean, there's a big difference between doing, like, a. Like, I don't know, there's. There'll be an event. I mean, like, tokens and Singapore and ECC and Brussels.
00:37:36.172 - 00:37:53.012, Speaker B: Like, we're sending a bunch of people to both of those. Like, I think those are two amazing events. But, like, I think there's a unique thing when you go to a city that there's not, honestly, a crazy amount of stuff to do. And it's a foreign place that, like, a lot of people haven't been to Salt Lake. We're trying it. I think it's. I think it's gonna be really good.
00:37:53.012 - 00:37:59.352, Speaker B: It's shaping up to be the best permissionless ever. It's really interesting to see the delta.
00:37:59.516 - 00:38:02.200, Speaker A: You should get Delta as a sponsor might like. That's like their.
00:38:02.240 - 00:38:09.580, Speaker B: You know, we just got. Actually, you're not a big chess guy, but we just got a chess.com to partner on our. We're building a whole chess lounge. So we've got that.
00:38:11.640 - 00:38:15.552, Speaker A: Three people. Ben. Ben from verify.
00:38:15.736 - 00:38:18.152, Speaker B: How's it going? What's his rate?
00:38:18.336 - 00:38:25.350, Speaker A: I don't know, but he, like, crypto competition. I think he went pretty far. Lesnar, Kane, and Bat are really good.
00:38:25.480 - 00:38:33.790, Speaker B: Oh, shit, I got it. Yeah. So we're gonna have a big chess competition. We're gonna have a pickleball competition, which is gonna be popping, obviously.
00:38:36.090 - 00:38:38.190, Speaker A: I'll do a run club. I want that.
00:38:38.490 - 00:38:41.950, Speaker B: You ever play paddle paddles from? It's like a latin american sport.
00:38:43.450 - 00:38:52.706, Speaker A: I don't consider myself latin american, but yeah, sure. I don't. I have this exercise. I actually don't.
00:38:52.778 - 00:38:54.314, Speaker B: Was that wrong of me to say? What?
00:38:54.442 - 00:39:13.076, Speaker A: No, no, I just. I don't. If I. If anything, I feel identify american because that's the place where I've lived the most culturally too. Although I've been doing a lot of podcasts in Spanish because I saw that one.
00:39:13.108 - 00:39:15.800, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I connected you to that. That guy. Yeah.
00:39:17.060 - 00:39:23.570, Speaker A: Like two or three or more of those. It looks fine. They all do run club, so we can go running solid.
00:39:24.990 - 00:39:54.682, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by say's belief about the world, I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web. Two world agree with that. They also believe that the EVM, in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what Sei has done with their v two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today.
00:39:54.682 - 00:40:30.582, Speaker B: They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest EVM L two s on the market today. Save V two is now live on public Devnet with main net scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with say on X at say Network Sei Network. Big things to say. Hey everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of Empire. Marinade is a staking protocol in Solana.
00:40:30.582 - 00:41:16.412, Speaker B: I remember when they launched, I think it was back at a Solana hackathon and they were funded with this 80K grant. It's super cool to see how far they've come. They're the only stake pool today that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards and automatic downside protection. With their new protected staking rewards, you can stake natively or liquid stake with Marinade and get the same high performance delegation strategy that thousands are using already to stake your soul to over 100 of the best Solana validators. Marinade has been live for over two years and they have audits completed by four of the top security firms in crypto. The delegation strategy is a first of its kind. So if you're staking your Solana, if you want to start staking your Solana, if you want to get some yield from your soul, start staking today with marinade.
00:41:16.412 - 00:41:49.388, Speaker B: Go hit the link in the show notes. Big thanks to Marinade for everything that they've done in Solana staking land. Go check them out. Go stake your Solana with Marinade today. This episode is brought to you by Avalanche. Avalanche is a leading network of blockchains, giving some of the world's largest financial institutions the design space to explore new use cases and business models while leveraging completely customizable infrastructure. Everything that Avalanche has been building the last few years has culminated in this moment where today you have institutions and developers able to essentially have limitless possibilities with the chain.
00:41:49.388 - 00:42:27.388, Speaker B: They've enabled developers to build cross chain swaps or create gaming environments where one subnet can unlock features in another or can use USDC as a native gas token.

Big thanks to Avalanche for sponsoring this episode of Empire. Go explore Avalanche Subnet ecosystem at core Dot app Discover that's core core dot app Discover thanks again Avalanche. This episode is brought to you by Mantle. Mantle is an l two, backed by one of the industry's largest treasuries.
00:42:27.388 - 00:42:50.190, Speaker B: At the time of recording, it's valued at $4.4 billion. The mantle ecosystem engages in a lot of early stage exciting projects, such as Athena and Eigen Lair, and they give out, actually, the rewards to the mantle community. There are two airdrops I want to tell you about. The first one, it was with Athena. They offered 2.5 billion Athena shards to holders of their native token MNT.
00:42:50.190 - 00:43:17.800, Speaker B: So the rewards station program distributes these pre sale token allocations to MNT holders who stake the tokens. The second one they have going on is with Myso. My. So that gives out over 90,000 Myso tokens worth about $50,000 today. That starts on April 25, runs through May 2. If you want to check that out, you got to stake your MNT, and you can check out the reward station at Mantle XYZ rewardstation. Big thanks to mantle for sponsoring empire.
00:43:17.800 - 00:43:43.040, Speaker B: All right, I have another thing to talk about. It feels like there's a, like a momentum or a narrative change or a zeitgeist changed, where people are just sick of the bullshit, like, sick of the. Sick of the airdrops, sick of the, like, over investment into infrastructure. I just feel. I feel it in the. In the air that something's changing. And I'm curious if you feel, like, sick of the.
00:43:43.040 - 00:44:01.960, Speaker B: Sick of the stupid shit. I'm not saying airdrops are actually stupid. I'm not saying, obviously, infrastructure stupid, but I'm just like, I just feel like the. Amongst the crypto natives and amongst, like, the crowd that matters, people are, like, acknowledging, like, you know what? I think something does need to change. Do you feel that?
00:44:02.820 - 00:44:29.730, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, like, marginally, yes. I mean, I think there's obviously that chatter of high FTV, low, low flow. That discussion wouldn't be happening if tokens were going up, not down. But nonetheless, there's also, like, very limited design space. Of course, Kobe's ICO idea is really good challenge in the current environment. We've talked about this at nauseum here.
00:44:29.730 - 00:44:55.596, Speaker A: So it's sort of like, yeah, we can talk and bitch and complain about things, but work within the constraints you have. I have optimistic. I'm optimistic because crypto has become. The thing that surprised me the most is speaking truly about site guys. Just crypto's become presidential. Like, holy shit. And, like, now Trump is really, like, now being very vocal about it.
00:44:55.596 - 00:45:15.840, Speaker A: Is he going to actually implement it? Like, fall through if he gets elected, which I think he will dvd. But look, I think it's important nonetheless. I think it's a win for the space. The courts have ruled in crypto's favor. The SEC just dropped their investigation into ethos security today. Again, these are the things that are happening in real time. People looking at prices down 20%.
00:45:15.840 - 00:46:02.546, Speaker A: But you have these type of very important events to go unnoticed. And we're going to look back in two years time and say what defined this cycle? It was ETF's that opened the floodgates. It was a regulatory change, a political change in the most important country, the most important market changing, probably 180, you know what I mean? Like in a very short period of time. Does that mean that we're going to have regulation tomorrow? No, but markets respond to that pivot, not the actual implementation of the regulation. Now I appreciate like if we want to try to icos and all this stuff, like we're going to have to need like clear rules. But, but that sets in motion today. More interest, more pilots, more, you know what I mean? Like people that have been on the sidelines, like so I think it matters.
00:46:02.546 - 00:46:28.540, Speaker A: And so like I just would caution people like not to get too caught up in the movement, day to day movement of stuff. And just like I think there have been really important stuff happening. The psyche is that I think airdrops, I have my reservations. I think airdrops have peaked. 41% of people like dumped the ZK, what is it? The ZK sync token immediately.
00:46:28.700 - 00:46:48.440, Speaker B: Common common knowledge, the layer zero one. Just, I mean by the time this is published, the layer zero, we're recording this on Wednesday. We have to record it early. Layer zero is tomorrow, so Thursday. This releases on Friday. So that'll, that'll happen. By now I could see the layer zero one because they've put in so much freaking work.
00:46:48.440 - 00:46:54.620, Speaker B: I could see it being one of the, like actually I could see it being the last big one that's done in this type of way.
00:46:56.040 - 00:46:56.856, Speaker A: I like this.
00:46:56.928 - 00:47:00.256, Speaker B: I mean actually that's not going to happen. Nevermind. There's going to be more after that.
00:47:00.288 - 00:47:47.060, Speaker A: But the thing that matters most is like when we think about airdrops, I think we can on the margin be just more judicious of your team of who you actually give tokens to, whether they want to dump it or not. No, but at least give tokens to someone that has put in meaningful work. They provided liquidity, traded, improved your KPI's in some way, shape or form go at it. If they have done some softer stuff, less tangible, maybe not. Maybe keep that in the treasury because you're going to need it in five years time. I don't know, it's difficult. But the thing that was actually rather interesting is Ando did not airdrop.
00:47:49.040 - 00:47:50.192, Speaker B: I don't think there was an Ondo.
00:47:50.216 - 00:48:12.842, Speaker A: Airdrop, and they're trading. And the tokens done fairly well. Celestial airdrop tokens done fairly well. There's a lot of noise when you think about price in a six month period. That has been very choppy. So it's difficult to make these conclusions that an airdrop was wrong and it led to all this price collapse. I was actually on a panel of sorts organized by movement.
00:48:12.842 - 00:48:28.772, Speaker A: Haseed was there, Reagan from lattice was there, rushy, of course, was there, and Smokey from Baruchain was there. Yeah. Like, they were talking about that stuff and. Yeah. Can we do ICOs and Kobe's ideas? Great. Yeah, we all agree that. And so what? Like, we can't do that today.
00:48:28.772 - 00:49:07.542, Speaker A: So what do we do? I think the most important thing is actually liquidity. People should go listen to that market maker episode that we had with Jenny from Wintermute and the second lane guys. Yeah. The most important thing is to have liquidity out of the gate, because also, I think people look at the spike, right? There's all these projects of this burnt khalifa because there's low liquidity. Now, what if you had some sort of bonding curve mechanism where you have better price discovery? That's kind of Kobe's thing. I hope that. But that, I think, is a solution.
00:49:07.542 - 00:50:07.156, Speaker A: If you have good liquidity out of the gate, you can absorb the dump, and it's a smoother, orderly shift of who wants to have these tokens. Also, here's an idea out of the blue. So if you're in the US, in some of these jurisdictions, claiming the airdrop has tax implications, sometimes you don't want to claim it immediately. Now, maybe it doesn't matter because you're in June and whatever, but what if you could elect to, like, not receive the airdrop, transfer it, give it back? Or just like, can we make airdrops more fungible in the sense of, like, can a project give menu of options to people? Like, get an allocation, claim it today, and it's worth so much. Claim it in a year. It's so much. Claim it in three years.
00:50:07.156 - 00:50:31.500, Speaker A: So much. Or however you want to do it, or like, do these things, like. Like do tasks on chain and then that, like, unlocks or. I don't know, but what I'm trying to say is, that's the other thing. Like, I feel like, can we get to a spot? Or would it be nice to, like, as a recipient of the airdrop, to have a menu of options? Because right now you're not presented with menu options, like claim or not claim.
00:50:31.620 - 00:50:32.210, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:32.340 - 00:51:02.702, Speaker A: And the process there most likely is, I'm not claiming sell this a lot of money or whatever. Well, I'm not going to claim because it has huge tax implication and I want it to be taxable and I'm going to wait till January or whatever. But would it be maybe for you, like, would it be nice to have a menu of options, which is. I don't know. I don't know what those options would be. I can think of a few, but I don't know. It doesn't, it doesn't liquidity, it doesn't improve the low flow.
00:51:02.702 - 00:51:08.918, Speaker A: I think a lot of times you would just want to increase the flow and that the easiest way to do that is just, you know, give a very healthy airdrop.
00:51:09.054 - 00:51:09.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:09.654 - 00:51:17.414, Speaker A: Recently had this discussion with the project that, like, was like, determining what percentage of the token supply is going to go to the community. I'm like, why?
00:51:17.542 - 00:51:18.210, Speaker B: Why?
00:51:19.670 - 00:51:30.760, Speaker A: Like, no, like, how much are you keeping for yourself? You realize you wouldn't be building this, right? And I go, oh, yeah, well, you know, the good point. I'm like, no, like, you should own more of it.
00:51:30.920 - 00:52:09.356, Speaker B: But yeah, yeah, you missed this podcast on Monday or Tuesday, but we had Regan and Mike from Lattice on the pod, and it was really, it was the whole podcast. We chatted for like an hour about just like airdrops and to, like, releasing tokens to the community and why you should even do it. And Mark, what's wrong with market structure? And it was all about this really good episode coming out soon. A trend I'm starting to see is in the same way. There's been these Kol rounds last year. They're starting to be liquidity rounds, where the only people who can access the rounds at these discounted prices are people who can bring liquidity. You started seeing this.
00:52:09.548 - 00:52:11.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good idea.
00:52:11.620 - 00:52:12.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:12.500 - 00:52:21.790, Speaker A: Liquidity mining worked beautifully. Yeah. People dump tokens, whatever. Yeah. Like, you know, you had compound and hobby get meaningful liquidity and like, yeah.
00:52:25.690 - 00:52:29.650, Speaker B: All right, dude. That's all. That's all I got. I went to the Coinbase event, but that was last. Oh, yeah.
00:52:29.730 - 00:52:40.350, Speaker A: By the way, fantastic thread. Fantastic. Can you, can you summarize, like, for people that didn't see it, what the takeaways were? I mean, we'll link it, the thread, because people should go read it.
00:52:41.900 - 00:52:42.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:44.260 - 00:52:46.720, Speaker A: Three things that you price the most, your top five.
00:52:48.460 - 00:53:02.164, Speaker B: Okay, first. Okay, so it was really good. There were 600 people. It was 600 people at this Coinbase just to like, set the stage. 600 people. State of crypto summit by Coinbase. It was like this invite only event.
00:53:02.164 - 00:53:38.420, Speaker B: A lot of institutional folks, policymakers, founders, three takeaways. Okay, first takeaway was the CIO of the ETF business at Blackrock, and then Cathie Wood both said the same stat, which was about ETF flows, and the number is 80%. And the 80% number is really important because the narrative on Twitter is that ETF's are here, institutions are here. They both made the argument. They said, look, we have all the data. The institutions are not here. 80% of people buying these ETF's are self directed people inside of their own brokerages, otherwise known as retail.
00:53:38.420 - 00:53:59.616, Speaker B: So it's self directed. Yeah, self directed inside of their own brokerages accounts. It's like. It's like your dad buying in his fidelity account. And that's really, really interesting. Right? Because I think there was, what, 12 billion of flows in three months or so, something like that. I might be getting that number wildly off.
00:53:59.616 - 00:54:00.740, Speaker B: Let's call it.
00:54:02.930 - 00:54:07.970, Speaker A: Most of the money wealth is in Raas and hedge funds and institutions.
00:54:08.090 - 00:54:30.490, Speaker B: Yeah. So Ras control 40% of the wealth in America, and most of the flows have been. It's not any of the big players buying this. 80% of the capital has been self directed. So that was the first big 1. Second big one was Brian talking about the Coinbase strategy. He said, let me see if I can get a quote.
00:54:30.490 - 00:54:57.658, Speaker B: Actually, I don't need to quote this, but he said, look, there are someone. Kathy and him did a fireside chat, and Kathy said, brian, what are you most excited about right now? He said, look, there are three things, or four things I'm thinking about at the company. One most exciting thing by far is base. The most important thing at Coinbase is base. Numbers two and three are our derivatives business and then our smart wallet. So you got base at the top, then you've got the derivatives business and the smart wallet, which makes onboarding much easier. And then he said, fourth is we're pushing international.
00:54:57.658 - 00:55:29.812, Speaker B: So today. So the last piece of the puzzle for us is international. 17% of Coinbase's revenue today is international. It's the first time, first quarter where international has grown faster than us was q one. And so what they've just done internally, he was very transparent. He shared a lot about the strategy of the company. He said, they just picked ten markets where they're calling them the go deep markets, and they're almost going to blitz these markets like Uber blitzed markets and just like really try to take over.
00:55:29.812 - 00:55:55.396, Speaker B: Because if you look at, you can actually look at similar web for some of this data. Coinbase has like 90% of the market share in the US of exchanges, in terms of like page, just in terms of page views and traffic and stuff like that. And even in terms of volume, they usually sit around 70% of us volumes. But international, they're like minuscule. They're very, very small in international markets. And so they're about to blitz the hell out of these ten markets. So that's really interesting.
00:55:55.396 - 00:56:24.950, Speaker B: And that's interesting because Coinbase is obviously one of the biggest companies, but it has trickle down effects. Right? It starts to impact maybe how Kraken thinks about their business and how circle thinks about their business. So that was interesting. He said, one other quote was, centralized exchanges will be great for a bit, but they're just a moment in time. Eventually it's all going to be peer to peer with no intermediaries and all on chain. And it's just a pretty remarkable quote, I'd say, from the CEO of the biggest us crypto exchange.
00:56:25.930 - 00:56:30.506, Speaker A: His willingness, the willingness of Coinbase to reinvent their business model is impressive.
00:56:30.698 - 00:56:44.426, Speaker B: It's amazing. Yeah. Then the third takeaway was the summit last year. I think last year was the first year they had it. It was all infrastructure. It was l two s, it was base, it was infrastructure. This year, there were truly zero conversations about infrastructure.
00:56:44.426 - 00:56:48.530, Speaker B: It was all about apps and payments and usage.
00:56:51.870 - 00:56:55.410, Speaker A: Its moment. Right. What is it? Tip link in Solana.
00:56:56.270 - 00:57:12.632, Speaker B: I just feel like, I feel it in my gut. We're on the precipice of like an actual move into. I think I'm six months early here, but like an actual move into consumer. I think there's gonna be new marketplaces. I mean, we had Geonet on the pod and like, man, I was listening.
00:57:12.656 - 00:57:25.176, Speaker A: To that being like, payments deepen AI. AI is later, but payments and deepen a is related because a lot of, a lot of activity on chain will be by agents, not humans.
00:57:25.288 - 00:57:41.242, Speaker B: I think that's a next cycle. I think that's. I think that's going to be a next cycle thing. But like deepen improvements. Yeah, yeah. It's just, I remember this experience I had the first time I ever made a uniswap transaction. And it was just so like, like, just click right.
00:57:41.242 - 00:57:54.986, Speaker B: It was like, the financial system will work this way. I don't know how long it takes, but eventually the financial system will run on DeFi rails. I'm starting to have that for the first time since that experience. I'm starting to have that with deep in a little bit. Or I'm just like, man.
00:57:55.018 - 00:58:22.862, Speaker A: Like, the thing about uniswap is not so much like, it's something it's harder to appreciate, right? Because people was like, yeah, obviously this whole robinhood works. The reality is, no, like, you have to explain it. I'm counterparty risk and all this stuff. And, you know, and then more sophisticated people, like, well, you know, a centralized order book model is bigger than am. And you get into this, like, you know what I mean? Deepen is, like, so concrete. Like, you want a data. Yeah, it's a fraction of the cost, has better coverage.
00:58:22.862 - 00:58:40.320, Speaker A: How about that? Zero. That's it. End of conversation. Like, yeah, so it's so in your face, so tangible. And. And also, I think bootstrapping networks is super capital intensive. And I guess it was a bit of an oversight.
00:58:40.320 - 00:59:10.106, Speaker A: But think about the minor, the hash rate, that alone, the willingness of people to bootstrap this incredible network that is everywhere, that people expend capex out of their own pocket, millions, billions of dollars, right. To mine something that they had, think has value. Like, compare that to, like, trying to bootstrap that network in a traditional way. One company raising money, venture money, it's super hard, right?
00:59:10.218 - 00:59:10.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:10.890 - 00:59:44.696, Speaker A: The challenge with geo net and deep end networks is, by the way, no deep end network trades above a billion. Not hivemapper, not Geonet. I think Mark is kind of sleeping on it. I think that the challenge, the market is not entirely wrong. The challenge will be the modernization aspect, how you actually can. Because when people like cellular tower, look at american tower, hugely prints. Why look at mobile networks, they make a ton, a ton of money can deepen networks, translate coverage to revenue.
00:59:44.696 - 00:59:47.088, Speaker A: That's the thing that I look at.
00:59:47.104 - 00:59:50.552, Speaker B: The supply side, you can incentivize the supply side, but can you actually get.
00:59:50.576 - 01:00:38.118, Speaker A: The demand side to buy the demand side? I think is there is more. So the modernization aspect, the geo net, like, has mapped and has coverage for gps location data far more than, like, web two companies. Web two companies make orders meant to more money. So at what point, and that's a question I forgot to ask, Mike, but at what point can you start showing translation of you have all this coverage? How do you monetize? No, I think I. I think if the product is very good, the coverage is very good, the reliability is very good, the hardware is up the par, then there's really no reason why you shouldn't be able to charge maybe exactly the same or a slight discount because you have less overhead. Right. As an organization.
01:00:38.118 - 01:00:59.040, Speaker A: So you should, presumably the market should set that price. But anyways, that's the thing. Like, look at file con revenue Dropbox in box. You know what I mean? These are the comparisons that I think I'd like to bring in maybe more discussion to this at a later time. But that's the thing that I'm just, that's, I think what we'll unlock deepen more so from like a market standpoint. Right?
01:00:59.200 - 01:01:16.280, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyways, good coinbase event. Oh, also Blackrock CIO said, look, we used to think these networks would be wed end up going on chain, but it'd be in these permissioned networks. Now we're 100% convinced it's going to be in permissionless networks. That was cool. Okay. Unfolding right now, there's this Kraken hack.
01:01:16.280 - 01:01:51.444, Speaker B: You seen this? Yeah. Okay, so let me, I mean, I'm doing this in real time, so bear with me, but. So Sirtik posted. Certik posted, we found a series of critical vulnerabilities in Kraken's exchange, which could potentially lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, starting from a finding in Kraken deposit system, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I'm not gonna read the whole thing. We can link in the show notes, but basically Certik posted that they'd found a vulnerability, and they posted like the whole timeline. And they said, in the spirit of transparency and our commitment to the web3 community, we're going to public to protect all users security, et cetera, et cetera.
01:01:51.444 - 01:02:01.920, Speaker B: So then the CSO of Kraken, Nick per coke, per Coco, who's widely known as like, being the best CSO.
01:02:02.780 - 01:02:04.284, Speaker A: Kraken's dirty is.
01:02:04.452 - 01:02:22.796, Speaker B: He's like, he's like the guy. He's the guy. Yeah, he's like the guy. So anyways, he posts, he goes cracking security update. On June 9, we received a bug bounty program alert from a security researcher. No specifics were disclosed, but their email claimed to find an extremely critical bug. He says what I know to be true as well.
01:02:22.796 - 01:02:37.210, Speaker B: Every day we receive fake bug bunnies. They get it, I'm sure, ten times more than we do, 100 times more, but we get that every day. Found a bug in blockworks. I'm going to change the whole website. You can't take everything seriously, he said. But look, we did. We assembled a cross functional team to dig into the issue.
01:02:37.210 - 01:03:05.574, Speaker B: Within minutes, we discovered an isolated bug. This allowed a malicious attacker to initiate a deposit onto our platform and receive funds in their account. To be clear, no clients assets were at risk, et cetera, et cetera. We triaged the vulnerability as critical. Within an hour and 47 minutes, we'd mitigated the issue. Here's where it gets interesting, though. The individual discovered the bug in our funding system and leveraged it to credit their account with forward with 4 million.
01:03:05.574 - 01:03:37.174, Speaker B: And with $4 in crypto, this would have been sufficient to prove the flaw, file a bug bounty report with our team, and collect a very sizable reward under the terms of the program. Instead, the security researcher disclosed this bug to two other individuals who they work with, who fraudulently generated much larger sums. They ultimately withdrew nearly $3 million from Kraken, from their Kraken accounts. This was from Kraken's treasuries, not client accounts. And this is completely backfired on Certik. Let me just read some of these tweets. Certik are absolute clowns.
01:03:37.174 - 01:03:50.542, Speaker B: Deserve to be banished from the industry. I will never do business with them. I would never hire their current employees. Next up, too bad there isn't a way to short sir tick. Step one, steal cracking funds. Step two, fail. Fail to report security flaw for three days.
01:03:50.542 - 01:04:17.890, Speaker B: Step three, brag about exploit to other researchers. Step four, researchers repeat the exploit and tornado cash the funds. Step five, go on crypto Twitter and pretend to be white hat and martyrs. So this seems to be really backfiring on uncertic. I haven't fully dug into it, but I was actually at blockwork spears. Some folks were speaking not so elegantly or friendly about Certik. So, yeah, this seems to have really backfired.
01:04:17.890 - 01:04:39.414, Speaker B: But it'll be interesting to see this develop because I think Certik is the biggest smart contracting auditing firm in crypto today in terms of just size of company and revenue, not in terms of spear. Bit like spear bits. Amazing. And there are other folks of very good reputations, but I'm pretty sure Certik is the largest by size. Yeah.
01:04:39.462 - 01:04:42.690, Speaker A: I don't think that's, like, the best metric, but, yes, I think you're right.
01:04:43.230 - 01:04:50.070, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, they've, I mean, just in terms of, they've raised like $300 million. They're just a largest.
01:04:50.110 - 01:04:53.314, Speaker A: Yeah, they're like, ey, Deloitte.
01:04:53.442 - 01:04:59.230, Speaker B: Yeah, they raised from Softbank Tiger. They've raised 290 million. Like, they're big, big over them. So.
01:04:59.610 - 01:05:00.390, Speaker A: Wow.
01:05:01.290 - 01:05:03.298, Speaker B: Anyways, I don't want to end on a bad note.
01:05:03.434 - 01:05:04.110, Speaker A: No.
01:05:05.090 - 01:05:20.796, Speaker B: I had lunch with Rich Woodman, head of crypto strategy at Google. Google is taking crypto very seriously, I would say. I think everyone's sleeping on that. Really interesting. They've got a. Quite a large crypto team. They've got three fully developed products.
01:05:20.796 - 01:05:28.052, Speaker B: And I think we'll actually see Google push pretty deeply into be more public about what they're doing in crypto. So that was cool.
01:05:28.196 - 01:05:29.436, Speaker A: I saw that, too.
01:05:29.588 - 01:05:33.640, Speaker B: Yeah. What else?
01:05:34.940 - 01:05:38.636, Speaker A: Been reading a lot. Physical kindle. Amazing.
01:05:38.828 - 01:05:39.880, Speaker B: What are you reading?
01:05:41.100 - 01:06:02.128, Speaker A: Read a lot of the stuff that people posted on that thread. Uh, the, uh. Who was it? Uh, someone recommended. Oh, Robbie from immutable. Said, read ten x is easier than two x. That was a really good book. Like, the title seems like I don't want.
01:06:02.144 - 01:06:09.060, Speaker B: This is the idea that, like, it's actually hard. It's. I could imagine what that story's about.
01:06:10.610 - 01:06:13.190, Speaker A: And then, yeah, it's been reading a lot.
01:06:16.650 - 01:06:26.258, Speaker B: I have the best AI thing I think you'll ever read, or. That's a ridiculous statement. The best AI thing that you've. That I have ever read.
01:06:26.434 - 01:06:26.802, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:26.826 - 01:06:56.020, Speaker B: It's called situational awareness the decade ahead. It's about 150 pages long by Leopold Aschenbrenner. I have a series of essays about this guy's inside look into the AI industry. I've been. I'm on hour five of reading this thing. It's still not done, so it's taken me a while. I'm a slow reader, but it's really, really, really good.
01:06:56.920 - 01:07:00.398, Speaker A: Nice. I like that. I'm gonna. I'm gonna pick it up for you this weekend.
01:07:00.544 - 01:07:01.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:04.250 - 01:07:10.746, Speaker A: I'm going to try to lift whatever. Whatever it is. Can you send me these stats? And then I'll report back. Whoever the listener.
01:07:10.858 - 01:07:16.218, Speaker B: You can't lift. I just, like, I can't run, dude.
01:07:16.274 - 01:07:17.950, Speaker A: What makes you think that I can't live?
01:07:19.250 - 01:07:36.720, Speaker B: I just. I just got a feeling. I don't think you got that dog in you. Listen, listen, listen.
01:07:36.840 - 01:07:47.296, Speaker A: You put a frack at permissionless. People do fights. Let's do a hit. Put this way. Put a gym in the corner of permissionless instead of a stupid boo.
01:07:47.328 - 01:07:49.096, Speaker B: That's actually a great idea.
01:07:49.248 - 01:08:01.622, Speaker A: Let's pump because I will out pump the shit out of you, dude. I'm going on the record. I will. Eight oh five. Those are rookie numbers.

01:08:04.886 - 01:08:09.886, Speaker A: Wow. Waffle Wall street. Those are rookie numbers.
01:08:09.918 - 01:08:11.934, Speaker B: You got rookie numbers. Pump them up.
01:08:12.102 - 01:08:22.600, Speaker A: I'm permissionless. It's going to go down. I will lift more than you. Whatever combination the three disciplines you want, you've vastly underestimated.
01:08:22.640 - 01:08:35.352, Speaker B: Wow. Wow. Oh, yeah. Listening to this, being like, Ronnie.
01:08:35.456 - 01:08:36.984, Speaker A: I'm going Ronnie Coleman.
01:08:37.112 - 01:08:45.900, Speaker B: Being like, are you fucking kidding me? We have to put a gym on the floor. Permissionless. All right, let's go.

01:08:57.130 - 01:09:05.082, Speaker A: Whatever. Toli lifts is the price target. I'm still on cycle. That's nice.
