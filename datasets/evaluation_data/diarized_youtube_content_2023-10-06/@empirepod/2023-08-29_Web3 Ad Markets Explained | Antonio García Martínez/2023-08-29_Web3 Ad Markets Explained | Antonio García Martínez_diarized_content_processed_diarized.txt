00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.574, Speaker A: This thing called MTA. If you want multi touch attribution, what that means is if I hear about a thing on your podcast, I Google search for the thing, but I don't convert. And then I see a twitter ad and I finally convert. Guess what? All those three touch points contributed to that user converting. It's not the case that Twitter alone or the Google search alone contributed to that. Everybody, frankly, should get a share of that upside of whatever that is. In web two, it would have been impossible to engineer.
00:00:22.574 - 00:00:24.034, Speaker A: Literally, there was no way to do it.
00:00:25.594 - 00:01:10.506, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, before we get into today's episode, I want to take a second to acknowledge Vouch. With over 4000 startups insured from napkin sketch ideas to large ipos, vouch is the insurer of choice for crypto companies, including L one, s, L two s, daos, protocols, and a whole lot more. Their exclusive coverages are enhanced for crypto, covering everything from regulatory defense to smart contract vulnerabilities. With vouch, you are not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind so you can keep on building. You'll hear more about vouch later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to Empire. We have Antonio Garcia Martinez, whole bunch of who's done a whole bunch of things on the show, which I will describe in a second.
00:01:10.506 - 00:01:13.414, Speaker B: But Antonio, man, welcome. Welcome to Empire. Good to have you.
00:01:14.154 - 00:01:15.826, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. Looking forward to this.
00:01:15.930 - 00:01:47.006, Speaker B: Yeah, I was thinking about your bio leading into this, which is why I kind of, like, jumbled over that first part. But I was like, do I describe him as a journalist? Do I describe him as, like, a founder? Do I describe him as, like, the first PM for ad targeting at Facebook? Do I describe him? But I think the way I want to describe you is like, I don't know. I think you've written the best ever book on ad tech, which was chaos monkeys. And I remember reading it when we launched Blockworks 2017, moving into 2018, like, trying to figure out the ad market and how it really worked, and there really weren't many books out there, so I remember reading chaos monkeys, and it helped a lot.
00:01:47.030 - 00:01:57.612, Speaker A: So, you know, it's funny, you're not the only person to say that, and I often say it's easy to be superlative when you have no competition. So, yes, it's both the best and the only book on ads written in the best in yours.
00:01:57.668 - 00:02:28.376, Speaker B: There you go, man. So I wanted to have you on because I would like to make this, like, the definitive episode on when someone is trying to figure out what the ad markets could look like in crypto. I'd like to make this like the episode that folks send to people. And the reason that I want to do this now is the last episode we just did was on Friendtech. And I'm sure you've seen Friendtech, and I'm sure you've seen, I think, kind of the social token narratives coming back, which also, as that happens, you start to get, like, the web three. Social narrative comes back. And that brings into question the business model of web three, social.
00:02:28.376 - 00:02:50.704, Speaker B: Right. And obviously, the business model of web two is advertising. And so I want to. I think the most helpful place to start is with your background, actually. Right. You started this ad tech company, you sold it to Twitter, you then joined Facebook, became the first product manager for, like, the Facebook ad targeting platform. So why don't we start there? If you could just share that story.
00:02:50.704 - 00:02:54.624, Speaker B: And then we can move into, like, how web two ads work, and then we can move into web three.
00:02:55.244 - 00:03:24.604, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So in the midst of ancient history, in 2010, just down the street from where I currently am in San Francisco Soma district, I had a YC company in 2010. It was kind of focused on small businesses and ad tech. And as you said, yeah, it was what was then used to be politely called an acqui hire, which what it meant was the company was basically acquiring the, you know, the brainpower of the actual employees. Maybe there's a small premium, but basically it was just like a juicy job offer. And you could claim you sold your company.
00:03:24.604 - 00:04:14.726, Speaker A: Not usually a huge success, to be honest, which agrock wasn't, but it was interesting product. And as you said, I landed in Facebook in, like, early 2011, still a year away from the IPO, and still when Facebook's ad system, frankly, didn't work, one of the more shocking things I did when I got to Facebook, it's a scene in my memoir about a chaos monkeys. I go into the dashboards to look at what's called CPM. So, CPM, for those who want to know about ads, cost per mill mil, a fancy italian or latin word. I'm not sure why ad tech is using it, but basically, the cost per thousand ad impressions, it's basically the cost per square foot of web inventory. And it's how every website from Facebook to the New York Times basically quantifies what it's worth. When you load the page and it shows you some form of sponsored content, how much does the cash register rate? And so I'd go to the dashboards, and the cpms are something like $0.17
00:04:14.726 - 00:04:38.998, Speaker A: which is very low, comparable to the ads that you'd see on, like, blogs at the time. This thing called adsense, to give you a figure of merit. Cpms on Instagram's newsfeed, which are very successful ads are more like $8910. So Facebook's monetization has basically increased two orders of magnitude in the past ten plus years. And so, obviously, the ad system's gotten a lot better. But at the time, it basically didn't work. And I'd like to claim that, like, merit got me.
00:04:38.998 - 00:04:45.908, Speaker A: There was basically happenstance that had me land sketching out the targeting roadmap for Facebook in 2011.
00:04:46.076 - 00:04:47.704, Speaker B: So why didn't the ads work?
00:04:48.524 - 00:05:09.940, Speaker A: Well, a, they were very small. There were no newsfeed ads at the time. There were these tiny little postage stamp things on the right hand side that were basically really crappy. The targeting didn't work. Basically, you would target likes and interests, which you can still do inside Facebook, and basically was the page likes. If you had liked BMW, you'd be part of the BMW targeting group. The first product we shipped, ooh, big innovation.
00:05:09.940 - 00:05:31.604, Speaker A: We rolled you into a cars topic in which all the cars pages roll into. That also didn't work, as it turns out. And this is one of the sort of misconceptions about how Facebook monetizes your user data, at least as regards what's on Facebook. Isn't that helpful to actually target ads? Zuck's definitely not listening to your microphone. I know. That's the rumor. On level die people always claim, my friend.
00:05:31.644 - 00:05:32.784, Speaker B: Bold claim. Yeah.
00:05:33.454 - 00:05:59.374, Speaker A: Yes. Zuck, if you're listening, the reality is that you rarely say anything on Facebook, or even in the ambient air that would be heavily targetable. Like, when do I say, I'm traveling to Boston next week and want a ticket less than $600. Right? Which would be targetable, but it almost never happens. And so what we realized at Facebook is that in order to actually do proper. And there's a bunch of things that happened, right? Like, the ads formats got better, news feed got better, there was video ads, et cetera. But part of it is we needed outside data outside of Facebook.
00:05:59.374 - 00:06:33.124, Speaker A: The fact that you looked at a $400 backpack at REI but didn't buy it is actually a juicy piece of targeting data. And it turns out if we show you an ad for that, for that bag, the click through rate, the CTR ad tech is all about acronyms. The CTR shoots up from 0.5% to 4%, and suddenly the ad kind of works, and the cpms go up by a lot. We discovered we had to do that. And so the chaos monkeys opens in the scene with me pitching Zuck, saying, hey, like, we have to link to outside data to enable some of this stuff to make it work. And, you know, they've built a lot of stuff since, since 2011.
00:06:33.124 - 00:06:35.940, Speaker A: But that's part of how the Facebook ad system started working.
00:06:36.012 - 00:06:51.740, Speaker B: So my understanding of the way that Facebook, both actually Facebook and Google, the kind of like, hack, the key to getting this outside data was sign in with Facebook. Right? I remember, like, sort of, yeah. So tell me, so how did you go about getting that outside data? Am I right or wrong there?
00:06:51.852 - 00:07:12.524, Speaker A: Um, initially, no. So again, in that scene, I hate to be the sort of writer citing their own work, but it's relevant to the story. In, in that scene with Zuck, like the one, nobody really understand what we were doing. I was. I was the one eyed man in the land of the blind, to be honest. Like, I wasn't the expert here, but I knew a little bit about that because I. My one startup experience before Facebook, other than my own company, was as an ad tech startup.
00:07:12.524 - 00:07:49.518, Speaker A: The one thing Zuck didn't let us do was touch, what was then called platform. That is the like button. So the real estate that Facebook had, now they do use it for ad targeting, by the way, the terms of service have changed, but at the time, they're very sensitive about Facebook Chrome stuff being perceived as monetization. So what actually happens, and again, this is part of the attic machinery. You don't see when you go to a website what are called pixels. Like, literally, it's actually not literally pixels anymore, but a piece of front end code actually runs that syncs your browser session with outside parties that you're not looking at, including Facebook. If you want to see it, there's this extension, I have no affiliation with it, called Ghostery and Ghost ery.
00:07:49.518 - 00:08:07.150, Speaker A: You can use it. And what it basically shows you is all the pixels or all the id syncs firing on the website you're looking at and where they're going to. And it lets you turn them off, by the way, if you want to. And so install it. Go to the New York Times, which gives Facebook a lot of grief about how they make money. And you'll see like 30 odd pixels firing to everybody, including Facebook, by the way.
00:08:07.182 - 00:08:11.694, Speaker B: Well, and why are they doing this? Why does, why do they pass that data over to Facebook?
00:08:11.698 - 00:09:01.310, Speaker A: It, this is one of the key parts of ad tech that people don't understand. They're all fixated on, like, microphones and bullshit. One of the key things underpinning what my current company does and what I think what's going to happen in web three and we can get to that, is identity. What do I mean by identity? Why, for example, is Apple's privacy maneuvers a big deal? And why is it hurting Facebook so much, which it is right for? You know, what is the nature of advertising? All advertising, whether it be a billboard or whether it be an ad that one day runs inside a web three game. What it's about is you have some initial touch point. The funnel is the metaphor that most marketers use, and you can imagine it being wide on top and obviously very narrow at the bottom. Top of funnel, if you want to use the lingo, things happen like ad impressions, you browsing your Twitter feed, checking out that discord post, very initial touch points in this funnel, maybe you click and engage with that content.
00:09:01.310 - 00:09:15.360, Speaker A: You land on the advertiser site, the game developer, the Dex, whatever. Maybe you engage with the content, maybe you do. Maybe you sign in with your wallet or you install the app. You're now mid funnel. Then you start using the app and you start monetizing. You're making money. Now you're down funnel.
00:09:15.360 - 00:09:54.436, Speaker A: The key challenge of much of marketing is tying together the top of funnel event, that Facebook ad campaign you ran or that Twitter influencer that plugged you to that end of funnel monetization event, whether that's happening on chain or off. Attribution, that is literally the attribution problem, which I know sounds very wonky. But at the end of the day, it's basically answering the question, where did users come from? How did they get here, and how long did they stick around and how much money did they spend? It literally is that. And a lot of what Facebook also had to build, in addition to the targeting, is the measurement side of it. It's like, okay, how well did it perform? Facebook had no idea. If you clicked on a Facebook ad in 2011, had no idea what you were doing on other websites and how well the ads were performing. Literally zero.
00:09:54.436 - 00:10:08.302, Speaker A: No clue whatsoever. And so one thing that took ten years to develop in web two, and we're hoping, obviously, that doesn't take that long. Web three is what's called real attribution, real measurement. Like, okay, I gave Facebook $30,000 last month. What was the actual resulting revenue?
00:10:08.398 - 00:10:08.846, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:08.950 - 00:10:40.940, Speaker A: And part of the reason not to shill my bags here a little bit too much, but the company that I'm currently working at and whose offices I'm in, that's what they're trying to answer. Like, a year ago, I got crypto pills and I started talking to crypto companies. I'm like, I don't understand. How do you not know your, what's called ltvs lifetime value, like the total value that the user generates inside your app? How do you not know what's called your CAC, your customer acquisition costs? How much did I pay for this user to come in? How do you not know your retention? That is, how long did the user stick around? These are basic, basic growth metrics that are just like the most basic thing in the world that just basically didn't exist in web three a year ago.
00:10:40.972 - 00:11:31.300, Speaker B: And I have a funny, not to interrupt you too much there, but I have a funny story there, which is one of blockworks makes money in a couple of different ways, but one of the ways that we make money is sponsorships and ads. I don't know, Aave or Uniswap or Coinbase or whoever it may be, will run ads and sponsorships with us. And it was really frustrating in the early days, and even I'm just starting to see a shift in the last year that people are getting better about it. But in the first five years, it was really frustrating because someone might spend 250k on an ad campaign with us, and then we'd go back to them and we want to create case studies, we want to talk about it with other customers, and we'd be like, hey, how was the 250k that you spent? I'm assuming, you know, and they're like, oh, we have no idea. We think it went well because we saw, we, you know, we saw some, we talked to some people and they heard about us through your thing. But, like, tracking? No, we have no idea. It's all so.
00:11:31.300 - 00:11:53.406, Speaker B: I know. So we'll talk about spindle in a little bit. But wait, so answer me that question of, like, why, how did Facebook go from. It's. It's all just Facebook data. You like a cars page. So we're going to show you a Toyota to, hey, you are now browsing on like, I don't know, you clicked this ad for, like, an office chair, and then you went to the site and then you bounced off of it, but then you came back to it and, and then that gets attributed to the ad.
00:11:53.406 - 00:11:55.674, Speaker B: How did they get all that off platform data?
00:11:56.214 - 00:12:17.406, Speaker A: So it's a great question. So there, broadly speaking, there's two sides to that problem. One is the targeting problem. Right? And then, and so, and Facebook data does get used, and I'll get into how it does get used in a second. And it's in ways that most users don't realize. So, again, there's two aspects to it, targeting and attribution. On the targeting side, how does it work? There's this thing called, if you really want to read about it, called custom audiences.
00:12:17.406 - 00:12:51.574, Speaker A: Twitter has a version called tailored audiences. Everyone basically copied Facebook once the product actually shipped. What that means is citing Rei for some reason, which is down the street as an example. I'm a member. I'm a loyalty card member, so they know me pretty well. If Rei knows that you're part of the whales, to use NFT language or gaming language, that spent $10,000 or more, say, last year, here's the thousand users. What they worry about, what the actual sophisticated marker cares about, is how do I reach my users if they're smart and they have the correct data info, which almost everybody does in web two, we're getting there in web three, they know how to reach them along the various channels.
00:12:51.574 - 00:13:28.888, Speaker A: The question is, how well can I reach them? If I have my thousand whales, can I reach 700 of them on Facebook? If I literally give you their email addresses, Facebook, how many of those can you show an ad? At least when this custom audiences product first launched, this match rate, as it's known, was something like 60 or 70%, which is way higher than potentially Google or something else. And so the you and I, I'm the advertiser, you're the ad system for the publisher, and me saying, I want to reach these thousand people and you saying, we got it, bro. We can reach 60% of them. That's like thumbs up. Great. That means that we can share an identifier and target that set of people. Okay, what's the second half of that? It's almost like a yin yang thing to it.
00:13:28.888 - 00:14:01.506, Speaker A: Okay. You show the ad to them and maybe other people. Now I want to measure and see how well do those people monetize. Does it just, if I paid you $1,000 to bring in those 600 people, did they spend more than $1,000? And if so, is it a positive ROAs return on advertising spend, basically the ROI that every marketer knows in their head. That's the measurement side of it. How does that work at a basic level? Well, if you're buying on the REi app, there's what's called an attribution SDK, basically just snippets of code in which Rei is basically saying, okay, this e commerce event happened. Branch metrics or apps, flyer or Facebook.
00:14:01.506 - 00:14:24.266, Speaker A: I'm just mentioning attribution platforms that exist and they basically take ingest those events. They run what's called the attribution compute. They figured out where the user came from and they say, okay, they tally up all that money and they say, it turns out you generated $2,000 in revenue on $1,000 of ad spend. That is a two x return on advertising spend. You made 100 or, sorry, whatever. I said $1,000 on $1,000 we spent. Successful ad campaign.
00:14:24.266 - 00:14:41.628, Speaker A: So there's the measurement component as well, right? And those two together, targeting leads to ad campaigns, which get measured, which refines the targeting, which leads to more ad campaigns. And there's this like flywheel that just generates billions of dollars in web two and doesn't quite exist in web three yet for a bunch of reasons that we can get into.
00:14:41.796 - 00:15:07.214, Speaker B: So what is the so with okay, so part of, the, part of advertising is just joining a bunch of different disparate data sources. And Facebook realized, like, okay, we have to take like, Facebook data, but then combine it with a bunch of off platform data sources. There has to be a joining thing, though. There has to be an identifier to a person. And again, I know, we'll talk about this later. In web three, it's probably the wallet, I would assume you would argue. In web two, it's what the email address?
00:15:07.714 - 00:15:38.642, Speaker A: It's an excellent question. It depends what type of advertising you're talking about. It's probably the email. In the case of a lot of e commerce, in terms of the actual hardware specifics, there used to be a thing called IDFA ID for advertising, which is basically the device ID on an Apple device. It's a Id, Android advertising id. In the case of Google, you used to have a unique identifier on the device. If you've heard a lot about this whole privacy thing that Apple is doing and the fight with Facebook, what they basically did is get rid of the IDFA.
00:15:38.642 - 00:16:09.746, Speaker A: What that means is, again, if you're Facebook and I'm the advertiser and I'm running an iOS campaign on iPhone, we can't agree on the common name for a user. So we can't actually do that tracking from the top of funnel to the bottom of funnel. We have to go through Apple. And I won't get into too much details, but Apple fuzzifies it in a big way in theory, for the sake of privacy, which it sort of does. On the other hand, it is the case they're building their own ad system. So there's a certain competitive gamesmanship going on here as well. But if you destroy, I think if you use database language, it's a primary key.
00:16:09.746 - 00:16:39.326, Speaker A: There's a primary key for that user within that medium. And that primary key in the case of mobile is basically going away. And it also is in the case of web. So cookies, brave famously obscures a lot of details about the browser, doesn't accept cookies. Safari is also dropping it. So third party cookies are basically going away on web as well. One of the interesting long term advantages of web three and why I think web three marketing is going to end up becoming more sophisticated, frankly, than web two is you do have a blockchain equivalent of it called the wallet address, which can serve as that primary key instead.
00:16:39.470 - 00:16:50.586, Speaker B: The impact of Apple. The impact of Apple asking you to opt in or not opt in, they're basically giving you the ability to remove that primary key that joins everything together, correct?
00:16:50.690 - 00:16:51.362, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:51.538 - 00:17:02.094, Speaker B: And who gets impacted by that decision and the decision to safari and brave and stuff like that. Removing cookies, who is the most hurt by this?
00:17:04.034 - 00:17:08.587, Speaker A: Often it's Google and Facebook or the ad networks. It's often the advertiser just taking a.
00:17:08.595 - 00:17:11.235, Speaker B: Very, I was gonna say the advertiser. Right.
00:17:11.259 - 00:17:24.699, Speaker A: Because it means, yeah, their tax are higher, their customer acquisition cost is higher, which, by the way, they're, they're passing the savings on to you. Yeah. So as, given that the marketing budget is part of their cost of goods sold, if their marketing costs go up, your costs go up.
00:17:24.851 - 00:17:37.852, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Everyone thinks it's such a good thing. But, like, the counter to that is that, I don't know, it's kind of nice getting ads served to me that, like, are very relevant as opposed to getting, I don't know. Now on Twitter right now, I'm getting served, like, the most irrelevant ads. I'm like, what is this thing, thing doing here?
00:17:37.868 - 00:17:38.460, Speaker A: Get out of here.
00:17:38.532 - 00:17:42.704, Speaker B: I like getting sort of like my nice office chair ads. I like looking at those.
00:17:43.284 - 00:18:15.824, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I mean, I love privacy as much as the next guy. And I use incognito mode occasionally to, like, see stuff in the, you know, browser without being tracked by everybody. But, like, broadly speaking, ad tech paid for the Internet or paid for the web, two version of the Internet. And bad ads actually are not very good user experience, and some form of advertising will have to exist. And so at least that's how I'm rationalizing to myself. I do think web three, by the way, does open up interesting humanization avenues that aren't necessarily ads or I think the ads will be a lot more interesting and engaging. It won't just be like a little square of, literally a JPEG that you're ignoring.
00:18:15.824 - 00:18:35.526, Speaker A: Ads can be defined much more broadly. To me, it's a piece of targeted commercial media that presents some sort of call to action to a user. And that could be anything. That could be an NFT drop, that could be a token drop, that could be somebody in your discord saying, hey, this new Dex is amazing. That's an ad in a sense. If they're getting paid on a referral basis or something, it's effectively paid media. So there's a lot of more interesting ways.
00:18:35.526 - 00:18:46.334, Speaker A: I think you can create ads in web three. Again, I don't want to reproduce, like, the crappy ads that you see on web two, but some form of commercial discovery has to exist for any sort of mediocre system to survive, basically.
00:18:46.494 - 00:19:04.760, Speaker B: So can you. So this is another thing that we think about at blockworks is like, just, I mean, the state of the ad market, right? Because we're impacted by it. And one thing that we're talking about right now is, like, website ads. Like, just display ads. And if you look at historically, display ads have gone. The CPM, year after year goes down. Every year, the CPM of display ads goes down.
00:19:04.760 - 00:19:14.424, Speaker B: Can you just talk to us about, like, almost the state of web two advertising and, like, what's happening in that world and, like, why things are happening in the way, the way that they're happening?
00:19:14.584 - 00:19:19.096, Speaker A: So you mentioned that acronym against CPM. So just to remind everybody, it's cost per mil, which is cost per thousand.
00:19:19.200 - 00:19:20.644, Speaker B: Wildly confusing, right?
00:19:20.944 - 00:19:35.444, Speaker A: A little. I mean, I've gotten so used to it that, like, I just see the world that way. But, yeah, but yeah, again, it's the cost per square foot. Like, literally a thousand you load. You know, your website gets served a thousand times. How much money did you make? Did you make $3 or 13?
00:19:36.224 - 00:19:55.586, Speaker B: And cpms depend the, like, more niche audience that you have typically, like, the. Or harder to reach audience, the higher your cpM. So, like a blockworks podcast, where we're reaching, like, real crypto professionals, very high CPM. CNN's website, reaching, like, I don't know, hundreds of millions of people, very generic audience, $2 cpm, maybe so, right?
00:19:55.650 - 00:20:26.742, Speaker A: And again, getting back to the cost per square foot analogy, it's like you're kind of like the rich part of town, right? Your cost per square foot, a condo in your neighborhood costs a lot more than a condo in CNN's. Neighborhood. Right. Because the real estate's just more expensive because people looking at it. The human intention, to be blunt, is just worth more on your website than CNN. But how does media get bought and sold? So ads, there's an interesting historical story here. Ads used to get sold CPM, right? In podcasting world, I think they largely still are, in which the publisher does a direct deal with the advertiser, say.
00:20:26.742 - 00:21:01.908, Speaker A: And some old school properties like New York Times probably still have direct sales forces and they probably still have what are called insertion orders, in which they insert an ad into the page and stuff, which, by the way, comes from the print world. They used to insert things into the iOS. The iOS, right. This is very old school language, so that still works, kind of. But how many ads, and certainly the most performance oriented ads get actually paid for is what's called. I'm going to hit you with another acronym, CPA, cost per action. And what does that mean? Instead of paying for the top of funnel action, like splatter New York Times or the newsfeed or whatever, with a million ad impressions, I'm just paying for the thing I want the user to do.
00:21:01.908 - 00:21:36.318, Speaker A: So they come in and register and pay for the paid plan of my app, say, that is the a I want to drive. And I know that that user is going to monetize at an average of, say, dollar 100. So I'm willing to pay, say, $60 to get somebody, Google, Facebook, the media machine, to get that user and get there, which is great for the advertiser. It's not quite risk free, but it's almost risk free in the sense that somebody else has to eat that risk. If the ad is poorly targeted or the ad creative sucks, or if it doesn't show up on the mobile app, I, the advertiser don't pay for those ad impressions. I only pay for the users who came in the door. So advertisers love it.
00:21:36.318 - 00:22:38.606, Speaker A: You might ask, well, but why does the advertising machinery agree to even give you that deal? Doesn't it suck? Well, no, because you get to arbitrage the difference between what you're paying the publisher some CPM and they just want to get paid a CPM versus getting paid that CPA. In other words, if you can correctly target the ad, if you can make the ad perform really, really well, such that a lot of people click on it and a lot of people actually convert and buy the thing, you can make a lot of money in that delta between the $100 or whatever $60 CPA, you're getting paid. And the $1 CPM you're paying to advertisers, there's a lot of money there. And that's why Facebook has, whatever, 30% or 20% gross margins, because the gross margins on that sort of ad business is actually very good if you know how to run the ads. And so a lot of the ecosystem has actually moved to more of the CPA world where you're not, you know, the advertisers doesn't even necessarily know where the ad is running or the specifics of the ad. All they know is that, yes, Facebook or Google brought me 100 new users this month. And so, but again, that world only exists if you have some way of measuring, oh, the user came in and did the thing that I wanted to pay for, and that user belongs in Facebook.
00:22:38.606 - 00:23:28.830, Speaker A: So as the, as the media models went from CPM to cost per click, which was Google for a long time, to cost per install, in the case of mobile, to cost per action, attribution had to go further and further down the funnel, measuring all those events and transmitting it back to the ad network and saying, okay, you actually drove this user. And so in the web two world, that took ten plus years to happen. When I started Natick in 2008, Yahoo was still, remember Yahoo? Yahoo ads used to be a big deal and used to pay dollar, 30 cpms for, like, the banner ad on top of Yahoo autos. Totally untargeted, not tracked very well. Like, not a lot of logic there, but that's how much you'd have to pay. And then by the time that I was, like, leaving Facebook, by whatever, 2013 or 2014, you already had the beginnings of some sort of CPA world in which Facebook could only charge you for the performing ad. But again, the attribution sort of train had to follow all that logic.
00:23:28.830 - 00:23:44.954, Speaker A: In web three, I think a lot of things are flipped. Like, a lot of things, web three are just the mirror image of web two. And I think one of the things is weird is all the monetization events. We already have an attribution database. It's called the blockchain. Right? I mean, it's hard to query and it's hard to organize the data. And the data infra is very rudimentary, by and large.
00:23:44.954 - 00:24:14.456, Speaker A: But I know who actually bought the cryptocurrency or bought the NFT or minted the NFT or did whatever swap on deck. I can see the bottom of the funnel better than I can see the top of the funnel. Web three people, you can run a query inside dune that at least gives you a high level aggregate of what happened on chain, even if you don't know where the hell they came from. Right. And so the attribution challenges and the analytics challenges in web three a little bit different than maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here a little bit, but it's very, it's, it's a little different in web three in many ways. It's more advanced, frankly, than it was in web two when I, when I started web two.
00:24:14.560 - 00:24:55.430, Speaker B: Yeah. Why is the ad tech stack? Oh, so I went to this publisher conference a couple months ago, and every sponsor was this like, ad tech company. How many freaking ad tech companies are there? So I looked up ad tech ecosystem, like one of those ecosystem maps. I was like, I gotta understand how all these guys sit. And it basically, it's like you got the advertisers over here, the publishers over here, and the publishers connect to the audience. And in between those folks, you've got the agencies, the media buying desk, the dsps, the ad exchanges, the ad networks, the horizontal ad networks, the vertical ad networks, you know, the dmPs, the media planners, the retargeting folks, the ad servers.
00:24:55.462 - 00:24:57.374, Speaker A: The verification, the SSP's, the dsps.
00:24:57.414 - 00:25:07.594, Speaker B: So many measurement platforms, the analytics platforms, the creative optimization folks, the brand safety platforms. Now, why, how has this world like this? It's an insane world.
00:25:08.054 - 00:25:32.422, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So for those who haven't looked it up, there's a thing called the Lumascape, which was the original one, but now the Lumascape is a little dated. But if you go and you literally see a map of these logos organized by function, and it is literally thousands of logos. It is this blinding map of the world. Yeah, no, I mean, it's, you know, I don't know, it's weird. It's just, it's a very convoluted rube Goldberg machine in which people just specialize in various parts of it.
00:25:32.478 - 00:25:53.870, Speaker B: I just feel like this doesn't happen in other markets. Like, when you look at how other markets develop, there are typically super disparate companies, and then over time, acquisitions happen, mergers happen, you know, economies of scale. Like the best people just get even stronger. It doesn't. Does it happen in the ad? I mean, I guess Google has dominated. Google dominates it.
00:25:53.942 - 00:26:13.364, Speaker A: Yeah. It's not necessarily m and a consolidation, but there's been just revenue and budget consolidation. The best bulk of the marketing spend still goes through Google and Facebook and all those little boxes. Like the joke of Nat is that, yeah, we're the lifeblood of the Internet. And yet everybody's broke except Google and Facebook. Right. So all those little boxes, they take kind of a cut as the data and the users flow through them, but it's often not a particularly juicy cut.
00:26:13.524 - 00:26:17.144, Speaker B: How many platforms is an ad going through before it hits the audience?
00:26:18.284 - 00:26:27.476, Speaker A: If you're in like what's called the programmatic stack, like that whole machinery, it's touching at least five or six boxes in that diagram easily. Yeah, at least.
00:26:27.580 - 00:26:28.224, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:29.404 - 00:26:41.748, Speaker A: And by the way, a little bit of that is happening in web three as well. We can get into that, but I think you're going to start seeing a little bit of that specialization on the web three side as well, eventually. I mean, you have to, you just can't, unless you are the Facebook, right. You just can't build it all. You can't vertically integrate the entire thing.
00:26:41.796 - 00:26:48.984, Speaker B: Right. I have a couple more questions on web two, then we'll, then we'll do web three stuff. One thing is, why are you so convinced that Instagram is not listening to.
00:26:50.244 - 00:26:55.804, Speaker A: Well, first a, like, there's no value. I actually wrote a wired piece about it that I always just like hit everybody with.
00:26:56.864 - 00:26:58.880, Speaker B: Starters, we'll link that in the show notes also.
00:26:58.912 - 00:27:26.158, Speaker A: Secondly, you'd see it, I mean, in your network trace, you would actually see the equivalent of a voice call going to like the mothership twenty four seven. And you just don't see it. Right. Like would totally wedge your phone or it'd be running locally, but then like, the amount of AI that would have to be happening on your phone, you'd see the cpu pinning all the time as Facebook sits there and runs like ML trying to parse your voice. And you see either those things. And again, leaving all that aside, the technical, it just doesn't make sense. Like, in this conversation, how many things did we say that would have helped us target you and Instagram ad? Almost nothing.
00:27:26.206 - 00:27:28.086, Speaker B: Right? I told you that I want an office chair.
00:27:28.270 - 00:27:33.438, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go. Really? What, what price range? What color?
00:27:33.566 - 00:27:46.974, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So you just. Okay, that's interesting. I guess, I guess it goes to. I guess everyone thinks, all consumers think that their information that they share about themselves is more important than it really is.
00:27:47.554 - 00:28:22.576, Speaker A: Yes. The chapter on this in chaos monkeys I call the narcissism of privacy. Not that I'm anti privacy, obviously. I believe in the privacy and the Fourth Amendment and the whole thing, but I think a lot of the disconnect and thinking about it is that people think that the thing they'd most hate to have escape the conversation with your partner or something is actually the least interesting thing to commercially, Ted, they don't care about that at all. Right? They care about things like your Google search record, maybe. Actually they would care about one place. By the way, your Facebook data does get used is what's called lookalike targeting, which is kind of one of these under discovered things.
00:28:22.576 - 00:28:43.548, Speaker A: What that means is getting back to the REI marketer example of, like, what does the REI person want again? They've got their thousand whales. They know how they can target them on various platforms. What they want is, like, another thousand whales. Like, hey, Facebook, help me find another thousand people. Like these people. And so what happens is they upload that list of emails, they match five or 600 of them, and then you do what's called audience expansion or lookalike targeting. What that means is they use.
00:28:43.548 - 00:29:12.150, Speaker A: So the fact that I don't think we're actually on Facebook, our friends on Facebook, but say we were and say we had a lot of contact with each other, it's probably the case that we're in the same socioeconomic stratus and the same urban sort of consumption lifestyle. Like, it may be the case that Jano is very similar to Antonio, if Antonio actually shopped at REI. And so that sort of audience expansion thing does use your data, frankly. But it's less about, like, what you said in a call, and it's more about what is the sort of similarity metric among all the consumers in the United States. And that is valuable. And Facebook does. Does monetize that.
00:29:12.222 - 00:29:14.714, Speaker B: Yeah, we use that all the time. Block works. It's great.
00:29:15.334 - 00:29:17.630, Speaker A: Oh, you use lookalike targeting on Facebook or on.
00:29:17.702 - 00:29:29.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's great. Let's see. You got to imagine Zuck. Got to imagine one of the biggest regrets that Zuck has is not owning a phone, huh?
00:29:31.114 - 00:29:57.250, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that's right. For those who are wondering, like, what the hell are we talking about? It's been reported at this point, but they were building a phone, and it was when I was there. And the big fear, and I think Suzuka is very strategic in his thinking, is, at the end of the day, seen from the point of view of Google and Apple, who are kind of mortal enemies of Facebook. Facebook is just like another app in the App Store, right? They don't actually own the user. And I think that's come to bite them. And it's true.
00:29:57.250 - 00:30:05.250, Speaker A: If you control the hardware layer, you control the identity, you control how the ad system works. And potentially, yeah, that might have been a mistake in retrospect.
00:30:05.362 - 00:30:17.834, Speaker B: Do you think that? So right now, our data lives in the cloud. Do you think that data eventually goes back to living in hardware and in this case, not like big clunky hardware things, but like, living on device instead of in the cloud?
00:30:17.994 - 00:30:29.216, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that's. Yeah. So I was at a company attribution company called Branch Metrics. That's one of the leading attribution companies. And the reason why they hired me was not to work on the attribution system, is to build an ad system. And the idea there was to.
00:30:29.216 - 00:30:57.360, Speaker A: We kind of accidentally discovered it, but it was pioneering work. We built an ad system that actually lived on device. What that means is even turn off wireless search for a thing in the search bar and you'd be served a search ad because the matching and the actual ad unit was actually loaded on your phone. And then Apple, again, you can read the public pronouncements and read through the lines there a little bit. They're building an on device version of that ad system, supposedly because it's more private, which it sort of is. The data doesn't have to leave the cloud. That said, it's also a better way of targeting in many ways.
00:30:57.360 - 00:31:22.174, Speaker A: If you actually have all the ads matching ML and logic, and you have all the ads metadata on the phone, it actually works better. It loads faster. It's a better ads experience, actually, if you're willing to undergo the complexity of preloading the ad system, pre optimizing it, sending it to the phone, having a bunch of ML run locally, it's actually a better experience for the user. And you can tell the privacy story. And to be blunt, you can screw the Facebook to the world who have a cloud based ad system.
00:31:22.214 - 00:31:22.318, Speaker B: So.
00:31:22.326 - 00:31:25.630, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's pretty clear. That's the way forward for them.
00:31:25.742 - 00:31:28.234, Speaker B: Why do you think Apple hasn't just launched an ad network?
00:31:29.454 - 00:31:42.894, Speaker A: Oh, no, they have. They have. I mean, I briefly worked there, built it. I mean, they have a. If you go to Apple search ads, if you go to your universal search inside the iPhone, you'll see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Live demo.
00:31:42.894 - 00:31:47.154, Speaker A: I can't believe I'm, like, demoing an Apple's search experience, but go to.
00:31:49.364 - 00:31:50.772, Speaker B: Oh, shit. Office.
00:31:50.828 - 00:32:02.276, Speaker A: Here we go. So I entered taxi thinking it would be taxi apps. And there's taxi driver three D is one of the things that showed. Yeah, there's commercial content there. They make billions of thing.
00:32:02.460 - 00:32:15.784, Speaker B: I did not know that. I guess they do in the App Store, too. You can spend it. Yeah. All right, let's get to crypto stuff. Let's get to the fun stuff. So what is the state of crypto marketing today and just the ad markets in crypto today?
00:32:16.374 - 00:32:41.222, Speaker A: I mean, if you had asked me that question a year ago, I would say nonexistent, other than like NFT drops and token drops, which again is a form of paid user acquisition. I think things have improved a little bit between my company and a couple others. You do start having some real measurement. And what I mean by measurement is somebody tweets a thing, they click on the thing, they go to the Dex, they sign with a wallet, they spend money. Can you actually track all that together? Yes, you can. Now actually you have basic measurement and.
00:32:41.238 - 00:32:45.852, Speaker B: You can track like web two ads to Dex user basically.
00:32:46.028 - 00:33:12.906, Speaker A: Yeah, you can. Yeah. And then not only can you do that, one of the interesting things about web three marketing is this whole fixation with referrals. And what that means is it's kind of like affiliate marketing with Amazon. I give you a link, right, because I'm an influencer. You go and trade in the Dex and generate $1,000 in trading fees that goes to the treasury or whatever. I get 10% or 15% or whatever of that, which is pretty juicy, actually, if you think about it, the amount that a given trader can trade on on the decks and often be pretty high.
00:33:12.906 - 00:33:36.834, Speaker A: And so me getting 10% of that spend is actually material. And so that referral, it's built in a very affiliate model, but you often see it in ways that are kind of b two, b. So for example, you can just see this. If you go to Coingecko, they have referral links on their site. So if you go to GMX, for example, the GMX page, and you go to the website page, that's actually referral link. So Coingecko actually makes money off of the GMX referral program and other referral programs. You also have aggregators.
00:33:36.834 - 00:34:09.764, Speaker A: So Quenta, for example, sends traffic, Lyra and synthetix and other ones, and they make money off that referral program, which by the way, it's totally legit. If someone's upstreaming me and sending users my way and those users actually monetize measurably on chain, you should get a cut of that. Believe it or not, some things are rudimentary in web three, but their native thinking is actually quite sophisticated. There was nothing like this. There still is nothing like this in web two, the attribution system. On web two. If a user sees a Facebook ad and a Google Ad and they come and spend money inside my app, I can't pay both Facebook and Google.
00:34:09.764 - 00:34:11.148, Speaker A: Right. The system forces you to pay. Right.
00:34:11.156 - 00:34:22.820, Speaker B: You can only pay the most recent point of attribution. I see what you're saying in crypto. You can actually start to pay out across the whole attribution stack, which is actually like this holy grail of advertising, basically.
00:34:22.932 - 00:34:40.780, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. This thing called MTA. If you want multi touch attribution, what that means is right. If I hear about a thing on your podcast, I google search for the thing, but I don't convert. And then I see a Twitter ad and I finally convert. Guess what? All those three touch points contributed to that user converting. It's not the case that Twitter alone or the Google search alone contributed to that.
00:34:40.780 - 00:35:09.114, Speaker A: Everybody, frankly should get a share of that upside of whatever that is. And web two, it would have been impossible to engineer. Literally, there's no way to do it. And web three, it's not that hard at all. So we have a referral program that basically takes the attribution like say you shared a link on, not to totally put you inside your own podcast, but if you were to share spindle link for some referral program, the users would engage with it, go to the thing you to get a piece of that action. And it could not just be you, it could be somebody else as well because our smart contract can pay out to whoever touch points along the way. So I think you're going to start seeing a lot more interesting.
00:35:09.114 - 00:35:25.162, Speaker A: Exactly. And that's a holy grail of web two. Right. I think you're going to start seeing a lot more interesting models and monetization in which it's much more fair, it's much more transparent to everybody. Right. The user, the advertiser, the publisher, everybody in which, yeah, everyone gets a little kickback for having driven that user action that drove like real value. Yeah.
00:35:25.298 - 00:35:41.602, Speaker B: So is it fair to say that the two main like advertising mechanisms right now in crypto are nfts and nfts and token drops. I put that in like one bucket and then referrals, referral links, I mean.
00:35:41.618 - 00:36:05.314, Speaker A: The other one is questing. You can't, questing is a form of ad effectively, for those who don't know what questing is. It's funny, a lot of things. Web three are just basically reinventions of web two concepts. There used to be a thing called offer walls, which is basically quests. What a quest means is you can go to layer three or galaxy or other providers and it's like, oh, hey, go do these four things that kind of get you a little bit down the funnel and help you engage with this product. And if you like it, you'll stick around and spend more money.
00:36:05.314 - 00:36:22.910, Speaker A: And it's kind of a very engaging ad unit. Again, ads very loosely, sort of defined, and they're getting some traction. And we've actually published case studies with layer three about questing studies. And the users retain that you pay for the quest, by the way, but the users monetize more than that. It's positive. Roas. Hey.
00:36:22.910 - 00:36:48.114, Speaker A: Happy, happy. Like, it actually worked. So, yeah, I would, I would say it's drops, which is basically just like firing money out of cannons and hopefully hoping people walk in the door because of the noise of the cannon and like picking up money from the ground and walk into the store to quests, which are kind of like sort of ad units. And then there is some web two marketing going on, right? Like there are people spending money on Twitter and conventional ads trying to drive them into web three games and stuff. So there's a little bit of that. But like web three native, that's about it.
00:36:49.624 - 00:37:33.004, Speaker B: All right, everyone wanted to talk about vouch again, our favorite insurance provider for crypto companies. If you are building in crypto, you have probably come to realize that contracts need insurance. Partners demand insurance. And as a founder myself, trust me when I say you owe it to not only yourself, but your investors and your clients and your customers. And I'm not just talking about any insurance. Their exclusive coverages are tailored specifically for crypto companies that can address issues like protections for regulatory defense, recognizing daos as insured, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities, and even covering the loss of digital assets, they're in it with you. Whether you're working on l one s, l two s, dows, NPC wallet providers, building a protocol, and a lot more.
00:37:33.004 - 00:38:03.316, Speaker B: So whether you're just scribbling your next big idea on a napkin or gearing up for a big fundraiser, maybe thinking about that IPO or an acquisition, don't leave things to chance. Get insured today with 5% off vouchs. Exclusive coverage for Empire listeners using code Empire. Think about it this way. With vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind. Everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute. But before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up.
00:38:03.316 - 00:38:28.928, Speaker B: Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bank lists put on together. It is the biggest, biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while. You know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:38:28.928 - 00:38:59.062, Speaker B: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off if you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket.
00:38:59.062 - 00:39:15.920, Speaker B: Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up.
00:39:15.920 - 00:39:41.724, Speaker B: Let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there. So what you're describing, though, like, I don't know, someone clicks a link on a blockworks newsletter and they get driven into uniswap. What you're saying is, like, now, for the first time ever, Uniswap can contract that. But in my mind, I'm kind of like, so what? A little, I mean, it's good for us, right? Because we can, like, I don't know, we'll get more renewals or something. But, like, it's not that big of an advancement.
00:39:41.724 - 00:39:59.702, Speaker B: That's. That's no different than, like, I don't know, REI tracking. Like that. They ran an ad in our newsletter and someone bought. Someone bought something. But it does sound like you're saying, look, there's going to be a thing that comes after that, which is this, like, multi touch attribution, because everything lives on this, like, open chain. Am I reading it the right way?
00:39:59.838 - 00:40:20.470, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you might be underselling a little bit. I mean, it's. It's amazing that in the span of basically a year, or not much more than that, web three has speed. Run like 15 years of web two ad history, and gotten to the point where you can share a link and get paid for it. Like that. That didn't exist in 2005. Like, not in any way, shape or form didn't exist in 2010.
00:40:20.470 - 00:41:19.520, Speaker A: Basically, like, it could be very difficult for you to monetize that newsletter of yours in a very ad centric way. So, I mean, yes, we're not quite yet there, but almost at feature parody with web two, but it took them 20 years to get there. Web three got there in a year or two. So this is good news, right? But I agree with you, in the next world, right, in the next iteration of this, once everybody has spindle or once everyone has real measurement of some form or another, I think you're going to start seeing exactly interesting multi touch models, which are a little bit different. I think the good thing about it is that once we start having web three consumer, we have wallet aware experiences, whether they be literally coinbase wallets or wallets, web three experiences that exist on chain, you're going to start seeing the ability for them to monetize particularly well, because an interesting thing about web three is that LTV is lifetime value. The average value of a user is higher than web two, by and large, at least from what we've seen. Right? Like the amount that, like a whale user dumps into Dex is stratospheric.
00:41:19.520 - 00:41:22.604, Speaker A: It could be tens of thousands of dollars. Like, there's this.
00:41:23.464 - 00:41:46.604, Speaker B: We actually had that one time in 2020 or 2021. We said we, we had one of our podcasts, had a referral link in the show notes to like by bit or like, I don't know, one of these exchanges. And it, you know, we hit it. We had, we hit like a jackpot whale or something. And I was like, all right, here we go. And then one day it stopped. And like, paid us every month until it stopped.
00:41:46.954 - 00:42:08.074, Speaker A: Well, yeah, well, let's get into that because that's. Yeah, but that's, but that's the reality, right? Like the LTVs are super high. Daus can be low. But again, getting back to the lesson of cpms, fine, low Dau, but high LTV, the cpms can actually still be pretty healthy if you've got significant amortization. And let's, let's analyze. Why did you lose your referral bonus? Probably, I don't know the details of the program. Maybe it was intentional.
00:42:08.074 - 00:42:44.028, Speaker A: But what often happens, particularly, there's examples out there, like, like GMX is a, is a good example in which that user might have gone in and use a different referral link and your refid tag on chain got overwritten. And even though you should probably claim first attribution forever, at least as long as they window, they simply don't have the attribution let you do it. Of course in our referral product you would. But in the case of a lot of these homebrewed referral products, literally your refid just gets fucking hammered by the next transaction and then that's it, your money goes away. Even though frankly speaking, you onboarded the user, not the next guy. But that's one of the things we're hoping to improve.
00:42:44.116 - 00:43:15.564, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the interesting things is going to be on chain to on chain referrals. Let's say I use Zapper or Zurion or something. I was in Zapper and Zirion both earlier today. I was trying to see if either of them had the ability to lend or borrow directly inside the platform and you couldn't do it, but you can swap inside the platform. The way that they do it right now is they have a native integration probably with something like paraswap or something like that. But you could also imagine a business model where like they send you out.
00:43:18.384 - 00:43:41.608, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean if you trade, if you trade Lyra on Quenta, just Lyra's a spindle client example. I know a lot of their inbound comes through Quinta and Quinta is basically an aggregator, kind of like gem is an aggregator to Opensea and every also another client. And like they're sending value down funnel and in the case of Quinta they are writing it on chain and they are getting paid for that.
00:43:41.736 - 00:43:42.184, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:43:42.224 - 00:43:53.684, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that. So when we talk about referrals, I think the individual affiliate model, like it'll be there, but that's actually not going to be the bulk of it. I think it's going to be one big aggregator upstream, sending value downstream and getting paid for it. That's.
00:43:55.544 - 00:44:02.660, Speaker B: Here'S another example of where this could be is, you know who could build a huge ad network coinbase base.
00:44:02.732 - 00:44:04.092, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:44:04.268 - 00:44:07.204, Speaker B: Yeah, yes, that's right. That's really.
00:44:07.244 - 00:44:09.796, Speaker A: Some of us hope they do. Some of us hope they do and.
00:44:09.820 - 00:44:11.140, Speaker B: Some of us hope to be involved in that.
00:44:11.172 - 00:44:15.564, Speaker A: Yeah, well we've actually, we've actually got a base case study dropping either this week or next.
00:44:15.644 - 00:44:22.024, Speaker B: Oh, nice. I do remember you. Me and Jesse from base were hanging out in Denver. That was the first time I think you and I met in person.
00:44:22.684 - 00:44:32.590, Speaker A: Yeah. So I mean it's going to be public so whatever. And it's already public because they announced it. But. So layer three is running a bunch of quests for a bunch of dapps that launch for this on chain summer thing. And we're going to be measuring a lot of them and doing a case study with them.
00:44:32.702 - 00:44:33.630, Speaker B: Interesting. Very interesting.
00:44:33.662 - 00:44:34.574, Speaker A: We'll see when it drops.
00:44:34.694 - 00:44:47.390, Speaker B: So, okay, so if there's ad tech, there have to be ad marketplaces will, I'm curious if you think that these ad marketplaces are going to be open or closed, and maybe if you could explain the differences between those two things as well.
00:44:47.462 - 00:45:14.068, Speaker A: No, we've been thinking about that a lot, actually. Yeah. Here's a question for you. What does the uniswap of user growth look like? What does it mean? Because an ads marketplace, again, to be very mercenary and cold blooded about it, is literally a marketplace in human attention. I'm a publisher, I have attention, and I want to turn into money. I'm an advertiser, I have money, and I want to turn into human attention. That little yin yang is the dialectic that rules all in an ad system.
00:45:14.068 - 00:45:38.652, Speaker A: So what does that look like in web three? I think it's going to be interesting. It's going to be at least partly on chain for sure. It's going to be composable and permissionless. It already kind of is. So when we, when you start, just as an example, when you start a referral campaign inside spindle, that actually is an on chain smart contract in which there's enough metadata there for you to potentially do something and aggregate that demand in an interesting way. Right. In a way that you don't necessarily have to use our API, even work with us.
00:45:38.652 - 00:46:00.910, Speaker A: In fact, I think Coingecko actually generated a refid and then generated an ad creative and just ran it. They didn't even tell us, they just ran a piece of ad creative, put our spindle link on it and like, all right, permissionless advertising. We're now advertising. I forget what it was. I think it was Lyra on Coingecko. It's like, wow, that's interesting. Can you do it both ways? Could it be the case that the publisher says, put something on chain? Okay, I'm a publisher.
00:46:00.910 - 00:46:21.680, Speaker A: These are the sort of users that tend to come to me. This is the ad format I support. This is my minimum CPM go. And that exists on chain in a very transparent way. And there's an attribution system that actually tracks this publisher, led to this advertiser getting this much revenue, pay them, et cetera. Like, yeah, you can start seeing the makings of that emerge. The question is, like, on a protocol level, how is it tied together? Right.
00:46:21.680 - 00:46:36.364, Speaker A: Amms are obviously very automated in the sense, oh, you've got a liquidity pool here and you've got this much demand for Ethereum versus whatever, and then it all kind of magically works with EVM. What does that look like in ads? And I don't think anyone's quite figured it out yet, but I think it's going to look something very similar to that.
00:46:37.424 - 00:46:41.296, Speaker B: So Facebook has this closed. Is there, is there a better model like Facebook's.
00:46:41.360 - 00:46:41.928, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:46:42.016 - 00:46:46.328, Speaker B: Is it right that Facebook's marketplace is closed and Google is open?
00:46:46.416 - 00:47:06.872, Speaker A: It's open, that's right. Yeah. This is one of the fights that I fought and lost at Facebook. People who've read cast monkeys know the little mini dramas of my career. But at the time, Facebook was undecided. Like, one of the products I had launched was what's called the programmatic ad exchange. What that means is for those who are wondering what the hell is programmatic or real time, it's kind of like Michael Lewis Flash boys in the stock market.
00:47:06.872 - 00:47:31.982, Speaker A: When in Google's ad system, when you load a page or you load an app, what happens is, and you don't realize it because it's happening billions of times a day like that. But what are called bid requests go out to advertisers. Basically, I load a page, it hits the ad exchange. The ad exchange says, oh, shit, this person showed up. They sent out a bunch of requests to a bunch of what are called dsps, basically ad buyers or pieces of software that buy ads. They return with a bid, they rank the bids, they serve the ad. Boom.
00:47:31.982 - 00:47:58.026, Speaker A: And then they do it again a billion times a day. So that's the Google model. And anybody can kind of plug into that huge dataverse. I mean, it always seems to work better when you use Google boxes instead of other boxes. But in theory there's other boxes and it's an open ecosystem and it's a little bit more transparent, even though, of course, Google bakes in its own advantages in the Facebook case, I mean, there used to be a thing, FBX, that was my baby, but that eventually got shut down. How it works now is you have to upload your targeting data. Okay, here's a list of emails, and then Facebook does it all.
00:47:58.026 - 00:48:24.556, Speaker A: And you kind of, you don't really get a lot of transparency into what's going on, other than eventually knowing that, okay, Facebook sent you ten users, but which ad got served? Which ads, where did they appear? You know nothing about that. Facebook handles all of it. So, yeah, it is very much a walled garden, and it's just, it's a, it's a model that all the other social networks have followed. So Twitter is very similar. LinkedIn is the same. Snap is the same. They just, philosophically, culturally, I think, just don't look at the world very differently than Google does.
00:48:24.556 - 00:48:27.700, Speaker A: And they like keeping things in their own little.
00:48:27.892 - 00:48:57.044, Speaker B: The one disconnect I'm having here is, so in traditional world, like, you fund an account, right? You might find Twitter or Facebook or whatever it may be, you deposit the budget somewhere and then, like, you put in your campaign details and you're creative and all that kind of stuff. And it kind of gets sent out to the world, often to publishers and different places. But the thing that, you know, is a requirement is for a publisher to have a place for that ad to sit. Right? Where is that ad sitting on chain?
00:48:58.304 - 00:49:02.804, Speaker A: Good question. Did you, if you want to come out of the office. So we've got a whole diagram. We're trying to figure it out on the whiteboard.
00:49:03.604 - 00:49:13.700, Speaker B: Well, I'm also trying to, like, in my, in the back of my head, I'm trying to figure out, like, how this applies to block works, obviously, and, like, a lot of our revenue comes from advertising. So I'm trying to figure out how this helps us, too, but.
00:49:13.772 - 00:49:38.710, Speaker A: All right, so, so one disconnect here is that, like, the natural clock cycle cycle of ads, which is, like, literally real time millisecond, is way too fast for any blockchain. So I don't care. Whatever blockchain l one claims that it's got a TPS high enough. The real time ad exchange world is just at branch, we used to ingest something like 300,000 qps, that is, events per second. That's. That dwarfs all of Web three's transactions per second put together times five. Right.
00:49:38.822 - 00:49:56.754, Speaker B: I don't think people realize that the ad markets are so similar to the stock market, and they also trade. I mean, you trade them and people, they trade on not just, like, quantitative data, but also Elon takes over Twitter. People don't. Advertisers like cmos, don't like Twitter, don't like Elon. So, like, the price of an ad dollar on Twitter is going to fall.
00:49:57.404 - 00:50:14.660, Speaker A: There's momentum in the ads. Markets like to run the equity markets. Yeah, yeah, but, yeah, but, yeah, but the ads markets are super fast. Like, how did that shit live on chain? It's a lot of it's not going to live on chain. So, like, when the publisher loads the page, you have to have a publisher SDK that serves the ad, that just serves the ad in real time. You can't hit something on chain or do anything on chain. And so a lot of the real time aspect can't live on chain.
00:50:14.660 - 00:50:39.482, Speaker A: But I think if you think about a lot of the other state that goes into an ads buy, like, okay, here's my budget, I'd like to leave that ad on for three days. Or this. You know, the number of ads that you would see navigating a given website isn't that high. Right. It's not like thousands of different ads. So if you actually break it down to the state, that doesn't change that fast. A lot of that could live on chain and then specifically the performance data and how they get paid.
00:50:39.482 - 00:51:08.604, Speaker A: That obviously natively has to live on chain. Because again, that's the exciting thing about the blockchain. Right? Like, again, going back to branch, example of a web attribution platform, it's sitting there getting this firehose of events and shuffling data around to everybody. Why not just have one database for it that everyone addresses? That's exactly what you have in web three. You don't need to send hundreds of thousands of server to server pings every second forever to make the system work. You've just got one system. But yes, the big question is, what fraction of that data lives on chain versus does it?
00:51:10.544 - 00:51:14.684, Speaker B: Who is going to be the master of the. So you guys are building a branch, right?
00:51:15.664 - 00:51:20.364, Speaker A: Sort of. Although it's getting bigger than that because we've got the referral side and then who knows how much.
00:51:20.934 - 00:51:21.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:21.694 - 00:51:26.494, Speaker A: How far the little fingers will go. But who's going to be like, the.
00:51:26.534 - 00:51:45.230, Speaker B: Master of the ads in what? Like, I don't know. Here, let me, let me run a couple by you. Like, I mean, you could see, we just talked about the, like, base, base network and Coinbase. Like, they could be the master of the ads. You could see another world where like, the Solana phone ends up being like the master of the ads? Like, who do you think ends up being the master of the ads in crypto?
00:51:45.382 - 00:52:11.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I've often asked myself, like, who's the Facebook in Crypto? I know that might come off as a negative connotation. As a former facebooker here, who literally has Facebook posters in the office, we literally have the move fast and break things poster in the office. Yeah. Who would be the Facebook crypto? I mean, obviously, I think Coinbase has a very strong vision there. We're very pro base. The chain, they obviously have by web three standards, a huge number of MAU through the wallet. They have the coinbase.com
00:52:11.494 - 00:52:42.614, Speaker A: experience. They have a questing platform, they have a small ad system. If they actually make that work. If they, they make the l two take off and they have whatever it is, 10 million MAU or whatever. I don't even know what the number is, but something around there and actually point that at a chain dapps, actually start getting, you know, start getting engagement, you actually have some, some ability to actually promote growth in that coinbase wallet experience, whatever. I think that could be very, very interesting. And, yeah, I think they have all the makings of, like, a real consumer ecosystem in web three in a way that, like, nobody else has all the pieces under one roof.
00:52:42.614 - 00:52:44.690, Speaker A: And so we're very excited about it.
00:52:44.802 - 00:53:08.774, Speaker B: Yeah. One thing that we talk a lot about in, like, defi world is, like, just, I don't know, just cross chain liquidity, basically. And this conversation, if you think about an ad market, like a stock market or like a crypto market, you have to think about, like, ad liquidity, actually. And, and then it makes me think about, you have to tie that into, like, ad attribution as well. So how do you think about cross chain attribution?
00:53:09.834 - 00:53:15.434, Speaker A: Oh, it's hard. So I know it's public yet, but whatever. One of our customers is Axelar, who's a bridge.
00:53:15.514 - 00:53:16.018, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:53:16.106 - 00:53:46.962, Speaker A: And man, was it hard as shit to do, to be blunt. I mean, we spent a month trying to, trying to get them on board. I'm sure we'll do a case study about it or whatever. It's just knowing that you go from chain a to chain b is just a hard measurement problem. And then, particularly if you look at what is the usage pattern for bridging, maybe they're doing a quest in which they bridge from chain a to chain b to go do a thing, and then they bridge back. It's actually like a round trip. And do you count that twice, or do you see that as one user journey? You've obviously got, by the way, however many chains, I don't even know exactly.
00:53:46.962 - 00:54:11.444, Speaker A: Off top of my head is Arnax large? Dozens at least. You've got this covariance matrix of dozens by dozens, potential interactions that you have to render in some usable way. There's just a lot of interesting challenges, the cross chain thing. So, yeah, that was an interesting case for us to actually work on. There's something else you said that I actually wanted to fix it on. Oh, the liquidity problem is an interesting one.
00:54:11.944 - 00:54:12.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:12.352 - 00:54:46.656, Speaker A: Again, if you're thinking about, like, what's the real web 3d gen ad system, like, how does it work? What is the liquidity problem? What do you need? Cash for? Well, what you need cash for is actually to run ads, budgets is what you need for, right? Because one of the interesting things about Web three that is, again, very different than web two and web two, I pay Facebook $30 for the user, right? I kind of own the user. The user comes in and uses my app, and they spend $70 and they churn out, and that's the full lifetime that is experience. I pay for the user, I own them, I kind of milk them. They disappear. End of. Web three doesn't work that way. You don't buy users.
00:54:46.656 - 00:55:27.200, Speaker A: You kind of rent them in the sense that, like, either you have to constantly pay them rewards, blur comes to mind for them to stick around or promise them rewards for them to stick around. Or, like, in your case, right, you're getting paid for the user that you brought in almost like an annuity, like a bond. Like, literally 10% of this guy's revenue was being paid to you in, like, regular installments. It was like an annuity. And when you stopped getting the installments, you're like, what the hell? Right? So, like, there wasn't a singleton CAc, it was an ongoing thing. But that raises a problem, right? The monetization in web three is an ongoing thing, like a coupon payment on a bond. However, if you're working with traditional publishers, they expect to get paid upfront for media, right? So either you convince them to take a rev share or you pay upfront.
00:55:27.200 - 00:55:35.000, Speaker A: And so you have a liquidity mismatch between the cash being traded. So then how do you, how do you float that? Well, there could be interesting solutions to that.
00:55:35.112 - 00:55:55.572, Speaker B: That is really interesting. Yeah. Very applicable to blockworks business, actually. So are you firing a. Are you firing an attribution event every time someone's writing on chain? Like, you guys must be firing a crazy amount of attribution events, huh? Well, so good question. Like, can you explain actually a little more about, like, the details of how spindle works?
00:55:55.668 - 00:56:10.220, Speaker A: Have you. We're totally bold in public, so go to our blog. A blog spindle XYz, if you care about privacy and all that stuff. We talk about it publicly. We're. We're very public about how we build, and there's nothing, like, weird or shady going on. So on the web two side, it looks pretty normy.
00:56:10.220 - 00:56:46.632, Speaker A: I mean, it's like branch or like Google Analytics, right? Like you go and you fire a page view. When you go and you look at the page, like, it's not that strange and weird, and it looks. Looks very like Google Analyticsy. Where it gets a little weird is when you sign in with the wallet and you go on chain and you start doing stuff and you're kind of out of web too. Right? So what do we do there? I mean, in my opinion, to be blunt, and not that your question was dumb at all, but just like the very what people tried doing before Spindle existed is actually trying to fire events and mimic double entry bookkeeping. What's happening on chain with a web two system? So they would fire events into a conventional web two attribution system to mimic what's going on chain because they had no alternative. Right.
00:56:46.632 - 00:57:07.488, Speaker A: But that's kind of like it's. I wouldn't say the dumb way to doing it, but it's a very hacky way of doing it because you're never going to keep up. Like it's. You're never going to keep up with what's happening on chain. They would, in fact drop events and not see what's going on. The smart way to do it, which is the hard way, is actually indexing the subgraph correctly and measuring what's happening on chain correctly and backing that into the revenue number that you care about. That's how we do it.
00:57:07.488 - 00:57:31.758, Speaker A: And so we, we track the web two stuff in a very web two way, and then we track the web three stuff in a fully web three way, and then we join that in a different way. But that's how we do it. So we don't fire. We fire events to ourselves, but the advertiser is not firing anything to us that's happening on chain. They don't need to do anything in terms of integration hassle. It's fully on us. So if you were fully on chain, like a defi protocol, you would literally need nothing to integrate with spindle.
00:57:31.758 - 00:57:35.190, Speaker A: We would do all the heavy lifting of indexing stuff on chain.
00:57:35.342 - 00:57:36.914, Speaker B: Do you pay out on chain?
00:57:37.254 - 00:57:48.972, Speaker A: Yes, you have to. The marketing budgets are usually a native token on chain. They're not going to pay in fee. DeFi protocol doesn't have the reflex of shoveling twenty k a month to Facebook. They just doesn't exist. It has to be native land chain. Yeah.
00:57:48.972 - 00:58:02.012, Speaker A: So our referral smart contract, our attribution is centralized and off chain because the compute is just too fast and there's too much going on for it to be on chain. But that gets paid in a very oracle like way to a smart contract that then does pay natively on chain.
00:58:02.188 - 00:58:02.944, Speaker B: Huh?
00:58:03.744 - 00:58:04.168, Speaker A: Yep.
00:58:04.216 - 00:58:05.124, Speaker B: That's really cool.
00:58:06.104 - 00:58:27.204, Speaker A: I mean, again, we don't believe in decentralization as religion. But we do think there's a proper web three way of building things. And we do, you know, we try to, we strike what we hope is the right trade off. But to the extent that it should live on chain for the sake of being transparent, composable, permissionless, we do build on chain. And for the extent at which it's like, it's a complicated compute, it would be expensive to put on chain. We don't. And so.
00:58:28.964 - 00:58:43.264, Speaker B: What is it, why is, why is this the, what is my question here? Is this good? Is this, like, do we need ads? And why are, why are ads good? I have, I have many thoughts, by the way, as an ad business, but like, why are, why do you think ads are good?
00:58:45.884 - 00:59:22.262, Speaker A: Because I think the reality is that a lot of consumer use cases are not going to be supported through anything other than ads. As a matter of fact, a lot of the consumer, a lot of web to consumer wouldn't exist without ads, which I don't know, like, hey, I'm as much of a letter as an X guy. I used to use pine for email 20 years ago, and I thought it was a great email client that said, use Gmail now. So, and again, I think you have to define ads very, very broadly. It's not necessarily showing you like a square of some shitty thing that you're ignoring on a consumer experience. It's like your favorite influencer, who maybe is a tastemaker in some part of crypto you care about, is getting paid for that influence. In a way.
00:59:22.262 - 00:59:51.874, Speaker A: They are a publisher. They're a decentralized publisher, similar to your podcast. People pay attention to what you know. You influence a lot of perception in crypto, and if you drive users to a certain DAP, then I don't know, you should get recompense for that. If you weren't getting paid for that, this podcast wouldn't exist. Probably right? And so that's where I think ads are good. And I think also, like, here's like the stone cold, hard nosed web two ad tech boomer reality, right, for web three to get to a billion users on chain, and this doesn't exist now, and it's a major problem that I think about all the time.
00:59:51.874 - 01:00:17.114, Speaker A: There has to be a way for me to turn money into users, like real legit users who care about my app. If that machine doesn't exist, we're not going to get to a billion users on chain. It's just not going to happen because you need to have some way to turn on. I launch a new app, I want the world to see it and find out about it. They want to find out about it. If they knew about the app, they would use it and would become recurring users. Something has to fix that, that disconnect.
01:00:17.114 - 01:00:25.850, Speaker A: And we call that ads. And again, it doesn't have to be those little display ad units, but there has to be some form of targetable media that presents the user with a call to action.
01:00:26.002 - 01:01:04.724, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think the onboarding solutions or the onboarding platforms role in tracking will be? Let me give you an example. The first time someone ever downloads metamask or installs metamask, metamask could drop you an NFT in your wallet so that you. And then anytime you trade on uniswap or you go into, you bridge over to using Axelar into, like, I don't know, avalanche or something like that. Like that. Nft kind of sticks with you, and that's like one form of non chain cookie, but it feels kind of like an obvious thing, but maybe like a really arcane, like, we're thinking very, I don't know, web two model here. What do you think of that model?
01:01:06.464 - 01:01:09.600, Speaker A: I mean, I won't comment on metamask specifically, but if you're asking me, broadly.
01:01:09.632 - 01:01:15.404, Speaker B: Speaking, broadly, not metamask. Yeah, yeah. Just onboarding solutions and, like, their role in tracking and things like that.
01:01:15.724 - 01:01:43.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they're top of funnel. I think wallets rightly are turning themselves into the portal for web three. If I go use coinbase or metamask, I can discover new dapps or NFT or experiences inside my wallet. And I think they should be, because that's how users are getting on chain in some form or another. And so, yeah, in some sense, yeah, they're top of funnel. And so here's a random view from the trenches as well. Right.
01:01:43.144 - 01:02:04.520, Speaker A: When we launched Spindle, we originally thought Dapps would use us the most to look up funnel. I'm a dapp. I'm doing things to make users love me. Where are these users coming from? That's the pivot. Me looking towards the top of the funnel and pivot it by channel and pick out the fact that, look, blockworks actually drove this many users. Turns out some of Spindle's users are not dapps. Actually.
01:02:04.520 - 01:02:35.044, Speaker A: They're what you would call top of funnel. People who are, it's the first user's contact with the chain. And what they care about is not how they got. I mean, they sort of care about how they got there. What they really care about is, okay, what does the user do after me? Is there some NFT collection or NFT marketplace out there that it turns out I'm driving a huge part of their revenue? I didn't even know it. I'm definitely not getting paid for it. What is going on in the world? We call this eco internally, it's basically what is the ecosystem view of the part of the chain that I inhabit.
01:02:35.044 - 01:03:04.956, Speaker A: We have a decent number of use cases in which that's exactly what they're looking at. They're looking down funnels. It's really interesting. And I think what we see going on, it's funny, my employees troll me so much because I've used the metaphor so often, they actually bought me one. But I often use a metaphor of like a voltmeter, right? Which if you've ever had been in double e or whatever, it's like you're in a circuit. You put the two probes and you measure, like the voltage drop on different points in the circuit. Part of what spindle is, frankly, is sticking our little probes top of funnel and bottom of funnel, and seeing how much money and people are actually transiting between those two points in the funnel.
01:03:04.956 - 01:03:25.804, Speaker A: That's kind of what we exist to do. And sometimes it's the upper probe using spindle and sometimes it's the lower probe using spindle. But measure measuring, we are. And the question is, once you measure, how do you establish some business relationship that is some rational piece of value transfer that, you know, makes that relationship, you know, deeper and more effective?
01:03:26.824 - 01:03:35.004, Speaker B: So what's the pitch for blockworks? How can, like, if you were, if we were sitting in a room and we were thinking about using Spindle, like, what is the, what is the low hanging fruit for blockworks to use Spindle?
01:03:35.774 - 01:03:37.554, Speaker A: You said he had a newsletter, right?
01:03:37.894 - 01:03:47.394, Speaker B: Newsletters. We have nine podcasts. We have conferences. We've got the media website that millions of people read every month, and we have ads across the whole business.
01:03:48.094 - 01:04:12.614, Speaker A: So, I mean, podcast attribution is fascinating, but more complicated, right? Because it's audio, there isn't necessarily an audio call to action. It's a little bit different. And typically you have, like, Casper mattress use referral code, blah, blah, blah. That's about the extent of it. But on more visual media. Yeah, dude, you could sign up for doing rev share referral programs with various Dexs and then run the link inside your newsletter as you, as you're already doing. And you could get paid for it.
01:04:12.614 - 01:04:22.854, Speaker A: I mean, you, you could put our SDK on your website and see where users are coming to you in a very Google analyticsy way. Are any of your properties like wallet aware? Do people log in with a wallet?
01:04:23.834 - 01:05:04.182, Speaker B: Our research platform is the only thing right now. If you own this nft, you get access to it. But we've, it's something that we've debated, which is like, do you put a wallet on your website to get really interesting? Right now we have web two first party data on customers or on our readers, which is like, I don't know, maybe here's your net worth or here's your, actually, that's not even really first party data is net worth. It's like, what is your job title? What is your company? Things like that. What having a wallet on our website would allow us to do is be like, this person's a power user of Aave and they read a lot of articles about, like, bitcoin. Okay, we've got like, this weird bitcoin maxi who like, loves Aave. That's like a, I don't know.
01:05:04.182 - 01:05:07.886, Speaker B: That's why I like having a wallet attached to the, to the website would be really interesting.
01:05:08.070 - 01:05:41.574, Speaker A: Well, that's exactly right. So that's our next question. So if, if you do, if you are wallet aware and you could fire us, the wallet sink event, we could a give you interesting wallet profiles. That would answer the question. You just said if the person's a heavy aave user or whatever, you could also see like, okay, did I drive the user to go do something? Like, did I write like add a state of Ave? Just you dropped on mentioning a state of Ave report, a state of on chain lending report, and somebody actually goes and does a bunch of lending. Right? Like, you'd want to know that, right? And potentially work out a deal. I mean, it's your journalist, so maybe you can't quite shell things quite so hard, or maybe you have to have separate sponsored content or something.
01:05:41.574 - 01:06:00.004, Speaker A: But you'd like to understand, like what is your impact, right? Like how much, how much stuff am I driving on chain? Or if you do, you do a review on base, it's like, okay, how many new use, how many new base users did I drive and how much in gas fees did I drive for Coinbase? You'd want to know that, right? It'd be interesting potentially, if you work at a sponsorship with them or something we could track.
01:06:02.944 - 01:06:13.440, Speaker B: Someone's going to make a killing building. Like the nerd wallet for crypto. Yeah, probably. And you guys will be involved in that somehow. All right, interesting man.
01:06:13.512 - 01:06:28.536, Speaker A: We're happy to measure. We don't typically do, like, direct consumer facing stuff just because I'm allergic to the consumer stuff. We're here to measure and to be clear, we don't pick size. We'll measure any chain, work with any dap. We are data Switzerland. Like, we don't pick winners or, like, have exclusivity with any Dapp or anything. And everything we do is.org
01:06:28.536 - 01:06:35.688, Speaker A: scope. So we work with competitor A and competitor B. None of the data touches each other, any of that stuff. We're just here. We're just here to be the vault meter, so to speak.
01:06:35.736 - 01:06:40.084, Speaker B: Nice. I like it. Anything we missed about the crazy world of ads?
01:06:40.504 - 01:06:47.984, Speaker A: Dude, I think it's amazing. In what, just over an hour, I think we covered everything. We answered every question in web three marketing. Ever or close to it.
01:06:48.104 - 01:07:33.590, Speaker B: Ever. Ever. What do you think happened to cpms? What? What will happen to cpms in crypto over time here? Because there's two are like one in one world, advertisers outside. The only people who care about reaching crypto users right now are crypto people like our crypto companies. So in one world, cpms end up going much higher in crypto because non crypto companies want to reach those crypto people, either because they launched their own crypto things or because they realize it's a very affluent group of people who try new technology, et cetera. So that drives cpms higher. The other thing that would drive cpms lower is, I don't know, like Bloomberg and Bloomberg, like, when Bloomberg Media was getting big, they had, like, hundred dollar cpms.
01:07:33.590 - 01:07:42.874, Speaker B: But now Bloomberg Media does not have hundred dollar cpms, obviously. And I think just as you get scale, cpms go down. I'm curious where you think that goes.
01:07:43.234 - 01:08:18.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I know people are clearly targeting crypto audience. We find it with a company called addressable that does just that, right? To use blockchain data to target people on Twitter and stuff. And a lot of their advertisers, from what I understand, aren't even natively on chain, right. They just want to use blockchain data to target ads because it is rich. So I do think some cpms definitely go up, and I think just tossing out random publishers, etherscan, Coingecko coin, Microcap, DAP radar, a lot of these crypto heavy sites, in my opinion, are probably under monetizing in terms of what they could be monetizing at if they had proper ads, targeting and attribution. Of course, I would say that. But I do think their cpms will go up in time as the ad set gets more sophisticated.
01:08:18.278 - 01:08:36.514, Speaker A: But to your point, I do think there's some crypto media out there. I won't name names whose rate cards I've seen, and they're insane. There's no way that media is worth that much. And if they were to put a spindle link on it and actually measure their value, I suspect the cpms would back out to a tad bit less than what they're charging. But what do I know? I would love to do the measurement study to see what that is.
01:08:36.574 - 01:08:42.614, Speaker B: But not naming names, huh? It's a supply and demand market, my friend. It's just a marketplace. There's more demand than supply.
01:08:43.674 - 01:08:50.442, Speaker A: Look, real measurement is like when the tide goes out and you see who's wearing a bathing suit and who is it. Yeah, that's what measurement does.
01:08:50.578 - 01:08:53.490, Speaker B: I did see that rate card the other day. I did.
01:08:53.642 - 01:08:56.174, Speaker A: I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about.
01:08:56.714 - 01:08:58.334, Speaker B: Good pod man, good chat.
01:08:58.994 - 01:09:04.113, Speaker A: Excellent. Yeah, I think it's been entertaining, right? This is a. We're not going to make people go to sleep with too much ad tech chatter.
01:09:04.313 - 01:09:07.693, Speaker B: Gee, we pushed the limit, but yeah.
01:09:08.393 - 01:09:09.253, Speaker A: Okay.
01:09:09.673 - 01:09:11.713, Speaker B: Awesome, man. All right, well, be well. We will talk again soon.
