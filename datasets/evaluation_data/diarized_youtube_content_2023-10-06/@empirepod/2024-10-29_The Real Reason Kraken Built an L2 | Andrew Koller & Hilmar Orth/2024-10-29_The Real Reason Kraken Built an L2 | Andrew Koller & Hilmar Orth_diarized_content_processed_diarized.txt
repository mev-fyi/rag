00:00:00.640 - 00:00:13.289, Speaker A: Let's take Kraken on chain. Let's figure out how we can start taking our best in class UX security and everything that we do for consumer and pro and our deep central order books and how do we take that on chain?
00:00:13.337 - 00:00:25.925, Speaker B: We are building web3 right? We are building a new Internet and you want to be connected to everyone else and as soon as you do your own thing and then it might not be as easy as you thought to be interoperable with all of them.

00:02:33.905 - 00:02:39.593, Speaker D: What's going on everyone? We're recording this Thursday morning. Kraken just announced Inc. Um obviously had.
00:02:39.609 - 00:02:41.929, Speaker C: To record an emergency episode with Andrew.
00:02:41.977 - 00:02:59.369, Speaker D: Who is the founder of Inc Inc. Is Kraken's new L2. And then Hilmar, who actually I met at Permissionless, the founder of Gelato. There are these roll up as a service platforms. Gelato is one of them. And Kraken worked with Gelato to launch the L2. So I thought we could have a conversation about Kraken's L2.
00:02:59.369 - 00:03:06.321, Speaker D: But also there's actually a bigger thing happening, which is app chain. Thesis Uniswap launched Uni chain. Everyone's talking about.
00:03:06.353 - 00:03:09.673, Speaker C: Everyone's launching a chain. Everyone's launching an L2. Why are we doing this?
00:03:09.809 - 00:03:20.615, Speaker D: How do you do it? Is it really. Does it really cost $15 million a year to do this? And so I think this, hopefully this conversation turns into a bigger thing. But yeah. Andrew, welcome to show. Hilmar, welcome.
00:03:21.155 - 00:03:23.019, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you for having us.
00:03:23.187 - 00:03:24.251, Speaker B: Pleasure to be here.
00:03:24.363 - 00:03:42.125, Speaker D: Yeah. Andrew, let's start with the basics. Inc. Obviously I know what it is, but I want to know. I want to know the backstory. Like, I want to know when you guys started kind of scheming this up. Like when, what was the initial meeting? Were you in those meetings? Or then you got hired to do this? Like, tell me the backstory of this.
00:03:42.785 - 00:03:48.233, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot to it. So I'm going to try to do the abridged version. But you can do, you can do.
00:03:48.249 - 00:03:51.321, Speaker D: The long version too. Share. Share your real ones. Let's do it.
00:03:51.353 - 00:04:41.263, Speaker A: Let's do it. So I've been at Kraken almost six years and have worked on so many different products with like listing coins, with building out the custody solution, building out a cryptography team, doing all the kind of like basic things that an exchange needs to do, and making really good deposit withdrawal ux, making really good UX across consumer and pro products. But it kind of got to this point where it felt like, okay, what, what else? You know, what, where can we take it beyond an exchange? And this was almost two years ago at this point, you know, maybe a year and a half. I rehired somebody or I was trying to rehire somebody that I'd worked with in the past. We built the parachain product at Kraken before. Kind of like that was like our first teaser of like an on chain thing. And I rehired him because I did a very long walk in Amsterdam with him where he was like, we got it.
00:04:41.263 - 00:05:05.299, Speaker A: We got to do something else. We got to do something more. We got to try to take Kraken on chain. And we had like a five hour walk where we Kind of came up with this idea of like, okay, let's just, you and me, let's just do all kinds of experiments. Let's do zero knowledge proof verifiers. Let's make some contracts where you can authenticate to a liquidity pool or something like that. Or even running all the stacks out there.
00:05:05.299 - 00:05:36.225, Speaker A: Like, let's do the testnet on Arbitrum. Let's do a super chain testnet. Let's do ZK sync, let's run everything. And we had a lot of internal fun with that, where it was a bunch of contests, people minting things. I had lawyers deploying contracts, which I never expected a lawyer to do, but they were deploying contracts on chain support. Agents and product managers were all getting in there. So we had a lot of really good feedback and it was really obvious to us to just take this further.
00:05:36.225 - 00:06:18.107, Speaker A: And then we settled on the super chain that was us joining something that was really strong in network effects. And it felt like the right move because it was really easy to use. The optimism team is absolutely fantastic to work with. And then we said, okay, this is it. Let's take Kraken on chain. Let's figure out how we can start taking our best in class UX security and everything that we do for consumer and Pro and our deep central order books. And how do we take that on chain, and that includes all the authentication layers, accounts, anything that's ancillary to accessing that central liquidity.
00:06:18.107 - 00:06:33.349, Speaker A: How do we take the off chain stuff, put it on chain and it made sense for us to just have our own chain. And then we met Hilmar and we decided Gelato was an awesome launch partner because, you know, I don't want to run the thing ourselves. It's. It's nice to have some help.
00:06:33.517 - 00:06:54.225, Speaker D: Nice. What is the. If you were sitting down with maybe a board member at Kraken or, you know, we had Dave Ripley on the show several months ago and we're talking about a potential Kraken ipo. And you're talking with like a public market investor or something. Thinking about Kraken, how would you explain the. The why behind Ink? Like, why does Kraken need to move on, Jane?
00:06:55.525 - 00:07:56.353, Speaker A: So the, you know, again, I think it's. It's kind of taking the. We've always offered trading and buying and selling of the assets that we support and all the blockchains that, you know, the hundreds of them that we run. And it just, from like a creative standpoint, it made sense for us to like actually get involved in that, okay, we're offering this as a product for people to buy and sell. But it just kind of intuitively felt like, okay, we need to actually put something on chain and work with the things that we're enabling people to buy and sell and then getting philosophical on it. I think it's no secret that the Dex volume is sometimes surpassing centralized volume. And I think it made sense for us to explore that avenue and realize that those OG cypherpunk values of crypto with self sovereignty, permissionless money, self custodial, like being able to plug in and just do something straight from your desk to manage your whole wealth, it made sense for us to lean into that because Kraken has always held those really close to us.
00:07:56.353 - 00:08:14.415, Speaker A: Like, we have a ton of OGs at Kraken that have been in the space since like 2013, 2012. And, you know, we always kind of internally hold that culture really close. So this made sense for us to just take. What do we do on a centralized format? How do we move it more on Chain?
00:08:17.515 - 00:08:36.307, Speaker D: Can you tell me what it was like getting the company on board with this? I read in a. I forget if we wrote this or Bloomberg wrote this, but you guys have like 40 people working on this. We've tried to do. I mean, we have 75 people at Blockworks. We've tried to do initiatives. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It usually actually has nothing to do with the technical aspect of it.
00:08:36.307 - 00:08:42.545, Speaker D: It usually is about getting the company to like, get on board with this thing. What did that look like?
00:08:43.845 - 00:09:18.189, Speaker A: To put it simply, doing all those experiments and having the lawyers that would be telling us no or yes, get involved with it and actually, like, use the tech, was insanely valuable. So there's this like internal Inc. General channel that we have that I kind of left it as like an open channel for the whole company to join in and, you know, explore with us on this journey on Chain. And it grew to like a thousand members really fast. So there. There's a thousand people in there that are all internal to Kraken. And they all just are shooting ideas everywhere.
00:09:18.189 - 00:09:24.885, Speaker A: They are deploying things on Chain. They're all having fun. So it was important to just like, yeah, take the whole company along for the ride.
00:09:25.045 - 00:09:54.265, Speaker D: Nice. Nice. The obvious response, which I saw this in, you know, in a lot of the Twitter threads and Twitter replies when, when this got announced was, does the world really need another L2? And actually, Hilmar, I'd love your take on this too, but maybe we can start with Andrew because I think, I think those, those reply guys are going to get really fed up in the next several months. As you know, probably hundreds of L2s go live. But yeah, Andrew, how do you think about this? Like, why does the world need another L2?
00:09:55.605 - 00:11:15.295, Speaker A: I'll be, I'll be quick with my, my response and pass it over to Hilmar. But it like honestly we were talking about this a little bit offline too but like why not, why would you not do an L2? Because, and this is a cliche that's kind of overplayed but much like the 90s of the TCP IP kind of convergence of the Internet protocols, I feel like that's happening with Superchain and particularly Ethereum and some of the kind of cross chain intents and stuff. So if everything's converging, why would companies not have their own L2 if they can bring all their authentication layers to be easy UX one click type of things where you're using some kind of liquidity that you don't, you know, you don't have to go through like several hops of brokers and all that kinds of jazz to get there, then yeah, why would you not take your stack on chain? And then one final thing though is like there was an interview a long time ago with Hayden where when he launched Uniswap and he said something like for once in like my engineering career, you can launch a application used by millions of users and you can go to sleep at night and not worry about the infrastructure, right? Because it's all running on chain, all the contracts are there, everybody has visibility into it. And if we had more of our services doing that powering defi, I would love it. I want to go to sleep at night and not worry about databases.
00:11:16.075 - 00:11:17.775, Speaker D: Hilmar, how do you think about this?
00:11:18.355 - 00:12:25.385, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully agree with Andrew. Why not, right? I think it used to be that, hey, it's actually really difficult to spin up your own chain and so why would you go through all the hassle of actually doing it? But these days you have providers like us that really focus on making it as easy as possible and abstracting all the complexity away. So why not, right? Why would you share? Like we look at rollups, layer 2s as verifiable servers and do you think you can scale the world like scale on chain to the world with a single server, like a couple of servers that everyone has to share? I think that's for me, not a realistic scenario. I believe in the hypothesis that you have that companies like KRAKEN actually have multiple chains eventually that can horizontally scale similar to how the Web two Internet scales. And so the more block space you can actually get, the better. And especially if it's straightforward for you and affordable to do, then why wouldn't you do it? Why would you share your block space with someone else where there are some random applications on that you actually don't want to interact with or you don't want to have on your chain? Right. I think that's, that's a big part.
00:12:25.385 - 00:13:02.077, Speaker B: And I think the big difference between now and let's say like the old L1 era that I personally believe is coming to an end or will will not get the same traction as let's say for example Ink Chain is that we have companies now launching chains that actually have users. Right. I'm talking about like a bitcoin based or like uni chain with Uniswap or Kraken and Inkchain. Right. They have real users that they can actually channel on chain. And the most important thing still is to grow the on chain user base. We have like 30 to 60 million users I think a 16Z's 2024 report.
00:13:02.221 - 00:13:02.945, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:03.765 - 00:13:15.167, Speaker B: And the centralized exchanges, they have a ton more probably. And so if they can funnel them on and help accelerate the adoption for on chain, this is just great. So the more, the more chains the.
00:13:15.191 - 00:13:25.007, Speaker D: Merry I believe more chains the merrier. Good for Gelato's business. Hilmar, can you explain that to me? You said Kraken could have multiple L2s. I don't think I understood that. Yeah.
00:13:25.071 - 00:13:32.375, Speaker B: So similar to how like Kraken today doesn't like we look at rollups as verifiable servers.
00:13:32.415 - 00:13:32.567, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:32.591 - 00:14:05.225, Speaker B: It's such that it's like you have a server where you can run some logic. The difference is that it's actually verifiable and trustless for other people to interact with. And you don't have to trust that the server logic is actually what the company claims it to be. But of course, similar to in Web2, Kraken doesn't run on a single server. Right. Kraken runs probably on a ton of servers that they can horizontally scale via like cloud providers or maybe they even build like their own data centers or something where they build technology to enable this. And this is what we are already seeing happening in web 3.
00:14:05.225 - 00:14:33.613, Speaker B: There are already applications where a single roll up just can't handle the load appropriately. And their applications or the ecosystems actually need to be sort of sharded. And this is what Ethereum's roadmap was eventually at the beginning as well. They don't have to shard Ethereum. Right. You need to shard the state and access to the state across multiple instances. And I believe in a couple of years Kraken will grow beyond the capabilities of what a single roll up can provide them today.
00:14:33.613 - 00:14:54.239, Speaker B: And so they will need to have a more sort of elastic web2 like scaling solution in my opinion. And so this goes a bit against sort of vertical, monolithic, hey, one chain that can scale to the world. I just don't believe in this. I think you will need to have multiple instances that are all interconnected and this is really what we are allowed to try to help build and help achieve all these projects.
00:14:54.407 - 00:14:55.795, Speaker D: What do you think, Andrew?
00:14:58.655 - 00:15:29.525, Speaker A: I think we're obviously like a long way away from that, but I definitely see that future. Right. Like you can imagine if we had all of our clients on chain right now, every single one of the millions, our current one could probably scale with that. With the limited, because we're going in mainnet in Q1 with the limited offering. It would probably work on that. But now if we're starting to decentralize the stack a little bit more and we're saying, okay, as we push more into defi, we need something that just handles authentication and maybe attestation. Right.
00:15:29.525 - 00:15:36.315, Speaker A: And that's happening all the time. And that's like one a piece of the stack that's interoperable with the others. I could see that being the future.
00:15:38.295 - 00:15:43.075, Speaker D: That's interesting. If you don't like that Kraken has one L2, just wait till they have multiple L2s.
00:15:43.655 - 00:15:46.695, Speaker A: How long we have tentacles, right? Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:15:46.775 - 00:15:53.759, Speaker D: Fits with the octopus. How long did it take to go from, hey, deciding like, you know what.
00:15:53.807 - 00:15:54.631, Speaker C: Let'S, let's do this.
00:15:54.663 - 00:15:58.275, Speaker D: We've got exec sign off like, let's make this happen to today.
00:16:02.415 - 00:16:37.527, Speaker A: Trying to think of the timelines, I think this was maybe eight months. I think a solid eight months. Some of the experimentation was before that earlier in the year, but I think like eight months of a timeline of really deciding on the super chain, deciding on launch partners and then working through all of the kind of complexities that it takes to make sure you have like the most cracked engineering team that you can get for protocol development and you know, having all the support that you need across like Discord and everything. It was, it was a big buildup.
00:16:37.591 - 00:17:03.045, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. How did you think about sequencing the launch of an L2? So you guys launched as soon as you Guys launched your wallet. That was the moment in time when I was like, oh, they're launching an L2 and there are obviously things that you have to, to do. I mean, you could like, you could have just launched the L2, then had a wallet, but probably not. It's obviously way better if you have the wallet because it's kind of accessible. Like, how did you think about sequencing this whole thing?
00:17:04.625 - 00:17:45.407, Speaker A: Yeah, this is an interesting question because Wallet is something that we always had in development. We wanted to make sure that we were providing again leaning into like crack and OG values. We wanted to make sure that we had our self custodial offering and it kind of was independent of the wallet for a while. It was just, you know, like, okay, we have these ideas of taking Kraken on chain. If we're going to do an L2, then we need to make sure that Wallet is very much plugged into that. So with this kind of, this move in making sure that Kraken is releasing Ink, you know, we're releasing that we have an L2 and then also Wallet is very intertwined with that. So the teams that I lead are the Ink team and then the Wallet team.
00:17:45.407 - 00:18:05.071, Speaker A: And we're going to be very joined at the hip and making sure that whatever we're doing on Ink goes into Wallet and Wallet into Ink, vice versa. So yeah, it was independent to the to start, but then, you know, it just made sense. Like why would, why would we be thinking of 4337 or something on Ink and ignore Wallet? They have to be joined.
00:18:05.183 - 00:18:16.635, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hilmar, how do you think about sequencing this for. I mean, zooming out from just Kraken? Like do you think there's a right way to sequence this? Is it like do you think folks also should have a wallet if they have an L2?
00:18:17.665 - 00:18:33.833, Speaker B: So for me, having a wallet and having users use like having a user base sort of off chain, plus having the chain yourself just provides you with immense superpowers. I think this is a pattern we are seeing a lot, right. With Uniswap Wallet.
00:18:33.889 - 00:18:36.497, Speaker D: Uniswap Uniswap launched Wallet base.
00:18:36.521 - 00:19:11.101, Speaker B: Right. Kraken and it just enables you to provide so much better features. Just think about the like you have a lot of users that have money stored on Kraken to like trade buy assets and they have their ether, their BTC there, right? And it provides them with like a pretty good like web2 like experience. They can log in with their email. They don't have to worry about private keys. There's custody involved, right? What Kraken? Like I'm not of course if I say something, I'm not speaking on behalf of Inc or Kraken. It's just like ideas that I have that I think are plausible.
00:19:11.101 - 00:19:56.001, Speaker B: For example, like why don't you allow the assets that are stored on your centralized exchange to be used on chain by basically being able to have much more control over like the block space, the DeFi wallet plus then also the centralized exchange of the custody solution. You can all intertwine this, right? And you can say like hey, even though my eth is on Kraken because I don't want to deal with private keys, etc. I can still use them to lend my money out on this lending market. Right. And this is just like the power that you get if you have a chain where your liquidity sits that you can front to users. The wallet that connects your off chain balances with your on chain account and has some signatures to verify this. And then of course the exchange where the custody is based.
00:19:56.001 - 00:20:02.761, Speaker B: So I think we will see more of this. And yeah, all of this together just provides you with these superpowers.
00:20:02.913 - 00:20:22.357, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree. It's a superpower. And I mean we will at Q1 be working very in the open. So cannot confirm or deny some of the things that Hilmar is saying maybe we are working on. But it'll all be out there in the open. You can just read the code. But it is a superpower.
00:20:22.357 - 00:20:51.035, Speaker A: And I think that being a part of the super chain, we're really not viewing the wallet as a super competitive thing. It's our portal, it's our tool that we're going to be leveraging our L2 with and in it we're going to be connecting to all of the other super chains too. We're not going to ignore anyone. We launched the wallet with base support and when we did launch it, we knew that we were joining the super chain at that time. So we wanted to make sure that it is that rising tide all ships and we're supporting everyone.
00:20:52.175 - 00:21:26.413, Speaker D: That's cool. That was actually going to be one of my questions, Andrew is are you going to do base support? So I like that. Maybe we can get into actually the slightly more technical side of things which is the decision to launch on the super chain. There's a really interesting like battle right now going on between I'd call it like the op stack and super chain. Arbitrum Orbit, Avalanche, L1s, Cosmos been around for a while. Obviously Zksync has the elastic chains. Someone's going to get mad at me because I'm forgetting them.
00:21:26.413 - 00:21:40.667, Speaker D: Initia, et cetera, et cetera. I love you if I forget you. How did you think about picking optimism here, Andrew? Did you guys do a full review of like ZK elastic chains and Avalanche and Cosmos and Arbitrary Orbit?
00:21:40.691 - 00:21:40.971, Speaker A: Did you.
00:21:41.003 - 00:21:47.135, Speaker D: Did you do that? Or you just were very close with Ben and optimism, like, what was the story here?
00:21:48.675 - 00:22:09.703, Speaker A: A little bit of all of it, honestly. Like, we knew the Optimism team, I think, pretty well. But like, on the technical side, we did try. We went through everyone, right? At one point we had an Arbitrum running with. Or Arbitrum Stack with the. I'm drawing a blank at the name right now. Stylus.
00:22:09.703 - 00:22:45.885, Speaker A: Sorry. We had Stylus running and we were allowing some of our internal Rust developers to make some stylus contracts. And it was a good kind of trial period of that. And that is powerful technology. We loved using it and being able to write some arbitrary contracts in Rust or import some crates that just needed a little bit of changing to be able to work on chain that was really cool to use. But ultimately it was the kind of immediate interoperability that Superchain was going for. And knowing that the network effects are extremely strong already and we would be a part of that kind of interoperable network that is going to be sharing liquidity.
00:22:45.885 - 00:22:53.725, Speaker A: So it really came down to the interoperability as the first ultimate decider on that.
00:22:54.065 - 00:23:16.889, Speaker D: Well, all of them are interoperable, right? Like, Arbitrum is interoperable with other Arbitrum things and elastic chain things are interoperable with other elastic chain things. When you say interoperable, do you just mean that they've had early success getting like, you know, unichain is there and basis chain base is there. So is it less about the technical side of being interoperable? It's more that they've had early. The network effects are kind of happening.
00:23:17.057 - 00:23:57.479, Speaker A: I think the network effects are already happening. And we had just had a lot of confidence and in the roadmap of that interoperability being there, like I've said before, like if we're executing a trade or a swap on Inc. And the user has no idea that you're tapping into liquidity of anything else on the Super Chain, I felt that that vision was pretty strong. And those kind of network effects that are going to increase that the most were on the Super Chain. And then also the kind of discussions that go on on the super chain, discussions about how do you. How do you have interoperability with the rest of the chains out there. So it's really cool to see that nobody's kind of ignoring anyone else.
00:23:57.479 - 00:24:08.035, Speaker A: Right. It's like nobody's kind of making their walled garden saying like super chain for super chain and nobody else. Everybody's thinking about the other interoperability with the other chains.
00:24:10.295 - 00:24:49.055, Speaker D: Who has the leverage in that negotiation, Andrew? Because if you look at the economics of something like this, let's use base, for example. Base obviously shares, you know, a certain percentage of its sequencer revenue. With the optimism treasury we have, I'm looking at our dashboard, it looks like They've earned like 2500, 2600 ETH in sequencer revenues from base since their launch. Yeah, about a year ago. So that's, you know, 2500 ETH from their sequencer revenues about a year ago. That's good money. Who had the, I guess maybe two part question is like, how do you think about that revenue split for you guys and then who has the leverage in that negotiation?
00:24:50.235 - 00:24:53.219, Speaker A: Well, I think it was a mutual agreement. I think it was, it was a.
00:24:53.227 - 00:24:55.283, Speaker D: Very all agreement end up being mutual.
00:24:55.459 - 00:25:34.349, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, for sure. But like I don't think anybody strong armed anybody into saying like we're getting, you know, we're not paying you a dime or something like that. It was, you know, we are using a really powerful stack that has, you know, an MIT license. And so like we, we are able to take that and you know, we have our super chain compliant thing. There's nothing preventing us from modifying it and doing something else on the side if we really wanted to do again like another L2 or even an L3 that's modified. We loved the freedom that that contract had for us. And so I think it's just, it's like almost paying a service fee for using some really awesome technology that again, we don't have to care about.
00:25:34.349 - 00:25:46.145, Speaker A: We, you know, we don't have to care about all the upgrades or like worry about managing our stack. It's just we get everything out of the box and I'm happy to have in the contract some kind of fee to be able to use that.
00:25:46.305 - 00:25:51.965, Speaker D: Did you ever think about just forking the OP stack instead of building on the super chain?
00:25:53.025 - 00:26:23.317, Speaker A: We did, but from a cost analysis I did not want to have 2030 protocol engineers always keeping up to date and doing all these changes to the protocol to make sure we're not introducing any vulnerabilities or playing catch up with the rest of the ecosystem. I wanted to make sure that we had a team that would just focus on the ux, the dapps, all the ability to bring Kraken users on chain and not have to worry about the intricacies of maintaining a blockchain.
00:26:23.461 - 00:26:29.477, Speaker D: Yeah Hilmar, you're nodding and smiling. Maybe we'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic too.
00:26:29.661 - 00:27:28.515, Speaker B: Yeah, I think forking the stacks doesn't really make sense. The question is why would you do it? Do you want to add some precompiles or something which at the end of the day mostly just gas saving to the. To to to your chain which arguably with like the upgrades in Ethereum with the A and Blobs is already pretty cheap from a variable cost perspective. So I think what is great about OP Stack and optimism is what Andrew mentioned is MIT license, open source. It's. I kind of, I kind of look at it as we have these sort of server standards that are being developed right now and do you want to like be on your own sort of version of Linux that like no one else is using or do you just want to like be able to be on the same standard and everyone else because you want to like we are building this, we are building Web3, right? We are building a new Internet and you want to be connected to everyone else. And as soon as you do your own thing and then it might not be as easy as you thought to be interoperable with all of them.
00:27:28.515 - 00:27:59.799, Speaker B: And so what OP I think very sort of objectively has, is network effects. They have right now some of the biggest names, some of the biggest chains, one of the like I argue, probably the biggest, biggest amount of liquidity on their ecosystem. And if you want to be part of this for now, I think joining the super chain makes a ton of sense long term. I believe every, all of these ecosystem will be interoperable. Right. Right now we are building these sort of like intranets kind of. We are in this phase similar to the Internet back then.
00:27:59.799 - 00:28:18.925, Speaker B: But I'm pretty certain and this is like ZK in my opinion eventually, right. All of these protocols will be interoperability with each other and so there will be a set of standards that will be used. Probably not one of them, but I'm pretty sure OP will be one of the primary ones. It's a good choice.
00:28:19.045 - 00:28:35.325, Speaker D: Hilmar and Yersi at Gelato, how much do you push people into or not push people like recommend where to go build. So do you like when you go to Andrew, did you say hey, you can use gelato and build anywhere or do you go, hey, you can use gelato, you can build anywhere. And by the way, we recommend op.
00:28:35.625 - 00:28:42.285, Speaker B: So we don't support all stacks and we won't support all stacks. Like we support the stacks that we believe in. Actually.
00:28:42.625 - 00:28:43.569, Speaker D: Who do you support?
00:28:43.697 - 00:29:14.631, Speaker B: Makes sense. So right now we only support OP Stack and Armgem Orbit Stack. There will be more stacks that we'll be supporting eventually, but they have to make sense from first principles for us. And we need to like, I don't want to run chains on stacks that in two years I believe won't be like the standard anymore. And then there need to be these gigantic migrations. So I would rather be upfront with the customer and say like, hey, use the stacks that actually make sense. And right now it comes down on a case by case basis.
00:29:14.631 - 00:29:47.995, Speaker B: I think for Andrew and the team, OP stake makes a ton of sense. Opinion is one of the most widely used ones. The network effects are great around the performance. It's not like something that you need to really squeeze out. Now for Ink Chain, you don't want to build like the largest perfect in the world probably as an app chain right now there. So it's fine if you want to go like super low latency, you want to service very low latency. Use cases then arbitrary right now offers very fast block times, for example, which are quite useful for this.
00:29:47.995 - 00:29:54.991, Speaker B: So it's always a case by case. It's always depends on what the customer really wants to build for Inc. I think OP made a ton of sense.
00:29:55.143 - 00:30:06.875, Speaker D: Yeah. Andrew, why did you guys pick Gelato instead of like I saw Alchemy has a roll up as a service platform. I saw Caldera has. Caldera is another conduit, is another. Why did you guys pick Gelato?
00:30:08.375 - 00:30:42.313, Speaker A: Simply the ease of use. But you know, in more detail. I think we always love in this whole journey exploring the stacks and everything, we always love this journey of meeting with the teams and kind of seeing how we're going to elevate each other. And Hilmar and his team were so open to wanting to work with us on tooling, work with us on support, basically asking anything that we need, they'll be there for us. And always had this line of communication open. So I think we honestly just fell in love with that instantly. Of this is going to be a really good partnership.
00:30:42.313 - 00:31:00.205, Speaker A: And then of course the ease of use. Anytime that the developers have had or needed a change or are deploying new test nets, you just click a button. I don't know, it's like it couldn't Be simpler. So I only see this relationship growing for many years. On hostingless.
00:31:03.985 - 00:31:23.235, Speaker D: Did you think about doing OP Stack or let's see, trying to get the terminology right. Did you think about opting into the super chain but not doing it through Gelato, doing it in house? Like I think my understanding is Base does it in house. Right. They don't go through Gelato or Caldera or Conduit or one of the roll up as a service providers. Did you think about doing this?
00:31:23.895 - 00:32:15.555, Speaker A: Yeah, we did. We did explore earlier, earlier in the year. But you know, as I again as I was kind of doing the cost analysis and like looking at like all the security and everything you got to put in place and the developers that I need to make sure that are basically full time maintaining this. I think it was actually when the first team we met with was Conduit and they were pretty accurate in saying that you need a full team, like a full infrastructure team 100% of the time on this without any dedication to any other projects. And so I initially had that in like, okay, as I'm showing this to executives and what we're going to have to do that was kind of always in the plan of like, I need this full team right here, I need the resources for it. But then all of that can just be offloaded and we can have more concentration on, like I said, the UX and the applications. And so we kind of abandoned that earlier in the year.
00:32:15.715 - 00:33:04.341, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe to chime in here as well, why it doesn't really make sense to run it in house. And I think the reason why Base does it because back then there was no good rollup as a service provider, I think, quite frankly. And that's why they didn't have a chance really. They didn't have another option from a cost point of view like you, you will always spend more if you do it in house. As you say, you need to build up an entire team that actually tracks all of this and then the question is like why would you do this right? If you want to then eventually take this infrastructure and service other roll ups as well and if you want to build your own roll up as a service business kind of right. Then it might make sense to actually do it right because you build up expertise and so on. But if that's not your primary business model, if your business model is something completely different, then there's just no way to justify the investment here.
00:33:04.341 - 00:33:26.035, Speaker B: And so I believe that we won't see any chains that launch by themselves in the future. Maybe just very Rarely due to, I don't know, maybe whatever political reasons, but just from a cost bank I ran for all the numbers. It doesn't make sense. It's also not that you give up any sort of sovereignty or something. Right. It's is something that you can always take in house eventually if you like to.
00:33:27.215 - 00:33:37.955, Speaker D: What, Andrew, what about the DA layer here? Is it just Ethereum, Ethereum or did you look at like Eigenlayer or Celestia or. Yeah. How do you think about the DA layer?
00:33:38.295 - 00:34:20.794, Speaker A: I think yeah, initially we explored everything to start. Celestia, Eigenlayer, everything. But we're kind of just going like the simple route for now with Ethereum as the da. But we are open to any kind of changes in the future. I think we don't really have a strong opinion on DA right now. However, the L3DA is where we eventually want to explore a little bit more and see, okay, could we have just the L2 as Ethereum, as DA and then L3s? We kind of have this more modular thing where you have celestia for 1L3. Or we encourage a team to use Celestia, we can encourage some other team to use RL2 or we encourage them to use, you know, some other DA out there.
00:34:20.794 - 00:34:24.662, Speaker A: I think, I think that's something fun to explore.
00:34:24.798 - 00:34:51.185, Speaker D: That's cool. Tell me how you think about INC versus Base and also like what you think Base has done a good job at and what you think. You know, you've got the hindsight of having, you know, they've been around for a year so you can, you can learn a lot of lessons. So what do you think that they. Maybe this is the wrong way to put it, but not what did they do wrong, but what could you do better than them?
00:34:52.885 - 00:35:46.273, Speaker A: So what Base is doing amazingly in massive respect to Jesse and the team. It's really fun to have watched them over the last year or two years. But yeah, the generalist approach I think is really, really cool because it really is just building anything on chain, like literally anything under the sun. But where we're taking it is more of a bottoms up approach instead of fully generalist of come build everything and make whatever it may be like your ice cream truck on chain or your dog walking service on chain or something like that. We want to focus on more of the specific defi use case. Take our decade and a half experience of centralized order books, get those things on chain, somehow make it so that on chain users can tap into that and vice versa. So we really want to make that Like a really good DeFi UX.
00:35:46.273 - 00:36:06.243, Speaker A: Reduce the number of clicks, make it super safe, make sure we have sequencer level security so that you know, people don't even know that rugs exist or don't even know that drainer contracts exist. That would be an absolute dream come true. So I think that like kind of hyper focus on the. The defi theme first is where we're going to take ours.
00:36:06.379 - 00:36:12.215, Speaker D: Nice. The last thing on the economics that I forgot to ask is what is your revenue split with optimism?
00:36:15.195 - 00:36:23.179, Speaker A: I don't know if I want to say Fair. You'll see it. I mean when the data starts getting there I think it'll be very.
00:36:23.227 - 00:36:42.601, Speaker D: I guess we'll see. Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll add you guys to. But we're starting to basically add. I don't know if you can here, I can zoom in a little bit. We're basically adding different chains on the super chain into this one aggregate super chain view. So you. Right now we have base Mode, Op, Main Net and Zora.
00:36:42.601 - 00:37:04.321, Speaker D: We need to add. I want to add crack, I want to add Inc. And then I want to add uni chain as well. But you can start to break down like the financials. Transaction fees by base, transaction fees breakdown, L1 expense by chain, gross margin. You can start to look at on chain activity and then you can start to actually break it down by dashboard. So yeah, we'll have to.
00:37:04.321 - 00:37:05.925, Speaker D: We'll have to get ink on here.
00:37:06.265 - 00:37:11.017, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it'll definitely be transparent there. So hang tight.
00:37:11.161 - 00:37:12.041, Speaker D: Cool. Cool.
00:37:12.113 - 00:37:15.985, Speaker B: And that's, that's the beauty of on chain stuff, right? It's all transparent.
00:37:16.065 - 00:37:17.257, Speaker D: Yeah, we will know.
00:37:17.321 - 00:37:19.153, Speaker B: You don't even need to ask Andrew anymore.
00:37:19.249 - 00:37:19.801, Speaker A: We will know.
00:37:19.833 - 00:37:27.425, Speaker D: Andrew, anything else in terms of base that you think they got where you think they might have missed the mark?
00:37:31.765 - 00:38:08.187, Speaker A: I don't know. Again, all of us internally don't really view it as competition. So we don't think that we're trying to dethrone anyone. We're just joining an ecosystem and doing it in our own way and bringing our users on chain. But you know, maybe it's the, you know, like I said on that hyper focus we want to make sure that some of the tooling we make really enables specific applications and maybe, you know, base is doing really well, that generalized tooling. So if we have the one click thing where you can just like spin up a template on a specific application, then that's. I think that's where we're going to do.
00:38:08.211 - 00:38:22.865, Speaker D: Well, nice. Yeah, that's actually what I was going to ask you next was about developer tooling. Like they have obviously pushed they did Coinbase Wallet, then Base and then now they're pushing really heavily into developer tooling. Is that where you guys think you'll go next or is there a different variation on that?
00:38:23.885 - 00:39:05.835, Speaker A: Yeah, we definitely will. Like leading up to Mainnet we are going to get a lot of tooling out there but like I said it is going to be very focused. I think it'll have a lot more ties to Kraken and its infrastructure and like I said trying to bridge that off chain to on chain world. So again like the order book centralized liquidity to on chain and then the authentication layer and maybe some attestation right. I think our tooling will be very focused on those parts of the stack and allowing people again to have good templates and cursor repl it for defi applications which could be like charts like a swap screen or a perpetual future screen or options. Whatever it is.
00:39:07.745 - 00:39:38.871, Speaker C: Skale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier. Skale has solved this problem with a gas free scalable infrastructure where users never pay gas fees. Skale was awarded the most active gaming chain in 2023 by CoinGecko and hosts five of the top 25 games on Dapper Radar. You should definitely check out Skale. I was using it the other day. It really is incredible to use that's scale spelled with a K.
00:39:38.871 - 00:40:35.267, Speaker C: Hit the link in the show notes or head on over to scale Space slash ecosystem to get started today. Let's face it, building on crowded L1s or expensive L2s is just not going to unlock the next generation of applications in crypto. That's where Super Containers come in, offering a completely new solution that transforms your development control. Imagine dedicated customizable app spaces running on Supra's 500k TPS layer one blockchain. You get complete control over gas tokens and fees with the freedom to use your own token, create local fee markets, or even go gasless, scale on demand and build with better customization than app chains, all at a fraction of the cost. Plus, with multivm compatibility, you can easily deploy your EVM Move and SVM smart contracts. It's time to rescue your projects from the costs, complexities and fragmentation of traditional solutions.
00:40:35.267 - 00:41:26.527, Speaker C: Get notified when Super Containers are ready for builders@super.com containers hey everyone, Jason here. I'm excited to tell you About MEATH Protocol Meath is a permissionless and non custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum and governed by Mantle. Meath is now the fourth largest LST with $1.3 billion in TVL and there are two assets releasing soon in late October and November, CM ETH and Cook, and I'm going to tell you all about them. CM Eth is a liquid restaking token and it will launch in season two, allowing users to easily participate in restaking and earn Cook rewards. Cook is the governance token of Meath Protocol which will allow holders to play a pivotal role in directing the strategic future of the protocol.

00:42:04.725 - 00:42:46.125, Speaker C: Earlier in today's episode, I mentioned Ledger's latest products, the Stacks and Flex, and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them. These wallets feature the world's first secure touchscreens, which don't just simplify your digital transactions, but also keep them extremely safe. These wallets are virtually impenetrable to online attacks because they store your private key in a secure offline chip. You can manage more than 5,500 tokens and install up to 100 apps, choose the most trusted name in hardware wallets and take control control of your digital security today@ledger.com or hit the link in the description of today's episode to check out their latest wallets.
00:42:48.065 - 00:43:08.645, Speaker D: I mean you. You guys are obviously amazing, like world class at building trading things, trading experiences, institutional trading experiences, prosumer retail. Will you take some of that experience and start to build your own apps on on Ink? Like your own trading apps or. Yeah. How do you think about actually building up the app layer here?
00:43:09.265 - 00:43:53.815, Speaker A: I think initially we're not going to, you know, go straight into like say we have a team that's building an app that they deploy on Chain and then it's like something incubated by by Kraken. I use the word incubator there because we do. We are setting an Incubator up where we're going to be working with teams that maybe don't have a home yet and they're kind of early stage and they want to get in on a fresh ecosystem with some tooling that we can help them out with and we'll be helping fund those and that's the incubator that they can be a part of. They can get into our channels and we'll be right there with them. I think it would be maybe six months or a year down the line where we might want to actually focus on some our actual applications and deploying those on chain.
00:43:54.235 - 00:43:56.535, Speaker D: Nice. What do you think that could look like?
00:43:58.615 - 00:44:09.743, Speaker A: I don't really know. That could be. That could be our own Dex. It could be something that has to do more with consumer. Not ready to say yet.
00:44:09.879 - 00:44:38.245, Speaker D: Okay, okay, I'll take the. I don't know as I do know but I'm not ready to share it. I'll rephrase, I'll rephrase for you. What does it mean to be Defi focused? Because there's a, there's a marketing and a cultural thing of being defi focused which is like, hey, BD team should like get Defi people to come build. But there's actually a technical aspect too. Like you can start to do things. I don't know what's the thing that would make it more friendly to Defi? You could enshrine oracles.
00:44:38.245 - 00:44:56.035, Speaker D: You could do something like enshrining like oracles like Atlas did. Right. That actually technically does make it more friendly for Defi to come build there. So how do you think about the. That from a cultural and BD perspective. But actually more importantly, I'm kind of interested in the technical side of focusing on defi.
00:44:56.695 - 00:45:25.525, Speaker A: Yeah. From the, from the BD perspective of course that's like, you know, outreach to everything that is out there to make sure that, you know, they have a nice and easy home to be able to deploy their stack. And so like you know, you need that, you need that liquidity on your chain. But again, super chain and interoperability. Hopefully, you know, you don't have to worry about like every single protocol going over to your chain in the future. But you know, it's kind of the. We're doing a lot of experiments on cross chain intents right now.
00:45:25.525 - 00:45:52.863, Speaker A: So 7683 standard. We want to make sure that we have really good documentation and you know, we're leaning into that. There's everything, all the advancements with 7702, anything that requires so many different steps in defi. Um, that requires a lot of actions by the user. We want to reduce that friction too. So leaning into, leaning into 7702 I think helps with that. Um, I, I think that's.
00:45:52.863 - 00:46:02.111, Speaker A: That, you know, any of the other things. Again, like, we're kind of shy with this initial announcement, but then the moment we go to testnet and mainnet, there's. There's a lot more on the way.
00:46:02.263 - 00:46:03.995, Speaker D: Yeah. When are those dates?
00:46:04.575 - 00:46:18.079, Speaker A: Testnet is November 11th, right at Devcon, we have a hacker house on that day. And then mainnet is early Q1. It could accelerate too, depending on how ambitious and how many late nights we want.
00:46:18.207 - 00:46:27.395, Speaker D: Let's go. Love it. Accelerate, Andrew, Accelerate. Hilmar, how many L2s do you think launch in the next several months?
00:46:28.535 - 00:46:29.375, Speaker B: What is the.
00:46:29.495 - 00:46:30.143, Speaker D: Hundreds.
00:46:30.239 - 00:46:30.855, Speaker A: Hundreds.
00:46:30.935 - 00:46:53.055, Speaker B: Let's go hundreds. Like we already seen like in production. We'll see until the end of the year. Right. But I think it will eventually will come to a point where every bigger application will. Like right now what is happening is that a lot of the bigger. All of the bigger Web three applications that you know, today, they will have their own chain.
00:46:53.055 - 00:47:50.515, Speaker B: This is already obvious to me. You just need to read the forums and read between the lines and tweets of farmers and stuff. Right? This is already happening with every single larger application. And what is now happening is we're seeing Web2 organizations, or like I say, centrist exchanges that are very crypto native, like Kraken for example, they are now also coming on chain. This is actually what I'm most excited about because they bring new users to the ecosystem that they already have, which are crypto trained. And then I think we will eventually go to a point where we actually have non crypto focus tech companies join in, non crypto focused finance companies come and join. And we see it with BlackRock, of course, not with their own chain right now, but they are experimenting and we are already in talks with some other really big enterprises that are thinking about doing it that we cannot talk about, but they're like some of the biggest tech companies in the world that are thinking about it.
00:47:50.515 - 00:47:58.305, Speaker B: So I'm pretty certain we will maybe not over the next three months, but over the next year or so. See tremendous uptick in this.
00:48:01.165 - 00:48:44.545, Speaker A: I think it'll be like, yeah, we'll definitely see like BlackRock and NASDAQ and Dow Jones, like all these places. You know, I hope this isn't like just like complete bullish optimism. But I do hope in 10 years like, it is just like every single big company out there has their own L2 or has their own chain in some format. And there's so much more of our, like, online activity that's happening on chain, even beyond finance. And then, you know, I think, I don't know if you don't mind, like, Hilmar, I do have a question on rollups as a service. Did you see competition in Google or AWS? Do you think there's RAs is coming out from bigger players?
00:48:45.365 - 00:49:15.411, Speaker B: It would make sense, of course, right? Like, if I would be Google, if I would be Vercel or. Or AWS or something. This should be on their radar eventually. Of course. The question is, do they want to build themselves? Do they want to acquire? Do they want to. What is their game plan here? I think it will be very difficult for them to be as cutting edge as kind of like we are, that are literally in the trenches building and contributing to the stacks ourselves. We are contributing to the UP stack, for example, contributing to other stacks.
00:49:15.411 - 00:49:34.979, Speaker B: So it takes a lot of expertise, I think, to be ahead of the curve. And things are changing so rapidly. You mentioned they're like five stacks, right? Like, how do you want to deal with that? So I do believe it is inevitable for them. They have to come in eventually, but. Yeah, let's see. And what sort of form they will enter. I think that's interesting.
00:49:35.147 - 00:49:36.255, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:49:37.155 - 00:49:56.365, Speaker D: I think that will happen sooner rather than later. By the way, one of those people that you mentioned, I think will do that. Andrew, can you. I know Hilmar's pitch to me. Hilmar gave me the pitch of permissionless, that Block Works should have an L2. And he then went and built a Blockworks L2 on Gelato, which I. Which I haven't used at all.
00:49:56.365 - 00:50:13.971, Speaker D: But it was good, good marketing made for a good tweet. Andrew, do you think so? You said that all the. All these big organizations will have L2s. I would agree with you. If they. If they move money in some way, like, I understand that vision. If they move money or they trade or they have assets somewhere.
00:50:13.971 - 00:50:15.967, Speaker D: But someone like Blockworks, like, there's no.
00:50:15.991 - 00:50:17.167, Speaker C: Money moving through our platform.
00:50:17.231 - 00:50:27.075, Speaker D: There's like, there's like words and audio and stuff like that. Why would. Why should. Why should Block works have an L2? Or do you think that we should not have an L2?
00:50:29.295 - 00:50:47.835, Speaker A: What. What's the biggest, you know, like, so you said audio and video, you know, like it's. It's all like, production. Like, what do. What would your users Want. If you said right now, like, we're doing an L2, do you think you would just get, like, a terrible reaction? Like, why? Like, what am I going to do with it?
00:50:48.415 - 00:51:00.183, Speaker D: I mean. I mean, I think we would get an amazing reaction because everybody wants. I mean, I've. I've probably had a thousand people try to. They would. They would be excited, but for the wrong reason. They want Blockworks to have a token.
00:51:00.183 - 00:51:05.247, Speaker D: So the number of people who want Blockworks to have a token, so they'd be, I think, excited about that.
00:51:05.311 - 00:51:08.195, Speaker B: Like, give them what they want. Give them what they want.
00:51:08.295 - 00:51:25.535, Speaker D: But there's nothing to do on chain. Like, there's no. There's no thing on chain. So it honestly feels like. I mean, everyone pitched us in 2018 to do in early 2018 and in 2017, but, well, before we. That was really before we had Blockworks. But, like, everyone wanted us to do an ICO.
00:51:25.535 - 00:51:33.099, Speaker D: And then we're like, obviously we're not doing an ICO. And then it was like, in 2021, it's like, are you going to launch a token? We're like, we're not launching a token. And now it feels like, are you.
00:51:33.107 - 00:51:33.722, Speaker C: Going to launch an L2?
00:51:33.772 - 00:51:35.735, Speaker D: Well, we're not going to launch an L2.
00:51:38.115 - 00:52:08.729, Speaker A: So, I mean, there could be just like, the governance structure of it. I mean, that's like one, like, you know, that is influenced by a token. So, like, you've already obviously explored that in the, you know, our distant past of the ICO era. But, you know, it's like, I love the. Like I said earlier with Hayden's comment of, like, infrastructure, you don't have to care about. It's just on chain. So even beyond the finance and everything that, like, user authentication and, like, kind of social aspect of it.
00:52:08.729 - 00:52:38.905, Speaker A: So if Black Works or blackworks was more moving into, like, anything that has to do with social, or like, you want to socialize some more of your content into, like, your own ecosystem and your own chain, where, like, profiles, like, evolve over time based on, like, how people are interacting with your content and products. I could see it being something that maybe you launch and it's like, okay, now let's see where we can take this, right? Let's do some social stuff. Let's get some of our user authentication on there.
00:52:39.925 - 00:52:40.829, Speaker D: Yeah, okay.
00:52:40.957 - 00:53:27.467, Speaker B: Maybe to add to that for me, roll ups. I see rollups today as sort of like extensions of companies that enable also other people to access either the user base or some sort of IP or unique value from that company. And do something with it. For example, in the case of, let's say a base or Kraken, what you have is you have a ton of users. You have order flow, you have people that want to, that are willing to buy and sell assets and you can redirect them to an ecosystem where then other people can come in and they can use this liquidity in this order flow that is directed to this chain to then build cool applications that actually leveraged that. Right. Pudgy Penguin chain.
00:53:27.467 - 00:54:05.239, Speaker B: What is abstract or something, Right? Do they need a chain? They have ip, right? They will probably want to take this IP and make it available for builders and say like, okay, Cook, let's see what you come up with. With my lp, you can rent it, you can pay me for it, you can build a game with it. You can do this. So you guys are probably more on the IP side. Like you own probably ip. You generate ip, you generate content. Can you make this content accessible to people? Can people rent this content, borrow this, pay for it and remix it and do something with it that you can benefit? If that's the case, I think then there might actually be a use case.
00:54:05.239 - 00:54:12.351, Speaker B: Right. But if you don't have that, of course, at some point not everyone has to have a chain in the next couple of years, but I think there can be use cases.
00:54:12.543 - 00:54:36.965, Speaker D: Somehow I've walked myself into a sales pitch from Helmar, so I'm going to pivot back to, to ink here. Andrew, how do you. How do you think about the INC token or a future token? So base has obviously not had a token. I believe that one day they will have a token, even though they keep saying they're not doing a token. I'm curious how you think about this.
00:54:39.105 - 00:54:58.685, Speaker A: So no, no plans at this time for any kind of token. I, you know, we've always, like, just thought about it, like in the exploration and experiment experimentation phase, like, what would it look like if we did have one? But, you know, that was definitely shelved and there's no plans.
00:55:01.265 - 00:55:17.235, Speaker D: Why not? Like, is that only a. Obviously your lawyer said to say that, like, that is a, you know, you know. But like, why actually, why not? Is it 100% because of the regulation and the legal side? Like, let's say there are no regulators in this world. Would you launch a token?
00:55:18.415 - 00:56:02.519, Speaker A: 100%, I think it would be a lot of fun to do. I think, I think you absolutely could do some fun things with like your own token and doing some kind of native yield with it or, you know, like having governance and all. The things that, you know, you've done with tokens in the past, but the. Yeah. I think that we have to see what happens with the regulatory side and everything on, you know, the elections coming up in the U.S. and then fortunately, there's a lot of clarity coming around the world, like with Mika in Europe and everything. But I think it's way easier to just build something and create a really good L2 with good UX and not worry about that side because it does get really complex.
00:56:02.519 - 00:56:10.235, Speaker A: And I could see us having an easier path to it sometime in the future, but right now it's just not even on our minds.
00:56:10.815 - 00:56:16.955, Speaker D: Were there conversations about how doing this. The pros and cons of doing this in relationship to a crack in ipo?
00:56:20.355 - 00:56:23.295, Speaker A: Hmm. Like, if there's conflicts.
00:56:24.715 - 00:56:35.235, Speaker D: Yeah. Like maybe public market investors don't like that. You guys have a chain. It's confusing. It skews the messaging. It's not as clear of a. Of a.
00:56:35.235 - 00:56:36.255, Speaker D: Of a message.
00:56:36.915 - 00:57:02.795, Speaker A: I think the. The feedback that I know that we've gotten from, you know, the board or other kind of tangential, like, cracking in investors is that this is really. This is us, like, pushing the company further. So it's like, I don't think there's any kind of conflict of. Conflict of interest with our current products and user base. It's just another offering. It's another, you know, networking avenue for cracking clients to experience more of the ecosystem and hopefully, you know, more of our ecosystem.
00:57:02.795 - 00:57:11.111, Speaker A: So I haven't seen any kind of, like, you know, conflict on, like, does it cannibalize anything or vampire attacks or anything like that.
00:57:11.243 - 00:57:33.959, Speaker D: Yeah. How do you think maybe you could tell me the rest of, like, your thoughts on the rest of the, like, synergy between Kraken's business and Inc. So two. Two of the things that I was thinking about are, I mean, you guys have, like, interesting stuff happening on the bitcoin front. And then you also have interesting stuff. I mean, you guys have always dominated the staking space. I forget the company that you guys acquired back in the day, I think it was called Stake.
00:57:33.959 - 00:57:56.031, Speaker D: Yeah. So today you have. I should have pulled up our staking dashboard. Probably like a. I'd guess roughly a million eth staked on the platform, give or take a couple hundred thousand. I'd guess you guys are probably third biggest exchange in terms of amount staked. Probably top seven to 10 in terms of, like, total platforms with stake on it.
00:57:56.031 - 00:58:07.055, Speaker D: How do you. Maybe we can start there. Like, how do you think about this intersection of staking and now you have the wallet and now you and you have this big centralized platform and now you have the chain. Like how does that come together?
00:58:08.155 - 00:59:04.125, Speaker A: I think the dream that I've always had ever since starting this project like over a year ago was how do we make sure that every single product at Kraken eventually with enough education and ability to use a really easy to use chain, every single product or every single PRD has some on chain component to it. So if somebody's thinking of some traditional finance type thing that we are building and integrating, there better be a nice big section in research of on chain in that prd. And I think for staking specifically, this is a really awesome team of people building out ink in the wallet and all the tooling around that. And they're going to be providing a ton of education because we have amazing talent all across Kraken. Some people maybe haven't used anything on chain before. So we want to make sure that the whole company is plugged into that. And so things with staking that we just did kbtc, our first wrapped token.
00:59:04.125 - 00:59:35.385, Speaker A: I think we want to leverage the talent we have on Inc to kind of have that bridge with the exchange and say what else can we wrap? What other maybe liquid staking tokens can we do? What kind of yield opportunities can we provide on some of the things that we have on our centralized platform? And it's all those kinds of things as we're setting this up is all in experimentation and kind of like early discovery phase. But INC has a very large kind of influence being able to educate and spawn these kind of new ideas in different domains.
00:59:37.285 - 00:59:59.845, Speaker D: How do you think about the other side, which is the bitcoin side. I'd also be curious to get both your guys take on just like zooming out from just crack and bitcoin defi and this whole bitcoin renaissance and the Bitcoin L2s that are happening. But maybe Andrew, if you want to start with how that intersects with Inc and then I'd love both of your guys take Hilmar included on just. Yeah, this whole bitcoin renaissance, I think.
01:00:00.305 - 01:00:40.677, Speaker A: Okay, really quick personal views on it is. And they shouldn't cloud what's going to be popular because I could just have the unpopular opinion is I want bitcoin to ossify and I don't want the protocol touched because I love myself and my friends being able to maximize the wealth as much as possible with bitcoin and then I don't really want that touched. Right. I love that the Other networks are doing a lot of experimentation. You have Ethereum that has, you know, compute on it and everything. And that's like where, you know, you can do more things than you could do on bitcoin. But with the renaissance and everything, obviously more power to people if they're doing, you know, neat things with it.
01:00:40.677 - 01:01:17.205, Speaker A: I view how it intersects with inc. Is we do have our L2 it is on the super chain, but we're not going to ignore any other chain out there. Like we're, we're already doing a little bit of experiments on like, how are we going to be ensuring that our intents are, you know, going to be working with Solana and then if like bitvm and all that with bitcoin takes off and gets more popular? We don't want to ignore any of that. You know, of those top chains and of those experimentations, we are always going to at least, you know, allocate some, you know, fun like exploration time every month to make sure that we're not falling behind on any of those innovations.
01:01:19.025 - 01:01:22.685, Speaker D: Hilmar, what do you think about all the bitcoin renaissance, Bitcoin eco stuff?
01:01:23.785 - 01:02:36.403, Speaker B: Yeah, so of course I should be biased towards more L2s and stuff, but I am mostly bearish on most of the Bitcoin L2s that I'm seeing out there. It makes sense if you want to bootstrap an ecosystem and you believe that you can get a community rallied around your sort of ecosystem, your chain, your ecosystem, and you pick pinpoint, like bitcoin around it and they say, okay, this is bitcoin focused and we want to get all the bitcoiners on here, I think that makes sense. But trying to shoehorn a roll up into bitcoin as like probably the most inefficient data availability layer out there is just not something that I think I find intuitively interesting. And I don't think it makes a ton of sense. I think it's motivated by the wrong reasons of mostly funded by like big mining operators that want to see some sort of use of bitcoin and they want to pump their liquidity in there and then, I don't know, rally to TVLA for some chains and so on. So I think there are a lot of misaligned incentive in these and I still have yet to see an interesting and compelling pitch actually that makes me bullish on it. So, yeah, I'm not that crazy.
01:02:36.479 - 01:02:38.415, Speaker A: You wouldn't. You went in for the kill shot.
01:02:41.515 - 01:02:50.735, Speaker D: Andrew's too polite. Cool, Andrew. Anything else that we're missing on. On Inc. Just that.
01:02:51.075 - 01:03:12.371, Speaker A: I mean, we are recording this, like, as launching, right? So incong.com inconclaim is the Twitter. And you know, we have that hacker house on November 11th. That's when we launched Testnet. So, like, go RSVP sign up if you're in Devcon. We'd love to meet you. And this is beautiful.
01:03:12.371 - 01:03:14.211, Speaker A: We spent so much time doing this design.
01:03:14.283 - 01:03:15.659, Speaker D: This is such a nice landing page.
01:03:15.707 - 01:03:41.985, Speaker A: I love this for this vibe and this look. Just for some internals on this, we had many weeks of this really cool art critique session where we were all getting really philosophical with it, where each of us had 10 minutes to share what images made you feel and all that. It felt like we were all in art school. It was amazing. Even the engineers, they were opening up and, like, getting their kind of thoughts out there how we wanted this to look. It was such a fun process.
01:03:42.485 - 01:03:49.025, Speaker D: What is this design called? These little blobs. Like, what's the backstory of this? What's the backstory of the design? How'd you pick this?
01:03:50.085 - 01:04:11.255, Speaker A: Internally, we call it the Morpheus. So it's the Morpheus Blob. But it's really like, you know, we. When we came up with ink, it was always like, you know, the tagline kind of like ink, ink the future. Be able to like, you know, ink your transactions on chain. You can, you know, create anything you want with ink. You can make art, you can write things.
01:04:11.255 - 01:04:29.269, Speaker A: So naturally, we just kind of evolved it into like, okay, ink isn't just for writing and drawing. You can also, like, splatter it. You can just be as creative as you want with it. Right? It's like the pen is mightier than the sword of the old, you know, old days. I think that's. That's what we got here. And, you know, it's.
01:04:29.269 - 01:04:32.625, Speaker A: It's a form, it's a blob. You can do so many things with it.
01:04:33.085 - 01:04:41.957, Speaker D: It's very like liquid metal. Yeah. Kind of like Terminator 2. Like the.
01:04:42.101 - 01:04:50.065, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to click dark mode, though. Like, there's. It's down in the lower left on your screen. You got to click that too. And it's. It's pretty.
01:04:50.375 - 01:05:17.585, Speaker D: Where do you see it? Very pretty. All right, go check it out. Inkonchain.com, if you're listening on the podcast and you're like, why are these guys talking about this? Okay, maybe we can wrap with a prediction which is in five years. And Hilmar, this is a Kraken related question. But Hilmar ask you this as well. In five years, what percentage of the of Kraken's trading volume will come from on chain verse from the centralized exchange?
01:05:19.525 - 01:05:31.541, Speaker A: Geez, it's hard to give like specific numbers. I can definitely give my hope. Is that okay? It's close to 100%. And you know, it's like, what's your.
01:05:31.573 - 01:05:39.945, Speaker D: What'S your realistic prediction like? And you know, this is, this is Andrew's opinion, not Kraken's. All the disclaimers and all that kind of stuff. What is your prediction?
01:05:40.405 - 01:06:11.905, Speaker A: I would love it if, you know, taking a step back on just like users, if it was like 5 to 10% of our users a year to 2 years from now are using the ink chain and they are, you know, they have really easy rails to get on from the Kraken platform. I would love to see. You said five years, right? I would love to see like a 20% on chain at least in five years. I know that's a little like may sound pessimistic, but to me that would be, that would be amazing if it was more than that. Great.
01:06:13.245 - 01:06:16.311, Speaker B: I'm a bit bullish. I think 10% is right now.
01:06:16.396 - 01:06:20.583, Speaker D: Dex versus sex volume in general, I think 14% today.
01:06:20.668 - 01:06:52.911, Speaker B: 14% today. I'm hopeful that for me, what are the bottlenecks really? Scalability is a huge bottleneck. Having order books and stuff on chain is just not feasible. Also today on Ink Chain, it won't be feasible to just have everything come on chain. And five years from now, I'm pretty, pretty hopeful that this will actually be the case. So I think the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages of really not having it. So I think probably even 70%, 80% I could see in general, I think C5 dex dex sex volumes.
01:06:52.911 - 01:06:55.495, Speaker B: And I think for you guys it will be, will be the same.
01:06:55.655 - 01:07:16.787, Speaker D: I'm more in Hill Mar's camp, by the way. So we went from zero percent. So when did Dexes start? I mean, you could say it's like let's call it April, May 2020, when like we started to get actual volumes. Obviously there was like 2017, but like real volumes on Dexes. Like what? April, May 2020. Today we're at 14%. I would guess we ripped through 20% this cycle.
01:07:16.787 - 01:07:21.055, Speaker D: I would, I would guess we could end this cycle even above 25%.
01:07:21.635 - 01:08:03.527, Speaker A: Yeah, I could. I mean overall, I can definitely see after the cycle, like overall it's 20% for Kraken, like a little bit of, a little bit of insight. On like, you know, if you have old deposit addresses that come from like say 2015 and you rotate them and you kind of expire them for old clients and you say like, you know, go ahead and grab a new address in 2024, people will still deposit, you know, to the old addresses that have been expired. And so we, we still maintain that infrastructure. So you can do that. So nothing against, you know, like the grandma that's still like doing that. But like, I should be a little bit more, I think, optimistic that people will kind of go on chain.
01:08:03.527 - 01:08:13.355, Speaker A: And it's just like, that's why we got to make that good ux, the good dev tools, the good education, and just make it so that hopefully users don't even know they're going on chain.
01:08:13.855 - 01:08:34.303, Speaker B: I think it will be pricing, right? So if you get on chain, better pricing that you get on your centralized exchange and you have like KYC AML figured out, like your user will be prompted with, hey, do you want to do on chain? They shouldn't even be prompted, right? They should just like get the best price. And if the best price is actually on chain versus off chain, then I think the order should get on chain.
01:08:34.479 - 01:08:36.343, Speaker A: That's easy. Yeah. Market wins.
01:08:36.479 - 01:08:56.347, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can even see like the sexes take more. I pulled up this dashboard of the staking providers after I asked that question, and you can actually. The interesting line item here, I think is. Or the column is eth earned. So you guys have actually earned the fourth most ETH from this.
01:08:56.347 - 01:09:36.145, Speaker D: But like Figment, Kiln, Ether Fi have more eth staked on their, on their pools than you guys, but they've earned way less eth. And I think the reason for that is like, there's these. And like rocket Pool. I was going to say the reason for this is because there's the decentralized platforms take lower fees than sexes. So you're basically paying. Today there's a premium that the sexes can take for security because it feels safer to hold your money with Kraken than it does to move on chain. But I think that security premium ultimately trends down to zero over the next several years.
01:09:36.645 - 01:09:42.221, Speaker A: I think so, yeah. I think that's. That's why, that's why we're kind of keeping security as a top theme too. So like, if we.
01:09:42.253 - 01:09:43.621, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, if we can bring our.
01:09:43.653 - 01:09:49.243, Speaker A: Talent to make sure that ink chain feels like you're using a centralized exchange, then you know you've won.
01:09:49.379 - 01:10:00.067, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's smart, Andrew. I know it's a busy day Congrats on the launch, Hilmar. Congrats on helping Kraken with this and making it possible. And yeah, thanks to both of you guys for coming on the show.
01:10:00.251 - 01:10:01.291, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
01:10:01.443 - 01:10:02.135, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:10:02.875 - 01:10:22.165, Speaker C: Hey everyone, thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly thank today's title sponsor, Skale. Skale really is one of the best chain experiences out there today. And I've used so many different chains. There's a reason they are gaining so much adoption in both gaming and AI use cases. Hit the link in the show notes to explore the scale ecosystem.
