00:00:00.280 - 00:00:16.726, Speaker A: No distressed firms are willing to work on crypto. It's like yourselves, like, no event companies are willing to work on crypto. Like, there's too much reputational damage. Like, they don't know about crypto. They don't. They think crypto is bullshit or whatever. Sorry, now I cursed in your pod.
00:00:16.726 - 00:00:28.274, Speaker A: But. So it was like, it was like, greenfield, you know, it's like if you can make it professional and you can jump in the space, like, the incumbents will basically just leave it for you to do.
00:00:30.374 - 00:00:59.314, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by circle, the issuer of USDC, which hopefully, as you all know, is the preferred stablecoin of digital natives and crypto natives with over 1.5 million holders globally. You'll hear more about USDC later in the show. Welcome back. Yeah, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have Thomas. I don't really know exactly what Thomas does, except that he is the best investor who invests, like, the intersection of distressed.
00:00:59.314 - 00:01:16.550, Speaker B: Distressed asset investing and crypto have known Thomas for years. Got connected with Thomas, maybe, I want to say 2018, possibly Thomas or 2017 through some, like, mount Gox claims stuff, and I've just kept in touch since. So, Thomas, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:01:16.702 - 00:01:36.434, Speaker A: Dude. Thanks, Jason. Thanks for having me on. And, like, I don't know how we met. I think I just showed up at Locksburg event and I explained myself and you were like, oh, that's kind of cool. I remember early on you were asking me about, ah, that makes sense. You asked me about your business and I can't remember if you guys ever raised VC money, but you asked me if you should raise VC money and I said no.
00:01:36.434 - 00:01:39.054, Speaker A: I don't know what happened. What did you decide?
00:01:39.134 - 00:01:42.406, Speaker B: We took your advice. We took your advice. We never raised my hand.
00:01:42.470 - 00:01:55.234, Speaker A: That's great. I wasn't sure. I was like, honestly, I'm talking against my own book here, but you should know, I'm sure you spoke to a million people. I was like, if you can make the cash flow from the vend business, like, don't.
00:01:55.694 - 00:02:12.022, Speaker B: Yeah. All because of you, my friend. So, anyways, I think it'd be a helpful place to start. I want to. Obviously, I'm sure we'll end this conversation talking about FTX, but there are a lot of other distressed assets in crypto, starting with Mount Gox. There's also stuff around Celsius. I think it'd be helpful to just get a lay of the land.
00:02:12.022 - 00:02:26.504, Speaker B: I know very little about this topic, so I'm going to ask some really, really dumb five year old questions here. And I think, let's start off with the easiest one, which is just like, what is distressed investing? And is that even the best characterization of what you do?
00:02:26.804 - 00:03:14.850, Speaker A: Yeah. So I work for a large family office, principally, that's my principal job, trying to deploy their capital. They have, of course, final investment decision, and they really control the strings. But I have my own company, which is 507. So what does 507 do? We do that, and we also, like, try to broker and, you know, not really act as bankers, but basically facilitators of deals in the distressed world and I guess sort of special situation capital raising. So what does that mean? It generally means, I think it's better to characterize a special situation investing. You have this intersection of when companies are need capital and what's going on in the markets, and you have banks that won't touch it, and then you sort of, you get in no man's land.
00:03:14.850 - 00:04:05.934, Speaker A: The no man's land is where we normally operate, where there's no dearth of capital. And you sort of have to figure things out from a first principles perspective, and that's distressed. I mean, you look at Howard Marks and Oak Tree and the memos he writes and other people like Seth Klarman at Baupost or even Warren Buffett. But Warren Buffett sort of is probably a bit more just totally in the value camp, and they're all kind of flavors of value. And as someone rightly said, all intelligent investing is value investing. Just like, what's your definition of value? I think due to stress person, it's normally, like, very asset driven, very balance sheet driven, and also very opportunistic. So the fun part about distress and special situation investing is you're always learning about new areas.
00:04:05.934 - 00:04:49.230, Speaker A: And for myself, it was the same I came into to distress crypto through Mac ox. And for me, as someone who has nothing to add to the world, I would think that the intersection of distressed and crypto is kind of like a unique and interesting area where there's a ton of unsettled case law and it's a growing industry. I always thought there would be cycles in crypto because it's such a cyclical thing. If you look at the whatever, if you look at, like, plan B's models, you know, the stock to flow models or anything, like, it's hugely volatile. And so that all that volatility comes a lot of full cycles, the full cycles lead distress cycles.
00:04:49.382 - 00:05:05.298, Speaker B: So again, I told you, I'm going to ask some, some five year old questions here. So let's use mount Gox as an example. So, yeah, walk me through, basically, like, you're explaining, like, different levels. Like, there's, you know, you could buy a bitcoin for like a third of the price. People were loading up claims. You have creditors. You have the liabilities.
00:05:05.298 - 00:05:21.642, Speaker B: Can you almost, like, just walk me through how with Mount Gox specifically, like, how that unfolded, leading us forward to today, like, how did you start buying claims? Who were the, who got the claims? Who had the trust? Like, who are the trustees, basically?
00:05:21.778 - 00:06:05.106, Speaker A: Do those get japanese? Yeah. So there was a japanese insolvency filed in Japan, and, and there was what's called a chapter 15 in the states, which recognized the form proceeding as the main proceeding. Those are the main things that were going on. There was a few articles about Malcox, and I'm sure some old OG crypto guys, like, were involved, had claims, things like that. But it wasn't, like, center stage news. And there were some early distressed guys who tried to make a market in the claims. But, like, when they filed in 14, like, 14 1516 and 17, the trade was okay because for the most part, there were guys, like, there was a guy, I mean, he's not doxxed because his name is out there.
00:06:05.106 - 00:06:28.786, Speaker A: His name is Josh, Josh Jones. And he ran a thing called bitcoin builder. He allowed people to basically trade their mount Gox account balances. This is pre petitioned to the insolvency in 14. Like, early in 14. And then once they filed for bankruptcy, like, he was actually buying their claims. I think he had a financier who was helping him buy their claims, but he was buying them for like, a third of the market value, even less than that.
00:06:28.786 - 00:07:07.504, Speaker A: Like, I think a fourth of the market value. When I say market value, I mean, like, the look through value of the crypto they had found. And then, so it was always kind of like kind of an okay trade, but not that interesting because, I mean, think about it. You're locked in a bankruptcy that could take forever, and yet you're getting bitcoin at a third of the market price. Now, if you're a total hodler and you think bitcoin is going to $1 million, then maybe that's a great trade. Cause now you're making 3 million for every million that somebody else makes. But for most distressed or special situation investors, they're thinking, like, this is not so great because you don't really know what the IRR is, and you don't really know when the exit is.
00:07:07.504 - 00:08:01.968, Speaker A: So a lot of people, like, looked at it in a curious way but never really touched it, and also had the live wire of being like, dude, if I pitch this to my investment community, I'm gonna get laughed out of the room. So that was all the way. That was 14, 1516 and 17. And then 18 happened where there was a bit of a bull run and the trustees sold about 40,000 BTC, which was equivalent to about $600 million or 650 million. There was some cash already there, but it's like 600 million. And the total was like $650 million of it's japanese yen, but let's just do it in dollars of us dollars that was raised. So at that point, you were able to basically buy claims at, like, a $400 million valuation, when there was even, like, 650 million of fiat in the estate, and yet there were still about 140,000 bitcoin left.
00:08:01.968 - 00:08:47.380, Speaker A: So all that was freebie. But the question in 18 was, well, maybe bitcoin is not property, it's just currency, or maybe it's just a financial contract, so it's not a property, and so you don't get the uplift in value because bitcoin had gone at the. From $483 to at the time, I think about ten or $12,000. So you follow me? So even though they lost a bunch of the bitcoin, bitcoin had gone up so much in value that on a dollar basis, you were made whole and then some. But on a crypto basis, of course, you only got back like a 2020 5th. You know, you only got back about 25% of the bitcoin you initially put in. So, of course, some people always say, like, oh, if I had my hundred bitcoin from Mac Gox, I'd be worth, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:08:47.380 - 00:09:04.040, Speaker A: I'm like, dude, you would have sold that bitcoin 55 times over. Okay, stop with this whole. Like, you would have never huddled into this for this long. Like, you and I both know it. So the trade was very interesting in 18. So I got a family office. I tried.
00:09:04.040 - 00:09:24.438, Speaker A: I literally pitched it to, like, 100 firms. And I think some were nice and polite and some were like, this is the dumbest idea I've ever heard. But I had one guy who didn't think it was dumb, actually. I thought it was great. He thought it was great. It made imminent sense. And I had other people that thought it was great, but he thought it was great, and he pulled the trigger.
00:09:24.438 - 00:09:42.570, Speaker A: He actually put money to work. He didn't just say, yeah, that sounds great. Call me, email me, then you call an email and the person never responds to you. He actually responded. He actually was proactive. We actually got an LLC set up and we did the trade. That was the big time to do it.
00:09:42.570 - 00:10:11.020, Speaker A: And then marching forward from there, we started working for a large crypto hedge fund to buy these claims that he was affiliated with and the rest is sort of history. So that trade worked out well. And then from there I was like, you know what, this is really interesting. Like, no distressed firms are willing to work on crypto. It's like yourselves, like, no event companies are willing to work on crypto. Like there's too much reputational damage. They don't know about crypto.
00:10:11.020 - 00:10:47.494, Speaker A: They don't. They think crypto is bullshit or whatever. Sorry, now a curse in your pod. So it was like, it was like Greenfield, you know, it's like if you can make it professional and you can jump in the space, like, the incumbents will basically just leave it for you to do. So I saw that greenfield opportunity and I basically always kind of had it as a side project on the same time I was working in regular distresses, which is what I still do now. Now that the cycle has come back around in 2022, there's an enormous amount of opportunity and it's the same rhyming.
00:10:47.534 - 00:10:59.794, Speaker B: Theme before getting into some of that stuff. So with Mount Gox, how did, so in 2018, you guys put capital to work. How much money did you guys invest buying up the claims?
00:11:00.894 - 00:11:04.994, Speaker A: Not a lot. Not a lot. Like a few million dollars.
00:11:05.384 - 00:11:11.776, Speaker B: And when the, when they started paying out the bitcoin in what, 2021, 2020?
00:11:11.920 - 00:11:37.250, Speaker A: No, they haven't yet. So there are two. There are two dockets. One is Mac Ox and one is bitcoin cup and one is bitcoin builder. So bitcoin builder, this Josh Jones guy, he's one of the largest creditors in Mac Ox. So you can buy claims in bitcoin builder, you can buy claims in Mac Ox, and you could potentially buy claims in, in this thing called Bitcoinica. The problem with bitcoin, because the claims are not accepted yet.
00:11:37.250 - 00:12:04.076, Speaker A: So it's a little more complicated. But basically we invested a few million dollars at a valuation of maybe four to $600 per claim value. And now the claim, even with the pullback in crypto, is probably about $6,000 per claim. So you can do the math. You're basically made like a ten x, twelve x, whatever you want to call it. That's what, that's today. You know, I mean, it was, there was a time when it was like 40 or whatever it was.
00:12:04.076 - 00:12:08.060, Speaker A: Now it's come back a lot. And it was, you know, it was.
00:12:08.092 - 00:12:12.264, Speaker B: You guys doing this and it was also, and it was also fortress, nobody.
00:12:13.124 - 00:12:56.216, Speaker A: So it was myself and, you know, my business partner, 507 and a small family office, or I shouldn't say small, but, you know, relatively in the world of finance, a small family office and fortress showed up. So. So I say it's on the record because who cares? This point. I pitched this deal to everybody. I pitched it to definitely pitch it to Fortress and I definitely pitched it to Winston at help me out Zappo. I can hardly remember it because they don't exist anymore, I guess. And like six months later, after pitching everybody, some guy shows up in Tokyo and he is from fortress and looking to potentially buy claims.
00:12:56.216 - 00:13:22.056, Speaker A: So, yes, later on, Fortress showed up. Later in 18 they showed up. But I think it's because we were pitching it all over town. And the guy that works at Fortress, his brother works at the place called Fulcrum securities, which is like a distress brokerage. So I think he got wind of us, like pitching this trade all over town. But nonetheless, yeah, they showed up later in the trade and then they bid, we were bidding like 4500 per claim. They bid like six, seven, 8900 per claim.
00:13:22.056 - 00:13:27.484, Speaker A: So they still got. And they put a lot more capital on, but at like double, triple prices to what we paid.
00:13:28.054 - 00:13:34.590, Speaker B: Hmm. How many, how many creditors or how many folks? I don't even know the right language to use here. How many folks had.
00:13:34.622 - 00:13:36.234, Speaker A: Yeah. How many original creditors?
00:13:36.614 - 00:13:36.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:37.022 - 00:13:52.818, Speaker A: So 14,000. About 14,000 creditors. So when you look at Celsius, Voyager and FTX, it's like nothing, right? 14,000 creditors, that's nothing. I mean, you're talking about in those cases, it's hundreds of thousands of creditors.
00:13:52.966 - 00:14:01.866, Speaker B: Um, and how many creditors are there now? Or how many because those have been consolidated into, you know, 507 bought them, fortresses bought them. How many are there?
00:14:01.890 - 00:14:34.128, Speaker A: Bought them. It'd be hard. I don't. I'm sure you could find out by going to the japanese court because you can go and see the documents in person, apparently, like the creditor list, at least, we've never taken the time to do it and you can't transfer claims now anyway, so it's kind of irrelevant. But I don't know. But they bought at least 10% of the docket, so I think they bought the larger ones. So there's probably a lot of, there's a lot of really small creditors in Mac Ox, just like in.
00:14:34.128 - 00:14:46.444, Speaker A: If you looked at Celsius and Voyager, there's a lot of, like, bifurcation. If you looked at the top, like, thousand customers versus the bottom 10,000, it'd be like nothing versus, like a huge.
00:14:46.624 - 00:14:48.116, Speaker B: Yeah, they're big power loss.
00:14:48.300 - 00:15:08.984, Speaker A: Yeah, big power loss play. But. But there's a. There's a big chunk that's owned by us, by fortress, by Bitcoinica. And so if you look at those three blocks and you sort of think of even other brokers that probably bought stuff, there's a decent chunk, probably a third of the docket that's been bought up by claim buyers.
00:15:10.244 - 00:15:34.158, Speaker B: So I think there's a fear that when these actually get paid out, that's going to tank the market because. So I'm just curious, like a, when does the mail cox bitcoin actually get paid out? How much is it going. How much is actually going to get paid out? And then see. Yeah, and then see, like, will you. What do you plan on doing with that bitcoin? Will you sell it immediately? Will you hold it? And how much? Like, what's the impact on the market? So kind of a three part question there.
00:15:34.286 - 00:16:21.384, Speaker A: I have kind of a differentiated view, I guess, because I'm so close to it that I kind of think that anybody that's sold all the we cans have sold, like, that's one thing. And in addition to that, if you think about the money coming off, there are a number of pockets that are going to go to with people that have extremely low basis. And so when you have a super low basis, what I've realized in crypto or in probably any asset, you start thinking of ways to re apothecate without generating taxes. And so I think a lot of big holders, or whales in that case, are thinking like, okay, either they already sold, they moved to low tax jurisdiction, and they sold, or they're hodling. And when they get it, the first thing you're going to do. Well, hopefully Genesis still around. But Genesis, they're going to call Genesis.
00:16:21.384 - 00:16:39.634, Speaker A: They're going to call, you know, unchained capital, or you name the lender and they're going to be like, hey, I have $40 million in bitcoin. I'd really like to, you know, borrow against it. So I'm not saying that's what we'll do, because ours is totally different. It's all client money. It's going to go to the clients. The clients figure out what they do. We get our cut as a promote.
00:16:39.634 - 00:17:12.090, Speaker A: But for a lot of the OG guys that held onto their bitcoin, that's what they'll do. And then Bitcoinica is kind of interesting because they're a large creditor and they're not going anywhere. The Bitcoinica estate is going to take another three to five years after Mount Gox pays out. So it's not like all that money is going to hit the market. In fact, a number of those pockets of the market are going to be pulled offline because big Cornica is not going to come online. A lot of the whales aren't going to come online. And I don't know really what fortress is going to do.
00:17:12.090 - 00:17:31.344, Speaker A: I heard that they hedged, but I just don't know. It's like, so rumor ish. I mean, I speak with the guys there from time to time, or the guy, that sort of point guy on the trade for them from time to time, but I can't really make heads or tails of it. He doesn't want to tell me and he shouldn't. He didn't have to tell me. He doesn't, you know, it's not. He should do his thing.
00:17:31.344 - 00:17:49.244, Speaker A: But it would be hard for me to believe that they would just dump it on the market then hedging or selling, using their balance sheet and selling ball against their position, I think, is probably what they might have considered or done, but I don't think they're just going to dump it on the market.
00:17:49.664 - 00:17:50.400, Speaker B: Anything else that.
00:17:50.432 - 00:17:52.164, Speaker A: Oh, the timetable?
00:17:52.904 - 00:17:53.400, Speaker B: Yes.
00:17:53.472 - 00:18:19.152, Speaker A: Yes. Okay. So what we hear, and this is, you know, just from participants, I shouldn't say who they are because it would kind of give away, you know, stuff they probably don't want. It's out there. So we have heard early payouts. So these are people that decide for early payouts, they get a lower cut. So technically, you get, like, a 21% payout if you do an early payout, but you get like, a 23% payout if you do a late payout or final payout.
00:18:19.152 - 00:18:51.720, Speaker A: So we've all done the. We've done all the final payouts. So that's what our investors wanted for us. So for early payouts, we've heard early 2023, and for late payouts, we've heard late 2023, early 2024. So every year it's like, okay, come on, this is going to happen. So my wife, I'm married, and my wife, at this point, I sort of stopped talking about it because I'm just like, you know what? One day it's going to happen. So every year it's the next year.
00:18:51.720 - 00:19:25.984, Speaker A: That's what I should say. It's not because it's crypto. Well, it's not because it's crypto. It's because it's Japan has nothing to do to crypto. It's every bit of a fault of the japanese legal system, which if you ever go to a credit meeting, you'll know what I mean, which is you sit, there's no arguing, there's no motion practice like you've seen the States. It's just the trustee comes out, he tells you what's going to happen and the judges, literally, the trustee sits in the middle, the judges sit on the side and they nod while the trustee talks. So it's very weird system.
00:19:26.604 - 00:19:59.576, Speaker B: All right, everyone, time for a quick word from circle and USDC. As a crypto user, you know the power of stable coins, dollar digital currencies that transcend borders, banking hours and legacy financial rails, well circles. USDC has quit quickly, become one of the most trusted and widely used stablecoins. It's simple. People use USDC because of its composability, its stability and its reserve transparency. And USDC isn't just adopted by a few of us. Defi, Degens and Daos and NFT marketplaces, crypto companies alike.
00:19:59.576 - 00:20:33.288, Speaker B: They all leverage USDC to diversify their treasury, asset management and ecosystem wide composability. The adoption is clear. USDC has grown to more than $50 billion in circulation since launching in 2018. We all have, and we all will continue to take shots on our favorite volatile crypto assets, obviously. But USDC is one of the easiest ways to store your funds in a stable asset that can be used to send value around the world almost instantly. It lowers the cost of cross border payments. It integrates into the growing ecosystem of crypto apps.
00:20:33.288 - 00:21:02.756, Speaker B: As a seamless, trusted dollar digital currency, USDC is a zero to one opportunity for the financial system. If you want to learn more about USDC, I would recommend you check out the recently published transparency hub on Circle.com dot. It's a great update to Circle's content on USDC. It outlines everything from links to their weekly reserve reports, monthly attestations, blog posts that are written by their exec team that highlight how and why USDC was built the way it is. Really recommend it. Just go to Circle.com
00:21:02.756 - 00:21:19.156, Speaker B: transparency to access it. Now let's get back to the show. All right, so let's fast forward from Mount Gox to this year. So we've got Terra. We've got Terra and Luna. Then we also have three arrows. We also have Celsius.
00:21:19.156 - 00:21:24.804, Speaker B: Let's play in, like, that may June Bucket of this year. Where did you see room for opportunity?
00:21:24.964 - 00:21:52.996, Speaker A: So Celsius, I didn't really wasn't trying to buy claims. And then, you know, fast forward. Then Voyager had filed a few weeks earlier, and we started watching the two dockets, and it was kind of interesting. And every now and then, someone would call us with a claim or someone call us about something. And then I had a few friends because I knew all these people from crypto, from Mount Gox, I had a few friends that were tied up in claims. Now give them a little advice here and there. And then I started thinking, like, you know what? These are interesting, but these are all, like, customer accounts.
00:21:52.996 - 00:22:31.662, Speaker A: I don't really want to get involved with customers. I don't want people to think I'm, like, sniping claims. Like, I'd rather just, like, get my. Get my sort of profile out there by being involved in these communities, but at the same time, really look for private deals. You know, traditionally, you would have npls and, you know, non performing loans, and, like, any distress cycle, you'd have non performing loans, like, people trying to sell assets cheaply and other opportunities, tertiary things that don't have to be, like, big public dockets. So I started focusing on that. And then when FTX sort of was boiling up and fuming, I was really working on these, like, private loan restructurings.
00:22:31.662 - 00:22:59.114, Speaker A: And then when FTX happened, I was like, whoa, this is like a big boy situation. And a lot of people started calling, and a lot of claimants started calling in big claimants, not like small claimants, big claimants. And so we started trying to look to deploy capital and trying to see if we could get involved. And there's a lot of nuance between the different cases, and I'm happy to talk about them, but that's how I got sucked into the recent run of things that are public.
00:22:59.814 - 00:23:01.622, Speaker B: Who are the big players that are.
00:23:01.638 - 00:23:43.584, Speaker A: Calling the big players? I mean, basically every distress firm wants to be a part of this distress cycle in crypto, which is good to see because I suppose it's part of the ecosystem. You can't be mad at them. In fact, you need them. They're the opportunistic capital that comes in when no one will touch anything but the delta and valuation between what they will pay and the VC firm, what the GaRp investor will pay versus the opportunistic credit investor will pay. That's a gulf. People get really scared in that big move. It's nice to see that they're showing up, but, of course, they're still getting tooled up.
00:23:43.584 - 00:24:22.974, Speaker A: I'm flattered that they would call little old me and ask me, like, you know, about crypto or stable coins or FTX or whatever, and. But I guess it's kind of like, it's kind of, it's. I'm flattered that it's happening. I kind of thought it would happen, and I'm glad to see that, you know, I wasn't totally wrong, but I don't want to see, like, total destruction. I mean, you know, especially when it's, like, individuals. I mean, I think in FDX is weird because it's all professional traders, and, of course, I feel for people losing their money that they've worked hard to earn. But, you know, in Celsius of Voyager, the stories were even worse.
00:24:22.974 - 00:24:42.244, Speaker A: I mean, especially in Celsius, for some reason, there was a lot of personal stories that I came across with people that were severely impacted, like, financially, you know, people that were just trying to save, save there for retirement, things like that. It's very, very different in, in FTX. It's a lot of professional trading firms and professional traders.
00:24:43.184 - 00:24:56.124, Speaker B: So when you, when you bid on something, I guess if, I don't know how much, I don't know how much you want to talk about, like, what. What you're actually bidding on, but, like, if you bid on. So, so Celsius, have you, have you bid on Celsius?
00:24:57.144 - 00:25:20.936, Speaker A: I've bid on a few claims. I fit on a few big claims. Uh, normally, we're not actively soliciting, but if someone's a really big claim, I'm like, look, we're not really bidding, but you have a very large claim, like, $16 million. So if you ever wanted to sell it, like, please, like, consider us. Like, I would try my best to give you the best price. And if someone gave you a better price, I would tell you, hey, go take that price. I can't match it.
00:25:20.936 - 00:26:06.578, Speaker A: And, like, so the way I pitch this to myself is like, hey, I can help you make a market and get the best price. And if that guy's giving you crappy documents, maybe I can give you better documents, but the same price or lower price or the same price but better documents. So I try to position myself as, like, I'm just part of the ecosystem, so there's no reason not to involve me. And I like to think I'll be totally straight with you and transparent and hopefully be able to help, but for smaller claimants, like, we really try not to get involved. I mean, for myself, there was a time when I was quite involved in the community, and I still am happy to answer anybody's questions if they dm me. I really try to respond or on, like, telegram and things like that. And so I do feel a responsibility to do that, but I try not to be too aggressive with, like, you know, like, hey.
00:26:06.578 - 00:26:36.012, Speaker A: And I definitely don't do the whole, like, aggressive, like, oh, you're gonna lose all your money. You don't know what you're doing. Like, I hate that kind of sales pitchy stuff, and we really stay away from that. And in Voyager, the same, we are not actively buying claims, but there's been one or two that have popped up in some weird way. Like, one was positioned on a marketplace that my friend runs, and I saw it, and I was like, wait, dude, what are you doing with a claim on a c five, like, exchange? Like, come on, man. And he was like, oh, it's so easy. I love using the app.
00:26:36.012 - 00:26:53.876, Speaker A: Like, it's just so easy. It's not a lot of my money, but of course it's just easy to do it. And, like, you know, that's. That's my life. Like, I don't have time to, like, like, private cold storage everything. And I was like, well, dude, I would totally buy this. And so we kind of negotiated it off the platform, and then I went back.
00:26:53.876 - 00:27:09.604, Speaker A: I didn't want my friends to not make their fee, so I was like, okay, I'll buy it on the platform. So. But we're not active. We don't actively search it. But if someone has a whale claim, like, we'll consider it. And I'm always also happy to, like, facilitate, like, people, you know, sort of to the right buyer.
00:27:10.144 - 00:27:35.986, Speaker B: And the way that that works to just. Again, simple questions here for a complex thing is the way that that works is, let's say someone has a hundred. Let's say someone has a claim on $100 million of Celsius assets. Those are assets that may or may not come back to them. $100 million that they have a claim on. You will tell them, you will put in a bid for that. So you'll say, hey, I think there's a 10%.
00:27:35.986 - 00:27:49.050, Speaker B: I think there's a fifth. I personally think there's a 15% likelihood that that capital comes back. So the value of those assets, in my mind are 15 million. I'll put in a bid at, like, $10 million. Is that roughly how it works?
00:27:49.202 - 00:28:04.966, Speaker A: Yes. I'm normally very transparent with people about what I think the recovery is, and then I just tell them, like, this is going to take this long, and I need to get a discount to that. That. And there's also risk. So let's take. I mean, we can do Celsius. Celsius, maybe it's like high thirties, low forties.
00:28:04.966 - 00:28:20.502, Speaker A: So what can I pay for that? High teens, high twenties, low twenties. Sorry, low twenties, maybe. Mid twenties, maybe. But the FTX connections I need to discount. So maybe. Let's say the return is $0.35 on the dollar, which is not that far off.
00:28:20.502 - 00:28:22.326, Speaker A: Probably what they are. 35.
00:28:22.390 - 00:28:25.114, Speaker B: What's the timeline? What's the timeline there?
00:28:26.494 - 00:28:46.862, Speaker A: It's hard to say right now. There's been a lot of smoke or uncertainty with the FTX filing. There's no reason. Like, if Celsius can't find a buyer, which I highly doubt they will find a buyer at this point. I mean, maybe CZ shows up and buys them, but I think he probably just lets it liquidate. Maybe he shows up and buys it. Because, I mean, think about it.
00:28:46.862 - 00:29:32.500, Speaker A: Like, if you buy FTX, excuse me, if you buy Celsius or you buy Voyager, it's basically like a customer acquisition strategy. Like, can I buy this cheaper, or can I build this and acquire these customers for $1,000 a customer, or can I just acquire them by buying this platform? So I don't know if there's a buyer at this point. I think a tradfi institution should show up in these cases. But I thought that early on with Celsius, or, excuse me, with Voyager, and then when I got deeper into talking to trad five people about bidding on Celsius and Voyager, they all looked at me like I was crazy. And they were just like, what? Like, I don't even know. Like, we don't have an operating team, like, we don't know about crypto. So maybe as things get deeper, they consider it, but it's not going to be for high numbers.
00:29:32.500 - 00:30:00.624, Speaker A: It would just be, like, for liquidity purposes. So maybe Celsius takes another year before they start distributing crypto, and it would be in dribs and drabs, like, it would be, like, a 5% dividend and, like, a 10% at another 10%. So the 30% or 40% you could get could take, like, next year you get 10%, and the year after, you get another 10%, and the year after that, you get another 10%. Do you follow me? So if no one buys them and they just liquidate, it could be a multi year distribution pattern.
00:30:02.004 - 00:30:09.792, Speaker B: And you. Let's, let's fast forward to FTX. You already started buying claims on FTX? Yeah, for, I think I saw $0.03 on the dollar. Huh?
00:30:09.948 - 00:30:21.144, Speaker A: I mean, we got very lucky with that one. That's not something that could be repeated. But, yeah, the market right now is probably five to $0.06 with a premium for larger and a premium for better.
00:30:21.224 - 00:30:27.204, Speaker B: How did you get that? How did you get that, Thomas? Like, someone just calls you up and they're like, hey, Thomas, I know that you're a distressed investor.
00:30:29.464 - 00:30:46.576, Speaker A: It's just luck, man. It's just like you're in the market. It'd be like trying to get, I don't know, a sponsor something. It's like, oh, it worked out. Like they got dropped from this event and then they said this. So they have this allocation, so they had to use it or lose it. So the now I got a hundred thousand dollar sponsor.
00:30:46.576 - 00:30:50.724, Speaker A: It's literally that. It's like preparation meeting opportunity.
00:30:51.104 - 00:30:54.992, Speaker B: So what are the claims trading at right now in the secondary, you said.
00:30:55.048 - 00:31:32.516, Speaker A: Five to probably the tighter range is like five to six for smaller claims and probably like six to eight for larger claims. And it also depends on a few things, what jurisdiction you're in, how clean your claim is in terms of its documentation, preferences, and clawback potential, even though there's probably no clawbacks. And then also, like, what documents you want. So a few sellers have been like, oh, I want really aggressive privacy stuff, and I don't want to sell to us entity. That's one thing I've heard. Oh, I don't want to. I want very aggressive red lines with like, very aggressive red lines.
00:31:32.516 - 00:31:54.068, Speaker A: And it's like, okay, that's fine. Just so you know, that affects price. You know, like, you can't get $0.08 or you can't get $0.07 for a big claim. If you want ridiculously aggressive red lines to, when I say red lines, red lines to a contract between the buyer and the seller, it affects things. You know, be like a sponsor, you know, it's like you, you want all these things.
00:31:54.068 - 00:31:56.884, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's gonna cost you a little more.
00:31:57.704 - 00:32:16.520, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. The pickier you are, the more expensive. Expensive. Obviously, it's going to be. How much of this do you think about where things are domiciled? So again, I'm not a lawyer here, but FTX was operating out of the Bahamas. The bankruptcy, as I understand, is happening in the US.
00:32:16.520 - 00:32:23.088, Speaker B: And then they have some sort like the trust is in England, something like that. How much does the location come into play here?
00:32:23.256 - 00:32:54.204, Speaker A: Okay, so it's english law, which is not that surprising because it's the. Originally, my understanding is so originally it was antiguan. Antiguan and Barbuda, if I'm saying it right. So that was some reason moved to the Bahamas. It's quite curious why it was moved. I'd love to learn, and I'm sure that they'll find out as they go through investigations why it was moved. It might have been some pushback from the authorities about wanting to see audited financials and things like that, or regulation that they didn't like.
00:32:54.204 - 00:33:33.080, Speaker A: But maybe it was innocent and there was no reason. Maybe it was just like, oh, you know, let's just move it. Cause it's easier. And Bahamas is giving us all these free tax breaks or something. Who knows? But it was quite curious that it was moved. But in both instances they were basically, this is not that unusual, but for these sort of offshore previous Commonwealth countries or even Commonwealth countries that will use english common law or english law as the jurisdictional backdrop. I mean, as an american, a lot of times people will, especially claims trading people use New York law because what you're doing is you're looking for certainty and interpretation of your agreement.
00:33:33.080 - 00:33:57.416, Speaker A: So with english common law there's a lot of, you know, or english law, there's a decent amount of certainty about what you're going to get. You don't want to say, oh, let's subject ourselves to bahamian law. Like there might not be a lot of certainty. And so you look for jurisdictions where you have certainty. And so it's not that uncommon to see english common law in contracts. And this one is english common law with Singapore arbitration, which again is not that unreasonable or suspect.
00:33:57.560 - 00:34:15.379, Speaker B: Do you think we could see something that. Something similar to what Bitfinex did where they, I don't even fully understand what Bitfinex did. They like tokenized their tokenization of like bankruptcy assets, something of that sort. So maybe if you could, I don't know if you know much about what Bitfinex did, but maybe you could explain what they did and then.
00:34:15.511 - 00:34:55.704, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, they basically token, they did like a debt for equity swap, but instead of, I don't know, I don't remember how they passed it by the creditors. Maybe they just all voted on it. I don't actually know. But what law jurisdict or what jurisdiction they use, but they're never gonna, they're never going to that's never going to happen in these cases. Now there could be a debt for equity swap as part of the bankruptcy and then someone could tokenize it, or even the bankruptcy courts could sanction the idea of tokenizing it, but they're not.
00:34:55.744 - 00:34:56.964, Speaker B: Why we have to.
00:35:00.064 - 00:35:53.912, Speaker A: It won't happen in the sense of the way they did it in Bitfinex. I'm not saying they couldn't do a recovery token because again, a debt for equity swap is all, all the, it's very reasonable thing to be doing, but it would have to be sanctioned by the bankruptcy court. There's no way the estate professionals aren't going to do their full investigation into what happened pre petition before that would be happening. And even then, I just don't see bankruptcy estate professionals going for tokenization model unless it's really pushed for by the creditors in FTX. I've heard there's been a lot of talk, but again, it's a lot of professional traders, unlike Celsius and Voyager, where people are like very. I don't know how to put it, but there's a very different component going on. There's a lot of emotional components where people were individuals that lost a lot of money and they get behind leaders that have different ideas.
00:35:53.912 - 00:36:22.252, Speaker A: And I think a tokenization would be interesting in almost all cases, but that's not too different than what the bankruptcy courts have been doing for years, which is in the.com bubble. There was two famous bankruptcies. One was CMGI, and I don't know if that actually filed for bankruptcy or if it just went into receivership and liquidation. But the other big one was Comdisco. So in Comdisco it was a computer leasing company. As part of that they had this big $2 billion venture portfolio and they didn't tokenize it.
00:36:22.252 - 00:37:09.184, Speaker A: But think about what they did. They basically issued like a recovery certificate, like a unit that was a liquidation trust and a litigation trust, I think, in one. And that traded OTC like over the counter in America, you could buy it in your fidelity account and so you could almost do it. It's kind of like a token with a registered security. So I don't think that's out of the picture. I just think that that's two, three years off in FDX's case at a minimum. And I think it only makes sense if you want to do it for the venture portfolio, for Celsius and Voyager, it doesn't even make sense because what would you be tokenizing? Like new co equity? I'm not sure that the new co equity has any value, it needs to be either sold or liquidated.
00:37:09.184 - 00:37:12.524, Speaker A: So I think it's better to just liquidate.
00:37:13.104 - 00:37:16.644, Speaker B: What's the name of the second company that had the venture portfolio from the.com.
00:37:17.224 - 00:37:21.204, Speaker A: So comdisco is a big one that I see.
00:37:21.584 - 00:37:42.658, Speaker B: That's an interesting comparison to FTX, because from my understanding of that bankruptcy, the venture portfolio ended up actually returning the amount that made the creditors whole, which has a huge venture portfolio. It just took them like a decade to return the amount of capital that made the creditors whole.
00:37:42.706 - 00:37:44.974, Speaker A: So you could see 14 years.
00:37:45.794 - 00:37:55.178, Speaker B: Yeah, took 14 years. So you could see the venture, the FTX venture portfolio eventually making everyone whole, but you just gotta wait. Yeah. Ten to 15 years here. So.
00:37:55.306 - 00:38:25.442, Speaker A: So I, I wish someone would write a case study on it, and someone out there must have done some research on it. The problem is, like, I'm too young. Like, I only I'm not that young, but I wasn't really around disco. I only remember when the liquidation trust traded, and I remember being like, holy crap, these guys made over 100% of their return. It's in year like ten. And I remember, I mean, I invested, when I ran my hedge fund from like year ten to 14, I played the liquidation and it was still cheap. I made a double on the liquidation, if I recall.
00:38:25.442 - 00:38:29.814, Speaker A: I mean, it was a double over four years, but it was not a bad play at all.
00:38:30.674 - 00:38:42.450, Speaker B: Hmm. That's really interesting. Anything else that we're missing here that you think is really important to talk about in terms of just distressed investing, what you're looking at with FTX Celsius, anything that we're missing here?
00:38:42.602 - 00:39:31.134, Speaker A: There's going to be a lot more litigation in FTX then probably Voyager pittance for litigation Celsius a little bit more maybe because some insider transactions and some structuring and gifting of tokens to girlfriends or wives and things like that. But that's actually small compared to FTX. FTX, like, holy crab. This guy basically took trust assets and invested it and all kind of stuff. And, you know, I'm not, I mean, you know, I guess in this instance, like, he's gonna, it's gonna be, you know, you're gonna have to, you potentially are gonna have to trace trust assets. And there's people talking about bringing actions outside of the bankruptcy core and the Singapore arbitration, which is possible. It's not part of the automatic stay.
00:39:33.194 - 00:39:38.898, Speaker B: Will they separate FTX Us and FTX Us and FTX international assets? They will separate?
00:39:38.946 - 00:39:43.254, Speaker A: Very likely, yeah, very likely. What about they'll be siloed.
00:39:44.434 - 00:39:48.294, Speaker B: Thomas, the one company you haven't mentioned is blockfi. What happens to Blockfi here?
00:39:48.674 - 00:40:22.784, Speaker A: So I don't know exactly what the Blockfi agreement was, but my understanding, for the most part was they paid nothing for the equity, and they basically gave him a line of credit. So that line of credit is clearly going to be called. And so Blockfi is going to have to file for bankruptcy. But the question is, like, is the underlying loan portfolio solvent? If it is, then all it needs is time to mature. And they could just either call on the loans or get someone to buy the loan portfolio out, and maybe they can buy the equity of the business for next to nothing. But the creditors themselves in blockfi might be fine. I haven't heard anything about their loan book being sour, unlike a genesis, where.
00:40:22.784 - 00:40:37.728, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like the loan book is very sour. Like, there are some loans that were, in hindsight, not well thought through or underwritten, I guess, is the right word.
00:40:37.856 - 00:40:48.928, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the last place I want to end with this conversation is actually just with Genesis. I mean, just to timestamp this. We're recording this November 21. It's like four in the afternoon.
00:40:48.976 - 00:40:50.004, Speaker A: Timestamp it?
00:40:50.704 - 00:40:54.448, Speaker B: Yeah. What? Because things are moving so quickly, especially.
00:40:54.496 - 00:40:56.844, Speaker A: 48 hours, do they file? What's the question?
00:40:57.824 - 00:40:59.128, Speaker B: I was just gonna say, like, what do you think?
00:40:59.176 - 00:41:01.484, Speaker A: Over, under. On how many hours did they file?
00:41:02.064 - 00:41:04.244, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly.
00:41:06.224 - 00:41:21.044, Speaker A: So Blockbuy has to file. It's not their fault. Like, they got bought by a company that now is insolvent, so they have really no choice. Genesis. I don't know. I thought that Genesis lending was sort of siloed. And I used to think of Barry Stern.
00:41:21.044 - 00:41:51.508, Speaker A: Sternlick sterlic, however you say his name. I used to think of Barry as, like, kind of a genius, that there's no way that he would cross Silbert. Thank you. Barry Silbert is, like, a genius. And, like, there's no way he cross contaminated his balance sheets. But then I heard stuff on Twitter about people saying, like, oh, well, you know, DCG guaranteed some billion dollar loan to the sub. If that's true, that's bad, and it does complicate things.
00:41:51.508 - 00:42:28.870, Speaker A: But the guarantee would take a long time to call in versus filing the sub, and then somebody calling in the guarantee, and then you finding the guarantee for six months or twelve months or whatever, but it would be bad, and it's bad for sure. So I don't really know. I'm not like, don't. Like, not don't have some special knowledge about Genesis. If in a perfect world, let's say they're all siloed, Barry basically files genesis lending. In the worst case scenario, if Genesis lending and Genesis trading are combined balance sheets, he files both those entities. But DCG group itself should be fine.
00:42:28.870 - 00:42:53.074, Speaker A: The venture portfolio, just the other investments that they have and things at the hold company and things like that. So in a perfect world, that's what it looks like. But I've heard some stuff on Twitter. I don't know if it's true, about there being, like, a guarantee from the parent to the sub, whoever put in capital last time. So I don't deny or confirm. I have no special knowledge on it, but it'll be interesting to see.
00:42:53.814 - 00:43:02.310, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting, indeed. Awesome, man. This was a. And anything else that we're missing here, I feel like this is a good place to wrap. But anything else that we're missing?
00:43:02.462 - 00:43:08.230, Speaker A: No, that's. That's pretty much it, man. There's a lot to see what will happen over the next couple of months. Cool.
00:43:08.302 - 00:43:12.486, Speaker B: All right, man. Well, always good catching up. Appreciate your time. And I will see you on the other side of all.
