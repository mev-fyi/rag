00:00:01.000 - 00:00:35.204, Speaker A: I think it's a pretty dumb, unfair argument to just say that Solana is not decentralized. I think you're not really looking under the hood and understanding that the cost of the hardware is the cheapest possible cost that you can have to achieve what we're doing. You may not want a global price synchronized price discovery engine. That may be not something that you care about. That's great. Go use Ethereum. Like, you can get settlement guarantees there, but a lot of people want that, and that's actually very important for finance.
00:00:35.204 - 00:00:42.024, Speaker A: Like, you look at the traditional trade fi stack, all of the money is not made in settlement. It's made in execution.
00:00:42.884 - 00:00:57.900, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got Santi co hosting with me, and then we're very lucky to be joined by Ben Sparango, head of BD at Solana, as well as Anatoly, back for a second time. Anatoly was on the show last year and. Yeah, Anatoly, Ben, welcome to Empire.
00:00:57.932 - 00:00:59.772, Speaker A: Guys, thank you.
00:00:59.908 - 00:01:00.940, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:01.092 - 00:01:31.422, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. All right, guys, I think there's obviously a lot that we need to talk about here and that we want to talk about. I think the most pressing thing and the best place to start here would obviously be talking about FTX and SPF. You guys had an intertwined relationship that I would love to just figure out what it was almost. And I think the best place to kick this off would be Anatolia. Can you just share with the listeners what was your relationship with Sam? And maybe starting with, like, how did it start? Who introduced you? Like, what was. How did this whole.
00:01:31.422 - 00:01:33.834, Speaker B: How did Solana get so intertwined with FTX?
00:01:34.494 - 00:02:15.818, Speaker A: Yeah, so Labs was founded in, like, 2018 at the start of that bear market, basically, right as the, you know, the. Everything was burning in crypto, and crypto was dying. We raised a bit of a seed round and started labs in our seed deck. Literally said blockchain at Nasdaq speed. I thought the most important thing that blockchains do is they synchronize prices around the world in a censorship resistant way. And that was what we built for. We had Dex as our stress test and our number one thing that we really wanted to see on the network, and we wanted to build a central limit order book.
00:02:15.818 - 00:02:46.012, Speaker A: That was really the thesis. That's the most efficient way to do price discovery, and we're going to build a blockchain that does it really, really well. So when I got connected to Sam in, like, 2020, I think it was either through, I believe it was mostly through Kyle. But there's also a couple other investors, like Edith Young and Chris McCann that were also connected to Sam. And I think all of us wanted to get us in the same room. And I pitched him this idea. Like, you know, you look at Solana and, like, how it's designed.
00:02:46.012 - 00:03:21.424, Speaker A: Imagine we optimize this thing to its natural conclusion. We'll have information propagating through this network as fast as speed of light through fiber. So, like, news worthy event happens in Singapore that, like, those bits have to get to Bloomberg terminal in New York. They have to go speed of light through fiber, right? At that same time, state transition propagates through Solana. Speed of light through fiber. By the time the trader sees that newsflash, the price on the CME or Nasdaq is the same as the price in a market running in Solana. So we're as good at price discovery as the fastest exchanges.
00:03:21.424 - 00:03:53.042, Speaker A: And that was, like, kind of the pitch and the selling point. And this was at the time when uniswaps just started to, like, show early signs of product market fit. And it's like, early first day at DeFi summer, basically. And Sam was like, okay, I want to do something in DeFi, and I don't want to build a side chain with our own stupid Dex running on it. I want it to be more real. And he saw that we had technology that enabled them to do that. We had this demo called break.
00:03:53.042 - 00:04:16.052, Speaker A: You smash your keyboard, and every transaction you can go play right now, every transaction sends off, and it gets confirmed that it lights up green. It's a very visceral experience. I suggest people try it, and, like, you actually see that this is like, a web two experience. You don't even forget that you're using, like, a crypto thing. It's like, not even. It was really kind of shocking to people. That could work.
00:04:16.052 - 00:04:41.762, Speaker A: So we gave them this demo. We saw, like, within a few hours, they were spamming the network, and then, like, the next day, it was like, okay, we're going to go build serum. And they have eight engineers at the time total at FTX. They put four of them in serum. So it was like, a pretty big commitment from their side. And at that time, like, 2020, FTX was, like, up and coming exchange. It was, I think, maybe just barely cracked the top ten.
00:04:41.762 - 00:05:04.386, Speaker A: And people knew Sam from, like, his, like, stuff on Twitter, and within four weeks, they went from nothing. And at that time, Solana literally had nothing. We had barely an explorer that kind of sort of worked. No wallet. It was a command line wallet, right? And, like, trust wallet was the only other thing. There's no dap wallet. So they built the wallet.
00:05:04.386 - 00:05:54.372, Speaker A: They built a bunch of introspection tools. They built serum, all the uis for it, got market makers and everyone else involved and launched it. And that was a pretty big lift. And I was probably naive, but at least I convinced myself that they're building this technology because they want to disrupt themselves, and they see that DeFi will eventually take over, and, like, eventually serum is going to be what FDX runs on. Like, that was at least, like, what I thought was actually going to happen. And, like, our relationship between, like, us and Sam was like, you know, if we had product ideas that we could synchronize on, I could reach him, right? Like, he'd be one of the people that I talked to. I talked to a bunch of people, but he would be one of the first people I talked to.
00:05:54.372 - 00:06:24.004, Speaker A: Like, hey, we want to build a phone or do this other thing. Can you guys, like, port your application to it or give us an API for a fiat ramp or whatever? That was? Basically, I felt like I could depend on them to build stuff that we couldn't because they had an exchange that had fiat ramps and all this other stuff that was very centralized and could really let us get to market with, like, cool products much, much faster. Yeah.
00:06:24.904 - 00:06:29.056, Speaker B: Where did you meet them? Did you guys do drinks? You got do, like, a dinner was a Zoom call.
00:06:29.120 - 00:06:42.204, Speaker A: It was COVID days. Yeah, it was a bunch of phone calls. Like, I didn't meet him until, I think, a year later at bitcoin Miami. Hmm.
00:06:42.504 - 00:06:58.830, Speaker B: I remember interviewing him in, like, may of 2021, and my thought was, I remember halfway through the interview, two hour interview, halfway through it, he's like, oh, by the way. Yeah, I mean, I'm in. I think he's in Hong Kong at the time or something like that. He's like, yeah, it's 03:00 a.m. My time. I was like, oh, my God. Like, you stayed, like, I should be the one staying up till 03:00 a.m.
00:06:58.830 - 00:07:16.758, Speaker B: To interview you. Like, not the other. I was really blown away. And, like, I think I maybe, like, along with a lot of other people, probably got played. I'm curious, what was your interaction when you met him? Like, were you. Did you think, like, wow, giga brain, like, genius entrepreneur here? Were you more skeptical? I'm just curious.
00:07:16.886 - 00:07:48.674, Speaker A: He fit his Persona well. Like, I thought he kind of had this, like, character of, I'm an MIT giga brain, and, like, he dressed like, he's just like, I think dressed like it, right? Like, basically just fit that Persona. And, like, I think given that his success in, like, both Alameda and the exchange, you kind of just felt like, maybe it's true, right? Like, maybe he's that smart and, like, I don't know, studying physics at MIT. That seems pretty impressive.
00:07:52.134 - 00:08:40.814, Speaker D: There's this sort of idea that was servicing around certain circles that Alameda or FTX was sort of. It became like they were doing some pretty harmful stuff in terms of, like, listing perps early on and Alameda investing in some projects, and then FTX providing exo liquidity. Like, these were things that at the time around the Bitcoin conference, it was already surfacing, perhaps this conflict of interest. I'm curious if there was a time that you felt that their contribution to the Solana ecosystem was actually subtractive, where it became negative and they weren't really as a positive force as they seemed to make it.
00:08:42.584 - 00:09:41.318, Speaker A: Yeah, there's, like a. There was a long period where there was a lot of engineering output out of them, like, both on serum and supporting, like, projects that were launching and, like, figuring out, like, all the APIs and, like, getting Armani. Like, Armani was like a, you know, a gift to the whole Solana ecosystem, just him working on anchor and stuff like that. And I think at some point, it flipped to where FTX was growing really rapidly and they were working on their brand and expansion and all these other things, and that the engineering effort went somewhere else. That was one change in terms of the FTV tokens. We had a very different point of view on that. I always felt that you gotta, like, force price discovery as early as possible, because that's when you build your community.
00:09:41.318 - 00:10:29.432, Speaker A: The people that join are the hardcore people in that tumultuous time where price discovery occurs, and you gotta give them, like, a chunk, right? You gotta be open with them. And that was something that I think they just didn't do with, like, all the coins that they launch. But those were, like, I think, very Sam driven projects. There was just a lot of other shit happening that wasn't Sam related. Like, all of the DeFi projects that launched in the Defi hackathon, I think. I don't even think, like, mango was anti taking Alameda's money. There was already, like, a faction of, like, defi builders on Solana that were like, we like Solana, and, like, we heard of it because of Sam, but we don't want to.
00:10:29.432 - 00:10:34.084, Speaker A: We don't want, like, to deal with them. So that was already kind of happening.
00:10:34.464 - 00:11:20.064, Speaker C: Yeah. Santi, just to elaborate a little bit more, I think there wasn't a point where it was. There wasn't a point where it was, like, apparent to us where, you know, it flipped negative their impact over time. I think our relationship just kind of dwindled, honestly. Right around bitcoin Miami was when, like, it's like, we stopped, like, talking to them as much or them having as much engineering output as Anatolia had mentioned. And then six months later, we find out that FTX Ventures is investing in direct competitors to Solana, in Aptos and in Mistin. Very rapidly, they switched to bigger and better things and doing more things, and we were just focused on the ecosystem and the projects that we were building internally.
00:11:20.364 - 00:12:00.534, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm curious. There's this idea that I was hearing perhaps over the last year, which is what would have been if Solana without Sam, without FTX, without Alameda, what would you like? Obviously, it's impossible in a parallel universe, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is how influential was he in Ben, from your perspective on the beedie side of things, you talked to corporations. SPF was the golden boy on tv and the face of crypto. Anatoly, I'm just curious, how would you characterize that statement?
00:12:01.914 - 00:12:37.112, Speaker A: The tech is awesome, and I think stands on its own. We're still not at a place where all the competitors combined generate as many transactions per day as Solana. It's been two and a half years, so I think we could have gotten there, but I don't know. It's really hard to predict. In those early days, it felt really sincere. And I don't know if I was naive, but I thought, shit, this idea of decentralized finance could actually happen with FTX. And he's so forward thinking that he's disrupting himself.
00:12:37.112 - 00:12:45.974, Speaker A: And that felt like just such awesome alignment. But, yeah, it's hard to know what would have happened without.
00:12:46.274 - 00:13:06.938, Speaker C: I think we would have, like, made it long term. Would it have happened as rapidly as it did? I don't know, because serum became that immediate source of liquidity, like, right as the bull market was hitting, and it was kind of perfect timing, whereas, you know, we were struggling to find builders in those early days. Like, when I joined the team in summer of. Of 2020, uh, it was just serum and orca.
00:13:06.986 - 00:13:07.306, Speaker B: Those were.
00:13:07.330 - 00:13:24.830, Speaker C: That was it in terms of ecosystem projects. And then once we had the notoriety from Sam and from serum, that kind of, like, broke down the dam a little bit for other people to be like, you know, maybe I'll explore the development environment here. I'll participate in a hackathon. And then, you know, we kind of snowballed all of that into, like, a living, breathing ecosystem.
00:13:25.022 - 00:13:54.314, Speaker D: Do you think that given everything that's going on in Sam's rapid fall, you stand on your own ground? You know, you look at TVL, Solana's down now to number ten. Apps like phantom optimism, Avalanche have higher TVL. Arguably, TVL is not the right metric. What I'm trying to say is that there was a time where Solana was much higher up. And people look at TVL, they will always look at TVL, but I think it's one of those. The heart of the question is.
00:13:56.934 - 00:13:57.270, Speaker B: Where.
00:13:57.302 - 00:14:13.664, Speaker D: Are you guys now in terms of the viability of Defi and Solana? I think a lot of builders are now asking the question, what's going to happen with Solana? Is this a chain that I should build on? Should I go elsewhere? Aptos, you name it, the next chain.
00:14:14.684 - 00:15:19.372, Speaker C: Before I address the immediate question, I just want to make aware that the Solana ecosystem has a lot of subsectors that we refer to them as DeFi, NFTs, games, payments, daos, all of which are thriving in their own right. DeFi has been the most hit hard just because general macro environment, anti crypto, and then the additional punch in the face of FTX and Alameda blowing up most recently. So DeFi is in a tough spot right now. But the thing that is most important that I see is the resolve of the builders in the DeFi ecosystem. If we were worried about the Defi ecosystem disappearing, we would be seeing a mass exodus of these builders. And that's just, frankly, what we're not doing. The first thing that I did after FTX came down was touch base with a lot of the Defi teams and say, how much exposure did you guys have? If you had exposure, what do you guys need to plug the hole? Who can I help introduce you to? Trying to make sure that everybody's okay.
00:15:19.372 - 00:15:53.404, Speaker C: And frankly, we've seen an incredible resolve from all the people that are building in DeFi. I'm not worried about DeFi long term. Ultimately, there are headwinds right now that are hampering liquidity, but over time, that will be ameliorated. And I'm sure the DeFi ecosystem will do things and iterate to bring more liquidity, more users, more use cases. Because ultimately, the reason why a lot of these people came to Solana is because Solana offers something that these other blockchains don't. And it's different infrastructure that can support better trading financial products than some of these other blockchains. And I think that that still stands regardless of what happened.
00:15:53.704 - 00:16:22.038, Speaker B: Ben, you were multicoin from, what, 2019 through, like, near the end of 2020, and then joined Solana in. It's just. Did it feel like this match made in heaven when, like, when FTX connected with, and, like, Sam connected with, like, Anatolia and the Solana team, and you're like, oh, my God. Like, this is the future of this. This is how we're gonna build the future of France, right? Like, we are. We've got, like, all right, we've got the tech team, and we've got the go to market folks. Like, this is how we're gonna do it.
00:16:22.206 - 00:16:39.204, Speaker C: Yeah. So a little. Little backstory. I actually ended up leaving multicoin, like, right as Sam and Solana started talking. Like, I wasn't really even a part of those conversations. And I had three offers at the time. Two of them were from Solana and one from livepeer.
00:16:39.204 - 00:17:17.068, Speaker C: And I actually went to livepeer for about a month and a half. And this was when the whole genesis of serum and everything was happening, and Solana was getting, like, pretty exciting from that respect. Um, and I was at live peer because, frankly, I was worried about flipping the bird to the Ethereum ecosystem and all the friends that I had made at the time, because up until then, nobody had been able to compete with Ethereum, and it wasn't clear that anyone was going to be able to compete. So during that month and a half that I was at Livepeer, things with Sam and serum really started to pick up. And luckily for me, Raj was in my DM's, like, every single day, telling me that if I was still interested in coming over there, that I could. That I could join the team. So I actually wasn't a part of a lot of that.
00:17:17.068 - 00:17:36.634, Speaker C: But, like, as I was viewing it from the outside, it was very apparent that, like, there was some sort of special sauce here that, like, really was enticing me. And given that my main focus when I was on the investment team at Multicoin was in Defi, it seemed perfectly suited for me to go and kind of, like, exacerbate that effort. So that's why I ended up joining in the fall.
00:17:38.374 - 00:18:08.902, Speaker B: Anatolia, do you think that you guys suffered in the obvious? Like, I have a feeling your answer would be, things are gonna be fine. We've got a bunch of builders. But, like, in the short term, maybe. Could you say that you guys suffered because of reliance on FTX? And I guess the reason I asked that is you said FTX had eight engineers. They put half their engineering team building on Solana. I'm, like, thinking about this from the founder perspective of blockworks. If we outsourced our sales function, for example, to someone else, and then three years later, they pulled it away and they started focusing on something else that wasn't blockworks.
00:18:08.902 - 00:18:15.354, Speaker B: I'd be like, ah, shit. We got a race to figure out how to build that competency internally. Do you have a feeling of that right now?
00:18:16.414 - 00:19:10.930, Speaker A: We had built that competency already. Naturally, as we saw Sam kind of shift his focus away from building defi products to, like, you know, going to DC or whatever, or, like, you know, working on the FTX brand. So that was, like, a shift that, where we were just not involved in that, because, like, it wasn't like, anything we could help with or, like, related to defi at all. So we figured out how to do all these things on our own. Like, I think he was pretty important for the first hackathon, and then, like, maybe as a somewhat, like, as allure for the second one, the defi hackathon. But after that, all the hackathons we ran around on our own, all the hacker houses we ran around, the conferences we did ourselves. Like, we kind of figured out how to market and, like, go to market, I think, pretty quickly on our own.
00:19:11.002 - 00:19:11.730, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:11.922 - 00:19:27.562, Speaker B: It's funny, I remember being at. What year was this? September. Oh, yeah, no, this was the last. Wow. This was last year, November 2021, in Lisbon at the first salon at break point. I'm assuming you were at the multicoint event that night. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:27.562 - 00:19:58.054, Speaker B: There's the multi coin event. And I remember there's all these, like, I mean, I met all the Solana founders. They're like these 22 year old kids that dropped out of school. And I was like, what's the hardest thing about building on Solana? They're like, well, they're like, Solana is going to be the number one l one if and only if Solana can maintain the network, if Solana can build things and, like, people can aggregate or, like, build around Solana, and it's. And they get off their reliance of FTX. So it's interesting. Even these young 22 year olds who had never built companies that, like, they were seeing it back then, which is really interesting.
00:19:58.214 - 00:20:00.870, Speaker A: Yeah. That band aid got ripped off really quickly.
00:20:01.062 - 00:20:01.702, Speaker C: It did.
00:20:01.798 - 00:20:02.246, Speaker A: It did.
00:20:02.310 - 00:20:18.242, Speaker B: Which maybe leads me to my next question. When did you first start to see. When did you first start to be, like, not. Not obviously didn't know the extent of things, but, like, did. Was there any point in time when you're like, oh, man. Like, his texts are feeling really manic? Or, like, oh, man, he's, like, blowing off calls or, like, there's something here?
00:20:18.378 - 00:20:28.626, Speaker A: No, I was. I was just really not paying that much attention. I would say, like, really focused on, like, the next fire that we have. Like, I don't know if you weren't.
00:20:28.650 - 00:20:30.682, Speaker B: Psychoanalyzing every text message from Sam.
00:20:30.738 - 00:20:34.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Unless it's a fire, it doesn't get to your, like, level of attention, right?
00:20:34.914 - 00:20:35.586, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:35.770 - 00:20:42.890, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's really hard to tell, man. Like, I don't know.
00:20:43.082 - 00:20:46.906, Speaker B: Ben, did you have any sense that things were funky over there?
00:20:46.930 - 00:21:36.850, Speaker C: Not really. I mean, after the beginning of the bull market, like, Toli mentioned it really just, like, our relationship with them started to dwindle. The people that we were interfacing with the most were, like, ecosystem level builders who may have been a part of FTX, talking about, like, Armani, who helped build anchor and is now working on backpack and people like that. So it wasn't a lot of interfacing with, like, the higher level FTX people like Sam or some of the others. So, like, to be totally honest, we were all completely blindsided by the way that it all went down, and that's very self evident by Solana Labs and foundation employees who had assets on FTX and company assets that were on FTX and that kind of stuff. So, I mean, there was really no signal, and if there was, we were totally blind to it.
00:21:36.962 - 00:21:52.364, Speaker B: Yeah. Anatoly, what was the first, like, holy shit. Moment when you realized that things were maybe not going out? Like they were supposed to be going? Like, I remember sitting. I remember exactly where I was when there was the tweet that binance was acquiring FTX. Like, what? Like, what was that moment for you? What was that first moment?
00:21:52.404 - 00:22:18.134, Speaker A: Yeah, this was the leak, I think, of the assets on coin desk. Was it coined as was, like, pretty eye opening. I was like, fuck, is this? Like, how. But I thought it was contained to Alameda. Like, is Alameda going to blow up? Like, was my thought, like, when I saw the leak of all the assets, because it seemed like they're. That. I don't know how real that was.
00:22:18.134 - 00:22:28.474, Speaker A: And then this was, I think, the last day of breakpoint. We just had this amazing conference. They were like, I don't know, everything was packed. There were 1600 devs at the hacker.
00:22:28.514 - 00:22:31.562, Speaker C: House, 3600 total attendees.
00:22:31.698 - 00:22:47.396, Speaker A: Yeah, it was twice as. Almost twice as big as the last one in this. In this bear market. Right. Like, we hit. We doubled the attendees in the, in the conference. And, like, I was, like, kind of paying attention to, but not really because I was, you know, we were really focused on what we're doing.
00:22:47.396 - 00:23:15.220, Speaker A: And then on the flight back, I was like, fuck this. First offer to buy FTT at 22. That's weird. Wait, finance is now buying FTX? That's really weird. Yeah, that was a really. Yeah, kind of gut churning flight. I'm still, like, can't, like, really put the two things together.
00:23:15.220 - 00:23:30.944, Speaker A: Like, the fact that we had, like, all this amazing growth and all these awesome builders and, like, showed up at the conference and, like, the vibes were just really great and, like, the shitstorm that followed or, like, just seemed like two different worlds.
00:23:33.584 - 00:23:51.644, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just hard to grapple with everything, honestly. It's just nuts that this all went down. So I want to move this conversation towards talking about Solana now in the future. Is there anything else that you think is important in terms of just relationship with Sam, relationship with FTX, anything that any points that you guys have seen laid out that you're like, that's blatantly wrong.
00:23:52.504 - 00:24:43.198, Speaker C: So, I mean, there's been a lot of. I've been dealing with, like, the dependencies of, like, the fallout of FTX for the last two and a half weeks. And, like, one of the things that happened shortly thereafter that I wanted to clarify was a lot of APAC exchanges were disabling USDC. USDT rails on Solana, but keeping them open for other chains. And as we've gotten into conversations with them to try and get them re enabled, we've realized that a lot of people have this misconception that Sam is to Solana as CZ is to binance chain, and has control over some large set of the validators and can affect changes or, like, mint or burn USDC or USDT. So I just wanted to, like, state for the record that Solana is a permissionless blockchain myself. Anatoly.
00:24:43.198 - 00:25:06.784, Speaker C: Sam, nobody has ultimate control over anything that says on the blockchain, and the validators have ultimate control over that in a decentralized fashion. And Sam is also, you know, like, not any part owner of Solana Labs or, like, anything like that. And that Solana, the blockchain, was incepted in 2018 before Sam had even started.
00:25:08.524 - 00:25:24.180, Speaker B: Doesn't. I mean, one of the things that I saw people concerned about was that Sam Sam or FTX or Alameda, I think it was. Alameda is probably the right entity to use here. Owns roughly 10%. I saw 13%. I saw 7%. Roughly 10% of the soul in circulation.
00:25:24.180 - 00:25:30.614, Speaker B: I think that's true, and I think that's probably still the case, honestly. So I'm curious just to get your take on that, Anatoly.
00:25:31.794 - 00:25:46.614, Speaker C: So in terms of what in particular, because the data is public on the fact sheet that the foundation had posted, and you can also query the blockchain and see the stake accounts that have been tagged to Alameda. So that is a fact. But what in particular would.
00:25:49.074 - 00:26:21.958, Speaker A: So that has no impact on security of the network. There's no way. Even if Alameda controlled 100% of the stake, they could not convince circle that you spent your USDC without your signature. Your self custody and circle's node are independent of the quorum that controls. They can censor transactions, but they cannot modify the state in such a way to spend your dollars. So at the end of the day, that part is irrelevant for the security of the chain. It has impact on liveness.
00:26:21.958 - 00:26:31.142, Speaker A: If they did a shitty job staking and then, like, those nodes were down, they would have temporary impact on liveness. But that's about it. At what.
00:26:31.318 - 00:26:37.846, Speaker B: What number would be concerning? If it was, like, Alameda owned 25%, that'd be concerning. Or they owned 51%.
00:26:37.910 - 00:26:38.606, Speaker C: Like, what's.
00:26:38.750 - 00:26:59.070, Speaker A: I mean, it's concerning that, like, this partner that we thought was going to, like, have their shoulder down building stuff on Solana had, like, that was the reason why the, like, those deals were made in the early days. We were like, you guys got to remember salon in 2020 was very much an underdog.
00:26:59.182 - 00:27:00.862, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember.
00:27:00.918 - 00:27:01.994, Speaker B: Trust me, I remember.
00:27:02.494 - 00:27:33.580, Speaker A: We were very much an underdog. Like, everything was hard, and this was, like, a relationship that was cemented with, like, with that deal. And, like, they were. They had the shoulder down for a while, and now there's a whole bunch of tokens that are basically sitting around in bankruptcy court. Who knows what the hell is going to happen there? But, like, that partner is no longer there. That part sucks. But the ecosystem's grown to the point where I think, as you saw with, like, the open book for Casira, all the code that they built was open source.
00:27:33.580 - 00:27:52.882, Speaker A: So kudos to them for doing that. And, like, once you have products that are really good that are open source, people will, like, reroute and fix and, like, move shit around around, like, your failures, like, very, very quickly. So that part, I think, is at least working and working well.
00:27:53.058 - 00:28:35.314, Speaker D: Let's imagine a scenario where we're not necessarily in a bear market. Maybe FTX continues to operate as they were, and they don't get this liquidity crunch and everything gets exposed. They had multiple investments in competing blockchains, as you said, Ben. Right. Was it aptos and a few others? I think they're basically touching everything. So, one, it sounds to me like, I mean, they were very mercenary, like a lot of other folks, but they were just there to, they built some infra to then take advantage of the opportunity and then pocket as much capital as possible.
00:28:35.744 - 00:28:36.880, Speaker A: They were probably going to do that.
00:28:36.912 - 00:29:19.196, Speaker D: With other chains, too. Right now, what I want to get to the heart of is, was there anything in particular that you guys would say, hey, we had a more intimate relationship with Sam versus aptos, for instance, and maybe these things take time, but I'm just trying to get to a better understanding of Sam could have probably, in FTX, Alameda would have done this with other chains, and they were probably setting it up to do it that way. Is that true, or would you say that they were morally focused on building infrastructure in Solana and then supporting it to then launch a bunch of tokens and profit?
00:29:19.340 - 00:29:56.134, Speaker C: It's hard to speculate on what they would have done with the other chains. I think the reason why things transpired as they did with the Solana ecosystem is because both FTX and Solana were in similar states when Anatoly and Sam got acquainted. Sam was building a small crypto exchange that was basically a nobody at the time, and Solana was this nobody competing l one. And they found some product market fit in, central limit order book decks, and the relationship kind of blossomed from there. So it's hard to speculate on how that would have transpired with the other chains that they invested in.
00:29:59.554 - 00:30:12.922, Speaker B: How much are the protocols or, like, the Defi apps built on top of Solana hurt by this? Like, a lot of them. Maybe if they're, like, a trading platform, like, they probably got liquidity from Alameda. Like, how much are they?
00:30:13.018 - 00:30:19.506, Speaker A: Obviously, Jupiter had their biggest volume day after the FTX collapsed.
00:30:19.690 - 00:30:57.324, Speaker C: Yeah, that's not to gloss over, like, thing. Things are definitely, like, downtrodden right now, and that's not to gloss over that. But, yeah, the day when everything was happening, some of the DeFi applications did some of their best numbers ever, so infrastructurally, they're all fine. As I mentioned previously, I touched base with a lot of them. There were only about three to four that were materially impacted by FTX. Like, almost like whole treasuries stuck on FTX. And to those, they've been properly connected with VC's and other funding mechanisms to make sure that they continue building or like acquisition opportunities.
00:30:57.324 - 00:31:04.524, Speaker C: But outside of that, luckily, like, a lot of them were like, not as scathed as they could have been, which is very fortunate.
00:31:05.264 - 00:31:34.674, Speaker D: Ben, I know you've been putting out fires and you created this kind of repository website where to address and be very transparent with. As things kind of evolved and escalated fairly quickly on the beaty side of things, what are you hearing from, you know, companies or projects developers? What are their main concerns? How worried are they about this stuff and what would you say to them?
00:31:35.534 - 00:32:17.502, Speaker C: Yeah, so from what I've heard, a lot of the ones that we're building prior to all of this are pretty much continuing to build. There are some that need extra attention when you are talking to them just because, like, a lot of them aren't on crypto Twitter. They, like, get their news from the headlines and they see these headlines that are skewed in, like, sensational ways that they don't understand. So they see this headline and they're like, well, this thing said Solana's dead, and you got to explain why Solana's not dead. So from that perspective, it's a lot of just one on one conversations with people who just need answers to questions. And that's kind of why the foundation put together that fact sheet to post on the website. So we don't have to have a lot of these one on one conversations.
00:32:17.502 - 00:32:35.404, Speaker C: And you can get the information there concisely, but it's a lot of just like, you know, getting the truth out there. Frankly, the truth is like, this. These events of the last two or three weeks have sucked, but this is not going to kill Solana. And Solana is much stronger than all of this.
00:32:37.264 - 00:33:30.184, Speaker A: The NFT folks, like, kind of didn't skip a beat for the most part. Like the next day there was some launch that hit record all time highs, which to me was like, really? Like, it seems like they're in a different world, which is really encouraging because it means that crypto in general has legs that are outside of the crypto, Twitter and financial side of that cycle, that there's real product market fit for other use cases. And I think we're very blessed to have a very strong NFT community that is just really, they're paying attention to this, obviously seen the news, but are not psychologically impacted. And like, oh, shit, everything's going to go to zero. And I'm done with NFTs on Solana that they actually care about the product more than these news stories.
00:33:30.304 - 00:33:59.076, Speaker B: That was a good overview of the FTX Sam stuff. I want to get a state of the ecosystem basically from you, Anatoly, and Ben as well, just for Solana. When I look at DeFi Llama, obviously Santi mentioned this TVL, bad way to track this stuff. But like, that's the metric I'm looking at, and I see ETH down 25%, polygon down 20%, avalanche down 40%. So like some, some big numbers, these things are down a lot. Solana is down 71%. Right.
00:33:59.076 - 00:34:04.964, Speaker B: And is now the 10th biggest ecosystem. I just love to get a state of the ecosystem from you, Anatoly.
00:34:05.124 - 00:34:47.296, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of, you know, like, I don't know if FTX had as big of it had, would have had as big of an impact. If the mango hack didn't happen, like right before, it was like a kind of two bad news really close hand in hand. Like, I think really were really bad for Solana Defi. But like, the folks that are building are still there and like, they're launching new products. So I think mango is going to launch before, in like first week of December. And they're really strong teams. So, you know, CRM got forked almost immediately because there was this belief that there's risk to the upgrade authority for the CRM program.
00:34:47.296 - 00:35:43.314, Speaker A: People weren't sure if the hacker or was moving money out of FTX had access to those keys. So within 24 hours, like, there were enough external developers to really get serum up and running, that was like, I think kind of like, I was like holding my breath, like, fuck, everything is falling apart. But when I saw that, like, recover that there were open source devs that just knew what to do and found their own market makers, like, people you never heard of. Like, these are like small time hobbyist market makers that were just like, sure, I will go and support this, like, fork and like, get it up and running. That really, like, kind of made me like, calm down and feel like, okay, there's people that are doing stuff where we're not even involved. I wouldn't even know how to get that to work because I'm not a market maker. It just felt like there's actual people that care and can get shit done.
00:35:43.314 - 00:36:27.878, Speaker A: That's the most important thing. I think at the end of the day, you need to launch products. Those products have to be good. If they're measured by TVL, you still have to launch awesome products and attract at TVL. I think that cycle is going to continue and going to keep happening on Solana. I'm not as much worried about raw dollar numbers of TVL as I am about percentage of Sol in defi, and that's been definitely down because of both the mango hack and the FTX thing. And I would like to see that recover and start seeing products that are attracting new capital and, like, in new ways.
00:36:28.046 - 00:36:53.014, Speaker B: Yeah, it reminds me of what you said about those market makers. There's this Chris Berniske tweet about Solana from a week or two ago. He's like, this is a big thread. It's a good thread about Solana. We can link it in the show notes. But he said the fourth one now he's like, my view, the Solana ecosystem emerges from this just as Ethereum merged. I'm just reading this now emerged from 2018 2019 purged of opportunists with a hardened focus, tightly bonded community, and unstoppable commitment to the cause.
00:36:53.014 - 00:36:57.156, Speaker B: More anti of fragile than when it entered the bear, which, like, pretty.
00:36:57.220 - 00:36:58.904, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome, man.
00:36:59.644 - 00:37:15.944, Speaker B: Chris is like, yeah, what's, what, I mean, what's going on? Like, why? I feel like Chris is. I mean, Chris is one of my favorite, like, thinkers and people in the space, like, why is he taking such an optimistic bent on Solana here? Like, are you guys in conversations with him? What's going on there?
00:37:16.684 - 00:37:52.074, Speaker A: There was a lot of, like, surprisingly during this fall, like, a lot of folks with Ethan, their name, that were just dming me with support. It was really, like, uplifting to see. I think. I think at the end of the day, what we're building, this idea of globally synchronized information system for finance, it fits with the decentralization ethos. We're not trying to replace Ethereum. We're not trying to build a product that is the ETH killer. It has its own place and its own niche, and I think a lot of people appreciate that.
00:37:52.074 - 00:37:56.534, Speaker A: Like, surprising and awesome to see. Like, yeah.
00:37:56.654 - 00:38:30.194, Speaker C: To just, like, elaborate on that. I think that something that we were blind to before all of this was how our perceived involvement with FTX was preventing people from getting into the ecosystem. And now that it's very public that they've been removed from the ecosystem, it's kind of de risked it for a lot of people, and people actually see a lot of value here, and they think it's more of an even playing field. So that's why we've been able to, like, open up to more of these people who you would never think would be Solana ecosystem participant and are suddenly super interested in what's being built here in the long term value.
00:38:32.494 - 00:39:17.714, Speaker D: I think Ben, you and I have talked about this, but Anatolia, I think in one episode as well, but do you think that Solana has been unfairly criticized time and time again as being. Maybe it's because of your success, maybe it's now with FTX giving more reasons to people that have hated on you guys for a while. How is that experience? Because I think from my vantage point, you guys have taken a beating and constantly take a beating from a very vocal minority in crypto and just in certain circles where. How much do you pay attention to that? Have you like, is that you just accepted the fact that it's going to always live there and you just build a chip and not listen.
00:39:17.794 - 00:40:04.096, Speaker A: I see it as like a challenge. I'm going to convert Evan Vanessa to be a Solana maxi. I think, I honestly, like think that a lot of the Fud and not the fud, but a lot of the criticism coming from intelligent folks in the community is very much fair and I try to address it. And in some ways, our engineering roadmap has changed because of what's happening in Ethereum. So that's been a very natural, awesome part of open source development. Just being in the open and showing your cards, having people shit on your design, and then like finding the kernel of truth right in that criticism. Like, okay, you're right about this and we can fix that.
00:40:04.096 - 00:40:26.714, Speaker A: Like, I think that's a very awesome process that accelerates the entire space. This is like people arguing on the Internet about tech, man. Like people were arguing about Linux file systems in the nineties. Like, what, what file system you picked in your kernel config was like a, a religious battle on the forum. So I couldn't take it like that.
00:40:27.494 - 00:41:45.674, Speaker C: I think, look, to address the question directly, to say it's been like psychologically easy to take this much criticism consistently for the last two and a half years has been tough, especially when you're ecosystem facing, like working with teams, because these also affect the participants in your ecosystem. So when there's bad news in the news, they're getting messages from their investors like, what the hell is going on with Solana? Why are you still building there? And they're coming to us for answers. And so making sure that, like, you know, you're, like, I constantly refer to myself as a glorified customer support agent. Like, I'm constantly answering these questions for people and like, giving them the reassurance that they need that, like, you know, they're not, they're not on something that's, like, broken and, like, these are misconceptions and here's the right information. But I think it's, I think it's like, to Tully's point, like, people arguing about, like, Linux kernel setups on forums. I think there's a component of this that makes it increasingly hard is because crypto is so Twitter based, and it being so Twitter based means that, like, misconceptions, fake news, and, like, virality plays a lot into getting your information out there. So if you're not good at consistently combating that news from, like, you know, a non Twitter account that can just make some shit up, and then, like, suddenly that's the prevailing thought about how Solana is.
00:41:45.674 - 00:42:07.914, Speaker C: It's pretty exhausting to constantly have to fight that battle. But I think that ultimately you don't make improvements on world changing tech. We think we're going to build a global state machine that's going to scale to billions of users. You don't make that kind of step function improvement without some trial and error and some punches in the face. I think we're all collectively here to take those.
00:42:08.934 - 00:42:34.654, Speaker B: What do you think out here? Chewing glass, fellas? What do you guys, what do you guys think are some of the fair criticism? Like, I think Santiago is right. You guys do take a lot of heat. What do you think are some of the fair criticisms? And then what are some of the things, like, guys, you clearly just don't understand how some of this stuff is built. Like, yes, there was an outage, but that'll get figured out. And then maybe there are some other things that you're like, ah, shit, that is a big problem. We really do have to figure that out.
00:42:35.074 - 00:43:19.368, Speaker A: Yeah. The way our fee mechanism worked prior to the outages was criticized fairly and was wrong. And it took like, a real, like, okay, I saw it fail live to start really thinking about and how to fix it. And that was like, I think, a very fair criticism that a lot of folks early on layered on Solana, and it took like, a live failure for us to figure out why it actually failed. And if we didn't fail it, we wouldn't have come up with an innovation. I think localized fee markets are really cool and very different from how ethereum works in terms of their fee mechanism and mempools. And I think what we built is even better.
00:43:19.368 - 00:44:11.848, Speaker A: But it took some failures to get here. I think what influenced me was actually one of the podcasts that I did with Dkradi on security. In that discussion, he made a very strong point on how minimizing the security assumptions is really important for the network to get away from majority having reliance on an anonymous majority. This is where diet clients and that design came from, where we want to provide the same minority. If a small minority in the network is honest, then you at least get a signal that the majority is corrupt and you can stop accepting the chain and then go to social consensus and yada yada. Like, stuff like this, I think is very much awesome. It's just the best of open source development.
00:44:11.848 - 00:44:52.464, Speaker A: I don't know if you ever worked at a big company. I spent a decade at Qualcomm. There was none of this collaboration with competitors. You weren't writing code in the open. You have to ask your boss, can we use this open source library? This is like the most amazing engineering environment I think anyone could have is like, working in crypto right now, because not only is all your work you're doing open source, but you can literally, like, talk to your competitors and, like, if they shit on you with like, a kernel of truth, you're like, holy shit, you're right. Let me go fix that, and then we'll use the research that you've done to, like, fix, fix these problems and improve my, what I'm working on. I think that part has been awesome.
00:44:52.464 - 00:45:27.894, Speaker A: I think it's a pretty dumb, unfair argument to just say that Solana is not decentralized. I think you're not really looking under the hood and understanding that the cost of the hardware is the cheapest possible cost that you can have to achieve what we're doing. You may not want a global price synchronized price discovery engine. That may be not something that you care about. That's great. Go use Ethereum. You can get settlement guarantees there, but a lot of people want that, and that's actually very important for finance.
00:45:27.894 - 00:46:06.224, Speaker A: Like, you look at the traditional trade fi stack, all of the money is not made in settlement, it's made in execution. If you swapped out the settlement house with Ethereum, all that money is still going to be made by all these centralized entities that do the same shit that Robinhood pulled on. Unlike the GME stock with Citadel, like, all of that would still happen. And you need an open, decentralized, like, execution engine. You need, like, truly open price discovery, where, like, any hobbyist can plug in a hunk of organized sand and get in the same level playing field as jump. That needs to exist for you to actually disrupt that. Yeah.
00:46:06.224 - 00:46:16.392, Speaker A: So a lot of people that get that, get what we're doing and like, get the ethos and understand that that's very much decentralized and very much like an important thing to achieve.
00:46:16.568 - 00:46:30.124, Speaker B: Yeah. One of the big criticisms of Solana this year, I feel like, was less about the decentralization, but sometimes more about the outages. My understanding of the outages was everyone was basically wanting to hit the same state flooding in Spanish.
00:46:31.624 - 00:46:40.664, Speaker A: This was very much a fair criticism, and we had to, I think, get punched in the face to see how it was broken up with a good solution.
00:46:40.704 - 00:46:45.498, Speaker B: It's the stake weighted quality of service, I think is the solution here.
00:46:45.666 - 00:46:50.698, Speaker A: It's like three components. So, like, when we built this thing.
00:46:50.746 - 00:46:55.066, Speaker C: We thought, totally, you want to just overview quick QoS and fee markets.
00:46:55.210 - 00:47:22.464, Speaker A: Yeah. When we built Solana, like blockchain and Nasdaq speed, I thought most of the transactions are going to be like serum. And we were right about that. Literally 80% of the throughput was handling, like, market maker orders. And they're very small transactions. They take very short amount of computer and touch a very small amount of space. And the way that our fee mechanism works is we charge by signature, because the signature verification part was the most expensive part of the whole thing.
00:47:22.464 - 00:48:33.364, Speaker A: But as developers started asking for more features and wanted to compose shit across lending protocols and all these other things, you started getting very complex transactions that were very expensive. And on top of that, when you start seeing like things like an NFT mint, even though those transactions were very, still very simple, very small, you had like, we literally saw 100 gigabit worth of traffic hit a single block producer that were all NFT mint transactions touching the same mint account. Bitfinex called it a DDoS when they published, oh, we had like a DDoS attack that was 100 gigabit. We were like, no, this is just, this is just like people that won an NFT mint. We didn't realize that, I mean, like, people were laying out that criticism correctly. And I was, I think, I don't know, I thought that, one, we could process that much data that quickly, and two, that there was enough redundancy between leaders that at least some of the transactions would get through and it wouldn't be as bad as it was. And the other mechanism was start kick in.
00:48:33.364 - 00:49:08.516, Speaker A: So that was totally wrong. So we had to throw that design out of the water and figure out what is actually happening in the network and how can we solve it. And we didn't want to solve it in the same way. That Ethereum does, because there's a very clear bug in how memples work. When you have an NFT mint and a liquidation and oracle update at the same time and there's congestion, everyone doesn't know what the price is to get into the block, but everyone is desperate to get into that block, no matter the cost. Because if you miss that oracle update, then your chain link your fucks. If you miss the liquidation, you missed that huge opportunity.
00:49:08.516 - 00:49:49.422, Speaker A: So everyone prices it at the maximum amount, bidding against all these other, like, all these other use cases. And this is why you have, like, literally $4,000 fees on Ethereum, even though the number of transactions today, right now on Ethereum is exactly the same as a year ago. The fees. The fees are much, much lower now because you don't have that, like, hotspot contention. This is like a classic database problem, and the only way to solve it is isolation. And you can do Cosmo style, you separate everything into different apps and they're totally isolated from each other. Or you do, like, transaction isolation, which is old school database stuff.
00:49:49.422 - 00:51:11.390, Speaker A: You make sure that transactions that touch the same, that touch different parts of the state can be processed in parallel, effectively with their own congestion control that's very localized to those. And unless we saw how we failed, I don't think we would have come to that design, and then we just wouldn't even have, like, you know, the, like, we couldn't, I don't think, even get, like, serum to work if we just launched with a normal mempool. So that was learning, and, like, I think, important learning for us to have the. This was like, these 100 gigabit floods of data is what caused the congestion and then ultimately caused the outages when that much data hit, like a programming error where you weren't freeing memory fast enough in some queue, and you just literally saw ram run out on these systems within seconds. Yeah, like a system that was running fine, all of a sudden it's trying to drop 100 gigabits worth of duplicate messages, and it wasn't dropping fast enough, and data was getting stale in sub queue, and that queue would blow up to, like, you know, 200 gigs worth of memory, and that thing will crash. Then when you have a third of the network experience, that you get a byzantine fault, right? Because more than a third failed, and you gotta take some intervention. Those bugs got fixed, and then the solution just, like, actually finally rolled out.
00:51:11.390 - 00:51:42.294, Speaker A: There's no more udp. The way that it works is that we can isolate each of these states as separate think of them as separate mempools, separate fee markets. So when you look at a whole pile of transactions and you're packing blocks, you pick all the ones from the hottest, most important ones in parallel, at the same time. So one way to think about is you're running a bunch of different auctions, and then you pick the top ten auctions that are the highest grossing ones, and you only fit those into the block.
00:51:43.274 - 00:51:52.118, Speaker B: Oh, that's interesting. So now you basically added this prioritization fee. So before, spam was really the only way to compete, and now you have a prioritization fee.
00:51:52.286 - 00:51:57.918, Speaker A: And this comes down to, I think, fundamentally what these networks is that.
00:51:58.006 - 00:52:09.438, Speaker B: I just want to make sure I understand that Anatolia is that that's what you guys mean by the local fee market. The local fee market is basically allowing users to have their transaction included over others by adding the prioritization fee.
00:52:09.566 - 00:52:27.364, Speaker C: Yeah, and there's no global fee system, so it's like different pieces of state will have separate fee markets. So, like, if you're doing an NFT mint, but somebody else over here is doing a DeFi thing, if the DeFi thing is not hotly contested state, they're going to have base level fee, but the NFT mint is going to have. You'll be able to compete via.
00:52:28.144 - 00:52:30.816, Speaker B: It's a new way to compete for transaction inclusion.
00:52:31.000 - 00:53:16.056, Speaker A: So we literally, we got a demonstration that was working during the FTX shit show. There was a huge volume spikes. And you saw that, like, it wasn't perfect. You saw confirmation times increase for, like, transfers or Solana pings, but they were still landing despite all of these bots and liquidation bots slamming the network and trying to spam and, like, take 100% of the block. So, like, that thing that looks at a whole pile of transactions that are coming in, it's trying to identify. Okay, I can only take, let's say, the first 500 that are doing this, like, liquidation. I can pack those in into the block and then I have to go find something that isn't a liquidation for that particular market.
00:53:16.056 - 00:53:31.856, Speaker A: And that search takes time. And if it can search fast enough and drop those irrelevant transactions fast enough, it can then pack in maybe an NFT mint or a transfer, or like a Solana ping message. And I think it is right, like.
00:53:31.880 - 00:53:33.384, Speaker C: You'Re breaking Yano's brain over there.
00:53:33.424 - 00:53:47.224, Speaker B: No, no, I actually really get it. No, I didn't get it until just now. That's. I read, like, quick. There's like, quick qos and the local fee markets, and I was like, all right, those three things together, I didn't get how these three things come together until just now.
00:53:47.604 - 00:54:24.584, Speaker A: So that, that, like, process of, like, searching for the top grossing things for different state, right? That has to happen alongside when you're the block producer, when you're receiving data, or you, when you're a random validator that's receiving data and then forwarding it, you have to run that same process because you don't want to allow an attacker that's just like paying one lamport over everyone else to just spam and fill up all the queues, preventing the searcher from finding the other opportunities so that it's like a knapsack problem. It's mp complete, but that doesn't mean anything. It means that it's just like a pain in the ass to optimize.
00:54:25.044 - 00:54:29.284, Speaker B: At the risk of sounding, well, is q u I c. Do you guys pronounce that quick? Is that quick?
00:54:29.324 - 00:54:30.144, Speaker A: Yeah, quick.
00:54:30.884 - 00:54:53.392, Speaker B: At the risk of sounding really, really foolish here and making kind of embarrassing myself, can I try to explain those three things to you guys and see if layman's terms. So, okay, so this local, I guess the starting with quick, quick, basically, like, in a nutshell, just gives validators more control over the traffic and prevent spams from, like, overwhelming validators. Is that right?
00:54:53.528 - 00:54:54.244, Speaker C: Yes.
00:54:54.704 - 00:55:04.000, Speaker A: So they can cap the amount of traffic they get to, like, one gigabit instead of like, okay, I'm going to process stuff as fast as I can get, which hit 100 gigabit on some of these boxes.
00:55:04.192 - 00:55:15.376, Speaker B: The stake weighted QoS makes it so that validators can basically just forward transactions to the leader based on stake weight. Is that right?
00:55:15.480 - 00:55:31.712, Speaker A: It means that, like, if you're unstaked or you have like, a very small amount of stake or even a very large amount of stake, you can't flood the leader and deny everyone else. If I have half of a percent of a stake, the 99.5 can't flood me out.
00:55:31.888 - 00:55:38.264, Speaker B: So the leaders getting spammed with stuff like other validators can forward transaction, right? Okay.
00:55:38.304 - 00:55:50.704, Speaker A: This guarantees that everyone has, like, some stake weighted amount of voice. It's not a prioritization scheme, but it prevents people from flooding the leader with, like, overwhelming amount of data from a single source.
00:55:50.864 - 00:56:02.774, Speaker B: And then the local fee markets is what we just talked about, which that allows the user to have their transaction included over others by adding that prioritization fee. Right now, the only way to do it is with, is the only way to compete is really with spam.
00:56:04.514 - 00:56:30.722, Speaker A: And you need these other two components, because if you only just had like, fee prioritization. Then I will just like, flood the thing that's prioritizing fees and push everyone out. So the only thing that that searcher has access to are my transactions. Right. So you need to like, start shaping traffic and limiting the amount of spam that anyone can send to where it's more beneficial for them to increase the fee than to send to messages.
00:56:30.858 - 00:56:35.694, Speaker B: Got it. Santi, do you want to pull me out of the weeds of this at all or.
00:56:38.154 - 00:56:40.394, Speaker A: We had to see, like, us fall.
00:56:40.514 - 00:56:53.546, Speaker B: Like, I didn't know. I didn't know. That's a. I now realize what just happened, which is you guys kind of fell on your face a couple of times and you figured out a technical solution here. Well, or at least you have a thesis of that this will work.
00:56:53.570 - 00:57:12.698, Speaker A: So we knew pretty quickly what we needed to fix. It's just release shipping. Layer one code fucking sucks, man. It just takes a very long time to battle test to get. Go through audits and get this stuff out. So the 1.9 release was the one that was really brittle.
00:57:12.698 - 00:57:31.268, Speaker A: And you saw in April just congestion was constantly happening and all this other shit. And as soon as we ship 1.10, like, even though we had like an outage later, that was just a random, stupid non determinism in the runtime, like, performance and congestion was just like improved by, you know, dramatically.
00:57:31.436 - 00:57:32.184, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:34.084 - 00:57:38.184, Speaker A: 2 seconds. Like, everything was much, much better. And the latest release is even better.
00:57:38.564 - 00:58:09.824, Speaker B: I have one other question. Sorry, Santi, I'm curious just to Anatoly or Ben to get your guys takes on just monolithic blockchains. Like, I'm just curious, how is your guys mind, like, the last several months we've seen l two s have a ton of success. Arbitrum's had a lot of success. Optimism had a lot of success. What's going on in the ZK space is super, super interesting. I'm just curious, how has your guys mindset changed on roll ups? Either optimistic or zk as well as maybe app chains too, compared to the monolithic blockchain thesis.
00:58:11.084 - 00:59:01.756, Speaker A: I am this really focused on this idea of having a global information sync that this could be the place where state transitions move at the speed of light through fiber. That has to be a layer one. There's no way to, like, split that up into a L2. There's no way to, like, if you, if this thing needs to exist and serves a world, like some, creates value for the world. The way that we're implementing it, I think is the. Is the only way to do it, like you need a single layer that's BFT, that's globally synchronized without sharding or any subcommittees. Now that on top of this thing you could have like a single sequencer L2, which does derivatives and gives you that like high frequency trading sub one millisecond, like confirmation time for that tiny market.
00:59:01.756 - 00:59:54.586, Speaker A: But I think having that thing synchronized with the Solana every 100 milliseconds is a really compelling product that's better than what centralized exchanges offer. So there is, I think, reason for you to have smaller marketplaces that are much, much faster that synchronize on top of this single giant state machine. The technologies that are people developing for L2s all would work on Solana. They would totally work fine. They would even work better because you get to synchronize your state much, much faster. I think all that stuff is awesome. There's a couple teams that are thinking about it in those terms, actually building HFT derivatives thing that's running on top of Solana and it has very high frequency oracle updates and all it needs is a stable coin that's bridged into it.
00:59:54.586 - 01:00:00.694, Speaker A: And that's all it does. Those kinds of products, I think make a ton of sense. It would be super easy to build.
01:00:01.054 - 01:00:29.362, Speaker B: Yeah. Is there anything that you guys learned from these l two s and from these roll ups though? Like, like when I, Solana was kind of the first, like optimized ETH. Like prior to roll ups, Solana was the optimized ETH. Like what's the new Solana look like? What's the new, I mean, we just went over a bunch of that stuff. But like, when you think about the next couple of years, like what's the new Solana look like? Maybe better put, like, are there new learnings or things that you want to put in place, like the move programming language or, or anything like that?
01:00:29.538 - 01:00:48.290, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff like I think what I've borrowed, like what I see that's interesting that's happening in the industry is like lines or these providing users with minority, honest minority assumptions. I think that's really important. So because I don't think any network is going to have 8 billion nodes.
01:00:48.402 - 01:00:49.386, Speaker B: Wait, I don't get that.
01:00:49.410 - 01:01:03.576, Speaker A: Can you, so like Ethereum is not going to. Ethereum has like about 7000 full nodes. That's the security of the network. Bitcoin's at about 12,000. Solana is about 3000. We're not going to see a world with 8 billion full networks.
01:01:03.600 - 01:01:05.120, Speaker C: Oh yeah, I see, right.
01:01:05.232 - 01:01:57.182, Speaker A: So how does a user know that the network is in line to them? Is the only way to do that is you either run a full node where you have full guarantees, or you do a like client protocol. Like you sample the network and you get assumptions that if, let's say, 5% of the network is honest, at least 5%, then I'm not screwed. That there's no way that the network is screwing me. So these are the honest minority assumptions. I think those are really, really important for a mature layer, one with a decent number of nodes like Solana to scale to a very large number of users, because you still want to provide those users very high guarantees. Because once you have them, I think the chance of the majority going rogue become virtually zero because you can't pull off on attack because of these protocols. No one's even going to try.
01:01:57.182 - 01:02:40.888, Speaker A: And I think that that's a really important thing to have eventually. So that's very much like after I had that debate with Dankrad and his point made a lot of sense to me. I started thinking about this, how can we implement this in Solana? There's a design out, and I'm hoping somebody picks it up and builds it out over the next year. So that's like one thing I think from move. This was actually also, I think move itself as a programming language, I think is a pretty good innovation. And it's really interesting. That Berkeley packet filter, which is Solana's bytecode, based on that was one of the first proof carrying codes.
01:02:40.888 - 01:03:34.024, Speaker A: The Linux kernel guys actually added a type system to BPF, called BPF type format BTF recently. And it does a lot of the things that the move verifier does. So it does checking of the types and making sure when you join programs that they're joined correctly or the verifier fails. This is something that I want to add or like to the runtime. So then we can have move compile to Solana bytecode format that has native move verification and interfaces with Rust. And rust itself now has those verified. That level of provability between two rust programs, if you call, instead of trying to compose these complicated cross program invocations, if you have a program in Solana, you know what a CPI is, you have to basically build a transaction between one program to another.
01:03:34.024 - 01:03:57.422, Speaker A: You can now just call a function like you do a library as a programmer, and that will make the developer experience, I think, a thousand times easier. So stuff like this, I think I see in the industry that I want Solana to adopt. And that's one of the challenges that I've posted on Twitter, like, hey, these are the things that we need to build amongst a bunch of performance optimizations along this thread.
01:03:57.518 - 01:04:26.444, Speaker D: Maybe just wrap it up is you've seen now, I guess at the time you were building Solana, I think you had a pretty fresh take on it versus copycats of Ethereum, but nonetheless, a lot of it was centered around how can we make something better functional. Now you've seen other chains launch. What have you learned from the new designs, if anything, and anything that you've implemented into the roadmap and the technical aspects of the chain.
01:04:29.834 - 01:05:24.094, Speaker A: So I think no one else is like, really building for this, like one single giant quorum. So a lot of the networking consensus stuff, we're, I think, still like the innovator there, that's been kind of like, sad. No one wants to like, go tell us how to, how to build a better version of that, because that would have been actually, like, I think, awesome. Like, a lot of our work that we do is in that deep networking code. And it's like if then if Solana had 100 nodes, I don't even think we would have had any, like, congestion problems because it's just much easier to set up firewalls and deal with these floods of traffic when you're dealing with 100 reliable operators that you can go call them up and tell, okay, guys, this seems like a bug in our code, but this is how you set up these firewalls to deal with this traffic. Just once you get to a few thousand, it's intractable. There's no way to coordinate anything like that.
01:05:24.094 - 01:06:21.290, Speaker A: That part I think has been, like, sad. But like, on the security side, ethereum folks are awesome and have been like super, super forward thinking. And I think move, I think is a very forward thinking by code that has a lot of awesome things for us that we can learn on ZK and later. Twos have not been on my mind as much because they're still, performance wise, they're just still not quite there yet. It still takes way too much time to prove a complex thing like something like serum, like DydX is a pretty good example. The prover times for just trades were taking like two to 2 hours around for like 10,000 trades. And this is excluding like, the actual orders, right? We're not even talking about proving the orders landed unchained.
01:06:21.290 - 01:06:28.946, Speaker A: This is post matching. You match just the trades and then you prove those out. It's just not yet like, it's not.
01:06:28.970 - 01:06:29.842, Speaker D: Ready for prime time.
01:06:29.938 - 01:06:53.496, Speaker A: Yeah, there's just. It could be ready for certain, for certain use cases. But when that, when those 10,000 trades take like you know, that would take like four slots which is like I don't know, 1.6 seconds to verify in Solana like you're. It's just the. Why would you wait 2 hours versus having spend 1.6 seconds and do directly on chain?
01:06:53.640 - 01:07:31.158, Speaker D: Yeah, we talked about on a prior episode with Nick Carter. This is something that I think about a lot is the security sustainability of a chain. Certainly bitcoin puts into question block rewards versus fees. Fees are very low, block rewards are high, but they're dwindling. How do you think about the economic sustainability of Solana? You have massive transaction volume below fees. And so how do you maybe for like a layman person first start with how do you create a viable economic model for security currently?
01:07:31.326 - 01:07:32.190, Speaker A: Is it subsidized?
01:07:32.222 - 01:07:33.354, Speaker D: And then long term.
01:07:35.494 - 01:08:19.370, Speaker A: There'S about like over a third or like let's say 1203 thousand. Machines are machines that are RPC boxes. They're serving some business that's running on chain that has a demand for state that doesn't care about the block rewards at all. They don't care about the fees that the network collects. They actually, what they care about is the data that represents ownership of jpegs that's being propagated through this network. Jpegs or like maybe price feeds or whatever. But that 1200 boxes is bigger than most other layer ones and they have no dependencies on the tokenomics of the network.
01:08:19.370 - 01:09:14.205, Speaker A: And they provide the same amount of security because all you need is one of those machines to be the honest node that says hey look, the majority did something faulted and here's the proof of that illegal state transition. That's all you need is really just any one of those. So I think security wise, what's really, really important for layer one is that it's permissionless that anyone can join and observe all the state and observe all the state transitions and that it has product market fit that people actually have a need to join. And preferably that need is actually external to the tokenomics that they're running a business. They're doing stuff in the real world that depends on the state. And to them the infra costs are negligible and virtually nothing. I think that would definitely cover and pay for security on the network.
01:09:14.205 - 01:09:56.244, Speaker A: I think to me that's a very simple and viable way. I think in terms of how networks accrue value, that's a very interesting question. And I've kind of, in my early podcast, we didn't even call it Mav at the time, I was just thinking like, this is blockchain and SXP, and it's running a bunch of exchanges. Then a validator as a block producer is optimizing order flow. There's value to that, so there's value to the network just from that. But I think it's more nuanced than that. I think, functionally, how the networks need to work is when I increase my fee, I need to.
01:09:56.244 - 01:10:30.830, Speaker A: That fee increase in my transaction has to guarantee reliability. Like, if I bump my fee instead of sending two messages or like ten, or spamming the network, if all I need to do is just increase my. The price that I'm willing to pay by the smallest amount, that I have a guarantee that I arrive first. If the technology can deliver that, then the network can start accruing map reward. And that's basically, I think, the really hard challenge. And that took, I think, some learning. This is not something that it's connected, I think, until maybe the last six months.
01:10:31.022 - 01:10:57.674, Speaker B: Hey, Ben, I want to throw it to you for a second. Obviously, this stuff isn't zero sum, but let's say the only two other chains in the world were. The only two other ecosystems were cosmos ecosystem and the avalanche ecosystem. Who do you consider to be more of a. Like a threat to stealing market share from Solana, who's a closer competitor or a competitor you worry about more? Maybe?
01:10:58.174 - 01:11:39.240, Speaker C: I don't know if I would consider them threats. I mean, I constantly talk about this all the time, and it's in my Twitter bio that, like, I love playing positive sum games, and we are definitely still in the phase of positive sum in crypto. There's a lot, like, right now, we're just like, this collective hive mind that is taking different shots at scaling blockchains and applications of blockchains. And I think that all collectively, we're all moving in the same direction and we're feeding off of each other. Like, Solana wouldn't be here without Ethereum, and the evm chains wouldn't be here without Ethereum. And Cosmos pioneered this app chain, thesis, which is giving light to other designs. So I don't think of them as competitors, at least right now.
01:11:39.240 - 01:11:48.534, Speaker C: Maybe at some point in the future it becomes zero sum. But for the time being, I really think that we're all collectively feeding off of each other, and it's a platform positive sum environment.
01:11:48.834 - 01:11:51.042, Speaker B: Can I push back actually, for a second?
01:11:51.138 - 01:11:52.894, Speaker A: I think everyone is a competitor.
01:11:53.954 - 01:12:24.672, Speaker B: Yeah, well, okay, so that was a play. Nice answer, but I know what you're saying with, like, we're still so early, these ecosystems, it's zero sum. It's not zero sum, it's positive. Like, I see what you're saying. I think there's a clear zero sum game, though, when it comes to amazing entrepreneurs building on in your ecosystem. Like, Stani choosing to build aave in ETH instead of. I mean, Solana didn't exist back then, but, like, instead of on Solana is bad for Solana.
01:12:24.672 - 01:12:45.294, Speaker B: It is good for ETH. Like that, like, uniswap existing in ETH instead of on Solana is good for ETH. And I think the zero sum game that you need to win as an l one is getting the world class entrepreneurs to build on your l one. And I think that's where I'd push back. That feels like if I'm building an l one, that's the game I have to win.
01:12:45.424 - 01:13:02.054, Speaker A: Cosmos, I would say. Yeah, I think Cosmos is, like, I think, very robust tools for spinning up your own private network. And there's a lot of things you can do with your own private network, like your own validator stuff.
01:13:03.554 - 01:13:31.038, Speaker C: The tendermint infrastructure. I mean, I've just been a fan of since I was at my multicoin days. I mean, like, I think that they've done a fantastic job over there. Honestly. I think, like, IBC has, has not taken off in the way that they thought it was going to, but, like, regardless of that, they have still been able to stimulate a lot of development on tendermint. And, like, assuming that, you know, you figure out that that connective tissue at some point that works for everybody, then, you know, it's going to be a massively large ecosystem that can all feed off of you.
01:13:31.206 - 01:14:15.254, Speaker A: And, like, one of the reasons why I think, like, is really, really important to a layer one is to have its own unique runtime, because the runtime is your interface. To developers, this is the sticky thing. Developers will pick programming languages, virtual machines, operating systems, for very peculiar, unique reasons. And when they do aggregate around a certain thing, that's your community. And I think running EVM is not going to give you that. People that are deploying an EVM that are not on Ethereum are Ethereum developers that just happen to be, like, in another neighborhood or something. They're like, e depth.
01:14:15.254 - 01:14:52.224, Speaker A: You're not, like, building your own, like, group of weirdos that are super into your particular programming language and how you design and, like, pick, pick trade offs. So I think this is the strength of Cosmos is it gives people that like opportunity as an engineer to go deep into like the SDK and figure out what's the best way for me to structure my code and optimize it. And that is a very satisfying thing to do as an engineer. It's like my relationship with my Linux box. It's very important to me as an engineer. This is why I started building a Linux.
01:14:52.304 - 01:14:53.496, Speaker B: You love Linux.
01:14:53.680 - 01:14:55.464, Speaker A: I had that control, right?
01:14:55.624 - 01:14:57.164, Speaker B: You always talk about Linux.
01:14:59.414 - 01:15:06.714, Speaker D: To be fair though, like, so we had the Cosmos guys on and I asked him the same question. It's like they just don't have the BD muscle.
01:15:07.894 - 01:15:08.950, Speaker B: They don't, they don't have a Ben.
01:15:08.982 - 01:15:15.958, Speaker D: Spare angle and they don't. And IBC took a lot like two years lately, late.
01:15:16.086 - 01:15:17.474, Speaker C: But what is BD?
01:15:17.814 - 01:15:22.086, Speaker D: Well, that, well, I guess you have, we have your BD guy here, so.
01:15:22.190 - 01:15:23.326, Speaker C: We'Re getting pretty meta.
01:15:23.430 - 01:15:25.154, Speaker D: Maybe he should, maybe.
01:15:26.774 - 01:15:28.754, Speaker B: Why would I ever hire a BD person?
01:15:29.484 - 01:15:49.812, Speaker D: Listen, you, you have successful, I mean, look at Polygon. Polygon has what I think event did a fantastic hire of the guy from YouTube and they've been crushing the BD game. You guys have to some extent also crushed the BD game until recently. But Ben, you know, why don't you tell us?
01:15:49.828 - 01:16:42.804, Speaker C: I think, I think BD in crypto is a lot like decentralization. When people, when people talk about decentralization, they talk about stake decentralization and node decentralization and all of decentralization of data centers or wherever you're running your nodes. And there's so many different composites of decentralization. Same goes for BD. BD could include brand marketing, BD could include talking to ecosystem projects, BD could include getting new developers into the ecosystem. BD could include web two companies or Fortune 500 companies, which has been closely associated with what Polygon has been doing with a lot of these larger company. So inherently what we've taken from like a BD perspective is like grassroots developers getting new developers in the door net new people into crypto, building specifically on the Solana blockchain for the use cases that Solana was built for.
01:16:42.804 - 01:17:32.714, Speaker C: So building unique applications, not copy paste Ethereum protocols onto Solana, because that's not inherently interesting. And then we give the ecosystem projects and the people building on Solana the tools to be like their own BD team and go out and advocate on their behalf. So like for example, you bring Magic Eden into the ecosystem and suddenly magic Eden's BD team is going out and bringing brands and other people to launch NFT projects on Solana rather than the foundation going directly to these companies and saying, hey, launch this NFT thing on our chain, we'll give you $10 million. And then we make a big splash about it. Now that has its own merits. There is eventually enough headlines where people see that and they're like, oh, all these other people are launching on this chain. Maybe we should do that too.
01:17:32.714 - 01:18:05.362, Speaker C: And it kind of like, skips the, it skips the diligence point. No, I'm saying theoretically, theoretically, a lot of the, a lot of people have mandates for like, web3 applications, like whether it's a Fortune 500 company or a web two company. And like, rather than doing the work themselves, they just look at the headlines like they're like any other humans and they try and like, skip over a lot of the, like, legwork. They're not going to, like, focus on like, which, which one of these chains is like the right scaling solution. A lot of these people just have a mandate and they need to launch something so they go with what, you.
01:18:05.378 - 01:18:11.690, Speaker D: Know, sounds control, f 15 key, 15 words in the, in the q one or ten k of blockchain, you know.
01:18:11.802 - 01:18:12.098, Speaker C: Right.
01:18:12.146 - 01:18:12.746, Speaker D: Pick one.
01:18:12.850 - 01:18:42.484, Speaker C: So there, so there is, so there, just to put a point on it, there's like merit to both. And that's why we're doing, like, a lot of different things. So we're doing a little bit of the first, like, for example, like during breakfast point, we launched with ASiCs, the shoe company. ASICs did a Solana pay integration where they sold 3000 units of these Solana shoes, made 600k in revenue with zero credit card fees, all in USDC, and then had an NFT associated with it that did 1000 sol in secondary volume afterward.
01:18:42.604 - 01:18:45.700, Speaker D: So like, we are, we're pioneering stepn thing or separate.
01:18:45.732 - 01:18:48.068, Speaker C: Yeah. The partnership that Asics did with Steppen.
01:18:48.116 - 01:18:48.644, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
01:18:48.724 - 01:19:17.674, Speaker C: So we're trying things on both sides of the fence and seeing which ones work out. But ultimately what we're doing from like a perspective is we want to drive more usage to the Solana blockchain. We want, like, people to use this because it's valuable to them. Like, people use the Internet because it gave them new use cases to, like, connect with people socially or do e commerce. We want them to get, we want to give them new use cases. We don't want them to launch an NFT project just because, like, they have a mandate to launch an NFT project and then nobody talks about it. Five years from now.
01:19:17.794 - 01:19:45.904, Speaker D: Yeah, I do want to touch on related to this thread. You announced a partnership with Google on Breakpoint, and this is a good transition, I think, into talking about the Solana phone. Hugely relevant now, of course, there's Apple and its monopoly on the App Store, and maybe touch on to close out the bd discussion, what you're doing with Google, what that means. And then a segue into thank you for showing it. The Solana phone.
01:19:47.844 - 01:20:13.280, Speaker A: The Google thing is like a very infrastructure oriented projects. It very much fits within their expertise at, like, Google Cloud. Solana has a lot of data. Like, it generates a big pile of data. Querying it is a huge pain in the ass. And bigquery is one of the best products for querying data sets. So them supporting a very reliable data source that's very queryable through Google is awesome.
01:20:13.280 - 01:20:31.464, Speaker A: I think that will unblock a bunch of developers. People can then plug in and build products on top of it. I think this is something that, I think if blockchain succeeds, you will have these big aws. Google Cloud, etcetera, etcetera, will give you access to that data. It's permissionless data.
01:20:31.504 - 01:20:31.656, Speaker C: Right.
01:20:31.680 - 01:21:09.816, Speaker A: They're going to have it. So that, I think, is where it makes sense for Google to compete in the ecosystem. So pretty excited about that part because I think that's having robust view and fast and low latency way to visualize that information. Create, I think, is one of the blockers for building rich applications. As the datasets gets bigger, as the composition between nfts get more intricate and all this stuff, we just need these tools to exist. The phone itself is not a partnership with Google. It is running Android.
01:21:09.920 - 01:21:13.292, Speaker B: All right, can we see it? Can you show it up to the screen?
01:21:13.428 - 01:21:14.144, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:14.524 - 01:21:15.264, Speaker B: Nice.
01:21:16.044 - 01:21:17.700, Speaker A: Yeah, he's got one that's.
01:21:17.852 - 01:21:19.668, Speaker C: I haven't. I haven't. I haven't opened mine.
01:21:19.716 - 01:21:22.652, Speaker D: I was gonna say, can you text or call Ben right now or something?
01:21:22.748 - 01:21:23.828, Speaker B: Oh, that's clean.
01:21:23.996 - 01:21:28.772, Speaker A: See? Yeah, it's got, like, a little s. This is the fingerprint scanner. You tap this.
01:21:28.908 - 01:21:32.904, Speaker B: Is this like. Oh, is this a white. How'd you do? Is this a white labeled, like.
01:21:33.204 - 01:21:33.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:33.932 - 01:21:35.004, Speaker B: Box solution.
01:21:35.044 - 01:21:36.716, Speaker A: This company, awesome privacy.
01:21:36.820 - 01:21:38.720, Speaker C: That's omni.
01:21:38.720 - 01:22:28.324, Speaker A: Yeah, Osom. It's built by Jason Keats. He was a iPad architect, iPad pro architect. He was, like, one of the first employees at Essential and started this phone company to go build, like, a privacy phone. And we got connected again, like, through an investor, but we just kind of hit it off and we want to build a web3, integration there that guarantees users to security of their seed phrase and allows developers to, one, give them access to a Dappstore that doesn't have these insane fees and free access to web. Three features you can do token gated features you can actually buy and sell tokens directly without having to pay an App Store fee. I think that part is very simple to understand.
01:22:28.324 - 01:23:10.622, Speaker A: The part that's I think, very subtle is that by moving the seed phrase into the secure enclave, developers don't have to worry about security. There's no way they can steal your seed phrase. There's no way they can take your money and run. That's very important when you're building next generation rich media applications with nfts, with games that are very complicated, that takes a lot of iteration and a lot of work to ship those. And you have to do that. Plus keep this part of code secure, never leak your seed phrase. It's a very, it just really slows down the development process by just really removing that obligation from the developers.
01:23:10.622 - 01:23:27.898, Speaker A: I think the kind of stuff that wallets do can just iterate and get much faster and better and like the stuff that people want to do with nfts and these like rich metaverse experience can actually happen here. So that's like, I think a subtle long term thing, new user behavior is.
01:23:27.946 - 01:24:04.834, Speaker C: The most exciting thing about all of this. I mean, it's the same as when the Internet went mobile. We went from desktop Internet to mobile Internet, and it gave rise to new user behavior and then thus new product that happened after that. So this is just the graduation away from desktop crypto to holding securely crypto on your phone, which gives rise to new use cases. So the one that I've been talking about the most and that I'm most excited for that kind of like intertwines with DeFi is payment like the cold start for crypto payments. Everyone knows that stablecoins are like one of the killer use cases that exist for crypto. Right now it's basically free rails on Solana to transfer money around.
01:24:04.834 - 01:24:55.474, Speaker C: But the problem is merchants don't accept crypto payments because none of the consumers have crypto on their phones or an easy way to pay with crypto. So suddenly you have a saga phone where I feel comfortable holding two, three, $4,000 on this phone, and I show up to a merchant and suddenly the merchants realize that all of their consumers have crypto on their phones. So it makes sense for them to integrate an iPad with Solana pay point of sale service on there where they can get zero fee payments and then suddenly you have the consumers and the merchants all holding crypto and then they want access to other things. Obviously some of them are going to off board and convert back into fiat for dollar denominated costs. But at the same time you give them access to applications like buying an NFT or doing some other sort of web3 enabled application natively pretty seamlessly, like just signing transactions with your thumbprint.
01:24:55.634 - 01:24:57.974, Speaker D: Dumb question. What happens if you lose your phone?
01:24:58.474 - 01:25:00.282, Speaker A: You have a recovery.
01:25:00.378 - 01:25:01.074, Speaker C: Yeah, you do.
01:25:01.114 - 01:25:08.978, Speaker D: But like for normal, this goes back to the heart of the problem, right, that you have today in most wallets, which is people are not equipped to manage their seed phrase v two.
01:25:09.066 - 01:25:21.046, Speaker A: You can do like an identity service that's got, that can talk to the trust zone certificate that's inside the enclave and then do recovery through like an NPC that's like a v two, like social recovery.
01:25:21.110 - 01:25:23.342, Speaker D: Some sort of RGB flow.
01:25:23.438 - 01:26:00.284, Speaker B: Okay, do you guys think that the driver of this phone is people who love people who love crypto and they want to like use a more crypto native phone? Or is it something like goes kind of wrong in society? It's like the Bellagio take. Like Bellagio is like really long on a crypto phone, actually. Like he had like the best advertisement ever for a crypto phone. But his reason is because one day, like Apple will do, you know, now they search your phone for like images of child pornography. Next day they search it for like images of like swear words. The next day they search it for like anything related to crypto and you're not allowed to own crypto in the US. And that's the thesis for the phone.
01:26:00.284 - 01:26:01.424, Speaker B: Like what?
01:26:02.684 - 01:26:31.530, Speaker C: There's two things right now. I think it's primarily like left curve. Early adopters who are crypto native that want this cryptophone to try it out and we're going to get new user input from that. Long term. I'm a big subscriber to Balaji and the network state and like self sovereign identity because over time, as our lives get more and more digital, it just inherently you lose more privacy. So we need to generate product that will preserve that privacy and preserve the autonomy of the individual. Long term.
01:26:31.530 - 01:26:38.634, Speaker C: I do agree that eventually you move towards it's a 1984 society and you need to make sure that you have opt out tools.
01:26:39.054 - 01:26:48.326, Speaker D: Speaking of adoption, how many users have put in an order for the phone? What do these users look like?
01:26:48.470 - 01:27:03.134, Speaker A: So we have like 6000 pre orders. Like a thousand of them just occurred. Like over a thousand of them occurred over breakpoint. So our target is like somewhere between 25 to next year.
01:27:03.674 - 01:27:10.882, Speaker D: Okay, so this time next year we'll have kind of 5100 thousand Solana phones in circulation on the wild.
01:27:11.018 - 01:27:12.634, Speaker C: And, and it's also, it's also important.
01:27:12.674 - 01:27:19.074, Speaker A: To note that that would be fucking awesome. If we had 100,000, I'd be jumping off this chair, dude.
01:27:19.114 - 01:27:44.070, Speaker B: Like, but I mean, these things happen faster than you. Anatoly, I listened to our podcast from a year ago when you came on with, with Mike and me, and you're like, if we had, there's some really low number of phantom downloads. You're like, if Phantom was downloaded, like, I think it was like 100. I'm making up numbers here 100,000 times and really it's been downloaded like 500,000. But you, the number you said was like, Phil got down a little 100,000 times. My year is a huge success. So we usually do undershoot these things.
01:27:44.182 - 01:27:52.166, Speaker D: What's the price point of this? Thousand bucks a $1,000. So, you know, a little bit cheaper than an iPhone, certainly.
01:27:52.310 - 01:27:55.414, Speaker B: And the reason to buy it now is it's a crypto native experience. Is that right?
01:27:55.454 - 01:27:56.446, Speaker C: Like, that's the selling point.
01:27:56.510 - 01:28:01.634, Speaker A: People that are preordering it are like the early super early adopters.
01:28:02.214 - 01:28:03.754, Speaker B: It's like the early tough one.
01:28:04.254 - 01:28:46.514, Speaker C: You have to pre order with USDC too. So you need to be like crypto native in some capacity to get the early, early on phone. But the point I wanted to make really quickly before we move on is the interesting component that comes with the saga phone is like the Solana mobile stack or SMS. Even if we fail at the phone here and the phone doesn't get a lot of pickup, you have the Solana mobile stack that can be integrated into Android phones that obviously you don't have the secure enclave in the phone, but you have a more intuitive user experience that makes mobile crypto a lot easier, which will also give rise to these new user behaviors and more stuff that you can input into new product design for crypto.
01:28:47.294 - 01:28:51.264, Speaker D: Could someone in Ethereum do this? And if so, why haven't they done this?
01:28:51.384 - 01:29:07.856, Speaker A: They can literally send us a pull request to add EVM, Ethereum support. I think Neon is working on it, potentially, and we will figure out how to audit and get it in there. If people want to add Ethereum support or bitcoin support, just send us pull requests.
01:29:08.000 - 01:29:52.704, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to give you guys credit, I think we appreciate we've been bombarding you with tough questions in this episode. I've always thought that this is the kind of thinking that is kind of far out there that I don't see in other teams. And I think it's a big gamble, it's a big bet, but somehow it's now become much, much more important if everyone that's following Twitter and Musk and the whole situation with the App Store is very frustrating. I invest in a lot of games. I see the frustration from the team side, and I can appreciate how some teams might want to actually just move over to Solana, because it's like, hey, here's where we have the users, and we don't have the gatekeeper, which is Apple, which is just. It's really tough.
01:29:54.964 - 01:30:23.624, Speaker A: That was the opportunity. What drove this. I looked at the numbers of magic Eden opensea users. It's not that many people. It's like 25 to 50,000 people that are actually doing anything with nfts globally. If we have this device penetrated to, like, the most web3, like, early adopters, that's a better distribution channel for devs than the big App Stores, because those are like, that's your target audience anyways, right? Like, those are the people you want to reach.
01:30:23.924 - 01:30:34.744, Speaker D: I was in New York, and I saw the Solana store in Hudson Yards. Do you plan on doing more of these experiential stores across the world? Do you have others? I know you have hacker houses.
01:30:35.144 - 01:30:57.384, Speaker C: So Solana spaces or Solana stores. I forget what the title of the entity is anyway, but they actually announced it's separate entity under the umbrella of labs, I believe. But they're launching basically, like, Solana stores, Dao, where you can basically, like, apply for, like, grant funding to, like, kind of kickstart your store. So it's kind of like a decentralized movement for people to spin up their.
01:30:57.424 - 01:31:00.446, Speaker B: Licenses, license out the brand, tried and true model.
01:31:00.520 - 01:31:04.014, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. We're just gonna be another Chick fil A.
01:31:04.794 - 01:31:08.618, Speaker D: That's not bad, actually. It's harder to get a Chick fil a franchise and get into Harvard.
01:31:08.666 - 01:31:13.494, Speaker B: So, yeah, Santi's like, I could go spend a store, but I'm going to the Harry Potter store.
01:31:14.074 - 01:31:17.410, Speaker D: I thought you were gonna say Chick fil A, but yeah, if you spend.
01:31:17.442 - 01:31:20.666, Speaker B: $1,000 at Chick fil A, my friend, we have a lot more issues to talk about.
01:31:20.810 - 01:31:50.994, Speaker D: Hey, well, it's not all for me, but, gents, this has been a good discussion. Really exciting. The phone. Maybe we'll have to have you guys this time next year or before that to just track the progress. What is the. I mean, parting thoughts? And then also, where's like the best way for anyone that wants to learn about Solana? Who's the best point of contact and what is the best kind of opportunities to get involved, maybe with your team, with other projects sectors just open ended? Question for you guys.
01:31:52.434 - 01:32:09.210, Speaker C: So we are imminently, we do one of these like quarterly, but we're imminently launching a virtual Solana hackathon. There will be a fresh set of new prizes and new objectives to tackle. So if anyone from a developer focused side wants to participate, keep a lookout on the main Solana Twitter for announcements around that.
01:32:09.242 - 01:32:18.870, Speaker D: I'm going to interrupt you, but can you tell us the number of hackathon entrance participants over the last like twelve months? Cause I think that's a pretty impressive stat.
01:32:18.902 - 01:32:25.310, Speaker C: When I saw it, it's north of about 20 to 25,000 total participants.
01:32:25.422 - 01:32:27.294, Speaker D: And then over like the last year.
01:32:27.334 - 01:32:30.634, Speaker C: Or over the last year, we ran one quarterly.
01:32:31.734 - 01:32:40.350, Speaker A: The last one had like 15,000 registrations and over a thousand or 700 teams. Or a thousand teams.
01:32:40.382 - 01:32:44.874, Speaker C: I forgot it was somewhere in the ballpark of 700 to 1000 submitted projects.
01:32:45.904 - 01:33:06.164, Speaker A: And a bunch of them got funding. This is kind of like if you're an entrepreneur that's thinking, this is going to be my web3 idea that gets funding. This is a really, really easy way for you to get in front of all the top vc's and get your product to the mvp stage.
01:33:07.144 - 01:33:35.344, Speaker C: Also, if you go to Solana.com events, you'll see the full schedule for the in person hacker House throughout the year for the upcoming year. Those are great places globally, around the world to come meet other people from the Solana ecosystem, investors, Solana team members, if you want to interface with them. But otherwise, other than that, the best place to get information about Solana is the Solana main Twitter account, Solana podcast. Follow Anatoly and get some big brain networking news.
01:33:36.764 - 01:33:43.014, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go. Well, thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Anatoly, appreciate it. It's great to have you back. And Ben, yeah, great to have you in the show.
