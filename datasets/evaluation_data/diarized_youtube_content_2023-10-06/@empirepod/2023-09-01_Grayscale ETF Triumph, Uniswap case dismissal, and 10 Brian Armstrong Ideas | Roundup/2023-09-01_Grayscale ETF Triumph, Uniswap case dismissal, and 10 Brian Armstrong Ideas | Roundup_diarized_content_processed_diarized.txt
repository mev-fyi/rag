00:00:02.840 - 00:00:03.376, Speaker A: All right, we're back.
00:00:03.414 - 00:00:07.354, Speaker B: We got the roundup. We got the roundup. Santa, you're cycle city today, huh?
00:00:07.894 - 00:00:20.702, Speaker A: I am. I love cycling, so I'm doing some training in high altitude and living life. Man, when you see me smiling like this is for two reasons. One, obviously crypto. Two, cycling or running, just doing sports.
00:00:20.838 - 00:00:25.006, Speaker B: Yeah, I can tell you got that rider's high going right now, but it's.
00:00:25.030 - 00:00:40.224, Speaker A: A lot of, like, seen and legally blind. It's like, endorphins make you happy. Like, I'm the kind of person that if I'm not doing exercise on the daily, I mean, I do rest once a week, but it's, you know, I go crazy, but I don't do it.
00:00:40.304 - 00:00:40.640, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:40.712 - 00:00:41.600, Speaker A: So much outward.
00:00:41.712 - 00:00:45.804, Speaker B: How many, how many miles are you cycling? Or kilometers, I should say, for you Europeans.
00:00:46.264 - 00:00:55.680, Speaker A: Today I cycle 130k. I'm in the dole night. So did a lot of climbing. Yesterday I did 105k.
00:00:55.792 - 00:00:59.992, Speaker B: So 130. That's, uh, what, 70 miles, 80 miles?
00:01:00.088 - 00:01:20.832, Speaker A: That's like 75 miles, give or take. So 70, between 60, 70, 80 miles each day. Now, not every day is, like, really long, but when I'm here, I'm not here for many days, but just the. The amount of cycling, and it's like the most beautiful mountain range in the world. And I've been to, like, I've been to the Himalayas. I've been to all mountain ranges everywhere, really. South America, North America, every continent.
00:01:20.832 - 00:01:29.194, Speaker A: I visited and climbed mountains. I think the dolomites are the most underrated, even more beautiful than the Alps. Just incredible scenery.
00:01:29.734 - 00:01:31.334, Speaker B: That's gorgeous, man.
00:01:31.494 - 00:01:37.114, Speaker A: If anyone ever gets a chance to come up here, you know, easy access, and it is unreal.
00:01:37.774 - 00:01:43.434, Speaker B: Love it. Well, you've been paying attention to a little big week for bitcoin, huh?
00:01:44.494 - 00:02:15.494, Speaker A: Very big week. I mean, there's a lot to cover in this episode. Of course, the ETF, um, approval seems closer and closer, particularly given the ruling with grayscale. We'll talk about that. Um, related on the regulatory side, I mean, crypto just keeps winning. There's a second big, um, you know, the, the uniswap paradigm kind of dismissal, class action where they're trying to be pinned on, on trading these, like, quote, unquote, you know, shit coins. But the court dismissed that, so that's a bit win.
00:02:15.494 - 00:02:42.776, Speaker A: We'll talk about that as well. We won't delve too much into that because we're having a regulatory bot next week. So we'll save a lot of meat for more credentialized and competent people to comment on this stuff, but we'll touch upon it. And then, of course, related to going base. I mean, you were the one that brought this to my attention. There's a great. Brian Armstrong has been more vocal these days, and I think he put out kind of a request of, hey, things I want to be seen built.
00:02:42.776 - 00:02:47.728, Speaker A: And so we'll comment a lot on that. I think that'll be the substance of the episode. Does that sound good to you?
00:02:47.776 - 00:03:06.804, Speaker B: Yeah, that's great. Yeah. Let's talk about grayscale first. So let me, let me just tee this up maybe a little bit. So actually, the first. So this, what is it? Yesterday, on Wednesday, the grayscale won a big thing. Won a big thing in the courts against the SEC related to their, to their ETP or ETF.
00:03:06.804 - 00:03:58.414, Speaker B: And the, I think just before getting into what that ruling means and what actually happened, just to tee this up a little bit, since I've been in crypto, people have been basically applying for bitcoin ETF's. And I think the first one was the Winklevoss twins, actually back in 20. Remember when that was? 2013 or 2014? I want to say I think it was ten years early. Yeah, I think about ten years ago. It's been more than ten years since the Winklevoss twins applied for the first bitcoin ETF. And since then, there have been a number of firms, you know, Ark, Vaneck, Bitwise, grayscale many, many times. And then the most recent one was, I think, when we started to realize that, like, this actually could go, move forward and there actually could be a Blackrock ETF or bitcoin ETF is when the June Blackrock ETF filing.
00:03:58.414 - 00:04:17.174, Speaker B: Right. Because June Blackrock has filed for 500 and 5600 ETF's. And I think they've only lost one of those. So that was the signal to the market. And we talked about this back in the June roundup that that was kind of the signal that they, they knew something was coming, right. They knew something was going to happen. So what happened in this grayscale case is that.
00:04:17.174 - 00:04:43.744, Speaker B: Let me just kind of tee this up. There are two folks with great threads, as always, Jake Trevinsky, who's going to join us next week, and then Marissa from Blockchain association. So I'm just going to read some of Marissa's thread and quote from this. So to set the stage, Grayscale is not the first, like we just talked about, to seek approval of a spot bitcoin ETP. Several others have. The SEC has denied all of them. But importantly, and this will become important later, they have approved two bitcoin futures.
00:04:43.744 - 00:05:35.078, Speaker B: Evidence demonstrates that there is a 99.9% correlation between spot and futures market prices. So for this denial, uh, of a bitcoin ETF to be proper, right, because they've approved the futures, but they haven't approved the spot, the SEC must have a reasonable and coherent explanation for the inconsistent results for why they're approving bitcoin futures, but, uh, etps, but not bitcoin spot. Um, otherwise, they acted arbitrarily, right, and. And opinionated, which, this is not supposed to be an opinion, supposed to go off the law. And so, in denying these proposals, the SEC found the products were, quote, not designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. So what does that actually mean? What it means is that they're saying that the size of the market was insufficient to prevent fraud.
00:05:35.078 - 00:06:13.354, Speaker B: So they're saying the market is not big enough to prevent fraud in the market. So to remedy this, the SEC required a surveillance sharing agreement with a related and regulated market of significant size. And according to the SEC, every spot bitcoin ETP proposal so far has failed to satisfy this significant market test. So that is kind of what the court was looking for. The court was looking for whether the SEC coherently and reasonably explained why it treated spot and futures ETP approvals differently. That is what they lost. They found that, I think there were two kind of attack vectors in the courts here.
00:06:13.354 - 00:06:48.322, Speaker B: If I was, if I'm the grayscale lawyers, I think the two attack vectors they were going after were one. The SEC never explained why grayscale owning bitcoin, rather than bitcoin futures, impacted CME's ability to detect fraud. It claimed there was a difference, but the SEC kind of failed to back that up. They claimed it, and then when challenged, they couldn't back that up. And then grayscale provided evidence that fraud in the spot market would present identical problems in the spot in the futures ETP. Right? So if there's fraud in one market because there's this 99.9% correlation, there's gonna be fraud in both markets.
00:06:48.322 - 00:07:11.126, Speaker B: And the SEC, basically. Again, they didn't really dispute that. They basically just said that the correlation analysis had insufficient evidence without explaining it, though, and that's not enough for the court. So the court agreed with Grayscale here. They said the SEC's unexplained discounting of the relationship between the two markets. So the spot in the futures markets fall short of the standard for reasoned decision making. So that was the first attack vector.
00:07:11.126 - 00:08:10.838, Speaker B: Second attack vector, the SEC failed to explain how the proposed ETP would be the predominant influence on the price of bitcoin futures traded on the CME. So the SEC's attempt to kind of connect the value of Grayscale's assets to impacting the price on CME was unreasonable. And again, the court found that despite Grayscale's demonstration to the contrary, if the SEC thought grayscale would be the predominant influence on the CME's market, the SEC kind of failed to sufficiently explain that conclusion. So, bottom line, I know it's kind of a long tangent here. The SEC, the court found that the SEC failed to treat like cases, the two cases alike. It concluded that CME was a large futures market as it approved the futures ETP, but then failed to explain why the reasoning does not apply to grayscale. And in the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlikely regulatory, unlike regulatory treatment of like products, is unlawful.
00:08:10.838 - 00:08:18.622, Speaker B: So, boom, grayscale wins. Would love to hear your. I mean, we've been at this for a decade. Would love to hear just like. Yeah. What you kind of felt in this moment here.
00:08:18.798 - 00:08:29.310, Speaker A: Well, I actually want to ask you first, which is, and I'm cheating here, where, where can the path for an ETF approval be further derailed?
00:08:29.502 - 00:08:29.926, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:29.990 - 00:09:04.004, Speaker A: Because I think a lot of people would have looked at this and said, clear one way, it's imminent. The crypto prices, of course, reacted very positively on this news, and then it dipped some. But certainly bitcoin was up, I think, up to 7% almost immediately, like in a few hours. And then other assets kind of rallied accordingly. But bitcoin was leading the chart. So, question for you is, what else at this point can be a roadblock for the approval of an ETF?
00:09:04.494 - 00:09:41.488, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. So, moving forward here, the ball is in the SEC's court, right? And a lot of it depends on whether or not Gary, Gary Gensler wants to fight or fold. So the decision whether to appeal, this is my non legal brain here working. This is just my understanding, the decision of whether to appeal or not to appeal, they have 45 days to make that decision, if they appeal. So if Gary says, look, I don't agree with the courts here, I'm going to appeal, uh, the order will be stayed until a decision is made on that appeal. However, in that time, there are several other bitcoin ETF's that they have to make, uh, that, that are going to be filed. Right.
00:09:41.488 - 00:10:16.800, Speaker B: Ark and Bitwise and Blackrock and folks like that, and actually, I think Ark is the first one that's going to come, come due. So Ark filed back in. I think it was May, maybe April or May. You have 240 days, if you're the SEC, to make a call on that. So what is 240 days after that? I think that's like January, right? I think they have a deadline of January 2024. So that's one thing they could appeal, they could fight this. The other thing is that they could actually not fight this, but come up with new rationale, new rationale to get grayscale to, which would then cause Grayscale to sue them again.
00:10:16.800 - 00:10:38.766, Speaker B: And we go down this path so they can't use the argument of, hey, this is not a market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation. Can't use that. But they could try to find something new and then we'd go down this path again. Grayscale would fight them again. Now there's a third. There's a third thing, which is I think they could take it, actually probably resend the futures ETP. But I don't.
00:10:38.766 - 00:10:41.834, Speaker B: But I don't see them doing that. Yeah.
00:10:42.854 - 00:11:17.288, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it will certainly be interesting. And so basically what you're saying, because a lot of commentators said, hey, you know, we could have an ETF relatively soon. There's one comment said that. There's another one said, like you were saying just now, which is most likely Q four, Q one. But, you know, the market is a discounted mechanism and they all sort of assume it's an ETF and we'll get approved within the next weeks to six months, if you will. But, yeah, it does sound like it's, you know, the Sec can draw this out.
00:11:17.288 - 00:11:43.304, Speaker A: You know, they certainly have done that in the ripple case. Right. They. They've said that they're going to appeal it, I believe. And so, yeah, that would be interesting to see. The thing that I also looked at was, and we've talked about in this pod, was that the discount of grayscale products compressed pretty dramatically. This is GBTC in particular, which is the bitcoin trust.
00:11:43.304 - 00:12:14.900, Speaker A: The discount at one point reached. This is like peak three arrows bankruptcy and blow up because they were involved heavily in that carry trade. I mean, the discount on this went all the way to like 50% or so, 47%, and now it's traded. You know, I think there's still a discount. Discounts like 17% or so, 15%. So I'm looking at that and that's. That's fairly interesting that that is compressed, but it's still not a pair.
00:12:14.900 - 00:12:30.402, Speaker A: You know, you could argue that these closed end kind of mutual funds don't ever trade at par. But there's still a very big. If you're like a ARB hedge fund out there, I'm sure you're looking at this, and there's still a fair amount of room here between 17 15%.
00:12:30.458 - 00:12:35.954, Speaker B: I think people just have. I think people have PTSD. I think people have just gotten crushed on that trade for so many years.
00:12:35.994 - 00:12:37.698, Speaker A: That, uh, it's the widow trade.
00:12:37.826 - 00:12:38.402, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:12:38.498 - 00:12:39.418, Speaker A: Mostly called.
00:12:39.546 - 00:12:39.874, Speaker B: There's.
00:12:39.914 - 00:12:57.342, Speaker A: There's two very famous trades in crypt one, the kimchi trade, which is like, you know, the discount in Korea, and then this widow trade, which has claimed the lives of many. Yeah. Okay, and so where are you standing here? Are you optimistic in the range of outcomes? How do you think this shakes out?
00:12:57.518 - 00:13:11.532, Speaker B: Cautiously optimistic, I would say. I think they're for the first. So if Blackrock had not filed, I think Blackrock, people can't sleep on that. And you know that filing back in June is super important. I think if Blackrock wasn't here, Gary. Gary goes to the mats and he. And he fights this.
00:13:11.532 - 00:13:34.824, Speaker B: I think now, though, there is political pressure on the SEC to approve this spot. Bitcoin ETF. And this is no longer just about grayscale. It is about all of tradfi. And I think this was Jake Trevinsky who put this really well. All of tradfi is now ready for a bitcoin ETF. And if you actually look at Blackrock, like Blackrock being in the game now, they don't file and not get this thing passed through.
00:13:34.824 - 00:14:13.884, Speaker B: And if you think about Larry Fink, right, who runs BlackRock, his influence on DC, right? Think about it. He was considered for treasury secretary in 2016. I mean, I feel like half the testimonies of, like, finance CEO's are fink, right, testifying about COVID-19 relief, about financial regulation, about economic issues. I mean, the Fed literally hired Blackrock in 2020 to purchase billions of bonds and securities to stabilize the markets during the pandemic. They literally called on Blackrock to do that. And he serves on the New York Federal Reserve Board. And I've seen, like, you've seen him be able to pressure.
00:14:13.884 - 00:14:36.726, Speaker B: He pressured, like, he's pressured the biggest companies in the world. And I think he's pressured some of the biggest geopolitical leaders in the world as well, whether that's on ESG stuff or lobbying efforts or, you know, when he. I remember last year, he pressured ExxonMobil invest more in clean energy through all the shareholder votes that they have. So I think you can underestimate that.
00:14:36.830 - 00:15:23.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm in your camp, too. I mean, I think the decision for ETF does not compute in my investment process, although I think it is very important for the legitimacy of the industry. And I think we've already in some capacity, one, as you said, because, because BlackRock is in the game. And I think that alone, to me, is more, perhaps even more important than the approval or not. I think the approval will come at some point. I'm not playing the game of timing. I just think that this asset class moments like those, where you see a participant like Blackrock come in, the game is a win already for the industry.
00:15:23.190 - 00:15:41.134, Speaker A: And so I'm not waiting for or playing whether, or speculating whether it's going to happen in a week or six months time or a year. I certainly think, like you, that it can be a more drawn out process. And so I kind of, in a range of probabilities. I think that that might be the case.
00:15:42.994 - 00:16:29.610, Speaker B: Here's why. Here's why it might be actually even fast here would be like, if I was being, so I said cautiously optimistic, if I was being really optimistic. So when people talk about the 240 day approval for ETF's, it's actually not a 240 day approval. It's a 240 day process that's split into four stages. So there's a 45 day initial review window, which then they can approve or not approve. Usually what happens, though, is they extend it to a second 45 day initial review window, which can then be extended again to a 90 day period, which is called the order instituting proceedings, which can then be extended to a final 60 day period, after which the SEC must publish its decision. So if I'm being as optimistic as humanly possible, I mean, you can approve these things quicker than 240 days.
00:16:29.610 - 00:16:43.042, Speaker B: You don't have to wait for that. So, and I just pulled up, there's a. So I mentioned Ark. There's Ark, bitwise, the invest go galaxy, bitcoin trust, ishares, bitcoin trust. Vanek. Bitcoin trust. Wisdom tree, bitcoin trust.
00:16:43.042 - 00:17:00.494, Speaker B: The wise origin, bitcoin trust, which is fidelity, and the Valkyrie bitcoin fund. So those are all set to. If you extend the 240 day window out, those are all. Ark is January 2024. The rest of them are March 2024. So look, by the end of Q one, we could have.
00:17:02.754 - 00:17:03.514, Speaker A: What is it.
00:17:03.594 - 00:17:06.146, Speaker B: Eight to nine bitcoin ETF's in the market.
00:17:06.210 - 00:17:12.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, importantly, Europe already has these is my understanding. Canada has one or two of these, I believe.
00:17:13.093 - 00:17:15.469, Speaker B: Yeah, but who cares about Canada? No, no.
00:17:15.581 - 00:17:18.845, Speaker A: What I'm trying to say is these already exist outside.
00:17:18.989 - 00:17:19.341, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:19.397 - 00:17:20.989, Speaker A: And I think there's one that covers.
00:17:21.101 - 00:17:23.713, Speaker B: Jacobi asset management in Holland.
00:17:24.773 - 00:18:08.814, Speaker A: That's right. And so that, my point is there has been historic, like, if you study history, like the gold, and I've said it before, the gold ETF approval, there was a time where the US resisted that, and then it got approved in Europe, and then it came to the US. And so I think, again, we're following the same pattern here. History is rhyming. I guess a listener might be wondering, what's the point of all that? Why are we talking about the ETF and beyond? And I think this is a good segue into the second piece of regulatory action, the uniswap thing, which is you always got to wonder. There has been, I think at this point, more harm done by not approving an ETF than there has been, presumably, any claim that you can think of what the harm would be of having a crypto ETF. And I'll tell you why.
00:18:08.814 - 00:19:30.184, Speaker A: Grayscale, again, this idea of a discount, I mean, that's a huge amount of losses for people, right? Whether it's on paper or not, but it is trapped liquidity. And this discount has been very impactful for people that have invested, whereas an ETF wouldn't have that issue. And so I think that's the thing that if I'm some of the more vocal members of Congress here that have continued to say along these cases, I think the common denominator has been it is up to Congress to come up with rules, because regulatory by enforcement and the lack of clarity has been very cost prohibitively costly for crypto startups. It is stifled innovation, but more importantly, it has harmed the consumer. You could argue, what's the harm of an airdrop? There's so many. Financial inclusion has been impacted on a number of dimensions, and particularly the amount of, like you could argue, the coinbase stock being hit pretty hard after the SEC sued them. But more so just the discount itself in these grayscale products is, I think that one of the things that, if I'm a member of Congress, I'd be pointing to that and say it is fundamentally important that we have an ETF, because otherwise you have these things that are harming the consumer and everything in financial regulation.
00:19:30.184 - 00:19:55.536, Speaker A: And you tell me if you think otherwise should be centered on creating fair and efficient markets, primarily fair and like, including like financial inclusion. And I think at this point, I mean, the evidence is just so clear that by not having an ETF, there is a lot of harm being done. So that's the thing that I think is a good segue into the second piece of regulatory action that we highlighted. Unless you want to talk about.
00:19:55.640 - 00:19:57.136, Speaker B: I actually have one more thing. I mean.
00:19:57.200 - 00:19:57.872, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:19:57.968 - 00:20:23.502, Speaker B: Well, this is something that we talked about. All right, so ETF's, let's think about what this could do to the market. Right. And you can, I think you brought up gold in Europe and then the US. And I think that's an apt comparison. And, you know, if you, you and I, like you, we are not impacted by an ETF necessarily, because we can buy bitcoin, you know, in self custody, it, or keep it on coinbase or something like that. But if you're a large institution, there are like five reasons an ETF really impacts you.
00:20:23.502 - 00:20:39.158, Speaker B: Right. You, maybe four main ones, like enhanced liquidity. A lot of institutions, let's say you're trying to deploy $2 billion into, into bitcoin. It's very tough to do that. You have to, like, get an OTC. You have to get like a crypto native OTC desk and implement it like that. The ETF is going to bring enhanced liquidity.
00:20:39.158 - 00:21:23.774, Speaker B: It's going to reduce the need for physical holdings. So even though you and I are comfortable holding bitcoin and self custody in the same way that people didn't want to hold gold physically, people don't want to hold bitcoin. They don't want to deal with that. And so I think it reduces the need for the physical holdings. It does increase price transparency and price discovery, which institutions want, and then the potential for manipulation in a market. This just increases the size of the market and brings more regulatory scrutiny to the bitcoin markets, which then, I think draws more institutions in as they are less scared to allocate to that. So my question on the back of all of that is, I remember one point we were talking, you had very little, maybe no bitcoin exposure.
00:21:23.774 - 00:21:40.834, Speaker B: I think a couple of months ago you started actually, and again, not financial advice. We don't have. Not financial advice, all that stuff. I think you started buying bitcoin again for the first time earlier this year. What is your current thinking around your personal exposure to bitcoin, especially relative to Ethereum?
00:21:41.814 - 00:22:14.904, Speaker A: I haven't changed the allocation since back then. I do have some exposure. Obviously, it is meaningfully less than other crypto assets. I mean, my strategy is primarily in the private market, is investing in early stage startups, but I do have core holdings, liquid holdings. I do think that. So I haven't like changed, I haven't added to the position, but I do think that, I mean, it's an interesting, it's an interesting setup. And I want to go back to the kind of things that you listed out just now.
00:22:14.904 - 00:23:25.586, Speaker A: When you think about what this does. We had another podcast that was coming up where we were talking about the impact that it will have on large crypto funds that basically track the index and have your billion plus fund. A lot of that is held in a lot of the majors in order to deploy that size. Historically, the investors have allocated to the industry by investing in venture funds, hedge funds and grayscale products. Having an ETF has, I think an impact, you could argue on large scale funds, also has an impact on grayscale, but doesnt convert to an ETF because the fees are very high. I mean its charging like a 1% fee or so, whereas an ETF charges basis points, I mean like an order magnitude less. And so, you know, into the idea of price discovery and liquidity, like if there's any inefficiency in how the ETF is traded, you can, there is going to be plenty of people arbing the physical versus the ETF, like, like that.
00:23:25.586 - 00:24:24.194, Speaker A: That's going to happen. And so it just creates tighter, tighter markets. If you're. This is not tax advice, but I think the, a lot of folks in invest, even crypto natives historically have allocated to grayscale products through like a tax advantaged account, like a Roth IRA or an RIA, which is when you think about the ETF, I mean, that also becomes a possibility here, which is, you know, it's, it's fairly advantageous. Now you should go talk to your lawyer, you know, your accountant and whatnot. But having an ETF is very kind of, you know, just more possibilities of getting access and exposure to particularly bitcoin in this case, and have some sort of have a number of strategies at your ability options market. You could borrow against that, you could do it in a cost effective manner.
00:24:24.194 - 00:24:48.394, Speaker A: And so I think one of the things that is going to be interesting is how Coinbase micro strategy, just huge number of bitcoin holdings, like how all these different things that have been proxies for getting access to crypto change as a result of just a pure ETF approval and access.
00:24:49.734 - 00:25:01.794, Speaker B: Do you think they are helped because it expands the market or do you think they get hurt because Coinbase is acting as a proxy for someone who wants to go long bitcoin but doesn't really want to maybe buy the underlying.
00:25:02.824 - 00:25:44.396, Speaker A: It's an interesting question. I mean the other one I didn't mention was miners. And I think miners probably get hit the hardest because mining has just been a terrible business. Like you, you can, you would rather own just I mean I in my opinion every miner that I've looked at for a long time, I just never get my arms around why it would outperform the underlying. And I think similar dynamic happens in the oil and gas market, like exploration and drilling and exploration is very tough business. You'd rather own like oil, I guess, or uranium exploration. You know what I mean? Like it's the mining aspect of it.
00:25:44.396 - 00:27:01.046, Speaker A: Miners I think have a struggle challenge business and so maybe a lot of the capital flow that has invested in those transitions to just the ETF to track the underlying performance here of bitcoin versus an operator in the system. Microstrategy is a bit different. If you want have some sort of inclination to and believe that and give any credit to their data business and I think they mentioned that they want to make a big play and blockchains are data rich and they historically pivoted from and the world like microstrategy over the years, like even the nineties like has been very much like a data business and like creating and servicing insights and processing like unstructured data and whatnot. And it wouldn't be in a mobile and it reinvented its business and like, but now it's saying the same for crypto and like it's going to like come up with a product that, you know is processing all this crypto like all this blockchain data and like surface insights. So if you give any credit for that, I guess. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean it's also leverage, right? I mean they have like huge mass borrowings to purchase these bitcoins.
00:27:01.046 - 00:27:36.694, Speaker A: So I don't know. I mean the. Maybe a question for you as you are in the US, like where would you, would you in the realm of possibilities, by the way, they're not mutually exclusive. If you had $100 to invest from scratch and you could, and the options are going buying bitcoin and storing it yourself and wallet buying the ETF or some of these other options, Coinbase, microstrategy miners, GBTC, like how would you allocate that hundred dollars?
00:27:37.194 - 00:27:57.448, Speaker B: For me personally, I'm just buying, I'm buying, I'm buying bitcoin and Coinbase probably like those are my two. I'm buying bitcoin and Coinbase because I think something like GBTC, I don't. I'm not, I'm not a trader. I don't want to. When I think about, like, the Arb, that is a trade, like that is someone thinking about the trading strategy there? And I don't. I don't have the mental bandwidth. I don't want to be a trader.
00:27:57.448 - 00:28:19.412, Speaker B: It, like, I want to buy something and forget about it for ten years and I want to. Just like, I. That is how I invest. I don't. I probably leave money on the table, but I don't like the mental bandwidth of trying to think through different trades. I like just, I like having 99% of my mental bandwidth go towards building blockworks. So the little bit of mental bandwidth I spend on investing, I like buying things that I want to hold for ten years.
00:28:19.412 - 00:28:22.104, Speaker B: And right now that is bitcoin and Coinbase.
00:28:22.724 - 00:28:23.316, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:23.420 - 00:28:24.372, Speaker B: And the thing I'm thinking, you want.
00:28:24.388 - 00:28:25.504, Speaker A: To buy the ETF.
00:28:27.004 - 00:28:38.524, Speaker B: Well, I mean, why buy the ETF when you could buy the underlying. Well, actually, I mean, that's a. I'm curious how GLD is done for its gold. Yeah. You could buy new roth.
00:28:38.824 - 00:28:46.564, Speaker A: I mean, like, that's what I'm saying. You're in the US, and so I think you can't do that with physical bitcoin, can you?
00:28:47.264 - 00:28:51.204, Speaker B: No, but you can't put that much in a Roth Ira anyways. I think it's.
00:28:51.624 - 00:28:53.624, Speaker A: I'm saying that. But you can.
00:28:53.784 - 00:29:01.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess if you. Yeah, I guess you would max out your allocation there and then. That's a good question.
00:29:01.704 - 00:29:02.804, Speaker A: Definitely not miners.
00:29:04.004 - 00:29:05.304, Speaker B: I'm not buying miners.
00:29:06.084 - 00:29:06.756, Speaker A: No.
00:29:06.900 - 00:29:32.044, Speaker B: Yeah. But it's interesting because I think the most dangerous thing in crypto, from an allocating perspective is thinking that this time will be different. And if you look at all the last cycles, bitcoin leads. Bitcoin leads, that capital flows into ETH, that excess capital and ETH flows into in 2017 as icos. In 2020, it was defi. Uh, 2021, it was nfts. Um.
00:29:32.044 - 00:29:54.340, Speaker B: And, uh. And then, and then that keeps pushing out on the risk spectrum until. Until the. Until the cycles is over. And if you look at what's going to happen next year, right, bitcoin spot, ETF's bitcoin having a presidential election, right. That could very well lead into, like, if the. The number one way is for the way for the Dems to stay in power, you turn the money printer back on.
00:29:54.340 - 00:30:07.224, Speaker B: Um, I know they don't have direct control over that, obviously, but you know, it seems like those kind of different parties of the US political system are kind of converging. It does feel like sometimes. So, I mean, like, I don't know, tough to be bearish bitcoin right now.
00:30:07.804 - 00:30:12.500, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I'm certainly not bearish bitcoin. I think there's a lot of positive developments.
00:30:12.612 - 00:30:13.304, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:13.604 - 00:31:11.546, Speaker A: One of the things that, you know, just as an aside, you know, it's, we had muneed from stacks here on the pond and talking about ordinals and whatnot. I mean, I saw a note out there that, or no, activities just got, like, cratered and so a lot of hype just has gone away. I don't know. I think it would be interesting to have someone in the pod just follow up on that point that I know. What's his name? Uri has been very vocal around the lack of, like, the lack of innovation amongst core bitcoin developers. And, like, historically, there's been a resistance to kind of out innovate and just being critical of other experiments like ethereum and then everything else. Ordinals felt like it was sort of a sea change in terms of maybe an inflection point of saying, okay, well, let's.
00:31:11.546 - 00:31:39.004, Speaker A: Let's capitalize on this. Let's innovate. Let's create kind of L2 smart contracts, you know, whatever it is, to create a defi thriving ecosystem in bitcoin. I mean, it is, probably will be in the foreseeable future, just the largest, the largest coin, I mean, the largest digital asset. And so there's a lot there that you can do. And so, anyways, I'd just be really curious to keep track on. I haven't.
00:31:39.004 - 00:31:42.988, Speaker A: I just saw that Renault's like, just like, went to zero again.
00:31:43.076 - 00:32:13.702, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that, that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best defi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers.
00:32:13.702 - 00:32:41.922, Speaker B: A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there. You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech rollups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off.
00:32:41.922 - 00:33:02.486, Speaker B: If you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30 when buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time.
00:33:02.486 - 00:33:41.104, Speaker B: And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up, let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there. Let's talk about one more win in the courts, which was Uniswap, and then we can move on to the coin. Brian's kind of like ten things that he would invest in. So if you remember back in there was this original complaint last year that alleged that Uniswap. I think it was Uniswap and their founder, Hayden Adams and Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm were responsible for rampant fraud on Uniswap, and they pushed Uniswap to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
00:33:41.104 - 00:34:27.704, Speaker B: Plaintiffs also alleged that Uniswap offered and sold unregistered securities. It would have been really bad if they won this. The court just concluded that. I think they basically just lost. The Uniswap just won this, basically. And I think the court said that even though they see merits in the defendant's counterpoint, uh, that this case is more like an effort to hold a developer of a self driving car liable for a third party's use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank, which is basically saying that, uh, the uniswap protocol is primarily lawful, has primarily lawful use, and that protocol devs are not liable when others misuse it. Um, which is actually really interesting.
00:34:27.704 - 00:34:35.453, Speaker B: As you know, we were talking about this last week or the week before with, uh, who's the guy who just went to jail? Roman, right?
00:34:36.233 - 00:34:37.489, Speaker A: Yeah. The tornado.
00:34:37.601 - 00:34:57.636, Speaker B: Yeah, with tornado. So I think the trend in the courts is kind of turning here, and it's really positive for hopefully this ends up applying to tornado. And, yeah, I think it's been like a fear that there'd be, like a bad legal interpretation of what protocols really are. And it's. I don't know, it's motivating for builders to see this, to see them get this one, right?
00:34:57.660 - 00:34:58.384, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:34:59.084 - 00:34:59.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:59.452 - 00:36:05.244, Speaker A: You know, we said time again, you have to believe that the courts will fairly interpret the law and the intent of, you know, the law. And so peel back a lot of the kind of the bullying that has happened and overreach arguably. So it's fairly positive. As an aside, there was a NFT project that was slapped by like promising deems of security and this is, forget the name of the project. But, you know, I think that there's one, I mean, I think a few of the NFT groups I'm on were a bit, you know, panicking over it. But if you look clearly at the complaint and like at the SEC document, I mean, it was a fair amount of very aggressive language from these promoters of NFTs and developers, if you will. So this is an important just point that I want to make, which is, yeah, we're seeing a lot of positive developments in the courts, but I think because we don't have clarity like, like rules in place.
00:36:05.244 - 00:36:38.896, Speaker A: One, if you're a, hopefully if you're a developer, you have some optimism here, but still consult with lawyer. And there's still like, I think at this point there's been precedent, particularly coming out of the ICO phase where there's like certain things that a lawyer would tell you very clearly, hey, this is not something you should be doing. These are kind of the, as we know it and based on precedent, these are kind of the things that the path that you could follow here reasonably and hope that you were on the right side.
00:36:39.000 - 00:36:39.240, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:39.272 - 00:37:30.964, Speaker A: As many of the projects, including uniswap. Right. So anyways, it's important to make the distinction that there is still fraud happening. There's still obviously a lot of nefarious activity out there, but through rulemaking, you kind of are more able to focus on going after people that are, you know, committing fraud and violating the law, but you don't have these laws in place. And so anyways, yeah, just want to make that point because, you know, for maybe a skeptic listening, say, oh, you crypto bulls, you know, you think that the game's over. Like, no, there's still a lot of fraud as there is in any industry, right, in any market. But I think your ability to enforce and to protect consumers increases dramatically when you actually have clear rules.
00:37:30.964 - 00:37:38.300, Speaker A: And so that's what we're trying, that's what we're excited here because we haven't had clarity in the last, since day one.
00:37:38.432 - 00:38:15.490, Speaker B: Yeah, lets talk about non regulation. So this week, a couple of days ago, Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of Coinbase shared the ten things that hes most excited about in crypto and adding a bit of context, saying, look, if I was running Coinbase, so I cant go build these things and Coinbase is big, but were not, weve got to stay focused. We cant go build all these separate things. So if I was starting over today and I wanted to go build and found something in crypto, here's what I would go build today. I'm going to read off the ten things that, uh, kind of his crypto wish list, things that he would go build. One, a flat coin, and we'll talk about all these in a sec. One, a flat coin.
00:38:15.490 - 00:38:31.800, Speaker B: So this coin that tracks the price of CPI. Two, on chain reputation system. Three, on chain ads. Uh, you weren't on this, but we just recorded an episode with Antonio of Spindle. Um, helped build Facebook's ad marketplace. Uh, really interesting. On chain ad conversation for on chain capital formation.
00:38:31.800 - 00:39:00.128, Speaker B: Five, a job or a task marketplace, kind of like a five or upwork or something like that. On chain six, privacy for l, two, seven p. Two p exchange fully on chain eight, more on chain games. Nine, tokenizing real world assets. Ten, tools for network states. I'm curious, when you read through this and you watch this kind of presentation, what were the kind of either end of the spectrum, the most exciting, no brainer. If it was the right founder, I'd back that in a heartbeat.
00:39:00.128 - 00:39:06.724, Speaker B: And then the flip side of like, ooh, yeah, I know it's Brian Armstrong, but like that, that one, I don't, I don't know about that one.
00:39:07.544 - 00:39:24.432, Speaker A: Tools for nation states is interesting, aggressive, though. Like, I read Balaji's nation states. Like, yeah, I get his point. I don't spend too much time on that, but that felt like a stretch. And so it reminds me of like Dow tooling solutions, which that's what I.
00:39:24.448 - 00:39:25.192, Speaker B: Thought of Dow tool.
00:39:25.248 - 00:39:55.850, Speaker A: I was like, I don't want to focus on that. It's just like the things that I get most excited about. And I spoke with Jesse from, from base and the Coinbase team about this is having on chain reputation is, I think it's the lowest hanging fruit I think we have at this point. Particularly if you deploy through base. Like, Coinbase has over 100 million users. Like, they have data on all of them and they've done their checks. They could very easily issue you an NFT.
00:39:55.850 - 00:40:34.224, Speaker A: It says you're a registered user. You know, you, you've passed Kyc AML, which you could argue is not efficient, whatever. But at least it's, it's that it's not a bot. It's not. And so it's a real human being. And so I think that's the, I mean, if I'm Coinbase, like they should just deploy it themselves. There's an interesting project backed by like, I think they invested in it with variant leading called oh, what's the name of it, like Sesame or something, which is basically like an NFT that attests to like real world ness and human liveliness, if you will.
00:40:34.224 - 00:41:26.054, Speaker A: But reputation score is hugely important. I think it's gonna happen sooner than later. I want to say privacy as a second, but as someone that has been around for a while, like privacy is that cult. Like, it's like zero knowledge proofs. It's, it's, it is a holy grail, right? He did say something in the, in the, in the video that I actually don't agree with. He said, um, privacy should be opt in, not like not opt out, meaning you should designate which things you want private and not. And I think there are, that just doesn't work because if everyone by default is not private, the people that are doing and electing to be private raises suspicion.
00:41:26.054 - 00:42:03.304, Speaker A: And this happened with shielding like Zcash for forever had this like op in not opt out. And very few transactions were actually shielded, meaning private. My understanding is if you had done that, you would have gotten a call from the government, almost like you would have gotten like inspected. And I know a few funds that did this and then that. I think then Z cash went through and did an upgrade of doing all transit. For context, Z cash is a privacy preserve. Like a privacy first coin, like layer one if you will.
00:42:03.304 - 00:43:20.812, Speaker A: But once they did an upgrade, every transaction was by default private. And I think that's what you need to have in order for, you know, the system to actually work. But on the scale of how, like being practical, like, how is that, that going to happen? I mean, I know there's been a lot of work in progress in zero knowledge proofs, but I think we're still a ways away from, from having, from having like true privacy on chain. So, so those two important I think are, would be huge. The implications going back to reputation can't be like understated because that would increase efficiency in Defi. That would allow for think of permission defi environments it where you're still settling on an l one, like Ethereum, right? And you still have that guarantee, but you know who your counterparty is. You can, you can go and talk to a lot of large financial institutions and they would most likely get more comfortable of interacting on chain.
00:43:20.812 - 00:44:29.234, Speaker A: The visas, the JP Morgan's of the world to use them like Ethereum and use an amm like uniswap, but an implementation or a lending money market like aave or compound where you know everyone, where everyone's a verified user and has some sort of reputation score that is credit score plus right now, mind you, that I think is where Defi is really going. That's what I'm really excited about. I just backed an l two that is very focused on this because I think this is the path forward to getting a lot of like the traditional system on chain. So those are the main two. The third one that I just want to touch on, and I want to hand it over to you, is marketing. And I've said it before, just today actually there was a company that was backed by kindred Ventures and there was lad Gill and a bunch of other folks like back that I think it raised 4.3 million to I think presumably like focus on this segment of the market which is as more and more non speculative pure use cases emerge.
00:44:29.234 - 00:45:28.754, Speaker A: Like Jesse from base was talking about having an open table on chain where on base where once, which I think is the point where as soon as you go to restaurants, you check in, you get an NFT and there's some sort of reward system in place and you can pay with a stable coin. So a lot of these things start going clicking that very easily lends itself to marketing and a whole ad network behind it. And referral programs, which I think some crypto native projects in DeFi have done this, like yearn for instance, has referral programs like a wallet, like argent. If argent funnels money to urine vault, there's the smart contract detects that. And so there's a commission paid out based on the fee. All of that is going to be a massive, massive industry. Particularly when you think about the challenges of cookies in web two, which have basically in some jurisdictions like Europe have like been heavily impacted.
00:45:28.754 - 00:46:23.868, Speaker A: Not only that, but it's like blockchains are transparent if you don't have privacy. And if you have, if you issue an NFT to someone, when they walk into your store, they go to your restaurant, they fly, whatever. And the NFT just commemorates that activity. Well, all of a sudden you have access to all that information in the wallet. And if you're a brand, like your ability to target and stitch together maybe web two data or web3 data is, is a huge advantage. And any marketer that is looking at this and appreciates that, I think just jumps out of his seat and says, wow, this is the, this is the next, this is what the next wave of marketing looks like. Right.
00:46:23.868 - 00:46:58.140, Speaker A: And I don't know, those were the things that I was mostly excited about. I think all of them made sense. But these three were, again, the reputation, privacy, and marketing like a, marketing, like a ad network, if you will. The marketing and reputation, practically speaking, can be deployed and I think can work like today. Reputation, like privacy is something that we've been working as an industry for a long time, and so it will come, I think it just kind of farther on the spectrum.
00:46:58.252 - 00:46:58.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:59.594 - 00:47:00.170, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:47:00.202 - 00:47:16.178, Speaker B: I agreed with you. I liked all these ideas. Honestly, I thought they were all pretty good. There were, I could, I've, like I wrote, I tried to force myself to write down one pushback for every single one. So I can go through those if it's interesting. But, but just to start with the ones that I liked, I. So on chain ads are a no brainer.
00:47:16.178 - 00:47:29.166, Speaker B: Basically. Web one, we had cpms. Web two, we moved to CPC, cost per click. Right? So initially, web one, you pay for the impressions. Web two you pay for, for the clicks. Right. Web three, and this is as someone who's.
00:47:29.166 - 00:47:48.686, Speaker B: A lot of our revenue comes from advertising. Um, it's nearly impossible to do this in the traditional kind of software stack that, that, you know, web two has right now and that we're built on top of is going from CPM to CPC all the way to CPA, which is you only pay someone when they buy something or take an action on.
00:47:48.710 - 00:47:51.314, Speaker A: Chain CPA just for listeners. Cost per action.
00:47:51.674 - 00:48:28.938, Speaker B: Cost per action, exactly. So we've gone from cost per milli, which is fancy way of saying 1000 to cost per click, which is like how Facebook and Instagram work, to, in crypto, you can go to CPA. And what's even cooler about that is it's not just paying out the person at the bottom of that stack. You pay out along the entire stack. So let me give you an example. Like, you know, so the advertiser of this episode, um, uh, yeah, like, let's say an advertiser for this episode. And uh, we, we drive you, you know, you hear the advertisement and uh, you're like, oh, that sounds really interesting.
00:48:28.938 - 00:48:57.700, Speaker B: You go to Google, right? You go to Google, you type in that, that advertiser's name, you then submit a form on their page. We, as blockworks, don't get credit for that. They have no idea that we sent you because they went to Google and clicked on that. But if a lot of that is happening on chain, um, not the podcast, obviously, podcasts aren't on chain right now. But like if that kind of action, like you go here, then you go here, then you go here. And that's all on chain. That is you could basically pay out all series of the, of the funnel there.
00:48:57.700 - 00:49:03.116, Speaker B: So I think that's pretty cool. I actually think the job task on.
00:49:03.140 - 00:49:11.366, Speaker A: This point, like it increases dramatically, increases transparency. Marketing, there's a famous saying, right, which is marketing works is just, no, no.
00:49:11.500 - 00:49:13.802, Speaker B: You just don't know it's working on you. Yeah, yeah.
00:49:13.858 - 00:49:23.202, Speaker A: Like this is glass half full or not. Like it's like in understanding the funnel behavior and user behavior is impossible. So brands of.
00:49:23.258 - 00:49:26.946, Speaker B: Oh, oh, you're talking about half my advertising spend is wasted the trouble.
00:49:27.010 - 00:49:30.074, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But you just know. I just don't know which one. Half.
00:49:30.154 - 00:49:30.506, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:30.570 - 00:49:32.186, Speaker A: And then the problem is that.
00:49:32.330 - 00:49:35.290, Speaker B: Yeah. John want to make her. Yeah, exactly.
00:49:35.322 - 00:49:37.722, Speaker A: So, like in the problem is even worse.
00:49:37.778 - 00:49:37.994, Speaker B: Right?
00:49:38.034 - 00:50:16.918, Speaker A: If you, if you go to Amazon, they don't share the data with you. A lot of that transparency of the funnel and how users find you and how they interact with your brand and I mean, and the conversion of that is in the checkout of that. Like everything in the funnel from discovery to checkout will be dramatically, like, see dramatic improvements because of crypto and not just paying through stable coins, but even farther up the funnel just to discovering the trackability of that. With tools like nfts, it just can be huge.
00:50:17.086 - 00:50:44.314, Speaker B: Yeah. So my bet on crypto has always been that the world's becoming more global and more digital. And crypto is the easiest bet on that. If you try to take out all the anti institution things and kind of the libertarian in me, if you're making a simple bet and you're explaining it to a simple person, the world's getting more global and more digital. This is a bet on that. And I think some of Brian's things really hit on that. Like the job task marketplace for crypto.
00:50:44.474 - 00:50:48.114, Speaker A: There are like a fiverr. But, you know.
00:50:48.194 - 00:50:48.426, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:48.450 - 00:50:53.134, Speaker A: The stable coins layered in and, and again, everything. But everything ties into reputation.
00:50:53.434 - 00:51:08.460, Speaker B: I mean, uh, yes, I do. Yeah, I do. That has to come later, though. That's not, uh. You need people doing things on chain first. Then you can build a reputation system. You can't build a reputation system.
00:51:08.460 - 00:51:09.732, Speaker B: If so, you have to pull people.
00:51:09.788 - 00:51:15.252, Speaker A: Well, well, you can port, you, you can pour web two data and through, like, of course, you, you'd have to.
00:51:15.308 - 00:51:36.054, Speaker B: I'm just bearish on things that rely on, that rely on, like that's why like real world assets is like, man, I hope it works. But like you're relying on a, on a non digital thing. Some I don't love. Like, hey, we need to build credit scores on chain. Like let's go pull in from credit karma. So it's Kickstarter network like that.
00:51:36.094 - 00:52:32.054, Speaker A: But I think there you kick started that way. And then, and then the percentage and weight in the, in the algorithm to predict credit worthiness or some other, some other measure of reputation, the percentage of on chain activity can be very quickly the dominant, the dominant weight in the model. But I wouldn't be dismissive of porting web two data into the mix. Now places like the US have a lot like have better systems and data feeds than other places. Just don't have it right. Where you have informal economy, like in India, well, it's challenged, yeah, but, but it's not impossible. I mean, when you say like there's a startup, for instance, it started lending out, started you know, creating a, like a micro pay, micro loans, like Allegram bank in Africa and they were using like smart smartphone activity.
00:52:32.054 - 00:52:49.710, Speaker A: If you're charging your phone, the type of apps that you have, if you're paying your mobile consumption and time, like those sort of things are arguably better predictors of credit worthiness than like experience, like your typical credit score. But anyways, an aside, the, just a.
00:52:49.742 - 00:53:07.724, Speaker B: Like last point on this one, the like job task marketplace. If I told you that there was a market that was growing 71% year over year, it's completely global. Um, and it's, uh, the buyer on the other side is not consumers. It's, it's businesses. Like, I think that's exciting to anyone. And that's, that's the freelance job market today. So like freelance Fiverr.
00:53:08.104 - 00:53:09.724, Speaker A: Like, what's wrong with Fiverr?
00:53:10.744 - 00:53:12.164, Speaker B: Have you ever used Fiverr?
00:53:12.584 - 00:53:15.648, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, I, I've tried fiverr.
00:53:15.696 - 00:53:21.298, Speaker B: Fiverr. Fiverr sucks. I actually use up, I use upwork sometimes. Um, sorry.
00:53:21.386 - 00:53:23.034, Speaker A: Yeah, upwork fiber, like pc.
00:53:23.074 - 00:53:49.618, Speaker B: I use upwork for like weird miscellaneous. I mean, I actually don't really use it anymore. I use it for now. Like Claude AI has taken that and I use that instead of upwork. But I don't know, the like freelance marketplace, the freelance just industry is growing and market is growing so, so, so fast. And most of these platforms are not that good. Whether that's like a crypto thing or web two thing, maybe it's just, it's really tough to build one of those marketplaces.
00:53:49.706 - 00:54:17.642, Speaker A: Let me ask you a question. Like if you're, if you're the upper management listening to this, what could you do? And maybe it's just accepting stable coins. Like what else, what else would you layer on in terms of crypto nativeness? That upwork is missing is what I'm trying to understand. I think the payments and Brian, yeah.
00:54:17.738 - 00:54:18.474, Speaker B: I see your point.
00:54:18.554 - 00:54:42.824, Speaker A: The payments is just huge, right. Because there's always a cut, the interchange fee, like the commission's, like the processing, the settlement, all of that back end is hugely inefficient. You could just use a stable coin, pay with USDC, USDT, whatever. You know, I think that's, that's something that, that should be done.
00:54:43.164 - 00:54:43.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:43.564 - 00:55:42.352, Speaker A: And then particularly for the talent that lives in places where just difficult to have a bank account or it's difficult to, you know, have a local banking network, like all that stuff just poof, like you don't need it. Reputation is important, the verification of that and the quality of the work. I mean, I think there's always, look, there's bots in crypto and so I think proving proof of humanity, proof of work are important concepts in crypto that we've had to deal with. I think the proof of work aspect is there for machines, but not so much necessarily for humans. Like daos have struggled a bit in like, grading the reputation of contributors. You can look at Gitcoin and say, okay, this is an interesting grants program. A lot of the same, a lot of the grants are doled out to the same recipients that, you know, over time have produced like quality work.
00:55:42.352 - 00:56:26.732, Speaker A: And so there's, there's some data there that is useful and interesting. You always have the issue when it comes to reputation around. Like there is this dynamic of when you read reviews, a lot of them are dissatisfied customers that take the, take the time and effort to actually write a review. So it's skewed on the negatives. And that's a problem with some sort of, when you look at reviews, a lot of the activity on Twitter too is negative, skewed negative. Like it's just very vocal minority that expresses dissatisfaction and anger and all those range of emotions, particularly in bear markets. But yeah, it's challenging.
00:56:26.732 - 00:56:58.570, Speaker A: Like, I think as we think about like non speculative use cases like, like these, I think I always wonder, like why hasn't it been possible in web two? Could you introduce certain things in a web two business model? Or do you have to totally reinvent it from scratch? And this is not just for job markets, it's really for everything. And I think it's an interesting exercise to go through. Like banks, you could argue they don't have to blow up.
00:56:58.722 - 00:56:59.010, Speaker B: Right.
00:56:59.042 - 00:57:25.694, Speaker A: They could just use on chain to do settlement, which is to do process, like to expand their market and reduce overhead from compliance and operations and streamline all of that. That's a huge material impact that I think their ability that then allows them to cover more market, extend more loans, do whatnot. But I think that the linchpin there is reputation.
00:57:27.394 - 00:57:47.750, Speaker B: Probably going to have the biggest impact. Probably. Honestly, the one out of all of these that would have the biggest impact is the flat coin. I just think it's worth of sorts, right? Like, you know, how many money has gone into this trying to do it and like, what? What? And I think the challenge here is so flat coin is one that tracks inflation accurately, right?
00:57:47.862 - 00:57:49.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Purchasing power inflation. Yeah.
00:57:50.374 - 00:57:54.110, Speaker B: I mean, first off, how do you get that economic data into how well.
00:57:54.142 - 00:57:59.740, Speaker A: The calculation of that morphed? It's like, how many times will they change the definition of CPI?
00:57:59.852 - 00:58:08.084, Speaker B: Yeah. CPI is a completely broken metric. So, like, are you tracking CPI? No, you can't track CPI because that doesn't accurately track, you know, the track.
00:58:08.124 - 00:58:13.356, Speaker A: The price of Costco, hot dog, soda combo or pizza.
00:58:13.420 - 00:58:14.172, Speaker B: Because that stays.
00:58:14.268 - 00:58:14.652, Speaker A: Combo.
00:58:14.708 - 00:58:16.964, Speaker B: That stays flat. Yeah.
00:58:17.044 - 00:58:20.524, Speaker A: $1. It's a dollar 50 now. It's not a dollar anymore.
00:58:20.644 - 00:58:41.374, Speaker B: Have you read the quote? Jim Senegal, the Costco co founder, you know what he once told the company's current CEO, Craig Jelinek, if you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out. And then another quote. I think a journalist asked him, when is. When is the price of the hot dog going to. Gonna increase in price past 150? He goes, when I'm dead, so.
00:58:42.834 - 00:58:54.014, Speaker A: Right. Well, okay, though, the Big Mac index. Yeah, no, I know what you're saying, but it's challenging. Obviously, there's ample fourth, which I looked at. I just never invested. It was just hard.
00:58:54.094 - 00:59:09.070, Speaker B: There's just been a lot of. Yeah, a lot of these. Right. You have to track real world inflation. But then it's like, well, where's real world inflation coming from? And then it's like, do you create one of these for every country or do you. Are you just doing it off the US dollar because, like, inflation against what? You know.
00:59:09.222 - 00:59:45.718, Speaker A: Yeah, no, certainly. I mean, there's like deflation in China. There's 300%, 600% inflation in certain places. Um, so, yeah, it is. It is challenged. Um, I do agree with you, it is kind of this unsolved holy grail in crypto privacy. And having a stable coin that is not tied to fiat is, is, I think, the most ambit, perhaps two of the most ambitious things that we can work on, on a truly digitally native like, global system that transcends the one.
00:59:45.726 - 01:00:05.822, Speaker B: That feels the most accomplishable. Why is a, why is a p two p exchange a fully on chain p two p exchange so hard? I'm sure it's very hard from an engineering perspective. You know, it's probably the incentives are broken for that, because if you want to go build an exchange, the market, the market's not going to reward you for it.
01:00:05.998 - 01:00:52.212, Speaker A: I mean, ammunition. What's an amm, an automatic market maker like uniswap, or a money market like Ave and compound? Now I think it's not strictly peer to peer because you don't necessarily know the peer, you're trading against the pool. So it's an aggregation. But I would say that to me is maybe that's where we land. Because matching, like, what was that company that went public that did loans like peer to peer loans? What was the name of it?
01:00:52.228 - 01:00:52.944, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:00:54.444 - 01:01:48.574, Speaker A: Based in San Francisco. I got a buddy of mine that ended up leaving go work there. But like Prosper, Prosper didn't go public. I think you had Prosper and then another company and at some point in that assembly line of matching an independent borrower, like they acted as an intermediary to dish out those, those loans. Initially they started purely peer to peer, but over time they morphed into something like what is now a pool, which is they would, they would, as soon as they got scale, they pre, they package all of those loans and then they sold it off to a hedge fund in a low like interest rate environment. That model was fabulous for a hedge fund to capture meaningful yield. The problem was adverse selection, and the people that were using you couldn't get a typical loan.
01:01:48.574 - 01:02:38.194, Speaker A: So then they were much riskier people. And so anyways, the scale of peer to peer marketplaces is always hard. I would say I'm content with the hybrid model, if you will, of what I consider to be a good balanced way of these marketplaces, which is an Amm and a money market that you see in Defi on chain like that to me is a huge novelty and I think it's great. What else would you want to see in appear like a p two p exchange? What activity in the economy would, would suddenly jump ten x because you had an on chain p two p exchange. I just don't see it like, you know what I mean? Like what would it be?
01:02:41.934 - 01:02:46.474, Speaker B: It's, I mean, it's probably something that you can't see. It's probably an emerging and less developed markets, right?
01:02:47.174 - 01:03:30.366, Speaker A: True. Yeah, I guess. I guess the thing about that, that we haven't touched on a lot is this real world assets, which is in some ways a p two p exchange. If you're not trading like an NFT, like a digital thing, it's a physical thing and that's a real world asset. And so you don't have a reputation score. Who's going to be the Oracle? Who's going to enforce that? These are all questions that I have, which is when you think about marketplaces for stuff like an eBay or an Amazon, it's tough, right? Because you have real world, like atoms meet bits. It's complicated.
01:03:30.366 - 01:04:21.144, Speaker A: Like with real world assets, right? I mean, I think with real world assets, most people are excited about, you know, having institution a trade with institution b on chain or institution a. Say a company has a huge amount of accounts receivable. They want to put that on the blockchain. And then, you know, someone syndicates ads and sells out. Like that feels more doable than a Craigslist sort of Amazon marketplace on chain. Like, I don't see it. Maybe Amazon and all these web, again, I'm saying most of these marketplaces would be benefited in the amount of activity.
01:04:21.144 - 01:04:28.236, Speaker A: Less fraud, faster checkout. If you had stable coins. If they allowed stable coins, yeah, which.
01:04:28.260 - 01:04:31.620, Speaker B: By the way is stable coins are the best example of real world assets that we have.
01:04:31.652 - 01:05:25.624, Speaker A: Right, exactly. I mean, they're, they're regulated. There's a dollar sits in a bank account like a USDC, like Paxos, whatever, it's gonna happen. It's already happening. And I think the web, two brands that all of them have, have struggled with denying certain customers from certain places the credit cards get rejected for simple reasons, like because the credit card is in a country that, I don't know, it's whatever, Nigeria or whatever doesn't mean that all of the transactions are fraudulent. It's just there, there have been attempts from stripe and shopifying all these players to reduce the false. What is the false positives and do faster checkout, which is a huge problem.
01:05:25.624 - 01:06:21.140, Speaker A: So anyways, churn, right? If you're a SaaS company, a software company or news, whatever type of subscription that is happening. I can't like the amount of renewals that don't happen because that underlying customer changes payment information and doesn't. It's just like, like it's so obvious that when you have a smart contract, an account abstraction like all that is billions of dollars that have, that have just are left on the table. It's the lowest hanging fruit. Payments is an area that when you first come to crypto, at least for me, it was like it was only bitcoin. And so you said, wow, this would be a really interesting medium of exchange. And then you realize, no, you know what, I don't want to defend my bitcoin, you know, playing poker nights and.
01:06:21.252 - 01:06:26.972, Speaker B: Yeah, remember all the e commerce attempts back in 2018 failed because people, no one wants to spend their bitcoin and then no one wants to spend their.
01:06:26.988 - 01:06:35.448, Speaker A: E. So bitcoin is not money because it's not a medium of exchange. It's not a very good one, I think. Yeah, but save coins are.
01:06:35.616 - 01:06:35.992, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:36.048 - 01:06:36.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:38.784 - 01:06:42.764, Speaker B: Man. Good pod. I have a final round interview in 1 minute, so.
01:06:43.064 - 01:06:46.040, Speaker A: Oh wow, you're hiring a lot, right?
01:06:46.112 - 01:06:50.684, Speaker B: Sales and engineers. Salespeople and engineers. Get at us. Slide through the DM's.
01:06:51.384 - 01:06:53.044, Speaker A: Is this for the research product?
01:06:54.184 - 01:07:10.324, Speaker B: Whole company we got. We're hiring one engineer for the editorial site and then a bunch of folks on the. For the research government and other thing we're launching in two weeks at permissionless. Yeah. And then we got it. We're hiring for sales across the board. So.
01:07:11.184 - 01:07:22.752, Speaker A: Very nice. I just say one thing. I've re become a subscriber again of YouTube Premium. I think they didn't allow it in your. I don't. Huge game changer.
01:07:22.848 - 01:07:24.336, Speaker B: Same like I love it.
01:07:24.440 - 01:07:40.330, Speaker A: I now consuming so many videos like I was driving for like 8 hours or 7 hours. I just played pretty much every interview from like Bill Ackman, Seth Klarman, like Howard Marks. I was just like. And then constantly. It was just amazing. It's like a net. It's huge.
01:07:40.330 - 01:07:45.130, Speaker A: I mean education is gonna be. YouTube is the best university in the world. It is crazy.
01:07:45.242 - 01:07:50.778, Speaker B: YouTube Premium is a good, good investment. What, 1015 bucks the ad you can download it to four planes.
01:07:50.866 - 01:08:04.714, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. Anyways, that was. I've been hooked, hooked on YouTube premium. Now I'm streaming all day. So that's my generalized thing that I. Video or book.
01:08:05.494 - 01:08:05.966, Speaker B: Nice.
01:08:06.030 - 01:08:08.914, Speaker A: What have you got? Anything, anything noteworthy on your side?
01:08:09.254 - 01:08:24.984, Speaker B: Um, no, no. I've been like watching. I've been watching hard knocks, the football shit. I've been like needing to turn my brain. I've been working too much and uh. Trying to turn my brain off at the end of the day. So I've been watching hard knocks.
01:08:25.764 - 01:08:26.660, Speaker A: Not bad.
01:08:26.812 - 01:08:27.356, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:27.460 - 01:08:44.988, Speaker A: All right, folks, hopefully we didn't give you brain pain in this episode. Um, leave a comment. I am reading them. Uh, more people commented last week. Absolutely. Now that I'm YouTube Premium, of course you know that I'm going to be reading them. Drop us a comment if you want us to talk about particular thing or not.
01:08:45.036 - 01:08:51.244, Speaker B: Otherwise we're going to kick off the next episode, the next roundup. We're going to read some of the the, we're going to read some of the best comments.
01:08:51.744 - 01:09:02.776, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. That's a good idea. All right, folks, thanks for tuning in. Have a great rest of the week. Weekend. We'll see you here next week before the last one, before the big, big day.
01:09:02.840 - 01:09:04.896, Speaker B: Permissionless, let's go. See you guys next week.
01:09:04.920 - 01:09:05.144, Speaker A: Let's go.
