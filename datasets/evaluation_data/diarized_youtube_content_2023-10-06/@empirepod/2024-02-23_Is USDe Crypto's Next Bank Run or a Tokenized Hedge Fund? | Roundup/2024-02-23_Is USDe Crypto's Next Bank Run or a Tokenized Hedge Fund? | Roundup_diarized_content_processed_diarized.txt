00:00:00.160 - 00:00:11.034, Speaker A: Problem is, most people over intellectualized markets, they're highly psychological. Investing is not like a. It is a mathematical financial thing, but it's ultimately, if you don't understand psychology, good luck. Like, seriously, good luck.
00:00:11.574 - 00:00:55.862, Speaker B: If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain. And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain, to put it nicely. That is why we are incredibly excited to have the Wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast, stewards of the wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show, we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole NFT, just for Empire listeners, this episode is brought to you by PayPal here at Empire. You know that Santi and I are really into real world use cases and always on the lookout for the next killer blockchain app. We're excited to share that PayPal has arrived in crypto to unveil a way to seamlessly connect fiat to digital currencies.
00:00:55.862 - 00:01:17.404, Speaker B: Later in the show, you will find out how you can use PyUSd to check out at millions of online stores. What's up, everyone? Happy Friday. Or Saturday, or Sunday. Whenever you're listening to this, we got Santi and we got special guest mister Matt Feiback from Blockworks Research. Santi. Matt, welcome to the show.
00:01:17.564 - 00:01:18.300, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:18.412 - 00:01:19.444, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:19.564 - 00:01:20.748, Speaker A: It's great to be here.
00:01:20.836 - 00:01:33.644, Speaker B: It's great to be here. It is a glorious day to be here. Or as glorious day as the bad kids like to say, it is a bad morning. So what's going on? How you doing, Santi?
00:01:34.584 - 00:02:18.504, Speaker A: I'm doing great. I'm excited because Matt, as I hear, as you described, he's the brains behind Blockworks research. There has been a lot of controversy on Twitter recently, particular project out there that reminds people of terra. As always, crypto. Twitter always has very informed, uninformed opinions and has very visceral reaction to certain ideas, like blast. So now blast people seems to be coming around to that project. Anyways, I think, yeah, crypto is a very interesting ecosystem where it's very vocal, there's a lot of noise, and people tend to make up their minds very quickly on certain things and they have to revisit and chew Glass a bit.
00:02:18.504 - 00:02:32.756, Speaker A: But thankfully, we have Matt here who has more informed opinions and 99.999% of crypto Twitter. And so hopefully in this episode, we can get kind of, like, more into the weeds of, like, some of the mechanisms for and the project we're talking about Matt. You can fill us in here. But it's Athena, right?
00:02:32.780 - 00:02:32.980, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:33.012 - 00:02:40.812, Speaker A: So people can. Obviously, it's very topical. So we could start there. There's a lot that we can discuss, but. Yeah. Really excited for the pod.
00:02:40.908 - 00:02:52.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So I want to talk. Athena Labs with Matt. I also want to talk. There's a little bit of drama with them. So Ave's risk manager the last couple of years was gauntlet, and they announced that they're stopping work with Aave. You don't really see this that much.
00:02:52.994 - 00:03:03.342, Speaker B: It's kind of like the analogy I would use would be like a consulting firm firing their client or a SaaS provider selling firing their customer. I'd love to get Matt's take on this.
00:03:03.358 - 00:03:07.674, Speaker A: It wouldn't go as far as saying the auditor stopping auditing a particular firm.
00:03:08.614 - 00:03:11.854, Speaker B: I didn't want to say that because that implies a certain underlying risk.
00:03:11.934 - 00:03:20.166, Speaker A: It's not. It's an unfair comparison. Yeah, you almost. Well, it makes you wonder if it was gauntlet that terminated the relationship or ave they terminated that relationship.
00:03:20.350 - 00:03:36.862, Speaker B: Yeah. So we'll get Matt's take on that whole bunch of other stuff. AI coins are ripping. Santi, you had an interesting poll about what's going to outperform. Is it nfTs? Is it whatever? And at the time, NFTs were the lowest voted on thing. And I said, feels very obvious. I think NFTs will outperform the rest of the market.
00:03:36.862 - 00:03:55.888, Speaker B: And got a bunch of funny comments in my DM's from that. So maybe we can talk about that. But before we do that, we are hosting an empire listening party, um, at Das. We got Santi to. Yeah, we got Santi to fly in for Das. Um, got him to change his flight. And he's coming.
00:03:55.888 - 00:03:58.364, Speaker B: Uh, so. So Wednesday, six to 08:00 p.m.
00:03:58.864 - 00:04:04.288, Speaker A: The amount of over, like nightmare, folks, you better show up to this goddamn thing.
00:04:04.416 - 00:04:17.410, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. If you're coming to Das, here are the requirements. If you're coming to Das, uh, and you're an empire listener. And how can we verify you're an empire listener, you might ask? We can't. We can't. It's a trust thing.
00:04:17.410 - 00:04:20.386, Speaker B: So you have to be an empire listener. But we can't.
00:04:20.410 - 00:04:28.050, Speaker A: I don't know about you, man. I'm gonna be in the. I'm gonna be in the fucking door. Show me your Spotify, like, 2023 top podcast vampire. Not in one of those.
00:04:28.082 - 00:04:34.146, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, baby. So, yeah, so we should verify that.
00:04:34.330 - 00:04:38.174, Speaker A: We should throw an Easter egg in some of these episodes, you know, be like, what is the code?
00:04:38.474 - 00:04:49.536, Speaker B: The code? Yeah, exactly. The code is bald. You have to say bald at the door. And only empire listeners will get it. So. Yeah, but we can verify that you have a das ticket. So go get your das ticket.
00:04:49.536 - 00:05:14.616, Speaker B: We hit a big milestone today, which is we just sold our thousandth Das ticket. We have 1000 tickets. Our ticket goal and registering goal for Das was 1200. We were going to rip past that goal, it looks like. I would guess we'll end up around 1500 or 1600, which means the hotel or the Hilton where we're hosting it is going to shut us down from continuing to sell tickets. So we're going to, at some point soon have to shut down ticket sales.
00:05:14.800 - 00:05:40.732, Speaker A: Actually, I have a free ticket to give out, so maybe I'll do something special about that because I don't have anyone else to give it to. But hey, maybe this is a good opportunity to. If you're listening out there, maybe the most creative comment on Farcaster will get a free ticket because as a speaker, right, I get a free ticket. Maybe I'm not supposed to say this, but I do. But anyways, maybe the most creative comment on forecaster will get this ticket on me. Sure.
00:05:40.788 - 00:05:44.068, Speaker B: I don't even know how you have a free ticket, but yeah, I love.
00:05:44.116 - 00:05:45.596, Speaker A: What you wanted to charge me.
00:05:45.700 - 00:05:50.636, Speaker B: That's fine. Sure, whatever you say, Zondi. All right, so let's.
00:05:50.740 - 00:05:52.244, Speaker A: We may have to edit this up.
00:05:52.404 - 00:06:15.990, Speaker B: Let's get into Athena Labs. Okay, so Athena Labs, here's the TL doctor on Athena labs. It is a they. You know what? I'm not even gonna try to do this. Matt, give us the Tldr of why everyone is talking about Athena labs this week and what happened. You don't need to go into too many of the details on how it works. I'll kind of pull that stuff out of you.
00:06:15.990 - 00:06:20.874, Speaker B: But what happened with Athena Labs? What was their fundraise and, like, high level? What is Athena Labs?
00:06:21.494 - 00:06:46.330, Speaker C: So Athena Labs has launched the newest stable coin to the market USDCE. They've immediately hit their cap of 100 million TvL. So 100 mil USDC outstanding. It's a really interesting project, and it's offering something like 27% yield. So there's a, you know, narrative going around like, is this the new Terra Luna? And things of that nature. So it's kind of caused this huge stir on Twitter. It is not the new Terra Luna.
00:06:46.330 - 00:06:54.734, Speaker C: It's employing a pretty interesting strategy in order to actually get that yield back to its holders and it's a really cool team, and they're building something pretty awesome.
00:06:56.394 - 00:06:58.254, Speaker B: Okay, so is it a stable coin, though?
00:06:58.834 - 00:07:06.968, Speaker A: My understanding was they don't market themselves as a stable coin. It's sort of a tokenized hedge fund that is playing, like, the basis trademark.
00:07:07.026 - 00:07:07.196, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:07.220 - 00:07:50.618, Speaker C: So the way I look at it, it is a kind of a yield vault wrapped in a stablecoin narrative. So we've seen yield vaults in the past have all kinds of strategies, including some actually deploy the same strategy that Athena is deploying. So that's like a delta neutral strategy where you hold a long position, you hold a short position so that you're not exposed to the price, but maybe you're getting a carry or an interest rate from something like staking ETH, or from being short perps, which has a negative funding, or has positive funding rate, which returns yield to shorts. So Athena kind of looks very similar to those. To those yield vaults of a past era, but wrapped in the stablecoin narrative, where actually, if you deposit into the vault, you receive this USDCe stablecoin collateralized by those positions.
00:07:50.746 - 00:08:13.032, Speaker B: So there's two products here, right? There's USD, there's USde, and then there's s USde, is my understanding. So usde. And maybe we can walk through both of those. So USDe is just the stable coin that's pegged to the US dollar. Basically, it is a combination. The way they do that is a combination of staked ETH and perps to maintain the peg. And then there's another product, which is s USDE.
00:08:13.032 - 00:08:38.658, Speaker B: The e being Athena, the s being staked. So s Usde that generates yield, kind of like a traditional bond. And I think a lot of their marketing was like, we enable the Internet bond. My understanding is USde is backed by. Basically, yeah, you've got staked ETH deposits and short purpose positions. And then those two assets work together to fully collateralize the value of USDE. And that kind of keeps the total value stable.
00:08:38.658 - 00:08:43.850, Speaker B: Can you maybe give us a better explanation than I. Than I did stumbling over that, Matt?
00:08:44.002 - 00:09:08.654, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So maybe it would help to explain the lifecycle of how you get to susde eventually. So it starts with market makers. Only whitelisted market makers are actually allowed to mint this Uste token. So what they do is they go and deposit a staked ETH asset, a link LSD. So something like Lido staked ETH or binance staked ETH, and they deposited into the protocol. Athena then goes and holds this position on a centralized exchange.
00:09:08.654 - 00:09:39.746, Speaker C: Like a binance or an OKX. I believe they have five exchanges that they're currently using to hold their collateral. They actually have custodian copper who isn't holding the collateral that's not currently being used. But at the end of the day, it does end up on these exchanges. They use this staked ETH as collateral to then open a short position. So let's say, you know, you're a market maker, you put one steth into Athena, you get call, let's say ETH $3,000, you get 3000 USD. At this point, Athena takes that one staked ETH, one steeth, and puts it into finance.
00:09:39.746 - 00:10:00.840, Speaker C: They then open a short one ETH position against that one steeth collateral. So now, whether ETH goes up or down, it doesn't matter, you know, the price. There's no price exposure anymore. If it goes up, you know, the price of the. The short loses value, but the Steve gains value. Likewise, if it goes down, the short gains value, but the Steve loses value. So you're what's called delta neutral at this point.
00:10:00.840 - 00:10:34.724, Speaker C: And, uh, that's how what's collateralizing that one USD outstanding? Anyone who has USD can then go stake it with the Athena protocol to not only get yield, so the, you know the yield that's the result of both the staked ethanol yield, which is 2.6% or something like that, as well as the yield from holding those short positions. Because right now the funding rate in crypto is really high. So shorts get paid a lot to hold their positions open. But additionally, you get shards, which is like Athena's version of points, with speculators thinking that they'll likely either be an Athena governance token airdrop, or maybe even a USDC airdrop at some point.
00:10:35.664 - 00:10:52.024, Speaker A: How scalable is this model? And can it work in all kinds of market conditions? Meaning your point is a good one, which is now you're getting paid a lot if you're going short, like reverse this model, or implement this model nine months ago. Can it work?
00:10:52.444 - 00:11:36.844, Speaker C: Yeah, so they have pretty good back to back testing data on their website, and it actually can work. But Athena already makes up 5% of total ETH open interest, which as that number scales, likely the funding rates will come down, meaning those short positions will get paid less yield from their funding rate, funding rates will come down, and the token will have less yield. Additionally, it's really only in a bull market that we see these egregious annualized funding rates where something like 20, 30, 40, even 60, 70% is paid annualized by longs to hold their positions open. So the answer is, it's a lot tougher to have this type of product in a bear market. And then additionally, even in a bull market, as it scales, once it gets to in the billions, it likely will no longer have that same type of return that it does today.
00:11:37.164 - 00:12:10.494, Speaker A: So, okay, so the yield right now is 27 or so. People are like, okay, that's. They don't know where the yield's coming from. You are the yield. So that goes down. Is there a point where the yield goes, reaches a certain point where it no longer is interesting, attractive to people, and I guess then that mechanism sort of people leave, and then there's sort of like a natural equilibrium where the yield kind of settles. And do you have a sense of where that could be? Is it 6%? Is it eight? Is it staked?
00:12:11.834 - 00:12:42.770, Speaker C: There's a few things to keep in mind there, which is one, there's a risk that the staked assets de peg, so Steve isn't actually completely pegged to eat. There's also risk in the exchange, in the custody, in the custodian, so in copper, and there's also risk in the exchanges. So you have to price these risks in. From my perspective and the way I look at it, maybe something like five, 6%. So it's definitely not zero. There is risk in using this protocol, but the yield is very promising. Another aspect of the yield is from the inefficiency in the funding rate market.
00:12:42.770 - 00:13:15.342, Speaker C: So funding rates aren't equal across all exchanges today. That's likely because not all high value market makers are plugged in across all different exchanges. So Athena will actually help these funding rates become more efficient across different exchanges. Additionally, the yield is actually far above 27% right now, because only half of the USDCE is actually staked. So it's almost double that. It's worth noting that's like, that's annualized, based on the last week's data, and funding rates change every hour. So, you know, it could.
00:13:15.342 - 00:13:39.476, Speaker C: It could be drastically different than that. In reality, I would say if the funding rates came down, or, sorry, if the interest on s USDE came down below 10%, it now starts to become like, is this really a positive ev? Is this really a good expected value versus the risks that are involved? But whether or not the market really cares about that, or just cares about getting these points, that's definitely up for debate.
00:13:39.660 - 00:13:46.544, Speaker B: Matt, can you explain just funding rates again for people who don't know what they are and what are funding rates in crypto?
00:13:47.044 - 00:14:23.548, Speaker C: Yeah, so perpetual futures are a novel instrument in crypto. It's really only predominantly for crypto assets that this type of derivative trades. If there is a aggregate long bias amongst traders looking for leverage, more traders out there want long leverage than short leverage. Longs have to pay shorts in order to hold their longs open. Likewise, if there's more interest, if there's more volume looking to short an asset than long an asset, shorts have to pay longs. And the funding rates paid an hourly cadence. So when you look at Athena and they say over the last week, the average funding rate has been 27% annualized in our favor.
00:14:23.548 - 00:14:34.336, Speaker C: Really what that means is taking every hour over the last seven days and then annualizing it over 365 days, that's 27%. Longs are paying shorts to hold those longs open.
00:14:34.480 - 00:15:05.314, Speaker B: Okay, so funding rates are the fee that perps traders need to pay based on the kind of sentiment to the market. If more traders are bullish and are long, they are paying the short traders a fee and obviously vice versa. So in this current environment, ETH, the other thing that happened this week, ETH hit three k or touched up on it. So traders are very bullish ETH, which means the funding rate is positive, which means that the long pervs holders are paying the short holders here and right now. The rate, what's the funding rate? Like 20% or 23% or something.
00:15:05.814 - 00:15:16.886, Speaker C: It's different across exchanges. Like on binance, it's about 11%, so long as you're paying shorts about 11% annualized. But if you go look at an exchange like DyDX, it's closer to 80%, or vertex, or some of these taxes.
00:15:17.030 - 00:16:02.644, Speaker B: So when I see on Athena that I'm getting this 27% number, that's basically you've got a 4% yield coming from staking yield, which is like the consensus rewards, the execution level fees and the MEV block builder bids, and that's 4%. Then there's another 23% coming from the funding rate. And is it right to say that Athena gets that 23% because the longs are paying Athena due to Athena short positions? Correct. Okay, got it. What happens if sentiment shifts? Bearish? Like I think Santi was asking about nine months ago. So if, let's say, I have a feeling Athena is going to rip. And next 18 months, Athena does super well.
00:16:02.644 - 00:16:12.332, Speaker B: But then one day, sentiment changes. We go into a bear market, funding rates flip. What happens to this? At this point, we actually have a.
00:16:12.348 - 00:16:49.828, Speaker C: Report on blockworks research where we do a lot of back testing of different perps over the bear market and the funding rates to do with those perps. I believe it's called basis basis trading. If you search up blockwork, research basis trading will pop up. Historically, even in bear markets, funding rates do trend positive. And so likely if Athena didn't have a billion dollars, it would still be a profitable strategy. But likely they may think that the caps that they're able to deploy during a bull market, meaning right now the strategy is highly scalable. So if it grows too big in a bear market, it could have a large implication that maybe funding rates would be negative in the bear market.
00:16:49.828 - 00:16:54.064, Speaker C: And all of a sudden now Athene is actually losing money to hold these positions open.
00:16:54.404 - 00:18:02.984, Speaker A: That's what I want to explore, because funding rates, to your point, are not homogeneous, standardized across exchanges or decentralized protocols like vertex and others. So they're quite different in the way they're calculated, which is not so much of an issue. I think now you're going to have a, a pretty big buyer, constant buyer of these things in the market, which is going to be this project. Whats the worst that can happen in your mind? Is it that the centralized exchange risk is real, the counterparty risk? Somehow that part of the equation breaks down? Or is it. Im less concerned about the model becoming less attractive, because in a world where people, for instance, if yield comes down to 7% to a point where people just feel that it doesn't compensate for the risks out there, what you will see is demand go down and then naturally yields would go up. Presumably there will be a clearing rate. The market will figure that out.
00:18:02.984 - 00:18:46.414, Speaker A: But the issue, for instance, with Terra was you had what was marketed as a stable coin that, you know, was, you know, the way I think of it is a lot of people came into the house, they wanted to play in this yield and capture, do a lot of this art and anchor or whatever. The size of the door didn't grow. So the minute some people started to want to exit, and it happened all at once, the way these things typically do in the bank run type of situation. That's where you have the issue where people can't get out, people can't redeem, and then it depegs and then it has a downward spiral. That is not the case here, right?
00:18:47.394 - 00:19:19.580, Speaker C: Yeah, correct. I think there is some negative encumbrance as far as winding down positions, increase fees. So everyone leaving at once does mean it's not positive for the protocol, but it's not this huge lack of liquidity or this huge event that absolutely destroys the protocol. So you ask, like, where I see the largest risk, it's not in funding rate switching. Like, yes, that's a risk, but like you said, I think that the market hopefully will be somewhat efficient there. Um, the big risk is in counterparty risk. So they're holding a lot of funds on exchanges.
00:19:19.580 - 00:19:53.168, Speaker C: Like, you know, it's diversified across five exchanges, but likely, if the funding rate on one of those goes super positive, meaning it's really profitable to hold a short open there, they'll put more funds there. Um, as we've seen in crypto, over and over again, even the most trustworthy exchanges do have risk. Like, there's no. There's no other way to look at it. Besides, there is risk in holding money on centralized exchanges. Likely in the future, they'll also hold money on decentralized exchanges, given that, you know, the funding rates there are even more promising and fruitful. So definitely from my perspective, that's where the largest risks are involved.
00:19:53.168 - 00:20:04.756, Speaker C: Using copper as a custodian does help, but it doesn't completely alleviate that risk. And, yeah, so that's where I would see the biggest potential concern. As a holder of USDCE, when they.
00:20:04.780 - 00:20:59.034, Speaker A: Try to implement this strategy you mentioned, there is a scenario where they lose a pretty significant amount of money if they don't do this efficiently. Is that a function of, as they scale, it becomes harder and harder to implement the strategy, and other people are actually seeing what they're doing. So they can. And so can you walk us through kind of the scenario where it starts becoming unprofitable because there's a huge fluctuation in the funding rates or whatever, where they need to unwind these positions fairly quickly, so they kind of exit in a very unorderly manner. The protocol there would incur some bad debt. Are the users also going to participate in that downside, or is that going to come from an insurance type of fund? I'm curious how that would work.
00:20:59.854 - 00:21:36.572, Speaker C: So I literally heard today that they are increasing the insurance fund take rate. So there is an insurance fund take rate. It's extremely small right now, but given that the yield might be as high as 40% this week for s USDCE annualized, that is, they are deciding. They've decided that, I think, 50% of the total yield will actually go bootstrap an insurance fund, which I think is an extremely smart and important decision, because it is very much possible that that is a scenario that could occur. You know, funding rates flip against them, and then you don't wind the positions. It's not like, all of a sudden, there's a huge hole in their balance sheet. But it does mean there's this.
00:21:36.572 - 00:22:13.112, Speaker C: You know, there's a scenario where not every USDC is completely backed by $1. So bootstrapping the insurance fund is awesome. And given that the rates are so high right now, likely they can get it to a very healthy position where that risk is mostly mitigated. Um, so, yeah, I think that it's a good decision, and there is an insurance fund that will help take on some of the risk. Where there's one thing that comes to mind is because funding rates change hourly, even if a funding rate flips against them for 1 hour, meaning they have an open short and the funding rate goes negative. So they have to pay to hold that position open. It might not make sense to close the position because closing the position incurs costs.
00:22:13.112 - 00:22:27.816, Speaker C: So you're putting a lot of trust in them as kind of a hedge fund manager type position, that they know what they're doing and they back tested, and that they know when to close positions and when to them open. So there is definitely that component to it as well. Like, what are their skills as a trader?
00:22:28.000 - 00:22:46.520, Speaker B: Yeah, this is. So they have a decision to make here, Matt. Right. There's someone at Athena who basically says, look, the max that we can offer is the ETH staking yield. Let's call it 4% plus the funding rate. Let's call it going to make 23%. So we can offer a max of 27.
00:22:46.520 - 00:23:13.814, Speaker B: And then there's basically a delta that they could. That they could move into the insurance fund. So they could basically say, we're going to move 12% of that into the insurance fund, start building up the insurance fund because they think that offering 15% to the market is still good enough to pull user assets. Yeah, exactly. Okay. And the main risks here are funding rates moving against them. But like you said, it's really like custodial and exchange risk.
00:23:13.814 - 00:23:17.094, Speaker B: You know, basically a big sex blows up.
00:23:17.634 - 00:23:20.614, Speaker C: Yeah. And then would add in one other risk in poor execution.
00:23:21.994 - 00:23:47.624, Speaker B: And what do you think of, like, as liquid restaking tokens start to kind of take off? Like, Athena wants to juice yield a little more. Like, they start to play with liquid restaking tokens as collateral. They start. That means they can, like, juice the yield. Maybe an LR, like, maybe a liquid restaking token gets slashed. Like, what's the risk there? Is that a risk in your mind?
00:23:48.244 - 00:24:09.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I think adding restaking tokens into the mix definitely increases the risk of the protocol and likely, given that it's extremely or seemingly extremely profitable to be deploying these delta neutral trades or these market neutral trades today. I don't see a reason that they would want to go that route besides maybe catching the Eigen layer, AV's narrative. So. Yeah, I don't think it really.
00:24:09.272 - 00:24:14.044, Speaker B: The only reason they would go that way is if they just start to get greedy. Like, that's a. What I. That's just a greedy.
00:24:14.904 - 00:24:31.204, Speaker A: Total detraction from the strategy. Like, who is controlling the risk framework and parameters is as a token holder. Like, do you have a say in governance and kind of that process, or you're just trusting the team to be sophisticated and savvy enough to implement the strategy?
00:24:31.544 - 00:24:37.958, Speaker C: Yeah. Today you're basically putting money into a hedge fund. It's kind of a one way. Yeah. It's a tokenized hedge fund.
00:24:38.006 - 00:24:39.074, Speaker A: It's not a stable.
00:24:39.734 - 00:24:45.634, Speaker C: It's a yield vault wrapped in a stable coin and points narrative. It's like kind of yearn finance 2.0.
00:24:46.974 - 00:24:49.462, Speaker A: Yep. How big?
00:24:49.558 - 00:24:52.674, Speaker B: The worst part about Athena was just the marketing as a stable coin.
00:24:53.054 - 00:24:54.982, Speaker A: Yeah. It should never have been marketed as a stable.
00:24:55.038 - 00:24:59.206, Speaker B: But everything else like this, this all makes a lot of sense to me. Yeah.
00:24:59.230 - 00:25:05.742, Speaker C: I think it's a really, really cool experiment. I'm glad that someone's doing it, and there is definitely inefficiencies in the funding rate market.
00:25:05.878 - 00:25:09.074, Speaker A: Can we talk about, like, others have tried to do this before.
00:25:09.854 - 00:25:10.594, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:11.294 - 00:25:13.118, Speaker A: And there's another project, I believe.
00:25:13.246 - 00:25:14.954, Speaker B: Who was it? Who'd you mention?
00:25:15.334 - 00:25:30.136, Speaker A: Xiao actually had a good tweet about this. I think it's lemma and someone else. They have been. Attempts to do this in a tokenized manner, like, certain projects have done it, and I'm not as familiar, but I was wondering, Matt, if you had more insight into that.
00:25:30.310 - 00:25:40.404, Speaker C: Yeah, one actually comes to mind. It's a. It was a project on Solana that, you know, ceased to exist. I don't know what went wrong, but it was called friction. So they had a token vault.
00:25:40.444 - 00:25:42.284, Speaker A: That was direction in them.
00:25:42.324 - 00:25:43.532, Speaker B: I was an investor, too.
00:25:43.668 - 00:26:19.576, Speaker C: Yeah, it was really cool. Really cool. But, you know, deep in a bear market, without the points narrative, without the stable coin narrative, it didn't work. I forget the exact strategy, but it was something like longing, soul staking it. So getting some 8% or something like that per year from that position and then shorting it on, I want to say mango finance or one of the other perps taxes over on Solana, and so very similar. But it didn't have that idea of you, didn't receive a stable coin in return. Um, and there were no points at the time, so it, you know, didn't really see a whole lot of attractions, a whole lot of interest from the market, at least not even in it's slightly comparable to Athena manner.
00:26:19.760 - 00:26:35.146, Speaker A: Can we talk about the so, so the added element here is that you receive out this stable instrument and then you has. Has some utility that you can then go use in other parts of the ecosystem than Defi. Like the composability element of that. Right. Is a big added feature is what you're saying.
00:26:35.330 - 00:26:48.054, Speaker C: Yeah. So there isn't really a whole lot you can do with it yet, but you would imagine that as USDC, it's a brand new product. As it gets more integrations and you're able to do it more with it, there is that added element that actually does have some value.
00:26:48.674 - 00:26:49.130, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:49.202 - 00:26:49.450, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:49.482 - 00:27:06.990, Speaker A: Because maybe you can use it for other things. Right. You can go then and deposit, get. Get back this, what is it? Stablecoin ish product, and then go use that to long and basically rinse, repeat right. Over and over.
00:27:07.182 - 00:27:10.194, Speaker C: Sounds like what very well could end up happening.
00:27:11.334 - 00:27:37.046, Speaker A: Yeah, that would add a bit more. Yeah, I guess on the user side would add more. Could. Well, does it? I mean, how is that any different? I'm trying to think of, like, if you're a user and you. You do this in a scenario where you can, like, take it out and then, like, rinse, repeat over and over to use juice more yield in the same way. People are doing that with compound.
00:27:37.150 - 00:27:37.462, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:37.518 - 00:27:44.594, Speaker A: And just farming it. Right. You're depositing USDC, borrowing dai, like, doing that loop over and over again. Right?
00:27:45.414 - 00:28:23.994, Speaker C: Yeah. See, the same thing with steeth. Very predominant trade, I guess, in this scenario, the way it would look would be you deposits as market maker, you deposit Steth into Athena, you got USDC, you borrow steeth against it, and you'd continue looping it to try to juice your yield. I don't actually. I think today, like, a lot of the interest in Athena is likely these shards, which is their version of points. So people attempting to get an airdrop of some sort, whether it be an Athena governance token or USDC or some combination of the two. And, you know, we're just at that point in the market where that's something that it seems everyone is interested in and wanting.
00:28:24.574 - 00:28:25.394, Speaker B: Hmm.
00:28:27.094 - 00:28:28.274, Speaker A: Are you doing it?
00:28:29.494 - 00:28:37.022, Speaker C: I'm actually not in Athena right now, but I probably should be. I've just been extremely busy, so haven't. Haven't had time. But I definitely would be.
00:28:37.038 - 00:28:53.164, Speaker B: Yeah, you would. Okay. And this is not. So, this. Now that I understand it better, this is nothing to do with Luna. Like, Luna blew up because this reflexive design, Luna got minted, sold to zero to protect the ust peg. And the anchor yield was subsidized at 20%.
00:28:53.164 - 00:29:01.784, Speaker B: Was never really sustainable. It's a totally different thing. I saw a lot of comparisons on Twitter, but they're completely different things now that I understand it better.
00:29:02.404 - 00:29:04.052, Speaker C: Yeah, there's no comparing them.
00:29:04.188 - 00:29:53.156, Speaker B: Yeah. Then there's this other interesting thing, Matt, that we were talking about in the telegram chat with the Athena guys and with guy about their go to market strategy. And Athena, the way I understand it is Athena is going to be providing l two s with the ability to essentially offer yield into l two s, which the reason I bring this up is Santi and I have been talking about this a lot the last couple of months. I know Santa was an investor in blast and one of my predictions of the year was every l two is going to eventually offer yield like native yield inside of inside of the l two. And it looks like, I think their head of growth posted something that they're now offering yield to. I think it's movement labs. I'll pull this up.
00:29:53.156 - 00:30:18.844, Speaker B: Mode network, which is on built on op stack, parallelfi, which I don't know, but they're an omni chain, l two and movement labs who Shanti and I are both investors in. And yeah, they said, here are the l two s that have announced integration of Athena Labs as native yield. There's five more coming. That should drive another half a billion in TvL, at least. L two s are the new yield consumers. Sandy, what do you think of this?
00:30:19.744 - 00:30:21.204, Speaker A: About what specifically?
00:30:21.624 - 00:30:29.444, Speaker B: Just about. Basically all of these l two s are now going to use Athena to offer the yield.
00:30:31.954 - 00:30:35.514, Speaker A: I. Again, I don't. I mean, it's. Market will do its thing. I'm less.
00:30:35.554 - 00:30:35.754, Speaker B: So.
00:30:35.794 - 00:31:12.484, Speaker A: As you were saying this, I was reading Tom Schmidt from Dragonfly and I believe they're investors in Athena along with Arthur's family office maelstrom, I think. Yeah, he has a really good tweet about just criticism and then response. And I would love to just link that to the episode. One of the things I want to go back to on this, like we're talking about funding rates and the risk is, quote, quote, USD is screwed when funding rate goes negative. And he says, which is, I want to call this out because I think it's important. Funding has only been net negative 10.8% over the past three years, and only for very small periods of time.
00:31:12.484 - 00:31:48.194, Speaker A: So effective to a few basis points per day, which is an interesting stat, actually. And so he says this is mitigated by the insurance fund, which also accrues buffered during periods of positive funding. And the way you can further mitigate this is potential risking via the governance token or staking the future. This problem is also self correcting, a shorts closeout versus self reinforcing. So I think the interesting thing here is funding rates. Athena is not the only player in these markets, and so. Exactly, this is what we talk about.
00:31:48.194 - 00:32:31.278, Speaker A: And there are a fair amount of people that are going to try to arb this out and correct itself. I think that's the most important element here of how this mechanism works, because they're not the only player, they'll be a very big one in funding markets. But yeah, if things get out of whack with one particular exchange, whether it's centralized or decentralized, these things tend to even out because there is a huge arp, say one exchange, like the funding rate shoots up, then that naturally gets armed out and it sort of settles. So this is a great thread. I mean, I won't go into all of it, but we should link it, because it's important for people to just read it and digest it.
00:32:31.366 - 00:32:46.482, Speaker B: Yeah, we can read a couple of these. I mean, Tom said people are upset. Basically, the way Tom lays this out is like, people are upset about this. And then his counter. So first one's, it's not a stable coin. He goes, yeah, it's not marketed as one. You can't guarantee 27%.
00:32:46.482 - 00:32:58.014, Speaker B: It's a Ponzi. Tom says it's not guaranteed. 27% is just the current market rate. USD is when ETH tanks. It's delta neutral language. Maybe Joseph can like bleep that out.
00:32:58.794 - 00:33:01.010, Speaker A: We're very liberal with language. We're not woke podcast.
00:33:01.042 - 00:33:09.026, Speaker B: I think Spotify dings us if we swear too much. Yeah, anyways, we'll link it. A lot of swear words in this thread, Tom.
00:33:09.090 - 00:33:11.802, Speaker A: So, yeah, Tom, keep it, keep it.
00:33:11.858 - 00:33:20.716, Speaker B: Actually, speaking at Penn, if anyone's gonna be there, I'm speaking at Penn. Blockchain conference or upenn something or another tomorrow with Tom on a panel.
00:33:20.740 - 00:33:21.804, Speaker A: So I've been in that conference.
00:33:21.844 - 00:33:29.104, Speaker B: It's actually pretty, pretty nice. Yeah. So, Matt, what are we missing here? Anything else on Athena we should talk about?
00:33:30.164 - 00:33:39.076, Speaker C: No, I think that people who are buying into it just need to realize, like, what they're. What they're, you know, what, what's collateralizing their position, what the risks are. But it's a really cool experiment, and.
00:33:39.100 - 00:33:41.872, Speaker B: I'm excited to see it grow nice.
00:33:42.048 - 00:34:09.114, Speaker A: Like we've been skewing negative, just being critical of it. What's the added benefit? What's the positive scenario here? It works beautifully. It scales a lot. People are earning some nice, juicy yield on it other than financial engineering and capturing some nice yield. Like, what else? I guess like a nice experiment in terms of, you know, capturing yield for people.
00:34:11.294 - 00:34:22.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's cool. Most people don't have the ability to go and automate a delta neutral trading strategy, so giving, you know, open access to this type of investment or this type of strategy is really pretty cool.
00:34:22.542 - 00:34:24.434, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed.
00:34:24.974 - 00:34:26.406, Speaker B: All right, shout out to them.
00:34:26.430 - 00:34:38.724, Speaker A: Look, I met. I met them last year. I spoke with the team a number of times, and I didn't end up investing, but nonetheless, I do appreciate the novelty of the mechanism, and I hope it works and I hope it doesn't fail.
00:34:38.884 - 00:34:40.224, Speaker B: Do you regret not investing?
00:34:40.804 - 00:34:42.228, Speaker A: I did not invest, no.
00:34:42.316 - 00:34:43.864, Speaker B: Do you regret not investing?
00:34:44.284 - 00:34:46.420, Speaker A: No. No.
00:34:46.612 - 00:34:49.304, Speaker B: Cool. Matt, will there be a token?
00:34:51.164 - 00:34:55.356, Speaker C: Everyone's speculating. That's like, you know, at the end of the day, Ansem was in their round.
00:34:55.420 - 00:34:55.812, Speaker B: I.
00:34:55.908 - 00:35:04.846, Speaker C: A lot of people in the round, I don't think would be investing if there wasn't a token. But I've also heard rumors the airdrop is going to be USDC. I have no idea.
00:35:04.910 - 00:35:05.270, Speaker B: Nothing?
00:35:05.342 - 00:35:07.822, Speaker C: Nothing. It's actually believable.
00:35:07.878 - 00:35:31.906, Speaker B: But who knows? The new metas was last cycles was Kobe, and you're out, and that's was Ansem, and you're around. All right, let's talk. Start gauntlet leaving Aave. Matt. For those who don't know, Matt leads a lot of our governance work. A post by John Morrow, one of the co founders of Gauntlet. Gauntlet is leaving Aave.
00:35:31.906 - 00:36:21.740, Speaker B: It's always been Gauntlet's mission to make Defi safer and more efficient for users, et cetera, et cetera. I won't read all of this, but the TLDR is that Gauntlet has served as the risk manager for Aave for the last four years, and now Gauntlet has announced that they are no longer, they said, quote, no longer able to continue our work with Aave. We will be terminating our payment stream as soon as possible and working with other contributors to find a replacement for the risk steward. And, yeah, there's some reasons that they laid out, but then they said, thanks, and, yeah, I'd love to hear. Matt, your take on, like, again, the analogy I brought up at the beginning was like, it's a bit odd for this to happen. It's like someone hiring. You know, it's like JP Morgan hires Deloitte and then, or, like, BCG or something, and then BCG fires JP Morgan.
00:36:21.740 - 00:36:39.608, Speaker B: Usually you have the client fires the service provider. In this case, you have the service provider firing the client. It's a bizarre thing, Matt. I'd love to hear both what's the drama and the speculation around this? And then what is maybe your more sober thoughts around this. Sure.
00:36:39.656 - 00:37:08.472, Speaker C: So Gauntlet was one of the first companies, maybe the first company that ever really went and operated in Dallas that tried to become a DAO service provider. I think their compound proposal might have actually been the first. First of its kind. So, as far as a company who has experience operating in daos, gauntlets, kind of the best example that I can think of. They operate in more than a few dows, and they've been doing it for a very long time. When you're selling into a DAO, it's a. You know, it's a tough customer.
00:37:08.472 - 00:37:54.262, Speaker C: It's hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds with different intentions for what the future of the protocol looks like, and it's impossible to please everyone. My speculation would be that a loud voice, like maybe even a single loud voice in the DAO, was able to make their life as far as operating within Aave so difficult that it just wasn't worth the headache to them. You know, this is speculation, but for reference, like that, one of the biggest delegates, AcI Ave Chan initiative, voted. It was one of the few votes against their proposal, their last proposal to continue their work with Aave. There's a lot of. So, of course, like, Aave had this big event with crv curves token, where they basically took on way too much risk. We're willing to take on way too much, too many crv deposits.
00:37:54.262 - 00:38:39.484, Speaker C: So it seems that a lot of people might even blame Gauntlet for that, given that they're the risk manager. But looking at it from an unbiased perspective, gauntlet actually went and created proposals multiple times to decrease and to wind down the amount of crv that Aave was willing to accept, and it was turned down by the Dow. So it's hard to fault them for that situation, uh, from a unbiased perspective. But I guess there probably was still some negative sentiment about it within some of these larger stakeholders in the Dow. End of the day, you know, operating in Daos is, uh, it's it people in crypto, like, we say we love pain. Like, we love to cause ourselves pain. And, like, you know, those of us that like to go and be active in Daos are kind of a prime example of that, I think.
00:38:43.054 - 00:38:44.994, Speaker A: Are you familiar with chaos labs?
00:38:45.854 - 00:38:46.914, Speaker C: Yeah, of course.
00:38:47.294 - 00:39:21.374, Speaker A: They also, and look, full disclosure, I'm an investor there. But they also became involved over a year ago, I think, and are also managing, created a dashboard. And they also do risk management in a more automated manner, sort of like simulations. Gauntlet, I would describe more as like a consulting firm. Like very, very math heavy, of course, like giga brain guys, but they're more like bespoke in the way they work. Right? They go in, they make proposals. It's very human centric.
00:39:21.374 - 00:39:48.824, Speaker A: Whereas chaos tries to sell more out of the box kind of solutions where it's like constant simulation and ongoing monitoring. But is there something to read here in terms of Ave is going to continue to use chaos? The gauntlet just sort of decide that it was, you know, it's just probably better for them to go out and pursue other things and spend more of their resources in other projects, given the chaos is like, you know, working with Ave closely.
00:39:49.964 - 00:40:27.978, Speaker C: It's an interesting perspective. I would guess that, you know, from some participants in the Dallas perspective, that is the case. You know, we think chaos has been doing better work, so let's only work with chaos. But I do know a few, a lot of the Ave delegates believe that having two risk firms was better than having one. So I think at the end of, I do actually think that this was Gauntlet's decision to leave rather than, you know, aave firing them. As seen, I think they passed the proposal and maybe December, end of last year where they were actually, you know, furthering their engagement with Ave. So, yeah, like, to some extent did chaos come in and kind of eat their lunch? Like, maybe that is the case.
00:40:27.978 - 00:40:39.004, Speaker C: But also I think that probably one loud voice in the Dow, potentially the one you have pulled up right now, kind of just made their operations in Aave such a headache that it wasn't.
00:40:40.264 - 00:40:47.136, Speaker B: What's the, I mean, I'm like, we're avoiding the elephant in the room here, but, like, why? Why is everyone on Twitter being like, mark Zeller? Mark Zeller, like, what's the.
00:40:47.200 - 00:41:04.104, Speaker A: So I saw before, sorry to. I saw a great meme, which is like, gauntlets, bill to Ave consulting, one hundred k at a budget, expenses, ten k, dealing with Mark Zeller, 10 million this.
00:41:04.724 - 00:41:45.554, Speaker C: Yeah, so, like, Mark Zeller runs an initiative called Ave Chan initiative. They're one of the biggest Aave delegates, I think they have close to 50% of, like, the average vote on most proposals in that dow. So a ton of power. You know, at the end of the day, it is a decentralized protocol. It's not like whatever Ave chan wants gets happens, but when there's a single actor with so much power and a dao, it definitely becomes important that you're able to work with them efficiently and effectively. So if there's any animosity there, it's probably going to be a non starter for your future success and ability to have a, you know, happy working life while working with your partner. That is this protocol.
00:41:47.294 - 00:41:48.274, Speaker B: What do you think.
00:41:50.014 - 00:42:09.064, Speaker A: You as an observer and seeing all of this unfold? Like, would you have done anything differently if you were in either Gauntlet or Aaves position? Second, what are your kind of main takeaways for governance in general, management of daos and submitting proposals?
00:42:10.724 - 00:42:52.616, Speaker C: I think from the gauntlet and aave perspective, there probably wouldn't be anything that I did differently. It's difficult. If I was gauntlet, maybe I would have tried to pursue through it. And, like, you know, if I decide Aave is this important part of defi infrastructure that is. That is critical to the future success of our space, maybe I'll try to push through it and continue to, like, assert myself and let it blow over in the long term. But other than that, like, I do think gauntlet has been doing a pretty good job as far as being a risk manager there being Aave, you know, it seems that some of the actors that want to gauntlet gone got what they wanted. So it's hard to speak on behalf of everyone.
00:42:52.616 - 00:43:22.308, Speaker C: Others, for instance, I know, are sad they're leaving. And then as far as governance in general, it's tough. Like, governance is broken, but it starts with the token holder. So, like, the reason governance is broken isn't because of delegates, it's because of the token holder. You know, they go and first of all, only, like, small portions of the actual circulating supply go in and delegate their tokens. For Aave, I think it's one of the highest at, like, 8%. Don't quote me on that, but under 10%.
00:43:22.308 - 00:43:54.696, Speaker C: Um, and then once they delegate, they just forget about it. So it's not like they're holding their delegates accountable. So if they disagree with the decision that's being made, they go and talk to them. Like, that doesn't actually happen in crypto at all. So the problem kind of starts at the token holder level, like, between, you know, delegating and forgetting and then also between and voter apathy. So people who just hold tokens and then don't vote at all. Then like you go a level further and there's problems at the delegate level of misaligned incentives as far as, you know, like Ave Chan gets paid, I don't know, a million dollars a year or something like that for this position.
00:43:54.696 - 00:44:36.704, Speaker C: I'm not actually negatively commenting on that at all. But you know, there's incentives to ingrain yourself in these dials in a way where you continue to have your own incentive rather than just act in the best interest of the protocol. So how do you make that a more fair and efficient process? Like how do you have delegates get paid? At the end of the day, it's almost a full time job, so they should be getting paid. So yeah, across the board. And then you also have this third issue of sophisticated actors and entities don't really care about governance or want to participate in governance. So you look at other aspects of crypto, like Mev ZK, and you have some of the smartest people in the world who are dedicating all of their time to studying these issues. And then you look at this predominant issue we have that no one cares about or wants to pay attention to.
00:44:36.704 - 00:44:42.364, Speaker C: So I guess I would say those are like the three layers that I think about most when I'm thinking about the problems of Dao governance.
00:44:42.904 - 00:45:29.640, Speaker A: Maybe, maybe we should create points for governance and delegates and reward. Like, okay, certain teams have been like airdropping. If you voted, if you've submitted a proposal in these Daos, like, I think it's one of the more underappreciated, like inputs or things that people are doing in crypto. Like there are some very, like Monet supply comes to mind. Like he was just instrumental in maker governance and he didn't have as much MKR, he was constant, but he was super engaged, super active, like on top of it, and just didn't get enough recognition. I think someone like that should probably be more empowered. Unfortunately, Daos are economic Daos, right.
00:45:29.640 - 00:45:57.054, Speaker A: It's based on token weight. And so for the most part, and it's hard, right when you want to pass these proposals, I constantly get pinged that, hey, you know, we need to pass so and so for these defi protocols, do you have tokens or can you help us? Like, no one's really voting and a lot of VC's are not even voting and maybe they're not delegating. And so it's just difficult. It's difficult to do governance, not just in crypto, and crypto is just kind of figuring that out.
00:45:58.234 - 00:46:21.574, Speaker B: Matt, what is it like? What does this make you think about blockworks efforts and governance? And if you overshare, we can take this out or something, but we'd love to hear your candid thoughts about the impact that this has on your strategy with David, uh, at, for blockworks, like, governance side of things.
00:46:22.354 - 00:46:45.706, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think. I don't think there's any, like, fooling ourselves. Operating in governance and Daos is hard. Um, it's a headache. It can be extremely difficult customer to work with. Things can change, you know, drastically, the things that are expected. One thing is like, you know, you create a proposal, there's, you know, KPI's involved, and all of a sudden you want to be working on something different, but you pass the proposal.
00:46:45.706 - 00:47:33.468, Speaker C: There's a lot of difficulties of operating in a dao, but at the end of the day, I think that for crypto to succeed, we need governance to work. If you're invested in crypto, if you're a protocol founder, you need governance to work while your tokens vest, like, otherwise, you're shit out of luck when it comes to your tokens vesting. And all of a sudden, this decentralized community has absolutely wrecked your token price and protocol. So despite it being hard, despite it being, frankly, sometimes even painful, I think it's necessary that blockworks operating daos if we want our space to succeed, I think it's necessary that other sophisticated actors, service providers, entities have the same outlook. Because at the end of the day, that is how we're going to make governance operate more efficiently and effectively and create protocols that are able to truly be decentralized and operate with some merit over long periods.
00:47:33.596 - 00:47:55.004, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny, the lobbying that happens behind the scenes. I got a call yesterday from someone who's applying for the arbitrum. We're applying for the arbitrum research thing. They're applying for the arbitrum security thing. And, yeah, there's. There's a surprising amount of lobbying, I think, that happens behind the scenes that people don't see right now. Basically lobbying for votes.
00:47:55.004 - 00:47:59.004, Speaker B: Cool. Anything else on this, Matt?
00:47:59.704 - 00:48:21.344, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll just say on the lobbying front, it looks like traditional politics. You know, someone hiring their cousin or their nephew or whatever, for position, like lobbying behind closed doors, all that, it's. It's not a new problem. It's, you know, it looks very similar to. To the government of different municipalities. And hopefully we can do a better job in the future.
00:48:21.464 - 00:48:25.804, Speaker B: Do you think there's a lobbying firm that could get created in cryptomatt that would be successful?
00:48:26.184 - 00:48:28.448, Speaker C: 100%. Not even a question.
00:48:28.576 - 00:48:41.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I've been thinking about that, too. I think if there's a founder interested in governance and lobbying and knows how that game works, or even if you don't know how that game works, like, I think that's a. You're ambitious founder, like, you want to get into crypto. I think that's a good company to go start.
00:48:43.692 - 00:48:56.780, Speaker C: Um, yeah, you could with even go a level further. Like, there aren't a whole lot of companies who are DaO service providers who are trying to operate in this industry. Like, no matter what you're starting, if you are, you know, targeting daos as your customer, you might have to face some pain, but it is a largely.
00:48:56.812 - 00:50:00.076, Speaker B: Underserved area of crypto. Hey, everyone, wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santi and I, and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, Wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best, like Uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the Empire listener? This opens up a huge number of multi chain use cases across defi, NFts, governance, oracles and more, by supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including Sui Solana, different ETH, L two s theorem, and a whole bunch more. That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it.
00:50:00.076 - 00:50:20.102, Speaker B: Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time. Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion. And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for Empire listeners.
00:50:20.102 - 00:50:54.506, Speaker B: Hit the link in the description to claim your unique wormhole NFT. Today, the days of not using crypto for really anything in the real world are over. It is time to start using crypto in everyday transactions, whether that's shopping online or just buying a bagel on the street. We're excited to tell you about PY USD PayPal's entrance into web three. PayPal is proud to share an open letter to the crypto community that outlines their commitment, their roadmap, and their goals in the digital currency space. PyuSD seeks to transform how you interact with your digital assets. Available today.
00:50:54.506 - 00:51:27.448, Speaker B: You can send your crypto to your PayPal account, swap it for Python, and then use it to check out at millions of stores. PayPal invites you, all the empire listeners, to be a part of this journey. Hit the link in the description of today's episode to read PayPal's open letter to the community. It gives you a really good sense of what their vision is. Take the next step by signing up for a PayPal account today. The future of crypto payments starts with PayPal. Santi, my good man, you tweeted something.
00:51:27.448 - 00:52:02.566, Speaker B: You said, assume you're bullish. I'll share the screen for anyone watching on the tube. You said, assume you are bullish. Ecosystem X what outperforms? It was l one token, like ETH or Solana or Avax or whatever it is. Sui whatever you want to say, the underlying token, then there's nfts. So if you think ETH does, you're bullish ETH you then like pudgies will outperform or you're bullish Solana mad lads will outperform or apps. Right? If you're bullish, Solana, maybe Jupiter outperforms.
00:52:02.566 - 00:52:23.420, Speaker B: Or if you're bullish ETH, maybe uniswap outperforms. And then there's sea results. So the 33.6% of voters said l one token, 29% said nfts and 22% said apps. And actually, at the time when I voted for this, apps were higher than nfts and nfts were in last place. What are your thoughts? I'd love to. I can't see your vote here.
00:52:23.420 - 00:52:31.024, Speaker B: Um, what do you think? What, like, what's your vote? And I don't know if there are any comments on this post that made you change how you think about things, but would love to get your take.
00:52:31.924 - 00:52:33.904, Speaker A: Oh, definitely. The comments changed my mind.
00:52:35.484 - 00:52:39.144, Speaker B: I hear a grain of sarcasm in that.
00:52:40.044 - 00:53:22.074, Speaker A: Uh, it, uh, I generally think that if you're bullish in ecosystem, I've historically done a levered bet through a combination of that. I think it's like one or the other, but strictly outperforming historically, I think it's been like highly reflexive. Like, nfts have the highest beta. Second to that are apps. And then it's also a difficult exercise because it's, you have to get timing right. The farther out you go on the risk spectrum for nfts, you have to get the timing right. And for apps as well, like Defi, for instance, if you look at DeFi, summer vastly outperformed Ethereum.
00:53:22.074 - 00:53:28.198, Speaker A: But if you compare defi tokens relative to ETH, they've been on a downward spiral and haven't really recovered.
00:53:28.326 - 00:53:28.902, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:29.038 - 00:54:31.086, Speaker A: And so, you know, it depends on the timing and I guess your conviction and your ability to time these things and uh, and how you're implementing the strategy. Like NFTs, I've borrowed against my base stack, so I had a bunch of ETH would borrow a decent amount to buy, you know, punks and other collections, and then with an intentional rotate at some point and like, you know, uh, in retrospect, like that strategy, I wouldn't recommend it to people like it. It has, like, and if these are not only liquid instruments, right. But you know, also when the price of the, like, when ETH ran from 25 to 4000, some of these collections actually don't hold their floor relative to the base asset. So that's also puts you at liquidation risk. But yeah, like the more obvious one. I've privately kind of talked to you about this.
00:54:31.086 - 00:55:08.112, Speaker A: Like, I had this idea of like, I really like the Solana as an ecosystem. I think the NFT ecosystem there is going to have a pretty meaningful growth. There's wealth effect because of airdrops. How do you get exposure to that? Well, Matlad is the number one collection that has run up quite substantially. It's now 20k. Tensorians is one also, which is double kind of whammy. Not only is it a nice collection, top three, I think, but also there's speculation around airdrop and it's a good marketplace.
00:55:08.112 - 00:55:27.012, Speaker A: So you also have exported to the NFT trading. The question is, does it outperform sole? Probably, most likely. I mean, Madlads has outperformed Sol, right. The floor of mad labs on a sole price, you're thinking of it in Sol basis has gone up quite, quite substantially.
00:55:27.068 - 00:55:27.664, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:28.324 - 00:55:29.212, Speaker A: There we go.
00:55:29.348 - 00:55:35.624, Speaker B: Yeah. So November they were worth $2,000. Now they're worth $20,000. So they've gone up ten x.
00:55:36.324 - 00:55:37.428, Speaker A: Ten x, right.
00:55:37.516 - 00:55:38.624, Speaker B: Since November. Yeah.
00:55:39.364 - 00:56:36.806, Speaker A: So yeah, look, I mean, I think just to round it out, it's also, I've had a lot of conversations, actually would love to get your opinions on this, both of yours. Like will infrastructure continue to outperform or will applications like actually like outperform this time as we get more usage depends on the chain depends also on the project. Right. But you know. Yeah, it's long winded answer no. How I'm doing it now, it also depends as a portfolio grows, like I was having discussion with someone and that I really respect and consult with. We're also of the mind that it depends if your portfolio, as it grows, maybe the proportion of base token that you want to hold is different than if various portfolio sizes.
00:56:36.806 - 00:56:42.550, Speaker A: It also factors into how you want to approach this type of strategy.
00:56:42.702 - 00:56:52.340, Speaker B: Well, there's another element to this too, which is this idea of these, these tier one NFT communities getting airdropped tokens in this cycle, which has never existed.
00:56:52.372 - 00:56:54.044, Speaker A: That's very true. Very true. Yeah.
00:56:54.084 - 00:57:08.092, Speaker B: Great. So, um, like pudgies, what's up? What's a pudgy worth right now? 3rd USD. Like, do you think that you. Yeah, there you go. I'm gonna share this tab instead. Here's the price of, here's the price of pudgies. Yeah.
00:57:08.092 - 00:57:11.596, Speaker B: So a pudgy is about 60. 60k. It's 19 and a half.
00:57:11.660 - 00:57:14.216, Speaker A: It was like four ETH in December 3.
00:57:14.360 - 00:57:32.376, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Do you. So 60k is crazy to buy for an NFT. Obviously it's very expensive amount of money for a JPEG. But do you think that you will get airdropped more than 60k worth of value for a pudgy in this entire cycle? Probably. Right.
00:57:32.400 - 00:57:37.712, Speaker A: There were people with teams that are thinking about airdrops and they're thinking budgies came up for sure.
00:57:37.848 - 00:57:53.586, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, there, there are people at blockworks who made 50, 50 plus k from the pudgy, the dim pudgies airdrop alone. Right. And that, that basically buys your pudgy right there. So, Matt, I'd love to get your take on all this. Yeah.
00:57:53.610 - 00:58:30.104, Speaker C: I mean, I don't know if you're going to get 60k out of your, out of your penguin, but you'll definitely get a nice solid portion out of it. Um, would be my guess. Mad lads are another good example. Like you mentioned, they ten x, but you got a couple grand in pith, you got like five grand in dim. Um, you got the, you're about to get the warm hole airdrop, which a lot of people are speculating it's going to be one of the bigger airdrops ever. So definitely we're seeing this narrative of like you hold these blue chip nfts and you get airdrops, especially if you're interacting with the protocol, whether it be like, you know, getting some badge on discord or something of that nature. Um, so, yeah, like, at the end of the day, I don't think you can disagree.
00:58:30.104 - 00:59:00.614, Speaker C: Like, your point, Santi, that, uh, nfts are the highest beta, and then apps, and then ecosystem token. Like, I think it's very hard to disagree with that. I think that's pretty much factual. And then, you know, you add on that layer of, if you have, call it eight figs or more, like, you're probably not able to allocate as well to nfts and maybe not even to apps. And then as you go down that scale and have lower amounts of money, you can play around a little bit more in some of these more liquid, lower, lower volume pairs and nfts. So, yeah, I think it depends on the person.
00:59:01.034 - 00:59:07.154, Speaker A: So my lizard brain is like, I don't think of nfts as investments. This is sort of my philosophy.
00:59:08.174 - 00:59:09.838, Speaker B: Oh, wow. That's an interesting take.
00:59:09.886 - 00:59:13.954, Speaker A: I, like, I I know they are.
00:59:14.574 - 00:59:15.014, Speaker B: Here's.
00:59:15.054 - 00:59:38.768, Speaker A: But I am a collector when I collect things, I I've never sold an NFT. I've only sold one. Yeah, actually, well, two board apes that I got gifted because I never, I never meant it. I got gifted board apes and I sold them. And the second one was also an NfT that I got gifted. And the team that gifted it, to me, it was nifty island thing. Someone from the community wanted to buy this island, and I was like, I'm.
00:59:38.768 - 00:59:45.964, Speaker A: It feels weird to sell something that I got as gift. But they, they were okay. They were like, you should sell it to this guy. I was like, all right, but I don't.
00:59:46.784 - 00:59:47.600, Speaker B: You just become.
00:59:47.672 - 00:59:51.512, Speaker A: There's too much emotional cache to these things. Like, when I collect things, I'm like, I don't want to.
00:59:51.568 - 01:00:03.954, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think there's two different strategies here. Like, let's say you. I don't know. I don't think you end up. You ended up doing that levered bet on soul santi where you're going to lever up and buy some Solana Nft. But, like, that's an investment.
01:00:03.954 - 01:00:05.006, Speaker B: That, right?
01:00:05.030 - 01:00:16.614, Speaker A: You're not sure, in that case, like tensorians. Yeah, like punks, too. Like, I I wanted to collect these things, but I haven't sold them.
01:00:16.734 - 01:00:30.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's two different ways. Like, there's three purchases you can make of an NFT. In my mind. There's sweeping the floor. That's a, that's an investment. There's buying a grail.
01:00:30.780 - 01:00:41.556, Speaker A: But by the way, imagine anyone, like, just jumps into this pod, jumps in minute, whatever, and listens, to this thing. Like, you're sweeping a floor. Like, wait, I think.
01:00:41.740 - 01:01:06.798, Speaker B: Yeah, it's similar. Blockworks just added. We got a new board member, and he was the CEO of Sotheby's and is now on the board of blockworks. Great guy named Tad. And I had lunch with him yesterday, and he was telling me, he's like, do you know the four assets that outperformed the debasement of the dollar over the last 1520 years?
01:01:06.886 - 01:01:08.510, Speaker A: Wine and all this art.
01:01:08.622 - 01:01:31.600, Speaker B: Yeah, but I don't know. It was actually a very interesting conversation about, in an infinite world, what becomes valuable, and it's finite things. And I think are, like, Erc 20. No, but, like, I think that it's no different than buying watches. Right? Like, if you go by. If you go by, let's say, patek, for example, or you go buy something. Like, you either.
01:01:31.600 - 01:01:50.382, Speaker B: You should probably either get the new, like, the almost the cheapest patek so that you can get into the market. You should buy a grail patek. That's really nice. If you think that, like, for. Let's say you're doing it for investing. You're just getting a patek. For the investing purposes, you should either get a grail patek or you should sweep the floor of pateks.
01:01:50.382 - 01:01:54.318, Speaker B: But if you're getting a patek for yourself, like, you should buy the patek.
01:01:54.366 - 01:01:56.558, Speaker A: That you got them patek that you like.
01:01:56.686 - 01:02:09.838, Speaker B: Love. You're gonna buy a college that you will never sell. And I think it's the same for nfTs. So, like, let's say you're gonna go buy a pudgy today. You either sleep, sweep the floor. Let's say you're buying a pudgy for an investment. You either sweep the floor or you buy a grail.
01:02:09.838 - 01:02:17.654, Speaker B: Nothing. Nothing in between. But if you're buying a pudgy to have as your pudgy for the next 20 years, buy, get the pudgy that you love the most.
01:02:18.394 - 01:02:24.930, Speaker A: Hopefully, it's a pudgy that is also a grail, and you can also afford, and it doesn't encompass a big part of your portfolio.
01:02:25.042 - 01:02:25.498, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:25.586 - 01:03:10.016, Speaker A: So that you never have to sell. See, I think there's a lot of the best advice is, I think real estate investors are, like, really good in the sense that, like, the best, you'll hear them say you'll never lose money in real estate if you don't have to sell. And you can just be incredibly patient, and you can afford to also buy when others are in a tight spot. And I think it's generally true. The problem with these NFTs is just people should be, and I'm saying this is common sense, but they can be highly liquid and you can look at. While we are talking about good collections in this current market, zoom out and look at the prior nine months of certain collections. And it doesn't look too pretty for Azuki's.
01:03:10.016 - 01:03:36.762, Speaker A: It's actually like someone had a really good tweet about this this week that I saw. It's like. I think it was actually Mike, it was pluggies. And some of the Solana collections have really performed exceptionally well. Everything else, Suzuki's board, apes and some of the other. Here we go. Was they've haven't had a similar fate.
01:03:36.898 - 01:03:56.838, Speaker B: But not to be like, you know, Monday morning quarterback. But doesn't it kind of feel like an obvious. Like an obvious thing in the sense, like when you were. If you take six months ago, like, the people that you really respect in crypto, the people who are like, deeply crypto native that you think are intelligent. Like, no one's talking about Azuki's, right. Nobody's. Nobody's talking about bored apes.
01:03:56.838 - 01:03:58.714, Speaker B: You know, it was.
01:04:01.054 - 01:04:15.886, Speaker A: Disagree. Yeah, look, some people had a zookeeze. I think they really. They actually kind of screwed it up with the second collection that they launched was like a total botch. I think it was one of those things that they could have control. They just. Aboard apes, for instance.
01:04:15.886 - 01:04:18.886, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right. I mean, I think bored apes, just different categories just to respect.
01:04:18.950 - 01:04:32.124, Speaker B: I think what's. What's ripping in nfts right now, the collections that deeply crypto native people respect. It's the same reason why bad kids are ripping. Right? Um, and yeah, bad kids are like the.
01:04:32.744 - 01:04:38.504, Speaker A: I would say bad kids is to cosmos. What Matt, let's. Is to Solana crypto puncture theory.
01:04:38.624 - 01:04:39.284, Speaker B: Right.
01:04:40.024 - 01:05:02.644, Speaker C: Matt, you could go a step, step further with the pudgies, too. Like, their brand outside of crypto has become really well respected. Like, my girlfriend randomly gets their Instagram reels that have 10 million views on them. They're selling pudgies in Walmart. Like, they've achieved this different level of brand that I'm not sure really. Any other company in crypto has succeeded in. Like, maybe Coinbase.
01:05:04.544 - 01:05:19.812, Speaker A: Raised all this money. Didn't do. By the way, there's also something to talk about here. Yugalabs is interesting developments in terms of kind of what they've done recently. But, like, pudgies did what Yuga tried to do with a fraction of the budget which is incredibly impressive, right?
01:05:19.868 - 01:05:37.024, Speaker B: Yeah, look at this, 1.3 million followers on Instagram. This one's crazy. They have almost 15 billion giphy views, or Jif, whatever you pronounce it. That's cool. Matt, if you had, I'm going to make up a number here. If you had one hundred k and you wanted and you were super bullish.
01:05:37.024 - 01:05:57.394, Speaker B: I'm trying not to pick on anyone. Let's say you're super bullish. Ethereum. You're like giga long. Ethereum, whatever. Are you buying ETH spot? Are you levering up and buying ETH or are you, um. Or are you buying like some ETH collection? We'll use pudges here because it's been ripping.
01:05:57.814 - 01:06:20.132, Speaker C: I'm probably long roll ups. So like nothing on Ethereum or Ethereum. I'm probably long like op. Arb, um, probably mostly op and just sitting on it for like depending on the timeframe. But for a six month timeframe, call it twelve month timeframe. Like I think that that's how I would get my beta exposure to Ethereum, through l two s specifically. Maybe op, but I think pudgies are a good bet.
01:06:20.132 - 01:06:54.354, Speaker C: You know, if you're talking about one hundred k and you're spending 60 of it on an NFT, that's, it's a very large portion to be in one item especially. But like I don't think you can go wrong there. But yeah, like at the end of the day, if I'm bullish in ecosystem, like I'm going for beta, like I'm probably not longing the ecosystem token, I'm sure I'll have a good amount of it, but on a shorter timeframe, like something that I'm not holding for the rest of my life, something that I'm planning on selling in six months, twelve months, whatever. Like I'm definitely, you know, looking for, for more beta, whether it be through NFTs or through roll ups slash apps, doesn't matter. But yeah, for ethereum specifically, definitely roll ups.
01:06:54.774 - 01:07:40.126, Speaker A: The long l two is a one I've heard from multiple people. And in terms of the ratio of, like, if you believe in Ethereum, well, like some, like arb arbitrum, like the ratio of how an l two should trade relative to an l one probably grows is an opinion that I've heard from some folks and I generally agree with that. And I'm biased, of course, because that's how I actually express my exposure to Ethereum. I certainly have ETH, but by virtue of investments in l two s and other middleware infrastructure is how I generally think. It's not too far out on the risk spectrum. You'd certainly have to be opinionated on a particular l two. You could have a basket of them.
01:07:40.126 - 01:08:12.204, Speaker A: But as a whole, I think, like, if Ethereum does well, l two s do better. I think as a basket, they just have to, because, you know, and. Or, like, with Eigen in the mix, like, feel like, you know, Eigen is like the saving grace for Ethereum in many ways. Like, especially this cycle with like liquid restaking and abs and all that stuff. Like, it doesn't. If Eigen doesn't work, then I'm more bearish on ETH. So if you're.
01:08:12.204 - 01:09:20.654, Speaker A: And so by virtue of that, I think you want to have exposure to the thing that's pulling ETH this cycle, which I think is, I mean, you can talk about an ETF, but it's. Eigenplays a big NLT, play roll ups play a huge part in that. So I'm just thinking of the catalyst it would drive the l to, in the same way that, like, Defi was a big drive of Ethereum and interest in Ethereum as like the first killer use case back then. But it feels like Defi, you kind of had to, was a little bit less sustainable in terms of the whole yield farming kind of wave, whereas the l two s are like far more sustainable, I think, because they'll see the more usage they'll. And I think that's probably a better, like, I would feel more comfortable this cycle holding some, like an l two token for longer and maybe not even rotate back to ETH. I mean, I think you always. I mean, I think if it's a growing to eat stack at some point, like you want to think in ETH terms, but I would feel more comfortable holding longer term l two token or something like Eigen versus a random, like, defi project.
01:09:21.754 - 01:09:25.506, Speaker C: What's the over under on Eigenfd at launch?
01:09:25.690 - 01:09:26.414, Speaker A: 30.
01:09:27.034 - 01:09:28.964, Speaker B: I said 30. Yeah.
01:09:29.074 - 01:09:30.128, Speaker A: Three handle, baby.
01:09:30.216 - 01:09:32.284, Speaker B: Yeah. I said today.
01:09:33.944 - 01:09:38.336, Speaker A: How long it stays there. Probably longer than starkware.
01:09:38.440 - 01:09:40.216, Speaker B: June. Vest in. I can.
01:09:40.400 - 01:09:41.920, Speaker A: I passed in the 1 billion round.
01:09:41.992 - 01:09:42.440, Speaker B: I passed.
01:09:42.472 - 01:09:43.136, Speaker A: And that is.
01:09:43.240 - 01:09:44.124, Speaker B: Let's go.
01:09:45.264 - 01:09:46.744, Speaker A: That was last year.
01:09:46.864 - 01:09:48.884, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. With Calvin.
01:09:49.184 - 01:09:50.600, Speaker A: Just when we had them on the podium.
01:09:50.672 - 01:09:53.512, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Crazy.
01:09:53.568 - 01:09:54.828, Speaker A: I can't catch them all.
01:09:55.016 - 01:10:19.388, Speaker B: Can't catch them all. Matt, do you. Or actually both of you guys, when you are long, something like, let's say. Okay, so, Matt, you think that this l two trade is going to work out? Will you just go kind of spread across like, your two or three favorite l. Two s. Or will you. Will you pick one? Like, or let's say it's next gen blockchains, like, or whatever you want to call this bucket of, like, sui, and move, like, are you just like, I don't know.
01:10:19.388 - 01:10:24.144, Speaker B: I've got a grand, but 500 in sui, 500 aptis. Are you picking one or.
01:10:24.264 - 01:10:57.144, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I'm picking one. I mean, I spend 24/7 in crypto. I'm supposed to have opinions on what's better tech, what's more in the narrative. So, like, diversification amongst the basket isn't really something I'm interested in. Um, I think that I have the ability to, like, pick, and I'm wrong a lot, but, like, I have the ability to, with a thesis, go in and say, I think that this one's the one that's going to outperform. Um, and then, you know, sometimes I'm wrong, but at the end of the day, as long as I went in with the thesis, and if the thesis is proved incorrect and I, and I close out that position, when that happens, it's still a win in my book.
01:10:57.444 - 01:11:10.572, Speaker B: Blockworksresearch.com. There's your plug. Go get a sub, folks. Prices go up March 18. Um, yeah, yuga labs. Interesting stuff this week. So they, uh, they both acquired moonbirds.
01:11:10.572 - 01:11:22.454, Speaker B: Is that the name proof? Moon birds. Um, Santa, you're muted. So moon. Moon birds. And then they let their, um, they let their CEO, Daniel go and one of their co founders step back in. Any. Any thoughts on this, Santa? Any thoughts?
01:11:23.154 - 01:11:34.298, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Kevin rose thing. I don't know what Yuga's endgame is at this point, Mike, and get the.
01:11:34.386 - 01:11:38.214, Speaker B: Get the balance sheet of moon and launch a token for it.
01:11:41.474 - 01:11:50.834, Speaker A: I think there's a lesson in there of, like, raising too much money in theory. Sounds nice. In practice, I think. Makes you do dumb shit.
01:11:53.974 - 01:12:07.674, Speaker C: I think they have one more shot. You know, other side. If it actually is a really cool game world ecosystem, then, you know, you get, actually still has a chance at coming back in the narrative. But I think that's kind of their final shot.
01:12:07.974 - 01:12:26.494, Speaker A: Look, I hope it works. There's just too many people that would probably be affected if it doesn't. And you never want to see a. You remember, like, the. The company I'm thinking of in web two is magic leap. You remember them?
01:12:26.914 - 01:12:28.506, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:12:28.530 - 01:12:53.786, Speaker A: The virtual kind of still around, but they're all hyper. There is a ton of money. They consistently raise a bunch of money, but they haven't delivered and then, you know, just a lot of money that got burned. Yeah, but, like, pudgies, I saw. Just bringing back the pudgies. Pudgies kids. I mean, I don't know how far they are, but the video that they shared, it was, like, in December, right, of, like, the world that they wanted game.
01:12:53.890 - 01:12:56.706, Speaker B: I mean, they're doing this with, like, they only raise, like, a million bucks.
01:12:56.770 - 01:12:57.514, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.
01:12:57.594 - 01:12:57.970, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:58.042 - 01:13:28.774, Speaker A: Like, I'm struggling to understand how you guys, like, you can't. I guess I've heard it from many founders is constant. Like, there's a popular phrase among, like, builders, which is, you throwing ten more engineers at a problem is not necessarily going to solve the problem. And sometimes, like, yes, you need more resources to hire more people. But I've seen time and time again, many teams like, it bloated, you know, hire BD marketing, do all these things. I'm like.
01:13:29.634 - 01:13:30.186, Speaker B: Like.
01:13:30.290 - 01:13:56.566, Speaker A: Whereas I've seen. I heard it from Seb, from Zapper. He's like, our best engineer has ten x the amount of output than, like, some of the other engineers. So go find that ten x engineer. And I don't know, maybe Pudgy's just been lucky, but those guys just seem to ship. But, hey, I don't have a full insight into what's going on Yuga. Maybe they'll, you know, blow our minds, you know, with what they're doing, and they just haven't released it.
01:13:56.566 - 01:14:08.852, Speaker A: So I want to be cautious and, you know, caveat everything that I'm saying. Just that I don't have, like, insight. But it sounds like there's more going on with budgies for a fraction of what yuga and the resources that they have. So maybe there's something in that.
01:14:08.948 - 01:14:23.264, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, blockworks bootstrap for the first five years. Right? Yeah. It makes you more. More money, more problems. Right. And it, like, when startups raise too much money, I think they basically lose their core focus and, like, never really understand what their.
01:14:23.264 - 01:14:30.348, Speaker B: Who their user is and what their product, how their product is differentiated in the market. Well, yeah, throw money.
01:14:30.396 - 01:14:38.674, Speaker A: It's a good transition. Because we want to talk about airdrops, and I want to ask you a question, or both of you guys, do you think that most teams in crypto understand who their customer is?
01:14:40.814 - 01:14:44.154, Speaker B: You told me that was a bad question when I asked Keone that yesterday.
01:14:47.054 - 01:14:49.834, Speaker A: Okay, now wait a minute. So you share in private.
01:14:50.774 - 01:14:54.214, Speaker B: What's that? Kosher, man. All right, all right. Not Kosh. Not Kosh.
01:14:54.334 - 01:14:56.014, Speaker A: I mean, in that context.
01:14:56.054 - 01:15:02.084, Speaker B: It was like, just ragged on myself. I asked a question yesterday to Keone, and Sandy goes, bad question.
01:15:02.544 - 01:15:07.256, Speaker A: You said, who's your customer? Devs or users? For an l one, I think it was like a Mac kind of question.
01:15:07.440 - 01:15:21.072, Speaker B: I'm more thinking of like, dapps, an l one. Your customer is a dev, an app. Your customer is a user. That's my, like, think. Okay, take crypto out of it. Who for? Think of it. Think of like, aws.
01:15:21.072 - 01:15:26.552, Speaker B: Like, who's the customer of Aws? Squarespace. Who's the customer of Squarespace? A user. Yeah.
01:15:26.568 - 01:15:40.554, Speaker A: You know, I can understand. Let's go back to the question that I asked. Do you think the projects really understand their customer? And does it the, does an airdrop introduce noise? Because a lot of this is just incentivized.
01:15:41.214 - 01:16:23.708, Speaker B: There's two. There's like, it depends what you're trying to optimize for, though. The Airdrop. An airdrop is a marketing expense, right, for a company, but it's a marketing expense to serve what purpose? I think a lot of people think about a marketing expense as a way to just pull users in, just like as a way to pull people into your product. But so far, historically, in crypto, the best way to pull someone into your product is, and to get someone into your ecosystem is number go up technology. It has nothing to do with your, usually in web two land, you're marketing your technology, and then that pulls people into your product. In crypto land, it's number go up.
01:16:23.708 - 01:16:36.704, Speaker B: Technology then pulls people in. So, like, the customer of an airdrop could be the traders, which causes number go up, which then causes developers to build. Does that make sense?
01:16:37.644 - 01:17:31.424, Speaker C: I feel like it's not just a marketing expense. It's also got this component of an attempt at regulatory arbitrage as far as, like, truly decentralizing ownership of your protocol. When I think of customer in crypto, it's a little weird, because I think the only way that a crypto protocol really gets a brand moat and stay power is through proprietary order flow. So transactions that are being routed to this protocol through a user interface or something of that nature, I don't think airdrops really help you get proprietary order flow or exclusive order flow. So at the end of the day, I don't think that those two things are super connected. And no, I definitely don't think most protocols know who's using their application. But I think it'd be very difficult to get a good sense.
01:17:31.424 - 01:17:44.504, Speaker C: We have a sense of what kind of users on crypto, Twitter but we don't have a sense of who's doing all of the stable coin transfers on Tron, and we don't have a sense of, or at least I don't, of a lot of different aspects of who crypto users really are.
01:17:46.484 - 01:18:28.868, Speaker A: Yeah, sort of a necessary thing. I think, um, airdrops are going to continue to happen. I think teams, it's sort of a table stakes, but, um, perhaps what would be wise is to not. Not give out air, all the entire airdrop allocation at once, and reserve a lot of it down the road to be opportunistic, strategic, because you get to understand the customer better. Like simple things like Jupiter, right? Uh, or blur. Like, you have a certain round as you go, right? You want to sustain trading activity and interest. Like, you have a constant drip of airdrops to keep up the KPI's that you're optimizing for, whereas other teams just kind of give out all the airdrop at once.
01:18:28.868 - 01:18:33.744, Speaker A: And I think it's not probably wise to do that.
01:18:37.164 - 01:19:10.904, Speaker C: I feel like it hasn't worked so well. I'm thinking of Vertex as a good example of a protocol who had different epochs and rounds of giving out their token, and the second it turns off, all of a sudden, at least a large portion of volume leaves and they successfully incentivized a significant group of traders to then have some brand loyalty and use their UI, use their UX, use their protocol. But I'm not even sure that that has proven to be a worthwhile endeavor as far as the amount of money that these protocols are giving out versus the number of users that they're onboarding.
01:19:12.504 - 01:19:18.044, Speaker A: Well, that's the other thing. So veer vertex, do just. What's the answer? Not even introduce an airdrop?
01:19:21.144 - 01:19:27.524, Speaker C: I think the airdrop was a good idea. Like, it. It did bring some users. It was just an expensive way of bringing some users.
01:19:29.784 - 01:19:31.124, Speaker B: What do you think, Sanjay?
01:19:32.304 - 01:20:02.320, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, it's a difficult. You can't make generalizations, right? I mean, you could look at uni and it was forced its hand because sushi tried a vampire attack it, but uni became uni at a different time. I mean, there was just a lot of these things. Now everyone expects a token and points, and so it's like, all right, well, I think it is difficult. Like you were talking about Athena. Like, are people expecting a token? Most likely there have been projects that have gotten away by just saying, hint, hint, win, wink.
01:20:02.320 - 01:20:43.454, Speaker A: There's a token coming at some point, but, you know, two years in they haven't released a token. I don't know, man. Think it's. A lot of these discussions are difficult because we have, like, 100,000 users on chain less. If you believe that, like, we're gonna get the millions of users, like, I don't know, just build a good product and have points and maybe build loyalty. I don't know, like, like something like vertex, like, if you're a perp protocol, if you allow people to do swaps, have meaningful utility, then I don't think you need an airdrop. I don't think you should rush it.
01:20:43.454 - 01:21:26.806, Speaker A: If you feel that you're being out competed by someone that has an airdrop, it's tricky. Ultimately, sushi didn't deliver on the product as much as uni has. And so now you can look at both tokens and that's very clear reflection the market's telling you. It's like, the market is like a voting machine in the near term, waiting machine in the long term. I tend to think the really good teams that are excellent product builders should have conviction in the product that they're building, that it's just vastly superior and they can copy that on the margin. It is open source, whatever. But I wouldn't rush into an airdrop or a token, even in this market.
01:21:26.806 - 01:21:30.924, Speaker A: And I appreciate everyone's thinking now because, you know, prices are up and it's a good time to launch.
01:21:35.184 - 01:21:40.784, Speaker B: I wonder if. What, what's the Ben Graham quotes onto that? You just said? Short run, the market's a voting machine.
01:21:40.824 - 01:21:46.096, Speaker A: The market's a voting machine on the near term, it's a weighing machine in the long term. So you want to be a really heavy product.
01:21:46.200 - 01:22:09.378, Speaker B: Does this weird thing. The thought there, I think, is, like, short term, it's basically just based on, like, what people like, long term, it's based on, like, the value that accrues to something in the cash flow that it spits off. But in crypto, crypto almost like, extends the time horizon for the voting machine component because of culture and cults. I would say, like, the bitcoin is.
01:22:09.386 - 01:22:10.614, Speaker A: The ultimate meme coin.
01:22:10.914 - 01:22:27.114, Speaker B: Yeah, like, memes. And, like, adding culture into the market and adding, like, cults into brands basically extends the time horizon for something to be a. For the market to be a voting machine as opposed to a. A weighing machine. I don't know. It's just an interesting idea.
01:22:27.934 - 01:22:35.742, Speaker A: Markets stop being very rational. Not just in crypto. Long time ago, like, really long time ago, there was.
01:22:35.838 - 01:22:45.314, Speaker B: There was this good chart I saw about, like, we are moving to a dopamine economy. It made me think of, I'll try to find it.
01:22:45.814 - 01:22:54.768, Speaker A: No one's thinking about like what Jay pal is doing. Everyone's looking at Nvidia earnings if the market's gonna be sustained, you know, it's so nice.
01:22:54.896 - 01:23:25.330, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, this is it. Here, let me show you that we can wrap on this. Everything has moved their slow traditional culture to fast modern culture to dopamine culture used to be play sport, then it moved to watch a sport, then moved to gamble on a sport. Newspaper went from newspapers to multimedia to clickbait. Went from film and tv to video to TikTok. Went from albums to tracks to TikTok went from views on a gallery wall to viewing on a phone to scrolling on a phone, handwritten letters to voice email, memo to short texts, courtship and marriage to sexual freedom to swipe on an app.
01:23:25.330 - 01:23:41.658, Speaker B: And the category thats missing from this is markets. And I think markets have moved from, actually if you look at markets a long time ago is dividends. You didnt really buy a stock for a number go up, you bought it for the dividend. You look at the dividends, you bought.
01:23:41.706 - 01:23:43.610, Speaker A: It go up to. Come on, man.
01:23:43.722 - 01:23:44.682, Speaker B: No, I mean if you look at.
01:23:44.698 - 01:23:49.826, Speaker A: Like who would have fucking bought it? Stock wanted to go up like you.
01:23:49.890 - 01:24:00.574, Speaker B: Did, you became what if you wanted to be a shareholder in Carnegie or like in the Gilded Age, like 1870s, like Carnegie, Rockefeller and stuff. Like there wasn't really a necessarily a stock market.
01:24:00.914 - 01:24:52.230, Speaker A: But you look at the railroad mania, dude, the tulip mania. Like animal spirits have been around for a while, man. It's just, no, of course every, every industry starts, markets are markets. The problem is most people over intellectualized markets, they're highly psychological. Investing is not like a, it is a mathematical financial thing, but it's ultimately, if you don't understand psychology, good luck. Like seriously, good luck and present value is all you need to know about like you know, how things should trade and building greater margin of safety, but you're still speculating. Like it's still, can other people understand? You know, and you know, sometimes, you know also the old end of this, the other keys, what is it? Great quote, which is the market could stay irrational longer that you can stay solvent and so that's why you never want to short in crypto.
01:24:52.342 - 01:24:53.034, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:24:55.894 - 01:25:19.544, Speaker C: I think the argument now is that it's not that there wasn't always people who wanted to get rich quick. It's that now that's the norm. Like you know, whether that dopamine culture has led to a society where everyone is in the same boat of, I will never be able to afford a house. I will never be able to unless I get rich quick. So I feel like the dopamine culture as it relates to investing is kind of like a valid progression.
01:25:20.884 - 01:25:30.100, Speaker B: It's also the age at which people participate in the markets has gone down. Right. Old markets used to be stale, pale male, like, old white dudes, basically, who had.
01:25:30.132 - 01:25:30.774, Speaker A: Pale male.
01:25:30.884 - 01:25:55.650, Speaker B: Yeah, stale, pale male, old white dudes on Wall street. And then it became the old, like, maybe moms and dads who in the nineties, when you had, like, e brokerages like TD Ameritrade and stuff like that, came online. And now anyone with a smartphone can become. Can become an investor. And as you go down in age, you also. And you get more digital, you get more dopamine obsessed. And, you know, you talk to an 18 year old, they're not interested in 8% a year.
01:25:55.650 - 01:25:57.590, Speaker B: Right. So.
01:25:57.662 - 01:26:04.234, Speaker A: Well, with that, folks, I got to drop. I'm late for a call. All right, boys, great chat. Thanks for joining us.
01:26:04.774 - 01:26:05.830, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having me.
