00:00:00.200 - 00:00:20.598, Speaker A: There were a lot of people who were like, too little, too late, whatever. No, not in the slightest. And Hayden had the best take. He said that the too little, too late. This is pandering crowd is missing the point. Dem establishment has finally realized that being anti crypto by letting Warren run financial policy will lose them elections. This is a big deal.
00:00:20.598 - 00:00:51.266, Speaker A: Nothing politicians care about more than winning elections. Welcome to the new era. Yeah, couldn't have said it better myself.

00:02:25.484 - 00:02:27.892, Speaker B: Yada's making me wake up early, so.
00:02:28.068 - 00:02:31.692, Speaker A: Me, I would love to push this thing back.
00:02:31.828 - 00:02:32.852, Speaker B: I know, right?
00:02:32.988 - 00:02:36.824, Speaker A: I've been taking my morning walk. Haven't seen my sunshine today.
00:02:38.004 - 00:03:02.764, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Well, here we are. There's a lot to cover before. Before we hit the record button, Janice said something that is going to be probably the center of this episode. He said that he felt the last week had been the most important in crypto from an institutional standpoint, and I tend to believe it. So why don't we just start there?
00:03:02.844 - 00:03:25.910, Speaker A: Yeah, let's start there. So you bailed on us last week, so we should start with the YouTube comments, actually. But after we came out and said that we're reading the YouTube comments, they were the kindest YouTube comments I've ever seen, actually. We'll take the love, but we do need, like, one or two jabs every week to make this a funny section. So just. Just calling that out. Also, before we get.
00:03:25.910 - 00:03:30.674, Speaker A: Before we actually get into the episode. Dude, you missed the Monaco. You missed the grand Prix, huh?
00:03:31.574 - 00:03:54.294, Speaker B: Yes. It's very loud. If you remember last year, we recorded, you could hear the cars in the background, and they're practicing Thursday, Friday. So I decided to leave this year and spend it elsewhere and was actually in Miami meeting with. Feels like everyone's in Miami. I mean, I was in New York, as you recall, with. With you guys.
00:03:54.294 - 00:04:08.294, Speaker B: We did the event, and Miami, you have frictionless guys. You had Casey was turning topology. You have a bunch of people there. And so I had a really good set of meetings. Felt like Miami's changed a lot. Become an important crypto center. So what.
00:04:08.334 - 00:04:15.794, Speaker A: What are you doing when you go meet with people? Are you deciding if you should, like, allocate capital, or are you just learning? Or. What are you. What are you doing?
00:04:16.134 - 00:04:17.294, Speaker B: I'm observing.
00:04:17.454 - 00:04:34.794, Speaker A: Observing? No, let's say, like, when I go to San Francisco or something, like, I'll go meet with, I don't know, some of the, like, protocol, like some of the big, like, c five founders or protocol founders, and we're trying to work out something between them and blockworks. Like, it's. So I'm just curious, like, what are you. What are you actually doing?
00:04:35.094 - 00:05:11.568, Speaker B: In this case? I've already. I'm already an investor in these funds and just wanted to catch up. I generally think it's highly inefficient to travel. Like, business travel is very inefficient in my mind, but in this particular case, it was. Sometimes it's just good to spend time, and I feel like if you go to New York, if you go to Miami or San Francisco, the benefit of those cities, or even London is there's just high concentration of people you can cover in three days. Just sees many, many people. So.
00:05:11.696 - 00:05:12.432, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:12.608 - 00:05:18.040, Speaker B: And I'm not gonna lie, I haven't really kind of left the hotel.
00:05:18.112 - 00:05:32.768, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Santi text me, or tells me on a call yesterday, the day before, he's like, miami's awesome. It's great. Love this city. I think I got to drop my biases about the city being a party city. Like, oh, what have you been doing? He's like, yeah, I haven't really left my hotel yet, but it is great.
00:05:32.896 - 00:05:43.100, Speaker B: I have left, though, but I'm here with, I was here with family too. And so anyways, it was good.
00:05:43.252 - 00:05:52.964, Speaker A: By the way, apologies for anyone listening. If my audio is crap, I've been booted out of my office, my home office, because apparently we are wallpapering today.
00:05:53.124 - 00:06:11.534, Speaker B: So wallpaper is good. I like, I like wallpaper. You know, the wallpaper I have back home that it's like fake books. And I was like, why don't you just get real books? I'm like, I do. I'm not just gonna show you my personal collection of stuff in the back, necessarily, although I have considered shifting the orientation.
00:06:11.994 - 00:06:20.234, Speaker A: Your personal collection, do you have any, like, you. You don't have a like mine comp sitting back there like, you got a book, you can't book, you can't share something?
00:06:20.394 - 00:06:24.282, Speaker B: No, no. I mean you. Pictures and stuff. Yeah, I can do it.
00:06:24.378 - 00:06:25.010, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:25.162 - 00:06:28.896, Speaker B: Speaking of, I bought another Harry Potter stuff.
00:06:29.090 - 00:06:30.540, Speaker A: You got it. Let's go.
00:06:30.612 - 00:06:35.012, Speaker B: Not that one. That. That is going up for bid in three weeks.
00:06:35.188 - 00:06:35.844, Speaker A: Considered.
00:06:35.884 - 00:06:41.196, Speaker B: I considered preempting it, but you know, auction people being auction people.
00:06:41.340 - 00:06:42.584, Speaker A: Yeah. What'd you get?
00:06:43.284 - 00:07:04.004, Speaker B: I had one of these. Well, similar to that front cover illustration, the artist, I think it's Taylor. It's the only, the only sec, like the only second illustration that's out there that he gifted to a really good friend. And it's like a part of the initial print. So it was like a teaser. It was the appetizer.
00:07:05.344 - 00:07:06.644, Speaker A: What'd you pay?
00:07:08.504 - 00:07:15.644, Speaker B: What a reasonably, I paid similar to a top tier NFT collection in Solana.
00:07:16.584 - 00:07:17.776, Speaker A: It's a good way to describe it.
00:07:17.800 - 00:07:22.204, Speaker B: But like, what I paid what Matlad's probably what the base of a Matlabs cost.
00:07:23.064 - 00:08:18.228, Speaker A: Sir, do you take mad lads for this? We had a really good episode that we recorded this week with Armani from Mad lads and backpack, the wallet and backpack, the exchange and the protocol that he built that. I forget the name of it. Very impressed. So really good episode that drops soon. We didn't talk about this because Quinn was on last week instead of you, but what did you think of the punks? So punks came out last week or the week, I think it was last week and announced that they had built these kind of like 3d. They built this thing called Superpunk World, which is, like, a 500 piece collection, and they're essentially these, like, what they call, like, hybrid 3d sculptures that, in their words, blur the lines of race and gender and reflect upon virtual versus real world identities. It felt like a very 2021, 2022 type of thing to do.
00:08:18.228 - 00:08:27.536, Speaker A: I'd say people really kind of blasted them for it. Probably a little bit of an overaction just because people love to blast, like, the woke stuff these days. But what did you think about it as a big punk?
00:08:27.560 - 00:08:30.808, Speaker B: Holder, what you just said?
00:08:30.976 - 00:08:35.992, Speaker A: Okay, is it. What do you think? It was bad enough to reconsider your.
00:08:36.048 - 00:09:05.074, Speaker B: No, like, I mean, I would be lying if I didn't tell you. I have reconsidered holding punks in the way that I do. I said, we'll always keep the one that I have. 9159. Some of the others, could I let them go? I'm not, like, as I said, I don't. I've come in the pod saying that I don't necessarily, like. Collecting and investing is two different sports for me.
00:09:05.074 - 00:09:34.260, Speaker B: When I went in and bought these or minted these punks, I didn't necessarily think that they were, like, an investment, but, you know, I'm always open to reconsidering. And could there be more productive uses of capital, maybe? Like, would I sell one or two punks to buy this Harry Potter thing that's going up for auction? The estimate is 400 to 600k. Yeah, I saw one or two punks or whatever.
00:09:34.372 - 00:09:35.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:36.164 - 00:09:41.756, Speaker B: Like, on that basis, like, I know what I like more, and you know the answer to that.
00:09:41.860 - 00:09:42.544, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:42.924 - 00:09:51.284, Speaker B: Like, one is a one on one, and it just speaks to me in a way that maybe, like, yeah, other punks, like, don't.
00:09:51.444 - 00:10:19.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw some different punk holders on Twitter. So Jonah, who hosts Salz next? One of the other pods is a punk. Holder said, this makes me want to delete Twitter, sell all my crypto, put on a suit, and become a junior corporate bond trader. FubaR said, all right, I have my. Actually have to sell my punk if they're acting this ridiculous. Posted a picture to, uh, you remember flat Stanley, the, like, cartoon flat Stanley? I don't know, read those child books. But, like, you didn't read this.
00:10:19.170 - 00:10:20.562, Speaker A: Here, hold on. Let me show you this.
00:10:20.618 - 00:10:21.186, Speaker B: Let me see this.
00:10:21.210 - 00:10:29.454, Speaker A: Oh, I probably did, but I just, uh. This is a picture of the flat stairs. And then if you compare it to, like, what they look like.
00:10:31.834 - 00:10:54.758, Speaker B: I mean, it. Can we go back down memory lane? Like, me bits was not, as was actually favorably, like, it was well received by most in the community. Right. Because you were. If you were a punk holder, you received me bits. They actually look more animated. And, um, I actually sold my me bits.
00:10:54.758 - 00:10:57.062, Speaker B: Or did I? I think.
00:10:57.078 - 00:11:04.228, Speaker A: I think I may have mint, I'm pretty sure. And then I don't know what happened to my me bits. I forget what I did with that.
00:11:04.366 - 00:11:20.872, Speaker B: But, like, no one ever talks about me bits anymore. In the same way that most people don't talk about sequels or, you know, the. There is a. You could argue there is a dilutive effect to, like. All right, let me ask you a question. You like Star wars?
00:11:21.008 - 00:11:21.848, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:11:22.016 - 00:11:24.004, Speaker B: Okay. What do you think about the Mandalorian?
00:11:26.224 - 00:11:27.524, Speaker A: Not a huge fan.
00:11:28.584 - 00:11:31.434, Speaker B: Maybe you liked it first season, but, like, no one's talking about it.
00:11:31.544 - 00:11:34.590, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. There are good memes.
00:11:34.622 - 00:12:10.174, Speaker B: Like, this is the way. And, you know, the small yoda, like, the baby Yoda is really cute. But absent that, people think about Star wars and you think about, you know, the empire strikes back. Yeah, turn of the Jedi. Like, there is something very pristine about that. And look, in a similar analogy, Disney bought the, you know, bought it from, what is it, Lucas Entertainment. And you sort of knew that they were going to try to squeeze more dollars out of it because they needed to recoup the investment.
00:12:10.174 - 00:12:37.854, Speaker B: Maybe that's sort of like, the intention here. Like, it's. We've recorded these podcasts when Yuga acquired punks, and I think they've done some good things, including, most importantly, the IP stuff, which they become more. They address it head on. I think folks like G money were really kind of pushing around, hey, what can I do with this? Like, I have a punk, a very well known punk. I want to build my identity. Like, let's talk about IP.
00:12:37.854 - 00:13:17.654, Speaker B: So I think Yuga has done good steps on that front. Launching more collections like this, I don't think is going to add, and let's put it this way, it has felt that most people didn't like him. Most people wouldn't buy them if it weren't remotely attached to, like, the punk name. And maybe that, you know, has some sort of appeal, but on. On their own, like, you wouldn't buy it, right. So, like, the question to you is, like, if you're Yuga and you're there, what do you do? If I'm in their position, I would just, like, try to create, like, something very unique that speaks to the current time of crypto.
00:13:18.224 - 00:13:19.512, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a versus.
00:13:19.568 - 00:13:23.480, Speaker B: This just feels like a derivative of me bits.
00:13:23.512 - 00:13:46.424, Speaker A: Oh, yuga labs, right? Like people might. So Yuga started with bored ape and they've been acquiring all these, they've essentially been trying to build an ip portfolio. So they've got me bit. They acquired me bits and crypto punks from larva Labs in March of 22. They've got the Metaverse game other side, they've got the art series twelve fold. They've got ten KTF. They've got, they just acquired moonbirds, I think it was.
00:13:46.424 - 00:14:24.454, Speaker A: Yeah, the proof collective. The problem with Yuga in my mind has always been that they are focused on this like kind of like the crowd that I think came into crypto at the pico top of the last cycle. It's this like web3 interested in like the Metaverse. Like it's this. I'm trying to, I can't really put my finger on like the specific crowd, but it's like, have you ever seen the parties of the videos of the board? Ape yacht club parties? There's like a bunch of dudes like dancing like this. Like that's, that's the audience of yuga labs in my mind.
00:14:24.834 - 00:14:27.074, Speaker B: Miami Vice or it's people who like.
00:14:27.114 - 00:15:01.294, Speaker A: Work at, I don't know, Reebok and Adidas and Budweiser and like nothing against them but like they're into like the web3. They're not really into like crypto. And historically talking to that crowd has been a losing game and trying to, and so I think that's what you good did here is like they're appealing to that crowd. They're not appealing to the, to the crowd where like their real customers are. If you think about the like punks, like I've been to like David Hoffman's house in Brooklyn. Like that dude's got a massive, literally punk thing hung up on his wall. Like you've got like a punk as your PFT and you've got them for like your fam.
00:15:02.234 - 00:15:10.128, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Know, yeah, it's uh, you know, people that don't protect Philippe so necessary to collect uh, hubalt who blood.
00:15:10.296 - 00:15:11.096, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:15:11.160 - 00:15:17.904, Speaker B: Don't try to mix them together. They won't have you. You won't find necessarily a protect the leave collector having a hublot.
00:15:18.024 - 00:15:21.456, Speaker A: Well, you can actually have the same parent company owner, I think.
00:15:21.520 - 00:15:29.248, Speaker B: But Richemont, like luxury conglomerates exist. I get it. But they don't, they don't mix, they.
00:15:29.256 - 00:15:31.928, Speaker A: Don'T mix audiences and market oil and vinegar, man.
00:15:31.976 - 00:15:33.320, Speaker B: Like uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:33.432 - 00:15:44.696, Speaker A: So what yuga did here is they said, okay, we know our board ape audience and we're going to try to apply that to the. We're going to try to talk to the crypto punk audience like they're the bored ape audience and they could be more different audiences.
00:15:44.840 - 00:16:27.154, Speaker B: So I think on this point around nfts, we're not going to make this episode about nfts is look at them. It is relevant. In the episode of Armani that we just recorded, it has felt to me like the innovation in the NFT space has sort of been like non existent. There is so much that you can do with nfts, and I understand prices are down and floors. The attention is not on nfts yet. It's on meme coins, which is an NFT in and of itself, but more accessible, not capped with 10,000 or just a high floor price. But you could argue memes are not that very different than what people, from an emotional standpoint, want to feel when they're buying these things.
00:16:27.154 - 00:17:09.518, Speaker B: Now they're just buying memes on pump Vaughn or justifying wif or whatnot. So the question is like, well, let's. If you're thinking about nfts, I think the potential is there. Retails here, like, this just felt like, to your point, just not very innovative. And I was thinking the other day, the most interesting thing about nfts I think will be earned nfts not purchased nfts. And I'd like to see someone come up with something more novel than just a 10,000 collection out there. You know, give me the possibility of proof of space and time and doing stuff and, you know, doing something in an interesting way.
00:17:09.518 - 00:18:02.918, Speaker B: Because ultimately that's what, when people talk about their experiences, it sure, you could say, hey, look, I own this punk or I own this item, but you associate it with what actually happened. It's like sort of that classic Patek Philippe. Like, you never own it. You just like, take care of it for a future generation. That's sort of their Hallmark ultimately. Like, what would you care more about the, you know, tensorian or MATlab that you purchased? And maybe that has a very deep meaning because you bought it at the time where Solana was like coming out of a difficult, difficult spot, or the 20 nfts that you collected because you went to a concert and you met and you like music. You met like, I don't know, like a particular band that gave you an NFT in their 1st, 1st concert in the US.
00:18:02.918 - 00:18:07.974, Speaker B: Like, what are you gonna, what are you gonna, like, talk about in your collection? What are you gonna display?
00:18:08.134 - 00:18:45.644, Speaker A: It's funny. So mad lads are actually that for me, like, when I think mad lads, I think about a dinner I had with Tristan in Denver in the, like, absolute depths of the bear market. I think it was February 23. Like, the prices started turning again in, like, let's say beginning of Q 223, if I remember correctly, at some maybe July 23. But, like, February 2023 was about as dark as you could get. And I was with, at a dinner with, like, Tristan, Stani, some other people, and we were talking about nfts and they were like, pico bear. And Tristan's like, we're launching an NFT collection.
00:18:45.644 - 00:19:05.594, Speaker A: Everyone's like, what are you doing that for? And he's like, you had this whole thesis for it, like, building community and then launches a product on top of that. And so I actually associate mad lads with a moment in time. It's interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's move on to the eth. So your question at the very beginning.
00:19:06.374 - 00:19:09.606, Speaker B: So I had, why do you think last week was the most for folks?
00:19:09.710 - 00:19:58.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I was reflecting on last week and it didn't really hit me until I was at this dinner a couple of nights ago, which I'll talk about. But my takeaway is last week was the single best week that the industry has ever had in the history of the industry. There have been better weeks for maybe price action, or even though things did run like 20%, there's been better weeks for price action. There's been better weeks for, I would say, crypto nativity. And several companies raise big rounds or Coinbase. Going public was really exciting, things like that. But this was the single greatest week in terms of general institutional government level thinking around crypto and narrative building around crypto changing.
00:19:58.130 - 00:20:29.748, Speaker A: If you think about last week, fit Saab, ETF, Gruenberg getting the axe, CBDCs, Trump turning on crypto, which then turned Biden on crypto. Right. Biden then waived the statement on Fit. Schumer has turned on the dems and is now supporting crypto. There's a massive 180 C change. And again, it was really exciting watching Trump talk about bitcoin like that was nuts. And maybe I can even play the clip for people who missed it.
00:20:29.748 - 00:21:10.868, Speaker A: And he's talking about self custody, and there's a whole backstory of that statement there and I can share it if interesting. I went to this dinner that was hosted by portal Ventures, which just, yeah, shout out to Katrina and Evan and stuff. They're for portal ventures, less known name, but they're probably one of the best, like first checks into companies these days, like, dude, they do a lot of pre seed investing insight. They. Yeah, x Evans x Insight Venture partners. They're real. Yeah, they're a really good, they've been in a lot of the really good, like pre seed, they're like, you launch a product and three weeks later maybe portal can lead your preseason.
00:21:10.996 - 00:21:12.388, Speaker B: I've done a few investments with them.
00:21:12.476 - 00:21:52.628, Speaker A: They're great. So the whole conversation was very, can't share who they were. Kept laughing at me like, hey, media guys, this off the record. So I can't share any of the names or anything like that. But there is one of the largest, a massive fund from Hong Kong there, one of the biggest, like Silicon Valley venture firms. Just like it was a very big tradfi dinner, I'd say some big lawyers and stuff. And the conversation, I would say the theme, if I could summarize it in two sentences, was up until a week or two ago, they will not touch crypto.
00:21:52.628 - 00:22:22.856, Speaker A: And the reason they won't touch crypto is still FTX. In my mind, FTX is so far in the past, but for a lot of the folks who maybe like had LP's who they had to describe to them for weeks or months why they invested in FTX, like, it is a big thing to get over that. This is the first time that they're like, okay, okay, I'd consider allocating again. Like, this is clearly a us. This is now a us thing that politicians are talking about. Okay, this seems here to stay. So yeah, it was.
00:22:22.856 - 00:22:37.974, Speaker A: Now that being said, they're still not allocating and they're still, and they're still not doing anything with a ten foot pole. But it's, I see the gears turning a little bit, unlike a month ago where a dinner like this, they'd be like, I'm not touching it. I'm not interested.
00:22:38.094 - 00:23:22.676, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'd be. I know I wasn't here for the episode last week, but would definitely agree that the crypto has become one of the more interesting topics of this election. That was not on my bingo card. That was in the very hopeful box of, if this ever happens, crypto at some point will become something that politicians rally behind to appeal to a younger voter base that cares about it. But I never thought it would be this election cycle. Certainly not at the presidential level. Yes, maybe at the local level, but yeah, it's definitely felt like it has opened.
00:23:22.676 - 00:23:57.244, Speaker B: Just to recap, the things that in my mind have been most impactful started with speech Trump gave at Mar a Lago, Ryan Selkus was there and a few other folks. And he very openly talked about being pro crypto and it being important for the US to maintain a competitive edge against places like China. And he rallies behind that. And I think it's important. We've been advocating for that here and behind closed doors. And it is the message. The US is losing its competitive edge.
00:23:57.244 - 00:24:23.206, Speaker B: These are serious companies that are going overseas. You don't want that there might be a risk of just human capital and resources and capital going elsewhere. Like, that's just not very american. Um, and so it started there. That to me was very, that I think that detonated a lot of stuff. The, the other one was the, the vote. Right.
00:24:23.206 - 00:25:17.834, Speaker B: Sab 121 or SB 121? Sab one, um, where you saw Democrats, uh, you know, detracting and falling out of line. Right. Party line. And I think realizing, hey, maybe it's interesting because at some point they're going to do stuff that doesn't compromise their ability to get reelected. And I think they're just appreciating that, you know, them voting against that was not something that was probably going to hurt their career. And so that was also really because historically, I think the Democrats have just been very united on, against his front right, top down directive, like, you know, and that was really the second most important thing. And, you know, I think to your point, that really quickly percolates down to Wall street.
00:25:17.834 - 00:25:45.902, Speaker B: And in my mind, all of this can be summarized in one thing. Right. I know you like to talk about like last cycle is so obvious. Covid and I, and I'll go on the record saying this cycle will be very couple of key moments. We had a bitcoin ETF that absolutely legitimized this asset class. There's no question this is no longer not an asset class. The second one was in short order.
00:25:45.902 - 00:26:44.774, Speaker B: You had an ETTF also approved. And that is the second point I'm trying to make is Wall street now understands and Wall street can now make money out of this industry. And they're going to, historically they've been anti crypto, but now that they can make money off of these ETF's and whatnot, then they're on our side. That has an incredible amount of, call it political goodwill to will this into existence and make sure that are we going to see a sole ETF or a doge ETF this year? I don't know. There are certain things you need to happen first, but I'll put my money on them being here. More ETF's coming in the next twelve months faster than most people think. And I think anytime.
00:26:44.774 - 00:27:09.484, Speaker B: I'm not going to try to pretend to time how these institutions are going to come, when they're going to allocate. But if I've learned anything in prior cycles is that the things that you think are not going to happen or will take long, long to happen just happen faster. And sometimes it's sort of that thing like what you think is going to happen in ten years happens in two and two and ten. So, yeah, that's, there was this, there was this.
00:27:09.564 - 00:27:54.818, Speaker A: So the president of the New York Stock Exchange was speaking at consensus yesterday, and I just turned on a random clip and was watching it for a sec. Look at this quote, president of the New York Stock Exchange. They asked her about launching crypto trading. Will the New York Stock Exchange launch crypto trading spot crypto trading? Like, will you be able to trade Solana in a New York stock exchange owned entity? She said if there was a clear regulatory guidance, it would be an opportunity to look at, and then just smiled and said, you got the feeling that they're doing something. And like I said in this tweet, I would guess this happens a lot sooner than people are predicting. And look, if the New York Stock Exchange launches crypto trading, then Nasdaq launches crypto trading.
00:27:54.936 - 00:28:55.200, Speaker B: Look, crypto allows financial institutions to monetize and earn a different revenue line, and it is now allowing brokers and financial advisors to sell an ETF with a higher fee. And also, my interactions, like when I was terrified, like we were pitching DeFi, I was very surprised. And I've always been very surprised, positively. Like even going to talk to regulators about proof of stake and staking and validation and running your own node and whatnot in 2019, 2020, you would be shocked. And I know we've had multiple folks in the blockchain association, and they'll probably agree with this. The staff in these agencies, in these companies have had a better part of a decade to understand and study this asset class. That sure has evolved quite a bit.
00:28:55.200 - 00:29:47.554, Speaker B: But a lot of the core components have been, you know, they've had multiple years to study this and they're quite knowledgeable. And I think at this point, like, when I went and talked to allocators, they're like, we don't disagree with anything that you're saying around defi. Yeah, maybe the smart contract risk and we need insurance and whatnot. But again, it sort of all hinges on the reason why nine out of ten someone wouldn't give you money to invest in crypto, is that regulatory lack of regulatory guidance. So the question is, this cycle, like, how much capital do you think has been sidelined waiting for clear regulatory guidance in the US, in the largest financial market of the world, because you've seen a rally that no one expected?
00:29:49.174 - 00:30:25.642, Speaker A: Let me give you a data point, too. That we have is so last year, 38% of the speakers of permissionless dropped out. Last year's permissionless was honestly a nightmare internally because the regulatory apparatus was cracking down so hard week after week on crypto that we had 38% of the on chain speakers dropped out in the last month. So whether it's uniswap or aave, none of them would come speak in person at the event because they were worried about honestly being on us soil. Look at the speaker list that we have today. Who are. They're flying into the US.
00:30:25.642 - 00:30:52.452, Speaker A: Some of these guys live in Europe, some of them live in Asia, they're flying to the US. So you've got Balaji, you've got the big names, like Tom Emmer is coming, Paul Gruhl, Chris Dixon, Novogratz. Like, these are names that we weren't able to get last year. And then you have the protocol founders. Sriram Keoni from Monad, Evan the Sui founder, Ben Jones, optimism founder, Devin the Opensea founder, Harry the Arbitrum founder. Like, the protocol founder.
00:30:52.588 - 00:30:55.068, Speaker B: To be fair, like, all of those guys live in the US, right?
00:30:55.236 - 00:31:12.074, Speaker A: A lot of those guys live in the US, but they wouldn't. But last year, like, man, emailing people, like, just trying to get them to come speak at a us event was impossible. They want. They wouldn't do it. And now they're like, it is a complete. It's a complete 180. So.
00:31:12.074 - 00:31:20.214, Speaker A: And then I think on the allocator side, too, it's like, I mean, let me. Let me share this clip. Can people. If I share this, auntie, can you hear it?
00:31:20.994 - 00:31:48.494, Speaker B: Sure. That I will ensure that the future of crypto and the future of bitcoin will be made in the USA, not driven overseas. I will support the right to self custody to the nation's 50 million crypto holders. I say this with your vote. I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your bitcoin, and I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
00:31:52.474 - 00:32:05.986, Speaker A: First things first is credit to where credit is due. Obviously, Trump does not know much about self custody. I think David Bailey from Bitcoin magazine is the one kind of behind this, advising Trump on a lot of these things. And so I just want to give.
00:32:06.010 - 00:32:06.682, Speaker B: Credit where credit is.
00:32:06.698 - 00:32:49.292, Speaker A: Due big shout out to David Bailey for what he's been doing behind the scenes. So when I saw this, I think a lot of people said, wow, that's amazing. If Trump gets elected, it's going to be so good for crypto. My reaction was, what is like that speech right there? Those 40 seconds just forced the Biden's hand. And sure enough, it came out last night. The block had a, had like this exclusive where they said Biden campaign ramps up crypto industry outreach in surprisingly, in surprising tone shift. And their, their, like, summary was Joe Biden's reelection campaign has begun reaching out to crypto industry players over the past two weeks for guidance on crypto community and policy.
00:32:49.292 - 00:33:18.906, Speaker A: Sources told the block they noticed a significant shift in tone from the Biden administration and campaign towards crypto with a new willingness to understand crypto and their communities. And that is like, that is the impact of that, of that Trump statement. And I think Hayden from Uniswap had a good, there were a lot of people who were like, too little, too late, whatever. No, not in the slightest. And Hayden had the best take. He said that the too little, too late. This is pandering crowd is missing the point.
00:33:18.906 - 00:33:36.564, Speaker A: Dem establishment has finally realized that being anti crypto by letting Warren run financial policy will lose them elections. This is a big deal. Nothing politicians care about more than winning elections. Welcome to the new era. Yeah. Couldn't have said it better myself.
00:33:36.684 - 00:33:59.408, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I tweeted about this last week. You know, one, you can no longer not talk about crypto or care about it. And, yeah, I think that you saw SAP 121 or SP 121, just people are now feeling the pressure that if you're anti crypto, you're going to have a harder time being reelected.
00:33:59.536 - 00:34:52.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, your point, I think your best point there is, like you said five minutes ago, is the last cycle. The last cycle. In hindsight, it felt obvious, but maybe in the moment it didn't because the world was crashing and it really didn't. But you had these moments looking back where it's just like Paul Tudor Jones comes out, calls bitcoin, fastest horse in the race, start pumping egregious amounts of capital into the system, and looking back, you're like, man, that was so obvious right now, the moment I would just have everyone slow down and think about, you now have a presidential election where both us candidates are pro crypto. We've never had that in the history of crypto. And we've got the ETF's, um, and we're entering a season of, like, you know, and you have rates got jacked up and now maybe rates are getting pulled down again. Like, it's, uh, putting rates aside, you.
00:34:52.794 - 00:35:27.518, Speaker B: Have infrastructure, you have good applications. It's easy to onboard people and there's stuff to do. But, like, yeah, I feel in, tell you truth, like, and maybe this is. I'll go down as this might be made a meme, but I feel very calm. I have my thesis this cycle and I keep re evaluating it, but it's further solidified. We talk about the celebrity stuff that is happening again. People are.
00:35:27.518 - 00:35:42.370, Speaker B: It's reminiscent of last cycle. Top signals and. Is it a top signal? I don't. I don't think it is in. In the slightest. Um. But, yeah, you know, people I know here have commented that, well, I'm very arrogant with my thesis on Solana, and I just.
00:35:42.370 - 00:36:05.794, Speaker B: For me, it's. It is further crystallized and become clearer. And I don't. I don't think we're in later parts of the cycle. I think if anything, like having the ETF in short order, because there was like three weeks ago, people are saying, oh, the ETF may happen, like maybe a q three kind of thing. And now you have it.
00:36:05.914 - 00:36:06.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:06.402 - 00:36:40.434, Speaker B: And so I think maybe I'm reading too much into that, but I have, let's put it this way. My thesis hasn't been validated yet, and I continue to, if anything, sort of accelerated. I've deployed even more capital outside of the system because. Yeah, I just, I feel. I feel like we're, you know, this cycle might be quite big. I still stand by my price predictions that I did in December, by the way, remind me of those thousand sold. 606,000 eth.
00:36:41.614 - 00:36:43.194, Speaker A: What do you think? Bitcoin goes to.
00:36:48.214 - 00:36:59.474, Speaker B: Such a difficult question. But, like, 100. I'm also, like, thinking about the actual flows. But 120 to 150?
00:37:00.254 - 00:37:02.674, Speaker A: Yeah, that's. I think that's kind of.
00:37:03.054 - 00:37:15.790, Speaker B: There's also, like, the fan, like, who knows, man? We have a couple of sovereigns who might just come in and just. But it is. I'm just thinking of, like, the amount of flows that is required.
00:37:15.942 - 00:37:16.654, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:16.814 - 00:37:29.236, Speaker B: Because if bitcoin's at 250 or what is Kathy's wood price target? Like? She was here in the pod, like, so she's always throwing out crazy stuff. But what was it like? It was more than that. It was like 200 and 5500 now.
00:37:29.300 - 00:37:30.076, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:37:30.140 - 00:37:42.744, Speaker B: Yeah, that's like, I don't want to. That's not my base case, let's put it that way. But because if bitcoins at 250 to 500, what is everything else?
00:37:44.324 - 00:38:33.134, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by say's belief about the world I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what say has done with their V two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today. They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest EVM L two s on the market today, save V two is now live on public Devnet with main net scheduled for Q two.

00:40:26.828 - 00:41:17.930, Speaker A: I know you've been hearing a lot about the intersection of crypto and AI, and that's why I'm really excited to share our newest partner and sponsor at Empire, Skale, a high performance modular blockchain that's revolutionizing gaming and AI. With zero fees and instant finality, Skale's unique architecture allows for massive scalability and has already saved users over 6 billion in gas fees. The five main takeaways that you need to know for 10 gas fees. Two, Skale has instant finality and lack of mev. Three, the zero gas fee model of scale is really important for blockchain gaming adoption, as gamers don't have to pay transaction costs or have the SKL token. Four scales multi chain. This design allows for nodes to be combined to create chains and for individual sub nodes to actually be removed and relocated, which creates greater security and collusion resistance.
00:41:17.930 - 00:41:40.554, Speaker A: And five, Skale has become a really good fit for AI dapps because they're fast, automated zero fee transactions. Big thank you to skale for sponsoring Empire. We're excited to partner with you guys. Bridge over to scale if you're listening to this at scale space forward slash ecosystem, follow the journey along with Scale on X. At scale network. That's at scale network. Big thanks again to scale for sponsoring empire.
00:41:42.294 - 00:41:46.662, Speaker B: Have you made revisions to where you think we are in the cycle, how things are?
00:41:46.798 - 00:42:06.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I revised where we. Where I think we are in the cycle. So I had this thread that I put out in February. I said there are four phases of bull market. We just entered stage two, I'll give you the 32nd high level on it. Stage one is rebirth, where you've got the exhaustion from the bear market still exists. There's sparks of hope that pop up.
00:42:06.190 - 00:42:22.878, Speaker A: Everyone's still focusing on the bear market blow ups. Prices are quietly recovering, but people don't really talk about it. Only the deepest crypto natives really realize it. Most people are still in disbelief that we're in the bull market. That's phase one. Stage two is where we've been at. Stage two is excitement.
00:42:22.878 - 00:42:43.570, Speaker A: I'd say we are the first half of this year was excitement. Bear market has officially ended. Coins are nearing all time highs. Some have even blown past all time highs. Everyone in crypto understands we're in a bull market, but your Normie friends still aren't texting you. I'd say there's a weird combo of anxious and excited. Stack is growing.
00:42:43.570 - 00:43:04.132, Speaker A: Don't feel like you own enough coins. You start to see companies start hiring again. I made the joke of your friends start ordering guaca Chipotle again. Like everyone feels like they're starting to win again. That's the calm before the storm. That's where I feel like we've been out for the first half this year. What I tweeted on this weekend, I said, stage two is coming to an end.
00:43:04.132 - 00:43:35.086, Speaker A: Stage three is around the corner. And I originally thought stage three would come around the election, maybe this fall, September, depending on who was going to win. I thought it was going to come September, October, November. I've accelerated when I think stage three will come just because of what we've been talking about on this podcast and the complete 180 reversal in policy and regulation. Stage three is euphoria. Everything you own blows past all time highs. There used to be a new narrative every month.
00:43:35.086 - 00:43:54.574, Speaker A: Now there's a new narrative every week. Private markets get crazy. VC's start to announce their 300 $400 million funds. Near the end of stage three, you start to really skip due diligence, race to deploy. Everyone's announcing a new $100 million raise. We're mainstream again. Forbes, Fortune, Bloomberg, CNBC, they love crypto again, weirdly enough.
00:43:54.574 - 00:44:20.710, Speaker A: And then at the end of the cycle, the weird stuff starts happening. You see Fortune 500s buy bitcoin. You see the athletes and the artists get involved again. You see the celebrities get involved again. Everyone starts to believe that crypto is going up forever. And that's when delusion starts to seep into decision making, I'd say. And then you have the last leg of the cycle, which is kind of like disconnection from reality a little bit.
00:44:20.710 - 00:44:30.206, Speaker A: And that's a mid 2025 thing, I think. But, yeah, I've kind of accelerated when I think things will start to get a bit crazy. And we saw it that we actually.
00:44:30.350 - 00:44:33.998, Speaker B: Because of the celebrity, Iggy and Caitlyn Jenner.
00:44:34.046 - 00:44:57.602, Speaker A: And so I didn't. I posted that, like, just on the back of, like, regulations and the 180. And then sure enough, this week, like, yeah, you had, I mean, let's talk about the celebrity stuff you had. Like, I think Caitlyn Jenner came out, created her own meme coin, which was a total Jenner, but it was created by this guy Steve, and it was a scam. I honestly haven't paid too close of attention to it.
00:44:57.738 - 00:45:36.394, Speaker B: TLR is, I think Cejil has had a track record of scamming and his social. A lot of these celebrities have a social media team that candidly doesn't have a lot of understanding of crypto and unfortunately, tends to reach out to the wrong characters to inform their strategy. And in this case, they had been working with this particular person that has anyone in crypto probably tells you, run away from. And then they did a series of launches. Turns out that they launched this Jenner coin. Turns out Jenner didn't own any, actually, and so she never got the coins. And so it was just a very messy operation.
00:45:36.394 - 00:46:13.426, Speaker B: And. But then iggy, what is it? Last name is Leia. Yeah. The australian american kind of artist. She hosted Twitter spaces, and I actually joined kind of, I always, I joined for most of it. And I was quite surprised with her understanding of crypto, her kind of sense of, like, reason. She was like, no, I'm not going to work with this idiot to heal someone.
00:46:13.426 - 00:46:45.198, Speaker B: There's several things that she's like, no, I'm never going to connect my phone number to my Twitter. Like, I'm not dumb. Like, she said that I was like, okay, she's, uh, she's sophisticated and, um, you know, of course she's playing with memes. She's like, you know, people were asking, do you like cats or dogs? Obviously, you know, people want to off of that, like, run a meme. Right? And she also said, one of the more interesting I tweeted, she said, I think crypto is. She was, she did a series of, like, hallmark tweets. She said, crypto sexy.
00:46:45.198 - 00:47:28.954, Speaker B: You know, she, she likes Phantom. She's using Phantom. And also she set out that she found crypto more interesting than her onlyfans, which I thought was very interesting. I think she's making a lot of money off of her OnlyFans account. Someone asked her that if she launched her token or meme coin, would that allow people to then subscribe to her OnlyFans account? And she said, well, I don't know how that actually would work. So anyways, she was also with her brother, who was seeing Visacup, ten years younger, but I think it's like 20 something. She's 30, in her early thirties, but that maybe I'm trying to not look at it for what it was last cycle.
00:47:28.954 - 00:47:41.038, Speaker B: I do think that. Of course it's on. Let's just. Let's just get a couple things out of the way. People in crypto, like, there's nothing wrong. People come to the space because they want to make money. Speculation is.
00:47:41.038 - 00:48:12.364, Speaker B: I'll keep saying it. Speculation is a. Is a huge driver for any technological revolution. I think the manner by which it happens, obviously, is important. But, yeah, like, we know how historically, celebrity coins have gone down, and a lot of them are frauds or scams. There's a number of artists, like soldier boy and some of these personalities, even FTX endorsements. Right.
00:48:12.364 - 00:49:05.246, Speaker B: But let me ask you a question. If crypto goes mainstream, like, don't you think that it's sort of, like, gonna. It's inevitable that you have not just celebrities, but athletes and major football clubs and entire entertainment industry, music industry, like, adopt this technology and try to figure it out? Are they gonna get it perfect the first time around? No. I think you can look at how the Internet evolved and how music like Napster versus Spotify. Like, that was a messy. What I'm trying to say is technological revolutions are messy, and you don't usually get it right the first time. The further challenge that this space has is that you don't have one chief marketing officer, one product officer, one CEO.
00:49:05.246 - 00:49:58.150, Speaker B: You have multiple projects competing for attention in this chaotic world where, furthermore, capital is moving way faster and at a global scale. And so there are weird experiments. Sometimes it's difficult to observe these, because if you've been in the industry long enough, you sort of say, yeah, this feels and has a lot of hallmarks of a scam. But, like, I don't think. I think it was ansem that tweeted. And I sort of agree with it, which is, if we are, from this point forward, if we're going to treat every celebrity that comes into the space, every artist, every company, as a top signal and be critical and not help them out, then I think we've lost the plot. And I think the best we can do as an industry is actually extend a hand and say, we can definitely do better.
00:49:58.150 - 00:50:21.410, Speaker B: And the only thing we can't control as an industry is make sure that these people are listening to a panel, a group of the right set of people. You know what I mean? Not this random Saheel guy who has a long track record of scamming people or sams of the world. You know what I mean? So I welcome any and everyone that wants to think about how to use crypto in their strategy. You know what I mean?
00:50:21.522 - 00:50:22.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:22.794 - 00:50:58.894, Speaker B: What's the difference between LVMH doing pendants of punk holders and selling them for like twenty K and a celebrity doing their own coin? I guess one of them, it tells you very quickly, if the price goes up and down, if the price goes down as a scam, if the price goes up, she's the best thing then the, you know, she's the best artist now of all time, and, but if your pendant, you know, maybe doesn't have as a liquid of a market, but if that pendant goes down in value, it's like, no, no, no, it's, you know, Tiffany, you know, Tiffany is Tiffany. I don't see the distinction.
00:51:00.714 - 00:51:30.390, Speaker A: Uh, here's the distinction in my mind, so the distinction in my mind is that these folks have never, ever come into the industry. They've never once said they're interested in the industry. They've never once, like, been in the industry. And like, their first time ever mentioning crypto is promoting a token. So I think the right way to. Here's my jumbled thought on this, because I haven't been paying too close of attention. All right, first thought is we want mass adoption.
00:51:30.390 - 00:52:00.932, Speaker A: Eventually, these celebrities are going to come into the industry, and that is a good thing. You want everyone in the world paying attention to crypto, so that's a really good thing. And there was more than just iggy, right? It was like rich the kid, trippie Red, like David O, which I think is one of the biggest artists coming out of Africa. I'm pretty sure I haven't dragged that now. Yeah, he's got like 65 million followers or something like that. So anyways, there's a lot of celebrities doing it. There's a right way and a wrong way to do it, I think.
00:52:00.932 - 00:52:44.628, Speaker A: So if you look at, like, yeah, lvmh, like, lvMh has crypto people in house. They were looking for like multiple years at crypto. There's a top down directive from who's the Rich dude? Bernard Arnaud, who runs LVMH, like, has a big crypto portfolio and is like a big NFT collector. And like, so there's kind of this, like, ethos, I think, that permeates crypto, and there's like a genuine interest from the top about LVMH. What bugs me is when it doesn't even bug me, I don't pay, I spend no mental energy on it. It's just not going to end well when, like, a celebrity who's not, and they're not all the same, it sounds like iggy actually has, like, a brother who's actually pretty interested in crypto, whatever.
00:52:44.756 - 00:52:47.670, Speaker B: She is. Yeah. I mean, or she is so, like.
00:52:47.742 - 00:53:00.314, Speaker A: I'm not going to bucket every. All celebrities very different. Right. But someone who just comes in is like, has never once mentioned crypto has zero interest in crypto. And you can kind of tell that, like, and then they launch a meme coin, like, I promise you that ends in tears.
00:53:00.934 - 00:53:04.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you.
00:53:04.262 - 00:53:30.924, Speaker A: Yeah. But eventually we're going to need, like, these people. Like, my just on crypto is that all the world's value will live on chain. And there's two types of value. There's financial value. That's like traditional Wall street, which is moving into defi, and then there's things that, like, the world has never really ascribed monetary value to in like, a very clear and obvious way, and that'll also move on chain. And that's the, like, music and all that kind of an attention and all that kind of stuff.
00:53:30.924 - 00:53:34.704, Speaker A: So the celebs are part of the second part of that.
00:53:34.744 - 00:54:13.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot, a lot of these celebs, and I do, like, one of the observations someone said was a lot of these celebs are like pastor prime. And it's like seeing celebs do, like, ads for products, you know, sort of like a meme. Right. Like if you're starting to do like, you know, old spice commercials, you're kind of like not doing blockbuster, like Grammy award winning movies. Oscar winning movies, you know? Right. So I get it. Humans are going to do things to, you know, if they see an opportunity that they can make money.
00:54:13.174 - 00:54:36.134, Speaker B: Well, there are ways of doing that. Right. As long as you don't compromise your values, principles. Yeah, I agree. Like, most of these celebrities, like, it's important, you know, it's a cash grab, you know, call it as such. This is why again, as an industry that the only thing we can do, like, let's put it this way, we're not going to, we're likely going to see more of this across the board. A lot more space continues to grow.
00:54:36.134 - 00:54:58.294, Speaker B: So the question for us that have been around and the industry is what can we do to help, you know, educate them, create a platform for helping them understand this and somehow monetize it? Like, of course they're going to want to do something if they're attaching their name and their followers and their attention.
00:54:59.014 - 00:55:20.942, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you'll probably see a couple startups this cycle get funded on the back of working with Hollywood. Like almost like crypto native agencies or a tech platform. But you'll probably see it funded by someone who's deep in the Hollywood scene in the same way that there's a lot of great DeFi platforms that were started by, like, ex capital markets guys.
00:55:21.118 - 00:55:25.928, Speaker B: Yeah, like, who is talking to. What is it the talent agency company?
00:55:25.976 - 00:55:27.444, Speaker A: You need. You need people who.
00:55:29.144 - 00:55:30.272, Speaker B: Endeavor. Endeavor.
00:55:30.368 - 00:55:30.768, Speaker A: You need.
00:55:30.816 - 00:55:47.164, Speaker B: I was actually looking at Endeavor last night because I was comparing it, and it was karate combat versus, like, the traditional, like, re. Emmanuel and Mahan, I think, have a public company called Ko Group, and that trades at 18 billion. I was just looking at their stats. I was looking at the company.
00:55:48.344 - 00:56:02.706, Speaker A: My buddy was the. Was the guy at Endeavor who runs celebrity investments, essentially, but not actually investments. It's like, you get 10% of a company to promote them. So, like, you'd like, I don't know.
00:56:02.730 - 00:56:05.698, Speaker B: Like Rihanna doing coconut water or whatever.
00:56:05.746 - 00:56:18.538, Speaker A: That's exactly right. So, like, a clothing brand would come to them, or, like, a pizza brand would come to them and be like, hey, we want, like, a mid twenties celeb who's, like, really good looking, and they'd go to, like, I don't know. I don't know, mid twenties celebs who.
00:56:18.546 - 00:56:22.470, Speaker B: Are good looking, but they, like, sydney Sweeney.
00:56:22.602 - 00:56:37.274, Speaker A: It's like, okay, so they go to Sydney Sweeney, and they've got Sydney Sweeney, and they're like, hey, Sidney, we've got a pizza brand. You just need to. They're gonna give you 15% of the company, but you gotta, like, pump the hell out of that pizza brand. I mean, and it works.
00:56:39.654 - 00:57:11.358, Speaker B: It's funny because I've come to this realization, like, the more and more. And in this trip, I've met, like, someone who actually, like, worked with Sydney, launch her own clothing brand, swimsuit, swim wear brand, and she ended up ditching it. But what was funny is she said, yeah, she. In the second season of whatever she was wearing, she had contractually said that she was gonna wear this. And I was like, wait, also, obviously, on the. What they wear on stage, like, absolutely. Like, they, you know, they.
00:57:11.358 - 00:57:23.674, Speaker B: They're promoting stuff. So anyways, like, this is what, like, a lot of the crypto native people that don't understand how Wall street works or how the entertainment industry works, it's like, no, no, no. These guys have been peddling shit. It's like a.
00:57:25.294 - 00:57:48.112, Speaker A: So what's happening here is an evolution. Okay? Is marketing influencer market. Let me. I'll make the comparison between, if you look at celebs and how they got paid on social five years ago is all ads. Like, you post an Instagram pic and you'd say hashtag ad, and you'd get paid 200k for that. Now you see much less of that. And you see them all have their own products.
00:57:48.112 - 00:57:52.244, Speaker A: They have their own skincare brand, they have their own bathing suit, whatever.
00:57:53.064 - 00:57:58.432, Speaker B: The Kardashians have done this exceptionally well. Like, what's. She did a. Yeah, exactly.
00:57:58.488 - 00:57:59.244, Speaker A: Jenner.
00:58:00.344 - 00:58:02.040, Speaker B: What's her name. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:02.072 - 00:58:25.800, Speaker A: Kylie Jenner. So if you think about how the celebs got paid off of crypto in the last cycle, it was like FTX ads, big sponsorships. LeBron doing an ad for crypto.com, comma, Matt Damon doing the ad for crypto.com, comma, all that kind of stuff. Now you're going to see them try to do their own products. What I will say is I'm very bullish on them doing things on chain.
00:58:25.800 - 00:58:29.176, Speaker A: I'm extremely bearish on meme coins.
00:58:29.200 - 00:58:31.672, Speaker B: Them launching a token meme coins as.
00:58:31.688 - 00:58:41.664, Speaker A: A tokenized representation of any celeb. I love meme coins, but I think a big meme coin, like a good meme coin, needs to embody an ideology.
00:58:42.484 - 00:58:43.420, Speaker B: Fair enough.
00:58:43.612 - 00:58:48.692, Speaker A: Race or class or sexuality or geography or politics over thinking it.
00:58:48.708 - 00:58:50.612, Speaker B: It's dogs, cats.
00:58:50.788 - 00:58:54.388, Speaker A: Dogs. Dogs. I mean, like. Yeah, exactly.
00:58:54.436 - 00:58:58.076, Speaker B: But, like, what does that represent more general, that is? Yeah, I see your point.
00:58:58.140 - 00:59:04.376, Speaker A: Like, with. In my mind, represents, like, just crypto. Crypto people have fun on the Internet, and a cute dogs are cute.
00:59:04.400 - 00:59:05.976, Speaker B: And this is the cutest dog out there.
00:59:06.120 - 00:59:07.056, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
00:59:07.120 - 00:59:11.880, Speaker B: So obviously I'm biased, but obviously I'm.
00:59:11.912 - 00:59:23.924, Speaker A: Buying, not buying biased Odin trump coin. Like, all these things. Like, those are the good meme coins. Like, yeah, you know, Jenner coin, not. Not a good meme coin. So.
00:59:24.264 - 00:59:31.794, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed. What else can we talk about more worthy of talking about?
00:59:33.454 - 00:59:36.614, Speaker A: Can talk about a lot, but what is worthy of the empire pod? That's.
00:59:36.694 - 00:59:38.614, Speaker B: Yeah, so I want to.
00:59:38.654 - 00:59:41.894, Speaker A: I want to float on Mount Gox. Oh, go ahead.
00:59:42.054 - 01:00:22.832, Speaker B: Mount Gox was moving some coins. They were going to move in. They were doing, like, a test trial run of, in advance of moving some coins, but people are dragging those wallets. So I came across as reading. So I like Shane Parrish. He has a great newsletter, and he had an excellent segment in his newsletter to talk about hard work that I tweeted, and that spun up a whole series of conversations with different people reflecting on their success. So what I wanted to do is I had a really good conversation with one, one and two people.
01:00:22.832 - 01:00:36.164, Speaker B: Really. And I want to bring them on the pod to go down and discuss this. And they're like four parts of it was all about hard work and the different types of hard work.
01:00:36.624 - 01:00:39.680, Speaker A: Will you share it? Will you share the five types of hard work?
01:00:39.792 - 01:00:53.464, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I can, I can share them now. I think so. I'll read it. Actually, it's a, I tweeted about, about it and I actually may want to end this podcast just getting your perspective. And we asked Armani, this is this one. Exactly. Yes.
01:00:53.464 - 01:01:22.784, Speaker B: And I want to, we also asked Armani this in the podcast yesterday about what he thought his success had backed back and had been. So, yeah. Shane goes on say there are four, there are different types of hard work. First one is outthinking. It's a better strategy, a shortcut. The second one is pure effort, so you're working longer, the intensity of it. The third one is being opportunistic, so you're positioning yourself to take advantage of change.
01:01:22.784 - 01:02:01.884, Speaker B: I think a lot in crypto has been that fourth is consistency, so you're just doing average things for longer. And the fifth one, which is different than consistency, is focus. And a lot of that is saying no to distractions. And I thought it was an excellent observation. So I am curious in the success that you've had of building blockworks or just investing, however you want to answer the question, what of those five do you think speak most to you and your success?
01:02:05.444 - 01:02:52.914, Speaker A: Out thinking, pure effort, opportunistic consistency, focus. If I had to rank all of these, probably, I mean, two and four, pure, pure effort and consistency. I don't think, I think it's probably, I think most founders, I mentioned this with Armani would say some combo of two, four and five, pure effort, consistency and focus. But especially with a business like blockworks, this isn't a rocket science business. We're not building the next generation smart contract protocol to eliminate blah, blah blah. We're not building rockets, we're not building AI. We're building a digital media business that drives into conferences, which drives people into a subscription data and research platform.
01:02:52.914 - 01:03:33.876, Speaker A: And that basically just takes a ridiculous amount, like a ridiculous amount of execution. And I think execution is just a byproduct of consistency and effort. So it's actually, it's funny, Mike and I have talked about this a lot. I think investors make better podcast guests and founders founder. I enjoy talking to founders more, but they are not as good on podcasts. And the reason for that is building a company comes down to execution and ability to execute. And I think being a good investor comes down to thinking, and oftentimes you're trying to build these big theses about the world.
01:03:33.876 - 01:04:14.470, Speaker A: And, like, your thesis on Solana, very different than other people's thesis on Solana in, like, let's say, a year and a half ago. For me, like, man, just stay the course. Effort, consistency, outwork other people and just try to stay alive, essentially. And I'd bucket that into consistency. There are things like opportunistic. We have done things when we saw folks like, I don't know, coindesk and Cointelegraph not covering the industry, like how we thought it should be covered, that was our opportunity to launch a better news business. When we saw other platforms, not building a research and data platform that we thought was world class, that was our opportunity.
01:04:14.470 - 01:04:23.344, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think a lot of people have tried to do that and they can't execute it. So being a founder, I think, just comes down to execution capabilities. What do you, what do you think.
01:04:24.084 - 01:04:25.428, Speaker B: For a founder or for me?
01:04:25.516 - 01:04:26.304, Speaker A: For you.
01:04:29.284 - 01:04:38.664, Speaker B: Opportunistic and focus. I would have probably said consistency up until three years ago.
01:04:39.244 - 01:04:40.264, Speaker A: Why is that?
01:04:40.804 - 01:05:20.874, Speaker B: Because I've been in the space for a long time and I've just stayed and I've, I think being opportunistic in crypto, like anyone that discovered this and has discovered this, even to this point, has been opportunistic, you know, because it's, it's an industry that is still discounted. It is hard. It is, you know, you might think it's easy, but if you're, if you've been here for a long period of time, I think you're a person that taking risk requires. You like, to be opportunistic. Said differently, if you're not taking risk, I don't think you're an opportunistic person. And if you're incrypto, you're taking risks. So that is, you're opportunistic.
01:05:20.874 - 01:05:39.114, Speaker B: It's sort of that idea that if you're positioning yourself in an uncomfortable spot, you're pushing that frontier. And so taking risk, I think, involves three, and I think I still take a lot of risk in my portfolio.
01:05:39.414 - 01:05:40.194, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:43.374 - 01:06:59.036, Speaker B: I steer more towards focus because the example is someone that discovered bitcoin early on and is only focused on bitcoin, has been a consistent person. Hes focused on that particular ecosystem. Someone that I think is a maximalist, is very consistent in his thinking. And I think sometimes as an investor, like, I would caution someone from being overly consistent because then you're not willing to change your mind, it's sort of that idea of like, oh, I'm rooting for the New York giants, and you never want to change because you're a giants fan or whatever. Maybe it's a stupid example, but what I'm trying to say is oftentimes we try to stay consistent, even though we feel that we need to change because of ego, because of fear that we might be not called, we might detract from a community that we've been the long part of. And I think in early stage investing and even in this industry, that I bucket wholeheartedly, as it's still very early stage and early stages of inception, you don't want to be necessarily consistent. I think you have to be consistent in your process, in the way that you absorb information and as a framework of an investment.
01:06:59.036 - 01:07:37.594, Speaker B: I think as you develop a process, I think you want to be consistent in that the things that you do to position yourself, to take advantage of opportunities. But I like focus because in order to, you know, markets are competitive, and I think you need intense focus to understand things before other people do. Yeah, because you could position yourself and be uncomfortable. And look, everyone was hearing Solana, people were vocal, tweeting constantly. Right. But if you're not focused, I think you will likely be carried away. You need resolve.
01:07:37.594 - 01:08:07.212, Speaker B: And I think, and I think you have to go deep to understand this tech. You have to go deep to talk to people. And the most wonderful thing is it's an open source movement. The access to information of founders is unparalleled. You have people going on this podcast, you can go to their discord channel. You can be intensely, I think you need to be intensely focused. And also, I would also actually think both from an investing standpoint and founders, you can do a million things in this space.
01:08:07.212 - 01:08:34.262, Speaker B: Right. Even as a founder, you can try to experiment with so much. But you, I think to really win a category, you need to be intensely focused. And so I'd rather be focused than just consistent. So anyways, that's a long winded answer. Well, I'll say is, I never want to do one outthinking. I never want to assume that I'm smarter than other people.
01:08:34.262 - 01:08:58.688, Speaker B: I just think markets are. It's hard to like, let's put it this way. I think the people that are blow up might want to, might say that one has been their thing. Long term capital management, 3 hours guys embodied that, I think, in a lot of ways. So I just think you should never think that you're smarter than other people as a as an mo.
01:08:58.856 - 01:09:27.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's one thing on here for founders that it comes down to. There's one thing that it comes down to for founders that is not on this list. And it ultimately just comes down to resilience. I think, like, the moat, the best founders that I have mattered, just the most resilient people. And, like, if I think about the number of times that block works, probably should have failed. Or, like, Mike and I had to stop paying ourselves to make payroll, or, you know, 82% of our revenue got wiped out overnight in Covid. Like, I think there's just a resiliency.
01:09:27.594 - 01:09:31.362, Speaker A: It's not a hard work thing, but, you know, effort.
01:09:31.498 - 01:09:32.826, Speaker B: Would you say that's pure effort?
01:09:32.890 - 01:09:55.354, Speaker A: I think it's probably pure. I mean, look, there's this. Yeah, it's probably pure effort. There's this. There's this Mark Andreessen quote. It goes something like this. The world is a very malleable place, and if you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy, drive, and passion, the world oftentimes reconfigures itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would originally think.
01:09:55.354 - 01:10:27.460, Speaker A: And it's a. I think it's a spin off on the Steve Jobs quote, which is something along the lines of, like, when you. When you look around at the world, like, and start to realize that everything around you was created, created by people who are no smarter or no different than. Than you and me, the world becomes a much more interesting and fun place. I'm botching. I'm watching both those quotes. I'm sure that's essentially being a founder is just, like, picking something, going at it with maximum drive and energy, and just being resilient and not willing to quit.
01:10:27.460 - 01:10:29.124, Speaker A: So that's.
01:10:29.204 - 01:11:13.626, Speaker B: I love that Steve Jobs quote. And I think a big part of your discovery, maybe as a founder or as an investor, is to always be opportunistic and position yourself in an environment where you can be surrounded by people that you think are highly successful. And then you'll realize, like, because sometimes we glorify founders, you know, from the out, like, and once you get to know them, and if you have that opportunity, it's sort of. It puts a human element to that. These people actually go through the same struggles, the same problems, and in their journey, we're no different than you and I. And so, you know, maybe there's, like, a savant out there. You know, I mean, like folks like Elon Musk or whatnot, but.
01:11:13.626 - 01:11:50.598, Speaker B: Or Jim Simmons, you know, some of these people like. But there's, like, most founders are just like, you know, doing things that are normally going through the same struggles, you know? And sometimes they feel so far out. And I think being surrounded by sounds like you are in a position where they're going to these dinners, you're talking to these people, and you're like, are they fundamentally different that you see a lot of parts of yourself and you then believe it? Like, action, I can make it. You know what I mean? Maybe if you met a media exec like Bloomberg or whatever, you're like, sounds like what he's describing in the early days, like, I'm kind of going through you. You kind of. There's a. There's a.
01:11:50.598 - 01:12:07.398, Speaker B: There's. I see myself in. In what he was doing, and. And if he can make it, then I can make it. And candidly, I think that what. That is probably what makes America the best place in the world still. It's this idea that, like, you know, people celebrate success and failure, and it's.
01:12:07.398 - 01:12:37.726, Speaker B: It's an environment where you can go to these institutions like Harvard or not Harvard or just Silicon Valley and through osmosis, just surround yourself with these high caliber people that will actually take an interest in you. You mean, like, I felt that culturally, in America, people are more likely to open the door and say, oh, yeah, oh, you're building a company. Like, I'll talk to you. I'll give you advice. Like, the mentors put it this. Other than my dad, three out of my four mentors and I tweeted about this, are all american, all in the US. Think about that.
01:12:37.726 - 01:12:50.374, Speaker B: And I've traveled. I've lived everywhere. Like, there's just this idea in the US of more, like. Whereas in other places, it's more hierarchical. It's like, oh, you weren't. You know, you're not old money. Like, we can't talk to you.
01:12:50.374 - 01:13:14.268, Speaker B: Like, no, you know, it's like. And I think for that reason, the US is still the best place in the world because they care less about status, you know, hierarchy and class, and more about, you're someone that's smart. I'm gonna open the door. I want to talk to you. And that's amazing. That truly is amazing. And as long as the US doesn't lose that, I will bet all of my chips on the US.
01:13:14.436 - 01:13:18.344, Speaker A: I agree. I agree. That feels like a good place to rap, man.
01:13:18.764 - 01:13:20.264, Speaker B: God bless America.
01:13:23.204 - 01:13:41.026, Speaker A: I got to do a plug for permissionless, which is. I mean, we're pumped. We had a big conversation after last year's permissionless. Like, do we do it in the US or do we go somewhere else? Do we go to Europe or we go to Singapore? And look, we made the decision to keep it in the US and Miami. Yeah, very good about that.
01:13:41.050 - 01:13:45.314, Speaker B: We're not going to be in Miami. I will bet. I'm on the record. It's Miami.
01:13:45.434 - 01:13:47.850, Speaker A: No, it's in. It's in Salt Lake. This year. It's in Salt Lake.
01:13:47.882 - 01:13:48.234, Speaker B: No, no.
01:13:48.274 - 01:13:56.506, Speaker A: I know, like, the following, but future, future ones. I plead the fifth on this one. I can't share my top secret, top secret lockworks.
01:13:56.610 - 01:13:57.968, Speaker B: I buy my ticket to Miami, me.
01:13:57.976 - 01:14:17.296, Speaker A: First on the podcast. But go. If you guys have made it this far, come to permissionless. We've got an empire code for you. It's usually Empire ten, but I just typed in Empire 20 on that, on the event, to see if it actually works. And Empire 20 works. Empire, this is going to get bought in heavily.
01:14:17.296 - 01:14:29.090, Speaker A: Let's try to find Empire 25. No, Empire 25 doesn't. Empire 30 doesn't. So I would recommend going on the permissionless page. The code is Empire 20 looks like it works, but you could try, like, Empire.
01:14:29.242 - 01:14:33.282, Speaker B: You could try Empire 90, and that's my code of you guys.
01:14:33.458 - 01:14:39.482, Speaker A: I think we're going to be capped at 20. I think the marketing team told me Empire ten, but Empire 20 seems to be working.
01:14:39.538 - 01:14:41.894, Speaker B: So I got a different code. Empire 90.
01:14:43.594 - 01:14:56.674, Speaker A: Empire free. I will say we just signed this thing to get a podcast studio on site. We're actually going to have block works like Empire podcast studio. So come hang us onto me and record the pod.
01:14:57.094 - 01:15:06.674, Speaker B: Great. We're on the dot for an hour. Nine. Thanks, everyone, for listening. And we'll be reading the comments. We didn't read any this time, but we will.
01:15:07.294 - 01:15:18.486, Speaker A: They're too kind that we need some spice jab. Here's my call to action. Go. Go buy your permissionless ticket and then go. Either go jab to either me or Santi. We'll see. We'll see what the comments say this week.
01:15:18.486 - 01:15:19.126, Speaker A: Week.
01:15:19.310 - 01:15:20.438, Speaker B: Nice. All right.
