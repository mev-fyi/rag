00:00:00.200 - 00:00:15.074, Speaker A: Look back in history as, like, if that's one thing that really changed bitcoin and the reason is actually pretty. Pretty simple, right? Like, it's the first use case on bitcoin, l one that has actually captured attention from the raid.
00:00:16.574 - 00:00:28.994, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We are really lucky to be joined today by Munib Ali. Who. Munib, I think you were the first guest ever on Empire, so it is a long time coming. Nice little reunion.
00:00:29.514 - 00:00:36.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I remember I was the first guest. And your podcast has come a long way since then, so congrats on all the success.
00:00:36.842 - 00:00:41.134, Speaker C: Thanks, Muniv. It's really come a long way since I joined Empire, so appreciate it.
00:00:41.794 - 00:00:43.042, Speaker A: Really appreciate it.
00:00:43.178 - 00:00:46.534, Speaker C: I already like you already. I promise I won't ask all the hard questions.
00:00:48.074 - 00:01:11.354, Speaker B: Yeah. Muniv's like, the show's really improved. Don't know what happened. So, Muni, usually we don't do this, but actually, I thought it'd be helpful. A lot of our audiences may be a little more deep into the ETH game, so I'm gonna give a little background on. On what you guys have been building, and I'd love for you to, like, I think it just as a helpful primer, and then correct me if I'm wrong, obviously. And then we can jump into all things ordinals on chain activity, on bitcoin and stuff.
00:01:11.354 - 00:01:52.854, Speaker B: But my understanding is that, uh, stacks. So there's, like, you've, um, a couple different, like, entities, I'd call it, or, like, uh, open source projects that you're working on. Stacks, my understanding is an open source project started by a bunch of bitcoin builders. And the devs behind stacks been working on bitcoin for a really long time in 2017. I remember you guys raised from Union Square Ventures. The block size wars were going on, and it had become super clear to people that the only way to scale transactions or, like, new use cases on bitcoin was through L2s. And actually, before all these l two talks about coinbases l two and arbitrum and optimism, it was really stacks and lightning, which were like l two s on bitcoin.
00:01:52.854 - 00:02:19.824, Speaker B: And so, stacks, the way that I think about it, is just a bitcoin, l two. And the lightning network is like, if people know lightning, it's like an l two on bitcoin. But peer to peer transactions. Stacks is more like smart contracts on bitcoin. And I think your guys vision for a while now has been, like, whatever you can build on Ethereum, or Solana, or another smart contracting layer you can build on stacks. Is that how did I do there?
00:02:19.984 - 00:03:00.942, Speaker A: No, I think you did a great job. But one thing I want to point out is that l two s, especially in Ethereum, have a very precise definition, and according to that definition, stacks is actually not an l two. Without getting into the technical detail, I think high level, most people think of it as an l two, so I'm not surprised that you are as well. But generally speaking, I think spot on. It's a bunch of bitcoin builders who work, including me. We're working on literally the l one. Like bitcoin l one, bitcoin scripting language, tried building interesting things with it, and as you can imagine, it's fairly limited both in terms of what you could program, but also in terms of scalability.
00:03:00.942 - 00:03:17.566, Speaker A: And 2017 is when lightning started, the stacks layer started. And just, I would say last year is when we're seeing this revival of bitcoin builders culture, which I'm just so excited. I think that Cornell is actually play a big role in it.
00:03:17.750 - 00:03:37.358, Speaker C: Can you give us context and background as to why this resurgence of developer activity? Because it felt for a while. The obvious question for this episode is why is this time any different? Because there's been chat about bitcoin doing this precisely over the years, but it hasn't really amounted to much.
00:03:37.526 - 00:04:16.668, Speaker A: Yeah, I think some background context may be helpful there. What I observed in the bitcoin community, I would say between 2013 and until the block size war started in 2017, is that there was always this healthy community of developers who are intellectually curious, want to do interesting things, and a bunch of experiments would happen on bitcoin. Counterparties are great examples. Nfcs started literally on bitcoin l one. Same with colored coins, which are like early icos. People actually raised ico money on bitcoin l one, using colored clients. I built a decentralized domain system.
00:04:16.668 - 00:04:45.902, Speaker A: So in terms of being pre something, so it predates ens. It was a bitcoin l one in 2015 still runs. Actually, I own those names, which are probably historic at some point, and people have already rediscovered them. And I think that culture really drastically changed. Obviously, I'm simplifying the story a little bit. During the block size wars, two things were happening. One, ethereum started taking off like, I think it had its like cryptokitties moment.
00:04:45.902 - 00:05:42.942, Speaker A: A lot of the intellectually curious people, people who wanted to, you know, play around with things, frankly, ethereum was the better, easier way to do it. You have a full execution environment. But more importantly, the culture is very, very welcoming. Whatever environment you want to run, you can come in and you can do that. On the bitcoin side, when the civil war was happening, the people who ended up winning the war and I was actually on the smaller blocks during that time, they were sort of like, one of their arguments was, we don't need any of these use cases, so why would you ever want to increase the block size? Bitcoin should just be money. And I think if that is your winning party, it actually sends a message to the rest of the community, because I do think the culture changed a lot, like the folks who gained more voice share and became more powerful, influential. And I think thats really what maybe you guys, if youre more active in ETH, youve interacted more with what we call the bitcoin maximalist.
00:05:42.942 - 00:06:30.668, Speaker A: And theyre sort of like sitting on the sidelines cheering for every experiment that fails, not understanding that this is how Silicon Valley works. A few things do well, and they do really, really well. And the long tail of startups basically fails. So if you are cheering every failed experiment, youre actually not innovating, not sort of like doing anything. I think we went through, like those years after the block size wars, and people had options. Frankly, if you get yelled at as a developer in one ecosystem, and you're welcome and embraced in another, it's a pretty obvious choice where, where you would want to go. And a small group of people, including myself, a bunch of others who are really interested in bitcoin, their tool, those are separate camps, right? People who are interested in bitcoin, the technology, the tool they want to build, they want to actually use it.
00:06:30.668 - 00:06:43.428, Speaker A: And bitcoin, the idea or the religion. And I think weve heard a lot more from the religious crowd and not as much from the builder crowd. And I think that is sort of changing now. And I can get into why.
00:06:43.556 - 00:07:08.906, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. So that makes a lot of sense to me, munib. I think one question that I would have is why? Right. Why not just separate bitcoin and ETH? Bitcoin has product market fit. It is digital gold. Why not just build apps on Ethereum, where we have this great smart contracting layer already? Why are you trying to almost force this smart contracting layer onto bitcoin? It feels like a little bit, yeah.
00:07:09.010 - 00:07:51.578, Speaker A: I think it's a great question. So I would just look at the market reality that even after the last cycle of the bull market, we still have $500 billion of BTC Capital. Mostly just sitting theta is like I don't know, 200, 250 billion or something. And I think that's sort of like a, like a blue ocean opportunity where there's so much capital, it's very much like sort of like sitting passively. And if you're a developer, you can almost like come in and try to make it productive. I do think like people are trying to build bridges to other ecosystems. So we have, you know, WBDC going, going to Ethereum, there's some bridge going to avalanche.
00:07:51.578 - 00:08:07.914, Speaker A: But if you're focused on bringing the functionality to bitcoin, that's sort of like the opposite of that. Instead of trying to take BTC, do a chain that has contracts, you're doing the reverse of it. You're saying, I'm going to bring all of the functionality where the capital is already sitting.
00:08:08.854 - 00:08:39.858, Speaker C: Yeah. It feels like such an obvious thing. It may be one of these things where in five years time, if this actually works, we'll be like, do what you just said. But I'm curious, like, if you could go into the tech of like, how hard is it to actually build, like programming, like smart contracting language like l two s in Ethereum have been discussed since the inception of Ethereum. Scalability was on the roadmap. And there's a number of teams that have been, you know, focused on this. Arbitrum, for instance, since the early days of Ethereum, was working on this at Princeton, which I believe you also went to.
00:08:39.858 - 00:08:50.134, Speaker C: I may be wrong here, but anyways, I'm really curious if you could go into the tech and where you guys are and what's a roadmap look like?
00:08:51.874 - 00:09:21.660, Speaker A: I think that's a great question. Yeah, I did my PhD at Princeton. I know at Felton from there and solidarity team. And I would say that you really need to understand, you need to spend time in the bitcoin ecosystem and understand the challenges. And I typically categorize them into a handful. One thing is that bitcoin is lagging in terms of developer tools and basic infrastructure. I'll give you an example.
00:09:21.660 - 00:10:07.036, Speaker A: Because of the ordinal's interest, people were actually trying to find wallets that were compatible with tapu, and they couldn't find a wallet. They couldn't find basic dev tooling libraries that they could use to actually even make their wallets compatible with tapu. Like simple, basic stuff that's just not there. And then that's why having a builders community actually helps. Because right now, within weeks, some of the top wallets that actually integrated ordinals or taproot or make it easy for people to do these things on bitcoin. L1 are actually builders from the stacks layer ecosystem, like the XWS wallet or hero wallet and so on. So one thing is like people, people don't realize how bad the dev, tooling and infrastructure situation in bitcoin is.
00:10:07.036 - 00:10:46.986, Speaker A: So theoretically, all these things are possible. Practically, you actually need to raise a bunch of capital, which is harder in the bitcoin space, because investors have sort of like, or at least before the recent interest, they're thinking of bitcoin as like a digital goal. They're not thinking of that as a app platform or something where people are coming in and building. And the last thing is the culture. If your culture is sort of like rejecting builders instead of embracing it, I think it becomes a hard thing. So those are high level things. At the deeper technical level, I do think that bitcoin being very, very simple.
00:10:46.986 - 00:11:31.832, Speaker A: So if you look at, let's say, the scalability limitations of bitcoin, it's the flip side of bitcoin being more decentralized. So on one side, that's a benefit that, hey, it's very decentralized. You could run it on a raspberry PI. Can't say the same thing for a Solana node or something else, but then it's very hard to scale, and it's the flip side of the same thing. And then you could say bitcoin is very simple and it's very durable, but the flip side is that you can't program it much because it's so limited at the base there. So in terms of l two s specifically, you need certain support from bitcoin, l one, to be able to build the type of roll ups and fraud rooms like arbitrum on bitcoin. And bitcoin, historically, it's not easy to change it.
00:11:31.832 - 00:12:02.122, Speaker A: So I can't be a team that raised a bunch of capital and said, oh, I'm going to propose these changes to bitcoin. And I know in the next six months or a year, they're going to get rolled up. Now. Not going to happen. It's going to take a very, very long time. So what people are doing, and what literally the stacks project did, is that we had a design principle that you could never ask for a change from the l one. So do the best you can, like as a layer, and then maybe in some years, if you need some support from L1, it might happen.
00:12:02.122 - 00:12:35.854, Speaker A: So I think, like, because of those reasons, this is why, like, in some way, there's a market opportunity, especially for developers, you have almost like a situation where there's ton of passive bitcoin capital, actually less competition. Not a lot of people are trying to build there. At least it's changing now, but, but still, like, I think relatively much less competition. But then there are the challenges that are you willing to work with, you know, pretty bad, dev tooling, improve it? Are you willing to get yelled at, like, on Twitter? And, you know, these are you can you, you can see like, you know, what the trade offs are.
00:12:36.194 - 00:13:27.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to get into ordinal ordinals. So for people who haven't been following ordinals of the bitcoin ecosystem this year, this really interesting thing happened in bitcoin, which is there's a person who found this unintended feature from the bitcoin taproot upgrade, and they launched an NFT collection that essentially stored data and NFTs in Satoshis. And I think we're like 200,000 now this year already, or somewhere around 200,000, uh, ordinals. And I think we were kind of paying attention to it saying, like, this is pretty interesting. Like, it felt like this was one of the more interesting things to happen in bitcoin recently. The bitcoin kind of maxi crowd, I would say, was like, pretty upset about this, saying, look, the bitcoin blockchain should not be used for this stuff. Then there's this whole other cohort of people who are saying, no, no, no, this is amazing.
00:13:27.834 - 00:13:50.452, Speaker B: Like, people are building on bitcoin for the first time. And it sparked like, I just got a pitch for a bitcoin NFT marketplace, which looked pretty cool. And there was actually this Chris Berniske tweet, who I really respect Chris's thoughts. He said, well, look back at ordinals as a moment that changed bitcoin forever. And I'd like to get your maybe holistic view on ordinals and how you're feeling about that right now.
00:13:50.588 - 00:14:18.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with Chris. I think it's one of those things where we would look back in history as that's one thing that really changed bitcoin. And the reason is actually pretty, pretty simple. It's the first use case on bitcoin l one that has actually captured attention from the right audience. I'm not saying it has gone mainstream at all. It's still very, very early, but it's getting the attention from all the right parties. The builders are paying attention.
00:14:18.190 - 00:14:51.682, Speaker A: There's a little bit of a gold rush happening where startups are competing over shipping features for Ardnals new artists are coming in. I think yuga labs just announced two days ago that they'll be doing it. And people sort of like, get why bitcoin nfTs, especially on l one, where the image is literally in the bitcoin chain, is valuable. They can see that if this thing cannot be destroyed as long as BTC has any value. So the same reason why my bitcoin is valuable. This NFT is also valuable because it's literally on the chain. And I think that's clicking with people.
00:14:51.682 - 00:15:34.768, Speaker A: So the spark sort of happened, and the rest of the ecosystem building activities that happen, that builders rush in, capital starts chasing that. You can see it happen. And when it's happening, everyone's like, wait a minute, if this really happens, there is a ton of BTC capital, there is a ton of potential activity that can happen. And I think people are seeing what that could be. Because before, I think, as Santay was probably saying earlier, that people have heard this story so many times, like, oh, bitcoin defi is coming, or x is happening, y is happening. And when you dig deeper, I think a lot of them were false promises. Like, for example, even this upgrade, Taproot.
00:15:34.768 - 00:16:05.610, Speaker A: Bitcoin has basically had two major upgrades since the civil war in 2017. One was Segwit. Segwit effectively just compresses your transactions a little bit and you pay less fees because your transactions are now smaller. Taproot is a similar thing. It gives you a little bit more compression and it gives you some privacy benefits because a bunch of the data is now on chain until you reveal it. So you can write slightly more advanced scripts. And it was marketed by the bitcoin maximalist community.
00:16:05.610 - 00:16:39.766, Speaker A: As smart contracts are coming to bitcoin, bitcoin Defi is coming. Every other chain is going to die. That is not even close to the reality, because it's not even a fully, fully executioned environment. It's not an evm, it's not like what developers are used to. It is a slightly more advanced, pretty limited script, and tap launched, and for a year, basically nothing happened. The utilization, if you look at the charts, it was like less than 1% utilization on the bitcoin network. And the bitcoin network itself doesn't get a lot of utilization.
00:16:39.766 - 00:17:13.418, Speaker A: Lots where, you know, empty like a lot of times and then ordinals them. And I think ordinals is very interesting in a couple of dimensions. The first one is it actually hits a valid criticism that bitcoin gets that. How are you going to pay for your security budget ten years later. It's not a problem in the next ten years, but it can be a problem after ten to 15 years. And ordinance is saying, look, bitcoin is the, should be the most valued block space on the planet. And we've already seen like a ten x increase in fees at a pretty sustainable level.
00:17:13.418 - 00:17:45.704, Speaker A: And I think fees might do another ten x or 100 x from here. So you have a clear, clear sort of like story for now. People value bitcoins, block space. That's one. The second thing is that it has actually changed the culture a bit because a lot of people were sort of like, they got introduced to crypto, maybe through bitcoin, but are not spending time in Ethereum or Solana somewhere else. Theyre coming back and saying, ive been in so many twitters business chats where people are like, oh, I had nothing to do with my bitcoin for the last four years. Now, for the first time, I can actually do something.
00:17:45.704 - 00:18:19.154, Speaker A: I can try to do amend, I can participate, I can try to do a trade or something. People are excited. Its almost like coming home. And if you go to those spaces or those conversations, theyre actually drawing much bigger audiences than the bitcoin Maximus crowd. I think thats a very important shift because now a lot of the builders, they wouldnt even get invited to speak at a bitcoin maximalist podcast or a Twitter space. And the conversation were about the same old, like, hey, bitcoin only has 21 million supplied. Never going to change.
00:18:19.154 - 00:19:17.712, Speaker A: How many times can you talk about that? Its actually fresh content, real energy from builders. And theyre now getting airtime. Theyre sort of like, it's like a fork in the community, right? It's a different community and I think that's very, very healthy for bitcoin culture. And the last thing is like actual builders raising capital, running like true startups, not like a lot of projects in bitcoin are, if you dig deeper, it's like one or two people who have an open source project on the side and their ideas and they've been talking about it for five years, right, like, versus a startup can do insane amount of damage, like within four weeks of actual hacking. And I think youre seeing more of those type of people come in and a lot are actually coming from the stacks of our ecosystem because I think for one reason or the other, that ecosystem attracted real capital from sophisticated investors and real builders who know what theyre doing. I think now its their time to shiny. But even on the bitcoin, so from.
00:19:17.728 - 00:19:30.988, Speaker C: A deployment standpoint, do you anticipate this being as contentious as some of the other crises that sort of like contentious moments that the bitcoin network has had in getting people on board on certain upgrades?
00:19:31.156 - 00:19:58.370, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think thats the interesting part. Taproot had already gone live, right. So when people were, were sort of like saying, hey, this is spam. It shouldnt happen. The reply was like, its a valid bitcoin transaction, totally accepted by bitcoin rules. Your node now has a picture of my monkey, and it will be stored there and there's nothing you can do about it in some ways. And then people were like, maybe miners would try to censor that.
00:19:58.370 - 00:20:31.284, Speaker A: And then the miners came out and we're actually making more money. We actually love ardnals because we make more revenue. Our blocks were not full. Now for the first time, our blocks are sort of like running at capacity. So very quickly it became like a thing where people very people sort of like realize that the Maximus crowd, that is loud on Twitter and on podcasts, they actually don't control the network. The bitcoin network is open and anyone can do what they want with it. And I think that's a really interesting realization.
00:20:31.284 - 00:20:46.954, Speaker A: The big difference was that otherwise the proposals that got shot down are typically proposals to change bitcoin. This is just using bitcoin as it is today, and you can just like run with it. You don't need any permission.
00:20:48.734 - 00:20:56.434, Speaker B: So, Muniv, do you think there's any validity to folks who are saying, like, we should censor these transactions because this is not the right way to use the bitcoin blockchain?
00:20:57.014 - 00:21:58.952, Speaker A: I think there are some concerns, so I'll bring the top two ones. One is that people are saying that, look, some sort of, like, well off people in a developed country are storing monkey pictures, while in developing regions where people really need access to hard money, they won't be able to pay the fees. And the answer to that is they would never be able to pay the fees on bitcoin l one, because they should be doing those transactions on the lightning network. And the lightning network settlements should always be important, bigger than important enough, then you can pay the fee to settle the thing on dale one. So lightning is totally separate from that. The only impact on lightning is that maybe your settlements now are a little bit more expensive, but they were always assumed to be expensive because you're doing thousands and thousands of transactions and settling them in one channel close. So that's one argument that I think it sort of appeals to people oh, maybe we should leave the block space open for these use cases.
00:21:58.952 - 00:22:33.584, Speaker A: And the answer is no. There is the lightning network, which is cheap, but everyone should sort of use that. And the second thing is when people start talking about illegal content, what if somebody puts an image off on my node that is illegal in my jurisdiction? And there's a very simple answer. The way these things are inscribed, you could actually prune your node, which is like, you can actually clean things out. You can say that, hey, my intention for running the bitcoin node is because I want to run a full node and you can just prune out that data to be complied in the jurisdiction that you're living in.
00:22:34.364 - 00:22:57.884, Speaker B: Do you think it's safe to say that ordinals. I know you're going to disagree with this. I was going to say that ordinals saved bitcoin in the sense that. And I know you're going to say no, but there's money bitcoin. There's sound money and sound money bitcoin. And then there's innovation bitcoin. And when I hear you say this, I think sound money bitcoin is going just as planned, actually.
00:22:57.884 - 00:23:12.244, Speaker B: I think it's going great. But innovation bitcoin was really dying with ordinals. It's kind of renewed. Bitcoin is this chain for, like, innovation and new use cases and just, like, enthusiasm around bitcoin builders. So I'd be curious to get your take on that.
00:23:12.364 - 00:23:37.454, Speaker A: I'll tweak that a little bit. So my tweak is that there's the money bitcoin, and the builders actually believe in that. So one of the biggest reasons I've been attracted to bitcoin is I really like the fact that it's simple at the base layer and the money guarantees. So I'm part of money bitcoin. I think the camps are a little bit different. They both are believers in, like, money bitcoin. But one camp is the bitcoin, the tool.
00:23:37.454 - 00:24:05.542, Speaker A: Like, people who actually, like, use it, like, literally just even use it and treat it as a technology and an open source project or try to do interesting things with, call it the bitcoin builders camp. And the other camp is people who like the idea of bitcoin. It's almost like a religious thing, right? They don't even care about the tool. Like, they don't even want to use it. They like to talk about it. And I think there's a huge difference between the two. One, community is actually not that technical.
00:24:05.542 - 00:24:42.124, Speaker A: There are a handful of people who are technical in the community. Most people don't understand things that are technical, things at a deeper level. And the other community, the bitcoin as a tool community, those people are not as radical as the other one. And I do think that over time, in the last three, four years, the Maximus community at least started dominating Twitter and podcasts and conferences and the narratives and what ordinals has done is that it has sort of like switched the attention, the spotlight, from one community to the other, which I think is a very, very healthy, healthy thing for bitcoin.
00:24:42.704 - 00:25:12.744, Speaker C: Obviously, Defi was a killer use case for Ethereum for so long. It was just an ICO kind of raising machine in some capacity. Bitcoins serve that as well. But DeFi really launched a whole wave of innovation, and probably to this day, transfers of value are the killer use case of Ethereum. I'm curious how you envisioned the Defi landscape opening up in bitcoin with stacks as an L two. I believe there's over 250 million locked in the staking contract. There was some yield opportunity.
00:25:12.744 - 00:25:28.274, Speaker C: Your tweets referenced over 2200 BDC have gone out on rewards. Curious to understand how that comes from, where the yield comes from, where the rewards are coming from, and more broadly, how the DeFi ecosystem evolves and shapes up in the bitcoin.
00:25:30.534 - 00:26:10.990, Speaker A: I think you mentioned at the beginning that it's a very decentralized ecosystem. The project did a SEC qualified offering back in 2019. And the flip side of that is that because you've done such a compliant offering, you have to be very serious about decentralization as well. So before the mainnet launch, it's a little bit like the original company behind it was dismantled in a way, even though on paper it exists. But the original team just went off and did different things, and now there are like 30 plus entities in the ecosystem. And the current version of stacks, I would say if you try using it, basically has two very big limitations right now. One is around speed.
00:26:10.990 - 00:26:55.334, Speaker A: It runs at bitcoin speed. So you can imagine if you're an Ethereum user or Avalon Solana, if you have to wait ten minutes or 30 minutes for a transaction, you will be pulling your hair. You'll be like, what is this? And it's a security thing, because stacks actually benefits from the security of bitcoin. But the next upgrade, you will be able to do much faster than blockchain in the order of seconds, and so many, many blocks between two bitcoin blocks. That's one thing. I think it's a big limitation for existing developers and users of stacks. And the second, even bigger limitation, by far the biggest one, is that the decentralized way of moving your BTC from the l one into the stacks layer and back is not live yet.
00:26:55.334 - 00:27:17.834, Speaker A: So the different ways that exist right now, if you look at liquid, which is a federation, if you look at RSK, they do something else, merge mining. But the way they move BTC is a federation. So in this day and age, I don't think you can expect people to trust random entities that, hey, we are running a federation, give me your BDC and we will decide.
00:27:17.914 - 00:27:20.114, Speaker C: Max. Federation.
00:27:20.194 - 00:28:00.624, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly. So those are federations at stacks. A lot of, um, you know, focuses on how do we enable a decentralized peg. And that's where some of the criticism for the l two definition comes in. That if bitcoin had opcodes at the l one level, it might in the future, where you could just force the withdrawal of your BTC out of stacks on the l one. I think that's the level of security that roll ups or, you know, fraud proofs like arbitrum have. The next best thing you could do is that there's a decentralized group of signers, a little bit like people who validate Ethereum blocks, and they have capital law, and they need to sign on the BDC.
00:28:00.624 - 00:29:13.782, Speaker A: And so that's the design that the system is called SBDC. And obviously I'm biased, I'm contributing to SBDC. And I think SBDC could be the spark for actual bitcoin defi not the type of claims you've seen before, like how ordinals is to nfts. Because I think it would be a real, actual decentralized system where people can just move their capital into a layer which is fully programmable, and then bring it back in a decentralized way. And I think one other thing I want to quickly touch upon is that then people ask, then how is stacks secured by bitcoin? So the way it's secured is that, especially after the next upgrade, the security to reorg the chain. Like if you, let's say I did a transaction and someone wants to reorg it, say it never happened, that is secured after the next upgrade by 100% of bitcoins hash power. So if someone wants to basically come and reorder transactions, do a deep reorg, basically tries to mess with the chain, theyll have to go and reorder bitcoin, which I think is a great security property that youre sort of like, youre not benefiting from just the $500 billion of capital sitting there unlocking it.
00:29:13.782 - 00:29:31.726, Speaker A: You're also benefiting by all the security of the l one. And then, as I said, there could be opcodes introduced. Actually just one that can enable the decentralized way of taking not decentralized, just the l one way of taking your BTC out of stacks here.
00:29:31.910 - 00:29:56.302, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. Quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're onto app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks research has solved that problem for me.
00:29:56.302 - 00:30:21.614, Speaker D: Our team puts research data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform. So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just bought the platform. I can search for an l one. I can search for a protocol built the platform@blockworksresearch.com. Dot I searched the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way.
00:30:21.614 - 00:30:45.990, Speaker D: Right now you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their Twitter handles today links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform.
00:30:45.990 - 00:31:03.024, Speaker D: If you are ready to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup. Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code. Empire ten got your back. Check out the links in the, in the description to find out more. Now let's get back to the show.
00:31:05.084 - 00:31:25.824, Speaker C: So just, I know, I know we're kind of bumping up until we had like ten minutes, and unfortunately we can't go into that much detail of SPTC. But from a, from a technical standpoint, like, what are some of the key things that need to be resolved that haven't been resolved yet, like over the next six to twelve months? What are the things that you're focused on to make this a reality because it sounds like it's still kind of very much work in progress.
00:31:26.214 - 00:31:56.986, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think my company. So after the decentralization of the ecosystem, I actually raised capital into a new company, trust machines. Last year we raised $150 million round, and we are actually looking to build applications. We are looking to build DeFi and other types of applications on bitcoin. And obviously it's going to happen through bitcoin layers. We also discovered that the SPDC work is very critical, so we don't contribute that much to other stacks infrastructure as a company.
00:31:56.986 - 00:32:17.762, Speaker A: But we have a business interest in making SBDC happen because it's literally required. You can't launch a DeFi application without having SBTC live. So there has been a ton of progress. Right. So the technical designs are basically done. The technical papers came out in December, and it's like a working group that worked on it. We participated in that.
00:32:17.762 - 00:32:42.704, Speaker A: And now some of the early code is even on, like, it's public now. So I think there's enough progress happening. I don't think it will launch in h one of 2023 this year, but I do think it can launch in the second half of this year, which, again, these are open source systems, and you'll see what happens. That's my read of just looking at the progress.
00:32:43.084 - 00:32:53.830, Speaker C: Well, I was just going to ask, what's it contingent on? Obviously, there's a thorough review process and test nets, and there's a methodical way of doing this. But anything else that.
00:32:54.022 - 00:33:24.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I would say most of the technical things are behind us. So there is a clear. The technical stuff has been translated into actual engineering requirements of like, hey, this is the code. People are writing the code. It's the typical things of, like, whenever there's a big consensus level upgrade, a bunch of testing needs to happen. The devs do expect like hundreds of millions or maybe billions of dollars of capital being kept on that code. So I think the security audits and the levels grouping there is going to be pretty high.
00:33:24.374 - 00:34:07.298, Speaker A: But this team has also done this in the past. There have been consensus level upgrades up the stacks before. So one interesting thing about SBTC, it's an asset that's secured literally by the consensus level of stacks. So stacks is sort of saying a big, big change that might happen is, I think, the unit of economy on the apps running on stacks would actually become BTC, which would be sort of, like, welcomed by a lot of the bitcoin community as well. Because what people you're really unlocking BTC capital stacks is sort of the thing you use to lock up your capital and become like a signer. It's incentives, really, for miners and signers. But the thing people are going to use is likely going to be SPDC in some capacity.
00:34:07.346 - 00:34:28.414, Speaker C: This reminds me a little bit of keep. I don't know if you remember this or you remember the project. Madden, the team, there he came. I think from a bitcoin background, from an architectural standpoint, what you just said reminds me a little bit of that. This signers of, is it fair comparison or not?
00:34:29.034 - 00:34:59.262, Speaker A: I think it's fair. There are differences, but I can actually give you an example. This would never happen in Ethereum, but imagine what's happening here. It's like if you took keep the work that they've done, you integrated it into Ethereum's consensus. So it's secured at Ethereum's consensus level. And you said instead of Ethereum, we're going to start using bitcoin as our unit of economy. And bitcoin is the asset that we are trying to secure.
00:34:59.262 - 00:35:20.614, Speaker A: So people are still locking up Ethan consensus and they were earning somehow they were earning BTC rewards. So this is how stacks works. The rewards that people are getting is they're on BTC, right, by four parties betting consensus. It's a massive change. Like, Ethereum would never do this, but imagine that Ethereum posit.
00:35:20.694 - 00:35:21.514, Speaker C: Why not?
00:35:22.054 - 00:35:57.514, Speaker A: I think there is such a large community now who believe in ETA's money. So that's really what it's about. That on the stacks layer side, we believe in bitcoin. So at the core consensus level, we feel comfortable making SBTC a first class asset and just even designing the consensus algorithm to optimize for the security of the SBDC transfers. In the Ethereum world, keep is like one out of many projects just working at the application layer, they're not going to get support, like from core. Each consensus.
00:35:57.814 - 00:36:16.434, Speaker B: Munib, I know we have to wrap this in a second. You are probably the deepest person in the space in terms of building on bitcoin. What is something that feels abundantly obvious to you about what bitcoin is going to look like twelve months from now? That is probably not obvious to most people right now.
00:36:16.734 - 00:37:12.496, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's basically, um, I try to tell people to visualize this, that right now when you go to metamask or some other wallet, um, people are like, hey, I have Ethan. I could swap it to a stable coin. I can buy an NFT, I can lock my heat, start earning a yield on it. It's like, pretty natural bitcoin right now is, you know, there are these clunky wallets, and you can basically just hold it in cold storage. That's what most people do. And I think it's so obvious to me there are already these wallets you should try out, like experts or hero wallet, where your BTC is in a web wallet. You don't care about which layer is helping do this in the background, but you'll be able to swap into stablecoins, you'll be able to deploy your BTC, start earning a yield, like, basically the type of stuff you can do with ETH, you can do with BTC, right? If the writing is on the wall, the wallets are there, that the technology is coming.
00:37:12.496 - 00:37:37.792, Speaker A: But I think it's going to be such a big shift where people will go like, that's the thesis that I have that ethereum is going to scale eventually in L2s. It's all about the roll ups. It's all about, you know, scalability is l two s. Then why wouldn't this network that has $500 billion of capital, why can't it also scale in l two s, right. When the users won't be able to tell the difference anyway? Like, it's. It's about putting it in a wallet or putting BTC in a wallet and then using it.
00:37:37.888 - 00:37:59.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we could go for another hour here. I know we all have hard stops. I just looked at the calendar. The first ever episode of Empire was with you, and it was March 4 of 2021, and this episode goes live March 3, 2023. So nearly exactly two years later. It's super cool to see what you've been building, man. It's really impressive and just big.
00:37:59.756 - 00:38:06.044, Speaker B: Congrats on everything. And I think, santia, I think we have our homework cut out for us. I think we need to do a little, little play.
00:38:06.484 - 00:38:12.132, Speaker C: Let's definitely have bit you on at a later time to really go deep into this, if you're willing to do it, maybe.
00:38:12.188 - 00:38:12.852, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:38:13.028 - 00:38:21.944, Speaker C: As a last question, were you thinking about all of this when we first recorded this episode? Like, when you first came on Empire, was this in the works?
00:38:22.684 - 00:38:51.628, Speaker A: I think a bunch of this was in the works. The exact SPTC design was not. And I think the second lesson that we learned. So I think March is basically when the main event lied, maybe what month or two have passed. The second thing that really hit the ecosystem was we optimized for decentralization so much that the slow speeds and the transaction. Wong, you like there was really, like, people were trying to use this thing and they couldn't. And I think a lot of the work in the last year has been, okay.
00:38:51.628 - 00:39:07.124, Speaker A: We really need to scale this. There is enough demand. People. People want to use these things, but you need to give them an experience that they are already having on an avalanche or ethereum. You can give them such a bad experience where it just, like.
00:39:07.284 - 00:39:26.756, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's incredibly exciting. Thanks for coming on short notice. Would love to unpack a lot of the architectural, technical side of things and, yeah, congrats. I mean, this has been a long time in the making, you know, and I think it's going to be fairly obvious given the amount of capital that's sitting idly there. So, really, thanks so much for the insights. And, yeah, hopefully we can have you on relatively soon to talk about this.
00:39:26.780 - 00:39:32.316, Speaker B: In more detail when you think flip santi. I just watched it happen, 30, 37 minutes.
00:39:32.460 - 00:39:53.708, Speaker C: It's funny, like, like I was when, like, we were early in Defi and, you know, this taproot change and like, this ordinal things like in crypto, I think you're learning to appreciate this kind of, like, chaos theory. Like, very small, subtle changes can have a really big impact and shift the momentum. And I'd be remiss not to, like, appreciate that. And I think, you know, obviously, a.
00:39:53.716 - 00:39:54.332, Speaker A: Lot of people are going to be.
00:39:54.348 - 00:40:32.222, Speaker C: Skeptical because we've been hearing this narrative over and over, but I think this episode really just went through. I wanted to understand the developer mindset and look, at the end of the day, you're right. As soon as people start making money and you solve the security issue of bitcoin, is that the thing that I've been most concerned about and the fact that it hasn't been talked about enough and people don't want to talk about it, and they're like, oh, we'll punt it in the next 40 years. But the reality is you discount back to today and you're like, holy shit, this is going to work. Fees need to come to this network. And I think usability drives value. And hopefully there's a big shift that I'm not 100% sold on yet, but at least I'm appreciating the background and maneuver.
00:40:32.222 - 00:40:33.750, Speaker C: I mean, you're closest to it, so.
00:40:33.822 - 00:41:09.144, Speaker A: It'S great to keep. Yeah, I think. I think a deeper dive would help because here's the thing, right? Like, the way I think about it, that if you go deep and you're having an intelligent discussion about it, then people can see it, right? Like, and I do think that the false promises and in many ways like over marketing that has happened from a lot of the maximist circles, you need to explain that to people as well. But look, these are different communities. It's not like all of us are together. We actually fight with each other a lot actually. I'll wrap up on a funny note.
00:41:09.144 - 00:41:32.960, Speaker A: I was on a podcast with Imran from the Defi alliance. They had a pretty funny video discussing this and they're like this guy, the amount of shit he takes both from the bitcoin crowd and from the Ethereum crowd, it's just insane. And I think I tell my team members that you're onto something. If people hate it that much, you might be actually building something. Yeah, that's really interesting.
00:41:33.072 - 00:41:39.124, Speaker B: That's a good place to end it. We will see you again soon, my friend, and congrats on everything and we'll talk to you soon.
00:41:39.464 - 00:41:40.824, Speaker A: All right, thank you.
