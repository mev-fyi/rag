00:00:02.520 - 00:00:11.702, Speaker A: Right now, you can earn 5.1% on us treasuries. That's right, 5.1% on us treasuries. Not in defi. It's on the public.com app.
00:00:11.702 - 00:00:28.848, Speaker A: We just partnered with public.com for Empire. Super easy to get 5.1% on your us treasuries. You just go to public.com empire, open up a us treasury account, takes like a minute, put your cash to work. You also get access to a whole bunch of other things, like stocks, crypto, treasuries, all in one place.
00:00:28.848 - 00:00:41.404, Speaker A: Super cool. Public.com. Forward slash empire. That's public.com empire. We will talk more about them later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire.
00:00:41.404 - 00:00:47.324, Speaker A: Today's Empire is sponsored by Lufthansa. Is that right, Santi? Is that what?
00:00:48.384 - 00:00:56.904, Speaker B: It may be soon, but I did have the good fortune of meeting a pilot, and he just came up to me and said, hey, are you the guy from Empire? I'm like, wait, what?
00:00:57.884 - 00:01:01.532, Speaker A: So you're walking in the airport and Lufthansa pilot comes up, and after the.
00:01:01.548 - 00:01:15.916, Speaker B: Flight, you know, we're, like, driving in that little Boston. So he was really loud. Everyone looked at me like, who is this random person? So, yeah, it's good. Apparently, people are listening to from all parts and disciplines, so it's great. Sounds like you had a similar experience in Denver.
00:01:16.020 - 00:01:18.304, Speaker A: Just when we thought your ego couldn't get any higher.
00:01:19.244 - 00:02:09.294, Speaker B: Come around. Yeah, to be fair, I will say so I just have last five days at the sort of wedding and, yeah, I don't know if people feel this, but I kind of went through a mini identity crisis where people like, what are you doing? Like, crypto? And then it's like, rolled Ira. You know, we're like, oh, like, how are you doing? Feel sorry for you? Or, you know, they immediately bring up FTX, and it's just. I gotta say, you know, every time gets easier because you have conviction in this space and you go to Ethan. We're going to talk about this episode of how, you know, it doesn't feel like a typical bear market. If you go to these conferences, there's a lot of excitement, there's a lot of teams still showing up. You know, it's not like the scene from, like, antonopoulos trying to explain bitcoin in 2009, right? And there was, like, two people in the room.
00:02:09.294 - 00:02:26.044, Speaker B: This is certainly not it, folks. But still, you know, it. It's difficult at times, you know, when you immediately get saddled with, like, the headline and the worst headline, they cherry pick, and it's like, oh, you're one of those, like, okay, you can sit on that table.
00:02:27.344 - 00:02:30.832, Speaker A: I'm sorry to hear you had a tough wedding, buddy. I'm sorry to hear.
00:02:30.968 - 00:02:32.984, Speaker B: I'm excited to go back home, to be fair.
00:02:33.144 - 00:02:52.006, Speaker A: I will cheer you up. Well, you should have been at eat Denver. Eat Denver was a crazy event. I don't know. I want to think of some takeaways from it, but it was pretty remarkable. And I think the most remarkable thing was just the sheer size of eat Denver this year. I mean, I remember when eat Denver was, like, a couple people in the.
00:02:52.006 - 00:03:06.126, Speaker A: In the little castle, and it smelled like shit. And, you know, the food was awful. And, like, now there were. I mean, there were 30. It's tough to know the actual number. I think the. I think the real number of registrants was, like, 30,000 registrants.
00:03:06.126 - 00:03:39.404, Speaker A: And then the actual number of people who checked in was somewhere around, like, 11, 12, 13,000 people who checked in and eat Denver. Right. They do free tickets, so they got about a third of the people who registered actually showing up to the event. But Denver was nuts. I mean, there was, like, surge pricing, run like, the ubers the entire weekend. Like, there was not a single hotel available in all of Denver. I mean, just remarkable to see how many people came out in this, in, like, the depths of the bear market to this event.
00:03:39.404 - 00:04:08.630, Speaker A: So that was one big takeaway in terms of the content. And the people that I met here were the takeaways on my end. Lot of talk about privacy. Like, a lot, a lot. A lot of talks about privacy, which, if you remember 2018, really 2019, there were a lot of talks about privacy back then. So I do think privacy is making progress, but I will also just be. I'm just cognizant of the fact that, like, deep in the depths of the bear market, privacy is a nar.
00:04:08.630 - 00:04:27.286, Speaker A: Is a narrative that comes back because, like, it's something that we can grab onto. But, yeah, there was, like, privacy. Total ZK mania. I mean, like, Zk roll up, Zk Evm, Zk compiler, Zk bridges. Like, I met. Met your friends at scroll. Like, the scroll booth packed the whole time.
00:04:27.286 - 00:04:31.058, Speaker A: Like, the. They were. They were crushing it. Um, but, like, just.
00:04:31.106 - 00:04:37.626, Speaker B: It was interesting because they. They announced, uh, I mean, the roundup closed. Uh, you know, but they announced it. I think the came out this week.
00:04:37.650 - 00:04:38.574, Speaker A: That they had raised.
00:04:39.154 - 00:04:44.694, Speaker B: So, um, a pretty big headline from some notable investors, Bain, Sukhoi, and others.
00:04:45.514 - 00:05:02.764, Speaker A: There are a lot of great ZK projects there. Like, caliber of talent. I talked to a lot of these teams. Top notch, right? These are like, I mean, the scroll team. Like, bunch of PhD gigabrains, but a lot of the other teams too. Like, and so just zkmania, I'd say it, at e Denver, there was also, you know what I mean? Like, my.
00:05:02.844 - 00:05:05.788, Speaker B: Did I ever tell you my thesis for scroll in, like, one sentence?
00:05:05.916 - 00:05:07.140, Speaker A: No, no. What is it?
00:05:07.252 - 00:05:42.764, Speaker B: I've always found that, like, I'm under indexed, underexposed to China. Like, statistically speaking, there will and should be more high, super high quality projects coming out of China. And historically, you've had chinese founders that live overseas, either in America or in Australia. Like, the stepping guys are chinese, but they live in Australia, but scroll is like, they're based, and a lot of them are chinese. And so really high quality talent. And I've always liked wanting to invest behind a local team. And, yeah, really technical.
00:05:42.764 - 00:05:49.738, Speaker B: It sounds a lot like nervos or neo, but incredibly, these guys are just very, very good.
00:05:49.856 - 00:06:14.326, Speaker A: Neo, the ethereum of China or something. Was that neo? Yeah. Okay. So zks were popping off, roll ups were everywhere. Like, lot of chatter around l two s, particularly around, like, base. Like base, I'd say, had a really good coinbase, had a really good ETH Denver had some really good panels. They had, like, this, like, base hub or whatever that you could go to.
00:06:14.326 - 00:07:07.224, Speaker A: It was the only place where Wi Fi worked in the entire conference center. Also, a lot of discussions around roll up as a service projects, as well as Eigen, Lair and Celestia were in the narrative a lot. So those two I was surprised by, I think those two you would expect to see, but I was surprised by gaming, actually. There was a whole gaming section where you could play these games, and there were these fully playable demos that were really, really nice. I completely forget the name of these games, but I will say I know you're much deeper into games than I am. The quality of these games was night and day from, let's say, 1218 months ago. I know you're in touch with the gaming space, but I think this year we'll see some pretty interesting games launch, just based on my experience with Ethan Burr.
00:07:07.224 - 00:07:39.976, Speaker A: What else is going on? I mean, the name is ETH Denver, so you got to assume there's going to be mostly ETH folks there. But everyone's building on the EVM. EVM was the main place where people are building. I'd say the ecosystem that probably showed up and represented the second best outside of the ecosystem was cosmos. There were a lot of cosmos people, a lot of good cosmos dinners. Lot of folks excited about cosmos there. And like, I don't know, it was interesting.
00:07:39.976 - 00:08:08.460, Speaker A: When you go to these, when you go to an event like this, you ask, you talk to different ecosystems. I think if you ask people about another l one outside of ETH, it's cool. Neither here nor there. You ask people about cosmos, they either love it or they hate it, which is, I think, a good sign for an ecosystem. No consumer use cases, no one talking consumer stuff. No one seemed to care about consumer.
00:08:08.612 - 00:08:11.956, Speaker B: I will. Anything like.
00:08:12.100 - 00:08:27.184, Speaker A: No, no nft stuff. No, I mean, I posted on Twitter, like, didn't meet. I literally didn't meet a single NFT team. People were like, I was there, but I didn't. There was nothing. No nft stuff. So I don't know.
00:08:27.184 - 00:08:30.120, Speaker A: Really good about. Yeah, it's.
00:08:30.272 - 00:08:45.984, Speaker B: If I were to like stack rank, um, the best ETH events, like side events, not like def con East Denver is probably top three event out there. Yeah. Really high quality. Yeah, really high quality. Yeah.
00:08:46.144 - 00:09:14.012, Speaker A: Um, man law we can talk about this week. So we have Silvergate, uh, winding down. We have Coinbase had a couple of big announcements outside of just base. They acquired one river and they launched wallet as a service. There was like Rolekit, Babylon, shared security, Cosmos and bitcoin coming together. So we could talk about that. Maker is reviewing this big proposal.
00:09:14.012 - 00:09:17.664, Speaker A: Amazon's entering crypto GBTC stuff. Where do you want to start? Here?
00:09:19.084 - 00:09:27.460, Speaker B: Maybe we can. It's just so fresh in my mind. We could go with Silvergate and then we can go from there. About works for you.
00:09:27.572 - 00:09:29.424, Speaker A: Cool. Works for me. Yeah.
00:09:30.084 - 00:10:27.636, Speaker B: So I've been following this closely because I was banking with Silvergate and for a long time, people should remember that it's been very difficult historically to bank, to use a bank and get approved. Especially, you're like a corporation. Some individuals, including like Hayden and whatnot, at different points of time, their traditional bank accounts were shut down. There was a time where a lot of banks, if you had sent money to Coinbase, they would just shut down your account and give you a week notice to move your money. And so Silvergate cropped up over the years as a crypto friendly bank. Meltom had a good observation yesterday and she said, listen, every bank technically can service crypto providers, users, whatever. The only hesitation, I think, from a bank is you're going to have more scrutiny from your regulator.
00:10:27.636 - 00:11:26.594, Speaker B: So instead of having every twelve months an inspection which carries cost, there may just rank or ratchet that up to every six months and just make your life a little bit more difficult in the sense that every time there's an inspection, it's more costly. So a bank committee probably assesses, hey, is there enough revenue here for us to actually go into crypto? Historically, in a brazen bull market, Silvergate was doing fantastic. The stock at one point hit 200. Now its less than $2, going to zero, probably. So what ended up happening is they announced that they were going to shut down the bank, and then they determined that it was no longer viable to continue operations, and then assess how they liquidate some of their assets, which include some tax assets and some proprietary tech. This is following last week, where they. I think it was last week, late last week or early this.
00:11:26.594 - 00:12:09.832, Speaker B: Yeah, that they shut down the SaN network, which is super easy way of transferring fiat to crypto. A lot of market makers use this, a lot of funds use this. You know, it's like, kind of instantaneous. If you wanted to move from your Silvergate cash account into Coinbase, like, it was just like fast settlement, and it was very useful from a liquidity flow of funds perspective. And I guess, yeah, it's unfortunate. I think they were a combination of things happen here. They were exposed to FDX, if you remember, in the FDX fallout, the criticism was, if you're a customer of FTX, you were sending money to.
00:12:09.832 - 00:12:59.616, Speaker B: Technically, the account was under Alameda, is my understanding. But then that was the primary on ramp that FDX was using through Alameda. And so it's like, okay, well, why didn't these guys, like, at some point check that? Right? And so there's kind of, like a responsibility to do property diligence. And, you know, that was one of the allegations that, yeah, you know, a lot of folks, including these prominent two short, short sellers, were calling fraud and whatnot and mismanagement. And so that was one big hit. And, yeah, then they announced recently, like, I think it was like two weeks ago or a week ago, that they were delaying the ten k. They had growing concerns around liquidity and solvency of the bank.
00:12:59.616 - 00:13:38.844, Speaker B: Um, and I guess I'll round up this discussion. We can go into more detail to any of those pieces. Is there's a great thread, um, out there on Twitter by this guy, um, I forget his name, but we'll post it. That kind of dissects what happens and what happened to Silvergate and what. Why it got to a position where it didn't have enough, like, solvency. Um, and it's really this idea that there was a massive run on the bank. When FTX happens, everyone is freaking out, especially when you understand that Silvergate had some exposure and that came out.
00:13:38.844 - 00:14:34.284, Speaker B: And so a bunch of funds and users immediately go and withdraw everything from Silvergate because at that point, you didn't want to take any counterpart. So what do you do? Most people, I think they had, like, I want to say, over 8 billion or so of capital just immediately yanked. And so they had a liquidity crunch. They had to sell some assets, and when they had to force sell some of those assets, these are treasuries and short duration kind of assets, they took a big hit on that. And so that loss was what led to the, like, lack of solvency. You got to remember, what always kills a bank and what killed Silvergate and may kill other banks is the mismatch between assets and liabilities. You have all these liabilities when you deposit money into a bank.
00:14:34.284 - 00:15:05.624, Speaker B: That's a liability for the bank. They use that capital to then invest in other things and clip the spread between what they pay you on interest and what they can earn out there, always like this. And they had a liquidity crunch. And so it's important because Silvergate is going to be one of these things that's going to continuously be talked about this year. Next year, it's going to be that example. Regulators, certain, you know, congressmen are saying we should, then this is the problem with crypto. We should limit the exposure to the financial system.
00:15:05.624 - 00:15:40.748, Speaker B: It's a risk like, wait a minute. It's really not like because, you know, exhibit one. Look at what is happening to Silicon Valley bank, which is also having a huge liquidity crunch. It's the same thing. And why is this happening? Well, it's happening because the tech industry, venture business, which they have a ton of exposure to, is also going through a bad, you know, a hard time. And so it's really that idea between the mismatch of assets and liabilities that really hurts a bank. And in this case, the Silvergate.
00:15:40.748 - 00:16:15.054, Speaker B: I would say that there was certainly an element of crypto exposure here that they took in terms of the reputational hit, the trust issues that you had as a bank that, you know, is servicing crypto providers. And of course, the FTX thing really hurt them. You didn't really, at any, like, from a consumer standpoint, you didn't know how big the whole, how big the exposure, how big the liability is going to be define. So all of those things really just deteriorated trust very quickly, and the asset base just really went poof. And when that happens.
00:16:15.674 - 00:17:01.116, Speaker A: Yeah, where does this leave? I think the most. So I think everyone gets what Silvergate does on the banking front, right? They're just a bank that supports crypto. One of the most important things about Silvergate is they had this thing called the Send network, Sen Network. Every single large exchange market maker, investor, Cefi company, use cen for 24/7 instant fiat transfers. So my question to you becomes, you still have BCB Group, you still have signature bank, but signature is facing pretty heavy scrutiny right now. They're only selectively accepting clients. You look at the signature client list, it's like Coinbase, Kraken Circle, Paxos, Crypto.com,
00:17:01.116 - 00:17:24.101, Speaker A: comma, Cboe, bitstamp. I mean, everybody was using them. Where do you go? Where does that leave fiat on ramps. It's just the stable coins now. If you actually look at the ratio of tether to dollar volume, it's at an all time high right now. And I think that's no coincidence. I don't know.
00:17:24.101 - 00:17:38.313, Speaker A: I think it'll be interesting to see without quick fiat payment networks like the SEN network, I think stablecoins just become increasingly dominant form of way to transfer large amounts of volume.
00:17:39.653 - 00:17:46.793, Speaker B: I think so, too. The issue, though, is the conversion of the stablecoin. How do you get new funds in.
00:17:50.333 - 00:18:37.722, Speaker A: Euros and then move in or something? Right? I mean, yeah, here's what this does. Unfortunately, what happens is it everyone needs banking. Every, even crypto companies need these. Crypto businesses need banking out of desperation. We're going to see companies move offshore and we're going to see companies move into riskier banks that are going to end up causing a new suite of problems. It's no different than what happened when Singapore was a Singapore that banned binance and all this, and everyone in Singapore had to move into FTX. When these regulations come down, people end up, people still want to use a product, so they end up pushing further out into the risk spectrum of service providers.
00:18:37.722 - 00:18:39.214, Speaker A: And I think that's going to happen here.
00:18:40.354 - 00:19:11.408, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think there are other banks that I know of that use and still support crypto, First Republic and a few others. But, yeah, I think this is a big. Again, there are. Over the last month or so, there's been a huge. I think, what is crypto Twitter deemed like this choke point operation to really make it very difficult to enter crypto and by cutting the on ramps, this is the choked one.
00:19:11.526 - 00:19:11.916, Speaker A: Yep.
00:19:11.980 - 00:20:01.280, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it'll be really interesting. I continue to believe, look, this is going to be a massive business, the elf, certainly it's got, we're going through a bear market. So again, if you're back and where are all these people going to go? They need a house, somewhere to deposit a lot of that, those assets. And from a relations and standpoint, you know, you could argue that, you know, someone's going to fill that gap. And, and so again, it's, it's important to, to really just make this distinction of, you know, there were certainly some errors, I think, at Silvergate that you could, you know, that are specific to crypto. But there is a. I mean, I don't want to put on my, like, really like, speculative speculation hat here.
00:20:01.280 - 00:21:03.006, Speaker B: And. But there is, like, what, there's a pretty notable short sellers here and there's a very coordinated attack across social media towards segregated some. I mean, it was the most heavily shorted stock out there. And so when you're a short seller, you naturally want, you know, there's always misinformation on both sides. There's always never fully perfect information. But, yeah, it's just important to, like, I think this will be, once all of the facts come out, I think it will be very important to sit down at that point and say, okay, what really went wrong here? Because what I just said earlier is just making the distinction of, there was really a deterioration in trust very quickly that is no different than FTX, the CZ tweet and the article or the tweet and the article from Coindesk and what that can do to very quickly spiral out of control. This happens to currencies, this happens to bonds, this happens to other stocks.
00:21:03.006 - 00:21:06.934, Speaker B: It's just, you know, like, important to keep that in mind.
00:21:08.034 - 00:21:20.826, Speaker A: Moving on. Yes, Coinbase. Coinbase is ripping. Not, not the. It doesn't get enough credibility, but Coinbase is. I. I spent more time with probably the Coinbase team in Denver than.
00:21:20.826 - 00:21:50.064, Speaker A: Than any other team and had a, had a very long conversation with Jesse who, Jesse Pollock, and, you know, moderated a conversation with their vp of engineering will on the main stage. And, man, I'm just. I'm optimistic about things Coinbase is working on. So they obviously had base, the l two announcement. And then since we've talked about it, there have been two more announcements. One is they acquired one river asset management, Eric Peters firm. Eric's been on the show before.
00:21:50.064 - 00:22:12.874, Speaker A: We can link to that episode. You all should definitely listen to it. It's really good. So one river is this big asset manager. It's going to become Coinbase asset management and will form the foundation of Coinbases investment advisory service for institutional clients. And with that, Hugh Jack, I think Eric Peters is actually going to be leading that charge for them. So that's a huge announcement in and of itself.
00:22:13.294 - 00:22:16.074, Speaker B: Does this go after like Bitwise's business?
00:22:19.334 - 00:22:39.604, Speaker A: I don't know bitwise specifically because I think bitwise, you know, a lot of people use bitwise because they have this, like, this index product, but I think it goes after anyone who manages capital for clients. Crypto. Yeah. And it kind of goes after any fund. I think so. Got it. I think it's a really smart move.
00:22:39.604 - 00:23:23.182, Speaker A: I also think their other acquisition was an even, excuse me, other product announcement was an even smarter move. You're seeing them lean into these developer tools and on Wednesday, Coinbase announced their wallet as a service offering. So I just want to. I think this is a, is a really smart move. Basically, wallet as a service is a set of APIs and SDKs that developers can use to basically integrate MPC wallets natively into existing or new apps and the like. I think this specific product is going to help onboard and launch so many new wallets. And we've talked about the wallet wars a little bit.
00:23:23.182 - 00:23:48.198, Speaker A: We had chao come on, did a big episode on the wallet Wars. Uniswap Wallet just got announced. Argent's smart contract wallet with social recovery. I think a lot is getting a lot of attention right now. You have all these new wallets going on right now. One of the things that was interesting at ETH Denver, I met with a bunch of big brands like non crypto, non web, three brands, traditional e commerce brands, really legacy brands. They want to launch wallets.
00:23:48.198 - 00:24:10.434, Speaker A: They all want their own wallet, but they have no interest in building their own wallet and they want their wallet to be tied to existing identity systems. So users can just utilize their normal username and password and that's something that Coinbase wallet as a service is going to let them do. So I think it's pretty genius. I think it's a smart move.
00:24:10.894 - 00:25:07.628, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. They also announced this aggregation with this like NFT wad as well. So they're on a very. Yeah, it seems to me like I was having this thought yesterday and I tweeted about it, which is I don't think Coinbase is getting enough credibility both from Wall street and crypto native people around the contributions doing in the space. And people should go listen to the episode that we had with, with these Coinbase folks around the base announcement. But really impressive to see a firm that is first and foremost very focused on pushing the space forward and perhaps at times having to cannibalize certain parts of their business for the sole purpose of. Look, at the end of the day, when you think about how small the user base is and the penetration of crypto, then if you can, if you don't like 1000 x the user base, then it's not going to matter.
00:25:07.628 - 00:25:30.894, Speaker B: And it's very refreshing, actually. Really kudos to them. Really interesting and exciting to see what else comes out from, from what they're working on under the hood. Because by the way, I mean, they did give us some alpha, right. There's a lot of things that were on the white. We asked them what else is on the whiteboard and why did you decide to do? And they're like, oh, we have a running list of things. It's just like, this is the first part of the sequence.
00:25:30.894 - 00:25:41.984, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, I would probably speculate that there's going to be much more announcements and tools coming out from them later this year, next six to twelve months.
00:25:43.164 - 00:25:51.824, Speaker A: I can assure you there are. I think it's pretty exciting. What's the bear case on Coinbase right now?
00:25:54.244 - 00:26:21.514, Speaker B: Naturally, when you look at what has happened to Silvergate, then I think a lot of people might question, um, you know, kind of that, that their business being hit a lot. Like if, you know, they get all their fees from, they make their money from custody and trading, you know, trading volume is down considerably and you know, maybe the custody asset, the custody piece will have to be separated with new regulations.
00:26:21.554 - 00:26:21.706, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:21.730 - 00:26:24.298, Speaker B: And so you lose that part of the business.
00:26:24.466 - 00:26:25.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:25.594 - 00:26:50.066, Speaker B: Yet you have like increasing like overhead and so the margin profile deteriorates. And so, I mean, this is probably what Wall street thinks. I don't think they've appreciated base and what that can do. And so, I mean, this is the bear case. If you're like equity research analyst, I don't think you fully understand the pieces of coinbase unless you're using kind of like, you know, you're a crypto native person. I don't know. What do you think is the bear case?
00:26:50.170 - 00:27:21.348, Speaker A: I think the bear case is that it's really, really hard to do a lot of things at the same time. Well, and you're like starting to see Google get broken up a little bit by these companies that just take on really specific products within Google. So, like Google Sheets is getting taken on by something like airtable, maybe you could say Google Docs is getting taken on by coda, Google Slides is getting taken on by Prezi or whatever that other presentation.
00:27:21.396 - 00:27:30.348, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But listen, when you think about the 90 plus percent of the ranking at Google, it comes from one and one thing only, because they dominate. No, no, I've never.
00:27:30.476 - 00:27:37.060, Speaker A: I'm just saying that no to absolute. So many products at once, then it can become tough to do so.
00:27:37.132 - 00:27:55.624, Speaker B: To be fair though, I think crypto, like Coinbase has, you know, become synonymous with crypto in, in the US and other places. And that has a huge value. The issue, I think is it's really hard to retain talent in the space.
00:27:56.024 - 00:27:56.472, Speaker A: You know what I mean?
00:27:56.488 - 00:28:11.696, Speaker B: Like if you're a high quality engineer, at some point you leave Coinbase in the same way that you leave Google to build your own thing. Because the opportunity cost and the possibility of really just building on your own is really high.
00:28:11.800 - 00:28:12.520, Speaker A: Yup.
00:28:12.712 - 00:28:31.802, Speaker B: Hey, guys. So while Jason's getting water, I'm going to emphasize one thing which is permissionless. It's coming out later this year, in September. You do not want to miss it. I'll be there and should be really nice set of speakers talking about a whole host of things and great mix of crowd. So get your tickets now and hope.
00:28:31.818 - 00:28:56.406, Speaker A: To see everyone there moving past Coinbase. I just want to be cognizant of the fact that I feel like I'm getting too bullish on Coinbase. So I'm going to think a little more deeply about that. Like the bear case for Coinbase. Maybe we can talk about that in a future episode. Let's talk Amazon. I thought this was a pretty, I mean, big shout out to Michael Bodley at Blockworks.
00:28:56.406 - 00:29:20.398, Speaker A: He's been getting a lot of these scoops on Amazon, breaking a lot of this news. We covered it this week at blockworks. Amazon is working on an NFT offering that could be tied to real world assets rumored to be officially announced in late April. I think if you remember Amazon, they partnered with. Was it avalanche? Avalanche. Maybe I gotta look that up on.
00:29:20.406 - 00:29:27.534, Speaker B: The AWS side of things. I believe so. Cause we recorded the avalanche episode and then the news came out like a week later that they were supporting like on the AWS side.
00:29:27.574 - 00:29:53.284, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. So the AWS team. Yeah, exactly. Is working with Avalanche. I mean, it's nuts. Amazon prime is the most prolific subscription platform out there, right? Gotta be 160 million annual subs just in the US alone. It's rumored that Amazon plans to literally email every single one of them with their digital collectibles initiative once it goes live.
00:29:53.284 - 00:30:12.494, Speaker A: I didn't hear that. They also will have it on the homepage of Amazon. You'll literally be browsing. It'll be furniture, pharmaceuticals or, I don't know, it's on the homepage of Amazon shoes, digital collectibles. So yeah, pretty, pretty crazy to see.
00:30:13.514 - 00:31:19.340, Speaker B: I mean, this is going back to just the brief, like anecdote. Like this is a common thing that I was going back to when people are very skeptical of crypto. I say just look at what's happening with like someone brand like LV, like a group like LVMH, Scott Alexander and like what Tiffany's Don, like, it's pretty impressive that they every, considering everything's going on, like they see the opportunity, right, of when you go buy a physical good and you get a representation in a digital context through an NFT, like it's going to happen, right? And it's really impressive because like, historically, some of these luxury brands really resisted the transition to e commerce. Like brands like Chanel, like up to like two, three years ago were not selling online. And now, like, everyone's doing it, right. Very impressive that a group like LVMH is moving into NFTs and exploring and tinkering into that and other companies like Adidas and a few others. And I think at this point it would be really interesting to go to these conferences where these people meet.
00:31:19.340 - 00:32:26.644, Speaker B: I got to think that this is a common point of conversation around why, because you could make more money from your users and you can keep them more engaged and you could acquire a younger, affluent demographic. Right. And so, yeah, we got, I mean, I can't imagine what this does if all this is to be true. You know, having, imagine everyone on Amazon and Amazon allowing you to set up a wallet super easily and what, you know, from an onboarding perspective, what that does, you know, I wonder what, what they're like, what they're thinking here. Like for, like, you buy something that you get on NFT where there's different tiers of NFT, is that Amazon is creating based on your, you know, how much you're spending on the platform, what are you, what you're doing? Like they're going to partner with other brands and collaborators like the Amazon X, Yuga Labs, like NFT or whatever. What Amazon's really good at is building new business lines, right? I mean, kind of like reinventing themselves like AWS 1.1 from zero to being like the number one process driver for them.
00:32:27.024 - 00:32:41.200, Speaker A: I'm so, I'm so torn on something like this. I'm, yeah, I don't know. I think it's on a private, is it on a private blockchain. Ah, man, I got. I got to read more about this.
00:32:41.352 - 00:32:58.282, Speaker B: I believe that, well, the rumor was that, that they were going to build on immutable x. And so you got the immutable example, decent price action. Again, just a rumor. And maybe they want to just build a marketplace. I mean, just become an NFT marketplace.
00:32:58.418 - 00:32:59.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:00.794 - 00:33:06.970, Speaker B: Who knows? Right? But we'll definitely have more. Something to keep an eye out.
00:33:07.082 - 00:33:18.246, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, everyone, today we're talking treasuries. Right now you can earn up to 5.1% on us treasuries. That's right, 5.1% on us treasuries. I will be honest with you all.
00:33:18.246 - 00:33:41.850, Speaker A: I never really thought about investing in treasuries, and I think probably for two reasons. One is that the yields were always super low, right? 1%, 2%, not that exciting. 5.1% through the public.com app. Kind of a no brainer. Number two is that I don't know if any of you have been to the US treasury website, but it feels like it was built for like 1995 Internet period, not 2023, period.
00:33:41.850 - 00:33:58.138, Speaker A: Super clunky website. Really didn't trust sending my money there. Had no idea how to navigate it. Now, I am super excited to share our public.com partnership. They have made buying us treasuries really easy. You can just move your cash into their US treasury account right from your phone and start earning 5.1%
00:33:58.138 - 00:34:14.294, Speaker A: today. No minimum hold periods, no settlement delays. You can access your cash whenever you want. They have crypto, they have fractional shares of art, other collectibles all in one place. Super interesting platform. Really excited to share them with you. All the way to download this and the way to use it, public.com
00:34:14.294 - 00:34:26.838, Speaker A: forward slash empire. Don't go somewhere else. Santi and I got to get credit for this one. So go to public.com empire. I'm telling you the URL, because we got to get credit. Download the app, move your cash into their US treasury account.
00:34:26.838 - 00:34:57.701, Speaker A: Hope you guys enjoy GBTC. So grayscale just wrap. So grayscale just wrapped up oral arguments and its lawsuit against the SEC for blocking the transition of GBTC into a spot ETF, right? So as a reminder, Grayscale wants to turn GBTC into a spot ETF. Uh, that would collapse the entire discount. The discount sits at like, what, 30% to 40% today. But really, if you think about it, the underlying should probably trade at the same price as GBTC. However, it doesn't.
00:34:57.701 - 00:35:30.314, Speaker A: Um, but if you turn it into an ETF, it probably, probably would. SEC keeps blocking it, but it appears that the sentiment is that Grayscale won this round of the debate. The next step is a final decision from the court here. So, GBTC, I'm looking at the price. It's trading up like 15% to 20% over the last week. Discount has fallen from 45 to 30, it looks like. I think this would be a massive shift in the narrative.
00:35:30.314 - 00:35:57.940, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of steps. I don't know the full approval process, but an ETF approval would be this massive narrative tailwind in the middle of a bear market man. With Gensler in charge, I think it's give it a 1% chance this actually happens. It does seem, it does seem like, like they did win this, this specific lawsuit. So.
00:35:58.092 - 00:36:17.868, Speaker B: Well, this is the thing, right? You have to make. And people should go listen to the episode we have, Rebecca. Right. There's this idea that there's different parts of government that come out when you see these kind of headlines, right? There's the SEC, that they do kind of enforcement through action, but that's not like a law decree.
00:36:17.916 - 00:36:18.076, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:18.100 - 00:36:28.434, Speaker B: And then there's like the interpretation of said law, which is then the judicial system. So in this case, I think it's fairly interesting that the court was.
00:36:30.214 - 00:36:30.694, Speaker A: Very.
00:36:30.774 - 00:37:47.034, Speaker B: Much critical of the SEC decision over time to deny the approval. And so it sort of puts into context, it's one thing for a crypto lawyer to say the SEC is overstepping here and make the argument. It's another to have a judge interpret that which is partial. And it's just more objective to say, wait a minute, let's look at the law. Let's look at, you know, commodities, securities laws here and make a proper assessment and less biased as to the merits of having an ETF, which is, it's very interesting and I think might be, as you say, a, just a, a more objective interpretation of where crypto regulation might shape up and if and when policy does come out. You know, I, I look at this, and I'm, I believe in the judicial system, I believe in rulemaking in a process of keeping in mind what are the more important things of what is missing. You know, and, you know, I do appreciate this idea of calling, like, the idea of, like, securities laws are, are there because you want to have market integrity, you want to protect the consumer.
00:37:47.034 - 00:38:38.512, Speaker B: So consumer protection, market integrity and fairness are the pillars of markets. And if you don't have that, then it's very difficult. You have inside a trade and you have this unfair marketplace, right. For people to transact deteriorates trust. And so if you keep that in mind, then I think it serves as a guiding principle to come up with sensible regulation for crypto and token issuers. And so, yeah, like, very interesting first round of discussion here and I think, yeah, we'll see how this affects possibly the tone of regulators towards crypto. And it really just allows to strip a lot of the noise away and just infer.
00:38:38.512 - 00:38:39.600, Speaker B: Really. Okay.
00:38:39.632 - 00:38:40.272, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:40.448 - 00:38:49.936, Speaker B: How can a court interpret a lot of this? And, yeah, I don't know what an ETF back. Just, if we had an ETF in this current market, it would be good or bad, Mark.
00:38:50.000 - 00:38:54.240, Speaker A: I don't even know if it's worth. I. Medium to long term that, but medium.
00:38:54.272 - 00:38:59.164, Speaker B: To long term, it adds a legitimacy and, you know, allows more people to have exposure to this stuff.
00:38:59.984 - 00:39:16.374, Speaker A: Takeaway from this section of the podcast is I think it's everyone like, there's the SEC and they're like policymakers. There's also a legal system. And I would say this week we've had a bunch of wins for the legal system. Right. Sec lost their voyager case. Right. The sale to binance us was approved.
00:39:16.374 - 00:39:53.964, Speaker A: SEC seems like it's like losing the GBTC case or it's suffering a little bit of a setback. The outcome is still pending there, obviously, but seems like the democratic judges there were surprisingly critical, actually, of the SEC. Seems like grayscale looks kind of likely to win the case now. So that's positive. We're recording this on Thursday. Today the House Financial Services Committee hearing happens where they question the Biden administration's kind of overreach, I would call it, into regulating crypto. Interesting week.
00:39:53.964 - 00:40:20.104, Speaker A: Yeah, there's nothing that's happening. What else happens? Oh, we heard from folks who are kind of inside the ripple case that insiders expect a result, actually. So there's this long running SEC case against XRP, and we heard that insiders expect a result any month now. So that's. I mean, that could be, that could be a really big result for us. So.
00:40:21.104 - 00:40:22.724, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:23.544 - 00:40:53.728, Speaker A: All right, where to next, my friend? There's a quick one on maker that I just want to call out. There's a big proposal going on in maker to extend its existing so US treasury bond investments from 500 million to 1.25 billion, proposal to increase it by 750 million. It's a pretty interesting strategy. We'll link to this proposal. I'd recommend folks go read it. The strategy will deliver a net yield of.
00:40:53.728 - 00:41:13.860, Speaker A: Will move the net yield will deliver a net yield of. I think it's like 4.5% to maker after custody costs, trading costs, et cetera. Yeah, I think it's an awesome proposal. I'm probably going to vote yes on this. So.
00:41:13.972 - 00:41:15.956, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the whole.
00:41:15.980 - 00:41:16.204, Speaker A: Chuck.
00:41:16.244 - 00:41:52.870, Speaker B: Well, other than the. How does this play into, like, the not to get to macro here about the kind of the deficit situation? If, like, isn't there talk? Like, if you have, like. Depends on the maturity of these instruments, but, like, if there's, like, a technical default. Well, like, there's a lot of chatter around that. And if you're, like. If you're, like, having short term, maybe not those, but if you're deposit and you have a CD of six months and at times with the default, isn't that a weird kind of thing you want to avoid?
00:41:53.022 - 00:42:09.654, Speaker A: You do, but. So what we're doing here is the 750 is deployed into the six month US Treasuries. It's a laddering strategy with bi weekly maturities. So I think that helps eliminate some of the risk there.
00:42:10.474 - 00:42:32.718, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, God forbid if we do have this vault. And then there's. I think there's broader issues, but, yeah, to be fair, it's not. I continue. I continue think it's pretty wild that yields and treasury yields are higher than defi yields. So there's kind of no reason to park your money in DeFi protocol.
00:42:32.718 - 00:42:38.270, Speaker B: As much as I love DeFi, when you can click 5% or 5% and try to find.
00:42:38.382 - 00:42:41.314, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think it's a good proposal, though.
00:42:42.054 - 00:43:02.200, Speaker B: Oh, I wanted to mention one thing, Oneplug, because as I was thinking about this is like, okay, if you're going to move your funds out, well, delegate, to be fair, just to make one important here. They announced, part of the announcement said they will repay and honor all of customer deposits. So no one's actually getting burned from a consumer standpoint here, other than, of course.
00:43:02.352 - 00:43:07.968, Speaker A: Did you get your money out? Remember when I called you around the FTX thing? I was like, we were talking about Silvergate.
00:43:08.136 - 00:43:09.288, Speaker B: I didn't take any risk.
00:43:09.416 - 00:43:10.152, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:10.328 - 00:43:20.432, Speaker B: And crypto, I've just learned whenever there's, you know, I get, you know, Soros had back pain, and that was intuition to sell. I just felt it. And here, wait, what is that Soro story?
00:43:20.488 - 00:43:21.184, Speaker A: He had back pain.
00:43:21.224 - 00:43:33.160, Speaker B: There's a great book about Soros. Yeah. Like, he was as much as, like, a technical trader. He was. He said, listen, all my cell signals where I just had lower back pain, and I just listened to my. Listen to that. Sometimes I work other than fit it.
00:43:33.192 - 00:43:38.552, Speaker A: But all these big hedge fund folks trade off the lunar situation. You know that.
00:43:38.608 - 00:44:03.336, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, look at. Anyways, on this particular instance. Yeah, I didn't take any risks. And, you know, the asymmetry, it's like the tale of turkey situation. Yeah, you just don't want to. Considering that I did have some amounts in FTX and it was because I just dragged my feet for a day and it cost me dearly, then I didn't want to take any risk.
00:44:03.440 - 00:44:08.724, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey, what, what did you think of the Muniv episode we did about ordinals and bitcoin?
00:44:09.424 - 00:44:48.734, Speaker B: Yeah, very good, actually. It left me wanting to learn more about what was going on in the bitcoin community. And I then saw the cosmos kind of announcement. I think there's this waking up from the community, both hardcore bitcoin devs and just the bitcoin community at large that is realizing, hey, we have this great security chain and this idle capital. We can do a lot here. There's just so much untapped potential. I think it's very interesting.
00:44:48.734 - 00:45:47.976, Speaker B: We'll see. But very refreshing for me, it's felt like years of rigidity in the bitcoin community, a lot of rejection of what was going on in the ethereum camp, and keeping bitcoin scope to just pure money and kind of a sacrosanct, if you will. The reality is markets always win. And if there's a huge opportunity to make bitcoin, from a fee perspective, a much more lucrative chain, then why wouldn't you do that? I don't think it doesn't subtract from bitcoins proposition. I believe, if anything, it enhances it because we needed something that you and I have talked about in this episode and been wanting to have an episode to talk about bitcoin security model long term. And when you think about the fees that the bitcoin network is raking in, they're de minimis. Most of it is block rewards, which will diminish over time.
00:45:47.976 - 00:46:10.898, Speaker B: And so. Yeah, very exciting. Actually, I want to learn more about this. So there's people out there that are building on bitcoin network and have interesting ideas and proposals. I think it's worth having them on here to talk about it. There's, of course, maybe, I've been seeing a lot of announcements and I think you mentioned this too, of like everyone else wants to build on bitcoin.
00:46:11.056 - 00:46:11.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:11.542 - 00:46:12.846, Speaker B: So we see.
00:46:12.910 - 00:46:56.040, Speaker A: Here's the, here's the, here's the one line of alpha. Right. Anytime in crypto, you have something where it's a complete pain in the ass to buy it that eventually gets eroded away when it gets becomes easier to buy. And there's usually this massive inefficiency or massive asymmetry of opportunity when you have to go through all these hoops to buy something. And I think, I actually haven't bought anything yet or gone through it, but I'm really thinking about it, because just buying ordinals right now is a total pain in the ass, and eventually it'll become pretty easy. Just that alone is a big asymmetry that gets eroded.
00:46:56.072 - 00:47:39.174, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, arguably, you could extend that argument and say, this is why crypto continues to be so early. When people ask me, oh, missed the boat, I'm like, what are you talking about? It's still very difficult to operate in this space, increasingly so now that we've gone back without Silvergate in the equation. So for a long time, you know, it's been a bit of an arbitrage situation where if you're willing to jump the hoops and barbed wire and cross all kinds of, you know, tumultuous oceans and traverse all of that, and then get into the space and set up and learn about security, interact on chain, then. Yeah. Which is interesting on this point, like, account abstraction got announced, and I didn't get. I thought it was gonna get way more attention.
00:47:39.174 - 00:47:47.226, Speaker B: I guess the lesson there is, folks, like, just don't announce stuff all. There's, like, a conference, and people are gonna parties and, like, you know, like, distracted.
00:47:47.330 - 00:47:51.194, Speaker A: Don't ship anything during conference week, or. I love it. Don't announce it.
00:47:51.274 - 00:47:55.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I love hardcore dems. Like, just don't care about any of this, though.
00:47:56.138 - 00:48:05.776, Speaker A: Like, it's just, like, happened last week in Denver. Nobody was talking about it. No. You go on Twitter, everyone's panicking about Silvergate in person. Nobody's talking about it.
00:48:05.840 - 00:48:34.002, Speaker B: So, yeah, you know, just on a more personal note, I feel like during bear markets, the thing that is very comforting is I've spent most of my time now is spent talking to founders and teams. Like, not new teams, like, new projects. I haven't. Like, my pace of deployment has gone down just because I haven't seen that many company. Although I did write one of my largest specs last week, but nonetheless.
00:48:34.098 - 00:48:35.094, Speaker A: What kind of company?
00:48:37.154 - 00:48:49.610, Speaker B: It's like, well, I'll maybe leak out a lot later, but it's. I don't want to, like, it hasn't been announced, but it's. It's related to this entertainment space. So, like, oh, I know that.
00:48:49.642 - 00:48:54.886, Speaker A: I know. Oh, I met with them in Denver out of nowhere. Out of nowhere.
00:48:54.910 - 00:49:02.110, Speaker B: I'm like, how does this, like, massive, like, is think of like, quasi sports exist? I'm like, what?
00:49:02.222 - 00:49:02.582, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:02.638 - 00:49:44.236, Speaker B: I mean, I'm like, I was very surprised. And then the other thing, which is super nice is the founder had actually reached out and back in 2021, and we had worked in, in a year and group, this has been rating Defi summer, and we were in a lot of same groups. And so he reached out, said, hey, I have this idea. I have this kind of quirky asset that I want to build and just run with it. And then we went back and forth a bit and then kind of died off partially because I didn't kind of think much of it at the time. And then, like, two years later, it's grown into like a whole beast of its own. And then I got, like, this other person that I really liked in the space and respect.
00:49:44.236 - 00:50:06.014, Speaker B: He brought me this kind of deal and he said, you got to look at this. And I said, wait a minute, is this the same project? And it was so nice. It's always so nice to see, like, a team that, like, stuck with it and has grown it in what is now. I think it's impressive. And out of nowhere, I'm like, you got to wonder how many of these kind of exist out there. So anyways, really excited about this project. I will.
00:50:06.014 - 00:51:35.954, Speaker B: I don't want to say it now because I, you know, I've talked to the team that hasn't been announced, but we'll probably have them on here to talk about a combination of, like, really leveraging, like, short form content with nfts and, you know, like, no lost lottery ish type of things. So to really have, again, the common you'll see this time and time again. But I think this example will be a case study for how do you really drive customer engagement? This is probably what Amazon is seeing, what Tiffany's seeing, what every single brand in this space will realize is there are certain instruments and strategies that digital ownership uniquely enables to really enhance the value proposition of your product and consumer engagement. Like, I'm not asking you to believe in any of this stuff, but just that concept is very much here to stay, and it will. And when brands are struggling to retain users with churn description, failed payments, this is the argument for microtransactions, stable coins, and some, like, nfts that represent a subscription or represent loyalty. And I think, I think this year will be one where that theme narrative really percolates among more traditional kind of companies.
00:51:36.114 - 00:51:38.974, Speaker A: Yeah, love that.
00:51:40.114 - 00:51:49.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I will. Any outlook for next? Yeah, I was gonna say we haven't done this historically, but things to look for next week or just going for.
00:51:49.754 - 00:52:00.660, Speaker A: Like, well, here's actually something I'm thinking about and looking for and just, like, gonna spend some time looking into. I had dinner with Jason Choi and his partner, Wingarian.
00:52:00.762 - 00:52:02.728, Speaker B: Garn used to be a defiant.
00:52:02.856 - 00:52:06.844, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, he was a defiant with Arthur. Jason was at Spartan Group.
00:52:07.424 - 00:52:08.400, Speaker B: Hello, Jason.
00:52:08.552 - 00:52:30.754, Speaker A: Yeah, he's awesome. And they're both running tangent right now, which is a great, great fund. They were clueing me. They were clueing me in on just, like, Hong Kong is opening back up. So Hong Kong used to be this, like, Og crypto hub, right? Like, BitMex started there. Amber started there. Pre Bahamas FTX was started there.
00:52:30.754 - 00:53:41.054, Speaker A: And I think Hong Kong sat at this really interesting intersection between the west and China. And when China implemented their crypto ban, the general perception was that Hong Kong's days as a crypto hub were numbered. And that was relatively true, actually, because what happened is you had this crypto ban and then you had COVID, where everything really shut down, and Singapore opened up COVID restrictions sooner than Hong Kong did. And you had this mass exodus of talent from Hong Kong to places like Singapore during the COVID lockdowns. Now, though, Jason was telling me things are completely opening back up, both on the COVID side of things, but also on the regulatory side of things, and that folks in Hong Kong are very aware of how strict the SEC is being in the US, and they're seeing Hong Kong is this big opportunity to bring crypto teams and exchanges specifically back into Hong Kong. So that is a trend that I was not aware of until recently and that I thought is something that's interesting and something we should probably pay attention to.
00:53:41.834 - 00:54:37.592, Speaker B: Yeah, I do want to go out there later this year, Hong Kong, and just kind of Shanghai, China is reopening back again, too. And so been talking to, like, the scroll guys and a few other teams that are based there, too. Like Jason from foliage ventures. He's focused very much in that market. And, yeah, if I were to think in, from my personal standpoint, I've always felt that I'm, like, super underexposed because I do think that, like, just statistically speaking, like, population wise, you have to think, for me, Asia has always been ahead of the curve in terms of adoption of, like, you know, think about, like, WeChat and Tencent and, like, their their adoption of, you know, digital first has been a clue and insights into how the world is going to really just kind of progress. And so I think that's still true and they get it out there. Japan is the other market that kind of.
00:54:37.592 - 00:54:56.314, Speaker B: No one really knows about it. So insular, like, they love bitcoin. Like the penetration rates are super high of bitcoin. And I actually made my first investment in a japanese based company recently. So I was really happy to see, to be able to crack that market, if you will. To be fair, I don't think you ever cracked Japan as a foreigner.
00:54:56.394 - 00:54:59.186, Speaker A: Was it the l one that we was at Astronetwork?
00:54:59.290 - 00:55:01.946, Speaker B: No, no, not at all. It's like an exchange.
00:55:02.050 - 00:55:02.690, Speaker A: Oh, nice.
00:55:02.802 - 00:55:09.204, Speaker B: It's an exchange. Yeah. So anyways, anything else, sir?
00:55:10.864 - 00:55:33.440, Speaker A: No, I have a prediction to make, which is that. So Alex Thorne, Galaxys research team put out a really good report on ordinals. We should invite Alex on the podcast and talk about ordinals. Actually, I think hes the right person to do this. I think someone will propose a stable coin on bitcoin. Like a bitcoins stablecoin. In the coming weeks.
00:55:33.440 - 00:55:42.080, Speaker A: With, with all the crackdown around Silvergate, stable coins, ordinals popping off, I think there's going to be a bitcoin stable coin that ends up taking off like.
00:55:42.112 - 00:55:44.280, Speaker B: Fully like collateralized by bitcoin.
00:55:44.312 - 00:55:51.032, Speaker A: Don't know what it looks like. Don't know if it's like a USDC type product on bitcoin. Don't know if you make or collateralized by bitcoin. Don't, don't know.
00:55:51.088 - 00:56:35.838, Speaker B: Oh, it's interesting on this thread, like people forget, but like this is what really made ethereum kind of in many ways. Like really take off. After the ico kind of craziness died down, Maker, you needed to have a central bank. And the idea of parking your collateral like ETH and then minting die was pretty, I mean, to this day is a working experiment and it was the backbone for Defi and it was just like it, it was dormant for a long time and then that all. Without Maker, you couldn't have had anything. I don't think we would have been nearly as far where we are today as. Yeah, and yeah, like why couldn't you just deploy a maker type like sucker bank on bitcoin, right.
00:56:35.886 - 00:56:36.614, Speaker A: Oh, good idea.
00:56:36.654 - 00:56:42.862, Speaker B: You park your bitcoin. Bitcoin's been fairly stable ish. And you meant something like a die.
00:56:42.998 - 00:57:14.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I will end it with a, with a tweet or a LinkedIn post or something that I saw somewhere, which was that I just liked. It's clickbaity, but I liked it. It was just. No, it's talking about how every ten years there's a new platform that people use. It was like desktop in 1995, cell phone in 2005, like mobile in 2005, applications in 2015, and then ten years later, 2025. Wallets is the new platform.
00:57:15.824 - 00:57:19.176, Speaker B: Well, certainly relevant with Coinbase.
00:57:19.280 - 00:57:19.752, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:19.848 - 00:57:28.616, Speaker B: Announcing that, and I will extend that prediction, say, probably Coinbase is the number one wallet provider in the next two years.
00:57:28.800 - 00:57:43.164, Speaker A: I'm trying to extend this podcast because I'm trying. There's one more thing I wanted to talk about, but I. But I'm forgetting it, so it's going to come to me, right? Oh, I was supposed to. We are hiring. We have new open roles at blockworks. That's what I was supposed to. All right, hold on, I got to give a plug.
00:57:43.164 - 00:57:55.736, Speaker A: Hold on, hold on. All right. We have open roles. A bunch of people eat Denver were asking if we're hiring. We are hiring. We have reporters. Open worlds for like, reporters and journalists.
00:57:55.736 - 00:58:11.684, Speaker A: We're hiring senior full stack engineers. Come work on our protocol, governance, data and research platform. We're hiring an accounting lead. Very exciting role. We are hiring a VP of sales and we are hiring account execs, brand partners. So come work at blockworks. Come work with Santee.
00:58:12.734 - 00:58:29.534, Speaker B: I was gonna say, like, do you consider me part of block works or like, I'm in this, like, freelancer, podcaster. Maybe I should just tell people I work for blockworcing these events. Like, you know, like, what do you do? I work in a media company. That must be. But maybe I'll just adopt this tagline.
00:58:29.574 - 00:58:43.462, Speaker A: Now, there's two titles that you could go with, extraordinaire or institutional, or institutional angel. And, uh, I think one sounds a little better than the other. So I think definitely the first one. Definitely the first one.
00:58:43.598 - 00:58:58.302, Speaker B: Extraordinary extraordinaire. Shout out to Falza pilot that continues to play and listen to empire. Hopefully not while in flight, but maybe you'll see empire in one of these, like, you know, like, you can watch them.
00:58:58.398 - 00:59:06.740, Speaker A: Oh, no. Garrett's. Garrett and Will. We have two podcast producers. Shout out, Garrett will. They're working on getting Empire inside of airplanes. So it's a toy.
00:59:06.852 - 00:59:11.996, Speaker B: I always tell folks, listen, you either love this or it's free melatonin. Either way, you're winning on this long.
00:59:12.100 - 00:59:21.332, Speaker A: Well, there you go. Anyways, folks, sorry that you have to put up with listening to Santa and I twice a week every week. But we appreciate you, and we will see you all next week, and we'll keep doing it.
00:59:21.348 - 00:59:25.044, Speaker B: So, you know, anyways, let us know how we can get better and see your permissionless.
