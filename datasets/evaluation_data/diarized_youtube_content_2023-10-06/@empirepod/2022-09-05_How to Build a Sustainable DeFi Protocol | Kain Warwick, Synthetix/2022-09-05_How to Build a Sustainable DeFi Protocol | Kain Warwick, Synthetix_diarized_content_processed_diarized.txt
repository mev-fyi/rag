00:00:00.240 - 00:00:02.430, Speaker A: Uber has this network of people that.
00:00:02.462 - 00:00:12.726, Speaker B: Go out and provide a service, and then Uber captures some of the fees, and the people who provide the service captures some of the fees. And there's this tension between the two. And we've seen that play out where.
00:00:12.750 - 00:00:17.182, Speaker A: Drivers want more money. So LP's and uni token holders, who's.
00:00:17.238 - 00:00:29.228, Speaker B: Collectively the company, are going to have to play this game of how much do we want? Because ultimately, if the unitoken doesn't accrue any fees and uniswap, you know, as a. As a collective, doesn't accrue any fees.
00:00:29.356 - 00:00:33.944, Speaker A: Then, you know, on some level, it's not really sustainable what they're doing.
00:00:38.524 - 00:00:57.892, Speaker C: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Santi is sitting this one out. We got my co founder, Mike Ibalido joining us, and then we are joined by the semi benevolent dictator, or should I say former semi benevolent dictator of civilization, synthetics. Kane, I don't know what you are describing yourself as these days, but either way, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:00:58.028 - 00:01:02.384, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks so much. I guess it depends on who you ask, whether it's former or current.
00:01:03.204 - 00:01:07.868, Speaker C: So the former or current is who you ask. But semi benevolent dictator is true, though. Yes.
00:01:07.916 - 00:01:08.652, Speaker A: I think that's fair.
00:01:08.708 - 00:01:09.340, Speaker B: I think that's fair.
00:01:09.372 - 00:01:09.988, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:10.156 - 00:01:12.064, Speaker C: Nice. How'd you get the nickname?
00:01:13.644 - 00:01:23.506, Speaker A: I used to be just like the dictator and not even benevolent. And then I think we got to a point where we were like, okay.
00:01:23.570 - 00:01:28.106, Speaker B: You know, we need to decentralize things and give up power to the community.
00:01:28.290 - 00:01:30.894, Speaker A: And, you know, we started that process.
00:01:31.554 - 00:01:33.026, Speaker B: And I think people are like, wait.
00:01:33.050 - 00:01:35.122, Speaker A: A second, like, you know, you're very.
00:01:35.178 - 00:01:46.602, Speaker B: Aggressively kind of advocating for certain positions and you're arguing with people. You know, this is not necessarily what we were expecting. You know, giving up power. And my argument was, well, you know.
00:01:46.618 - 00:01:47.698, Speaker A: If you give up power and you.
00:01:47.746 - 00:01:50.082, Speaker B: Create a process where anyone can, you.
00:01:50.098 - 00:01:51.114, Speaker A: Know, have a voice, right.
00:01:51.154 - 00:01:55.258, Speaker B: Then I should be able to have my own voice and my own opinions and my own perspective.
00:01:55.306 - 00:01:59.458, Speaker A: And that's, you know, gone. Gone fairly well, I think.
00:01:59.506 - 00:02:03.974, Speaker B: But there's some people who sometimes get a bit annoyed about how vocal I am about certain things.
00:02:04.594 - 00:02:44.756, Speaker C: I think things have gone all right, though, so well, we've come a long way since the dictator days of 2018 and 2019 and depths of the bear market. You have this idea about, like, just different metrics that matter in different bull markets. So if you look at icos, the metric that, like, 2017 and, like, just the market ripping, then the metric that mattered was how much money can you raise, right. Then it's like DeFi summer 2020, the number that matters is really total value locked is TVL. And I've heard you talk about the metric that will matter. It doesn't maybe matter as much now, but you think it will matter. And we can maybe meme this into existence is fees, right? So I'd love to just maybe kick off this conversation starting with that idea.
00:02:44.940 - 00:03:17.682, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, it's interesting actually. I had a pretty prominent person in my DM's last night in the crypto space who was like, oh, token terminal kind of shows. You guys are throwing off quite a lot of fees, like what's going on there? And we got into a bit of a discussion about it. And, you know, it's interesting because I think TVL sounds like a metric that is, I guess, fairly fungible, right? Like TVL and curve and TVL and synthetix. But the reality is that TVL, you.
00:03:17.698 - 00:03:21.170, Speaker B: Know, is a very blanket term for a lot of different things, right?
00:03:21.242 - 00:03:33.674, Speaker A: There's things, you know, there's TVL that's in like, you know, staking, like single sided staking pools, which, you know, is one thing. This, you know, stable coin pools have TVL. So when you look at TVL, it's.
00:03:33.714 - 00:03:37.270, Speaker B: Not like this kind of homogenous thing, right? I think.
00:03:37.462 - 00:03:44.166, Speaker A: And that makes it easy to gain because if you can boost cheap TVL, which is low risk, right, you can.
00:03:44.190 - 00:03:46.006, Speaker B: Make things look better than they are.
00:03:46.070 - 00:03:46.998, Speaker A: And I think that there were a.
00:03:47.006 - 00:03:50.714, Speaker B: Lot of those kind of games that were played back in the TVL days.
00:03:51.254 - 00:03:52.598, Speaker A: And then over time, people get a.
00:03:52.606 - 00:03:57.854, Speaker B: Bit more sophisticated and they're like, okay, we can see that this protocol has.
00:03:57.934 - 00:03:59.086, Speaker A: Certain things, and I think we'll see.
00:03:59.110 - 00:04:01.182, Speaker B: That play out with fees as well.
00:04:01.358 - 00:04:02.934, Speaker A: Because when you look at fees for.
00:04:02.974 - 00:04:07.610, Speaker B: Synthetics, let's say, and even if you compare it to uniswap.
00:04:07.722 - 00:04:24.250, Speaker A: So Uniswap generates the most fees of any defi protocol by like a pretty significant margin. But it doesn't pay any fees to token holders, right. It doesn't pay any fees to the protocol. It only pays fees to liquidity providers, which is fine.
00:04:24.282 - 00:04:26.374, Speaker B: You know, liquidity providers are doing a thing.
00:04:28.074 - 00:04:29.802, Speaker A: Whether, you know, whether and when the.
00:04:29.818 - 00:04:32.434, Speaker B: Fee switch gets switched on will be.
00:04:32.594 - 00:04:34.130, Speaker A: A pretty significant change, right?
00:04:34.162 - 00:04:36.210, Speaker B: Because once the fee switches on, then.
00:04:36.282 - 00:04:38.362, Speaker A: You as a uni token holder are.
00:04:38.378 - 00:04:42.106, Speaker B: Going to get some kind of field and you can do calculation and what have you.
00:04:42.130 - 00:04:45.682, Speaker A: So even within those two protocols that.
00:04:45.698 - 00:04:56.602, Speaker B: Are in the top ten, synthetix is very different because your risk profile and risk adjusted return is different. And the same thing goes for Uniswap as well.
00:04:56.698 - 00:04:59.178, Speaker A: If you're an LP in a stable.
00:04:59.226 - 00:05:02.774, Speaker B: Coin pool, as long as it's not ust you're probably okay.
00:05:04.674 - 00:05:16.590, Speaker A: If you're an LP in with some random shitcoin, well, then your Il risk is going to be very high. So even within different kind of fee.
00:05:16.622 - 00:05:19.878, Speaker B: Metrics, the risk adjusted return is very different.
00:05:19.926 - 00:05:20.958, Speaker A: So I think that this is something.
00:05:21.006 - 00:05:24.474, Speaker B: That collectively you have to get more sophisticated about.
00:05:25.054 - 00:05:27.742, Speaker A: But luckily, I think Tradfi has spent.
00:05:27.758 - 00:05:37.334, Speaker B: A lot of time working out how to calculate risk adjusted returns, things like that. So hopefully we can take some of the good stuff of that and translate it to defi.
00:05:37.794 - 00:05:48.506, Speaker D: Kane, I have a question for you. What do you think will be the determining factors for protocols that are capable of commanding fees versus ones that don't or aren't capable of commanding those fees?
00:05:48.610 - 00:06:03.392, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we still don't have good frameworks for even reasoning about this yet, because every protocol is kind of so different and has like all of.
00:06:03.408 - 00:06:14.324, Speaker B: These idiosyncratic kind of challenges, right? In terms of like how you think about fees and how they're earned and who earns them and where do they go and how they're distributed, all of that stuff.
00:06:14.624 - 00:06:16.808, Speaker A: So, you know, I think my sense.
00:06:16.856 - 00:06:18.712, Speaker B: Is that like, again, if you look.
00:06:18.728 - 00:06:37.052, Speaker A: At something like uniswap, you know, if they switch on fees, how. How much of the fee yield do you need to transfer to uni token holders? Because it's a zero sum game, right? You're taking fees from LP's. How impactful is that to LP's that.
00:06:37.068 - 00:06:45.012, Speaker B: Are trying to do the thing. There's a service that's being provided, which is liquidity, and you're paying the people.
00:06:45.068 - 00:07:10.450, Speaker A: Who are providing the service 100% of the revenue. It's an interesting concept. It's very different to a business. A business, you know, kind of turns up, provides a service and captures 100% of, you know, it's probably the closer analogy, something like an Uber, right? So, you know, Uber has this network of people that go out and provide a service, right? And then Uber captures some of the.
00:07:10.482 - 00:07:18.442, Speaker B: Fees, and the people who provide the service capture some of the fees. And there's this tension between the two and, you know, we've seen that play out, right, where drivers want more money.
00:07:18.498 - 00:07:20.610, Speaker A: And, you know, so LP's and uni.
00:07:20.642 - 00:07:31.816, Speaker B: Token holders, who collectively the company are going to have to play this game of how much do we want? Because ultimately, if the uni token doesn't accrue any fees and Uniswap as a.
00:07:31.840 - 00:07:38.564, Speaker A: Collective doesn't accrue any fees, then on some level it's not really sustainable what they're doing.
00:07:38.984 - 00:08:10.196, Speaker C: But why can, why now? So you say it's not sustainable. And I think what you're getting at is if all we're doing, if we're not actually giving, if we don't have this nice cycle and this nice feedback loop here and we're not actually spitting back cash flows, then like, what are we all almost doing here? But if you look at Uber, Uber has been around for 13, 12, 13 years. Founded in like 29, 2010. I feel like, I mean, I'm in Manhattan right now. It used to be $5 rides anywhere in Manhattan. Now it's 40, 50, $60. But only in the last like year or two did, did that change really happen.
00:08:10.196 - 00:08:27.120, Speaker C: So, and like, when you look at things like Uniswap, it's like, really only have they had a lot of volume for, let's call it two years. So it's like, why can't we just almost keep subsidizing this stuff in the way that like Uber and Airbnb and Lyft and all of them subsidized it for nearly a decade?
00:08:27.312 - 00:08:31.600, Speaker A: So I think, you know, at a fundamental level, it's okay to subsidize things.
00:08:31.632 - 00:08:33.104, Speaker B: To bootstrap them, right?
00:08:33.224 - 00:08:35.152, Speaker A: I think we took the idea of.
00:08:35.168 - 00:08:38.084, Speaker B: Like blitz scaling and subsidizing and whatever.
00:08:38.664 - 00:08:46.904, Speaker A: To a degree that was probably unsustainable. Right. And how did we do that? Well, we had this crazy, you know.
00:08:46.944 - 00:08:49.644, Speaker B: Asset bubble based on money printing that was inflated.
00:08:49.684 - 00:08:55.980, Speaker A: And so VC's had infinite amounts of money to dump into companies to allow.
00:08:56.052 - 00:09:00.964, Speaker B: Them to unsustainably grow or unsustainably subsidize.
00:09:01.124 - 00:09:22.702, Speaker A: Services until they did. And I think now we're kind of seeing the end of that party. So ultimately, then the question is, ok, at what point can a business like Uber kind of become sustainable? Right? And at what point should it become sustainable? My view is like, you realistically should try and become as sustainable as you.
00:09:22.718 - 00:09:24.582, Speaker B: Can as soon as you can, right?
00:09:24.758 - 00:09:26.574, Speaker A: Obviously there's, you know, there's definitely a.
00:09:26.614 - 00:09:27.686, Speaker B: Payoff curve there, right?
00:09:27.710 - 00:09:28.502, Speaker A: And you don't want to do it.
00:09:28.518 - 00:09:30.990, Speaker B: Too early because you could have scaled much larger.
00:09:31.022 - 00:09:33.230, Speaker A: But I, the reality is I think.
00:09:33.262 - 00:09:39.478, Speaker B: Uber could have absolutely, you know, switched that if they didn't have VC's pouring money into them, they absolutely could have.
00:09:39.606 - 00:09:46.284, Speaker A: The vision fund alone, right. Subsidized billions of dollars worth of low cost rides.
00:09:47.064 - 00:09:48.844, Speaker B: When you ask the question of Defi.
00:09:50.104 - 00:09:59.984, Speaker A: DeFi is supposed to be more efficient. It's supposed to be less overheads. All this stuff. If Uniswap and Synthetix and AavE and compound have been around for three, four.
00:10:00.024 - 00:10:05.208, Speaker B: Five years, in some cases, can't get to a point where we start to become sustainable.
00:10:05.256 - 00:10:06.232, Speaker A: I'm not saying we have to be.
00:10:06.288 - 00:10:08.640, Speaker B: 100% sustainable today, but we start that.
00:10:08.672 - 00:10:11.406, Speaker A: Process, then we're kind of just playing.
00:10:11.430 - 00:10:24.314, Speaker B: The same game, right, that we've seen a bunch of SaaS companies and other companies play for the last ten years, which I just don't think we need to play anymore. I think we really can get to a point where.
00:10:25.054 - 00:10:38.062, Speaker A: So, like, a company that's starting today, or project that's starting today, go nuts, subsidize, raise money, whatever. Uniswap and synthetix and the blue chip defies have been around for four years.
00:10:38.078 - 00:10:40.154, Speaker B: Like, we kind of got to get serious now.
00:10:40.474 - 00:11:07.884, Speaker D: Do you think the ability to fork, just the fact that everything's open source cord or open source code in crypto is different? It's like, because the example of Uber, right. Basically the VC model is just fundamentally what you want to do is you want to subsidize, subsidize, subsidize. At the end of the day, what you want is a monopoly. So that finally, when you do jack the prices back up, no one's left to compete with you. But in crypto, you have the option to fork. So do you think that's a fundamentally different dynamic that limits the ability to compete with that same strategy?
00:11:07.994 - 00:11:16.264, Speaker A: So it's interesting because, like, this idea of forking and fees and everything was like a huge discussion topic, theoretical discussion topic, during the last bear market, right?
00:11:16.304 - 00:11:18.832, Speaker B: Because we were all bored and we come up with something.
00:11:19.008 - 00:11:20.200, Speaker D: Just want to talk about shit.
00:11:20.272 - 00:11:29.040, Speaker A: Yeah, we have to talk about some dumb thing, right? So, like, I think, you know that, like, is the topic for, like, every Thursday for, like, you know, a year or something. It's like, no, but you can't do.
00:11:29.072 - 00:11:30.544, Speaker B: This because it'll get forked or whatever.
00:11:30.664 - 00:11:32.992, Speaker A: I don't think. And again, I might be wrong, right?
00:11:33.048 - 00:11:40.384, Speaker B: Even maybe that, like, anti Justin sun fork. I can't remember the name of the.
00:11:40.504 - 00:11:43.584, Speaker A: Protocol, but, like, you know, I don't know how that's going now, though.
00:11:43.624 - 00:11:45.844, Speaker B: The one that forked and took all his tokens away.
00:11:48.744 - 00:11:53.200, Speaker A: I'm having a drawing blank on the name of it. But, you know, it was a project that had been around for, like, five years.
00:11:53.232 - 00:11:55.604, Speaker B: Justin sun bought it and took it over.
00:11:55.984 - 00:12:01.312, Speaker A: Like, I don't know how that fork is going. Right? Like, maybe fine, but there's not many.
00:12:01.368 - 00:12:04.780, Speaker B: Good examples out there of protocols that have been formed.
00:12:04.852 - 00:12:16.964, Speaker A: Right. I think the expected effort of maintaining a protocol that people had back in 2017, 2018 that, like, oh, it's just some code you deploy then walk away, has been kind of invalidated.
00:12:17.004 - 00:12:17.156, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:17.180 - 00:12:18.396, Speaker A: Like, you need a community.
00:12:18.500 - 00:12:21.076, Speaker B: You need people who are, you know.
00:12:21.140 - 00:12:24.068, Speaker A: Maybe they're not doing this in like a centralized fashion.
00:12:24.116 - 00:12:27.356, Speaker B: Maybe it's kind of, as I said, with uniswap, like a loose collective of.
00:12:27.380 - 00:12:32.750, Speaker A: People that's advocating and educating, whatever. But if you remove that, you know.
00:12:32.902 - 00:12:37.558, Speaker B: The momentum drops significantly, I think is my, is my view.
00:12:37.606 - 00:12:39.430, Speaker A: So I think the idea of forking.
00:12:39.462 - 00:12:45.150, Speaker B: To remove fees is more of a theoretical construct than it's like a practical concern.
00:12:45.262 - 00:13:45.464, Speaker D: Do you think there's a, this is kind of multi coins theory? So I'm going to try to paraphrase basically, but I kind of do like, yeah, I know, but the idea of like, managing risk as an ability to fork your protocol, so, like, Uniswap with like an exchange model, you're not managing any financial risk there. You're just connecting buyers and sellers. So the idea is that you could fork an exchange and just offer higher subsidies essentially on this new fork, and you might get a bunch of mercenary liquidity. There's less of a moat, whereas something like maker or something like that. Really what the moat is there is that you're underwriting risk and it's like, okay, I can fork maker tomorrow, but are all of these units going to come along with me and maintain all of that competence and that balance sheet? Probably less so. So I'm wondering if even within, because I tend to agree with you, it's like, I don't think you can just keep forking the nth iteration of a thing and expect people to follow. But I wonder if even within different classes of DeFi protocol, maybe like managing a balance sheet or managing some risk yourself is also more of a moat.
00:13:45.764 - 00:13:51.756, Speaker A: I actually think there are a lot more moats than people realize. And my assumption around that argument is.
00:13:51.780 - 00:13:55.180, Speaker B: That Kyle had funded some maker competitor.
00:13:55.372 - 00:14:02.084, Speaker A: The day before, was coming out with some psyops campaign to justify the investment or whatever. But I think.
00:14:02.124 - 00:14:03.144, Speaker D: What do you think about multi.
00:14:04.964 - 00:14:05.228, Speaker B: You.
00:14:05.236 - 00:14:08.860, Speaker A: Know, look, I'll actually say this right? Like, I will, I will, you know.
00:14:08.892 - 00:14:17.116, Speaker B: And I don't know if I've said this publicly, because I've had a number of debates with Kyle, and you know, kind of had had some interactions with them on Twitter.
00:14:17.220 - 00:14:22.028, Speaker A: I've actually recommended them to a number of funds of like, funds of funds.
00:14:22.116 - 00:14:28.052, Speaker B: For whatever reason, they somehow got me on their Rolodex and they, they ping me every once in a while to.
00:14:28.068 - 00:14:29.348, Speaker A: Be like, hey, we're thinking about, you.
00:14:29.356 - 00:14:34.024, Speaker B: Know, making an investment into this crypto hedge fund or this one or whatever. What do you think?
00:14:34.104 - 00:14:51.560, Speaker A: And I've actually never not recommended multicore because I think that multicoin is super opinionated. I think they're wrong. But if you want exposure to, like, certain areas of crypto, if you just go down like this maxi pass, if you're path, if you're a fund, you.
00:14:51.592 - 00:14:56.480, Speaker B: Want exposure to people that are kind of maybe a bit counterintegrative thinking, whatever.
00:14:56.512 - 00:14:59.044, Speaker A: So I actually think multicoin is fine.
00:14:59.464 - 00:15:03.164, Speaker B: But tactically, I don't agree with some of the things that they do, but.
00:15:03.624 - 00:15:17.804, Speaker C: Not throw on a random tangent about funds. Kane. But who do you think? Who, who? Someone's like, I'm either I'm raising capital for three fund from three funds, or I'm allocating to three funds. Who are like, the best. Who are your favorite funds in crypto right now?
00:15:18.104 - 00:15:26.568, Speaker A: I mean, obviously got a lot of love for a framework, right? You know, they kind of turned up in the bear market. You know, we're one of the first.
00:15:26.616 - 00:15:29.816, Speaker B: Funds to really get behind synthetix, like post pivot and everything.
00:15:29.880 - 00:15:33.122, Speaker A: So, you know, we, we obviously have.
00:15:33.178 - 00:15:39.202, Speaker B: Grown up a lot since then and, you know, not as connected to them as we were back in the day.
00:15:39.218 - 00:15:40.778, Speaker A: But I still, you know, I actually.
00:15:40.826 - 00:15:49.506, Speaker B: Had Michael on my mentorship program last week, so, you know, we keep in touch pretty regularly.
00:15:49.530 - 00:15:56.386, Speaker A: So framework, I think, are great. And then it, from there, it kind of depends on what you're doing and.
00:15:56.530 - 00:15:59.132, Speaker B: Who, you know, you like.
00:15:59.188 - 00:15:59.948, Speaker A: I don't want to go and show.
00:15:59.996 - 00:16:00.972, Speaker B: Some of the funds that I'm an.
00:16:00.988 - 00:16:03.916, Speaker A: LP in, but, like, you know, realistically.
00:16:04.020 - 00:16:10.076, Speaker B: If you're super early stage, there's some funds that are too big for you. You want people that are more like angels.
00:16:10.140 - 00:16:12.996, Speaker A: So, like, for early stage, like a.
00:16:13.100 - 00:16:25.338, Speaker B: Company or a project, raising the first round, my view is always like, try and get as many angels in as you can and then find, like, a fund that you think is high conviction in that space and will kind of come with your journey.
00:16:25.506 - 00:16:30.294, Speaker C: Let's get back to Mike's. I want to get your answer to Mike's multicolin question, though.
00:16:30.674 - 00:16:32.890, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. What was the, what was the question I got?
00:16:32.922 - 00:16:40.938, Speaker D: It was just about, like just within different models, right? Like the ability, like managing risk, like kind of balance sheet risk and having like, just moats around forkability, I guess.
00:16:40.986 - 00:16:47.482, Speaker A: Yeah, look again, you know, I think the immediate answer was, you know, my kind of take on it, that, like, I think there are a lot more.
00:16:47.498 - 00:16:49.314, Speaker B: Modes out there than people realize, right?
00:16:49.354 - 00:16:52.772, Speaker A: Like people think that something is as.
00:16:52.788 - 00:16:54.524, Speaker B: Simple as just deploy code, walk away.
00:16:54.644 - 00:16:58.140, Speaker A: I don't think that even the simplest.
00:16:58.172 - 00:17:03.956, Speaker B: DeFi protocol really works like that because you're still operating in a competitive marketplace.
00:17:04.100 - 00:17:05.916, Speaker A: And there are a lot of alternatives.
00:17:05.940 - 00:17:07.084, Speaker B: To do the same thing.
00:17:07.204 - 00:17:09.748, Speaker A: And absent all of the structure that.
00:17:09.756 - 00:17:24.409, Speaker B: You need around information dissemination and education and all those sorts of things, you can deploy code and walk away and it can just kind of sit there. But if you don't have the infrastructure around it, it's going to be really hard to scale it up.
00:17:24.601 - 00:17:45.282, Speaker C: That aligns with how I, like, that makes sense to me. That just aligns with how I think companies are built. And I'm like, okay, if you just, like, let's take blockworks, for example. If you just copy pasted, like, our website, every single piece of content on the site, all of this, if you copy pasted this exact interview and put it out on a different RSS feed, I'm like, well, there's no marketing, like, there are no users.
00:17:45.338 - 00:17:47.146, Speaker A: And it goes stale really quickly, right?
00:17:47.210 - 00:17:48.162, Speaker D: Yeah, it goes stale.
00:17:48.218 - 00:17:51.386, Speaker C: There's no strategy and. Yeah, yeah.
00:17:51.530 - 00:17:59.090, Speaker A: And I just think that's broadly true for almost everything, right? Like, you know, if you have three things that are doing the same thing, two of them are kind of out.
00:17:59.122 - 00:18:06.802, Speaker B: There, like advocating, educating, doing all of these things to make themselves accessible and build awareness.
00:18:06.898 - 00:18:10.022, Speaker A: And one of them is not, even if it's the same code, like, the.
00:18:10.038 - 00:18:13.142, Speaker B: One that's not is just going to kind of disappear into obscurity.
00:18:13.318 - 00:18:21.070, Speaker D: Although it doesn't totally disappear, does it? It usually goes down to, like, it retains like 5% of the value of a successful fork.
00:18:21.142 - 00:18:29.774, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is weird. I mean, that speaks to, like, crypto market inefficiency more than like anything, right? Like, I think, you know, tokens never go to zero, right?
00:18:29.814 - 00:18:33.394, Speaker B: They go to like 0.001 or something.
00:18:33.894 - 00:19:17.174, Speaker D: Okay. So I thought that as well. And actually our newsletter writer Byron wrote a newsletter on this and we got a response. I'm going to protect the names of the inners, but I thought it was a very interesting observation, which is one answer to the mystery, which is why do these forks retain any values like the Ethereum classic or the bitcoin cash or whatever is that nobody wants to short them and the owners don't want to sell down there. It's a common thing in very cheap stocks. The company is very clearly bankrupt, but the stocks trades at 150 at a decent valuation because nobody wants to short it, and the holders just can't be bothered to sell when it's down 95%. So it's a kind of standard stable disequilibrium, if you will, which actually I thought was like, the best explanation for why these things still exist.
00:19:17.254 - 00:19:23.438, Speaker A: That makes sense. Yeah. Like, I guess it's just a question of why is that equilibrium or disequilibrium.
00:19:23.486 - 00:19:25.390, Speaker B: So high in many cases?
00:19:25.502 - 00:19:28.182, Speaker A: Right? Like, it seems like there's a, you.
00:19:28.198 - 00:19:30.726, Speaker B: Know, an opportunity, and I think that kind of speaks to the efficiency.
00:19:30.750 - 00:19:32.502, Speaker A: Like, you know, penny stocks trading at.
00:19:32.518 - 00:19:37.308, Speaker B: Like a $3 million valuation or whatever, fine.
00:19:37.436 - 00:19:47.036, Speaker A: Weird zombie networks that are trading at like a billion dollar valuation. Like that seems like they're. But I agree, like, there is no incentive to short them because how many.
00:19:47.060 - 00:19:55.004, Speaker B: Times have people come shorting some scam or whatever, right. It's dangerous to short a crypto.
00:19:55.164 - 00:20:31.424, Speaker C: Kay, now, when I get your take, we're two years removed from Defi summer, and two of the biggest things to come out of that was like, you had uniswap kind of kicked off this airdrop season, then you had compound kicked off liquidity mining. We're two years almost removed from that. A lot of folks have talked about copypasta. Like, a lot of folks have just dove into liquidity mining and air drops. And I think now a lot of folks are reflecting, saying, like, well, was that actually good capital coming in? It's probably more like mercenary capital coming in, and then they're quick to leave. What are your thoughts now that you've had some time to reflect on liquidity mining, air drops, all these different incentives that were really designed to increase TVL.
00:20:32.124 - 00:20:47.988, Speaker A: I think that what works in a bear market doesn't necessarily work in a bull market. Right. And Defi Summer really happened in a bear market. Right. Like, it was kind of one of the catalysts. I think that, you know, one of.
00:20:47.996 - 00:20:50.492, Speaker B: The things that had momentum coming out of the lost bear market.
00:20:50.668 - 00:21:06.640, Speaker A: And if you think about, you know, what yield farming did, and again, yield farming is a very blanket term. There's a lot of different things. You could include synthetics inflation, and realistically, synthetics inflation going from a fixed supply.
00:21:06.672 - 00:21:09.444, Speaker B: Token to an inflationary token saved the project.
00:21:10.024 - 00:21:12.880, Speaker A: Were it not for that, there was no way that people would have paid.
00:21:12.912 - 00:21:17.848, Speaker B: Attention to synthetix that yield from staking was what drove the activity.
00:21:17.936 - 00:21:19.848, Speaker A: And then following on from that yield.
00:21:19.896 - 00:21:29.046, Speaker B: Farming within uniswap to create liquidity, you know, like entry and exit liquidity for SUSD and the other synths.
00:21:29.070 - 00:21:29.254, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:29.294 - 00:21:37.830, Speaker B: Was another thing that kind of drove awareness. So my view is that the yield farming campaigns that synthetix did were the.
00:21:37.862 - 00:21:39.318, Speaker A: Things that allowed it to survive.
00:21:39.406 - 00:21:44.398, Speaker B: Right? Like, when we talk about, you know, kind of unsustainable incentives to bootstrap, like.
00:21:44.486 - 00:21:49.302, Speaker A: We kind of got to the bottom, right? You know, in early 2019, and then.
00:21:49.398 - 00:21:50.782, Speaker B: Looked around and said, okay, like, if.
00:21:50.798 - 00:21:54.586, Speaker A: We'Re going to pull this thing out, like, we need to, you know, of.
00:21:54.610 - 00:22:07.974, Speaker B: The tailspin, this death spiral that it's in, right? We're going to need to do something kind of pretty crazy, right? And so that was where we came up with some of these, like, yield farming ideas to kind of drive that.
00:22:08.514 - 00:22:11.274, Speaker A: So I do think that, like, in the right environment, it can.
00:22:11.354 - 00:22:15.290, Speaker B: It can work, obviously. You know, sometimes it doesn't go well.
00:22:15.322 - 00:22:17.986, Speaker A: But, like, even looking at compound, right? Like, and a lot of people say.
00:22:18.010 - 00:22:25.138, Speaker B: Like, they're massively overpaid for liquidity or whatever. They were juicing up TvL, which, you know, at the time metric that everyone want to pay attention to.
00:22:25.226 - 00:22:31.690, Speaker A: But I think if you went around and asked the average person who was still in crypto in the bear market.
00:22:31.762 - 00:22:38.010, Speaker B: Right, three months before compound launched their token and started yield farming, maybe a.
00:22:38.042 - 00:22:52.730, Speaker A: Third of them would have known about compound. Maybe. I agree with that. And then by day three of compounds yield farming thing, 100% of people knew about compound. And when I say, like, you know, crypto people, I mean, like, even, like.
00:22:52.762 - 00:22:59.370, Speaker B: Bitcoin, maxis and stuff, right, that are, like, in their own little bubble off here, like, if you asked, you know, Samson Mao, he'd be like, yeah, I know about compound.
00:22:59.402 - 00:22:59.954, Speaker A: I hate it.
00:22:59.994 - 00:23:04.762, Speaker B: But, like, you know, he knows about it, right? Yeah. And so I do think that, like, when you.
00:23:04.898 - 00:23:06.042, Speaker A: When you factor in, even though they.
00:23:06.058 - 00:23:11.298, Speaker B: Gave away a lot of value, right, and they probably overpaid and they could have, you know, it's hard to get that sweet spot, right?
00:23:11.346 - 00:23:13.314, Speaker A: But, like, they could have definitely given.
00:23:13.354 - 00:23:15.378, Speaker B: A lot less yield and gotten the same result.
00:23:15.506 - 00:23:25.402, Speaker A: But they demonstrated that you can go from, you know, like, awareness, market penetration, whatever you want to call it, of 20% of all crypto to 100% in.
00:23:25.418 - 00:23:30.378, Speaker B: The space of, like, five days if you have, like, significantly, you know, high enough yield, right?
00:23:30.466 - 00:23:34.882, Speaker A: And so I do think that, like, that advertising, if you. If you went out and did like.
00:23:34.938 - 00:23:37.866, Speaker B: Any kind of traditional advertising campaign or whatever, to try and build that level.
00:23:37.890 - 00:23:42.946, Speaker A: Of awareness would cost you, who knows, tens of millions, you know, hundreds of.
00:23:42.970 - 00:23:45.686, Speaker B: Millions of dollars, right. To get that level of kind of.
00:23:45.710 - 00:23:47.662, Speaker A: Market awareness so it can work.
00:23:47.678 - 00:23:52.462, Speaker D: I don't even think it would have worked. You could have spent infinite dollars, it wouldn't have worked.
00:23:52.518 - 00:24:05.222, Speaker A: You're probably right. You're probably right. And so, you know, in that regard you say, well, obviously it was a success, right? Could it have been cheaper? Absolutely. But you know, the flip side of that is if it was too much cheaper, maybe it doesn't work at all, right? Like there's some tipping point and you.
00:24:05.238 - 00:24:09.846, Speaker B: Don'T know, you know, before you start what that's going to be.
00:24:09.870 - 00:24:12.706, Speaker A: So I look at that. The flip side is I look at.
00:24:12.730 - 00:24:28.130, Speaker B: Airdrops, and airdrops thankfully are not the responsibility of Defi. Airdrops started back in the ICO days as a way of like offsetting private sales, throwing a bone to the masses or whatever the kind of tactical move was there.
00:24:28.282 - 00:24:30.842, Speaker A: So we inherited airdrops and then I.
00:24:30.858 - 00:24:38.530, Speaker B: Think most of the early Defi projects did airdrops. It was probably uniswap that revived the airdrop concept. Right?
00:24:38.602 - 00:24:42.858, Speaker A: Like doing it with a token after they've raised a bunch of money and deployed a bunch of stuff like that.
00:24:42.866 - 00:24:44.818, Speaker B: Was a different kind of conceptual airdrop.
00:24:44.946 - 00:24:47.226, Speaker A: But I still, I think today my.
00:24:47.250 - 00:24:49.146, Speaker B: View of airdrops is that they're a.
00:24:49.170 - 00:24:57.714, Speaker A: Failure versus yield farming. Like, I think if you compare those two things, I think yield farming still has value and the right kind of yield, especially in a bear market.
00:24:57.754 - 00:24:59.450, Speaker B: I think yield farming can work effectively.
00:24:59.602 - 00:25:01.974, Speaker A: I think that air drops are a failure.
00:25:02.454 - 00:25:56.894, Speaker C: Let me, let me try to push back, which is airdrops. Now are you see activity happening pre airdrop and even pre token on things? Because there's a, it's like airdrops might be a failure for the project, but they're actually a net benefit for the space because they get people to try new protocols and new, new projects and try and try new products. So like, there are products that are like, their products are like pretty crappy, to be honest, and they're pre token, but like people are, people go and use them and they can get like their 1st, 10,000 users because there's an expect, because you have these like airdrop farmers and there's an expectation that they, that the, that they might get an airdrop. And then for like one out of 50 of the products, the product's actually pretty good. So then they go and share it, and it goes, and it goes viral, and you kind of see this with, like, pseudo swap. Maybe you could say this is happening right now.
00:25:57.554 - 00:26:07.962, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, information dissemination in crypto is very hard. It's super inefficient. I was talking to one of my.
00:26:08.018 - 00:26:11.082, Speaker B: Mentor projects a couple days ago, and.
00:26:11.098 - 00:26:18.494, Speaker A: I was like, it doesn't matter how good of a thing you do. It's the equivalent of dollar 100 bill.
00:26:18.994 - 00:26:23.454, Speaker B: In the middle of Times Square or something like that.
00:26:23.784 - 00:26:25.904, Speaker A: That $100 bill in crypto can stay.
00:26:25.944 - 00:26:27.328, Speaker B: There for, like, weeks or months.
00:26:27.376 - 00:26:37.552, Speaker A: Right. Because there's just money everywhere. It's chaotic. Like, no one believes anything that anyone says. Like, there's all this, like, disinformation and stuff. And so, you know, when you look.
00:26:37.568 - 00:26:42.848, Speaker B: At, like, market efficiency and, like, the efficiency of information flows, it's really, really weak in crypto.
00:26:42.896 - 00:26:49.136, Speaker A: Right. The amount of times I've seen something where, like, some project does something, it's really successful, and it takes, like, three.
00:26:49.200 - 00:26:51.046, Speaker B: Months or six months before anyone even.
00:26:51.160 - 00:26:57.066, Speaker A: Pays attention to it. Yield farming and airdrops are a way of kind of short circuiting that. Right. I think that was, like, the market.
00:26:57.130 - 00:27:07.530, Speaker B: Solution to, like, how do I get people to pay attention to me today versus in, like, six months that it would take from, like, normal, you know, tactics of kind of going on podcasts.
00:27:07.562 - 00:27:10.082, Speaker A: Or writing blog posts or whatever it.
00:27:10.098 - 00:27:11.018, Speaker B: Was that people were doing.
00:27:11.106 - 00:27:19.042, Speaker A: So that's fine. But then when you think, okay, so I've got tokens, and I'm going to use those tokens to incentivize people to.
00:27:19.058 - 00:27:20.982, Speaker B: Pay attention to me. Right.
00:27:21.158 - 00:27:23.686, Speaker A: And you think about, what are some.
00:27:23.710 - 00:27:26.350, Speaker B: Of the kind of approaches that I could take?
00:27:26.462 - 00:27:33.870, Speaker A: When I look at the kind of continuum of different approaches, like a pure airdrop to just a bunch of random.
00:27:33.902 - 00:27:36.366, Speaker B: People, which is the old days, you.
00:27:36.390 - 00:27:48.602, Speaker A: Literally sign a form and get tokens. That end of the spectrum to me, is a failure as you come closer to, you know, you have to do certain things and, you know, it starts.
00:27:48.618 - 00:27:49.746, Speaker B: To look more like yield farming.
00:27:49.770 - 00:27:55.562, Speaker A: Like, your point of, like, there are people using the protocol to qualify for an airdrop. Like, that's almost like, you know, pre.
00:27:55.658 - 00:27:56.874, Speaker B: Yield farming sort of stuff.
00:27:56.914 - 00:27:57.658, Speaker A: Pre yield farming.
00:27:57.706 - 00:27:58.490, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:27:58.562 - 00:27:59.774, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:28:01.594 - 00:28:31.694, Speaker D: I have a question just in terms of, you know, I have this debate actually with a friend, just like, the expense. So, like, if you view yield farming as, like, a very expensive form of customer acquisition, like marketing, you could look at that and say, wow, that's really expensive. But it's also not a cash expense. And a lot of these protocols, like very early stage, they don't necessarily have liquidity. Look at what's happening right now with Lido and Gitcoin and they're all trying to diversify into stables. There's a very limited ability to do that. I hear you.
00:28:31.694 - 00:28:45.020, Speaker D: On the ones you can look at the dollar be like you sold for what? How expensive was that? But on the other hand, how readily was the actual cash available for that as well? Like, do you have a thought just on like just equity finance versus like actually converting the cash?
00:28:45.172 - 00:28:51.964, Speaker A: Look, there's no question, you know, being able to like give people equity, right? Give people ownership in a protocol, right.
00:28:52.124 - 00:28:54.100, Speaker B: You know, is not a cash expense, right?
00:28:54.132 - 00:28:58.428, Speaker A: Like if you look at PayPal's, the original blitzscaling move was PayPal giving dollar.
00:28:58.436 - 00:29:03.572, Speaker B: Ten to every person who signed up another person, right? Like this referral bonus now, okay, you.
00:29:03.588 - 00:29:05.052, Speaker A: Can'T give up free money unless you.
00:29:05.068 - 00:29:15.506, Speaker B: Have Kyc to like, you know, anti civil, right? Like realistically, like, and even then, I'm sure, you know, they lost millions of dollars to like civil attacks or fraud or whatever like that, but they didn't care, right?
00:29:15.530 - 00:29:21.170, Speaker A: Like it allowed them to scale up to a point where they became, you know, critical to eBay's infrastructure and then.
00:29:21.202 - 00:29:21.970, Speaker B: That whole thing, right?
00:29:22.002 - 00:29:23.146, Speaker A: So you look at some of these.
00:29:23.170 - 00:29:31.482, Speaker B: Like startup stories of, you know, early, like, you know, web one startups, right? Like, you know, back in the like, you know, ancient history days, right?
00:29:31.658 - 00:29:35.682, Speaker A: You know, this, this kind of thing has been going on. But if PayPal had, had the ability.
00:29:35.738 - 00:29:38.826, Speaker B: To giveaway PayPal equity right now, on.
00:29:38.850 - 00:29:40.786, Speaker A: One hand, dollars are more powerful than.
00:29:40.890 - 00:29:45.762, Speaker B: Equity for a lot of people because dollars are dollars. You can use them today versus equity.
00:29:45.898 - 00:29:53.538, Speaker A: But if there is an open market and a semi liquid market for their equity, they're a good proxy for dollars.
00:29:53.706 - 00:29:56.614, Speaker B: It might cost more because whatever.
00:29:56.914 - 00:29:58.162, Speaker A: I think when you look at some.
00:29:58.178 - 00:30:02.746, Speaker B: Of these tactics and what you can do, yes, it's absolutely beneficial that we.
00:30:02.770 - 00:30:22.722, Speaker A: Are able to spend non cash consideration for attention. And to your point, I think about markets, it is better for the market to have this mechanism because it drives attention to different things that otherwise wouldn't be able to get attention. And some of them are good and.
00:30:22.738 - 00:30:23.774, Speaker B: Some of them are bad.
00:30:24.114 - 00:30:51.934, Speaker A: My question about airdrops and even ignoring pure airdrops or whatever is that you remove the need for any kind of conviction, right? So this is the thing that I have an issue with, right? Is that like yield farming required conviction, you had to put your own money into a contract that, you know, I mean, it was probably stakeholders all, but like you had to put your money into some contract that someone encoded. You needed to believe, you know, and if you wanted like real yield, right.
00:30:51.974 - 00:30:57.298, Speaker B: You might have to put like hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some people put a meaningful amount of.
00:30:57.346 - 00:31:04.974, Speaker A: Their assets into these yield farms and it became this game of who's in there?
00:31:05.474 - 00:31:12.650, Speaker B: And people would look at certain wallets and be like, oh, that wallet's in there, so this must be safe. They vetted it, et cetera. And there was this game during defi.
00:31:12.682 - 00:31:15.090, Speaker A: Summer of which things are safe, which.
00:31:15.122 - 00:31:17.306, Speaker B: Aren'T safe and what have you.
00:31:17.490 - 00:31:26.486, Speaker A: But the reality is you need conviction. So even if you're yield farming and then selling, you had some cost almost, right? Like there was a cost to you acquiring these tokens.
00:31:26.550 - 00:31:27.542, Speaker B: And I think when you get free.
00:31:27.598 - 00:31:38.302, Speaker A: Tokens just for doing a service or something like that, there's a lack of conviction, which I think could be rectified. I don't have necessarily the solution to this, but I think that removing the.
00:31:38.318 - 00:31:42.710, Speaker B: Need for like some kind of conviction is a negative on the airdrop side.
00:31:42.902 - 00:32:07.460, Speaker C: Yeah, everything that we're talking about is very b two c focused. So like yield farming, airdrops, these are ways to get users onto your. Onto your protocol and onto your platform. I want to get your take on b two b or like what feels like Dao to Dao, which feels like the next evolution of what's happening in Defi. I was looking at some of the stuff going on with synthetix. You guys have sip 267. It allows you guys to integrate directly into applications.
00:32:07.460 - 00:32:43.594, Speaker C: I don't think this is official. I saw something on twitter. The synthetix team is looking to create a direct integration with Aave for a direct deposit module. Reminds me of what maker feels very similar to makers d three M with Aave, which obviously they're scaling that up with probably other protocols coming soon. What is the future of Dao to Dao? And is that where all of this goes? Where you have the base layer of these OG original DeFi protocols that are using other newer DeFi applications as the front end?
00:32:44.214 - 00:32:49.230, Speaker A: Again, I think this goes back to that earlier point about moats and people's.
00:32:49.262 - 00:32:53.674, Speaker B: Assumptions about what would happen versus what.
00:32:53.714 - 00:33:04.514, Speaker A: Actually transpired, which is that composability was supposed to just be this open permissionless thing. You just turn up and you've got this contract and you connect it. The reality is that just connecting two.
00:33:04.554 - 00:33:06.534, Speaker B: Contracts is often not enough.
00:33:06.954 - 00:33:09.482, Speaker A: The reality is that even with composability.
00:33:09.658 - 00:33:12.134, Speaker B: Oftentimes in order for something to work.
00:33:12.954 - 00:33:15.010, Speaker A: There needs to be some engineering effort.
00:33:15.042 - 00:33:17.724, Speaker B: On both sides, which now you're into.
00:33:17.764 - 00:33:19.276, Speaker A: Like, you know, b two b kind.
00:33:19.300 - 00:33:22.484, Speaker B: Of, you know, there's a whole.
00:33:22.564 - 00:33:26.956, Speaker A: There's a whole thing right around, like how you approach and negotiate and like.
00:33:26.980 - 00:33:27.804, Speaker B: Deal with these things.
00:33:27.884 - 00:33:41.732, Speaker A: And so I think we're seeing that where like, most of the easy integrations, you know, simple, simple, kind of purely permissionless integrations have been kind of have been done right.
00:33:41.788 - 00:33:45.708, Speaker B: And, you know, that easily accessible stuff has been done, but the hardest stuff.
00:33:45.836 - 00:33:51.620, Speaker A: Which required convincing the other community to make changes that you needed, that's like.
00:33:51.652 - 00:33:55.260, Speaker B: This next evolution, I think, in composability.
00:33:55.372 - 00:33:58.784, Speaker A: But it's not permissionless composability the way that everyone imagined.
00:33:59.284 - 00:34:26.080, Speaker D: You know, it's funny about that. Jason and I have talked a lot about like, m and a, and when is m and a coming to crypto, so to speak. One thing that's very funny is like, if you consider moat like to be a big or sorry community, to be a big moat for crypto, like, the number one reason why m and a fails is what's it like, cultural differences. So it's just very interesting, and I'm curious to see how that all ends up playing out in crypto.
00:34:26.112 - 00:34:39.248, Speaker A: Frankly, I think the biggest impediment to crypto M and a right now is the fact that seniorage, whatever you want to call it, profits, the ability to print your own money, make your own money, and the speculative premium, even in.
00:34:39.256 - 00:34:40.496, Speaker B: The bear market that is a place.
00:34:40.520 - 00:35:02.136, Speaker A: Applied to that is so outlandish that it really makes it hard for two communities to come together and merge. Synthetix has looked at this a number of times. Ok, you can look like the Rari Fey fiasco. I think there's other issues going on there, but it's really hard to even get to a point where you can.
00:35:02.160 - 00:35:03.312, Speaker B: Agree on what the value of the.
00:35:03.328 - 00:35:09.414, Speaker A: Thing is when there's this tradable token that has a liquid ish market that.
00:35:09.454 - 00:35:11.838, Speaker B: Has this speculative premium attached to it.
00:35:11.846 - 00:35:16.774, Speaker A: That might be orders of magnitude above the actual value of the thing that you bring in.
00:35:16.814 - 00:35:17.110, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:17.182 - 00:35:19.758, Speaker A: And so that, I think is going.
00:35:19.766 - 00:35:22.686, Speaker B: To be the biggest impediment until some.
00:35:22.710 - 00:35:24.246, Speaker A: Of these things kind of fail.
00:35:24.390 - 00:35:34.142, Speaker B: And then maybe you see like aqua hires and stuff like that, that might happen when people have kind of given up on the project and you're bringing an engineering team in or something. I think that, to me, feels like.
00:35:34.158 - 00:35:37.134, Speaker A: The first kind of wave of these things that might happen in the bear market.
00:35:37.174 - 00:35:41.790, Speaker B: Like, teams that don't have Runway want some exit strategy, etcetera.
00:35:41.862 - 00:35:47.554, Speaker A: But even then, I think if you were to go to the average project that maybe raised a few million dollars.
00:35:47.894 - 00:35:51.078, Speaker B: Maybe has a $50 million market cap or whatever, and looked and said, like.
00:35:51.166 - 00:35:53.206, Speaker A: Okay, we're supposed to buy this thing.
00:35:53.230 - 00:35:56.966, Speaker B: For $50 million, right? Like, it just is nonsensical.
00:35:57.030 - 00:35:58.742, Speaker A: Like, you know, no one believes that.
00:35:58.758 - 00:36:00.102, Speaker B: This thing is worth $50 million.
00:36:00.158 - 00:36:17.534, Speaker A: Like, it's just a speculative premium that's not sustainable. So then the only counter to that is, okay, but we also have a token, and that token also has a speculative premium. And so what we're going to do is we're going to print more of those tokens and do, like, a token swap. And that can potentially work.
00:36:17.614 - 00:36:26.734, Speaker B: But oftentimes the project that's acquiring this early stage project, there's like, a dislocation in terms of, like, what that speculative premier is.
00:36:26.814 - 00:36:32.090, Speaker A: And so it's, you know, like, aave turning up and being like, hey, I'm going to buy this protocol for $100 million.
00:36:32.122 - 00:36:33.546, Speaker B: And it's like, wait, what are you buying? Right?
00:36:33.570 - 00:36:36.130, Speaker A: Like, and I, like, I don't, I don't even need to name the protocol.
00:36:36.162 - 00:36:37.274, Speaker B: You just say any protocol.
00:36:37.314 - 00:36:40.570, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. Like, it's not worth $100 million. There's no way.
00:36:40.602 - 00:36:48.290, Speaker B: So you want to print $100 million with Aave to go out and buy this thing? Like, we can build it ourselves for. That is the answer, I think, that most communities would say.
00:36:48.402 - 00:36:50.602, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's, it's a challenge, I.
00:36:50.618 - 00:36:55.492, Speaker B: Think, for M and a, unfortunately, just due to valuation nonsense.
00:36:55.668 - 00:37:03.660, Speaker C: So if m and a doesn't happen right now at the bottom, at what feels like maybe the bottom of the market or near the bottom, whatever you want to call it, it's never happening.
00:37:03.732 - 00:37:03.988, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:04.036 - 00:37:04.956, Speaker C: Then it doesn't happen.
00:37:05.060 - 00:37:12.132, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the time, right? Like, you know, you need peak fear, I think, to tamp down the speculative.
00:37:12.268 - 00:37:15.908, Speaker B: Premier that you have for these smaller, smaller early stage projects.
00:37:16.076 - 00:37:25.834, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, there are aqua hires and that happens and sometimes for, like, really high, you know, who was that guy? Was the Jeff Bezos guys that he had like a diaper company.
00:37:25.954 - 00:37:26.854, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:37:27.794 - 00:37:29.474, Speaker C: It was like $2 billion or something.
00:37:29.514 - 00:37:34.890, Speaker D: Like, yeah, $2 billion aqua hire or something. Yeah. So, I mean, that, that does happen even for, you know, spectacular team.
00:37:34.922 - 00:37:35.514, Speaker A: I think if you've got.
00:37:35.554 - 00:37:36.770, Speaker D: I don't think that's really what we're talking about.
00:37:36.802 - 00:37:41.890, Speaker A: No, I mean, we're not, but, like, if you've got enough scale, you know, and I mean, the whole point of.
00:37:42.082 - 00:37:45.858, Speaker B: That company was like, it was built on holocracy or, you know, whatever.
00:37:45.906 - 00:37:48.186, Speaker A: So like that. So even that is like you pay.
00:37:48.210 - 00:37:53.450, Speaker B: $2 billion for, for holocracy. Like you could probably get a consultant to come in and help you with that.
00:37:53.482 - 00:37:54.334, Speaker A: But anyway.
00:37:56.514 - 00:38:44.910, Speaker D: Maybe you think this is relevant or interesting, maybe you don't think it is, but that speculative premium being applied to tokens, something that's very different, that happens at a protocol, the way that your equity or token base is decided is some tokens are more fungible than equity. If you consider equity a form of currency that you can buy certain things with, you can really buy other companies or people, right? Like human capital. That's what you could spend that currency on. So like, when you're doing your cap table at the beginning of a company, you like, divide it up and there's none left over, right? There's just like, okay, it's like the founders, the employees, and then like the investors, right? And then at each round you like issue more equity. But with tokens it's different. Like when you look at the initial token distribution, it's like, okay, this is for the founders. Is it devs? This is for the community and this is just this chunk that's for nobody.
00:38:44.910 - 00:38:58.974, Speaker D: But it's what we were going to use to like buy shit with. And it's just very, it's very different because that those tokens are like more fungible for you can't buy anything. You couldn't go to like CV's and spend, you know, SnX. Not that I know. Maybe that's in the cards.
00:38:59.014 - 00:39:02.554, Speaker A: You probably can know, you might. Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
00:39:03.094 - 00:39:11.354, Speaker D: But like you can accept more stuff, you can buy more things, right? Like there's, it's much more common to accept payment in tokens. I wonder if that has an impact.
00:39:12.134 - 00:39:18.452, Speaker A: So I think I've got a couple of thoughts there. I think, you know, I don't want to blame all of this on like.
00:39:18.468 - 00:39:20.044, Speaker B: The ERC 20 standard, right?
00:39:20.084 - 00:39:24.028, Speaker A: But like there, there was this idea of like, you only get to make.
00:39:24.116 - 00:39:26.508, Speaker B: A certain amount of tokens, right? Which is not true for equity.
00:39:26.556 - 00:39:41.012, Speaker A: Equity has the, you know, like in a business, you can print more tokens, right? Print more equity, right? And so you don't need to have this undifferentiated pool of value because people understand the concept that when you do another round, you make more equity and.
00:39:41.028 - 00:39:43.946, Speaker B: Then you sell it, right? Everyone else gets diluted in crypto, people.
00:39:43.970 - 00:39:52.706, Speaker A: Are like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where we do not accept scam. I want to scam exactly. Like, I want to know how many tokens there are. And it can never change, right?
00:39:52.770 - 00:39:58.346, Speaker B: And it realistically goes back to like bitcoin days, right? Like this is a meme that came from like, bitcoin. Like, there's fixed supply.
00:39:58.450 - 00:39:59.474, Speaker A: Yes, there's emissions.
00:39:59.514 - 00:40:01.666, Speaker B: But like, you can never print more bitcoin.
00:40:01.730 - 00:40:03.154, Speaker A: If you print more bitcoin, the whole.
00:40:03.194 - 00:40:05.754, Speaker B: Thing is just obliterated, right?
00:40:05.834 - 00:40:12.310, Speaker A: And so like that, like kind of pervasive thing, like cut got kind of forked into the ERC 20 standard, right?
00:40:12.342 - 00:40:13.902, Speaker B: Like it was, it was included as.
00:40:13.918 - 00:40:17.126, Speaker A: A concept that, okay, it's day one. You're doing a project.
00:40:17.230 - 00:40:18.742, Speaker B: How many tokens do you have?
00:40:18.918 - 00:40:22.214, Speaker A: 100 million? A billion? And like, we all know that's not like, what does that even mean?
00:40:22.254 - 00:40:23.806, Speaker B: Like they're, it's.
00:40:23.870 - 00:40:29.726, Speaker A: They're divisible to 18 decimal places. Like, you might as well have one, like. Or like, it just doesn't matter, right?
00:40:29.790 - 00:40:32.834, Speaker B: Unibia is notwithstanding, we've learned that lesson, right?
00:40:33.214 - 00:40:38.950, Speaker A: And so I think, like, that is the immediate reason why I think you.
00:40:38.982 - 00:40:44.422, Speaker B: Have this weird idea of like, we have to have an undifferentiated pool because there's this meme of like, everyone wants.
00:40:44.438 - 00:40:47.030, Speaker A: To know how many tokens there will be for the rest of time until.
00:40:47.062 - 00:40:48.062, Speaker B: The heat death of the universe.
00:40:48.078 - 00:40:57.830, Speaker A: And if there's one more token than that, I'm out, right? And so, like, when synthetix went, okay, hey everyone, we've got 100 million tokens, but actually we're going to create this.
00:40:57.862 - 00:40:59.870, Speaker B: Inflationary supply and increase the supply.
00:40:59.902 - 00:41:02.030, Speaker A: Like most people at that point thankfully.
00:41:02.062 - 00:41:07.624, Speaker B: Didn'T care because like the fdv of synthetix was like $3 million and everyone's already out, right?
00:41:07.964 - 00:41:12.244, Speaker A: But if you tried to do something like that today, it would be very, very hard.
00:41:12.284 - 00:41:13.300, Speaker B: I think you get a lot of pushback.
00:41:13.332 - 00:41:15.108, Speaker A: So I think that's the primary reason.
00:41:15.156 - 00:41:19.340, Speaker B: Why we see that weird dynamic of like, you have to print extra equity, whatever.
00:41:19.412 - 00:41:22.628, Speaker A: And like, even in theory, you know, who is it?
00:41:22.716 - 00:41:23.756, Speaker B: AMC is going through this.
00:41:23.780 - 00:41:26.428, Speaker A: Like there is a cap on equity.
00:41:26.476 - 00:41:28.780, Speaker B: That can be printed typically right in.
00:41:28.812 - 00:41:31.442, Speaker A: Like a corporate charter that requires token.
00:41:31.498 - 00:41:33.994, Speaker B: Holder voting to unlock.
00:41:34.074 - 00:41:35.306, Speaker A: So like, even then I think there's.
00:41:35.330 - 00:41:39.642, Speaker B: Like a fixed supply ish, but it can be changed or whatever, but it's just not as strong of a meme.
00:41:39.698 - 00:41:46.690, Speaker A: So that's the first 2nd thing I think is most equity doesn't trade on public liquid markets.
00:41:46.722 - 00:41:46.866, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:46.890 - 00:41:56.594, Speaker A: So it's not as fungible with dollars as, you know. So as soon as you have every single shit coin has a uniswap pool, well, it feels much more like a dollar than, you know, some early stage.
00:41:56.634 - 00:42:01.000, Speaker B: Startup that just raised seed round, like, who's out there buying the equity? Like, it just doesn't happen.
00:42:01.152 - 00:42:37.376, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a lot of it actually comes down to that, the early stage liquidity, because it actually kind of flips in your head. Like, one thing that I've noticed that is, like, totally backwards in crypto, and I have a lot of mixed feelings about it, is this idea that you should get rewarded for being first and that rewards should continue to accrue to you disproportionately, which is like the opposite in equity, right. You start with this small pool that nobody cares about and then you kind of grow it. And you're okay with, like, diluting yourself because you have a smaller part of a much bigger pie. And I've noticed that that's, like, totally flipped in crypto. And it's like, well, I was your first, so, like, what are you going to give me for sticking around?
00:42:37.520 - 00:42:42.440, Speaker A: I've got 10,000 bitcoins and, like, that you can pry them out of my cold, dead hands.
00:42:42.472 - 00:42:43.044, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:43.744 - 00:43:04.876, Speaker D: So, yeah, yeah, it's just, it's interesting. And I wonder if, like, part of that is the liquidity at such an early stage because, you know, one thing that I've heard which just literally makes me laugh is like, well, you don't want to get front run by the Dow issuing more tokens. And it's like, that is so backwards. That is so backwards, you know?
00:43:04.940 - 00:43:11.500, Speaker A: So, look, I think there's a lot of things, you know, everything on some.
00:43:11.532 - 00:43:13.020, Speaker B: Level is pot dependent, right?
00:43:13.092 - 00:43:28.488, Speaker A: And so weird, dumb decisions that were made by early crypto participants, like, even going all the way back to, like, 2009, like, weird, dumb stuff that happened in bitcoin just arbitrarily, like some arbitrary decision that was made, you know, maybe Satoshi woke up and didn't have a.
00:43:28.496 - 00:43:30.576, Speaker B: Coffee that morning and was like, you.
00:43:30.600 - 00:43:38.456, Speaker A: Know, I'm gonna write this instead of that, right? And like, that, like, one decision, like, sends you off on this, like, tangent that, like, no one can anticipate what.
00:43:38.480 - 00:43:41.608, Speaker B: The impact of that would be twelve years later, 13 years later.
00:43:41.656 - 00:43:52.284, Speaker A: Right. But, like, there is still the ability. Nothing is, like, purely path dependent, right. You can still find your way back to the other reality.
00:43:52.364 - 00:43:54.068, Speaker B: You know, it just might take time, right.
00:43:54.156 - 00:44:10.620, Speaker A: And so, you know, I think that as the market becomes more efficient. As experimentation happens, things that are more efficient will do better. Right. And, you know, more participants means more experimentation, which means, like, oh, now we're doing this experiment where we don't have a fixed supply. Like, synthetix was one of the first.
00:44:10.692 - 00:44:11.420, Speaker B: To do this, right?
00:44:11.452 - 00:44:12.480, Speaker A: We were like, we're not going to.
00:44:12.482 - 00:44:16.610, Speaker B: Have a fixed supply token. We're going to have inflation. We're about to shut off inflation, but that's a different story.
00:44:16.682 - 00:44:20.482, Speaker A: I know you know so well, I say that I'm about to propose it.
00:44:20.578 - 00:44:24.694, Speaker B: They'll probably tell me to shove it. Yeah, exactly.
00:44:26.194 - 00:44:27.378, Speaker D: You're too benevolent. That's.
00:44:27.426 - 00:44:29.254, Speaker A: I know. Yeah.
00:44:29.594 - 00:44:41.878, Speaker C: What can I. What's the reason for that? Can you, like, just. What's the reason for shutting off inflation? And, like, what are the maybe talking about path dependencies? Like, what are the second order impacts of shutting off inflation?
00:44:42.046 - 00:44:51.158, Speaker A: So one of the fun things about synthetics is we understand, I think, as a community, and, you know, this, I think there were a lot of early.
00:44:51.206 - 00:44:52.894, Speaker B: People that found their way to synthetix.
00:44:52.934 - 00:45:07.120, Speaker A: That just liked the way that the early community thought about things is like, you know, we're in a lower information environment, right? So you can sit there and you can speculate about what the impact of anything is going to be, but nothing.
00:45:07.192 - 00:45:09.456, Speaker B: Is as good as, like, empirical evidence, right?
00:45:09.480 - 00:45:11.272, Speaker A: So let's do the thing ideally in.
00:45:11.288 - 00:45:14.872, Speaker B: A small scale, right? And we try not to, like, walk through one way doors, but, like, do.
00:45:14.888 - 00:45:20.744, Speaker A: It at a small scale and see if you die, right? Like, eat, like, a tiny little bit of that, like, mushroom, and, like, see.
00:45:20.784 - 00:45:22.964, Speaker B: If you live or, you know, whatever, right?
00:45:23.304 - 00:45:24.592, Speaker A: You know, and if it's, like, super.
00:45:24.648 - 00:45:28.960, Speaker B: Poisonous, you probably die, but you accept that's, like, the risk of life, right? And.
00:45:29.032 - 00:45:33.686, Speaker A: And so, you know, I think that this idea of shutting off inflation, people.
00:45:33.750 - 00:45:38.582, Speaker B: Within the synthetics community and overall synthetics community is very open to experimentation.
00:45:38.718 - 00:45:46.742, Speaker A: And we're coming up on this very meme like number, which is what kind of triggered it for me. There's 300 million tokens about to be issued.
00:45:46.758 - 00:45:49.374, Speaker B: I think we're, like, 292 or something like that.
00:45:49.454 - 00:45:56.926, Speaker A: So there's 8 million tokens left. We started off with 100 million, then we changed the inflationary schedule and gone.
00:45:56.950 - 00:45:59.358, Speaker B: Back and forth and had more or less inflation, whatever.
00:45:59.446 - 00:46:04.590, Speaker A: But 300 Spartans, et cetera, like, there's this meme thing about, like, somehow we.
00:46:04.622 - 00:46:06.502, Speaker B: Ended up at 300 million tokens, which.
00:46:06.558 - 00:46:11.302, Speaker A: No one expected, and here we are, right? And the reality is, why can we.
00:46:11.318 - 00:46:16.942, Speaker B: Do it today versus six months ago? Because we actually have fee revenue accruing now for the first time, so we.
00:46:16.958 - 00:46:18.206, Speaker A: Could maybe get away with it.
00:46:18.270 - 00:46:19.526, Speaker B: Is it too early?
00:46:19.670 - 00:46:23.446, Speaker A: Maybe, right? But, you know, synthetix and synthetix community.
00:46:23.510 - 00:46:25.126, Speaker B: Has never kind of shied away from.
00:46:25.270 - 00:46:32.894, Speaker A: Doing things that are a bit high risk. Like, in worst case, it is too early and there's some issue. Whatever, then we can fix that problem.
00:46:33.054 - 00:46:34.774, Speaker B: It's not an unfixable problem.
00:46:34.934 - 00:47:09.382, Speaker D: Do you think? And I've got, Jason, I have a bunch of questions for you, specifically on synthetics. I know you've got a big upgrade that's coming down the pike, but I got two more questions before we just move on there. Do you think there's a game theory thing here in terms of shutting off rewards for inflation? Because there was a proposal that almost passed with compound. To your point, they kicked off yield farming in Defi summer, and there was a proposal that got really, really close. Close, right. To shut off rewards. And to your point about path dependency, I'm like, maybe if they had shut it off, it would have been like, well, if compound shut it off, then I can shut it off.
00:47:09.382 - 00:47:13.798, Speaker D: Do you think? It's just like the game musical chairs. Everyone's just waiting to be like, I finally, we can shut these things off?
00:47:13.926 - 00:47:14.190, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:14.222 - 00:47:34.036, Speaker A: Like, you know, the Overton window of what's acceptable in crypto is typically very small, right? Because it's still a very small community. And so it takes some crazy person doing some crazy thing, right, to kind of open that up, right? And say, like, oh, this is the thing that we can do now, right? And I think the reason, particularly if you go back and look at, like.
00:47:34.060 - 00:47:35.212, Speaker B: Some of the things that were done.
00:47:35.268 - 00:47:46.388, Speaker A: And some of the, like, mimetic rules that, you know, kind of, you know, dogmatic things that kind of emerged in the ICO mania was that, like, in an ICO, you had like a six.
00:47:46.436 - 00:47:50.532, Speaker B: Week window from, like, announcing your thing to, like, raising all the money, right? It was insane.
00:47:50.588 - 00:47:58.376, Speaker A: Like nothing the world has ever seen, right? And so if you made one wrong move, you went from this reality where.
00:47:58.400 - 00:48:04.528, Speaker B: You could raise millions or tens of millions of dollars, billions of dollars in the case of some projects, to nothing.
00:48:04.656 - 00:48:11.696, Speaker A: It was a very binary outcome. You set 1ft wrong and it's over. The community would abandon you and move.
00:48:11.720 - 00:48:19.976, Speaker B: On to the next thing because it was just this rapid fire cycle that created this very rigid view of what is acceptable.
00:48:20.120 - 00:48:25.816, Speaker A: Because you have a conversation with an investor and they'd be like, okay, so what are you doing with this? And they'd be like, we're doing this.
00:48:25.840 - 00:48:26.902, Speaker B: And they'd be like, I'm out.
00:48:27.048 - 00:48:31.226, Speaker A: And that was it. Like, it was done. It was not like a conversation. Just like, sorry, I got a call.
00:48:31.250 - 00:48:34.090, Speaker B: In 15 minutes for the next crazy scheme, right?
00:48:34.242 - 00:48:35.498, Speaker A: And so people were kind of forced.
00:48:35.546 - 00:48:40.890, Speaker B: Into this kind of view of, okay, we have to do these things, but.
00:48:40.922 - 00:48:48.010, Speaker A: Then I think, you know, over and defy somewhere was similar, right? Like, if you wanted a yield farm and you wanted people to go into.
00:48:48.042 - 00:48:53.166, Speaker B: It, like, you needed to use stakingrewards sol if you wrote your own contract, even if it was better, people would.
00:48:53.190 - 00:48:55.150, Speaker A: Be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't trust this.
00:48:55.222 - 00:48:56.886, Speaker B: And they would go on to the next thing, right?
00:48:56.910 - 00:49:01.414, Speaker A: So, like, when things are moving quickly, you know, people kind of, you know.
00:49:01.454 - 00:49:05.390, Speaker B: Hew to whatever is like, the accepted, you know, approach to things.
00:49:05.582 - 00:49:10.886, Speaker A: And I do think that that has constrained our ability to, like, experiment and.
00:49:10.990 - 00:49:12.794, Speaker B: Iterate and test things.
00:49:13.454 - 00:49:17.974, Speaker A: But during bear markets, the pressure is kind of there.
00:49:18.134 - 00:49:20.294, Speaker B: Do things, right? Like, you kind of have to try new things.
00:49:20.334 - 00:49:21.838, Speaker A: So I think during bear markets, you.
00:49:21.846 - 00:49:25.678, Speaker B: Get a lot more experimentation, whereas in bull market, it's just about do the.
00:49:25.846 - 00:49:27.182, Speaker A: Thing that everyone expects you to do.
00:49:27.198 - 00:49:31.654, Speaker B: As quickly as possible and take advantage of this crazy market momentum.
00:49:31.814 - 00:50:10.822, Speaker D: I've got one more question about fees. Before we close this topic, one thing that I've noticed and maybe push back on a little bit is I think there's a difference between to what you were saying, like, proving that a protocol can earn fees, right, and that there's actual value. And it's not just based on, you know, inflationaries, like, just giving out rewards versus actually returning capital to token holders. And I've noticed that people are, like, mixing those two concepts up, right? Like, to your point, right in the beginning, you, like, subsidize your growth. Like, do whatever you got to do to, like, get yourself on the map. Then you have to prove, like, a provable revenue strategy and the ability to generate profit. You probably don't have to extract it yet, but you have to prove that you, like, can do it.
00:50:10.822 - 00:50:28.640, Speaker D: And then eventually, right, this is like the lifecycle of a company. Then you return capital to shareholders or in our case, token holders. And I've noticed that people are, like, conflating these two things. Like, yes, earn fees so you can give me the token holder back the reward. And I'm like, that is not. I just don't think that that's what should be happening at this early stage. Right.
00:50:28.640 - 00:50:39.456, Speaker D: You should be like protocols, right? Should be taking that revenue and putting in some form of treasury and, like, reinvesting it. This is a capital compounding problem, not a juice returns problem. What do you think about that?
00:50:39.600 - 00:50:49.026, Speaker A: I think, again, that's kind of another meme, right, of like, you know, there's a lot of entitlement in crypto, right? And so the entitlement is like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like, why would I allow money that.
00:50:49.050 - 00:50:50.946, Speaker B: Could go to me to go to someone else?
00:50:51.090 - 00:50:54.774, Speaker A: Like, that's not okay, right? And so, like, there's this, like, very.
00:50:55.634 - 00:50:59.138, Speaker B: Kind of rigid view of like, no.
00:50:59.226 - 00:51:09.954, Speaker A: You know, what could uniswap have to do with. And also I think a lot of people look at large treasuries and they say, why would I give, you know, that multi billion dollar dow treasury more.
00:51:09.994 - 00:51:14.314, Speaker B: Money when I could have it, right? Like, that's the other, the other side of the coin as well, I think.
00:51:14.694 - 00:51:16.854, Speaker A: And I think the final thing of.
00:51:16.894 - 00:51:18.766, Speaker B: Maybe where this emerged from was the.
00:51:18.790 - 00:51:20.902, Speaker A: Idea that, like, daos don't need money.
00:51:20.958 - 00:51:21.806, Speaker B: They're efficient, right?
00:51:21.830 - 00:51:23.614, Speaker A: They're autonomous. Like, why would a dow need money?
00:51:23.654 - 00:51:26.006, Speaker B: Why do they need a treasury? Like, why do they need to do things, right?
00:51:26.030 - 00:51:28.598, Speaker A: Like the early days of like, pure.
00:51:28.646 - 00:51:33.734, Speaker B: Daoist like, view was like, it's just gonna be some code that runs and, like, people will kind of be hanging.
00:51:33.774 - 00:51:35.118, Speaker A: Around looking at it, but, like, no.
00:51:35.126 - 00:51:36.326, Speaker B: One needs to do anything, right?
00:51:36.390 - 00:51:37.590, Speaker A: And I think we've realized that that's.
00:51:37.622 - 00:51:38.960, Speaker B: Actually not the case.
00:51:39.152 - 00:51:44.224, Speaker A: So I think there is a tension there between people selfishly wanting the yield.
00:51:44.264 - 00:51:45.440, Speaker B: As soon as possible, right?
00:51:45.472 - 00:51:46.248, Speaker A: Like, oh, there's fees.
00:51:46.296 - 00:51:47.888, Speaker B: I want those fees. I'm a token holder.
00:51:47.936 - 00:51:51.856, Speaker A: I've got, you know, a hundredth of a percent of the supply. I want a hundredth of a percent.
00:51:51.920 - 00:51:54.084, Speaker B: Of the fees generated today. Right.
00:51:54.504 - 00:52:04.524, Speaker A: But to your point, you know, is that the best idea? You know, that's why we have governments, I guess, right? To like, debate these things.
00:52:06.694 - 00:52:40.016, Speaker D: Sorry, I know I said this was the last question. Fees. How do you think fees end up getting implemented? Because, right. There's this very rich history in tradvy of like, people not liking to pay fees that are upfront. So what they do is like, everyone's still got to make their money. So they put it in the background, right? Like, probably the most relevant part of this discussion is like, mev. But I'd be curious to, like, get your sense of like, how you view that happening, right? Like, do you think people are just going to be okay with paying fees or they're going to be like, hey, we demand lower fees and then you say, okay, well, hey, we'll take down your trading fees or whatever it is, but, like, we'll find this other kind of sneaky way.
00:52:40.016 - 00:52:41.904, Speaker D: Like, how do you see fees getting implemented?
00:52:42.064 - 00:52:48.952, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you know, payment for order flow is probably the best example, right? Like, okay, you can trade for free, but, you know, and I mean, Matt.
00:52:48.968 - 00:52:53.240, Speaker B: Levine from Bloomberg has talked about this, like, you know, a million times, right?
00:52:53.272 - 00:53:00.840, Speaker A: That, like, actually, that is better for everyone, right? It is a better situation. But it just feels like there's something, like, to your point, like, sneaky thing.
00:53:00.872 - 00:53:02.414, Speaker B: Going on in the background, right?
00:53:02.874 - 00:53:16.154, Speaker A: It just feels like, oh, this doesn't look good. But the reality is that uninformed order flow is valuable. That's a valuable thing. And synthetix has struggled with this. This is actually, you asked about the.
00:53:16.234 - 00:53:20.170, Speaker B: Direct integration sip and why we're doing that.
00:53:20.242 - 00:53:34.176, Speaker A: The direct integration sip is kind of the equivalent of payment for order flow. It's like the defi equivalent of that. So we're basically saying to curve, we want your order flow. We know that it's uninformed arbitrage, right?
00:53:34.200 - 00:53:37.968, Speaker B: We know that it's undifferentiated people trading.
00:53:38.016 - 00:53:41.216, Speaker A: Through curve, and they're doing something else.
00:53:41.320 - 00:53:42.872, Speaker B: And we're just facilitating that.
00:53:42.968 - 00:53:55.976, Speaker A: It's not someone who is sitting on binance trying to manipulate an oracle update by dumping the price, and then it's not someone, or it's not someone who knows that a token is about to.
00:53:56.000 - 00:53:58.366, Speaker B: Collapse because there's been some kind of.
00:53:58.510 - 00:54:02.702, Speaker A: Hack or something like that, and it's trying to take advantage of it. Typically, it's.
00:54:02.798 - 00:54:05.190, Speaker B: 99% of it is just uninformed arbitrage.
00:54:05.222 - 00:54:08.430, Speaker A: Flow moving between exchanges and amms and.
00:54:08.462 - 00:54:10.526, Speaker B: All kinds of stuff. So we want that flow.
00:54:10.630 - 00:54:12.494, Speaker A: So how do we pay for that order flow?
00:54:12.574 - 00:54:13.910, Speaker B: We pay for it with lower fees.
00:54:13.982 - 00:54:17.166, Speaker A: And we say we're going to build a direct integration into curve and give.
00:54:17.190 - 00:54:21.154, Speaker B: You lower fees if you accommodate this new route.
00:54:21.654 - 00:54:24.218, Speaker A: And that is a really good way of.
00:54:24.286 - 00:54:32.654, Speaker B: Of generating more volume because it's valuable to us to have uninformed order flow, right. And, you know, not have, like, adverse selection.
00:54:33.394 - 00:54:36.774, Speaker D: Jason's never going to invite me back on this podcast again if I keep going.
00:54:39.234 - 00:55:02.108, Speaker C: I've been spending a lot of. A lot of time in, like, the maker with maker, and, like, just read, like, thinking about, like, hasu and, like, you know, his proposal and rune and, like, his end game. And I actually do want to get your take on what's going on with maker, but not yet. I want to get your, I'd love to just hear, like, what is your end game for Synthetix? Like, what do you. What is, what is the vision for synthetix?
00:55:02.276 - 00:55:08.780, Speaker A: I think my vision versus, like, what the vision is, you know, sometimes gets conflated.
00:55:08.852 - 00:55:09.012, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:09.028 - 00:55:09.820, Speaker A: Like, it is.
00:55:09.892 - 00:55:14.308, Speaker C: I want to, I want to hear, I want to hear your vision, not the communities, not the forums, your vision.
00:55:14.396 - 00:55:32.642, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think my vision is, I want synthetix to be the thing that I've always wanted for synthetix is to be self sustaining, right? So that means that, you know, we need to get to a point where the volume and transaction activity that's happening is sustainable, right? That we don't have adverse selection, we.
00:55:32.658 - 00:55:35.410, Speaker B: Don'T have the risk of front running and all of that stuff.
00:55:35.442 - 00:55:37.330, Speaker A: And so the vast majority of the.
00:55:37.362 - 00:55:44.658, Speaker B: Work of synthetics of the last, like three years has been like front running mitigation, right? Like adverse selection mitigation and trying to.
00:55:44.746 - 00:55:54.028, Speaker A: Prevent people attacking the exchange because you've got this open system that anyone can come and trade against.
00:55:54.116 - 00:55:56.668, Speaker B: And so people are constantly attacking it.
00:55:56.796 - 00:55:58.756, Speaker A: And we've gotten more and more sophisticated.
00:55:58.860 - 00:56:04.064, Speaker B: At preventing those sorts of attacks and trying to minimize the damage of them.
00:56:04.604 - 00:56:07.196, Speaker A: But right now it's still like an.
00:56:07.220 - 00:56:08.908, Speaker B: Arms race that is ongoing.
00:56:09.076 - 00:56:17.182, Speaker A: And so you can't just say all the contracts are there. See you later. Within six months, someone would develop some new scheme to like, try and extract.
00:56:17.238 - 00:56:22.398, Speaker B: Value from the contracts. That would be significantly bad, you know, like, it would be very detrimental.
00:56:22.446 - 00:56:25.446, Speaker A: Right. I would imagine over time, obviously, that.
00:56:25.470 - 00:56:29.718, Speaker B: Risk goes down because we've kind of like. But we chipped away at the advantage.
00:56:29.766 - 00:56:31.950, Speaker A: But like, that is just a very.
00:56:32.022 - 00:56:33.894, Speaker B: Real thing that is ongoing with synthetics.
00:56:33.974 - 00:56:39.422, Speaker A: So until we get to a point where we're like, okay, this feels like we've got a long term solution that.
00:56:39.438 - 00:56:44.644, Speaker B: Is sustainable, like a sustainable equilibrium, then you have to keep working on it, right.
00:56:44.684 - 00:56:56.060, Speaker A: So that's the first thing. I think the second thing is to get to a point where the community, and particularly stakers, are sufficiently incentivized to.
00:56:56.172 - 00:56:58.344, Speaker B: Continue to maintain the protocol.
00:56:59.244 - 00:57:07.020, Speaker A: It's generating fees, it's working, and there's a lot of distributed parties that have.
00:57:07.092 - 00:57:09.204, Speaker B: A significant incentive in keeping the thing.
00:57:09.244 - 00:57:12.194, Speaker A: Alive at the moment there.
00:57:12.534 - 00:57:15.270, Speaker B: I think if you kind of switched.
00:57:15.302 - 00:57:17.558, Speaker A: Off the efforts of the core contributors.
00:57:17.606 - 00:57:20.254, Speaker B: Let'S say, and the Dow stopped paying.
00:57:20.294 - 00:57:24.958, Speaker A: Them, would people turn up and do things like, are the incentives aligned for.
00:57:24.966 - 00:57:28.354, Speaker B: Them to continue to do things? Probably not.
00:57:28.734 - 00:57:37.510, Speaker A: At a certain point, though, when the yield is high enough from fees and transactions. And when the risk adjusted adverse selection.
00:57:37.582 - 00:57:42.716, Speaker B: Issues are dealt with, people I think would just continue to work on it because they're making money from it.
00:57:42.740 - 00:57:49.476, Speaker A: And, you know, it becomes more like a genuine open source project, right, where like, there's people who are reliant on.
00:57:49.620 - 00:57:52.596, Speaker B: You know, it as a service and we'll contribute to it.
00:57:52.700 - 00:58:01.476, Speaker A: So for me, that's my vision is like to get to a point where like, across all dimensions synthetics is sustainable. And, you know, it's never, I don't.
00:58:01.540 - 00:58:05.464, Speaker B: Believe in this idea of like, it just gets to like a stable point and then it stops, right?
00:58:05.504 - 00:58:08.144, Speaker A: And then like, the contracts are done and, you know, I think there's always.
00:58:08.184 - 00:58:14.656, Speaker B: Going to be ongoing maintenance. But the key is to make sure that that ongoing maintenance is properly incentivized long term.
00:58:14.760 - 00:58:16.184, Speaker A: So you don't need to keep pushing.
00:58:16.224 - 00:58:19.832, Speaker B: It to keep that maintenance and keep the momentum going.
00:58:19.928 - 00:58:47.200, Speaker C: There's an interesting dichotomy between, like, I hate the term web two and web3, actually, but I will, I will use it here, which is like web two founders and web3 founders, which is what's, what's the end state for web two founders? Like, I want to IPO or I want to get a big exit. And like, when you talk to a lot of web3, like, I don't know, crypto native founders, oftentimes the end state, the end game, the end goal is self sustaining. Why do you think that is? Like, why is that your end state?
00:58:47.352 - 00:58:59.520, Speaker A: Because if you look at a web two founder, most of the time, they've created some multi tier equity structure where they retain control. Them and their descendants retain control of.
00:58:59.552 - 00:59:03.714, Speaker B: This thing in perpetuity, right? And realistically that's not sustainable.
00:59:03.834 - 00:59:15.922, Speaker A: And I think web3 people fundamentally believe, like, at some point I will die, at some point in the future, I will die, right? So if synthetix is reliant on me being alive, that is not sustainable, right? And that's a very, like, philosophical way.
00:59:15.938 - 00:59:16.970, Speaker B: To approach the problem.
00:59:17.002 - 00:59:18.642, Speaker A: But like, if we don't have the.
00:59:18.658 - 00:59:20.894, Speaker B: Right incentives in place such that someone.
00:59:21.194 - 00:59:23.722, Speaker A: Steps up or, you know, ideally a.
00:59:23.738 - 00:59:25.282, Speaker B: Lot of people step up to continue.
00:59:25.378 - 00:59:28.276, Speaker A: To maintain this project and maintain its.
00:59:28.300 - 00:59:30.636, Speaker B: Value and continue to push it forward.
00:59:30.780 - 00:59:32.380, Speaker A: In absence of me being here, then.
00:59:32.412 - 00:59:37.892, Speaker B: It'S not really sustainable. We've seen this happen in a lot of web two companies.
00:59:37.988 - 00:59:42.724, Speaker A: The founder leader leaves and the thing falls over because it was never really sustainable.
00:59:42.764 - 00:59:45.984, Speaker B: It just was relying on the efforts of that one person keep pushing forward.
00:59:47.004 - 00:59:52.710, Speaker A: So I think that is one of the reasons why a lot of us are. A lot of the early crypto people.
00:59:52.812 - 00:59:58.522, Speaker B: Know, very like, crypto anarchist, and, you know, believe that you should have, like, distributed control and you shouldn't have like.
00:59:58.538 - 01:00:07.658, Speaker A: A single hierarchical, you know, tree of decision making, et cetera. And so in that environment, the only way that you can have something that's sustainable is you have the right incentives.
01:00:07.706 - 01:00:10.362, Speaker B: To, like, keep the thing going long term in absence of.
01:00:10.458 - 01:00:12.850, Speaker A: Right, this founder leader, you know, idea.
01:00:13.002 - 01:00:37.234, Speaker C: Long term to become self sustaining, you obviously have to be set up as a dao. But I'm curious if. If. Do you think you would be more or less successful, like, up until this point, if you were not set up as a doe, if you were just a centralized company, you were the CEO, you could execute really quickly, you could hire the people that you wanted to hire. You could ship the products that you wanted to ship. Would you be more or less successful up until this point if you were not a doe?
01:00:37.894 - 01:00:48.496, Speaker A: Far less successful. And this is the thing that people miss, right? Who is perpetuating this myth of these magical geniuses that know everything, that have.
01:00:48.520 - 01:00:50.120, Speaker B: Like, this game plan or whatever, right?
01:00:50.192 - 01:01:03.336, Speaker A: Fucking VC's and the people themselves, right? Like, you know it, like, there is no such thing as, like, this magical per. Like, okay, Vitalik notwithstanding, right? Like, and even Vitalik isn't sitting there.
01:01:03.360 - 01:01:10.624, Speaker B: Saying, like, do everything that I say, right. Most of the thing that. Things that Vitalik says tend to be pretty, right? Like, over a long enough time horizon.
01:01:10.704 - 01:01:12.608, Speaker A: But, like, you know, I guarantee you.
01:01:12.616 - 01:01:14.906, Speaker B: That even Vitalik short term has, like.
01:01:14.930 - 01:01:17.746, Speaker A: I mean, we know that, right? Like, Vitalik got up there, you know.
01:01:17.850 - 01:01:30.322, Speaker B: Multiple times and told us, like, some new thing was going to be the best thing ever. And if he had had, like, unilateral control to, like, push forward every single change, and the community just accepted every single thing, and there was no pushback from engineers or whatever, we would have.
01:01:30.338 - 01:01:31.506, Speaker A: Gone down a very different path and.
01:01:31.530 - 01:01:36.826, Speaker B: Probably would be much further away from the scaling goals that, you know, we, we have for ethereum, right?
01:01:36.890 - 01:01:50.350, Speaker A: The same is true for every single project and every, you know, if literally we listen to everything that rune said. Like, I love rune, but, like, he has some dumb ideas sometimes, right? Like, and so do I. Like, so you need checks and balances, right?
01:01:50.382 - 01:01:53.110, Speaker B: And I think what we have in.
01:01:53.222 - 01:01:54.806, Speaker A: A web two company in terms of.
01:01:54.830 - 01:01:57.074, Speaker B: Checks and balances is very weak, right?
01:01:57.374 - 01:02:17.818, Speaker A: And, you know, so we have this survivorship bias where, you know, you have a whole bunch of companies with single leaders, very hierarchical, and, like, ten of them survive and we go, oh my God, look at these ten magical creatures that have come down to, like, save us from ourselves or whatever, right? Like the other thousand that we made separate, random, dumb decisions and died.
01:02:17.866 - 01:02:19.178, Speaker B: We don't care about them, right?
01:02:19.266 - 01:02:30.386, Speaker A: So when we look at web3 and think, okay, how do we not fall prey to this idea of like, a magical leader that knows everything, you know, omnipotent or whatever, the answer is.
01:02:30.410 - 01:02:34.876, Speaker B: Like, you, you put structures in place to make sure that governance is much more decentralized.
01:02:34.940 - 01:02:46.828, Speaker A: And the reality is that decentralized decision making, while it might be slower, is much more effective. That is unequivocal for me. I think Daos and genuinely decentralized DAos.
01:02:46.876 - 01:02:52.300, Speaker B: Will out compete other organizations and other forms of coordination over the next ten to 20 years.
01:02:52.372 - 01:03:01.120, Speaker A: And in hindsight, we'll look back and be like, wow, that was so obvious. Who thought that Adam Newman was the fucking guy that we should be giving, you know, billions? Like, why are we giving that guy.
01:03:01.152 - 01:03:03.568, Speaker B: Unilateral control over, like, tens of billions of dollars?
01:03:03.616 - 01:03:08.240, Speaker A: Right? Like, no, like, it's just dumb, right? It's dumb and it's a meme that.
01:03:08.312 - 01:03:12.524, Speaker B: Has been perpetuated by VC's and the founders themselves.
01:03:13.024 - 01:03:22.804, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you think, you think this will be the case for all companies? Like, all companies? Like, you think Daos will eventually, in all industries get bigger than centralized companies? Or you think it's specific to defi.
01:03:23.174 - 01:03:38.686, Speaker A: I think human coordination is human coordination. Corporations as a form of coordination have had a very good run, but everything evolves. And when you look back 50 years and look forward 50 years, reality looks.
01:03:38.710 - 01:03:42.194, Speaker B: Very different oftentimes as we progress.
01:03:42.894 - 01:03:45.542, Speaker A: I think that the idea that you.
01:03:45.558 - 01:03:51.290, Speaker B: Have this new coordination mechanism that exists, this new technology, is not going to.
01:03:51.322 - 01:03:55.506, Speaker A: Transform how we coordinate ourselves is very crazy to me.
01:03:55.530 - 01:03:55.666, Speaker D: Right.
01:03:55.690 - 01:04:00.722, Speaker A: Like, obviously it will in the same way that, like, people are like, oh, you know, the Internet, it's interesting, but I don't think it's going to have.
01:04:00.738 - 01:04:02.610, Speaker B: A huge impact on anyone's lives. Right?
01:04:02.642 - 01:04:09.938, Speaker A: Like, there are a lot of people who, because they just don't have the, like, vision to, like, you know, and it's not like you are sitting there saying, I know exactly how this is.
01:04:09.946 - 01:04:14.378, Speaker B: Going to play out. Like, I know how the Internet in, you know, 1990 is going to play out in 20.
01:04:14.466 - 01:04:17.922, Speaker A: No one knows, right? But, like, you can sit there and say, I don't know, but I know.
01:04:17.938 - 01:04:19.498, Speaker B: That it's going to be fucking weird.
01:04:19.626 - 01:04:26.682, Speaker A: And stuff's going to happen. And I think that that's the same thing for crypto. I don't know if daos are going to look like what they look like today.
01:04:26.738 - 01:04:27.978, Speaker B: It would be weird if they did.
01:04:28.066 - 01:04:29.810, Speaker A: But there's no question that this technology.
01:04:29.922 - 01:04:34.334, Speaker B: Is going to unseat the technology that we have in place today.
01:04:34.914 - 01:04:55.046, Speaker D: Kane our analysts are going to kill us if we don't ask you at least some technical questions about the V three upgrade. Some of the features, they're literally going to get murdered. The features there are multicoloral, staking, customizable debt positions, permissionless cents. So maybe if you want to touch on some of those. But like, just from a high level, like, what is V three? What are some of the big changes that folks should be expecting? Yeah.
01:04:55.070 - 01:05:03.806, Speaker A: So I think V three is our chance to rebuild the protocol from scratch, taking into account all of the things that we have learned of the last.
01:05:03.950 - 01:05:06.102, Speaker B: Four and a half, five years. Right.
01:05:06.278 - 01:05:10.430, Speaker A: And so, you know, they're like. And even there were just things that.
01:05:10.462 - 01:05:15.360, Speaker B: Were not even contemplated, right? Like, from like a technical perspective, right?
01:05:15.432 - 01:05:20.456, Speaker A: This idea of like continuous time functions, like we, you know, they existed, but.
01:05:20.480 - 01:05:23.200, Speaker B: There were no implementations in solidity back then, right.
01:05:23.272 - 01:05:26.672, Speaker A: And even like proxy architecture. And like all, there's so many things.
01:05:26.728 - 01:05:37.376, Speaker B: Where we just had to cobble together some solution to make it work at the time, you know, back in 2018 or, you know, even earlier in the case of some of the, like, haven code.
01:05:37.560 - 01:05:42.894, Speaker A: And so we've learned a whole bunch of things and the industry has gotten much more sophisticated.
01:05:43.014 - 01:05:52.390, Speaker B: There's a lot more kind of design and mechanism work that's happened, and we.
01:05:52.502 - 01:06:08.074, Speaker A: Have looked at all of the functional components. So Synthetix requires claiming of fees. Okay, great. So back in the day we were like, what if you claim the fees once a week and you have to do this weird convoluted thing and it was super expensive, whatever. And now today we have a mechanism.
01:06:08.114 - 01:06:13.522, Speaker B: For claiming fees that continuous time that most protocols use. And it's just the understood way to.
01:06:13.538 - 01:06:25.002, Speaker A: Do this thing, but we can't slice out that little bit of code and replace it because the overall thing is just so complex. We basically said, okay, let's take all.
01:06:25.018 - 01:06:30.058, Speaker B: Of the functional components, look at what the state of the art is in terms of how you implement them today.
01:06:30.106 - 01:06:35.302, Speaker A: On chain design, a system around those components. So it's doing the same thing in.
01:06:35.318 - 01:06:37.430, Speaker B: Just a much more effective way, basically.
01:06:37.622 - 01:06:40.270, Speaker A: And then there's some things where, like, that was a dumb idea, let's remove.
01:06:40.302 - 01:06:41.994, Speaker B: It and replace it with a better idea.
01:06:42.414 - 01:07:03.524, Speaker D: What do you think about so one of the things that I think you have to keep in mind, right. Especially as a Defi founder today, right. Is regulation, especially us based regulation. Be curious to get your thought on, like, for cents. Do you, like, expect to just be able to cause. One of the things that I think you're introducing as well is like, permissionlessness. So, you know, the ability to create something like an equity.
01:07:03.564 - 01:07:03.740, Speaker A: Right.
01:07:03.772 - 01:07:15.504, Speaker D: Like an instrument that mimics, like, Tesla stock or apple or something like that. I think us regulators have been not super kindly predisposed to. So, like, I'd be, I'd be curious to get your thoughts about, like, about just that whole interaction.
01:07:15.804 - 01:07:27.508, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you know, I think if you go back three weeks ago or whatever, right. Most Defi founders would say, say that, like, we weren't in an environment where.
01:07:27.676 - 01:07:31.812, Speaker B: Something like OFAC sanctions were super likely, right.
01:07:31.868 - 01:07:37.404, Speaker A: You know, or even like some other regulatory body, like, really, like bringing the hammer down. Right. It's one thing to, like, you know.
01:07:37.444 - 01:07:41.996, Speaker B: Go after some fraudulent actors and punish them and make them disgorge profits or.
01:07:42.060 - 01:07:44.628, Speaker A: Whatever, but we hadn't really seen, like.
01:07:44.676 - 01:07:56.560, Speaker B: A lot of aggressive behavior towards what I would call, like, good actors in the space. Like, people that were, like, genuinely, you know, trying to build things that had value for, for their communities and society.
01:07:56.752 - 01:08:06.128, Speaker A: I think that has shifted a little bit. Right. So previously I would have been like, well, you know, synthetix is sufficiently decentralized that even if a regulator might not.
01:08:06.176 - 01:08:13.444, Speaker B: Like the idea of synthetic equities, if the community decides to deploy a permissionless contract to do it, right, that's fine.
01:08:14.184 - 01:08:28.388, Speaker A: But I would say today the kind of trade off space there has shifted a little bit where I would say, like, probably you shouldn't do that. The community probably shouldn't do that. Now, okay. You create permissionless since, and same way.
01:08:28.396 - 01:08:36.636, Speaker B: That you create permissionless uniswap pools and you can't really stop people. But what that's forced Uniswap to do as, like, uniswap labs, I guess, right?
01:08:36.660 - 01:08:39.892, Speaker A: Like, promptly is like, blacklist a bunch of assets, right?
01:08:39.948 - 01:08:41.414, Speaker B: And you remove them from.
01:08:41.444 - 01:08:44.698, Speaker A: From front ends and things like that. So that's not something that synthetix as.
01:08:44.706 - 01:08:46.334, Speaker B: A community has typically done.
01:08:46.874 - 01:08:48.202, Speaker A: But I just think we need to.
01:08:48.218 - 01:08:52.938, Speaker B: Be much more mindful given the current environment than we were.
01:08:53.106 - 01:08:54.626, Speaker A: So I think you would have a.
01:08:54.650 - 01:09:01.514, Speaker B: Hard time convincing the council, who are ultimately the representatives of token holders, I.
01:09:01.514 - 01:09:05.494, Speaker A: Think you'd have a hard time convincing them to create.
01:09:06.794 - 01:09:10.094, Speaker D: How about, um, I know another idea that you've talked a lot about.
01:09:10.134 - 01:09:10.310, Speaker C: Right.
01:09:10.342 - 01:09:15.594, Speaker D: Is, uh, liquidity as a service. Can you walk through. Walk us through, like, what that means for you specifically?
01:09:16.894 - 01:09:23.870, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, there's a lot of people that are trying to experiment with this, right. Um, you know, they're like, protocol loan.
01:09:23.902 - 01:09:27.954, Speaker B: Liquidity, and, you know, different. Different things like that.
01:09:28.574 - 01:09:46.976, Speaker A: And so I think, you know, we. Unfortunately, a lot of the projects that were experimenting with that stuff tacked on weird ponzies, which kind of created a little bit of a weird sense for.
01:09:47.000 - 01:09:51.404, Speaker B: People that maybe it was not as legitimate of an idea.
01:09:51.744 - 01:10:03.956, Speaker A: But I think that the reality is that liquidity is one of the most critical things defi. And so if you can facilitate more.
01:10:03.980 - 01:10:06.796, Speaker B: Efficient trading, people will pay for that.
01:10:06.860 - 01:10:08.524, Speaker A: And we're seeing that with atomic swaps.
01:10:08.644 - 01:10:11.020, Speaker B: So, like, synthetix is this, like, liquidity.
01:10:11.052 - 01:10:15.424, Speaker A: As a service that is injected into the middle of, like, an arbitrage trade.
01:10:15.764 - 01:10:17.444, Speaker B: It just makes that trade more efficient.
01:10:17.524 - 01:10:17.836, Speaker C: Right.
01:10:17.900 - 01:10:18.956, Speaker A: And people are willing to pay for.
01:10:18.980 - 01:10:24.796, Speaker B: That because they get a better fill, etcetera. It's kind of like that payment for order flow stuff that we're talking about as well.
01:10:24.980 - 01:10:28.486, Speaker A: So I do think that, like, a lot of what we're doing in Defi.
01:10:28.510 - 01:10:30.694, Speaker B: Is just about provisioning liquidity.
01:10:30.854 - 01:10:36.394, Speaker A: And then the question is, like, how do you pay for it and who pays for it, who benefits, et cetera?
01:10:38.174 - 01:10:55.758, Speaker D: I have just. Whenever you're looking at something as complicated as provisioning liquidity, I think it would be an interesting exercise for listeners. If you had to sum that up and describe synthetix in one sentence for your business model, how would you do that? Because I've thought about this for blockworks, too.
01:10:55.886 - 01:11:06.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I like, you know, this is not the first time that I've. That I've been presented, like, even, like, you know, in the community.
01:11:06.294 - 01:11:06.486, Speaker C: Right?
01:11:06.510 - 01:11:08.286, Speaker A: Like, people turn up and they're like, what do we do?
01:11:08.350 - 01:11:11.046, Speaker B: And I'm like, I don't know. Like, we do a bunch of random stuff. Right?
01:11:11.230 - 01:11:17.598, Speaker A: So, like, you know, inspiring. Yeah, exactly. I know, right? Like, I think ultimately, like, synthetics is. And I've said this.
01:11:17.646 - 01:11:24.774, Speaker B: I've said this before, man times, rather, synthetix is less about being a specific solution to a specific problem as it is.
01:11:24.854 - 01:11:30.614, Speaker A: Like a generalized, like, solution machine, if that makes sense.
01:11:30.654 - 01:11:30.806, Speaker B: Right?
01:11:30.830 - 01:11:36.726, Speaker A: Like, what. What we're, you know, we see opportunities, and we try and solve whatever the.
01:11:36.750 - 01:11:41.006, Speaker B: Challenges are for, like, taking advantage of those opportunities. So, like, atomic swaps is a good example of that, right?
01:11:41.030 - 01:11:56.058, Speaker A: Like, that was not part of the core synthetics, you know, mission. Right? Like, it was really, like, we wanted to build an exchange where you could trade synthetic derivatives of things, whatever. And then just the market shifted. Amms became a big deal curve, and.
01:11:56.106 - 01:11:59.938, Speaker B: Stable swaps and all that stuff became a big deal. And we just saw this market opportunity.
01:11:59.986 - 01:12:06.922, Speaker A: Where, like, wait, you know, if you have two pools that are super liquid but are disconnected.
01:12:07.018 - 01:12:07.682, Speaker B: Right.
01:12:07.858 - 01:12:10.050, Speaker A: And siloed, if you could bridge those.
01:12:10.082 - 01:12:12.934, Speaker B: Two pools, you could, you know, capture a lot of value, right?
01:12:13.014 - 01:12:22.126, Speaker A: And so, you know, literally, we went out and tried to solve that, and we've still, you know, it's taken. We had, like, a bunch of smart people, Andre and Anton, from one inch.
01:12:22.150 - 01:12:23.790, Speaker B: And, you know, a bunch of people.
01:12:23.822 - 01:12:25.566, Speaker A: Trying to solve this thing, right?
01:12:25.710 - 01:12:31.710, Speaker B: And, you know, it turns out it's really hard problem to solve, to do it in a way that's, like, not front runnable and not exploitable.
01:12:31.902 - 01:12:34.030, Speaker A: So, again, I kind of think, like.
01:12:34.102 - 01:12:41.106, Speaker B: Synthetix is about just trying to solve hard problems, not about, like, any specific solution, I guess.
01:12:41.130 - 01:13:17.512, Speaker D: Just the last question. This also comes from our analysts. You kind of talked about it with the decision to go off the inflationary schedule. And the way you maybe describe that is not to put words in your mouth, but maybe it's not about the kitchen sink type thing, but it's definitely a very important decision that I'm sure you've chewed over quite a bit. Can you, again, kind of sum up for us? What is the reasoning behind moving off the inflationary model? What are some of the risks that you see in your mind, and what do you hope to gain when you come out of the other side not being dependent on that? Other than the 300 meme, which I'm sure you can rip great Leonidas memes all day long, but what's Valhalla?
01:13:17.648 - 01:13:34.872, Speaker A: So we actually. And this got less attention, but we actually tried the alternative. We actually tried to increase the inflation rate to see if it would have an impact on staking. And I had this idea that if you increased inflation significantly, you would get.
01:13:34.888 - 01:13:35.904, Speaker B: A higher staking rate.
01:13:35.984 - 01:13:41.480, Speaker A: Now, staking in synthetics is kind of critical, particularly in V two x and current system.
01:13:41.552 - 01:13:47.208, Speaker B: In V three, it's less critical. But in V two x, it's critical that people stake s and x to provide liquidity.
01:13:47.336 - 01:13:53.048, Speaker A: And we were pretty regularly trading above peg. We're having a hard time getting enough.
01:13:53.096 - 01:13:56.124, Speaker B: Synths into the circulation to meet demand.
01:13:56.504 - 01:14:05.522, Speaker A: And so the idea was, well, we're only seeing about 65% of SNX state. Back at its peak in 2019, it.
01:14:05.538 - 01:14:08.850, Speaker B: Was like 85 or 90% or something like that.
01:14:08.962 - 01:14:12.706, Speaker A: And that was with a higher inflation rate. So we're like, okay, fee yield is not sufficient right?
01:14:12.730 - 01:14:16.266, Speaker B: Now, what if we increase the inflation rate and we did and really didn't move?
01:14:16.370 - 01:14:23.618, Speaker A: Now, my argument was, we've been given enough time, right? And that, like, you know, maybe, which is my. That's always my argument, right?
01:14:23.666 - 01:14:24.754, Speaker B: Like, you just need more time.
01:14:24.794 - 01:14:28.192, Speaker A: But, like, you know, maybe after six months or twelve months of higher inflation.
01:14:28.248 - 01:14:33.408, Speaker B: Maybe it would have moved the dial. But at a certain point, you need to say, well, look, we've experimented with this, and it didn't work.
01:14:33.456 - 01:14:38.264, Speaker A: Right? So we started decreasing the inflation rate.
01:14:38.424 - 01:14:42.080, Speaker B: About, like, five or six weeks ago or whatever in response to the fact.
01:14:42.112 - 01:14:44.472, Speaker A: That, like, this number that we're trying.
01:14:44.488 - 01:14:46.752, Speaker B: To get and, like, the staking percentage just didn't move.
01:14:46.808 - 01:14:53.646, Speaker A: Right. And so my theory is, well, okay, we tried it in that direction. Let's try it in the other direction. Like, if in incentives from staking are.
01:14:53.670 - 01:15:02.678, Speaker B: Not the inflation, inflationary rewards are not sufficient to move the dial. What if we remove it? Will people keep staking?
01:15:02.846 - 01:15:07.966, Speaker A: And if staking rates drop, then I think we'll need to assess that. But if we end up in a.
01:15:07.990 - 01:15:09.822, Speaker B: Place where 50% of SNX is still.
01:15:09.878 - 01:15:12.246, Speaker A: Staked just for the fee yield and.
01:15:12.270 - 01:15:14.150, Speaker B: People have an expectation future fee yield.
01:15:14.182 - 01:15:17.014, Speaker A: Will go up, then theoretically, that should.
01:15:17.094 - 01:15:22.898, Speaker B: Create a positive cycle, because you've got less SNX kind of being printed every.
01:15:22.946 - 01:15:32.602, Speaker A: Week, and there's a lot of people, I think, out there who sell their inflation. So even though inflation is locked, there's a lot of people with unlocked SNX that can. Okay, I got one hundred s and X.
01:15:32.618 - 01:15:33.250, Speaker B: Well, I'm going to sell.
01:15:33.322 - 01:15:34.146, Speaker A: I'm going to go and hedge my.
01:15:34.170 - 01:15:38.082, Speaker B: Exposure for that year by selling 100 spot SNX today.
01:15:38.258 - 01:15:43.146, Speaker A: And so you remove that constant selling pressure, even if it's only 20% of.
01:15:43.170 - 01:15:45.018, Speaker B: Inflation or whatever that's being sold every.
01:15:45.066 - 01:15:47.330, Speaker A: Week, you remove that, and I think.
01:15:47.362 - 01:15:50.426, Speaker B: That that will have a positive feedback loop in terms of, you know, kind.
01:15:50.450 - 01:15:54.466, Speaker A: Of price discovery and realignment. So that's. That's the overall reasoning.
01:15:54.490 - 01:15:56.094, Speaker B: But also the 300 meme.
01:15:56.434 - 01:15:57.954, Speaker C: Also do it for the meme.
01:15:57.994 - 01:15:58.682, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:15:58.738 - 01:16:17.948, Speaker C: Um. Okay, I want to think about wrapping just with a. More. With that. Uh, two topics that are not related to synthetics. One is, I want to get your take on maker and, like, Hasu and Roon, and just everything that's happening there. Uh, the other is, I want to get your take on protocol specific stables, like aave rolling out stables.
01:16:17.948 - 01:16:21.704, Speaker C: I'm curious. Yeah, I mean, you can start where. Where do you want to start?
01:16:22.084 - 01:16:31.156, Speaker A: Look, let me address the stable point thing first, right? Like, you know, this go, this speaks, I think, to Michael's point earlier about.
01:16:31.180 - 01:16:35.476, Speaker B: Like, returning money to investors versus like, reinvesting it, right?
01:16:35.580 - 01:17:06.370, Speaker A: Like is Aave whatever Aave is, right? The best thing that aave token holders could be giving capital to, like, the best entity, the best whatever thing to be investing it, right? Like, because you get to a point where people are building empires, right? They're like, oh, stablecoins sound fun, like, why don't we do that, right? Or maybe we'll build a social network or whatever, right? So if you are giving money, like, yes, Stanley is amazing, and yes, the.
01:17:06.402 - 01:17:09.626, Speaker B: Aave community is amazing. They've done an incredible job over the last five years.
01:17:09.690 - 01:17:13.402, Speaker A: But like, am I giving them my marginal dollar to go and build something?
01:17:13.458 - 01:17:14.930, Speaker B: Because I think this great idea, like.
01:17:15.002 - 01:17:23.242, Speaker A: That'S not how we solve investment, right? Like, we find a small team that's got a very clear idea of what they want to do when we give them the money and say, go out.
01:17:23.258 - 01:17:25.034, Speaker B: And do this thing, right? And focus on it.
01:17:25.114 - 01:17:29.810, Speaker A: So in that sense, like returning funds to token holders so that you don't.
01:17:29.842 - 01:17:31.362, Speaker B: Have this giant pool of capital where.
01:17:31.378 - 01:17:40.748, Speaker A: You'Re like, oh, what are we doing today? I guess we're going to, you know, whatever, right? So that, that's what I worry. And, you know, the second thing is, I think people think people have forgotten.
01:17:40.836 - 01:17:42.344, Speaker B: That stable coins are hard.
01:17:43.204 - 01:17:48.972, Speaker A: Like, and you know, this speaks to maker, right? Like, why did they forget this? Because maker just jammed a bunch of.
01:17:48.988 - 01:17:52.164, Speaker B: USDC into like a rapper contract and called it a day, right?
01:17:52.204 - 01:18:00.882, Speaker A: Like, you know, and I say that like, in the meanest possible way because I've been against this the entire time. But like, it made people have this false sense of like, oh, it's not.
01:18:00.898 - 01:18:02.650, Speaker B: That hard to have a decentralized stablecoin.
01:18:02.762 - 01:18:08.794, Speaker A: But ust look at the counterpoint, right? It's really hard to build a stable.
01:18:08.834 - 01:18:09.978, Speaker B: Coin that is sustainable.
01:18:10.066 - 01:18:12.694, Speaker A: It doesn't matter how much capital you have.
01:18:13.554 - 01:18:46.604, Speaker D: We were doing an analyst call, our Qth analyst call, and there was a prominent, like, Finn twitter listening, and he dm me and he said they were talking about the decentralized, like these stable coins, like go and the curve one. He was like, do you realize that your analysts are just describing private banknotes? And I had to sit and think about that and I was like, shit, that is literally exactly right. From like the wildcat banking days, each bank would be like, hey, what do I have. I have this. A whole bunch of assets here. I can issue a dollar against them. I can do my own little private fractional reserve banking system.
01:18:46.604 - 01:18:48.492, Speaker D: And, like, that worked horrendously.
01:18:48.548 - 01:19:06.736, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's funny. Like, I. I try to reread this, like, once a year, Hayek's denationalization of money, where he talks about this idea of being able to issue your own currency, having a market driven version of.
01:19:06.760 - 01:19:10.240, Speaker B: Currency, rather than having decentralized into a central bank or whatever.
01:19:10.432 - 01:19:13.576, Speaker A: And I think the interesting thing about it is that he didn't contemplate the.
01:19:13.600 - 01:19:15.352, Speaker B: Technology, so obviously he was like, well.
01:19:15.408 - 01:19:26.764, Speaker A: The only entity that could do that would be a bank, right? Like. But now, actually, no, like, we have the technology that anyone can print their own money, and it is a much more, like, market driven thing.
01:19:26.844 - 01:19:30.148, Speaker B: The problem is that, like, not everyone should print their own money, right?
01:19:30.236 - 01:19:36.396, Speaker A: And even more importantly, it's one thing for Aave to print aave tokens, right.
01:19:36.420 - 01:19:40.356, Speaker B: As, like, a form of equity, and use them to create incentives or whatever.
01:19:40.420 - 01:19:41.724, Speaker A: It's another thing for Aave to, like.
01:19:41.764 - 01:19:43.484, Speaker B: Create their own dollars, right?
01:19:43.524 - 01:19:48.686, Speaker A: Like, that's like, a different thing. So, you know, again, I think people.
01:19:48.750 - 01:19:50.950, Speaker B: Underestimate how hard it is to manage.
01:19:50.982 - 01:19:54.622, Speaker A: A stable coin in the same way. And again, I love Aave, but I.
01:19:54.638 - 01:19:58.870, Speaker B: Think Aave has already come to this conclusion that Synthetix came to a long.
01:19:58.902 - 01:20:00.718, Speaker A: Time ago, which is, it's also really.
01:20:00.766 - 01:20:03.794, Speaker B: Hard to be on 55 different fucking networks.
01:20:05.174 - 01:20:10.334, Speaker A: If you go and deploy your code, even if it's just like, oh, we're going to dump it in. It's not as simple as just deploy the code and walk away.
01:20:10.414 - 01:20:12.830, Speaker B: You have to maintain it. You have to deal with the people.
01:20:12.862 - 01:20:13.786, Speaker A: Who are using it.
01:20:13.910 - 01:20:23.402, Speaker B: It's really hard. And oftentimes, each marginal network is going to be net negative for the protocol. It's going to be a distraction so.
01:20:23.418 - 01:20:27.090, Speaker A: That you're already seeing them pull up some of those deployments and be like.
01:20:27.122 - 01:20:28.290, Speaker B: Actually, we're going to shut this thing down.
01:20:28.322 - 01:20:34.946, Speaker A: It's not going to, but it's good experimentation. Someone needs to do that experiment. Thankfully, Aave did it for us, and.
01:20:34.970 - 01:20:41.534, Speaker B: They'Ve told us that maybe it's a bad idea to deploy into every possible evm compatible chain as quickly as possible.
01:20:42.154 - 01:20:47.418, Speaker A: But to come back to the mega question, I actually spoke to Roon for.
01:20:47.426 - 01:20:49.894, Speaker B: The first time in a little while.
01:20:50.234 - 01:21:01.226, Speaker A: Last week, and I think everyone was caught by surprise by this tornado cash thing. Okay? We sit here and we talk about.
01:21:01.250 - 01:21:07.804, Speaker B: All this cypherpunk stuff and anti status stuff, censorship, resistance, whatever.
01:21:08.264 - 01:21:11.720, Speaker A: I really don't think in the same way that, like, everyone was a bit.
01:21:11.752 - 01:21:17.208, Speaker B: Caught by surprise by like, the aggressiveness of the SEC, you know, over the.
01:21:17.216 - 01:21:23.624, Speaker A: Last 18 months, I think we all kind of thought we had a bit more time before, like, we genuinely had.
01:21:23.664 - 01:21:28.536, Speaker B: State actors coming after us, right? And I think that that was maker's thesis, realistically, right?
01:21:28.560 - 01:21:29.344, Speaker A: They're like, oh, this is not going.
01:21:29.344 - 01:21:32.684, Speaker B: To be a problem. Like, USCC is fine, you know, it's.
01:21:32.724 - 01:21:35.996, Speaker A: Not like an existential threat, etcetera. And now I think we're seeing that.
01:21:36.020 - 01:21:37.180, Speaker B: Like, actually it is, right?
01:21:37.212 - 01:21:54.092, Speaker A: Like, they have the ability to block token addresses. They are not just willing to do it, but like they're eager to do it, right? And with the right incentives, you like, you know, circle is eager to, like, they will over comply, right? Like, Ofac didn't come to them and.
01:21:54.108 - 01:21:55.292, Speaker B: Be like, hey, go and block all.
01:21:55.308 - 01:21:57.068, Speaker A: These addresses, as far as we know, right?
01:21:57.156 - 01:22:03.630, Speaker B: They looked at it and said, what is the biggest de risking thing that we can do? Block everything, right? And just like, shut down those addresses.
01:22:03.702 - 01:22:42.168, Speaker A: And the idea of like, stranding end user funds, right? And like, not insignificant amounts of money in these contracts as like an over compliance thing is like petrifying to maker as well it should be, right? Like, you know, all, like, what is the threshold that would get some entity, you know, like, it doesn't have to be ofac, could be some entity in Europe or who knows? It could be anything. But we don't know what the reaction of circle would be. I mean, making a call to block the maker addresses as a compliance measure.
01:22:42.256 - 01:22:47.136, Speaker B: Would be pretty huge because it would almost invalidate USDC as a stable coin.
01:22:47.200 - 01:22:59.562, Speaker A: So that would be an existential threat. It's definitely a level above Tornado cash. But do we want to play that game? Right? So I think that the reality is the maker community made a bad call a long time ago about how to.
01:22:59.578 - 01:23:15.442, Speaker B: Scale Dai by just dumping a bunch of USDC in there. They thought that they would have more time to get themselves out of this mess and figure it out. But I think unfortunately they're out of time and they're going to have to make some hard decisions about what the path forward is.
01:23:15.578 - 01:23:20.604, Speaker C: So if you were the benevolent, if you were the full dictator of Maker, what are you doing?
01:23:21.544 - 01:23:24.072, Speaker A: Look, if I was a full dictator of maker, there never would have been.
01:23:24.088 - 01:23:26.080, Speaker B: Any USDC in Dai, right?
01:23:26.112 - 01:23:27.520, Speaker C: But knowing that there is, knowing that.
01:23:27.552 - 01:23:30.120, Speaker A: There is, knowing that there is, if they said to me today, hey, come.
01:23:30.152 - 01:23:38.160, Speaker B: And be the dictator of maker. I would absolutely shut down all paths going towards real world assets.
01:23:38.312 - 01:23:46.484, Speaker A: Real world assets are not the solution here. And I've been against them since when they were first proposed in like, 2018.
01:23:46.564 - 01:23:46.780, Speaker B: Right?
01:23:46.812 - 01:23:48.172, Speaker A: Like this idea, we're going to put.
01:23:48.268 - 01:23:50.944, Speaker B: You know, treasuries and all kinds of stuff in there.
01:23:51.324 - 01:24:04.532, Speaker A: So, like, I just think it's just a bad idea. You, as soon as you attach something to the, you know, real world, like a smart contract to the real world and are reliant on it, that is.
01:24:04.588 - 01:24:14.754, Speaker B: A, you know, a pressure point that anyone can leverage against you, right. And your ability to maintain censorship resistance and, you know.
01:24:16.574 - 01:24:31.910, Speaker A: Avoid regulatory pressure, etcetera, just is gone. Right. It's the same reason why I advocate for daos, to not have entities, right? As soon as you've got an entity, even if it's like a cayman's foundation or a swiss foundation or whatever, as soon as you have one entity that.
01:24:31.942 - 01:24:38.250, Speaker B: Has some control over the protocol, that is a pressure point that people can leverage to try and impact the workflow.
01:24:38.362 - 01:24:42.730, Speaker C: So your perfect collateral, like, you think the collateral of Dai should just be bitcoin and ETH.
01:24:42.802 - 01:24:53.426, Speaker A: I mean, this is the problem, right? Like, that's not the solution. Like, we've seen that, right? Like, that doesn't work. Right? Okay, so is there another solution? And I like my argument at the.
01:24:53.450 - 01:24:56.138, Speaker B: Time when this was happening was maybe.
01:24:56.186 - 01:25:08.876, Speaker A: You threw up your hands a little too soon. Right? Like, synthetics is dealt with all kinds of issues of supply constraints or whatever. And we've chosen ideologically to not deal.
01:25:08.900 - 01:25:11.972, Speaker B: With those supply constraints. By using USDC, we could have, like.
01:25:12.028 - 01:25:13.452, Speaker A: Synthetix will probably have, like, two or.
01:25:13.468 - 01:25:19.996, Speaker B: $3 billion worth of supply. Right. If we had decided a year ago or 18 months ago to just dump USDC in, like, no question. Right?
01:25:20.020 - 01:25:21.124, Speaker A: Like, it makes sense.
01:25:21.164 - 01:25:24.620, Speaker B: Like, SUSD is used to farm a bunch of things. People want more of it.
01:25:24.652 - 01:25:28.344, Speaker A: Like, USDC would have just, you know, flowed in and, like, the majority of.
01:25:28.684 - 01:25:33.836, Speaker B: Of since will be backed by USDC right now if we make that call, I think that's obvious.
01:25:33.900 - 01:25:39.116, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's my view is that, like, it's. It's fruit from the poison tree.
01:25:39.140 - 01:25:44.380, Speaker B: As soon as you take that first bite, game over, because it's going to be hard to wean yourself off. It can.
01:25:44.412 - 01:25:45.548, Speaker D: There's actually one of the biggest.
01:25:45.636 - 01:25:46.524, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:25:46.564 - 01:25:46.908, Speaker D: You get.
01:25:46.956 - 01:25:55.436, Speaker C: I was going to rap Kane. I know it's been. I think we could do this for three more hours. But this is. Yeah. Thanks for waking up early and doing this with us, it's.
01:25:55.500 - 01:25:58.624, Speaker A: Yeah, my pleasure. Definitely need another coffee, though.
01:26:00.204 - 01:26:01.132, Speaker D: Hitting the egg.
01:26:01.228 - 01:26:03.540, Speaker C: Another good. Another green juice, another espresso.
01:26:03.612 - 01:26:04.684, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:26:04.764 - 01:26:11.884, Speaker A: Exactly. But, yeah, it's been super fun. I think, like, honestly, like, a lot of these topics are topics that don't.
01:26:11.924 - 01:26:16.004, Speaker B: Necessarily get raised on, like, you know, the average show.
01:26:16.084 - 01:26:16.276, Speaker A: Right.
01:26:16.300 - 01:26:18.516, Speaker B: Like, we were just wondering about, like, what's the roadmap look like?
01:26:18.540 - 01:26:18.804, Speaker C: Whatever.
01:26:18.844 - 01:26:20.396, Speaker A: I think that, like, most of the.
01:26:20.420 - 01:26:26.654, Speaker B: Things we talked about early on are much more important than, like, specific aspects of any one project. Right. Like, they're fundamental.
01:26:26.694 - 01:26:27.094, Speaker C: I agree.
01:26:27.174 - 01:26:27.846, Speaker A: Things we need to.
01:26:27.870 - 01:26:29.982, Speaker B: We need to address to move forward, so.
01:26:30.038 - 01:26:32.046, Speaker C: Yeah, cool, man. We'll do it again soon.
01:26:32.150 - 01:26:33.382, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
01:26:33.398 - 01:26:34.022, Speaker C: All right, be well.
01:26:34.118 - 01:26:34.414, Speaker B: See ya.
