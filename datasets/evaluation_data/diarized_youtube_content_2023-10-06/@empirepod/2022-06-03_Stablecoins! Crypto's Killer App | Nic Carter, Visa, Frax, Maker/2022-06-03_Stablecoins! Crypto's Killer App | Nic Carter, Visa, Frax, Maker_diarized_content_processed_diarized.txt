00:00:00.400 - 00:00:38.546, Speaker A: Perfect. This is a big group. We could field a, I don't know, small intramural basketball team or something. So I'll be more of the quarterback here. But as Mike laid out, the name of this panel is stablecoin, the killer app. So obviously that meaning has changed a bit last week, and we were supposed to have Daquan here. He is not available this week, but I'm sure we'll talk a lot about that.
00:00:38.546 - 00:00:52.534, Speaker A: But I actually would love for you guys to introduce yourselves and give a little bit of your background, kind of how you got into crypto. But just so people are familiar with what you're doing here, we'll start with Nick, we'll go down the line, and then we can get into the killer app discussion.
00:00:52.714 - 00:01:07.734, Speaker B: Hi, everyone, and thank you to the blockworks and bankless team. Nick Carter, general partner, Castle Island Ventures. Stablecoin enthusiast, probably, but only the right kinds of stablecoins. Yeah, I'll keep it brief.
00:01:07.854 - 00:01:08.554, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:01:09.374 - 00:01:27.308, Speaker C: Nice to be here. I'm Joao Reginato, vp of product at Circle Stablecoin builder, if you want. I was the product lead for the build out of us, which is the second largest via backed stablecoin these days. And I lead all the product initiatives around stablecoins for circle today.
00:01:27.476 - 00:01:28.184, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:01:28.884 - 00:01:47.802, Speaker D: Good morning, everyone. My name is Katherine Gu. I'm from Visa. So part of the Visa crypto team. We started back in 2018, actually, during a crypto bear market. And I'm the head of the CBDCM protocol. So we're looking at all things around geocurrencies as well as protocols that, you know, layer one, L2, solutions that could be important in terms of infrastructure.
00:01:47.802 - 00:01:50.326, Speaker D: So very excited to be here, Sam.
00:01:50.390 - 00:01:58.994, Speaker E: Hello, I'm Sam. I work on the protocol engineering team. We do smart contracts development for makerdao. You may know me as hexonaut on Twitter.
00:02:01.734 - 00:02:10.474, Speaker A: You have some fans in the audience. Ok, perfect. Well, let's get into it. Nick, I'm going to start with you. I want to do a bit of a postmortem here.
00:02:11.174 - 00:02:12.274, Speaker B: Other Sam.
00:02:13.214 - 00:02:22.984, Speaker A: Oh, my God, Sam. I didn't say. Ok, hold on. Ok, hold on. I did not realize that Sam was going to be remote. Someone might have told me that, but. Wow.
00:02:23.064 - 00:02:23.600, Speaker D: Sam.
00:02:23.712 - 00:02:28.244, Speaker A: Sorry. Hello. I thought I looked over and was like, I guess Sam's not coming.
00:02:28.744 - 00:02:30.224, Speaker F: No, no, no. Hey, everyone.
00:02:30.384 - 00:02:32.164, Speaker A: Wow. Last but not least.
00:02:33.264 - 00:02:53.504, Speaker F: Yeah, so, hey, everyone, I'm Sam Kasmian, founder of Fracs Finance. Fracs is a fractional algorithmic, I guess is a weird word to say these days. So, yeah, we've been doing really well and excited to be here through the metaverse.
00:02:53.884 - 00:03:14.304, Speaker A: Love it. Okay. I missed the speaker's meeting, actually, on Friday, so anyway, I'll make sure to get you in the loop here and. All right, but we're going to start with Nick on a post mortem here for Trausd and Luna. Was this a failed idea from the beginning? Walk us through what happened here.
00:03:14.424 - 00:03:27.672, Speaker B: Yeah, it was reckless financial engineering. You know, people think of this as software engineering, but it's financial engineering. Right. And I remember calling you a couple months ago and saying, this thing's. Something bad's gonna happen. Right.
00:03:27.768 - 00:03:32.328, Speaker A: I called Nick, actually, to be like, hold on, can you explain this to me? And, yes, exactly.
00:03:32.416 - 00:04:25.942, Speaker B: So it was pretty predictable if you had a little bit of perspective and were at least somewhat familiar with the history of currency pegs, and then also just if you had a little bit of sense and you inspected the mechanism. But not many people were willing to do that because it was really veiled in complexity. And I think deliberately so often, encrypted people have a habit of making things incredibly opaque and complex so that the relevant people can't investigate and understand the mechanisms. But, yeah, I mean, a lot of people will say, oh, it's just a matter of getting the right parameters and let's try again and let's tweak this and that. But fundamentally, this is a kind of financial alchemy to try and create a truly under reserved stablecoin system that can survive and grow just based on user trust. So some things are just not worth attempting.
00:04:26.118 - 00:04:44.622, Speaker A: Why do you think there wasn't more skepticism? You, like you mentioned, were probably one of the few that at least said it publicly. Do you feel like there was a sense that people couldn't speak out against this because you had do Kwan on Twitter and a lot of believers in this project and high profile investors in this project. Was that part of the issue here?
00:04:44.718 - 00:05:13.442, Speaker B: 100%, yeah. I mean, there was a sense that you didn't want to offend your industry colleagues, your industry peers who were invested in this. Frankly, and I'll be candid, Doe was extremely aggressive with critics. I think everybody who was a high profile critic experienced that. And the terror army, they literally called themselves lunatics. There were enormous disincentives to speak out, and ultimately not that many people did. So the information market didn't clear.
00:05:13.538 - 00:05:21.058, Speaker A: Got it. I'm going to go to Sam, and if you could maybe talk about, on the technical side, your thoughts on Tara and Luna and what happened here.
00:05:21.146 - 00:05:48.756, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. With Nick completely. I mean, people were doing analysis on this. It was completely reckless and you could see that pretty much from the start. I think this kind of highlights the need for collateralization and why Makerdao has taken the more conservative approach of over collateralizing. It doesn't scale quite as quickly, but in the end, the users who are holding DAI can be certain that they can trade it for a dollar, and that's what's important.
00:05:48.900 - 00:06:12.524, Speaker A: I'd actually be interested to get both of your perspectives on this in terms of what this has done from a reputational risk when it comes to stable coins. Joao, maybe we can get your thoughts on that. For USDC, was there any thought that either from a regulatory standpoint or just from an investor confidence standpoint, that this could really be a hit to USDC and other private stable coins?
00:06:13.424 - 00:07:01.964, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's very unfortunate for the stablecoin space because our belief is that the world needs this uber dollar API that runs on chain. We're all trying to build different versions of that. But if you think about it and the way that we look at something like UIC, it is a platform. I think people tend to focus a lot on the bear asset side of a stablecoin and the end users that hold it and transact. But actually, it's such an important piece of substrate for the industry that you have all these ecosystems and developers and businesses building on top of that. And from that perspective, we feel the responsibility for building a platform that is going to be there for developers and for businesses for the long term. You can't build something that is going to be exploding in a year's time.
00:07:01.964 - 00:07:23.198, Speaker C: That's super bad for the industry, for the reputation of this kind of instrument. I don't know what complications or impact we're going to have on the regulatory side. I don't think people have been talking about it, but there's no practical change yet. But I expect this is going to be a little bit of a purple eye for the industry, right?
00:07:23.326 - 00:07:48.474, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Well, Sam, we'll get to you as well. Catherine, you are at Visa, a highly regulated company. I would love to get your thoughts working on something like this. And will it make it harder for a company like Visa to get into certain stable coins? I wonder what the process is on the company side for visa in terms of either using certain stable coins and walk us through that.
00:07:48.634 - 00:08:31.504, Speaker D: Absolutely. I mean, you know, firstly, we do think that geocurrencies will probably have a very lasting impact in terms of how the future of money movements will go and also how financial services will be constructed. And that's why with that premise, we go in with a lot of trying to figure out really interesting use cases. And I think, you know, just thinking about this space in general, visa's focus is more on the fiat backed type of currency. So that's whether it's in stable coins or central bank currencies. These are the things we want to look at, because we want to understand how the different types of future money can be moved on what different rails, and how these sort of financial services can then interact, interoperate with one another. So with that in mind, this is how we've been looking at this space.
00:08:31.504 - 00:08:55.009, Speaker D: And I think, going back to all the panelists were saying earlier, it's really important to kind of think about how these different projects are being constructed. Of course, we need to have the sort of the safeguards and also the type of standards set up, because that's important for consumers, for retail investors, for institutions, all to have that in mind. But we do think that digital currency have a very powerful impact in the future.
00:08:55.121 - 00:09:00.457, Speaker A: Got it. And Sam, there you are. I'd love to get your take on this.
00:09:00.625 - 00:09:52.772, Speaker F: Yeah, believe it or not, I actually do agree with Nick and Sam a lot of what they have to say. But let me actually paint a picture for you guys here. So, for people in the audience that aren't familiar with fracs, we're the first project to basically introduce fractional algorithmic stablecoin. So what that means is, part of the supply is backed by hard assets over collateralized loans, all the good stuff. Other stable coins, partly USDC, as well, as well as Dai. Part of the supply, actually very small of this, little of the supply right now around 11%, is algorithmic minted FrACs, which means it is, depending on how you want to call it, under collateralized, or the supply is actually stabilized by contractions and expansions. FRACs is basically 89% backed right now in real time, everything's on chain.
00:09:52.772 - 00:10:48.500, Speaker F: The dynamic adjustment of the collateral ratio is on chain. And one thing that's important to highlight is, I think, as far as I know right now, Frax and Dai are the only decentralized stable coins at scale, meaning over a billion in supply that haven't broken peg. Frax is the only algorithmic stablecoin that's never broke its peg in its 16 months since launch. I actually agree with a lot of what Nick says, because the whole reason we created fraCs, for example, is we agree that you need exogenous collateral. You actually need other collateral. That's not this kind of reflexive game of trying to stabilize the supply of the stablecoin to meet exactly demand. Part of the actual supply can be dynamically, algorithmically adjusted.
00:10:48.500 - 00:11:21.504, Speaker F: And that's basically the premise of fracs. And so far, after 16 months of, you know, growth, the protocol is extremely profitable. It has revenues of 150 million annually. With only a 1.5 billion supply. That's almost like a 10% give or take balance sheet return 20% of curves. TVL is fracs from the fracs pool because of how scalable and expansionary contractionary it is.
00:11:21.504 - 00:11:57.146, Speaker F: With even just a small amount of 11% of algorithmic supply. It's a uniswap top ten token. A lot of people have heard of fracs, used it, use it for yields. No, we don't have some kind of unsustainable 20%, 30% thing. Fracs is integrated in a lot of places. You can farm it, LP it, use it in normal, sustainable ways, and it's just sustainable and scalable. So I actually agree with Sam at Maker and Nick, which is part of the reason why we design fracs the way it is.
00:11:57.146 - 00:12:44.662, Speaker F: And actually, having talked to DoE and the terror guys, and it is really unfortunate event, and I know they're obviously really in a bad place right now in this whole thing with everyone, and it's terrible, right. There's a lot of wealth wiped out, and it's just an awful event. But the thing I wanted to say is, they started understanding this towards the end. Unfortunately, I think it was too late with the whole BTC exogenous asset stuff. They actually saw the fracs model and were saying, this is the right model that we need to go, because there's no way a 0% signage model from 2014. The original signage shares for people that are well versed in stablecoin history. Right.
00:12:44.662 - 00:13:09.402, Speaker F: The original white paper by Robert Sams, and then later, you know, the three coin system with basis. Those don't work. They don't have any assets on their balance sheet. Right. And I think it's really important for everyone to accept that. And I don't think that's a controversial thing to say. But then the next question is, where do we go next? And I think we're all kind of converging on, agreeing a lot of these.
00:13:09.402 - 00:13:12.050, Speaker F: These basically sound design decisions.
00:13:12.122 - 00:13:29.654, Speaker A: Sam, is there anything based on what's happened that you've learned from this and said, we've got to change the way we're doing things to make sure that our stablecoin doesn't lose its peg. And I also want to ask you, you mentioned it's profitable. Can you walk us through what that means for stablecoin? How is a stable coin profitable? How does that work?
00:13:29.994 - 00:14:23.142, Speaker F: So, the first part, because profitability means stable coins have assets on their balance sheet. Well, if you have collateral, like fracs, not if you don't have collateral, which is the bad idea that I think everyone on this panel completely agrees with. So you can either deploy that collateral to very safe places, or lend it on places like compound, or with things like fracs, where 11% or a dynamic amount of the supply is expandable algorithmically. So you can actually channel signage to certain places. You can actually lp different places with fracs expansions, get the trading fees from there. You can get yields, for example, from curve. Since fracs is entirely on chain, there's absolutely no collateral or any kind of market activity or market makers or anything off chain.
00:14:23.142 - 00:14:42.266, Speaker F: Everything in DeFi is open to fracs for programmatic expansion, contraction, and profitability, basically. And we have a really good way of being able to do that. So that's why we have about good a 10% currently return on balance sheet and signage. I think it's a scalable model.
00:14:42.370 - 00:14:56.450, Speaker A: Okay, that's well said. I want to ask you guys, too, about sort of the yield situation that happened with Tara and Luna. And quick answer, Sam. Are you changing anything? Are you going to change even the term algorithmic? Is there anything. You've got to pivot here.
00:14:56.522 - 00:15:52.402, Speaker F: So it's. The term algorithmic is getting to be a loaded term, but I want to actually propose something, because I think there's a lot of stuff lost in translation here. I think it's important before people get into discussing semantics or pedantic arguments, to keep things quantifiable and scientific. So, my own personal definition of algorithmic stablecoin is essentially a decentralized stablecoin, where the primary mechanism, or one of the mechanisms of stabilization, is targeting the exchange rate of the stablecoin. Not that it's entirely redeemable. Right. And so it looks more like a central bank that issues currency, rather than a depository bank that actually needs to redeem on deposits.
00:15:52.402 - 00:16:32.862, Speaker F: And so obviously that's interpretable, right? Like you can think. Okay, so fracs obviously has 89% hard assets. So that means that those are redeemable at all times. But then it also has like a dynamically adjusted, currently at 11% that is stabilized through exchange rate. But I think it's important to have actual definitions, right, so that we can talk about it. So we're not going to change anything other than trying to make fracs safer, explore new collateral. In fact, we're expanding to credit and real world lending, which is another thing that maker is innovated on and that we really like, and everything is really great with that.
00:16:32.862 - 00:16:41.806, Speaker F: So we're looking into that stuff as well. But I think just making the terms very specific is extremely important as we try to advance as an industry.
00:16:41.950 - 00:17:00.974, Speaker A: Got it, got it. Okay, thanks for that, Sam. Other Sam, I'd love to get your take on Makerdao and Dai and how that's different from what Sam is describing here, because there are a lot of different ways to sort of build what, from the outside look like a similar product. Maybe you could walk us through that.
00:17:01.054 - 00:17:37.862, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. So Makerdao has taken the approach of always being over collateralized completely. So fracs has gone a little bit further up the risk curve in that regard. So they are mostly collateralized, but not completely 100% collateralized. These are just design differences. And I think it's good to have these multiple approaches so people can pick between based on their risk tolerance and scalability and all these types of concerns. So I think it's good to have, like, these experiments as long as they're run responsibly.
00:17:37.862 - 00:18:03.094, Speaker E: And I think that's the key point. I think Fracs has done a good job of doing their stuff responsibly, so kudos to them for that. Yeah. So I think that's the main difference for us. Like, our main focus is die holders. We want to make sure that they have complete confidence that the die peg will never be lost. They can depend on that, and that's what we're optimizing for.
00:18:03.094 - 00:18:04.998, Speaker E: So that is our primary focus.
00:18:05.126 - 00:18:14.674, Speaker A: Got it. And circle with USDC is fully backed. I guess you could maybe walk us through to how, what's different in your model and what you've built.
00:18:15.374 - 00:18:16.766, Speaker C: Our motto is super boring.
00:18:16.830 - 00:18:17.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:17.854 - 00:18:19.062, Speaker A: It's probably a good thing, right, compared.
00:18:19.078 - 00:18:34.382, Speaker C: To those things that we're talking about. Our motto is very, very simple. It's full collateralization. You know, customers bring a dollar, we give them one. USC, we keep that dollar, they bring one. Usse, we give them back a dollar, and we. I was talking to Nick backstage.
00:18:34.382 - 00:19:03.564, Speaker C: USSC has actually a lot of churn. Is the stablecoin that by far redeems. It's the most redeemable stablecoin. Like in 2021, last year, we have redeemed over $61 billion. We gave $61 billion back to people who are interested in that just last week we were talking about all the movement in the market and high redemptions in some other places. We've redeemed over $7 billion just last week. And some people don't understand, but your market cap is growing.
00:19:03.564 - 00:19:28.158, Speaker C: How does that work? The thing is, our perspective is a little bit different. As I said, we want to pose questions to the ecosystem. We want to see the next global Venmo being built on top of infrastructures like this. We want to see Robinhood connecting to these things. We want to see businesses making b two b payments. They need to connect to this infrastructure. And it's really hard for them to accept something that is not fully collateralized.
00:19:28.158 - 00:19:29.046, Speaker C: Like USC.
00:19:29.150 - 00:19:49.846, Speaker A: Right. And I want to get Nick's take on this, too. But Catherine, for visa, is it only stable coins right now that are fully backed? Do you ever see a world where a company like Visa would start using Dai, or what Sam was talking about with some different models here? What would it take for a company like visa to be comfortable with adding or starting to incorporate a stable coin?
00:19:49.990 - 00:20:17.608, Speaker D: Sure. I think, you know, our focus currently at least, is definitely on the fiat backside. And we're looking at these geocurrencies and how they can sort of potentially create very interesting use cases. I think, generally speaking, you know how we're looking at the stable coin space, there's. There's the type of stable coin in which you're managing your collaterals on chain. So things like maker frags, they have all their collaterals on chain, and then you have the USDC of the world, which is managing those collaterals off the chain. That is, you deposit the money in the bank.
00:20:17.608 - 00:21:10.810, Speaker D: And the way I think we're looking at it for sure, I think by now it's pretty clear not every single stablecoin project is created equally. And when that name comes, which is stablecoin, I think we need to understand what is the risk profiles associated with it. And I think we can associate that all the way back to the zero eight crisis. If anything, even the safest asset can have risk. And that's something I think going to be true forever, right? In the sense there could be systemic risk in even the safest triple A backed mortgage. So when it comes to stable coins, we also want to understand what are the kind of, again, going back to the earlier point, which is what are the sort of safeguards and what are the standards or auditing the best practices involved, especially when it comes to this reserve management. Because I think the core, as with every protocol project, is that we want to make sure that when a user wants to redeem a par, they're able to do that at any moment, given time.
00:21:10.810 - 00:21:52.486, Speaker D: So there's a huge sort of, I think, education also that needed to be done in terms of understanding the risk profile associated with each type of stable coin or central bank digital currencies as such. And I would say the way we've been thinking about it is, one, how is that reserve being managed? Second, you know, what is that risk models? Well, who's doing the risk testing? How do you stress test the system? And the third is, how do people with different protocols can respond when there's a crisis, that a crisis come along in the sense, what is your liquidity management going to look like if there's an emergency oracle system kind of embedded in the protocols? Well, how does, say, the decentralized governance and the community responds to such thing? I think these are super interesting things for us to learn.
00:21:52.590 - 00:22:14.630, Speaker A: Got it. And Nick, I want to go back to you on this. Crypto markets are going through sort of a stress test right now. A lot of these project projects have not been through a bear market, a crypto winter, if you will. Do you have any sense that there are things other than Luna and USD that won't work based on the downturn in prices in the moment that we're in right now?
00:22:14.782 - 00:22:50.650, Speaker B: I mean, you know, Luna Terra was clearly the largest ticking time bomb, certainly the most fragile project. It was clear that the anchor yields were subsidized. And once that subsidy ended, that's how I thought it would fold up. There would be outflows and redemptions, and they wouldn't be able to stabilize the peg against that backdrop. But you're right. I mean, the whole thing could well have been catalyzed by the fact that Luna was selling off alongside general tightening in risk markets. And this is a new regime we're entering now as an industry.
00:22:50.650 - 00:24:01.006, Speaker B: Crypto has always existed against the backdrop of liquidity and loose financial conditions. And the crypto industry has never seen a recession in the general macro context. So once, now that we have this tightening, which appears to potentially continue for a number of quarters, it will expose a lot of these bad ideas. And that's healthy, right? I don't know if I could identify the next Luna who's out there you're looking for, but, yeah, I mean, fundamentally, if you're an under reserved stablecoin and you are declaring a peg, and it's a function of your credibility and your ability to raise capital to defend that peg, you are pinning a target on your back, and there will always be adversaries there, and you will be challenged by the market. And major central banks have proven that they couldn't defend themselves fully from the market when they declare a peg. And so believing that a crypto startup could do what the central bank of Switzerland was unable to do is just reckless.
00:24:01.150 - 00:24:01.614, Speaker A: What about.
00:24:01.654 - 00:24:02.926, Speaker F: Can I respond to that?
00:24:03.030 - 00:24:04.594, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely, Sam?
00:24:04.934 - 00:24:48.810, Speaker F: Yeah, so I actually agree with a lot of that. So the reason fracs is actually entirely on chain, and so the collateral ratio is dynamically adjusted with an algorithm is, as Nick says, you can't just do a lot of these things and then hope for it to work out for the best. Right. You paint a target on your back. For example, when Fracs adjusts this collateral ratio, the fact that it's entirely on chain allows you to see the actual adoption and confidence of locked liquidity. How much debt is actually denominated in fracs across all lending markets. For example, right now, 11% of the FRac supply is algorithmic.
00:24:48.810 - 00:25:17.996, Speaker F: Right? And if we were not data driven and entirely on chain, for example, you couldn't actually see where things were going. Right? There'd be no actual ability to see how much debt is denominated in Aave for. For lending fracs. There's nine figures of fracs there. There's a lot of borrowed demand that has to actually be bought back. Right. If everyone's trying to redeem that 89% collateral, there's actually debt that has to be repaid.
00:25:17.996 - 00:26:17.056, Speaker F: So that's actual demand. You can actually quantify the actual integrations and the actual confidence and the real usage of the stablecoin, because it's a deterministic and programmatic system. So then you can actually build a data driven algorithmic approach to say, okay, we need 95% hard assets, or we need 89% hard assets, or, here's the computation we did. Actually, you can run it on an l two or push it to l one, and actually have that entire thing be on chain as like an algorithmic CR adjustment. This is actually literally minus the pushing to l one and stuff we do, but we're actually looking to do even that stuff. But we look at all of this stuff programmatically, because we know, as Nick said, you can't just willy nilly this, and then hopefully it actually works. But if you build an entirely on chain stablecoin, you can make a deterministic system that actually works.
00:26:17.056 - 00:26:21.280, Speaker F: In fact, so far it's been a success.
00:26:21.432 - 00:27:00.878, Speaker A: And you mentioned that it's built on chain. I talked to Doquan a couple months ago about this idea, and one of his arguments and points was that it was supposed to be totally divorced from the traditional financial system, so that made it safer. Clearly, there's so much overlap with at least bitcoin and traditional finance and what's going on with the macro picture. Are any of these projects that are supposed to be totally immune from what's going on in traditional markets? Can that ever work? Are there other examples of this? And was that part of the issue, the idea that you thought it was separate, but it really wasn't, and it's tied to all of this macro noise going on? Nick, maybe you take this one.
00:27:00.926 - 00:27:34.370, Speaker B: I'm hopeful, I remain hopeful that we can create truly decentralized, stable coins based on crypto collateral with this algorithmic model. Probably over collateralization is the way to go. But the truth is we're fully indexed to what's happening out there in the world. Even the fiat convertible stable coins. Right. You're sensitive to the treasury market and the liquidity conditions in treasuries. That's something that we don't discuss very much.
00:27:34.370 - 00:27:51.352, Speaker B: I mean, there's even potential liquidity issues with the most robust fiat convertible stable coins. So those are the kind of the gold standard. But even there, there remain risks, especially if liquidity breaks down in the treasury market, which is certainly possible.
00:27:51.528 - 00:27:52.336, Speaker C: Certainly possible.
00:27:52.440 - 00:27:53.256, Speaker A: It'd be interesting to say.
00:27:53.280 - 00:27:54.536, Speaker E: I'm going to respond to that.
00:27:54.600 - 00:27:54.896, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:54.960 - 00:28:35.424, Speaker E: Yeah. So when you're operating at the scale of billions of dollars, there is just not enough in crypto native assets to sort of build up that supply. We know this now. There was some people doing cool experiments, like with Rye. I think it's a worthwhile experiment, but ultimately, I just don't believe it can scale. The only way to do this is to connect into the real world, start bringing on chain sort of the asset market in the real world, which is like, way, way bigger than the crypto market caps, even after this massive growth spurt. So, yeah, I think this is the only way forward.
00:28:35.424 - 00:29:19.694, Speaker E: I think Sam would agree with me. I mean, they're branching out into real world assets. Well, so maker has been heavily focused on this from the start, and this is really the only way to run a decentralized stablecoin at scale. There's just not that many options when you get up there, and it can still be decentralized, in my view. So, like, I think some complaints are that if you're building things out of sort of with counterparties and centralized components, it can't be decentralized. I do not agree with this. I believe we can just get decentralization by heavily diversifying the asset classes and jurisdictions and just get a whole big portfolio of a bunch of things where you protect yourself from individual tail risk.
00:29:19.694 - 00:29:25.002, Speaker E: This is totally achievable in my view. And this has been makers focus from the start.
00:29:25.098 - 00:29:45.144, Speaker A: Yeah. And joao, I wonder on circle side too, to pivot the conversation a little bit, if you want to respond to that. But I also want to get your take on regulation because, because I know circle spends a lot of time in DC. Any sense that regulators are going to see the headlines around Luna and what happened with Terrausd and come down harder than they would have otherwise? Unstable coin regulation?
00:29:45.444 - 00:30:54.320, Speaker C: Yeah, before I get into that, if I can just respond, I don't think it's a counter argument to anything that has been said, but I think sometimes we are getting, especially in the last year or so, we're getting hung up on this idea that, you know, there needs to be a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, but it feels like we're starting from the solution and trying to then find a use case for that. Obviously, bitcoin and all these things are amazing innovations and they have super important use cases. But I think what we are focusing on is can you bring benefit, can you bring better quality attributes for the financial services that people use today? And yes, decentralized algorithm stablecoins, they have very clear principles that theoretically would bring benefits, but for those users. But actually, what happened in the last few weeks, it also costs a tremendous amount for normal people. And we have to be careful. We're trying to do good and that we do this tremendously harm to people. So to me, the perspective that we have instead is let's build very solid substrates, let's build interoperable layers that every financial service, any business can connect to and transform the user experience that users have today.
00:30:54.320 - 00:31:47.886, Speaker C: The fact that they can't move their Robinhood balance easily to revolut in Europe, let's break those barriers like we are in 2022. It's about time for us to do that. So I think focusing on the customer problem and focusing on the benefits that we can actually bring to the population around the world and having this massive substrate that everybody can connect to, I think that's the focus as opposed to is it this solution or that solution or that solution. I actually think there's space for centralized stablecoin, CBDCs, algo, stablecoins, everything. But on the, on the regulation piece, again, as I said, I don't think we have felt the impact at all of this. I think, you know, the information that I have, I think everybody has reading in the news the way that, you know, Janet Yellen made a, made a statement and mentioned UST on her deposition. I think the UK was announcing some changes with regards to how they see stable coins as well.
00:31:47.886 - 00:32:06.326, Speaker C: Well, I honestly think, I want to think that it's going to be positive. I think it's important for us to have regulation right again, what we have seen in the last number of weeks shows that consumer protection is a very important thing for us all to keep in mind. And I hope it's going to end up being positive despite some reaction that we might see.
00:32:06.350 - 00:32:14.492, Speaker A: Because, Christine, let's get your take on this. I also want to talk about central bank digital currencies, but what's your take on regulation and what this means?
00:32:14.678 - 00:33:00.796, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to Jiao's point, definitely, like regulators are getting more into this and spending time to really understand, for example, how these mechanism works and therefore what are the safeguards and rails that they should create. So definitely a very important question, important initiative to do. And, you know, we spend a lot of time talking with regulators, central banks just understanding this space in general. And I want to go back to Zhao's point because I really agree with what he's saying because, you know, whichever stablecoin project we're looking at, you know, we're trying to derive utility, the trust coming, the value coming out of it, and that utility has to come from the use case in itself. And it's also, and it's not just, you know, single leaf for stablecoin alone. I mean, it's the same when we're talking about cbdcs as well. So, you know, in my day to day work, I spend a lot of time talking with central banks.
00:33:00.796 - 00:33:48.162, Speaker D: And in fact, this core aspect of what exactly are these digital currencies going to be used for is so crucial to understand. And we like to refer to the fact that we've been seeing this massive growth in stablecoin over the past few years. Like last year we had, I think, closer to $6 trillion of on chain stablecoin transaction volume. So clearly there's value being made and being moved and the key is to understand who's driving that and what are we building. And one of the key metrics we actually like to track is the size of the developer ecosystem out there in crypto. I think electric capital sort of, you know, did a study that last year, 75% of growth in terms of the number of developers who are like building things on top of these open blockchains. And this is great because these are the people who will be staying in the ecosystem.
00:33:48.162 - 00:34:24.940, Speaker D: Even when there's market downturns or upturns, you know, they'll be here to build. And as they're building, we're seeing this growing ecosystem of say, global fintechs, crypto native companies who are building the product from the ground up using digital currency. And we said, I think previously, money is being programmable. And the fact that everything can be built on smart contracts. And these smart contracts are composable in a way. The beauty of, I guess, geocurrencies like stable coins and CBDC is that in some way you can allow developers to start building things a lot faster. They're lowering that barrier to entry to start creating a business.
00:34:24.940 - 00:34:35.852, Speaker D: And we think if that utility continues to grow and, you know, exponentially growing, then that would be really good. And we're very much leaning into these, all these future, you know, different ways money moves.
00:34:35.868 - 00:34:58.910, Speaker A: So, yeah, really interesting. We have about five minutes left, so I'm going to do sort of a quick around the table here, but I do want to get your take on central bank digital currencies, what that means to the private stable coin market and the potential in that space that maybe we'll start with. Sam, 1 minute on the clock, you go.
00:34:58.942 - 00:35:58.836, Speaker F: Okay, well, one comment from everyone that's already said. So I usually have this saying that's like all roads lead to fracs. But I actually think after this panel it's going to have to be like all roads lead to fracs and maker because of just so much similarities we have going. And the thing that I wanted to actually say here is like we're getting really caught up in like semantic brands over collateralized or like algorithmic and stuff. And it's not just over collateralization as like a concept. I always say, okay, what if maker was forked and there was 1000% over collateralized? Dai, then how come someone doesn't do that, right? It's because if you did that, no one would mint such expensive debt, right? Maker would out compete it, clearly. But everyone would love a 1000% over collateralized stablecoin, right? But what happens is the market evolves to the right risk adjusted ratio of scalable currency, right? And so right now it seems like it's between 89% on chain from what FRac says to 150 or 130 whatever makers.
00:35:58.836 - 00:36:10.532, Speaker F: But I think it'll converge to what the ideal markets, risk adjusted preferences and scalability. So I'm really interested to see how these designs converge and how everyone works together.
00:36:10.668 - 00:36:18.554, Speaker A: All right, we'll go to Sam for a last word. Either CBDCs or if there's something you want to hit that we haven't talked about yet. Floor is yours.
00:36:18.594 - 00:37:01.936, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, CBDCs, I don't have strong opinions about that. Like if it comes on chain, like it could potentially be used as collateral. It's just a risk reward sort of evaluation on our end. So, I mean, I don't have strong opinions on that. I am agreeing with Sam on sort of this, converging about where the most optimal risk tolerances with sort of these stablecoin designs. I think what does set maker apart is our staying on the conservative side just to give people sort of the most dependable, decentralized stablecoin available. And, you know, the beauty of DeFi is that, like, we can have multiple options.
00:37:01.936 - 00:37:08.460, Speaker E: People can choose what they want to use. So I think that's a beautiful thing. And I like the optionality that's there.
00:37:08.632 - 00:37:13.348, Speaker A: Got it. All right, who's next? Katherine? We'll go down the line.
00:37:13.476 - 00:37:55.668, Speaker D: Sure. So actually, so again, I love quoting data, but like this year, so the bank for international settlement, they do these sort of regular surveys. So currently you're looking at nine out of ten different countries are actively doing research and experimenting with central bank euro currency. So clearly there is a momentum from the regulators and the central banks also looking into similar, very similar types of technologies to be. We do think that there's going to be a lot of synergies from what we are learning or what we're seeing already from the growth and the success of stable coins and how we can move that over, we're looking at central bank. In fact, you know, the underlying product infrastructure can support both. And interesting enough, you know, a lot of the central banks these days actually looking at the future of CBDC.
00:37:55.668 - 00:38:30.922, Speaker D: They call it CBDC 2.0, which is how they can interact with the DeFi in the future. So I think these kind of things are very interesting and it's definitely good to have all these sort of synergies being, being built. But I think the key around all of these is going to be around interoperability. Because outside of the crypto and the blockchain ecosystem, we already have real time payments, Ach wire transfers, and now we're going to have new payment rails such as the stablecoin on the blockchain and central bank geocurrency. So to enable all these multi chain, multi hub, all these kind of multidimensional things to interoperate with one another. We have to have solutions that could allow seamless sort of flows to be happening.
00:38:30.922 - 00:38:31.482, Speaker D: So.
00:38:31.618 - 00:38:36.634, Speaker A: Got it. Joao, your thoughts on also what it means for circle, for the private market?
00:38:36.674 - 00:39:27.680, Speaker C: Joel, I'm maybe a little bit less positive on it. I think there is potentially application for CBDCs for increased efficiency of that world within central banks and banks. I do think though, that central banks, they don't come across as the type of or organization that would be capable of operating these mechanisms at scale. I mean, you know, FrAcs, maker circle, it's really complicated to operate an infrastructure like this. And then I think a key piece, which is something that we believe in a lot, which is permissionless, you know, the title of the conference, I mean, we never signed a deal with maker. Right? And Maker utilizes USC as part of what they do. We never sign a deal with Sam and FrACs.
00:39:27.680 - 00:39:51.308, Speaker C: And Fracs utilizes USC. It's composable, it's permissionless. I don't know if CDCs are going to be like that. I suspect there's a huge barrier for that to be the case. And if that's the case, then I think they might play a role more in the back end and for inter bank use cases and other things. But I don't see as something that will get scaled in terms of being a bear instrument that you and I are going to use.
00:39:51.396 - 00:40:02.172, Speaker A: Got it. And we come full circle back to Nick. Last words for the panel, nick, either on CBDCs or just your thoughts on stablecoins as a killer app?
00:40:02.268 - 00:40:19.668, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll be brief. I mean, stablecoins are clearly an incredible consumer product. Everyone loves them. They're the killer app of crypto so far. No question about that. They've also been responsible for great harms. But ultimately, what is it that people desire? What do they want from stablecoins? They want transactional autonomy.
00:40:19.668 - 00:40:45.608, Speaker B: They want, obviously, programmability. They need it to be digital. But you want privacy, you want cash that exists in a digital context. No government is going to give that to us. There's no government that will allow us to digitize physical cash. No CBDC plan is sincere about that. So there's no chance that CBDC recaptures the qualities of physical cash in the digital context in a way that actually gives consumers what they want.
00:40:45.608 - 00:40:50.416, Speaker B: We have to look to the stablecoin sector for that, and I hope that it can achieve that.
00:40:50.600 - 00:41:03.944, Speaker A: All right, perfect. Well, everybody and Sam, remote here. Sam, Sam, Katherine, Joe, Nick, thank you all and thanks, everyone, for tuning in. I know we're live streaming, too, so whoever is watching at home, thank you, guys.
