00:00:00.640 - 00:00:24.274, Speaker A: We are going to talk about so many different things. We have, of course, Kane Warwick from Synthetix. We have Mary Kathryn lauder from Uniswap Labs. And then beamed in here on the left is Donnie from Aave, and then we got Robert Lechner on the right from compound. And these are all projects that have seen some things, and there are a lot of questions that I have for them. And we're going to go through a little bit of all of them. There are many, many things to discuss.
00:00:24.274 - 00:00:58.910, Speaker A: Do we want to emphasize layer twos over multichain layer ones? We're going into a bear market, allegedly. How is that going to impact the trajectory of what we build? What's next for the innovations in Defi? So I think we're going to cover a little bit of all of these things. And I actually don't know where to start first because each one of these protocols, each one of these teams, is probably focused on something unique to them. So, Kane, of all the things that there are things to think about as we go into 2022, to finish off this year into 2023, what is synthetix really optimizing for right now? What are you guys focused on?
00:00:59.102 - 00:01:36.222, Speaker B: I think the main focus for us is still ethereum scaling. So we're on optimism. We've been working on that transition for a long time now, and we've gotten to a point where I think the ecosystem is really starting to get some momentum on optimism. Obviously, the upcoming op token launch is going to help with that as well. For us, it's about still supporting and building out that optimism ecosystem so we can kind of repatriate all of the AlT L one users over the last couple of years that have accumulated and kind of bled out of the Ethereum ecosystem and bring them back to the Ethereum mothership.
00:01:36.398 - 00:01:45.606, Speaker A: Can you talk a little bit about the need for scale at the feed layer and also at the speed layer to create scale with synthetix, the app? Yeah.
00:01:45.630 - 00:02:26.028, Speaker B: So synthetix, I think, has always been a pretty gas intensive protocol. So back even in 2019, when gas prices were a lot lower and the ETH price was lower, people were still complaining all the time about it. So I think that just pushed us very early to start thinking about it as Uniswap did as well with the Unipig demo to really make sure that we were on track to scale. And so even with gas prices lower today than they have been for a little while, I think it's still. You're talking about sub dollar transactions on optimism. So it's much, much better than all. Nail one.
00:02:26.116 - 00:02:31.668, Speaker A: Lovely Mary. Let's turn to Uniswap Labs. What do you guys focus on to close out the year and to get us into 2023?
00:02:31.796 - 00:02:37.956, Speaker C: We're most focused on simplifying the user experience to help drive growth of Defi overall and growth of these protocols overall.
00:02:38.020 - 00:02:40.164, Speaker D: So still today, as everyone here knows.
00:02:40.244 - 00:02:42.260, Speaker C: There'S too many steps to access things.
00:02:42.292 - 00:02:46.254, Speaker D: Like the Uniswap protocol, to access things like synthetics, Aave compound.
00:02:46.374 - 00:02:58.006, Speaker C: And so we're focused on simplifying that so that whether it's retail or in the case of more sophisticated and professional users, it's a much simpler, more streamlined user experience. And people can understand how do they.
00:02:58.030 - 00:03:03.134, Speaker D: Create liquidity pools or add liquidity? How do they make decisions about which.
00:03:03.174 - 00:03:05.630, Speaker C: Chain or layer two they want to trade on?
00:03:05.782 - 00:03:07.894, Speaker D: We're optimistic and excited that a driver.
00:03:07.934 - 00:03:15.896, Speaker C: Of growth in this bear market is going to be capital formation and the growth of more communities and long tail tokens. And so we want to help make.
00:03:15.920 - 00:03:17.856, Speaker D: Sure that there are tools that make.
00:03:17.880 - 00:03:20.584, Speaker C: That accessible and can help drive that as a driver of growth.
00:03:20.704 - 00:03:30.364, Speaker A: Lovely, lovely. All right, let's turn to the people in the heavens. Stani, on my right. Stani, what's ave up to so many different things. What do you guys focus on to close out the year?
00:03:30.744 - 00:03:35.440, Speaker E: First of all, I have to compliment Kane's hair. It looks very nice, very well grown.
00:03:35.512 - 00:03:36.484, Speaker A: Thanks, Danny.
00:03:37.784 - 00:04:53.978, Speaker E: And hi from metaverse. Yeah, so this year for Aave has been very, quite big year, especially because we, a couple of months ago, we launched the Aave version three, and we were focusing quite a lot on the risk mitigation side and capital efficiency. And the idea of the version three was that we kind of started to see decentralized finance grow quite substantially. I personally never kind of, like, believe that we come so fast into having smart, contract based protocols that are holding billions of dollars worth of value, given that the whole space didn't exist just a few years ago. And for us, what we wanted to do is that we wanted to add features that actually decrease the risk. So you can list assets in isolated mode that doesn't affect the other collaterals, but also kind of like, take into consideration that we are in a state of multi chain universe. So there is different kinds, of course, l two s, but l one s that are creating new communities.
00:04:53.978 - 00:06:09.618, Speaker E: And this has been very interesting because many people who have been born and raised on Ethereum, such as, it's been always kind of like a privilege to build here, but also kind of like these new communities, such as like Polygon avalanche, they create new opportunities to builders and community members to participate very early. And of course, like, that's also the challenging part because of our protocol is deployed in multiple networks, and there's the bridging functionality as well as assets are moving from one network to another. But also the layer twos is something where we think there's going to be a lot of work and focus on our side. But more, I would say there's two things after this post b three, launch, we're focusing. One is the governance layer. So we're trying to figure out how we can get more people to vote and care about governance and get create better tools. So this is going to be like one of the main focus points for us, and then a bigger topic for us is the experience layer.
00:06:09.618 - 00:07:06.264, Speaker E: So experience layer essentially means that improving the user experience and being able to kind of like scale Defi to users that are currently out of the ecosystem, because it's relatively challenging to interact with. But also the experience layer means also in a wider aspect, in DeFi, how do you recognize which protocols are actually the ones that are battle tested, which are more experimental? And just focusing on this kind of an aspect that's for us. And of course, at Dawe, we are more of a web three builders. So we build decentralized finance, but we see Webtree as a kind of like a bigger economy. And social is one of the things that we think is going to be a big part of finance as well. So that's kind of our main focus at the moment.
00:07:06.804 - 00:07:18.064, Speaker A: Amazing. And Robert, last but not least, take us home. The man that started off DeFi summer and the yield farming revolution got another ace up your sleeve. Robert, what do you guys focus on to take us home?
00:07:18.764 - 00:08:28.936, Speaker F: Yeah, so the focus for compound is really bringing institutions into DeFi. Historically, almost all the use of DeFi has been individual led, for the most part, people self custodying their own assets, interacting with DeFi protocols directly. Our focus right now is how do we get an entire class of users into the ecosystem? Those who aren't self custodying their own crypto, those who want to access it in different ways, and those who are coming at it from a more institutional investor perspective. And so earlier last year, we launched a product called Compound treasury, which is an institutional on and off ramp to access the compound protocol. We're seeing unbelievable growth in this product, and our focus is really on taking this on an off ramp for institutions and making it as meaningful as possible. So being able to service everything from, you know, investment firms to corporate treasuries to banks, etcetera. As part of this compound, treasury recently received a credit rating from a major global rating agency, which is one of the steps to creating an extremely institutional product.
00:08:28.936 - 00:08:40.284, Speaker F: And so all the things that we're doing are really just focused on enabling institutions with billions of dollars to deploy capital into defi safely and securely.
00:08:40.914 - 00:09:13.502, Speaker A: And so I think the audience here can kind of get a grasp for how varied all these answers are. Robert's focus on institutions, Kane here is focused on building out layer two s and lowering fees. Uniswap Labs, Mary is focused on making uniswap easier for the periphery. And Stani in v three has a whole host of brand new features. So Defi, as always, is growing in very, very many different directions all over the place, which is why Defi is always so bullish. But also, there's just rumors of a bear market coming around. And as we go into a bear market, the prioritization shifts.
00:09:13.502 - 00:09:55.584, Speaker A: Especially when we are in the world of Daos and Dow capital and treasuries that are based on the token itself, the prioritization of resource management, I think it becomes really, really relevant. And we are blessed by having four people here that have been a part of products that came out of a bear market. And so perhaps there are some lessons to be gleaned about building during a bear market and the advantages building during a bear market, but also the strategies to not waste a bunch of money as we go into a bear market. So, Kane, I'll throw this again to you. Has the prioritization, or just like thoughts of the synthetic strategy changed over the last three months as all of our portfolios have gotten burned?
00:09:56.924 - 00:10:47.188, Speaker B: Look, we've, I think, like most of the OG DeFi projects, been fairly careful about treasury management and tried to ensure that we didn't get into a position of any kind of stress in terms of Runway or whatever. I think most of us learned that in 2018 that it can always get much worse than you expected. And so we've really prepared for worst case scenario. But I think for me, if we do get into a bear market, the exciting thing is it's actually a time for you to be able to catch up. So in a bull market, there's this abundance of capital. Everyone's doing so many different things that it's impossible for you to even keep track. You're just trying to do your own thing and kind of maintain some sense of order in all of the chaos.
00:10:47.188 - 00:11:17.976, Speaker B: But there's all of this really cool experimentation going on. And in a bear market, you can actually stop because things slow down and you can be like, oh, wait, I didn't know about this thing, or I didn't know about that thing. And you can start to take these different components of things that people have built and put them together. And that's where I think you see some of the amazing composability and innovation really flourish. And I think that's what will then catalyze the next run out of there when people start making some really cool stuff out of a lot of the infrastructure that's been built in the last 18 months.
00:11:18.080 - 00:11:42.828, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly things that definitely get adopted during bear markets have a fantastic time during bull markets. And I think that is the story of uniswap as well. So, Mary, maybe you could just give us some perspectives and give us some hope for people who are perhaps a little bit down in the dumps about bear markets. Maybe this is their first one. I think this is a lot of people's first bear market, but Uniswap came out of, with shining colors out of the first bear market. So do you have any perspectives that you could share about that?
00:11:42.956 - 00:11:44.300, Speaker D: Yeah, I have two thoughts on this.
00:11:44.332 - 00:11:47.500, Speaker C: Bear market, but one just to reference what you said exactly.
00:11:47.532 - 00:11:48.988, Speaker D: Each of the protocols represent on this.
00:11:48.996 - 00:11:57.154, Speaker C: Page panel was created in the glass bear market. And as you suggested, Uniswap was founded by Hayden Adams, backed by an Ethereum foundation grant.
00:11:57.274 - 00:11:58.202, Speaker D: And that was in the wake of.
00:11:58.218 - 00:12:02.722, Speaker C: So many icos that had raised so much capital so quickly and so much hype. And I think part of what made.
00:12:02.738 - 00:12:04.650, Speaker D: It successful at the outset was that.
00:12:04.682 - 00:12:06.234, Speaker C: Authenticity and the fact that it was.
00:12:06.274 - 00:12:13.578, Speaker D: A project really trying to solve a problem or create bootstrap liquidity. So I think that what's one of.
00:12:13.586 - 00:12:16.772, Speaker C: The benefits of a bear market is that other sources of validation go away.
00:12:16.938 - 00:12:18.520, Speaker D: And so all you really have is.
00:12:18.552 - 00:12:22.324, Speaker C: Whether what you're building is going to work and whether people are going to use it.
00:12:22.704 - 00:12:28.792, Speaker D: And so one thing I would say that we think a lot about is, especially in a decentralized ecosystem, those are.
00:12:28.808 - 00:12:31.816, Speaker C: Composed of different teams. And so you have to really think.
00:12:31.840 - 00:12:36.280, Speaker D: About what is your team best equipped to do, uniquely equipped to drive adoption of.
00:12:36.312 - 00:12:38.640, Speaker C: So perhaps, in Robert's case, his team.
00:12:38.672 - 00:12:43.000, Speaker D: Is best equipped to explain compound treasury to institutions, to drive that adoption much.
00:12:43.032 - 00:12:48.592, Speaker C: More than anyone else who might control contribute to compound. In our case, at Uniswap Labs, we.
00:12:48.608 - 00:12:50.008, Speaker D: Are building products on top of the.
00:12:50.016 - 00:12:57.824, Speaker C: Uniswap protocol, and the token holders drive adoption of scaling solutions like layer twos.
00:12:57.864 - 00:12:59.112, Speaker D: Or deployment to other chains.
00:12:59.208 - 00:13:03.296, Speaker C: What we can focus on is simplifying the user experience. And so I think being very crisp.
00:13:03.320 - 00:13:06.504, Speaker D: And focused on what your team and the resources that you have can best.
00:13:06.544 - 00:13:11.666, Speaker C: Accomplish is important to help drive the success of an overall more decentralized ecosystem.
00:13:11.770 - 00:13:23.614, Speaker A: Certainly. Stanley, let's go back to you, Ave. I've always considered to be a bear market darling. It was one of my favorite apps during the last bear market. Any thoughts or lessons or perspectives as we perhaps go into the next one?
00:13:24.594 - 00:14:16.812, Speaker E: Yeah, I think bear market different. I mean, I guess we can call it bear market now, right? So that's the elephant in the room. So I think what good about it is that you know it really well. Let's start with bull market. I think in bull market, you know, it really tests your focus out as a builder, for example, that there's a lot of things that are taking off, there's a lot of exciting ideas, innovation, but also see kind of like a different themes, also a bit like expanding their focus a bit. I think kind of like doing more than you are doing now. In terms of building in web three is important, but you always have to have adhesives.
00:14:16.812 - 00:15:20.880, Speaker E: So, for example, our goal at Aave is that we want to build the web three infrastructure and get more people empowered by the blockchain technology. That's what we're focusing upon. So just to give an example, we've been building decentralized finance over the past years, and now we're doing also building web three social and doing different kinds of experimentations as well with our experimentation pod nude. And I just think that as long as you have a very strong thesis on what you are, what do you want to do as a team and as your organization, that's the key thing. Then you don't kind of lose focus if you are on your mission. And I think at Avel, our actual product is the organization. So the things that we can actually, we have a strong team that we can build different things that we think that are going to increase the adoption for web three technology.
00:15:20.880 - 00:16:17.930, Speaker E: And that's kind of our piece is admission, and I think it's kind of like very important to try different things, but you're always limited with resources, and that's where the bear market kind of like shows that. So, but as long as you are focused, you know, you can build many things at the same time on bear market as well. And I think, like, regarding maybe fundraising, I think, like raising funds, like, bull markets are good to raise funds to then use on bear markets. I personally love bear markets because it reduces the noise. So like Kane said, that there's so much things happening, it just like barely can catch up with everything. But during bear market, you can actually spend some time reading more and more white papers and understanding new tech that is being built by our builders. So I think this is a great time.
00:16:17.930 - 00:16:19.534, Speaker E: We should celebrate bear markets.
00:16:19.994 - 00:16:42.284, Speaker A: Robert, of course I want your perspectives as well, but the next thread I want to pull on is what are the use cases that it's going to really take to catalyst bring us into the next bull market? And I'm going to make this joke twice because I think it's funny. As the man who killed the last bear market, how are you guys thinking about the bear market? But also what are the use cases that you think are going to help us get out of this thing?
00:16:45.464 - 00:17:36.944, Speaker F: Yeah. So in order to get out of a bear market, it really just requires the excitement and enthusiasm of all of the different participants. That really comes from capital, but really it comes from people just getting excited again. And that's often happening in different areas sometimes, and each time from something new. So in 2020, that was from this new concept of giving the governance of a protocol that does something important and valuable directly to the users compound. Did it? Uniswap, did it? That was unbelievably exciting, and that drove a lot of energy and attention into the space and defi, in a lot of ways, ended the last bear market. One of the things that we've seen since then is that a lot of that excitement has actually shifted to things like nfts, and it's still not really, in a lot of ways, bear market for nfts.
00:17:36.944 - 00:18:15.662, Speaker F: And I think when I look at Bull and bear, it's sometimes very verticalized. I think that the next bull market might come from something that we don't even anticipate. It might come from native crypto currencies. Again, maybe bitcoin leads the way. It's possible that it comes from much wider societal excitement around gamefi, which is still extremely early. I think the thing that kicks off the next bull market is going to come from a new idea just generating a huge amount of excitement. And I don't know if it's going to be anything that we've seen previously.
00:18:15.662 - 00:18:30.390, Speaker F: One of the things that is a fact is that every single bull market comes from somewhere new that we haven't really expected. So I think the bull market will come and I don't know what's going to kick it off, but most of us will be participating in some way.
00:18:30.542 - 00:19:18.828, Speaker A: Amazing. This next question, Mary, I want to start with you. Daos are still new. While human organization is not the form of the DAO, the form factor of the DAO is new. So I'm wondering, is there any, just like, as we go into and try and be efficient with our resources and really just like, become optimized with our DaO governance structures, are there any aspects of the Uniswap Dao or Uniswap labs where, like the resources of the Dow are not fully tapped in, where there's latent potential here and we haven't pulled that potential out because bear markets, sorry to keep on using the bear market word, guys, but I'm going to keep on doing it. Bear markets are a great time to tap into latent potential and latent energy. What do you see in the Uniswap Dao, but also in the greater Dao space, as latent potential to pull out, as we try and maximize our resources?
00:19:18.996 - 00:19:20.500, Speaker C: It's a great question because I think.
00:19:20.532 - 00:19:27.256, Speaker D: That there have been a few examples of types of proposals that communities have gotten comfortable with.
00:19:27.360 - 00:19:27.600, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:27.632 - 00:19:29.104, Speaker D: So in the lending protocols, those are very clear.
00:19:29.144 - 00:19:30.416, Speaker C: In the case of Uniswap, a new.
00:19:30.440 - 00:19:36.544, Speaker D: Fee tier, deployment of a new governance contract, deployment to new chains, those kind of muscles have been built.
00:19:36.664 - 00:19:38.664, Speaker C: But to your point, the sort of.
00:19:38.824 - 00:19:41.344, Speaker D: Exercise of using Dell funds to drive.
00:19:41.384 - 00:19:46.464, Speaker C: Growth maybe has not been developed as clearly beyond the initial use case of liquidity mining.
00:19:46.584 - 00:19:52.834, Speaker D: And so I think it's an interesting time for members of the Uniswap community to think about how they can participate.
00:19:53.854 - 00:19:55.502, Speaker C: To drive growth and success and the.
00:19:55.518 - 00:19:59.254, Speaker D: Resilience of the protocol, whether that means its development by many other teams beyond.
00:19:59.294 - 00:20:00.638, Speaker C: The team, Uniswap Labs, which is one.
00:20:00.646 - 00:20:05.902, Speaker D: Of the contributors to the protocol, or whether that's deployment to other chains and other drivers of growth.
00:20:05.958 - 00:20:20.494, Speaker C: So just to level set. So Uniswap Labs is a corporation. We're a team that is one of the core contributors to the protocol. But all the use of the treasury management, all DAO activity is driven by token holders.
00:20:21.194 - 00:20:22.986, Speaker D: Robert Leshner is a major delegate.
00:20:23.090 - 00:20:30.770, Speaker C: Many other people here are as well. So deployment to polygon, deployment to arbitrum, deployment to celo, like these were all.
00:20:30.802 - 00:20:36.082, Speaker D: Driven by the community. Those are great examples of drivers of growth. And so as we think about how.
00:20:36.098 - 00:20:41.682, Speaker C: To drive new use cases and basically just make sure that web three infrastructure is readily available, that DeFi as infrastructure.
00:20:41.698 - 00:20:43.306, Speaker D: Is readily available to enable those use.
00:20:43.330 - 00:20:47.736, Speaker C: Cases if we don't know what they are then that's a great opportunity for.
00:20:47.760 - 00:20:49.856, Speaker D: Participants in these communities to really help.
00:20:49.880 - 00:20:51.004, Speaker C: Drive the next phase.
00:20:51.424 - 00:21:09.084, Speaker A: Kane, I'd like to throw that same question to you, because as we said, there is a ton of latent energy in layer two s. Synthetix specifically gets a lot of that tailwind from the cheaper fees on layer two s. So what kind of latent potential is there in this synthetix dao, and how do we tap into that?
00:21:09.464 - 00:21:46.954, Speaker B: I think the interesting thing is we've actually been in an ethnic Defi bear market. Degen spartan kind of started this off. Unfortunately, I think we're in month 18 or something like that of the Defi bear market. And I think a big part of that was coming out of Defi Summer. We had so much activity on l one fees were so expensive, we really priced out a lot of new entrants. And all of the people who came in and were not able to access l one because of high gas fees went somewhere else. Some went to Polygon, some went to Solana, some went to Avalanche, some went to BSc.
00:21:46.954 - 00:22:41.542, Speaker B: There are different places that people ended up. But I think we really missed out the 8th DeFi. The OG protocols missed out on a lot of that user growth over the last twelve to 18 months. And so I do think that now, as we've finally gotten scaling to a point where it's production ready, that we will have this kind of resurgence where people who maybe haven't used compound or Aave, I think most people have used uniswap, even on l one. But I think that there's a lot of protocols where people just haven't really had a chance to use them because they were priced out. Unless it was deployed to polygon or something like that, they may not have ever interacted with it. So I think we will have this scenario where people start testing out l two s, they try arbitrum, they try optimism, and they realize that cheap fees, you get all of the benefits of the ethereum ecosystem.
00:22:41.542 - 00:22:46.114, Speaker B: And that to me is probably going to be the catalyst for a resurgence of eat DeFi.
00:22:46.934 - 00:23:09.294, Speaker A: One thought that I have is that we never really seem to have the same bull market twice. It always seems to be a new thing that catalyzes the next bull market. And as the, the energy left the defi ecosystem and went into the NFT ecosystem and hasn't seemed to leave since. Do you think Defi can take back the center stage from the NFT world?
00:23:09.914 - 00:23:54.390, Speaker B: I've said this a few times before. Defi is very important and powerful, but not that interesting. There's not that many people who care deeply about finance. I think when you look at NFTs and you look at culture and gaming and all of that sort of stuff, it's much more interesting. People are much more interested in movies and music and things than they are in weird mechanism design and financial engineering. But financial engineering and DeFi is very powerful. So I think if we get to a point where we're actually delivering on the promise of some of these protocols, and we are onboarding new users, new entrants in new categories, institutional capital, et cetera, I think that that will drive a lot of growth, even if it doesn't necessarily drive as much attention.
00:23:54.390 - 00:24:04.518, Speaker B: So I think NFTs will bring a lot of attention to the ecosystem, and then people will start to use defi just because it's there. They've got a wallet already. They've been onboarded. They're kind of crypto native at that point.
00:24:04.646 - 00:24:35.242, Speaker A: And certainly when I say the word NFTs, people think jpegs, they think art. But there's also just like the ERC 721 token standard, which there's actually no reason why. Why that can't really be considered DeFi, too. And so, Mary, I'll throw this question back to you, and then I'll bring Stani and Robert into this conversation. But is there a world where DeFi gets aided by the ERC 721 standard? And it's not a cryptopunk, it's not a Fidenza, it's not a bored ape, but we actually lean into the financial capabilities of a new token standard.
00:24:35.418 - 00:24:37.498, Speaker C: Yeah, you could totally think about applications.
00:24:37.546 - 00:24:40.530, Speaker D: For 721s in finance or DeFi, whether.
00:24:40.562 - 00:24:43.668, Speaker C: That'S like insurance contracts or certain kinds of derivatives contracts.
00:24:43.756 - 00:24:46.156, Speaker D: I think that bringing on big institutional.
00:24:46.180 - 00:24:51.708, Speaker C: Pools of capital will be a great testament to which format actually is the best for a certain financial use case.
00:24:51.836 - 00:24:58.372, Speaker D: So I am optimistic and excited about that. It's not something we're actively working on, but it's something that I hope to see a lot more examples of.
00:24:58.468 - 00:25:00.260, Speaker C: And also agree that basically just bridging.
00:25:00.292 - 00:25:05.692, Speaker D: The world between ERC 20 and 721, it's going to be important for the.
00:25:05.708 - 00:25:10.136, Speaker C: Continued growth of, of DeFi, whether that means in a community context, for existing.
00:25:10.160 - 00:25:13.604, Speaker D: NFT communities, or for more like pure financial use cases.
00:25:14.384 - 00:25:21.484, Speaker A: Sonia, I'd like to throw that same question to you. Where is the world of the ERC 721 in defi? Is there a bright future ahead?
00:25:22.504 - 00:26:30.254, Speaker E: Yeah, I think there's a lot of value in non fungibility, and I mean, just to take a look into uniswap, you know, the, the positions are tokenized as ERC 71. So essentially you already kind of have this financialization of nfts and those kind of use cases. But when we look at kind of like a more traditional economy, there is a lot of assets that are actually non fungible, that can be properties, other kind of real world assets. I think it's just a matter of time as this space starts to grow. And I think the real world asset concept, there's already market that we have with centrifuge, where these nfts that are representing real world assets are tokenized as nfts and packaged into a more pooled model. And that market is already live very small, though, compared to be to the whole rest of the decentralized finance. So definitely I think that will happen.
00:26:30.254 - 00:27:17.574, Speaker E: And we're very early in terms of the whole kind of like use cases where we can use ERC 71 standard, because that can be also a way to trade yield in the future and various use cases. And in fact, at Aave, we're building a small PoC of using nfts as a collateral, just as an experimentation to see how it works in terms of the implementation we have in mind. And there's plenty of protocols out there that offer similar functionality where you can unlock liquidity out of your NFT, but on the long term, I think there's a lot of value and that market can become even bigger than the fungible market.
00:27:18.434 - 00:27:48.584, Speaker A: Robert, the gist I'm seeming to get is that the ERC 721 standard seems to go into the real world asset financial contracts bucket, which makes sense to me, but also that really seems to lean into the whole institutional side of the world, as in, those are the players that will probably be creating these things, those are the players that will be leveraging these things. So when we talk about the onboarding of the institutions and getting all of their capital into our world, what role do you see the ERC 721 playing?
00:27:49.804 - 00:28:33.140, Speaker F: Well, I will preface by saying it's unbelievably early, and in a lot of ways, it's just one new format for data, just like in any contrasting formats, JPEGs or GIFS, mP3 s or WAVs. I mean, it's just a different format. And so I think it's going to be another opportunity to represent assets, represent wealth. I mean, Stani touched on this before. It's a better way to represent things like real estate. It's a better way to represent things like unique contracts and those are asset classes that lean more institutional than retail. But I don't necessarily think that ERC 20 versus 721 is going to be the difference between allowing institutions in or allowing retail in.
00:28:33.140 - 00:29:18.554, Speaker F: I think that difference is based on the tools available to them to interact with these ecosystems. And these token formats are different ways to represent value. And those tokens can be traded, borrowed, sliced and diced, programmed in any imaginable way. I think that the biggest game changer for whether or not new types of users are going to come into the ecosystem is will the ecosystem have what excites them? For retail, that's art. And being able to speculate on, you know, pictures of monkeys, and that's super fun, right? For institutions, it's probably not speculating on pictures of monkeys. It's probably something radically different. So the real question is what excites them and how is that going to come onto the blockchain?
00:29:19.454 - 00:29:56.864, Speaker A: So I'm going to. Sorry I have to do this, but this is going to be the less fun part of the conversation. But regulation, we just saw $40 billion get destroyed last week, and now the regulators are probably paying a lot more attention, even though they already probably were. And so I think every single organization, whether it be a company or a DAO or something, needs to have the regulatory conversation internally, but then also externally as well. So, Robert, I'll throw this one back to you. What is the regulation zeitgeist compound? How are you guys approaching this? What are you guys preparing for? Should we be scared? Question mark.
00:29:59.344 - 00:30:47.154, Speaker F: Understand is that fundamentally, DeFi has a lot of advantages that regulators should and are extremely excited about. So DeFi is radically transparent, it's radically fair, it's autonomous, it's open source, so anyone can see how it works, and it operates. 24 seconds. These are all things that are extremely good because they reduce the opportunity for fraud and for mistakes. Now, the contrast of this is that there's still a lot of fraud and mistakes, and these are the things that regulators get concerned about. And this is also because a lot of things are trying to jump into the Defi umbrella. And so there's a lot to be excited about, and there's a lot that makes them nervous.
00:30:47.154 - 00:32:11.548, Speaker F: And when they see things like $40 billion of value getting vaporized in an extremely short amount of time, you have to ask why. And obviously, Terra and Luna and UST are their own ecosystem and very different from what's happening here. But it's a massive alarm bell that's been run. And so I think a lot of the nuance is going to get lost. I think the positive virtues of DeFi are going to get ignored temporarily for the risks of the ecosystem of just smart contracts being able to be created by anybody that can move, manage, and transfer tens of billions of dollars of value permissionlessly. That's scary, right? And so I think the next two years are going to be focused on trying to differentiate the good actors from the bad on the part of regulators, because there's a lot of bad acting in the based on. And it presents an opportunity to start to differentiate folks that are trying to take the really strong positive virtues of Defi and build a solid financial system, and those who are looking to build systems that benefit themselves and obfuscate what's happening under the umbrella of Defi, I think it's going to be rougher waters ahead for a lot of projects.
00:32:11.548 - 00:32:23.264, Speaker F: You know, the projects that are extremely well intentioned are going to be well served. But I think if I were a bad actor in the space right now, I'd be a lot more concerned than I was a few weeks ago.
00:32:23.724 - 00:33:20.826, Speaker A: Robert, there's the conversation of, well, clearly regulators should like this. It gives them all of the data that they need to do good regulation, and they should enjoy that. But then there's the other side of the equation, where regulators first have to care, and they have to actually care about these nuances. And I'm worried that people viewing this industry externally will see, like, internally in this industry, I think a lot of people were divided on Terra. Some were like, this is a great experiment, and others were like, this is doomed to fail. But looking externally, Terra and crypto might as well be synonymous to people that don't care about nuance. So do you have any perspectives as to any conversations that you have on the regulation side about how much they care about these nuances? Do they just want to stamp this industry out, or do they actually want to be more nuanced about this? I'm sure just like I claimed that they painted DeFi with a broad brush, I might also be painting regulators with a broad brush.
00:33:20.826 - 00:33:23.254, Speaker A: But just any nuance or perspective there?
00:33:23.714 - 00:33:54.940, Speaker F: Well, it's a matter of education. So as people learn about these systems and they learn how they work in general, they get more excited and more embracing. But it's a fact that almost everyone is starting from a position of zero. A couple years ago, no politician knew what DeFi was. A couple of years ago, very few even knew what crypto was. And as a society, we become more experienced with these things. The embrace of it grows it's just we're at a point now where at the education level is still very low.
00:33:54.940 - 00:34:38.954, Speaker F: And so there's a lot of work being done right now to increase the education amongst politicians, regulators, all of the external stakeholders. And oftentimes it's being met with a lot of excitement, more so than expected, but it's a huge issue. So I think one of the things that's going to happen is we are going to see more and more familiarity with it. A great example is just even today, most mainstream media calls everything a cryptocurrency. Even though very few things in our space are trying to be currencies, it's just a function of education. I think regulators are becoming more in tune and that's a good thing. And they're going to be able to be more sophisticated about what they look for, what they try to stop, and what they try to encourage.
00:34:39.614 - 00:35:04.764, Speaker A: I actually want to throw this to kane as well, because there is an outsized population of builders from Australia that is well in the crypto industry, but also here at permissionless shout out, the team from Maple and also Tracerdao Australia seems to have a lot of builders and that regulatory environment is different over there. And so trying to get out of the US frame of mind, how is the regulation and just the approach and relationship with regulators different in Australia?
00:35:06.264 - 00:36:14.852, Speaker B: I mean, it's maybe a little bit less adversarial. I think certainly the Gensler Sec I think, has been a little bit more adversarial than most of us would have hoped. But in Australia, I think the approach has been to kind of take hands off unless there's something that's like outright fraud or very clearly a bad actor or something like that. They basically said, let this play out. But I actually was in a meeting, I went and met with our treasury, and they're actually pretty well educated on a lot of these things. They do have some awareness of the nuance, obviously not as deep as probably a lot of people in this room, but they are making an effort, they're going through this consultation process to understand how do daos fit into like a traditional corporate structure, how are we going to manage this stuff? So I do think that there are jurisdictions that are trying to be a bit more proactive and work out how we're going to manage this, because daos aren't going away. Daos are going to become even more powerful over the next five to ten years.
00:36:14.852 - 00:36:23.614, Speaker B: So all of the jurisdictions and all the regulators around the world are going to need to get their hands, heads around. How do we incorporate this into, on the existing frameworks that we have?
00:36:23.774 - 00:36:31.878, Speaker A: Do you think, how much of a boon to innovation do you think Australia is going to get as a result of just the more friendly regulatory environment?
00:36:32.046 - 00:37:12.008, Speaker B: I mean, it's definitely helping. Right now there's an opportunity, and I think that the opportunity is still kind of, it's unclear whether or not they're going to take it. Right. Because right now just being hands off is not enough. I think the next step is to, to say, okay, we're going to take a very clear approach and set some very clear boundaries, give some guidance, because all of us are still waiting for guidance from anyone to come out and say, this is how we want to approach this. I think it's better to wait for a point where they can say, ok, this is what we want to do. And so this consultation process that they're going through now is trying to just gather as much information as possible.
00:37:12.008 - 00:37:33.414, Speaker B: But I think that there's a lot of opportunity for, you know, many different jurisdictions to kind of adopt crypto and come up with some very clear rules and guidance that will allow people to operate and have a sense of what they can and can't do and provide some certainty, because when you're operating under uncertain conditions, it's just not ideal, obviously.
00:37:33.494 - 00:37:39.314, Speaker A: Certainly, Mary, before I throw it to Stani to take us home, what are the conversations at uniswap labs with regulation?
00:37:39.694 - 00:37:44.496, Speaker C: I agree with so much of what's been said already, but I guess what I'll say is that, look, as a.
00:37:44.560 - 00:37:50.448, Speaker D: Good actor, and these are all the good actors on the stage, you can be proactive. And so we're trying to be proactive.
00:37:50.496 - 00:37:52.800, Speaker C: In illustrating how the benefits of Defi.
00:37:52.832 - 00:37:54.800, Speaker D: That Robert mentioned, how they can lead.
00:37:54.832 - 00:38:01.576, Speaker C: To better protections and the delivery of the mission that regulators care about. So if a regulator is concerned about.
00:38:01.600 - 00:38:08.480, Speaker D: Investor protection, how can you have more transparent disclosure? If a regulator is concerned about market manipulation, how can you think about things.
00:38:08.512 - 00:38:11.184, Speaker C: Like flashbots or other sort of ways.
00:38:11.224 - 00:38:15.744, Speaker D: To address potential advantages that exist in defiant crypto markets?
00:38:15.824 - 00:38:23.048, Speaker C: So this is an opportunity to, one, be educating regulators. We just hired a head of policy and have a presence now in DC.
00:38:23.096 - 00:38:24.800, Speaker D: To help do that, to help explain.
00:38:24.832 - 00:38:26.696, Speaker C: The benefits of DeFi, explain how and.
00:38:26.720 - 00:38:28.912, Speaker D: Why, for example, automated market making or.
00:38:28.928 - 00:38:35.754, Speaker C: Decentralized market infrastructure is positive, is enabling, is inherently progressive, but also to think.
00:38:35.794 - 00:38:38.626, Speaker D: About technology driven solutions to the risks.
00:38:38.650 - 00:38:40.194, Speaker C: That regulators might be care, might care.
00:38:40.234 - 00:38:43.734, Speaker D: About, and to start building those things now and not wait to be told.
00:38:44.674 - 00:39:28.954, Speaker A: Guys, thank you so much for coming to this panel. The one last question I have, and I'll lead into it a little bit, is that DeFi summer 2020 and DeFi at large, it's really built on this topic of composability. And as Robert said, the next thing that catalyzes the next bull market, we're not going to see it coming, but it's going to be great by definition because it causes a bull market. And so I think something that is on the horizon is something in the world of social media and also on chain social media, which all of a sudden produces surface area for stuff. And I think you can see Stani just changed the background of his zoom to a lens. Stani, while this panel was going on, a big announcement happened about 18 minutes ago. Can you give us the announcement?
00:39:30.424 - 00:40:13.802, Speaker E: Sure. So recently we launched actually exactly 18 minutes ago. The lens protocol, which is web three social, essentially you can create profile on chain and have your follower relationships on chain, essentially where you own the content. So Linux protocol has been something that we have been building past year at Aave and now finally we got it into Mainnet. And the idea is that we believe that the ownership of content and your profiles and communications should belong to you the same way as any assets. And accessibility to DeFi belongs to you as well. It's an interesting project.
00:40:13.802 - 00:40:33.980, Speaker E: Some of you might sign the open letter, meaning that you vote for the future of social to change and you can claim your lens handle, which hopefully is very rare for you. Yeah. Thank you so much. And it was an amazing panel from my side panelists.
00:40:34.012 - 00:40:38.844, Speaker A: Thank you so much. And here's to another great bear market of building or bull market, who knows?
