00:00:00.280 - 00:00:27.336, Speaker A: If you were a trader and you were saying, I'm not going to trade here at all, and I'm only going to trade here, you will get worse execution on average if you are not factoring this in as, like, one of your venues that you want to access. Now, if you're the type of trader that's like, I sit on Bybit and I don't touch anything else, all my assets are there. Okay, cool. We're coming for you, too. We're going to bring you across and say, don't be on Bybit for all of these reasons, and we're going to give you better execution, lower fees, etcetera. Alright, everyone.
00:00:27.400 - 00:00:57.560, Speaker B: So on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We posted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20. We'll see you in London. This episode is brought to you by Toku, the first comprehensive global solution for both token compensation and tax compliance.
00:00:57.560 - 00:01:25.964, Speaker B: Toku makes implementation implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched legal and tax support to both grant and administer your global team's tokens across the entire token lifecycle. Make your token grants easy today with Token. All right, everyone, we've got the benevolent dictator himself, Mister Kane, Warwick Kane. Welcome back on the show, man.
00:01:26.354 - 00:01:28.574, Speaker A: Hey, what's happening, guys? What's up?
00:01:29.554 - 00:01:39.082, Speaker B: So I was trying to wrap my head around everything that you're doing with synthetix and Infinix. You've got all these experiments going on. Deploy to base. Deploy to optimism.
00:01:39.258 - 00:01:39.674, Speaker A: Deploy.
00:01:39.714 - 00:02:04.904, Speaker B: Korina to ethereum. Andromeda to ethereum. SNX chain on the op stack. And the way I could best maybe summarize it is you spend five years working on the supply side with synthetix. Now you need to solve the demand side with Infinix. And I'd be, I think just the best starting place for this episode is maybe get us up to this point of, like, how. How do you see synthetix going into 2024? And then that can pivot us into this.
00:02:04.904 - 00:02:08.444, Speaker B: This Infinix conversation, right?
00:02:09.544 - 00:02:14.000, Speaker A: Yeah. I was like, how many, how many podcasts do we have here? Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
00:02:14.032 - 00:02:18.192, Speaker B: Dex was like, you might only have an hour. And I was like, I'm not sure about that one.
00:02:18.368 - 00:03:09.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I know, right? Let's see. Let's see how we go. So, look, I think the situation in synthetix today is we have product market fit in a single product in a way that we've probably never had before, like, actual longevity of product market fit. The thing's actually been working for a while, and we've tweaked it and improved it, and it stayed working, and the markets changed. It stayed working. And so I think that, like, this is something that is fairly novel in synthetix. You know, we've had, like, atomic swaps and, like, spot trading and, like, you know, various things that, like, kind of worked for a while, and then, you know, the market moves or something shifts, and it doesn't work any longer.
00:03:09.804 - 00:03:49.074, Speaker A: I think, obviously, a big test of this is gonna be the upgrade and launch of perps v three, this. This new perps upgrade. And I guess, you know, one thing that's kind of cool about it is it's, like, not actually that big of an upgrade. It's, like, four minor improvements in, like, multiple directions. But it's not like, all right, everyone, we got to totally change the entire model and, like, rip everything out and, like, reconfigure it because nothing's working. It's like, it's directionally working. It's been working for a while.
00:03:49.074 - 00:04:32.344, Speaker A: It's consistently gaining momentum. So now, how do we sort of tweak this? And then obviously, it's synthetic, so we have to make it harder by picking a new network to deploy on and a bunch of other stuff. But in principle, it's the same thing. And so that's kind of setting the scene, I guess, for where synthetics is at now. In the end of 2023, going into 2024, it's like, we've got a system that's working. We are going to deploy this new upgrade that just improves a bunch of things, and then we're going to run some additional experiments in parallel to that. And one of them is the collateral question, which is a huge question.
00:04:32.344 - 00:04:42.062, Speaker A: Santiago, you've heard this debate for many years, right? About, like, is SNX good collateral?
00:04:42.238 - 00:05:04.914, Speaker C: I was going to say, you know, it comes up time and time again. You know, it resurfaced during the Luna FTX debacle, right? Everyone's like, well, how is synthetix any different? You know, it's being collateral. And, you know, maybe, I don't know if this is a good moment to do it, because I think it would be actually super helpful for people to appreciate how synthetix has managed to survive all these years and thrive.
00:05:07.154 - 00:06:39.982, Speaker A: Yeah, what's the difference between, what's the difference between Luna and synthetix? There's a couple of differences, yes. They were both systems that are collateralized by their own native token, which is worthless if the network doesn't work. That's the fundamental concern that I think every mid curve to maybe if you're generous, right, curve person that's had about this, right? You know, and like, it's like, yes, if the network fails, then it's worthless. Just like definitionally it has to be, right? The thing has value, the token has value because the network's working. If the network stops working, it has no value and the whole thing collapses, right? So when people are like, can it collapse? It's like everything can collapse by that criteria, right? Like if the criteria is like, if the thing stops working, does it stop working? Then yes, of course, right? It stops working. And so, you know, the question is like, what are the ways by which you can stop working? That's, that's the big thing, right? And I think the difference between Luna and how Luna scaled up with this, like, Ponzi interest rate is if the interest rate even, like, I mean, there's some real world macro parallels over the last 18 months, right? But the interest rate even looks like changing. Does everyone instantly flee? And the answer in the case of Luna is like, yes, there were a couple of gestures of maybe we need to lower the interest rate.
00:06:39.982 - 00:07:25.754, Speaker A: And it just creates this rush out the door where it's like, whoa, I'm not going to get 20%. Well, then this is not worth the risk because the risk is ruin. And so then it's like, well, maybe we'll lower, it's like 18% or 16 or something like that. And everyone's like, this is, we see the direction this is going, right? And you know, it's a game of musical chairs, and all of a sudden the music, like, you know, they turn the volume down like by ten decibels and everyone's like out of the room, right? Like it's just like fleeing. And so when you look at synthetix, you're like, okay, cool. So what is the mechanism by which that can happen? You know, and the mechanism by which it happens is fees stop being generated. If there's no more fees, then the token's worthless if the fees go to zero.
00:07:25.754 - 00:07:59.376, Speaker A: But it's not reflexive. In the same way, the token price going down doesn't impact the fees, and fees going up doesn't necessarily impact the token price. They're related, but they're not so tightly coupled. The reason why synthetix has survived is it's had fairly conservative parameters. You can only borrow so much. You have to have this, like, five times collateral ratio back in the network, and it's consistently produced revenue for a really long time. And that's it.
00:07:59.376 - 00:08:12.684, Speaker A: That's the secret sauce. The thing that stops it from collapsing has been consistent. And so when someone's like, but what if everyone stops trading? And it's like, well, if everyone stops trading, then it's worthless and you should shut it down and move on and do something else, like, obviously.
00:08:13.044 - 00:08:24.064, Speaker C: Right. And I get, I guess, to add a little bit more context to that in the case. Now, as we know, chai was an absolute wash. I mean, it was, it was fake numbers and it was not even there, there, right.
00:08:24.364 - 00:08:26.264, Speaker A: Chimes with all time.
00:08:26.764 - 00:08:41.200, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, I asked a number of times, like, hey, because I was. That actually was the most interesting thing from my perspective. It's like, okay, they're getting actual consumer. Whenever you see something claimed they have a lot of consumer attraction, you're like, wait a minute, like, well, we had.
00:08:41.232 - 00:08:49.164, Speaker B: We had a very combative episode with. Do you remember that episode with, with, uh, with Doe? It was very, it was one of those combative episodes we've ever done on Empire.
00:08:50.264 - 00:09:14.804, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, I think that was the, the big difference now. And, uh, anyways, I want to go back to, obviously, v three perps. And perps seem to be all the rage these days. And, you know, you have GMX, you have other copycats, as you call them, which, you know, I'm curious, maybe if you can touch a little bit on that. You know, what's the main novelty historically? Some of the challenges that have.
00:09:16.824 - 00:09:17.184, Speaker A: The.
00:09:17.224 - 00:09:24.724, Speaker C: Challenges around deploying perps on chain and why it's different now. And, you know, what does a trader experience look like?
00:09:25.744 - 00:09:34.168, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, if I may, I can't help but, like, get embroiled in the drama, right, of even the.
00:09:34.256 - 00:09:36.364, Speaker C: It wouldn't be a Kane episode if.
00:09:38.544 - 00:10:24.770, Speaker A: So. Like, I find it so interesting, right? Like, you know, the whole mechanism by which terror worked, right? And like, you know, I've tweeted about this before. Like, there was a period, like, I'm a very petty person, right? And, you know, I hold grudges for a really long time. Like, you can even see that tweet tonight, like, you know, talking shit about tasteos, right? That's because, like, arthur, like, fucking, like, brushed me one time in like, 2018, and I'm like, one day I will get him back. And, you know, it's that, like, snarky tweet about, like, how dumb it was to use Okamoto to, like, write your whole blockchain. And, like, it's like. So it's very petty, right? But, like, you know, the thing that I always found interesting about Doe was, like, there even from the very beginning when I.
00:10:24.770 - 00:10:47.674, Speaker A: When I met him, you know, I was sitting on stage next to him, and Jordan was in the audience, and it was five stable coins. There was, like, a representative from maker, I think, someone from, like, basis. And they were kind of going through. And they're like, what's your stablecoin design? And. And I'm sitting there and I'm like, the second last person to talk. And dogos. And he literally describes haven.
00:10:47.674 - 00:11:22.310, Speaker A: And I was like, what just happened? I look out, I like Jordan, who is, like, one of the other early synthetics people. And I was, like, looking at him. He's looking at me like, is this real? And I was like, okay, cool. But it's in Korea. And I talked to him later, and he's like, the angle is, like, payments, right? Where we've got all these merchants or whatever, and I was like, okay, cool. And then, like, a year later, no merchant adoption. Like, nothing, right? And then bear market hits real hard.
00:11:22.310 - 00:11:40.206, Speaker A: Like, COVID, everyone's kind of disappeared or whatever. And I'm, like, chiseling this guy's grave. I'm like, basis is gone. Terror is gone. Like, all of these, like, flamingo, slash, whatever, 18 other names that it had is gone. Like, know all of these things have disappeared. And then all of a sudden do just comes back out of nowhere.
00:11:40.206 - 00:12:03.950, Speaker A: And he's like, actually, no, like, all of Korea is powered by this thing now. And I was like, that's just, like, not credible at all. Like, how, like, how is. And then just goes out to a bunch of VC's and raises a ton of money on the fact that this claim that, like, there's 10 million people using this network for payments. And I was just like, that's. That's insane. Like, how.
00:12:03.950 - 00:12:18.782, Speaker A: How could we possibly. It's like, surely someone can go to Korea and, like, disprove this. But, like, there's something about Korea where, like, it's impenetrable to people in the west. They, like, have no ability to, like, you know, like, I'll tell you my.
00:12:18.798 - 00:12:26.886, Speaker C: Side of the story. I met him at Stanford. He was. I think he had gone to Stanford. I met him at a cafe there. He was raising a seed. I'd invested in Haven, as you know.
00:12:26.886 - 00:12:57.204, Speaker C: And it, I was like, well no, it sounds too, too similar. And then he was very combative. Anytime you pressed him hard on any diligence question, he had the knack and the ability to make you feel really stupid for asking the question. And I guess a lot of VC's wouldn't just like, like fall prey to that and be like, sam I think, had a little bit of this too. And then he, for context, he went and did. So we copied the save coin design. He then copied the, the, the, with mirror, I believe.
00:12:57.204 - 00:13:18.864, Speaker C: And I looked at mirror as well. And look, it was a very sweet deal on a number of fronts. It was like attractive, the terms whatnot. And, but I remember calling you and saying, hey look, I think it looks very similar to synthetics. We're gonna have to pass on this. And yeah, one thing I did not want to do at the time was cross cane. He can be benevolent, but he can also.
00:13:20.844 - 00:13:25.584, Speaker A: That would not have gone down well Kane with synthetix.
00:13:25.624 - 00:13:33.296, Speaker B: I mean the way I understand v three is, I mean it's always been a purpose platform, but now you're getting into spot, right, and there's this like kind of new approach.
00:13:33.360 - 00:13:39.004, Speaker A: It actually was a spot platform and spot didn't work right. Like that was the original.
00:13:39.384 - 00:13:52.950, Speaker B: Well that's what I was gonna ask is like why come back to it? It feels like you're, now there's this with Infinix and synthetix, v three kind of this goal to be on par with centralized exchanges. The new collateral model which we were just talking about.
00:13:53.142 - 00:15:06.280, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I think my sense is that perps remain the sort of breakout product in crypto today. And when I look around at the market, it's like what are the things that DeFi can go and credibly take from Cefi and from centralized exchanges? Its perks? Theres 30 50 plus billion a day in notional volume and DeFi is doing like a billion of it, maybe a little bit more on a good day. And so I look at that, im like, okay, theres just a huge opportunity here to take that on versus a spot where I think DeFi has made better inroads. Uniswap is, has done a really good job and there's a whole bunch of aggregators of different AmM platforms or whatever. So to go after that feels more challenging, I think. Which isn't to say we won't have spot tokens. I think there are use cases for a synthetic spot token, especially for things like bridging.
00:15:06.280 - 00:15:13.692, Speaker A: But at the moment, the obvious focus has to be perps. That's the product that people care about, and that will move markets, I guess.
00:15:13.828 - 00:15:41.078, Speaker B: Yeah. So if we accept the. You had this one of your blog posts, it was like, if we accept the synthetics protocol needs to be where the users are, how does it get there? And there are these kind of three approaches that you guys laid out. I'd be curious how you made those. I think one of them was deploying, is like, fork it all the way. Basically deploy a fork of synthetics on every single chain. The next was, I think, implement this, like, the unified liquidity theory.
00:15:41.078 - 00:15:55.194, Speaker B: And the next one was. I don't remember the next one. Something about minimizing messaging. Or you can tell me the third one. But I'd be curious about how you thought about those three decisions and how you came to the conclusion of what to actually do there.
00:15:55.534 - 00:16:50.854, Speaker A: Well, so I think the. We've always had this pretty grand vision, right, of like, when we get to a point of multi chain synthetics, that it needs to be a unified protocol. And that, I think, has been constrained by the fact that synthetix, if you lose the sort of fungibility of the network and of the tokens and of the debt pool and all of these things, it kind of breaks down. And we had an aversion to just kind of forking it and deploying it onto different networks for a couple of reasons. One was fragmenting liquidity, because you also have this problem, like, SNX is the only collateral, and it's a finite resource. You can't really fork the token onto every chain. You could, but it doesn't even really solve the problem.
00:16:50.854 - 00:17:17.876, Speaker A: Crypto inefficiency allows you to get away with that for a little while. You can fork it two or three times. Eventually, people are going to catch on to wait. This is just the same thing. You're just printing more of it every time you go to a new network. So we had all these constraints where it was like, okay, we need this unified cross chain messaging thing. And really, I think the actual answer was no.
00:17:17.876 - 00:17:53.144, Speaker A: This collateral constraint of s and x and fragmented liquidity is what's holding you back. We don't even have a credible path to this unified messaging protocol, where the state of every single deployment on every single chain is in sync. I don't think even chainlink or any of. I don't think there's anyone out there who's doing cross chain messaging is like, yeah, we're about to nail that. That's just a long term thing. It's like, okay, we can wait for that, or we can maybe pivot and try a different purpose approach.
00:17:53.844 - 00:18:07.372, Speaker C: And just for context here, because I remember you being one of the first ones to really start thinking about an l two. Given how fee intensive synthetix was, you have to claim your back to fees. You have to claim your fees every Wednesday. Was. I remember I had it.
00:18:07.428 - 00:18:10.084, Speaker A: You know, you still do. You still do. Exactly.
00:18:10.204 - 00:18:34.144, Speaker C: It just is like coffee, right? Just getting coffee every Wednesday. You had to claim your fees, and it was very expensive for many users. And so you then start thinking about an l two. You become very close with the optimism team. People should go back and listen to some of those episodes. Now you're in a state where, okay, you're deploying optimism. I think you were one of the first, if not the first, and now you're facing a different kind of challenge.
00:18:34.144 - 00:19:40.084, Speaker C: I think I'm looking now in an environment where over the last couple of weeks, the market's been up only. And in this market environment, which you've not had, some of these mechanism designs start to crack. Like, you know, because the bigger challenge that I think people don't appreciate in synthetix model is anytime you're minting and claiming these fees, you're essentially taking short on a market that can be a very volatile and you don't want to be caught. If you're always short on crypto, you can lose a lot of money. But the way that happens in the synthetix model is a bit different than a GMX model or some traditional kind of market maker being consistently short. So I want to perhaps now or later dig into that distinction because I think it really ties into, can this perp really work on chain and can it scale? Because you always need to attract a pretty balanced market where people are taking both the long and short, and the protocol is always net neutral because you don't want to be taking any market directionality.
00:19:40.784 - 00:20:45.034, Speaker A: So I think this is a really good question. And again, I tweeted about this maybe like a couple weeks ago, where I was like, I'm probably the person with the single largest lifetime losses staking or lp and a non delta neutral derivatives protocol. And it's partially a joke and partially not even funny at all. The amount of money that I've lost is in the tens of millions of dollars from staking in synthetics for a whole bunch of reasons. The primary reason is that for the vast majority of its life, until a couple of synthetic ccs turned up and they were like, wait, what if we didn't have to have directional exposure, the old school synthetics way was, yeah, directional exposure is inevitable, right? Like, you can't avoid it. If the market's going down, then people are going to want to be short, and if the market's going up, people going to want to be long. And so your job as a staker is just to hedge this, to take your assets and hedge it.
00:20:45.034 - 00:21:54.834, Speaker A: Now, that is easier said than done, and the market can move really quickly. And then also you do a couple of weird experiments, and all of a sudden, the skew in the network is maybe different to your directional bias. And now I'm long, but then the market's crashing, and as the market's crashing, my debts going up, and so I'm losing money on my hedges, and my debt's actually increasing, right, because of weird issues with, like, wrappers. And we don't even get into the details, but, like, we just didn't have a good way of scaling the collateral and scaling the amount of assets in the network without doing weird things like wrapping, which just increased this skew in the network. It forced us to almost be like, no matter what direction the market was going, we were positioned in the opposite direction. It had to do with curve pools and a whole bunch of weird stuff. Then a couple of people came along and they were like, well, that's dumb.
00:21:54.834 - 00:22:37.024, Speaker A: Why don't we actually build a mechanism where the market actually brings it back into alignment? And we've been working on that for a while in this perps thing. And we tried to do it, and the first version didn't quite get it right. The incentives weren't really aligned, and then we tweaked it again. And this new version that's been operating now for a year, the latest version, you can look at some of the charts. I don't have them here, but maybe you guys can, we can track them down for you. But, like, they're like some of the most beautiful charts you can imagine in crypto. Like, it's just a line that, like, ticks along and there'll be, like, a little spike, and then it comes back down.
00:22:37.024 - 00:23:18.182, Speaker A: Little spike. And, like, the spikes are for like minutes or hours sometimes, and it's just like this perfectly delta neutral, long, short thing that just keeps going, works. And this, the upgrade, the purpose of p three upgrade just makes it even better, increases the incentive alignment for people to bring the market back into alignment. So all of a sudden, what used to be this thing where you needed to get paid a ton of yield to justify taking the risk of staking in synthetix. All of a sudden now you actually have no market exposure. You don't have to hedge yourself at all the thing hedges for you. And the market has not yet worked this out, that staking s and x is no longer this high risk activity.
00:23:18.182 - 00:23:50.798, Speaker A: It's actually a super low risk activity where you still have black swan exposure or something like that. But even in weird stuff like ripple, when that ripple thing came out and ripple spiked crazily and then crashed back down, then spiked again, the total exposure of the Deadpool is like a million dollars. And this is how funny it is. Back in the day, losing a million dollars LP in Synthetix was like a Tuesday. Like, it was not even like an event. Like, it was just like, oh, yeah, of course. Like, we're up a million, we're down a million.
00:23:50.798 - 00:24:07.286, Speaker A: Like it would. It was so volatile, the Deadpool. But all of a sudden, people got so used to this that they were like up in arms that we lost. And I was like, guys, like, losing a million dollars, like, that's the entire network. That's, you know, it's a. It's a billion dollar network, and we lost a million dollars in a day, right. And then people like this unacceptable.
00:24:07.286 - 00:24:17.180, Speaker A: So it's just really evolved to a point where the expectation has just shifted of what you have to do. But that's not the case for everyone.
00:24:17.372 - 00:24:19.740, Speaker C: Right? Not everyone has worked this out yet.
00:24:19.932 - 00:24:20.356, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:20.420 - 00:25:11.254, Speaker C: And I wanted to dig deeper into that mechanism, and I guess for the uninitiated, because perps are very novel to crypto. Historically, it's a market that has been dominated by centralized exchanges, primarily non us. Now Coinbase has launched their own, but it's a really, really capital efficient way to get exposure to particular token. Historically, we talked about this in a prior episode. It's relied on this funding rate to keep the market in check of rewarding any imbalance, whether you're long, if the market's really long, it rewards someone to go short and vice versa. With this funding rate mechanism, which is constantly, dynamically adjusting based on the flows. Can you talk about how that mechanism is working in synthetics and then go into the differences between other protocols?
00:25:11.834 - 00:26:05.408, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the perp design that Bitmex initiated, it's really genius, right? It solves a whole bunch of problems with futures that I think in terms of financial engineering, novelty or whatever, it's one of the most amazing things that's been done in crypto. Right. But the way that you keep prices in line with a traditional perp is people can keep buying. The spot price of bitcoin could be thirty k. And because of leverage, if people are directionally long, like, they can just keep pushing the price up. There's nothing to say that the perp can't trade at like $50,000.
00:26:05.408 - 00:26:45.030, Speaker A: Right? But there is, and this is the key sort of mechanism, design improvement, which is the funding rate. You can keep buying as long as you want, but keeping that position open will cost you an increasing amount of money to the point where it becomes punitive and people are forced to sort of close their positions. Right. And so that is what keeps the spot price and the market price of the, the perp, the derivative in line in an amm style oracle based perp. This is not a problem for us. The spot price is the oracle price. They're the same thing.
00:26:45.030 - 00:27:29.664, Speaker A: They can't actually deviate. Now, the problem with them not deviating is you've got a ton of degens with a bunch of leverage that want to go long bitcoin, and the price just stays 30k. They can just keep going. You can hit that thing all day long and it goes thirty k. Thirty k, thirty k, thirty k. And you've got all this directional exposure because you're not actually shifting the price away or tamping down this thing. And so the mechanism that we use in synthetix is, we say if the market is directionally long and the skew in the market is skewed long, then those people pay the funding rate, which is kind of the same mechanism of if the price is out of alignment, then the longs pay the shorts.
00:27:29.664 - 00:28:03.754, Speaker A: We don't have the price being out of alignment. What we have is the market being dislocated, where there's too many longs and not enough shorts because you're not trading against each other, you're trading against the amm. That solution was the right solution. It just took a while to dial in the exact parameters, and we've got them dialed in now. And that's where I say this graph is like, as soon as someone comes along and hits that and gets the skew out of lineman arbors, come in and just go bring it straight back down. So, yeah, that's how it works and why it works.
00:28:04.094 - 00:28:31.734, Speaker C: Yeah. From a trader experience, the funding rate oftentimes has been less competitive on chain and the fees, of course, have been higher. Are we closer now to parity? Well, certainly. I mean, there's a subset of users that refuse now to use certain perps because they don't want to use binance or whatever, but are we kind of. How close are we to being a parody with the exchange experience on the off chain experience?
00:28:32.274 - 00:29:20.434, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think, like, my. My intuition and. And, you know, I don't even know if this is, this is accurate, but my intuition for, like, perks that are based on this Amm model is that the funding rate, on average, will approach zero as the open interest gets larger, because the dislocation of a single person coming in and hitting a million dollar notional position just doesn't really move the dial. If you've got this huge bucket of open interest, you've got this tiny little thing that's moving along that will compress the funding rates. Fact that funding rates are, I think, on average, like, in the large markets, I can only speak to synthetics, but it's like, two to three times higher on average, which is not amazing. Right? Like, that's.
00:29:20.434 - 00:29:35.738, Speaker A: That's something that, you know, we should be aspiring to improve. I think people do sometimes get confused because they. They look at the, like, eight hour funding rate on finance or something like that. Because the way the funding rates are kind of managed.
00:29:35.786 - 00:29:37.782, Speaker C: Yeah. They're. They're also not uniform.
00:29:37.958 - 00:29:39.150, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not uniform.
00:29:39.182 - 00:29:39.934, Speaker B: It's a bit weird.
00:29:40.014 - 00:30:28.938, Speaker A: They've got different lengths of time for funding rate, and they're discrete intervals versus continuous funding. My view is, honestly, continuous funding is a feature, it's not a bug. And these discrete eight hour intervals, even though it gives you, in theory, more certainty as an arbitrage or whatever, of what the funding rate will be, it's actually an inefficiency in the market. The market actually can be less efficient because you're not reflecting the actual current state. You've got this weird eight hour lag of, like, where the state is. And so you end up with these kind of swings around those points where the funding rate changes, where people are closing and opening positions, and it just creates market inefficiency. So, like, having anything in continuous time is.
00:30:28.938 - 00:31:06.978, Speaker A: Is going to be more accurate. So I think it's an improvement, but it does cause people to get a bit freaked out because they're like, oh, the funding rate is this, which is the continuous, like, 1 hour funding rate, versus, like, an eight hour whatever. But if we had a billion dollars of open interest in the BTC perp market on synthetix, I think the funding rate would drop down to, you know, close to or maybe even less than. We don't really know. You kind of need to see empirically how the market responds, but, like, it would compress it significantly. Right. The open interest now is, is much, much smaller than most of the perks.
00:31:07.026 - 00:31:08.826, Speaker B: It's just a functional size, right?
00:31:09.010 - 00:31:26.664, Speaker A: Yeah, like, in theory, right? Like, you don't know how to react because if you jack it up, then maybe someone comes in and like, hits you with a hundred million dollar emotional trade, which. Great, I would love that. That would be awesome. But we'll sort of see, like, over time it has compressed a little bit.
00:31:27.324 - 00:31:33.544, Speaker C: And what kind of traders are. How would you kind of characterize the pool of traders that are using this?
00:31:34.644 - 00:31:53.934, Speaker A: So this is an interesting question because I have no idea. I've been for the last five or six years operating in an environment where we do not talk to users nor really care about their preferences.
00:31:57.594 - 00:32:05.014, Speaker B: If you build an app in fintech, you have so much first party data on those users, you have none of that in defi, and it's just not worth the headache to try to figure it out.
00:32:05.794 - 00:32:37.480, Speaker A: It's even maybe worse. In synthetix, we went out of our way to completely block the ability to capture any customer data. Like, we actually, like, disconnect. You know, we had heat maps and stuff in the early days and we, like, there was a little bit of kind of uproar, like back in like, 2019 or something like that. And I was like, you know what? Actually, this is fair. Like, if the purpose of this is for it to be this, you know, open permissionless thing, why are we capturing all this, like, metadata about people who shouldn't be doing that?
00:32:37.552 - 00:32:39.104, Speaker B: So that's user data.
00:32:39.264 - 00:32:58.098, Speaker C: But you certainly have. You certainly have the ability to understand, okay, the average user that is using this perp in synthetix also has interactive with GMX. His average wallet here is 10,000. Or you kind of segment it into wallet sizes and perhaps you start.
00:32:58.146 - 00:33:58.582, Speaker A: You can do that. The question is, do you do that? Certainly in the case of, I think I can only speak for synthetix, make an effort to do that. It just wasn't something that we did, which is, it's its own thing, I guess. But what's interesting is over the last three months, as we've been working on Infinex, there is a different social contract. At least it feels like implicitly there is. If you turn up and you put a username, password, email, you know, in and create an account there, and obviously, you know, you need to sort of accept there's going to be some, you know, tracking or whatever, it's a bit different to, like, turning up to what is supposed to be a very thin client layer in the form of, like, a defi dap that really shouldn't be, like, tracking you or doing or storing information about you or whatever. It's just supposed to be a very thin layer that sits on top of the contracts, at least ideologically.
00:33:58.582 - 00:34:42.413, Speaker A: That was my view, maybe wrongly, but, like, that's just kind of the view that we've had. But if you've got, like, this rich web two, like, experience where you're actually inside of a platform and the platform is giving you access to the things, it feels much more reasonable to identify what users are doing and, like, what are they clicking on? What are they not clicking on? Where are they getting confused? And. And so all of a sudden, you know, we've got people that are, like, doing user interviews, and it's hilarious because, like, you know, people are saying things that I'm like, huh, that would have been good to know. That was the thing, like, never occurred to us, really, to, like, talk to people. You know, we talk to them in discord. But, like, yeah, it's not very. It's not a structured synthetix.
00:34:42.453 - 00:34:48.421, Speaker C: Discord is not exactly. They're very vocal, I guess. It's not very user interview.
00:34:48.437 - 00:35:19.878, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18, 18th to 20th for blockworks 8th ever Digital Asset Summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter FIS, JPMorgan, Framework. Folks coming out.
00:35:19.878 - 00:35:46.226, Speaker B: Wintermute, Vanek golden saks there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the having and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, rwas tokenization and stable coins for global regulatory frameworks. Five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments. And six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there.
00:35:46.226 - 00:36:16.606, Speaker B: Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is Empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20 this episode is brought to you by Toku, the first comprehensive global solution for token compensation and tax compliance. If you say yes to any of the following four questions, Toku is a no brainer solution for you.
00:36:16.606 - 00:37:14.950, Speaker B: Number one, are you planning to launch a token? Number two, is your token already live? Number three, are you currently granting your employees or contractors vesting token rewards? And number four, are you trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team? If yes, you have to get in touch with the Toku team. Toku to high level makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. You get unmatched legal and tax support to both grant and administer your global team's tokens. Toku navigates this across the entire token lifecycle, from easy to use token grant award templates through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings. Toku makes it simple for leading companies in the space, including protocol Labs, DyDx Foundation, Minute Foundation, Hedera, Gnosisafe, Gitcoin, and many more.

00:37:14.950 - 00:37:53.984, Speaker B: empire. Click the link in the description or dm me on Twitter and I'll get you connected to the team. I have one more question actually, about synthetics. Before we, before we move on to Infinix stuff, um, we were talking about optimism can why? What? Like when you think about l one S and just like the execution layer, in a perfect world, users would just go to the best product. They wouldn't really care about the execution layer. But it's clear because databases have tokens that they do care about the execution layer. I'd just be curious to get your updated view on how long this fragmentation of users at the execution layer lasts.
00:37:54.964 - 00:38:34.462, Speaker A: Until someone comes along and aggregates the users at a layer higher than the execution layer. And that's not supposed to be like a cryptic response. At the moment, this is the way that we interact. Most of defi interacts with smart contracts. We have our own wallet that we own. We have a plugin or a hardware wallet or some combination of those, and we turn up to Aave or uniswap or whatever and we click connect. Wallet and I take my thing that I own, that I control, right, whether it's a plugin on my browser or it's a hardware wallet, and we click connect.
00:38:34.462 - 00:39:14.462, Speaker A: I connect my thing, I do my thing and I disconnect. Bang. The relationship is very transactional in a way that doesn't exist anywhere else. Then I go to a different app and I click that and I connect, and I do the thing, and I disconnect. There is no sort of longevity of relationship there. Like, I'm not like a user on the platform of Aave the way that I am like, a user on the platform of, like, Instagram, where, like, I have an account and I go to the thing and, like, the information's in that thing. And so there's no way to really aggregate users or aggregate, you know, even liquidity or assets or whatever.
00:39:14.462 - 00:39:36.720, Speaker A: Right? And so one of the things that I think about Infinix that we will be able to do is we will be able to say, you have an Infinix account. You sign into that account. It's your username and password that you put in. Once you put that in, you turn up, and there's a whole menu of things that you can do. One is perps, one might be spot. It might be spot via uniswap. It might be spot via cow swap.
00:39:36.720 - 00:40:05.952, Speaker A: It might be spot via some aggregator or something like that. You can also stake eat. It might be Lido, it might be rocket pool. It might be, you know, an aggregator of both of them. Right? But you will have your assets on that platform. When you think, I want to go and do a thing, you will not think, let me go and grab my piece of hardware where all of my things exist, and bring that to the platform connected, and then disconnect it. You will just log in and all your stuff is there, and you just choose the thing you want to do.
00:40:05.952 - 00:40:51.676, Speaker A: And all of a sudden, we'll have, like, aggregation of users and of the user assets in a permissionless layer. It's still non custodial. We're not doing a c five thing where we're trapping their assets in a database and taking control of them. But we're going to have this aggregation layer that sits on top of all of these smart contracts, and we'll be able to present to users new things as they arise, like friend tech or some novel thing. Until that happens, people are going to exist on their favorite place where they like to connect their wallet. Right? Like, I connect my wallet to things that are on arbitrum. Like, that's a sensible thing to think in 2023.
00:40:51.676 - 00:40:56.396, Speaker A: I don't know if that will be a sensible thing to think for the average user in 2025.
00:40:56.540 - 00:41:29.680, Speaker C: Hopefully not. Well, I mean, exchanges have been, if you look at the behavior that has happened in certain moments of time, like when binance launched BSC, all of a sudden, all their users just went to BSC. They didn't know any better, I guess. And Coinbase has also been at times very opinionated in which l two s it allows direct withdrawals. And so, you know, my view is we're just so early. Everyone's kind of a beta tester. When you, once you get like 1020, 30, 50 million people, that's the type of user that will just absolutely no care, may not even know what Ethereum or Solana is.
00:41:29.680 - 00:41:55.768, Speaker C: You just will want to do stuff. So you launch Infinix. I remember you called me, said I'm kind of. I think it's now the time to really allow users to deliver an experience, to aggregate it and kind of curate. Is it fair to say your role at that point is when someone logs in and creates an account, you are curating the menu of things that show up.
00:41:55.816 - 00:41:56.300, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:56.432 - 00:42:44.684, Speaker C: In a similar manner, when the first iPhone came out, Apple had a say and still very much does. On which apps show up what you can do and not do, you're potentially taking a view on which apps are secure vetted, which are not. So is that true? And also, what role as a developer do you take in this protocol? And how does a user experience compare to some of the other products that have been around for a while? Like some of the easier wallets, like Argent and Phantom, and some of these others that have been around for a while? But I think all of them, especially like Argent, has hit in my point, like a wallet hasn't scaled as much as I would have hoped.
00:42:46.464 - 00:43:31.064, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question why the wallet thing hasn't worked. Right. My sense is that one of the reasons is that the vast majority of people in crypto, for a long time at least, do most of their transactions on a desktop or laptop. It's in browser. That's just where most of the activity happens. And trying to migrate them on there, when a lot of dapps the mobile app experiences is very weak, I would say is challenging. Every time people try and do that, it's just a hard thing to shake.
00:43:31.064 - 00:44:12.356, Speaker A: But I think that also has to do with signing and custody and a whole bunch of things. The question of why will this work versus something else? I think the primary thing in my mind is that you need to have a product that people want to use, like that they're desperate to use. Right. And at the moment, people really want to use perps. There's a ton of people using perps. 95% of the volume that's happening is happening in centralized exchanges, in people's databases. And most people, it's not that it's inaccessible to them.
00:44:12.356 - 00:45:05.436, Speaker A: It's just not really like a good ux to justify them moving. Right. They're willing to take the risk of getting rugged by a centralized exchange, which is not even, like, a crazy idea, you know, in 2023, given what just happened so recently. And yet people are willing to take that risk because the UX is just not there for DeFi. And so if we can get the onboarding and user experience up to the same level, like the web two level that people expect from a centralized exchange, then I think that can be the wedge that we drive in to really kind of bring some users onto the platform. And having done that, once you go to user base with their assets there, it's hard to get people to migrate their assets to your wallet when they're already kind of on metamask or they're on, you know, hardware wallet or whatever. Right.
00:45:05.436 - 00:45:58.058, Speaker A: Like, that's probably been the hard thing, I think. But once the assets are there, then you just. It's a distribution channel. So to your point around, like, the App Store. Yeah, probably it starts curated, but one of the things we've already done, as we've decentralized governance very rapidly, has been to allow people to earn governance points from being a c five trader, from, you know, potentially being like, a uniswap trader, from being a GMX trader. And so, you know, the next thing that we add, let's say it's staking, right? So now if you are, you know, a Lido staker, a rocket pool staker, or even like, a solo validator, you'll be able to earn governance points. And why do we do that? Because we want the people who are doing these things to be participating in the ecosystem and deciding which of the integrations are sort of most optimal.
00:45:58.058 - 00:46:07.174, Speaker A: Right. And helping to vet them. So it's this, like, you know, governance curated App Store of every defi app, if you will.
00:46:07.874 - 00:46:26.984, Speaker C: Yeah. And the revenue model for you guys is you're taking some commission off of user underlying user activities. Say they're using go to Uniswap, you take part of the swap fee, or you strike referral programs with these protocols just on a per user basis. How does the monetization work?
00:46:27.524 - 00:47:01.754, Speaker A: Yeah. So perps is easy because there's already a mechanism for this, right? Like there's this rev share kind of baked in with these protocols. You know, Uniswap just added, you know, just added the front end fee. Right. You know, things like liquidity have had, like, this front end integration fee for a long time. I think the more aggregators there are, the more pressure there will be. Because if you have two lending protocols and one has this baked in and the other one doesn't, well, I can tell you which way governance is going to go, right.
00:47:01.754 - 00:47:11.234, Speaker A: If Aave implements a 10% referral fee, the governance point holders are going to be like, well, we're going to Aave. That's just what's happening.
00:47:11.894 - 00:47:52.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw a tweet of yours not too long ago. It said there's a huge process to select the initial delegates, I believe. And you came out of that. I think there was a lot of reception, there was a lot of excitement, a lot within, from within the synthetics community. And then you tweeted, my God, this is really painful and something to the effect of we need better tools to identify really good delegates. And my question was, well, and my response to that was, I totally agree. I think when we find this type of tool, it will help fix democracy.
00:47:52.104 - 00:48:49.702, Speaker C: And I think there's a broad discussion. I think, look, every protocol out there at some point has a DAO decentralizes governance. There's decisions that need to be made. You can be protocol light or protocol heavy. There still needs to be some sort of dao that for decentralization purposes and taking some sort of action on these decisions. What's your just now overall kind of house view on dows and governance, and how do we go from here? Because I think especially in bear markets, the attention really wanes and there are a whole host of vectors in Dow governance that I think haven't surfaced. But are there especially, I worry in a bull market, some of these vectors probably will get exploited once the, like these Dallas control sizable treasuries can make protocol upgrades.
00:48:49.702 - 00:49:06.166, Speaker C: I mean, some of them perhaps haven't been as carefully architected and it might expose some pretty big cracks now or down the road. And then the participation rate has been zero. So anyways, loaded question, but what's the house view on Dow?
00:49:06.270 - 00:49:52.288, Speaker A: Look, there's a lot to unpack. There's, I'm, you know, somehow I've been able to maintain like my naivete around governance in spite of like years of being beaten over the head with all of the governance problems and, you know, even like thinking about a bear market. I said this, you know, as the market kind of turned a couple of years ago for Defi, certainly, like now is the time, right, in a bull market, no one's ever going to focus on governance, right? Like everyone's like scrambling around to catch the money falling out of the sky. Right. Like, governance is the least of our concerns. And in the bear market, we need to focus on that. Look, I don't even want to say that we've made an attempt at that.
00:49:52.288 - 00:50:16.438, Speaker A: And, like, I'll hold synthetics particularly to task here. Right. Synthetix, over the last, I would say, 18 months, has had the least governance upgrades of its life. Right. So we've had 18 months of bear market, you know, kind of down only. And in the lifetime of synthetix, it's done less to upgrade its governance than it's ever done. Right at any other time.
00:50:16.438 - 00:50:53.944, Speaker A: And I just, like, I think the incentives are just not there. Right. Like, what I've realized is it actually requires someone, you know, driving that. Like, you need someone who's mandated to drive that and, like, force people to, like, make, because it doesn't matter whether it's a bear market or a bull market, it's never going to be the sexiest, most urgent thing to do. Right. And so, you know, how, how you get a community to, like, invest in governance improvements? I just, I don't know the answer to that. And that it's probably the thing that I'm most concerned about just in decentralized governance.
00:50:54.464 - 00:51:24.718, Speaker C: Well, that's interesting because if I remember correctly, your governance was very active historically in bear markets. Like the first 2017. I mean, it was a huge haven to synthetix overhaul. Look, a lot of it perhaps was the core team, the haven team, and other people that surfaced from within the community in the discord. But then over time, we've had other kind of ups and downs. And I just remember the amount of upgrades on this sort of cadence of every three months or so.
00:51:24.766 - 00:51:57.494, Speaker A: But, yeah, so I think just to be clear, right, like, governance is as lively, if not more lively than it's ever been, but it's static. Right? Like, there is no attempt to improve the governance. Right. So it's like we have all of these governance issues and, you know, things that should be improved. Like, the most obvious one with Synthetix is the, the protocol Dao, right? Protocol Dao is the multisig that governs the thing. And I've been saying for years, we need to get rid of this. We need a mechanism to bring this fully on chain.
00:51:57.494 - 00:52:52.304, Speaker A: And it's 2023, almost the end of 2023, and yet here we are. It hasn't happened. It's like investing in something like that is just never going to be the highest priority. So, you know, and in, like, in spite of, like, the regulatory environment and like all the pressure that's coming, like we're still not trying to like push further decentralization. It's, it's just a bit scary. And like when I look back like where did it come from? As you say, it came from like probably three or four people in the community, including myself, who just like were obnoxiously agitating for we need to improve this, we need to improve this, we need to improve this. And when those voices are not active all the time, it shifts into this kind of business as usual mode of like, okay, governance works and no one's trying to pick it apart and work out what are the edge cases and the attack vectors.
00:52:53.244 - 00:53:57.956, Speaker C: Here's a thought experiment, because at one point you left the synthetix council or your role as this sort of top down command, you end up going to benevolent dictator. I'm taking a, a less active role and then you have to come back after a year or so saying no. Actually I think there needs to be a little bit more handholding here and top down directive. And I think it's that tension of look, for better or for worse regulatory environment has dictated decentralized as quickly and humanly fast as possible. And I think that comes with a serious trade off of the cadence by which you ship the, like I unfortunately think said differently, if you invert, if the regulatory environment was not such, I think you would not see this push towards rapid decentralization on the governance side and you would more take an approach of web two, which is like for instance, illuvium your brother. Like games. Like it's like, what are you decentralizing the community has no say, doesn't know how to build a fucking game.
00:53:57.956 - 00:54:32.210, Speaker C: They know how to play it, hopefully. But like there's a very talented team of artists, creators that needs to run ship, right? Even the, I've been on the council there. I think I was the longest standing council member, therefore. And the quality of the conversation was like, God, this is like talking to like kindergartners. Like I'm like there's no, I think everyone feels, yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Like I'm like, there's no business for us to be talking about this. Like I can, I can, if you have an issue, you can call me and I can hopefully hear you out and be a therapist as an investor, not get in the way.
00:54:32.210 - 00:54:33.898, Speaker C: But I'm not here to like, you.
00:54:33.906 - 00:54:34.186, Speaker A: Know what I mean?
00:54:34.210 - 00:54:40.594, Speaker C: Like if you're putting a responsibility for me to vote on these, like, I'm sorry, but it's above my pay grade.
00:54:40.634 - 00:54:41.106, Speaker A: You know what I mean?
00:54:41.130 - 00:55:14.914, Speaker C: And my question, so that was the context for all this. The question really is if we can get some regulatory clarity where tokens can actually have a fee, revenue generation model can be kind of these hybrid, whatever we want to call them, and we don't have to dance around this decentralization theater that happens at times. Do you think that a the type, like, how would you waive in that scenario? How would you go about like, re architecting governance? Or do you even need to have these things?
00:55:15.634 - 00:56:08.034, Speaker A: You know, I sometimes wonder whether, like, the very adversarial and progressively more adversarial environment is actually not like a feature, right? As painful as it is, it's like natural selection, right? There's this forcing function that's sort of culling the weak, if you will, right? The projects that are not willing to decentralized or this chilling effect and forcing everyone to actually be decentralized in a way that I think if regulators were like, this is amazing, this is the best thing ever, we would be completely centralized. What would be the incentive to be decentralized if regulators were like, yeah, great, keep going. It would be just FTX is all the way down.
00:56:10.054 - 00:56:16.830, Speaker C: Like, well, I want to challenge that because I think. You sure the problem with FTX was transparency?
00:56:16.942 - 00:56:18.274, Speaker A: I think, yes.
00:56:18.774 - 00:56:48.306, Speaker C: Now, if you have an environment where you start, you build in the open. It's an open source project. You know, I think you can verify proof of funds, you can verify the source code, you can verify all these things while still, you know, maintaining control. And I think if, if as a token holder, I think we can crystallize the type of like, governance rights that a token may have. Now, of course, a lot of people, there was no board in FTX.
00:56:48.370 - 00:57:39.112, Speaker A: Like, it was just like. But I think, look, FTX is, but like, Luna's extreme. Luna's not far off though, right? Like Luna was its own blockchain, right? How did do managed to centralize that thing so effectively and yet it was like a blockchain. It's pretty impressive, right? You know, people will find a way to maintain control and hold. And so if there was not a forcing function, like this is about control, right. For me, the decentralization is about ensuring that you do not have like some top down hierarchical control mechanism. That's what, like, I think it's a better coordination mechanism, right? And so if we're not using it for coordination, if we're just using it for like, open sourcing the software and making it available, or whatever, that's about, that's valuable.
00:57:39.112 - 00:58:17.516, Speaker A: And I think that would continue, right? Like people would deploy things like uniswap or whatever, right? And maybe we'd have more stuff like that. But the interesting thing to me, or one of the most interesting things is like, how do you actually decide what to do? Like what's the coordination mechanism? And I think the having regulators who say, you know, if this person controls this thing, I'm coming after them. All of a sudden you have to be like, whoa, how am I supposed to do stuff if I don't control it? Yeah, that's not a thing that we've had to deal with like corporations. Like, no, I control it. I'm the guy, I'm the CEO. I control it. I do.
00:58:17.516 - 00:58:30.104, Speaker A: You know, you can be the CEO of like a Linux distro and you release everything open source and you have some weird revenue model, but the control and decision making process is still top down hierarchical.
00:58:31.284 - 00:58:45.104, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's, I guess what you're saying is that comes at the expense of like efficiency and that's just the necessary trade off that one does when you try to build in a decentralized open source context.
00:58:45.924 - 01:00:41.060, Speaker A: So I won't, no, I will actually, like I was gonna say, I'm not gonna explicitly call this out, but like, I have a thesis, right, that if we had not been under such duress, right, to decentralized decision making, that the vast majority of projects, and like, let's take Ethereum, right? And you know, I'm sure some people will be like, this is not right. But honestly, I think if the Ethereum core devs had been operating in like a single room together in an office working on some of the problems, like plasma, whatever, right? Like, we would have gotten to the merge and we'd be where we are today, like in 2018, right? The fact that it was this like distributed coordination mechanism where no one was allowed to have control and what, you know, and like I would argue Vitalik had significant power, right? If not control over those decisions, but like the latency of communication and how everything flowed versus like what you see if you have, you know, a startup where there's 20 people in a room and they're just like focused on this thing, I think it would have been a very different outcome and a very much faster outcome. And part of my reasoning behind that is I've seen the same organization in two different structures, one with like more uncertainty, deliver faster. This is synthetics now I'm talking about, right. You know, we had more uncertainty in 2018, 2019, and we delivered faster, the wrong things, to be fair. But, like, we coordinated around the things that we're trying to deliver so much faster and so much more efficiently than we do today, even though today we have much better sense of where we're going. And, like, we've narrowed the problem space.
01:00:41.060 - 01:01:25.520, Speaker A: And, you know, it's clear what thing is. And it's like. And it's crazy because I actually sit there with people in Infinix, right? And, you know, Infinix is consuming this protocol, and so Infinix will be like, hey, have you guys thought about this thing? Like, we need this thing to work this way, right? And there'll be some conversation that happens, right? And you can literally plot the conversation from five people in a room that are like, we need this thing. And it goes. And then it literally goes, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. And two weeks later, it's back to those people being like, yes. It's like, insane how high latency this is.
01:01:25.520 - 01:01:40.682, Speaker A: Like, it's like, you would sit there and think like, I'm actually joking. And I swear to you I'm not. I've seen it happen multiple times. Times. Because trying to coordinate things in, like, different people, like, the three of us, we've got three different time zones. It's midnight. For me, it's 07:00 a.m.,
01:01:40.682 - 01:01:50.626, Speaker A: like, you know, like, it's just so much harder. And I think people massively underestimate how much harder it is. And I've, like, watched these things in parallel, and, like, it's blown my mind.
01:01:50.810 - 01:02:14.506, Speaker C: Is that a. I mean, it sounds a lot like a bug. Is there some feature component to that where you might surface more insights? Because of this wisdom of the crowds, you're now allowing more people? I mean, because the academic, theoretical might say, well, you know, you're pushing decision making to the nodes, and the nodes really know better, but sometimes, like, no.
01:02:14.530 - 01:02:18.298, Speaker B: Great things ever got built by a committee. And that's what's happening in jazz right now.
01:02:18.426 - 01:02:28.676, Speaker C: Well, look, I mean, I think it's an interesting socioeconomic. This coordination experiment that is happening in blockchains is really fascinating. Anyone should just be paying attention. It's like, because.
01:02:28.860 - 01:02:29.090, Speaker A: Because.
01:02:29.092 - 01:03:05.934, Speaker C: Because the coordination is marginally faster, more incentivized, because there's real value skin in the game. But in spite of that, people are like, it's still really slow. And you could say the same thing about a democracy in theory, when you're voting and people vote with their feet, but when they're voting it impacts their taxes, their schools, their hospitals, like, and still they don't even show up to vote or vote for, you know, terrible people. It's really shocking. So I think this wisdom of the crowds idea is so popular in crypto, but people don't really understand that.
01:03:05.974 - 01:03:20.834, Speaker B: But it sounds like. Kane, are you arguing that when you think about Daos, it sounds like mostly bugs, but there is this one overarching good feature, which is, it's a protective feature against centralization of power.
01:03:21.874 - 01:04:46.040, Speaker A: I think my theory of what the feature is is that you go slower and you go down fewer dead ends. Let's say while I was running synthetix as the dictator, the actual dictator, we went down many dead ends because you're sort of biased towards action, and you're like, let's try this thing. And so there's a lot of wasted resources, I would say. And having unilateral power just creates that kind of problem, at least in, again, it's one data point, but you see more of that. And by forcing people, and I was trying to explain this to some people at Infinix today, right? Like, by forcing people to go through a process of approval that really needs to represent, like, the overall constituents in the. The thing that they're building it. Like, I think it puts a level of rigor on the thinking that sometimes can slip in, like, a startup environment where it's like, move fast and break things, right? Like, it's like, move fast, break fewer things, ideally.
01:04:46.040 - 01:05:46.014, Speaker A: So, like, that's the feature. But the thing that I'm describing is, like, just not even that. I think you can. I think you can have, like, a fast moving thing, and then it does a whole bunch of things, and then it turns up and it's like, what do you think of this? And then you have this mechanism where it's like, yeah, not quite. Go back and try it again, right? And so if the. If the thing that's, like, trying to do all the coordination and solve the problems is a group of people in a room, and it's like, every day they turn up and they're like, we think we solved it, right? And then the people that are vetting the solution are like, you didn't quite get it there, right? It's much easier to sit there and, like, judge the solution, like, make a decision as to whether or not it's, like, fit for purpose than it is to actually solve it, right? And if the solving takes, like, two months because the people are spread all around the world in, like, 80 different time zones, then you have the solvers going out and then they come up and they're like, does this work? And people are like, no. And it's like, okay, cool, we'll see you in a year.
01:05:46.014 - 01:06:22.130, Speaker A: And then they come back and it's like, what the fuck is going on here? We have to have quick solvers and then steal the mechanism that vets the solution. If the solvers are the people who vet the solution, they can lose their minds and they can go off and be like, we've solved it, and they're off in the wrong direction. Right. You need to check on power there. And that's where I think the Daos, like, that's where synthetics works, you know, and it forces the solution to be like, vetted and make sure that all the people are accounted for. It's not like, it's not perfect, but like, I think it's a novel way of coordinating things.
01:06:22.202 - 01:06:22.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:24.194 - 01:07:07.614, Speaker C: How would you go about solving some of the challenges? Look, I hear you on the higher rigor as it comes to decision making, more accountability on chain. Like, you're voting, it's registered, recorded. People now understand how you vote. And, you know, I think in the case of illuvium dow, for instance, you know, is every three months or so you get a rotation, right? So if the community doesn't like you, you're out, right? So there's higher degree of accountability than there is in, I guess, other political systems. But how would you go about just going like, increasing the cadence of shipping of, you know, just actual output from a DaO?
01:07:08.794 - 01:08:10.796, Speaker A: I mean, the thing that I was complaining about is a single person who has been on multiple different councils in multiple different capacities, right? And I can only assume at this point it's just like grifting, right? Like just grifting Dallas, right? Like you get the Dallas type and you turn up and like, you know, maybe you do some stuff. And I think like this person, the first couple of epochs that they were on, you know, the synthetix council, they were fairly involved and then for whatever reason, just stopped being involved, right? And so when out of nowhere, in the last minute, they got elected to the Infinix council, I was just like, what are we doing? Like, how does. No, how did, how have we forgotten about this person? How are we letting them? Surely. And it's because it was a new set of voters. It was like a novel set of voters. And they were just like, this guy has a large following on Twitter. Like, it's got to be legit, right? And there was no other, like, kind of background, like, vet this person, like, has grifted 18 councils over the last five years or something like that.
01:08:10.796 - 01:08:41.674, Speaker A: Right. And so anyway, so I was like, maybe, you know, they've turned over a new leaf, like, let's see. And so I dm'd them and I was like, hey, like, what's your plan here? And they were like, my plans to participate. It's going to be great, whatever. Literally today, the first call doesn't show up and I was just like, like. And so the next thing is like, come up with a mechanism to dismiss people if they don't actually, like, have criteria that people need to meet. And if you don't, you know, if, if the government's in session and you don't turn up, then your goal.
01:08:42.894 - 01:09:13.604, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to transition a bit in just kind of what your near to medium term outlook is for the type of activity that we'll see in infinix, like, you know, or sounds like more engagement and interest. Is there. Stablecoin activity is rising, you know, are we, you know, people are more optimistic. What can we expect to see in, or what are you seeing? I guess, at the protocol level in terms of new signups and interactions on the app.
01:09:15.144 - 01:10:04.872, Speaker A: So we haven't yet, in my opinion, at least measured the things that we will measure post launch. We've got a mailing list of 200,000 plus people that have signed up. The vast, vast majority are airdrop hunters, I can only assume, but of those people, we've been able to get some decent data that there's solidly high single digit thousands that are legit traders that have then either connected an API from binance to show that they've got trading volume on binance. It's not pure airdrop hunting. They're people that are actual traders that want access to the platform. We've got this interesting thing where it's going to be a closed waiting list process to get on right. And people want.
01:10:04.872 - 01:10:37.688, Speaker A: It's a new thing, like, of course people want access. Same whether they wanted access to friend tech or whatever, it's just going to be much more gated because of the way that margining works and there's a finite amount of margin to access, et cetera. You're not going to be able to get 50 invites a day to add people. So we're sort of seeing the demand come from real people. But ultimately, like, our North Star is, there's $50 billion that notional on c five daily. We want that perps volume notional per volume. That's what we want.
01:10:37.816 - 01:10:40.884, Speaker C: What's the highest day recorded? Synthetix is for comparison.
01:10:42.664 - 01:11:06.204, Speaker A: I think just north of a billion, if I remember correctly, like 800. But, you know, there were incentives for a while. So I think we need to probably like unincentivized highest volume, like circa 500 mil, maybe 600 miles, I think. That's not chunky. So. Yeah, no, it's not. It's not nothing, but like, it's still, you know, single digit percentages of the big pie.
01:11:06.204 - 01:11:06.644, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:06.724 - 01:11:59.196, Speaker C: So, yeah, and I want to go just back to something that I want to crystallize in people's minds is like, why would, if the funding rate is not as competitive as a decentralized exchange could just enumerate, kind of the reasons why you'd want to go on chain one is, I guess you're, it's incentivized, so you're in hopes earning some sort of reward, which is okay, at some point, higher volume leads to more capital efficiency, and then you kind of bootstrap your way to that. The other one is just that the mechanism is transparent at times. Your centralized exchanges haven't been as forthcoming or have defrauded users around this funding rate mechanism. In times of high volume, you don't want to use a centralized exchange for, you know, counterparty risk issues. What other reasons might someone kind of want to use synthetix versus continue to use a centralized exchange?
01:11:59.380 - 01:12:37.364, Speaker A: Yeah. So funding rate is one component in fees, the other is your fill price. And so if you're decent sized trader, but not like a whale. This is where I think the competitiveness of DeXs has really improved over the last like six to twelve months. You can get better fills. Like, you will get more, you will get better liquidity on a ton of markets, right? You know, including like high cap markets all the way to like long tail markets. Not necessarily every single trade, but it's no longer like there's worse liquidity in principle on a Dex.
01:12:37.364 - 01:13:24.714, Speaker A: And the only reason to use it is because, you know, ideological or whatever, right? Like, you can legitimately, you know, there's better Arb opportunities at times. There's better fill prices, you know, there's, there's lower fees depending on the direction of the market you're going. So, you know, like the, it's a, if you were a trader and you were saying, I'm not going to trade here at all, and I'm only going to trade here, you will get worse execution on average if you are not factoring this in as like one of your venues that you want to access. Now, if you're the type of trader that's, like, I sit on by a bit and I don't touch anything else, all my assets are there. Okay, cool. We're coming for you, too. We're going to bring you across and say, don't be on bybit for all of these reasons, and we're going to give you better execution, lower fees, etcetera.
01:13:24.714 - 01:13:35.834, Speaker A: But if you're the type of trader that's trading on five different exchanges, depending on market movements or whatever, and you're not considering this as one of your venues, you're just obviously missing out at this point. Like, it's unequivocal.
01:13:36.654 - 01:13:51.012, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's fascinating. Um, we haven't talked about the challenges with other perps. Um, I don't know if you want to go there or do you want to talk about something else? I know we got, you know, like, um, your time is valuable.
01:13:51.068 - 01:13:56.144, Speaker B: So Kane's like, look, I notice 1220 in the morning here.
01:13:57.764 - 01:14:44.724, Speaker A: Yeah. I think, like, the. The interesting thing about this is, like, you are building in public, right? And the trade off that I believe that we get from building in public is not a personal benefit. You do not get a personal benefit from trading from building in public. Sorry. You get a societal benefit. So, like, what does society want? Right? Like, society wants people to go out and do things, build things, try and generate new activity, whatever.
01:14:44.724 - 01:15:33.016, Speaker A: And so society incentivizes people to go and take risks to do things by, you know, ideally providing them with the benefit of it works, right? And so, as a society, we should want, like, lower barriers to entry. We should want people to, you know, we should want to maximize the reward and minimize the downside, right. Ideally for society, we want hundreds of thousands of people going out and making big bets for them, but small bets for society. That's how we progress. Right? And so when you look at Defi, what you get is, like, this shared playing field where, like, you can pick and choose little bits from each thing and, like, everyone can learn from each other, right? The barriers are lower, the learning curve is less steep. Right. You can really pick things up very quickly.
01:15:33.016 - 01:16:08.446, Speaker A: You can turn up and see how people operate their entire organization just in discord. You can work that out. That is valuable to society. It's not valuable to Kane. Warwick. It would be far better for me if we didn't publish how governance works. I would love it if, like, our competitors had no ability to, like, figure out, you know, all of the things that we've done over the years from, like, adopting an EIP style governance system to, like, you know, there's a litany of things that we've done over the years to improve how synthetix works that.
01:16:08.470 - 01:16:14.594, Speaker C: Have then been adopted by Synthetix staking contract that was used on everywhere.
01:16:15.054 - 01:16:27.242, Speaker A: Yeah. Like this. As I say, like, there's a long list. Right? Like, I'm sure. I'm sure there's some. Done a tweet thread on it at some point. But, you know, it would be far better if all of those things had been close from Kane Warwick.
01:16:27.242 - 01:16:54.774, Speaker A: I would be, you know, far better off personally if all of those things had been closed source. And I've been able to use them as my own proprietary thing to maximize the return. But the trade off for me is I get to turn up like I did in 2016 and be like, whoa, what's going on here? Like, how do we build these things? Oh, stable coins. Okay. And I was able to, like, bootstrap myself into this thing and be like, oh, there's a gap. There's a stable point gap. Turns out there wasn't, but it looked like there was.
01:16:54.774 - 01:17:26.072, Speaker A: And, you know, you have a crack at it, and so, you know, like, it was better for me to get in. But once you become an incumbent, right, it's far worse. And so I think a lot of people, like, look at, you know, people borrowing from different protocols or whatever, and it's frustrating. Like, communities are frustrated. They're like, they're stealing our stuff, right? And, yeah, like, on some level it is, right? But, like, on a. On a personal level, it's bad for people to steal your stuff. On a societal level, it's good.
01:17:26.072 - 01:17:47.564, Speaker A: That's what we want and that's why we do it. That's my, like, ideological reason for. That's why we build in public. That's why we do open source stuff. So we don't do weird little, you know, business licensees scammy things where it's like, it's open source ish for, you know, until whatever, 2027 or something like that. Like, I just find all of that, like, not okay.
01:17:48.344 - 01:18:09.540, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think the. The Lindy effect that you get by building in public, like, you still get some recognition, the marginal recognition, and it's just worth kind of revisiting. What are the modes in open source in this world of open source software development? I think the pace of innovation is faster, and, you know, I think the people that are pushing that will get.
01:18:09.572 - 01:18:10.812, Speaker B: Rewarded in other ways.
01:18:10.908 - 01:18:20.612, Speaker C: Certainly not maybe like, immediate financial you know, like, I guess like IP stuff, you know. I think that whole IP kind of monetization is just for lawyers, you know.
01:18:20.628 - 01:18:22.484, Speaker A: And it just doesn't like.
01:18:22.524 - 01:18:57.996, Speaker C: The biggest challenge with investing in open source software pre crypto was that you didn't have a token as a coordination and incentivization layer. And I think that to me was the biggest novelty. All of a sudden you have a rapper and you align developers and users collectively, especially early users and people that are contributing to even a DAO to earn part equity in a token in a network that is building in the open. And that's the connective tissue. Now if the protocol is not chipping or working, people are going to go elsewhere because there's no barrier, which is a feature, not a bug. Like the standard is just higher.
01:18:58.100 - 01:19:03.044, Speaker A: I think it's bad for the protocol, it's good for the world, right? Yeah.
01:19:03.164 - 01:19:07.566, Speaker C: The amount of consumer preference being created is massive. And that's the biggest winner.
01:19:07.750 - 01:19:30.014, Speaker A: We should abandon bad protocols. Like we shouldn't allow bad protocols to lock people in and not escape. Right. It's actually funny you mentioned IP. I remember when we were shutting down the haven entities and the lawyers we were using to go through that process, they were like, but what will you do with the ip? And I was like, I don't care, throw it in the heart.
01:19:30.054 - 01:19:35.204, Speaker C: I guess you could now call them and say, well, doe can take it and run with it.
01:19:38.704 - 01:19:52.284, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I know. But it's like the only ip is the code and it's open source. Like there's nothing else. We don't care about the haven logo. Although maybe it's now worth something. Who knows?
01:19:52.744 - 01:19:58.796, Speaker C: Cain, you've been on the pod now four or five, five times. He's the number one most.
01:19:58.900 - 01:20:03.412, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah, well, it's funny considering the time differences here.
01:20:03.468 - 01:20:16.184, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I'm kind of. I'm curious to see how this plays. It felt very rambly, even, even by my own rambly standards. So I'm curious to see how it lands.
01:20:17.124 - 01:20:43.992, Speaker C: Yeah, well, gonna have to have you on again because I think especially in bull markets, my anxiety level goes up higher than in bear markets. But I think it's important to have folks like you around to make sure that we're not losing sight of some of the mistakes that we've done over the years. And it's so important to just keep that top of mind because, you know, there's another FTX out there, Brew.
01:20:44.088 - 01:20:44.368, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:20:44.416 - 01:20:46.088, Speaker C: Make sure that it just doesn't get to the scale.
01:20:46.136 - 01:20:47.044, Speaker A: But it did.
01:20:47.384 - 01:21:25.984, Speaker C: And some of the learnings that. I think synthetix has always been kind of a. An incubation kind of field for a lot of ideas, people that have come out of the synthetix discord and community, and a lot of the learnings that you guys have had, unfortunately, or unfortunately have had to learn earlier than other protocols. And I think if other protocols can avoid those and look at that, I think it would be pretty interesting. I think, as an overall ecosystem, kind of leapfrog prior mistakes that we've done and. Yeah, yeah. So most of.
01:21:25.984 - 01:21:32.216, Speaker C: I guess, as a wrap, most of your energy now is dedicated to Infinix. Like, you're. You're kind of, like, 90% there, and still that's it.
01:21:32.320 - 01:21:58.548, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm on this. I'm on the spartan council, so I get to get up early tomorrow morning for the spartan council governance call. So that's going to be fun. But, yeah, like, other than that, and, you know, again, what's the point of the spartan council? The spartan council is really there to vet the solution. Is this the right solution? That's our job. So we're not there to prioritize or decide what should be done.
01:21:58.548 - 01:22:15.886, Speaker A: It's like we have an outcome. People go and try and coordinate to get that outcome, and they turn up and they say, is this it? And we say, no or yes. That's our job. It's a pretty easy job, to be honest. You know, when you see it, you see a good solution. You're like, yes, that's the solution. Well done.
01:22:15.886 - 01:22:24.474, Speaker A: Well implemented. Right? Someone turns up with some bridge to nowhere, and you're like, that's not the solution. I'm sorry. And, like, you can just tell.
01:22:25.334 - 01:22:29.622, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Awesome, man. Well, it's great to have you, as always.
01:22:29.798 - 01:22:31.094, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Thanks, guys.
01:22:31.134 - 01:22:31.750, Speaker C: Thanks for coming on.
