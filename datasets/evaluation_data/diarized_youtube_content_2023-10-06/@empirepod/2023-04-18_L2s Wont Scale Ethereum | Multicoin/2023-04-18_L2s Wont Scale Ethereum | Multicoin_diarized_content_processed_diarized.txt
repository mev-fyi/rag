00:00:44.144 - 00:01:31.718, Speaker C: Welcome everybody to another episode of Empire. We have two very special guests. We have Kyle and Tushar from multi Coin Capital. I've gotten to know both of them as an investor in multicoin, vividly remember reading one of Kyle's first blog posts and thought, okay, this is interesting. I don't necessarily agree with everything here, but it struck me as pretty interesting takes and that led me to reach out to them and you know, I followed their journey over the years and really, I think the combination both Tushar and Kyle is very interesting. And so anyways, this should be a great episode recapping everything that's been going on lately and also some of their thesis as they see the space going forward. So, Kyle, Tushar, welcome back to Empire.
00:01:31.718 - 00:01:33.234, Speaker C: Excited to have you guys on.
00:01:33.734 - 00:01:34.994, Speaker D: Thanks for having us.
00:01:35.374 - 00:01:37.234, Speaker B: Good to be back on the show, guys.
00:01:37.534 - 00:02:22.666, Speaker A: I want to spend a lot of this podcast thinking about updated thesis around Solana, other l one s, different ecosystems, things that you guys are excited about right now. But I think there's this kind of like elephant in the room about multicoin was riding higher than any other fund out there. I think you guys avoided some of the mid 2022 snafus like Terra Luna and stuff like that. But then you did get caught up with some of the FTX stuff. And because FTX was so involved with Solana, you guys got hit twice with Solana stuff and FTX stuff and haven't really heard from you guys since then. So did just want to address the elephant in the room. And I think a good starting point is like, how did you get so intertwined with FTX? And what was the relationship there? What did that look like?
00:02:22.850 - 00:02:50.014, Speaker B: Sure, I guess I'll start and then. Sure, feel free to add on top of this. So we sandeshed us to the FTTC ground in March, April 2019. We did not invest at that time, but we certainly watched FTX kind of grow. I think the exchange lost in May or June of 2019. And we watched it grow in those early days. And by the end of 2019, we started to think, hey, this exchange is pretty interesting.
00:02:50.014 - 00:03:27.616, Speaker B: Solana then launched its blockchain about three months later in March, April of 2020. And right around that same time, Defi started to get interesting. You started to see governance go live with compound liquidity. Mining would launch in March, excuse me, in June of 2020. Now it will kick off Defi summer. At the time, I remember Sam was tweeting pretty aggressively about DeFi, and I was pretty intrigued with what they were building at FTX, and it was pretty clear that they wanted to do something with Defi. So reached out to Sam at that time, it was like, hey, what are you doing? You're obviously trying to do something.
00:03:27.616 - 00:03:55.636, Speaker B: And he's like, yeah, I'm trying to build something on EVN, and we just can't make it work. And I was like, you should check out the salad thing. And at the time, salad was three months old. No one had heard of it, and no one took it particularly seriously. That was the start of our formal relationship with Sam. We did invest in serum, which launched 30 days later as FTX grew in prominence. Over the course of 2021, they started raising money.
00:03:55.636 - 00:04:06.482, Speaker B: We did invest in both Ftx.com and in FTX us. We did not lead any of the investment rounds at FTX. Those were led by some larger investors, but we were participants in both of those rounds.
00:04:06.668 - 00:04:29.834, Speaker C: So when did you guys actually know that things were going south? Because things escalated fairly quickly when CZ sort of tweeted that they were going to sell a bunch of the FTT, it was sort of a timeline of 72 hours. Things really escalated. When did you guys actually know that things were going down in FTX, and how did you kind of operate? Walk us through that timeline.
00:04:31.214 - 00:05:31.412, Speaker D: Yeah, it was during breakpoint, so we were in Lisbon and kind of watching the events play out and also watching the community sentiment as things played out. It was like a major topic of conversation, as you might imagine. Honestly, we didn't think there was going to be this level of insolvency or this big of a problem, especially given the very large amount of equity capital that FTX had raised that should serve as a buffer. And in addition to that, this was a profitable business. That made over a billion dollars in revenue in 2021. So there was quite a bit of money there. So we thought, okay, there might be like a duration mismatch, or the capital is tied up in margin positions and it's going to take them some time to unwind it, and that's why this is happening.
00:05:31.412 - 00:05:36.464, Speaker D: We didn't think it was going to be an insolvency problem, as it appears to be.
00:05:38.204 - 00:06:05.904, Speaker A: Was there any, so if I'm trying to remember the dates, it was like breakpoint was November 4, five, six, I think it was. The coindesk report by Ian Allison was November 2. Was there any hesitation or skepticism when. I don't know, what's another moment like? Brett Harrison, for example, resigning in late September. Was there any sort of like, hmm, like Brett, good guy, seems like something fishy is going on or like that just, that doesn't really cross your mind when things are going so well.
00:06:07.844 - 00:06:35.324, Speaker B: Certainly across our mind. And we were investors in FTX us, and so we had a good relationship with Brett. We still do to this day. And we called, actually, Brett called us after he had told San Diego before it was made public to let the other FTX us investors know that was kind of the right thing to do. And he explained, he's like, look, I've been here for a little while. I've caught the startup bug. I want to go launch startup.
00:06:35.324 - 00:07:03.290, Speaker B: He's obviously now bought up a lot. I don't know if he's announced the name for it. He's building some sort of defi crime brokerage type tools, something in that arena. And we were like, look, appreciate you being forthcoming candidate about that with us. We'd like to take a look at your new startup whenever you launch it. We did not end up investing in it, but we always had a good productive relationship with him. And he never alleged or alluded to anything being wrong, and we never expected anything.
00:07:03.290 - 00:07:12.814, Speaker B: It was just like a, hey, he left trading firm, came to start up land that was like, got to start a bug, which pretty reasonable thing to happen.
00:07:13.114 - 00:07:42.134, Speaker C: So I think it's fair to say that, tusha, what you said, which is, I think a lot of people maybe have expected that there was a duration mismatch, but not the level of just outright fraud that was going on and just the loss that was being carried by Alameda. As you look back, what was your impression of Sam throughout all this time, and what are the things that you guys got wrong in this whole process?
00:07:45.274 - 00:07:59.938, Speaker D: So my impression of Sam is he is one of the most hyper intelligent, hyper motivated people that I've ever met. And honestly, I didn't buy this whole media tour after the fact on, like, oh, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
00:08:00.106 - 00:08:00.410, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:00.442 - 00:08:35.310, Speaker D: Like, this guy talked to several of the most sophisticated investors in the world and got them to invest, including, like, sovereign wealth funds and just, like, giant asset managers, the, you know, some of the most storied venture capital funds in the world. And they all loved him because he told a really good story. He was hyper aggressive, and he was focused on addressing an enormous market. So I think, yeah, I think everyone's perception of him was pretty similar.
00:08:35.462 - 00:08:35.726, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:35.750 - 00:09:59.660, Speaker D: Like, this guy was kind of like a superhuman, right? But what I think was underlying that that we missed was the complete lack of governance controls that anyone placed on him, the complete lack of transparency into the internal operations. Now, look, when the CEO of the business goes to the CTO and says, please write this back door into the code such that it doesn't alert the auditors, when I move this money, there's very, very little that can be done from an oversight perspective to prevent that from happening. But you can have some processes in place if you're checking to see where the money is, if there's an up to date balance sheet always presented, if you operate the exchange more like a DeFi protocol where everything is auditable in real time. And I'm hopeful that we as an industry, will learn from this and move exchanges to operate more like DeFi protocols with real time transparency rather than this periodic check in process we have. The future of finance is not quarterly reports. That's an anachronistic 20th century thing. The future of finance is real time visibility into everything that's happening right now.
00:09:59.852 - 00:10:00.268, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:00.316 - 00:10:04.104, Speaker D: And I think that's probably the one thing that could have prevented this.
00:10:05.044 - 00:10:24.144, Speaker C: Yeah. So just to round up the FTX stuff, I know there's other stuff we want to cover, but the last thing I want to touch on is what happens to the funds that are stuck there, because, I mean, you guys had meaningful capital there, as did other folks. You start to withdraw, you take some out, there's still some there left. So what is kind of what happens to those funds?
00:10:26.264 - 00:11:20.556, Speaker D: I mean, the bankruptcy trustee will try to liquidate all of the assets that they have, some of which it appears they have already done, based on some of the announcements that they have made, some of which they have not done, and then everyone gets paid back. The big open question right now is whether there will be clawbacks for the funds that were withdrawn right before the bankruptcy. But the question is, how do you enforce those, especially with international customers? And it's just really messy, and you don't want to treat people differently. You don't want to say, well, actually, only the Americans have to send the money back and everyone else does. That creates lots of weird problems. So I think that's the biggest uncertainty. And then the next thing is just like, what happens to the investments that they made.
00:11:20.556 - 00:11:48.554, Speaker D: For example, they led this investment in anthropic AI, and we've seen this explosion in AI market caps and enthusiasm. Who knows how much that's going to be worth or when that sold. So we are optimistic that there will be some recovery value for the creditors. However, it seems overly optimistic to assume that it's going to be, you know, 100%. That that seems unlikely.
00:11:49.134 - 00:12:08.674, Speaker C: Well, particularly considering that lawyers are, you know, I think that I saw a note today that they're up to date. Like, they've taken 30 million in fees so far. And, you know, I think if we look at the Madoff case, like, these guys will probably take meaningful cents on the dollar that is recovered. So, you know, that's a shame.
00:12:09.274 - 00:12:22.214, Speaker A: Kyle, was this the. I mean, you and Tushar have been in crypto for a while now, but I mean, obviously we're all used to big ups and downs, both in the portfolio, but also, mentally, was this the hardest mental thing to go through?
00:12:23.994 - 00:13:08.344, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely was the hardest mental thing. 2018, that cycle, crypto wasn't taken seriously by the outside world. I wouldn't say there was like a real spotlight on crypto, and certainly not a spotlight on us in any capacity. And having the year we had in 2021, then everyone being like, oh, yeah, look at these suckers, these idiots, whatever, getting dragged out and all this, it was a pretty shitty feeling. And then obviously, people are angry, people have questions, people alleging we were involved. Just a conflux of just a lot of mostly negativity and then some legitimate questions. It's just a very frustrating time.
00:13:08.344 - 00:13:29.914, Speaker B: And we told the whole team, like, hey, y'all are going to be fine. Everyone's going to keep their jobs, keep your head strong, stick through it. Like, we'll get through this. And we did. We haven't laid anyone off. And Martin continues to go strong. And now, with most of the crisis behind us, we can now focus again on what we're supposed to do, which is find amazing investments.
00:13:30.254 - 00:14:04.976, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, I mean, I talked to some port cos and some folks at, like, people at Multicoin. I saw you guys just had a couple of big promotions and like, I think the team, team seems stoked right now. Portfolio company said you guys treated them really well. It seems like maybe the toughest place would have been with the LP's. I saw some, like, angry Twitter threads and there was like a couple stories about the fund being down a lot and like, clawbacks and like, how did. Can you just tell us what happened with, like, the LP's? And obviously, I'm sure 95% of them were, like, fine and understanding, but I'm sure there are outlier 5% cases where there's some angry folks.
00:14:05.040 - 00:14:05.576, Speaker D: What? Like what?
00:14:05.600 - 00:14:07.044, Speaker A: What was it like dealing with them?
00:14:08.184 - 00:14:51.812, Speaker D: Look, whenever you have events like this, there are going to be angry people, and people react to anger in very different ways. We are happy to have a strong base of very diversified and long term oriented LP's, many of whom have been with us through multiple bear cycles. And they know the volatility can be pretty extreme. We are not the risk off part of anyone's portfolio. That's not the purpose that we serve in any way. And everyone knew the risks, which were pretty clearly disclosed. But look, we had a bad year.
00:14:51.812 - 00:15:29.388, Speaker D: Like, we acknowledge that we own that and we learn from those mistakes. That being said, the only way to earn excess returns as an investor, the only way is to be contrarian and be right. If you are contrarian and wrong, you don't earn excess returns. If you are with the herd and right, you just earn market returns. And obviously, if you're with the herd and wrong, that's pretty bad, right? So the only way to earn excess returns is to be contrarian and right. And that's what we're focused on. We're focusing on capturing value across market cycles, not within market cycles.
00:15:29.388 - 00:15:47.344, Speaker D: And while the hedge fund is investing in liquid assets, it's not investing with a six month time horizon or a one year time horizon, it's investing with a longer term time horizon. And we like to joke internally, a lot of disagreements come down to a function of time horizon.
00:15:48.654 - 00:16:13.474, Speaker C: On that point, I do want to touch on position sizing at what point Solana becomes a disproportionate size of your fund. And it took a while, right? What's it like managing that position in hindsight? Should you have sold a chunk of that? Let's start there and then also want to just generally touch on Solana and how you perceive that ecosystem now.
00:16:14.844 - 00:16:57.910, Speaker D: Yeah, I can go first on this and hand it over to Kyle. I would say, look, the people who are going to complain are going to complain. Either way, if we had sold everything in 2021, they would have complained that we sold everything in 2021. If we didn't, they were going to say, oh, look, you're dumb for not selling everything in 2021. We try not to pay too much attention to that. I would say that we continue to have extremely high conviction that Solana represents the right design choices for a scalable blockchain. And we like that much better than the l two designs that we're seeing out there.
00:16:57.910 - 00:17:38.314, Speaker D: And we're focused on the long term. If you invested in ETH early on and then you saw it go from one thousand, four hundred bucks to eighty bucks in the last cycle, that felt pretty terrible. But then if you had the conviction to hold on, you got CE. What's it at right now? Like 2000 and much higher than that in 2021. So you just have to be willing to accept that prices are set on the margin and that humans are really emotional. And if you want to outperform, you have to do things that other people do not do.
00:17:38.774 - 00:17:39.246, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:39.310 - 00:18:08.734, Speaker D: Over indexing on cost basis is, it's like a bias in your logical reasoning. It's almost like sunk cost fallacy. Right? Everyone's familiar with sunk cost fallacy. The money that you already spent, like you've already spent it, that should not be a part of your decision moving forward. You should look at the facts and circumstances today. The same thing is true of looking at cost basis. The fact that it was priced at x, however much time ago, is not necessarily relevant to what is it worth today.
00:18:08.734 - 00:18:38.014, Speaker D: You have to look at the price today. You have to look at what you think it's worth today and then make a decision based on that. You can't beat yourself up too much, because if you let me trade in hindsight, I would be the world's first trillionaire. And it's very easy to trade in hindsight, but you just have to always be looking forward from the moment that you're in. And I think that's the best way to be as rational as possible in a market like this.
00:18:38.794 - 00:19:39.694, Speaker C: So talking about fundamentals and circumstances and kind of updating your thesis, how much of the FTX impact, and we hadn't totally right after kind of the FTX stuff happened, and we asked him a question we'll ask you as well, is does FTX and disassociation and the perception of the market impact Solana's BD efforts, which at the time were going very well, some teams may have left other teams. It's a competitive kind of competing l one ecosystem they can go to Aptos, it can go to avalanche, you can go to elsewhere. And l two, how much of FTX do you think impacts Solana viability or just the willingness of projects to work there? And obviously, the DeFi ecosystem in Solana took a big hit. And I am curious to just take your pulse on Solana, the ecosystem today, and how you see it going forward, particularly in this competitive kind of l one environment.
00:19:40.714 - 00:20:09.510, Speaker B: I guess I'll start here. There's this perception that FTX was acting as the BDR of Solana or something, or some other hand wavyish statements. And I don't think those are really rooted in reality. The most important thing FTX did for Solana was build serum, which was definitely legitimate at the time. They did it in terms of the effort. Obviously, they shipped the code and it was open and then other developers used it. That happened in summer 2020.
00:20:09.510 - 00:20:44.080, Speaker B: Over the next year and a half, two years, FTX did a ton of stuff all over. They were investing in exchanges like IEX and other core CFI infrastructure, things like Robinhood and stocktwits. Like, they were making all these plays. They are doing stuff with Aptos and Swe and vistin labs. They were investing in a bunch of NFT projects. They also launched an NFT exchange that was a centralized, custodial NFT exchange. FTX was very much acting in their own best interest, and you could follow their dollars and see where they're putting their money.
00:20:44.080 - 00:21:21.600, Speaker B: Um, so this kind of, uh, narrative of like, FTX was like, supporting Solana. I just like, I don't understand the claim both in human capital resources or financial resources. Um, they were doing stuff that was in their own self interest. But, like, that's just. They were doing that, you know, that's capitalism, right? So, um, we just never really agree to that characterization. Um, obviously narratives are narratives and like, hey, perception is reality. So, like, yeah, there's some element of that and, hey, memes or thing in crypto and people say, oh, my God, Solana has problems now, then that kind of self reinforcingly earned is a self definite prophecy.
00:21:21.600 - 00:21:35.964, Speaker B: I guess there's problems now, but inevitably those things go away. I mean, narratives are narratives that they fade with time. This intellectual substance kind of matters over the long term. I'll pause there to show you an additive thing.
00:21:38.724 - 00:22:19.422, Speaker D: I'll add something which is just generally on this topic of BD for blockchains, people have been talking a lot about this and have some maybe controversial opinions on it, which is, I think, BD for blockchains is overrated. That's too much of a top down approach. I don't think you're going to achieve the next big breakthrough in web3 by getting a web two company, that's web two, to their DNA to come and build, or some other centralized company to come and build on web3. And you're actually seeing that now in the depths of the bear market. That's the thing that gets dropped.
00:22:19.518 - 00:22:19.750, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:19.782 - 00:22:55.988, Speaker D: Like Disney laid off their entire web3 team because they're cost cutting and they're like, this wasn't core to us anyway. So I think the right kind of quote unquote business development for blockchains is really the bottoms up kind. It's the hackathons. It's getting people who are crypto native who are building net new things that have web3 in their DNA and they're not going to scatter in a bear market. Because one thing I can promise you is this won't be the last bear market. There will be another one after the next bull market. It's going to happen again.
00:22:55.988 - 00:23:07.276, Speaker D: Uh, and I think you want teams with staying power through that, uh, rather than flighty big corporations. All right, quick break from the show.
00:23:07.340 - 00:23:47.592, Speaker A: There is this kind of overused cliche saying in crypto, but it's true. Bear markets are building and everyone tells you that and everyone knows it. What people don't know is that if you're building apps in crypto and building apps in web3 without using quick node, you are building on hard mode. So quicknode is this amazing blockchain development platform. It reduces costs, streamlines, the time to market for your app, and it offers consistent performance at scale for folks that have built apps, you will know that there are a couple key points here. One, Quicknode offers unlimited endpoints across 18 different chains and 35 different networks. They have response times that are two and a half times faster than any of their competitors.
00:23:47.592 - 00:24:31.112, Speaker A: 99.99% uptime and a dedicated 24/7 customer support team. If you've been listening to Empire for a while, you might know that I am no gigabrain developer, but I do know a lot of devs and a lot of great product teams at other places. So when I see Coinbase and Twitter and Adobe and OpenSea and doing analytics, all leveraging and trusting quick node to power their business, that's when we get excited and that's when we want to partner with them. They're the best solution for any leading crypto and web3 company that is seeking an end to end blockchain development platform right out of the box. So my message to you, get off hard mode. Let Quicknode handle the blockchain infrastructure, let quick node handle the security, let quick node handle the performance.
00:24:31.112 - 00:24:58.440, Speaker A: While you focus on building beautiful products for your users, visit quicknode.com comma super easy. You can use code Empire. You'll get a free month on their build plan, so don't forget to use code Empire. Santi and I gotta get credit for this one so they know that we sent you and you will get a first month free. Hope you guys enjoy it. All right, folks, it is time to talk about one of my and a lot of your favorite Defi protocols, Synthetix.
00:24:58.440 - 00:25:37.240, Speaker A: Synthetix has been pushing the limit in defi innovation since 2017 and has just started its most exciting transition yet with Synthetix V three. With Synthetix V three, any protocol can now tap into Synthetix liquidity to bootstrap derivatives markets. The transition has already started with Synthetix purps. Synthetix perps taps into Synthetixs liquidity layer and is a new primitive that developers can leverage to launch defi derivatives. The perps product has been going incredibly well so far. Hopefully youve seen it. Its had some great traction, hitting 500 million in daily volume this March.
00:25:37.240 - 00:26:12.962, Speaker A: We know that liquidity rules defi, and synthetix is becoming the modular liquidity layer for defi derivatives. As a trader, you can trade synthetix perps with low fees in over 20 different markets at quenta IO decentrix.com and polynomial fi. And this opportunity set keeps growing. With ten new partners in the pipeline ready to launch integrations on top of Synthetix, including front ends, structured products, and institutional offerings, the team gave me a sneak peek of all this stuff. It's really cool. Would really recommend you check out Synthetix IO forward slash perps to learn more.
00:26:12.962 - 00:26:40.184, Speaker A: And if you're looking to build on Synthetix, hop into their discord server, reach out to the team directly. Make sure to tell them that Empire and Santi and Yano sent you again, Synthetix IO perps. You can also hop into the discord server and reach out to the team directly. How do you balance, like, signaling conviction behind your bets, which you guys oftentimes love? Sometimes, like, polarizing takes while ensuring you don't miss the next wave.
00:26:44.084 - 00:27:18.152, Speaker B: I want to push back on this characterization. Like, do we write clear theses on our blog? Yeah, obviously. Um, but, like, that's not what makes a good investor a good investor. Um, all the entrepreneurs feel good when their vc's write nice things about them. But, like, that's not what makes us good at our jobs. What makes us good at what we do is like, we help them with their problems. Uh, and that's like, hey, guys, like, you just put on whatever this marketing whatever and like, it's a, here's a problem with it and like, you need to fix this.
00:27:18.152 - 00:27:45.634, Speaker B: Or, hey, there's a strategy over the next 1224 months. Here's the four ways. Whenever this market plays out, which one of these are you playing for and why? What are the freight off? Let's help you think through those discussions. I think our core value prop is in that stuff. Most of that doesn't make its way out of twitter or onto our blog. It's just inherently private conversation. But that's what makes a good investor, a good investor not writing blog posts.
00:27:45.634 - 00:28:49.516, Speaker B: So I think that's important to, like, just characterize, like, what do we do and what does it matter in terms of, like, the follow up part of your question of, like, you know, if we make investment a, does that risk us missing something in the next cycle? And that is always true across all investments and across all investment firms and all investments because of, like, entrepreneurs being scared for competitive reasons or whatever, which is legitimate concerns people can have. And, like, that's just inherent risk to the business, right? I mean, there's nothing, no real way around it. We do our best to be open minded and to look at new things and explore and like, push the ecosystem forward. I think probably the thing we've done that is, like, the most generalized solution to that problem is just make it very clear to people that we will do weird new things. We were the first money in graph. We were the first money in. Are we? We were the first money in, what's it called? Proof of physical work in helium and hydromap, all that stuff.
00:28:49.516 - 00:29:07.974, Speaker B: And we've continued to signal time and time again, like, we will go do things that on the surface feel pretty weird. And, like, in our opinion, that's what matters because, like, the next entrepreneur is the next weird thing. We want them to see that we have a track record of being open minded and trying weirdly stuff.
00:29:08.014 - 00:29:09.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. Let me.
00:29:09.494 - 00:29:09.758, Speaker B: So.
00:29:09.806 - 00:29:35.682, Speaker A: Okay, so I completely agree with that. I mean, yeah, that was well said. My. Maybe where I was going with that, though, is like, I think there's a lot of funds that were also long on Solana or that are long on Solana, but, like, they could kind of hedge their. Like, I was looking at who invested in arbitrum and optimism. And, like, a lot of the firms that were long Solana also, like, they invested in either arbitrum or optimism. I don't think you guys did either of those rounds.
00:29:35.682 - 00:29:56.970, Speaker A: And I'm like, you almost. This is probably not true. I mean, I'm curious if you think this is true, but, like, you almost couldn't have invested in l two s because it's so antithetical to, like, your global state thesis. And for another fund that, like, might have a similar thesis to you, they can kind of hedge and invest in arbitrary optimism because, like, they're not as vocal about their Solana thesis.
00:29:57.002 - 00:30:28.704, Speaker D: Yeah, you have to be contrarian and you have to be right. That's the only way to make excess returns. And if you end up investing in every single platform, what you're really offering is an index product. You specifically cannot earn excess returns. You do the math, and it is not possible to do that. Actually, what I see there is an inherent form of LPGP conflict. The LP's want you to go earn excess returns.
00:30:28.704 - 00:30:51.864, Speaker D: They're not investing in an index fund for an actively managed fund, but gps hedging their bets have a different set of incentives, sometimes from the LP's. We really try to focus on doing what we think is the right thing for our LP's and trying to earn excess returns above what index or the market is going to earn.
00:30:53.084 - 00:31:29.334, Speaker C: How do you think about, on that point, fund size and structure? You guys went from a hedge fund. You then subsequently launched a venture fund, and then as Aum grows naturally, your capacity to earn excess return diminishes. And then, so, you know, a lot of these funds that went from 50 million, 100 million to billion, it's a very different strategy, I would argue. Now the market has expanded substantially, but you could make the point that a lot of these funds are just tracking the index. Right. So how have you managed those kind of decisions? Internally?
00:31:30.794 - 00:32:26.014, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a trade off, actually. Look, there are some ways in which having a bigger fund makes it harder to earn excess returns. Like you said, you have more money to deploy, and that means you have to either pay higher valuations or you have to do more deals that didn't end up working, and that makes it harder. But at the same time, having a larger fund allows you to make opportunities or be involved in opportunities that you couldn't otherwise do. If you've got a $20 million fund, and I know what that feels like because we started with that, you cannot lead around for a larger round you just don't have the capital to do that. You can't price it, you can't help set the terms, you can't influence the project, have the type of token design or other elements that you think are good. So I think it cuts both ways.
00:32:26.014 - 00:33:17.884, Speaker D: Size can make it harder to deploy that amount of capital, but it can also create optionality for you that is quite valuable. So you have to walk the tightrope and stay in the middle there. You don't want necessarily to be the biggest because that's, uh, you know, probably too far on the spectrum, but you also don't want to be the smallest. Uh, you know, I think just like Goldilocks, somewhere in the middle is just right. I think that probably the most valuable thing that a venture investor can do for any entrepreneur is not the money, it's not the connections. Um, it's telling them that they're wrong about something that ends up really mattering. Uh, and, you know, if you're an entrepreneur who doesn't prioritize that, I think you have a lower chance of success than a similar entrepreneur who does prioritize that.
00:33:17.884 - 00:33:43.084, Speaker D: So I kind of like that selection effect. And what I would tell entrepreneurs is like, go talk to our portfolio companies, right? Like, that's where you should build your assessment of if you want to talk to us, not based on Twitter, not based on political affiliations or something like that. That's just not a pragmatic way to look at the world. And, you know, you're just not being fully logical.
00:33:44.064 - 00:34:21.472, Speaker C: Fair enough. So you talk, Kyle, about sort of market size and how you think about that. And we're now at that stage where a lot of people from the outside in, even internally, are questioning what is the actual use case of this industry. Not too dissimilar from the Internet back in the day, but, you know, nonetheless, people are overly critical. Now. Maybe tell us recent investments you made or just thesis that you've had in terms of the killer use cases that you're seeing. I've heard you talk about airdrops and the extent of that could be useful going to market, but that only lasts so long.
00:34:21.472 - 00:34:33.804, Speaker C: If you don't deliver a good product, people are not using it, then it doesn't really matter. It only gets you so far. So walk us through your thesis on what are the killer apps that you see over the next couple of years.
00:34:35.764 - 00:35:19.254, Speaker B: Ill highlight one area Im spending a lot of time on right now, and Im actually Im writing blog posts about this at the current moment. And thats AI and crypto if youve been following me on Twitter the last few months, ive been talking a lot about AI, not because multicore is pivoting or because were launching an AI slide or something. Thats ridiculous. Most of it intellectually very interesting. And then most importantly because I think there's going to be some big winners at the intersection of AI and crypto. And so I want to capitalize those opportunities in the existing multicoin funds. I've identified these three areas at the intersection of AI and crypto that I think make a lot of sense.
00:35:19.254 - 00:35:58.892, Speaker B: And so those three are the first is basically airbnb for your GPU. There is an extreme shortage of GPU's today. Altogether, cloud providers. I don't think this shortage will be resolved anytime soon. The obvious solution is, hey, there are a bunch of graphics cards in people's computers all over the world. They're just not accessible in cloud environments today. So wouldn't it be nice if you can leverage these GPU's to do training and to do inference or these large compute jobs? We've been thinking about this problem for a long time.
00:35:58.892 - 00:36:28.936, Speaker B: This idea has been floating around in crypto circles since 2012. The very first generation of this was proof of useful work when people were still in the bitcoin same line as they were like, oh man, proof of work is great. If only we could make the hashes useful. The first iteration of that was GPU workloads. So I got into crypto in 2016, and that was being talked about, obviously Golan and locked at that time. And iexec. We've been following a bunch of those.
00:36:28.936 - 00:36:59.708, Speaker B: A bunch of them. A new crop launched in 2018. We looked at a bunch of those. We didn't invest in any of them. The first investment we made in the Airbnb for your GPU sector broadly is render token, which we invested in in May of 2021. So roughly two years ago, and we invested in render. We now, at the time we invested in render, we were not thinking about machine learning workloads specifically, although we knew that that was like an opportunity.
00:36:59.708 - 00:37:51.964, Speaker B: But the render network, as its name would suggest, is focused on 3d rendering jobs for like, 3d designers. And we foresaw then, hey, that grows big enough, they'll actually move in ML. Obviously stable diffusion hit in August of 2022 and then chat VPT December of 2022. And it's pretty clear that you can repurpose those render network machines for things that are not free rendering. I think the market's largely picked up on this, and a lot of people are discussing the opportunity for the render network in the context of training and inference. And the render team, they've updated the network table diffusion jobs and they signal they're going to do a lot more stuff in AI. Joule is the creator of Render network, I believe tweeted this morning actually, about this exact thing.
00:37:51.964 - 00:38:20.762, Speaker B: There's more teams working in that sector than just render. We've made one other investment that what I'll loose to call Airbb for your gpu. That design space there is not going to be winner take all. There's going to be different subseconds there with different focuses. But that's obvious. Area number one at the intersection of AI and crypto. Section number two is RLHF with token incentives.
00:38:20.762 - 00:39:15.224, Speaker B: So this is reinforcement learning with human feedback. If you follow discussions around chat, DBT, OpenAI is pretty open about they do a lot of RLHF in trading the models. The most simplistic way to think about RLHF is whenever you use CHA, DBT, at the end of response the there's an up and a down arrow or sorry, thumbs up and thumbs down, and you can tell the model how it's doing. There's a lot more sophisticated ways to do RLHF than just thumbs up and thumbs down. I'm not familiar with the intricacy of how they do the training internally, but they have large teams, it's pretty well documented. They have large teams of people who are providing sophisticated feedback to the developers and to the model itself directly and a function of RLHF. I think there's a pretty interesting opportunity to use token incentives to facilitate large scale RLHF for vertical hydro models.
00:39:15.224 - 00:39:48.384, Speaker B: I'm not particularly convinced that this is going to be useful for a generalized model like chat, JPT or Bard or Microsoft Sydney, or any of these. But as you get into vertical domains, things like medicine, things like law, things like finance, there's going to be a really big opportunity to have people who have this domain knowledge in whatever the area is, who are trained to provide feedback in a systematic way, and who are being compensated via token incentives for the work that they're providing. I suspect there's going to be a lot.
00:39:49.604 - 00:40:02.964, Speaker C: Does this also tie into proof of humanity? Obviously, where the only thing that like you can sign your cryptographic keys, become the proof that you. There's a human behind it, so to speak. Or I maybe.
00:40:04.144 - 00:40:07.392, Speaker B: Yeah, you're one step ahead of me. That's the third major thing I was going to get into.
00:40:07.448 - 00:40:08.164, Speaker D: Okay.
00:40:09.664 - 00:40:58.778, Speaker B: The first iteration of RLHF with token incentives is Hivemapper. When most people think about Hivemapper, they think about getting tokens for driving, which is obviously the primary thing, but a secondary thing that's much less discussed. Although this is live today, is all the map editors in Hivemapper, and those people are receiving honey tokens for providing RLHF to the model, or in this case the map, but they're literally going and doing the edits on the map. So we have the first instantiation of this today. I think there's going to be a lot more versions of those. And then the third major area at the intersection of AI crypto that I'm excited about is this authenticity thing that you just alluded to, Santiago, which is basically like, there's kind of two versions of this. One is, hey, my camera took this photo and it's unedited.
00:40:58.778 - 00:41:53.088, Speaker B: This is an authentic image for my camera. In order to have that, you're going to need to have a private key embedded in your device. And I expect phones to add this in the next one or two years. But the other version of this is going to be, hey, I made this image in Photoshop with my own amp skills, and this is not produced by stable diffusion or mid journey or whatever, and I need some sort of way to authenticate that as well. In any of these systems, the private key is not that hard conceptually after you have a private key and sign a message, but you need to, when anyone else views that image and looks at your signature, they need to know, based on some sort of public source of truth, that that is you. And that if you try and lie, you try and assert something that's false, there needs to be some sort of public, basically demerit system of sorts, right? That basically kind of like reduces your trust score or whatever. I believe all of that will run over crypto rails.
00:41:53.088 - 00:42:10.880, Speaker B: I think that third one is further out. The GPU stuff is happening today. The RLA Jeff stuff is just now starting to happen, and I think we'll pick up at a pretty new delay. The authentication stuff for deepfakes is a little further out, but almost certainly will happen. Sorry, I know that was a very long answer to the question.
00:42:10.952 - 00:42:29.936, Speaker C: No, no, this is the kind of discussion. This is great. So other than AI, any other, like, what's your take on, like some of the more legacy stuff, like Defi? I remember reaching out to you while I was at Parafi, and you said, look, I just fundamentally think most value is going to accrue to the l one. So we'd rather not touch. Like Defi is interesting, but from an investment standpoint, I'd rather touch the l one.
00:42:30.120 - 00:43:17.044, Speaker D: Look, I'm still excited about DeFi. However, I think you can't put the cart before the horse here. And what we've been doing as an industry is saying that people will use DeFi because of Defi's own properties. And I think that's really hard, because the problem is you have to get your money on chain first, and that has a lot of friction. If you sign up for an account somewhere, you have to transfer some funds in, you have to buy something, then you have to bother to withdraw to your own wallet. And a lot of people are just not going to go through that flow. I would say we've probably tapped out the population set that is willing to go through that flow where they're willing to send money and get it on chain.
00:43:17.044 - 00:44:01.864, Speaker D: I think Defi is exciting. Once there are more wallets that are active that use Defi, not because of some philosophical properties or because they actually fully understand the value prop of it. Most people won't understand the value prop of it, but they'll use it because it's the cheapest, most convenient thing to do. Because otherwise they would have to go through a painful off boarding process to get their money out of crypto. And that is where the friction is. So what does that mean? I think what that means is that for DeFi to take off, we need people to get paid on chain first. They need to get paid.
00:44:01.864 - 00:44:59.214, Speaker D: Things like payroll is the first thing that people think of. But I would put in the proof of physical work, or deep in decentralized physical infrastructure networks into this, where you're driving around for hivemapper and getting paid on chain for doing that, or you're helping build out the helium network, you're getting paid on chain for doing that. Or you're doing this reinforcement learning with human feedback that Kyle was talking about, and you're getting paid on chain for doing that. And now your money is already on chain, and you might as well use an on chain financial service rather than specifically having to go seek it out. So I think DeFi is exciting, but it's like second horizon. I think we need to focus on right now what is going to get more users paid on chain. And once that hits a critical mass, I think that's when Defi starts to get much more interesting.
00:44:59.834 - 00:45:06.954, Speaker C: Do you bucket gaming, and are you excited about that being also a catalyst for people to earn in game?
00:45:06.994 - 00:45:07.706, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:45:07.850 - 00:45:10.974, Speaker C: And then that being the primary onboarding mechanism.
00:45:11.754 - 00:45:46.334, Speaker D: Absolutely. I think gaming can be really big now. You know, we haven't invested in a lot of games, but that's not because we don't think games will work. It's because we doubt our ability to underwrite how fun a game is going to be before seeing the game. And so we don't like to spray and pray. We are high conviction investors. And if we can't build a conviction that this game is going to be fun, how can you underwrite it? It doesn't matter how good the token design is or, you know, the fact that items are nfts or something.
00:45:46.334 - 00:45:47.766, Speaker D: If the game's not fun, the game's.
00:45:47.790 - 00:46:01.354, Speaker C: Not fun, it's not going to work. Yeah, walk us quickly. What your like 1 minute interpretation or how excited you are about base. This is Coinbase l two for anyone sound familiar?
00:46:02.814 - 00:46:57.038, Speaker D: Yeah, it's an interesting experiment. I don't know how exactly they're thinking about the regulatory aspect here with a centralized sequencer. This has been one of my big open questions about L2s. If it's a centralized sequencer and not even a permissionless centralized sequencer, where it's whoever stakes the most, it's just there's this company and they are the centralized sequencer. Well then is this basically from a regulatory perspective, a centralized exchange with extra steps? And so curious to see how that interpretation plays out, I don't know what will happen. I'm excited that Coinbase is trying something innovative and trying to do something new, but the regulatory question here is pretty thorny. I think that applies to more than just base.
00:46:57.038 - 00:47:01.714, Speaker D: I think that applies to the other centralized sequencer, l two s as well.
00:47:02.294 - 00:47:15.434, Speaker A: So would you feel differently about it, Tushar, if they did add, if they did start to decentralize the sequencer? Or like, what's the real hang up there? Is it the business model of l two s or is it about decentralizing the sequencer? Or a little bit of both?
00:47:16.094 - 00:48:11.674, Speaker D: So I'll focus on decentralizing the sequencer. And I'm glad you asked that question. The question is why haven't they decentralized sequencers yet? And it's because it's extraordinarily technically difficult, because as soon as you have leader rotation, now you have to come to consensus again, and now you're back to building an l one. So you face all of the same engineering challenges that you would face when building an l one, as soon as you start to decentralize the sequencer. So I hope that some computer scientists who are way smarter than I am figure out a way to do this stuff. I don't currently see how they're going to be able to decentralize a sequencer without running into the same engineering problems that l one's run into. And then if you're just going to face those same engineering problems, you might as well use an l one that makes those decisions.
00:48:11.674 - 00:48:14.114, Speaker D: Why are you an l two at that point?
00:48:15.054 - 00:48:41.164, Speaker A: Okay, so let's say. So I don't know if you've talked to the espresso team, but there are a bunch of teams working on helping folks decentralize the sequencer. Let's say people figure out how to decentralize the sequencer. What are your thoughts just on l two s in general? And I think I forget if it was Kyle or Tushar. I think one of you guys wrote something about just the broader business model of l two s. Lack of value accrual, lack of fees being generated. What are your broader thoughts on l two s?
00:48:42.984 - 00:49:06.986, Speaker B: Yeah, lots of thoughts here. Lots of thoughts here. Uh, people interpret a lot of my commentary as being super negative l two s. And that's not quite right. It's more negative the evm than it is l two s. It just so happens that almost all l two s are evms. Uh, but, like, the.
00:49:06.986 - 00:49:57.464, Speaker B: The kind of core problem is, like, and I've been saying this for years, is, like, lack of parallel execution. Um, yeah, you can have a bigger single computer on an l two than you can for a Solana validator. Like, sure, instead of spending $3,000 a month on a server, you can send $25,000 a month on a server. But, like, there's a limit to how fast you can execute transactions sequentially. BVM just isn't designed to do parallel execution. And, like, if you look at where most of the gains have come from in silicon in the last 15 years, the substantial majority of gains come from parallelism. And so I just kind of see a fundamental mismatch between the core execution strategy of the EVM and what actually is physics and silicon.
00:49:57.464 - 00:50:26.044, Speaker B: And so a lot of our reason we have barefoot l two s publicly is because it's presented in the context of a way to see all the EVM, but it's really just the EVM. Like, it's not actually anything new. There are exceptions. Things like fuel are intellectually interesting. But most probably, when people talk about l two s, they're not referring to fuel, they're referring to EVM. L two s. And I don't think any of those l two s are actually addressing the scaling problem from first principles.
00:50:26.044 - 00:51:06.534, Speaker B: Whether you have an optimistic roll up or a ZK roll up, you're not actually making the execution of the transactions faster. You are in the absolute most optimistic case, compressing some of the data that ends up on the un one, which can reduce your gas cost percent per transaction. But hundred reducing your gas cost per transaction does not mean necessarily increased TPS. You still need to execute all of the transactions. We actually already have the counterfactual for what happens when you get a big server and you turn up the gas limit on the EVM. That's called BNB chain. We have a real world case study for this and no one at binance even suggests that they can break 500 gps.
00:51:06.534 - 00:51:43.948, Speaker B: And this has been what they've been iterating on for what, three, four years now, whatever it's been. And so I just don't really understand this kind of board premise and I don't think it's going to get you to where you want to be. So I think that's common. Hey, comment b is now not a common on. Um. I just think that if you are in an ecosystem where l two s are the predominant strategy, I believe that means l one's are overvalued and l two s are undervalued. Because at that point all of the MEV is going to the L two.
00:51:43.948 - 00:52:20.864, Speaker B: And that means all of the, basically that dynamic gas execution and also going to all of the l two. And you're basically reducing all of the volatility of commodity demands to the l one token. And that's bad for the value of the l one. And so, you know, like if you believe I'm wrong about Evf, like evml two s are going to be, there's going to be 10,000 evm l two s in the future. And that's going to be the future of scaling. If that's what you really believe, then like, I think the right play is short ETH long, all the l two s because they're going to have a ratio of like.
00:52:21.284 - 00:52:24.344, Speaker A: Yeah, because they become one, basically.
00:52:25.184 - 00:52:50.804, Speaker B: Correct. It's not the l one has zero value, to be clear, but it just means you're taking all of the excess profits that are currently being earned by the l one. The l two s are capturing those profits, basically. And given the size of the current valuation discrepancy between l two s and l one s is roughly on the order of 20 to one. Your margin for arrow in making that assessment is so large, it just seems like a phenomenal relative value trademark.
00:52:52.974 - 00:53:37.624, Speaker C: Kyle, on this .1 of your tweets was fairly controversial, which said that you didn't prioritize security. And it wasn't. Well, well, I mean, if I were to single handedly think of like one of the more reference good .1 of the more like controversial I think was when you tweet, hey, look, security is not as important, and maybe it was taken out of context. I want to dig into that as you think about how people build infrastructure and how you prioritize speed and other criteria over security. So let's dig into that for a moment, because it ties in, I think, into all this l two discussion.
00:53:40.204 - 00:54:28.174, Speaker B: Sure. So the 3d referring to is probably two years old at this point. It's in the conduct of Thor chain, which had a number of hacks above threes or something I can't even remember, but it's been at least a year and a half, maybe two years. I still really stand by the court ethos of what I said, which is basically that security is more important assuming speed is more important than security. There's a couple of caveats around that, the most important part of which is that's not a universally absolutely true statement for all, save at all points in time. The world I live in is predominantly early stage, experimental, high risk things. And I can make the argument that basically everything in crypto is still under that moniker in some form or fashion.
00:54:28.174 - 00:55:15.174, Speaker B: And so my view is like, look, you need to build a thing and get to where you go, move fast and break things. Basically, there is a point at which, for any given asset or any technology, that stops being true. And you need to move to a more conservative methodology around development security practices from where exactly that point in time is, is pretty hard to appreciate ahead of time, and certainly varies depending on the need for the technology, social variables. So I don't want to make any generalized comments across types of protocols or technologies. So don't stop being true at some point in time. And that, pointed out, is different to different assets. But in general, I think people are too afraid of bugs.
00:55:15.174 - 00:55:28.694, Speaker B: Now, I don't mean, look, some people get hurt when there's bugs, and it's unfortunate, but to win, you got to move fast. And I think people dramatically underappreciate the importance of speed.
00:55:30.514 - 00:56:41.074, Speaker D: I want to tie a couple of things together here on the security comment as well as the l two conversation. I've asked a lot of people why they want to use l two s. And they say they want to use l two s because they believe that the l two inherits the security of the l one. This sounds very abstract and theoretical, especially with a centralized sequencer, because how do you actually inherit the security of the l one? Yes, things can't get reorged once the l one has confirmed it, but that's not really the practical thing that most people are worried about. What most people are worried about is censorship. What they're worried about is that my transaction will get blocked, or they're worried that someone will have preferential access to front run your transaction, and that's the kind of security that they're really thinking about. So I think that this perception that an l two inherits the security of the l one is too broad of a perception.
00:56:41.074 - 00:56:59.864, Speaker D: And yes, it does inherit some types of security, primarily double spend attack, but it does not inherit the censorship resistance of the l one. And I think that's a major kind of flaw in the marketing of inheriting security.
00:57:01.284 - 00:57:35.024, Speaker B: Yeah. The other comment I'd say, bill, on that is people say you can withdraw from the l two whenever you want, irrefective of how malicious the sequencer is or whatever. And that's true. But then you're ignoring the reality of, like, well, how long does that take? And, like, what's the opportunity cost of your time? And, like, if you are wanting to make a move and you can't, and you're like, oh, you have to wait 4 hours, or you have to wait a week. Like, there's a good chance not 4 hours of that week is really, really, really costly to you. That could be worth 5%. It could be worth 70%, too.
00:57:35.024 - 00:57:46.644, Speaker B: And, like, it's just like, explicitly ignoring the notion of time or priority or any notion of time sensitivity in these things. And I totally just reject that premise.
00:57:47.464 - 00:57:50.368, Speaker C: If we were to put Solana here.
00:57:50.376 - 00:57:51.168, Speaker D: As well, I mean, there's been a.
00:57:51.176 - 00:58:31.808, Speaker C: Number of restarts in the network, to the point where if you're a DeFi protocol in Solana and this happens, I mean, it could have serious implications in terms of being liquidated. The restart of the network could be problematic. I pushed back too short for me. In that case, I get your point around, like, security can mean many different things for different people, but the reorg, to me, is perhaps the most fundamental of why you want to build anything in the first place. In crypto, like, if there is a risk of a reorg, which all these happen not just across ecosystems, I mean, I think everything is. There's still a lot of infrastructure to be built. But I think that the reorg is.
00:58:31.808 - 00:58:35.814, Speaker C: If you can't solve that, then why even build a crypto in the first place?
00:58:36.794 - 00:58:57.394, Speaker D: Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that you can't solve that. Actually, solving reorgs is one of the easier things. Right? Like, you have faster finality and proof of stake systems, and you see that with basically every proof of stake system out there, whether it's Solana or Algorand or cosmos, et cetera.
00:58:57.434 - 00:58:57.586, Speaker B: Right?
00:58:57.610 - 00:59:30.284, Speaker D: Like, they finalize every block, and now that block is final. So that solves a lot of the double spend problem. For me. Most of the value prop of crypto is not necessarily that it is censorship resistance. It's permissionless access. It's that anyone can show up and start using it without having to talk to some centralized sequencer and hope that they're treated fairly. It's also that anyone can start validating the chain without hoping that, you know, oh, I hope I'm allowed to.
00:59:30.284 - 00:59:31.760, Speaker D: Right.
00:59:31.952 - 00:59:32.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:32.312 - 00:59:52.284, Speaker C: On that point, I mean, there's two things that come to mind. One is, how easy is it for someone to spin up a validator, right? And obviously, Solana has the hardware requirements has been kind of a criticism. Right. The hardware requirements are more export expensive. It's more difficult than in ethereum, but. So that's one. The other one is just on a nation state level, kind of on a regulatory front.
00:59:52.284 - 01:00:11.284, Speaker C: What are your thoughts around censorship at that level where it can be problematic if you're in a particular jurisdiction? I mean, China's always been the place where it's difficult, but as the regulatory environment evolves, it could be difficult in places even like in the US. So how do you think about censorship in that context?
01:00:13.384 - 01:00:46.264, Speaker D: I think the comparison of ETH, l one to Solana l one validator costs is not necessarily the best comparison, because the vision for ETH is to have the transactions going through l two s. So the question is, how much does it cost to spin up a l two validator node for one of these roll ups? Oh, wait, it's actually infinite. You're not allowed. You are not permitted to do this. And if you were, it costs more. I would bet. I don't have the numbers in front of me because this is all private company information.
01:00:46.264 - 01:01:01.994, Speaker D: I don't know how much these centralized sequencers spend on their server costs. They don't reveal this stuff, but I would bet with pretty high conviction that it costs more than running a salon validator. So I just don't know that I buy that comparison.
01:01:03.894 - 01:01:10.354, Speaker A: To short and call. Do you guys have allocation to ETH, just like ETH, the asset? Not, not the ecosystem, but just ETH?
01:01:10.734 - 01:01:11.754, Speaker B: We do, yes.
01:01:12.374 - 01:01:16.494, Speaker A: What's the percentage breakdown of, like, ETH to soul?
01:01:17.874 - 01:01:23.614, Speaker D: We don't talk about relative position sizing and actively traded things publicly.
01:01:23.954 - 01:01:32.450, Speaker B: Fair enough. There's more soul than there is ETH, but we're not going to get it. We're not going to get into whether it's two to one or ten to one or whatever.
01:01:32.602 - 01:01:59.664, Speaker A: Fair. Okay. All right, so I'm looking through some of these topics that junior put together, and just like, some things that might be interesting to talk about, and one of them that I found pretty surprising was, I don't know if one of you guys wrote this or junior wrote this, but filecoin emerges as a meaningful ecosystem on par with ETH and Solana in terms of legitimacy. I would say that is thrown in the bold take department. So, yeah, I definitely need one of you guys to expand on that.
01:02:01.324 - 01:02:43.684, Speaker B: I guess I run with this one. I've hated Filecoin for a really long time. Uh, and I've done a 180 in the last six months. Uh, my, my primary reason, I mean, a few things coming together. Um, one is after blockchain launches, my general observation is going to take one to two years of blockchain to, like, become legitimate and do, do what it's going to do. And conversely, if it doesn't become legitimate over the course of that one to two years, it typically falls into irrelevance and kind of dies. It doesn't necessarily mean that it stops producing blocks, but it falls out of public purview and consciousness.
01:02:43.684 - 01:03:25.914, Speaker B: Filecoin is two and a half years old now, so it kind of just passed that threshold. And so I used the opportunity in September, October, November last year to start kind of diving into the filecoin ecosystem at the two year mark, and was pretty pleasantly surprised at, like, it was very clear that the rate of intellectual capital contributing was increasing. So that's comet a. Comment B is the Filepoi virtual machine launch. And this is probably the most important thing. The Filecoin virtual machine launched a month ago on PI day, so March 14, and the file coin virtual machine is the EVM on Filecoin. That does not mean, like, I mean, maybe there's going to be Defi on Filecoin.
01:03:25.914 - 01:04:05.442, Speaker B: I don't know if that's going to become a thing or not. That's not the right interpretation of it, though. The right interpretation of it is you will be able to pre program payments using EVN and also suit other vms as well, hopefully versus VM. And those will be able to connect to file point native findings for the three major primitives in Filepoin, which are storage, retrieval and bandwidth and compute. And you'll be able to pre program those image, which means you can do things like kermit and storage. That means you can have payments for retrieval markets. That means you can do conditional payments for specific types of compute workloads.
01:04:05.442 - 01:04:48.194, Speaker B: But basically it makes filecoin programmable in the same way that bitcoin wasn't programmable. And then ETH made bitcoin programmable, not literally the bitcoin asset, but gave you a programmable asset ledger. We are now introducing the notion of programmable payments onto generalized compute operations for the three basic primitives computation. And that's a really big vision. And so the BFBM is kind of thing number two, and then I think number three is retrieval markets went live. Firecoin's native retrieval markets called Saturn in launched in January of this year. Very quietly, I think there's roughly 1000 nodes on it right now.
01:04:48.194 - 01:05:17.410, Speaker B: Today, payments are not enabled on Saturn. So for now it's all still in kind of like play money test mode. It's real data, but play money. But obviously at some point they're going to turn on payments and get this thing going. And I'm very excited for the vision of the decentralized CDN. It's been like one of the sexiest North Star visions of crypto for a very long time, and we're finally getting closer to that. I think as that comes closer to becoming reality, we're going to see a lot of really amazing things built on top of it.
01:05:17.410 - 01:05:27.986, Speaker B: So that kind of culmination of things has gotten me very excited about Filecoin. Those are all very direct filecoin. Comments Kyle, do you see just one.
01:05:28.010 - 01:06:17.964, Speaker A: Question on that is like, I remember the 2019 Multicoin event, Multicoin Summit in New York. I forget his name, the Arweave founder. Sam yeah, red pilled me on Arweave, got pretty excited about Arweave, and it seems like some cool stuff has been happening with Arweave recently. How do you think about like file? I mean, they're both decentralized storage networks, but my understanding is like, Filecoin has proof of replication and proof of space time. Arweave has like proof of access, I think they call it. They have different economic models, maybe different target use cases like Filecoin seems more like almost b two b like large amounts of data, like archives backups, arweaves more like social media posts and like web pages, which is maybe a little more b, two C. How do you think about the difference between Arweave and Filecoin?
01:06:21.184 - 01:07:01.064, Speaker B: The primary reason we got a tale of Arweave back in 2019 was its simplicity. At the time, file literally didn't exist. And we understood even back then that file coin was going to be a fairly complex animal when it did launch. What we liked about Arweave was pay once, throw it in the sky, it gets stored forever, and you don't really have to think any more than that. And there was a real value to that simplicity. And that's when it was fairly not popular at the time, although I think a lot of people came around to appreciate the importance of that over the next call. 24 months.
01:07:01.064 - 01:07:17.504, Speaker B: A lot's happened, though. That's been four years since we. Yeah, it's been four years since we won our first Arweave tokens. I think we let them May 2019. So it's been a while. And at that time, the file compared ecosystem has matured. It's got a lot more usable.
01:07:17.504 - 01:07:56.580, Speaker B: Today I look at these things today. I look at Fileplight as basically being a superset of arweave. Using the FVM, you can build a permanent storage system that is functionally offering the same type of guarantee as Arweave. What's nice about the FVM is you can parameterize it in ways that you can't parameterize Rweve. Rweave isn't really parameterizable. There's one parameter which is pay for a file, and then however many people replicate it. Because of like the crypto economics of the Arweave, proof of access gain is how many replicas there are, and there's no notion of measurement or concreteness.
01:07:56.580 - 01:08:30.618, Speaker B: It's all probabilistic. As is one way to parameterize permanent storage. Filepoint gives you infinite more optionality via FDM, where you can say, hey, I want five copies of this, I want 25 copies of this, I want three copies. And each confidence you can parameterize how you want it to be stored in any way. And because you have proofs of replication, you can enforce the different parameters in the system. So I want to add that optionality creates more complexity. Complexity in terms of like, you have more decisions to make as a developer.
01:08:30.618 - 01:08:49.094, Speaker B: On the other hand, saying there's one permanent source configuration for everyone in the world actually is not right to me. I think you need to be able to parameterize these things. And so I look at them as they will coexist for a long time. But the filecoin definitely is vastly more configurable than Arwave is.
01:08:50.114 - 01:09:18.910, Speaker C: Yeah. Guys, last topic I want to touch on is bitcoin. You talk about stuff that you've change your mind on. This is something that I was, I've changed my mind on recently and paid more attention. We have monev on talking about, you know, changes, pretty fundamental changes in bitcoin ethos, at least to explore, you know, define bitcoin and other kind of propositions. So I'm curious if you guys internally have paid attention to that. That's something that, you know, you get excited about.
01:09:18.910 - 01:09:23.234, Speaker C: You're investing in the bitcoin ecosystem or just increase your allocation of bitcoin.
01:09:26.634 - 01:09:29.534, Speaker D: We do own some bitcoin, but.
01:09:31.434 - 01:09:31.722, Speaker B: I.
01:09:31.738 - 01:10:19.754, Speaker D: Would say that the benefits that bitcoin has are potentially shared by other l one assets as they become more mature. The key thing that bitcoin has is it has a big head start. It's been around for a while. I remember in 2020, I was talking to a bunch of traditional investors, the Wall street types, and the perception then was that, yes, traditional investors will come into crypto, but it's going to be bitcoin only. They're really only looking at bitcoin. They like the digital gold thesis because they understand that. And that's really it.
01:10:19.754 - 01:11:18.874, Speaker D: Then something really big happened in 2021, which is we saw that those big institutional allocators said bitcoin and ETH. And now everywhere that you go look at bitcoin, it's bitcoin and ETH, basically any portfolio, any institutional investor, right, like ETH, has caught up with bitcoin in a meaningful sense, in terms of liquidity, in terms of recognition, and in terms of a perception of neutrality, yes, it's not as neutral as bitcoin is. Vitalik didn't disappear like Satoshi did. They still do hard forks and stuff. But the perception of it is bitcoin and ETH. On similar footing, ETH is, what, five, six years behind bitcoin. So when you play that out, right, like right now, you can say bitcoin has been around twice as long as ETH.
01:11:18.874 - 01:11:22.782, Speaker D: A decade from now, you can't say that anymore.
01:11:22.838 - 01:11:23.054, Speaker B: Right?
01:11:23.094 - 01:12:15.404, Speaker D: Bitcoin was around five years longer, but both things have been around 15 years and 20 years. So I think things change over time, and now I'll expand that. I don't think ETH is the last one to get into that club of bitcoin and ETH. I think that the most used smart contract platform will get into that club and it will become neutral over time or perceived as more neutral, especially as hard forks slow down or stop as the tech ossifies and it'll have more users, which ultimately, I think is the thing that matters the most, is having more users, getting more people paid on chain. Like I was talking about earlier, you're not going to see that on bitcoin. You're not going to see more and more people get paid on chain bitcoin. That's extremely unlikely.
01:12:15.404 - 01:12:47.744, Speaker D: But you will see that hopefully on Solana or hopefully on Ethereum or another smart contract platform that does more useful stuff. Yeah, I think Bitcoin has its moment right now with inflation looking like it's sticky and a whole bunch of macro things that I do not consider myself an expert on, but I think that it's not as uniquely positioned to capture those tailwinds as some might like to believe.
01:12:49.004 - 01:13:09.724, Speaker C: Yeah, fair enough. I want to end this just with a question that I had. Ben, my former partner, parafy here last week, and I asked him this question, and I'd like for you guys to also answer this is, what would you tell a younger version of Kyle and Tushar entering the space today that you wish you knew? Kind of in however so many years you've been in the space.
01:13:11.264 - 01:13:19.964, Speaker B: Follow your heart, man. Like, don't get caught up in the drama and the pressure of crypto Twitter.
01:13:22.264 - 01:13:27.944, Speaker C: It's funny you say that cause Ben, I'm sure he has an alt account, but he doesn't have a Twitter profile.
01:13:28.924 - 01:13:50.184, Speaker D: I would say your job is to earn excess returns, and the only way to do that is be contrarian and be right. And that requires bravery. Like, you need to be willing to be wrong in order to be able to be contrarian and right. So don't be afraid to be wrong in public.
01:13:50.964 - 01:14:11.972, Speaker C: Well, I think that's a good way to end it. Guys, thanks for coming on. I think it's been a while and it's great to hear from you guys. So appreciate it, the takes and you guys answering some of the harder questions. We'll certainly have to have you on later on in the year as things progress, but otherwise, really appreciate the time and, yeah, thanks for coming on.
01:14:12.108 - 01:14:13.024, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:14:13.404 - 01:14:14.564, Speaker B: Appreciate you having us talk, guys.
