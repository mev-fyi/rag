00:00:00.480 - 00:00:29.800, Speaker A: You can make a lot of money participating in token sales, right? I feel like there's always that mean people share of, like, coinless returns from ICO to present. And it's like, hey, Gary Gensler, thanks for protecting me from like the 500 x that I missed on salon. You think about turning $1,000 into half a million dollars, like you could have in the Solana Ico. That's like life changing. And you think about why people participate in risk on markets. They're here to make money generally, right? It's like the meme. Like maybe some people are here for the tech, but like, these are financial markets.
00:00:29.800 - 00:00:32.300, Speaker A: You are here to turn a dollar into more dollars.
00:00:32.800 - 00:01:13.050, Speaker B: Everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of Empire Marinade. Marinade is a staking protocol on Solana and the only stake pool that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards and automatic downside protection with their new protected staking rewards. Optimize your sole stake with Marinade by hitting the link in the show notes. Big thanks to Marinade. We'll talk more about them later in the show. This episode is brought to you by Avalanche. Avalanche is a leading network of blockchains giving some of the world's largest financial institutions new use cases and business models while leveraging completely customizable infrastructure.
00:01:13.050 - 00:01:42.636, Speaker B: Check them out. It's core app Discover. You can explore Avalanche's subnet ecosystem at core app Discover I was playing around earlier today. Really cool. This episode is brought to you by Mantle. Mantle is an l two backed by over a $4 billion treasury, obviously one of the largest in the industry. They recently launched their airdrop program called the Reward station to distribute both presale token allocations or listed tokens to MNT holders who stake their MNT.
00:01:42.636 - 00:02:04.452, Speaker B: Mantle has nailed their rewards program recently. Would highly encourage folks to check out the Mantle rewards program at Mantle XYZ Rewards. All right, everyone back with another epsanti couldn't join us, so we got Regan and Mike from lattice fund, two co founders of Lattice Fund. Welcome to the show, guys.
00:02:04.636 - 00:02:05.428, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:02:05.564 - 00:02:06.668, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:02:06.804 - 00:02:11.720, Speaker B: Yeah, lattice fund. Why didn't I know lattice fund until recently?
00:02:12.060 - 00:02:30.810, Speaker C: It's a good question considering marketing was a key priority this year. Probably makes sense that you wouldn't have known us. We're relatively new. So in terms of crypto funds out there still emerging that regard. But definitely, I think making a name for ourselves.
00:02:31.830 - 00:02:55.566, Speaker A: I think a lot of the investments we did for our first fund, which we raised in summer of 21. We were generally writing $250 to $500,000 checks. And so those are kind of like most of the companies that have graduated a series a b token launch. And we always joke, you know, we're kind of like in like the, oh, it's Andreessen, like, and others. And like, you're in that? Yeah, we're off.
00:02:55.598 - 00:02:59.886, Speaker B: They do that with angel, too. I'm like, you know, I wrote an angel check, and they're like, and some.
00:02:59.918 - 00:03:07.486, Speaker A: Other people like, ah, yeah, I gave you $10,000. You can't, you know, you can't even give me credit for it, so.
00:03:07.638 - 00:03:53.140, Speaker B: Well, guys, I want to have you on to talk market structure. So you both spend time at coinless before lattice. You are two of the smartest people, I think, when it comes to what are the underlying structural issues that have made this cycle feel weird? I think everyone can agree this cycle just feels a little off. And I wanted to talk about the structural issues, whether it's low flow to high ftv or token distributions and sales or whatever it may be. I want to talk about some of those structural issues on the pod. But maybe before we do that, Reagan, I could throw it to you to kick us off. Like, what is your high level, like, almost market meta? Like, you had this tweet thread of, why is everyone so miserable? Why is this cycle cooked? Like, what's going on with the cycle so far?
00:03:54.440 - 00:04:41.274, Speaker A: So I think that, taking a step back, I think the biggest difference in this cycle versus prior ones is it's very macro top down driven versus some novel crypto native innovation coming out, and that kind of being the driver of markethood movement. So you had the bitcoin ETF in what, like earlier this year, you now have the ETF one. You kind of have these macro inflows without really having something that new. Now, I think we have meme coins, and thats kind of been like the meta of the day. I think if you look at the data, meme coins are not really whats driving the market, volume wise, at least. Its just like, its a weird cycle. I think because of that, its just very different from how things were.
00:04:41.274 - 00:04:54.890, Speaker A: For example, I think you went to a conference in 2020. Well, I guess we didnt have conferences then. It was Covid. But you talked to someone in 2020. Youre like, oh, what are you excited about? Its like, oh, its defi. Theres all these new yield farms. Theres all of this innovation.
00:04:54.890 - 00:05:23.780, Speaker A: There were even new token launch mechanisms like yearn. Theres something to be excited about. Mike and I were at consensus two or three weeks ago. The vibe I left describing as was, like, abstract optimism. It's like, yes, my bags are worth more than they were six months ago, so I am happy, but, like, there's not really. There hasn't really been, like, a super new thing to get excited about. So I think that's just different than prior cycles.
00:05:23.780 - 00:05:51.920, Speaker A: And I think the other big difference is that the things that have pumped kind of besides soul have not really been VC coins. Nbcs tend to be the loudest people on crypto Twitter. Right? Like, how many people are going into, like, January where, like, overweight bitcoin and meme coins, maybe like, Joe McCann, but, like, very few venture capitalists. And so I think that's partially why the kind of, like, crypto thought mafia has been a little bit grumpy.
00:05:52.080 - 00:06:22.316, Speaker B: Hmm. How much of this comes from, like, application versus infrastructure, do you think? Or is it due to other things? And maybe the context there is, like, I remember in Defi summer, you could actually play, like, there were yams and there's sushi and there's uni and, like. And then a year later, you had, like. And so those were things you could do. Like, you could go play, you could put your money in and you could click the crappy little Uis. But it was like a fun game we were all playing, and it really did feel like a game. And then a year later, you had nfts, right, where, like, again, it was a game.
00:06:22.316 - 00:06:30.080, Speaker B: You're all buying these things and taking photos of them and putting them online. Like, how much of this is related to that versus something like a deeper problem.
00:06:31.340 - 00:07:26.332, Speaker C: Yeah, we talk about this a lot, and this is, I think, at the retail and institutional level. So if you're going out to institutional and you're like, well, it's a pension fund or an endowment, and they're asking, what's new in crypto? It's hard to communicate to them something like Eigen layer and why that's important, why they should care about it. Similarly for retail, if they're brand new to crypto and trying to introduce something like Eigen layer and shared security, nothing. Something that's probably going to capture their imagination, at least. Maybe they've, like, studied game theory in some capacity or computer science, whereas at the application level, those are always the things that pull in retail in some capacity. And even going back to 2017, 2018, with some of the icos, it was, like, more application oriented, even if it was infrastructure, like something like Filecoin was like, oh, like file storage on the web. Anyone could intuitively grasp that.
00:07:26.332 - 00:07:38.520, Speaker C: Whereas now at the infrastructure level, those aren't things that probably retail or institutional can immediately, you know, grasp onto and say, okay, this is why I want to start investing or buying these things.
00:07:39.820 - 00:07:45.668, Speaker B: Let's talk retail for a sec. So, Reagan, oh my God, I'm going to keep botching your name in this podcast.
00:07:45.804 - 00:07:47.708, Speaker A: I've been called Reagan since I was a kid.
00:07:47.764 - 00:08:13.102, Speaker B: Like, I actually fun little sport for folks. The way that, the way that we got connected is I mentioned a tweet thread that Regan had put out and I completely botched your name about four different times in the podcast. And you said thanks. You dm me said something along the lines of thanks for the mention, but royally botching my name. So I'm glad to be called out on it. So you had one of your threads. You've had some really good threads.
00:08:13.102 - 00:08:33.384, Speaker B: Your twitter's blown up recently, which is cool to see. You talked about how retail cannot make any money anymore. And I think maybe let's go there as it's a good kind of start to kind of get into this rabbit hole of the bigger structural issues. So why can't retail make money anymore? So outside of meme coins, I guess I'd say.
00:08:33.432 - 00:08:55.760, Speaker A: I was going to say because I said that. And then like, all these people were like, dude, you're an idiot. Like, I made, I made a bunch of money on meme coins. So I want to be clear. I'm just talking about the like traditional VC coin side of the market. Clearly you can 100 x things in meme coins, which I think wise is at least why some of the attention has moved there. Mike and I worked together for four years before we started lattice at coinlist.
00:08:55.760 - 00:09:29.960, Speaker A: We were around all of these token launches from Filecoin to Nier to Solana. And I think weve seen the data firsthand and also just talk to users who participated in these sales. You can make a lot of money participating in token sales. I feel like theres always that meme people share of coinless returns from ICO to present. And its like, hey, Gary Gensler, thanks for protecting me from the 500 x that I missed on salon. But you think about turning $1,000 into half a million dollars, like you could have in the Solana Ico. Thats life changing money.
00:09:29.960 - 00:09:59.900, Speaker A: And you think about why people participate in risk on markets. Theyre here to make money generally, right? Its like the meme. Maybe some people are here for the tech, but these are financial markets, you are here to turn a dollar into more dollars. And so crypto was really well set up for that. Right. But that meta has kind of shifted in a few ways. One is these things tend to go out at higher ftvs than they did previously, and the market has grown.
00:09:59.900 - 00:10:44.104, Speaker A: So maybe that's justified to some extent, but I think that is an important distinction. And the second is generally, these projects are not selling tokens to the public pre launch, at launch at all, really. Instead, you have this gamified points airdrop game with Eigen layer. Using that as an example, because it was the most hyped up airdrop style token launch, you basically could maybe double your notional value of ETH into eigenpoints. But that's over a long time. And turning $1,000 of ETH into 2000 is a very, very different thing than turning $1,000 of ETH into 500,000. Right.
00:10:44.104 - 00:11:01.320, Speaker A: You could double your money on Robinhood. Right. Just like, go buy Nvidia. And I think, like, crypto, where it had an edge amongst retail traders, it's kind of lost that a little bit. Right. Because we've kind of, like, kneecapped the upside for retail participants. Now, the place where that's not true is meme coins.
00:11:01.320 - 00:11:02.020, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:02.560 - 00:11:10.456, Speaker B: How have we kneecapped the. Say more about how we kneecapped the upside? By going public later, essentially by going.
00:11:10.488 - 00:11:40.082, Speaker A: Public later at higher valuations, and not giving retail any way to buy in besides these airdrops, where you basically are kind of just like, waiting on the Eigen team to decide what you get. Right. It's like the upside is kind of fundamentally capped just because of the way these points are calculated. Right. What's the max you really could make on Eigen? Maybe if Eigen is 100 billion, people are ten xing the eth they put in. But that's like a wildly bullish outcome, right?
00:11:40.106 - 00:11:42.298, Speaker B: That's all in history. Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:42.354 - 00:12:15.020, Speaker A: Retail participants are probably getting 50% to, like, 250% yield on the ETH they locked for six months. It's just a very different game than participating in icos. And so I think there's valid reasons we've moved toward this. Right. The regulatory regime has gotten harsher, but we clearly have, like, just significantly capped the upside that retail can make in these markets besides meme coins. And so I think that's partially why, like, the meta has kind of shifted to that segment of the market.
00:12:15.180 - 00:12:52.668, Speaker B: Hmm. Yeah. There's the good cobe piece that I'm sure a lot of people read, which is like just compares kind of the, it compares four assets, Ethereum versus Solana versus optimism, op and Starkware, right? Looking at the different multiples that you would have made if you could have invested, comparing the seed round versus investing when it went public, something like Ethereum. When it went public, the ICO returns were only one and a half x those available on the market. When it went public, Solana was ten times higher and seed Op was 30 times higher. Stark was 138 times higher. If you bought in the public markets for Starkware, I haven't looked at the chart recently, but you're either flat or down.
00:12:52.668 - 00:13:24.380, Speaker B: So, Mike, what do you think about, I mean, like the, so I think Regan is saying like, okay, we go public, like, putting quotes around, like, public crypto, public later and later at higher and higher valuations, but that's no different than how the traditional capital markets work, right? Sees B series, C, D, E, whatever, then you IPO, and it's not like there's this, like retail then buys it at the IPO and they're excited and number goes up.
00:13:25.000 - 00:14:17.864, Speaker C: Retail holders of stocks are certainly different breed than retail holders of certain tokens. And I think that's going to be one of the most interesting things to see how that plays out over time with some of the more recent token launches. Because in these bear markets, the people that stick around are the people that made money, or they tend to be. So, for instance, if you were in, let's say you participated in the Solana Ico, or you were able to buy Solana sub dollar for multiple months in the prior cycle, even if you held all the way down to dollar eight, dollar nine, you're still up meaningfully, and you've probably made some life changing money. And you saw it, you saw it in your wallet. And those are the people through the summer when everyone was like, Solana's dead. They're like, well, I'm still up almost ten x, I'm going to stick around, keep building, I'm keep contributing, and like, there's this.
00:14:17.864 - 00:14:57.162, Speaker C: Not like no one else is probably gonna have that experience for a token that's launched in this cycle where, listen, I've made a lot of money, or I've seen a lot of money on screen, I'm gonna be here for a while. And if you look at in the past cycle going back to 2017, so you have things like chain link, like people could participate in the ICO, it went all the way down, it was totally dead in 2019. But I think that's where you get the loyalists in your community that stick around. And I don't think. I don't, I don't. I don't see that type of behavior from a retail community around. Most of the projects that are emerging at this point in time, it's like.
00:14:57.186 - 00:15:17.282, Speaker A: Everyone'S mad about not getting enough free money. Right? Like, it's. It's just like, you know, I feel like every. Like all these crypto people hate government handouts. And you'll think, oh, yeah, you just become, like, reliant on the state, and then you look at the exact same dynamics happening in the crypto market. Right? Like, Eigenlager could have given everyone double the Eigen tokens and people still would have been mapped.
00:15:17.346 - 00:15:17.882, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:18.026 - 00:15:21.914, Speaker A: It's just like an obviously bad paradigm to launch these things.
00:15:22.082 - 00:15:27.290, Speaker B: Yeah. What did you mean when you said we've moved from an uncapped upside market to a capped one?
00:15:27.450 - 00:15:34.634, Speaker A: The FTV these projects are launching at is higher. And so, like, you're getting a notional value of tokens that's tied to a higher FTV.
00:15:34.722 - 00:15:41.690, Speaker B: You're saying it's capped in that it's just too high. Like, Eigen going live at a hundred billion is just too high for number to keep going up.
00:15:42.110 - 00:15:54.690, Speaker A: Yes. And you're also just reliant on what the team gives you. Right. Which is never going to be like ten x the ETH you put in. It's just not how these things work. Right. It's like you get some yield on your eth.
00:15:54.690 - 00:16:06.430, Speaker A: In Eigens case, let's just say it was 100%. But you're never going to get 500 x on an airdrop the same way that you are with a son ICO. It's just not how these markets work.
00:16:06.550 - 00:16:16.174, Speaker B: Well, you're never really getting a 500 x on an air like that. Wasn't an airdrop like an ICO was. Icos are different than an airdrop. In my mind, Ico is like 100%.
00:16:16.222 - 00:16:19.134, Speaker A: But I'm saying we've replaced icos with airdrops.
00:16:19.262 - 00:16:20.118, Speaker B: I see. Yeah.
00:16:20.174 - 00:16:28.290, Speaker A: And they're not even really airdrops because you are giving something. Right? You are risking your eth for six months, let's say.
00:16:29.310 - 00:16:53.900, Speaker B: How do you solve this, though, if the. Like, this does feel like, I'll try to play devil's advocate. As the industry gets bigger and people make more money and there's more success stories, like more dollars come into the industry, lP's want to put more capital into the industry, more venture funds are started. Venture fund. Like you could say this is the fault of the extreme amount of venture dollars that are sloshing around in the industry.
00:16:54.060 - 00:17:01.444, Speaker C: We are definitely contributors to this problem. We're not going to deny that.
00:17:01.492 - 00:17:08.014, Speaker B: But I actually wouldn't say it's your. I wouldn't say it's the funds like this. It's the. There are a few. The late stage mega funds.
00:17:08.062 - 00:17:31.086, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it is interesting because we had this beautiful system which was anyone globally could participate in meaningful upside from this new technology. And what we did is said, no, let's actually not do that. Let's go to another system, which you already have, which is we have these gatekeepers and those are the people that can capture the upside for LP's.
00:17:31.158 - 00:17:31.730, Speaker A: And.
00:17:32.460 - 00:17:54.356, Speaker C: But look at. We're just going to keep using the Eigen layer example. They had that round with Andreessen a few months ago where they raised $100 million. The question is, why couldn't they have done that as a token sale? They could have gotten everyone in at that same valuation. They would have no trouble raising $100 million from retail. But they chose to go with one investor. Now, I'm not going to blame them.
00:17:54.356 - 00:18:25.386, Speaker C: There's a lot of regulatory risk here. And that's what we've all been talking about for as long as I've been in this industry, is the regulatory risk. But if there was a fix, it feels like maybe that would be the fix that for these growth stage opportunities, getting retail involved and giving them a meaningful participation opportunity, where would be one way to address how does retail get access to the same types of opportunities that some of the large funds do?
00:18:25.528 - 00:18:27.410, Speaker B: Why did Eigen layer just do that?
00:18:28.310 - 00:18:29.726, Speaker C: Talk to Sriram.
00:18:29.918 - 00:18:30.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:30.310 - 00:19:10.042, Speaker A: Look, if you just have a deal with Andreessen versus 100,000 token holders with Reddit accounts, that can complain about your roadmap and all that, it is logistically easier. But maybe that's also part of why we did have this beautiful system that Mike talked about is there was just a limited amount of venture dollars. And this is the point Kobe makes. It's like you look at how much Solana near Avax, these teams raised, pre launched, maybe $30 million max. Why does new l one need $250 million? You're building open source software. It's a protocol. It makes absolutely no sense to me.
00:19:10.042 - 00:19:45.904, Speaker A: And that comes at the expense of retail holders. Because there's a limited amount of alpha in this market. And every time you raise the floor on the FTV at launch, you're taking away some of that alpha from retail participants. And so it's not like, this is a silver bullet. But I think generally these teams launching earlier, launching at lower valuations that reflect that progress and raising less money pre launch, not setting a super high floor on like launch fDv, these things tend to give the community more upside in what you're doing.
00:19:46.032 - 00:20:24.958, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you guys handle that though, at lattice? Because like, if I'm trying to, I've never been in the, in the VC's seat here, like allocating this capital like you guys are, but if I'm in your guys shoes, I'm like, okay, let's look at Monad. So like, Monad comes around and they raise it like two, or what do they do? They did the Kol round at 600 and then they did the venture raise at two or 3 billion. And you're like, yeah, that's a lot of money. But also it's probably going to ten x because it's going to go public. I don't know the word for that. Tokens going to TGE is going to happen at 20 or 30, or maybe Eigen layers happened at 100.
00:20:24.958 - 00:20:45.006, Speaker B: So now that pulls Monad up to like 50, or maybe it's even more than that. So then that's like a 20 x. And then your investors are like, hey Mike, you had the opportunity to do this 20 x in like 18 months and you didn't take it. Like, why didn't you do that? And you're like, oh, high FTV. And they're like, I don't give a damn, like 20 x in 18 months. So how do you handle this in your shoes?
00:20:45.158 - 00:21:32.540, Speaker C: Yeah, there's another thing to account for, which is these tokens come out at 50 50 billion, let's say. But by the time investors like us actually see those tokens or can realize some of that value, it's several years from now. So the question is like, if you're coming out and you're coming out of 50 billion, like, who's the next buyer? And that's something we haven't really talked about. Historically, it has been retail is the next buyer for some of these new tokens. There aren't mutual funds that are going in buying Monad necessarily. They won't be for several years. You should either have maybe some liquid funds or some venture funds that put into liquids, but there isn't a really large institutional buyer base for mid to longer tail tokens that are coming out at a billion to 20 billion.
00:21:32.540 - 00:21:54.300, Speaker C: The question is if that's a down only chart several years from now, when Regan and I go into claim our tokens, how much of this actually going to be worth? So it's good for Marx and going out and raising funds, but actually delivering returns to investors, not always there. So just something that we're always accounting for.
00:21:54.720 - 00:22:42.134, Speaker A: I think we haven't really talked about that as much, but I think to answer your question a different way, one of our theses when we started the fund, is that there was just a gap of capital for day one founders. Most really good managers in the 21 cycle sized up to multi hundred million dollar funds, where their minimum check size was like $3 million. And our view is that two founders in a room with an idea who wanted to raise, whatever, half a million to $2 million at launch. That was actually the least crowded part of the market. And there is a lot of money for these pre TGE rounds, these series, as are really competitive. And you see this with Eigen, Lair and Babylon in these large rounds. But we've chosen intentionally not to play at that part of the market.
00:22:42.134 - 00:22:55.640, Speaker A: We want to work with founders on day one. Our last fund was $65 million. And I think the strategy reflects that. How many managers can you name off the top of your head who have less than $100 million funds? Probably not that many.
00:22:55.940 - 00:23:06.080, Speaker B: Well, what happens, though, when you guys are successful with fun? Two. And then you go out to raise and you're like, nice. I take two and 20. Why wouldn't I just go raise more money?
00:23:08.060 - 00:23:27.060, Speaker A: I mean, that. That's it. You know, that's a fair question. And that's, like, often what has happened in venture, but it hasn't always been the case. Like, there's a guy named, I think his name is Steve Anderson. He runs a fund called Baseline. And he was like a day one investor in Snapchat and all these ridiculous successful companies.
00:23:27.060 - 00:23:36.824, Speaker A: He keeps these funds, $50 million. He's ten x to almost all of them. And he just has a strategy and he sticks to it. He hasn't scaled the team. He can.
00:23:36.952 - 00:23:44.568, Speaker B: Or Bill Gurley, right, is a different example. Just stick at 350 or 300 or whatever it is.
00:23:44.744 - 00:24:02.160, Speaker A: And everyone who's been there is probably ridiculously right, because, like, you can clearly do well if you have a strategy and stick to it. So, I don't know. We, you know, our team's four people. Like, we like working with founders. We like keeping things small. It works for us.
00:24:02.580 - 00:24:18.860, Speaker B: What are the biggest things that founders who are thinking about, who are launching tokens? What are they thinking about right now? Like, when they come to you guys, you're like, they're like, hey, you guys worked at coinless. Like we're launching this token in the next twelve months. Like, like help me. What goes on in those conversations?
00:24:19.680 - 00:25:30.370, Speaker C: It is interesting because I, maybe it's only because of Regan's recent tweets, but everyone, all founders seem to be looking for an alternative solution, meaning they want something different. They don't just want to do an airdrop, they don't want to do a high FTV, low flow token. But it doesn't seem like anyone really has a good answer or solution for this right now in terms of what founders have the most questions about it still seems to be legal, which is pretty tragic. If the problem that's top of mind for most founders is how do I do this and stay out of jail? We failed collectively as a country, but that's still what they come to talk to us about the most is how do I do this? How do I set up the right offshore entity? Do I have to move to a new country in order to, you know, be safe? But beyond that, like right now, like it still continues even though it's maybe not preferred, the tactic around using airdrops, how to do it is still here. And I think until we get some more regulatory clarity that's going to be the case, even if the desire is there to do something different.
00:25:31.870 - 00:25:50.830, Speaker B: So let's get into some of these structural issues a little more like one of the things you guys, I've seen you guys write about is like so we're talking about massive raises for l one s and l two s. That leads to these multibillion dollar valuations pre launched. That does what? Two things right, that you're saying a lot of sell side pressure creates a floor on the launch FTV.
00:25:52.050 - 00:25:52.882, Speaker A: Yes.
00:25:53.066 - 00:26:04.310, Speaker B: Yeah. Solution in your mind to that is anything or this is going to keep happening. And if you're an investor, be a little smarter when picking tokens.
00:26:06.850 - 00:27:08.050, Speaker A: Well look, I think embedded in every single venture investment ever made in this industry is a belief that the industry just grows from here. So I think we kind of are all just hoping that more participants come in, more liquid funds get raised, the industry just keeps growing and everyone is kind of happy and that'd be awesome, I would be happy with that. But I think right now a lot of the problems are really just a structural imbalance of flows, right? You had a lot of money go in in the 21 cycle and that money needs to be paid back at some point. I think theres been a lot of talk about all these new tokens launching the cycle. I actually think the flows there you cant really see because investors are generally still locked. But you look at the tokens that launched over a year ago and whats happening with them right now. And clearly regardless of what these teams do, arbitrum is a good example.
00:27:08.050 - 00:27:36.080, Speaker A: They are executing. Everything is going right from a strategic perspective. But you have a billion dollars of tokens hitting the market every month. And you look at the Coinbases last quarterly reports, retail trading volume is still 70% below what it was at the peak of 21. It is just a fundamental mismatch of inflows and outflows. Regardless of what you do as a project, that matters more than anything else.
00:27:36.380 - 00:28:35.460, Speaker B: All right, let me throw a thesis at you and I want to see if both of you guys agree or disagree with it. I went to the Coinbase state of crypto summit last week and Cathie Wood and Samara, who's the CIO of BlackRock's index business, both share this number, 80%. And 80% was interesting because it's the percentage of flows and buyers that are self directed investors, aka retail, for their ETF's. So I think on crypto Twitter, you see ETF's bitcoin, ETF is here, institutions are here. What they were arguing is, look, what people don't understand is that 80% of the buyers for this ETF, they're actually self directed retail people in their own brokerages. Then that makes you think about, okay, in this cycle I saw the Coinbase earnings and retail is still much lower than it was in the last cycle. Therefore the takeaway is that retail is not back yet and they will come and thats good for everyones bags.
00:28:35.460 - 00:29:12.100, Speaker B: Theres another idea which is hey the more ETF's we have, if you can just go buy bitcoin and ETH and then maybe Solana and then maybe avax in your fidelity account. Those are the thing. People dont just jump into crypto and say I want to buy that 70th asset on Coinmarketcap. They buy bitcoin and ethnic on Coinbase and then they say ah, I made a little money, let me get a little more risk on with it. So maybe that actually makes it so that retail doesn't come for a lot of the insert tokens. Ten through 100 on Coinmarketcap. Agree disagree.
00:29:16.960 - 00:30:06.030, Speaker C: I generally agree that anything that increases accessibility for the head assets is going to increase the number of both people and the amount of capital that's flowing into it. When I look at some of my friends that are not into crypto at all have never used metamask or phantom. They're pretty comfortable. Like oh, now that it's in here I feel like this is safe, I can buy it. I've always thought about it, now I'm just comfortable because it's in my fidelity account. I would expect if they add Solana more assets into brokerages, you see a lot of capital inflow. The question would be how does that change things for venture investors? Because we're not necessarily investing in those, we're investing in these longer tail assets.
00:30:06.030 - 00:30:55.720, Speaker C: How many of them? A lot of these teams are still trying to find products market fit. Are they going to create ETF's for a token that's on the second page of Coingecko, maybe doesn't even have good product market fit yet, but has a really strong community, they've got a good roadmap because frankly that's still where a lot of returns come from. Even if you look at this cycle, which has been interesting, a lot of the AI tokens have been the ones that have done well and most of them definitely don't have much of a product, but they've been some of the best performers overall. People still want access to those and that's still where a lot of the returns are generated or say venture and what would describe as traditional retail versus maybe this new version of retail which is the casual sort of crypto participant.
00:30:57.620 - 00:31:38.970, Speaker A: And I think maybe we kind of started the conversation with why is this cycle different and weird. Maybe this is kind of like an early preview of what flows are going to look like in the future where like 21 it was like oh you bought some ETH to like punt on nfts, bought some ETH or Solana and we're doing defi stuff and then you just hopped around crypto and bought some alts. But maybe now flows are different where as you said, it's just like oh, I just have this ETF and the price of that asset may go up and that creates an underlying wealth effect that flows down the beauty that is the Coingecko top 100. But it's just different than how these flows have moved before.
00:31:40.020 - 00:32:43.396, Speaker B: Yeah its interesting. I remember at the very beginning of the start of this cycle my co founder was saying to me, he said look I think EtH is going to struggle. I was like no, EtH is going to rip, dont you understand? And he said no look theres too many options. Now in the last cycle if you wanted to get exposure to Eth, you just bought EtH and now its like do you buy the l two? If its an l two do you buy arbitrum? Do you buy optimism? So if you take lets take $10,000 that a retail person might have to buy eth in the last cycle you just bought etH and now its like okay maybe you take like 3500 you put it into eth, you take like I dont know 2500 you put into op, 2500 into op, thousand into zK, now whatever thousand into stark. Now theres this dispersion of tokens that you can its just like a broader array of tokens that you can allocate to. So hey everyone, Santi and I have been talking about Solana a lot recently and we're excited to have a Solana sponsor of empire. Marinade is a staking protocol in Solana.
00:32:43.396 - 00:33:34.244, Speaker B: I remember when they launched, I think it was back at a Solana hackathon and they were funded with this 80K grant. It's super cool to see how far they've come. They're the only stake pool today that delivers auto rebalancing, mev rewards and automatic downside protection. With their new protected staking rewards, you can stake natively or liquid stake with Marinade and get the same high performance delegation strategy that thousands are using already to stake your soul to over 100 of the best Solana validators. Marinade has been live for over two years and they have audits completed by four of the top security firms in crypto. The delegation strategy is a first of its kind. So if you're staking your Solana, if you want to start staking your Solana, if you want to get some yield from your soul, start staking today with marinade, go hit the link in the show notes big thanks to Marinade for everything that they've done in Solana staking land.
00:33:34.244 - 00:34:22.662, Speaker B: Go check them out. Go stake your Solana with Marinade today, this episode is brought to you by Avalanche. Avalanche is a leading network of blockchains, giving some of the world's largest financial institutions the design space to explore new use cases and business models while leveraging completely customizable infrastructure. Everything that Avalanche has been building the last few years has culminated in this moment where today you have institutions and developers able to essentially have limitless possibilities with the chain. They've enabled developers to build cross chain swaps or create gaming environments where one subnet can unlock features in another or can use USDC as a native gas token, Onyx, for example by JPMorgan or Citi or DTCC's digital assets, or the Australia New Zealand banking Group. They're all building on Avalanche evergreen subnets. Really cool stuff.
00:34:22.662 - 00:34:43.616, Speaker B: Big thanks to Avalanche for sponsoring this episode of Empire. Go explore Avalanche subnet ecosystem at core app forward slash discover. That's core core dot app Discover. Thanks again, Avalanche. This episode is brought to you by Mantle. Mantle is an l two backed by one of the industry's largest treasuries. At the time of recording, it's valued at $4.4
00:34:43.616 - 00:35:09.518, Speaker B: billion. The mantle ecosystem engages in a lot of early stage exciting projects such as Athena and Eigen Lair, and they give out actually the rewards to the mantle community. There are two airdrops I want to tell you about. The first one, it was with Athena. They offered 2.5 billion Athena shards to holders of their native token MNT. So the reward station program distributes these pre sale token allocations to MNT holders who stake the tokens.
00:35:09.518 - 00:35:37.852, Speaker B: The second one they have going on is with Myso. My so that gives out over 90,000 Myso tokens worth about $50,000 today. That starts on April 25, runs through May 2. If you want to check that out, you got to stake your MNT and you can check out the reward station at Mantle XYZ rewardstation. Big thanks to mantle for sponsoring empire. Low float, high fDv, big problem. Not as big of a problem as people say.
00:35:37.852 - 00:35:39.720, Speaker B: What are your guys thoughts around this?
00:35:41.220 - 00:36:40.750, Speaker C: I think coming back to what I mentioned earlier in terms of who sticks with these projects during bear markets, it's people that made money in a high fpv, low flow environment. There's just no one other than the VC's. And then the VC's move on to the next project they want to invest in or they're selling now on the other side. So the team can definitely contribute, continue to ship and deliver product. But like if you don't have that base of people that are going to stick with you, like ETH had in 2019 2020 or Solana had in this most recent bear market, I think the longevity of those projects is going to be challenged and the only people that are going to be continue to work. There are like the core team that are happy to get paid and receiving tokens as part of its investing schedule, but there just isn't that rabid base that will stick through it.
00:36:41.130 - 00:37:24.458, Speaker A: I think the other thing we hadn't talked about is you think about who's the natural buyer for any of these tokens post launch. We've established there's not a ton of institutional allocators buying these liquid assets. It's generally retail. The other issue with airdrops is that it just sucks a ton of buy demand out of the market. What is the Venn diagram of people who want Eigen exposure but didnt participate in the airdrop or points campaign? Its probably not that high. If you wanted Eigen exposure, you probably already had ETH, so youre probably farming the Eigen points campaign. I'll use myself as an example.
00:37:24.458 - 00:37:34.770, Speaker A: Like, I got some Eigen, oh, I got some Eigen points. Hopefully I didn't just like destroy my airdrop application here. What am I going to do?
00:37:34.810 - 00:37:37.466, Speaker B: You've been coincidentally removed from the list.
00:37:37.618 - 00:37:38.690, Speaker C: What am I going to do, go.
00:37:38.730 - 00:38:37.868, Speaker A: Buy more liquid at like a $15 billion FTV? Like, of course not. Yeah, so like, it's like just so bizarre that we would just shoot the main retail buyer and just be like, actually were just going to give this to you for free. And not only give it to you for free, then were going to make it so that if you want to buy more, its going to be at a really expensive price. And so I think it just creates a bad structural market. But I also think that the low float, high ftv thing is kind of a red herring in that I actually don't think the floats are that different than they were last cycle. You look at the l ones that have done well, Solana Avax near, none of them really launched it more than like a 20% float. And I think Kobe made a lot of good points in his last piece that, yes, these ftvs are higher than they were before, but you look at the benchmark assets like ETH, those are also way higher.
00:38:37.868 - 00:38:58.490, Speaker A: It's like maybe these things are launching at an appropriate FTV. I really think the issue is just this mismatch of inflows and outflows, and people are kind of looking for something to blame. And so we've kind of centered on this and meme coins as the two villains of this cycle. So far.
00:39:01.630 - 00:39:38.370, Speaker B: You guys worked together for three, four years at Coin list, right? So you've spent more time on token distributions and token sales than anyone I know. We talked about it briefly. I want to go maybe a little deeper into that. What are the learnings and takeaways from those years at Coin list and just working with different founders on these airdrops? I think it's fair to say you guys would agree that most of the ways, the way that most people are doing airdrops today is not done well. And you guys have briefly touched on that now. But maybe take me deeper into your guys thoughts around airdrops.
00:39:38.870 - 00:40:27.240, Speaker C: Yeah. There's a guy that we used to work with at coinless that now runs a company called Coin one that helps teens navigate the market maker selection process. And his line from four years ago was always, the token is the product. And if you think of traditional web two companies that are doing product development, they're trying to find products, market fits, find a group of customers that just love your product, find them and then expand from there. Like, that's how you do it. So if you bring that over to web3 and you view the token as the product, part of it is finding that base of people that just love you and love your token. And probably the way to do that is to help them make money.
00:40:27.240 - 00:41:20.394, Speaker C: So looking back historically, basically all projects that the people that were able to make a core group of users money early on, they have that rapid fan base that then goes out and tells the story to everyone else. And I think just looking at the token sales on coinless, the ones that, like Solana, is such a good example, because Solana kind of wasn't the darling that everyone thinks of it now. In 2019, 2020, when Raj and anchor were going out to fundraise, like, they weren't, they were struggling. People did not want to invest. They were kind of like the mid tier l one. Like everyone's like, oh, I want ICP, I want Polkadot, like, I want something else. This high performance, fast layer one, which seems really logical now, everyone was experimenting with different designs around governance or maybe multi chain thing, and so it was cheap.
00:41:20.394 - 00:41:39.670, Speaker C: They made people a lot of money. They found loyalists, engineers wanted to build there. That's how things evolved. So just on the project that we launched, I think the teams that just helped early contributors make money was probably the most important factor in their long.
00:41:39.710 - 00:41:52.078, Speaker B: Term success on airdrops. Then would you just not do an airdrop? Because that also has the risk of upsetting the community in a different way. Right, where they're pissed because they've been using your, they've been farming the airdrop, they don't get an airdrop.
00:41:52.134 - 00:42:44.650, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think airdrops are good as a marketing tactic and for user acquisition, get people, point them in the right direction for getting them to actually use the product, but probably not how it's being used now, which is the primary token distribution strategy or the only one. So I think things can still be used. It should be just part of a broader toolkit that's available. And I think Kobe's talked about it. I think Santiago talked about on one of your podcasts previously, it was the idea of using points, even potentially as a way to give people access to token sales in the future. So maybe you get an airdrop, but you also, if you hit some threshold of points, you get $1,000 allocation in the token sale. So it's a good way to get people involved, but also sort of modify the behavior after the points campaign is done.
00:42:46.390 - 00:42:48.210, Speaker B: Regan do you have thoughts on this?
00:42:49.030 - 00:43:27.052, Speaker A: Yeah, I think really you want to give your early users and community uncapped upside. And I think token sales are kind of like the most logical way to do that. I think there is a lot of talk about the hostile us regulatory regime, and some of that is right. But I think if you go back, we talked about Solana a bunch, this was really 2020. None of the coinless sales in the last four years have had any us participants. Whatever entity is selling tokens, always outside the US, a lot of compliance around not having us people participate. And so I think it's easy to just say like, okay, yeah, whatever.
00:43:27.052 - 00:44:03.788, Speaker A: Our lawyers are telling us not to do this, we're not going to. But I think there actually are a lot of ways to do this in jurisdictions that are more friendly. Europe has a lot of new rules with Mika around facilitating kind of compliant ways to do this. And I think it's just easy to kind of be like, okay, well, everyone's just doing this airdrop thing, so we're going to do it and not really try to innovate on it. But I think its a big mistake because as Mike said, in a lot of cases, your token is the product. And if that price chart only goes down, its very hard to have a sustainable project.
00:44:03.924 - 00:44:54.946, Speaker C: Preston, I think its also important to point out that over the past five or six years, the inflection points as an industry were generally around when a new token distribution mechanism came out. So you had icos, then you had Defi with yield farming, even things like Deepin with you plug box into your home, and all of a sudden you're receiving tokens. That's been where retail has kind of gotten excited. Is this new way to participate in any project, earn tokens, be a part of it, and it's good marketing. So when Uniswap came out with this, like, I get this airdrop, everyone's talking about it now, it's like once it's been done for several years, I think you lose that marketing strategy and need to come up with something new that everyone's going to talk about.
00:44:55.138 - 00:45:09.128, Speaker A: Yeah, like whenever we get a deck and it's like the go to market slide and it's like points campaign, you're like, sure. Like that's table stakes, right? But like how are you going to differentiate from the ten? You know, you're the 10,000th point campaign. How do you differentiate all the others?
00:45:09.234 - 00:45:11.840, Speaker B: What, what's next? What do you think is like the interesting thing?
00:45:14.540 - 00:45:21.240, Speaker A: Node sales like are interesting to some extent. What are node sales?
00:45:21.540 - 00:45:23.020, Speaker B: Node sales interesting?
00:45:23.060 - 00:45:38.012, Speaker A: So I don't know if you've like tracked what impossible finance has been doing. They've kind of been like the leader of this, but they've had a few projects raised like 30, $40 million where you're essentially like buying pre buying nodes, basically like buying the right to run.
00:45:38.156 - 00:45:44.780, Speaker B: Didn't gala validator Gala did this. And the last cycle is like some colossal scam, I'm pretty sure.
00:45:44.900 - 00:46:17.280, Speaker A: Well, sorry to be clear, I'm not, I'm sure like, like everything in crypto, there's a way to be. I'm definitely not endorsing that, but I think this idea of like pre selling like validator services in the network and helping to decentralize it along the way is interesting. Maybe there's some regulatory unlocks there where people are actually doing work for the network. That's kind of been, I think like the main like new approach we've seen. Mike, I don't know if you've seen anything else you think is super novel.
00:46:18.620 - 00:46:46.686, Speaker C: There hasn't been much the thirst, is there? But you know, I go back to this idea of using participation in the points campaigns as an access point for sales, because not only will, you know, people want to participate in the sales, but it will incentivize them to act accordingly during the points campaigns to get access to them. So no one has tried that yet. But I definitely would like to see someone do it.
00:46:46.798 - 00:47:24.734, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think about. So in traditional venture, there are like the seed funds, there's like series A funds, there's like series A, series B, whatever you want to call it, series C who write like bigger checks. And there's actually like growth stage, like series D and series E, like pre IPO funds. And that doesnt really exist in crypto actually, you could say. So the folks who led our round last year, ten t one rt folks, Dan Tapiero and crew, they are probably one of the only growth stage funds, but they dont really do tokens as much. What do you think about.
00:47:24.734 - 00:47:55.660, Speaker B: I mean I just saw Paradigm raised 850 million and before I read the announcement. I was like, oh, great, we have a series D growth stage token buyer here. But as they said it in their press release, they're only focusing on early stage. So will we ever see those series D and series E funds that are deploying the billion dollars or $500 million into late stage, or. No, because you have this earlier token generation event.
00:47:58.160 - 00:48:54.630, Speaker A: I mean, I think if you think about what the best growth stage strategy would have been over the last four or five years, it probably would have just been to buy a bunch of tokens. Summer of 23, if you had $250 million and you were trying to five x, that could do a decent growth multiple, you can get those multiples in liquid markets. So I think these funds need to exist, and I think they should. My view is that if we view TGe, it's like these companies are going public at Series A or B. Sure, you can be a growth stage investor, but you should probably just buy tokens or do these kinds of OTC rounds for liquid assets. I don't know that I really believe there's a huge gap. Wherever protocol teams need $75 million series ds, I don't think that's the biggest gap in the market.
00:48:56.050 - 00:49:22.332, Speaker C: There's also an element of just answering the questions, who is the next buyer? So in a pre IPO environment, Goldman Sachs is going out, they're putting a syndicate together, they're shopping around to all their high net worth clients. They know that's going to happen here. It's like, oh, well, as a growth stage series D fund, you're like, well, the next thing is an airdrop. Yeah, we're going to give it all away. So it's just an interesting, like, okay.
00:49:22.356 - 00:49:23.676, Speaker A: Well, like, who then?
00:49:23.708 - 00:49:29.836, Speaker C: Who buys? Or you have to wait for a bear market, and then people will buy it.
00:49:30.028 - 00:50:11.596, Speaker B: What do you think? This is kind of related to the questions I was asked just on the. On the idea of, okay, lattice is wildly successful. You guys raised fund one, then you raised the $65 million fund two. Did you guys see who was, I think, Arthur from Defiance, after polychain raised, he said, there's this tweet he tweeted out. He said, big VC fundraises are likely value extractive for the space right now, unless they earmark a significant percentage of that raise for liquid tokens. Else you should assume every big VC fund will eventually extract three to four times the capital they raised from the market eventually for their quotes infra investment. I don't know if you guys had seen that or if you have time to think about that.
00:50:11.596 - 00:50:13.400, Speaker B: But what do you think about that take?
00:50:16.220 - 00:51:02.470, Speaker A: I mean, I think that statement, in and of itself is also true about venture capital firms in traditional markets. Right. Like the seed investors in stripe will eventually extract billions of dollars from, like, the Nasdaq, when stripe lists, like, directionally. Crypto is not unique in that regard. I I think really, the gap is just as you said, there's not a lot of pre IPO or allocators to liquid tokens in this market. And so you just have a big structural gap where a lot of money goes into venture, not a lot of money goes into liquid markets. And so we have this very big capital inflow, outflow, structural mismatch.
00:51:02.470 - 00:51:44.682, Speaker A: Is that directly a fault of venture capitalists? No, it's a market inefficiency. And honestly, people like Arthur probably do very well taking advantage of it. So I think it's really the burden is on smart allocators to put more money into liquid markets, which they should. But I also do see his point in that I think there's a lot of venture money that's gone into this space in the last five years, and I if you don't have capital to take in those outflows, you just have a bad market environment, and that makes it hard for a lot of market participants.
00:51:44.826 - 00:52:28.770, Speaker C: Yeah, this could be where, with more liquid tokens getting converted into ETF's, you could start to see that change, because as people have access to, let's say, a sole ETF, the expectations are like, those are the people that actually end up buying it. And I think you're seeing that now with bitcoin, where a pension fund or an endowment that maybe previously would have put all of their allocation to crypto and to venture is now saying, okay, why don't we just buy bitcoin in the CTF, and if there's a dozen other assets they can do that with, then they'll buy those, and maybe the allocation of capital between venture and liquid markets will change.
00:52:29.530 - 00:53:15.990, Speaker B: Do you guys think were going to see an influx of hedge funds in crypto? Because based on what you were just saying there, Mike, it feels like were very overweight venture, because I think it started probably from the blockchain, not bitcoin era, because it was very easy to invest in. If youre an LP giving money to someone, investing in tokens maybe didnt make sense, but investing in bitgo or circle was like, yeah, that's like, I can, that's kosher. And then it turned into, okay, venture firms now start to do some tokens and then venture firms start to hold some liquid tokens. But at some point you got to imagine we just like there really aren't that many just pure play hedge funds in the industry. So you got to imagine that starts to happen. What do you, what do you think? I don't know if you guys have takes on that.
00:53:19.810 - 00:54:09.784, Speaker A: I think it's been, look, any industry where you have just like structural 80% drawdowns, its really hard to run a liquid book in that environment. Right. At some point in the bull market, hopefully you clip carry, you set a high water mark and inevitably at least if the markets continue to operate as they have, you will be down 80% at some point and your LP's will probably want to pull capital. So I think its just been a very hard environment to run hedge fund. But clearly there is alpha to be extracted here. And I think you are starting to see more financial institutions move in and operate liquid books in the space. I also just think over time I talk to more LP's for example now that own bitcoin or ETH than they did three years ago.
00:54:09.784 - 00:54:34.222, Speaker A: I think hopefully as the space matures, allocators see hey, it doesnt make sense to have all of my crypto coverage just from venture funds. I might as well also own bitcoin and ETH and not pay fees on that and capture a lot of just category beta. So I think more people doing that will also just help fix this structural mismatch.
00:54:34.366 - 00:54:55.580, Speaker B: Yeah lets get into some of the opportunities right now. I know you guys are excited about Deepin. Im curious to get your guys take on investing in apps instead of infrastructure. Maybe just take me into. I feel like this is kind of a depressing podcast talking about all the issues and the structural problems. So maybe lighten my mood a little bit and tell me what you guys are excited about right now.
00:54:56.360 - 00:56:04.986, Speaker C: Yeah I can speak to Deepin first, which as a category has certainly evolved quite a bit over the past couple of years. But we back in 2022 published a thesis on Deepin, or as we called it at the time, tip in for token incentivized physical infrastructure networks. And this was before really any of the other stuff launched was just helium at that point. But our expectation was a lot more teams would come from some industry, whether that's energy, other wireless spectrums, sensors, et cetera, and start to build out deep in networks. And that's definitely manifested. So we've invested in probably about a half dozen different companies, everything from CDNs Energy, another project called Adrena in the wireless space, and most of them haven't actually gone live with tokens yet. So we do see a big opportunity because it's one of the sectors that not only retail can quickly grok and understand and get excited about.
00:56:04.986 - 00:56:56.826, Speaker C: But if you go out and talk to NELP, pretty much all of them get excited about those projects first. So our expectation is just from an access point for people that want to get into crypto and are curious about it, whether that's a family office or just someone punching on Coinbase deepens a really good category for them to start with. It's one that we've invested in pretty heavily. It has evolved quite a bit where I think now almost anything that that doesn't clearly fit into the l one trade or DeFi is now seemingly being categorized as a DPIN. And I understand that this is like, even in 2019, everyone's like, oh, now I'm Defi. Or later on it was like, now everything's nfts. Because it's a good way to raise capital.
00:56:56.826 - 00:57:14.210, Speaker C: And I think a lot of garbage will be kind of flushed out, just like in those categories. But anywhere we have a team that has a lot of really good subject matter expertise in a space, and they can combine that with the token incentives, I think is quite powerful and we should see some good stuff in the year ahead.
00:57:14.550 - 00:57:34.230, Speaker B: Preston, anyone you're most excited about in Deepin? Yeah, so actually, another well, before you get into that deep end has been interesting. So I've looked at some of these deals and it's a lot of non crypto native founders, and we have a. Oh, man, I'm going to botch his name. Geodnet. Geonet. Geode.
00:57:35.810 - 00:57:36.194, Speaker C: Mike.
00:57:36.242 - 00:58:12.876, Speaker B: Yeah, Mike from Geonet. From coming on the pod and yeah, I've looked at a lot of these and it's a different class of founders coming into crypto, which is why I love it. It's like a really interesting, unique group of people, and I've invested in a few of these. They are not focused on community building in the slightest. Like, they think less about community building and tokens. I think, like, in token, number go up. They think about token as like a, in the flywheel incentive mechanism, but they think less about, like, community building and number go up token than I think any group of founders in crypto.
00:58:12.876 - 00:58:17.348, Speaker B: Do you, what do you. I don't like. How do you advise these deepin founders when they think like that?
00:58:17.444 - 00:59:06.438, Speaker C: The Deepin space has been interesting because for the first year of it, before Masari and Sammy came out with a name for it. It really was just all industry people that maybe were, they were really into helium, they were already into crypto, and they were like, okay, this is kind of cool. And I can see where it can be applied to my industry. In the past six months, as the category has grown, what we're starting to see is just more crypto native people that are like, oh, this is a really good way to make money fast. I can just do some random thing and get people to buy some box. I'll tell them that it's going to do something, and next thing you know, I'm launching a token. That was definitely not the case probably a year and a half ago, and a really good example of that is a portfolio company demo.
00:59:06.438 - 01:00:06.530, Speaker C: You had this really interesting cross section of people that one guy that had worked in the automotive industry, one guy that had worked for consensys, and another person that had worked both in automotive and for chainalysis. So just a composition of a team where you had some people that just understood the industry, could talk the talk, go out there and do the business development, and understand what those people needed. But also the internal folks that could design token systems knew where to build. And that's the type of founding team that, at least in the projects we want to invest in, is where they have a good mixture between the two. But what I will say is we'd rather see them have good industry expertise because we think you can always find the crypto people that can bring the crypto ideas to it. And frankly, if you offer people token incentives to do something, it's pretty clear they will do it, whatever it is. Put an antenna on the roof of their home, they're going to go out and figure out a way to do it.
01:00:08.670 - 01:00:10.610, Speaker B: Reagan, what do you like in the deep end space?
01:00:12.870 - 01:01:00.646, Speaker A: So I'll answer your question, but you kind of segue this, talking about this being a depressing episode. We're actually really excited, and I think hopefully our excitement comes across here. Look, we've been working on network launches full time for seven years at this point. Us inserting ourselves or starting to talk about current issues with token launches, the low flow at high ftv thing, it's not like, oh, fuck, the world is falling. It's like, hey, this is wrong, and everyone knows it's wrong, but let's talk about it and let's find a solution. That's really where I think brainpower should go versus just my tokens are down, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? That's, like, much less interesting.
01:01:00.646 - 01:01:46.428, Speaker A: So, yeah, hopefully for anyone who's felt down listening to this episode, my enthusiasm comes across. I mean, yeah, deep in, generally very exciting. Our thesis from day one has been around products we think could expand the market or the infrastructure that enables that. And I think deep in is one of the first categories where we're starting to see that really hit scale. I think you mentioned investing in apps versus infrastructure. One thing weve been excited about this cycle is seeing applications with proprietary distribution start to own more of their own stack and we think capture more value as a result. Two portfolio companies from our first fund where we were day one investors are layer three and Galaxy.
01:01:46.428 - 01:01:57.110, Speaker A: Both have built two of the top ten most widely used apps in the EVM. Both around kind of like product discovery is Galaxy.
01:01:58.090 - 01:02:02.670, Speaker B: I know layer three and Brandon Co very well and saw the raise. But is Galaxy a competitor?
01:02:03.210 - 01:03:06.704, Speaker A: Yeah, so Galaxy kind of started with this quest platform, really product focused on emerging markets. They've had almost 20 million wallets complete. The quests have really hit scale and they've kind of segued that into projects wanting to use their network basically for airdrops just because they had such a large base of users. They then rolled out some identity verification tools like Galaxy passport, where they now have over a million wallets that have basically done KYC and then issued a zero knowledge proof on chain to prove that all on BNB. So this is a million people who have actually paid to mint a passport and projects are now using that to basically distribute tokens to a verified group of users. So what we're seeing with both them and layer three is they're starting to kind of like commoditize the infrastructure they use and roll more of their own stack and we think will capture more value as a result. I think Blur was kind of like one of the first people to do this cycle, right, where like they needed a high throughput chain for the purpose product.
01:03:06.704 - 01:03:37.870, Speaker A: They could have gone to like Arbanop and gotten a grant to roll there. But they're like, hey, we own this category, right? We're not going to give you all the sequencer fees and protocol fees. Lets just roll our own l two. And theyve done that really well. Whats exciting is we think the ceiling on where applications trade this cycle will re rate as they basically start to vertically integrate and own more of their own infrastructure. Thats a trend were excited about.
01:03:38.170 - 01:03:47.732, Speaker B: Preston, how do you think about base and like tell? Have you guys looked into telegram like ton?
01:03:47.836 - 01:03:49.020, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
01:03:49.180 - 01:04:15.860, Speaker B: Like just these l ones that are l two. Whatever you want to call them blockchains that I don't, I don't even know we're calling base these days. These networks that have baked in distribution via something else, like telegram, obviously has telegram and then base, obviously as coinbase users. Like, how much does that impact? Like how you think those will do relative to the folks who don't have distribution? On this topic of distribution, yeah, I.
01:04:15.860 - 01:05:18.010, Speaker C: Mean, I think distribution as an advantage will become more and more important, which is why we've invested in projects like layer three and galaxy, that it is the first touch point for many people when they get into crypto and they say, okay, I bought some tokens about some Eth Sol, what do I do next? So in both of those, it's like this is the first thing that you can do to discover what else is available within crypto at the discovery point. Now you have behemoths like telegram and base that probably at this point, people are underselling just how important that is. And I think because crypto has historically been just a much more engineering centric culture, people have discounted the efficacy of things like marketing just as a strategy. So if you've access to all the people, it almost doesn't matter what your tech is like, they're all there. That's the only thing that matters. Like they don't care about maybe the ZK technology that you have or the fat stuff. That's like, you're already there.
01:05:18.010 - 01:05:41.836, Speaker C: And that's probably just like, it is probably still discounted just how important having distribution baked into whatever it is you're offering will be moving forward. Like if you're launching a new l two, like, how can you compete with base where that is the primary access? That will be the primary access point, and they can potentially even adopt whatever tech that you're planning.
01:05:41.948 - 01:06:24.730, Speaker A: One question we get asked a lot from our lp's is like, hey, all of this money's gone into infrastructure. What's coming out of that? And I think that's a question a lot of people ask. It's like, oh, there's so many infrastructure funds, where's all that money going? And I think the answer is, we're actually starting to see this now where like Coinbase, telegram, I mean, both of those have some amount of technical innovation in what they've launched, but it's become way easier to roll your own chain. There's all of these rollups as a service. There's a lot of data tools. You now have the op stack, you have arbitrum, nitro. It's becoming easier and easier to basically take a proprietary audience and you can just pick and choose whatever tech you want.
01:06:24.730 - 01:07:11.984, Speaker A: And so I think we're now starting to see a lot of innovation move away from the pure technical side and more towards just like how do I build a unique audience? And I think we're starting to see more venture dollars flow into applications as a result. Which is awesome, right? Because I think you look at what catalyzed a lot of interest in the last cycle, and it was things like Axie and Stepn and helium, where it was just like some very novel combination of like financial incentives and some kind of cool new thing you could do that just blew up and catalyzed a lot of interest in the space. So I'm optimistic that old venture money flowing into social PI and new deep applications and all this stuff, something cool that really levels up the industry user wise, is going to come out of that.
01:07:12.112 - 01:07:32.630, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you guys think about expressing these investments? Are you only see early stage venture? And if you are only early stage venture, do you do things that don't have tokens too? Or it's only early stage venture with a potential token? How do you express, when you see an opportunity, how do you express it?
01:07:34.810 - 01:08:11.374, Speaker A: Our general core strategy is pre seed and seed. About 20% of our fund is liquid tokens we bought in secondary markets. Some of that is supporting projects we've invested in the private side, some of it is just other projects we like. But generally the core strategy is backing founders from day one. And we've written a lot of smaller pre seed checks, for example, where we'll double down in a proper seed round or double down in a series a. Generally our view is crypto native value capture is where the most opportunity lies. And so generally our focus is products that we think will have token.
01:08:11.542 - 01:08:22.104, Speaker B: Nice. Cool guys, good pod. Anything else that we're like clearly missing from the lattice brain dump here, Mike.
01:08:22.152 - 01:08:27.608, Speaker A: Let'S hear a super optimistic vision for the future to get everyone excited.
01:08:27.704 - 01:08:29.340, Speaker B: No pressure, Mike, no pressure.
01:08:30.760 - 01:09:05.760, Speaker C: So I will say in call it the first half of this year, it was a little bit discouraging in that it didn't feel like a lot of new innovative stuff was happening. People were rinsing and repeating. But in the past three months, like, I've been really blown away by some of the founders coming into the space at this. Maybe it's just the inflection point, that market is getting better and building really interesting stuff. So maybe like three or four months ago I was a little pessimistic. On, like, what was happening. We were just getting a lot of rinse and repeat.
01:09:05.760 - 01:09:33.229, Speaker C: Let's take a forked version of this Defi app or NFT marketplace. And I do think that's starting to change pretty dramatically. And our deal flow pipeline has increased pretty significantly. Not only new sectors and new use cases, but also just the quality of entrepreneur coming in has gone up in the past past six months or so.
01:09:34.369 - 01:09:42.349, Speaker B: Nice. Cool, guys. Well, this is a pleasure. Um, hopefully see you guys at permissionless later this year in October. You guys coming?
01:09:42.649 - 01:09:44.049, Speaker C: Is it Austin or.
01:09:44.209 - 01:09:45.657, Speaker B: No, it's Salt Lake this year.
01:09:45.753 - 01:09:49.105, Speaker C: Oh, cool. All right, well, yeah, we.
01:09:49.217 - 01:09:51.929, Speaker A: Mike, how's your pickleball game? I saw your hosting tournament there.
01:09:52.009 - 01:09:55.909, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So I don't know how you guys pickle game is, but hopefully see you guys there.
01:09:56.849 - 01:10:00.137, Speaker C: I would have preferred skiing, but we.
01:10:00.153 - 01:10:06.982, Speaker B: Missed like a month or two. It's in October, so it'll be good, like biking and hiking and the soft things for you, Mike?
01:10:07.126 - 01:10:11.270, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good to me. Thank you. Thanks for having us on.
01:10:11.390 - 01:10:11.990, Speaker B: Yeah, pleasure.
