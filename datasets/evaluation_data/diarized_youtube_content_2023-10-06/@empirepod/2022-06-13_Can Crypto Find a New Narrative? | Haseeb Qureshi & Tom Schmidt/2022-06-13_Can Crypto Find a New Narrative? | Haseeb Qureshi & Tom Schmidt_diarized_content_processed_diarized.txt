00:00:00.160 - 00:00:07.646, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various Dexs. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:07.750 - 00:00:34.864, Speaker B: This is what we see with every technological cycle is that people are going to iterate airdrops for just people who touched your product before your token was live, right? That's the norm today that will change to something that more closely maps onto what we mean by loyalty. And it's probably different for different applications, but eventually we'll find something that tracks the thing that we actually care about, which is that I want to reward loyal community members. You. That's what people really want to do. Airdrops don't really do that very effectively anymore.
00:00:38.964 - 00:00:45.148, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we are back with two of my favorite people in crypto. We have Tom and Haseeb from Dragonfly. Welcome to Empire, guys.
00:00:45.276 - 00:00:46.196, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:00:46.300 - 00:00:47.180, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:00:47.252 - 00:01:10.090, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, you guys. A month ago, Haseeb, you came on with a vitro back in maybe January or February in this year, and you were just maybe. You sounded a little tired. I know you don't drink coffee, but you were kind of just like, there's narrative exhaustion in crypto. I don't know. We were coming off two years of just a crazy market, and then you guys wrote this kind of depressing piece about a month ago. Layoffs are coming.
00:01:10.090 - 00:01:23.926, Speaker A: Batten down the hatches. So, Haseeb, I want to pick on you to just kick off this podcast. You tell me how you're feeling these days. Are we exhausted? Are we excited? Are we tired? Are we pessimistic, optimistic? How are you feeling these days?
00:01:24.090 - 00:01:58.442, Speaker B: Well, I'll tell you, markets seem pretty exhausted. Obviously, we've had a pretty choppy month since the collapse of terra in May. The macro picture has started to pick up a little bit. Actually, stocks have started to recover a bit, but crypto hasn't come alongside it. What you're broadly seeing is that before May, we were talking about narrative exhaustion. Now we're talking about really searching to try to find what narrative, if any, is there that's going to sustain crypto. It seems like right now we're entering into a different cycle.
00:01:58.442 - 00:02:44.850, Speaker B: We've already seen a number of companies starting to get down rounds. We've seen Coinbase Institute a full on hiring freeze as well as rescinding some of their outstanding offers. We're starting to see the very first inklings of people running out of money. The interesting thing about crypto startups in particular is that they raised so much capital over the last year, I mean, there were tens of billions of dollars that flew into crypto startups, which means that even when you enter into an environment of tighter capital and harder to raise money, if you've raised a lot of money from your previous fundraise, then you don't really need to lay anybody off. You don't necessarily need to tighten the belt, and you don't need to raise a down round. You can keep going for a while until you actually run out of money, or until you actually start hitting product market fit. But if you don't get there, if you don't get to either of those two, then at some point the shoe drops.
00:02:44.850 - 00:03:03.252, Speaker B: So in crypto right now, when you're monitoring the news and you're seeing, huh, it seems like there's still a lot of fundraising announcements that are happening. It seems like the money's still flowing. A lot of these funds months ago. So we were just monitoring the news and someone was chatting. It's like, man, it looks like all these startups are still getting funded. And we're like, oh, wait, that one. Yeah, we talked to them like four months ago.
00:03:03.252 - 00:03:38.388, Speaker B: So the reality is you're not getting a real time picture of what the funding environment looks like unless you're actually on the, either you're raising money or yourself on the funding side. So it is a choppy environment right now. Now why am I not totally depressed? I'm not totally depressed for a couple of reasons. One is that fundamentals in crypto are still okay, so they're not, they're not looking terrible. This doesn't look anything like it did in 2018, if you remember 2018, 2018 was like, oh, my God, it's all over. 2018 was like, nevermind, no one cares about any of this. It's all bullshit.
00:03:38.388 - 00:04:15.922, Speaker B: Like nobody was ever gonna ship anything. And we were, we were all fed a lie. That was what 2018 felt like, and 2022 feels very different. 2022, all these applications work, they're all there. You can touch them, you can feel them, you can interact with them. There's an enormous amount of brilliant people building real stuff in crypto, and the amount of capital that's gone into the space means that there's going to be a lot of people solving a lot of hard problems for many years to come, regardless of whether or not prices or macro or whatever ends up improving over the next year or two. The thing, of course, this was a macro driven sell off, and macro will eventually get better.
00:04:15.922 - 00:04:39.426, Speaker B: Right now it's bad. Right now it looks ugly. Right now there's not a lot of demand for risk assets, but that stuff, it waxes and wanes depending on the overall macro picture. Right now, inflation is high. When inflation goes down, almost everybody I know expects that the Fed will eventually pump the brakes and interest rates will go back down, in which case there's going to be more demand for stuff like crypto. So in the long run, crypto is going to be fine. I don't know anybody who thinks that, yeah, crypto's over.
00:04:39.426 - 00:04:45.178, Speaker B: Time to move on and, you know, go back to, you know, optimizing advertising or whatever.
00:04:45.306 - 00:05:18.058, Speaker A: Like 2018. Yeah, 2018. It very much felt like, oh, my God, did we get this wrong? Was I just completely wrong on this? And, like, I'm going back to my job and I have to, like, come crawling back to them. Now it's, now it's just, how long is this bear market going to last? We're obviously right about crypto. It's just, is this a. How long and how deep of a bear market is this? So maybe, Tom, I can pick on you to just expand on Haseeb's thoughts about the choppiness of the venture, um, of the venture markets right now. And just knowing that, like, maybe a lot of folks in RC and a lot of the listeners, we're getting this, like, maybe delayed stream on venture.
00:05:18.058 - 00:05:37.106, Speaker A: So maybe in three months we'll see the real state of what venture looks like today. But if you could just give us a glimpse inside the eyes of someone. You guys just raised a $650 million, um, fund, I think three. So I'm assuming you have a bunch of dry powder, like, what does the venture market look like today? And, like, how bad is choppy? And give us some, like, maybe real world examples of this.
00:05:37.290 - 00:06:21.554, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think people think of venture as just public markets, but smaller and private, and it's not true. They're, in fact, I think, pretty discreet, and therefore, they kind of lag each other, and they're not quite sort of one to one. I mean, I think as far as venture goes, I think seed stage is still getting done. Valuations, I would say, have come down 50, 60% compared to a few months ago, which sort of mirrors what we see in the public markets. Um, it's more kind of growth stage and later stage where we've already seen a lot of, you know, markdowns. Tiger announced today, you know, they're down, like 52%. And we already seen people, you know, doing big down rounds in sort of growth stage, but it's also just a lot more painful of a conversation to have, right.
00:06:21.554 - 00:07:32.694, Speaker C: Like, if I'm an entrepreneur and it's my first time getting funding, you know, for me, I'm sort of going with whatever the market is, um, and I'm, I'll just sort of go with the best, you know, term sheet I can get if I've already raised a seed round at some crazy valuation from, you know, six months or a year ago. And now I expect to do an a because I'm running low on cash and I expect a markup, um, you know, oftentimes those rounds won't get done or it'll get done, uh, you know, in a very painful way with, you know, the investors that you don't necessarily want. And so it's not quite, you know, sort of, sort of one to one there. Um, and I agree with Aseep's point as well, where there is also this weird dynamic where, um, teams that, you know, raise a lot of money in their seed or in earlier stages last year they might not need to raise for a while. I've seen teams that have, you know, in their investor statement, their, their burn rate, and sometimes the burn is like ten years or the Runway is 15 years or something insane and you, obviously they'll be hiring, that will come down, but, like, there isn't sort of that, that sort of pressing need for cash. There's also this weird dynamic in terms of, like, private public market compression where, um, you know, doing private over the past two years has in some ways felt very easy. If you have access to great teams and great deals and great products.
00:07:32.694 - 00:08:38.972, Speaker C: I think in part because the public market was so strong and would, for a great product, give you a great valuation when things launch a token or go public or get acquired or whatever. Now we're seeing, I think, great products, great companies, great teams that are public, that have a token or have tons of usage and have a real product, their public market asset is trading on pretty cheaply compared to where you might see something in the private. And so it's harder to justify doing a seed or an a when you look at sort of the public market comp and you say, well, like, why do you think you should be valued at half of this existing public market dominant product or sometimes even the same price? And so I am curious to see where that sort of starts to blend and maybe we start to see some of these funds get allocated into the public markets. Um, there's also this weird dynamic with just so much dry powder. I think, um, sitting on the sidelines in specifically in venture, we see these, you know, new funds, including ours, get announced, you know, every week, every month, um, you know, standards announced they did 500 million. Uh, this is Andreessen $4.5 billion, you know, fund.
00:08:38.972 - 00:08:54.084, Speaker C: There's a lot of these funds coming out, and a lot of them want to do early stage, you want to do, you know, sort of seed, um, but obviously not everyone can, you can't deploy, you know, $4.5 billion fund into, you know, a bunch of, you know, $30 million deals. So I'd be kind of curious to see how that dynamic plays out as well.
00:08:54.204 - 00:09:02.868, Speaker A: Yeah, there's kind of this spectrum of leverage that exists in venture, and it kind of swings back and forth between the founder and the VC, depending on when we're in a bull market or a bear market.
00:09:02.916 - 00:09:03.076, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:03.100 - 00:09:25.050, Speaker A: So at the very top of a bull market, the founder has all the leverage. Not giving up a board seat. I'm taking whatever valuation I want. I have every VC and every angel coming at me to invest. So I get my pick of the litter in a bear market, in the heart of the bear. It's completely flipped. I'll take any terms along that spectrum.
00:09:25.122 - 00:10:10.704, Speaker B: Where question, I mean, the first approximation for where the balance of power is between entrepreneurs and sources of capital is interest rates. Actually, interest rates you can think of as being the price of money. And when interest rates are high, that means money is expensive. When interest rates are low, that means money is cheap. Whenever interest rates go up, that means that the counterfactual return that you can get investing into something that's less risky than investing into a startup is higher. And so the startup is not going to demand as high a premium. So generally speaking, when the spread between potential investments collapses, and it's like, hey, I could go invest in this thing in the public markets, which is worth just about as much as, twice as much as what you're asking for.
00:10:10.704 - 00:10:49.394, Speaker B: But if you really knock it out of the park, I'm going to get a two x, which is not that great. That means that venture capitalists are going to have more power than entrepreneurs. At the end of the day, it's really about the growth rate of the industry. If the industry is growing really rapidly, then that incentivizes more entrepreneurs to come onto this side of the market. And when the returns of the industry are suffering and there's less incentive to invest into the marginal startup, then that's going to shift the balance of power more towards the capitalists. And so it kind of whacks and wanes over time. It never just stays one way.
00:10:49.394 - 00:11:21.770, Speaker B: Right. Because both sides of the market are. It's a market, right. It's a totally open market, meaning that you can have more venture capitalists show up, you can have more entrepreneurs show up, and they both get attracted by the price signal of what it's like for startup funding when rates are at rock bottom. Really what that means, what the world is telling you when rates are rock bottom, it means that we have no good ideas. We don't know of good ways to put money to work, and so we're happy to fund almost anything as long as you can produce some marginal rate of growth. We're so starved for growth in the world that we're willing to pay almost anything for a good idea.
00:11:21.770 - 00:11:55.834, Speaker B: That's what really low rates means. Now, when rates are higher, that means actually we have a bunch of good ideas. And if you have some other new good idea, it better at least hit this margin for us to be willing to invest in you, especially if you're thinking about starting a startup. Ironically, one of the most important things to be thinking about is what is the risk free rate? The risk free rate is going to affect a lot of whether you want to go work for a big company that's working and actually putting money to work, as opposed to starting a company which is finding a new way for growth to happen, as opposed to investing already in a way that we already know how to grow the economy.
00:11:55.994 - 00:12:25.774, Speaker A: So then how much of this bear market right now is predicated upon what the Fed does? I think maybe it's a two part question, which is, are we just dependent on the Fed and is like, going long crypto right now just trying to fight the Fed? And then the second part of that question might be, how do you think about how far into the bear market we are? Maybe six months down from the tops. Does that mean we're 50% of the way through? Is this like a long bear market? But maybe if we could start about just like, how dependent are we on the Fed?
00:12:26.234 - 00:13:00.284, Speaker B: I'd say yes and no in a few ways. So one would depend on the Fed because obviously the fear of interest rates and the rising of interest rates is a lot of what has spooked the crypto market, as well as growth assets across the board. So it's not just crypto. Crypto's correlation to other growth assets has been at historic highs since this macro cycle. Also, it's worth remembering that we've only ever seen crypto in an environment of rock bottom interest rates. Crypto bitcoin was literally created after the great financial crisis. Ever since then, rates have been extremely low, and we may be moving for the first time into a high interest rate environment as we haven't seen in decades.
00:13:00.284 - 00:13:52.814, Speaker B: So now we'll see whether or not that actually comes to pass. But if the worst happens, it may really, really disrupt the way that we think that crypto works and the role that we think it plays in the context of broader financial assets. So in one sense, yes, we are dependent on the Fed, as we've already shown ourselves to be. Another way of answering that question, though, is to say no, because the Fed is also not operating in a vacuum. There's a common cause to why the Fed is operating the way it is. And the common cause is just the actual macro environment, which is what's going on with inflation, what's going on with the war in Ukraine, what's going on with supply chain shortages, what's going on with COVID All of these things are affecting the Fed, and that is through the Fed, it is affecting crypto. But you could argue that is also the picture that's affecting crypto, which is just the slowdown in the increase in inflation and the slowdown in the global economy.
00:13:52.814 - 00:14:30.286, Speaker B: Now, more broadly speaking, the other thing I would say, okay, is crypto totally dependent on the Fed in the sense that can crypto not recover unless the Fed jacks rates down to near zero again? And I think to that, I'd say the answer is no. Clearly no. Crypto can grow if we start building great products and start getting adoption and start solving some of these deep, fundamental problems in crypto. The reality is that in the last cycle, we haven't solved that many big problems. We've done a few things in the last cycle. You really do the accounting of what happened the last two years. What did we actually accomplish in the crypto industry? So DeFi really took on its own.
00:14:30.286 - 00:14:50.126, Speaker B: So that was great. Got Defi, at least gen one of Defi. So we've got trading, we've got borrowing, lending, but that's kind of about it. Not a whole lot else is really working besides trading and lending. Then when it comes to games, we've got some kind of janky games. We don't have a whole lot, honestly. The games in crypto are not that good yet, and not that many people are playing them an absolute scale.
00:14:50.126 - 00:15:34.654, Speaker B: Right. So there's maybe, like, on the order of a couple million people playing crypto games in the context of what real games look like, a game that has 2 million users is not a real game. That's like, okay, it's a tiny, tiny, like a tiny mobile game. It has 2 million users, and then beyond that, there's been a bunch of layer ones and a bunch of L2s and things like that. But the throughput and the actual scalability of these blockchains is still pretty meager. Even the very best of them are on the order of hundreds of transactions per second, which is just not what you need in order to sustain a world scale improvement in what we want for blockchain adoption. So the reality is that, like, I think if you look objectively at what's happened last couple of years, we've still got a long way to go before this stuff is ready for mass adoption.
00:15:34.654 - 00:15:52.614, Speaker B: And I think we were getting a bit high in our own supply and about how much progress we'd actually made in the last couple of years. Once we get farther along and we actually hit the milestones that we're trying to hit, I think crypto is going to grow. I think crypto is going to do great. But these are hard problems. That's why it's taken so long to try to solve them. So I think it'll just take more time.
00:15:53.194 - 00:16:26.782, Speaker A: Tom, you're really deep on the product side of things, and this is kind of a trope at this point. But, like, bear markets are when great products are built and really good founders double down and good VC's fund really good projects that end up taking off in the bull market. Just piggybacking on what Haseeb was saying about, like, there are still a lot of existing problems. Before talking about what you guys are excited about, what are some of the big problems that, like, now that things have cooled down, we've had six months to maybe like, breathe a little bit and just say, okay, the last bull market was crazy. What are some of the big problems that you see that we still need to fix?
00:16:26.918 - 00:17:14.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think within Defi, at least I think as Haseeb was sort of mentioning, I think the past two years has in large part been about giving sort of permissionless leverage and permissionless reflexivity to people in the crypto market. That's a large part of what a lot of this stuff was used for. You know, I'm not as down on this concept as I think a lot of people are. I think this is sort of like one of the core faults of bitcoin. And why we see a lot of these smart contracts proliferate is like, it's in some ways not super useful to have just permissionless cash without sort of permissionless financial services to go alongside it. And that sort of crippled bitcoin in some ways. And I think having sort of a truly sort of self contained financial system for some sort of permissionless, you know, store of value, um, actually is like pretty essential.
00:17:14.420 - 00:18:07.906, Speaker C: So it's, it's sort of like where we've built, you know, the Tesla roadster, where it's like it's kind of a toy and it kind of works, but like it's self contained and it's sort of end to end. But I think that in and of itself is not necessarily enough. Um, what we sort of see as the vision for defi and what I think it needs to be, you know, successful, um, is to sort of facilitate real economic value and real flows, um, in order to, um, you know, do something in the real world that generates some value, um, and sort of underlying that. And I think that's sort of what we've seen in the shift in terms of what's been happening in Defi. It's a shift away from these super leveraged, super reflexive kind of games to things that might look more productive or more useful in a bear market. So I had this thread the other day talking about what's working in a bear market, what's not working in a bear market. And I think the things that we've seen in terms of metrics in our performance are real world lending facilities.
00:18:07.906 - 00:19:02.258, Speaker C: So things like maple, things like Goldfinch, things like Trufi, even makers real world assets, you know, they're making tens of millions of DAI against things like invoices and other types of real world collateral. It's things like different types of financing services that you might want in a bear market. So Porter finance, for example, one of our portfolio companies, they just did a bond issuance through ribbon. So instead of having to sell your tokens at the bottom of the bear market for cash, you can tap into people who are willing to lend you assets or lend you cash uncollateralized for facilitating some sort of real world economic value. Maybe you need to pay people, you need to pay contractors, you need to pay rent or whatever. I think that whole space will actually continue to grow. We've also seen people lean more into some of these structured product platforms as well, that don't necessarily need huge amounts of leverage in the system to actually function.
00:19:02.258 - 00:20:06.352, Speaker C: All the DoV platforms, for example, actually seeing large net inflows in kind of the assets. So like a ribbon or a friction, they're seeing all time highs in terms of ether, in terms of Sol being deposited in the system, people looking for yield in a bear market. But ultimately within DeFi, I think it is sort of about how do we actually make products and financial services that are going to be evergreen and long lasting and not only really useful when people want to get leverage on their ETH or they want to trade some random long tail new tokens, but it's sort of about servicing something a little bit bigger. So I think within Defi, that's where I get excited. And there's obviously many different components within there. Beyond that, I think one, I mean, I think you can talk about gaming or nfts or something, but one pet, I guess, focus area that I really love is this sort of crowdfunding on steroids idea. And I think we sort of saw the first inkling of this with Constitutiondao where it's like, hey, you can spin up a smart contract and within 24 hours you can raise $40 million from people all around the world to go do something.
00:20:06.352 - 00:20:48.080, Speaker C: If that's maybe try to buy a copy of the Constitution, or maybe that's try to buy a golf course with something like Linkstow, or you're trying to buy a co working space with Empire. Now, it's still obviously janky, and I think it's still in this really legal gray space right now. But you occasionally see those sort of moments of clear product market fit, both working in product, but also as a vc where it's like, oh shit, like people really want this. It's not really built to do the thing that it's supposed to do today, but like it's clearly really highly desired. I think we saw ICos being sort of like the first example of this where it's like, oh yeah, global permissionless capital markets are like actually amazing. Um, maybe not sort of the best direction of that capital. There are a lot of issues with the way that was structured, but clearly there's something there.
00:20:48.080 - 00:21:05.836, Speaker C: And so I'm actually really excited to see that space mature and take off. And like, you basically give everybody access to, uh, you know, uh, different fundraising mechanisms than they maybe they currently have. And so, um, in my mind, that's also like a really promising area, uh, for, for crypto, um, is basically, you know, people have global permissionless capital markets.
00:21:05.940 - 00:21:30.828, Speaker A: Yeah. When you. I actually just want to go a little deeper on one of those use cases, which is the, the porter finance, um, ribbon, like convertible bond issuance. I saw you tweeted out like red emoji alert like big moment in defi history. Is this because it unlocks the other side of capital markets, which is like debt? A lot of things have just been equity driven in crypto capital markets. Is this deal such a big moment because it unlocks the debt side of this in defi?
00:21:30.956 - 00:22:15.196, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. I think we're also seeing a similar trend even in non crypto in terms of venture debt being a more attractive source of funding for a lot of these teams. Why would you want to sell your equity when at as lowest price ever, when maybe you could raise debt at a reasonable interest rate and use that to fund yourself? If you, um, see signs of growth and you see a way to sort of, you know, eventually get to a higher valuation. So it's like, you know, you don't want to buy the top, you don't want to sell the bottom. It applies to companies as well. Um, and so, you know, the ribbon porter thing, um, is a very simple example of that where, you know, today it is a convertible bond, it is over collateralized. Um, but, you know, in the future, you can imagine this being, you know, under collateralized back purely by, you know, the promise of the Dow.
00:22:15.196 - 00:22:50.646, Speaker C: It could be backed by, um, you know, cash flows from the dow. A lot of these daos do have real revenue streams. It's not just their token inflating and them counting that as revenue, but it's the people who are using these protocols, paying fees into the protocol treasury and the Dow having control over that money. And so right now these amounts are not huge, we're talking millions or tens of millions of dollars. But I think at a global scale, these things will be absolutely massive. And there's going to be better ways to use that treasury than just having it be sitting there. So there are going to be teams that pull through this bear market by finding more innovative sources of funding rather than just, you're trying to sell tokens on the market.
00:22:50.790 - 00:23:08.794, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting because just historically, I mean, maybe outside of minor financing, debt has been pretty non existent form of financing and crypto in general. Haseeb, do you think that debt financing makes up a much. Is this the bear market where we see debt financing really play a role in keeping maybe some companies alive?
00:23:09.534 - 00:23:55.098, Speaker B: So debt is always hard to do for startups, and most of the things that are happening in crypto are startups. Debt is an easier tool to invest into things that have reliable cash flows. If you are a protocol that's actually operating at scale or a dow that's operating at scale, you have real revenue, you're underwritable. Then you can say, hey, I'm good for this. In an absolute nightmare scenario, I can still pay you back. There are other, we're also close with the debt Dao team, and Debtdao is another, got another team that's also trying to build on chain debt instruments for Daos. And the idea is that if you hook in directly to the revenue source of the DAO, it's kind of like in the real world.
00:23:55.098 - 00:24:53.714, Speaker B: Normally what you would do is if you're not being paid back by a debtor, then you'd take some kind of lien on their property or the lien on their business, and you'd have to go through the legal system in order to actually enforce your claim. But in a DaO, in principle, at least, you can have a mechanism like that in the smart contract itself, such that the protocol is actually not able to generate any revenue until all the debtors are paid back or, sorry, the creditors are all paid back. That kind of mechanic. A lot of what we are thinking about in crypto is how can you remove trust from the system or make trust unnecessary within the system. Now, there's always, of course, some risk that the protocol itself could blow up, in which case, okay, yes, that's a risk that the underwriters are taking on. But the same thing is true in the real world, right? If you give a loan to Enron, okay, then you're screwed, or it doesn't matter how good your covenants are. So there's, there's a, I think this is part of the broader evolution that we're seeing in capital markets, is that there's some mechanisms for which crypto can just do things unequivocally better.
00:24:53.714 - 00:25:11.834, Speaker B: It's exactly the same fight that FTX is trying to fight with the CFTC of like, hey, if we just remove the middleman and we remove all this other craft and nonsense, we can do things much more efficiently, make things 24/7 make things real time, make things, you know, we don't have to go call somebody in the morning and say, hey, are you still good for this? The same thing can, can absolutely be applied to a lot of markets, including debt.
00:25:13.074 - 00:25:58.410, Speaker A: Is this interesting for only, is this only interesting for on chain companies? So, like, let's use an example. So I know debt is not as common of a financial instrument for startups, but crypto startups are different, right? Like Opensea did $386 million of revenue in one month this year. In January, I think it was. So that's that's a shit ton of revenue for a startup. Like normal startups don't generate 386 million in revenue in one month. So will, I guess like two part question. One is, will these companies like the, like C five, whatever you want to call it, like OpenSea, Coinbase, blockfisofteworld geminis use debt financing in this bear market more frequently than we've seen in the past because they are generating a lot of revenue.
00:25:58.410 - 00:26:06.774, Speaker A: Or is it more just like, you'll see these defi protocols, like what is this one called porter finance where it's like bonds for DAOs?
00:26:07.194 - 00:26:13.468, Speaker B: I mean, Opensea, at least in their case, Opensea just raised so much money, I'd be amazed if they need to raise debt.
00:26:13.666 - 00:26:17.384, Speaker A: But also, I don't think OpenSea actually needs money right now.
00:26:17.464 - 00:26:46.056, Speaker B: Yeah, they're also incredibly profitable. So if you're profitable, you probably don't need debt. Opensea, it's not a very intensive business. To some degree it sort of runs itself, whereas there are a lot of other things that require an enormous amount of R and D. In which case if you're trying to build a ZK roll up, it's like, okay, that thing is not going to be done for many, many years. Even once it's in mainnet, there's still so much work to do. So that kind of thing requires continual R and D work.
00:26:46.056 - 00:27:08.544, Speaker B: Even in lieu of having on chain protocol revenues. It's quite likely the ZK rollups in the early days, they're probably not going to have particularly high fees or meaningful fee payments until they hit scale. So that's the kind of thing where I would expect that it's more likely than not that they would want to find alternative forms of financing if the market doesn't come back in time. But for the very best projects, they'll always be able to raise equity financing.
00:27:08.884 - 00:27:40.920, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to go through a couple of things that are maybe like advice for founders. I know a lot of founders, actually, there are a couple of my buddies you guys have invested in and they said that you guys are consistently one of their most helpful VC's. So backpack to you guys. But you guys gave this like, you guys wrote this thing on medium, which is, I think a lot of folks found really, really helpful. And you had three different buckets. You said one, if you've recently raised, now is the time to focus on what's important and cut the fat both in product direction and in personnel. If you've over hired, next is there's going to be strong calls for regulation.
00:27:40.920 - 00:28:01.822, Speaker A: Some of the regulation will be bogus. There will be more incentive than ever to offshore the innovative stuff. And the third is the market will be less speculative for a while, especially as retail investors are no longer driving as much of the flows. Many narratives will get reset. We will not see the same old stories play out. So I want to actually touch on all three of those, maybe starting with the last one. And Tom, I'd pick on you for this.
00:28:01.822 - 00:28:19.482, Speaker A: What are some of the narratives that happened in the bull market, this last bull market that maybe have been reset where people are saying, okay, maybe this didn't make as much sense, maybe this idea, like when we were throwing shit at the wall and it worked in a bull market, maybe this actually doesn't make sense as a product strategy and as a company building strategy.
00:28:19.578 - 00:29:38.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I think a lot of the stuff I mentioned around Defi is very much in this bucket of maybe people don't want to get a ton of leverage and maybe using your token, it's sort of ridiculous ways to offer that is not really productive. It's sort of just a ponzi like game at the end of the day. But I think NFTs are actually sort of a story around sort of the meta shifting many times over the past few years, where we went from NFTs being sort of this very small part of what happens in crypto to sort of this celebrity driven NFT culture, maybe in sort of early 2021, and this was sort of when nifty Gateway was super dominant and you had grimes selling your NFT, and people thought, oh, NFTs are going to be sort of a new monetization method for artists and brands, and that's going to be sort of what it is. And then I think over the past year, we've seen this shift towards basically the sort of crypto punk inspired ten k profile picture collections and people swapping these collections and a lot of sort of variations on a theme there. But I don't know if that's necessarily going to be sort of the story around NFTs forever. I think there's a lot more that you can do with sort of on chain scarcity, NFts being sort of one example of it. But I don't think the future of NFTs is always going to be someone dropping a new ten K PFP profile or PFP collection.
00:29:38.774 - 00:30:16.220, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's like the meta will sort of constantly be shifting, and I think that's true in DeFi as well, some of these other categories as well. I think also, we've just seen sort of the story around layer ones and layers two. Layer twos themselves shift a lot. I think if you think about what was sort of popular in 2018 2019, there were a lot of promise around some of these next generation blockchains and then in progress. What we've seen is the most dominant platform for blockchains over the past year has really been a lot of these EVM based blockchains. It's people basically taking something like geth, putting a new consensus mechanism on it or speeding it up or tweaking it somehow.
00:30:16.220 - 00:30:52.880, Speaker C: And that wasn't really something. I think people were talking about predicting back in the day that these would in fact maybe be more popular than a L2 because theyre cheap and theyre fast and the bridges are sufficiently good to move things back and forth. I dont know if thats going to be the case forever. I think were big EVM polls, but I think its going to take a while to even improve on the EVM and make it better than what it is today. But that meant it could also shift over the next few years. I think its easy to get married to how the world is today. And I think thats what weve seen in previous cycles of people really getting sucked into bitcoin and believing bitcoin is going to be a thing and everything's going to be on bitcoin.
00:30:52.880 - 00:31:22.624, Speaker C: And maybe that was like, I think, a very credible thesis in 2016 when we saw Ethereum was having so many issues and bitcoin has longevity and et cetera, et cetera. But you kind of see what happens to those people when they get married to that thesis and sucked into it and not able to sort of reassess reality and reassess the situation. And I think we'll probably see a similar shift over the next few years of people who got married to sort of the 2021 mentality of how they see the world and not able to sort of reassess and look for fresh new ideas and changes in the market.
00:31:23.964 - 00:32:04.316, Speaker A: All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Paris. Swap, the best platform to stake, swap, trade, farm, and more. Paraswap just launched gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in Defi, or maybe it's just starting out, you know, how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get. The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time, and now you can get those entirely refunded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp.
00:32:04.316 - 00:32:24.530, Speaker A: Big shout out to the paraswap dow for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just, it's tough to be Paraswap right now. They give you the best prices, they save you money. You've got this gas refund if you stake PSP. They've got a smooth and really user friendly interface. Fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a Defi platform if you don't use them already.
00:32:24.530 - 00:32:48.424, Speaker A: Check out Paraswap today at Paraswap IO. Now let's get back to the show. There are. I know I said I was going to touch on those three things that you guys wrote about the medium post, but there's a bunch there I want to pick on. So. And Tom, I just go back to you. Do you think the layer one wars are kind of largely over? And does this competition move to l two s or what do you think about the layer one wars just as we move forward in the bear market?
00:32:48.724 - 00:33:21.454, Speaker C: I don't think it's over. I don't know if it will ever be over because I think there's always probably going to be a huge market premium on somebody claiming they have solved some huge problem with blockchains and wanting to launch their own layer one. But I certainly think the bounds of the competition have changed quite a bit. We've seen, again, EVM just becomes super dominant. Really, the only competitors that you would think of are like Solana and sort of the cosmos ecosystem. But even those, if you look at percentage wise, are pretty small. And even those are also looking for ways to integrate EVM or e waSm compatibility.
00:33:21.454 - 00:33:51.910, Speaker C: So it's not necessarily sort of truly discrete ecosystems. I think, as we were sort of alluding to, I think EVM still requires a lot of upgrades to make it work. I think it's JavaScript, like in that way, right, where like, you know, JavaScript did not get replaced by a totally new language. It evolved over time. We made stuff like v eight that made us run so much better. We learned how like, you know, improve parallelization, improve throughput. We added, you know, higher level languages to like, you know, make it more usable by developers.
00:33:51.910 - 00:34:46.714, Speaker C: I think there's probably a similar story for the EVM as well, where it's sort of this, this base that has this sort of lendingist to it that's going to be really hard to get, to get away from, um. Instead, we build abstractions, we build improvements, we build ways to sort of just make it more usable over time. Um, so I don't think the layer one wars are over yet. I also, frankly, would not be surprised to see more specialized blockchains come out. And I think that's actually kind of what we've seen a few examples of over the past year is, um, you know, the idea is that, well, ethereum block space is more valuable than, you know, uh, some other random, you know, EVM chains block space because you have security and you have colocation. I think, for a lot of applications that maybe don't care about either of those, where maybe I don't need nation state level security guarantees because I'm a video game. Or maybe I don't really care about colocation because the people who use my application are not using other applications, they're only using my own app.
00:34:46.714 - 00:35:34.942, Speaker C: It probably actually makes more sense for me to run my own chain or to do something else and get those fees down and really cater to my own users. Kind of what we've seen is actually a sort of cross blockchain market for block space where if I'm a dap and I really have my own sort of user base, I will shop around for the cheapest block space available that sort of fits my, where I stand on this spectrum. And that's kind of what we've seen. We saw like Audi's move from like Xdai to Solana. We saw Dydx move to starkware and now potentially moving to cosmos. We've seen axie move to Ronin. Um, and so it's like for, for these kinds of applications that have really sticky users that might not have the same security guarantees or need for co location as other applications, I suspect they will probably continue to shop around or maybe even run their own blockchains that are more tailored to their, to their needs.
00:35:35.038 - 00:36:02.444, Speaker A: What, what does that mean, shop around? Uh, because if I thought someone would like, if I'm audience, I'm basically saying, here are my needs, here are my technical needs. Uh, just like you would do. If you're like, we're recording this on this thing called Riverside, it'd be like, here are my needs. I've got aws, I've got Google cloud, and I've got Azure. Let me do a demo of all three of them and see which one's better. Is it not the same? Is it more like, hey, Solana's going to pay me 100k, avalanche will pay me 250k. Like, what does it mean to actually shop around?
00:36:02.944 - 00:36:36.688, Speaker B: I'd say no, no. I'd say, I don't know. It's a little while ago. But if you guys remember the Amazon HQ two episode, I think that's a good analogy for what it's like to build a blockchain today, which is that it's a little bit of shopping around. It's also a little bit of like in the process of shopping around, you get to know people, you get to understand how much support you're going to get. You also understand the technical needs. And look, you're not going to talk to Boise, Idaho, because you already know Boise, Idaho is not the place where you want to put HQ to, but among all the places where you can see it working.
00:36:36.688 - 00:37:01.066, Speaker B: Nothing against Boise. Boise is great. I'm sure. I've actually never been, but I'm sure it's wonderful. But among the places you're like, look, I know, look, my options are basically Solana, avalanche or Polygon and all right, why don't we all talk? You guys can each make me an offer and tell me how bad you want me and then I'll pick my favorite. That is how the majority of really dominant projects that are in the shopping around phase. We saw this with the terra collapse.
00:37:01.066 - 00:37:32.112, Speaker B: So after the terra collapse, a lot of the biggest projects on Terra did exactly this. They started going, talking to all the BD teams from all the big protocols and they decided, hey, but it's a combination, right? It's not a single thing. You don't just literally take the highest offer because of course, most of the value of being on a chain is not just what you get in tax incentives, quote unquote. It's the overall picture of like, what's the quality of the people there? What's the marketing support I'm going to get? What's the blah, blah, blah, what's the infrastructure look like? All that stuff goes into a decision of where you want to build your application, right?
00:37:32.128 - 00:37:47.428, Speaker A: I mean, we saw Polygon launch their quote unquote uncapped fund to bring, to bring folks over from Terra. That sounds like that's basically just an incentive fund to bring folks over. So that's. And is it just money related or is it tech related or what's all the above?
00:37:47.476 - 00:37:59.332, Speaker B: Right? It's multidimensional. People care about the tech. They care about the quality of the people. They care about the daily active users, they care about the spending power, they care about the TVL, and they also care about how much money you're gonna give them and how much tech support you're gonna give them. All those things matter.
00:37:59.508 - 00:38:03.624, Speaker A: Are these like 250k checks? Is this like a million dollar check? What are we talking here?
00:38:04.214 - 00:38:26.514, Speaker B: It depends on the quality of your product. I don't know. What's a blockbuster project? Look, if you're Stepn, and Stepn's like, yo, I'm done with Solana. I want to move somewhere else. People are going to be throwing a lot of money to get Stepn to come onto their chain. But if you're some marginal developer from some random country that most people haven't heard of, it's not likely that you're going to get anywhere near what Stepn's going to get.
00:38:26.934 - 00:38:32.414, Speaker A: If Stepn said, I want to move to a new chain, how much money do you think they could get?
00:38:33.714 - 00:38:42.954, Speaker B: I'm speculating at this point because I have no idea, but I would guess somewhere between five to 10 million. But it would probably be unlocked over some period of time. And it's like, you got it. You don't get it all day. One, it's not all cash.
00:38:42.994 - 00:39:00.024, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll ask you two the same question. I asked Chao and Imran. They came on the podcast last week, and I said, if you could build. If you had a seed stage startup, three amazing engineers, and they basically came to you and they're like, we've got this amazing idea. And you're like, holy shit, that is an amazing idea. And they're like, yeah, but we don't know where we're building it.
00:39:00.024 - 00:39:11.436, Speaker A: We need your advice. And whatever you tell us to build on, we're going to build on it. And Chow? Imran didn't answer, but Chow was confident enough to answer live on the show. So I'd ask you two, I'm curious if you two agree on this.
00:39:11.620 - 00:39:12.892, Speaker B: What was his answer?
00:39:13.068 - 00:39:18.684, Speaker A: I can't tell you until YouTube. Until YouTube tells me your answer. But it was a controversial one, I'll tell you that.
00:39:18.764 - 00:39:19.864, Speaker B: Tom, what would you say?
00:39:21.204 - 00:39:26.176, Speaker C: Any blockchain that or L2 that dragonfly is invested in, I think is a good choice. Um.
00:39:26.280 - 00:39:27.848, Speaker A: Such a cop out answer, Tom.
00:39:27.976 - 00:39:59.590, Speaker C: Yeah. Um, I don't know. I'm. I certainly have not been in this position, so I've not thought that deeply about it. Um, but I think, frankly, like, anywhere within the EVM ecosystem, like Polygon, avalanche, Aurora, Ethereum, even, like, a L2 would probably make sense. I think if I really cared about yoga, you know, future proofing or something, I would maybe think about making sure looking at some of the Zkedm projects that are sort of in the pipeline right now. I think I'm pretty bullish on that as the future of where scalability and where blockchains are going to go.
00:39:59.590 - 00:40:06.394, Speaker C: And so maybe not building on it today, but thinking about how you're going to get there or being compatible with that in the future.
00:40:06.774 - 00:41:01.650, Speaker B: Yeah, my answer is a bit of a cop out, but it depends a lot on what the application is. And I think people don't think about this enough because they think about the chain as just a community or a token or a price. But the question really is quite strategic about, look, if I launch this thing on this chain, who are my competitors on that chain? Let's say you're building a lending protocol. If you launch a lending protocol on Solana, it's like, okay, well, you've got Soland to compete with. How do you think you're going to do against Soland? And how much support is Soland getting from Solana Ventures or Solana Labs or the Solana ecosystem? If the competitor, on the other hand, is something like Aave, it's like, okay, how much is Aave dedicating to this chain? Do I have a competitive mode to be able to say, hey, Aave is the biggest right now on Polygon, let's say. But if I have my own token and I have my own go to market, I can get support of the Polygon team and I can potentially build a wedge to become the dominant platform on polygon. Whereas on avalanche, it's Benky.
00:41:01.650 - 00:41:31.596, Speaker B: And Benky has got a lot of buy in from the avalanche team. It's a native token. They've done their own liquidity mining scheme, so it might be harder to go to market against them. So the details really matter. It's not just about the chain, it's also about what you're building and how likely it is that you're going to be able to take mind share away from what's already there on that particular chain. And it also depends on, to your point, if you decide, to my mind, it's almost like deciding, okay, I want to build this restaurant, and I've got amazing recipes in my restaurant. It's going to be really great.
00:41:31.596 - 00:41:55.644, Speaker B: What city should I start my restaurant in? It's like, well, it depends on the kind of restaurant and depends on how many other restaurants are there like that in each of the cities? And also just where are you going to vibe? Where are you going to get support? Where are you going to be able to build a real community. And you might suck at doing that in Houston, but you could do it really, really well in Seattle. So it. Or in Boise. Boise might be your jam. Or in Boise, like, you can dominate a small market. That's, that's always an option, too.
00:41:56.184 - 00:42:16.188, Speaker A: Tom, I gave you a layup, by the way, with, uh, with the question about, like, what's going to change coming out of the bull market. And, you know, we threw shit at the wall and it stuck in the bowl, but it doesn't stick in the bear. I wanted you to answer with airdrops because I know that they're useless in a marketing stunt. And I might be putting. Yeah, words. I might, I might be putting words in your mouth and going too far, but I'd love for you to share your thoughts around airdrops.
00:42:16.276 - 00:42:46.190, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually working on this research piece right now. Basically looking at what is the activity of people who get airdrops and how much does their activity change proportionally to how much they receive in the airdrop. Are they actually going to be loyal? Stick around. And I think overall, my feeling in some of your early data is I think people loved the Uniswap airdrop. It was this amazing story. It was this amazing thing. Um, you getting thousands of dollars for free for being an early customer.
00:42:46.190 - 00:43:11.916, Speaker C: Super, you know, delightful, incredible, you know, branding opportunity that I think, you know, I was maybe slightly critical at the time, but I think I've come around on it that, yeah, you spent $150 million in marketing, but it's kind of a marketing story that you can't really even buy with, with money. But now it's become kind of expected. You have people gaming airdrops. You, people get pissed if their airdrop is not calculated correctly. It's. And it's just become the optimism community.
00:43:11.980 - 00:43:13.908, Speaker A: Was like, you're not allowed to sell.
00:43:14.076 - 00:43:36.868, Speaker C: Yes, that would be a great airdrop, actually is. You get a commemorative token that you can never sell. But it's a way to say thank you for being part of the early community. I'm sure people would love that. But, yeah, it is kind of a question, what is this for? The story is always a way to thank the community. I don't really think that's true anymore. It's a way to get early users to use the protocol.
00:43:36.868 - 00:43:58.526, Speaker C: Well, then you should be explicit about it. You shouldn't sort of hint at an airdrop. It should be an explicit project like liquidity mining. You should design it correctly. You should be a grants program, something like that. So it feels like it's kind of become this social expectation that if you have a product and you don't have a token, you better give a token to early users. But I think in practice that just like doesn't even really, it's NFT projects.
00:43:58.550 - 00:44:13.434, Speaker A: Where it's like the expectation became you have to give free things to your NFT project over time. Even though that's a pretty crappy business model. It's like if you launched a project and it's in Defi and I use it, I'm expecting my airdrop now.
00:44:13.894 - 00:44:43.186, Speaker B: I think there's also, there's an element of it that's just, there's a kind of running a strategy dry and then continuing to try it even though it doesn't work anymore. We see a lot of that in crypto, right. So like in, you know, obviously the ICO bubble was basically that, you know, writ large. And then, you know, in the summer of 2020, it was liquidity mining, where this felt like this magical way to have a token appreciated. Just do some liquidity mining program. And then pretty quickly people figured out liquidity mining doesn't magically produce value. And then it became airdrops.
00:44:43.186 - 00:45:21.438, Speaker B: And airdrops are just this magical way to make things valuable. And then suddenly it's like, okay, it didn't work. There's the ve model, then there's raising ecosystem fund. Ecosystem funds became this magical way to make layer ones really, really valuable. Then of course there's all the stuff around nfts and then there's 20% APY tokens became this really incredible thing. If you do this, your layer one is going to pump or your application is going to pump the thing that we realized, look, the first one who comes up with this idea gets a lot of bang for the buck. It really, really works in the same way that back when Facebook first launched, you remember there was this thing where Facebook would import your contacts and it would email everyone in your contact list and be like, hey, come sign up for Facebook.
00:45:21.438 - 00:45:33.228, Speaker B: That really, really worked. That was incredibly effective. If you're a new application and you do this, it's not going to work. It's just going to be spam. People are going to ignore it. And the same thing, I mean, there's pretty steep diminishing. Exactly.
00:45:33.316 - 00:45:34.556, Speaker A: It seems like for all of these.
00:45:34.620 - 00:46:09.748, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Once people kind of ride a particular marketing tactic into the ground, it stops working. But a lot of people are too afraid to not do it because it's a kind of, it just becomes like a best practice, quote, unquote, that becomes solidified as like, okay, if you don't do this, someone will get mad at you. Or who knows, maybe your project would have been successful if you had done the airdrop. But because you don't, or so because you do, you at least know that, look, at least no one's going to get mad at me. But to Tom's point, they get mad at you anyway because the airdrop's not big enough, or the calculation was wrong. Or you remove some people who look like fraudsters, but you also remove some good people, or the fraudsters complain to you.
00:46:09.748 - 00:46:51.144, Speaker B: So it's very hard to win given that it's a lot of tokens that get expended in airdrops. But the actual loyalty of most people getting the airdrop is not really there. And so I think what we'll probably, what we'll see over time, and this is what do we see with every technological cycle, is that people are going to iterate airdrops for just people who touch your product before your token was live. That's the norm today that will change to something that more closely maps onto what we mean by loyalty. And it's probably different for different applications, but eventually we'll find something that tracks the thing that we actually care about, which is that I want to reward loyal community members. That's what people really want to do. Airdrops don't really do that very effectively anymore.
00:46:51.564 - 00:47:14.104, Speaker A: Yeah, and people tried to solve that by just ve, basically just locking people up. But you can't lock someone in to create loyalty. Technically, they might not be selling it their token. But how do you advise companies who are coming to you? Okay, so I'm a founder of a dragonfly port company and I go, hey, Tom, I need help with marketing. I need help with user acquisition. We're going into this bear market. Nobody cares about my thing.
00:47:14.104 - 00:47:33.672, Speaker A: Liquidity mining doesn't create loyal users. Ve isn't a great strategy. Airdrops, you just told me they're useless. I can't go raise this $300 million ecosystem fund like, and I can't go run ads on Facebook and Instagram and all that kind of stuff. Like, I feel like I'm out of luck here. So what am I doing here, Tom?
00:47:33.768 - 00:47:38.564, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I am regretting investing in you now. Cause you're seeking me for marketing advice.
00:47:39.304 - 00:47:42.604, Speaker B: You're so negative. Clearly, we shouldn't have invested.
00:47:43.834 - 00:48:28.670, Speaker C: Yeah, but no, I think there is a component in here where it's like there are no shortcuts to building a great company or product. And I think marketing is sort of like kerosene, where it can sort of help grow things quicker. But if you don't even have a flame to start, this is really going to do anything. I think from a product perspective, I always tell teams, you have to start small, start focused, build to where the market is today. I think a lot of teams have this very grand vision and they want to be a platform, they want to do all the things. And then they launched and it's a really muddled, confused experience. There isn't really a great sort of polished experience with good liquidity, a good UI, everything that users want.
00:48:28.670 - 00:49:02.158, Speaker C: You have to start small and branch out. This is classic startup advice, but we somehow forget it sometimes in crypto. I think on the marketing side, teams also, I think, come at it with the idea of telling the story about themselves. They want to talk about themselves and what they're doing and sort of they're shouting it out into the universe and expecting that people are going to notice and care. And I think that works when you're at scale. Like, people really do care about what's happening with uniswap, or people really do care about what's happening with Stepn, but most of the time you're sort of small. You're this little ant on the ground and you're shouting and you're saying, hey, like, please pay attention to me.
00:49:02.158 - 00:49:53.872, Speaker C: And I think in actuality, like, if you want to do marketing in the really early stages of a startup, or crypto startup specifically, um, you need to be thinking about how to tell a story that is bigger than yourself and then insert yourself into it. Um, so it's not just, hey, look at this cool thing that I'm doing. But hey, here's this cool part of the market, here's this cool thing that's happening. Um, here's this, you know, bigger story, and we're a part of it and, um, you should be paying attention to it because we are also this really cool amm that is doing something kind of similar to uniswap or you, whatever. I think the other thing teams also get wrong is they want to outsource marketing. They think, I can just hire an agency and they will just do everything for me. And I think ultimately, it's very unique to crypto is that there is a cult of personality and sometimes around some of these founders, and the founders are the ones who are active on Discord, the founders are the ones that are active on Twitter, they're the ones who are telling the story.
00:49:53.872 - 00:50:31.654, Speaker C: And I think that is sort of what we seem to be the most. I think potent way of narrative building is like it's this founder who's on this mission or these founders who are on this mission. Um, and I think, like, if you don't have that, um, like, you probably know all the top founders of a lot of the top blockchains, a lot of top defi products, and it's not even necessarily true of like, you know, normal startups or products that you might use. You probably don't know the founders of a lot of the, you know, uh, products or companies that use day to day. But for crypto, it's, it's very true. And so you got to be in the weeds a little bit. Um, and in some respects it's a benefit because you're actually talking to users, you're getting feedback from them.
00:50:31.654 - 00:50:38.510, Speaker C: You're sort of having a really tight feedback loop, which is a really key part of building a successful product.
00:50:38.622 - 00:51:20.874, Speaker A: I think that's really, really good advice that folks oftentimes forget, especially in the bull market, is go as niche as possible and capture a super niche market. And you look at some, I mean, the overused examples are like Facebook started with college students, and like eBay started with collectibles. I think Craigslist started with San Francisco meetups. It's like go super, super niche and capture that market and expand out from there. Going back to some of that founder advice, I'm curious, how do you advise founders who might, maybe they didn't raise at the top of the bull market and they need to raise again? Blockfi, I don't know if this is true or a rumor, so I won't confirm it, but I think they raised a 3 billion. It was rumored they were raising it like a 5 billion today. Came out and said that they're raising it like a 1 billion.
00:51:20.874 - 00:51:36.270, Speaker A: So it's down between 66% to 80%. Right. What is like the psychology of a down round? And how do you advise founders who maybe have to raise it a down round? But like, the other side of this is if they don't raise it the down round, they go, they go under.
00:51:36.422 - 00:52:06.776, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the first thing to say is that there aren't a lot of founders who are there right now. There's again, because so many people have raised so much capital, it's really only the very capital intensive businesses that need to raise money now. Now, eventually a lot of companies are going to be there, but there's a strong impulse to not be the first. Right. So I can guarantee you, if Blockfi is raising right now at a billion, it's not because they want to. They are probably backed into a corner and they have to raise right now. And so they're raising at a very tough time.
00:52:06.776 - 00:52:46.370, Speaker B: They don't have a lot of leverage. They're not fielding inbound demand, but instead they're going out to investors and saying, hey, I'm in a tough spot. I need to raise money right now. The folks who are raising into a strong environment where there's actually demand from investors as opposed to their demand for capital, they're seeing much less aggressive markdowns than the folks who are going to be forced to come out to market right now. And that's one of the reasons why the standard advice that we're giving to founders is, hey, cut your burn, extend your Runway. Make sure that you don't have to raise, because if you have to raise, you are going to get very punitive terms compared to the person who is enticed to raise by getting an unsolicited offer. So back in the bull market, everybody was getting unsolicited offers.
00:52:46.370 - 00:53:23.104, Speaker B: It was just the job of a VC was to go and think of, hey, who do I think is really interesting? And then go try to give them a term sheet. And in an environment like what we're seeing right now, very, very different dynamics. So the number one goal is don't get there in the first place. Don't be in a situation where you need to raise money. Once you do need to raise money, over the next three to six months, we're going to see down rounds become more normalized. Being the first person to do a down round, it's like, it's very kind of walk a shame, right? Like everybody's going to report on it. I mean, you can see how much glee there is in the market talking about, ha ha ha, blockfi, they're raising a down round, it's over, blah, blah, blah, which is whatever market's going to do.
00:53:23.104 - 00:53:57.794, Speaker B: What market's going to do. The reality is we're going to see a lot of down rounds of this size or even worse than this over time. Some of them are going to be quiet. A lot of them are obviously not going to want to announce just because down rounds are not sexy. Nobody wants to trumpet that they did a down round. And so you're not necessarily even going to see a lot of the announcements come out in the public about these down rounds. They might get reported on after the fact, but at the end of the day, the reality is that the number one job of a founder is to keep the company alive until you can get to the promised land.
00:53:57.794 - 00:54:37.534, Speaker B: And the promised land might be waiting until you get to the next bull market, or until you ship that one product, or until you expand into this market that you think is going to help you dominate. But you do what you need to do in order to keep the company alive. And that may mean a combination of financing that may lower your net valuation, but it also may mean, again, finding things to cut your burn, which may be letting people go, which may be cutting salaries, which may be a lot of things that people have not even wanted to contemplate for over a decade. But we'll start seeing it, especially in a lot of the companies in crypto that have been overfunded that don't really have product market fit.
00:54:38.274 - 00:54:44.614, Speaker A: What is the psychology inside of a company when you raise a down round? What is the spiraling effect that happens.
00:54:45.634 - 00:55:12.294, Speaker B: When you raise a down round? Everything in venture conspires to make down rounds hard. That's why most often when you see markets go down instead of seeing a slew of down rounds, if you're a public company, the moment the market goes down, you're worth less. And so everybody just gets it all at once. It's one big pill to swallow. It's like, oh, okay, well, people who had options are down. People at rsus, their packages are worth less. The executives have, their net worth has decreased materially.
00:55:12.294 - 00:55:17.906, Speaker B: But it's done. It's done in a day. And nobody has any delusions about what's going on in a public company.
00:55:18.090 - 00:55:23.494, Speaker A: And your competitors are down the same amount. Right? I'm Lyft and I'm down 40%. Well, that's fine, because Uber is down 40% too.
00:55:23.554 - 00:56:06.384, Speaker B: So it's like, yeah, and everyone, I mean, hopefully, yeah, you hope. You hope that your competitors are also down the same amount, or maybe more than you, but in a private company, when the market goes down, you're still kind of in suspended animation. Everyone can sort of imagine in their heads that they're not underwater. Or it's like, okay, well, maybe if we raise our next round in two years and the market comes back, then nobody will be underwater and nobody has stick write downs, and nobody is, nobody's at zero. Everyone is still above their strike price. When a lot of people's packages, especially because in startups, people generally don't get rsus in the early stages of a startup, they often get options. And if you have options, then your strike price really matters.
00:56:06.384 - 00:56:57.596, Speaker B: If the company has materially decreased in value, literally, you might be at zero. If the company goes public today, you make zero, you make nothing. That can cause a lot of people, if they can actually do the math, to want to leave. It also means that the founders own materially less of the company in the down round, because of course the preference stack starts to really grow because the series A investors get their money back, the series B investors get their money back, especially in the down run. Oftentimes you see structure introduced into a deal. I don't think we've seen any of this in crypto yet, but there's a good chance that we will at some point, especially in the later stage stuff, that there may be situations where there's a guaranteed payback to some of the later stage investors, in which case it becomes really, really hard for the founders to even own enough of the company to make an exit material, even if they come out at flat. So all that stuff makes it hard and harder and harder and harder.
00:56:57.596 - 00:57:38.960, Speaker B: For all the normal effects of a startup, which make everything at a startup accelerated, everything at a startup moves faster, everybody's more excited, everyone's making money quick. It goes in the opposite direction in a down round period, which is why very often in a down round, you have to go out and make fresh equity grants. You have to go out and figure out how do we keep the incentives still working in the down round so that everyone's still incentivized. Oftentimes it means that the previous round investors might have to go down a bit just to keep the company alive and make sure that the down round investors actually feel like there's a cap table that's workable for the whole thing to make sense. So that's why down rounds are hard. There's so many things you need to solve in order to make a down round even work. Whereas in an upround, everything's designed for up rounds.
00:57:38.960 - 00:57:47.826, Speaker B: Everyone's happy, everyone's making money. Exactly. Everyone's happy, everyone's making money. But it's like maybe this, maybe that, but like, fundamentally it's easy to get a deal done. Down rounds are painful.
00:57:48.010 - 00:57:52.594, Speaker A: Nice press release. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Tom, do you have anything to add to that?
00:57:52.754 - 00:58:34.230, Speaker C: No, I agree. I think we're actually putting out a blog post sooner and hiring in a bear market as well, and sort of talking about, I think the big issue is just around talent retention. Like, as Haseep said, like, if you're doing a big down round, like just due to liquidation preferences, like your equity in the company as an employee might be like totally wiped out. You might be a zero at this point, or maybe it's down 80 90%. And I think when that happens, as a founder, you have to lean on two things. One is company culture. Have you built an amazing place to work with great people that are really motivated about solving you, working on the right problems? I can say when I was at Zero X, we had actually zero attrition during the bear market up until 2020 when people started to leave and start to build new things and new products and stuff like that.
00:58:34.230 - 00:59:04.654, Speaker C: But I think it was a testament to the fact that the people who were there really wanted to be there and they had a great time working there and a great time building new products, even if maybe their token grant was down 80 90% or something like that. But yeah, I think the other component is just prioritizing health of the company as well. It's painful to do some of these things, but ultimately I think it's better for people to take a cut versus have it busy at a zero, had the company shut down or something like that.
00:59:05.714 - 00:59:39.114, Speaker A: I think the last thing to just touch on here, guys, is one thing that one of you mentioned at the very beginning of this conversation, which is it becomes difficult when you've got the private equity is stacked really high, or is the value of the private equity is really high, but then public tokens are down like 90%. But you guys are VC's and investors and you want to support the private side of things, but obviously you need to return capital to to your lp's. So how do you think about when just capitulated public tokens become too enticing not to just load up on some of the public tokens?
00:59:39.494 - 01:00:23.196, Speaker B: Well, so it depends on the structure of your fund. So our venture fund is constrained from investing into public, so we can't just go buy stuff on Coinbase. Now that being said, I do think what you're going to see over time is that the market will equilibrate because it always does. That's how economics works. So if you wait long enough, eventually people who have unrealistic expectations of outcomes will start to reprice things and you'll see a different regime with respect to pricing. Right now, like we said, some seed rounds are being priced much more favorably, so we're seeing things come down 50 60% in terms of seed round pricing. But some folks are like, hey, I had a term sheet just two months ago at 50 million, so I want 35.
01:00:23.196 - 01:01:03.136, Speaker B: And some people will probably get those rounds done. But I think the longer you wait, I mean, again, assuming the market doesn't rebound, which in the short run, I'm not expecting any really impressive rebounds. Unless the market rebounds pretty soon, eventually, at some point, people will just get the message about what the new price levels are. And the same thing happened in 2018. It took a while to see the market adjust to the fact that, hey, yeah, the bull market's over. Uh, people are not expecting just, you know, automatically making money, investing in this thing at 50 or 100 million FTV anymore. And once, once we internalize that, the market is going to adjust.
01:01:03.136 - 01:01:36.474, Speaker B: So in the seed round, it's easy because seed round, you haven't raised any money before. So starting at 20, we're starting at 30, we're starting at 40. It's kind of like, okay, it's just a number. It doesn't really affect anything. Like we said, it's in the later rounds where it starts to really affect things, and you've built up all this cruft that gets affected by around being materially higher or materially lower than what you were otherwise expecting. But the reality is people are really, people are naturally really industrious. So in a bear market, what you find is that in a bull market, a lot more money gets raised, but it doesn't mean a lot more stuff gets done.
01:01:36.474 - 01:02:19.964, Speaker B: Very often, a lot more money gets raised and it gets mostly wasted or just spent on incentives that don't really go very far, or it gets air dropped, to Tom's point, and people just start finding ways to spend money. But in bear markets, I would say that the last bear market was incredibly productive. Pretty much everything in DeFi was built in the last bear market, and people just have a lot of ingenuity. And the most valuable stuff, the most important stuff, the most important hires, the most important ideas are the ones you do first. That's another part of the reason why I'm actually not that worried that projects that we're not going to see as much progress because there's not as much money in the space. Because usually the extra money that comes in at a bull market doesn't end up accomplishing a whole lot compared to what the baseline of funding already accomplishes.
01:02:20.944 - 01:02:56.484, Speaker A: What is the relative to 2018? We can wrap it with this two part question here. I want to get both your guys take on this. The first part of the question is, relative to 2018 2019, what will the severity of this bear market look like? And the second part is, I'm assuming you guys have a lot of founders who get on the horn with you? And they say, hazee tomorrow. I'm trying to prep, I'm trying to cut burn, I'm trying to figure out what we should do with our product strategy and refocus the company. But like, how bad is this bear market going to be? Like how long is this going to be? And so I think there's a, maybe it's, maybe it's just one question here around, like the length of the bear market and the severity of the bear market, so.
01:02:58.944 - 01:03:08.144, Speaker B: I can start and give Tom the last word on the length and severity of the bear market. The only honest answer is that no one knows. The reality is that.
01:03:08.224 - 01:03:11.204, Speaker A: But that doesn't make for a good podcast answer.
01:03:12.104 - 01:03:46.320, Speaker B: I know, I know, but look, if somebody claims they know how long the bear market is, they're either bullshitting you or they're bullshitting themselves. Nobody knows, right? That's why it's a market. And the overall picture that I would get is that, look, unless we see some kind of exogenous shock or something that really, really ticks off in crypto in a surprising way, I think it's unlikely that we're going to see a lot of positive accelerants for crypto in the next six to twelve months. Right now, macro is dominating the picture. And most people who are looking at macros say, look, we might skate by without a recession. That's the most that we can hope for. But beyond that, the picture doesn't look amazing.
01:03:46.320 - 01:04:11.166, Speaker B: Inflation is still at roughly a 40 year high. Supply chain issues are bad. There's a war in eastern Europe. China is just now starting to come out of these massive COVID lockdowns. It's a bad year for growth across the world. And we're seeing consumer savings, like household savings, down massively from where it was a couple of years ago. And interest rates are higher, so there's less demand for speculation, less demand for day trading.
01:04:11.166 - 01:04:33.856, Speaker B: All these exchanges around the world are seeing less retail inflows. So all of that should tell you that, hey, it's not a great look, and crypto is somewhat reflexive. So I would say you should be prepared for this to be up to 18 months. Will it actually be 18 months? Who the hell knows? It could be longer than that. It could be much shorter. It could be over in two months. And then the war in Ukraine is over.
01:04:33.856 - 01:04:45.324, Speaker B: And then turns out the next CPI print is really low. And then Fed's like, okay, great, we can avoid a recession. Rates go back down and everyone's happy and bitcoin bumps, so it's impossible to say because it involves predicting so much about the world.
01:04:45.664 - 01:04:54.264, Speaker A: Tom, any insights that are. I don't know if you have any more, like, specific insights or a little more clarity or maybe a magic ball that tells us exactly where this goes.
01:04:54.304 - 01:04:56.910, Speaker B: Yeah, Tom definitely has that, but he just been hiding it from me.
01:04:57.032 - 01:04:57.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I got it.
01:04:58.042 - 01:05:00.334, Speaker A: That's why everyone's got the magic ball. It's not.
01:05:01.394 - 01:05:30.642, Speaker C: I mean, I agree with a lot of that. I do also think it's important to emphasize, just like, this looks very different than 2018, where there was, like, literally nothing. Instead, we have tens of billions of dollars in stable coins. These indexes are doing hundreds of millions of dollars a day in volume. There's real stuff going on. And I think one thing I also have to say is crypto only ratchets up. Um, like, if you look at talent inflows into the space, capital inflows into the space, companies who are looking to integrate crypto into their product lines, uh, the amount of.
01:05:30.642 - 01:05:49.884, Speaker C: Amount of funding, it just constantly kind of always itches inches up a little bit. Um, and I think if you zoom out like, that, overall is super bullish. It's like, um, you know, it's also sort of like, don't. Don't fade the youth. Um, if you look at sort of where, you know, younger people are interested, where they're excited about working, whether. Excited about working on what? Excited about using. It's crypto.
01:05:49.884 - 01:06:15.514, Speaker C: And ultimately, there's sort of this sad component that society doesn't progress by six year old people deciding that bitcoin is great all of a sudden by them retiring and dying and young people replacing them. And I think it's really hard to sort of. It's really important to remember that and remember that the youth are sort of the future. And I think that's kind of where I see most of the crypto bullshit is coming from.
01:06:15.604 - 01:06:21.142, Speaker A: Yeah. Isn't there a really depressing quote? It's something like, innovation happens one death at a time or something of that sort.
01:06:21.158 - 01:06:21.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:06:21.374 - 01:06:28.382, Speaker A: So awesome. Well, this has been a really enjoyable conversation. Hope you guys enjoyed it. And as always, thanks for coming on.
01:06:28.398 - 01:06:31.190, Speaker B: Empire, guys, thanks for having us. Jason, thanks.
01:06:31.262 - 01:06:31.934, Speaker A: All right, be well.
