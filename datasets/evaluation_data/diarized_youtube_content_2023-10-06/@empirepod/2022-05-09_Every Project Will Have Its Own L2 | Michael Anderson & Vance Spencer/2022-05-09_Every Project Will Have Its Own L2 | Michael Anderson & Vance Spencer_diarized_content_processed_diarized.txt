00:00:00.360 - 00:00:07.918, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various Dexs. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:08.046 - 00:00:36.304, Speaker B: Every developer is going to choose more utility versus less for their coin, and that will eventually meet building their own l two once they quote unquote outgrow ethereum. The monolithic model of Solana is just fundamentally bearish in this paradigm where you assume that these things grow large enough that they want to have and own their own communities. I think broadly, Michael and I would say that we're definitely ETH bulls, but more so than that, we're just like modular blockchain bulls. And I think that's really kind of where the future goes over the long term.
00:00:43.844 - 00:01:09.348, Speaker A: All right, everyone, back with another episode of Empire. We are joined by two of my favorite people at one of my favorite funds in the industry, Michael and Vance at framework ventures. They started with $14 million a couple of years ago and have turned that into more than 1.4 billion. They're coming off the back of a massive fundraise from their third fund. It was an oversubscribed third fund where they raised $400 million. Really excited to chat Defi gaming.
00:01:09.348 - 00:01:15.380, Speaker A: They just had some bold predictions they put on their website, so I'm sure we'll get into those. Michael and Vance, welcome to the show, guys.
00:01:15.572 - 00:01:16.700, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:01:16.812 - 00:01:18.268, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. Glad to be here.
00:01:18.396 - 00:01:48.956, Speaker A: Long course it is. It is. All right, so I had this whole outline shout out to our podcast producer Garrett. He put together this entire outline on Defi and gaming and all that stuff. But then obviously over the weekend, massive thing happened. Yuga Labs launched their land sale. Total debaucherous moment, I would say, in the space for NFTs and for crypto and Vance, you had this great tweet on this where you said you were talking about just like, what should Yugalabs do, right? One of Yuga Labs tweets was, sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.
00:01:48.956 - 00:02:20.966, Speaker A: It seems abundantly clear that apecoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. We'd like to encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction. And Vance, you commented on that and you said, okay, starknet dy DX style instance is not really ready. Appchain is too hard to build. Economically secure validator set. Forking in l two is basically the only way to do this safely and effectively at scale. So I just want to get your take on just this whole yuga labs, like bored ape debacle and then getting into tying that into just how should someone like Yuga think about scaling?
00:02:21.110 - 00:03:06.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure. I believe kind of the crypto Twitter machiavellian conspiracy theory of they planned it this way. They specifically designed the sale to clog the chain so that they could make rationale for their movement and their own chain as well. But if you really do break it down, there are no good solutions to do this. If you want to build an application chain on cosmos, building an economically secure validation set, building all the bridging tools, building all of the infrastructure that you need, that's non trivial and that'll take you probably a few years where you could just be doing what your business is meant to do, which is putting out core ip. So that's kind of off the table. If you look at building a starknet DYDX instance that just isn't ready, you're going to have to write it in Cairo.
00:03:06.314 - 00:03:31.252, Speaker B: That's off the table as well. And similar to immutable x, it has the same problems at the moment, which is the technology isn't really ready. You're relying on a lot of externalities that aren't core to your business. That's a big problem. Really. What we see is one of the bigger trends this year is just the forking of l two s. You can see this if you look on the l two beat website, and it has Metis and I think Boba is another one.
00:03:31.252 - 00:04:14.778, Speaker B: But these are forks of, I think, optimism. And then they have a lot of TVL and they're just able to spin themselves up and they're able to work correctly and they don't have to build any other infrastructure tooling really. I think the yuga labs is an interesting proof point of just play it out. What would you actually do? There are no good solutions other than forking l two s. And I think this is really bullish for the Ethereum Internet thesis, where you just have this web of chains that has this economically secure validator set that's backed up by ethel one. And Ethereum is this very it's not too hot, it's not too cold, it's too decentralized at the base chain for you to really build an application on. And so it provides you a fertile ground to launch an l two where you can have your own native token, you ever can have your own ecosystem.
00:04:14.778 - 00:04:22.514, Speaker B: It is this perfect amalgamation of economic security, but also optionality on the second layer. We expect to see a lot of that.
00:04:22.674 - 00:04:36.574, Speaker A: Michael, you guys have invested in. I think it's over 75 companies now. A lot of those are built on ETH. As these projects get almost. I'm putting quotes around this, too big for Ethereum. Where do you recommend that they go? What are their action items there?
00:04:37.074 - 00:05:17.726, Speaker C: One of the things that maybe differentiates us from most other funds is that, of course, we've invested a lot in ETH. We've also invested on cosmos projects, and we've definitely invested in projects that are building on top of Solana and now avalanche more so. But frankly, for us, it's really about where the entrepreneurs choose to go. Obviously, we have perspectives and we have insight, and we can give advice and we can advise on different trade offs and different ways to think about the different chains and layer two, layer one, subnet base layer, et cetera. And so we spend a lot of time kind of going through that idea maze with entrepreneurs. But frankly, we're not wedded to one. We're not wedded to one concept versus another.
00:05:17.726 - 00:06:03.206, Speaker C: Historically, yes, it has been Ethereum, and more so now it's been more optimism. Arbitrum immutable, which are layer two solutions for Ethereum. So we consider those to be in the same family. But generally, if you need really high transaction throughput and you need maybe not as much security, there are other chains like Solana and potentially avalanche, that are maybe more akin to what you're trying to build. And so it comes down to two things. What are you trying to build, and how do you think about it? And then where does the entrepreneur have an insight or have some desire to go? And one of the things that I also think is kind of interesting is we're starting to see what might be a multi chain approach to architecture design, where you're not fully built on one chain. Maybe you have aspects that are built on Solana because higher transactions group it.
00:06:03.206 - 00:06:25.154, Speaker C: Maybe the economy or the token needs to live on Ethereum because it needs more security. And maybe there's part of it that's even centralized because you can't have per transaction costs. I think if you squint to the future, the architecture design of the future adapts, doesn't look exactly like we've seen over the past two years. And so that's just something that we're tracking as well.
00:06:26.134 - 00:07:00.344, Speaker B: The other thing just to add onto that is if you build on the EVM, let's say you build on ETH l one and your yuga labs. Moving to nl two is trivial compared to the alternative of moving to your own chain. You have the same EVM toolset, you're able to migrate pretty seamlessly. We saw axie do that with Ronin and it wasn't world ending for their community. And so that's a feasible option. If you build on something like Solana, you're there for better or for worse, for the long term. And there is no concept of an l two for Solana yet.
00:07:00.344 - 00:07:36.496, Speaker B: And they're still on this monolithic structure and architecture, and I think that's great. But long term, I think a lot of the plays for these companies are let's build our own little mini garden of this ecosystem that we have our own native token for. And that native token serves a higher purpose than just incentivizing the community to do things. It serves as auctioning off MeV sequencer spots for that l two. And so just, it seems like a much more robust approach in the short term. And really we think all of the major applications for the most part, are going to be built in the next three years. And Ethereum just has the highest credibility scaling Redmap, especially over the weekend when Solana goes down.
00:07:36.496 - 00:07:39.680, Speaker B: It just highlights how nascent a lot of this tech is.
00:07:39.832 - 00:07:52.674, Speaker A: Why would you fork the l two though? Why so optimism? Obviously had their big announcement last week with their token and a lot of eyes on optimism. Why couldn't they just go build on something like arbitrum or optimism? Why would you fork the l two?
00:07:53.214 - 00:08:51.676, Speaker C: I think you can do either one. And frankly, it might be a staging process where you start off built on top of a layer two solution to build the community base, build the application base. And then once you hit scale and your single application becomes sort of a universe of applications, it becomes an economic tool that you can use. If you have your own layer two solution where you get to to change the configuration of how transactions are customized, you understand more about how people are using your application. So you can build a custom tooling solution for that universe of applications. But to Vance's point, you have this token that isn't just something that's a governance token, isn't just something that's used for transactions back and forth on top of a layer two, it's actually used for the security of your ecosystem, of your universe. Having your own token that has the multivariate possibilities of what that token is useful for and the value that you can describe to that, I think becomes a core advantage over the long run.
00:08:51.676 - 00:09:06.468, Speaker C: In the same way that Salesforce is a single application that turns into an API layer, I think you're going to start to see the new API layer as new layer two solutions that are custom built for these universe of applications.
00:09:06.636 - 00:09:23.380, Speaker A: That's a really interesting thesis. Then where does the value accrue? Because I'm thinking about something that. Shoot. Who said this? Kyle? I think it was Kyle Simone. He said l two s are parasitic to l one s because the layer two stakers actually determine the ordering. And that layer two stakers get Mev. I think.
00:09:23.380 - 00:09:47.184, Speaker A: I think I'm quoting him right. L two stakers get the Mev and l one stakers don't. Vance, if I understand your thesis correctly, and Michael too, I'm assuming you guys are in agreement here, you guys think that the winning l two is eventually going to be the one that kind of best captures and allocates this mev to the community, and that l two s will actually capture a lot of the value. So is Kyle wrong here?
00:09:47.264 - 00:10:27.744, Speaker B: No, I think that's exactly like, I think your description is exactly right. Like, look at all of what optimism's basically economic marketing is. It's we're going to capture the meV, we're going to distribute into public goods funding, we're going to build bootstrap and fund initiatives that better the overall l two that can better Ethereum in turn. That is the overall prognosis for what these l two s will do. And sure, fees will go down by ten x from l one to l two, and people will migrate, but the overall universe of people that can use these things will go up by 100 x. It's not just about oh my God, fees are just going to be parasitic and decreased because there's going to be cannibalization. You're actually growing the market.
00:10:27.744 - 00:10:58.204, Speaker B: That's the first thing. Just to double down on what Michael said earlier, apecoin. We don't hold any aboard apes in the fund, but think about apecoin. It's a little bit silly right now. It's just this coin that exists in the ether to incentivize people to do basically nothing. It's used for, I guess, paying for land and other side things like that. But once you actually have utility for this thing, then it becomes disproportionately valuable as something that's core to the security of the chain, the community, etcetera.
00:10:58.204 - 00:11:26.976, Speaker B: Every developer is going to choose more utility versus less for their coin and now will eventually meet building their own l two once they quote unquote outgrow ethereum. The monolithic model of Solana is just fundamentally bearish in this paradigm where you assume that these things grow large enough that they want to have and own their own communities. I think broadly, Michael and I would say that we're definitely ETH bulls, but more so than that, we're just modular blockchain bulls. And I think that's really where the future goes over the long term.
00:11:27.160 - 00:12:05.282, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like the narrative and the big conversation. The big question back, maybe, let's say, let's take it back 24 months, was will we live in a multi chain future? Maybe 18 months ago, everyone's like, will we live in a multi chain future? And now everyone says, I think kind of the agreement, maybe you guys disagree with this, is that okay, we will live in a multi chain future, but what does scaling look like? And maybe what does interoperability look look like? I think there's a lot of focus on something like Avalanche's subnets. There's kind of this renewed interest in Cosmos app chains. What does maybe, Michael, I'd go to you, what does the future of, just like the multi chain future look, it's.
00:12:05.298 - 00:13:21.570, Speaker C: A broad question and I think it's going to take a ton of different forms. And if we think about the diversity of potential applications that we're talking about, extend the vision of blockchains into the future at a certain scale, and you start to basically have every single type of application, anything from really robust financial services to consumer social media applications and everything in between, chat, commerce, content, basically anything that really revolves around consumer and the Internet usage that we see today, those patterns are going to be built, or at least tested on blockchains. And so I think it really depends, going back to what I was saying earlier, it really depends on what the application needs. And so if you have the liquidity aggregating on one chain, the security because of higher prices, higher cost aggregating on one chain, you're going to want to be able to access that chain while you're also going to have lower security, lower cost needs. And it's similar in the same application that will have to be aggregated on a different chain. And so that right there implies that we're going to have interoperability in a multi chain world just in that one application instance. I think what we're going to see is right now, obviously, it's pretty negative in terms of the bridging ecosystem out there.
00:13:21.570 - 00:14:09.026, Speaker C: I think one of the things, and this may be a little bit counter perspective, but one of the things that I think actually will alleviate a lot of the stress of layer twos is centralized bridges. We still have yet to see Coinbase come out and build a bridge to arbitrage optimism. As soon as you have that onboarding into the layer two ecosystem is how basically everybody that I know got into crypto. Originally you pull your ETH off of Coinbase and you put it into a metamask wallet, and now you're a defi. I think the same thing is going to happen with layer twos. And so as we start to see more value and trust build between the different chains, we're going to start to see the actual technical solutions of robust bridging interoperability. IBC become just as viable as the centralized options and trustworthy as the centralized options.
00:14:09.026 - 00:14:18.474, Speaker C: I think that's we're really going to see these interoperability solutions come about. But to go back to the original question, it's absolutely going to be something that's multi chain. It just really depends on the application.
00:14:18.634 - 00:14:26.986, Speaker A: For the centralized bridges. Do you mean something like what FTX does with wormhole where you can withdraw your portal wrapped assets from FTX into wormhole?
00:14:27.050 - 00:14:31.952, Speaker C: Exactly. Yep. We just haven't seen anything on top of ETH. Layer two.
00:14:32.138 - 00:14:32.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:33.684 - 00:15:24.744, Speaker B: One of the interesting things just on that topic is when we were talking to Maple about basically for the people who don't know, Maple is a decentralized borrow lend desk for crypto native borrower lenders. It's basically a capital market solution where they have a pool that underwrites risk for a given counterparty. They'll look at their balance sheet, they decide to give them a loan and they'll do it under collateralized. They'll do it at more competitive rates than people like Genesis, and they're just growing like an absolute weed. They were going to expand to Solana. One of the questions was, should we just have maple exist on Ethereum and we can give out loans and people can bridge and do whatever they want because there's a big Solana community who wants a lot of capital as well. But really, the thing that we found out in talking to institutions and also just using these things ourselves is that people are not willing to use bridges in an institutional capacity.
00:15:24.744 - 00:15:57.410, Speaker B: That is the highest vector for you getting hacked on any given month, day, week, year. It is just an absurd amount of risk that is fundamentally bearish for this multi chain architecture that exists outside of something that's economically secured by the same validator set. That's just a lot of our perspective on where things go is that bridges are just absolute nightmares when it comes to security. We haven't found a security model that works for us yet in actually building things that span multiple chains that are not EVM based or at least share the same economic validator set.
00:15:57.532 - 00:16:15.510, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys have these amazing predictions on your website. When you announce the new, the $400 million fund, you also put up a bunch of predictions. 2030 predictions, bold move, making predictions. Ten years out, eight years out. And we'll link it in the show notes. If you guys want to actually read all of them. One of the predictions was a $10 billion on chain.
00:16:15.510 - 00:16:24.344, Speaker A: I think it was a $10 billion on chain hack will occur. Does this come from a bridge, do you think, or what? What is that 10 billion hacking dollar hack look like?
00:16:26.884 - 00:17:09.292, Speaker C: Very good question as well. I mean, really kind of the intention behind that and the intention behind basically all of these is it's really easy to kind of look forward in a couple of months or a couple of quarters increments and predict what's going to happen and generally directionally what's going to be the end state of the world after that time period. It's really, really hard to predict years. And if you look backwards in time over crypto and Defi, it just moves at exponential scale. A lot of these are really just extrapolating forward the continued exponential or nonlinear growth that we've seen so far. I don't know if we've actually had an official billion dollar hack. Ronin might be the biggest one with the 600 plus million.
00:17:09.292 - 00:17:48.594, Speaker C: But if you take that and you extrapolate forward a couple of years, it could be a bridge. If that's where the aggregate value in a decentralized ecosystem with smart contracts is being most used, then that's probably the biggest honey pot that you can imagine. And so that's where bridges fail currently. But if we take that and think about where that value aggregates, eventually it could be in a staking contract. It could be in something like an amm. It really just depends. What we're really doing here with all of these predictions is just extrapolating forward and putting something out there that says, hey, this is the scale that we're going to be getting to in the next 3458 years.
00:17:48.594 - 00:17:56.634, Speaker C: And so we need to think about how to protect ourselves or how to live in a world which has this level of, on all of these predictions, this level of scale.
00:17:56.794 - 00:18:23.234, Speaker A: Yeah, let's pivot a bit from talking about scaling and talking about staking maybe a week or two. Lido, I feel like people were, I don't know, I feel like everyone loves lido. And then people were kind of turning on Lido. On Twitter the other day, maybe a week or two ago, and I just want to get your guys take right. 30% of ETH right now is staked via Lido, and Lido has something like 85% to 90% of the liquid staking market. Is Lido's dominance a threat to ETH at all?
00:18:24.894 - 00:18:54.352, Speaker B: So let me just back up to the controversy that was happening. I think it started with Kobe is obviously a member or founding team of Lido. And Ryan Berkman's great guy. He's very pro Ethereum and has led a lot of the research and analysis around ETH as an asset. And I think what he was trying to say and it got a little garbled. And Kobe's a great guy. I don't think he has any he's Solana funded, I think was the kind of metaphor that they were using.
00:18:54.352 - 00:19:57.322, Speaker B: But I think what Brian was trying to say is that, hey, there's a lot of concentration here in Lido, both from a smart contract standpoint, if that contract were to get hacked, but also from just a client diversity standpoint in terms of the people actually operating these different seeking instances, that there's probably a pretty healthy market for being number two. And in all software categories, really what you see is you see the premium brand, who's run away with the market, who's captured most of the customers that everyone hates, and then there's somebody who comes second and who's maybe a lower cost, maybe a little bit lower brand. But being number two is actually a huge market opportunity. I'm glad that people have started to throw spaghetti in terms of, ok, how much do we hate Lido? Maybe actually a decent amount. Maybe there's a robust and healthy market for the second competitor. And I think they're coming. Frankly, Lido has just had such a head start and nobody really thought that Ethereum staking would be quite as large as it is today, that they were just beneficiaries from that first run, and they're going to go multi chain, they're going to spread their efforts, they're going to spread their focus, and they will naturally emerge the second spot.
00:19:57.322 - 00:20:13.178, Speaker B: We've certainly been active in funding a lot of people who are trying different staking derivatives and will be active in putting our capital behind them. We're looking forward to making this a horse race. The whole drama was basically there is a market for number two and there isn't one, and there should be.
00:20:13.306 - 00:20:33.458, Speaker A: I mean, it kind of reminds me of just the. This might be an overused analogy, but like the cloud wars, right? When AWS launched, like, people didn't realize there was even a market for it. And today it's $180 billion market. AWS obviously dominates. They have 33% of the market. Then Azure has something like 20%. But then you've got a bunch of little players that have like between five and 10%.
00:20:33.458 - 00:20:41.704, Speaker A: You've got Google Cloud and Alibaba and IBM and Salesforce and, and tencent and like, look, 5% of $180 billion market, not too shabby.
00:20:42.084 - 00:21:27.422, Speaker C: The public cloud market and dynamics that have happened over the last, call it 15 years probably is exactly the way that we think about it. I think we both agree that there's probably going to be like three to four, maybe two to three really large winners here. Lido is obviously a success case here. Rocketpool is definitely coming at number two right now. And I think there's going to be other solutions, some of which, as Vance alluded to that we funded, that are going to be right up there as well, if not surpassing some of them. And I think the second place is definitely valuable, third place is valuable, potentially fourth place as well. But I also think we're about to go into an era of post merge ETH where not just any of these winners, but the entire ecosystem is going to grow in the same way that you see the public cloud take off over the last 15 years.
00:21:27.422 - 00:21:59.854, Speaker C: And as we start to realize that ETH two is happening, proof of stake is going to happen. And as these institutions and many of which we've talked to, need to move away from Lido or have diversification of their liquid staking operations, whether it be it from some internal rule that they have or internal diversification requirement or just like a natural sense of decentralization. And so I think you're going to start to see this become a forcing function over time into the number two, number three, number four, will this look.
00:21:59.894 - 00:22:17.154, Speaker A: Like one or two companies come out and try to compete with them, either centralized companies or kind of defi, or decentralized companies, or is this almost something that really doesn't exist yet, an association or a bunch of them band together to almost take on Lido?
00:22:17.614 - 00:22:46.474, Speaker B: I think you're going to see all flavors of go to market strategy. You're going to have the populist frog nation style. We're going to really decentralize staking this time for the people. Who knows if that'll work, but they'll be aggressive. They'll be throwing tokens at it. There's an appetite for that type of go to market. Then there's going to be the centralized companies that just go to whoever's doing the Ethereum ETF when it comes out, and they say, listen, we're going to stake your assets super safe in a custodial environment.
00:22:46.474 - 00:23:16.820, Speaker B: Obviously, they're going to be a big player. You're going to see the whole rainbow. I also think you're just going to see you have this thing where you obviously create a decentralized staking derivative, and then you have that. It's in Defi, you can do something with it. You can go and bootstrap different ecosystems. You can go and incorporate that into the treasuries of all these different projects. There's just so many different ways to get distribution for these things that I think we're going to see probably even more fragmentation than we see in the cloud market, just because there are just frankly more levers that you can pull.
00:23:16.820 - 00:23:26.260, Speaker B: Centralized, decentralized, populist, very enterprise, go to market. There's just infinite diversification that you can have in how these companies operate.
00:23:26.412 - 00:23:30.396, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you go deeper on staking derivatives and just explain to folks what that means?
00:23:30.540 - 00:24:16.944, Speaker C: Yeah. A staking derivative is essentially in the form of lido. For instance, when you stake one ETH into the pool, you get a steth staking derivative back. That staking derivative, in particular with lido, rebases. So Steth rebases and increases the number of Steth that you have based on the amount of returns that you get from the staking that's going on from your ETH actually, on a validator set right now. And so right now, I can't remember off the top of my head, I think it's about five or 6% yield for anyone who's staking within the, the validator set, within the initial testnet for ETH two. But the expectation is that post merge, that staking rate actually goes up to somewhere around eight to 12%.
00:24:16.944 - 00:24:36.962, Speaker C: You could actually see a doubling of the amount of return that you get. Another liquidity sync, another reason to stake when you actually see massive return potential in the form of ETH. But a staking derivative is really just a way of capturing that. The derivative token itself is really dependent on the platform that you're choosing. That's the one specifically how Lido works.
00:24:37.058 - 00:25:20.534, Speaker A: Michael, you were talking about the ETH merge, so we just had Travis Kling on the episode. If you guys haven't heard it yet, you guys should definitely listen to it. And he was talking about how he thinks that ETH is incredibly undervalued right now, and he's holding more ETH than he's held in a while because the merge will make it deflationary, a yield generating asset, and it will then kind of check the box on the ESG narrative that institutions need to start allocating capital, real capital, to Ethereum. Like kind of similar to what happened two years ago when Paul Tudor Jones started allocating to bitcoin, called bitcoin the fastest horse in the race. That kind of took away the career risk for hedge funds to start allocating to bitcoin. He thinks that the merge is going to start will do the same thing for ethereum. So, Michael, in your mind, is the merge priced in right now?
00:25:21.314 - 00:26:13.892, Speaker C: Absolutely not. I think crypto in general, just a broad, universal statement, is some of the most inefficient markets that you could ever see. Solana is down 1% after being offline for 7 hours on a Saturday. The market is disconnected from network and network usage or network statistics. But no, frankly, I still get questions personally, like is ETH two going to happen? Is the merge actually going to happen? And these are people in the industry, some people, that should be knowledgeable about the status. If you follow any of the people on Twitter that are talking about this, there's tons of people, Tim, or anyone at EF is talking about the live updates of all of the different initiatives and time scales to actually get this thing live. It's going to happen in the next few months.
00:26:13.892 - 00:26:51.036, Speaker C: I think there's a lot of questions around what's the timeline for the Shanghai hard work afterwards where you can actually withdraw the ETH from the validators? There's questions around what the economic opportunity is going to be around ETH post merge. Is it really going to be as much transaction fees on ETH l one versus l two? There are obvious questions, but I think generally ETH too is not priced into ETH. And I fully agree with everything Travis talked about. The institutionalization of ETH as an asset becomes viable after the merge because it gets de risked. That is probably one of the biggest opportunities in any financial market that I've seen so far.
00:26:51.220 - 00:27:34.680, Speaker B: Keep in mind, staking was supposed to ship in 2016, so there's reason for people to not believe us. Basically, when it happens, I guess the proof is in the pudding. You'd also just be so surprised at how many people who run funds who are quote unquote subject matter experts just have no clue what is going on with Ethereum. I remember a fairly well known hedge fund manager was telling me that EIP 1559 would not happen because the miners would block it. Like what? It doesn't make any sense. If you spend at least ten minutes in this discord, you'll understand that that's just economically, mathematically not possible. And so there's just tons of alpha in this space still.
00:27:34.680 - 00:27:40.924, Speaker B: It's the world's least sophisticated market somehow with the most upside, and we're definitely beneficiaries of that.
00:27:41.784 - 00:28:10.564, Speaker A: Vance, you were nodding your head the entire time, pretty enthusiastically the entire time that Michael was talking there. If you're. I know both of you guys are incredibly excited about ETH. What are the high beta plays then that almost could outperform ETH? How do you look at that? How do you almost invest and allocate capital when you think that something like ETH, which almost becomes your base case, could three or four or five x, whatever you guys actually think there, how do you actually think about allocating capital to outperform ETH?
00:28:11.024 - 00:29:36.612, Speaker B: I think really what's going to happen with Ethereum is that it's going to prove to the rest of the world that staking is the birth of the merge, is the birth of an industry. When you see Ethereum spitting off between five and $10 billion of cash flow in a really good year, potentially even more than that, and it's returning basically all of it to stakeholders in the form of either burning it or direct yields. And we still don't know if that yield will be taxable. That court case that came out around how property is created in a staking context, it leaves the door open for a very favorable interpretation of the tax law when it comes to this. And so that combined with just the economic upside, people are just going to take a step back and say, okay, this is the major narrative that is playing out. Where can we find exposure to this other than Ethereum? Keep in mind, Ethereum will probably run at some point as this happens. Then it'll be like, okay, where is this yield going? Is Lido getting a slice of it? Is rocket pool getting a slice of it? What about subnets? What about avalanche? Is there yield there? How does this work? You're going to have this whole framework built around this in terms of how do we get access to staking yield that may be favorably taxed in an environment that's very high growth? I think things like the staking derivatives are obviously going to be quite successful projects that build staking derivatives into their own models, whether it be something like tribe putting a lot of its ETH into ETH, staking and obviously they have yield from that which they can then in turn put into the project.
00:29:36.612 - 00:30:24.758, Speaker B: Again, there's going to be this reflexivity that gets generated by people who have some tangential connection to staking, but every single project blockchain will integrate staking into what they're doing so they can pattern match this narrative. As you think about the last major waves of narrative rotation, like the l one s, the games, the things like that, it's probably going to shift towards an environment that's more judged on a fundamental basis as to how much cash flow are you accruing. And that's going to create, frankly, some of the first fundamental valuation models that we've seen in the space yet. It's going to be a different type of environment and it's going to be more institutional friendly, and you're going to have people that are able to allocate large dollar values into these staking networks. You're going to have a wind at your back, and that's always very important when you're investing.
00:30:24.886 - 00:30:57.420, Speaker A: Yeah. So you agree with someone like Jeff Dorman, who we also just had on the podcast. Folks should go listen to that if they haven't already. Jeff Dorman believes that right now there really aren't fundamental models in crypto, but eventually every asset class gets these fundamentals, whether it's like, oh yeah, pretty much any asset class eventually gets these asset models where right now if you gave like an asset to ten different analysts, they would value it in ten different ways. But if you give like just an equity to ten different analysts, they're all going to value it on some sort of discounted cash flow. So you guys think that this space eventually converges upon fundamentals?
00:30:57.612 - 00:31:31.876, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I think it was Ryan Berkman's who put it out. Ethereumcashflow.com dot you know, there have been some initial takes as to what the post merge DCF model for ethereum could be, and there's still a ton of variables, variables and assumptions that go into all of these models, just as any DCF would assume. But you can actually start to get some of the points filled as you start to see some of this stuff happen. Once the merge happens, we actually start to see what are transaction fees doing. What is the post merge burn looking like post EIP 1559 as well.
00:31:31.876 - 00:32:46.004, Speaker C: We can start to put into place some of the variables that are unknown at this point from there. This is one of the reasons why we believe that the institutionalization is going to happen. Clarity around what these models look like anyone who's an analyst at any bank or institution or fund who's looking at crypto and saying, okay, well, how can I know whether or not Ethereum is valued properly, or Ethereum is valued fairly right now, or if it's undervalued or overvalued? There's just going to be a market around predicting where Ethereum goes based off of the cash flows, because you get two forms of cash flows, whether it's a burn or it's basically a distribution from staking. The only variable that I think is going to be interesting going forward is it's not just owning ETH that gives you a right to that secondary cash flow of state returned assets in the form of basically a stock dividend. But if you are a stater and you do have access to staking products and staking services really at your hand very easily, then you can be someone who receives that as well. And so I think that's one of the reasons why we're also really bullish on staking derivatives and staking products and services. Because if you allow those to be easily accessible to institutions, it doesn't have to be something that's impossible for them to get access to.
00:32:46.004 - 00:32:54.076, Speaker C: I think there's just a lot of financial viability in terms of where this thing goes and the analysis that's going to go into it over the next twelve months.
00:32:54.260 - 00:34:18.448, Speaker B: The other thing I'll say about staking in the context of how we see the investing world evolving is this year is a great example of how investing is changing. And bonds have had their worst year in 40 years this year, and stocks have just gotten crushed right alongside them. There's this idea that maybe they aren't as uncorrelated as you might think, and maybe it's just not a holistic basket for how you might want to structure your entire net worth around these investments. If you think about how crypto evolves and how you can structure something like a total return, a fund that Bridgewater would put forth, maybe half of it, maybe 60% of it, is staking, where you have reliable yield that you can hedge out the risk of, and you can actually have that yield start to stack and build accretive value to your portfolio, potentially in a tax favorable environment. And then you have probably some assets that people can start to take fundamental views on that look a little bit more like how you trade equities, where it's like, okay, this company has x cash flow, we're looking at it growing at y rate, maybe it has z multiple, you can construct a total return portfolio that doesn't look like gambling or totally insane in the context of crypto. Once you have the staking derivative, that's a little bit more consistent yield. And so I think with this birth of an industry will also become the birth of just entirely new types of investors that are creating these new types of portfolio for folks based around something that's a little bit more fundamentally valued, but also that it just has yield coming directly from what you're staking.
00:34:18.576 - 00:34:36.544, Speaker A: If you are someone like Bridgewater and you want to actually allocate to staking assets or staking derivatives, are you going out and buying staked? Are you spinning up a pool on Lido, or what's the best way to allocate there? What are you actually doing? What are you guys seeing on the ground here?
00:34:39.764 - 00:35:30.716, Speaker B: What's going on right now is, let me tell you where I think the trade will be. I think the trade that a lot of institutions will put on is you buy ETH on Coinbase exchange, then Coinbase will assume that they'll have an institutional staking program at some point. Once Ethereum turns on you take your ETH, you stake it with Coinbase, they'll give you back your staked ETH derivative. In the case of Lido, it's steep. You take that steth, you send it to FTX, and you use that collateral to short the Ethereum perp. The future, what you have there is you're collecting yield from the ETH yield on that side, you're collecting yield from shorting the perp, and it usually pays you to go long the perp, and you're entirely hedged. Basically, what you have there is, and people are reducing the funding rates.
00:35:30.716 - 00:36:13.934, Speaker B: And so it looks more attractive to long ETH if you're not in this trade and you're just retail that's punting around, the entire dynamics of this space are going to change a lot once this trade is put on, and people are going to put it on in huge size, there's going to be squeezes where people run out of collateral to short the perp, and it'll exacerbate some of the moves in that regard. But that's the fundamental trade that people will put on, because it's Delta hedge. You can do it entirely custodial. In some contexts, that is where you get the most value for your buck. If you're an institution, it's harder. If you think back of you mentioned Paul Trudy Jones earlier, say you're an analyst in this big investment bank, you have two things that you can pitch. One is you're going to buy digital gold for the coming apocalypse.
00:36:13.934 - 00:36:37.796, Speaker B: Two is you can put on a delta neutral trade that earns, you yield, which doesn't make you seem like an ideologue. It's very clear where most financial professionals land when you talk to them. If you have it just feels very clear where this is going to go. We're not people that call for the flippening, but it feels like it's going to be obvious at some point. And I think it'll be either this year or next year that ethereum is just a generational asset.
00:36:37.900 - 00:36:51.884, Speaker A: You think it's this year or next year that the market cap of ETH, which is today, what, like 350 billion, flips the market cap of bitcoin, which is something like 700, 750 billion. So bitcoin is what, two x ETH today, do you think it flips?
00:36:51.924 - 00:36:56.158, Speaker B: I'd put it at next year, probably. That seems reasonable to me.
00:36:56.286 - 00:37:41.166, Speaker C: Just to pity back on what Vance was saying, though, when you take that concept and what Vance described as a perfectly delta neutral, perfectly hedged situation where you're just earning the yield. The other thing that I think we're going to start to see is, number, well, two things. One, you're going to see that packaged up into a product that probably is sold by institutions as well. So if you want access to that yield, there's a basis for having a fund that manages the whole thing for you. And two, I think you're also going to start to see people get a little bit more directional in terms of their betting on that exact concept. Or maybe they go half hedged and they get half the upside of what Ethereum will do, which is effectively an index proxy to what the growth of the industry will have. And you have some downside protection with your income generation that's half hedge.
00:37:41.166 - 00:38:11.194, Speaker C: You're going to start to see a ton of these different flavors of products, and it's not going to be just one size fits all for everybody. Just as you see with ETF's and just as you see with some of the more managed funds that these banks are putting out, these are going to become managed funds that will probably be just available to accredited investors and not something that's approved for retail. But there's going to be a massive opportunity for building those products, for selling those products. And the people that are getting access to them are going to get indexed and hedged, or completely hedged, or somewhat hedged access to the industry.
00:38:12.014 - 00:38:43.508, Speaker B: It's like all financial professionals do all day, in Michael and I's estimation, is just dream up these new products that they can sell to people. QQQ, with a dash of leverage. Oh, we're going to hold. If you're Pimco, you're making these bond portfolios, and maybe you'll sell some volume, just juice the yield a little bit, and they'll come up with these fancy descriptors. And why this is risk free and amazing, and this is no different. And frankly, they just haven't had a product to sell before. And the product they were selling before was gold is going to become more important.
00:38:43.508 - 00:38:55.354, Speaker B: And maybe bitcoin is like digital gold. That just is so specious and relying on so many different assumptions, that isn't actually something you can package up and sell. It has to have yield, or it has to have something that's fundamental.
00:38:56.774 - 00:39:29.518, Speaker A: All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Paraswap, the best platform to stake, swap, trade, farm, and more. Paraswap just launched gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in Defi. Or maybe it's just starting out. You know how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get. The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time.
00:39:29.518 - 00:39:46.570, Speaker A: And now you can get those entirely refunded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp. Big shout out to the paraswap dow for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just. It's tough to beat Paraswap right now. They give you the best prices. They save you money.
00:39:46.570 - 00:40:06.574, Speaker A: You've got this gas refund if you stake PSP. They've got a smooth and really user friendly interface. Fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a defi platform if you don't use them already. Check out Paraswap today at Paraswap IO. Now let's get back to the show. Let's talk about new products.
00:40:06.574 - 00:40:46.492, Speaker A: One new product a couple years ago was Uniswap, right? And uniswap kind of changed the game of defi and really took off during Defi summer as this amm, which was incredibly, I would say, revolutionary, and opened up a lot of capital flowing into defi. Vance, I think it was you who said, you're actually pretty bearish on amms. There's a lot of ex, like Citadel, DRW, Jane street folks are building better trading protocols that are cheaper for users and just a better business model for wallets. And I think this is like on chain payment for order flow. But I want to make sure I'm, I'm not putting words in your mouth. And I just want to hear you kind of expand on this thesis on why you're actually bearish for amms.
00:40:46.628 - 00:41:49.784, Speaker B: Yeah, so the history of Amms is order books are just a faster, cheaper, more efficient way to execute and get best execution on orders. Amms were designed for Ethereum because it was too slow for order books, but it was fast enough to have these x times y equals k curves be calculated and distributing trades, liquidity, et cetera, on the fly. Amms, if you look at the historical context, are very specific to how ethereum was constructed, still runs, still scales, et cetera. What you see now is you see these people who are building things for faster chains. Faster chains is the key criteria here. Where you have chains that are fast enough for an order book, they're fast enough to sell order flow ahead of time, and they're fast enough to effectively have, instead of phantom, basically allowing their users to get hit for 10, 20, 30 basis points, they can sell that order flow to market makers ahead of time. Those market makers can give the wallet 5678 bits on that trade, and the wallet has monetization.
00:41:49.784 - 00:42:25.750, Speaker B: The traders get better execution, and it's just overall a better model. You believe one of two things with the future of trading, either amms continue to become the dominant form of trading and that relies on these slow chains proliferating, which maybe that happens, maybe ethereum l one just runs away with it. That's the only thing that happens. But I think more likely is the case that everything moves to low cost chains. The next billion people are going to come onto low cost chains. They're not going to be the same degree of crypto whales that we had in the past. By logical extension, assume that it's either going to be amms or this payment for order flow model that dominates.
00:42:25.750 - 00:43:11.126, Speaker B: If it's on a low cost chain, and that's where the center of gravity is, the payment for order flow chains facilitated by an order book are going to be the ones that win for us. That's frankly where the most interesting things come from, and that's just one project. The other things that we see are dark pools that are built on ZK rollups where you can trade $500 million of Ethereum anonymously with a counterparty without signaling to the market at all. Just the complexity of how different trades are done are also going to expand, and the types of institutions that trade in them will also expand, and there's just going to be a lot more avenues than just a vanilla amm going forward. I think you see a lot of this in V three's architecture where they move towards more of this quasi order book model just because that's frankly where we think the space is going.
00:43:11.270 - 00:43:35.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a bunch of questions here. One is, doesn't that contradict your earlier thesis though, that a lot of this ends up getting built on ETH? Because if you think that as retail comes in, they go to these low cost chains and you expect then payment for order flow protocols to supplant the amms. If everyone's moving to these low cost chains like a Solana or something like that, that contradicts your earlier thesis that everything gets built on ETH.
00:43:35.114 - 00:44:09.764, Speaker B: No, I think things are going to get built everywhere. I think predominantly where things get built are on l two s or on frankly rollups that use ETH for data availability. I think that's where everything goes long term and assume that ETH will scale once sharding gets done, probably ten to 100 x. Assume rollups scale another ten x in between then, and maybe even more. You're talking about on Ethel one probably transactions under a dollar consistently in the next year to two years. If you're talking about l two s, it's probably much lower than that. It's probably less than ten cents.
00:44:09.764 - 00:44:23.524, Speaker B: I think the scaling of ETH has always been faded because it's been on the horizon for so long. But most of the decisions that were made to scale Ethereum were made three, four years ago and they just happen to be playing out today. I think that's a lot of our thesis there.
00:44:25.224 - 00:44:40.804, Speaker A: It feels like payment for order flow protocols will get big on something like ETH or wherever it is once things like gas. Like gas is probably too expensive right now for this model to work, but once becomes cheap enough, then amms kind of get supplanted.
00:44:41.184 - 00:45:06.050, Speaker B: I think payment for order flow will start on things like Solana and Polygon and then move to the higher cost chains as they make tweaks to it. Payment for order flow is an amazing business model for folks like Robinhood. The only problem in traditional finance is that there's only one person bidding or allowed to bid on this order flow, and it's citadel if you open that up, if you have daos bidding on order flow, if you have all these different market participants, it becomes a really interesting and robust business model, and we just think that's where part of this goes.
00:45:06.122 - 00:45:10.050, Speaker A: So you'll see a bunch of folks, like a tokamak pop up that start bidding on this.
00:45:10.162 - 00:45:13.290, Speaker B: Right. Like, exactly. That's part of the thesis for tokamak.
00:45:13.442 - 00:45:34.560, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. Santiago, thankfully, is not here, so I can ask this question, because he hates when I ask this question. But, like, are we, like, I'm hearing you guys talk. Okay, so, like, lido owns has, like, a monopoly on ETH staking. You've got, like, payment for order flow is the better model. And obviously, like, you know, I think some of the pushback maybe, of crypto is like, we're just kind of recreating traditional capital markets.
00:45:34.560 - 00:45:57.096, Speaker A: And what I would probably say to that is, well, we are recreating a lot of capital markets, but it's just 100 times more efficient than what capital markets actually look like today. When you hear things like, okay, payment forward or flow is the better model, let's build that. There's like, a monopoly on staking. Like, does this not make you. I guess it just. There's always a middle ground. I was going to say it's not really in the ethos of crypto, but I guess crypto is changing a lot.
00:45:57.200 - 00:46:41.568, Speaker C: So I think the advantage of Defi and the advantage of having all of this built in the open is exactly that, which is, it's transparent and it's open and it's fair. As Vance alluded to, Citadel is the one who controls basically the entire choke point of all the value that's flowing through payment for order flow models right now. And it's because they're the biggest, they're the best, they built the best systems, but they've been able to accrue network effects to what they've been able to build. And I think we. The reason why you see Lido, as we discussed, is taking it away right now with decentralized staking derivatives is because we haven't seen competitors pop up yet. We're also probably three, four months ahead of the merge even happening. So in my book, the competition hasn't even really started yet.
00:46:41.568 - 00:47:21.930, Speaker C: And so I think we're going to start to see a lot more competition. We're going to see a lot more competition, especially on the payment for order flow, as Vance was alluding to, with having all different types of flavors of participants be able to on this. On this flow. And so the advantage here, I think, isn't, or to go back to your question, we're not just recreating everything on chain, and we're going to end up in the exact same world of winner take all markets. I think what we're going to actually see when you have open and transparent markets for all financial services is that you have more competition. And when you have more competition, things will eventually get more fair and they'll eventually get cheaper and more efficient. But I think that's just not something that you see right now in traditional markets, and that's the advantage of defi.
00:47:22.082 - 00:47:38.614, Speaker A: Yeah. What are your thoughts on kind of these OG Defi protocols? Ave was at $600. May a year ago, Ave was trading at $600. A year ago, it's at 140. So it's down from like 600 to 140. Uniswap was trading at like $45. It's down to six or seven.
00:47:38.614 - 00:47:52.412, Speaker A: You guys had a large allocation to chain link, right, was like $50. Now it's down to like ten. Like, do some of these OG DeFi protocols that are actually used a lot? Yeah. What are your thoughts on some of these old school defi protocols?
00:47:52.548 - 00:48:45.574, Speaker B: I think with these old school defi protocols, the charts are obviously super unfortunate. I think that's obviously due to a degree of the narrative rotation outside of Defi into Gamefi, but also a lot of the macro stuff. To some degree, they have no control over either of those. The most important thing about any protocol is just like, how good is the team? And I think a lot of these Defi blue chips have earned their stripes because they've been through a couple of these markets, and they've sometimes even built to the last bear market. And so for us, people like Sergey, people like Stani, people like Kane, people like Hayden, and we don't have any exposure to Uniswap specifically, but those are the folks who, we just see them being able to build a business that has longevity, and things will come and go, and Uniswap could turn off, could turn on the fee switch today and rocket back up to $45. There are catalysts here, and there are usage. It has 90% of the Amm market.
00:48:45.574 - 00:49:27.314, Speaker B: And so I think to some degree, we will see these come back just because they already have gone through all of the cliffs of investors, unlocking, they've already gone through the product market fit iterations that didn't work, and they found something that does. And a lot of them are, frankly, generating enough cash flow where they're just undervalued relative to almost any traditional metrics, just like Coinbase has a PDE of nine right now. These things have a similar profile and so we're going to see a lot of these come back. We're also going to see a lot of them die and never ever return. But the only thing that really matters is who is in the chair typing the keys or the code or doing the podcasts. It's just all about good management. Those things don't change from web two to web three.
00:49:28.134 - 00:49:51.214, Speaker C: I'll just add there that I think one of the reasons why we've seen such a malaise over the last year is going back to this whole ETH two. Layer two, everybody. We expected that we were going to have optimism. Arbitram live at this point last year. They're just now getting to the point of realization. All this stuff gets delayed by years when you're building really, really difficult technology. The software takes longer just inherently.
00:49:51.214 - 00:50:49.686, Speaker C: That I think was more of the plague of the OG Defi, which is built on ETH. Layer one, they're having to transition to different layer two solutions and different chains. The other thing I'll say is that we're going to also start to see some of these funds, and I don't even know how many billions of dollars have been raised by crypto VC over the last x number of months, but it's in the billions, of course, and it's probably going to double, triple by the time maybe even this podcast comes out. But it's something that I think we're going to start to see people actually taking steps in open markets to buy tokens on exchanges. When you start to see some of these values, as Vance is alluding to, whether it's price to earnings, the cash flow that's being generated, really viable venture vets, whereas previously they weren't, unless you were in the private rounds and the seed rounds. And so maybe there's going to be an inversion of public tokens to private deals, whatever you want to call it. But I think you're going to start to see some of these funds take an allocation of their capital and go buy tokens.
00:50:49.830 - 00:51:07.594, Speaker A: Yeah, we're talking about these OG Defi protocols. A lot of them use just like liquidity mining to bring users in. And then people realized, oh shit, I give a bunch of tokens. Well, then people actually end up dumping the tokens. So maybe it's not an amazing customer acquisition tool. Let's lock up the tokens. Then ve got introduced.
00:51:07.594 - 00:51:31.410, Speaker A: Ve was actually this nice model for a little bit with curve and convex and things like that. But now we're seeing some of the downsides. I think. Just this past week the biggest whale on phantom got liquidated, or almost got liquidated for 50 million due to loans on this four year locked position. Vance, you're laughing. Maybe it sounds like you know who this was. Someone just messaged me on slack about it, so I haven't even looked into this.
00:51:31.410 - 00:51:38.466, Speaker A: But what are your guys thoughts on Ve and Vance? Maybe if you have a story about the phantom liquidation too.
00:51:38.650 - 00:52:17.024, Speaker C: So I think generally what we're starting to see is just maturation of token economic models writ large. And it's through experimentation, of course. And ve was pretty powerful for curve and the way that they kind of initiated that entire concept. The other one that we're starting to see as well is this x token concept, where I think sushi was the one that pioneered that model. There's been a couple of proposals from even some of our portfolio companies on this edge token model. I think we're going to start to see more shots on goal in terms of what models make sense for the right token, the right community, and the right application. It's nothing perfect.
00:52:17.024 - 00:52:59.814, Speaker C: As you get to points of sufficient decentralization, a lot of these decisions are turned over to the community, and we'll see which way the wind is blowing when these communities are making these decisions. But these models are improvements inherently than just having liquidity, mining incentives and new tokens being spit off into a uniswap pool to incentivize that liquidity. I think these are fundamental increases in the utility of the token. When you have the ability to stake it, you're segmenting active participants with stakers and non stakers. These are generally improvements. I think it's definitely been used quite a bit, but it's definitely an improvement over just a regular token, just as x token is as well.
00:53:00.194 - 00:53:16.494, Speaker A: I don't know. I feel like with x token I've seen some of these models too, and you guys know this 100 times better than me, but it feels like the DAO ends up handing over the vast majority of their protocol revenue to a handful of whales, which ends up further concentrating ownership and control over the protocol. But I could be worried.
00:53:17.514 - 00:53:47.634, Speaker C: This is really dependent on how you do it. Maple, as we've talked about, is one of our portfolio companies. They publish treasury reports on what their total costs are and the cash flows that are distributed to the ex NPL, or will be when the proposal goes live. That is something that's ex cost. And so I think these models are starting to be figured out. Not all of them are uniform and not all of them are the same. But I do think that if you do it right and you have the incentives and the alignment of the community, they can be powerful.
00:53:47.634 - 00:53:59.242, Speaker C: Yes, every single one of them isn't the same, and not every single one of them will work perfectly. But I think generally, once again, these are just improvements over having general liquidity mining incentives as the core use case for the token.
00:53:59.418 - 00:54:11.774, Speaker A: Anything else on Defi that you guys are really paying attention to? Anything else that's really interesting? I want to talk gaming for a second, but anything else that's really interesting that you think is kind of underlooked or overlooked right now?
00:54:12.474 - 00:55:00.084, Speaker B: I think a couple of things. Just the level of talent that's coming into this space from Chain Street, Citadel, DRW, you're going to see a major up leveling of market participants in the next six to twelve months. And I think the name of the game, as I tweeted and as we've talked about is just like, where is the flow going? Is it going to amms? Is that likely to be the future? Or is it likely to be more of dark pools for large block trades, payment for order flow for retail? Mev becomes increasingly important. Staking becomes increasingly important. That feels like more where DeFi is going over the next twelve months than let's build a copy of Uniswap on Fantom. Those days are over. If you're still on Phantom, you should know that you're just in this PvP game with other people who are trying to take your money.
00:55:00.084 - 00:55:14.472, Speaker B: If you're trying to find real innovations, you should probably come back to the chains that are actually fundamentally interesting. I don't like to shit on entrepreneurs. I also just don't like blatant cash grabs. That's my perspective.
00:55:14.608 - 00:55:20.848, Speaker A: Let's talk gaming. You guys raised this $400 million fund. What percentage of the 400 million will get allocated towards gaming?
00:55:20.976 - 00:55:26.896, Speaker C: We've said half, but any number that we put out there is just inherently going to be wrong. So it could be plus or minus.
00:55:27.080 - 00:55:27.720, Speaker A: Michael?
00:55:27.832 - 00:55:31.784, Speaker C: Yeah, we can make predictions, but our predictions will be wrong.
00:55:31.944 - 00:56:03.564, Speaker A: Yeah. When I think of framework, I think of DeFi ogs, I think of people who are not just invest, we're not just investing in DeFi before pretty much everyone else, but actually participating in DeFi. For anyone who's listening to this, if you've interacted with the Defi protocol before, you've probably also interacted with with framework or framework labs in some way or another. I think of you guys as some of the catalysts for DeFi. Why are you guys starting? I wouldn't call it a pivot at all, but almost an extension of the fund. Why are you guys so excited about gaming right now?
00:56:04.184 - 00:56:27.866, Speaker B: Just simple facts are, gaming is the world's biggest market. There's 3 billion people who play games a year. There's 1.5 billion people with Internet connection that make less than $5 a day. They're going to go play, play to earn games when these things came out more than that, this is actually closer to Michael and I's original background. I worked in corporate development at Netflix. Michael was a pm at Snapchat Media Gaming Entertainment.
00:56:27.866 - 00:56:54.786, Speaker B: These are the things that we came from and we did DeFi because it is going to be one of the biggest markets in crypto. But also, frankly, it was the first category of product market fit that was ever going to exist. Blockchains are built for financial products. That was just going to happen no matter what. And DeFi is in large part the infrastructure for a lot of these use cases. Nfts are just a financialized version of just trading pictures with your friends. A lot of the use cases that are very powerful in gaming are also built on defi primitives.
00:56:54.786 - 00:57:23.024, Speaker B: And so for us, it's just a very logical build in terms of we're going up the stack towards use cases that are more top of funnel, that have more chance of mass adoption. And it's also just challenging as well. And I think that's always kind of the, the challenge with a new fund. It's like a new album. You have to reinvent yourself. They loved your first album. What about your new stuff? Can you get them to be into that? For us, that's just the fun part of running a fund, is having the ability to continually reinvent yourself.
00:57:23.604 - 00:58:07.092, Speaker C: I think that's the macro perspective. Obviously massive market. But if you think about the micro as well, there's just a core advantage that you have in having ownership over the assets that you develop in the game ecosystem. Having the ability to partake in a marketplace that extends and enhances the gameplay experience and play to earn. With Axie, who really innovated this concept in the first place, it's an interesting model and I think give them hats off to them. They created the concept. But what we really think of is the transition from play to earn to play and earn, where it's a supplementary element to the gameplay itself, which really is defined by, is this a game? Is this something that I want to play on my own? Like, would I fall down the rabbit hole just by playing on this on a Friday night.
00:58:07.092 - 00:58:48.666, Speaker C: And if it's not, then there's going to be a hard time for us to really believe that there's really true staying power. And this can mean anything from a fast casual game like a fancy birds type experience, to something like illuvium. And we've backed both of those concepts where you do get an opportunity to have open world, massive scale gameplay, but also have a marketplace which enhances the elements and potentially and really creates the gameplay experience in a way that you haven't seen before. And so when we think about gaming, it's not as much pure axie as it is the future potential of what that model could be innovated upon into. That's one of the things that we're.
00:58:48.690 - 00:59:19.198, Speaker A: Looking at when you look at financial markets in crypto. The bigger banks and bigger exchanges were just way too slow on this. They were way, way too slow. What that did is it opened up a market for the Coinbases and Geminis and Krakens and blockfis of the world to come in and dominate. And their success ended up caused a lot of entrepreneurs who were kind of pushing at the edge of innovation to build in defi. Right. What we've seen with gaming, I think looks a little bit different, which is you had some like really, really early games that were pushing the edge of innovation.
00:59:19.198 - 00:59:57.644, Speaker A: Like someone like an axie. The. And then now I. The. Some of the OG studios are actually, I think, pushing faster into gaming than it, you know, it took some of the bigger, bigger banks, like, it took someone like JPMorgan like ten years to actually think that crypto is real. But when these gaming studios start to get competed with, I think they're moving much faster than any of these banks moved. So when you guys are looking at what the state of crypto gaming looks like in a couple of years, are some of these games built by the big studios and these AAA games are going to be built by the big studios, or are they actually built from crypto native entrepreneurs?
00:59:58.704 - 01:00:46.576, Speaker B: I think it's going to be a little bit of both. But if you've worked in a big tech company or a big gaming company, you just know how hopeless they are in ever being agile, developing a new product category before it's been proven. And they're not going to be the people who go off and pioneer. And we've heard rumblings that there's going to be play to earn games coming out from some of the major studios in the US. But TBD we've heard that for a while. And so who are the people who are most likely to take the superpowers of blockchain? And I would define those as global distribution of wallets, tokens, as a new asset class Internet, native culture, and just the ability for composability, censorship, resistance, and anybody can build and combine those into a game. It's probably going to be the crypto natives and it's not going to be probably the crypto natives with no gaming experience.
01:00:46.576 - 01:01:26.722, Speaker B: I don't think Dark Forest is going to emerge as a breakout hit that everyone plays, but it's probably going to be some indie studio with a bunch of guys who are trading crypto on the weekends who really know what this is about and really passionate about it. They're just going to say, I don't want to go and sell another game to a major studio. I want to try something new. I think those people are going to have the highest shot of creating something that stands the test of the time. And franchises like EA and Blizzard and Activision, there will be crypto native versions of those. As sure as we are sitting here in two or three years, those will be something that exists. I think one of the main things about Defi versus the banks and maybe the indie crypto studios versus the bigger studios, these things take a long time.
01:01:26.722 - 01:01:52.856, Speaker B: Illuvium was funded in January of last year. It's probably going to be another six or nine months before the mobile game comes out. All the bells and whistles are there, the gameplay is fully viable, there's a gestation period. And any new game that gets funded, I see the funding announcement of these new games. I'm like, cool, I'll play you in three years. Are we good gaming investors? We're going to find out. And we're going to find out probably sooner than other funds because we were just earlier to this trend.
01:01:52.880 - 01:02:32.004, Speaker A: In general, what's more exciting to you guys? A crypto native game that looks kind of like alluvium. That's like, like Alluvium is as crypto native, I think, as you can get, right? Like everything's on chain. They've got nfts, they've got like the dao makes the decisions. Or you've got option b, which is like EA Sports or like, I don't know, some huge gaming company goes and builds a game and like they've got in game nfts, but they've got all the gaming experience, right? They've got like a thousand game developers and like in game economists. What's more exciting, a or b? Michael? Michael was thinking B and Vance was about to fire.
01:02:32.704 - 01:03:00.868, Speaker C: I was going to say both. C. Both. But I think you have to live and breathe this stuff to really know what's going to work in this industry. And if you don't, I think it's to be an uphill battle, getting caught up to speed. In an ideal world, you're able to, to conceive of what the game is going to be and you're going to be able to tell a story and you'll be able to build a storyline and character development around that. And that's going to be something that you're equipped to be able to do.
01:03:00.868 - 01:03:34.704, Speaker C: But you also have the web three native approach and you also have the ability to resonate with the community. And so yeah, I think generally, ideally it's both. But I think you're starting to see the bridge somewhere in the middle where these two sides are going to meet. And you're starting to see people from the gaming world really get up to speed on the web. Three aspects. And we went to GDC, which is here in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, or just a couple months ago. At this point, the entire conversation, the biggest game developers conference in the entire world was 100% web three.
01:03:34.704 - 01:04:26.974, Speaker C: I'm being hyperbolic, but it was all about web three and how do I integrate NFts? What are the different types of solutions? What's the wallet solutions that I can integrate into my game? That was the entire conversation point. This stuff is going to happen a lot faster because of the padding effect of having games. And game developers just understand that this is the new platform and not only is it the new platform for you to be able to develop a game. A major part of our thesis is the catalyst of what happened over the last twelve months where Apple and Google have removed the IDFA from most of their applications and their operating systems. What that means is that the business model of advertising for small to medium sized game developers has been rugged from them. Now it's not just a nice to have let's go explore how to build our game on top of a blockchain. It's a need to have the only economic viability that they have to continue to build games is moving to this next platform.
01:04:26.974 - 01:04:55.988, Speaker C: And when you have a marketplace element that enables NFT sales and resales being your economic moat and your business driver, it just means that you don't have to rely on being an advertiser to build your business and being a subscale advertiser. There's nothing worse than doing that. There's just an opportunity for you to have real scale with real business around a blockchain. And so I think that's the recognition of that is really what's driving a lot of this upside.
01:04:56.036 - 01:05:24.926, Speaker A: But, yeah, you guys have like 20 different predictions. I don't know the actual number, but there's a couple that I want to dig into this one. Most SaaS businesses have their own l two on Ethereum, replacing their public facing API. And this reminds me a lot of, like, I don't know, when I got into the. Into the industry, like 2016, 2017, enterprise blockchain was the narrative, if you guys remember that, like, everyone was talking about enterprise blockchain. And if you. Yeah, I don't know if you guys remember the.
01:05:24.926 - 01:05:46.694, Speaker A: Oh, my God. What was, who was the commercial? It was IBM and Walmart. And it was like, Walmart is moving their mangoes onto the supply chain with like, the help of IBM blockchain. Everyone's like, oh, my God. And actually that was what convinced my co founder, Mike, who was doing management consulting and supply chain. I finally convinced him that Ethereum was real because of. Because of this commercial turned out to be totally not real.
01:05:46.694 - 01:06:04.294, Speaker A: But anyways, this kind of your prediction here, most SaaS businesses have their own l two on Ethereum. Replacing their public facing API is super interesting because it almost takes me back to that enterprise blockchain narrative, but I could see this one coming to life. So Michael or Vance, whoever made this prediction, can you just talk through what you're thinking here?
01:06:04.454 - 01:07:07.558, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think this one was me. I can't remember exactly, but this goes back to something that we were talking earlier about where SaaS businesses have this API ecosystem, which they try to get their partners, integrators, et cetera, to build on top. And I've used the example of Salesforce as it's now more of an API company than it is a core product company, and that's how they would describe it. But I think generally this is how you're going to start to see the points of integration where businesses want to integrate and get on chain. But going back to 2018, I think the narrative was something akin to it's all about blockchain, but not bitcoin. If you don't have the token, the token that is building your level of security, building your layer two, and incentivizing in that way, really missing the forest for the trees. I think what we're going to start to see is your own layer two, as opposed to leveraging something that is built on a layer two, because you want to have that token build your security layer for your ecosystem.
01:07:07.558 - 01:07:41.254, Speaker C: And the apps that you're building, the apps that your partners are building are going to be built on that l two. And integrating through that l two. This is also. These are eight year predictions, so squinting into the future to see what this looks like, this is also the basis of what interoperability could mean for us as well, where you start to see these enterprises across layer two to layer two, have these data sharing agreements, have these partnerships where you're building apps on each other's layer twos, and that's how you connect. That's the basis of this. But there's a lot of ways to potentially see this one coming true.
01:07:41.414 - 01:08:00.322, Speaker B: One thing to add, I think enterprise blockchain failed for not the reason that people think it failed. Let's go back to 2017, 2018, when they were actually trying to do enterprise blockchain. What blockchain were you going to build? Were you going to fork a very primitive version?
01:08:00.418 - 01:08:03.294, Speaker A: Build JPMorgan forks, e builds on Quorum.
01:08:03.914 - 01:08:26.742, Speaker B: You're building your own validator set. Again, going back to the Yuga labs example, what does enterprise blockchain look like in 2022? You're just going to fork an l two. It's going to be yours. You can control who's in there, you can control who's not. You're secured by Ethereum. It just gets far easier to do this. And so we think enterprise blockchains are going to be back at some point and it's just going to look like l two s.
01:08:26.742 - 01:08:36.574, Speaker B: This is going to happen. And it's the perfect level of marketability of. We're doing something. We're on Ethereum. It's controlled, though. It's ours. We kind of own it.
01:08:36.574 - 01:08:45.530, Speaker B: But you also have real utility, pay us in stable coins, integrate our API. It's on a blockchain. You just have something valuable there and it doesn't have all the overhead that it used to have.
01:08:45.622 - 01:09:18.224, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm laughing, Vance, because Mike and I always joke that we are going to completely miss the next big social network built on crypto or the enterprise blockchain thing. We're going to completely miss it when it actually happens, because we're so pessimistic and got so. We just saw so much shit, obviously, in the 2017 market, so that when the next social network gets built on ETH or something like that, we're going to miss it because we're going to be too skeptical.
01:09:18.684 - 01:09:28.388, Speaker B: There are no bad ideas. There's only bad timing. Literally every idea that anyone has will come true at some point. It just matters. Do they have the right infrastructure to support it?
01:09:28.516 - 01:09:32.564, Speaker C: This is coming from two people who built basically top shot in 2018 2019.
01:09:32.684 - 01:09:53.174, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Michael and I hated NFTs for so long because we sold our company. It wasn't change the world outcome, but it was certainly enough to seed framework. But we hated NFTs for so long that we just wouldn't touch them. And we were wrong about that for a while. And I think we switched before we were really, really wrong. But it's case in point.
01:09:53.294 - 01:10:19.918, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's talk about another prediction. You guys had an episode of Bankless. Actually, I think it was June or July, summer of 2021. In Vance, you said in ten years, 10% of global gdp will come from daos. And then you guys had another, you guys had an actual prediction on this blog post that said ten daos will manage over $100 billion each. So can you just talk to me about some of your theses around daos and how big they can actually get here?
01:10:20.006 - 01:10:53.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, let's take fay tribe for an example. Tribe has about $700 million, maybe less now, of Ethereum, and let's say that they don't do anything at all. And Ethereum goes up ten x. They're going to have probably about about $7.5 billion of assets in their dow. The whole point of tribe is to generate yield either via stablecoin, but via the PCV. By other metrics, they'll obviously get some sort of multiple on that, which they can then use to borrow against, be more capital efficient, generate more yield.
01:10:53.574 - 01:11:17.358, Speaker B: These things will be reflexive in that same way. Assume that ethereum is even higher than what we think. These dows are going to be within striking distance of $100 billion, which would put them at the same level of the world's biggest investors. So Tiger manages 100 billion. Andreessen is about 56 billion today. They're going to be right up there, but it's going to be in a decentralized context. And so it's going to be very controversial when they get that size.
01:11:17.358 - 01:11:47.656, Speaker B: And they will get that size because there's going to be a Dao people voting on where the capital goes, and it's going to be a lot of spotlights that are on them as well. But almost by the force of the markets themselves, combined with the utility of these projects, they're going to get there. The same goes for the Luna Foundation. Guard, which is basically a Dao. It's multisig things like Tokamak as well, which have like 1.5 billion in TVL. These things are going to get there and they're going to get there quickly and they're going to have a ton of leverage over the rest of the ecosystem.
01:11:47.656 - 01:11:53.984, Speaker B: They're going to be buying in game assets. They're going to be building referral programs to bring people in. They're going to get very sophisticated very quickly.
01:11:54.104 - 01:12:28.758, Speaker A: Last question here. I'm going to ask both of you guys. Michael, we'll start with you. We had Haseeb and from electric and Haseeb Dragonfly on maybe a month ago. And the way that they categorized their thesis on just what is happening today is narrative exhaustion, right? For the last 18 months, things just moved so quickly, starting with kind of defi summer and, you know, defi summer for an entire year, price of these things went like 100 x. Then, you know, people sold his NFT for 69 million NFT. Like we've been in 18 months of an NFT bull market and it's been completely insane.
01:12:28.758 - 01:12:51.054, Speaker A: Facebook changed their name to Meta. The metaverse thesis got really hot. Gaming obviously super hot. So it's just we had two years of just like these crazy narratives, and now it feels like things have really slowed down, whether we're on a bear market or crypto winter, whatever you want to call it. It really feels like. I like what Avichal and Haseeb said of just like, narrative exhaustion. People are kind of tired of the narrative.
01:12:51.054 - 01:13:02.024, Speaker A: We need a break for a second. Michael, how would you categorize your thesis on just not the next eight years or ten years, but the next six months, what the rest of 2022 looks like?
01:13:02.444 - 01:13:48.280, Speaker C: So I think what's happened, frankly, I agree with narrative exhaustion. And generally there's just been so much that's happened. The run ups have been massive. This is probably the third bull market that I've seen in crypto where you start to see 1020, 5100 x returns. Whenever that happens, people are going to be exhausted. In general, I think what I think has really happened, though, over the last six months, or actually probably call it five months now, is really what's happened on the macro, macro scale. You actually start to see inflation become real and therefore you see fed increase in interest rates and you see what's happening in Ukraine and the conflict between them and Russia.
01:13:48.280 - 01:14:33.516, Speaker C: And that drives consternation in terms of global supply chains and potential for massive military action. So there's just a lot of fear in the market right now. And so I think it's the combination of the narrative being overexhausted, but it's also macro, macro being something that's never looked worse than it is right now. And a lot of the, I can't remember exactly the survey, but the sentiment of american investor sentiment has never been lower since March 2009. And you think about what was happening right there. It was the depths of the global financial crisis, and even March 2020 was not as low as it is right now. And so the global sentiment, I think, is really negative as well.
01:14:33.516 - 01:15:08.888, Speaker C: And so what happens in the next six months? Well, I think if we can start to see some abatement of inflation over the next couple of months, that will be a positive signal. Some changes in the perspective of how many interest rates we're going to have to go through for the next six months, that would be some positive signal, a ceasefire or some change in the dynamics between Ukraine and Russia, that will be some positive signal. And so I think right now, macro, macro is kind of steering the ship. And so as we get closer to some of these positive events, like the merge, maybe that will win back some of the positive perspective for crypto, but macro, macro is going to be driving this stuff until then.
01:15:09.056 - 01:15:21.704, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. You could really see a world where the Fed maybe starts decelerating, tightening, heading right into the merge, and that kicks off something interesting. So, Vance, maybe if you want to wrap us up here, I know we're on time. So what's your outlook for the next six months?
01:15:21.824 - 01:15:45.194, Speaker B: So I would kind of put it, I agree with everything Michael had said. I would say, like, let's go back to mid 2021. Interest rates are at zero. Crypto is crashing in the middle of the summer. That's when I was super worried. I was basically like, man, we have the most accommodative scenario that we could possibly have, and crypto isn't rallying. That was very concerning to me.
01:15:45.194 - 01:16:12.756, Speaker B: Let's go to today. People are the most pessimistic they've ever been. The Fed is going to go full bear, whale and Titan and qt and all this stuff, stuff. And crypto is hanging in there. I also think this is a little bit on the backdrop of people just being so scared and so nervous, they don't realize that we're going to have this huge post pandemic boom that's going to knock everybody's socks off. That's going to happen. I'm fairly positive on the macro side.
01:16:12.756 - 01:16:37.360, Speaker B: If you're in a good scenario, where the crypto is hanging in there and there's nothing but potential accommodation on the horizon. That's when I get fairly bullish. I also just think on a fundamental basis, we need to build a bigger table. We need to have use cases which touch gaming, which touch content, which touch commerce, which bring in hundreds of millions of users. We only have probably 30 40 million maus at the moment. That needs to happen. We need to invest in custodial experiences that my mother can use this stuff.
01:16:37.360 - 01:16:56.194, Speaker B: We need to invest in all different types of payments that people can onboard easily. That's all the work that's going on right now. We're fairly positive on all of this. I think when we look back, it's so hard to remember. It's easy to remember exactly what happened. It's hard to remember how you actually felt. People won't remember feeling this bearish when everything kicks back off.
01:16:56.194 - 01:17:03.282, Speaker B: That being said, I do think the scams, the cash grabs, those things need to die. And I'm looking forward to seeing those people leave the space.
01:17:03.418 - 01:17:17.978, Speaker A: Yeah. Do we have. On one hand it feels like we've already gone pretty low. On the other hand we have things like this crazy bored ape metaverse land grab. Do we have lower to go here? Is sentiment low enough? I would say I think we're going.
01:17:17.986 - 01:17:46.370, Speaker B: To go a little bit lower. We probably need a little bit more punishment. People need to really feel how bad this could be, but there's going to be a lot of dispersion. Ape is going to be a very challenging coin to be holding, I think, over the next six months. The facade of Yuga labs being able to execute everything flawlessly was obviously broken last weekend, and usually that's the first step. Once there's a chink in the armor, it's a little bit like, ok, hold on to your shorts. That's my sentiment, at least.
01:17:46.370 - 01:17:51.494, Speaker B: There's going to be a lot of assets that move differently than each other just because they have different levels of fundamentals.
01:17:52.094 - 01:18:18.234, Speaker C: I think markets always lead economics and then the data of the economics is a lagging indicator. So we're going to start to see the effects of what's going on right now in like three, four months. And so markets are going to change right now, then the economics are going to come through and then we're going to get the readout prints. So I wouldn't be surprised if this plus or minus a couple of weeks is going to be the low. But to Vance's point, it could be sooner, it could be later. We'll find out.
01:18:18.614 - 01:18:28.854, Speaker A: Michael Vance. This was awesome, guys. Thanks for your time. Thanks for both jumping on this was made it really special. So I appreciate the insights into Defi and gaming. And congrats again on the $400 million new fund.
01:18:28.934 - 01:18:30.054, Speaker B: Appreciate it, buddy.
01:18:30.214 - 01:18:32.366, Speaker C: Thank you very much. Yeah, cool.
01:18:32.510 - 01:18:33.054, Speaker A: Take care, guys.
