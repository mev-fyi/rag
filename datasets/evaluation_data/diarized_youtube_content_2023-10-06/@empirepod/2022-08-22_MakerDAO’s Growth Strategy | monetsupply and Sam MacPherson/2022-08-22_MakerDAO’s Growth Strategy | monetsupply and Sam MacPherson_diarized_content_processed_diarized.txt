00:00:04.280 - 00:00:14.038, Speaker A: All right, everyone, back with another really special episode of Empire. I'm taking this one solo. Santi is traveling today. We've got hexanaut and we've got Monet supply in the room. Welcome, guys.
00:00:14.206 - 00:00:15.206, Speaker B: Good to be here.
00:00:15.350 - 00:00:16.614, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:00:16.734 - 00:00:51.784, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, of course. Let's jump into. Just like the elephant in the room, I want to jump straight into things. Last week we saw the US treasury add tornado cash to the OFAC list, USDC freezing related tokens, inferior alchemy, GitHub, Defi front ends and other providers began to censor the addresses. Now, crypto, Twitter got in this big debate about lower level validator censorship. Sam, I want to maybe start with you to kick this off. What are your takeaways, specifically about how this relates to maker? And obviously there was a big conversation around Dai and should dai be.
00:00:51.784 - 00:01:02.418, Speaker A: A lot of the. Over 50% of the collateral comes from USDC, which can be censored. What is your takeaway from this whole situation now that maybe you've had a couple of days to reflect on this?
00:01:02.506 - 00:02:03.374, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So it's been definitely a new development, and we're kind of in a different situation now a little bit. But I kind of am the view that this is sort of the first phase of this, where the US, in my view, has kind of overstepped here by just blanket banning, like a smart contract, a permissionless smart contract on Ethereum. I think it was an overstep and sort of the next step seems to be happening where there's sort of legal pushback on this. Like, it reminds me a lot of sort of the crypto wars in the nineties, right, where they were trying to outlaw privacy, like encryption and stuff like that for individuals. And it was ultimately sort of like, I don't know who exactly. Maybe the EFF, I think they were around back then, but whoever was, like, fighting back against it, and ultimately they got these overreaching rules reversed.
00:02:03.374 - 00:02:21.808, Speaker B: So I think we're going to see how this plays out. I think it's way too early to know how this ends, ultimately. Maybe I'm a bit too much of an optimist, but ultimately, this could be providing much needed regulatory clarity for the space, which, which could be a good thing in the long run.
00:02:21.896 - 00:02:32.432, Speaker A: Yeah. Monet, what do you think? Does this change how you just assess risk in general at maker and maybe even more specifically, like, the high concentration of USDC within DAi?
00:02:32.568 - 00:03:20.788, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it was. It was somewhat of a wake up call because I think the assumption was always that there would be some sort of due process involved in like government actions that end up freezing USDC on chain, particularly in like pooled pools, like smart contracts, like the, you know, bankers peg stability modules and. Yeah, those kind of showed that that's not necessarily the case. So I think that it puts like a more, more emphasis on being able to survive, essentially, until we can get that legal review process started and try and roll back some of the government oversteps from OFAC or from other places.
00:03:20.916 - 00:03:33.276, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, how big of a threat do you really think this is? There's a lot of panic when this comes out, obviously. But Monet, how big of a threat do you really think this is to something like dai in the immediate term?
00:03:33.340 - 00:03:57.414, Speaker C: I don't think it's a big threat. I think that it's indicative of maybe greater challenges over time where like slowly, you know, kind of the government is going to be hemming in options for what Defi can and can't do. So I think it's like kind of the opening shot. It's not like an immediate threat, but it's pointing towards kind of a bigger battle that we have to come.
00:03:57.754 - 00:04:35.948, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like there are two. I feel like there are two battles going on in parallel here. One is related to, uh, sanctioning assets like something like a USDC that has gone through something that they don't like, which is a tornado cache. Then there's another side of this, which is, uh, sanctioning, uh, platforms that they don't like. For example, uh, defi front ends maybe, that they don't like. And, and obviously, the important part of this is making sure that the, the protocol behind the scenes remains open and permissionless. Um, Sam, are you guys like, how do you think getting away from DAi and USDC for a second, how do you think about just like, building front ends that can actually last, or, excuse me, building.
00:04:35.948 - 00:04:43.236, Speaker A: Building a protocol that actually lasts where we know the government might be coming after the front end over time.
00:04:43.420 - 00:05:31.942, Speaker B: Yeah. So I definitely believe in sort of having the core protocol be open and permissionless as much as possible. So wherever there are sort of weaknesses, centralization, we need to kind of work on that as much as we can to improve that. In terms of defi front ends, I actually don't want them to be blocking people, but ultimately, I think it's up to them, even the official ones. These are more in the realm of legal private companies. And I think it's more important to have a bunch of competition on the edges for providing the best user experience. But as long as the core protocol remains permissionless and open and sort of in a worst case scenario, you can just directly interact with the smart contracts.
00:05:31.942 - 00:05:33.534, Speaker B: I think that's okay, in my view.
00:05:33.654 - 00:05:53.776, Speaker A: And one of you guys, I don't know who should take the same or monet. Can you just explain what the PSM is like, why it was implemented? This was such a big innovation, I would say. I think it was last year in 2021. What is the PSM? Why was it such a big innovation? And then from there, we can start talking about some of the future collateral models.
00:05:53.910 - 00:07:00.314, Speaker B: Sure, I can run over it. So, basically, let's go through a little bit of a time travel to back when Dai was launched. So, multicollateral Dai was launched in November 2019. And basically we had a situation where Dai was consistently trading under a dollar. And that was something we could deal with fairly easily, even with ETH as the only collateral at that time, because we can just raise stability fees, or raise the stability fees would basically encourage people to buy Dai on the market, raise the price, and repay their loans. Or we could raise what's called the Dai savings rate, which is to encourage more people to hold dai again, which would increase the price. So that was a pretty well known sort of situation, and it lasted right up until March 12, I think it was 2020, also known as Black Thursday, when the price of ETH crashed about half in one day.
00:07:00.314 - 00:07:44.694, Speaker B: So in that situation, people were panic repaying and people were fleeing to safety. So this sort of increased the price of dai above $1. And really what we had is this excess demand, and we had no tools at the time to really put it anywhere. So the peg broke up to about $1.10. And I think about a month later, we introduced USDC as a new collateral type to kind of store this excess demand, give people an option to basically short the peg back down. So this lasted up until the December 2020. We had USDC on its regular vaults.
00:07:44.694 - 00:08:37.914, Speaker B: You could use it just like ETH. But there was sort of the realization it makes a lot more sense to have the protocol own this USDC and basically just use it as an arbitrage mechanism to keep the peg at $1 or less. So basically, the PSM works in such that if DAi is trading over a dollar, let's say it's trading at $1.01, anybody can take dollar 100 of USDC and then use that in the PSM to mint 100 dai, which is worth $101, and then convert that back into USDC to close the loop. And that is profitable. Arbitrage the same thing happens reverse on the way down. When the peg breaks low and there's available USDC in the PSM, there's an arbitrage opportunity in the opposite direction.
00:08:37.914 - 00:08:52.362, Speaker B: Basically, as long as there's capacity in the PSM or USDC and the PSM, we can hold the dipeg at a hard $1.02 years later.
00:08:52.458 - 00:09:19.304, Speaker A: I mean, you guys now have, what, $3.5 billion worth of USDC somewhere around that is. This is the PSM Monet, maybe. I'll throw this to you. How similar do you think the PSM is to, like, curve stable swap offering and like curves, three pools does that. I've seen analogies, I've seen Hasu talk about this a little bit. How much of an analogy is there to draw there, or parallels would there be to draw there?
00:09:21.124 - 00:10:23.988, Speaker C: I think a lot of other decentralized stablecoins have used curve pools as their own version of the PSM. They externalize it a little bit. So they have users own those LP tokens, and usually they're paying them to put their capital into those LP's to provide liquidity. But I think it ends up being a really similar mechanism where it provides a lot of liquidity selling your stable coin if it's above the peg and then buying it if it's below. So, yeah, I think it ends up being a similar stabilization mechanism, but it's, you know, it's external to the protocol. So there's an argument that maybe there's somewhat less like, censorship risk or regulatory risk from governments freezing it. And the other thing is that it's kind of like it doesn't hold the peg as hard as the PSM.
00:10:23.988 - 00:10:52.264, Speaker C: It allows the price to deviate a little bit depending on, like, the supply and demand of these stable coins. So, yeah, I think it ends up serving a similar purpose for most stable coins as the PSM does for maker. But it's. Yeah, it just has a couple, like, differences there of externalizing it, having less of a hard peg, but then also being much more costly for these protocols that are using curve as their source of liquidity.
00:10:52.604 - 00:11:21.464, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so let's draw the timeline out here and get into what I really want to dig into in this conversation is the collateral basket and get your guys take on this. So end of 2019, you guys introduced multicollateral Dai, March of 2020. Obviously the black Thursday price of ETH falls like 50% in a day. Dai pushed up to like a buck twelve that day. Bad for the protocol. A couple of days later, a couple of weeks later, you guys introduced, I think it was actually like a couple of days later, introduced USDC.
00:11:21.464 - 00:11:44.374, Speaker A: You guys introduced USDC 2021. You guys introduced the PSM. Fast forward to today. You've got like $3.5 billion worth of USDC in the PSM. A couple months ago, it started becoming really, really clear, and I know this has been worked on for more than just a couple of months, but became really, really clear that you guys were making this big push into real world assets. Rwas right.
00:11:44.374 - 00:12:04.552, Speaker A: Monet, can you maybe kick us off here? And then, Sam, I'll throw it to you. Like, what kicked off this urge and this desire to get into real world assets? Was it a lack of collateral? Was it a lack of crypto collateral, which would maybe cap the scale of Dai? Or what was the reason for real world assets?
00:12:04.688 - 00:13:18.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I think over time after Black Thursday, and we faced this huge excess of demand for holding stable coins compared to demand for levering up on ether and other crypto native collateral assets. I think initially people thought this was just like a temporary sort of market movement, but over time, it became pretty clear that this was just like an intractable kind of state of affairs of the crypto space. More people want to hold stable coins and there's just more demand for stable assets versus leverage long and Ethan margin. So we kind of knew that we were never going to be able to meet the demand for Dai just purely through people levering on ETH or even on like wrapped bitcoin or other, you know, staking derivatives or other assets. And then the sort of the situation was, we have all this USDC, it's not very risky, but on the other hand, we're earning no yield on it. So it's not contributing to our income whatsoever. It's not really compensating for the, you know, the small amount of risk that it does have.
00:13:18.194 - 00:14:02.134, Speaker C: And it just kind of provides a much better, you know, risk adjusted return and risk compensation if we can deploy these assets, all this, you know, billions and billions in the PSM into productive uses. So stuff like we've got, you know, asset originators that are funding real estate investments and various other real world assets, they actually do provide a yield to maker, which is more than enough to compensate for risk and also pay for the protocols, overheads. And it just basically is just a better deal for maker to deploy these productively.
00:14:02.434 - 00:14:13.254, Speaker A: To do this, though, if you start bringing on more and more real world assets, eventually you push further and further on the risk spectrum, though. And then that gets into why you have to build the buffer, as I understand it.
00:14:13.414 - 00:14:17.034, Speaker B: What do you mean by the risk? What kind of risk?
00:14:18.134 - 00:14:37.074, Speaker A: Riskiness of the lender. Just basically the risk profile of whoever you're giving loans to. The riskier the lender, the higher the default rate is going to be. The higher the default rate might be means the higher the buffer that you'll need. Am I thinking about that in the right way?
00:14:37.534 - 00:14:58.974, Speaker B: Yeah. But usually what we're striving for is more senior positions and usually over collateralized. You could do over collateralized lending in the real world as well. So getting these sort of safer positions with lower yields is more of our goal, less about under collateralized lending and all that kind of stuff.
00:14:59.054 - 00:15:08.350, Speaker A: Yeah. And what is the ideal basket of collateral for Dai? And I'm curious if you guys agree on this or disagree monet, maybe start with you and then go over to Sam.
00:15:08.462 - 00:16:08.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I would love to see more ether collateral, more liquid staking, more bitcoin, more of those core large cap crypto assets. But I think what we've seen in the past is you can't draw blood from a stone. In a certain sense, we can try and lower the interest rates we're charging and loosen risk parameters, but there's just a limit on how much demand there is for people to lever up against those assets. So we need to find the right balance with those. We can't force the market to borrow from us against crypto. I think ideally, I'd love to see 50% or more in really censorship resistant collateral assets, but I don't think it's realistic, except for maybe in bull markets. So maybe somewhere between like a quarter to half in just large cap cryptos.
00:16:08.574 - 00:16:56.016, Speaker C: A little bit, I think, of PSM backing. So the stable coins that maker is holding in reserves, I think is a big benefit because it makes dai very liquid. And people can be really confident that DAi is going to maintain that $1 value. So I think that ten to even 20% psm backing in the long term is acceptable and maybe even good. And then beyond that, I think there's opportunity in what we call d three m. So it's direct deposit modules where we can inject liquidity into other protocols. People might not want to borrow on maker, but they might be willing to borrow on AAVE or compound.
00:16:56.016 - 00:17:54.458, Speaker C: So we can supply dai into those markets and provide the market with liquidity where it wants it. And then beyond that, I think real world assets will be kind of how we fill the gap. I'm sort of most in favor of at least while yields are high with just sticking with treasuries and short term assets, really low risk, really easy to assess in the long run, I think maker will be able to run the full gamut of stuff, but it's really difficult to assess the risk and manage the risk of private credit investments. Yeah, there's been some interesting proposals of, like, real world assets that are funding, you know, big projects like solar farms, various stuff like this, but they are difficult to really manage the risk and assess if it's a good deal.
00:17:54.586 - 00:17:57.290, Speaker A: Yeah. Sam, what do you think? Agree. Disagree.
00:17:57.482 - 00:18:02.666, Speaker B: Yeah, that was spot on. Pretty much my collateral portfolio as well.
00:18:02.850 - 00:18:08.138, Speaker A: Nice. So then, do you guys think that real world assets are a short term solution?
00:18:08.186 - 00:18:08.434, Speaker C: Let's.
00:18:08.474 - 00:18:26.674, Speaker A: So let's say, okay, what's the total. What's the total market cap of crypto today? Some. Somewhere around roughly a trillion or 1.5 trillion. I don't know the exact number today, but ballpark around a trillion. Let's say crypto. The total market for crypto grows to, let's call it 20 trillion.
00:18:26.674 - 00:18:46.004, Speaker A: Right. The. Does that mean that the. Would you still need real world assets as collateral there? And maybe a different way to phrase that. Is, are real world assets just this kind of band aid solution for collateral that we need until. While we wait for crypto to grow to the size that we think crypto will eventually get to?
00:18:46.664 - 00:19:14.984, Speaker B: I don't think so, but I'm hopeful. They kind of morph into something that's more on chain first. So right now, we're kind of having to, like, makers sort of on the forefront. We're having to push out into the real world and get these deals done. I'd like to see more tokenized real world assets. The first one was people don't think of it as a real world asset, but all these us dollar coins are real world assets. They're just tokenized off chain positions and, like, cash and stuff like that.
00:19:14.984 - 00:19:52.756, Speaker B: So I would like to see more of this with sort of, like, maybe the next one is sort of tokenized positions in corporate bonds, government bonds, that kind of stuff. If there can be some sort of independent provider that puts this on chain and does redemption, all that kind of stuff, and then just has these secondary markets form on chain, this is sort of ideal candidates for collateral, for maker. And it may feel less like sort of the real world assets that we've been doing so far and just a much nicer way to go about it. So I'm still hopeful this is sort of coming in the hopefully near future.
00:19:52.940 - 00:20:06.556, Speaker A: Yeah. Do real world assets. What's the advantage that real world assets have over something like USCC? Right. A lot of people are saying move away from USCC because of these sanctions. Are real world assets not similarly sanctionable.
00:20:06.740 - 00:20:44.752, Speaker B: Yeah, I think playing as if we're having to avoid these sort of overreaching sanctions, I just think is a non starter. I think we just need to push back on this and worst case scenario, we'll have to deal with it. Right. But I still am optimistic we can kind of work out something that's more reasonable and not have to plan everything as if we have extremely hostile actors from the largest government in the world. So if we have to fight the US government, I think this space will just be completely decimated and it's not as interesting as it could be.
00:20:44.858 - 00:20:46.060, Speaker A: Monet, what do you think?
00:20:46.212 - 00:21:28.528, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I would agree that you want to be decentralized and resilient, but I think we don't necessarily need to plan for a government takeover apocalypse. I think that one of the best things we can do is try and really build public support for decentralized money. And yeah, it's a much more realistic way to try and address these sort of government risks instead of just saying, okay, we're gonna sell all of the USDC into ETH or some other far fetched idea like that.
00:21:28.656 - 00:22:06.368, Speaker A: Yeah, one of the things I was thinking about, I told you guys, I was talking to Sam before this about ramping up to become a recognized delegate within maker. I was trying to think of some of the maybe concerns I might have with real world asset strategy. Something that came to mind was when you lend to real world assets like a bank, they're probably going to dump the borrowed die for US dollars. The PSM can support this right now. But as you start ramping that strategy up, I'm assuming there's a scalability there. I'm assuming that is capped. Is that a fair concern or that just means I don't understand it well enough or this is a concern, but there's a solution.
00:22:06.368 - 00:22:08.148, Speaker A: Monet, what do you think about that?
00:22:08.296 - 00:23:21.670, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely a fair concern. We have so much PSM reserves right now, so many stablecoin reserves, that I don't think it's a very immediate concern. Like if we're able to scale up real world assets enough that we actually start running into that issue, that would be a good problem to have the solutions at that point. I think it's we can kind of lean back onto our previous peg management mechanisms of turning on the DAi savings rate, creating more demand to bring people into DAi to help kind of balance that supply and demand, if we can get that much real world asset adoption, and I think it is kind of a new type of risk to manage though like to date, all of our, all of our assets, so to speak, like vaults and such, they all basically have no duration. We can change the interest rate on those whenever we want or we can kind of incentivize people to repay those whenever. And with real world assets, that's no longer the case. You have specific agreements.
00:23:21.670 - 00:23:41.510, Speaker C: Generally the rates will be fixed or quasi fixed. So I think it just requires an extra layer of portfolio management and risk management to make sure you're not overextending on really long duration assets unless you're sure that you can balance that against your liabilities correctly.
00:23:41.662 - 00:24:01.912, Speaker A: Die savings rate, just to make sure I fully understand it, the die savings rate is the variable rate of accrual that you earn by locking it into the DSR contract. The goal was to allow maker governance to influence demand for die through changes in monetary policy. If I understand it correctly, and it's right now at like set at like ten or 15 bps.
00:24:02.088 - 00:24:02.624, Speaker C: One bip.
00:24:02.664 - 00:24:05.440, Speaker A: Yeah, one. Okay, one bip.
00:24:05.552 - 00:24:07.768, Speaker C: It's the token amount right now.
00:24:07.896 - 00:24:18.376, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Sam, you agree with the concern around real world assets dumping for us dollars? Good problem to have. We can figure that out if we get to that scale.
00:24:18.440 - 00:24:53.534, Speaker B: Oh, definitely. You can look at a sort of a flywheel effect. Right now we have like, I don't know, seven times as much demand for DAi as we can fill on the supply side. So that's why we have this huge excess of stablecoin backing. If we can replace that with more useful assets, as soon as we start filling a good chunk of that, we can then forward these earnings on to dai holders and start boosting the demand up again. Where we get more stable coins coming in, we can transfer those to more productive assets and it just cycles and it's sort of a positive feedback loop.
00:24:54.274 - 00:25:44.602, Speaker A: Do you guys think that when you go into new markets like this, you guys are basically going to need to, the more physical assets that get tokenized, the better maker will end up doing because you'll be able to pull those tokenized assets probably into maker as collateral for Dai. As you guys think about what you're basically doing is you're creating a new market. Do you think that it's on you or do you guys have some sort of strategy to help tokenize assets? This has been a narrative I remember in 2017 it was like security tokens, and we're going to tokenize all this real estate, and here we are five years later, and it really hasn't happened. So do you think that that's almost on you, or do you think it would benefit maker and benefit Dai to maybe form a core unit to help tokenize some of these real world assets?
00:25:44.778 - 00:26:14.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So maker sort of been, I think, one of the protocols that is kind of pushing for this, and it's definitely uncharted territory, so there's lots of stumbling blocks that we have to go over. I think a lot of the issues right now is just bridging the smart contract world with the legal world. And, you know, I'm not a lawyer, but there's, I think, a lot of people working on this, especially now with interest rates rising, there's a lot more sort of demand for these types of products.
00:26:15.374 - 00:26:21.950, Speaker A: So having Daos sign legal agreements with off chain entities, you're saying, is not too easy of a thing.
00:26:22.142 - 00:27:05.602, Speaker B: No, it's like, you know, we have been kind of experimenting with a few things on this regard. There's definitely a number of legal structures that we're exploring, but the idea is that, like, you know, once we get this once and it's scalable, we can just sort of ratchet this up, whatever the solution is. And ideally, it sort of provides a lot of safeguards to the protocol. So we're still kind of in the experimentation phase, but there's starting to be, like, things developing. For example, like we are extending loans, like, as of right now, extending loans out to Huntington Valley bank as well as society general. These are loans going out to real world banks, and there are legal agreements behind them and all that kind of stuff. So there's lots of experimentation going on.
00:27:05.698 - 00:27:20.442, Speaker A: The. So the Huntington Valley bank was an interesting one. So you've got that $100 million dai debt facility. Do you lend to Huntington Valley bank or are you lending. Does that pass through Huntington Valley bank? It goes to Huntington Valley Bank's customers. What does that deal look like?
00:27:20.538 - 00:27:31.802, Speaker B: Yeah, so the Huntington Valley bank and I think society general is. Yeah, they act sort of as an intermediary to the end borrower, which they'll just do their normal bank thing and issue loans out to whoever that is.
00:27:31.858 - 00:27:32.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:32.242 - 00:27:34.236, Speaker A: And those loans are in us dollars.
00:27:34.370 - 00:27:37.240, Speaker B: Uh, the end loans. I am. I'm not familiar.
00:27:37.392 - 00:27:37.720, Speaker C: Okay.
00:27:37.752 - 00:27:39.128, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I have no idea.
00:27:39.296 - 00:27:50.712, Speaker A: So you're lending a hundred, you could lend up to $100 million and die to HVB. And then they would probably convert the DAI into USD for the, for the loans to their end consumers. Okay, interesting.
00:27:50.808 - 00:28:13.348, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is sort of the thing about replacing the PSM. A lot of people say we're just lending out the USDC and the PSM, but there's sort of just a two step process to this. They'll mint the daisy and then they'll convert it through the PSM. And then there's, because it's easier to redeem large quantities through USDC versus DAi so they can get out to us dollars pretty much at one to one.
00:28:13.436 - 00:28:32.290, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. Sam, I think, did you propose the real world assets and onboarding new assets in general ties back to the system surplus, like the risk buffer? Did you put together that proposal back in what, March or April earlier this year? Was that you?
00:28:32.362 - 00:28:34.810, Speaker B: Yeah. Are you talking about the aggressive growth strategy?
00:28:34.962 - 00:29:03.564, Speaker A: I think there was a proposal talking about how maker should raise its system surplus by a factor of like five x or more via a debt or an equity issuance. Meaning I think it was like a 300 or $350 million surplus goal. The surplus was back then, like, let's call it 60 million, 65 million. Now it's at like maybe 80 million roughly. Was that you? I mean, I'd love to hear more about just like what is makers system surplus? Like how is it funded, what is it for? And like where is it now and where should it be?
00:29:03.684 - 00:30:05.156, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Yeah, that was me who put out that original proposal back in March, I think it was. So first, just a little primer, I guess, on the system surplus or the surplus buffer. Basically, this is sort of excess cash that we have around that we can, it's there in case of a shortfall event with any of the collateral. So let's say ETH price drops really rapidly, so much so that we cannot liquidate before certain people's positions become under collateralized. If we liquidate and the final position is under collateralized, then there will be some sort of debt, bad debt there that we need to recapitalize with the system's total sort of cash flow so that the system as a whole remains solvent. So this is an automated process, and that is sort of the main reason for the system surplus.
00:30:05.156 - 00:30:44.952, Speaker B: Now lately it's also being used to pay operational expenses ever since the foundation dissolved. And we are entirely operating as a dow. There's expenses to building and maintaining the protocol and all that. So we have to fund expenses from somewhere, and that somewhere is the surplus buffer. And how have we filled that so far? It's been entirely filled by revenue. There has been no sort of cap raise directly inserted to that. It's just sort of been the protocol running for how long? It's been three years, almost three years now.
00:30:44.952 - 00:30:53.028, Speaker B: Just the accrued interest has been just piling in there, and that's how we've built it so far. Yeah.
00:30:53.156 - 00:30:55.184, Speaker A: Monet, do you think there should be a cap raise?
00:30:56.004 - 00:32:15.654, Speaker C: I'm definitely receptive to wanting a higher surplus, and I think Sam kind of mentioned this as, like, the reasoning behind the proposal. But if we have more capital, then we can afford to take a little bit more risks, like right now, I think. And historically, we've been really, really focused on not losing money on those liquidations and on deal like debt going bad. So we might have liquidation ratios for some of our crypto collateral vaults higher than we could, just because we want to be sure that we're not going to end up losing money and putting DAI holders at risk. So if we can raise a lot more capital and have a much bigger surplus, we can take a little bit more risk. We might be able to get a little bit more demand for borrowing out of the market and help shift that collateral balance a little bit farther away from stable coins and back towards crypto assets. Similar logic applies for real world assets as well, where if we have more capital, we can, we can be more confident in deploying assets into real world assets without being afraid that we're risking die holders money.
00:32:15.654 - 00:33:18.042, Speaker C: I think it seems like it's politically a little bit touchy within the Dow, though, because first of all, no one likes to get diluted with crypto in particular. People have a meme about dumping, and it's tough to convince people that this is an investment in growth and kind of what the benefit is. And also there's sort of a somewhat delicate balance of power for voters. So if you increase the supply of MKR, who ends up buying that? And where do they align on different sort of, like, decisions that the Dow needs to make. So I think people are. Yeah, they're just, they, you know, they're unsure of how that would all work out. So it's, there's a lot of moving pieces to, like, how you raise the capital and what it's used for.
00:33:18.178 - 00:33:50.976, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk more about the. Maybe a couple misalignments, maybe that inside of maker, but save that for the end talking about governance stuff. So just to make sure I understand it, Sam, and this buffer, because I want to really make sure I understand before we move on. Right now, the buffer is like 1% of outstanding dire, 2% roughly mental math. Like, one to 3% of outstanding supply is in the risk buffer right now. If you look at traditional banks, they would never have a 2% risk buffer. They probably have a ten to 15% to 20% risk buffer.
00:33:50.976 - 00:34:13.476, Speaker A: If you guys increase the risk buffer, you can invest in more real world assets. You can deploy maker on other, maybe like less, not less secure chains, but maybe like push a little farther out on the risk spectrum. Within crypto, you can lend to probably different market makers, you can lower the collateralization ratios, you can. That's the thesis, as I understand it, for increasing the risk buffer.
00:34:13.580 - 00:34:14.460, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:34:14.572 - 00:34:49.568, Speaker A: Okay, what's your, when you guys think about. I want to talk about the d three model. When you, when you think about maker, the last couple of years, maker has been almost very b two c. Right? People go to maker, they deposit, they get dai. It feels like where maker is going is moving from b two c to b two b or more dow to dao, as is popularly talked about. So you've got the d three, the direct deposit dai module. Can you just tell why this is beneficial for maker and how someone like, who's an example of this? Maybe aave is utilizing the d three today.
00:34:49.568 - 00:34:50.632, Speaker A: D three m?
00:34:50.728 - 00:35:14.472, Speaker B: Yeah. The only d three m that's deployed right now is the aave one. But we will be releasing the compound one soon as well. Definitely. I don't think we should be abandoning retail users. I think the issue right now is that ethereum gas price, at least until recently, have been really high. So we've just lost a lot of the retail and more.
00:35:14.472 - 00:36:10.030, Speaker B: Our customers were like larger defi type exchanges like Nexo and Celsius and all them. So we do want to get retail back. And so this is why one of our highest priorities right now is getting maker deployed on l two s and other chains such that the gas prices will be much cheaper. People can kind of mess around and dip their feet into defi and use maker directly again. So there's definitely, I don't think anybody wants to abandon. But the observation with the d three Ms in general is that it's just a much more scalable model than having maker try and do everything itself. It's much better to have these other protocols, such as Aave compound, and there's other RWA ones like maple and truefi centrifuge, et cetera, that are highly focused and specialized on what they do best.
00:36:10.030 - 00:36:27.028, Speaker B: And it's much better to just look at maker exactly what it is. And it's basically, to me, it is the DAI stablecoin and. And a credit facility. So switching to just being a more high level wholesale creditor to these other protocols, I think we'll just scale much better.
00:36:27.196 - 00:37:03.060, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, as an outsider looking in, it feels like, don't reinvent the wheel here. Right. There are a lot of folks who need cheap credit. You need folks who are maybe have a more direct relationship with retail or have more expertise deal like assessing individual loans. Maker should stay very, very competitive on providing the lowest rates and innovating on credit wholesale on the credit wholesale market, instead of trying to assess these individual loans, both inside of both crypto native loans, but also on the real world asset side of things, I mean, that's an outsider looking in.
00:37:03.092 - 00:37:56.572, Speaker C: But I agree, and I think our experience, too, we have a really a decent amount of adoption with, like, large cap cryptos, ETH staked ETH wrapped bitcoin, but haven't really seen the same with, like, small caps or mid caps, stuff like defi tokens, governance tokens. And it seems like people who are using those assets on collateral really do tend to prefer somewhere like Aave or compound, where they can. They can use cross margin. They can actually earn a return on their collateral from people borrowing it. So, yeah, I think for certain types of assets, it's really a good fit for working with these sort of liquidity protocols, like compound and aave, rather than trying to go it alone.
00:37:56.668 - 00:38:04.108, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. So the d three m. You guys pick some complex names for these things. You guys got to.
00:38:04.156 - 00:38:06.184, Speaker B: I think stani picked that name, actually.
00:38:08.204 - 00:38:46.424, Speaker A: Direct deposit die d three m. So the way I understand it, for Aave, it's mutually beneficial. For Aave, the d three m, as I understand it, generates and deposits this freshly minted die to Aave's dai lending market. For Aave, this is good because it kind of stabilizes the borrow rate in their lending markets. And then for maker, you get to distribute dai liquidity to different protocols. Uh, just right now, Aave, but soon sounds like compound and then coming more like two different protocols and chains and l two s. It's a source of income, because you get this collection of, like, what is.
00:38:46.424 - 00:39:00.640, Speaker A: What is the dai on Aave? A Dai interest? Um, you get, like, it just becomes you. You increase Dai's attractiveness, essentially, for defi borrowers on secondary markets. Uh. Cause there's, like, lower borrow rates. So it's. It feels like a win win for both parties.
00:39:00.672 - 00:39:12.918, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, uh, really, our goal is to just improve the experience for people using Dai. It's not to be the best at everything. So, yeah, this is definitely a situation where it's a win win in my view.
00:39:13.046 - 00:39:42.694, Speaker A: If I was running a business where it was really, really obvious that the business was going b two b, and a lot of the revenue and a lot of the traction and growth was coming from the b two b business, and then I had this existing b two c business and it took up a lot of time and dealing with the community. And I'm not even talking crypto, I'm not talking maker right now and dealing with b two c. I would probably think about cutting the b two c business now is the, like, why not do that?
00:39:42.994 - 00:40:28.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's because it's already developed. We can just, once we get on these l two s and stuff, we can just deploy it for free. So, I mean, why not? And I don't think if it's sort of just in general, we shouldn't be abandoning end consumers. But like, especially because it's not a huge lift, I think we should still try and go after those markets and because there's sort of a more intangible where people are when they get started with Defi and all that stuff, and they're just learning, sort of having a positive, direct experience with maker can kind of be invaluable in some ways that are hard to measure. So having that available, I think there's added benefit there.
00:40:28.298 - 00:40:33.990, Speaker A: Monet, what do you think? Because you got to admit, there is an opportunity cost of dealing with the retail crowd.
00:40:34.182 - 00:40:59.094, Speaker C: Yeah, there is, for sure. I'll echo what Sam said. My first on chain transaction was just testing out a maker vault. I didn't need to borrow money for anything. It was just purely testing it out. But it was really cool and probably a big part of the reason why I ended up kind of landing at maker. And that's still where I participate most.
00:40:59.094 - 00:41:51.194, Speaker C: I also think, in a weird way, we're seeing a lot of defi credit protocols. They're sort of converging back onto maker's general framework of how lending works. Like, if you look at compound v three, each of the compound v three markets has only one borrowable asset, typically a stablecoin. And all the other assets are just strictly used as collateral to help, like isolate risk and prevent sort of like a cascading collapse of the market. And when you think about it, that's very similar to how maker works. You know, we have our vaults, the collateral is not borrowable. So as a user, you can be 100% sure that your collateral is safe, even if other borrowers don't manage their risk correctly.
00:41:51.194 - 00:42:00.862, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think we actually kind of have a winning product in a way, and I think sticking with it makes a lot of sense.
00:42:00.958 - 00:42:23.952, Speaker A: Yeah. How did you guys fare during, I mean, Sam, you mentioned, like, some of the folks that you were lending to or giving dai to, or like, Celsius and Nexo, how did you guys fare through the, I mean, the biggest, the folks who got hurt the most, and this is in bear market, have been the lenders, the blockfi's and Celsius, and genesis of the world. How did you guys fare through this?
00:42:24.048 - 00:42:41.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is the beauty of over collateralized lending on chain. You can see everything, and it went flawlessly. I think Celsius ended up repaying their loan. It was mostly in bitcoin, I believe. Yeah, yeah. That was the end of our business with them. Right.
00:42:41.060 - 00:42:47.064, Speaker B: Like, no need to discuss anything, and they just went on their way. So it's kind of the beauty of defi. Right?
00:42:47.364 - 00:43:02.064, Speaker A: Do you think you should, do you think that's the right model, though? Should you never be losing money on liquidations? Like, shouldn't you as a lender occasionally? Doesn't that mean you haven't optimized your risk for the highest return and reward? Like, shouldn't you occasionally lose money on liquidations?
00:43:03.444 - 00:43:33.468, Speaker C: I would tend to say yes. And we're probably from the last year, year and a half of history. We're probably, like, a little more conservative than we need to be. The flip side, though, is you never know. Kind of, it's really tough to know what the limit is and when you're pushing it too far. And when it rains, it pours in crypto. Like, we haven't seen a true test of the market, like, black Thursday in the past two years.
00:43:33.468 - 00:43:57.608, Speaker C: So I think we want to be sure that we're not going to blow up the protocol or cause Dai holders to lose money. And, yeah, I think we probably are more conservative than we need to be. But the flip side is, like, you never know when you're reaching for yield too much and then it bites you.
00:43:57.796 - 00:44:01.404, Speaker A: Yeah. Sam, what do you think about that? Agree?
00:44:01.824 - 00:44:39.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I tend to agree. I think we could probably push a little bit up the risk curve. I mean, this is part of why I was arguing for a larger surplus buffer, because I think we do need to have losses every now and then, I think is more optimal. But, yeah, there's maybe an argument for why Dai is so popular. Because we're so conservative. People are holding Dai to a massive degree compared to what we can get loans out for. So that may be because we're just, we have this brand of being so safe and conservative and stuff people can really trust holding dai, let's talk Ave.
00:44:39.764 - 00:45:16.116, Speaker A: For I want to talk about this trend of everyone releasing their own stables. You're seeing a bunch of, I feel like in c five over the last couple of years, like everyone starts differently with a different kind of niche product. Like whether you have a wallet or whether you're like a lend and borrow platform, like a blockfire, Celsius or Nexo, or like you're an exchange, you ultimately converge on becoming a bank. And you're starting to see this for, I mean, a crypto bank. You're starting to see this kind of vertical integration across the defi stack. Now you see like Aave releasing their own stablecoin. Frax is working on the specialized Amm and like an ETH staking and derivative and lending product.
00:45:16.116 - 00:45:27.154, Speaker A: Uni bought an NFT aggregator, osmosis is adding a lending protocol to their chain. I'm curious what you guys just think about this trend of. Maybe we could focus on protocol specific stable coins.
00:45:27.534 - 00:46:20.672, Speaker C: Yeah, I can hop in on this. I think for AavE in particular, they already focus on lending. So it's actually not that big of a leap for them to also add their own stablecoin to a lending market. The competencies involved in managing a stablecoin protocol and then one of those pools, lending protocols, very similar. So yeah, from a certain perspective, why not literally they just deploy a token and add it to Aave V three and they're already kind of off to the races. And then they also have a captive sort of like audience or so. So they can push these integrations out across various chains where they have Aave markets deployed.
00:46:20.672 - 00:47:16.084, Speaker C: So they have like a little bit of, a little bit of like a leg up in just like pushing integrations and trying to bootstrap usage of their stablecoin. I think it's somewhat similar for Curve, who's also expected to release a stablecoin. You know, they've been working on stable swaps from the jump, so they have a lot of experience in stablecoins and how they work. I think that most protocols though, I mean, they might find that it's really tough to bootstrap demand. You know, maker has organically grown sort of use cases for Dai. Demand for Dai, trust in Dai over a period of years and years. And we also had the benefit of basically being first among the decentralized stablecoins so back in 2019, if you wanted to hold a decentralized stablecoin, we were it.
00:47:16.084 - 00:47:34.246, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think that that'll be probably the biggest challenge for these projects, is how do you figure out who actually wants to hold the stablecoin? Is there a way to do that without just kind of having, like, massive token incentives and dilution that's going to harm your own core protocol?
00:47:34.350 - 00:47:40.794, Speaker A: Sam, what do you think valuable to defi for every protocol to launch a stablecoin, or everyone just fighting over a fixed pie of senior edge profits?
00:47:41.734 - 00:48:13.266, Speaker B: I think it's just sort of a natural evolution. You can see, I think a lot of these protocols were just all going to converge into doing the same thing, essentially. You can see this with fracs as well, which is now also doing real world assets and stuff like that. We are looking at some degree of sort of under collateralized lending. Not a huge amount, but, like, you know, maybe on the. On the edges. So I think we're going to kind of converge into more of a similar model with a lot of these protocols and just.
00:48:13.266 - 00:48:28.582, Speaker B: Just sort of like a natural forcing function, because, like, you're. If you look at it as, like a business, you're like, okay, what are my next steps? And so, like, the next thing for Ave to do was to launch a stable coin. That makes perfect sense.
00:48:28.638 - 00:48:28.830, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:28.862 - 00:48:40.966, Speaker B: That's what I would do if I was them. And I think it's, you know, it's sort of an inevitable development, and I think we'll see a bit more vertical integration in the ecosystem.
00:48:41.110 - 00:48:58.398, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so let's extend that out then, for maker, right? Sam of Frax has this. You mentioned Frax. They have this term. He has this term that he called the Trinity. Right, where he basically says that every protocol ends up converging on building a. The core defi offering, which is an ammo, a lending platform, and a stablecoin.
00:48:58.398 - 00:49:06.834, Speaker A: Right. If you look at maker, you've got the lending platform, you've got the stablecoin. You don't have the amm. So when. When am for maker?
00:49:07.574 - 00:49:14.470, Speaker B: I don't know. You're putting me on the spot here. I don't have any plans personally, but maybe somebody in the DAo is hooking something up.
00:49:14.542 - 00:49:17.994, Speaker A: Come on, Sam Monet, what do you think? Should maker have its own amm?
00:49:18.454 - 00:49:28.202, Speaker C: I actually don't think amms are a money making protocol. Like, I don't think there's really a business there, you know?
00:49:28.338 - 00:49:43.666, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe not just amm, but it's like some sort of dex liquidity. Like, you've got the native, the stable coin, and like a lender, like, leverage provider, then you've got Dex liquidity provider. I guess you could say the PSM.
00:49:43.850 - 00:49:48.712, Speaker B: Wasn'T it a synthetic assets? Wasn't that the last piece of the Trinity?
00:49:48.858 - 00:50:02.956, Speaker A: Was that the last piece? Okay, I think so. I thought it was a way to basically swap tokens, like some sort of Dex and Dex, then there's some sort of, like, lender, provider of leverage, then there's some sort of stable coin. But I could be wrong here.
00:50:03.060 - 00:50:35.576, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think we've seen a Dex that's able to capture any value, like, on that. Like, haven't seen one that's. That's profitable when you consider token incentives that they're paying. So, yeah, in my view, the only reason to launch a decentralized exchange is just to make sure that there's not going to be, like an attempt at value capture extraction that just forces you to shift your integration somewhere else.
00:50:35.680 - 00:51:00.464, Speaker B: I think this is kind of one of the beauties of Dexs so far, is that they can totally be open, permissionless, non controlled, that kind of stuff. Like Uniswap maybe, apart from the fee, is entirely there, immutable, permissionless, and it doesn't need governance. So I think that's kind of the beauty of the dex space.
00:51:01.884 - 00:51:12.264, Speaker A: Could you guys ever do something like what, fracs and curve. Like, almost like an alignment, like a la fracs curve, where you almost just align yourself with someone, like a uniswap or even a balancer?
00:51:12.404 - 00:52:01.316, Speaker C: I think to some extent we already do. With Uniswap, we have, I think, like almost like a billion and a half in capital that's deployed into uniswap liquidity pools. And there's kind of rough plans to do the same with curve and maybe with other Dex protocols over time. That's kind of like one of the ways that we're able to deploy our huge stablecoin reserves into something that's somewhat productive. It can earn non zero yield for the protocol and then provides more utility for DaI users. So, yeah, I think that there's definitely potential there in trying to partner and deploy assets into some of these Dex protocols.
00:52:01.420 - 00:52:26.044, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to wrap it with a couple questions on governance, actually. Can one of you guys take the. Take the task of deciphering runes, what's he call it, the master plan or whatever his God plan, whatever his big thing is, versus the rune plan, basically, versus the Hasu plan. I would love for one of you guys to break down both of those plans. Who wants to take it?
00:52:28.024 - 00:53:50.734, Speaker C: I can take a shot and then. Yeah, you can correct me, Sam, but so I think the Hasu plan is sort of familiar because basically it's creating like sort of a loose board of directors. Not really. It's not like they don't have executive control over anything, but kind of like a group of people who are empowered to help set strategy and help provide, like, more clear oversight and direction for the protocol and for the workforce. So, yeah, that I think Haseed's plan is fairly simple because it's already kind of familiar to structures that people use in organizations in the real world. I think Rune's plan is. It's got a lot of pieces and, yeah, it's more complicated, but I think his focus is that he wants to create a system that's like incentive compatible, so it is less reliant as much as possible on individual people having goodwill and remaining upstanding and just trying to break everything down into various incentive structures for government.
00:53:50.734 - 00:54:38.286, Speaker C: So there's a lot of elements to it. I think he wants to engage voters more and help voters kind of self organize so that they can serve as some of that direction and that oversight force that Hasu is kind of sort of putting more under like a committee or like a board. There's aspects of like, how do you contain like, costs and manage budgeting? There's a lot of plans about spreading out into these other verticals. Like makers should have a staking derivative and other sort of business lines. So, yeah, I think it's. I don't know. I probably don't do it justice.
00:54:38.286 - 00:54:45.210, Speaker C: And I think people, there's a summary of the endgame plan on the maker forum, which is very helpful.
00:54:45.342 - 00:55:10.562, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so if I had to maybe try, take a stab at it too. It's like Hasu is basically. Hasu is basically trying to introduce like this council a lot of things that look like traditional companies and corporates. Right. Like introduce basically board of directors. You get people who are elected for some term when they have good pay, they have kind of job security for a bit. They set the strategic direction, they coordinate between other units, aka other teams.
00:55:10.562 - 00:55:47.880, Speaker A: They have budgets, they get judged on performance. This sounds a lot like a company. And I think Kasu would probably say, look, it's been amazing what we've been able to do up to this point, what maker's been able to do up to this point, but to really ten x and to get to the next level, we're going to have to maybe not sacrifice decentralization. I wouldn't say that, actually. I would say maybe just restructure a bit and get a little more focused. Whereas Roon takes a very stay as decentralized, decentralization maxi approach as possible. I don't know if that's a good overview, but, Sam, where do you fall out? Which camp do you fall into?
00:55:48.072 - 00:56:25.964, Speaker B: Yeah, I've heard this sort of dichotomy between their two proposals. And I think where it's like, Hasoo's is like centralized corporate and runes is more like decentralization. And I don't think it's quite right. And it mostly comes from that. Hasoo's proposal with the Council of makers, which is the board of directors or whatever you want to call it, you know, everything has 20 names in crypto. There's no sort of executive power. And I think, like, furthermore, there's been ever since sort of the initial, I don't know what you want to call it, confrontation drama.
00:56:25.964 - 00:57:12.910, Speaker B: These two have been, like, working together a bit, and there's like, you know, there's a little bit more, I think, you know, combining ideas where their right, for example, Hasu proposed the constitution, and Rune seems on board with this idea, too. The idea of building a constitution, that was sort of the other part of the proposal. And I think despite what it appears in public, these two are more aligned than it may seem. But there are definitely key differences between them. And I think it's. Monet got that pretty right, which is just this point about having a single council versus rune more wants a multiple councils kind of thing. And I'll admit I don't fully understand all the details of the endgame.
00:57:12.910 - 00:57:36.346, Speaker B: I'm still kind of reading it over and learning it for myself. But, yeah, the gist of it, I think Rune wants to kind of solve everything by empowering the maker holders as much as possible and sort of fixing everything else with game theoretic incentives to minimize sort of the. The human side of things and corruption, all that kind of stuff, as much as possible. That's my view of it.
00:57:36.490 - 00:57:43.690, Speaker A: Where do you think the community falls? If you took a poll of the, I don't know, 50 people who work inside of maker, where do you think the community falls?
00:57:43.842 - 00:57:49.226, Speaker B: Like, I just. I don't think this is the right question. Like, are you on the end game or are you on Hasu's plan?
00:57:49.290 - 00:57:49.994, Speaker C: I see what you're saying.
00:57:50.074 - 00:58:02.432, Speaker A: You're saying the dichotomy that we're trying to create is not actually. It's not actually plan a and plan B. You're saying the end game. The end game is the wrong way to put it. What will eventually happen will be some sort of middle ground between, between the two players.
00:58:02.608 - 00:58:41.674, Speaker B: I'm hopeful because, I mean, I think most people are in agreement that governance is a little bit dysfunctional right now, especially as we enter the bear market. It's harder to, it's easy to hire teams and stuff like that, and everything's growing, everybody's happy. But, you know, when the bear hits, you got to make tough calls, like firing people, that kind of stuff. That's where it's sort of really been under strain, our initial design, but we're one of the first daos coming into existence. Of course we're not going to get it right on the first time. So my hope is some compromises reach and basically nobody's completely satisfied. But there's a way forward and people are satisfied enough and it sort of solves our problems.
00:58:41.674 - 00:58:42.570, Speaker B: That's my hope.
00:58:42.722 - 00:58:49.166, Speaker A: How has the DAO performed relative to being a company? If maker was a company, do you think things would be better or worse?
00:58:49.270 - 00:59:16.166, Speaker B: Depends on what you mean by better. I think things would be executed a lot faster. Daos are incredibly inefficient at sort of execution, but that's not what they're optimized for. That's not the goal for resilient resiliency. So in that regard, it seems to be working okay. But I mean, we haven't had strong sort of threats yet, so kind of building that out in anticipation is, I think, useful.
00:59:16.350 - 00:59:21.074, Speaker A: What is the threat that you'd be optimizing to be resistant against?
00:59:21.614 - 00:59:57.138, Speaker B: I guess like hostile nations. Yeah, I mean, I guess we said at the beginning, like sort of we can't be a completely hostile us is probably like game over to a lot of defi and maybe even a theory as a whole at this stage. But I think long term, when we become like bigger, we want to be resistant to this as much as we can. So, yeah, it would be like nation states, maybe not the US nation states would be useful. Yeah, stuff like that.
00:59:57.306 - 01:00:22.486, Speaker A: On one side you're trading off like efficiencies in governance, slower growth, and there are a bunch of downsides I could list to being a dao on the what youre getting in return is potential resistance against some nation states in the future. As you reflect on it today, like August 17, 2022, does that trade off still feel worth it too?
01:00:22.670 - 01:01:09.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, its kind of like this is why else are we kind of building this? If were not building it for resiliency against sort of like more like various threats and stuff like that. And it could be nation states. I kind of threw that out there. But there's all kinds of other things like governance, capture, rent, extraction, that kind of stuff. So I think it's important because these are more unknown unknowns about what's going to be in the future and what possible threats there could be to the protocol. We're building this for the experience of the end user, and so protecting them against all these threats to the best of our ability seems like it's like why we're here, right. Or else why are we building decentralized finance?
01:01:10.684 - 01:01:44.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I love seeing maker. In my opinion, maker is doing really, really well right now and has had a very. I know things seem probably crazy internally, but externally looking in, it seems like Maker is doing really well and has had an amazing last couple of months. And just a lot of things are really ramping up. Again, this is an outsize, I'm sure it's very messy internally over there. Uh, I love to see it because when, when things are going super well, like in the bull market, obviously, maker, probably you, you maybe have FOMo working inside of maker and you're like, oh, my God. All these other protocols are like growing so rapidly and the price of everything else is 100 xing.
01:01:44.744 - 01:02:20.076, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Uh, but what, but when shit really hits the fan, you can see who's, you know, who's, who's standing on the other side. And right now I feel like that's makers coming out first, so it's cool to see. Monet House said this tweet earlier today, said maker suffered a $400 million bank run after rumors that it could deep from USD and YEET, its USDC collateral into ETH. Emotion based governance and dow transparency are an explosive combo. 160 million withdrawn from the PSM. Do you think theres any, is this just what happens? Do you think theres any way to.
01:02:20.076 - 01:02:25.052, Speaker A: Is there any solution to this? Or this is just a byproduct of having full transparency?
01:02:25.228 - 01:02:56.764, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I don't really think there was ever even a plan or even like the seed of a plan to like, yeet all of our PSM, like stable coins into east. I think Ruhn just like mentioned it as like a possible, like, it's like, before even an idea in the discord. But yeah, we were fully transparent. Rune is, you know, he's a huge voter. He is the like, founder of the project. He has a lot of, a lot of influence in makers. So I think it kind of got blown out of all proportion.
01:02:56.764 - 01:04:17.598, Speaker C: And, you know, that's, in my opinion, like, this is proving, like, why Dai is super reliable and why you'd actually want to hold it is like, you know, people can move 400 million out of it in a day or in an hour or in a minute, and nothing's going to budge. Like, you know, everything is, is basically working exactly as designed in a certain sense, for people who are afraid about regulatory risk or collateral assets being frozen, this actually helps. All those outflows are just drawing down stable coins and increasing the share of assets that are in core crypto collaterals. Yeah, I think it's just kind of proving resilience, and this problem is kind of solving itself. I do think what it does show, on the other hand, is that people don't really understand how maker governance works. So there may have been people who actually believed that we were about to put on three and a half billion dollars of ETH price risk. So that's maybe an area for improvement.
01:04:17.598 - 01:04:30.526, Speaker C: Like, we need to help people understand, like, how does governance work at maker? You know, when do you actually need to start being concerned if you see some crazy ideas that somebody writes in a discord or in the forum?
01:04:30.630 - 01:04:41.114, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it makes for a fun for an entered. I feel like everyone was, I was in the office when that was happening last week. I feel like everyone was glued into the discord, like, holy shit, look at this. Yep.
01:04:41.154 - 01:05:03.658, Speaker B: So, I mean, that's one of the cool things about the DaO, right? This stuff, I think, happens in private companies all the time, but it's all behind the scenes in the DaO. Like, mostly everything is public, so every, like, it doesn't mean we're gonna act on any of these ideas, but it's just sort of like, hey, maybe we should do this. And all of a sudden it like, goes viral and you're like, okay, I.
01:05:03.666 - 01:05:41.616, Speaker A: Wanna wrap it with just a question around vision. I've seen a couple things on a couple folks discussing, like, is the end goal to become a decentralized bank, or is it to become a, like, wholesale lender? Or is it to become a decentralized currency? I saw. Who was it? Derek makers head of, I think, protocol engineering, Derek Flossman said on Twitter that the protocol had to decide whether its purpose was to run a decentralized and de risked credit facility, or if the goal is to build an investment vehicle that maximizes profit. I want to get both your guys takes as the last question here, Sam. What is the goal of maker.
01:05:41.720 - 01:05:45.336, Speaker B: I can't give you the goal of maker because it's a dao. I can give you my own.
01:05:45.440 - 01:05:47.524, Speaker A: What is your, what is your.
01:05:49.144 - 01:06:31.322, Speaker B: My personal view is I would prefer Dai to be like a well regarded, credibly neutral currency in the world as an alternative to all these state fiat currencies. That's my personal view of it. But on the other side, you know, we need to have revenues and stuff, if not for anything else, to sort of boost Dai's status by turning on things like the dai savings rate to help it grow and provide, you know, giving back to the holders of Dai to boost it in the world. So I think we should be cognizant of the revenues and stuff like that. But me personally. Yeah, it is, it is about the currency still, for me.
01:06:31.378 - 01:06:32.938, Speaker A: Yeah. Monet, what do you think?
01:06:33.066 - 01:07:56.070, Speaker C: I would tend to agree. I think, yeah, we want to offer the world a de risk, decentralized, transparent, non discriminatory money, like really be just base layer financial infrastructure for people who are being iced out of the financial system. Now, historically though, I think money has typically started from basically commercial banking and stuff that looks a lot more like just like a private lending facility. And then as it scales and as it becomes more resilient and kind of ossifies, it ends up becoming a central bank or becoming some sort of like core clearing facility. So I think that we're kind of developing in the short run as basically the centralized commercial bank, if you will, or something similar like that. But I do think the end goal is we want to develop into actual money and that, I can't say how that will look. We may keep the US dollar peg for the long run or maybe even forever.
01:07:56.070 - 01:08:11.314, Speaker C: We may end up shifting off of it. But yeah, I think the vision is definitely much bigger than just, for me, at least it's much bigger than just being like Blackstone on the blockchain or something like that.
01:08:11.654 - 01:08:18.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad to hear that. This has been awesome, guys. Really appreciate both you guys coming on. Any last words you guys want to share before we wrap it up?
01:08:18.974 - 01:08:38.470, Speaker B: I would say if you're listening to this and this excites you, I would say get involved in maker. Know we need all the help we can get. Get involved in the forums. There's more and more people signing up for recognized delegates, including the host here. So, yeah, I would say just, just get involved. It's a lot of fun.
01:08:38.582 - 01:08:40.286, Speaker A: Monet cosign?
01:08:40.390 - 01:08:55.686, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I pretty much like fell backwards into maker and it's, yeah, it's been one of the best things to happen to me. So, yeah, if you're interested, there is. There's probably. Probably room for you to contribute.
01:08:55.790 - 01:09:07.182, Speaker A: Amazing. All right, thanks, guys. Link. We'll put a link to both of their twitters right down in the show notes. We will also add some more info on Maker. Thanks again, guys. Talk to you guys soon.
01:09:07.238 - 01:09:07.534, Speaker B: Thank you.
