00:00:00.320 - 00:00:22.494, Speaker A: Awesome. Everyone, I'm excited. We've got, I think, 30 or 40 minutes to talk about DeFi. I had this whole great panel scripted out. I was super excited for what we were going to talk about. And then the space kind of blew up, and a project blew up, and $50 billion worth of capital was kind of wiped out of the system just from one ecosystem. And that kind of blew up this panel for what I wanted to talk about.
00:00:22.494 - 00:01:06.564, Speaker A: So we're going to pivot and talk about some interesting things. But one thing I want to ask you all first is before all this terra, UST Luna stuff happened, we kept seeing hacks, and we kept seeing just different smart contract platforms blow up. We had different bridges that got kind of blown up, different. Not scams, but different smart contract things happened. What we saw with UST and Luna and just the terra ecosystem was not a hack. Nothing on the infrastructure side broke. So maybe, Josh, I'd throw it over to you and just ask you on the infrastructure and on the defi side, what do you make of what happened recently with just last week's events?
00:01:06.724 - 00:01:52.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's fair to say, despite some of us having met each other years ago, that this is extremely early days for crypto. We're extremely early with any kind of innovation. Things break, and when they break, and it's a large project, it's an extremely catastrophic event. And so I think, to your point, the infrastructure here itself didn't break. What did break was the model and the assumptions that came with that model. And when a project like Terra grows so quickly and all the variables of risk coalesce around it, it's really difficult to map out. However good you are at game theory, what's going to happen with a project like this? The positive note is that the infrastructure didn't break.
00:01:52.154 - 00:02:19.467, Speaker B: The infrastructure kept performing. There were some problems with the chain, but overall, the infrastructure that supported the ecosystem kept working. But the actual underlying assumptions and the modeling behind some of the, for example, UST and anchor mechanisms were untested at a scale like this. So that's what broke. The model itself broke, as opposed to the infrastructure. So there is a little bit of a positive note that we can abstract from this story.
00:02:19.595 - 00:02:57.534, Speaker A: Yeah, Constantine, I think I'd throw it over to you and just ask. I mean, we've got this amazing ethos of title of the conference, permissionless, decentralized the world, and we finally have this decentralized stablecoin that we can use, and the whole thing blows up. Does this make you less optimistic about the entire system. Does it make you, was this very concentrated risk and it makes you less optimistic about decentralized algorithmic stablecoins? How does this impact just your, how you think about using DeFi and just the decentralized infrastructure as the backbone of this new economy?
00:02:57.954 - 00:03:17.746, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Maybe just to explain my viewpoint into it. Obviously, blockdemon is a node operator. We're the largest node operator in the world. We run nodes for transaction throughput, data reads, validation, and then yield earning. And we do that for the 50 largest protocols. So we run a lot of hard physical infrastructure.
00:03:17.746 - 00:03:59.854, Speaker C: We also obviously run infrastructure on terra, and we have API products, RPC nodes, validators. We had the whole shebang up. And technically it was actually a fairly sophisticated network compared to some of the others. I think what's interesting, when you think about infrastructure, it's a really wide term. And so there's the physical technical infrastructure, there's a software component, and then there's actually a financial component. And I think what we're learning a lot is that the tokenomics and the value system driving these decentralized ecosystems also need stability components in them. And so an algorithmic stable token ideally should have been designed in a way where it can hold a pack.
00:03:59.854 - 00:05:00.994, Speaker C: But the question is, is that mathematically possible if you have ultimately an attacker with massive resources? And one of the complexities is the interconnectivity of all these different protocols? You mentioned the bridges and all those things, as well as the 24/7 tradability of all these different assets. And so all I would say is, from my perspective, I'm super excited about even probably algorithmic stable tokens. But I think you need insurance products, you need a lot more institutional grade security systems, not just on the physical tech side, which I think we have at this point in the community, but really around insurance, for example, as well as we talked backstage, a little, even disclaimers, information rights for people who participate in these networks. So I think that's really one of the big learnings here, is that the governance infrastructure needs to evolve a lot for this to be efficient.
00:05:01.974 - 00:05:10.142, Speaker A: How could governance have fixed this? You said the governance infrastructure needs to get fixed. What was wrong with the governance here?
00:05:10.318 - 00:06:00.780, Speaker C: Well, I don't have any particular deep inside views into it. The question is that with Terra you could make the argument that it was a fairly centralized system where there was down to an individual, a person who could make economic decisions for the whole of the network. And so there wasn't decentralized governance, deciding how to structure the economic system, how to also expose the system, how to potentially secure insurances and other bits and pieces. And so there was no control mechanisms. Also looking at ultimately what the Terra foundation did, and I'm not necessarily blaming them. You know, they obviously went in pretty heavily, and, you know, and that's, they stood by their project, and so that's great.
00:06:00.852 - 00:06:42.128, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's talk about governance for a second with DeFi, because I think what we realized with DAos is that daos, the product market fit for daos, was with DeFi, actually. And we realized in 2021 and maybe even back to 2020 that a lot of these DeFi protocols, the best way to govern them is with a DaO. And so you had a lot of Uniswap and maker, and Aave Grantsdao is the sponsor of the event, and a lot of these DeFi protocols ended up getting governed by these daos. Eric, you guys at shapeshift ended up turning it. I don't know if you call it dissolving and turning into a Dow or evolving, maybe. And, Josh, you guys are in the process of thinking about what a Dow could look like.
00:06:42.128 - 00:07:02.304, Speaker A: How do you think Dow governance will play out as we look into the next maybe 18 to 24 months? Maybe the market slows down. Was the debt, where Daos a byproduct of being in this very frothy, hot bull market and any sort of dow could have worked? What does the future of maybe governance in Daos look like? Eric?
00:07:03.364 - 00:07:46.880, Speaker D: So daos are a fascinating new area of organizational development. I was highly skeptical when I first started hearing about them. Like, they sounded very kind of like ethereum, rainbow person, Kumbaya, like communist circle. And yet what I'm seeing is that Daos are simply one of the latest outcroppings of the ability to decentralize human interactions. So bitcoin figured out this with money, and we've been discovering all sorts of other ways that we can use decentralization to change how humans interact with each other. I think daos have a huge future. I don't think every organization should be a DAO.
00:07:46.880 - 00:08:18.564, Speaker D: It's probably appropriate for a minority, but certainly in the realm of crypto, where we're doing something that is global, natively digital, and highly contentious from a regulatory perspective, the decentralized model for governance has risen to fill that void. So shapeshift is just experimenting with that. And I think no one should assume that the best practices of daos have been figured out yet. We're at the very earliest days of discovering how these can be built.
00:08:18.684 - 00:09:04.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not going to call out which Dao this was, but I was looking at one of the forums like three weeks ago, and on the forum, the entire DAO, there's like 2000 people on this thing debating whether or not the company should spend like $500 at their offsite to go to the lake in the afternoon. I don't know much about governance, but I can assure you that is not the right way to govern a company. So when you think about why these things, why Daos, especially as they relate to defi, why they're even useful, I can look at the numbers, I can look at Uniswap's volume, or I can look at, you know, maker, I can look at the success stories. But when you actually think about why a DAo is necessary here, Josh, I'd throw it back to you. Like, why are you guys thinking about this model? Why is it better?
00:09:04.752 - 00:10:01.748, Speaker B: Yeah, Daos for the sake of daos are a recipe for failure because it can tend to become, you know, this purist, direct democracy model where everybody has a voice on absolutely every decision. That decision that you've referenced there is a great example of that. Now, from our perspective, really what credo does is it's a decentralized custody and settlement platform. We use a blockchain to track the assets that sit within our custodial technology. That blockchain is a delegated proof of stake blockchain. So that piece of the business, the development of that chain, the ongoing iteration of that chain, we think will fundamentally benefit from, from being part of a decentralized governance process. Now, the thing that we found difficult is trying to figure out what kind of DAO structure to implement, because there's very strong views around different types of DAO structures, federated models, commissioned models, council models.
00:10:01.748 - 00:10:51.042, Speaker B: There are various types of DAO structures on a full spectrum. So for us, what we've been struggling with and getting our brain around is exactly what kind of Dao would add the most value to the ongoing development of the credo chain. But what we have really strong conviction on is that the wealth of kind of insight and ideas that comes with decentralizing your governance process definitely outweighs some of the logistical problems that it may bring. We want to move fast, but we want to move fast in a way that takes into account the best ideas and minds in this space. And by having a Dao, you open that door and you keep it open to retaining the best ideas and talent participating in your project. So for us, it's very early days. We're operating what we call a distributed model.
00:10:51.042 - 00:11:02.254, Speaker B: Very soon we want to start the actual Dao model, and I'm sure there are going to be various iterations within that. And I'm sure I'm going to be calling Eric up, asking him for some tips because he's been through it before.
00:11:02.914 - 00:12:03.114, Speaker D: I'll add that probably the best thing about DAos, when structured correctly, is that they reduce friction in lots of things that a corporation might see friction in. So to give one anecdote, shapeshift was a centralized company for eight years. And when we wanted to hire someone, we would have to go through this whole HR nonsense, like this whole recruiting bullshit. That depends not only on where we're hiring them from, but where the person is located. So we would have to analyze, like the HR law of two countries, many rules of which were designed, like, decades ago, and many of the newer rules are even worse. And it got so bad, such high friction with hiring someone that, for example, we had a corporate policy that we would never hire anyone in the country of France. How many wonderful, talented individuals are in France? Millions.
00:12:03.114 - 00:12:34.290, Speaker D: But we would not hire them because in France you can't really fire people without months of work and bureaucracy. And so that's a friction point. And as an organization, there were just swaths of the world that we couldn't ever work with. As a Dao, that concern goes completely away. If we find an interesting person that we want to work with, we just work with them. It's very civilized, right. They say what they'll do, we say what we'll pay and we just work together and it reduces the friction, I think, when designed.
00:12:34.290 - 00:12:44.694, Speaker D: Well, that's the real benefit of these daos, is that they just let people get back to building together as humans and get away from all the corporate bureaucracy that's built up over two centuries.
00:12:45.514 - 00:12:47.694, Speaker A: So it's basically regulatory arbitrage.
00:12:48.034 - 00:13:02.608, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Capital and talent flow to where the friction is lowest. I think that's the law of the universe. And daos, when designed correctly, are that lowest point in friction. So that's why we're seeing attention flow into it.
00:13:02.696 - 00:13:21.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to bring it back to Defi a little bit. One of the things that Defi has been, I was really found product market fit with is just borrow and lend. And Joe, I'd throw it over to you. I mean, you guys are not a dao. You're a centralized company, and you do a lot of financing for miners. Right? How do you think about how DeFi just plays into your business?
00:13:22.734 - 00:14:18.854, Speaker E: Yeah. So with the mining business, we've got the number one bitcoin mining pool at foundry. We've deployed about $500 million into the ecosystem of bitcoin between financing bitcoin mining pool, and some of the other things that we do. And so when it comes to Defi on the mining side specifically, we are in talks all the time with the top miners and thinking about with them, how they can manage their risk, what their needs are in terms of the mining pool. And what we're seeing happening is that although crypto is still very nascent, the miners are the most experienced folks in the ecosystem many times. And so, to give an example, they're typically very worried about their costs, and that's typically the mining machine costs, the electrical costs, but they're very good at cutting those costs, lowering them, squeezing out margin however they can. And so something we've seen them do is traditionally, when they mine the bitcoin, they would sell it, cover costs, hold it on their balance sheets, and that was it.
00:14:18.854 - 00:14:51.644, Speaker E: But now, in working with our sister company, Genesis, we're seeing them opening up to different ideas around what they can do with that bitcoin on their balance sheet. So they are starting to lend it out. They are starting to hedge against market downturns like this and just overall get more sophisticated. And so we're looking at what kind of products we can build alongside Genesis for those bitcoin miners. On the other side of the equation, we do staking, just like Constantine, and we are looking at other unique products we can offer there, whether it's around Ethereum, the upcoming merge, and some of the other staking programs that we run.
00:14:52.904 - 00:15:33.392, Speaker A: You mentioned staking. I was talking to. We had this vip permi party thing for the speakers and some of the permit holders last night. And I was talking to one of the folks, and he actually runs his own node still. And I said, I asked him about Lido and just like, staking, liquid staking and stuff like that. And he said, yeah, look, if I was just in it for the investment, I would actually just use just allocate capital to liquid staking. So one thing I'm curious about, and it just got me thinking earlier today about should retail and just consumers ever interact with DeFi, or do you guys, when you think about the evolution of DeFi right now, everyone interacts with DeFi.
00:15:33.392 - 00:15:59.974, Speaker A: You could be a large institution, or you could be, I mean, a 23 year old with $100, right? You could allocate to aave or uniswap or whatever it might be. If you project out to like, let's say 20, 23, 20, or I guess that's next year, 2025. Are consumers ever touching DeFi or are they just. Or is defi behind just kind of the, is it almost like more of a utility in the space? And there are these front ends that plug into defi constant. I'd throw it to you first.
00:16:00.634 - 00:17:10.886, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, so I think one of the points that's interesting is should individuals run nodes? And obviously in the context of decentralized protocols, that's admirable and something we should want ideally. The reality often specifically when it comes, for example, to staking networks, is that there's a lot of risk in doing so. Right. And also the technical requirements in order to run infrastructure that ultimately supports the network can be very time and resource intensive, which is why you have companies like foundry or block Daemon who really do this, probably mostly for institutional grade customers. And so we run this infrastructure as a b, two b two c company. So from that end, I agree with that statement is like, ultimately rerun the sort of backbone for, let's say, an exchange allows their customers to earn yield across certain products. And so ultimately it's, I think as a mass product, you need intermediaries for a while, probably mostly because interacting with software is never a linear experience over time.
00:17:10.886 - 00:18:00.854, Speaker C: Right. Like, so there's updates to software, there's all these sort of different things. So interacting with a smart contract as an individual can be fairly complex and you can make mistakes and lose a lot of assets. And so then again, we talk about insurance products and underlying sort of stability here and stuff. But I think it's interesting that for Ethereum specifically, that on one hand, there's an interest in the community to have individuals run their own validators. On the other hand, there's also a risk that you get slash and loose assets. And so the, the disclaimers again on that should be a little more clear, like, what are the exact performance requirements? So you as an individual can operate your own node in order to help secure the network, or, you know, do you interact with, you know, one of the parties here in order to do so? So there's a lot of different ways to do it.
00:18:00.854 - 00:18:19.658, Speaker C: I think it takes a little bit of each to find the right structure over time, but I think we're really still in experimentation phase, ultimately. I mean, it's really very, very early still specifically on that level. Like, who should run notes and how. I think it'll change a lot over time.
00:18:19.746 - 00:18:43.838, Speaker A: Yeah, Josh, I'll throw this next one to you. Santiago and I had Olaf Carlson, we from Polychain, on the podcast last week. And one thing that he mentioned, he said, look, the kind of CFI companies will be the on ramps, and the reason being they can plug in with the banks. DeFi will own the order books. So again, Cefi owns the onramp, DeFi owns the order books. Would you agree or disagree with that?
00:18:43.926 - 00:19:15.000, Speaker B: Interesting. I think historically DeFi has been really difficult to access for most people. If you say to them, you've got to open your metamask, you've got to plug your ledger in, you've got to add an RPC network, you've got to make sure the token's been added. Most people will look at you like you're a lunatic. It's really difficult to get your average person to do their first transaction. And I mean your average person, maybe not the people in this room, but your average person. So the friction associated with being involved in DeFi is pretty high, and it has been historically.
00:19:15.000 - 00:20:05.800, Speaker B: Now what we're seeing is a, and a great example is what you saw at the Coinbase presentation earlier is making the entry point into DeFi easier and easier. And that's a mission that we're on. Enabling people to create NPC secured, decentralized wallets and then at their own volition, connect those wallets to any, for example, web3 wallet like metamask or wallet connect or connect that directly to a DeFi protocol. In our mind, it's all about choice, freedom of choice. I think there will be inevitably easier user journeys, and Coinbase seem to be finding a place within that that is giving. Their centralized Coinbase app uses the ability to open a self custodial wallet within that environment and connect that to different ecosystems. I think that's great because it means the whole user journey gets easier and easier.
00:20:05.800 - 00:21:17.330, Speaker B: The question will be, can you create a decentralized user journey that is as good or better than a centralized service? I think we've seen some examples of that and there are still some teething pains in the space. But overall, giving people access to decentralized finance is really important because it's very easy for us in the US or the UK or Europe to say, well, do people really need access to this decentralized space? Having worked at different exchanges and had teams around the world in places where they couldn't get banked, where you can't get payroll, where sometimes you can't open a bank account because you live in a certain place, or you're from a certain country and your bank account gets shut down, you're giving people the means to hold onto and protect and safeguard their own value. So from a moral perspective, I think it's really important that both the decentralized and the centralized space try and work together to figure out the right way to give people that access, because it is so, so important for everyone, not just us in this room here in the US, but for folks that are unbanked as well, giving them the tools that they can use to receive their salary. As one simple example.
00:21:17.442 - 00:21:58.258, Speaker C: Yeah. One addition maybe, is really the key difference between DeFi and c five is around identity. And so that's really currently the really big issue is we're actually still jewish solid identity product. I think in crypto that solves a lot of the issues that we still experience in the flow. And so the whole context of DeFI is that the question is anything that has KYC DeFi. And so the identity products are really the reason why CFI is so attractive. We run a lot of CFI infrastructure for banks and stuff, where a lot of the regulatory requirements require background checks on individuals who hold assets and stuff.
00:21:58.258 - 00:22:09.758, Speaker C: And so I think until you have a really cool, I don't know if it's a ZK product or whatever it is an identity product that can seamlessly slot into these systems, you'll always need CFI on rams.
00:22:09.886 - 00:22:48.484, Speaker E: That's one of the thought exercises I go through, just for fun in my head, is how do the banks adjust to Defi? And one of the things they have going for them is distribution. And I know everyone's kind of anti bank, and that's not really the ethos here, but they have distribution. And if we think to NBA top shot, for an example, what that did was it basically made blockchain invisible behind the scenes. But you had digital ownership over those moments. And so folks could just come in. I had a lot of friends who didn't have any blockchain experience, but they went on NBA Top shot, bought some moments, thought it was cool, and they were guaranteed that that was a finite amount of that moment. I've done a lot of work with sports cards and investing in sports cards and things like that.
00:22:48.484 - 00:22:58.980, Speaker E: You never know how many LeBron rookie cards are really out there, unless it's a serial numbered one. And even then you're not always sure, because there's a lot of fakes. So I think about, do the banks build their own l two s?
00:22:59.012 - 00:22:59.230, Speaker D: Do the.
00:22:59.252 - 00:23:27.644, Speaker E: They each have their own l two. And then for the user, they simply log in and click a button, and they're getting a higher percentage yield because it's generated differently than traditional ways that the bank that would create that interest. And I think it's just an interesting thought exercise around the product experience again, because that's what I try to look through. Everything through is the product experience. And I think we do have a lot of ways to go with Defi, whether it's disclosures or not, but giving people the freedom they deserve, but also making it somewhat predictable.
00:23:28.304 - 00:23:34.884, Speaker A: Joe, you're scaring me. I heard us saying that when we start talking about enterprise blockchain again, that's how, you know we're in the heart of the bear market.
00:23:35.224 - 00:23:36.936, Speaker E: Gotta get through it, gotta work it out.
00:23:37.080 - 00:24:34.162, Speaker A: You just mentioned it, my friend, but actually I think you touched on an important part. So banks own, you said the distribution, but really what you're talking, you're talking about the users, and they have the capital, everyone, we all hate the banks, but yet I still use my bank account that I got when my mom signed me up when I was a kid, I'm sure, even though I hate it. But the downside of these banks is that on my bank account, I have no interest. I think they even just took away the idea of interest in my checking account. I don't even think they're lying and saying, you get 0.001. I think they just set it zero. Do these banks look at something like Aave and compound and stuff like that and say, all right, well, now we can offer 3%, 2%, 4%, and do they integrate with those folks or do they basically just ignore it and say, eh, you know what, we've got the regulations, we're in with the regulators, we've got the licenses, we'll keep 0%, and we think our regulatory moat is strong enough.
00:24:34.162 - 00:24:35.474, Speaker A: What do you think about that, Joe?
00:24:35.594 - 00:25:16.950, Speaker E: I think the best banks who are more forward facing fidelity typically comes to mind. For an example, they do a lot of work on bitcoin and other investible products in the crypto space. I think they would maybe explore both and try both and see what works, while others will probably more be traditional minded and not even give it a second thought. And I think those are the ones that are probably not going to make it, frankly. And this is not a next year bet or a two year or three year bet, but over ten years, I mean, there's going to be the Coinbase and the Coinbase equivalents, more apps popping up that can provide more interest by integrating with Aave or other products and ultimately give the users what they want. So banks will still have some purpose, most likely, but I think they're going to just become more relevant if they don't adjust, just somehow innovate.
00:25:17.142 - 00:25:17.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:17.534 - 00:25:36.774, Speaker C: And I think staking really is the entry point into yield earning for more traditional banks, as far as we see it. Right. Like it's sort of kind of the interest on your current account type. Right. You hold ETH in a wallet. Right. And once the merger occurs, you automatically will earn interest if you do so on Kraken or Coinbase or any other exchange.
00:25:36.774 - 00:26:09.694, Speaker C: And so companies like PayPal and other banks who allow you, for example, to purchase ETH and hold it will have to offer interest if they want to stay competitive. And the way we garner this interest is by staking products. And so I think that's a really interesting use case. And we definitely have seen a huge uptick in at least interest. Right. And we work, we have investors like Goldman Sachs and stuff who engage in a lot of these activities with a lot of intent these days, I would say, compared to earlier, I think definitely there's been a lot more movement.
00:26:10.994 - 00:26:12.130, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead, Eric.
00:26:12.282 - 00:26:54.654, Speaker D: So the web3 model, I think is important here. And there's another analogy of some incumbents, which had all the distribution and all the capital. And you can think of the major news media networks, pre Internet, they were sitting very comfortably. You know, they were heavily regulated, they'd been there forever. They were well capitalized, they had all the distribution. And yet the Internet comes along and suddenly reduces the friction, the cost of producing content to nearly zero. And those companies lost their distribution and they still exist, but they are a shadow of their former self.
00:26:54.654 - 00:27:43.164, Speaker D: I think a very similar phenomenon is going to happen with banking and finance. There is no reason that a normal person should want to use a bank in which they earn less interest and they have no ownership in the underlying operations of it, versus something like Aave, where once they get over the learning curve, it's actually far easier to use than a bank. And you can actually own part of AAve. I mean, that is the web3 ethos. And I think once people get a taste for that, they don't, they don't go back. There's a reason that these conferences get bigger and bigger each year. It's because once you get into this world, you realize that the ownership of networks is profound, and the banks that will survive will be the ones that tokenize themselves.
00:27:43.164 - 00:28:07.232, Speaker D: And I see zero banks ever able to tokenize themselves, frankly. So, yeah, I think the DeFi apps UX is already better than what banks are and give it a few more years and more people getting comfortable with the stuff. The banks are totally screwed. What are they going to do? They don't even accept bitcoin payments yet, and they've had a decade to do that, so they're in big trouble.
00:28:07.328 - 00:28:42.654, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think you make a really good point. Yeah. Once people enter DeFi, you don't go out. Nobody ever gets USDC and turns it back into fiat. So I think I can push back on that. I think I actually disagree with you because let's take one of the web, three wallets or something. I don't want to call out anyone by name, but maybe you're comfortable holding $2,000 in there, but you're not comfortable holding your life savings in there, and you're not comfortable holding your net worth in your Google chrome extension.
00:28:42.654 - 00:29:05.984, Speaker A: Going back to my original question about where do you actually interact with these folks? Do you? Is it maybe the banks don't interact with the DeFi applications, but is it the fintechs that interact with them? Or you think that eventually the wallets of the world get good enough and the security gets good enough that you do hold your entire net worth on your Google Chrome extension?
00:29:06.764 - 00:29:54.774, Speaker D: I would say I'm one of the world's biggest self custody advocates, and I do not believe that most people will hold most of their wealth in self custody. So there's a hybrid here in which the ability to hold your assets in self custody is what's really important. And anyone who wants to do that can do that easily. But I think the service provided by centralized custodians can be profoundly good. So I don't see a world in which centralized custodians go away, but they are going to sit on top of the DeFi protocols, like these networks, the money layers, the software protocols. That's what this is all going to be based on. And so whether you're interacting directly with the protocol or whether you're interacting with the custodian, they are interacting with the protocol, and that's the structure that we're going to see.
00:29:54.774 - 00:30:07.794, Speaker D: So instead of, like, governments and fiat currencies and analog banks, we have code and blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and apps, and those apps can be centralized or decentralized.
00:30:08.444 - 00:30:29.956, Speaker A: I don't know who to throw this next question to, but just one thing that this conversation has me wondering is about insurance. One thing that you have in, let's say I've got my money at Wells Fargo or Bank of America, if something happens, I call them up and say, hey, this thing just got taken out. Can you put it back in? Or if it ever gets hacked, there's FDIC insurance. Why doesn't that exist in crypto yet?
00:30:30.060 - 00:30:30.556, Speaker C: It does.
00:30:30.620 - 00:30:31.996, Speaker B: It does, yeah, yeah.
00:30:32.060 - 00:30:33.820, Speaker C: I mean, there's components of it, right?
00:30:33.892 - 00:30:36.734, Speaker A: So for example, sometimes, like Nexus mutual or whatever for defi.
00:30:36.884 - 00:31:32.280, Speaker C: So for example, on our staking notes, we have institutional insurance for slashing that we've secured, which I think we were the first to do that, which means that we can guarantee that if we get slashed, you get make hole, we can make you a hole. And so I think that's beginning and that's an important bit. But ultimately you need a balance sheet and you need ways to kind of engineer it probably a little bit over time. But it's just, just, I think really a regulatory, really complex problem, at least from our side. We've offered insurance initially from our own token treasury when we started out, because we felt it's never fair that anyone who connects a wallet to a node we operate gets penalized if we make a mistake operating the node. And so our mantra was always, we always make people whole. It's just when we got enough volume, we were a little nervous that we might physically not possibly, it might not possible for us to do so.
00:31:32.280 - 00:31:37.244, Speaker C: And that's when insurance became paramount and we found a provider finally. But it took years.
00:31:38.944 - 00:31:54.416, Speaker A: I mean, you guys work really closely with metamask. Why? So, I know you're mentioning Constantine, you mentioned slashing insurance, but how long is it until just the capital in your metamask or your coinbase wallet, if something happens to that, why isn't there insurance there?
00:31:54.520 - 00:33:03.804, Speaker B: So what we're seeing now in, in DeFi is there are various layers of insurance that can apply. So if you apply this to us at credo, it's taken us two and a half years working with Lloyds of London, various insurance brokers, to get various insurance policies over our infrastructure. So at the first layer, we have a crime insurance policy that's provided by Lloyds of London and that covers crime related events over the assets held in our, in our chain. Then we have another layer, which is called an in specie insurance policy, where the cryptographic material, that is the broken up secrets, that is what most people think of them as shards that distribute themselves across our network, because that's how our network safeguards cryptographic information, that those pieces of cryptographic information are deemed to be a thing. So the insurance in specie covers that material. It's taken us a long time to get there. We've had hours and hours of meetings with different insurance providers to get to this point where we, as a decentralized infrastructure solution, have centralized insurance over various layers of our stack.
00:33:03.804 - 00:33:59.232, Speaker B: What this means in my mind is that it's getting easier and easier as a platform protocol. Whatever kind of DeFi solution that you are to walk into a room with the right insurers and have the right response, they may not tick the box and say off you go, but they will listen to you. They understand your business model, they understand concepts like slashing, for example. They're getting more and more up to speed because this is a really big opportunity for them. So as a decentralized infrastructure platform, at Credo, we've managed to get insurance over our decentralized infrastructure, but then we overlay that by enabling folks like Nexus mutual to offer certain insurance policies to certain clients that have certain assets in a wallet. So various layers of insurance start to apply to your activity in Defi. And one could say that this is even more protection than exists in the centralized space.
00:33:59.232 - 00:34:35.974, Speaker B: If I go and do a certain trade on my broker dealer account and something goes wrong with the infrastructure, I've probably lost my funds. And if I haven't lost my funds, I'm going to get a voucher and they're going to say, sorry for that mistake. We'll do our best next time. Whereas in Defi, if you want to play smart, you can cover yourself with various layers of insurance, and I think that's going to expand. More and more people are taking on more and more risk from an insurance perspective. They're getting more and more comfortable writing larger insurance policies, and there certainly is an appetite within the decentralized space to start leveraging these new, innovative insurance policies.
00:34:37.154 - 00:35:26.348, Speaker D: I want to maybe point out here that everyone feels very comfortable with their FDIC insured bank account, but you're all getting robbed and not paid back just on the basis of inflation. So like, crypto comes along and is actually providing an entirely new paradigm compared to an FDIC insured bank, which you still had 8.5% of your, your money stolen from that bank account this year. Somehow people don't realize that that's what happened to them because the numbers stayed the same, but the value went down. But there's a lot of myths, I think, in traditional finance, but people are just comfortable with it. That's how they've always done things and they don't really question it very much. Crypto comes along and turns all this stuff upside down and is going to look very different than traditional, traditional finance.
00:35:26.348 - 00:35:37.904, Speaker D: And because it's all open source and provably knowable, I think you can actually see insurance markets that become much more robust and real because the underlying money can actually be sound. Finally.
00:35:39.084 - 00:36:14.392, Speaker A: It's a really good way to put it, looking at the clock. We've got a couple minutes left here, so I just want to zoom far, much farther out from insurance and things like that and ask about two things. And the first one is the ETH merge coming up. And Constantine, I'd probably throw this one to you. On one hand, it feels like we are headed into the heart of another bear market. On the other hand, we've got this ETH merge coming up, which turns ETH into this yield generating asset that is deflationary and ESG friendly. So it satisfies the mandates of the large institutions who invest with ESG funds.
00:36:14.392 - 00:36:31.024, Speaker A: What is your framework for looking at the next maybe six to twelve months in crypto? Do we just slide back into this 2018 2019 bear market, or do we, is it a rough couple of months and then the merge catapults us back?
00:36:31.364 - 00:37:06.826, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's a really good question. Anecdotally, one of our really large investors messaged me when the market got a little unstable and said, hey, probably a good idea to brace for a bear market or crypto winter, but the ice this time won't be as thick as the last time. And so I think that sort of kind of sounds probably accurate. I think the parameters have obviously changed drastically. Right? Like, I mean, we have so much more adoption, so many more people involved. There's also all the funding cycles that are really diametrically opposed to the crisis.
00:37:06.890 - 00:37:07.066, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:07.090 - 00:37:14.946, Speaker C: Like every, we still have funding, you know, fund announcements every week of like, hey, there's another billion dollar fund launch to invest in deep tech.
00:37:15.010 - 00:37:15.138, Speaker D: Right.
00:37:15.146 - 00:37:19.474, Speaker A: There's permanent capital that is forced to deploy their $500 million fund.
00:37:19.514 - 00:37:42.846, Speaker C: Yeah. And so it's interesting. So I think we're in a really unpredictable scenario at this point. I think right now, my motto. And as a company, we really want to see how the quarter nets out and remain a little calm. It's just very hard to really, also in this macro environment, to see how crypto will be affected. And so we've been through crypto winter before.
00:37:42.846 - 00:38:15.124, Speaker C: I think everyone here has been through it. And I think the other thing is that there's a lot of crypto native companies like us, for example, who have raised sufficient capital to really come out of it, no matter how long it lasts. Right. And so I think the last crypto winter saw the end to a lot of actually really good projects. And this one probably, probably nets out a little differently. But when it comes to the ETH merge, we're super excited about it, obviously. I really think a lot about what benefit Ethereum also has.
00:38:15.124 - 00:39:00.324, Speaker C: I think it's one of those ecosystems that doesn't sometimes get the credit that it deserves as a decentralized sort of open source system. And so the merge is something technically very, very complicated. One description I've seen is, you know, it's not like, you know, when people say it's like driving the car and changing the tires, this is like flying a plane and changing the engine. And so it's a complex undertaking, but I can't see how economically it will not increase the value of ETH. It still might go down because of macroeconomic factors. But obviously, if throttling supply and offering yield over time in a system that currently doesn't have, it only allows for one outcome. But, you know, you.
00:39:00.324 - 00:39:02.472, Speaker C: But it's impossible, really.
00:39:02.528 - 00:39:30.258, Speaker E: A lot of people are feeling down right now, and I think the merge to me, is like, it's a light. It's something to be optimistic about. And when it goes through, I think it'll be a big win for the industry. And to answer your original question, too, I think there's a lot more builders coming to the space over the next year. So not only crypto has gotten hammered, but tech stocks as well. And so a lot of folks who had packages at a tech company and they were having rsus or options that really bolster their earnings, those are way down. Those are not looking as hot as they were a few months ago.
00:39:30.258 - 00:39:54.380, Speaker E: And so I think that's going to allow these pockets of people who are web3 passionate at web two companies to think, actually, maybe I should consider the switch now move into working in crypto full time. I don't have these golden handcuffs, so to speak, anymore. I'm seeing that from friends reaching out to me kind of looking at that. They're learning solidity. They're learning rust. They're thinking about how to add value into the ecosystem. So I think we're going to be going through another big building phase here.
00:39:54.492 - 00:40:06.484, Speaker A: Amazing. All right, everyone, we are up on time. I think we could do this conversation for maybe three more hours, but unfortunately, we are out of time. We have more amazing speakers, so please help me give everyone a big round of applause. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, man.
