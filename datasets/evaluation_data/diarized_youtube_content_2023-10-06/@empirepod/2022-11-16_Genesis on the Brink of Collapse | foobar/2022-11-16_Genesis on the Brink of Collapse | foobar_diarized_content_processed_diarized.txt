00:00:08.520 - 00:00:24.834, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got Santi joining us. He's drinking this, like, fancy Kombucha, hot chocolate healthy drink. Like, he's really trying to stay afloat over here. And then we're also joined by Fubar. So, Fubar and Santi. Welcome to the show, guys.
00:00:25.174 - 00:00:27.074, Speaker B: Hey. Hey, Jason. It's great to be here.
00:00:27.514 - 00:00:29.002, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:00:29.138 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Fubar. Welcome to Empire for the first time. Santi, what are you. What are you drinking over there?
00:00:34.634 - 00:00:56.434, Speaker B: It's like a collagen with, like, collagen protein, like, chocolate flavored in a Hogwarts mug. So it's been a. I don't know about you guys. I'm curious how much sleep you're getting, and what are you doing to, like, stay kind of focused in your lane?
00:00:57.934 - 00:01:15.318, Speaker A: I will admit I'm really happy that the cameras pointed, like, right here, right now. My office is messier than I think it's ever been in my entire life. You can't see my floor. My wife would be very embarrassed that I'm admitting this on the podcast. But you literally can't see my floor. There are so many clothes on the floor right now. So it's a.
00:01:15.318 - 00:01:18.524, Speaker A: I think that tells you kind of how my week is going.
00:01:18.614 - 00:01:33.004, Speaker C: Yeah, we do. We do lots of feast and famine. There are weeks where nothing happens and then hours where months happen. So I think the best you can do is just try to make for. Make up for it elsewhere.
00:01:33.384 - 00:01:34.048, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:01:34.136 - 00:01:35.072, Speaker C: Cools down.
00:01:35.248 - 00:01:48.784, Speaker A: Exactly. So, um. All right, we're obviously talking about FTX, and we're, um. All right, let me. Let me timestamp this, actually, because we're. Everything's happening so quickly right now in crypto. So it's Wednesday, November 16.
00:01:48.784 - 00:02:07.584, Speaker A: That's 215 in the afternoon, 215 Eastern. I think this episode will probably come out later on Wednesday or maybe Thursday morning. So I just wanted to timestamp that right now. I think the biggest thing that's happening is Genesis. Is Genesis. Pause, pause, withdrawals. And that's impacted a bunch of c five platforms, the biggest one being Gemini.
00:02:07.584 - 00:02:19.964, Speaker A: So I think the best place to start would be with Gemini. FUBAR. Do you. I wrote this thread that's been doing pretty well on Twitter, just kind of explaining it so I can walk through Genesis or FUBAR. I don't know if you wanted to kind of take what's happening as well.
00:02:21.304 - 00:03:09.984, Speaker C: Sure thing. I'm probably better updated on the general situation than the details of what's been going on with Genesis today, but it does seem like, obviously FTX went under. They were a premier institutional custodian for a lot of protocols, companies, other exchanges even. And so we've seen cascading effects come from that of figuring, figuring out whose balance sheet had exposure. Genesis, obviously, very large lender in the space. Seems like they, they've organized some calls today with, with top people to discuss the details of the situation. I haven't been privy to exactly what they said in those, but it does seem to be a concerning sign.
00:03:10.324 - 00:03:13.962, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, they sent me. Go ahead, Santa.
00:03:14.098 - 00:03:44.400, Speaker B: I wasn't part of the call. I didn't want to join, but I did get the invite. But there was a. I mean, I think people fairly summarized, it was like a fairly short seven minute call and saying that basically anyone that has used kind of their lending platform is impacted, although some of their operations remain unimpacted. So if you want to trade with them, sounds like that's operational. And I think that's like a. You know, I get, I guess, Jason, I don't know if you want to go through like the.
00:03:44.400 - 00:04:01.044, Speaker B: Just a quick update of all the stuff that's going on because there is a common denominator here of there are a couple of companies, a couple of programs within those companies that are impacted. But I think what we. It's best that we just cover it to the best of our ability in like the next five, six minutes.
00:04:02.064 - 00:04:04.444, Speaker A: Try to walk through Genesis then, because I think.
00:04:04.904 - 00:04:05.920, Speaker B: Background before we.
00:04:05.952 - 00:04:25.056, Speaker A: Yeah, let me lay the background for Genesis. All right, so basically. All right, so there's this guy, Barry Silbert. Barry Silbert started second market. Second market created markets like secondary markets around like, less mainstream assets, essentially in financial markets. He discovers bitcoin. They had a bunch of institutional clients at second market.
00:04:25.056 - 00:04:50.294, Speaker A: In 2013, Barry starts Genesis. Genesis was the first OTC bitcoin desk. In 2013. Two years later, DCG, Barry starts DCG. The first two companies in like, the DCG, DCG Digital currency group, big holding Group. The two first companies were Genesis, which was the big. Originally started as the big OTC desk, then turned into the lending desk.
00:04:50.294 - 00:05:14.330, Speaker A: And like a trading desk, they acquired a custodian and some more folks and then grayscale. So those were the first two companies under the DCG in the DCG portfolio. Now Gen, now DCG, they own coindesk, they own foundry, which is the largest us mining company. They own Genesis, they own Grayscale. They acquired Luno, which is a consumer app. They also have a huge vc portfolio. They've invested in over 200 crypto companies.
00:05:14.330 - 00:06:02.396, Speaker A: So they've basically built this like the standard oil of crypto, essentially Genesis. Since starting as an OTC bitcoin desk in 2013, they've evolved over the last eight, nine years. They're now crypto's largest lending desktop and one of the largest trading desks by far. So if you just look at some of the numbers from a year ago at kind of the height of the market, like if you take a snapshot, snapshot of their Q four numbers, they originated over $50 billion in loans. They had over twelve and a half billion dollars of active loans. As of the end of last year, $31 billion of spot volume traded and $21 billion of derivatives, notional volume volume traded. So just like moving absolute size, right? Then what happened was three arrows.
00:06:02.396 - 00:06:18.492, Speaker A: So Genesis was actually the biggest creditor to three arrows. They lent them $2.4 billion. Genesis then filed like a one and a half or $1.2 billion claim against three arrows. DCG. Again, the parent company of Genesis stepped in.
00:06:18.492 - 00:06:41.304, Speaker A: They assumed the $1.2 billion claim. So that left Genesis without any outstanding liabilities. So people were, you know, kind of trust. Genesis was able to regain some trust, but then things continued to unravel over the summer. So Genesis actually had some pretty large exposure to Babel finance. For those who don't know Babel, they're not as big in the states, but it's kind of like a blockfi, blockfi in Asia.
00:06:41.304 - 00:07:10.426, Speaker A: They got hit really hard and they had some pretty large exposure to Babel. Then in August, there's this guy, Michael Morrow, who was actually at second market with Barry back in the day. Barry tapped Michael Morrow in the early days of Genesis to become the CEO. So long time CEO Michael morrow, he resigned. Well, resigned, got fired. Not really sure what happened there. Everyone I know, on a personal note left, like vp of derivatives, vp of risk, like all my friends at Genesis, within like a three week span, they all left.
00:07:10.426 - 00:07:37.524, Speaker A: So that was in august. By q three, their numbers had fallen drastically. So all those numbers in the beginning of this podcast, those had all fallen like 80%. Um. All right, so now let me get into the. The important part. Like, why is the downfall of Genesis so bad? Basically, anytime you see a c five platform offering yield, so, like, gemini's earn product or like, you know, you can earn 5% on blockfi or like any of those products, most of them use Genesis to help the.
00:07:37.524 - 00:07:52.702, Speaker A: To that. Like, Genesis is the earn product. So if you are a c five platform that offers yield, you probably use Genesis. And the way that it works is you give your crypto to gemini. So let's use gemini here I have five ETH. I give my. I give my.
00:07:52.702 - 00:08:12.142, Speaker A: Let's use crypto. Let's use more generalized things. I give my crypto to gemini. Gemini gives my crypto to Genesis. Genesis gives that crypto to a fund. The fund borrows the crypto from Genesis at, like, let's say I'm going to make numbers up here, 6%. Genesis gives gemini back 5%.
00:08:12.142 - 00:08:40.198, Speaker A: So they make that extra 1%, and then gemini passes on 4%. So the yield to the user. So, voila. You now have yield in crypto. This whole system only works if the counterparties that Genesis lent to can actually repay the borrow. So if Genesis can't actually get the crypto back, they can't give the crypto back to Gemini or to the c five platform, which means Gemini can't give you back your crypto. And, Santi, it sounds like you might have been a user of Gemini.
00:08:40.198 - 00:09:14.678, Speaker A: Basically, every whale that I know in crypto gives money to Gemini, excuse me, to Genesis. Instead of giving, like, if you're kind of a consumer, you earn yield on blockfi, maybe, or Gemini, if you are maybe more of an institutional player or fund or a whale, you just give directly to Genesis to earn that yield. So a bunch of institutions, family offices, big crypto whales, they can't get their crypto back today. And that very long winded there. But that is why Genesis halting withdrawals is so bad, is because they sit at the center of crypto's capital markets. They custody funds. They help institutions earn yield.
00:09:14.678 - 00:09:22.302, Speaker A: They are the yield product for c five platforms. So, pretty long winded. That's where we're at now. Santi, how did, uh, how did I do there?
00:09:22.478 - 00:09:47.778, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really good. Um, like, I never used them, I never lent them my coins. I purely use them to trade, um, mostly like, stables. Um, so I have no exposure to them, although I'm. I think your summary is fairly correct. Um, so just. Just for context, today, obviously, what has been percolating, there were suspicions that, like, genesis was in a precarious situation.
00:09:47.778 - 00:10:28.870, Speaker B: I think all of this we have to remind ourselves and just go back to a lot of it was funds chasing the sweet anchor yield of, like, 8%. Luna collapses, and a lot of folks are caught off guard, right? And it's these dominoes that are falling through arrows goes down. Then FTX tries to step in and absorb a lot of the issue. You know, those problems with blockfi and Voyager that have been lending to three arrows. Genesis gets caught there. But, Barry, kind of like delays or, you know, you know, covers a lot of the shortfall, but really, FTX, like, blowing up was what caused the, you know, we are. We are in this position because it's just.
00:10:28.870 - 00:11:24.424, Speaker B: It's just I think most people weren't anticipating that. And so one of the very important distinctions I want to make, right, if anyone's listening now, and you've been either using, there are a couple of important points. One is, if you're a customer of Gemini, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're impacted. And let me explain why. Like, of course this all could change in real time, right? But my understanding is it's really the people that were in the earn program that is estimated to be around 300, 320 million, based on what I've heard. So, yes, big, but not like billions, and certainly not as big as other collapses. But still, it is only the users that had funds on Gemini then decided to, like, earn and be part of this earn program that are impacted.
00:11:24.424 - 00:11:52.542, Speaker B: Right. Because then they are. They. They were the ones that have taken on exposure and counterparty risk to Genesis. But my understanding is if you're just a regular depositor of Gemini, it's okay. It was down today for an hour, like the exchange, but it's back up and operational. And I haven't talked to users directly, but I think if you try to withdraw just yourself traditional funds, it should be fine.
00:11:52.542 - 00:11:53.194, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:55.174 - 00:12:10.678, Speaker A: I haven't actually tried. I have money. I have money on Gemini both in the, like, normal crypt, like, just crypto sitting there that I've made spot purchases with. And then I also have. I think I've got some, like, sushi sitting in their earn product or something like that. So I would assume the sushi. I can't.
00:12:10.726 - 00:12:30.930, Speaker B: Maybe it's important to confirm that because it's a big distinction. Right. And the same is true for, like, other, like, lending programs. Any, like, these earning programs are the ones that have been impacted because they, as you explained earlier, are the ones that. It's sort of like it was just a referral to Genesis. Right? And so what end up. What.
00:12:30.930 - 00:12:47.434, Speaker B: Whatever ends up happening with Genesis, if they are insolvent, if they get bailed out, if you recover $0.80 on the dollar, whatever that is, then it is the users of that earn program that are ultimately going to be like the creditors in that claim.
00:12:48.414 - 00:13:37.094, Speaker C: That does seem like the key distinction and the proper distinction, though FTX went under because they, well, among other things, lent every customer deposit to a random prop shop hedge fund internalized? Maybe, maybe not. But that was without customers knowing. Without customers opting in, the yield, if it had ever materialized, would have flowed to said prop shop exchange under the hood. And these, I think, more robust institutions that do properly segment customer deposits and then opt in lending. Obviously lending the money is going somewhere and you hope it comes back, but you would think that there's good segmentation there.
00:13:37.574 - 00:13:46.966, Speaker B: Yeah. And the other important thing to note here is obviously there are two other important stable coins here, Gemini dollar, Gust and USDC.
00:13:47.110 - 00:13:47.794, Speaker C: Right?
00:13:49.094 - 00:14:15.764, Speaker B: And so because circle also had this, like, earn program, that Genesis was like a counterparty, and they now have reduced the yield on that program to effectively zero. And I think I saw a statement from Jeremy earlier that their exposure to Genesis were like. Like in the one or 2%, like one or 2 million range. So very small.
00:14:16.824 - 00:14:19.684, Speaker A: No way it's that small. One or 2 million.
00:14:20.504 - 00:14:59.204, Speaker B: I kid you not. We'll link it. Anyways, the important thing is there, I mentioned this because there's now a lot of fud, right, of, hey, what's going to happen to USDC and gust? Like, are those insolvent? You know, and people are like, fighting. To the best of my knowledge, those are not impacted and are fully backed dollar one to one, fully collateralized and audited. So unless there's reason to believe that the audit is fraudulent, not correct and or, you know, somehow there's some fraud going on in these teams.
00:14:59.704 - 00:15:00.336, Speaker A: Let me just.
00:15:00.400 - 00:15:12.512, Speaker B: There's really no reason to. There's really no reason to at the moment to have concerns, ongoing concerns around, like, these two stable coins. But let me know if you disagree with that.
00:15:12.608 - 00:15:23.424, Speaker A: No, no. So I think. I don't. There's no USDC FuD in my mind. Like, there's. I love circle and USCC. And like, I think that they.
00:15:23.424 - 00:15:33.604, Speaker A: I was looking at the reserves basically. Like, there was, like, they. They have one to one reserves. I'm pretty sure, like some. Somewhere close to that. Um, here's. Here I'm.
00:15:33.604 - 00:15:46.772, Speaker A: Hold on, let me just pull up this one thing, basically. All right. I'm looking at what Jeremy said, or I'm looking at what a circle said. Circle yield is an over collateralized fixed term yield product. Genesis is a counterparty to circle. In this product. Total circle yield, customer loans outstanding are two.
00:15:46.772 - 00:16:12.272, Speaker A: Okay, this is where your number is coming from. 2.6 million as of November 16. My question about this is that there's a report from June 2020 that indicates that circle lent out about 250 million. So if Genesis only accounts for 2.5 million. Who, where's the, like, where's, where's the rest? Who's the rest attributed to? Do you see the question I'm asking? Mm hmm.
00:16:12.272 - 00:16:12.720, Speaker A: I do.
00:16:12.752 - 00:16:14.680, Speaker B: I don't have the answer to, but I do see your question.
00:16:14.832 - 00:16:15.388, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:15.496 - 00:16:22.116, Speaker C: So that's a strangely trivial amount. I mean, at circle size feels so low, right?
00:16:22.140 - 00:16:22.788, Speaker A: FUBAR.
00:16:22.916 - 00:16:31.900, Speaker C: Yeah. From 40, 40 to 60 billion, you'd think you don't want to be organizing pockets of 2.6 million here and there.
00:16:32.092 - 00:16:32.676, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:32.780 - 00:16:34.116, Speaker C: So curious.
00:16:34.260 - 00:16:52.238, Speaker A: Yeah. But I mean, I think that, I think that USDC FUD is totally fine. I think that, yeah, circle will be fine. I mean, I think this stems from they had, what? They had a relationship between DCG or. Yeah. Genesis and circle from like 2020 for the yield and the lending services. I think you're right, by the way, on Gemini earn.
00:16:52.238 - 00:16:57.094, Speaker A: While you guys were just talking, I looked this up. I think it's just that Gemini earn pause withdrawals. So.
00:16:57.174 - 00:16:57.718, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:57.846 - 00:16:59.474, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:16:59.934 - 00:17:04.158, Speaker B: I guess the other. Should we move on to like, maker and discuss a little bit about that or.
00:17:04.246 - 00:17:28.273, Speaker A: I would just. The last thing on Gemini is just that, um, on Genesis is that basically every c five platform that I know uses that offers some sort of. Earn uses Genesis on the back end. Big one, small one. Everyone uses Genesis. There's also, Anchorage has a desk that generates yield that wasn't as big but has been getting bigger and bigger. I haven't heard anything out of Anchorage.
00:17:28.313 - 00:17:31.769, Speaker B: So I'm hoping that's one to definitely monitor.
00:17:31.921 - 00:17:44.626, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely monitoring what's going on at Anchorage. I haven't heard anything. This is total. I'm just, you know, but I do know that there's a lot of c five platforms that starting in June they moved off of Genesis to offer the four to 5% and they moved into Anchorage.
00:17:44.690 - 00:18:14.484, Speaker B: So now again, an important distinction I'll make is if you're a customer of Anchorage custody and you haven't submitted or part of this earn program, theoretically, technically you shouldn't be impacted. Like if you're just a pure custody customer of Anchorage, my understanding is unless you opt in to earning some yield, then you should be fine per your terms of services. And, you know, yada yada yada.
00:18:18.144 - 00:18:22.124, Speaker A: Yeah. You're not worried about Anchorage, basically.
00:18:22.424 - 00:19:30.116, Speaker B: No, it's not that I'm not worried. It's just that it's really important here to just understand, are you just using them for pure custody services or at some point in the relationship, a lot of these custodians started offering the ability to earn some yield on your coins. And if you wanted to clip some yield, then, yes, at some point you became, you took on some counterparty risk of Genesis and or some other players that were trying to capture yield and do this. Arbitrage of off chain, on chain yield spreads that included, you know, just funds, hedge funds in the space, like through arrows that were, like, doing these strategies, a lot of them of which have blown up and insolvent now. And so that's my understanding of this whole situation. Now, there were a lot of, we'll have to monitor which projects and funds that were holding a lot of stables or coins, you know, a lot of them. The rationale was, oh, look, we're in a bear market.
00:19:30.116 - 00:20:21.880, Speaker B: We're super long x coin. We're just sitting tidy on USDC. Oh, hey, look, here's a counterparty that's offering me four or 5%. Why not do that? And I think the lesson so far has been, you know, a lot of these lenders grossly have miscalculated counterparty risk. And the question for me is, at what point does Gemini, Gemini's internal team that is acting as a referral, like a referral platform for Genesis, they're just customer from Gemini, you're referred to Genesis. Now, that customer may not really truly understand or know anything about Genesis, but look, it's in their platform. So presumably they've been vetted, right, by the risk management team.
00:20:21.880 - 00:21:13.902, Speaker B: Like, at what point? The two questions in my mind is how often and what kind of due diligence was going on at Gemini to constantly verify the solvency of their counterparties. And this is something that is just traditional, like, best practices. Right. And what were the attestations that were being done to prove the solvency? Because, look, Luna collapse a while ago, and there have been speculations of Genesis being in a precarious situation. If you're Gemini, like, I think the important question will be, hey, at what point do you stop the program? Do you protect your customers? And do you ask Genesis to, like, call back? Like, you know, I mean, like, yeah. By the way, every risk management team across crypto has failed pretty much.
00:21:14.038 - 00:21:35.554, Speaker C: You got to keep your customers alive, right? Even if you're just purely a middleman, if you're passing people along to other counterparties that will bankrupt them, then that's. I mean, obviously the bankrupting of them is terrible, but also means that your customers are becoming insolvent, and so there's less future business to be done there.
00:21:37.454 - 00:21:37.950, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:21:37.982 - 00:22:33.334, Speaker C: Yeah. How much of the this is a broader question, but how much of the focus on yield at all costs do you think is healthy, and how much do you think is extreme? Obviously, we have. Obviously, traditional finance is built on what's the risk free rate of US treasury yield? And then, I mean, ethereum has native staking yield now. But then Defi summer, I think, kicked off just this extreme obsession with hyper optimization of why are you getting 13% here when you could be getting 16% elsewhere? And this constant rebalancing that has continued the search for yield even as natural yields have compressed significantly. How much of that do you think is healthy? And how much should the industry move away from?
00:22:35.674 - 00:23:02.214, Speaker A: So, okay, so I would argue that DeFi summer didn't kick it off. I would actually argue that consumer, VC backed, consumer apps actually kicked this off. And I'll make the connection here, which is that if you look at FuBAR, I have no idea where in the world you live, but I live in New York, and Ubers used to be dollar five. You could take an Uber anywhere. Anywhere in New York for $5. Today I can take an Uber anywhere in New York. It's about $40 to $50.
00:23:02.214 - 00:23:57.624, Speaker A: So they were basically subsidizing 90% of the ride using, using VC dollars. And that works great. That's this proven VC model for building consumer apps. That works incredibly well with consumer apps, where you basically just burn a boatload of VC money to subsidize the yield, essentially to subsidize the cost of this stuff. You're seeing what we did in crypto with all these c five platforms is we copied the VC backed consumer app model, but we applied it to fintech apps. And I think that's where things got really dangerous, is because once the capital runs out, you see this violent unwinding, because you see this violent unwinding, that when things violently unwind in consumer apps, like, nothing happens, you just. The cost of my Uber just goes from five bucks to fifty bucks.
00:23:57.624 - 00:24:02.448, Speaker A: When things violently unwind in fintech and in crypto, you people lose a lot of money.
00:24:02.616 - 00:25:05.492, Speaker B: I think, like, I partially agree with that, but, like, I've said this over and over, like, I think during Defi summer, you have to ask yourself, like, if you don't understand where the yield is coming from, you're the yield. Like, and, you know, at some point, it's not sustainable to clip, you know, or like, multiples of what traditional rates are without sensing, like, not that it's not sustainable. It is, as you can clip really high coupon on a junk bond but you kind of know that that junk bond is a junk bond. The problem that I think a lot of people in crypto have been not perhaps fully aware of because maybe they were indirectly, like, not they were buying a stable coin called Terra that they think is a stable coin and ends up not being a stable coin. And partially because, you know, these platforms, to your point, Jason, were just making it very easy for them. Right. And I think that's, that's been.
00:25:05.492 - 00:25:47.230, Speaker B: I think the problem, right, where even earnings 8% after, like, Defi has been on a bear, like in a bear market. Like Defi Summer ended a year and a half ago, right? Even, even before even out. Like, we've been almost like two years in this where yields and Defi haven't been that, that compelling. Right. Defi summer is fairly like compressed, like very. But still though, you had these like weird earn programs that we're giving you six, 8%. And you're wondering, gosh, like, how are they pulling this off? And, you know, it's just like a time lesson.
00:25:47.230 - 00:26:29.986, Speaker B: I know it's. I don't want to meet sound like, you know, like I'm preaching here. Like, look, at some point, it's just like if the yields too good to be true, you just gotta ask yourself, like, how are they clipping this yield? And unfortunately, a lot of people just like, turned a blind eye to that. Like, like anchor, like anchor was giving you 8%. Yeah, well, I mean, to be fair, like, anchor was like the last sweet farm, if you will, that a lot of people were doing in size. And, you know, so many, that was partially the bigger problem. Like, a lot of these farms in Defi summer lasted a few days.
00:26:29.986 - 00:27:26.376, Speaker B: And as soon as that, like, the pool grew anything north of 5 million, 10 million, the yield was like fairly low fairly quickly. Like gone to, you know, to not very compelling or worthwhile. But anchor for a while, like, supported a lot of capital in size, and that caught pretty much every major fund in the space off guard because they were trying to clip yield. Your initial question is a good one, which is, I think the days of recursive leverage and capturing yield are long gone. We're not going to go back to that state. Liquidity is going to dry up, has already dried up fairly substantially. Any major borrower, lender in this market is tightening up, showing up drastically.
00:27:26.376 - 00:27:27.684, Speaker B: If they're still alive.
00:27:29.064 - 00:28:27.156, Speaker C: Yeah, the market makers and lenders are, if not. If not dead, hooked up to an iv at this point. I mean, it comes, I think yield comes from a good place like the original, a profitable protocol can redistribute fees to users and whatnot. And that is a good sign in its base, fundamental, original state, of what the proper winners are. But the problem is that that's gotten so distorted that it's turned from a measure of success into a measure of risk. How does the market price this? Is it a 20% or a 70% default rate? Um, so, yeah, it'll be interesting to see what, how that, how that progresses.
00:28:27.340 - 00:28:53.664, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you guys have a solution here? Because, I mean, Santa, you said this line that people in crypto love to say, including myself, which is, like, if you don't know where the yield's coming from, you are the yield. But, like, you can get. You can get 3% right now on Marcus by Goldman Sachs, or I can get, like, probably 0.01% on my bank of America account or something like that. I don't really know what they're doing with the money. Like, I don't actually know where the yield is coming from, but I'm not.
00:28:53.664 - 00:28:56.144, Speaker A: You're muted. You're muted.
00:28:57.964 - 00:29:20.240, Speaker B: You're absolutely right. Look, this is. I'm not saying that, like, there's no place for fractional reserve banking in the world. Like, look, this is how banks operate. As soon as you deposit funds, you know, you don't know what they're necessarily doing with that. Um, and if you have concerns about, you know, being a depositor in a bank, you're better off just holding treasuries. It's closer to the printing press.
00:29:20.240 - 00:29:33.964, Speaker B: Um, nonetheless, like, there is a state of the world where this continues to operate. Um, it just needs to be heavily regulated.
00:29:34.544 - 00:29:35.616, Speaker A: Yeah. It.
00:29:35.720 - 00:29:41.164, Speaker B: Unless, of course, you're like a. You're like a. Supplying liquidity to a protocol, as FUBAR, as you said.
00:29:43.114 - 00:29:49.530, Speaker C: Or at least made transparent or made funds flow on chain controlled by code, whatnot.
00:29:49.642 - 00:29:50.170, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:29:50.242 - 00:30:00.930, Speaker B: If you're. If you're a, you know, a deposit or nave, and there's a huge borrow demand for a particular asset, and you happen to have that asset, then the market's gonna price that. And.
00:30:01.042 - 00:30:01.522, Speaker A: But you're.
00:30:01.578 - 00:30:23.756, Speaker B: But you're seeing that fairly, like, in real time, and, and that's the beauty of Defi here. Um, there have been. I'm not saying, by the way, Defi is perfect, uh, because this. A lot of Defi champions and bulls. Like, it's important to, like, say, there's still a lot of risks in Defi. Smart contract risk. Cream, for instance, had an issue where they onboarded a questionable collateral type.
00:30:23.756 - 00:30:51.054, Speaker B: And that was used as exit liquidity. Like, you know, but at least. At least people are monitoring that. And the problem that I go back to here, which is my biggest concern, is what were the risk management teams at these earn programs really doing and to what extent and veracity and thoroughness were they inspecting books? And it's clear that they probably weren't.
00:30:54.354 - 00:31:11.184, Speaker C: So do you see a world where on the verifiable transparency veracity front, the two paths are, we need better inspectors or we need a way to program this better?
00:31:12.484 - 00:31:18.628, Speaker B: Yes, but that's a great. Like, who regulates the inspector?
00:31:18.676 - 00:31:19.076, Speaker A: Who.
00:31:19.180 - 00:31:23.012, Speaker B: It's like. It's like SMP and the rating agencies.
00:31:23.148 - 00:31:34.824, Speaker C: Wasn't it the. I think that the auditor for FTX, and maybe this was a meme that got blown out of proportion, but I believe their tagline was the first auditor in the metaverse.
00:31:36.324 - 00:31:37.012, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:37.148 - 00:31:40.060, Speaker C: And we don't. Yeah, yeah.
00:31:40.132 - 00:32:42.150, Speaker B: I think, like, look, at the end of the day, um, I feel much more comfortable being enforced by code with some recourse off chain. Like, I mean, I think that's the, like, yeah, code is law to some extent, but, like, also there's recourse because everything is transparent, and then you can have a claim off chain say, hey, look, something was done here or there and funds were misappropriated or whatever. But having the guarantees and the transparency of a smart contract is very powerful, and I think that becomes very powerful, especially moments like now. And maybe this is a good segue into maker, because what I'll say is that's kind of the issue. Right? Rating agencies were in the 2008 global financial crisis where, you know, anyone that's seen the movie the big short or just has any understanding what happened, they were rating some, you know, junk or crap as triple a. And it's like, who's. They have reputation, but they clearly, like, lost it, but they still exist.
00:32:42.150 - 00:32:44.674, Speaker B: It's a bit of a shit show, right?
00:32:45.374 - 00:32:49.910, Speaker A: Yeah. You want to explain the maker situation with Gemini G USD, sir?
00:32:49.942 - 00:32:51.234, Speaker B: You're the maker. Delegate.
00:32:51.694 - 00:33:16.888, Speaker A: I mean, I'll take a stab. Basically, Gemini's all right. So I think it's Tyler Winklevoss. Maybe it's Cameron. You know, one time this summer I was in New York and I saw Cameron and Tyler play. I went and saw them play at a venue, like playing guitar. It just makes me think I'm like, man, they probably should have been spending more time on the wrist parameters, not playing guitar.
00:33:16.888 - 00:33:56.010, Speaker A: But anyways, September 29, like, two months ago, Tyler posted to the maker community and basically said, hey, look, we've had this really deep relationship between Gemini and maker for a while, right? We've custodied Maker and Dai. We've traded maker and Dai. We are earned product supports Maker and dai, Nifty Gateway. People can use Dai with a credit card where consumers are able to select Dai and Maker as the reward. Basically he posted to the maker forum and just said, we want to help GUSD. Help Gus to encourage the use of Gust in the maker ecosystem. So Gemini partnered with Maker to pay them 1.25%
00:33:56.010 - 00:34:22.716, Speaker A: annualized on all the GUSD they have in the PSM. Currently it's at 473 million g USD. This kind of puts into question. So I think there's two questions here. One is, I think we're about to reach the debt threshold in the PSM, which is, I think, 500 million. And then there's also a question around the GUSD stability, right? Because. So Gemini GSD is Gemini stablecoin.
00:34:22.716 - 00:34:50.222, Speaker A: It's reportedly backed one to one by cash and cash equivalents. Gemini offers a lot of the problem of this earn product. One of the reasons people use Gemini is because they offered 8.5% on GSD. I think they've pulled that down to like five or 5.5%. So one question here is USD stable? The other is we're going to reach the debt threshold of the GUSD PSM. So I think those are the two things to talk about here.
00:34:50.222 - 00:34:52.434, Speaker A: Is that, what do you guys think about that?
00:34:57.054 - 00:35:37.774, Speaker C: Yeah, it's. I think overall you're probably closer to the situation than me being an active maker delegate. But the issue is that stablecoins don't have native yield without off. Without off chain treasury management or something like that. We have tokenized dollars, but we don't have tokenized treasuries at this point. And so a lot of these offers, there's the Gemini one. I think Coinbase proposed a big deal as well, to act as intermediaries to get a bit of yield back to the holders of these stable coins.
00:35:37.774 - 00:36:07.288, Speaker C: But there are huge just risks and opaqueness surrounding it because there are these middlemen taking rent. So how that all plays out, how it gets intermingled, say, if Gemini's or in program goes down for some other reason, do maker assets get siloed or do they get lumped in with the rest of the losses, they're tricky questions.
00:36:07.456 - 00:36:37.656, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think the maker stuff with GSE is that big of a deal. So current reserves are like 472 million g USD. There is a maximum debt ceiling of 500 million here, for those who don't know, PSM is the peg stability module. So GSD could be used alongside USDC to mint Dai. One to one maker is generally pretty prideful of its. Of the over collateralized nature. This kind of, like, backdoored the protocol, I'd say.
00:36:37.656 - 00:36:43.804, Speaker A: I think this is kind of a nothing burger. I don't know if you think it's a bigger deal than I think it is, Santi, but.
00:36:44.504 - 00:37:13.022, Speaker C: Well, Dai has a supply of 5.5 billion, so something capped. I mean, that's max 10%, let alone. I mean, this isn't. As long as you're not committing complete fraud. It's often a couple of cents to get wiped off the dollar in the worst case, not to mention maker equity. So, yeah, I don't think this is a cause for concern, but it is an interesting piece of scaling and whatnot.
00:37:13.198 - 00:37:34.746, Speaker A: I would say the bigger thing that I'm paying attention to is earlier today, excuse me, earlier in this conversation, explaining the relationship with Genesis and then DCG, another sister company, is Grayscale. Right. The largest asset manager in all of crypto does this. Right now, GBTC is trading at a 40% premium. Excuse me, discount. Does this, like. Is there any.
00:37:34.746 - 00:37:49.802, Speaker A: There's. There's some fud going on that, uh. Like, grayscale could be hurt by this or that. They might be forced to sell. Like, DCG might force sell GBTC. I don't even know if they could even do this. But, like, sell GBTC to make up, to cover some of the hole, which would drive the discount down even further.
00:37:49.802 - 00:37:52.654, Speaker A: Santiago, are you following this at all? Or FUBAR, are you following this?
00:37:57.974 - 00:38:32.046, Speaker C: Yeah. Grayscale products are the widowmaker trade of crypto. They're so tempting and tantalizing. They draw in the best and brightest and then wreck them and dump them out in the process making it even more tantalizing. So, obviously, there's a bunch of bitcoin within the Grayscale trust. Fact one for one, trading a 40% discount. There is a two, I think, 2% asset management fee annually, which is grossly high, but still far lower than 40%.
00:38:32.046 - 00:39:11.014, Speaker C: So if you think there's any. So it's an ArB play on future redemption, either ETF conversion or some winding down of the trust itself. So the trick is that people lever this up too often. That was the three ac undoing in particular, is they? Yeah. You have to find buyers on the open market or else the price goes. Goes down, you get liquidated, which further exacerbates the problem. So it certainly hasn't.
00:39:11.014 - 00:39:34.814, Speaker C: I'd say probably one of the biggest. It's a very large contributor to contagion in general, is institutional. Players at institutional come in, at institutional size come in and they make basic assumptions about the space like this ARB will close, regulators will act reasonably.
00:39:36.594 - 00:39:36.930, Speaker A: To.
00:39:36.962 - 00:40:07.590, Speaker C: Protect investors in this regulated product, and then the regulated product just pulls out the bottom. While the spot, the spot unfamiliar one does well. And that, I think causes a bad feedback loop of both burning institutional players who are trying to dip their toe into the space and do it in the moderately safe way and exacerbates liquidity problems all over. Because of the lockup.
00:40:07.782 - 00:40:24.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the two thing. More important things to reiterate there are like, it's really this levered arb discount play that has caught a lot of players off guard. Now, if you're there, can I just.
00:40:24.822 - 00:40:30.102, Speaker A: Explain that for Santa for a sec? Just for background, for folks who don't understand it really quickly, a lot of.
00:40:30.118 - 00:41:51.604, Speaker B: Folks were like borrowing FUBAR, correct me here, but the flow is like, you want to just capture that spread. So for context, there was a time where these products traded at a massive premium. No one kind of believed that they were ever trade at a discount, much less this level of a discount like this lasted for years. And there were some people that are very profitable doing it, but everything that is hugely profitable at some point gets arved out. So particularly 3 hours at some point was the largest or one of the largest holders of some of these products, including GBTC and EThe, and they were fairly late into the trade where that premium where you would like. I'm trying to explain it here, I'm probably gonna get it wrong, but you like borrow the underlying spot, I think, from someone like blockfi and FUBAR step in here and then, yeah, you use that to, to subscribe to GBTC and ETH, is that right?
00:41:51.984 - 00:41:52.320, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:52.352 - 00:42:07.856, Speaker C: The underlying mechanics, I'm forgetting their exact names or whatnot, but the specific type of trust that it is, has a six month lockup period upon new share creation.
00:42:08.000 - 00:42:08.328, Speaker A: Yes.
00:42:08.376 - 00:43:07.484, Speaker C: And then can't be withdrawn ever, really, or at least not under any reasonable conditions. So one, so one way people can, only certain types of approved share creators can deposit BTC and get back GBTC with the six month lockup. And so this initially was trading at a, what, 1020, maybe even 40% premium, because there was more institutional demand than shares available. And you'd think that the arm would close, but the six month window of delayed selling means you can't do it atomically. You have to take on six months of price raise. So if there was demand for, call it 1000 more shares of GBTC than there was, then people would go in and create 1000 shares. But then six months pass and people are demanding 10,000.
00:43:07.484 - 00:43:16.424, Speaker C: So the ARB keeps increasing. So what people would do to make this a quote unquote delta neutral strategy.
00:43:16.844 - 00:43:17.584, Speaker A: Is.
00:43:21.804 - 00:44:03.354, Speaker C: They would buy or borrow BTC, stick in the trust, and while they're waiting six months short spot bitcoin or whatnot, to hedge out the price risk and try to capture that arbitrary. But then when, when the premium goes from plus 40% to -20% you lost 60%. These were often levered plays because it was risk free money. Well, it was. It was an ArB that made money for years. So people just got confident and cocky. And then what happens is institutional demand switches, there's a surplus of these shares, nobody wants to buy them.
00:44:03.354 - 00:44:05.574, Speaker C: And so price goes deeply negative.
00:44:05.914 - 00:44:06.610, Speaker B: Right?
00:44:06.762 - 00:44:16.674, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think this is the. So we've seen, folks. So Chris Berniske came out earlier this week. He's like, I'm loading up on GBTC. Hal Press came out yesterday. He said his fund made a large BTC buy.
00:44:16.674 - 00:44:51.618, Speaker A: I think we said, quote, yes, we did buy all of the GBTC shares. I think this is the thesis, if I had to get it right, is that the FTX failure is going to push regulators toward regulation and hopefully some clarity here. Bitcoin is going to be one of the assets that gets labeled a commodity. It sounds like a lot of other things might get labeled securities. Bitcoin needs to get labeled as commodities and that GBTC will be the first to get converted into an ETF and that 40% discount will collapse and maybe go to zero because there's no liquidity, because it unlocks the liquidity. There's not that six month lockup anymore. And so you.
00:44:51.618 - 00:45:04.468, Speaker A: So that's a. So if it's a spread. Quite. Yeah. The 40% discount. If a 40% discount, if that spread closes, that's a 67% gain from doing the mental math, right. That might be wrong.
00:45:04.468 - 00:45:09.156, Speaker A: Um. So that's, so that. So that's your moneymaker? Um, yeah.
00:45:09.340 - 00:45:13.420, Speaker B: Now, importantly, I don't think they're using much leverage here. I think they're just buying.
00:45:13.612 - 00:45:16.744, Speaker A: Yes. Like, I think they're just. Yeah, exactly, yeah.
00:45:17.164 - 00:45:24.374, Speaker B: Hoping for some redemption window to open via an ETF or probably the only solution at this point.
00:45:26.994 - 00:45:29.994, Speaker A: What do you think before FTX?
00:45:30.034 - 00:45:40.894, Speaker B: Like what? I don't think if there's been any developments for last hour, but what are the options? What happens to Genesis and DCG and all the creditors?
00:45:42.234 - 00:46:06.844, Speaker A: All right, well, there's another. I would assume that. So DCG raised a $10 billion valuation about a year ago. I would assume that DCG is racing to raise capital right now. So DCG put in crap. I should know this number. They funneled, like, 140 million in equity into Genesis in an emergency stopgap last week.
00:46:06.884 - 00:46:09.020, Speaker B: Or that was last week of 175 million, I believe.
00:46:09.092 - 00:46:33.732, Speaker A: Last week. Okay, maybe 175. Well, I think it was that Genesis reported that they had exposure of 175, and DCG funneled backstopped 140 of the 175 of that. But anyways, when I saw the 140 number, I'm like, that's weirdly low, basically. Thank you. We have a great producer. Garrett is highlighting the numbers in the show notes as we talk here.
00:46:33.732 - 00:46:53.060, Speaker A: Great shout out, Garrett here. DCG is funneled 140 into that. When I saw that number, it just feels like Barry's kind of at the end of. End of his cash pile, I would say. I always thought of Barry as having, like, an infinite cash pile. It feels like if he really had all the cash, he just would have done 175. Of 175.
00:46:53.060 - 00:47:10.616, Speaker A: I have a. This is total speculation. I know nothing here. I would assume that Barry and DCG are racing to raise capital to backstop genesis. If they do that, I would assume that they raise it the $1.52 billion range. Those are my assumptions here.
00:47:10.616 - 00:47:19.304, Speaker A: There are other speculations going on. Like, what's that business worth, though? The Genesis business?
00:47:19.464 - 00:47:32.004, Speaker B: Like. Yeah, other than the claims. Right. But their book. But, like, the actual business itself, a lot of the executives have left, like. And their reputation, you know, it's like.
00:47:34.204 - 00:47:34.748, Speaker A: Would you.
00:47:34.796 - 00:48:04.354, Speaker B: I guess the. If you're Barry, the options are continue to fund raise at the hold company, DCG, and then stopgap and save Genesis. Maybe there's a liquidity mismatch. Maybe there's some of the collateral that is stuck in FTX three arrows bankruptcy proceedings that might, you know, take ten years plus and get some sort of probabilistically 65 between five and $0.70 on the dollar. Good luck. Um, you save it.
00:48:04.394 - 00:48:12.322, Speaker C: You try to raise even Coinbase debt is trading at $0.50 on the dollar. So would expect an even higher discount.
00:48:12.458 - 00:48:13.334, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:48:13.634 - 00:48:20.134, Speaker C: Less. Less public, more long tail lending stuff.
00:48:20.474 - 00:48:36.004, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. And so you. You either save it or you let it go. You sell this to someone. I don't know who would want to buy it. Hoping to them, like, be really aggressive in trying to recover some of the funds.
00:48:37.384 - 00:49:01.108, Speaker A: Wait, so I just want to make sure I understand. I want to understand Fubar's point one more time. So, wait, so Coinbase has publicly traded debt at like 50% below par that anyone in the world can buy right now. So you're saying the Genesis loan book has to be at least like a 75% haircut or more here? Is that. Am I understanding that correctly?
00:49:01.276 - 00:49:26.644, Speaker C: Yeah. Coinbase bonds are, think, 50% below par, 15% APR or so. So I'd expect them to be the. Not. Not the risk free rate, but the benchmark rate for publicly traded or public. Large enough to be public crypto, infra market making lending companies.
00:49:27.184 - 00:49:36.764, Speaker A: Yeah, I would assume what's also going on right now is there's a lot of bidders who are doing what. What happened in the FTX situation, which is there's a lot of bidders who want to take a look at a loan book, but they don't actually want to.
00:49:37.504 - 00:49:41.760, Speaker C: Yep. Exactly. Get the letter of interest.
00:49:41.952 - 00:49:43.764, Speaker A: Yeah. So.
00:49:44.064 - 00:49:51.584, Speaker B: Or you let it go, you try to sell the book. What's the other thing that I just want to touch on is what happens to Gemini here.
00:49:52.484 - 00:50:04.984, Speaker A: Well, just one last point. On the. On the genesis side of things. I would expect that we see something that looks like a binance. When finance came in, was like, we're going to acquire FTX. They look at the books and then they pull out. I would expect we see something similar.
00:50:04.984 - 00:50:13.380, Speaker A: You know, people said finance, finance for this genesis thing. I don't see. I don't think we see binance here because of the US regulations. I don't think they have any interest.
00:50:13.452 - 00:50:15.744, Speaker C: I think Czech has enough.
00:50:16.084 - 00:50:18.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. Yeah, exactly.
00:50:19.484 - 00:50:25.076, Speaker B: Maybe you see like a. Some vulture, like Apollo try to.
00:50:25.260 - 00:50:26.260, Speaker A: Someone like Apollo.
00:50:26.292 - 00:50:27.020, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:50:27.172 - 00:50:42.884, Speaker B: Like one cents on the $0.01 on the dollar or $0.05 on the dollar. Have bring in like, a really aggressive, like, bankruptcy restructuring lawyer, and then, like, recover $0.20 again. They not. They don't need to underwrite a full recovery here.
00:50:42.884 - 00:50:59.670, Speaker B: All you need to do is there's. Again, all of this comes down to on what price do you get the book? And there is a clearing price. It's not zero. Maybe it's one, maybe it's ten, maybe it's 50. But if you have. There's a price for this book, is what I'm saying.
00:50:59.862 - 00:51:03.594, Speaker A: Hmm. I'm not getting near this book.
00:51:06.054 - 00:51:09.218, Speaker B: To be. To be fair. I don't know enough about it.
00:51:09.406 - 00:51:10.346, Speaker A: Is that.
00:51:10.530 - 00:51:15.934, Speaker C: Is that info gonna come out public, you think, or stay under wraps.
00:51:16.314 - 00:51:41.610, Speaker A: Fubar. You think anything stays private in crypto? Uh, no, I would assume that. I think it's actually beneficial for those kind of things to go public because it brings trust back. It brings confidence back to the market. Yeah, that's what I would assume. So, um, there are a lot of companies out there who are saying we didn't, there's a lot of companies, a lot of funds, who are saying we did not have exposure to FTX, we didn't have exposure to alameda. We did not have exposure.
00:51:41.610 - 00:51:48.658, Speaker A: Three arrows. Luna, celsius, block five. Genesis or Gemini. And I am sitting here 24 hours.
00:51:48.706 - 00:51:52.254, Speaker C: Later, they declare bankruptcy, putting my tinfoil hat without fail.
00:51:52.914 - 00:52:08.014, Speaker A: It is impossible for all of you to be telling the truth. Like, what are you guys looking at next for where the, what happens next? Where do we go from here? Or what companies? Or what types of companies?
00:52:08.594 - 00:52:11.498, Speaker B: Like, what happens next in the next 6 hours or a day?
00:52:11.546 - 00:52:17.162, Speaker A: Because next, like 2 hours next. I think we're talking on. We're talking hours at this point.
00:52:17.258 - 00:52:23.974, Speaker B: Yeah, we're, we're operating on a short timeline here. Um, I don't know. Foor, you want to go first?
00:52:25.034 - 00:52:28.814, Speaker C: People, people get mad when you speculate that they're bankrupt.
00:52:30.074 - 00:52:30.386, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:30.410 - 00:52:55.184, Speaker C: They don't react kindly to that. Um, I use, I use lots of proxies for operational management, quality, and trust that are sometimes correlative and sometimes not. But I don't know. They have any specific name to drop as the next shoe to fall.
00:52:55.604 - 00:52:59.064, Speaker A: Fubar. That's why we bring you on, man. You are, you're. You're the.
00:53:02.004 - 00:53:14.420, Speaker C: Rumors that, that a thing Ethereum is insolvent. Who are these validators getting paid out with new tokens printed every block? What's going on here?
00:53:14.572 - 00:53:18.384, Speaker A: Yeah, that is signal. That is signal right there.
00:53:21.724 - 00:53:55.084, Speaker B: I've said enough names here to. I think it's fair to assume that we should. The point that Adam makes is a good one, not just in these moments, but just always. It's not to say that you should never have any counterparty risk. Sometimes it's difficult, right, to have zero counterparty risk, but if you have counterparty risk, it's just, it's a time to reassess that, and it's a time to be extra careful. And I'll tell you what I did. I minimized and have zero counterparty risk at this point.
00:53:55.084 - 00:54:25.114, Speaker B: And everything is either fully withdrawn back to fiat or some stablecoin and the stable coin that I feel most comfortable. This is not an endorsement. But I feel most comfortable is one that is backed one to one. And the one that I feel comfortable with is USDC. Again, not an endorsement. And again, I am monitoring the situation in real time. And anytime Jeremy tweets, you sure know that I have an alert on that.
00:54:25.114 - 00:54:33.062, Speaker B: But at this moment in time, I don't have a growing concern on the redeemability of USDC. One. One.
00:54:33.198 - 00:54:42.274, Speaker A: Yeah. But if there's anything this week has taught us, it's what I said to you the other day, Santi, it's like you just got to move quickly when there's smoke, right?
00:54:42.774 - 00:54:45.994, Speaker B: I mean, I didn't move fast enough. I didn't move fast enough that Sunday.
00:54:46.414 - 00:55:09.222, Speaker A: I sat down, it's Wednesday today. I sat down on Monday and was going to pull some money off of Gemini and was like, yeah, I'll get to it on. I'll get to it, like, this weekend, I'll get to it later. It's just like, I've made these mistakes so many times. We had a similar thing with Tara and Luna happen where we had a chunk of change, or I bit some money and just like, we'll watch it play out. Should have taken like $0.80 on the dollar.
00:55:09.222 - 00:55:10.934, Speaker A: So. Yeah, yeah.
00:55:10.974 - 00:55:16.774, Speaker B: So I think, you know, I don't want to speculate. I think there's a lot of fud going on right now.
00:55:16.934 - 00:55:17.398, Speaker A: It.
00:55:17.486 - 00:56:18.232, Speaker B: Look, don't outright dismiss the FuD, but also don't act impulsively. But at the same time, if acting impulsively is going to ensure your survivability and you have too much funds with one counterparty, it's probably best to segregate and contain risk that no single wallet or counterparty or asset can destabilize you. You know what I mean? It's like the Horcrux model. We always bring on Harry Potter and spread it out. You can easily create wallets, you can easily self custody, you know, if you don't have to use an exchange and you have some probability that it could go under or just pause withdrawals, and that's gonna make your life complicated and difficult. Take it off, go off chain, you know, go cold storage. And if you're really not reading the service agreements of an urn program and you don't understand where even 5% is coming from, 2% is coming from.
00:56:18.232 - 00:56:23.244, Speaker B: Now is not the time to get cute. Go clip 5% on treasuries, goddammit.
00:56:24.384 - 00:56:27.688, Speaker C: We're definitely in a guilty until proven innocent regime.
00:56:27.776 - 00:56:28.444, Speaker B: Yes.
00:56:30.144 - 00:56:58.274, Speaker C: The evidence you need is not. You don't need overwhelmingly, beyond the reasonable doubt evidence. You need enough to doubt. That's. That's good enough. And even that said, there are. I see certain areas where people risk ten, like risk 100% for a 10% upside while ignoring the cases where your downside is 10%, the upsides, 100.
00:56:58.274 - 00:57:34.016, Speaker C: So regardless of whether things come to fruition or not, I'd say for most. For most people, they panic. They panic on false positives more often than not. But then you're prepared for the actual scenarios where it is necessary. You do need to act quickly. If you're somebody who's only ever used a centralized exchange and doesn't know what metamask is, if you're. It's good to go download that, practice with it, see what uniswap is, custody of seed phrase and whatnot, and then you're ready.
00:57:34.016 - 00:57:49.836, Speaker C: You can do that in a semi calm manner. Take your time, learn some stuff. Tinker with small amount, tinker with small amounts of money. And then when it really matters that you have to act impulsively in the moment. You're ready. You're prepared.
00:57:50.020 - 00:57:56.676, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. There's a reason why companies do fire drills on a regular cadence, I think.
00:57:56.700 - 00:58:26.412, Speaker C: I posted a. Posted a tweet about Netflix's chaos monkey tool yesterday. They have an internal software service that'll go in and randomly kill off machines, kill off back end servers, to see if the website can stay up to test the healing mechanisms and make sure that they're running. They have this constant. I'd call it a learning process. It's the engineers learning what infra is reliable and what's not. And the crypto industry should have that as well.
00:58:26.412 - 00:58:32.266, Speaker C: But for centralized exchanges and for users, what is it like to get yourself to a safe place?
00:58:32.410 - 00:59:24.534, Speaker B: Yeah. One last point. I think we can maybe transition to, as we talk about FOD, the disappointment of media, as we've seen some of these puff pieces. But before we get there, I just want to reiterate one point that is not lost on me, which is, if you have doubts about a particular solvency, of a particular exchange, then a lot of them, you can assume, are going to be tested sooner rather than later. And if they have proof of reserves and they're doing things correctly, they should be able to process those withdrawals fairly in a. In an orderly manner without having to cause major delays. And so this is going to be a stress test for every single major, every single kind of exchange or service provider or app out there.
00:59:24.534 - 01:00:23.116, Speaker B: And frankly, that's a really good thing. And so I think when you talk about why things can go wrong if there's a bank run, typically you get in a very tricky position when you're running a very levered book of fractional reserves and you can't call back those, you know, those loans that you've extended the counterparty, the borrower might be solvent, might be sound, but there's two things that can happen that have happened here. One, the borrower might be go insolvent, as we've seen. Right. And then you can't call back that loan to process of withdrawal or it's stuck in a place. And so it's just a mismatch of assets and liabilities. But that doesn't necessarily mean that that money will never be recovered.
01:00:23.116 - 01:01:10.126, Speaker B: It's just going to take a little bit of more time. We've seen instances of both, right? One where the counterparty, like the borrower blew up, and so you can't recover those funds. They're either stuck in FTX or, you know, you're going to recover some cents on the dollar. And so you take a haircut on that and then you can't process the withdrawal of your. The exchange or, you know, or it's just going to take a little bit of time. And so I think these next couple of weeks will understand exactly this difference between purely just a mismatch, which is the best case, or some other, which is a worse situation, which is not just a mismatch, but your counterparty blew up, and there's. It's a bad, bad debt.
01:01:10.126 - 01:01:12.350, Speaker B: Right. You have to take a haircut on that.
01:01:12.502 - 01:01:24.702, Speaker A: Yeah. It's a good distinction. Good call. I have an interview in 18 minutes. Blockworks is still hiring, actually, for anyone who's looking for a role. So we have a bunch of. Bunch of open roles open.
01:01:24.702 - 01:01:38.504, Speaker A: So I have 18 minutes here. Do you guys want to talk about New York Times? Total puff piece. You want to talk about why SPF is tweeting, like, random letters. You want to talk about Solana or you want to just wrap this. This fubar? It's on you.
01:01:40.804 - 01:02:22.936, Speaker C: I think on the. Yeah, on the media coverage. Every day I wake up and stuff is worse than I thought it would be. So. Had low expectations coming in, but it does seem like they're trying to paint an extremely cozy picture of someone you. If you go back and look at the articles about Coinbase's CEO, Kraken CEO, which are both, it seems much more honest, transparent, useful exchanges than FTX was. It's just biting and critical.
01:02:22.936 - 01:03:22.410, Speaker C: So it's fascinating to see that this is the point where the general media policy of saying only bad things about tech takes a turn is with the genuine fraudster. But I also suppose that it's useful for people to learn which sources are reliable and which ones aren't. Jail man. Amnesia comes for us all where you read about something in your area of expertise, see how it's completely wrong, then flip the page, read about something you know nothing about, and take all the words to face value. So I think yet another data point in people learning which sources are reliable, which aren't. Hopefully it isn't used as too crude of a weapon against the good actors space.
01:03:22.602 - 01:03:40.418, Speaker A: Let me. I agree with you. Fubar. Let me turn that into a positive statement, though, which is, I think that this has been the last, like ten days, the last couple of weeks have actually just been a really bright light for crypto media. Right. Big shout out to Ian Allison at Coindesk. Like, his, his story kicked all of this off the on chain.
01:03:40.418 - 01:04:22.484, Speaker A: Analysts have done an amazing job, like using tools like Etherscan and Nansen to just basically pretty much uncovering crime trails using the blockchain. I think Twitter, like citizen journals, have worked like Fubar. I'm not sure if you've slept in the last two weeks, have just worked their absolute ass off to aggregate information and just keep people up to date on everything. I would say reporters. I'm seeing how hard blockworks reporters are working right now. There's all this, there's a lot of Twitter, citizen journalism that's amazing. But sometimes there's not really sure what's rumor or what's truth like, I've seen how hard the blockworks reporters have, have worked to figure out, to not only cover everything, but to figure out what is truth and what is just rumor.
01:04:22.484 - 01:04:42.834, Speaker A: I think I'll give a shout out to podcasts. I think we're doing a pretty good job, folks at bankless, Laura Shin unchained on the margin. Mike Show, Ford guidance. Jack Farley. The podcasts are giving really, really, really thoughtful analysis. I would just say it's been a bright light in my mind. Everyone who's been working really hard to bring truth to crypto is, has been doing a great job.
01:04:44.454 - 01:05:05.126, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a, it's a great framing. Um, really is kind of the turning of the tide in terms of who has. Everybody has access to investigate on chain stuff, and you really get to see who knows what they're talking about. And in real time, days or weeks faster than you'd get through traditional sourcing yeah.
01:05:05.230 - 01:05:09.232, Speaker A: So, santia, anything else to touch on? No.
01:05:09.288 - 01:05:43.064, Speaker B: I mean, I think you guys are right on point there. You know, a lot of times we talk about more oversight of crypto markets. I think I absolutely agree with that. Oversight of black box traditional service providers that operate as normal traditional financial institutions. Absolutely. There should be the same level of rigor and oversight to understand really what exactly they're doing under the hood. But oversight of on chain stuff is there for anyone to inspect in real time.
01:05:43.064 - 01:06:34.660, Speaker B: And you can call it out if you have a wallet that is tagged to binance, and binance is moving around a couple billion dollars, you can immediately tweet to CZ and if there's enough noise, I think right now every single major kind of player out there is monitoring Twitter and, and responding to that Q and A in real time. Otherwise runs the risk of, you know, losing customers or trust very quickly. So it's just an important distinction to make. I'm fairly optimistic that this message is resonating with not just, not just like, to be fair, like I have Bloomberg on all the time, it's kind of therapeutic to just listen to the nonsense. It's like a soothing voice. I kind of grew up in a trading floor, but a lot of the guests that have come on and a lot of the questions because historically, like, the traditional media has asked, like, leading questions. Right.
01:06:34.660 - 01:07:14.444, Speaker B: That, like, frame it in like, a really bad light, rhetorical questions. But a lot of the, a lot of the discussion has been, I think, fairly constructive and has gotten it some, like, fairly right around. This goes to the JP Morgan report. And I think that there is some good journalism being made and reporting. And I think people are starting to understand that a lot of what happened at FTX was in large part because of a lack of this regulatory loophole, arbitrage that pushed them offshore. And they weren't very regulated. And a lot of times there should have been emphasis there to protect consumers.
01:07:14.444 - 01:07:28.914, Speaker B: And a lot of the stuff on DeFi has been working well. And there are problems with DeFi, but transparency, non custodial solutions have been operating fairly well.
01:07:29.074 - 01:07:43.914, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really nicely said. All right, housekeeping, as we wrap this up, I appreciate everyone listening. I know everyone's super busy, so I appreciate you guys listening. One, if you enjoyed this show, Santi and I are working our ass off. FUBAR. Appreciate you joining us. So just please hit that subscribe.
01:07:43.914 - 01:07:45.242, Speaker A: I know you got to do, you.
01:07:45.258 - 01:07:49.058, Speaker B: Got to do the, like, down, click down.
01:07:49.106 - 01:08:26.910, Speaker A: Yeah, no, but actually, please, please subscribe, because it actually goes it really goes a long way if you're listening on like Apple or Spotify and give us a review. Santi cringes every single time I say this, but it really does help the show. The more people who review, the higher we go. And like when you open your Spotify app, so it really does go a long way. The other thing is that I know the layoffs in crypto haven't been as public this time around, but I've been noticing that there's been some layoffs. There's also layoffs in media protocol, which was a politico spin out just shut down yesterday. I just want to call out that we're hiring for a bunch of roles like vp of sales, vp of marketing, salespeople, front end devs, full stack devs, research analysts, branded content writers, video editors.
01:08:26.910 - 01:08:41.414, Speaker A: So if you're listening to this and you have just been impacted by something or you just want to come work at crypto, just feel free to dm me on Twitter and yeah, I think that's it. Stay safoo, folks. Yeah, survive, survive.
