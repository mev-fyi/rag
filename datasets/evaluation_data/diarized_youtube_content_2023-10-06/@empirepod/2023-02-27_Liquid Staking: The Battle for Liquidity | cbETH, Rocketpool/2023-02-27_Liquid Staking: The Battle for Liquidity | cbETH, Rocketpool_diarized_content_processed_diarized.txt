00:00:00.320 - 00:00:10.194, Speaker A: Staking is here. It's ready for prime time. It is a two way door of getting in and out, and we want to grow that overall participation of staking on it.
00:00:12.014 - 00:00:34.340, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today we are talking about lsds. This is not a psychedelics episode. Today we are talking about liquid staking derivatives. Basically, as Ethereum moves from proof of work to proof of stake, you are able to stake your Ethereum. The downside of that is that that ETH is now locked up. It is a kind of dead asset.
00:00:34.340 - 00:01:09.098, Speaker B: So what has been created are these things called liquid staking derivatives, which allows you to have liquidity on that staked ETH. So a couple of the major players in this space are coinbase with their Cveth product, Rocket Pool Lido, which we'll be talking about. And this episode kind of is going to focus on two different things, like liquid staking, and then just the staking market in general. And we're really lucky to be joined by Darren, who is the GM of Rocket Pool's core team. And then John, who is the product lead. One of the product leads at Coinbase. He helped lead the launch of CVE and now leads all staking at Coinbase.
00:01:09.098 - 00:01:12.882, Speaker B: So, Darren, John, welcome. Welcome to Empire. Guys.
00:01:12.978 - 00:01:14.506, Speaker C: Thank you very much for having me.
00:01:14.690 - 00:01:15.842, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:01:15.978 - 00:01:16.338, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:16.386 - 00:01:19.494, Speaker B: Excited about this, John, is this. Is this podcast number one for you?
00:01:20.834 - 00:01:31.116, Speaker A: I think of any podcast worth note, uh, which I'd put you in that camp, but, uh, I'm a little bit more under the radar on some of these things, so good way to start.
00:01:31.140 - 00:01:35.984, Speaker B: The show, but butter me up. Say that. Say the podcast is noteworthy. I like your strategies.
00:01:37.164 - 00:01:39.504, Speaker A: I'm just hoping for the softballs, baby.
00:01:39.804 - 00:01:41.384, Speaker C: I'm making notes.
00:01:43.644 - 00:02:05.264, Speaker B: Um, cool. Well, maybe, John, because. Because you buttered me up so kindly, I'll. I'll throw this first one to you, which is, uh, staking. LSD is really just a hot button topic. Obviously, because of everything that happened with Kraken and settlement, you guys have your own product CBE. I'd love to just get, like a lay of the land.
00:02:05.264 - 00:02:20.174, Speaker B: Like, give me the. You know, we're coming up on Shanghai. We've got a couple big players, you guys. Rax is making some movements, obviously light. Oh, is kind of the dominant player right now. Like, give me the lay of the land of what's going on in. And LSD is in staking world the right now.
00:02:20.754 - 00:03:04.474, Speaker A: Absolutely. So the way I frame it is that staking in general has been live for. I don't know, approximately two years or so. And we've seen over that time period already some pretty monumental shifts in market share. I think one of the very first considerations to have when examining the landscape is native staking versus liquid staking, and also kind of where it is, home staking or DIY fit in. And generally what we've seen is, over time, that home staking contingent, I think, rests around like 25 ish percent, is kind of where we are today. And these are do it yourself, stand up your own node validator in your home, and run a couple of these validators on your own hardware.
00:03:04.474 - 00:03:51.524, Speaker A: And then we've seen that a lot of the centralized exchanges have built staking as a service programs, and that was the next wave where you had Kraken, ourselves at Coinbase, binance, of course, and then a number of others. Bitcoin, Swiss, statefish, steak, us, Celsius, even. There are a lot of decentralized providers who then began offering staking. I think then the most recent inflection in the market was when Lido began to really gain steam. They launched their Ste token. It immediately started to get some traction, especially as they went through the different defi integrations. So that utility built up for Ste.
00:03:51.524 - 00:04:21.946, Speaker A: And then what we saw when we look at this, the market share over time is the inflection of Lido's dominance really happened after their Aave integration. And that's what kicked off a lot of additional usage of lsds in DeFi for many different strategies and approaches. But that was when we really saw Lido rocket to the top as the number one provider of staking through the format of Steven.
00:04:21.970 - 00:04:31.322, Speaker B: Darren, how do you do? What are we missing here in terms of lay the land end of February? What's going on in the staking and LSD space from someone who lives in.
00:04:31.338 - 00:05:38.064, Speaker C: It 24/7 yeah, so Lido definitely kind of took the lead in terms of it, did it very, very well in the sense that they created a lot of liquidity, which then kind of gave them that utility for St. Again, as John said, the aave thing was very, very good for them. A lot of other kind of players came into the market a little bit later. So obviously, we came in around kind of November of 21 onto mainnet and started building up some steam, and then John could talk about CBE as well. And then there's a lot of other kind of players, like stakewise and a few other people as well, who are kind of developing these protocols and gaining, I guess, mind share at the very least, if not kind of market share as well. And so that's definitely been an ongoing process. Obviously, with the merge.
00:05:38.064 - 00:06:07.874, Speaker C: The merge was a big, big thing for staking protocols. So I think our kind of TVL chart is ridiculous. It's kind of like it's a steady, steady growth until, until the merge and then suddenly just goes bam. Where, you know, the merge was a massive de risking event for the whole of Ethereum and, but particularly for Ethereum staking. So that is the thing that was kind of like a big, a big moment.
00:06:08.414 - 00:06:41.734, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm looking at the market share numbers right now, which are this, I mean, this is according to Defi Llama 73, Lido has 73% of the mark market share, Cbeth has 15% to 16% of the market share. Rocket pool has 6% of the market share, and Frax has like one to 1.5% of the market share. Why does someone, maybe, Darren, ill throw this one to you first. Why does someone choose to stake with one of those versus someone else when Im going to stake? What is the product decision that Im making there?
00:06:42.594 - 00:07:23.994, Speaker C: I think theres a few different things. The first one is the style of token. There are different styles of token that does play into it a little bit in the sense that there are non rebasing tokens and rebasing tokens. Rebasing tokens have this daily increase of quantity that you get, and non rebasing tokens actually increase by value over time. And there's some kind of advantages and disadvantages of each approach, namely tax efficiency and that sort of thing. Non rebasing tokens tend to be more tax efficient. So that's one element of it.
00:07:23.994 - 00:08:10.352, Speaker C: Probably the most driving factor is utility. As John said, the RB integration is key because it allows people to do kind of hyper staking, which is kind of essentially leveraged staking. So utilities is the biggest thing. And so different tokens have different maturities in the market. And you have to have a maturity in the market and you have to have a certain amount of liquidity to kind of get these integrations. And in fact, it's kind of like a Maslow's hierarchy of integrations. You have liquidity on the bottom, then eventually you get into lending markets.
00:08:10.352 - 00:08:50.474, Speaker C: Once you get into lending markets, then that then enables you to get into EU aggregators and a lot of other protocols as well. There's this stepped approach, and you have to work through each of those and go up that pyramid to be able to do it. Tokens that have been in the market for longer will have more utility. So that's the thing. And then obviously, some of it's like the decentralization spectrum as well. Different validator sets. Each liquid staking protocol has a different validator set.
00:08:50.474 - 00:09:03.362, Speaker C: And that definitely comes into play when you look at that. And then the last thing is brand, obviously. I think. I don't know whether it's in that order or not, but it's around that sort of way.
00:09:03.538 - 00:09:04.370, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:04.562 - 00:10:07.876, Speaker A: To tag onto that. I think a lot of those points that Darren made are great points, and particularly like a big plus one to his points around utility and the hierarchy of needs, or the step like the order of operations you need to follow in order to build that utility. We've experienced the same with CBE, and we've bumped through those processes, so very, very much agree. I would also add that if we take ourselves one layer up and maybe zoom out, even to a bigger extent, I think the market shares that you provided there, Jason, are all around liquid staking derivatives, or liquid staking tokens, as we like to call them here at Coinbase, more than anything else. And if you actually look at the overall market share landscape, the differences aren't quite as wide. Do you have, from my view, lido has about 29% of market share, Coinbase 15, Kraken 7.5, finance about six, rocket pool around 2.5
00:10:07.876 - 00:10:16.446, Speaker A: ish percent. When you look on those total bases, I would almost also say that when customer is thinking about, what's that from?
00:10:16.510 - 00:10:24.634, Speaker B: Like, why are my numbers so different than your numbers? What's the, what's the metric? What's the right metric that I should be looking at? Because I think I'm looking at the wrong stuff then.
00:10:25.014 - 00:10:34.638, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you. What the, the market share you might have given is on just the LSD's, whereas I look at the total underlying stake, these across both native and liquid state.
00:10:34.766 - 00:10:38.142, Speaker B: So that doesn't include like Kraken staking arm or whatever.
00:10:38.318 - 00:10:38.670, Speaker A: That's.
00:10:38.702 - 00:10:39.182, Speaker C: I see.
00:10:39.278 - 00:10:40.374, Speaker B: Okay. That's right.
00:10:40.494 - 00:10:42.438, Speaker A: And binance is too, right? I mean, they.
00:10:42.526 - 00:10:45.142, Speaker B: Where do you find that data? Where can I pull that up?
00:10:45.318 - 00:10:51.702, Speaker A: I live on the hill Dobby dashboard on Dune. I can send you. Is there a link? I can add a chat?
00:10:51.758 - 00:10:53.154, Speaker B: I can find it. That's fine.
00:10:54.374 - 00:11:44.390, Speaker A: Yes, that's one of the ones that we've used. And then looking at the total stake overall, the network, and then comparing each of these providers against that number. So, yeah, to get back to the point is that if you look first on that outer lens, you do have a chance to sit back and say, okay, well, if we put ourselves in the perspective of the customers and in the customer shoes. There really is a spectrum of sophistication and knowledge when it comes to staking. You got very warmy Nova stakers who might be in a centralized exchange product already seeing hey, there's this opportunity to earn apys on these assets that I'm buying and holding. That sounds like a great use of my proceeds during a bear market while Im just holding and accumulating. Then you probably go up the sophistication spectrum.
00:11:44.390 - 00:13:33.860, Speaker A: Youre going to land at the advanced traders up to the web3 hedge funds and VC funds who are actively using these tokens. If we use this framing of the customers, you might also see that how those customers are choosing they're a different staking provider does also based on what level of knowledge they're coming in at the more me and novice users are probably most comfortable with a solution that might or might not have an LSD associated with it, to just be able to get in, earn that interest or those rewards and then continue to just sit and hold. But as those users are more sophisticated, those who are kind of like accustomed to using self custody wallets, interacting on chain, or up to those crypto hedge funds that are trying to maximize returns, that's where I think LSD has become increasingly important for that top segment of the market. And those user groups are, number one, looking to maximize their total proceeds and profit, which does involve some of those strategies that Darren mentioned in using this different DeFi protocols. But another huge one, especially when you're at that institution level, is your security and trust in the safety of the underlying state. That's another, I think, big component here, which is it's not just utility in how much you could use the token and how much profit you can earn from it, but how comfortable do you feel with the security of the underlying storage model? And some of these mileage may vary between, between different providers. And I think one of the reasons why there is a lot of faith in Lido is because there's a little bit of that Lindy effect that it's been around, it has been tested, and there's confidence in the underlying security model.
00:13:34.052 - 00:13:54.348, Speaker B: Darren, can I just. Okay, so I have like a very. I have like a five year old's take on staking, which I see like a spectrum of staking platforms. And I'm like centralized staking platforms, Coinbase, Kraken, finance, folks like that. I'm like, okay, those are the centralized folks. Then I'm like, all right. Then there's like the middle bucket.
00:13:54.348 - 00:14:21.254, Speaker B: And I've got like, my lidos of the world in the middle bucket. And then I'm like, all right, then there's the, like, very pro decentralization rocket pools of the world. So that's my, like, five year old's brain view of staking, I guess. Darren, like, one, is that a fair view or not a fair view? And then two, like, why do you think it's obviously you're spending your time at rocket pool helping to money further this decentralized staking mission. Why is that a cause worth fighting?
00:14:22.114 - 00:15:15.960, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment of the market, particularly around the validator set. Obviously from centralized, having one provider or control over the validator set to kind of us where we have over 2000 individual node operators. So I guess we've spent kind of a long time building our protocol. Rocketball has been around for six years. So ever since staking was even mentioned as a thing on Ethereum, we've been around. So we have spent a long time building a protocol. And so the reason why we do that is because, so ethereum aims.
00:15:15.960 - 00:15:59.108, Speaker C: So Ethereum's health kind of depends on it being decentralized. And when I say decentralized, decentralization is a characteristic, but it's not necessarily the outcome. The outcome you get from decentralization is credible neutrality. Um, it's censorship, resistance, um, it's, uh, resiliency. Um, it's all of those kind of things, um, that we want from an l one blockchain. Um, and so it, it is really important that we, um, we, we decentralize the validator set as much as possible. Um, and so, yeah, so that's, that's why we kind of, that's like why we approach it in that way and why we spend quite a lot of time doing it that way.
00:15:59.108 - 00:16:44.524, Speaker C: And it is actually a very hard problem. There are new kind of protocols coming through at the moment, and we're perfectly comfortable with competition. I think it's good that there is competition in the marketplace, particularly for running validators. As we've seen with Lido, one entity or one pool, having a lot of control over the, over the validator set is not a good thing for Ethereum. So we need competitors in the marketplace at the same time, building a decentralized protocol is very, very difficult. So, yeah, we kind of managed to do that over the last six years.
00:16:45.144 - 00:17:11.304, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you guys are, I guess, on my five year old's view of staking, like on two ends of the spectrum. So maybe competing with each other there. But you're also both on the same team going after the 800 pound gorilla in the space which is Lido. What do you think is like? Why is it bad if Lido gains too much of the market share? What are the negative ramifications of that?
00:17:12.524 - 00:17:54.858, Speaker A: I can at least chime in to say that there's a lot of push that we saw amongst in the Ethereum community as Lido approached the 33% 1st consensus threshold of proof of stake consensus in Ethereum, I think there would be the ultimate top limit. There is that 66.7% upper threshold, at which point if there was full control over the validators, then a single provider would be able to distort and pervert the state of the network. Now, very importantly, what a lot of us talk about in the Ethereum community is that there is still this all important social layer that stands on top.
00:17:54.906 - 00:17:56.098, Speaker C: Of the protocol layer.
00:17:56.226 - 00:19:25.760, Speaker A: I think if we ever got to a position where the protocol itself had been captured by a 70% holder of market share, that social layer would probably overrule and then work towards rectifying the situation, either through some kind of specialized slashing a hard fork, other sort of tools that are at the discretion of the community. Hopefully we never have to approach that and the community works towards a more decentralized future. Let me just take this opportunity to remind folks that sure, Darren and team might have Reth Coinbase is a big proponent of CBEth, but ultimately, even if we are competing on these art flavors of the same thing, we should take an ethereum first approach here. And we are, I think at first and foremost ethereums in this regard. We need to think of the whole state of the network as extremely important and central to our mission here at Coinbase. One of our missions is to increase economic freedom in the world, and we can only do that if we have a truly neutral, uncensorable, permissionless base layer of thats number one that needs to come first and foremost amongst all of our decisions and actions. And I think if you take that lens, we can also take a pro ethereum stance, which is to say, when you look at all ethereum staked versus total supply were only at about 14%.
00:19:25.760 - 00:19:58.364, Speaker A: So theres a ton of opportunity to grow the pie rather than trying to fight for market share within the pie. I think that posturing ourselves in the community in advance of the Shanghai upgrade and move to the enablement of withdrawals, that's like the next big catalyst that we can use to inform everyone out there, all ETH holders that staking is here. It's ready for prime time. It is a two way door of getting in and out. And we want to grow that overall participation of staking on the network.
00:19:59.844 - 00:20:19.532, Speaker B: One, can you guys explain this deal that happened last month, which was like, I think of you guys as competitors here. But then in last month, Coinbase joined Rocket Pools Odao and Coinbase Ventures announced an investment in rocket pool. So maybe this is a question for Darren here. Can you explain that?
00:20:19.708 - 00:21:05.104, Speaker C: Yeah, so I should say, I should caveat it with, they've been proposed to the Odell. They still need to be accepted. But yes, so this is important because so Coinbase, as John said, everyone is, they're kind of an ethereum first company. They want to invest in decentralized technology. And so Coinbase Ventures is the BC arm of. Of Coinbase and it's actually them who we're kind of dealing with. And so they've actually done like an RPL investment.
00:21:05.104 - 00:21:55.654, Speaker C: So it's essentially kind of buying RPL and investing in that. But what they intend to do, they intend to kind of run some mini pools to kind of increase the capacity of are, in terms of the network itself, it's not going to be a significant percentage of that, but they are kind of going to be running minipools so that they are kind of investing in and want to be a part of decentralized protocols. Coinbase ventures are like one member out of. I think we have 16 members on the Odao at the moment. And so what it really does is it kind of means that we are together on that kind of endeavor. There you go.
00:21:56.394 - 00:23:19.040, Speaker A: I think the only two cent I could add to that is Coinbases mission, as I mentioned before, is to increase economic freedom in the world. And that is an attitude we take across our product portfolio to focus on how do we grow that mission and grow the ecosystem at large. First, because we realize how small the whole ecosystem is relative to its future end state. And we view this kind of on the same paradigm of the Internet and this Internet of value that we're building. And so we take this view that it is very early. And if you look at kind of our product portfolio at Coinbase, from the consumer app that the flagship app that everyone knows and hopefully loves, to the web3 wallet, which is now a feature within that app, allow people to have this semi self custodied approach that's based on MPC technology that allows you to actually sign transactions and perform web3 actions within the app, all the way to Coinbase wallet, which is our truly web3 product. You see a product portfolio here that matches this intention of wanting us to focus on growing the entire ecosystem, not just being a first party centralized institution, but focusing on something that we'd call internally our product 3.0
00:23:19.040 - 00:23:41.774, Speaker A: manifesto, which is put in place by Brian and Surajit, our past chief product officer, to focus on being a web3 first company. And I think this collaboration between Rocket pool and Coinbase reflects that attitude. We are not a self focused, centralized institution. We want to focus on growing the entire ecosystem.
00:23:42.434 - 00:24:41.074, Speaker C: Yeah, one of the ways I also look at it is so Coinbase is one of those kind of so crypto in general, rocket pool, Ethereum, all of it is on this adoption curve. And as we go along the abduction curve, we're still really in the early adopters phase. We are breaking into the early majority. But to get the early majority and the rest of the majority, you need people like Coinbase as those gateways. That's why it's important, because it means that DeFi protocols can actually have the positive impact that we're aiming to have, because we can extend our reach to those people. So that's kind of how we see it as well.
00:24:42.094 - 00:25:02.194, Speaker B: All right, let's talk Shanghai. So can one of you guys maybe set us up for this conversation and just explain, give maybe the 101 on Shanghai when it's happening, what's happening? Maybe. John, I'll pick on you for this one and then would like to get your guys view in terms of like, what's the second order impact and what's actually going to happen here.
00:25:02.934 - 00:26:04.412, Speaker A: Sure. The TLDR is that as the Ethereum community, we have over the last couple of years been working towards a transition from proof of work to proof of stake consensus as a mechanism to increase the overall security of the network and bring down energy consumption. The huge milestone that we hit last year was the merge. The merge was the on chain deviation towards proof of stake consensus. And we have been working in that paradigm flawlessly, seamlessly. It's been really impressive actually to watch that transition happened and to the whole chain to continue to move forward. Now, a sort of fast follow, so to speak, from that upgrade was the ability to do ETH withdrawals, or the opportunity to exit your validator and get your principal of your 32 ETH increments back if you so choose, because otherwise it's been locked up.
00:26:04.412 - 00:27:08.124, Speaker A: Now, LSD's liquid staking tokens have been a kind of remedial solution for that lockup period, but ultimately your underlying ETH right now is locked on chain until we get to the next hard fork upgrade of Ethereum, which we have dubbed Shanghai, also heard Schapella because there's like the sepoyla and capella, there's like, you know, the execution layer, the consensus layer. But whether you hear Chappelle or you hear Shanghai, both of those are the referring to the upgrade that should happen seemingly on target by around mid to end of March, at which point on chain you'll be able to submit unstating requests to the protocol. You will be in an exit queue that is governed by the protocol of how much they allow unstaking to happen. Then, as we look through that protocol, users will be starting to receive their unstaked vanilla ETH. And we now have, in my mind, completed the full scope of what was needed for the transition to proof of stake.
00:27:08.424 - 00:27:12.534, Speaker B: Darren, you want to walk us through the impact of this just on the staking market?
00:27:12.874 - 00:27:22.374, Speaker C: Yeah. So, first of all, it's, it's very, very exciting. Yeah. It's, it's the culmination, really, of proof of stake. Without, without this, we don't really have proof of stake.
00:27:23.954 - 00:27:53.372, Speaker B: It is actually a remarkable feat of, like, open source code. And I really think that, like, you know, people see these like EIP something something, and they're like, oh, that's great. There's like this other thing, like crypto y thing that I don't really get. I really think this, like, even people outside of crypto should be applauding, like any technology should be applauding at like, this massive feat of technology that has been pushed through over a many, many, many year roadmap, which is, I think it's really cool.
00:27:53.428 - 00:29:04.204, Speaker C: I don't know, the research effort, the development effort, I mean, there are lots of teams working on this and they all kind of interoperate and that sort of thing. So it's, it is a massive exercise, but, yeah, so withdrawals are really exciting. As John said, it's very, very close, and we've kind of finishing off the testing of that now. How it kind of affects the effects of the market is that, I mean, to be honest, what it really does is it very macro, it kind of further de risks. Ethereum staking, that's the biggest thing, the biggest takeaway, the merge de risk, the execution risk of actually moving to proof of stake. And now withdrawals actually de risks it from a staker's perspective. So there's a lot of people waiting on the sidelines that aren't necessarily crazy enough to, to lock their money away for a non determinate amount of time.
00:29:04.204 - 00:29:43.122, Speaker C: And so I'm surprised how much there is staked, to be honest. So now that that is implemented, it means that you can become a validator. You can run it for a few months or years. It's mostly years out, and then you can unstake when you like. As John said, there is this exeq. So we don't know how that's going to behave in terms of how many validators, how long it'll take you to exit and that sort of thing. But essentially you can stake and unstake, and that's a big deal.
00:29:43.122 - 00:30:41.216, Speaker C: And so there's a lot of people on the sidelines that either did not want to do that because of the lockup or could not for particular kind of regulatory reasons or something, or compliance reasons and that sort of thing. So that's, that's a, that's going to be a big deal in terms of the actual protocols themselves. I mean, I can tell from our perspective, it, it does actually make us, it doesn't actually make that much of a difference for a liquid staking perspective. People can unstake from rocket pool whenever they like anyway, as long as we've got liquid liquidity. So, you know, it, what it really does is it increases that liquidity, increases the liquidity to unstake. It also potentially increases the APR slightly because a lot more of those rewards are being compounded. And so, yeah, so they're, they're kind of like the two, the two things from a liquid staking perspective, or.
00:30:41.216 - 00:30:45.524, Speaker C: Sorry, three things, they're de risking slightly more yield. And.
00:30:46.524 - 00:32:30.222, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd also add on the de risking side, I think one metric for measurement is looking at the training discount of any given LSD versus the ETH that it represents. So whether in the e token model, basic model, or the c token model, generally these assets trade at some proportion to the fair value, representing the redemption value of how many ETH units you would get underneath that token. Historically, what we've seen, if you go back to periods of high volatility, I think, of the terra luna collapse around there, you saw these trading discounts wide pretty dramatically because people just, I think in general, were in a risk off mode and were kind of scared about the total possibility of collapse around all sorts of different groups systems. Now, since the merge, you saw those trading discounts go much tighter. Like you would see Ste trade kind of under negative 1% on its trading discount. And that kind of also represents that de risking that happened with the merge and what I would expect to happen is after Shanghai and after the point where the exit Q has come down a bit, we should see trading discounts go converge towards zero or near zero over the long term. And it represents the fact that the arbitrage loop of going between LSD to vanilla stake deep to vanilla stake deep to stake deep, that whole circle is now bi directional because if it trades at a small discount, you can shorten long in one direction, or if it trades at a slight premium, just as in today, you could art that out pretty quickly.
00:32:30.222 - 00:32:37.364, Speaker A: So that's what we would also expect is that these LSD's will trade closer in line because of the de risking to the fair value.
00:32:38.184 - 00:33:30.356, Speaker C: So just to add a little bit more to that as well. So Areth, which is our second token, has actually been trading at a premium like one point something percent. And that's mainly due to the fact that there's such a huge demand for re and we're a decentralized protocol, which means that we need node operators to spin up validators. And on that side of things, they've been kind of spinning up validators, but not quite meeting the demand on the r eight side. And so there's actually like an ARB opportunity and there, in terms of spinning up a rocket pool, mini pool, you can actually earn an extra 1.3% because you are being by creating a validator. And what we're going to see is the opposite as well.
00:33:30.356 - 00:33:55.464, Speaker C: So as John said, if we're trading, if the liquid staking token is trading at discount, then there's an arb going the other way, which means so we can see validators using that as an arbitration, as an arb mechanism to steady the price of the liquid staking token.
00:33:55.624 - 00:34:29.750, Speaker B: Hey everyone, quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're on to app change. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:34:29.750 - 00:34:47.238, Speaker B: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just built the platform. I can search for an l one. I can search for a protocol, pull up the platform of blockworksresearch.com dot I search the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform.
00:34:47.238 - 00:35:18.985, Speaker B: It's 2500 bucks a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. And you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their twitter handles today, links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform.

00:35:18.985 - 00:35:53.516, Speaker B: Ten got you back. Check out the links in the, in the description to find out more. Now let's get back to the show. Yeah, I'm not sure if you guys have seen the, the middle of the bell curve meme about basically what will, what will happen, uh, uh, around, around the unlock, right? So like the middle of the bell curve take. Well, I, I would say the middle of the bell curve take is like, uh, like, oh, like when shanghai unlocks, like millions of ETH will get sold onto the market. I'm not buying ETH yet. I'm going to wait until after that happens, then I'm going to rotate it to eat.
00:35:53.516 - 00:36:07.464, Speaker B: I would, I would call that the middle of the bell curve take. Um, the right side and the left side of the bell curve take is probably like pretty bullish on the unlock, so. But I'm curious if you guys would agree with me in, in that sense.
00:36:08.644 - 00:36:49.008, Speaker A: I think I agree with you. Um, I, I had definitely more in the camp that I think. Well, speaking of curves, I guess my view is generally a j curve of what's going to happen after Shanghai. Whereas you're going to see in the near term all the first one to eight months or so, there's going to be net unstaking and maybe net selling of ETH as people feel. For example, users just got unlocked, about 6% of their validator was accumulated rewards. So that now is a tax impact, at least to some extent. You're going to see some people unstaking, maybe even just the rewards in order to sell on the market.
00:36:49.008 - 00:37:14.724, Speaker A: So I would expect that to happen in the short term. But just to all the things we mentioned, that j curve starts to inflect once the exit queue works itself out and you now get to a more steady state where people are saying ah, this whole thing is de risked more. It is a more stable system that has this two way door of staking of an unstaking. And I do expect growth like net staking growth to happen from that point on.
00:37:15.384 - 00:37:31.016, Speaker B: It's a good. I think. Yeah, I think that's a really good take, John. Yeah, I think that's a good take. Like net, like I guess that, that bell curve meme, whatever, it depends on your time horizon, right. So like short term. Yeah, probably a bunch of sell pressure, long term very bullish because people see that it actually works.
00:37:31.120 - 00:38:08.056, Speaker C: So yeah, I think that there's definitely. So the partial withdrawals thing is actually an interesting mechanism. So anything above 32 ETH, once Shanghai is delivered, anything above 32 ETH will be withdrawable. Well actually there's some other things going on there, but just to simplify it. So anything above 32 ETH will come back. So that's actually an important mechanism because people won't necessarily have to exit their validator to like pay tax, for example. And we are in the bear market as well.
00:38:08.056 - 00:38:51.374, Speaker C: So that makes a little bit of a difference. But so if that partial withdrawal comes back, as John said, there might be this initial I'm selling for tax, but ultimately I'm kind of seeing people use that and wanting to compound their rewards. And so what I'm actually expecting is that a lot of that will get restaked either via spinning up more validators or by using a liquid staking token. So I suspect there's going to be a lot of that as well. But yeah, there may well be a little bit of short term when self attack.
00:38:51.874 - 00:39:33.422, Speaker A: And Jason, I would say that I think that the bigger phenomenon is going to be market share reshuffling than it is going to be like net unstaking or net staking. I think we'll see more changes in market share. And this is definitely a hot topic that I'm talking about with my teams. But I think just general principles that are guiding my thoughts here are that number one, LSDs are going to be just as important in a post Shanghai world as they are now. Maybe just as is a fluffy term, but very important. Still very important. And the reason why is because there's always going to be an exit queue when you want to unstake, there's at least the or there's always going to be a queue.
00:39:33.422 - 00:40:35.234, Speaker A: There's always going to be the exit period, which is a minimum wait time of like two to 32nd epoch, somewhere like 27 hours. I think that you're going to need to wait whatever you want stake. So some people who have immediate liquidity demands are always going to prefer to have an LSD where they can get in and out of staking immediately at their discretion. Second reason why lsds are going to be still extremely important post Shanghai is because it unlocks a lot of capital efficiency. You can now use your LSD either for on chain activities like in borrow lend protocols in order to get an additive rewards rate there for depositing it and lending it. Or another approach is that you can even deposit these at centralized institutions and prime brokers for that collateral requirement. So if you are taking leverage as a crypto hedge fund, for example, you would probably prefer a collateral asset that's actually paying you money and earning you interest as you go.
00:40:35.234 - 00:40:54.454, Speaker A: I do expect that even post Shanghai, it certainly makes native staking a lot more attractive because you're now no longer in the sports lockup. But I still think that over the long term, we will see LSD is reigned supreme as the premier choice for staking.
00:40:55.234 - 00:41:15.046, Speaker B: All right, so I have a couple maybe more quantitative questions on the back of that. Darren, I'll throw this to you. And then, John, I'm going to ask you a similar question today. I fixed my market share numbers. By the way, John, I got the hill dabi Dune dashboard up. We're good to go. So today Lido has, according to his dashboard, 29% market share.
00:41:15.046 - 00:41:22.994, Speaker B: What is Lido's market share? If we're doing this podcast, let's call it same time next year?
00:41:24.374 - 00:42:05.742, Speaker C: It's very difficult to tell. I would expect it to be lower, though. There's a few reasons for that. As I said, that unlock is now possible. There are a lot of people who are, particularly from a risk perspective, are looking at diversifying across different liquid staking protocols. And I mean, there's different versions of risk, but obviously there's this kind of smart contract list, or there's the risk that Lido plays, which is having too much stake and that sort of thing. So there's definitely a lot of that kind of management of risk.
00:42:05.742 - 00:42:51.460, Speaker C: So there will be a reshuffling because of that. There will be a reshuffling because prefer different brands or that sort of thing, or different aprs. So there's definitely that. So I would imagine that their percentage will be lower. One thing, which is a rocketball specific thing, is that we've got a big atlas release which will actually minimum three xr capacity as well. One of the things that has been slowing us down is the fact that we are a decentralized protocol and we have to scale in a particular way with our atlas release. That situation improves quite a lot.
00:42:51.460 - 00:42:59.312, Speaker C: So obviously that's a very biased thing. But we expect to have more market share post Shanghai as well.
00:42:59.428 - 00:43:02.768, Speaker B: So we think light. Oh, his market share is going down and rocket pools is going up.
00:43:02.896 - 00:43:04.164, Speaker C: You fight that.
00:43:06.744 - 00:43:08.480, Speaker B: I didn't think you're going to say that.
00:43:08.672 - 00:43:11.244, Speaker C: I'm not going to. I'm not saying that. You're saying that.
00:43:13.984 - 00:43:37.524, Speaker B: I guess. John, maybe let me try to make this more of a. And if I ask you the same question, I think I'll get a similar answer. Lido is going down and CB, their coinbase is going up. What is obviously you think that, what is something that could get in the way of that, or what's something that either you guys could fail at or that Lido could do well at that would maybe invalidate that idea.
00:43:38.904 - 00:44:48.146, Speaker A: Well, here is one thing that's been top of mind to me, which is that when I look at the LSD market, one analogy that I like, I spent a lot of time, too much time, researching all sorts of different industries and understanding the history of those industries. But one of the, I think the markers here, that's a pretty good analogy, is the ETF market. And the way I think about this is that LSDs generally are representing a staked ETH position at whatever provider you are trusting. Of course, the security of that underlying need is incredibly important in choosing that supplier. Then when it becomes deciding between one supplier versus another, you can then lean on that ETF analogy to say that when you look at the ETF markets, there is often a winner takes most ETF or strategy. The reason why is my background. My first job out of school was on Wall street, then I was at a hedge fund for a while.
00:44:48.146 - 00:45:34.798, Speaker A: And the reason why is because when you are investing large sums of capital, you are pretty tied to how much liquidity exists and how much trading volume happens in a given strategy, which, or in a given security or just product. Because I don't view Ellis liquid staking tokens as securities, but if you just view in any product, the overall demand is generally this flywheel, and a bit of a network effect between having more trading volume so that theres more liquidity for a big institution to get in and out. That then drives aum into the ETF, which then allows more natural buyers and sellers, which then turns that flywheel liquidity.
00:45:34.886 - 00:45:35.916, Speaker B: Get liquidity.
00:45:36.030 - 00:46:18.004, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And so if we think of it in that model, I think that would be the risk factor. Right? To your question of like what could get in the way of Lido continuing to grow and ste growing as a bigger percentage of total, it is probably that. That is probably my concern of something that could derail it. And what I hope to happen is that we see the community in that social layer continue to push on upper thresholds for how much market share we want a single staking provider to have, so that ultimately we drive long term network security as our top priority is ethereum.
00:46:18.664 - 00:46:54.414, Speaker B: Okay, so then let me ask an incentive based question about post Shanghai world. So if you look at Reth, which is rocket pool, so Reth swap volume on balancer increased pretty dramatically after turning on incentives back in September. I think right now the most liquid market for Cveth is on Coinbase, but the CBeth pool also does have this curve gauge, right? Like AK, like crv emissions can flow there. Do you see Coinbase voting on curve to drive incentives and on chain liquidity in a post Shanghai world?
00:46:56.574 - 00:48:35.414, Speaker A: I would say that, look, I'll start by saying we haven't made any specific decisions there and wouldn't be willing to speak to what we plan to do in those regards. But I would say that we ultimately realize that there is a lot of advantage to driving on chain liquidity, as well as off chain liquidity in centralized orders. One of the reasons is, to a point that Darren made earlier, which I really liked, which is Maslow's hierarchy of needs when driving utility, is that in order to get into all the premier sexy new defi applications, you generally need to be integrated into the borrow lend protocols. And for the borrow lend protocols to adopt you, they need to be able for their liquidators to have enough liquidity to liquidate any bad debt so they don't end up with bad debt on their balance. That means that ultimately, Dex liquidity is the base layer of importance for on chain utility. And you can generally think of that metric, the success metric for how well integrated you are in on chain liquidity is by your slippage percents at x dollar intervals of how much of a cell size you would need measured by some aggregator, like the one inch router. So if you put it in that framework and you say okay, well, like we need to drive on chain liquidity and liquidity providers in order to make sure that that slippage is low on large trade sizes, then Coinbase, and I would assume rocket pool as well, would be angling to do anything we really can to try and drive enough of that liquidity provision on chain.
00:48:35.414 - 00:48:42.562, Speaker A: How we go about doing that, I think that's up for discussion. There's a lot of different approaches, but it does speak to a critical need there.
00:48:42.738 - 00:48:43.494, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:43.874 - 00:48:49.654, Speaker B: Darren, what do you think? I mean, like, will you guys have to continue some of these incentives after Shanghai?
00:48:51.834 - 00:49:19.744, Speaker C: Yes, I think we'll need to continue. We're going to assess it as we go. We have a management committee within the DAO that kind of after our incentive program. We're definitely looking at it. So we were quite reluctant to get into liquidity incentives as a long. Yeah, it did work. Yeah, it did work.
00:49:19.744 - 00:49:56.054, Speaker C: I think in the long term, I think Bill will try to kind of dial it back, but I can't see us at the moment. I mean, the main thing that we needed to do was get enough. So there is like, as I said, there's a point at which you need to get to. You need to get to that point to be able to get into lending markets because of those liquidations. You need to get a certain amount of liquidity out there so that there's enough volume so that you can have oracles. So, you know, there's this. You need to have that bootstrap to be able to get there.
00:49:56.054 - 00:50:07.680, Speaker C: Now, I suspect we will carry that on, but we assess that on a monthly basis anyway.
00:50:07.832 - 00:50:21.404, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you see the fee market evolving? CBE, I might botch some of these numbers, but roughly 25% was pretty high fees, I'd say rocket pool nodes, I think, can choose their own rate between five to, let's call it 20%.
00:50:22.624 - 00:50:54.124, Speaker C: Actually, it's a little bit more complicated. So now it's a bit. Now it's 15%, it's a fixed 15%. But what are each holders actually get? The average across their whole network. And we did have a floating commission rate kind of at the beginning. So some node operators are like 20%, some 5% and everyone in between. But from now on it's 15%.
00:50:54.124 - 00:50:58.424, Speaker C: Post atlas, actually, it's going to be 14%. So we're actually lowering it.
00:50:59.204 - 00:52:15.284, Speaker A: So. Yeah, well, what I would add there is that 25% is our baseline fee for ETH, staking ed for Cbeth. And what is available to us are feed rebates. And that is something that we've written into our user agreement and is clear. And so larger investors, institutions, other large, large and advanced traders and investors who would like to discuss those fee rebates with us are absolutely welcome to reach out to us through our prime broker, through our sales team and so forth, to discuss kind of volume based fee rebates. And I think over time, what I would expect is it will be a competitive market, but that there is some underlying floor which is an institution or large investors comfort with the underlying security model of the state. Dean and I think that is one thing where us at Coinbase, we take a lot of pride in being the most trusted provider in the market, among centralized exchanges all the way to, for all of our products, most trusted and easiest to use become top priorities for us.
00:52:15.284 - 00:52:27.484, Speaker A: And so building the really simple user experiences for retail and also keeping the assets incredibly secure underlying it are what we kind of always will use to baseline the value that we're providing to customers.
00:52:27.604 - 00:52:50.250, Speaker B: Yeah, John, you mentioned this word like ethereums a couple times. Like, I think everyone on this call is like very like pro EVM, pro ETH World. Even Coinbase as a company, I would say is like a very like ETH heavy company. Lido announced that they're going cross chain. So I think they're launching on Cosmos, maybe Neutron. I think it was. I got to revisit that.
00:52:50.250 - 00:52:58.654, Speaker B: But I'm curious to get both your guys takes on going to other chains, staking on other chains. What's the strategy there?
00:53:00.274 - 00:54:13.746, Speaker A: Sure, I can start by saying, yep, Lido has for a while had different state like stuff tokens for different chains. They have their St Sol, I believe, and they did have ones on terra and Luna, rest in peace up there. And I think they'll probably be adding more protocols as well. At Coinbase, we have staking programs for more than just ETH, and we are looking over time to add more staking programs and any ones that we feel like we can dutifully add for our customers in a safe and secure way, we will be adding those over time. And to maybe more specifically answer your question around the potential for lsds for other networks, I think that is also a possibility, something that we are exploring and considering. It definitely comes down to, I think, a function of how valuable is that instant liquidity for that other native blockchain token. With ETH, of course, that was the no brainer because it was all locked up until Shanghai.
00:54:13.746 - 00:55:33.028, Speaker A: So it was a no brainer to focus here on the ETH side. But when looking at other tokens, you do need to account what is the unstaking illiquidity period look like on that chain? What is the total defi adoption look like on that chain? To speak to that utility argument of how much use can you get on that chain? And I think third, there's also a little bit of a lens where you need to take a longer term view on the success and adoption of that protocol. If you take that view on like, if you think if you're working with a network where you see developers in exodus not actually building not a lot of new innovations, I'd say that probably leads less confidence in wanting to really invest in that protocol. But just to be very clear, while I maybe individually love Ethereum, and I was kind of born and bred on Ethereum is kind of the very first place I really sunk in, I do take a multi chain view of the future. I think there are a lot of other chains out there that are valid working on unique and different architectures. And I think there's probably in that design space, different protocol architectures, different consensus mechanisms, probably other chains that will be best suited for certain applications over the long term. So Im by no means a single minded person on this.
00:55:33.028 - 00:55:40.908, Speaker A: Ive got an open mind and do think that theres a lot of other protocols that do have merit and theres probably opportunity to build staging analysts there.
00:55:41.076 - 00:55:44.744, Speaker B: I was very PR friendly. PR friendly.
00:55:46.004 - 00:55:48.492, Speaker A: Well, the PR people who are listening are going to then thank me.
00:55:48.548 - 00:55:52.304, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're going to be happy with you there. Darren, what do you think about this?
00:55:53.004 - 00:56:39.154, Speaker C: Yeah, our approach is a bit different in the sense that so in the future we're not going to say no, we won't go to any other chains. Obviously, we'll kind of adapt as the, as the future unfolds. But for us, we have kind of a philosophy of do one thing and do it really, really well. We in Ethereum, Ethereum is the biggest market kind of by far. So it's worth spending our time in that market and getting it right. And so we've got enough work working on rocket pool in Ethereum to last us decades. So no decades.
00:56:39.154 - 00:56:57.046, Speaker C: So we, we want to do it really, really well. We want to focus and be the best that we can. So that's kind of where we've taken, as I said, as the future unfolds, it may change, but at this very moment we're focused just on.
00:56:57.230 - 00:57:23.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to talk like some future of the market stuff as we think about wrapping this up. Future of the market for staking at large. One question that I had here is will lsds subsume staking or whats the relationship between staking and lsds and specifically the size of the LSD market relative to staking? Maybe John, if you want to take that one first.
00:57:23.994 - 00:58:48.120, Speaker A: Sure. I think over the very long term, I would expect if you break out liquid staking or lsds in the ethics that underlies it, versus native staking, of which a subset are those DIY home stakers. My hunch is that over the long term, lsds will subsume and take the majority share of total stake ETH on the network. And my reason for believing that does come down to a couple of the points we mentioned before of, number one being the utility factor of it, being able to use it both as depository collateral that earns you interest, or to be able to lend it out, borrow lend protocols, earn additive interest, basically just be able to use that capital rather than just having it locked up in your own value. I think the other piece of that is the fact that users will demand liquidity. And even in a world very far away from Shanghai, once we have ETH withdrawals, there's still that 27 hours wait time and any exit queue that still exists on exiting Ethereum staking. So that involves some lockup and some illiquidity that I think some users, especially the larger, bigger institutional investors, are going to prefer band liquid solution.
00:58:48.120 - 00:58:58.164, Speaker A: So I think for probably those two major reasons, I think over the long term, lsds will be the preferred method for staking on Ethereum.
00:58:59.184 - 00:59:36.242, Speaker C: So I agree, but I would temper it slightly. So there's a couple of things. So I agree that liquid staking will probably be the, will be the majority versus native staking. But I also. So at rocket pool, obviously, we are trying to lower that barrier of entry for native staking as well. So not just for liquid staking, liquid staking, you don't need to run a node at all. But on the running a node side, we're trying to make it easier and easier and lowering that collateral level so more and more people can do it.
00:59:36.242 - 01:00:33.130, Speaker C: So we get more and more home stakers. And on that side of things, obviously on the liquid staking side, as John said, you've got this liquidity, you've got this utility, and you don't have to run a node. So it's super convenient. But on the node operator side you earn more. The yield is particularly, particularly rockable where you get a commission on the ETH, you're staking on behalf of the pool, you earn more from that. I do see institutions and home stakers alike looking at that and going, I want to do that, even though it's slightly harder, although we're kind of, as I said, lowering that barrier of entry from the technical perspective and from a collateral perspective, so that more and more people can actually do that. And to be honest, that's a good situation.
01:00:33.130 - 01:00:51.344, Speaker C: It means that we are further decentralizing Ethereum. You get more and more people actually, although I say that I think liquid staking certainly will be the bulk. We are trying to grow that native staking pie as well.
01:00:52.004 - 01:01:23.760, Speaker A: It's worth just tag along that to say the risk of the future that I painted is centralization. And I think I applaud all the efforts from Rocketpool and even Lido with their v two where they talk about the smart router and what kind of permissionless entrance into the staking pool as very important actions to decentralize in every possible access. That is key to preventing that risk factor of centralization of a single LSD.
01:01:23.792 - 01:01:34.084, Speaker B: Provider, if centralization is the risk. John, aren't you guys driving centralization of staking by being a centralized exchange?
01:01:36.464 - 01:02:44.624, Speaker A: Look, I think there's a fair argument to that. We are a centralized institution, and one of the reasons that we are it kind of comes down to the coinbase principle of being the easiest to use. We want to be most trusted, we want to be easiest to use. And part and parcel for that is allowing especially those newbies to Ethereum and to crypto in general to have an extremely easy way to stake and participate. Ultimately, providing a centralized solution is the easiest approach for onboarding new users to crypto and to Ethereum at large. And I think there are trade offs in any approach that you take. But one of the benefits of being a centralized institution and having a more centralized version of LSD is that we can provide a super simple experience to a user who maybe has heard about crypto, maybe was told about it by a friend or read some articles, and needs a more simple and familiar experience for onboarding for their first stop.
01:02:44.964 - 01:03:04.214, Speaker B: Can you talk about the regulatory side of things? I forget if I was. There's one question I wasn't supposed to ask you guys, but I forget it. And I feel like this might have been it. Our producer told me. So I don't know if either of you guys can talk about this, but Kraken obviously just settled with the SEC. It was like $30 million. Seems like folks are coming down pretty hard on staking right now.
01:03:04.214 - 01:03:12.894, Speaker B: Can either of you guys talk about this? Skip, what are your thoughts on regulation right now? How you weigh the risks and the rewards?
01:03:16.274 - 01:03:22.850, Speaker A: Let me jump in to answer your question the best I can and the way I can.
01:03:23.002 - 01:03:25.054, Speaker B: I feel like she's going to get mad at me here.
01:03:27.494 - 01:04:09.702, Speaker A: Well, hopefully she'll view me as coach dwell here. And here's the answer that I give, which is that we are different than what Kraken was doing. And I think great resources. Here are what Brian has said on Twitter, what Paul Grewal, our chief legal officer, has said on Twitter and in the blog post. And some of the key points to mention here are that we have, first and foremost, as Coinbase, always disclosed to our staking customers of what happens with the assets. And we've always mentioned this in the user agreement, we at all times maintain a one to one relationship between any assets that you give us and what we have title over. So we hold your assets one to one.
01:04:09.702 - 01:04:54.024, Speaker A: That is a key principle. And then lastly, and very importantly, when a user tells us that they want a stake, we go and we put that stake on chain. We actually do what the user has told us to do. And so these are some key components that make our staking program different and very what I would consider by the book, to more closely and more closely replicate what the native on chain experience feels like. All in a process to ensure and to make very clear that we do not believe that each staking is a security, and we do not believe that the way that we are providing staking to those customers is a security item.
01:04:56.204 - 01:04:58.784, Speaker B: Darren, are you allowed to give a last kosher answer?
01:05:00.564 - 01:05:40.422, Speaker C: I'm not going to comment on the actual regulations, but I'll reiterate some of the stuff that John was saying. The staking that we provide is transactional. It is a transaction between a liquid staker and a node operator. The node operator is providing a service to the liquid staker. Every dollar, every ETH that goes into the system is being staked. We don't do any management of those funds. It is all just being staked from the protocol.
01:05:40.422 - 01:05:51.394, Speaker C: So, yeah, like, all we can really say is the nature of our business and kind of let that unfold.
01:05:51.514 - 01:06:05.674, Speaker B: I actually think one of the worst things for the regulatory side of staking was two things, was one, calling it interest, and two, calling it a frickin derivative. I'm like, why? Why did we use the word derivative here?
01:06:05.754 - 01:06:09.524, Speaker C: Like you, I was very reluctant.
01:06:11.384 - 01:06:14.512, Speaker B: All a derivative. Come on, come on. Let's, let's.
01:06:14.528 - 01:06:20.696, Speaker A: Yeah, we like the term liquid staking tokens because we've searched liquid staking tokens.
01:06:20.720 - 01:06:40.954, Speaker B: And I noticed use rewards instead of interest. So there's a. But that's smart. Like, I actually don't think the sec really understands what I think if they really understood what staking is, it's a totally fine thing to do. It's just like securing a network. Right? It's there. It's like such a great act to do.
01:06:41.494 - 01:07:20.800, Speaker C: The other thing, particularly with DeFi protocols, is that everything is transparent. Like you can. Every dollar, every ETH that we stake, every, everything is on chain. And in fact, we have a whole ecosystem of community projects that, that use that transparency and show people, you know, where the money is and what's, what's, what's happening with it. So, and to kind of hold us to account that we are actually staking everything and that sort of thing. So, yeah, so it's a very, it's a very different. It's a very different thing.
01:07:20.800 - 01:07:23.640, Speaker C: But, yeah, yeah. I'm not. Not a regulator.
01:07:23.792 - 01:08:20.450, Speaker A: It might be, you know, it's helpful also to just ground us that, like, proof of stake is a consensus mechanism that replaces proof of work. And these are really the two major production, widely adopted consensus mechanisms used in crypto. And proof of stake is superior. It is far less energy intensive, and that is something that many people, including politicians, have raised as a concern for the long term viability of crypto. And so a system where we have proof of stake is a better system than one without it. And I think we should also just really think critically about that, and our regulator should as well. That provided you believe that crypto provides value to the world, and duh, it absolutely does, it is a permissionless system that allows anyone around the world to participate and interact in a peer to peer method and exchange value.
01:08:20.450 - 01:08:47.121, Speaker A: It is incredibly valuable. As long as you provide that, then you need some computer science tactic for securing the state and right access to the data model of the chain. And proof of stake is a better consensus mechanisms for governing that data than proof of work for both the security and the amount of security provides and the less amount of energy intensivity that it requires.
01:08:47.237 - 01:09:12.013, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. All right. I think the last question I had here, guys, is around, like, liquid staking moving to l two s. So if you actually just look at a lot of the on chain activity in crypto, it's starting to move to some of these l two s. And you would have to assume that LSD's would also, like, liquid stake would also move to l two s. I'm curious, is this the way that you see things going as well?
01:09:12.393 - 01:10:24.406, Speaker A: I can jump in to just say that I think the future of Ethereum is going to be, or the future of usability on Ethereum is going to be built on top of l two s. And I love a saying that the bankless guys have, which is that like, the future of l one is for robots, meaning that it's more of like the settlement layer for all of the L2s that exist. And I think that's a good framework as a reminder that, look, even now, like in this bear market, we are past like the ultrasound barrier, as it's called. But we're in a net deflationary paradigm right now, just based on, on chain usage. And that, remember, is, you know, a function of what the fees are to actually transact on chain. If we're at these fee levels, you know, in this status of a bear market, when we can get to the next bull market, fees are going to skyrocket just like they have in the last two bull markets that participated in. And when that happens, the number of use cases that can feasibly exist on layer one drop down pretty substantially because of the transaction costs that exist there.
01:10:24.406 - 01:10:52.614, Speaker A: So you have to imagine that especially as we enter the next bull market, the new user experiences and dapps of the subsequent bull market are largely going to be built on the l two s. And it just makes sense that you're going to want to have lsds that represent your state ETH on l one to be usable in those application experiences that will increasingly exist and be built on their twos. So I do view it as pretty darn important.
01:10:52.914 - 01:10:55.214, Speaker B: Darren, I would assume you agree there.
01:10:56.874 - 01:11:27.428, Speaker C: Yeah. So, yeah, the l two future is looking very, very bright. We're already seeing, obviously, massive tvls into l two s reduction in costs. So all of that is working in terms of liquid staking tokens. If you hold a liquid staking token, you are staking. It doesn't matter whether you hold it on l one or you hold it on l two. If you acquire it on l one, or if you acquire it on l two, it doesn't matter.
01:11:27.428 - 01:12:20.338, Speaker C: You are still staking, you are still earning that kind of those rewards. So what deployment to l two s really mean is that people can access this product at a much cheaper rate, so you can actually get involved, it's much cheaper to use it. And then you can use, there'll be these vergening l two ecosystems. Each l two will have their own kind of style, have their own lending platforms, products, or non financial stuff as well. And so each one you'll be able to use for different things. And it doesn't really matter where you hold it. Do you hold it on l two or not so that's how we kind of see it.
01:12:20.338 - 01:12:49.684, Speaker C: We see it as actually we see l two s as from deploying our liquid staking token to l two is actually a ux thing and an access thing. We want people to have accessibility to these things and having them on l two doesn't necessarily give you that having them on an l two does. We actually won an op grant to incentivize liquidity on optimism and that's been helping as well to drive that.
01:12:51.044 - 01:13:05.364, Speaker B: Guys, great, great conversation. Really, really interesting. Just to get your thoughts around the future of staking. Liquid staking market share Shanghai, anything else? Final points here, maybe a final point.
01:13:05.444 - 01:13:39.724, Speaker A: Is just future of staking is bright. Dont let the fud, dont let regulation by enforcement scare you out of what I believe is going to be one of the most important verbs of the future of ethereum. Of course, weve been in a world of buy, sell, trade, of store send, receive, and increasingly in the last and prior bull market, more on chain usage. I do believe that staking is here to stay and its going to be a critically important third of the future of adhering.
01:13:40.624 - 01:14:03.954, Speaker C: Actually its also primitive. We'll see liquid staking tokens being used in some very interesting and innovative ways. Innovation is actually something that's going to come out of this as well. We're already seeing some protocols use liquid staking tokens in cool ways and we should see more and more of that in the future.
01:14:05.414 - 01:14:28.788, Speaker B: We interviewed Jesse, the head of ecosystem or head of protocol at Coinbase last week on the podcast, and I think he said it well, which is it's a bear market for prices and it's a bull market for on chain activity. So I think he said it well. And Darren and John just, yeah, appreciate pre, appreciate your guys insight, insights and also just appreciate what you guys do for the space moving the staking world forward. So thank you.
01:14:28.836 - 01:14:29.532, Speaker C: Let's build.
01:14:29.668 - 01:14:30.544, Speaker A: Let's build.
01:14:31.404 - 01:14:31.884, Speaker B: Thanks guys.
