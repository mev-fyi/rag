00:00:00.760 - 00:00:36.904, Speaker A: Awesome. I'm Bret. Taj Paul. I look after the institutional business at Coinbase. By way of background, I was 25 years in traditional finance, sales and trading at JPMorgan and Barclays, where I was for 16 years. In the past couple years of trying to rebuild Barclays and expand and innovate, I got to a point where I felt like if I really believed in the disruption of, of financial services through technology, I was probably seated at the wrong firm. And so my sort of journey led to Coinbase, where I joined two and a half years ago.
00:00:36.904 - 00:01:13.734, Speaker A: In that timeframe, everyone in the room probably knows Coinbase for the retail side of the business. And I just thought it would be a unique opportunity to tell you a little bit about the growth of the institutional business. When I got there, it was a team of five people. We had a few billion in assets under custody, which was mostly just high net worth. People who had been invested for a long time. We didn't have much in the way of the sort of clients that I spent my career covering. Hedge funds, endowments, asset managers, pensions, banks, challenger banks, the institutional world.
00:01:13.734 - 00:02:03.744, Speaker A: Our trading volumes were tens of millions in a month. If you fast forward to today, the institutional business has 150 people dedicated to it in the sales, training and prime businesses. The assets under custody for the firm are 258 billion, but over 50% of which are now represented by institutions. So a handful, two, 3 billion, became 138 billion. Of course, with the market correction, things will move around a bit. And our trading volumes, once we had a more fully built smart order routing system, agency trading, and all of that grew from amplified from 30 million a month sort of thing to two to 3 billion a day, and the volumes continued to escalate. So that's a little bit about the institutional business.
00:02:03.744 - 00:02:16.397, Speaker A: We'll get into it more. I'd like a fulsome introduction from you, Eric, and then I hope to do a little bit more storytelling as opposed to sort of advocacy, if you like. So, Eric, tell us about your background, then we'll jump right into it. Sure.
00:02:16.445 - 00:02:22.197, Speaker B: Thanks. Nice to see you all here, and it's great to be down. A little hot out here right now, by the way.
00:02:22.245 - 00:02:22.913, Speaker A: It is.
00:02:23.493 - 00:03:21.842, Speaker B: So I've spent my career in trading, investing. I'm mainly a macro investor. I started one river asset management about a decade ago, trading mostly in volume and quantitative markets, but always with an eye toward kind of, what's the, what's the next big risk or opportunity? So we spent a lot of time with our institutional clients or firms like, I probably shouldn't name them. But, you know, many of the largest pension plans and banks in the US and internationally, we. Our move into crypto was actually in November of 2020. So we had anticipated probably a theme that a lot of you folks are pretty familiar with, which is this monetary debasement theme. But we'd spent the probably year and a half, two years leading up to the pandemic anticipating that whenever the next recession hit, we would see a very aggressive fiscal expansion out of the US, and that would be married to monetary policy.
00:03:21.842 - 00:04:07.074, Speaker B: And so you observe these periods throughout history when nations economies get to points where they have an awful lot of debt and leverage in the system that needs some type of reboot. Sometimes that reboot happens through a big default. More often than not, it happens through a period of a policy choice, which is really just to kind of inflate the dead away. And I think a lot of people get hysterical about talking about policymakers creating inflation. It's actually a pretty rational policy choice in an environment where there aren't many, you know, great economic choices. So we had, we kind of anticipated that. And so we were, and our clients were very well positioned for it.
00:04:07.074 - 00:04:58.806, Speaker B: Having not anticipated the pandemic, we kind of just saw the policy inevitability of what happened after the pandemic. And in our hunt for really convex opportunities, we saw digital assets as being something that was really poorly understood on a lot of different levels, from regulatory perspective, from a custody perspective, from trading perspective, security, et cetera. And we felt that these assets had a long way to go. So that was our entry into the space. We made the decision subsequently to build out a digital asset manager as part of our business. It's been a really exciting path to take here, and our goal in digital certainly is to be the leading institutional digital asset manager. So anyway, love it.
00:04:58.830 - 00:05:35.594, Speaker A: So I just want to frame that again for the audience. So, a 30 year veteran of trading macro markets, mostly all on the buy side, as we call it, entered into crypto two and a bit years ago, has set up an independent digital asset manager now to scale the business. So the storytelling part, I think, should begin at your entry point. So as a practitioner of markets, you're thinking about doing what was at the time a very significant trade. Take us through your thought process. Like, what considerations were you thinking through? How did you activate in crypto?
00:05:36.214 - 00:06:09.664, Speaker B: Yeah, so I traded crypto just personally, but not, we hadn't made a move into this in the firm. I had a rough sense of liquidity at a, you know, personal trading level, which, you know, wasn't the most liquid market. I've traded. I've traded a lot of really liquid markets. We made the decision together with one of our largest clients. It's all public record, by the way, a large UK client to make at the time, which is the largest institutional allocation. So that was in November, and it was on the back of this investment theme that I just described.
00:06:09.664 - 00:07:32.812, Speaker B: But the question was how to do it, because we had over $600 million that we were, were committing, or that we intended to commit to the space. And so we kind of scrambled through a due diligence of all the different trading platforms, even some of the existing products, because we're not opposed to investing in other people's products if they're the best expression of an investment thesis. And what was apparent is that there are an awful lot of players in this space space. But when you're looking to invest the type of money that we wanted to invest, and my view has always been, when you get into a market, you get in quickly, and when you get out, you get out quickly, particularly if you're moving size, just because the moment other people figure out what you're doing, the market's going to run away from you. So we actually found that Coinbase I loved, and our firm concluded that having custody and institutional trading on an agency basis all in one spot. When I say agency basis, I just mean that they don't have a prop business, they don't have a market making business in the traditional sense. And having spent the early part of my career on Wall street, I've seen plenty of prop businesses and market making business front run customer orders.
00:07:32.812 - 00:08:03.944, Speaker B: That was my biggest fear, is that we were going to get front run. And the structure at Coinbase was, you know, was such that they just literally didn't have that capability. So anyway, I had known Brett from his previous life, and we had done all of our due diligence quietly through kind of intermediaries, because we didn't want anyone to know that we were looking at the space. And I called Brett up and said, I've got something to do and we need to get approved quickly, but I'm not going to tell you what we're going to do.
00:08:04.364 - 00:08:46.204, Speaker A: This is an exciting point. So you're a fiduciary, you manage other people's money. You need to be convinced that you can buy at the best price, sell at the best price, safely, custody assets. You've already identified this conflict of interest that was absent in an agency model. Tell us more about your rationale and your level of comfort in advising your end client on, what was the experience like before? You had an expectation of doing diligence, you bought some crypto. Was it a good experience, a bad experience? Things to be improved upon?
00:08:49.144 - 00:08:59.756, Speaker B: There was a lot of uncertainty, as you can imagine, just because we knew when news broke of what we were going to do and Brett didn't, I don't know how much you thought we were going to buy when we started.
00:08:59.820 - 00:09:01.300, Speaker A: You didn't tell me your full size.
00:09:01.492 - 00:09:52.622, Speaker B: So we didn't even tell everyone in our firm at all. I just kept dribbling. I just kept saying, Brett, you're going to get a $50 million wire, $100 million wire this afternoon. He's like, oh, that's great, because we're done. I was like, well, not exactly, but there was uncertainty around how the regulators would, would view the investment that we made. The UK regulators, us, were an SEC registered investment manager, our client, or is registered with UK authorities, and we didn't really know how even people in our firm, I had a pretty good sense for my firm, but in the client's firm, how they'd view a move into this space, because as everyone here knows, it can be pretty controversial. It's less so than it was a couple years ago, but anyway, that was all exciting.
00:09:52.622 - 00:10:30.764, Speaker B: The transaction itself was. The most fun part is I've done some very large transactions in illiquid markets over my career, but nothing kind of quite at that ratio. And we got it done over five days. The market didn't hear about it. We did it. I led the execution on our side, which I honestly haven't execution in anything for the last 20 years. But that was probably a good thing because a lot of the Algos that these guys have, which are excellent, and there are many of them across their institutional execution platform, but I think that it's probably my gut and we'll never know.
00:10:30.764 - 00:11:17.514, Speaker B: All we know is the result is that we bought that much at below the average price over that period of time. And I think it was working with an excellent team, but also kind of playing with these Algos a bit. And there's some pretty quirky things in the digital markets when you're, for instance, buying up to a resistance level and then stepping away from the market, and then the market crashes and then people pile on and then you can buy more. So it was a lot of fun to do all those things. The fallout was that there were all sorts of people and investors who questioned that move. And thank God it worked out. It worked out very well.
00:11:17.514 - 00:12:10.926, Speaker B: Incidentally when we were able to keep it quiet, which is a freaking miracle, based on everything I've seen in markets. We kept it quiet for a month, and then we were forced to, to disclose it. And so I called Eric Schatzker at Bloomberg the day before and said, I think there's a story that you're probably going to be interested in, because we figured we'd rather have him break it than just have to kind of publish a news release. And when that story hit the tape, that was the day that bitcoin blew through 20,000 and kind of never looked back. So it kind of had confirmed our suspicions that just the news that a large institution had actually put money into the space is pretty impactful. So thank God you kept it quiet. We were going to keep it quiet, yeah.
00:12:10.950 - 00:12:48.800, Speaker A: And since then, it's been a watershed moment for the institutions. Right. Because in the effectively year to 18 months since that timeframe, we've onboarded some of the largest asset managers, hedge funds in the world. And if anyone cares to look in our shareholder letter, we put a pretty impressive list of clients there. I won't name them one by one. So crypto is something I feel like it's learned by doing, and it was kind of fun to watch eric learn by doing, trying to test the resiliency of the market, test what would move the market, take us through. So here's a trivia question for us.
00:12:48.800 - 00:12:52.724, Speaker A: What's the most amount of bitcoin you've either bought or sold on an hourly basis?
00:12:53.654 - 00:12:59.950, Speaker B: Oh, God, certainly. 75 to 100 million.
00:13:00.062 - 00:13:14.674, Speaker A: Yeah, 75 to 100 million an hour, which is kind of fun. And take us through a little bit, the process of running it 24/7 because we have Asia open, Asia closed, volatile weekends. What's it like? It's not like a set it and forget it strategy, is it?
00:13:15.214 - 00:13:58.832, Speaker B: No, no. I mean, while we used algos, we would. We probably shouldn't go into too great detail in terms of exactly what we did, but we did a lot of moderating of the actual algos. Just thinking that there probably are people who are a lot smarter than I am, who know footprints of all these different types of execution, who do a pretty good job at front running. So we kind of use multiple algos at different sizes. We'd really speed up just to test the market, kind of really speed up the pace of execution. Because with these algos, you can kind of say, well, I'm going to try to buy 10 million an hour, 50 or 100.
00:13:58.832 - 00:14:29.164, Speaker B: And I think when we actually, when we first started with your team because I knew how much we need to buy, and I knew that the math was such that we had to buy it. Like, you couldn't buy it at 2 million an hour because there just was going to be too much. And so I remember your team was like, yeah, you know, we've done some pretty big transactions here, and I think anything more than 2 million an hour is going to, you know, you're going to really move the market. And I was like, well, that, well, let's just see, you know, like, okay, well, yeah, let's see. Like, let's. Let's just do ten. Like, well, you can't do ten.
00:14:29.164 - 00:15:16.328, Speaker B: Like, well, let's try, you know, let's try. Let's try. Let's try. And so one of the, one of the observations I'd make is when you try to do something really fast and then you step away, there are an awful lot of algos that just think some dumb money came in and then just, you know, they push it down really fast and really hard. And so, yeah, so anyway, those are the, you know, those are the kind of, the types of things just to try, to, try to look a little irrational at times. The other thing that was funny was your guys. I said, well, what if we buy a whole lot and we step away and then we just kind of put bids below the market and they're like, let's grate, like one or 2 million? I said, no, let's just put 10 million every so often down for a long way.
00:15:16.328 - 00:15:41.964, Speaker B: I'm like, well, that would be stupid because all the guys on Twitter would go nuts, and then there's just going to be this massive cascade. I was like, but maybe we want that. So, yeah, anyway, I felt like it was taking someone my age who traded through a lot of crazy markets in Europe in the nineties and saw a lot of this type of activity and then just applying it to these new algo driven markets, which is fun.
00:15:42.004 - 00:16:01.184, Speaker A: So from the art of execution, let's cover one more point, which is, is it really 24/7 OTC trading? There's a memory I've got, if I could jog your memory on Thanksgiving, if that brings anything back to you. Well, why don't you do the setup? Go ahead.
00:16:02.684 - 00:17:08.582, Speaker B: So one of the things that was important to us is it's often easy to buy a market. It's harder to sell a market, typically. And you also, it was important for us with our client, and it was important for the client and to just kind of test everything out that we could test out and demonstrate the resiliency of these markets and operations and cash movements and security, et cetera. And so I wanted to try to create, number one, we wanted to sell a bunch and just have the money flow out just to demonstrate that, yeah, you can give somebody money, but can you get it back? And so we went through all kind of those standard tests. But what I really wanted to do is just test out our team in a 24 7365 market and test out Coinbase. And so we made the decision, we're going to buy $50 million of bitcoin Thanksgiving day. And I didn't tell anyone.
00:17:08.582 - 00:17:18.991, Speaker B: I didn't tell my family, I didn't tell our firm, we didn't tell. And so I was asking Brett if he wants to tell his story because I think it was a little hard for his marriage.
00:17:19.117 - 00:17:38.299, Speaker A: Yeah. So we were driving up, we had three kids in the car, two dogs going up to Vermont. And the phone goes and it's, you know, Eric Peters. And my wife's like, Brett, I mean, you've been talking to this guy for like weeks on end and days on end. What's up? Like, everyone quiet. And he talked to Eric. Put on my airpods.
00:17:38.299 - 00:18:09.476, Speaker A: I'm like, you're doing what? Wait, when? And you're like, now? I'm like, I need 17 minutes. I'm like, drove in. Meanwhile, in the 17 minutes I just got cell phone signaled back and started to call my team. My head trader was with his family going to see his wife's parents. And he had just left the house with his wife, kids and dogs. And I asked him to turn it around. And so he came back and his wife took the kids, the dogs and drove to her parents.
00:18:09.476 - 00:18:30.748, Speaker A: And so he stayed back. And this chain of events happened in geographic places around the world. And then friendly, Eric said, yeah, no, it needs to happen right now. And we did. So we kicked off a buying program. My wife was trying to still take the turkey out of the oven and all the rest of it, and she invited me. And you gave me the, you let me have Thanksgiving dinner with my family.
00:18:30.748 - 00:19:00.568, Speaker A: So thank you, Eric. Thank you very much. So many memorable experiences in trying to set up a marketplace and being tested to the limit at times. But I was proud that our 24/7 OTC trading did really work. I think my head trader, his family, he missed Thanksgiving dinner. So you owe him one. Let's talk a little bit about market volatility, things we've talked about, financial disruption in crypto store value.
00:19:00.568 - 00:19:25.886, Speaker A: You talked a little bit about that in the beginning. But with the setup of potentially inflationary backdrop, what would your observations as a practitioner of markets for these many years? And it feels like crypto could be at, like, yet another inflection point right now with respect to the market conditions. Like, what are your thoughts going through your mind? Are you sanguine about it? It's a, it's a. It's a moment in time. It's a pivotal moment. Like what, what are you thinking about.
00:19:25.910 - 00:19:28.662, Speaker B: Here on the macro side?
00:19:28.718 - 00:19:29.526, Speaker A: On the macro side?
00:19:29.590 - 00:20:16.332, Speaker B: So I'm one of these people. I think I've studied markets too long to believe that anyone knows what fair value of anything is. I think I've just become too cynical about it. So I love all these guys that just spend enormous amounts of time trying to figure out what the earnings are of this company, which I think is a valuable pursuit. So what's the price target? It's like, well, the price target is a function of the price to earnings ratio. And none of these guys can tell you why the price to earnings ratio is what it is, because that's just based on sentiment, on policy. A lot of these things that, as a macro investor, I think dominate a lot of the micro details.
00:20:16.332 - 00:21:30.014, Speaker B: When I think about markets, I think that free markets anyway, are, are incredible forward looking machines. And I qualify that as free markets because there are an awful lot of markets that today are less free than they were certainly when I started trading. One of the things I love about crypto is just, it really is a free market. And people can talk about whales manipulating this or that, but these are still people that are taking an awful lot of risk. And so they're people that are betting and the markets are free and the Fed is not the buyer of last resort or anything like that. So I think it's natural to think that these markets are very forward looking because that's how a real free market operates. And given that, I'm not a big believer in determining what an actual fair value of anything is in the world, let alone bitcoin or ETH or whatever asset, I think in terms of market cadence for us, when we were investing, we were at a point where we saw this policy becoming incredibly aggressive, just mind boggling aggressive.
00:21:30.014 - 00:22:28.476, Speaker B: If you spent your career in these markets and you saw what the Fed had done and what treasury had done, meaning the government in terms of spending, it was just to think that the biggest economy in the world could borrow 15% of GDP and then have it fully funded by the Fed, is just, there's no historical precedent for that, even in a war, by the way. And so when we bought, we recognized that those things weren't fully appreciated and that there were a lot of headwinds to crypto that people, if they learned more, would feel more comfortable about, like you can custody these assets. They aren't all only used by drug dealers, et cetera. And so there were all these forces that we thought would lead to a, you know, a significant appreciation. And so that's when we got involved. We actually got out of all of those positions. We still have, you know, we've, we've reloaded at lower levels, but we crystallized all those gains in the, in the big run up.
00:22:28.476 - 00:23:40.144, Speaker B: So we, we took over a billion and a quarter dollars out of the market, and it wasn't because we didn't have confidence in the long term success of these assets, but when people are borrowing money to buy bitcoin or any other asset and being very public about it, and there's just so much hype going on. If you're as cynical as I guess I've become, I like to think I'm an optimistic person, but I just ruined your thanksgiving. But if you think about cadence, you go, okay, well, there's. A good time to buy is when people don't appreciate things and it's off people's radar. A good time to sell, or certainly to not buy is when there's just an enormous amount of hype. And then I think we're now in a place when you start seeing things like UST break and the Fed has initiated its tightening cycle. We're entering the zone in terms of cadence, where these are the general periods where you should be looking to accumulate positions, and that's our view.
00:23:40.144 - 00:24:31.670, Speaker B: I don't think that the hiking cycle is finished, but I do think given that crypto is such a free market, I think that crypto rolled over anticipating that the Fed was going to begin its tightening cycle and tightening financial conditions in a material way. That's happening right now in a very mature way. In many respects, this is one of the fastest tightenings of financial conditions that we've seen in history. It's not over either, but I think what we'll see with these assets, my expectation would be that they will bottom and they will start appreciating again before the Fed stops hiking. So just because that's how they look out six months and go, well, what these guys are doing right now is unsustainable. They're going to have to ultimately pivot, and these assets will start appreciating. So that's how I would think about the cadence, and that's how we've always traded.
00:24:31.822 - 00:24:34.374, Speaker A: That's Eric coming close to calling the bottom. I love it.
00:24:34.414 - 00:25:02.444, Speaker B: That's what they're wanting to hear. No, I'd say by the time we get to two thirds of three quarters of the way through this hiking cycle, and by the way, we just started, but I think it doesn't even mean the prices will necessarily be lower than here. But in terms of timing and cadence, there's not a lot of negativity in this room or a conference like this in the broad world of tech investments. And there's an awful lot of negativity, but I don't think it's over. I think we're in it, though.
00:25:02.524 - 00:25:20.594, Speaker A: No, super well reasoned argument. Thank you. This crowd needs to turn that into, like, a three word tweet. So let's pivot a little bit. So how exactly do you get the Jay Clayton, the former head of the SEC, to be on your advisory board?
00:25:23.134 - 00:25:27.070, Speaker B: Well, so we. I cold called him.
00:25:27.182 - 00:25:32.074, Speaker A: You what? Yeah, you cold called him. Amazing. Tell us a story.
00:25:34.014 - 00:26:48.040, Speaker B: So, after we entered this space, I've spent my career staying as far away, and I tell this to Jay in the nicest possible way, I've spent my career staying as far away from regulators as possible, which is pretty easy for someone in my seat to do. You just kind of know, okay, where are the lines that stay well within them? I knew that if we were going to go, I knew that if we had a realistic chance of being the leading digital institutional investor, that we needed to get a lot smarter about regulation, and in fact, not even just smarter about regulation, but have a constructive voice to help regulation regulators think through what's the appropriate way to regulate this. And I don't. I wouldn't go as far to say as I know how to do it. I just know that when you have a new technology, things inevitably change and have to adjust. And so Jay Clayton was viewed somewhat as a, you know, kind of a crypto skeptic, which meant, for someone like me, I don't need to fill my life with cheerleaders. I need people who have sage advice and, you know, and are and good at challenging my views and our team's views.
00:26:48.040 - 00:27:51.244, Speaker B: And so I just cold called him the day after he left the SEC, and he took my call, and that started. He was actually the only person outside of our firm who came into the office during COVID and we had multiple kind of months of luncheons. Where we talked about. And I think, honestly, I think he was just interviewing me. Did you see if we were the right kind of mindset of a firm to help be a thoughtful voice in terms of trying to create a sound regulatory foundation upon which the private sector can build? And the first meeting that we had, he made it very clear that at his time at the SEC, that was his objective. You know, as we all know, there's a lot of hype, there's a lot of misallocation capital in this space, a lot of wonderful, exciting new ideas that are going to fail. I applaud literally all of it, except the fraud.
00:27:51.244 - 00:28:21.704, Speaker B: But from a regulatory perspective, you need to have a sound foundation if you're going to do all of us in this room justice in terms of allowing us to, to thrive and flourish with our various businesses. And so anyway, he's been an amazing advisor to have. He helped me build out this really esteemed advisory board. I never thought I needed one, but now I realize that I do. And yeah, it's been great.
00:28:21.824 - 00:28:32.700, Speaker A: It's been awesome to see him sort of really deeply invest himself in the space. I'd like to talk about Project Hamilton a little bit now.
00:28:32.852 - 00:28:33.500, Speaker B: Sure.
00:28:33.652 - 00:29:59.694, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if any of you know what it is, but there's a collective of us who are looking for real use cases to disrupt the financial services. And so when we think through interesting applications of stablecoins, one of the things that we'll go a little deeper into, but there's a group of us who are in conversation with the Fed and the treasury with an idea to help the US think about issuing t bills and settling them with privately managed stable coins. And that may be sort of a controversial thing this week to talk about following last week's events, but that conversation has been growing in terms of momentum and acceptance. There's a bunch of things that are in and around that idea, such as sovereignty of the dollar, national security issues, considerations and other. And I think it'd be interesting to hear you reflect on sort of how we got to the idea instead of tokenizing something and way out in illiquid land and trying to have that be the catalyst for a cascading effect of stablecoin use cases. How did we rationalize and rally around sort of the t bills?
00:30:00.154 - 00:31:34.454, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So when we thought about what is it? When we initially thought about what does it mean to be the leading digital asset manager for institutions? Kind of the obvious thing as well. We'll come with a whole range of products for bitcoin ETH and the next ten or 20 coins and apply our systems or approach to that. And that's kind of the obvious thing. The more you think about it, and most of you probably have, the more you realize that this technology suite is so powerful from a kind of speed of execution and settlement standpoint, that it will allow for a much more efficient financial system. And that financial system will become much more efficient not because we're all trading bitcoin, but because we're using blockchain technologies to trade the $200 trillion of financial assets that are not yet tokenized. The question is, how do you create the right regulatory foundation to allow for the tokenization of these $200 trillion of more traditional assets? And then once you create that foundation, how do you actually make that happen? And it's a tricky thing to do because the incumbent financial players have a stake in not wanting to maybe open themselves up to competition from new companies, or they don't want to have to spend money to retool their entire systems.
00:31:34.454 - 00:32:27.774, Speaker B: We've kind of thought a lot about, well, how do we make this happen? And I think our view is you first need to really work with government and regulators and help them think through that regulatory foundation. And then you need to pick some things to start tokenizing from the, I don't say the real world, from the traditional world. And so there's been a tendency for, I think, people to tokenize really liquid assets like real estate. And so our view is that the most important financial markets and assets in the world really is the US dollar and treasury bills. They really are. And the wonderful thing that we observe is that in the stablecoin market, 95% of assets are in dollars. They're not in yuan, they're not in british pounds, they're not in euros, they're not in gold, they're not tokenized anything other than the US dollar.
00:32:27.774 - 00:33:33.312, Speaker B: The US has actually been way late to the game relative to the Chinese. And there's this desire for the US to catch up. What we're advocating for, and I think what you see more frequently from government now, is that they are accepting that the dollar stablecoin market is a way to tokenize the dollar and do it in a way that that can really scale without having to create a central bank, digital currency. And so once we, I say we, once we as a nation tokenize the treasury market, then I think what the irony, what, this would be one of the great ironies of bitcoin. I think there'll be a lot of them, but I think these technologies actually lead to the dominance of the dollar in the global system in a way that will really surprise people. Because once the world is able to use a tokenized dollar that's privatized token, and they can buy treasuries that are tokenized, what will happen is the rest of the financial system will go, okay, that's where we're going. And everyone moved to these technologies.
00:33:33.312 - 00:33:53.724, Speaker B: So that's, you know, we chose to not look at illiquid assets, but focus on the short end of the financing markets because that's where most of the money in the world is. And those are, you know, that's the important collateral for the global financial system. And. Yeah, and to Brett's point, we've been pretty engaged on that topic, and that's been an exciting thing to work on.
00:33:55.104 - 00:34:48.308, Speaker A: I love the audacity of the idea to disrupt the world's largest short term funding market with crypto. I think it's amazing. I think one of the coach, the learning points that I received along the way of helping promote the conversation is not just to advocate for the technology itself, but to demonstrate to regulators that the application of the technology can actually lead to better outcomes. And so taking away. I'm a survivor of a few different financial crises, including the 2008 one, and having a global financial system which was so fragile in those moments and settlement was a big, big question. So I think helping to promote the topic, that instantaneous final settlement is a good thing for a healthy financial operating system, is a big part to the advocacy picture. I think with that, we're going to keep it on time.
00:34:48.308 - 00:34:52.324, Speaker A: Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you so much, Eric.
00:34:52.444 - 00:34:54.124, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you all.
