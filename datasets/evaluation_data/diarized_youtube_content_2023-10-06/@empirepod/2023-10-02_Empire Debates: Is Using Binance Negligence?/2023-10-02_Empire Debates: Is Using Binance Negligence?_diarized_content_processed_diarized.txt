00:00:00.200 - 00:00:30.474, Speaker A: Anybody listening here? If you have your money on Binance and you don't have a hardware wallet, you don't belong in the space. Get out, shut it down, sell it, get it right. You got, you cannot be like, you can be using Binance. There's a lot of cool tools there, and it's an interesting product. But if you're storing your funds capital, your LP's capital on Binance in this moment, considering the range of rumors circulating, I would question the competency of that.
00:00:32.614 - 00:00:50.314, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, welcome back to the podcast. It's Tommy and I'm here with Ryan Zur and Santiago Santos. We're back with another episode. We're going to start off with recent conferences. We hit, we did permissionless, we did token 2049. Santi, why don't we start with you on conference? You hit?
00:00:51.214 - 00:01:12.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I went to permissionless. It was interesting. I was in Austin. I wanted to see, I think the attendee base is probably the most diversified. You had people from government, you had companies, you had certainly crypto investors. It was happening at the same time. While token 2049, apparently it was 3000 or so attendees.
00:01:12.164 - 00:01:48.156, Speaker C: It didn't feel like that because the venue was so big. But you and I were on the panel who's still investing in crypto. You had some really interesting panels as well. I think if I were to say the biggest takeaway for me in that conference was that it felt to me that non crypto people, particularly companies like you, had JP Morgan there. You had folks from numerous corporations that have been interested in utilizing this, PayPal and whatnot. It felt like those people were more excited about crypto than crypto natives. And it just reminded me of, this happens in every cycle.
00:01:48.156 - 00:02:36.264, Speaker C: There is a time where the skepticism and the morale within crypto people is just so high, is so low and volatile that it was just really interesting because to see that, and I think it reflects the state of the market we're in, and it also reflects that this technology has come a long way. I don't think we're in that 2018. Everyone is slapping blockchain to their public, you know, public companies using blockchain in their reports the same way they're using AI right now as a marketing kind of gimmick. I think the work is real. The intent and the commitment is real. You know, we record a podcast with the head of JP Morgan Crypto, and they've been working on this for six years now. And they have so many products under the hood that they can't talk about publicly.
00:02:36.264 - 00:03:10.616, Speaker C: And so, you know, later on the pod, we can talk about things that, that those corporations kind of need to see, like privacy is huge. And until we have that, it's going to be difficult to properly, like, have these folks operate in a public environment, but they're doing a lot of the work in anticipation that these solutions are going to be built. So that was my biggest takeaway. Like, you know, the morale in crypto is very low. People are fighting on Twitter all the time, and. But non crypto people seem to be more optimistic about crypto, which is an interesting, I guess, point.
00:03:10.800 - 00:03:55.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I was at permissionless with Santiago. As for takeaways, I mean, definitely saw a lot of good early stage companies, a lot of AI focused ones, a lot on ETH. I guess what I did see was just glimmers of just a renewed focus on Ethereum, ZK tech being built on Ethereum and, and the ecosystem around there. We didn't see a lot of other Alt L1 s mentioned, didn't see a lot of a big ecosystem push there. Did see a big push by Zksync Scroll Linea, which is the ZKevM built by consensys. It seemed like there was just a pretty strong renewed focus there. And that bleeds into the modular versus monolithic side.
00:03:55.824 - 00:04:29.286, Speaker B: I think one of my favorite takeaways was Sriram from Eigen layer, which we invested in. We had a bit of a side chat discussing modular versus monolithic, and he just continued to argue that you have to serve developers and take advantage of the largest ecosystem. Makes sense, and technicals don't exist solely in a vacuum. So he thinks that Ethereum is not the fastest or the cheapest chain, but it's at a maximization point where it's good enough and improving technically, coupled with the largest ecosystem of value and people. And I thought that was a solid takeaway.
00:04:29.470 - 00:05:17.234, Speaker A: Yeah. So we had team members at 2049, and whenever team members go and do a conference, we try to institutionalize that knowledge and get a report. So the report indicated that a, some level of surprise by all of us of how quickly this Singaporean a market has come back because Singapore prohibited finance. Everybody had migrated to FTX, and some people got like really crushed. And so Singapore was a mausoleum sort of last year at this time. And so it seems to, like, be gaining steam and coming back strongly. There is just 1000 l two s flowering a lot in the optimism ecosystem.
00:05:17.234 - 00:06:30.914, Speaker A: And there seems to be just this, like, to your point, Tommy, this threshold of developer mindshare migrating back to ETH saying, hey, this is good enough for us to build on and be here. And thusly, we continue to see value bleed from the alt layer ones, sort of the like, ETH killer generation of late 2017 2018, while there are some really interesting novel experiments popping up. And so those were two things combined with a very cautious fundraising environment where if you haven't, if you're a capital allocator and you haven't delivered a DPI, you know, comfortably above two, then you're really like, you got a long road, a tough road ahead of you. And so we're seeing, you know, we're seeing this sort of, like, filtering of the real players in capital allocation from the pretenders. And we continue to see more and more funds taking their, their last breath of air before shutting down.
00:06:31.294 - 00:06:41.314, Speaker B: Ryan, could you just give some color there? Like what, how many funds are not at that mark where they've at least returned two x their initial investment? Like, what percentage of funds just do not meet that mark?
00:06:42.684 - 00:07:38.394, Speaker A: I mean, ultimately, it's a vintage question, right? If you were around prior to September 2017, you basically got there. If you launched, like, post that, you'd be really, you know, you got some real challenge. Unless you hit some big winners. Yeah. You know, you and I have talked about this before on pods, where I'm constantly reminded that you're not that smart. And luck plays such an important role in this game, because timing is often really, can be expressed in terms of luck. And so really, it's about timing, I would say difficult to estimate across the approximately 750 funds globally that we've had, but probably less than 50 are above a two x DPI at this point.
00:07:38.394 - 00:07:50.514, Speaker A: In fact, I'd say confidently less than 50. I write lp checks into a lot of funds, and less than 10% are even approaching that number.
00:07:50.934 - 00:08:19.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. In terms of it's important distinction. Like, mom is not DPI, because a lot of these things are illiquid and get marked up to some sort of discount. But DPI is like how much you've actually returned. And it's easier to do. For venture funds, which there are plenty in crypto, there's also a liquid venture structured as hedge funds. They have a combination of liquid positions and early stage positions.
00:08:19.854 - 00:09:08.564, Speaker C: So it's difficult because DPI, unless you've redeemed, you're not getting that right, unlike a venture. And so a lot of funds are structured as liquid, as a hedge fund. And so say that even you invested in like you had. It's very frustrating because I also talked to the largest fund of funds and they always struggle with what's better. Should we invest in the next pure venture fund, ten year commitment or hedge fund? And that is going to invariably do early stage stuff, because you want to be doing that. And the challenge there for liquid is, say that you invested in 2017, you would have been up at 1.30 x or more on some funds, and now you're down considerably.
00:09:08.564 - 00:09:36.118, Speaker C: You're maybe still up ten x, actually. But that's not DPI. That's just mark to market to some sort of valuation framework for the illiquid stuff that can't be easily liquidated. A lot of it might be blocked. So that's the challenge in both the opportunity and the challenge of crypto, is that you have to kind of hit the I want to redeem now give me my money. And they're not giving you all of it. Some might have gates.
00:09:36.118 - 00:10:08.118, Speaker C: It's quite challenging, I think, still part of the opportunity in crypto is that. But, yeah, it's. It's. It's difficult for those funds, especially if they have clawbacks. If you're down a lot more, if you're up a lot one year and then you're down a lot the next year, you need to make up to this high watermark to then begin to collect, carry, which really messes the incentives for an allocator. Some of them take excessive risk to get back to that above water, if you will, to start clipping carry. That risk taking is very challenging.
00:10:08.118 - 00:10:34.826, Speaker C: I don't know what the answer to that is, other than if I'm investing my own money to a new manager. I'd rather given the choice of investing in a liquid fund that has been around for a while, but has a really high watermark on a lot of the capital. Right. Versus a new manager or a new fund. New vintage might be pure venture. I would choose that category, the new venture or the new vintage, because it's just a clean slate. And a lot of times in liquid, you don't have that clean slate.
00:10:34.826 - 00:10:55.130, Speaker C: And a lot of the market also profit taking and dynamics, I think, are informed by those type of funds that are trying to kind of make it all back or just get above that high water mark, which you have to really clean up a lot of that stuff. And it's probably going to take a couple of years to get there. I think you saw that in the last cycle.
00:10:55.322 - 00:10:59.814, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you look at this, Tommy, from an allocator's perspective as a GP?
00:11:00.194 - 00:11:23.652, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, the one point I'd want to hit on that Sandy brought up is just how funds react in bull and bear markets. One of the worst things I think a fund to do in a bull market is to aggressively exit and reinvest capital. I don't know, Ryan, if you would disagree with this, but once, once you. Yeah, all right. Maybe I should take it the other side. But no, go ahead.
00:11:23.668 - 00:11:24.316, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:11:24.460 - 00:12:07.144, Speaker B: Basically, you're in a bull market. You're making the already hard decision that most funds don't do, which is to exit, whether that be OTC, liquid reassignments, things like that. It's a, it's a hard process. It's annoying. It takes a long time, if you do go through that process, to exit now, you obviously have tax liabilities to your LP's, right? You sold an asset, you have a gain, a lot of funds, or some funds will say, hey, you know what? We're doing great. Let's reinvest that capital. So now we not only have a tax liability that we may or may not be able to pay out to LP's, some have to, some don't, but they're also investing at the height of valuations in a bubble ish market, which means not only do you owe money to your LP's, but now you're chasing a trend when you should be doing the opposite.
00:12:07.144 - 00:12:32.778, Speaker B: Yeah, its kind of tangential to what Santis saying, but I think that there shouldnt be reinvesting in funds. I think funds should just aggressively distributable bull markets. And I think right now is the absolute perfect time to be aggressively investing in private deals or liquid opportunities that are great because youre not going to invest at these valuations or these non tourist teams in a bull market. You have to do it now and you have to wait a couple of years.
00:12:32.966 - 00:13:41.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So my view on this, based on the experience that I've had over the years, is that the correct architecture is that you separate out the types of investments. So you have venture vehicle that invests, venture style liquidates sometime between, you know, TGE and TgE plus 180 days. We've done some analysis internally that has shown that a basket of any number of l one s that have come out underperform ETH beyond 180 day timeline on the aggregate. And that should be different than your liquid book. And you get all these venture funds that will liquidate a win, hold it, then an ETH or bitcoin, and then hold it to the term of seven plus two plus two, or whatever the length of the fund is. And then their idea there is they're going to catch the 20 on whatever appreciation and bitcoin and ETH they have.
00:13:41.770 - 00:14:16.304, Speaker A: I think that is not the mandate of the early stage venture vehicle. Then take a win in year three and hold bitcoin for another five years. And you should prioritize distributing because you have such high beta in this market. The volatility is so expressive. Take the wins where you can. I can tell you that it feels really good. Once you get above a two DPI, then you made it.
00:14:16.304 - 00:14:17.914, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:17.994 - 00:14:42.970, Speaker C: For the challenge of that, Ryan, is I don't disagree with you. I actually looked at that as well in terms of the trading. The issue, though, is that your vesting schedule is, you know, when you say actually practically liquidate 180 days, you can't do that practically unless you were selling, means you guess you could OTC, you know, hedge at OTC, you could, you know, do some combination of perps and take shorts in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You could do a number of strategies. Okay. Yeah, I just want to clarify that, because typically the vesting schedule is.
00:14:42.970 - 00:14:53.496, Speaker C: You gotta. If you're not doing that, and some funds are not sophisticated enough to do that, or there's. It's not practically possible. It takes two years to actually exit the position.
00:14:53.600 - 00:15:00.456, Speaker B: Yeah, look, we invested early. We backed you. We loved you, we helped you build. But, you know, hey, look, I want to exit my entire position within 180 days.
00:15:00.480 - 00:15:49.688, Speaker A: Like, how do you not? Yeah. You're not saying I want to exit my entire position 180 days. What I'm saying is that, objectively, the data shows that in infrastructure investments, the optimal exit window is within 180 days on the aggregate. Looking at, we've looked at, I think, two dozen examples of sort of the ETH killer generation, and now looking at generation three, and I'm not saying that that's what you do. I'm just saying that, like, the data shows that that's the optimal investment strategy. And like, you do then have to be pragmatic about. Yeah, you know, we'll take principle off table, take Principal plus X off table, because we, you know, we're pragmatic entrepreneurs.
00:15:49.688 - 00:15:59.992, Speaker A: And often what I'll say is, because we're the ones sitting liquid when you bottom out in year three, we're the ones back buying.
00:16:00.088 - 00:16:00.724, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:01.064 - 00:16:11.414, Speaker A: And it's. That's also useful for an entrepreneur that, like, we won't talk totally about get out of it, but we. But we will be pragmatic about cash management.
00:16:11.534 - 00:16:46.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's two things there, which is it's the hardest thing. One of the hardest things you do right, but you have to focus on risk management. One, what's the probability of something that's already up 50 x 100 x in your book to do another? That and in venture it's a power law so you need one or two. If you don't have one or two or 3100 x, you're probably not going to make it to that two dpi. So you go back to 100 and say I need to take chips off the table. It's become such a large position of the portfolio. It's proper risk management and I'm going to use that capital to reinvest in folks as I did with you when no one wanted to give you money.
00:16:46.104 - 00:17:28.944, Speaker C: And I need to find those or sometimes a combination of that plus investing in the ecosystem, in startups that are building on top of, if it's an infrastructure investment, I generally tend to find that the best founders have no problem with that. They're like, hey, just do it in a graceful manner. Find a right home for that position. And there's ways to do that difficult more now because there's very little liquidity, but the OTC market's thriving, it's actually booming right now. And so there's ways to execute these things. And so at the end of the day, I think the strongest founders very most of the time don't react negatively to that. They understand that there's time, taxes, a position and that doesn't mean you're not going to continue to help them, by the way.
00:17:28.944 - 00:17:31.288, Speaker C: It's like it's capital, but my help, I'm still here.
00:17:31.376 - 00:18:53.638, Speaker A: The other thing that I have often done over the years as well as do buy side OTC with the founder pre launch often. So like pre launch they want some liquidity, buy house, so, so on and so forth, all the buy side on that. And then like, you know, you have a transparent relationship with the founder where like, hey, you're being, you know, you're being real about your own like portfolio balancing and, and you know, and realizing the volatility of this. So me six or twelve months later, also being real with myself and with my, my investors about this is just authentic, right? And, and most of these founders, you know, understand that and because now we've had enough years and enough stories of like, you know, the billionaire founder that wrote back to nothing or the, you know, the guy who just never even looked at a pie chart of their net worth to realize that 99.9% of their wealth was in a locked up token that people are more pragmatic about that in space, like, if you look around the space, the top founders that people really respect from Vitalik all the way down have been pragmatically taking chips off the table the whole way up.
00:18:53.766 - 00:19:21.236, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a hugely positive signal. I mean, it's less just, they were going to be more focused having taken chips off the table. And it's fairly common adventure, too. I mean, you see some recent ipos and it's fairly common for founders to take chips. They should. I mean, I would encourage them all day long. It if a founder comes to me and says, I want to take chips off the table, I say, yeah, of course you're going to be more motivated to then continue to build equity value on the position that you have left.
00:19:21.236 - 00:19:26.824, Speaker C: Now. Different story becomes to me, as secondary says wants to sell 90% of the book, you're like, well, what's wrong here?
00:19:28.884 - 00:19:52.492, Speaker B: I want you guys on founders exiting to get some capital, to not have to worry about bills and stuff. The one tangential thing I do not like from founders, maybe this is a little spicier, because, you know, it's happened over the past couple of months, is founders who realize that their projects aren't going well and decide to make a last minute pivot instead of returning capital to venture funds. That's something that I feel very strongly.
00:19:52.548 - 00:19:54.544, Speaker A: You're touching something.
00:19:55.084 - 00:19:56.664, Speaker B: I came here spicy.
00:19:58.404 - 00:20:05.428, Speaker C: 30% of the, what is it? 30% of your, of your portfolio companies are in that state where you're like, guys, like, stop going conferences, keep up. Like, return the money.
00:20:05.476 - 00:21:09.700, Speaker B: Well, it's just that the thing that I don't understand is like, you spend a really long time diligencing a founder on a specific vertical, right? And you take a lot of risk with other people's money or your own money to back somebody and their vision, and then they come to you six months later, a year later, 18 months later, and they say, hey, you know what? Things aren't going well. We decided we're going to do this totally new thing, and we figured it out in the last two weeks. The thought process just doesn't really make a lot of sense. Frequently tell people, like, I mean, obviously, legally, most funds, again, don't really have a say, right? If you're investing in a safe or a token or something, you don't have any real investor rights to block or make any real decisions unless you're doing your own docs and legitimate diligence, which isn't always the case with an early stage investment on the documentation side. But I always tell them, like, if it's not going well, return capital. You know, maintain your brand and your reputation, and we're happy to back the next thing you do and go through the normal diligence process. But it's just hard to get excited about a pivot when it has nothing to do with your original investment.
00:21:09.892 - 00:21:48.730, Speaker A: And that is exactly the thing. So if we gave you capital at the peak and you have call 40% leftover of the capital and you return the capital, we're actually up ETH. If we could be up ETH against, say, 21 or whatever it is, that's a hug it out. That's a. Next time you come through the door, we're probably writing you a check. That's a really positive, high integrity situation. Whereas too many founders look at this as their personal trust funds that they just want to bleed to zero.
00:21:48.730 - 00:22:32.942, Speaker A: But then what they don't understand is that is your last kick at the can ever at that. So you better have enough money to live on forever, because no one's ever written you check for anything ever again. Not a popsicle stand, not, not a crypto project, not anything. And one of the real issues that we face in the space is, especially when it's a token, a token driven investment, there's a complete dearth of legal recourse. The number of foundations sitting on untold billions of dollars that have delivered no value whatsoever. And these with stiff tongues or Cayman foundations have just turned into glorified trust vehicles for the. For the founders and the.
00:22:32.942 - 00:22:43.874, Speaker A: And the board is egregious. You know, I have really wanted somebody to do an activist fund going and pursuing treasuries. Yeah.
00:22:44.534 - 00:22:49.434, Speaker C: Did this to some extent, but not executed as an activist should. I think it was. You could.
00:22:50.414 - 00:22:57.254, Speaker A: And the problem is there's no. There isn't enough legal recourse. You don't have the same rights that you have as a shareholder. And so you can.
00:22:57.334 - 00:22:58.536, Speaker B: How big are the treasuries?
00:22:58.670 - 00:22:59.684, Speaker A: How much you talking?
00:22:59.724 - 00:23:08.704, Speaker C: Block one golem like, these are billion dollar plus. I mean, so block one, I think, has more bitcoin than microstrategy sailor like.
00:23:09.044 - 00:23:11.300, Speaker B: And that's including the billion that's lost from the cell.
00:23:11.332 - 00:23:11.500, Speaker C: Right?
00:23:11.532 - 00:23:13.244, Speaker B: I think a billion was a 4.
00:23:13.284 - 00:23:17.404, Speaker A: Billion, $4 billion unregulated sales, Curtis.
00:23:17.564 - 00:23:22.624, Speaker B: But I think they ended up only having access to 3 billion. I have to check something. Something was weird there.
00:23:23.484 - 00:24:07.112, Speaker A: None. Nonetheless, look, we did an analysis on this because we thought about getting activists in 2020. And I had participated in the conversations that led to the Digixdao window. And that was just like, you go to the founders and you're like, look, you're the largest token holder. If you return this treasury, which is a multiple of your token, you're actually the one who benefits the most from this. And Sean was really pragmatic about that, and he did it. But we then went and had six other conversations, and all these guys would dance around to not admit that this is just a trust fund to pay them out forever.
00:24:07.288 - 00:24:20.360, Speaker C: You can probably monitor this on chip. Like, they're bar. They're probably barring against that, right? To diversify. They're not selling just because optically they still hold that, but they probably have a ton of, like, they're all just.
00:24:20.432 - 00:24:29.372, Speaker A: Buyer buying t bills right now. The number of this is t bills held by swiss stiff tongues right now would boggle the mind.
00:24:29.468 - 00:24:29.772, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:29.828 - 00:24:31.068, Speaker A: Ten billions of dollars.
00:24:31.116 - 00:24:43.436, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, get ahold of this. And I have the number now. Block one has over 200,000 bitcoin microstrategy. Given their latest purchase, they bought like 4400 bitcoin this, this week.
00:24:43.540 - 00:24:45.144, Speaker A: Yeah, they have 167.
00:24:45.444 - 00:24:47.348, Speaker C: They have like 158,000.
00:24:47.516 - 00:24:52.864, Speaker B: So are we sure we want them returning that capital, though? Like, are we sure we want that bitcoin and ETH cell pressure?
00:24:55.314 - 00:25:30.050, Speaker C: I mean, this is, goes back to price discovery. Yeah, let it rip. I mean, get the band out. And at the end of the day, I mean, this is going to be a conversation also for Malcolm, if and when that happens, all the other different creditors and also, what's, what's another big one? I mean, you have obviously, the conversion of grayscale products, GBTC, ETH, like, at the end of the day, I mean, if you have an et like that, that ultimately, because in the market, I'm always a proponent, it's better to have more transparent and efficient price discovery.
00:25:30.202 - 00:25:31.974, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
00:25:33.754 - 00:25:59.294, Speaker C: If you think that people are not looking at these things and doing some structure around it to hedge that risk. You don't understand markets well enough because sophisticated players are looking at that, and already, it's already kind of, to some extent, priced in and people doing that on the margin. So it's really, in my mind, a nothing burger. Like, just let's distribute it, get it out in the open market and let that run its course.
00:25:59.874 - 00:27:07.084, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that in some cases, like FTX, it's probably overpriced in where people are like, ah, you know, all this Solana is going to hit the market and, like, actually not because Sam was on a seven year vest with that Solana so it's going to be a long, a long bleed of shipping all that Sol out the door, whereas other things are more, just more unknown. It could hit the market all at once. Whether you had legislation that allowed people to go after some of these egregious foundations that have delivered no value, or whether you have something like binance completely blow up and get treated like, you know, like tornado cash. So it's sanctioned, not just, you know, in a legal process. And everybody's got to get out the door all at once. There are most of the, most of the time things are priced in, but there are some events that are, could be really dramatic for the space as well.
00:27:07.684 - 00:27:12.504, Speaker B: I think that's a good segue to finance. Ryan, you want to take that one away?
00:27:13.004 - 00:27:30.452, Speaker A: So, you know, there's a lot of discussion in the space right now. You know, there's been some, a bunch of tweets. Adam Cochran put, put one out yesterday of speculation of just how deep this goes.
00:27:30.628 - 00:27:34.410, Speaker B: Are you done writing that thread, Ryan? They take me like a couple hours.
00:27:34.562 - 00:28:26.038, Speaker A: Well, here's the thing. That thread paired with an immediate, immediate announcement of the unwinding of the russian relationships by binance seemed to me like an admission of guilt, a public admission of guilt. And we know that the Wagner group was using binance for payment. Now, like that's not a controversial thing. So the depths of where this goes is even more shocking than I think any of us understood. We have to remember that six months ago Binance represented about 50% of the exchange off chain volume and as there tentacles and probably 1000 startups in the space. This is not FTX, this is not Mount Gox.
00:28:26.038 - 00:28:45.384, Speaker A: This is something that is like much much more significant if true. And I wanted to kind of unpack with you guys. What are your thoughts on what the implication is if this is true? Because for me it's like it could be something that we have never seen before and we've seen a lot in this space, obviously.
00:28:47.924 - 00:28:55.532, Speaker B: Yeah, I did a podcast with Travis recently on Binance, my TlDr, it's not.
00:28:55.588 - 00:29:00.100, Speaker C: Super long, describe as clang from AK guy who lost all his money on FTX.
00:29:00.292 - 00:29:38.184, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So he's been through this sadly, and you know, clearly knows what to look for and the signs. He has a great thread like bulleting out every single thing that binance has done that's a little sus and it's solid. My take is that I think Czech is too rich and I think binance makes too much money for there to be any fraud. I think it's just killing the golden goose on a scale that doesn't make any sense to me. As for like, the regulatory kyc of violations, stuff like that, I think, yeah, they probably definitely get hit for stuff like that. Everybody and their mother was on binance the last couple of years until recently.
00:29:38.184 - 00:29:51.894, Speaker B: But I don't know, I think that anything less than a full. I think if there's no fraud, the market may actually rally because I think people are pricing in a pretty disastrous unwind and I don't think that's the case case. But I know I might be the outlier here.
00:29:54.594 - 00:29:57.514, Speaker A: Santi, any implications that you draw?
00:29:57.674 - 00:30:36.194, Speaker C: I'm not going to comment on the rumors, which I think a lot of it is at this point, that I think there is a bit of a dynamic where people want to find the next FTX. Now, I think we should always be incredibly skeptical and curious at the same time. Like in crypto, it will always serve you well to be, yes, we're all optimist, but you have to remain highly skeptical. This is having those two, as I think, serve me well, I think will serve anyone well. And you should always be wary of centralized institutions. I mean, that's why we're here.
00:30:36.614 - 00:30:36.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:37.022 - 00:31:02.744, Speaker C: And so I don't, I don't want to offer anything because I'm not close to it. I don't have a strong view. I am cautious, as I am cautious with any centralized party because as I am cautious of the financial system as a whole, like, it is not transparent. All right, here's a question. It's more interesting to think about what will happen. To your point, Ryan, if this goes down. Yeah, it is.
00:31:02.744 - 00:31:07.784, Speaker C: It's a huge reset. Way more than FTX.
00:31:08.184 - 00:31:46.402, Speaker B: All right, here's a question. How much of the binance bullets that Travis shared, these dozens of things that they've done wrong or supposedly done wrong, how much of that is a hyper growth company which has scaled to the largest crypto company we have in a matter of years, versus actual fraud? Like, every company has growing pains, whether you're a startup or whether you are the literal largest company in crypto. So I'm not sure how much of it is actual deathly issues or more so a major company scaling in a new space that can't be domiciled in the US, you know where I'm going with that, or.
00:31:46.578 - 00:32:45.124, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's very valid. Right. That, like, and also by some metrics, until, you know, until chat, GPT and OpenAI, binance was the fastest growing company ever. Right? And so, clearly, they were growing in an uncontrolled fashion. And some of these things were probably more carelessness rather than maliciousness. However, there are a number of data points that indicate that carelessness descended into recklessness. Like, if you're financing, if you're providing payment services directly and emailing back and forth from the Wagner group, who are, like, slaughtering Africans all over the continent, you know, that's a moment where you really got to look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what you're doing here and if you need more money or if you need this type of business.
00:32:45.124 - 00:33:27.178, Speaker A: The fact that they, two days after a bunch of rumored tweets publicly announced unwinding of their russian operations, for me, looked like admission of guilt. That was a bad look. They probably should have timed the PR on that a little bit better. But I think the important thing is anybody listening here, if you have your money on finance and you don't have a hardware wallet, you don't belong in the space. Get out, shut it down, sell it, get it. Like, you can be using binance. There's a lot of cool tools there, and it's an interesting product.
00:33:27.178 - 00:33:42.294, Speaker A: But if you're storing your funds capital, your LP's capital on binance in this moment, considering the range of rumors circulating, I would question the competency of that. Yeah, I would question negatively. Again, that's. That's prep, right?
00:33:42.594 - 00:34:11.082, Speaker C: I mean, I totally agree with you. Like, I think that you just. It's like, you don't want to be a turkey, a talent turkey. Like, if there's a remote, if there's a greater than x percent, if there's a great thing that someone said while FTX was going down, says, if there's a rumor, act quickly, then think. And acting quickly here is not selling everything. It's just there's an alternative. Get a hardware wallet, store it there, and then figure out how all these things shape out.
00:34:11.082 - 00:34:37.073, Speaker C: Like, you know what I mean? Like, the risk is just asymmetric, and it is. You never want to do anything that puts you out of business. Storing everything, all your crypto, and any exchange, or any single hardware wallet is. Is negligent. Like, you have the Horcrux model. As a fan of Harry Potter, that I am segregated into hundreds of wallets. It doesn't cost anything to set up a safe, like a nosis safe.
00:34:37.073 - 00:34:43.715, Speaker C: Multi sig sign. Two out of three. It's free, folks. Now go get a ledger at $70.
00:34:43.889 - 00:35:58.066, Speaker A: A last item that I would say on this is, I would say Travis Tweetstorm or, you know, bullet points along with, you know, a bunch of other people who, who got really, really badly hurt. And the FTX debacle could possibly show a glimpse into what american politicians are thinking. You see all these people wanting to point at binance and hurt binance. I would guess the hundreds of politicians that, that took money from sandbank Graffreed probably told him in their last conversation, don't worry, CZ is going down too. And it feels like there's a vendetta that anybody who is really badly hurt in that FTX fiasco in some way, shape or form blames binance. And he is just, you know, CZ at this point has just made too many enemies with the brazen, very aggressive, some would say arrogant approach that he took in the days following the FTX collapse. And so it would not surprise me if behind closed doors in America, and I don't have any privileged information on this, I'm just speculating.
00:35:58.066 - 00:36:06.054, Speaker A: But it would not surprise me if high level politicians are looking at this from a vendetta perspective, especially those in the Democrat side of the aisle.
00:36:06.774 - 00:36:39.138, Speaker C: Tommy, you obviously are really close. You've talked, you've interviewed Travis, and I'm curious what you think in terms of the outcome here. There will be some enforcement action. There's just a body of evidence. What I've seen is there probably was some wrongdoing, particularly because the rules are not set in place. So when the rules are not set, then they can, you know, it's difficult, you know, but there are some things that I think are pretty damning in that DOJ. Like when the DOJ brings an action against you, it's different than the SEC.
00:36:39.138 - 00:36:44.434, Speaker C: Like the DOJ. The DOJ action is far meatier.
00:36:44.594 - 00:36:46.450, Speaker B: And you don't fuck with RDOJ.
00:36:46.602 - 00:37:12.046, Speaker C: Yeah, like when the DOJ comes to you and knocking on the doors because they have a body of evidence, it's not like, hey, we're probing, we want information. It's like, no, we know you're doing some wrong. Like, just, there's an action. So my point to you is, do you think it's a settlement? A huge, huge fine? Does that put binance at risk of insolvency? Ryan, maybe that's your point. Maybe that's a way to take them down. Or do they. I mean, they're already out of the US pretty much.
00:37:12.046 - 00:37:24.594, Speaker C: I mean, volume is zero. All the execs have left, so they're out of the US mostly. So how do you think about, like the second 3rd order effects here? What's the viability of binance going forward?
00:37:25.464 - 00:37:50.862, Speaker B: I think, Ryan, you might have a better answer than me here. The problem is, I think it's either two extremes. I think it's either and one of the DOJ press release. Not a press release, but on a news report. I think somewhere along the lines, it mentioned that either the DOJ or the SEC was worried about the solvency of finance if they were to issue something that would cause a bankruptcy.
00:37:50.862 - 00:37:51.236, Speaker A: Right?
00:37:51.252 - 00:38:36.524, Speaker B: Which kind of begs the question, like, one, is that report accurate? But two, why would that ever happen? If you have all the assets, then there's no possibility of that happening, right? Because everyone could withdraw. So either they know something that's amiss or they don't. So I think it's either extreme bad case scenario where there is some sort of hole or some sort of fraud, which I really don't understand how there could be. Unless CZ is funneling money out to support BNB price or something like that. Or there's Kyc OFac violations, which I don't know what the penalty for that is in some sort of settlement. And honestly, I think people in the US have a fantastic alternative through Coinbase and Kraken. So I think people will be pretty much okay.
00:38:36.524 - 00:38:48.008, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys saw it today, but Coinbase is on Capitol Hill with little beer cans of cold brew, with crypto, and it's incredible marketing. They're doing all the lobbying. Super legitimate.
00:38:48.056 - 00:38:49.288, Speaker C: Finally going on the offense.
00:38:49.416 - 00:38:55.424, Speaker B: Yeah, they're going on the offense, but they're doing it in a super clean, long term view way, and it's really nice to see.
00:38:55.544 - 00:39:30.122, Speaker A: Yeah. One thing I would say is that the concerns about Binance's solvency are definitely, totally unfounded. Dean will shoot me for saying this, but because we've been analyzing MeV in the space for now, a couple of years, we approximately know how much CZ has made in MeV on his own chain. And it's an ungodly amount of money. It is a staggering sum of capital. So he has. He's well capitalized.
00:39:30.122 - 00:39:32.294, Speaker A: He's fully capable.
00:39:33.714 - 00:39:36.978, Speaker C: Top five bitcoin holders as well, for sure.
00:39:37.026 - 00:39:50.574, Speaker A: I mean, I don't. I don't know that, like, empirically, but we know we've been able to reason through how much money he's made in Mev, and that's only one of his income streams, and it's a lot of money.
00:39:51.794 - 00:39:53.978, Speaker B: Where is he making the Mev from? Right, like, which.
00:39:54.026 - 00:39:54.690, Speaker C: Which chains?
00:39:54.762 - 00:40:54.030, Speaker A: Which operations like binance? They because binance is effectively poa, right? And I would assume that he probably knows a decent number of validators, maybe is validator himself. There's a unique advantage in Mev on finance that somebody in that power position would hold. That's a whole other topic to unpack. I personally would think that the front running your own centralized exchange is maybe not even as egregious as me being your own chain. Me being your own chain is like, what the actual fuck? In my view, and I'm not saying that it's him, but, like, our analytics show that there's certainly a big dog whale in the BSC chain that has made an unfathomable amount of money over the last four years that actually is.
00:40:54.062 - 00:41:04.830, Speaker B: So messed up, because you convince people to come to your chain because of your exchange and your reach, and then you turn around and you Mev, the users that you convinced to bring over.
00:41:04.902 - 00:41:11.794, Speaker A: Like that is, as Dean says, you just cucking them, right? You're just cucking all these users.
00:41:13.534 - 00:41:26.010, Speaker B: Santa, you brought a good. A good third topic idea to discuss kind of things that are flying under the radar a bit. Things that are like, overlooked ck, intense investing. Where do you want to start with there?
00:41:26.142 - 00:41:52.614, Speaker C: Yeah, well, look, I mean, I think it's just general idea. Like, I'm of the mind that, look, irrespective of market cycles, like, you can be in a raging bull and you can find gems. You could be in a raging. Like, you can be in a terrible bear, and you could do terrible investments. Like, there are some rounds right now that are raising a ton of money at pretty high valuations. And I'm a very much ascribed to the view of Howard Marks here. Founder Oaktree says price is really the everything.
00:41:52.614 - 00:42:27.600, Speaker C: And that's where people really miss the mark. Right? You could say, oh, ethereum is like, you know, is the best. You know, it has the most developer mind share. It has all this ecosystem. But what about the price? 42 is different than two than one. It's hard, though, for asset class like crypto to think about, well, how do you value these things? Is it, how do you value a meme and attention versus, you know, at the end? But also there's a ton of data that is produced by these blockchains, which are data rich. So it's very interesting because you could do fundamental analysis, like maker, as an example.
00:42:27.600 - 00:43:02.704, Speaker C: You could do fundamental analysis maker. You'd have done it three years ago and said, wow, they are spitting out cash flow. It's trading at like, sub ten P e, which is distressed. It is an early stage company with a ton of potential. You could argue if you believe in crypto and it is profitable. Like if you were gone down Silicon Valley, say you're rune, you have a pitch deck, and pitch deck doesn't have anything. Instead of control f blockchain and crypto and swap it with fintech, Roon could have gone to Silicon Valley and says, hey, look, we're a five, six year old startup.
00:43:02.704 - 00:43:21.170, Speaker C: We have x amount of users. These are our metrics. Super transparent dashboard. This is a growing number of loans. This is the cash flow that we're getting. We're five, six years into the journey and we're valued at x and we're earning y. Like immediately he would have, that is a unicorn.
00:43:21.170 - 00:43:59.564, Speaker C: Like, just does not exist. Like, like, and so, but of course, you know, we're talking about crypto, so that's, you know, uninvestable. But yeah, crypto markets are behaved really strangely, right? I mean, it's sort of like, can you be patient? Because at the end of the day, I do believe fundamentals show up. And when you think about stuff that will endure the test of time, like legacy, Defi is incredibly interesting to me because these are protocols that have withstood a very adversarial environment. DeFi has been in the bear market, like, relative to ETH. Every DeFi protocol chart looks like crap, and it looked like crap before rates started making any moves. And so the question is, when's that going to turn and if it's going to turn.
00:43:59.564 - 00:44:42.368, Speaker C: And so what are the catalysts? I think you need to understand, like, what is the catalyst? Because if there are no immediate catalysts, just hold ETH candidly, like, like, and that's always a default or go to treasuries in this environment. So a bit of a ramble. I do think that DeFi as a category is overlooked, and I think it's here to stay. I think it has a lot of staying power. And also, Lindy, to then the question really is, what's the metric here? What's the catalyst? TVL is it going to be another l two? Is it going to be another flavor of stable coins? What is it going to take for DeFi to come back in the limelight? And I don't really know what are.
00:44:42.376 - 00:45:16.046, Speaker A: The metrics that you're using to drive signal on that? Like something that we talk about is TVL to FTV. But is FTV the correct metric? Or is it like five year token inflation divided or multiplied by value? How are you looking through metrics? That drive in a, in a Howard marks sort of school of thought, having these key metrics that drive indicators of value. Taking a value investing approach to crypto.
00:45:16.070 - 00:45:52.106, Speaker C: For the first time. That's a great question. Tommy, I don't know if you want to jump in here, but for instance, I'll start with things that I've seen investors do probably wrong. And we're talking about fully diluted versus circulating. I think just looking at one or the other or the two is a bit misleading at times. I think you need to understand what the emission schedule looks like and it's fairly common. Probably look at what is one like emissions year, one year out, two year out, three years out, ten years out, five years out.
00:45:52.106 - 00:46:28.836, Speaker C: And then think about, okay, one of them might have like an emissions curve that looks like that, that which is in five years you're going to be reaching your total circulating supply. That has a lot of pressure in the market. Those tokens coming live. Maybe investors are unlocking and there's sell pressure. Might be a good opportunity to then time when you're going to want to build a position if you know people can unlock. The other times you could have dynamic emission schedules like you're intimately familiar with Filecoin that are based on some sort of parameters. As the network grows, more tokens get emitted, which it makes sense, and it's up to 100 years or 40 years out at that point.
00:46:28.836 - 00:46:51.196, Speaker C: You don't want to be looking at fully diluted. You're better off understanding the emission curve in isolation. You could look at Fileco and when launch and the token hit a price where you're like, oh, this is like 0.3% of all world's GDP. That's crazy. In reality, very little tokens there in circulation. That's a big mistake I think.
00:46:51.196 - 00:47:47.464, Speaker C: And the other really is you need to understand the type of business model, an exchange like uniswap, completely different than a money market like compound and aave and maker. Totally different metrics. On the money market side, what's the most important thing? How many loans are being emitted? What's the average duration of the loan? Because the protocol earns fees on that TVL directionally is very important. You want to see that number grow. You also want to see the turnover of those loans and the retention of the user. Say, what's the average for the user that is opening up a loan compound? Is he also using AaVE and maker? And what is that wallet share? If he has $100 of loans outstanding or supplying certain assets, how is that distributed? Across all the money markets for an exchange, TVL is not really relevant at all. It's really the utilization.
00:47:47.464 - 00:48:26.424, Speaker C: If you compare Uniswap to practically every other amm out there, Uniswap is like orders of magnitude more efficient with that capital, meaning the turnover of that. There's liquidity pools and the trading volume of that. Like if you have a $100 in sort of the liquidity pool, how much of that gets traded on a daily, weekly, monthly basis is vastly superior to any other amm out there. And so that's really, in my mind, the most important metric. Right. And so ultimately a combination of things. I don't want to stop here, but then you can look at all the on chain analytics of maker.
00:48:26.424 - 00:49:12.054, Speaker C: For instance, like the popular trade, when you saw for selling, you saw like one of some of the largest holders on chain moving the coins to an exchange to liquidate. It's super interesting because you can do fundamental analysis. You also need to have a bet on how big these markets are going to be and in what timeframe is it going to outperform the underlying benchmark ETH, bitcoin, treasuries? And then also understand what are other large holders doing in this asset class. You guys have been around for a while, but you're like VC, but you also can be a hedge fund analyst and high frequency trader, if you can, and I don't. It's just intellectually super stimulating to kind of be able to do all of that.
00:49:12.514 - 00:51:12.750, Speaker A: Yeah, it kind of comes together in this sort of emerging idea that I think we're all playing around with, and a whole bunch of people are circling around in the space right now of this idea of liquid venture, right. That the investment principles have venture like components to it? Do we believe in the team behind it? Do we believe in really uncommon value that this can unlock? But because crypto is liquid, effectively from the series A, to compare it to traditional venture, you can take a better risk adjusted approach, where, again, you can take some capital off the table or dial back into something when it's getting to a point where purely on a PE basis, it's making sense. And that's really the, that's one of the driving forces that I think we spend every day asking ourselves and early stage products outside of just core ETH, is what is the cash flow the thing is throwing off? And then do they have the courage to accrue the cash flow to the token holders? So, for example, like a DyDX throws off really, really great cash. It's trading at a 6.5 times earnings, but they don't have, for one reason or another, they have not decided to accrue that value to the token holders. That, combined with your previous point of massive jumps in inflation view overnight, I think we're like two months out from just a huge inflation spike has left that from an outside perspective, most people would say undervalued something, trading at 6.5 times free cash flow with all the volume that it has, all the great developers it has, and Tony is a phenomenal CEO, so on and so forth.
00:51:12.750 - 00:52:09.748, Speaker A: But then there are these other, these other inputs that you have to consider, like, hey, there's about to be a massive spike and so on and so forth. But I think it's just really, you know, I'm really excited about the moment at hand to be able to finally bring value investing principles to crypto that it's not just like pie in the sky, you know, if it could be some percentage of the total value of gold, then it's worth, you know, 100 billion, trillion dollars. That we can now actually look at these things from a cash flow perspective. And maker is a great example of one of the first things you could look at from a cashflow perspective. And Defi, I think in a year or two, maybe three tops, all D five will be priced based on cash flows. Once we're able to actually accrue the value to the token holders and we can get away from this, like, oh, it's not a security, then it'll just be priced on cash flows.
00:52:09.886 - 00:53:02.736, Speaker C: Tommy, let me ask you a question on this point, because this is something that gets commonly debated, like sushi versus uni. One was distributing the earnings back to stakeholders, like people that were staking sushi. Uni is not. It could be voted in, but it's not. For better or for worse, the regulatory environment and lack of clarity has handicapped our ability to design token structures that make sense. These protocols spit out cash, but there's also this kind of debate, what do you do with that cash? Like, it's very uncommon for an early stage venture project to be spinning out cash. And the question is, should you reinvest that in the business? What does that reinvesting actually mean as a protocol? What is that DyDx and Uniswap doing with our treasury, that admin contract? Or do you distribute it back to stakeholders if and when you have clarity? I don't know what the right answer is.
00:53:02.736 - 00:53:07.776, Speaker C: I think it depends, but I'm curious to get your thoughts on that, and it factors into your investment decisions.
00:53:07.920 - 00:53:29.774, Speaker A: Just to build on that for you, Tommy, how do you look at it when in the case of, say, DyDX and a uniswap, they've done massive, successive rounds of equity raises and token raises, and they have two sets of constituents who, by the way, are not the same people and how do they like. Is it a regular stuff?
00:53:30.074 - 00:53:31.370, Speaker C: Sometimes there's not. Yeah.
00:53:31.482 - 00:53:35.378, Speaker A: Yeah. Or is it just a question of what constituent they're trying to appease?
00:53:35.506 - 00:53:46.138, Speaker B: Right, yeah. Disclosure. We're investors in Dy DX. And I just had Antonio on the podcast this week, and it's ridiculous. They've done a trillion dollars in volume.
00:53:46.226 - 00:53:46.474, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:46.514 - 00:53:57.424, Speaker B: Like, it's crazy. And his confidence. Yeah. Since inception. And his confidence as a founder is. Is hard to beat. He is really dedicated and just really dialed in.
00:53:57.424 - 00:54:41.112, Speaker B: As for the value flows, I think Sushi added the fee as a differentiator versus uniswap during the vampire attack. Just something that they can do differently that Uniswap didn't have. So I'm not sure if we could make a long term view of that. I also think DyDX is moving to a Cosmos chain, for obvious reasons, to control their stack, and they have a use case where they need to do that and edit a lot of the technicals. But I also think it's pretty clearly an unspoken regulatory reason, like, let's drive actual value to the token, because you'll need it for nodes, you'll need it for other reasons, and it's easier to. For the community to make changes. As for the breakup between equity and tokens, Ryan, to answer your question, I don't think there's any good way to do it.
00:54:41.112 - 00:54:59.532, Speaker B: I think it has to be hotly debated and somewhat decided before you make the investment. Right. Because if you're going to invest in a $25 million token that has an equity component and 50% of the value is flowing to the equity, you're not investing at 25 mil in the token, you're investing at 50 mil in the token. I think in my mind, or even.
00:54:59.548 - 00:55:01.996, Speaker C: More, there's usually a two to one relationship, right?
00:55:02.140 - 00:55:18.272, Speaker B: Two to one. But that makes it even worse, because now if you're two to one, you're 25 mil equity, 50 mil token, and now half the value flow flowing to the equity. Now you're at 100 million, the token, in my mind, on the value. So it gets even worse there. We're running low on time, guys. What should we pivot to for our last topic?
00:55:18.328 - 00:55:25.168, Speaker C: Well, Tommy, you. You've been under, uh, in terms of the audio. Ryan and I have been talking a lot. I know you want to talk.
00:55:25.176 - 00:55:25.844, Speaker B: It's good.
00:55:26.264 - 00:55:43.810, Speaker C: No? Well, yeah, but you have a lot. I'd love for you to share your thoughts on zero knowledge proofs, because this is a topic going back to the opening that was. It is hot. In these conferences, you have multiple different flavors. As far as I can remember. Zero knowledge proofs have been like one of the holy grails of crypto. It offers so much potential.
00:55:43.810 - 00:56:15.354, Speaker C: It's been slow, though, and this might be one of the things that gets overlooked, like the amount of progress that is now being made in an exponential manner. And these unlocks, in terms of the tech, the cost, viability of it. I think it's come a long way, and it's something that perhaps crypto as a whole is a bit skeptic. Like, if you've been around for 70 years, like, don't talk to me about homomorphic encryption. Zero knowledge proves. And, you know, there's other categories, right. That just are, you know, feels like folks are fatigued, but let's talk about that, and why don't you give us your take?
00:56:15.814 - 00:56:34.074, Speaker A: Yeah, why don't you run through that for us, Tommy, with the. With the sort of lens of explain to people why zero knowledge, which has not had commercial success in the space, and crude value, why is that changing now?
00:56:34.644 - 00:57:14.230, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. I'll preface it with, I'm not a developer or ZK coder. There's only a couple in the world that actually really understand the math at play here, like the ellies of Starcourse of the world. But the way that I've. My mental model for ZK is that it is the end game technology for scalability and privacy. Being able to use math in a way where you can do massive amounts of transactions and or privacy and have privacy and roll that down to an l one or a settlement layer without any guesses to its accuracy. It's all proven through math, which is different from optimistic roll ups where you have to hope and you do a fraud.
00:57:14.230 - 00:57:50.092, Speaker B: Proof, if not, is pretty much the end game for me. I think. I think it is for everybody. The way I'm breaking it down is into three buckets. You have ZKE evms, zkvms and full fledged standalone layer one ZK blockchains. A Zke EvM is something that's very compatible with Ethereum. You have the polygons of the world scrolls, lineas through consensys, Zksync, Kakarot, those that work directly with the EVM, it's easy to bring users, easy to bring liquidity, and you could work with it, but you're limited.
00:57:50.092 - 00:58:18.378, Speaker B: You can't do as much because you're limited by the EVM. Things like that. Then you have things like zkvms, things that are purpose built for proving proofs, like starkware, the stuff that's 100 to 1000 times more efficient at proving proof since the language is purpose built for doing that. You don't have the constraints of the EVM. That's like Aztec for privacy or starkware for scalability. And you can do that. Then you have layer one standalone blockchains like Leo and Mina and things like that.
00:58:18.378 - 00:58:56.346, Speaker B: You lose all the liquidity users in the ecosystem of ethereum, but you could do hopefully much more unique things. So that's the breakdown where I'm at right now. And I'm really struggling to figure out why most Alt L1 chains will survive the wrath of the best magic math in the world with the best ecosystem in the world being ethereum right now. Obviously I love the solanas of the world. Like that's the best bet on a, the fastest shared global state, bar none. That's the goal. But yeah, I'm struggling with how alt ecosystems will survive.
00:58:56.346 - 00:59:02.174, Speaker B: As Ek tech comes in line. And we're a venture fund, we have to invest two to five years out. So it's tough to not get around that.
00:59:02.674 - 00:59:47.202, Speaker C: Look, I think it's a great point. Let me ask you a question. Say that one of these deeply research based startups unlocks something huge in the zero knowledge space. What is stopping an existing l two to fork that and deploy it? Because they have the distribution skill. And like, look, when I, when I invested in scroll, it was like, you know, they were the pioneers really, in ZKVM and, and then I. But I'm also an investor in like arbitrum. And I would have guessed like, you know, I'm talking here, but if I'm in the arbitrum camp, I'm saying, okay, I've already raised all this money.
00:59:47.202 - 01:00:33.276, Speaker C: I clearly believe optimistic roll ups are in the near to medium term, really viable to fill a lot of the demand, and that's good enough. And if for whatever reason, a team like scroll or someone else really develops something that can unlock, like at one point you're going to reach a limitation in terms of optimistic world capacity. Right. Maybe ZK tech allows for the next wave, but maybe that's 710 years out. What's stopping arbitrum from just using that tech and integrating it, and they have the distribution. The question really is how you think about the moat here. If someone develops something, gets forked and gets implemented, and optimism could just deploy their own.
01:00:33.276 - 01:00:36.428, Speaker C: Right? Like, I'm just kind of curious.
01:00:36.596 - 01:00:55.084, Speaker B: No, it's a good question. I don't. I don't have a great answer on the optimistic side. I actually have Steven and Ed from arbitrum coming on the pod next week to discuss the counter view. But the thing that I. I kind of laugh at is, and this is like an irrational take on my part, but, you know, we're human. We're allowed to have two sets of beliefs here.
01:00:55.084 - 01:01:24.566, Speaker B: I love things like base, because you have the. You have the might of Coinbase, 150 billion in liquidity and 100 million users, and you have zero fraud proofs. You're optimistic. You don't even have fraud proofs, but then you have something like ZK with the starkware, where you don't even need those things because everything is always proven by math. It is a weird dichotomy. As for, can other projects copy ZK tech? Sure, I think they can. But two things.
01:01:24.566 - 01:01:36.118, Speaker B: I think, one, after you build an ecosystem, it's hard to. I don't think it's easy to copy ZK. It's really, really, really hard math and code, and I don't think people in.
01:01:36.126 - 01:01:37.470, Speaker C: The world can do this stuff.
01:01:37.622 - 01:01:46.742, Speaker B: Yeah. So copying it'll be really, really hard. And honestly, I think eventually the tech will commoditize to what Ryan said earlier on other things.
01:01:46.798 - 01:01:47.014, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:47.054 - 01:01:55.022, Speaker B: And eventually it'll just become a biz dev game and a community game. And whoever wins that is going to have already started, I mean, play sort.
01:01:55.038 - 01:02:00.110, Speaker C: Of polygon or what are they rebrand? Who's, like, already kind of executed on the strategy.
01:02:00.142 - 01:02:00.286, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:00.310 - 01:02:01.554, Speaker C: They acquired Hermes.
01:02:02.734 - 01:02:18.346, Speaker A: Like, what is Jordy's actually. Yeah, Jordy's in our office and. And one of those ten. You know, one of those ten people that can. That can actually do this, you know, but that's a really interesting thing. I look at this example really closely because. Because.
01:02:18.346 - 01:03:21.774, Speaker A: Because we share an office with Jordy, and the tech is very impressive. And I think this is true broadly of a number of things with Polygon. But I would guess that they're disappointed in the amount of users and traction that the network has today, which causes me as an investor in this to question, like, is it that people don't care about it right now because it's got, like, literally, you know, single digit thousands transactions per day on the CKBM and or is it just that, like, we haven't hit the knee of the curve and it's coming because, you know, some catalyst will bring it and then what is that catalyst? And that's. That's a question I suppose I have have for both of you. Is that, is it a UI thing? Is it a. People don't actually care about privacy in the current context? Or is it something else that has caused things like Zkevm to not have the traction that we all expected and hoped for?
01:03:23.474 - 01:04:04.790, Speaker C: That's a loaded question, my friend. And I think I always go back to the example of what happened with binance chain when it launched Pancakeswap in the first month, acquired more users and was seeing more transactions than uniswap at that moment in time. You would have said and looked at that, yeah, no one really cares about security. People are just chasing the next farm. And this is when DeFi was kind of hot. But now the staying power, you got to look at these not in isolation on a three month window, but like over multiple years. At the end of day, everyone that is in crypto today is a beta tester, beta user.
01:04:04.790 - 01:04:36.070, Speaker C: Given the level of risks and the number of users, like, it's a very small crowd that uses these things. I think I wouldn't take too much stock that it doesn't care. I do think that the best tech will win, not just the best marketer for this type of technology. Like when things break in crypto, it's not like when things break in web two. Like it is fundamentally, like, you don't mess around with crypto, you know what I mean? Like there's no one to call, there's no 1800 number. You can't peel back stuff. And if you do like it compromises trust.
01:04:36.070 - 01:05:48.084, Speaker C: Like ultimately you want to be building crypto products because security is the most important thing. Security is a very broad, and I think it can encompass many things and is different for folks. But fundamentally, there's a reason why Ethereum is Ethereum where it is today, and bitcoin, and there's this idea of Lindy effect. And I ultimately think that, like when you do hit and there's a killer game, there's a killer application which we haven't really seen yet, then you have to think about, well, what's that flow going to be? Where's that wallet? Where's that exchange or aggregator, if you will. That might come from Web two, right? Because the retail demand is going to come and they're going to go through an aggregator, I think. And ultimately that aggregator will, whether it's PayPal, visa, whoever it is, JPMorgan will fundamentally care about security and understand it well. And that's where I think they will evaluate these l two s that will evaluate these l one s and say, yeah, we're going to make the decision to push our users to this particular chain because it's the most secure and security begets liquidity, and that increases security, I think.
01:05:48.084 - 01:05:58.084, Speaker C: And so it's that flywheel that Ethereum is on, maybe Solana, that it will be hard to overlook if you're not as secure as another l two.
01:05:58.504 - 01:06:53.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that framing. Ryan, just to go back to your question originally, why hasn't this stuff really taken off? I just had Ellie from Starkware on the podcast this week and spoke to him, or last week, and one of the things that I thought was super interesting that he brought up was I asked him the question point blank. I said, how do you as a Zkvm, compete with a zke vm, like a polygon or something? Because they have easy to port apps, users, they have liquidity. It's a pretty straightforward question on competition. He said, look, it's going to be hard, but you just cannot build the stuff that you can on a ZKe EVM, that you can with the flexibility, the low cost, the speed and the customizability of what we're doing with Cairo and with ZKvMs, honestly, it made a lot of sense. But it also pointed to your question on timelines. Why hasn't this stuff taken off? I think it's just really early for really hard tech.
01:06:53.240 - 01:07:04.724, Speaker B: Right? We've just started to get Mainnet's launch. We just started to get languages solidified. I think that the arc of technology is in the ZK favor, but I do think it's quite early.
01:07:05.024 - 01:08:06.716, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right. I mean, ZkVM only came out in February, or, sorry, in March on Polygon. And so it's far too, far too early to judge. I would, you know, I would challenge the starkware guys a on the computational density of the stark proof, and it remains, you know, it will create quite, quite the blockchain bloat in its current format. But there are smart guys, and hopefully they continue to work on it. And then what is this magical thing that you can't do on Ethereum and Polygon that you can magically do on these other things? Like, is there a hard example of something? Because the more and more we look out across the space, the more I think we all see the aggregation of mine share and probably over time, of capital consolidating around the ETH and the ETH L2 ecosystems. Right.
01:08:06.716 - 01:08:23.384, Speaker A: And that's why I continue to be a really strong believer in Polygon. Because even though GKE VM doesn't have traction, it's really like, once we hit me in the curve on that use case, it's probably Polygon that's. That's in the pole position. But I don't know.
01:08:24.804 - 01:09:01.534, Speaker C: I think it's an interesting thing for listeners to just go home and just comment, you know, feel free to comment on how you think and whether it's marketing or tech that will prevail. I think it's quite early. I think we can all agree on that. There's so many risks, and so I think you also have to think about, are you being compensated well enough to take this level risk? Certainly, you know, a yield of sub 5% on DeFi ain't gonna cut it, folks, because you can just park it in treasuries. But look, I think it's been a fantastic episode. We'll leave it there. I think that we've obviously identified a thing of in the bear market, things are overlooked more so probably than.
01:09:01.534 - 01:09:39.865, Speaker C: Well, generally speaking, markets overlook things. They're not efficient, certainly not in an early stage as crypto. There's so many things that we can continue to talk about. So in the next episode, I would love to just go deeper on things that we think are being overlooked, because I'm of the mind that you can find fantastic opportunities in any market cycle, in any market environment. And it's quite early asset class. And so I think there's so many good things here. Just retail has access to these incredibly young startups, not all of which are good, but the fascinating thing here is data is produced in real time, and you have so many tools at your disposal and so many people.
01:09:39.865 - 01:09:55.596, Speaker C: A lot of it is open source, so you can learn about this stuff not just with podcasts, but just going on chain and using tools and analytics. So it's just an incredibly exciting asset class. Why don't we just leave it there, folks? There's always a great discussion. Tommy and Ryan, awesome time, guys.
01:09:55.660 - 01:09:56.004, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
