00:00:00.320 - 00:00:40.354, Speaker A: All of a sudden we've equated knowledgeability to wealth, which, by the way, I met really rich, dumb people and really smart people that haven't made money because they're early in their career for whatever reason. And the fact that we've just set this arbitrary standard in the US of who can invest in these things or not, and we've excluded the vast majority of the population from these type of opportunities is ridiculous. It really is. The amount of wealth creation that has happened in the private markets is astounding, and only very few people have been able to participate. Oh, and then you wonder why inequality is on the rise in the US since the global financial crisis. Like, well, guys, like, update the goddamn rules.
00:00:42.334 - 00:01:24.124, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about Chronicle later in the show. This episode is brought to you by Toku. If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token, are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards, or are just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team. From easy to use token grant award templates, through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings, make it simple today with Toku.
00:01:26.644 - 00:01:38.924, Speaker A: I know there's so much variety, but like, I usually gravitated to Granny Smith apples, and I love Granny Smith apples. But now I've like, tested and expanded my horizons. I've landed on pink lady.
00:01:39.084 - 00:01:40.156, Speaker B: Pink ladies.
00:01:40.340 - 00:01:40.988, Speaker A: Really nice.
00:01:41.036 - 00:01:42.184, Speaker B: That's fitting for you.
00:01:42.724 - 00:01:45.384, Speaker A: What do you mean it's fitting for me? What does that even mean?
00:01:46.084 - 00:01:49.932, Speaker B: That's how I know you're bored is when you're testing apples, folks.
00:01:50.028 - 00:01:59.764, Speaker A: I was like three days sitting in Berlin, like, trying to not be, have anxiety over running this marathon. I was sick and so I was like, all right, maybe I'll get, you know, ten apples a day cures.
00:01:59.804 - 00:02:04.332, Speaker B: Like, tell us about the marathon. So you ran the Berlin fantastic, fantastic event.
00:02:04.468 - 00:02:18.840, Speaker A: I was so people who, I remember when we recorded the podcast last Thursday, I was feeling sick. I woke up on Friday, had fever. I'm like, oh boy. And my flight was like super early. So I'm like, I might as well just go. Like, everything's paid for. So I get on this plane, I don't even know if I'm going to run.
00:02:18.840 - 00:02:39.872, Speaker A: And it was just really nice. Like, I recovered surprisingly well, not 100%. I still, like, had you know, I'm still sick because it's going around, but I ran it third best time I might. I missed my pr by a minute and 56 seconds or around 142. 40. 915, 2 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds. My fastest with London earlier this year.
00:02:39.872 - 00:02:56.622, Speaker A: And, yeah, man, it was fantastic. The course is amazing. It's one of the flattest, I think the flattest of the six majors. There's six major marathons. It's New York, Chicago, Boston, Tokyo, Berlin. And which one?
00:02:56.758 - 00:03:12.416, Speaker B: Anyways, you're at 249. So 249 is. So that's 169 minutes. There's about 26 miles. In a 26 miles. 169 divided by 26 is six and a half. You're in a six and a half minute mile.
00:03:12.416 - 00:03:13.944, Speaker B: Yes. 26 miles.
00:03:14.104 - 00:03:36.908, Speaker A: Yeah. And the nice thing about how I did it, like, it was not my best time, it was the best execution because I ran a negative split, which means every incremental ten k, I ran faster. Like, I increased the pace and I feeling super strong, but I went in with zero expectation. I'm like, I just want to break sub three, which is considered pretty good time, and I did really well. So now I'm going to do New York in a month. I'm going to see you out there.
00:03:36.976 - 00:03:40.076, Speaker B: So, yeah. How long do you train for a marathon like that?
00:03:40.260 - 00:03:58.764, Speaker A: Yeah, so that was the other thing. I got injured after London in April, and I didn't run. I counted the runs that I had on Strava. Sick ten runs. I cycled. Most, like, 99% of my training was in the bike. And of course, like, the aerobic capacity, like, my heart rate was much lower in this marathon than the other one is just like zone two training.
00:03:58.764 - 00:04:34.568, Speaker A: For anyone that cares about this stuff, like, there's just the incredible amount of zone two training you can do, and that set me up really well. But my biggest fear was, like, your condition doesn't translate from the bike to the run one to one, because you're using different type of muscle groups and recruiting different types of, like, fast switch load. Anyways, not to get too into the weeds, but it was like, a big unknown for me how I would respond to a marathon. I know I can run it. I just didn't think that I would be able to run it as fast as that, um, because I hadn't trained virtually anything. So now I know it's great because the bike is super low impact, right. You can go on 100 miles bike ride and then do it again the next day.
00:04:34.568 - 00:04:53.684, Speaker A: You cannot do two marathon. I mean, the amount of impact that it has on your joints and your body is like, it takes a week to recover. Some people take more than more than a week. So, yeah, this is something that I love. I just get so much, like, the crowd, the people running. It's incredible, man. These things are just, there's like 30, 40,000 runners.
00:04:53.684 - 00:05:21.164, Speaker A: What made the last one say, what made it so important this time around is the. The world record was beat by the female. Like, the women's time was beat 211, which is crazy. Three minutes less than the world record. And then Kipchoge, which is this guy from Kenya, he had broken the world record, like, 201. And it's always been this idea of like, can someone run a marathon sub 2 hours in a sanctioned race? And he did not break it. But everyone was speculating that he would this year.
00:05:21.164 - 00:05:30.526, Speaker A: So, you know, it will be broken. Um, in the next year or two, I think someone will run a sanctioned race sub 2 hours, which is insane.
00:05:30.630 - 00:05:36.422, Speaker B: Crazy, man. Crazy. I love that there are these records that people just think are unbreakable. And then, yeah, they always get broken.
00:05:36.518 - 00:05:47.806, Speaker A: You know, it really is just amazing to see that, like, you know, how we set ourselves and we break these artificial barriers. But it's crazy what the human body can do.
00:05:47.910 - 00:05:52.796, Speaker B: Yeah, the four minute mile. Everyone thought that was an impossible human feat. And then Roger bannister.
00:05:52.940 - 00:05:53.820, Speaker A: There we go.
00:05:53.972 - 00:05:58.624, Speaker B: Yeah, um, we got some, we got some. Housekeeping. First off, you get a haircut.
00:05:59.164 - 00:06:01.264, Speaker A: No, I can't. I don't.
00:06:02.044 - 00:06:07.744, Speaker B: Thought you got a haircut. No, that's the housekeeping pot over pod done.
00:06:08.164 - 00:06:08.732, Speaker A: Speaking.
00:06:08.828 - 00:06:09.316, Speaker B: No, no, no.
00:06:09.340 - 00:06:33.852, Speaker A: No haircuts, folks. Yano needs to shave his head. And I will, I will stop. I will stop coming. I will stop coming and showing up until Yano commits to shaving his head. You decide when, man, you know, like, you're going to be in holiday pictures. Like, your hair can grow back if you shave, like in the next episode, but if you wait further, like, you're going to have Thanksgiving and Christmas as a ball.
00:06:33.852 - 00:06:36.212, Speaker A: Like, if I were you, I would.
00:06:36.228 - 00:06:51.074, Speaker B: Like, do a pretty shave to Das London. So blockworks announced this week that we are moving Das to Das London. The original for anyone who's been following. So we have. Blockworks has two conference brands. One is permissionless. Permissionless is like our huge event that we had a couple of weeks ago.
00:06:51.074 - 00:07:06.878, Speaker B: Das is our institutional buttoned up crypto conference. It's probably the only crypto event. People are still wearing a suit and a tie. We've hosted it. It's the first big conference we ever hosted back in 2019. We've hosted seven digital asset summits in the past. This will be our 8th.
00:07:06.878 - 00:07:48.570, Speaker B: We had the idea several months ago to go to Washington, DC. So that's where Das was originally supposed to be, March 2024. And after conversations with a bunch of the big crypto protocols and companies and funds, we realized that sending a bunch of protocols into the belly of the beast, DC might not be the best idea in a very heated regulatory environment. So we're moving it to London. Super excited about that. I was telling you before we hit record, it's probably one of the best responses we've ever had to a conference. We've got a ton of inbounds, um, from sponsors wanting to sponsor big speakers, some big folks in, like, the UK government tickets already being bought.
00:07:48.570 - 00:08:02.954, Speaker B: So we're super excited about Das London. That is March 18 to 24th next year. Uh, tickets are 499 right now. It's the cheapest we've ever priced Das. Usually they're. It's an institutional conference. Usually they're like a $1,000, sometimes even more.
00:08:02.954 - 00:08:05.338, Speaker B: So tickets will go up soon. That's one announcement.
00:08:05.426 - 00:08:06.668, Speaker A: It's like a one day event.
00:08:06.866 - 00:08:16.560, Speaker B: This is a three day event, actually. Yeah. It's going to be bigger than we've ever had it. So this year there'll be about 1200 people. Nice. Yeah, that's great.
00:08:16.632 - 00:08:35.328, Speaker A: I love London. I mean, I think it's just. What's Sunax like? Has been really vocal about being pro crypto and being an innovation hub. And, yeah, a 16 z opened an office there. There's just so much connectivity between Europe, Asia, the rest of the world there. Like, London is probably second biggest hub after New York financial hub.
00:08:35.456 - 00:08:53.720, Speaker B: Yeah. London has quickly become this, like a very hot crypto hub again. And I think when we talk to a lot of folks on the ground, right, innovation is thriving. You've got some new institutional investors flocking in. You've got regulators like the FC FCA that are taking this pragmatic approach to crypto oversight. You've got the PM. I mean, the PM has welcomed crypto with open arms.
00:08:53.720 - 00:08:55.564, Speaker B: He's getting beers with crypto founders.
00:08:55.864 - 00:09:43.576, Speaker A: You want to hear a crazy story? Yeah. When I was like, this is like, when Cosmos was launching and proof of stake was a thing, and so we at the time was running validators and I wanted to get clarity. This is like, staked and all these companies were popping up, buy some trails, and we want to do our thing. And so we wanted to get clarity on how these things would get treated from a taxation perspective, like, the proof of stake lines, is something that I helped create with Evan, who ended up, like, just joining bison trails. And, like, trying to get how tax, like, clarity from the IR's, how, like, staking wars would be treated in the US. So that was good initiative that came out of that. But we also wanted to get a clarity on, like, how do you run a validator? And, like, is it, like money transmission? Like, if someone delegates to your validator in cosmos or in tazos? It's quite different.
00:09:43.576 - 00:10:05.716, Speaker A: So we just wanted to get clarity. So we reached out to the SEC, wanted to get a meeting with them. We actually ended up going meeting with them in San Francisco. And the cryptos are shows up. It was, like, a pretty fascinating, at least understanding for me, of how, at the time, there was this idea that the regulators didn't know much about crypto, needed education. That was not the case. Meaning they were very knowledgeable, and they knew all the different players.
00:10:05.716 - 00:10:25.284, Speaker A: They knew the nuances between. So that was, like, a pretty interesting experience. But it took. It took a couple of months to get a meeting, and we didn't get clarity. Needless to say, we were in London at the time. We requested a meeting with the FCA. We got it, like, within, like, that same week.
00:10:25.284 - 00:10:42.860, Speaker A: And to me, it was. It was impressive. You know, it was. This was back in 2000, 819, and it was. It was like a stark difference in the level of, hey, we want to welcome you. I know you have questions. And they gave us clarity, actually, very quickly.
00:10:42.860 - 00:11:03.064, Speaker A: So it was fine. But you run a validator. And I was like, what this is, it's just a very different tone and posture towards just. We were trying to do the right thing. We just try to get. We want to understand if we could run a business, and if we couldn't run a business, then it was fine. We just, like, we can change stuff, and if we can't change it, then, well, you know, at least we know.
00:11:03.064 - 00:11:20.156, Speaker A: And it was very refreshing, actually. And I've heard the same from, like, you know, Avi was based there, and I was doing a lot of work with them at the time. And, you know, Rebecca was on the regulatory politics. You know, they all, I think, unequivocally, so many people have been. Have had very positive interactions with the regulators out there.
00:11:20.260 - 00:11:26.860, Speaker B: Yeah, we all agreed. So we're excited about London. What were you doing, by the way? Were you running the staking?
00:11:27.012 - 00:11:31.572, Speaker A: Yeah, staking as a service called the. I did it with a few folks.
00:11:31.668 - 00:11:40.256, Speaker B: Was this because you have this gap on like your proverbial resume after Elysium, before parafi. What did you do in 2019? Was that what you were doing?
00:11:40.420 - 00:12:06.004, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So I had a huge, you know, I had a position in these protocols, and so I was like, oh, so how am I gonna, you know, I want to, I want to stake, because staking is so important not just to get the. It's to secure the network. Right. And I didn't feel comfortable using solutions out there that I didn't understand, I didn't know. And so I said, well, I might as well just build it. And that sentiment was shared by the team that we recruited.
00:12:06.004 - 00:12:41.014, Speaker A: And so we were a team of five. We knew each other for just being in crypto for a long time. And we set out to build, effectively, a staking as a service company for ourselves, first and foremost. And then friends and other people reached out, say, hey, we said, okay, let's see if we can productize it. There's so many learnings from there. We ended up shutting it down. But of course, like, there was other, like, staked end up and buy some trails and so many others, like, you know, ended up having great success.
00:12:41.014 - 00:13:12.784, Speaker A: The probably the best thing to come out of that was understanding how sticky, like, user behavior was in crypto. Like, if you were not the first validator in the set, good luck trying to, like, like, acquire users. Once they delegate, they don't want to switch validator. Even if you went out with lower fees, they don't care. And that was learning for me in tezos of how hard it was to recruit and get delegations. Of course, there's a huge lucrative model. We're just too early.
00:13:12.784 - 00:13:43.776, Speaker A: I will send you a link. There's a post in my substac that talked about how I thought all the different products, derivatives, and we still haven't seen much of it. I guess the other thing that came out of it that gave me a lot of conviction to invest in Lido because the guys that started Lido had the best. They would win these, like, competitions of like game of stakes or cosmos, and they, they were, just ran the best. They had the best team, technically. I think they were the best or one of the best. And so I knew them from, from that experience, and they always kicked our ass.
00:13:43.776 - 00:14:05.298, Speaker A: I was like, oh, you know, this is a team that I want to back and they're technically competent and lighter. Ended up being one of the best investments. So. But yeah, there's, I think we've, now that the ethereum's online and you have proof of stake the markets has grown so much. And that stream of income is fantastic. I mean, then you can. You can do so many different derivative products.
00:14:05.298 - 00:14:23.570, Speaker A: I mean, we talked about it at permissionless, right, at that dinner. There is still so much that you can build upon on this, like, stream of income that you get from. From validating. Um, and. And I think this can be really exciting. I think we lied. It was a great case study.
00:14:23.570 - 00:14:32.082, Speaker A: Obviously staked as was acquired. Bison trail was acquired. And so, um, these are really. They just spit out incredible cash flow.
00:14:32.178 - 00:14:41.266, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Um. Uh, what do you want to talk about? This week, there was Coinbase. Coinbase. I think there's two things with Coinbase. They had this marketing campaign in DC.
00:14:41.266 - 00:14:57.406, Speaker B: They brought a lot of folks to DC for stand with crypto. There was also coinbase launched perps. Right. They launched, uh, uh, re. They got regulatory approval to enable retail perps futures trading. Um, so that's pretty exciting. There's pudgy penguins did this thing in Walmart that was kind of cool.
00:14:57.510 - 00:15:01.278, Speaker A: Switch your camera a little bit so that we can go on. Show us your pudgy.
00:15:01.326 - 00:15:06.206, Speaker B: I got my pudgy. I didn't go to Walmart, I will admit, but I got. I got. I got this little guy's low guy.
00:15:06.270 - 00:15:08.622, Speaker A: Is that a pumpkin? Is that like, October themed?
00:15:08.758 - 00:15:17.330, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. Lucas. And Lucas sent more swagger. The block works office. So Luca came. Luca Netz came on the block works on empire.
00:15:17.442 - 00:15:17.946, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:18.050 - 00:15:35.842, Speaker B: And, uh, this is the guy who bought pudgy penguins. He didn't start it, but he bought it, um, back in April of 2022, I think it was. And he came on the podcast. He's like, hey, do you want some swag? I was like, yeah, sure. So he sent. He sent probably, like, six huge boxes of pudgy penguin stuff to the blockworks office. So we're hooked up.
00:15:35.938 - 00:15:41.102, Speaker A: Anyways, uh, you know, I'm not in Brock blockworks office, but, you know, I.
00:15:41.118 - 00:15:47.594, Speaker B: Got one for you. I got. I got another one for you. But, uh, you gotta come to New York. So when you come here next. Next month or.
00:15:48.574 - 00:16:00.754, Speaker A: That's huge, because, you know, who do you think is buying this stuff in Walmart? I mean, because you can buy it in Amazon, right? You could buy it in other retailers as well. Like, Walmart is not the first retailer. It's just, it has huge distribution.
00:16:01.094 - 00:16:12.394, Speaker B: Yeah, it's cool. I mean, we talked. I've kept in touch with Luca. They. Walmart originally was going to put it on, like, a. Kind of a row, basically. But what they actually got was these.
00:16:12.394 - 00:16:18.082, Speaker B: The most coveted part of the store, which is the front of. I forget there's a word for this. And.
00:16:18.138 - 00:16:20.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember because we were investors in GoPro.
00:16:21.234 - 00:16:38.100, Speaker B: You know what I'm talking about? It's in the front of an aisle. It's in the whole section. So it says, like, adopt your friend, your forever friend. And it is tons and tons of, and tons of pudgies. And I think they're like $9 each. And it's really, really cool. I mean, they're available in 2000 US Walmarts with three exclusive toys.
00:16:38.100 - 00:16:46.692, Speaker B: Every time a pudgy sells, holders get a royalty. I'm sure it's a tiny, minuscule amount because they're only $9, but, you know, that, that could be good cash flow.
00:16:46.828 - 00:16:53.184, Speaker A: And does that, does each, does each of these physical items correspond to an NFT or. Not really?
00:16:53.524 - 00:16:56.812, Speaker B: I don't know that actually. I'm not. I'm not entirely sure.
00:16:56.908 - 00:16:59.112, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
00:16:59.308 - 00:17:18.888, Speaker B: Yeah. And then they have. So each toy. Here's your answer. Each toy comes with a QR code that unlocks digital traits which can be redeemed in their digital social experience. Pudgy world, which is built on ZkSync. And when you're there, buyers can collect and connect with friends just from buying this toy.
00:17:18.888 - 00:17:36.682, Speaker B: Now, who actually does that? Probably not your nine year old son or daughter who's buying this pudgy. They probably don't do that. But there's, I don't know, probably a world of 15 year olds who do that. I mean, if you remember. Do you remember Penguin world? I think it was called. Yeah, that little game online. So, I mean, it's kind of this again.
00:17:36.682 - 00:17:38.974, Speaker B: So. And it was cool. They. They have these.
00:17:39.634 - 00:17:44.010, Speaker A: I remember Tamagotchi. I love Tamagotchi. Like your online friend, you had to feed it and all this.
00:17:44.042 - 00:17:50.650, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I think it's pretty cool. I mean, they have these. They partnered with a couple of. They partnered with me. Bits and D gods.
00:17:50.650 - 00:18:01.226, Speaker B: So every toy comes with a random trait from a different NFT project. There's things from, like, you. NfT composability, physical composability.
00:18:01.330 - 00:18:02.242, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't know.
00:18:02.258 - 00:18:03.394, Speaker B: I think it's. I think it's cool.
00:18:03.434 - 00:18:39.914, Speaker A: Especially, I would love if. I would love the team to come on, you know, after like three, four months of data to tell us, like, things that I'd love to understand. Exactly that. Like who's buying it and. And all that data, like, what's cohort, what's a are they buying one or the buying ten? Who's actually activating the online stuff? And what's the overlap between who's buying it and who actually has an NFT? I just would love to just. There's so many analytics here because you're stitching the real world with crypto and understanding, kind of. That activity would be hugely fascinating.
00:18:39.914 - 00:18:42.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's worth having an episode with them.
00:18:42.386 - 00:18:58.064, Speaker B: So this is crazy. The actual Walmart account on Twitter, like, just at Walmart, millions of followers tweeted out an extra special welcome to Walmart. Tweeted, the penguin emoji, said, shop the new Walmart exclusive pudgy penguins here. Pretty cool. Gotta respect Luca for this.
00:18:59.204 - 00:19:26.248, Speaker A: And correct me if I'm wrong, like, I don't remember that part as well. But I think a lot of NFT projects have gotten caught up in promising this very pie in the sky roadmap and, you know, virtual worlds and yada, yada, yada. When I think of how many have delivered, it's basically none. Except. But I don't remember pudgy penguins being very vocal or even mentioning that at all. They were just like, these are cute.
00:19:26.296 - 00:19:58.896, Speaker B: I mean, when Luca bought them in 2022, he said, look, nfts are basically, all we're doing here is just creating IP houses. We are putting IP on the blockchain and doing it in innovative ways. And the way that you have to do that is by creating something that's super cute. We've got that already with pudgies, then creating a shit ton of impressions on social. So they've got, they have like a million followers on, I think it's TikTok or Instagram and. And then innovating with retailers. And for anyone who's ever dealt with licensing, it is super hard to get your product inside of Walmart.
00:19:58.896 - 00:20:00.664, Speaker B: And, yeah, respect.
00:20:00.744 - 00:20:16.248, Speaker A: No, it's really cool. You know, again, these are aesthetically what I think pleasing cute things. Like, I would, you know, they're kind of nice. You know, it's a nice penguin. I have, I have a plushy thing collection here, mostly of Harry Potter and then a penguin my mom actually gave.
00:20:16.296 - 00:20:17.736, Speaker B: I see your Lego set in the background.
00:20:17.840 - 00:20:42.818, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I bought some more Harry Potter. I mean, the amount of. Okay, folks, if anyone that works at Lego is listening to Empire, first of all, we're open to being sponsored by Lego because I buy it. Legos like crazy. And second of all, like, when are they going to issue nfts? Like, the minute they issue nfts, I'll just like go bankrupt because I'll spend everything. It's just like, it's amazing. I love, I love legos.
00:20:42.818 - 00:20:54.554, Speaker A: And the price of legos just keep going up is crazy. Talk about a great brand. They haven't done nfts. Not yet.
00:20:54.854 - 00:20:55.470, Speaker B: Not yet.
00:20:55.542 - 00:20:56.154, Speaker A: Waiting.
00:20:57.014 - 00:20:58.710, Speaker B: All right, let's talk Coinbase.
00:20:58.862 - 00:20:59.834, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:21:00.774 - 00:21:32.966, Speaker B: So back in May, Coinbase announced Coinbase International, starting with the first product was institutional. Traders could trade via this API. They could trade BTC and ETH. Perp settled in USDC and earlier this week they got regulatory approval to enable retail perps trading. I think it'd be helpful. And I think they received approval from Bermuda's monetary authority, the BMA, to enable perp futures for non us retail customers. So now retail can trade perps.
00:21:32.966 - 00:21:47.354, Speaker B: Retail outside the US can trade perks with Coinbase, huge development. Can you maybe give us a lay of the land of like where do you trade perps today? What are perps like? Just kind of set up this conversation and give me the high level on perks and crypto.
00:21:47.934 - 00:22:16.694, Speaker A: Yeah. So perps are one of those things that were uniquely developed in crypto. I think BitMex was the first one to come out with a perpetual swap. And I guess for people that are what is the closest thing in traditional finance, right. It is. Think of it as a, it's very similar to a traditional futures contract, but it has a few differences, right. One, there's no expiry or settlement like these are just constantly rolling, if you will.
00:22:16.694 - 00:23:17.588, Speaker A: And perps mimic like a margin based spot market. So that's why they kind of trade really close to spot, like to the index price. So if you have like an ETH perp, it usually very, or a BTC perp or whatever perp, it usually is very close to whatever the spot price is. Whats really interesting is this idea of a funding mechanism. So youll hear a lot of traders talk about the funding. Like the perp funding is really high, really low to understand how much of people are going long or short a particular asset. So just looking at funding mechanism is something that I observe in terms of how, how overextended are, you know, is this a metric for me to gauge indication? Like if, and the funding mechanism is used so as more people go long something or short, the funding mechanism is dynamic and to really anchor and keep the perp swap close to the spot.
00:23:17.588 - 00:23:28.192, Speaker A: Right. Because you don't want it to deviate too much. And the funding mechanism is really that the funding rate is what keeps is a mechanism that keeps the perp close to spot.
00:23:28.248 - 00:23:28.844, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:31.304 - 00:23:32.264, Speaker A: Which is kind of different.
00:23:32.304 - 00:23:32.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:32.480 - 00:23:39.240, Speaker A: Because the futures can trade very like, the futures can deviate quite a lot from spot, and I think that's due to basis.
00:23:39.312 - 00:23:39.592, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:39.648 - 00:23:45.576, Speaker A: But because you have a funding mechanism, these perps trade really close to spot. So, so far so good, I guess.
00:23:45.680 - 00:23:46.324, Speaker B: Good.
00:23:48.104 - 00:24:05.264, Speaker A: Perps, I guess, have you find them in different flavors? Pretty much every major exchange, like OKX and Bitmex and Binance have perps. FTX. This was like, probably perps are one of those things that get used a lot in the exchanges. There's widely popular.
00:24:07.804 - 00:24:09.324, Speaker B: Tell me about the leverage on perps.
00:24:09.364 - 00:24:27.344, Speaker A: That's where I was going. There's three different things, of course. One is the perp references a particular index or a particular, like, coin, right. You have the funding rate and then you have max leverage. Right. And what's really interesting is perp contracts don't require traders to post 100% of collateral as margin. Right.
00:24:27.344 - 00:24:50.790, Speaker A: And because of that, you can trade with a ton of leverage, sometimes up to over 100 x, which, you know, kids don't play with fire. Right. This is not an endorsement, you know, but just beware. Like, it's possible. I'm just, I'm just outlining what is possible here. And the margin, you have to post some margin. And of course, that can be denominated in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
00:24:50.790 - 00:25:21.654, Speaker A: And it really allows traders to speculate on the future value of the particular underlying index, if you will. So you could go long BTC or ETH perp with 33 x leverage and has no expiration. It just rolls. Of course, the funding rate is the key there. If the funding rate is really high, you got to keep monitoring that. Um, because you gotta, you know, that basically eats into your profit and you gotta post more margin. So.
00:25:21.654 - 00:25:45.880, Speaker A: And the other component, I guess, is perps can not, you know, as I mentioned, they could be, you know, inverse linear. They can have some sort of ratio to the price of a particular asset. Right. And so you gotta obviously understand how that works and what is called, like a multiplier. Right. So, yeah. I don't know if there's anything else that is worth noting here.
00:25:45.912 - 00:26:06.920, Speaker B: No, I think that. I think that's right. I mean, the important thing to understand here is that the global. So there's spot and there's derivatives, right? So spot crypto trading accounts for about 25% of the market. The global crypto derivatives market is about three times bigger than spot, I think, roughly. I haven't, I haven't looked at the numbers in a while, but I think it represents about 75% of crypto trading volume worldwide. So there's this really strong demand.
00:26:06.920 - 00:26:40.100, Speaker B: And the way that a lot of perks are traded today is probably either on kind of a, maybe a shadier exchange or in defi with like Quenta or DyDX. So actually coinbase and actually Gemini both announced this week offshore perps within days of each other. So I think Antonio from DyDX, who's maybe obviously a little biased on this because he runs DYDX, but he also has a really good take because he runs one of the biggest purp platforms. Um, let me just share some of his thoughts.
00:26:40.132 - 00:26:45.044, Speaker A: He said, well, I just kind of clarify one thing with people about funding rate, because I think it's important.
00:26:45.164 - 00:26:45.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:45.524 - 00:27:08.216, Speaker A: So when the funding rate is positive, longs are paying shorts. Um, and, and when it's negative, shorts are paying longs. Right. I mean, again, I think there's one or two exchanges actually have the inverse, which is really confusing that there's not like a particular standard across all exchanges. So you have to make sure that you understand kind of the funding rate mechanism. Usually it's like 8 hours where these things like funding occurs every 8 hours. Right.
00:27:08.216 - 00:27:23.584, Speaker A: So kind of the funding rate is dynamic and is constantly changing based on how many, you know, what's the ratio between people going long and short. Right. And the payout of said kind of, you know. So anyways, just. I wanted to clarify that, but go ahead.
00:27:23.704 - 00:27:53.672, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me read you some of Antonio's thoughts, which I think were pretty, summed it up pretty nicely. He said, look, so Coinbase shared that they did 5.5 billion in volume in q two from institutional perps. Not that big of a number, but remember, that's institutions only. And he points out, he said, look, there's continuing theme from the collapse of FTX that there's now a lot of fud on binance. And we decided not to talk about some of those rumors in this podcast.
00:27:53.672 - 00:27:59.858, Speaker B: But if you're on Twitter, you can probably see Adam Cochran and others are calling out binance for some things that they think are on the shade.
00:27:59.906 - 00:28:06.466, Speaker A: And by the way, I just recorded an episode with Tom and Ryan yesterday and we went into detail.
00:28:06.530 - 00:28:07.226, Speaker B: You did go into this.
00:28:07.250 - 00:28:09.402, Speaker A: Okay, some detail. Yeah. But, you know.
00:28:09.458 - 00:28:43.230, Speaker B: Okay. And that'll be live here. So Coinbase has, I think, has earned this reputation as being like the most trusted, most stable alternative to some of these, maybe what folks would think of as kind of sketchier exchanges. And now that Coinbase is perps, the question is, do users care enough about safety to move over? And for some users, I think that'll matter, right. But Antonio called this out and I kind of agree with him. He said, I've been repeatedly surprised how little users care about safety over my years in crypto. For example, remember when Bitfinex got hacked, 2016? Everyone thought that they were done.
00:28:43.230 - 00:29:32.822, Speaker B: A lot of people kept trading on them like nothing happened. So the biggest question is, will users want to move over? The other big question is, will coinbase be able to iterate fast enough and be aggressive enough to compete in what is already a very competitive landscape for purpose products and in a market that has probably benefited from less regulation because with purpose products, you have to be super aggressive. Listings, max leverage features, chart, trading order types, liquidity, ease of onboarding. Can Coinbase be as aggressive trying to be this very regulated company? So antonios take was that they take probably five to 10% of the derivatives market share in a year or two. We'll see. They're very late to the centralized exchange derivatives game, but I don't know. We'll see.
00:29:32.878 - 00:30:23.288, Speaker A: I mean, look, it's huge, right, because there's clearly a ton of demand. I think it's one of those things where it's a novel product. It's actually pretty sweet. And so I would think that this is something that is going to get a lot of traction within the existing clientele of Coinbase because a lot of institutions can't, can access these other exchanges that have perps. And so as Coinbase gets more market share, I think regardless of whether all these allegations or case, I think by and large, I mean, Coinbase is just Coinbase and Kraken, I think, are two of the exchanges that will probably continue to gain more market share. Coinbase has got a license in Spain. It's gone out and gotten more and more licenses overseas to serve retail and institutional, and it has a whole suite of products.
00:30:23.288 - 00:30:31.012, Speaker A: I think this is a good extension of that in terms of something that clearly has a ton of demand and is a huge profit maker for so many of the other exchanges.
00:30:31.068 - 00:30:31.236, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:31.260 - 00:30:35.844, Speaker A: I mean, so, yeah, I mean, this is pretty key, I think.
00:30:35.964 - 00:30:59.776, Speaker B: Yeah. So the other interesting Coinbase thing from this week was they brought a lot of folks to DC. They brought a lot of people into DC for this stand with crypto movement and Gary Gensler. So here. So here's actually Kevin, a walkie, kind of laid out what they, what they did. So, so the, the first session of the day was they brought all these folks in from, I think it was 50 crypto or 40 crypto founders. I think it was 40 crypto founders.
00:30:59.776 - 00:31:12.016, Speaker B: They brought them to DC from 15 different states that are key states. Right. And they did all these cool marketing campaigns. They had these cans that said, like, wake up, 52 million Americans.
00:31:12.040 - 00:31:22.422, Speaker A: They were cold brew cans, which cold brew. Anyone that knows is another potential sponsor. Goldberg, if anyone wants to sponsor is, you know, I love La Cologne. Best Goldberg in the market, by the way. Not endorsement, but look at this.
00:31:22.518 - 00:31:23.394, Speaker B: This is.
00:31:23.854 - 00:31:25.630, Speaker A: But the nutritional. The nutritional.
00:31:25.702 - 00:31:26.774, Speaker B: Nutritional fact. Yeah.
00:31:26.814 - 00:31:27.534, Speaker A: That was amazing.
00:31:27.614 - 00:31:39.990, Speaker B: Yeah. The nutritional facts. 87% of Americans want to update the financial system. 20% of american adults who own crypto or own crypto. 22. 22% of Democrats. 18% of Republicans.
00:31:39.990 - 00:31:58.490, Speaker B: Jobs crypto set to create by 2030, 4 million jobs for Fortune five Fortune 100 companies that have crypto initiatives. 52% Fortune 100 companies that consider crypto competitive advantage. 64% savings of ach payments. I can't see that word. But something. Something. Yeah, replace.
00:31:58.490 - 00:32:00.050, Speaker B: Got resolved by crypto.
00:32:00.082 - 00:32:11.092, Speaker A: 2.6 billion payments ran on crypto rails. 2.6 billion countries currently exploring digital currencies. 130 crypto owners with an income of greater than one hundred k. Seventy five percent.
00:32:11.218 - 00:32:13.240, Speaker B: No, less than one hundred k. Oh.
00:32:13.272 - 00:32:24.232, Speaker A: Less than 100k. Americans satisfied with the current financial system, 9%. It's time to update the system and a QR code, which I don't know where that goes, but probably stand with crypto.
00:32:24.328 - 00:32:50.068, Speaker B: Anyways, they had that. They also had this big money truck, like a brinks truck, where you, you know, you deliver cash and the future of money doesn't move on a money truck. Fucking genius. Really, really, really great campaign. So, anyways, first session of the day, they brought folks in to watch the Gary Gensler congressional oversight hearing live, which is really cool to have these founders and kind of sitting right behind them. And people were putting the, like, stan with crypto, little sign right behind them. They got to meet.
00:32:50.156 - 00:32:55.780, Speaker A: Reminiscent of, like, the hot, like, what was it? The bitcoin sign way, like years ago.
00:32:55.812 - 00:32:59.796, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. I like that guy. I've met that guy a couple times, actually. He got fired, right?
00:32:59.820 - 00:33:00.460, Speaker A: Or something.
00:33:00.612 - 00:33:26.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's okay. So anyway, I thought it was super successful campaign by Coinbase. I was watching CNBC and Bloomberg throughout the day to see if it would make its way to kind of mainstream, and it did not. So that was probably, I think we thought it was very successful, but maybe just on crypto Twitter. But it did feel like kind of the best coordination of policy and regulatory efforts, bringing founders in from all across crypto. Best in DC for a long time.
00:33:26.814 - 00:33:36.106, Speaker B: So yeah, just big shout out to Coinbase for kind of unifying the industry and making this very memeable content with the cans and the trucks and all that kind of stuff.
00:33:36.270 - 00:33:38.374, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Pretty awesome to see.
00:33:40.114 - 00:34:37.782, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Chronicle protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data.

00:36:08.014 - 00:36:14.662, Speaker A: Any highlights on the congressional hearing? I saw some clips that were, yeah.
00:36:14.718 - 00:36:47.588, Speaker B: Tom Emmer had some good clips, Richie Torres had good clips. The takeaway, so we had, some folks were covering it pretty closely. The big takeaway is that both sides of the aisle are now joining in. Right. There's Tom Emmer, who's Republican, Richie Torres, Democrat Mike Flood, Republican from Nebraska. Wiley Nickel, Democrat from North Carolina. There's now a bipartisan group of representatives that wants Gensler to, as they say, act for the SEC's failure to approve a spot, bitcoin, ETF, and a lot of them called him out.
00:36:47.588 - 00:37:00.566, Speaker B: Right. So this is, yeah, this is like the anti Gensler movement. So Casey Wagner, blockworks wrote this article. The title is the anti Gensler movement is picking up steam on both sides of the, of the aisle.
00:37:00.750 - 00:37:39.744, Speaker A: You know, what's interesting is I, because sometimes I think it was one of the first where crypto Twitter said, wow, they really grilled him. And, you know, and then I spoke with other folks and they were like, you know, you know what? Like, he kind of, like, danced around it brilliantly. And, you know, I was like, okay, that's interesting because most people seem to think that, you know, he was really cornered and, you know, and he'd have good answers to a lot of the stuff, particularly his ether security. Like, he wouldn't answer. I wonder what the feedback is now. And I think we, we ought to have an update on the regulatory pod soon with Rebecca, Jake and other folks. Right.
00:37:39.744 - 00:38:04.918, Speaker A: To talk about this and other things. But one thing that I have found interesting was there's been a lot like, the popularity of gensler is also not really positive amongst private equity and hedge funds because he's been trying to introduce just new, more probably what they seem to think, onerous kind of rules and for the private equity industry, and it's got a huge backlash.
00:38:05.086 - 00:38:26.884, Speaker B: And, well, not only, not only that, they, the rules that they've played placed on late stage private or on public companies make it really tough for late stage private companies to go public. So what you're seeing is more and more companies staying private for a couple of reasons. It's bad IPO market, but also it's the costs of being a public company go up every single year, which incentivizes founders to stay private for long.
00:38:26.924 - 00:38:54.722, Speaker A: Yes. So anyways, it's just interesting to see that sometimes we look around and say, hey, are we crazy? Like, are we missing something? Felt that, you know, we're not getting answers. And, but it was just interesting to observe that the, the reaction and of other, other industries towards, you know, you know, Gary has not been as positive. Right. And so, you know, clearly that also weighs in all this discussion.
00:38:54.858 - 00:39:10.216, Speaker B: Yeah, we want to talk about Unis. There's, there's some foundations like Uniswap and optimism asking for money. Curious to get your take on that. We could also talk about block native, shut down their relay.
00:39:10.320 - 00:39:10.964, Speaker A: No.
00:39:11.744 - 00:39:14.204, Speaker B: Where do you want to go? We could talk about these AI valuations.
00:39:15.024 - 00:39:23.124, Speaker A: That's always fun. I mean. Yeah, why don't we talk about that as a break from crypto folks? What's going on in AI land? Just 1 minute.
00:39:24.024 - 00:39:27.444, Speaker B: You see the secondary for OpenAI?
00:39:28.064 - 00:39:31.004, Speaker A: I did not. I did not participate in that.
00:39:33.224 - 00:39:38.726, Speaker B: So open AI is in talks for to sell some secondary valued at 80 to 90 billion.
00:39:38.870 - 00:39:44.966, Speaker A: That's roughly 40% with the earns market cap. Right. Give or take.
00:39:45.070 - 00:39:47.074, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think about this?
00:39:47.774 - 00:39:48.518, Speaker A: What?
00:39:48.686 - 00:39:51.222, Speaker B: Oh, that $80 to $90 billion secondary.
00:39:51.318 - 00:40:00.390, Speaker A: Probably local top, like entropic. Also like God, like, was it Amazon committed? Just kind of like a.
00:40:00.502 - 00:40:04.390, Speaker B: Which I actually do use anthropic every day at this point. I will say I like it.
00:40:04.422 - 00:40:28.310, Speaker A: I mean, to be fair, it's like getting AWS credits. So like, it was like, it was like, yeah, we'll give you 4 million, but you have to use AWS. So it's kind of like a. The structure of the deal made a lot of sense, I think, for Amazon. So. But yeah, look, I've been obviously paying attention to AI just invested in a fun called methos, like, which is super early stage. They were very, just from the size and I think he has really good network and whatnot.
00:40:28.310 - 00:40:40.850, Speaker A: And like, I want to have exposure to AI in my portfolio. I'm not going to be the one to do it. I wonder though, m y t h o s, Meathos Ventures.
00:40:41.042 - 00:40:49.170, Speaker B: Do you know who ran a fund called methos? Ryan. Ryan. Sean Adams at bankless, pre bankless. His fund was called Methos Capital.
00:40:49.362 - 00:41:08.964, Speaker A: Oh, right, yeah, I guess. Yeah. Popular names. I guess. So there's a great podcast on Nvidia and Taiwan semiconductors, two actually by acquired. So this is just pretty illuminating. The Nvidia one in particular.
00:41:08.964 - 00:41:30.786, Speaker A: There's two actually. The most recent one is really interesting to understand, like Capex and why, like why now? Like, why did we reach kind of this huge inflection point where everything was just out of the blue to talk about AI and Nvidia in particular? But I don't know, like it's really interesting because I wonder how much of this is going to be open source and how much is going to be monetizable.
00:41:30.970 - 00:41:31.650, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:31.802 - 00:42:01.304, Speaker A: And I also have questions around product. Like, I think there will be a lag between the amount of, and we saw this in crypto, the amount of companies that are going out and saying, you search public filings on Edgar sec and like, control f AI. And every, like, at this point, every company is like talking about AI in their filings because if they don't, then the market's going to punish them. I do think there's going to be a lag between, like, I just wonder, like, what's the best way to understand how companies are productizing AI?
00:42:01.424 - 00:42:08.352, Speaker B: And I'll tell you, I mean, did you see the Facebook, did you see the Facebook announcement with their, remember Google glasses?
00:42:08.488 - 00:42:08.992, Speaker A: Yes.
00:42:09.088 - 00:42:29.010, Speaker B: So Facebook just did a partnership with Ray Ban to launch Facebook or meta glasses and they actually don't look that bad. I always thought Snapchat was going to be the first to market with a pair of glasses that really integrated AI. These. Yeah, I mean, they look like Ray bans, but they're like full all AI features of meta. You can, like, you know, you can.
00:42:29.042 - 00:43:32.164, Speaker A: Be walking WHOOP recently announced and whooped like this wearable to track a bunch of things. Like announced, like integration with OpenAI. So, yeah, I like, I understand that, but I do, I do think that there's going to be a lag between when companies do the spend and what they actually productize. Some might move faster than others, but that might be the disillusionment is what I'm trying to say, where people think, wow, it's really going to transform the business, it's going to streamline, it's going to increase your margin, you're going to yada, yada, yada. But in reality, I think there will be really positive and successful implementations of that and there will be not so positive that will take longer than what the market thinks or expects. And that's where we might see this disillusionment, where it's like, okay, like magic leap is an example, right? A different example, like different category, obviously, like augmented reality in VR, but these things typically take longer. And I think the market is pricing it to a point of perfection where the expectation on the impact and the timing of said impact is just price to perfection.
00:43:32.164 - 00:43:35.532, Speaker A: And invariably when that happens, you know, there's disillusionment.
00:43:35.588 - 00:43:38.424, Speaker B: So do you personally use any of this stuff?
00:43:39.934 - 00:43:42.514, Speaker A: Pretty much stop using Google and just use like chat GPT?
00:43:42.814 - 00:44:17.994, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I pretty much do the same. It's crazy, the new stuff. So I have the chat app, you can go to settings and then go to new features and then turn on voice and you can pick the voice, it is the best, like, so I asked it a question and then it responded in this, in the voice and it was like a flawless response in your voice, in, no, like in another person's voice. But it didn't sound like a, you know, robot voice. It truly sounded like if you put this behind a zoom with no camera on it, I would have thought it was a person. Yeah. And responded instantly to this kind of tough question.
00:44:17.994 - 00:44:47.130, Speaker B: I asked it. And if you, you should use the data feature of it too, of chatgbt, you can upload a data set. It figures out what the data is, it cleans it, it denoises the data, it manipulates the data into like how it should be structured and then it represents the data visually and creates something better than, you know, you did IB, like, then you're an analyst. Yeah, exactly. Then this, then this IB analyst could do. It would take an, you know, someone in IB like 20 hours to do this. They can do it in 3 seconds.
00:44:47.202 - 00:45:17.768, Speaker A: So look, two things, I listen to anything and everything that Stan Druckenmiller says and he was long AI, like a year ago and like a long Nvidia. And you know, I just like, like a monkey just did the same. And I think the impact is going to be obviously lasting and transformative. But just question, like, I think there will be obviously troughs of, you know, local tops and highs. Local tops and, but the other thing that I saw recently is that it is now able, like chat DPT is now able to search the Internet like it was constrained. The data set was constrained to like.
00:45:17.816 - 00:45:21.656, Speaker B: Not constrained until September 2021. It is now updates from websites in.
00:45:21.680 - 00:45:25.186, Speaker A: Real time, which is really, actually, really, really useful.
00:45:25.280 - 00:45:39.494, Speaker B: Yeah, you can also have it write code. So I saw this video online, I haven't done this yet, but someone wrote like, hey, take emails here to the age, take a picture of that. And it was just a whiteboarded thing and it was like, turn this into code.
00:45:39.654 - 00:45:44.374, Speaker A: There's like a guy who's like, this is the, this is the front page. This one would look, took a picture.
00:45:44.454 - 00:45:51.286, Speaker B: And then boom, right? Or you can just screenshot a website, put it into chat GPT and be like, create the, create the code for this run.
00:45:51.350 - 00:46:18.286, Speaker A: I saw the only, this is two ones are really funny ones. Like, kids will never do homework again. And it was like they took the screen shot of the, of the homework and it was like, it was math and they were like, yeah, these are the answers. And then the other one was like, this guy took a picture of like, you know, like, parking signs are incredible. He was like, I will never get a parking violation ever again. Because it's like, hey, chat, DBT, can I park here? It's like, and it was like six different, like, things. You're like, what the hell? It's so confusing.
00:46:18.286 - 00:46:24.490, Speaker A: And then of course it says, yes, you can park here for an hour. It's like, perfect. Thank you. That's great.
00:46:24.642 - 00:46:50.224, Speaker B: Crazy. The valuations, I think that down so OpenAI is this unique, like, it's very one off thing. But I think there's a lot of AI companies raising it like 100, you know, $500 billion right now. I'm sure you've seen some of these and they're, you know, they're doing like a million of revenue. The thing I would caution is, I'm sure you're seeing some of these secondaries that are going on. The secondaries are getting worse and worse and worse. In crypto right now.
00:46:50.224 - 00:47:05.628, Speaker B: There is a company that did, and general tech, too. Yeah, they raised this company I just saw this week, raised it. Trying not to, I don't want to give them away, but they, they raised it up over, over a billion. They are not raising it. They're, they're, the revenue is $3 million.
00:47:05.676 - 00:47:16.384, Speaker A: They're running out of cash because they're two, three years. They're two and a half years into doing the last raise, which is where most companies are right now. And they have less than twelve months Runway. They're figuring out how to keep themselves keep.
00:47:16.794 - 00:47:31.138, Speaker B: So they raised it. They raised it over a billion. They're doing three to 4 million in revenue right now. It sounds like it's closer to 3 million. The 100 x multiple. Hundred x revenue multiple would just be, would be 300 million. So the rate.
00:47:31.138 - 00:47:54.644, Speaker B: So to get to the last valuation, you'd have to raise it like a 300 to 400 x revenue multiple. Obviously, that can't happen. So to not die because they're not close to profitability, or they either have to cut like 80% of their team, get to profitability, or they have to go raise more money. But if they do that, best case, they raise a down round. Worst case, they have to do a whole total recap. Um, just a nightmare situation.
00:47:56.304 - 00:48:51.544, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I mean, this is probably when we think about the things that I caution founders to do is like, be careful with raising a step function like round. That is just taking the highest valuation, because down the road you're going to have issues most likely like, growing into that valuation is going to be tough. The options that you issue to your employees are going to be priced at that last round. And invariably, if you don't live up to that expectation, probabilistically, you won't. Then you're going to have to do a massive recap, cram everyone down, your employee, and then how do you go from there? Like, the morale is just going to suck. Like, people can be like, wait a minute, I got issued options at a billion and now this thing's worth 30 million? Seriously? Like, they're doing 3 million in revenue. God, I mean, that's a 30 million, like that.
00:48:51.544 - 00:49:22.514, Speaker A: Are they profitable? Maybe they're cranking like a million and whatever. Ebitda, again, you shouldn't price these things necessarily on profitability, but, like, this was like what people were saying, you shouldn't price it on profitability. You know, it's a huge market, yada, yada. But now rates are where they are. Like, yeah, profitability is front and center. What are you need economics, what's your attention? Like, these are things that, like, it was, I mean, talking about the things that are so difficult. It's like, imagine if you're a fund.
00:49:22.514 - 00:49:48.958, Speaker A: You love that product. Do you think that company's worth at that time, probably like 200 million, maybe? And there comes a fund and gives them a billion dollar valuation. Like, and that happens over and over and over again for six years. Like, I would like, it's really tough to hold the line and not, and not just say, you know, I need to just, I need a dance. Everyone's doing it.
00:49:49.006 - 00:49:49.254, Speaker B: Yep.
00:49:49.294 - 00:50:14.782, Speaker A: And so, like, that's where I think those type of investors are going to be heavily rewarded right now, because those type, same folks that love the company, like the team past it, a billion now, might have the capital to give it to them and end up owning a huge chunk of the company at much more favorable, realistic terms. But it's really tough.
00:50:14.918 - 00:50:25.094, Speaker B: Let me ask you about these secondary deals that are happening. I guess not secondary deals, these token deals, these locked token deals that are happening from foundation. Optimism. This might have been last week, but.
00:50:25.134 - 00:50:28.074, Speaker A: Optimism, they sold a couple hundred million or so.
00:50:28.174 - 00:50:38.214, Speaker B: I think it was 117 million. Um, I don't know the facts on this, but what, what I heard is it was roughly a 30% discount to your lockup or two year vest.
00:50:38.794 - 00:50:39.514, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:39.674 - 00:50:55.694, Speaker B: I think seven funds took it down. It sounded like Andreessen probably took down about half of it. It's not. Not fact. I just, this is what I heard. Um, yeah, in some group chats. What, uh, how do you think about doing those do you do those deals? Do you skip on all those deals? Do you just, just case by case?
00:50:57.894 - 00:51:36.180, Speaker A: Well, is it relates to lock tokens? No, but at foundation tokens, yeah. I mean, I think it makes a whole lot of sense at the right terms. I think when you think about why it would trade at a discount, it's for two reasons, right? It's a, or one particularly, it's the marketability of it. Like the liquidity discount needs to be there and usually is at least 20%, depends on the lockup, but it has to be at least a year lockup. And I think it was at least 15 20%. And I've done a number of those deals. Look, it makes sense, right? I mean, if the foundation goes out and sells in the open market only the ethereum foundation is at that position where ETH is just that grown in that level of size.
00:51:36.180 - 00:52:11.864, Speaker A: And there's big, big constituent holders of Ethereum, like Joe Lubin, consensus bunch. And like the Ethereum foundation, there's different very big parties that hold a lot of ETH. And so the Ethereum foundation could just go out and sell and Coinbase. But for every other more fragile team, I think the signaling is stronger if you place those tokens in hands of investors that are committing to holding and believing long term. I don't know if a 16 c was part of it, but they were investors in the earlier rounds of optimism. For them, it just makes more sense to acquire a position. The signaling is super strong.
00:52:11.864 - 00:53:01.100, Speaker A: There's ways to go about it. I think this is where people get critical. It's like, wait a minute, why didn't you offer this deal to retail? And, you know, the challenges associated with that. Unfortunately, the investor accreditation rules, like is a short of it and it sucks. And it kind of, it really sucks. Like why shouldn't retail, that's been an investor in optimism, believes it, understands it technically can't participate in this type of deal, and lawyers will like shoot it down because of the lack of clarity in an investor correction. So you wonder like that, that's harmless, right? Like all of a sudden we've equated knowledgeability to wealth, which, by the way, I met really rich, dumb people and really smart people that haven't made money because they're early in their career for whatever reason.
00:53:01.100 - 00:53:33.224, Speaker A: And the fact that we've just set this arbitrary standard in the US of who can invest in these things or not, and we've excluded the vast majority of the population from these type of opportunities is ridiculous. It really is. The amount of wealth creation that has happened in the private markets is astounding. And only very few people have been able to participate. Oh, and then you wonder why inequality is on the rise in the US since the global financial crisis. Like, well, guys, like, update the goddamn rules, have sophistication tests, knowledgeability tests.
00:53:35.284 - 00:53:35.596, Speaker B: But.
00:53:35.620 - 00:53:57.176, Speaker A: You know, no, we can't do that. But these deals make a lot of sense. Like, Lido did a number of these, and the fund like paradigm did it, and they came and they posted on the blog, and the community, like, responded, and they had to prove their worth. And then the terms were very openly negotiated and then voted on upon light holders.
00:53:57.320 - 00:53:57.864, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:57.984 - 00:54:01.096, Speaker A: And then another fund came, and they were not. They were rejected.
00:54:01.200 - 00:54:01.844, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:02.784 - 00:54:22.216, Speaker A: No name fund. And so, you know, it's. It's. It's happening in the open, I think is really interesting. And so, yeah, I'm generally a big fan of. Of doing these things in an orderly manner. You know, that the team needs to get Runway, and, you know, I understand why they would want to do it.
00:54:22.216 - 00:54:34.248, Speaker A: Right. To secure Runway. Founder selling and foundation selling for the right reasons and the right amount makes a lot of sense. I have. I have no problems with that. A lot of people are really critical of founder selling. I'm like, no, of course.
00:54:34.248 - 00:54:47.816, Speaker A: Like, 99% of their net worth is tied in this company they've been working on for so many years. Do you think they're going to be less or more distracted if they diversify? Like, it's stressful. Right. So I'm a big believer in.
00:54:47.880 - 00:55:08.006, Speaker B: I think there's a. Yeah, I agree with that. You're like, okay, there's a danger. There's a. The most dangerous place for a founder to be is someone to have a little bit of financial comfort, but not too much financial comfort. So what I mean by that is I've seen some founders take 100 million in secondary. Right.
00:55:08.006 - 00:55:37.502, Speaker B: The founder of Hop in, there's a crypto company founder who they raised a lot. Founder took 100 million in secondary. That is too much secondary. That, in my mind, really disincentivizes you. The other side of that spectrum is a founder who's never taken secondary, has no money, and is super stressed out money every day. You can't take the risks you need to take to kind of stay on the cutting edge of your company. So I think the most dangerous place for a founder to be is in a good way, is having a little bit of financial cushion.
00:55:37.502 - 00:55:41.166, Speaker B: But, yeah, still, all eyes, some amount.
00:55:41.310 - 00:56:00.536, Speaker A: I've done this a number of times, and I think it's quite healthy. Like, I like that. I, you know, so like Vitalik, like, look at, look at historically, Vitalik has sold a bunch. He sold at six, he sold at 18, he sold at 18 and everyone freaked out. The dog went down to six again and that was, you know, it's like.
00:56:00.560 - 00:56:04.644, Speaker B: Guys, like everyone ETH dropped 10% because we thought Vitalika hit by a car.
00:56:05.304 - 00:56:33.366, Speaker A: Oh, no, I forgot about that fragile time. I mean, I remember when Vitalik sold, he sold a bunch of his stack it, I think it was $18, went down all the way to nine. I'm like, guys, what's wrong? I mean, he sold like x percent. Like, yeah, it's kind of normal, but yeah, in bear markets, people just want a reason to. The market skews negative, negative and it just reads everything, interprets everything that comes out as negative. And so it's like, okay, yeah, you know that, you know you're in a bear market when that happens, right?
00:56:33.550 - 00:56:41.062, Speaker B: So we have two pods coming up. I think this is a good place to wrap the two pods. We've got you, Tommy and Ryan. That'll be fun.
00:56:41.238 - 00:56:42.208, Speaker A: Yeah, that was really fun.
00:56:42.286 - 00:56:54.064, Speaker B: We had two guys from blockchain capital, Spencer Bogart and Alex to the gps of blockchain capital. So yeah, really excited for that conversation. It was a pretty good one. And yeah, Monday and Tuesday, those both drop.
00:56:55.364 - 00:57:03.100, Speaker A: Really excited for those. Drop us a comment. As people have noticed, I'm more active on the comments on YouTube, so drop us a comment if you like those conversations.
00:57:03.252 - 00:57:04.764, Speaker B: I like when people tweeted us.
00:57:04.884 - 00:57:11.096, Speaker A: I like, I mean, obviously I'm more active on Twitter, so it's nice on YouTube.
00:57:11.120 - 00:57:29.432, Speaker B: Everyone's addicted to me on YouTube. Most. I went on this podcast called MFM, my first million. Oh, yeah, it's like one of the biggest podcasts in the world right now. And I went on it and let me, like, these comments are just ripping me right now. Nice.
00:57:29.528 - 00:57:47.594, Speaker A: Well, I will say if you shave your head, I think there'd be interesting comments, first of all. And well, actually one other thing, you won't say it, but I will. I noticed that you guys were won an award. Blockworks did like top innovate. Like, there's just awards of the most innovative companies. Like, can you just.
00:57:47.894 - 00:58:07.940, Speaker B: LinkedIn publishes. For the last seven years, LinkedIn has published their top 50 us startups list. And all these great companies have been on like Brax. And this year the number one was ramp, if you know ramp. Number two was liquid death. There's, it's a really fun list and I always read it this. So yesterday I'm sitting in the office.
00:58:08.092 - 00:58:09.340, Speaker A: And you had no idea.
00:58:09.452 - 00:58:15.100, Speaker B: I had no, no idea. A lot of these lists you have to pay for, like, before Forbes 30.
00:58:15.132 - 00:58:21.044, Speaker A: Under 30 is like, you know, you get a nod from, like, the, the venture partner and one of his analysts is like, hey, can you name him 30 under?
00:58:21.084 - 00:58:33.652, Speaker B: So, yeah, Forbes. We, we also got Forbes 30 under 30. Didn't have to pay, but like, there's definitely like a, hey, who do you know? Type of game. Yeah, there's all these other lists like cranes and Inc. 500. You have to pay money to be on those lists. And so LinkedIn, you don't have.
00:58:33.652 - 00:58:53.308, Speaker B: No one ever reached out to us. I was sitting in the office and we have this new reporter, Jack Dow, defi reporter, and he's like, hey, this is super cool. We're on the top. We're on LinkedIn's 31st best us startup to work at. And I was like, that seems like a scam. It's probably a fake list. He's like, no, no, I'm reading it.
00:58:53.308 - 00:58:57.660, Speaker B: It's on LinkedIn.com dot. Sure enough. Yeah, blockworks sitting at number 31.
00:58:57.732 - 00:58:59.740, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. Congrats.
00:58:59.892 - 00:59:01.268, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, brother.
00:59:01.396 - 00:59:09.036, Speaker A: Good stuff. I don't check LinkedIn. I haven't checked in a while, but I saw it on Twitter, so, yeah, it was cool.
00:59:09.100 - 00:59:20.596, Speaker B: Yeah. This year, it's their top LinkedIn news story. This year's 50 startups. To watch you click it, scroll down. And they called us a software development firm, so not sure they know what we do, but that's okay.
00:59:20.700 - 00:59:23.678, Speaker A: Hey, maybe they're giving you credit for the research analytics.
00:59:23.796 - 00:59:26.770, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. We have some good software here, so.
00:59:26.922 - 00:59:27.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:27.474 - 00:59:28.202, Speaker B: Sweet, man.
00:59:28.338 - 00:59:31.894, Speaker A: Awesome. Any books, stuff that you're watching?
00:59:32.794 - 00:59:38.050, Speaker B: I'm reading the new Elon book. Oh, yeah, the Walter Isaacson Elon book.
00:59:38.162 - 00:59:46.970, Speaker A: Yeah, it's nominated as one of the best books. And financial times are like the. Probably the best, like, top books of the year. Yeah, kind of awards. And that's one of them, I guess.
00:59:47.162 - 00:59:53.244, Speaker B: I see Walter Isaacson. I'm a simple man. Walter Isaacson puts out a biography. I read the book, so.
00:59:53.824 - 00:59:54.640, Speaker A: God.
00:59:54.792 - 01:00:06.604, Speaker B: Yeah. Simple man. Leonardo, codebreaker, Einstein, Steve Jobs. Yeah, those are. Those are all great. What about you?
01:00:08.504 - 01:00:17.032, Speaker A: Nothing. I'm out of content, guys. I need. I need content again, this acquired podcast, I've been going through all of them.
01:00:17.128 - 01:00:20.120, Speaker B: I've had some. I've had some deep, like, acquired podcasts.
01:00:20.152 - 01:00:25.574, Speaker A: Really good. LVMH, Nvidia, Costco, Taylor Swift. I want to listen to next.
01:00:25.654 - 01:00:27.054, Speaker B: The NFL was a good one, too.
01:00:27.094 - 01:00:32.862, Speaker A: NFL is on the list, too. Yeah, I know. It's a really nice discovery, and I.
01:00:32.878 - 01:00:46.942, Speaker B: Really have enjoyed, you know, so I've talked to one of those guys a couple times just on Twitter, DM's one. They record like 10 hours of content and drill it down for a four hour podcast. And they don't talk to each other before the podcast. So, like, they will be like, we're going to record.
01:00:46.998 - 01:00:49.782, Speaker A: They do extensive research. I mean, I think we're going to.
01:00:49.798 - 01:01:03.078, Speaker B: Do a Nike episode. They'll be like, great. Like, see you in a month for this episode. I mean, they talk a little bit, but they don't talk about their research at all. So it's brand new. So they'll get on the Nike episode. They'll be like, yeah, I read this thing and the other person's like, oh, my God, I didn't know that.
01:01:03.078 - 01:01:05.834, Speaker B: Or, oh, my God, I read the exact same thing. That's so cool.
01:01:06.294 - 01:01:22.524, Speaker A: Anyways, they surface a lot of, like, the LVMH one is fascinating. I had very little understanding of how that came together, and that was, the Nvidia one was excellent. That's where I started. And I was like, okay, really thorough. Really good. Um, yeah, so anyways, that's what I'm doing.
01:01:23.144 - 01:01:23.840, Speaker B: Cool, man.
01:01:23.952 - 01:01:25.084, Speaker A: And running, of course.

01:01:27.248 - 01:01:35.736, Speaker A: That's the pod. That's it. Under an hour. So, folks, thanks for listening as always. Uh, we will see you here next, next week and see you on Monday.
