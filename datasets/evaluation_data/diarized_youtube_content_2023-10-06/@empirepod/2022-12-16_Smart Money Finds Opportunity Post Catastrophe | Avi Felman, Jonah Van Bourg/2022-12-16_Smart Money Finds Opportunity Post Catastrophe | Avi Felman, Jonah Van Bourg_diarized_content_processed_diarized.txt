00:00:00.480 - 00:00:16.674, Speaker A: All the smart people with a lot of money, what they like to do is they like to look for buying opportunities. And let me tell you, post catastrophe, smart people are trained to look for opportunity.
00:00:18.814 - 00:00:40.882, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. You've got two special guests today. Santi is traveling. Big, big December of travels for Santu today. So we've got Avi and Jonah stepping in. And you guys might have noticed a new show on the Empire feed this week called 1000 X. So we wanted to bring on Avi and Jonah, who are the two hosts of thousand x, to let us know what's going on.
00:00:40.882 - 00:01:03.994, Speaker B: But before we do that, quick announcement that we dropped permissionless tickets this week. As you guys know, every two weeks we unlock 250 new tickets to permissionless. They've sold out instantly, both times. Hopefully, by the time you're listening to this, there's still some tickets available for you. So if you want to head over to the website and get your tickets to permissionless, go do that. So, Avi, Jonah, welcome to the show, guys.
00:01:04.414 - 00:01:06.286, Speaker A: Hey, thanks for having me on. Appreciate it.
00:01:06.310 - 00:01:33.244, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, of course. So the way that I see it, the way that I think about 1000 x is there was something missing in the market, which was basically a podcast. All these crypto shows, right? Blockworks has shows like, laura Shin's got her shows, bankless has the shows. But there was a show that's missing, which is really a show by traders for traders. And so I'd love to hear that. Like, that's how I think about it internally. But, Avi, I'd love to hear you just explain, like, what I mean, busy guy.
00:01:33.244 - 00:01:37.824, Speaker B: Like, why. Why did. Why are you spending time build, building this podcast? Like, what's your vision for it?
00:01:38.324 - 00:02:04.442, Speaker A: So the funny part is, this is an entirely selfish thing. I just really like talking to Jonah, and I want to keep talking to Jonah, and I want to keep finding excuses to talk to Jonah because he says a lot of interesting things. So I was like, great. How do I get this guy to talk to me once every two weeks and just give me everything that he knows? And I settled on a podcast. I mean, that actually is a decent. A decent. A decent chunk of it.
00:02:04.442 - 00:02:58.244, Speaker A: As Jonah and I, you know, we talk. We talk pretty regularly. And, you know, I think we have really, really interesting conversations, and I find them interesting and decided that it could be fun to do it in a podcast format and sort of just kick around ideas. And then in the future, we'll bring on some guests that people haven't really heard from publicly before. These are mostly going to be. We're trying to find new and interesting perspectives, because one of the most important things to do is just broaden your mind, find people that have done very cool and interesting and amazing things, but maybe you just haven't heard their perspective before. Right? So we're going to bring these people onto the podcast and hopefully ask them, you know, important questions and just to take a step back and talk about kind of who we are.
00:02:58.244 - 00:03:40.310, Speaker A: Jonah and I, yes, it's a podcast by traders who are actually trading in the market, but I think more important than that is it's a specific type of trader. Joan is at a large firm. I'm at a large firm. Historically, crypto has not been approached in the most professional and rigorous way. And I think both of us are coming to this market with an angle of, hey, this is how the top of the top do it in the traditional world. Let's figure out how to apply that to crypto, and let's talk about that. I think there are a lot of really smart traders out there that get on podcasts all the time.
00:03:40.310 - 00:04:30.752, Speaker A: I think that there are a lot of really smart people out there. I think what's just been a little bit missing is almost all the boring stuff. We talked on the last podcast about assessing counterparty risk. How do you do that when you're trying to run a professional shop? What do you need to think about? What do you need to do? And these types of conversations, I think, are just going to get more and more important over time. And they're conversations that aren't necessarily had out loud because a lot of the time they're had behind closed doors. And so I think we can talk about that, bring a professional approach to the crypto markets, and hopefully people will learn a lot and get better because of it, because I think both of us have developed some pretty interesting processes for approaching the markets that are just different than your average trader would.
00:04:30.888 - 00:04:58.240, Speaker B: Nice. It feels silly to sit here and ask you guys about podcasts. I want to ask you guys about the markets, actually. And Jonah, you sit at this interesting seat at the center of a lot of trading in crypto. Head of trading at Cumberland, I think, is your formal title. I'm just curious to get your broader framework for how you are viewing the rest of this, not just this year, the next two weeks, but maybe the next, like 30, 60, 90 days. How are you? What's your framework for approaching these markets?
00:04:58.352 - 00:05:13.524, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I mean, first of all, you know, I've only been doing crypto professionally for a year. Before that, I was an oil trader for 15 years. And so I'm honored to be able to talk to you, Jason, and to talk to a crypto superstar like Avi every week. So that's exciting.
00:05:13.984 - 00:05:15.764, Speaker B: How do you feel about that title, Avi?
00:05:16.984 - 00:05:18.764, Speaker A: I like it less than Thundercat.
00:05:19.204 - 00:05:20.388, Speaker C: He's a young Thundercat.
00:05:20.436 - 00:05:24.144, Speaker B: You got to listen to 1000 x to get the reference. You got to listen to the thousand x.
00:05:25.244 - 00:06:17.050, Speaker C: The way I'm going to try to think about these markets is first and foremost by talking to Avi and guys like Avi and trying to guys like you, Jason, trying to learn just through discussions. Nobody learns to trade by sitting in a vacuum for people who haven't worked on trading floors, they're very loud, talkative places. And that's sort of one of the reasons why we're doing this podcast, is to try to bring that conversation to a wider audience and source some views from a broader audience and get them back into our own heads. Because in addition to us telegraphing what we're thinking, and hopefully people can find some wisdom and trading ideas in that we'll hopefully be able to source ideas from the audience as well. That's exciting in terms of how we're looking at the market right now. You know, as a liquidity provider and a risk taker, you fall. The first thing you follow is the volumes.
00:06:17.050 - 00:06:42.534, Speaker C: And right now, volumes are down big. Like if you look at March or June as a reference month in crypto, we're down 50% to 60% volumes wise. So there's two interpretations. Number one would be, this is it. Sam Bankman freed killed crypto. You know, it's just going to, you know, hop in your igloo and get ready for a 2018 style winter of apathy and sideways price action. The other is, hey, this is a holiday period.
00:06:42.534 - 00:07:45.476, Speaker C: The drumbeat of adoption is continuing. The devs aren't stopping what they're doing. They're not quitting and going to work for JP Morgan it department. They're not packing up their bags and leaving web3 and going to work for some random, boring project people are all in on crypto. Volumes are still a massive order of magnitude bigger than they used to be, even in 2020. So from my perspective, Avi and I talked about this on 1000 x. Effectively, who's the next seller if you can't really pin it down and you're starting to see some bullish price action against the backdrop of all this bearish news, you're supposed to start thinking about getting pulled up here and getting long because if this amount of bad news has just dropped the price of bitcoin and Eve is where it is, the price action signals bullish times ahead, both for volumes and for price.
00:07:45.476 - 00:07:46.876, Speaker C: Thats how were looking at it.
00:07:46.980 - 00:08:12.604, Speaker B: Preston, I want to get your guys take on. Actually, let me ask about the sellers. I think it was you who mentioned in the podcast episode earlier today that dropped or yesterday 1000 x. The first thing you do when you wake up in the morning is you think about whos buying and whos selling the, who are the buyers and who are the sellers. So I guess, can you just digest it? Like, when I think about that, there are probably two names that come to mind. It's the mine. The miners are just have to sell bitcoin.
00:08:12.604 - 00:08:29.624, Speaker B: And then there are. And then there are, I mean, like, funds. I don't know if. I don't really understand the market mechanisms of, like, you know, maybe are people doing redemptions for funds? Like, funds have to close their books on December 31? Like, does that people.
00:08:29.664 - 00:08:31.768, Speaker A: People love saying that. Let's do. Let's do some quick math. Okay.
00:08:31.816 - 00:08:32.954, Speaker B: Yeah, tell me about that.
00:08:33.064 - 00:08:44.830, Speaker A: You know, let's say there. Let's say there was 10 billion on January 1 this year. Let's say there was 10 billion held by crypto funds. No, let's do. Let's do 20 billion. Let's say 20 billion was held by crypto funds. Okay.
00:08:44.830 - 00:08:59.614, Speaker A: Well, your average crypto fund is probably down 60% to 70% this year. Okay. So let's, let's. Let's be, you know, conservative and say they're down. They're down. Call it. I don't know.
00:08:59.614 - 00:09:36.266, Speaker A: Yeah, 66, 60%. And then let's take the fact that we've got probably most crypto funds are looking at 50% in terms of cash exposure right now. Right. So if you've got 10 billion in crypto funds and you're down 60, you're looking at 4 billion, you've got 50% in cash, you're looking at 2 billion of exposure. Do you think that every single person is about to redeem from these crypto funds? Okay, if every single person redeems from the crypto fund, you've got $2 billion of sell pressure. Okay, that's fine. I mean, yeah, it's gonna send us.
00:09:36.266 - 00:09:51.510, Speaker A: It's gonna send us a little bit. A little bit lower. But bitcoin trades billions of dollars a day. ETH trades billions of dollars a day. You know, and then obviously, the number is not 100% of people withdrawing so all right, real quick, what's up?
00:09:51.602 - 00:09:53.326, Speaker B: I said, cleared that one up real quick.
00:09:53.470 - 00:10:12.406, Speaker C: Yeah. If somebody asked, it just doesn't make sense of bitcoin. Like if we were asked to show a price for that, we wouldn't be charging a couple of basis points. But equally, let's just say we charge down 10% from fair value like bitcoins back to where it was a couple of days ago. On that, who cares?
00:10:12.590 - 00:10:16.234, Speaker B: Okay, so fund redemptions, funds closing their bucks.
00:10:17.454 - 00:11:03.534, Speaker A: I think the key here when I was saying that maybe it needs to be articulated a little bit more clearly is sometimes I'm thinking about the actual specific type of person. So sometimes I'm thinking about the fund or the miner or the retail investor or your high net worth. Sometimes I'm thinking about that. What I'm thinking about right now is really just more an aggregate. It's more if you want to sell any. If anybody has wanted to sell over the last month, what are their reasons for selling? Probably FTX is a big part of it, the other dominoes to fall is another big part of it. Price action is another big part of it, and macro is another big part of it.
00:11:03.534 - 00:11:49.918, Speaker A: None of those things have changed over the last month. All of the reasons to sell I've sort of dissipated at this point. If you're holding crypto and you didn't sell yesterday, what makes you wake up today and decide to sell that crypto? What makes you do that? The answer in my mind is really only one, is if price goes up, then you can exit a bit. It's like, okay, so let's say you're underwater and you're sitting there and you're like, okay, now maybe bitcoin's nineteen, twenty k. I can sell a little bit. Maybe you bought fifteen, sixteen k. And what are you aiming, the buyer? If you've bought 1516k, what are you looking for? You're probably not looking for 18.
00:11:49.918 - 00:12:17.774, Speaker A: You're probably looking for 20 or 21 or 22. I mean, that's too small of a move for your average buyer. So what I'm saying is this current state, looking at the current market with ETH at 1272 and bitcoin at 17, five, I don't see where the mass amount of selling comes in. Now, I'm not saying we can't go to 17. I'm not saying we can't go to 16, five. But I am saying I think it'd be weird and unexpected for us to go to 14 before 20. That's my view.
00:12:17.774 - 00:12:32.902, Speaker A: I think that would require, in my mind, this is an opinion, this is not a fact, but I think it would require finance going down or USDT going down, or something insane and crazy that is very unlikely to happen. To happen. Yeah.
00:12:32.918 - 00:12:34.430, Speaker C: You need a new trigger, I think.
00:12:34.462 - 00:12:40.566, Speaker A: One other new trigger to get people to sell. Otherwise, you have to ask yourself the question, why haven't they already sold? Right.
00:12:40.750 - 00:13:19.824, Speaker C: Yeah. In terms of who would buy. Like, you had over a million depositors on FTX, people depositing and earned products like what Celsius is running, and Voyager and a couple of others who once owned bitcoin and ETH, and now they own nothing. They own a claim. That's where distressed claim on what used to be bitcoin or ETH that's now lost somewhere in some bankruptcy proceeding, there may actually be a deficit of crypto. If even 1% or 2% of those people decide to go and repurchase the bitcoin that they used to have, these bankruptcies could result in some buying.
00:13:20.674 - 00:13:51.914, Speaker A: I do want to point out one additional risk factor, which I didn't mention, which is, obviously, sellers can come from correlation trades. So if the S and P keeps going down, then bitcoin and ETH can keep going down. But I want to point out something fun, which is we're talking right now. It's 12:30 p.m. Eastern from 930 market open to now. Over the last 3 hours, S and P is down 1.3% and ETH is down 30 pips.
00:13:51.914 - 00:14:41.774, Speaker A: So what that tells me is, it tells me there are a lot more sellers in equities than there are in crypto right now. And I think partially it's because there's a lack of sellers, but partially it's because people are buying. And you always have to ask the opposite question. It would be rude and incomplete of me to not ask who's the buyer? Can't just ask one side. And I think I have a lot more answers for who's the buyer? Because 17K bitcoin, that's a level that you haven't seen since 2017. People are going to look at that and they're going to say, this seems like, it seems like a reasonable price, seems like a good deal. You look at ETH at 1270, and you say to yourself, well, oh, after the biggest exchange blow up of all time, ETH is still at 1270.
00:14:41.774 - 00:15:03.382, Speaker A: Maybe there's some value here, and I need to start allocating. Right. I think all the. All the smart people with a lot of money, what they like to do is they like to look for buying opportunities. And let me tell you, post catastrophe, smart people are trained to look for opportunity. That's always what happens.
00:15:03.478 - 00:15:06.226, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, so then let me. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.
00:15:06.310 - 00:15:07.970, Speaker A: No, that's all. That's all I was going to say.
00:15:08.122 - 00:15:29.450, Speaker B: Let me turn that into a question, then, which is, it feels like the last several months people have been positioning themselves for the downside. It's like, okay, I think there's greater risk in the system. There's still leverage in the system. Everyone's asking that kind of funny question, like, what's the contagion here? Does this now make you think, avi, about like, all right, let me flip that around. How do I position myself for the upside? Are we there yet?
00:15:29.642 - 00:16:17.904, Speaker A: I'm positioned, you know, I think I'm positioned accordingly to the way that I've been, the way that I've been speaking. You know, you never want to take excess risk and you always want to make sure that you have invalidation for your theses and you have a plan for getting punched in the face. But it's, you know, my, my view of the market and I've been cautious for a while. I think if you, if you listen to my previous podcast, you know, over the last six months of, I've been, I think I've been a voice of moderated caution as opposed to outright bullishness. I think this is the most bullish. I've been on our podcast since 2020. So my view here is that post catastrophe, you need to be looking for opportunity, not betting that it's going to get worse.
00:16:17.904 - 00:16:35.768, Speaker A: I'm not saying I'm right. It could get worse. Another domino could fall. But if you're not looking for opportunity now, when do you look for opportunity? It's silly to look for opportunity when bitcoin's at 30 kilo or at not look for opportunity when bitcoins at 17. Thats a silly way to approach a market. Preston.
00:16:35.816 - 00:17:29.602, Speaker C: I think thats actually a good little plug for our podcast. Avi, at this point, if you listen to crypto commentators, the talking heads, you tend to get a lot of crypto euphoric people who believe that this is the future and they have a mentality that crypto cant go lower equally. You read the news, theres a lot of no coin or haters out there who just say that its all scammed bullshit. Those people are equally sure of themselves in the opposite direction. I think what we're trying to bring to the table is a little bit more of a balanced take. Like Avi said, when the price goes down, suddenly the math starts to look a lot more attractive to the upside, I think what's interesting about this particular sell off, relative to the one that happened back in May when Luna blew up, that was a blockchain collapse, which you could argue it was baked into the white paper and the code, and you should have seen it coming from a mile away. Sure.
00:17:29.602 - 00:18:11.364, Speaker C: But I think that was a moment when the market realized, like, hey, we need to be suspicious of blockchains. This one, like bitcoin and ETH, didn't stop processing blocks. There was just a company in the Bahamas that blew up. Very, very different story. So I think as people watch the SBF news and watch him go to jail and start to disaggregate his particular actions from what blockchains mean for society, I think you have some room to disaggregate the current price action and the post FTX sell off from crypto bearish factors. You understand what I'm getting at here?
00:18:11.744 - 00:18:35.974, Speaker B: I do. Avi, let me ask you something, because you were around in the last cycle, and basically every cycle follows the same thing, which is just pushing further out on the risk spectrum. You would hypothetically think that this next cycle looks like bonds, then equities, then bitcoin, then ethics, then alt l one s maybe, then. Then apps, and then. And then the Ponzi's, and then that's the top. Do you think that. Do you think this next cycle looks the same?
00:18:37.474 - 00:18:40.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think humans change, and.
00:18:40.618 - 00:18:42.938, Speaker B: That'S just pushing further out on the risk spectrum. Yeah.
00:18:42.986 - 00:19:07.632, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think it just. It's gonna have. It's gonna have the hallmark. I mean, I think cycle is probably a misnomer, just because I don't think that there's. You know, I think if you look at how bitcoin has traded over the last ten years, since inception, it definitely has traded in a cycle format with boom busts. I think moving forward, that's going to happen, it's just going to be more muted.
00:19:07.632 - 00:19:36.390, Speaker A: And that's actually what we saw this cycle. We went up less. That's just the nature of. It's funny, I think it's a cube. The cube rule, right? It's in engine. In engineering, if you take miniature scale models and you just make them bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, sometimes at some point they actually break even though they worked when they were miniature. Right.
00:19:36.390 - 00:20:08.994, Speaker A: Because you kind of hit the upper bounds of what physics will allow you to allow you to accomplish and the same thing is true bitcoin. It's just like, it gets to a certain point where it's just too big to do the same things that it was doing before. And I think that's probably true here. But that being said, tops in crypto will look like tops in crypto have before, which is that people go down the risk spectrum, but it's just true in market cycles, too. You look at the tech, tech boom ended the same way this time that it did last time, with a lot of crazy stuff getting funded.
00:20:09.974 - 00:21:10.134, Speaker C: It's interesting, another lateral from the commodities space. If you guys have ever read this awesome book called the prize, about the history of crude oil, it's, you know, it's the bible for every crude trader. At the beginning of the book, there's this chart, in inflation adjusted terms, a chart of the price of crude oil from its inception in the late 18 hundreds until the present day. And there's spectacular volatility, like what Avi was talking about in the very beginning, when much like crypto, you could slap a price on this emergent technology. Hey, is it just crap that bubbles out of the ground and maybe it's tar or, hey, actually, like some Yale chemistry economists, can turn this into kerosene, which can be used to light and heat a room. Is it one or the other? Is it useless junk or is it the future? And the price would do these huge, huge oscillations, then it calmed down for a little while, and the cycles got a little bit tighter and the amplitude lessened, but the trend was up. I think that's a really interesting lateral for crypto at this early stage.
00:21:10.434 - 00:21:15.956, Speaker B: Jonah, how do you see folks positioned right now in the middle of a lot of this smart crypto money?
00:21:16.100 - 00:21:43.964, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so you've got a couple different buckets of traders right now, and here's what they're doing. One bucket. Is institutional investors fairly passive. They're waiting on the sidelines, right? If they jump in, they're not really looking at like, hey, it's low price. This is the best opportunity, because if they jump in and it goes down another 50%, they get fired. Meanwhile, if it three xs and they buy, then when all their peers are buying, it's a safer bet and they don't get fired.
00:21:43.964 - 00:21:56.344, Speaker C: So that's sort of that, that group's incentives, they're just waiting on the sidelines. Their plans are pushed out a little bit. Group number two, you have the Avi Feldmans of the world. Fast money, as we call them. Those people are starting to get involved.
00:21:57.204 - 00:21:58.196, Speaker B: Dangerous, Avi?
00:21:58.300 - 00:22:27.248, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. If you're an active trader and you follow price action and macro correlation, you're looking at crypto here. And more often than not, like that group is saying, like, this is, you know, this is a movement. It's gaining geopolitical relevance. Like, this is this currency. As these orwellian hemispheres get erected between east and west, like, bitcoin is kind of a shoe in for global reserve currency.
00:22:27.376 - 00:22:27.896, Speaker A: It's down.
00:22:27.960 - 00:22:58.450, Speaker C: What? From the all time highs, it's outperforming equity. Like, buy right up. So that group, they range from, like, big macro hedge funds, like the tinfoil hat wearing gold bug crowd. Those guys are thinking about getting long here. Already long. And then you have some crypto native participants. And as Avi said, the typical crypto hedge fund is if they were lucky enough or intelligent enough or had enough foresight to get their assets off of FTX.
00:22:58.450 - 00:23:12.914, Speaker C: The altcoin investing strategy that minted millionaires and billionaires in 2021 has been a very treacherous strategy this year. So a lot of those guys are down big, and they're. They're kind of constrained in what they can do, and their volumes are down.
00:23:13.034 - 00:23:13.734, Speaker A: That's.
00:23:14.034 - 00:23:15.774, Speaker C: That's sort of a basic overview.
00:23:16.074 - 00:23:32.884, Speaker B: Yeah, I know both you guys have to hop into sec. So I've two last things I want to get you guys takes on, and then we can wrap this up. One is just leverage in the system. If you look at the last cycle is, like, very. I mean, Genesis had, like, $51 billion of loans outstanding at the top.
00:23:33.034 - 00:23:33.576, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just.
00:23:33.600 - 00:23:36.176, Speaker B: I'm just curious how you guys see, like, leverage.
00:23:36.320 - 00:23:36.944, Speaker A: There's just.
00:23:36.984 - 00:23:38.232, Speaker C: There's not a lot of it out there.
00:23:38.288 - 00:23:39.144, Speaker A: It's just not. You can't.
00:23:39.184 - 00:23:51.576, Speaker B: I know the leverage has been wiped out, and I know it's, like, very, like, credit driven cycle last time, but, like, moving forward. How do you see credit in crypto moving forward? And is. I see it from the c five players, or is it, like, all defi credit? Like, what does this look like?
00:23:51.680 - 00:24:46.824, Speaker C: Well, in the short run, the. The absence of leverage sort of means that people aren't going to have to trade when they don't want to. If you're levered up and then credit tightens up, you're forced to trade at the worst possible time. That's what we saw over the course of the last six to eight weeks. Now that that's kind of cleaned itself out, you're not going to see as many forced sellers in terms of where borrowing and lending coin is a fantastic business if you do it intelligently. And I would be shocked if people from Avis parent company's world of Golden Tree and similar extremely well respected credit funds don't start to get involved in lending at some point and you'll have CFI lenders come back, but done right as opposed to done by poor risk managers who do crazy things with the coins that they're loaned. Also, I think on chain is where lending is going.
00:24:46.824 - 00:24:59.872, Speaker C: Aave is a fantastic source of liquidity and that's only going to grow because of its transparency and its utility and its a defi primitive that has, in my opinion, a very big role in the future of crypto trading.
00:25:00.048 - 00:25:03.404, Speaker B: Yeah avi, anything to add there?
00:25:03.904 - 00:25:05.776, Speaker A: No, I think you nailed it.
00:25:05.880 - 00:25:14.924, Speaker B: Cool. Last thing, Avi, this ones for you is you guys have been pretty active in sushi. Im just curious how you think about trading around governance events.
00:25:18.624 - 00:25:36.960, Speaker A: We don't trade governance events when it comes to sushi. We're just buying. We bought it, we're holding it. We're waiting for our thesis thesis to either play out or for us to lose faith. And neither of those things have. Neither of those things have happened yet. I really like the sushi team.
00:25:36.960 - 00:26:33.024, Speaker A: I think that they're doing a fantastic job. There's a recent proposal out to. So something that was interesting, and I'll talk about this for 2 seconds, is there was a recent proposal out to redirect revenue from being paid out to the holders of Sushiswap to the treasury of Sushiswap. And it kind of caused a stir in the community because people were like, what are you doing taking money away from token holders? And the answer is, well, if you only have a year of Runway left in the treasury, and then after a year, protocol might die. Well, it actually makes sense to stop paying out what is effectively a dividend, right? When companies try to grow, they're not going to be paying out massive dividends, they're going to be reinvesting it. And that's really what this is, is Sushiswap is saying, hey guys. So we've entered, we were in really good times in 2021, and because we were in really good times, we do what all normal companies do, which is we pay out a dividend to people.
00:26:33.024 - 00:27:12.684, Speaker A: And now that we're in a really bad time, we actually want to take our money and reinvest it because we think this is a great time to reinvest in our protocol. Right? So that's really what's happening. It's just normal smart course of business. And so we try to just stay abreast and stay involved with governance. And there's some things that happen in governments that are good, and there's some things that happen in government governance that is bad. And you just. I think that's probably the next real way to generate alpha in crypto is to pay attention to what protocols and daos are actually doing.
00:27:12.684 - 00:27:37.484, Speaker A: And so we do, outside of sushi, pay attention to governance pretty actively, because there are a lot of opportunities that pop up when people in Daos do smart things. There are also opportunities that pop up when people in Daos do dumb things. I think the takeaway here is that you just have to start paying attention, and you can get somewhere really good.
00:27:37.604 - 00:27:46.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. We've been writing about, is this the grayishimi remodel? Is that sushi's thing? The Greyshimi remodel?
00:27:47.244 - 00:28:01.206, Speaker A: So that's a token economic revamp. There's a signal proposal up right now to redirect, basically protocol fees. Where should that go?
00:28:01.270 - 00:28:18.154, Speaker B: I just saw in our research our analysts were talking about, like, I think Jared dropped something in the discord about grace. She may. I got to go read about it. So, anyhow, awesome, guys. This has been great. I promise you guys we'd keep this short and sweet, so I'll honor that promise. But, yeah, congrats on the launch of a thousand x podcast.
00:28:18.154 - 00:28:24.478, Speaker B: Santiago will be back next week, guys. So excited about that. And Avi, Jonah, any last words here?
00:28:24.566 - 00:28:28.474, Speaker C: Thanks for welcoming us to the blockworks family. Stoked to be here.
00:28:28.974 - 00:28:30.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate it.
