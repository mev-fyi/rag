00:00:02.520 - 00:00:09.982, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we are live. We've got Santi coming from his parents basement. How are you doing, Santee?
00:00:10.158 - 00:00:11.262, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Yeah.
00:00:11.358 - 00:00:20.474, Speaker C: I've been visiting my family down in Mexico, and I've been here for a few weeks, and in true crypto fashion, I'm literally living in my parents basement.
00:00:21.054 - 00:00:23.566, Speaker B: And so part of the good thing.
00:00:23.590 - 00:00:26.606, Speaker C: Of visiting them is I do have some of my stuff here.
00:00:26.790 - 00:00:30.254, Speaker B: So old crypto memorabilia in March. And this.
00:00:30.294 - 00:00:37.394, Speaker C: This shirt is one of my true coveted possessions, which is DEfcon five shirt.
00:00:39.014 - 00:00:41.914, Speaker A: Is that when you met, met Stani for the first time?
00:00:42.214 - 00:00:44.566, Speaker C: Yeah, I think people have heard me say, yeah, that's right.
00:00:44.710 - 00:00:49.394, Speaker B: I stumped. This is 20, 2019, I think 2019.
00:00:49.734 - 00:00:52.354, Speaker C: And this was the last DeFcon before COVID hit.
00:00:53.334 - 00:00:56.582, Speaker B: And then I remember seeing the booth.
00:00:56.678 - 00:01:02.870, Speaker C: You know, we're still in kind of, like, dormant prices. Crypto wasn't doing much. And I remember seeing the.
00:01:02.902 - 00:01:05.358, Speaker B: The Ave booth lend, I guess, at.
00:01:05.366 - 00:01:13.926, Speaker C: The time was known, and I just thought their gear was their merch. Like, the little funky ghost was really nice. So that captivated my attention. And then I went out and ended.
00:01:13.950 - 00:01:20.402, Speaker B: Up talking Stoney, and then the rest really is history. I ended up joining parafy, reached out.
00:01:20.418 - 00:01:22.530, Speaker C: To Stani, really convinced him to work.
00:01:22.562 - 00:01:33.954, Speaker B: With us, and then Defi just kind of took the world by storm, and everything after that was a blur. But, yeah, it's. It's interesting how you never know which.
00:01:33.994 - 00:01:35.210, Speaker C: Conferences are going to be good or.
00:01:35.242 - 00:01:39.094, Speaker B: Not, but that one, definitely, for me, was very special.
00:01:40.234 - 00:01:54.194, Speaker A: You know, the real takeaway there, though, the real takeaway is you gotta. Is you gotta have good swagger. I remember at permissionless, which, by the way, I think permissionless tickets either just went up or about to go up, but we just launched new speakers.
00:01:54.314 - 00:01:54.706, Speaker B: Hold on.
00:01:54.730 - 00:01:57.082, Speaker A: I actually haven't even seen.
00:01:57.218 - 00:01:57.514, Speaker B: Hold on.
00:01:57.514 - 00:02:12.380, Speaker A: I'm about to plug. All right, check out these. The first speaker lineup. We got Zackie from Somalia talking about Cosmos. We've got Justin Drake, the ETH foundation. We've got Mary, that CEO at Uniswap, Eric Voorhees. Stani is speaking.
00:02:12.380 - 00:02:32.608, Speaker A: Kevin Owocki, meltom. Ben Foreman, Tarun. Colleen Sullivan, Hasu Haseeb. Michalo, the Polygon co founder Ben Jones at optimism, Vanessa from Aglaya Ventures. It's a good squad, good lineup. Shout out to the blockbust team. So there's a permissionless plug.
00:02:32.608 - 00:03:00.746, Speaker A: But I remember at permissionless Dune had these socks that they give away, but they treat socks like, really, um, it's like coveted swag. And I think they do, like, unique swag drops at different conferences, I'm pretty sure is how they do it. And actually, if you go on the dune site, they, uh, they have a lookbook for all their best swag. And I love looking at it because I'm like, oh, that's just like, attention to detail and caring about things that, like, on a balance sheet don't necessarily matter, but get your community fired up.
00:03:00.930 - 00:03:03.530, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. It's not the most expensive swag. It's.
00:03:03.562 - 00:03:06.235, Speaker C: It's sometimes just a really cool, funky swagger.
00:03:06.235 - 00:03:09.604, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. So what's the best conference you've ever been to?
00:03:10.984 - 00:03:12.684, Speaker C: Crypto or just generally?
00:03:13.544 - 00:03:17.764, Speaker A: You tell me. Well, crypto generally or both.
00:03:18.384 - 00:03:50.194, Speaker C: Well, crypto, pretty up there. I think this DeF con was, was great from meeting people, but it was terrible from an organization standpoint. Like, think about this. It was true to ethereum at the time. Etemper is really good. I actually haven't been to that one, but this one was great quality because it was a time where, like, we were talking about scalability and, you know, it was a huge discussion around that. And so a lot of the talks were high quality.
00:03:50.314 - 00:03:52.226, Speaker B: But now imagine that we were talking.
00:03:52.250 - 00:04:04.262, Speaker C: About scalability and congestion in the ethereum network. The conference itself, you had one or two elevators for the entire conference, which were incredibly slow. And so it was just, like, very.
00:04:04.318 - 00:04:06.302, Speaker B: True to, it was just funny because.
00:04:06.358 - 00:04:09.606, Speaker C: We were all complaining about the same thing, which is this, of course, like.
00:04:09.710 - 00:04:11.526, Speaker B: You know, you talk about, like, bottlenecks.
00:04:11.550 - 00:04:22.438, Speaker C: And congestion and, like, the conference itself is like a clusterfuck and so. Yeah, and of course, I love Japan. Osaka was just, it's just a great place. So that one was probably one of.
00:04:22.446 - 00:04:27.544, Speaker B: The best I've heard. I was going to go, but the.
00:04:29.404 - 00:04:34.540, Speaker C: Zero, what is it? Zcash's conference, the first one was in.
00:04:34.572 - 00:04:39.584, Speaker B: Toronto and then in Croatia, but the first one was very good.
00:04:40.364 - 00:04:41.980, Speaker C: Like, and I think you can listen.
00:04:42.012 - 00:04:43.676, Speaker B: To some of the, some of the.
00:04:43.700 - 00:04:46.664, Speaker C: Talks, like, much smaller, really high quality.
00:04:47.044 - 00:04:50.784, Speaker B: Technical, but really high quality. What's yours?
00:04:51.784 - 00:04:56.444, Speaker A: I mean, if I don't plug a blockworks event, I think I'm out of my job.
00:04:57.464 - 00:04:58.324, Speaker B: Permission.
00:04:58.824 - 00:05:34.554, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, permissionless is so. We've hosted Das for years, right? But permissionless was like another, I think permissionless, I'm, I'm as biased as you can get, but permissionless was, like, on another level of a conference that I don't think any crypto conference has been able to achieve. But I also do think some of the, like, more grassroots events, like, I would give a huge shout out to, yeah. Devcon and ETH Denver are the two most like, crypto native events. I think they can use some operational support, but yeah, like, in terms of content and kind of seeing what's coming in the next like 18 months from now, I think those two events do a really good job.
00:05:34.674 - 00:05:52.802, Speaker C: So what I had heard because I missed permissionless, but what I had heard was that you guys, the diversity of the crowd was there because you had a lot of crypto natives, a lot of crypto projects, but also kind of institutions and people coming down from New York and San Francisco and other places to like, meet a lot of these people. So it's a good gathering, I guess.
00:05:52.898 - 00:06:24.550, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's the largest crypto native conference. Like, I think probably coindesk consensus is probably a larger event, but that's like, I wouldn't say it's as crypto native. Anywho, prices are ripping. We got the January effect is in full order. January effect, by the way, for. I don't think this is just a crypto thing, but I think markets in general, basically you have tax loss harvesting in December followed by repurchasing in the new year usually leads to positive price action.
00:06:24.550 - 00:06:53.614, Speaker A: So just looking at the markets today, Lido is up almost 100% on the year. Solana ripping up 70%. ETH is up like ten to 15%, bitcoins up like 5%. If you look at funding rates, funding rates across most of the major tokens have increased this year, marking what could be a change in sentiment from. From perps traders. We just found 5 billion of tokens from FTX who originally thought they only had 1 billion that they could find. Funny how that stuff turns out.
00:06:53.614 - 00:06:59.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Market cap's back above 900 billion. We're looking good, we're looking good. How you feeling?
00:07:01.514 - 00:07:09.106, Speaker C: Obviously, it's nice to see some life in the market and some, you know, I mean.
00:07:09.130 - 00:07:10.930, Speaker B: Yeah, who am I kidding?
00:07:10.962 - 00:07:18.454, Speaker C: Of course it's great to see, you know, a lot of the market up interesting, some of these narratives forming really quickly.
00:07:19.434 - 00:07:22.666, Speaker B: But yeah, I think, you know, what's.
00:07:22.690 - 00:07:38.666, Speaker C: Not, what's not to love when you, you see across your portfolio, you know, in the green. So some of these chats are just pure entertainment, you know, like, you start getting like, a lot of these groups just start coming back to life and.
00:07:38.730 - 00:07:41.794, Speaker A: Oh yeah, we're back. A lot of. A lot of GM's in the chats today.
00:07:41.874 - 00:07:52.914, Speaker C: A lot of my a for last month, like, you know, how are you doing guys like so that. And then one person said, so meat is back on the table, you know, like, not just Robin.
00:07:52.954 - 00:07:54.170, Speaker B: And so, I don't know, I just.
00:07:54.202 - 00:07:55.530, Speaker C: Love the banter and some of these.
00:07:55.562 - 00:07:59.106, Speaker B: Groups, but, yeah, it's great.
00:07:59.250 - 00:08:11.838, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so here's, by the way, I would not be pulling out the leverage longs right now. I know there's some excitement, but might be short lived. So here, to be fair, go ahead.
00:08:11.886 - 00:08:45.574, Speaker C: Well, anyways, no, I was just to be fair, like, you know, you still have like macro in the front seat and you have, you know, a lot of people, like the World bank, like, declaring that this year is going to be a recession across the board consensus. And people, the big question that I am starting to get asked is, so what happens if equity markets continue to go down? What does that do to crypto? And like, everyone's kind of focused on that. So one week of price action. Positive price action is a small data point, but I wouldn't, as you said, the practical advice is, yeah, you probably shouldn't go like ten x levered or do leverage kids.
00:08:45.874 - 00:08:47.322, Speaker B: That usually doesn't end well.
00:08:47.458 - 00:09:15.658, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's what I want to talk about today. We've got, we've got this battle between Gemini and DCG going on. Really kind of this kind of fun public debate between, or not a debate, but battle between billionaires with Cameron Winklevoss representing the left corner and Barry Silbert representing the right corner. So I want to talk about that FTX recovery. Spend a little bit of time on that, maybe a little more crypto native conversations. LSD's in Shanghai.
00:09:15.658 - 00:09:30.894, Speaker A: It's on track. So we can talk about that. Some interesting announcements. Like Coinbase did layoffs, avalanche partnered with AWS, Ondo Finance, brought treasuries on chain. I think it was. Where do you want to start? You want to start with Gemini?
00:09:31.434 - 00:09:32.482, Speaker C: Yeah, let's start.
00:09:32.618 - 00:10:11.826, Speaker A: Cool reminder of the situation for folks who have not been paying attention. Um, basically, Gemini lent, uh, lent almost a billion dollars of funds from over 300,000 users to Genesis, uh, from the Gemini earn program. That capital has been frozen for almost two months now. Um, there was, there's, there, there's been two letters on Twitter. So there's a first letter from Cameron Winklevoss kind of explaining the situation. Second, he and Cameron just published his second open letter on Twitter this week, basically addressing the board of DCG, demanding that Barry Silbert be let go and replace the CEO. There are a couple interesting points in the letter.
00:10:11.826 - 00:11:07.152, Speaker A: The first is that Genesis was left with a $1.2 billion hole after the collateral liquidation from a loan that they made to three AC for 2.36 billion. Also, according to Cameron, Genesis only accepted. This is his claim. I don't know if you can find facts to back this up, but Cameron claims that Genesis only accepted this kind of subpar collateral loan because three AC was using the borrowed money to actually ape into the GBTC spread trade, increasing the AUM and their sister company Grayscale's profits. He also talks about just like, continues on this GBTC trademark, explaining that as GBTC switched from a premium to Nav to a discount, Genesis continued to lend to three arrows with GBTC as collateral to mitigate it from being sold on the open market and furthering the gap.
00:11:07.152 - 00:11:39.064, Speaker A: DCG announced it would assume genesis is liability, but in reality offered a ten year promissory note with a 1% interest, which did not help fill the hole Barry. So that was released at like 08:00 a.m. And then Barry returned with a letter to shareholders. I don't know if you read that later in the afternoon, it was kind of bear market opium. It didn't have, like, any. It was just like, well, you know, we'll get through this, trust me. What do you make of this situation?
00:11:40.244 - 00:11:47.908, Speaker C: Well, I don't have any particular, like, insight into the situation other than what's being publicly discussed between these two folks.
00:11:47.956 - 00:11:51.640, Speaker B: But the fact that Barry is.
00:11:51.792 - 00:11:53.720, Speaker C: What I'm reading into it is Barry's.
00:11:53.792 - 00:11:56.800, Speaker B: Being, you know, at this point, lawyers.
00:11:56.832 - 00:12:11.024, Speaker C: Have taken over the communications of both parties. Barry historically has been someone who's tweeted at will, if you will. Like, he's just, you know, tweets. Like, we just acquired a massive bag of zcash. And, you know, it's going to be a big week.
00:12:11.064 - 00:12:13.096, Speaker B: And, like, when you look at, like.
00:12:13.120 - 00:12:14.904, Speaker C: The change in the way that he's.
00:12:14.944 - 00:12:18.032, Speaker B: Tweeted, I think is pretty indicative of.
00:12:18.048 - 00:12:19.336, Speaker C: The situation, of how dire it is.
00:12:19.360 - 00:12:31.752, Speaker B: And, you know, lawyers are probably, like, heavily, you know, monitoring what he's tweeting now. And also the language that Cameron's letter.
00:12:31.808 - 00:12:39.768, Speaker C: Had, if you look at the prior one versus this one, is, I think it's pretty indicative. I mean, not only in the last one, he used certain, like, keywords, and.
00:12:39.776 - 00:12:41.504, Speaker B: There'S some good tweet, like, threads of.
00:12:41.584 - 00:12:47.438, Speaker C: Like, lawyers kind of dissecting, like, some of these reminder folks, you know, some of the keywords have, like, a very.
00:12:47.526 - 00:12:55.534, Speaker B: Clear, like, I guess, legal implications, if you will.
00:12:55.654 - 00:13:01.342, Speaker C: And in this case, he didn't really hold back. I mean, he just sort of said, this is fraud and Barry should step down.
00:13:01.478 - 00:13:06.794, Speaker B: And I think I tend to.
00:13:08.174 - 00:13:15.876, Speaker C: I tend to believe more of the. I mean, the amount of information and kind of position that the letter of.
00:13:15.900 - 00:13:18.380, Speaker B: Cameron had, I think was pretty insightful.
00:13:18.412 - 00:13:19.824, Speaker C: To see for the first time.
00:13:20.924 - 00:13:22.876, Speaker B: But, yeah, I don't know where this ends.
00:13:22.900 - 00:13:30.436, Speaker C: I mean, we've talked about this in prior episodes of sort of a coordinated action between creditors and kind of trying.
00:13:30.460 - 00:13:45.972, Speaker B: To resolve that situation. There was another Genesis counterparty. I think it was an exchange that refused their plan for repayment that was also announced this week or in the.
00:13:45.988 - 00:13:52.304, Speaker C: Last couple of days. And so I would be really interested to understand what that was to extend.
00:13:53.764 - 00:13:57.100, Speaker B: You know, and how that is being.
00:13:57.132 - 00:13:58.628, Speaker C: Worked out, because at the moment, it.
00:13:58.636 - 00:14:01.836, Speaker B: Just seems like it's pretty dispersed.
00:14:01.860 - 00:14:04.812, Speaker C: I mean, there's a number of creditors. I don't know the number, but you.
00:14:04.828 - 00:14:11.604, Speaker B: Got to believe it's in, you know, I don't know, 2040, 5100.
00:14:12.264 - 00:14:22.604, Speaker C: And I'm not sure how coordinated they are, but I think it would be probably interesting to see how that's shaping up. We talked a lot about this in the episode with FUBAR.
00:14:22.904 - 00:15:21.648, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, so I think we knew that this was happening and, like, Genesis was lending to 3 hours. It's just funny to see Cameron lay it out like this because when you actually just zoom out, I mean, Genesis, it's pretty bad risk return trade here, right? So, like, Genesis was lending money to three arrows so that three arrows could recursively buy bitcoin, swap it for GBTC, post the GBTC as collateral with Genesis to buy more bitcoin and swap it for more GBTC, which, you know, obviously pretty risky. Three arrows was on the wrong end of that trade and blew up. But it also left Genesis with kind of all of the downside of this GBTC arb and none of the upside, right? Like, they're squeaking out, what, 5% or something, and lending to a really risky borrower. So I don't know, just like seeing Cameron lay out the trade like that, I'm like, man, this was not. You were taking a pretty zero sum trade and turning it into what quickly obviously became a negative sum trade.
00:15:21.648 - 00:15:45.704, Speaker A: So I don't know, but I don't know if you read Byron's newsletter this week, but he had a good point on, like, thinking in probabilities and it seems like DCG kind of. And genesis kind of put this like, 100% probability on bitcoin continuing to trend higher. Uh, because this. It all unraveled really quickly. But anyways, seeing Cameron lay it out like this, I was like, man, that was a pretty poor risk reward trade for Genesis here.
00:15:47.004 - 00:15:47.580, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:47.692 - 00:15:49.900, Speaker C: Because reminder, folks, I mean, most of.
00:15:49.932 - 00:15:52.724, Speaker B: My understanding is most of the cash.
00:15:52.764 - 00:15:56.102, Speaker C: Flow, most of the profitability of DCG.
00:15:56.158 - 00:15:59.542, Speaker B: Comes from grayscale, which is the management.
00:15:59.638 - 00:16:01.694, Speaker C: Fees that they're charging on these products.
00:16:01.774 - 00:16:09.518, Speaker B: Like GBTC, the, and some of the other trusts. And so from that perspective, you almost.
00:16:09.566 - 00:16:11.270, Speaker C: Wonder, like, they just kind of milk.
00:16:11.342 - 00:16:17.214, Speaker B: You know, everything was at the focus was, let's just continue to milk this.
00:16:17.294 - 00:16:18.742, Speaker C: Business and at all costs.
00:16:18.758 - 00:16:23.222, Speaker B: And it sounds like they, they were willing to from the very, not the.
00:16:23.238 - 00:16:25.158, Speaker C: Very beginning, but for a while now.
00:16:25.206 - 00:16:31.038, Speaker B: Just continue to, you know, use Genesis as part of that objective.
00:16:31.166 - 00:16:32.366, Speaker C: At all costs, it seems.
00:16:32.430 - 00:16:33.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:33.374 - 00:17:06.054, Speaker C: And so kind of at this point, from a probabilistic standpoint, is they're probably, you know, we were having this discussion in the prior episode, which is, are they going to let Genesis go and how much value is there in Genesis? And I think it's starting to probably become clearer by the day that they're willing to let just Genesis go. And the real focus here is protecting at all cost grayscale, because that continues to be. I read recently they're obviously now looking to probably divest some of their venture portfolio, which is vast.
00:17:06.134 - 00:17:07.194, Speaker B: I mean, it is.
00:17:08.174 - 00:17:27.394, Speaker A: I would probably. It's vast. All right, so it's vast. They've more than 200 investments, biggest exchange like exchanges, banks, custodians, 35 different countries they've invested in. The Financial Times reported that the total value of DCG's venture portfolio is $500 million.
00:17:27.434 - 00:17:28.938, Speaker B: 500 million. That is.
00:17:29.026 - 00:17:32.654, Speaker A: That is so wildly off by like an order of magnitude there.
00:17:34.154 - 00:17:36.774, Speaker B: Yeah. You would have thought it would be much larger.
00:17:37.114 - 00:17:39.362, Speaker A: Far larger. I mean, let me read you some.
00:17:39.378 - 00:17:44.930, Speaker C: What was FTX? FTX Ventures was much, you know, first of all, yeah.
00:17:44.962 - 00:18:13.350, Speaker A: I mean, they've been investing. Let me just read you some of their investments. They have substantial stakes in chainalysis, bitgo, Blockchain.com, comma, brave browser, circle, coinbase, coinmetrics, dune, the graph, Silvergate, Shapeshift, Ledger, Kraken, Paxos, Fireblocks, Etherscan. I think wire, although wire is now a zero. Like, the list goes on. I mean, nearly every company, it's just like DCG is just like an automatic into their cap table.
00:18:13.502 - 00:18:15.142, Speaker C: They're never leading these rounds, though.
00:18:15.198 - 00:18:15.878, Speaker A: They're never leading.
00:18:15.926 - 00:18:16.486, Speaker B: They don't lead.
00:18:16.550 - 00:18:28.382, Speaker A: Yeah. But, you know, they're. They do pretty early deals, too. I just think that's wildly. I mean, what would you, if you had to put a number on it? What do you think?
00:18:28.478 - 00:18:39.016, Speaker C: Well, this goes into the, I'm not sure if that number is deployed capital or mark to market in some way, shape or form. Because if they're trying to assess the.
00:18:39.080 - 00:18:42.400, Speaker B: Current value of that portfolio, then based.
00:18:42.432 - 00:18:48.664, Speaker C: On valuation methodologies and illiquidity discounts, then maybe you get to 500. If you're applying a very steep illiquidity.
00:18:48.704 - 00:18:57.124, Speaker B: Discount on lock tokens or some illiquid positions, then maybe that's how you get to 500.
00:18:59.094 - 00:19:03.918, Speaker C: Or maybe that's just deployed capital. Like they've invested 500 million, which seems reasonable in my mind.
00:19:04.006 - 00:19:07.782, Speaker B: Like, that's still a lot of money to deploy in early stage series, you.
00:19:07.798 - 00:19:10.074, Speaker C: Know, seed and a b.
00:19:11.894 - 00:19:12.966, Speaker B: Over the years.
00:19:13.110 - 00:19:15.514, Speaker C: It's probably correct, I think.
00:19:16.054 - 00:19:19.954, Speaker A: All right, I might be wrong there, but feels low for me. Feels low to me.
00:19:20.534 - 00:19:24.838, Speaker C: Again, the key is you never are marking, say that you invested in, I.
00:19:24.846 - 00:19:26.904, Speaker B: Don'T know, the graphics in some of.
00:19:26.904 - 00:19:31.960, Speaker C: The earlier rounds and then the token launches. You're still locked for like a year at least.
00:19:32.032 - 00:19:37.800, Speaker B: And so you can't, you can't just say, oh, look, this is, you're not.
00:19:37.832 - 00:19:40.128, Speaker C: Marking that position, mark the market because.
00:19:40.216 - 00:19:41.576, Speaker B: It'S illiquid and locked.
00:19:41.600 - 00:19:45.136, Speaker C: And so you're applying, at least this is what I think you should do.
00:19:45.160 - 00:19:56.900, Speaker B: Is you're applying a pretty hefty discount to that position. Like upwards of 50, 60, 70, up to 90%, because some of these tokens have low float.
00:19:56.932 - 00:20:03.384, Speaker C: And so on paper, you would say, wow, they made a killing on the graph, but they haven't really, as an example.
00:20:04.324 - 00:20:31.142, Speaker A: Okay, all right, I might be wrong there. Let's get into FTX. So there was an announcement by leadership. I think it was the second to last, the week before Christmas. I think it was like December 19 or 20th that they could only find a billion dollars. And I think a lot of us on the other end were like, only a billion. That feels small.
00:20:31.142 - 00:21:17.596, Speaker A: I thought you had 8 billion. Now, that's across their venture portfolio and illiquid tokens and stuff, but. Okay, well, where's the rest of the 7 billion? It just came out that FTX has now found 5 billion, which is much closer to the number that both Sam and the guy who took over, whatever his name is, Ray, I think it is. They've both said the number. The total numbers around 8 billion that FTX has now they've located, here's the quote. We have located over 5 billion of cash, liquid, crypto, liquid investment securities measured at petition date value. It does not ascribe any value to holdings of dozens of illiquid crypto tokens where our holdings are so large relative to the total supply of our positions that we cannot, they cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token.
00:21:17.596 - 00:21:27.384, Speaker A: So I would say this is a good announcement. This is a pretty positive announcement that we've located more of the money. So it's good to see this.
00:21:28.764 - 00:21:31.984, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think there's.
00:21:33.644 - 00:21:35.476, Speaker B: I was not sure.
00:21:35.620 - 00:21:47.974, Speaker C: There's some, there's some trading or like they're pegging like the price of recovery. I think there's a market for that. And it's trading at like $0.17 on the dollar. I think it went all the way down to 810.
00:21:49.154 - 00:21:52.054, Speaker A: Wait, explain that to me. There's $0.10 on the dollar for what?
00:21:52.994 - 00:22:06.506, Speaker C: Presumably, if you have, if you're owed capital and money there, you could sell your position. Or at least people are pricing it this way in terms of how much you're going to recover. For every dollar that you have stuck.
00:22:06.530 - 00:22:09.768, Speaker B: In FTX at the moment, it's, it's.
00:22:09.816 - 00:22:11.832, Speaker C: Being priced at like $0.17.
00:22:11.968 - 00:22:12.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:13.264 - 00:22:14.696, Speaker C: So if you have $100, you're gonna.
00:22:14.720 - 00:22:16.244, Speaker B: Get, you know, 17 back.
00:22:16.864 - 00:22:20.664, Speaker C: Now, I think for the, which is, which is people are saying it was.
00:22:20.744 - 00:22:26.696, Speaker B: Probably lower than that. Like it got all the way down to eight.
00:22:26.800 - 00:22:29.496, Speaker C: Like $0.08 for every dollar, not $0.08.
00:22:29.520 - 00:22:36.228, Speaker B: For a. Yeah, the interesting thing is, like, you're comparing it.
00:22:36.276 - 00:22:48.452, Speaker C: I think one of the interesting things, like, in that I didn't know, but I learned during this process, is that the Madoff trustees, I think, ended up recovering years, like ten years later, like seventy five cents. I think you were the one that.
00:22:48.468 - 00:22:57.092, Speaker B: Said this, like 75, $0.85 on the dollar, which is pretty good. I mean, of course it took, you.
00:22:57.108 - 00:22:59.156, Speaker C: Know, time value, money and opportunity cost.
00:22:59.220 - 00:23:01.414, Speaker B: But still it's fairly good, I guess.
00:23:03.034 - 00:23:09.754, Speaker C: Considering even Mount Gox, people that have, that were affected by Mount Gox haven't even seen a single bitcoin back.
00:23:09.914 - 00:23:15.810, Speaker B: And so this is fairly positive if you're getting some capital back.
00:23:15.922 - 00:23:18.614, Speaker C: And I wonder how much time that's going to take.
00:23:19.794 - 00:23:22.090, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's looking a little bit.
00:23:22.122 - 00:23:26.686, Speaker C: More promising than what it initially started, some people saying.
00:23:26.830 - 00:23:49.994, Speaker A: So I just looked up the 5 million or 5 billion of what they're saying is worth 5 billion. Now. I'm not so positive on this. Let me read it to you. 700 million of Solana. Most of that is locked. 575 million of FTT 371 of maps, 127 of oxy, 90 million of rap bitcoin, 82 million of bona, and about 500 million in random other, like, spl tokens.
00:23:49.994 - 00:23:56.744, Speaker A: That is not a liquid 5 billion. That is. I don't know who's taken 575 million off the market right now.
00:23:57.604 - 00:24:00.424, Speaker B: Yeah. No, no.
00:24:01.244 - 00:24:02.668, Speaker C: We talked about this in a great.
00:24:02.716 - 00:24:06.624, Speaker B: Episode with on the terror situation.
00:24:06.964 - 00:24:10.196, Speaker C: One of the more interesting things that you got to think about is whenever.
00:24:10.220 - 00:24:13.756, Speaker B: You'Re thinking about, like, say, you have.
00:24:13.860 - 00:24:15.988, Speaker C: A large position in a particular project.
00:24:16.076 - 00:24:18.476, Speaker B: Like, you can't take spot and then.
00:24:18.500 - 00:24:23.652, Speaker C: Multiply by the number of tokens you have. It's like, what is the transacted value that you can actually exit this position.
00:24:23.708 - 00:24:27.482, Speaker B: In a graceful manner? And that, that is more, as you.
00:24:27.498 - 00:24:34.098, Speaker C: Said, like, you can't really sell some of these random tokens and get that principal, like, you know, that amount back.
00:24:34.146 - 00:24:37.254, Speaker B: And so. Yeah.
00:24:38.714 - 00:24:40.854, Speaker A: Did you read Sam's sub stack?
00:24:41.954 - 00:24:43.514, Speaker C: I was trying to get through it.
00:24:43.674 - 00:24:44.934, Speaker B: I assume you did.
00:24:46.234 - 00:25:13.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I did. I want to save you guys the hassle of reading it, because you should not go read. You should not spend another second reading what Sam has to say. So here are some of the takeaways. Basically, when the bankruptcy was filed, FTX, there was a decent bit of talk about FTX us. So FTX us had excess liquidity, which is above. Like, what that means is, like, above one to one coverage of customer assets in the range of, like, I think it was 350 million.
00:25:13.854 - 00:25:51.154, Speaker A: He said that FTX us held. I think it was like 500 million in customer asset. I forget if the number is 350 or 500. Also said that FTX us was completely solvent with a significant buffer. I think what he was trying to show by talking about FTX us was that FTX us would have been fine if it didn't get looped into all of this, that they could have basically just severed FTX us, like, the day all this went down and, like, pushed FTX us to the side. Ftx us would have been totally fine, but FtX, the normal FTx would have gone down. I think that's what he was trying to show by doing that.
00:25:51.154 - 00:26:14.514, Speaker A: He also mentioned FTX trading had about 8 billion in assets when Ray took over. That's, like, in the ballpark of what the Ray and his team have said. A lot of rehashing of, like, how and why Alameda went under. They're just another domino victim of crypto winter. This is a CZPR campaign. This all actually would've been fine if. But, like, I got the, like, the lawyers pushed me out.
00:26:14.514 - 00:26:29.534, Speaker A: I had a plan to fix this. He said that no funds were stolen. This is where it got kind of wild. It's like, no funds were stolen. He's like, we had a clean gap audit for 2020 and 2021. He's like, billions in funding offers were coming in. When Ray took over.
00:26:29.534 - 00:26:55.984, Speaker A: That's where I was like, all right, all right, buddy, you should probably sit down here. So, yeah, I think there's still this, like, glaring omission in from both Sam and from Ray, which is that there's no indication of what the total customer deposits at FTX trading were. So while there are estimates of assets that seem to be kind of coalescing around the eight to $10 billion number, we still really don't know the size of the hole.
00:26:57.844 - 00:27:01.028, Speaker B: Yeah, speaking of, I'm not sure if.
00:27:01.036 - 00:27:07.744, Speaker C: We'Re going to talk about this, but a few hours ago, it was just announced that Nexo's offices in Bulgaria and Sophia, the capital city, got raided.
00:27:09.994 - 00:27:11.294, Speaker B: I don't know if you saw that.
00:27:12.074 - 00:27:19.146, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, look, Nexo came out with a communication. Apparently, it's tied. The investigation has been going on for.
00:27:19.170 - 00:27:26.106, Speaker B: A couple months, and, you know, Nexo employed over 30 compliance folks, and apparently.
00:27:26.130 - 00:27:32.114, Speaker C: It'S tied to some sort of breaching of KYC ML, like, sanction laws.
00:27:32.154 - 00:27:35.634, Speaker B: And so, um, yeah, they're being investigated now.
00:27:36.494 - 00:27:45.758, Speaker A: I will just say when something like this comes out, and the, like, an agency is like, oh, we're investigating because of KYC AML. Oftentimes, that's not the reason.
00:27:45.926 - 00:27:46.374, Speaker B: The.
00:27:46.454 - 00:27:58.434, Speaker A: It's like a. That's their door in. They're like, they need a reason to investigate a company. So they'll be like, they probably found that they broke a Kyc AML thing. So they're like, boom, that's our reason to go look under the hood.
00:27:59.094 - 00:27:59.954, Speaker C: I see.
00:28:00.334 - 00:28:00.830, Speaker A: Um.
00:28:00.902 - 00:28:05.154, Speaker C: Like, it's just like, it's. It's probably the easiest way to get a search warrant.
00:28:05.774 - 00:28:29.018, Speaker A: Look, I don't know what's going on with Nexo. Let me just say this. Blockfi is down. Genesis is down. Every single other competitor who runs a business just like Nexo is down. They continued offering, like, not just, like, 3% yields or 5% yields, but these, like, ludicrous eight to 12% yields until, like, a month or two ago. So I don't know anything.
00:28:29.018 - 00:28:53.354, Speaker A: I never. I hope that Nexo is fine. I hope that especially the users and customers of Nexo are fine. If you still have money on Nexo, I probably recommend you keep that stuff safe, but I'm just skeptical of how can one business, only one business, make it and every single other one of your competitors fail? That's. I'm just questioning this.
00:28:54.494 - 00:28:55.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:55.286 - 00:28:56.222, Speaker C: Let me ask you, like, a.
00:28:56.278 - 00:28:58.078, Speaker B: Like, take a pause, and I'll ask.
00:28:58.086 - 00:29:01.998, Speaker C: You a question, because this goes back to what you asked me at the very beginning, like, how you are feeling.
00:29:02.046 - 00:29:04.430, Speaker B: Generally about crypto, but, like, how hard.
00:29:04.462 - 00:29:06.006, Speaker C: Has it been for you to see.
00:29:06.070 - 00:29:11.582, Speaker B: All of this go down and, like, have you lost faith, a, in crypto.
00:29:11.638 - 00:29:21.146, Speaker C: B, of the people working in crypto? And how does that compare it to, like, there have always been, like, scams, not just in crypto. You just see them more visibly in.
00:29:21.170 - 00:29:24.586, Speaker B: Crypto, I think, but has.
00:29:24.650 - 00:29:27.658, Speaker C: How hard has been to just see the amount of, like, destruction?
00:29:27.706 - 00:29:30.854, Speaker B: And I guess this just felt like.
00:29:31.434 - 00:29:33.490, Speaker C: You know, every single poster child of.
00:29:33.522 - 00:29:48.710, Speaker B: Crypto that was glorified by the media is some way, shape or form just got too caught up and. And too greedy and is blown up. Hmm. Let's see.
00:29:48.742 - 00:29:49.014, Speaker A: I think.
00:29:49.054 - 00:29:51.510, Speaker C: Does that weigh down on you, your team morale?
00:29:51.582 - 00:30:00.822, Speaker A: No. So, no. So, no, no, no, it does. It doesn't weigh down on me at all, actually. It doesn't. Like, I don't. I think there's actually a feeling of embarrassment.
00:30:00.822 - 00:30:17.740, Speaker A: There's not a feeling of disheartenment. I'm not disheartened. I'm not. I think there's an initial feeling of, like, actually anger and, like, being really pissed off with folks like Doe and Mashinsky and Sue.
00:30:17.852 - 00:30:18.540, Speaker B: Sam.
00:30:18.692 - 00:30:38.608, Speaker A: Sam. Like, those folks, like, an initial feeling of, like, pissed off and anger because you and I know so many people who lost so much money. Right? Like, we have. We've invested in companies, and they've gotten hurt. Like, we have. I have friends who, you know, came into the industry at the exact same time as me. They lost 99% of the crypto that they have.
00:30:38.608 - 00:31:06.308, Speaker A: And there I'm getting messages being like, look, I don't really know what the last six years of my life were for. Like, I don't have anything that I've all the. All the things I've built up over the last six years. The company I built and the people, the company I worked at that I helped build and the money that I've made, I have none of it. So what was I just doing with? So that's really, really upsetting to see. And then it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing when I'm out, like, a dinner and I've been.
00:31:06.308 - 00:31:20.612, Speaker A: I'm the crypto person, obviously. And I've been talking about these great companies and then the, what the people see in the headlines is, like, FTX and Blockfi and Genesis and DCG and these billionaires fighting on Twitter. It looks like a joke. It looks like a joke.
00:31:20.748 - 00:31:21.492, Speaker B: But what.
00:31:21.588 - 00:32:03.054, Speaker A: What overpowers all of that by an order of magnitude is seeing things like the Friday Ethereum, all core devs call, talking about the Shanghai upgrade being on track for a march activation, and talking to chow about the future of, like, wallets, and seeing brands continuing to push into crypto and having that call with Eigen lair that you and I were on. Um, just being like, look, I don't know if Eigen layer is going to make it, but, like, what? But I don't have conviction there. But, like, just seeing that there are amazing founders and builders building this stuff and. Yeah, that optimism, like, way overpowers and overweights this feeling of, like, disenchantment and embarrassment.
00:32:04.514 - 00:32:25.250, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way. It's sometimes hard to see how many people have been affected this time and the sheer, like, number of wealth destruction, I guess. But I think it's different than price going down. It's a whole dude game where you have been defrauded.
00:32:25.282 - 00:32:28.106, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it's tough, but, no.
00:32:28.130 - 00:32:29.054, Speaker C: I agree with you.
00:32:29.874 - 00:33:07.980, Speaker A: I also think that every industry, I think reading history helps with this. Reading about early days of the railroad industry, reading about the early days of the Internet in the nineties, when the Internet was starting to get. Become more corporate, reading about the early days of the oil industry, there were pretty raging scams in all of these industries and these huge fraudsters, but less money associated with it because those industries were like, basically there was a harder asset and the money was one step removed. So, like, you have oil. Oil is not directly money, but it.
00:33:08.132 - 00:33:08.540, Speaker B: But it.
00:33:08.572 - 00:33:25.724, Speaker A: So the money is one step removed. Or, like, railroad, same thing, a lot of money. But like the railroads, not a money. Even the Internet, the core asset of the Internet is information, and money is one step removed. The core asset inside of crypto is money. So when you have a fraud, it like, it. Money touches everything in crypto.
00:33:25.724 - 00:33:37.788, Speaker A: So, um, yeah, these fraud people end up like, there's just more money at risk earlier on in an industry. So every industry this early on has frauds, but because this is a money driven industry. Yeah.
00:33:37.836 - 00:33:44.740, Speaker C: So, anyways, I think my last takeaway from this is like, if you look.
00:33:44.772 - 00:33:57.554, Speaker B: At most of the crypto collapses, nine out of ten, or all of them have been a rejection of the old system, trying to work within the confines of what is crypto.
00:33:59.214 - 00:34:00.942, Speaker C: You know, you look at businesses that.
00:34:00.958 - 00:34:07.598, Speaker B: Were not transparent, that were heavily centralized, that had, you know, backdoors, and, you.
00:34:07.606 - 00:34:11.234, Speaker C: Know, that's not the ethos. That's not crypto. That's a crypto service provider.
00:34:12.954 - 00:34:15.682, Speaker B: And so I think it's pretty.
00:34:15.738 - 00:34:28.890, Speaker C: I think we'll be very symbolic. We'll look back and say, yeah, this is a time where we try to implement old practices that go counter to the ethos of decentralization, of what crypto really stands for, of self custodying your.
00:34:28.922 - 00:34:32.210, Speaker B: Assets, of managing and being in control.
00:34:32.282 - 00:34:34.722, Speaker C: And fully transparent smart contracts that execute.
00:34:34.738 - 00:34:39.415, Speaker B: A certain logic that you kind of, you're just trusting what is in the.
00:34:39.439 - 00:34:43.527, Speaker C: Code and not necessarily where you're depositing and whoever's custodying your assets.
00:34:43.575 - 00:34:47.455, Speaker B: And I think in many ways, if.
00:34:47.479 - 00:34:49.391, Speaker C: This industry is really going to grow.
00:34:49.527 - 00:34:53.791, Speaker B: By orders of magnitude, then you better off happen it.
00:34:53.847 - 00:34:56.031, Speaker C: Now we learn this kind of lesson.
00:34:56.167 - 00:34:58.599, Speaker B: Which I think has been more and more.
00:34:58.631 - 00:35:03.647, Speaker C: I think people, even in traditional mainstream media, and people are starting to appreciate.
00:35:03.695 - 00:35:06.662, Speaker B: What decentralization actually means and putting a.
00:35:06.678 - 00:35:07.662, Speaker C: Finer point on that.
00:35:07.718 - 00:35:17.150, Speaker B: So I think that's the kind of positive of all this, which I think will set us up nicely for continued.
00:35:17.182 - 00:35:18.394, Speaker C: Growth over the years.
00:35:21.534 - 00:35:50.096, Speaker A: Here's where I would be disheartened, Santi, is if AAve went down or maker failed to continue producing Dai or Uniswap couldn't operate in the US, or like, if actually that could happen, but, like, if Uniswap went down or something like that. Like that, then. Then I'm like, oh, man, I don't trust. I don't trust the blockfi's and nexus of the world. But, you know, I do trust Aave, and then I don't shoot. Well, now I can't trust Ave.
00:35:50.120 - 00:35:50.280, Speaker B: It's.
00:35:50.312 - 00:35:52.280, Speaker A: Well, then it's like, okay, well, what do we. What are we doing here?
00:35:52.312 - 00:36:24.880, Speaker C: So anyways, well, I guess the cynic could say, hey, listen, there's been like 5 billion of hat, or like, I think it's between four or 5 billion of hacks. A lot of them happened last year. You know, the Ronan Bridge act was 600 million and a few others that were, you know, and so, you know, that. That, to me, is where I tend to focus a lot of my attention, which is, hey, we really need to get security and come up with better standards, services that can help people just if everyone's going to move on chain, if there's a version of this world.
00:36:24.912 - 00:36:27.886, Speaker B: Where that happens, then we need to.
00:36:28.070 - 00:36:30.354, Speaker C: Have better solutions in place.
00:36:30.814 - 00:37:00.972, Speaker A: So. Agree. But something like the Ronin hack was like, those bridges were like six months old, or like twelve months old Max. And that's when I'm like, I know what it's like to build a startup that's like six months after launch. It is a total shitshow. So it's like, that's where I'm going to in crypto. In every other world, every other industry, every point in history, when you have a startup that's six months old, if something goes wrong, something fails, a product breaks, maybe people have to get laid off something.
00:37:00.972 - 00:37:43.164, Speaker A: But you don't lose money necessarily. Like, it's not directly losing money in this situation. If a bridge goes down, yeah, you could lose a hundred, there's 100 million on the bridge. But like crypto is weird in that way. So yeah, yeah, we could probably do a better job of like not putting half a billion onto something that's a year old. So let's talk about something optimistic though, which is the Friday ETH, all core devs call that gave us further evidence that the Shanghai upgrade is on track for a march activation, which is super exciting. Basically Shanghai, and like TLDR on Shanghai is that it allows withdrawals from the Ethan, the Ethan, the Ethereum beacon chain.
00:37:43.164 - 00:38:27.634, Speaker A: And I think the why behind this event is everyone's looking at how much basically about what's going to happen with, with staking. Right? Like given that there's a large amount of ETH that will become liquid. Like, what basically happens with withdrawals, is there going to be short term sell pressure? There's, there's two, there's two ways this could go, right? There's either going to be like short term sell pressure, but a greater incentive to stake. There's either going to be like less money staked or everyone's going to say, oh crap, now this is liquid. Let me, let me stake more assets. So I'm really curious to hear what, I don't know if you have a take on this yet, but do you think this will in the short term, like drive more amount of staking, less staking? What do you think here?
00:38:30.414 - 00:38:33.870, Speaker B: I mean, it's difficult to, I can't.
00:38:33.902 - 00:38:47.474, Speaker C: Pretend to understand where crypto is going to be in the short term, but I think it's quite positive to finally, it's another further step in this transition to prefer work and freeing up like the locked ETH deposits in the beacon chain.
00:38:47.934 - 00:38:51.714, Speaker B: And then you have, I think it net very positive.
00:38:53.054 - 00:38:56.470, Speaker C: What it will do in the short term TBD, I've seen some analysis that.
00:38:56.502 - 00:38:57.406, Speaker B: You know, now you're going to have.
00:38:57.430 - 00:39:03.262, Speaker C: A true staking yield, which might be quite interesting how that dynamic plays out. One of the things that I would.
00:39:03.278 - 00:39:08.326, Speaker B: Be looking at is the amount of ETH staked and the yield and relative.
00:39:08.390 - 00:39:10.514, Speaker C: To other opportunities that you can get.
00:39:11.254 - 00:39:14.926, Speaker B: Within crypto and outside of crypto, for.
00:39:14.950 - 00:39:17.006, Speaker C: Instance, people are comparing the e staking.
00:39:17.070 - 00:39:22.206, Speaker B: Yield with treasuries, and it's kind of a irrelevant comparison.
00:39:22.310 - 00:39:38.224, Speaker C: It's not, but you probably shouldn't be comparing it to risk free rate. But, yeah, I think it will drive probably now that you have a more liquid market, um, and more fluid, uh, staking and unstaking.
00:39:38.304 - 00:39:47.552, Speaker B: I think, uh, it is, it is very positive for just Ethereum's network. Um, and so, yeah, I mean, you.
00:39:47.568 - 00:39:56.352, Speaker C: Could be in a situation where a lot of the ETH continues to be staked, and the float, combined with the deflationary pressures that you probably have seen.
00:39:56.448 - 00:40:07.834, Speaker B: Uh, um, just creates a situation where there's far less ETH circulating and that is not being staked, which for every.
00:40:07.874 - 00:40:14.154, Speaker C: Incremental dollar that comes into the space is just like the sensitivity. So you might have just a more.
00:40:14.194 - 00:40:21.570, Speaker B: Volatile asset, you know what I mean? So that could create short term volatility.
00:40:21.722 - 00:40:58.284, Speaker A: I love this Ryan Watkins tweet. He said, it's undeniable that Ethereum upgrades and innovation cycles are the leading drivers of crypto markets now far more than bitcoin havings. If you're not paying attention to Ethereum, you'll have a hard time understanding where we're going. And as more and more of the industry gets built on top of Ethereum, and I just think that becomes the driver it's going to be. You and I have talked about this, I think, offline, but bitcoin having has always been the big driver. It's always one of the big things that ends up kicking off this usually a delayed bull market, maybe six to twelve months later. But I think that this could be.
00:40:58.284 - 00:41:02.030, Speaker A: I think he's got a point here. Yeah, yeah.
00:41:02.062 - 00:41:08.070, Speaker C: It's one is just like, oh, like it's a so what event. The old one is more, far more.
00:41:08.102 - 00:41:10.594, Speaker B: Interesting from an innovation perspective.
00:41:11.614 - 00:41:17.694, Speaker A: Also, I think we've been ragging on bitcoin too much recently. We're gonna. We'll give it a break in this episode.
00:41:17.734 - 00:41:35.022, Speaker C: Well, no, I think you were gonna say like, the amount of tweets is flipped, right? You know, there's a great chart showing a number of tweets, bitcoin relative to Ethereum, it's flipped recently. I think it's the first time it's actually crossed. And there are more. There are more ETH related tweets and there are bitcoin.
00:41:35.118 - 00:41:39.654, Speaker B: And so, again, I'm not entirely sure.
00:41:39.774 - 00:41:45.830, Speaker C: How the calculation goes behind the scenes, but not surprising, right, that there's just so much to talk about in Ethereum.
00:41:45.862 - 00:41:49.974, Speaker B: Land and everything going on in the ecosystem relative to what's going on in bitcoin.
00:41:50.134 - 00:41:52.436, Speaker C: Not to dismiss anything that's going on in bitcoin.
00:41:52.550 - 00:42:18.432, Speaker A: We. Some of the. Some of the updates to liquid staking are a little out of my realm of understanding, honestly. Like, there was a, like, rocket pool just added. Rocket pool is another liquid staking derivative provider. They just added Coinbase ventures to their odao. My understanding, the Odao is like, it's a bunch of community members who run these special oracle nodes that transmit data from the beacon chain to ETH one in order for the protocol to function properly and safely.
00:42:18.432 - 00:42:35.964, Speaker A: Some of that stuff is definitely out of my league of understanding. So actually, shout out to our producer Garrett. He's lining up a couple of liquid staking episodes where we're going to get a little deeper instead of you and you and me pontificating on things that I at least don't fully. I'm not fully able to talk about.
00:42:36.744 - 00:42:39.104, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:42:39.264 - 00:42:45.080, Speaker C: I mean, I was running a validator way back in the day when Taser launched and a few others.
00:42:45.192 - 00:42:47.484, Speaker A: Yeah, you were validator.
00:42:48.124 - 00:42:48.884, Speaker C: A baker.
00:42:48.964 - 00:42:52.036, Speaker B: A baker, yeah. And then. Yeah.
00:42:52.060 - 00:42:55.476, Speaker C: That got me thinking into, like, how liquid staking derivatives were gonna have.
00:42:55.500 - 00:42:56.900, Speaker B: This was like three years ago.
00:42:57.052 - 00:42:58.100, Speaker C: More than three years ago.
00:42:58.212 - 00:43:00.664, Speaker A: When. Yeah, when. When did you spin up your first.
00:43:00.964 - 00:43:01.276, Speaker B: When.
00:43:01.300 - 00:43:02.544, Speaker A: When did you start doing this?
00:43:04.404 - 00:43:07.144, Speaker C: End of 2018. 2019.
00:43:08.764 - 00:43:10.780, Speaker B: We try to, me and a couple.
00:43:10.812 - 00:43:12.508, Speaker C: Other folks that I know in the.
00:43:12.556 - 00:43:15.234, Speaker B: In the space, we didn't feel comfortable.
00:43:15.274 - 00:43:16.650, Speaker C: Delegating, and so we wanted to spin.
00:43:16.682 - 00:43:19.122, Speaker B: Up our own, and that got us.
00:43:19.138 - 00:43:25.134, Speaker C: Into a pretty interesting journey, thinking about, like, the regulatory implications of staking versus mining.
00:43:25.554 - 00:43:26.294, Speaker B: And.
00:43:28.514 - 00:43:33.962, Speaker C: One of the best things that came out of that was the proof of stake alliance, which Evan, who then ended up going to Bison trails and.
00:43:33.978 - 00:43:38.434, Speaker B: Then now got acquired by Coinbase, that.
00:43:38.474 - 00:43:44.614, Speaker C: Organization, really, to advocate for staking and clarity on the tax side of things, on the kind of money transmitter side of things.
00:43:45.694 - 00:43:46.982, Speaker B: Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
00:43:47.118 - 00:44:10.514, Speaker C: Back then, it was my ops, like, back then, it was like, a few people thinking, talking about it, but we were just too early in the game. A lot of the folks that continued in this path, like, figment and bison trails and staked, have done exceptionally well. It's a great business, I think, and then. But the good thing about that is I ended up, like, doing the seed run for Lido when I was paraphrasing, so that was.
00:44:10.834 - 00:44:11.974, Speaker B: That was pretty good.
00:44:12.634 - 00:44:24.014, Speaker A: Not too shabby, huh? Let me ask you this. Okay, so what. You don't have to say specific numbers, but, like, what range did parafy get that Lido token at?
00:44:28.674 - 00:44:32.162, Speaker C: I'm not sure it's public, but it was probably one of the best deals.
00:44:32.178 - 00:44:36.774, Speaker B: That I did by far. Like, it was.
00:44:37.144 - 00:44:43.184, Speaker C: It was a small round, and it was a very well constructed round, and a lot of people ended up passing on that.
00:44:43.264 - 00:44:46.632, Speaker B: I just thought it was. You know, we got a lot of.
00:44:46.648 - 00:44:50.568, Speaker C: The large theorem holders involved, a lot of angels, a lot of, like, other.
00:44:50.616 - 00:44:54.072, Speaker B: Projects, and we were one of the.
00:44:54.088 - 00:44:58.164, Speaker C: Few funds that, like, probably committed, if not the largest, the second largest check.
00:44:58.944 - 00:45:03.324, Speaker B: But it was. You know, I had.
00:45:03.684 - 00:45:36.784, Speaker C: I had known the team from my days when I started staking, and these guys were the best. They were winning the game of stakes competition, which is the cosmos incentivize testnet to attack, basically, the network. And that's how I knew the Coralido team, because I just thought they were the smartest guys to spin up validators and had a very deep understanding of how to run, like, proper infrastructure. And then, like, Constantine, I'm not sure if we've had him on this podcast.
00:45:36.824 - 00:45:38.440, Speaker B: I think we may have.
00:45:38.472 - 00:45:45.472, Speaker C: All right. I've been on a certain podcast, a few podcasts with Constantine. He's just a very. One of the smartest guys out there. He's one of the co founders of.
00:45:45.488 - 00:45:51.056, Speaker B: Lido and early in Ethereum, early in.
00:45:51.080 - 00:46:00.658, Speaker C: Solana, like, very open minded, and has been involved in a lot of networks. And so that, to me, again, it's always a team bet. And so these guys are probably were the smartest, and that's what gave me.
00:46:00.666 - 00:46:03.322, Speaker B: A lot of conviction to back them at the time.
00:46:03.458 - 00:46:15.854, Speaker A: Nice. So what does a fund like parafy do? How do you think about. We don't have to talk about parafy, but, like, maybe we'll generalize crypto funds. So how do you think about selling that lido?
00:46:18.194 - 00:46:33.640, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very, like, it's a very good question. You know, risk management in crypto and managing portfolio is quite difficult in the sense that there could be a time.
00:46:33.672 - 00:46:37.864, Speaker C: Where a token just grows to a certain threshold, where it becomes just prudent.
00:46:37.904 - 00:46:43.416, Speaker B: To size it down. When you have a position that ends.
00:46:43.440 - 00:46:45.304, Speaker C: Up becoming greater than 10% of your.
00:46:45.344 - 00:47:02.570, Speaker B: 510, 20% of your funds, then I think you have to, at that point, think more systematically of saying, you know, it's probably prudent to size down that position. Some funds do it, some others don't.
00:47:02.762 - 00:47:09.250, Speaker C: In venture, it's. It's different because, say that you were benchmark, you did the seed round of.
00:47:09.282 - 00:47:11.122, Speaker B: Uber, and you had a, you kind.
00:47:11.138 - 00:47:37.514, Speaker C: Of could wait ten years, maybe try to sell in the secondary market. But once it ipos, you have, like, this lockup, and you can sell after that. So obviously, there's, like, lockup considerations that, you know, you have to, you know, they just exist similar, like, in traditional markets, at least a year, you're vesting over multiple years, three, five, seven years. So that's the more practical consideration. But.
00:47:38.014 - 00:47:39.554, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's. It's very.
00:47:40.174 - 00:48:09.968, Speaker C: It is the hardest thing to do to be fair, like, managing that relationship with the team and saying, hey, look, I've had difficult conversations where I say, listen, it's not that I don't like the project. It's just that it's grown up as a point where it's just too big of a position. And at that point, it's like, okay, can you find a natural seller? And the way to do that, sometimes a team wants to buy it back. Other times you find another fund that's wanting to take over the position. Yeah, it just depends on your strategy.
00:48:10.016 - 00:48:13.568, Speaker B: But it's really hard. I don't have a good answer to that.
00:48:13.736 - 00:48:25.404, Speaker A: Yeah, Lido, when, like, I don't know what you like. The live token price was in January of 2021, I think, at, like, $2, and now it's back to $2.
00:48:25.784 - 00:48:26.320, Speaker B: I'm curious.
00:48:26.352 - 00:48:29.048, Speaker A: Just obviously not financial advice, et cetera, et cetera.
00:48:29.096 - 00:48:29.976, Speaker B: Wild swings.
00:48:30.120 - 00:48:42.084, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, yeah. Ran up to six or $7 and then fell down to, like, fifty cents, and now it's back up to $2. How do you think about allocating to an asset like Lido right now?
00:48:48.704 - 00:48:56.524, Speaker C: Well, Lido specifically in terms of category, liquid staking, or just generally NASA that has that amount of volatility.
00:48:58.064 - 00:49:02.824, Speaker A: I'm not talking about volatility. I'm talking about basically, do you like Lido right now at $2?
00:49:04.164 - 00:49:09.064, Speaker B: I don't have a view on that. Like, no. Cool.
00:49:10.484 - 00:49:14.140, Speaker A: Pushed it one step too far on the not investment.
00:49:14.252 - 00:49:18.828, Speaker C: No, listen, I get asked this question all the time.
00:49:18.876 - 00:49:27.440, Speaker B: Right. And my response is, why you asked me this question. And it's, what's your investment horizon?
00:49:27.532 - 00:49:28.336, Speaker C: Is it three months?
00:49:28.400 - 00:49:31.484, Speaker B: Is it one day is it three years? Is it ten years?
00:49:31.944 - 00:49:39.128, Speaker C: And so I tweeted about this earlier this week. It's like, it's, again, impossible to understand where even the majors are going to.
00:49:39.136 - 00:49:40.244, Speaker B: Be in three months.
00:49:41.464 - 00:49:43.808, Speaker C: Three months. Where is bitcoin going to be?
00:49:43.896 - 00:50:08.580, Speaker A: Let me rephrase my question, because I'm not actually worried about the, I'm not really asking about the price of Lido. Here's a better question. Lido is the dominant liquid staking provider. If you want to go long liquid staking providers right now. And you think liquid lsds are going to be a bigger thing in the future, like, Lido feels like a pretty good play. However, they're starting to face a lot of competition, like Cbeth and like Rocket Pool. Rocket pool and things like that.
00:50:08.580 - 00:50:15.544, Speaker A: And there's going to be more and more. How do you think Lido fares versus other competitors in the future?
00:50:17.444 - 00:50:20.488, Speaker C: I think the team, as I said earlier, is the strongest.
00:50:20.676 - 00:50:21.444, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:22.064 - 00:50:28.528, Speaker C: I haven't looked as closely into rocket pool. They've had some issues as is Lido, to be fair.
00:50:28.576 - 00:50:30.752, Speaker B: Like, the question that has come up.
00:50:30.768 - 00:50:31.792, Speaker C: Over and over is the amount of.
00:50:31.808 - 00:50:34.592, Speaker B: Concentration and power that Lido has in.
00:50:34.608 - 00:50:39.804, Speaker C: Terms of, like, it's become the second largest or the largest largest decentralized.
00:50:41.184 - 00:50:44.880, Speaker B: And the question is, should I of.
00:50:44.912 - 00:50:52.340, Speaker C: The mind that competition in the staking as a service space is very positive and healthy for a network, because you.
00:50:52.372 - 00:50:54.708, Speaker B: Never want, it's like a fair victory.
00:50:54.756 - 00:50:56.664, Speaker C: If Lido captures 100% of the market.
00:50:57.164 - 00:50:58.704, Speaker B: That would be a terrible outcome.
00:50:59.084 - 00:51:02.344, Speaker C: You never want that to happen purely for decentralization reasons.
00:51:02.764 - 00:51:05.812, Speaker B: And so for that reason, I want.
00:51:05.828 - 00:51:16.454, Speaker C: To see other providers succeed, and I want there to be variety, because that it creates a very healthy competitive market. Now, Peter Theo might look at me and laugh and say, what an idiot. You want invest in monopolies, but not in crypto.
00:51:16.574 - 00:51:32.766, Speaker B: I think you always want to have these, like, a few alternatives and just to distribute its a distributed set of options. And, like, percentage of ETH staked in lido should never be above, I don't know, 40, 50%.
00:51:32.870 - 00:51:33.558, Speaker C: Definitely not 50.
00:51:33.606 - 00:51:36.062, Speaker B: But like, and so I think there.
00:51:36.078 - 00:51:39.246, Speaker C: Could be a smart contract bug in Lido. There could be a smart contract bag in rocket pool.
00:51:39.270 - 00:51:42.244, Speaker B: And so I think for that reason, you never want to have too much.
00:51:43.024 - 00:51:46.244, Speaker C: A single player capture a disproportionate share of the market.
00:51:46.704 - 00:51:47.784, Speaker B: Like, it's different.
00:51:47.824 - 00:51:49.968, Speaker C: Like, if it's like, Uniswap commands market.
00:51:50.016 - 00:51:51.472, Speaker B: Share, a lot of market share, it's.
00:51:51.488 - 00:51:52.800, Speaker C: Probably the protocol that has the most.
00:51:52.832 - 00:51:55.832, Speaker B: Amount of market share across any category.
00:51:55.888 - 00:51:57.872, Speaker C: Like, number of swaps that Uniswap is.
00:51:57.888 - 00:52:00.488, Speaker B: Capturing is just continue to dominate.
00:52:00.536 - 00:52:02.360, Speaker C: Like, just people trade through Uniswap.
00:52:02.472 - 00:52:03.576, Speaker B: It's the best liquidity.
00:52:03.680 - 00:52:07.388, Speaker C: If Uniswap goes down, you can find alternate places.
00:52:07.436 - 00:52:09.876, Speaker B: Right? Like, of course, like if there's like.
00:52:09.900 - 00:52:18.228, Speaker C: A bug and some of these liquidity pools get drained, it would be devastating, but not nearly enough. As if there's a smart contract that, for whatever reason, truly locks up a.
00:52:18.236 - 00:52:20.220, Speaker B: Lot of that stake and some of.
00:52:20.252 - 00:52:22.932, Speaker C: All the validators get compromised, whatever that is.
00:52:22.988 - 00:52:27.860, Speaker B: But like, the, like, when you think.
00:52:27.892 - 00:52:39.594, Speaker C: About the relative, like, risk of some of these liquid staking providers going down versus another protocol in the whole entire crypto ecosystem, this is, these are one perhaps the most important pieces.
00:52:41.494 - 00:52:45.354, Speaker B: That you, you want to really monitor. Yeah.
00:52:48.094 - 00:52:49.102, Speaker A: Let'S get into more news.
00:52:49.158 - 00:52:52.494, Speaker C: But that being said. Yeah, that being said, it's a very valuable service.
00:52:52.614 - 00:53:02.142, Speaker A: Yeah, avalanche. We. So we have an avalanche podcast dropping Monday, maybe. I think it. I think. I think it drops Monday. We'll see either Monday or Friday.
00:53:02.142 - 00:53:22.314, Speaker A: But we have an avalanche episode. We did it with the two, the founder, Emin Gungan, and then also John Wu, who's the president of Avilabs. Pretty interesting episode. So that drops on Monday. They just had a big announcement, which actually they did. They announced it right after we stopped recording, so. Oh, well, so we can talk about it with them.
00:53:22.314 - 00:54:00.086, Speaker A: But they announced on Wednesday that they partnered with AWS to accelerate enterprise, institutional and government adoption of blockchain. AWS supports Avalanche's infrastructure and DAP ecosystem, including one click node deployment. It's pretty interesting. Through the AWS marketplace, AWACS popped 20% on the news of a partnership with AWS for deploying subnets. Super interesting to see this because people still underestimate the power of BD in crypto. And I think we've all been kind of surprised by Polygon success in 2022. And what Polygon did is they said, we're going to own a niche.
00:54:00.086 - 00:54:49.254, Speaker A: And the niche that they chose was big brands getting into crypto and the big brands that they wanted to capture were like, I don't know how to describe this, but the cool, the web, two brands like the Disneys and Facebooks and things like that of the world, I think avalanche is starting to carve out their own niche, which is like the large corporates who are maybe less sexy. So the way that they're doing this is, by the, these way, partnerships with the, with AWS. They also have a huge partnership with Deloitte actually, and I think you could see Avalanche in this bear market try to win the, oh, also KKR, like, they could try to win this, like the big corporates playing in crypto game, which I don't even know what big corporates would do in crypto, but like that, I think it's interesting to see them try to carve out this niche.
00:54:49.734 - 00:54:58.622, Speaker C: Tokenized funds, if you're Apollo. I think it's interesting because Amir comes from an economic background.
00:54:58.758 - 00:55:05.918, Speaker B: He was a Cornell for a long time, and, and then John, I think.
00:55:05.966 - 00:55:12.078, Speaker C: I always see him on Bloomberg. Like, he's like a frequent host that gets invited there to talk about crypto and what they're doing.
00:55:12.126 - 00:55:13.830, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's interesting.
00:55:13.902 - 00:55:25.952, Speaker C: They're carving out much more of that, like where the people should listen to the podcast. But a lot of things we talked about there is how their subnets, and it gives like a flexible kind of architecture for some of these players to.
00:55:25.968 - 00:55:28.456, Speaker B: Like, grow into and have like a.
00:55:28.480 - 00:55:37.600, Speaker C: Sandbox environment, baby steps to get into this wild world of crypto. And so from that, they kept emphasizing over and over in the podcast, like, we're a lot.
00:55:37.632 - 00:55:39.872, Speaker B: This, this is very good from a.
00:55:39.888 - 00:55:44.230, Speaker C: Regulatory perspective and regulatory compliance. A lot of these folks are really focused on that.
00:55:44.272 - 00:55:46.250, Speaker B: And so, you know, whether you believe.
00:55:46.282 - 00:55:48.258, Speaker C: That to be true or not, you know, go listen to the podcast and.
00:55:48.266 - 00:55:49.090, Speaker B: Let us know what you think.
00:55:49.202 - 00:56:04.450, Speaker A: Yeah. So, um. Yeah, it's interesting. Cause cosmos, right? We had Zack and Jack on, and they take a totally different approach. They're like no single entity to generate the deals, no BD. I think that's philosophically good, but tactically bad. Like, we had a.
00:56:04.450 - 00:56:21.236, Speaker A: There's a company I invested in and they're like, I was like, something just happened in the news. That means that it's a huge opportunity for them. I was like, guys, like, turn on the fire. Time to go. They're like, we don't really have a BD. I was like, let me help you set up your, like, get the sales team going. Like, I'll.
00:56:21.236 - 00:56:39.136, Speaker A: I can help you guys out. Um, and they're like, we don't really have a sales team. Like, we do things more grassroots. And I was like, all right, let me just line in the sand. Like, that is an old school strategy in crypto. I'm sorry, but get a CRM, salesforce, or HubSpot. Get a marketing team if you're there.
00:56:39.136 - 00:56:59.976, Speaker A: B, two. B. Like, they're not really a consumer company. I'd like get a CRM, HubSpot, or salesforce. Get a marketer, drive the leads to your sales team. Go hire a BDR SDR to go outbound, set up leads for your account executives. If the lead is good, you flip it from a marketing qualified lead into a sales qualified lead.
00:56:59.976 - 00:57:07.094, Speaker A: You push it down the pipeline, you close it. Once the deal is closed, you've got an account manager. I was like, come on, folks. Like, it's a tried and true model.
00:57:07.474 - 00:57:10.410, Speaker C: This is an enterprise software playbook here.
00:57:10.482 - 00:57:11.258, Speaker A: Tried and true model.
00:57:11.306 - 00:57:13.330, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's.
00:57:13.362 - 00:57:19.954, Speaker C: It's difficult, right. Because it depends, right. It'd be bd and crypto historically, like, okay, theorem. Like, what's the BD of theorem? It was like icos, I think, just.
00:57:19.994 - 00:57:20.858, Speaker B: Made people a lot of money, and.
00:57:20.866 - 00:57:27.454, Speaker C: Then everyone became really vested in Ethereum. But I think that, as you're rightly point out, it's different if you're a competing l one.
00:57:27.794 - 00:57:28.770, Speaker B: It's an uphill battle.
00:57:28.802 - 00:57:32.986, Speaker C: And so you need to have a lot of resources. That's why a lot of these funds, a lot of these layer ones, raise.
00:57:33.010 - 00:57:35.188, Speaker B: A bunch of capital to hire a.
00:57:35.196 - 00:57:50.540, Speaker C: BD team, to have incentives to attract developers to come over and build. But, yeah, it's also tricky, right? Because you, if you're a front facing crypto protocol, if you like, you can't really advertise.
00:57:50.612 - 00:57:53.260, Speaker B: I mean, it's quite difficult to advertise.
00:57:53.292 - 00:57:56.100, Speaker C: In Google and some of these other platforms. Like, they make it.
00:57:56.252 - 00:58:25.044, Speaker A: You can, you can advertise your crypto price. So, like, Avalanche took over ads on the New York subway, but it was like, come build on avalanche. And my theory would be that they didn't actually use those to drive leads. It's that they then use those to then put that in a deck that they're pitching to Deloitte and Aws, seeing being like, look how real we are. We advertise on the New York subway. It's a psychology thing. So I just, I think I remember.
00:58:25.164 - 00:58:29.004, Speaker C: Watching Gemini buses around New York.
00:58:29.704 - 00:58:48.284, Speaker A: Exactly. Anyways, I think that's something that changes this market is like, you have a product, you have a b, two b product. Go build that. There's a tried and true model here, folks. Salesforce created it and thousands of other companies have implemented it. Go run the playbook.
00:58:48.744 - 00:59:06.614, Speaker C: Let me ask you a question. Have you ever thought about building a CRM? You have all the. A lot of information from subscribers, people that are interested in crypto. You put on a conference, you have a research portal, like, what's to stop you from adding and plugging in another service? It says hey, let me connect leads here.
00:59:08.314 - 00:59:38.876, Speaker A: So we. I mean, we use a CRM internally for, like, our sales. We have. There are two different CRM type things. At blockworks, there's the sales CRM. So, like, our sales team reaches out to Coinbase or trying to sell them a sponsorship or something at a conference, and that, like, that's all tracked in a CRM. And then there's the CRM for, like, content, basically, which we don't have, but we're talking about building, which is, you know, Garrett, on the podcast side, might reach out to Constantine, you said, from Lido to get him on the show.
00:59:38.876 - 00:59:57.004, Speaker A: Well, he has no way of seeing that someone else on the editorial team has just invited him or had just did a story on Lido and has a relationship, and that someone on the events team has already reached out to him two days ago to invite him to speak at permissionless. So that's the CRM. But it sounds like maybe you're talking about something different.
00:59:58.464 - 01:00:07.568, Speaker C: We're more offering like this. You have, like, the guide points of the world and some of these, like, research allowing people to connect with experts.
01:00:07.656 - 01:00:17.912, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I don't know. Was this thought. Maybe it's a dumb idea, but yeah, I guess you're at the hub of, like, reporting but also research.
01:00:18.008 - 01:00:56.536, Speaker A: And then they're like, first party data and information on your subscribers and audiences is a huge trend in the media world, is what everyone talks about. And it's funny. We've been hiring a vp of sales, and there are two types of vp of sales we've been talking to. They're like crypto people who are maybe a vp of sales at another crypto company. They'd come over, but they don't know media. Or there's media people who maybe they're the head of sales that, like Arstool or Axios or Huffington Post or something, and they, like, really get media, but they don't know crypto. And the media people are like, here's how you say scale block works.
01:00:56.536 - 01:01:03.392, Speaker A: You sell into the agencies, you get, like, first party data. It's like, it's very different world of media. It's funny. Yeah.
01:01:03.488 - 01:01:04.096, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:04.240 - 01:01:17.384, Speaker A: So, anywho, talk about l one s and the strategies. I was talking to someone in who's pretty deep in the Japan japanese crypto world. You ever heard of something called Aster? A s t a r?
01:01:18.444 - 01:01:19.184, Speaker B: No.
01:01:19.644 - 01:01:51.548, Speaker A: So I go, what do people build on in Japan? Like, what's, what's hot? Like, are people building on ETH? Are they building on Polygon? Solana he goes, oh. He goes, oh, everyone builds on Aster. I was like, come again? Like, did I hear you correctly? He's like, yeah, everyone built on asteroid, the l one, Aster. I was like, sorry, what? And he's like, yeah, everyone built on Aster. He goes, avalanche and Polygon are the two, like, second best and third best. Like they're, they're fighting for that second spot right now. But he goes, Aster, super popular.
01:01:51.548 - 01:02:02.224, Speaker A: I was like, all right. So I go, it's aster.net. Work. The website. The future of smart contracts for the multi chain world. Aster is a scalable, decentralized blockchain for the next big web. Three innovations.
01:02:02.224 - 01:02:34.252, Speaker A: We provide infrastructure for building dapps with EVM and WASM smart contracts offering developers true interoperability with cross consensus messaging and across virtual machine. I was like, so I pull up their twitter, like, half a million followers, 50 dapps are already built on it. Talking about multi chain world. They do they have staking. I was like, man, that is nuts. Listen to the backers. Polychain, Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi, Hashkey, Huobi Ventures, DFG, GSR, Crypto.com
01:02:34.252 - 01:02:40.784, Speaker A: Capital. It's the big names in Asia. Yeah, I just found it very interesting.
01:02:41.204 - 01:02:42.652, Speaker C: Well, whoever's listening out there from the.
01:02:42.668 - 01:02:44.732, Speaker B: Astro team, if you are, will have.
01:02:44.748 - 01:02:45.772, Speaker C: To have you on the show.
01:02:45.868 - 01:02:46.704, Speaker A: Fascinating.
01:02:47.164 - 01:02:53.716, Speaker C: Japan's a very, like, insular market. Like they, you know, it's, it's pretty interesting.
01:02:53.860 - 01:03:07.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, here. So we have a research analyst who just joined the team. His name is rental and we're talking about it in slack. And he goes, my japanese friend says it's by far the biggest blockchain in Japan. Huge government support. And another person goes, Aster, question mark.
01:03:07.810 - 01:03:23.980, Speaker A: And Ren goes, yeah, Aster founders, japanese. They're pretty big in the crypto community in Japan. So it's interesting seeing, like, where the founders are from. Like Avalanche, actually. Their biggest area of retail. The biggest retail area for avalanche is in Turkey.
01:03:24.122 - 01:03:24.544, Speaker B: Why?
01:03:24.624 - 01:03:33.284, Speaker A: Because Emin is from. I still can't pronounce his name. But anyways, there's your alpha about Aster.
01:03:34.024 - 01:03:37.688, Speaker B: Wow. We'll have to go check that out. All right.
01:03:37.696 - 01:04:07.044, Speaker A: We got some layoffs from the exchange space. Tuesday morning, Brian Armstrong announced a 20% layoff. It's about 1000 employees as part of a restructuring effort. Payroll, biggest cost to any company. Coinbase noted that this would cut operating expenses by 25%. This comes eight months after Coinbase's first round of layoffs, which was about 18% of the staff which back at the time is like 1100 or 1200 employees. What did Coinbases stock? I think Coinbase's stock went up on the news.
01:04:07.044 - 01:04:33.954, Speaker A: Let's see. Yeah, Coinbases stock went up like twelve to 15% on the news, which just goes to show that investors do not want growth at all costs right now. They want companies to tighten the belts and that profitability, tightening the belt will sacrifice growth. As long as you are working towards profitability is what investors are starting to value. We also saw Blockchain.com dot, I dont know if youve caught this news yet. Happened on Thursday.
01:04:33.954 - 01:04:55.278, Speaker A: Blockchain.com just laid off 28%. No surprise they had a huge lending business. Actually, at one point they were one of the three largest institutional lenders in crypto. It was them, blockfi and Genesis. They owned the kind of lend to block to bitcoin miner. They like crushed that vertical.
01:04:55.278 - 01:05:26.098, Speaker A: And so obviously they've gotten hammered. Yeah, yeah. What else happened? I think this is the last bit of news and then we can wrap it up. Is Ondo finance. I don't know if this was a pivot or a new thing, but I remember them doing something different before this. But anyways, Ondo Finance announced the other day that they're providing us treasuries and institutional grade bonds on chain as security tokens. Only KYC parties can purchase them and they carry 100k minimum and a 15 basis point fee.
01:05:26.098 - 01:05:34.506, Speaker A: The team claims the product is going to be used to serve Daos. Interesting to even see about like maker, right? Yeah, exactly.
01:05:34.570 - 01:05:36.298, Speaker C: Like Maker would have probably used condo.
01:05:36.426 - 01:05:36.714, Speaker B: Make.
01:05:36.754 - 01:05:48.254, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, make. Yes, exactly, exactly. Mako, there's your collaboration. Yeah, it was just funny to see them use the word security tokens. I was like, man, that feels like a 2017 term.
01:05:49.194 - 01:05:51.450, Speaker B: Sto, baby. Sto's. Yeah.
01:05:51.602 - 01:05:54.602, Speaker C: Interesting. This was the first I ended up looking at this because I said, how.
01:05:54.618 - 01:05:55.626, Speaker B: Did I miss this?
01:05:55.770 - 01:05:56.922, Speaker C: Because I didn't look at the round.
01:05:57.018 - 01:05:59.774, Speaker B: And it was led by Pantera and.
01:06:01.114 - 01:06:05.214, Speaker C: It was the first public, at least investment that Peter Thiel's funded.
01:06:06.054 - 01:06:06.794, Speaker A: Really?
01:06:07.574 - 01:06:08.446, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:06:08.510 - 01:06:11.070, Speaker C: At least a token project or a.
01:06:11.142 - 01:06:13.594, Speaker B: Project that signaled that they were going to have a token.
01:06:13.934 - 01:06:23.582, Speaker C: And so, and then they did like a public sale, they raised like another 10 million or so. I think they raised like a 23. Oh, you know what, series b. And they did a public sale of 10 million.
01:06:23.718 - 01:06:48.624, Speaker A: I just searched for Ondo in my email and I have a message from Paul Vera. I forget how you pronounce his last name, but Paul at Pantera from August of 2021. About Ondo, he's like, yeah, it's a new fixed income protocol that enables users to enter into both fixed yield and variable yield positions. So I think this was a bit of a pivot, but, yeah, good for them.
01:06:50.364 - 01:06:58.248, Speaker C: Yeah, I've heard and seen Dex, similar approach that people want to, like, tokenize treasuries and have that give people access to that.
01:06:58.376 - 01:07:02.072, Speaker B: So, yeah, pretty interesting use case, especially.
01:07:02.128 - 01:07:04.524, Speaker C: Now where markets are and rates are.
01:07:05.944 - 01:07:17.604, Speaker A: Pantera led a $4 million round for Ondo. We had participation from Genesis, DCG, which is Barry and Barry, CMS and coin fund. Interesting.
01:07:18.264 - 01:07:19.112, Speaker C: That was the first.
01:07:19.208 - 01:07:20.432, Speaker B: And then they did another one, I.
01:07:20.448 - 01:07:22.484, Speaker C: Think, where Peter Thiel participated.
01:07:22.624 - 01:07:30.584, Speaker A: Yeah, oka doke. That's that. That's all you got for me this week? I don't know if you. If there's anything else on your mind.
01:07:31.524 - 01:07:34.724, Speaker B: No, no. Fairly interesting.
01:07:34.764 - 01:07:35.944, Speaker C: Good start of the year.
01:07:36.564 - 01:07:37.172, Speaker B: That's really it.
01:07:37.188 - 01:07:39.104, Speaker C: I did read a really interesting book.
01:07:39.924 - 01:07:42.620, Speaker B: Now that, you know, rates and or.
01:07:42.652 - 01:07:44.624, Speaker C: All the rage and all the talk.
01:07:44.924 - 01:07:48.882, Speaker B: I read a couple of good books. The first one that I.
01:07:49.068 - 01:07:50.614, Speaker C: That I read was the price of.
01:07:50.654 - 01:08:00.590, Speaker B: Time, the real story of interest by Edward Chancel Chancellor. Chancellor. Edward Chancellor. Pretty good, actually.
01:08:00.662 - 01:08:09.830, Speaker C: Like, I love reading. Like you said something interesting earlier on, like, historic, like just historical accounts of big movements like the oil industry now that developed.
01:08:09.862 - 01:08:11.966, Speaker B: And, like, you know, and so this.
01:08:11.990 - 01:08:13.854, Speaker C: One was just a history of rates.
01:08:13.894 - 01:08:15.950, Speaker B: And, you know, of course, at one.
01:08:15.982 - 01:08:19.414, Speaker C: Point, like, it was like, dean. Like, I mean, Sharia law, for instance.
01:08:19.454 - 01:08:22.554, Speaker B: Doesn'T allow you to have, like, interests.
01:08:22.854 - 01:08:40.034, Speaker C: And historically, interest has been a pretty contentious thing. So I found that book to be pretty refreshing. It does also talk about this, like, obsession with targeting inflation of this 2% and how all, like, just giving you background on how all of that is coming of formation. And.
01:08:41.653 - 01:08:48.917, Speaker B: And of course, it claims that it's probably going to be one of the more destructive policies adopted by central bank's.
01:08:48.965 - 01:08:51.181, Speaker C: Obsession with, like, a 2% inflation number.
01:08:51.237 - 01:08:54.949, Speaker B: Which I tend to agree with. But, yeah, it was a good book.
01:08:54.981 - 01:08:57.713, Speaker C: That I read recently. So highly recommend, folks.
01:08:58.693 - 01:08:59.405, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:59.549 - 01:09:06.953, Speaker A: Any good series of books talking about Sharia law? I was on a. Did you ever use the platform Refinitiv when you worked in banking?
01:09:07.684 - 01:09:08.580, Speaker B: No. No.
01:09:08.732 - 01:09:15.292, Speaker A: All right, so there are some big platforms that are like, everyone uses Bloomberg terminal, obviously, but there's also, like, factset and Cap IQ.
01:09:15.388 - 01:09:16.956, Speaker B: Yeah, factset and cap IQ.
01:09:17.020 - 01:09:35.213, Speaker A: Yeah. So factset, cap IQ, refinitiv is another big one. They sold for 27 billion. They have. I'm doing research into just different data and research businesses, because we have our research platform now. And I was on their product set and let me read you these products. It was.
01:09:35.213 - 01:09:39.129, Speaker A: What is that?
01:09:39.321 - 01:09:43.705, Speaker C: Sukuks, which is like these, like Islamic Korea law compliant.
01:09:43.729 - 01:09:58.249, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, exactly. So look at that. So I'm on the psychic agreement and I was like, oh, this is cool. They have their target profile. It's like really baked out. So listen, listen to the sectors. Asset management, central banks, corporate treasury, investment banking, market data risk compliance.
01:09:58.249 - 01:10:16.414, Speaker A: Right. No surprise so far. Technology trading, wealth management and islamic finance. I was like, oh, there we go. So interesting. So then I click it and it's like, yeah. Discover our islamic finance services and solutions, islamic market data research and intelligence sharia compliant trading, islamic content events.
01:10:16.414 - 01:10:19.154, Speaker A: Get data on sukuk. I don't know.
01:10:21.214 - 01:10:27.594, Speaker C: These, like, weird, like, work. It's basically sharia compliant bombs.
01:10:29.084 - 01:10:31.144, Speaker A: Super interesting. So I never knew.
01:10:33.564 - 01:10:48.524, Speaker C: I took a class in Uni and I have actually a paper where I studied, like, islamic finance and sukuks and like, yeah, probably more. More stuff that I, you know, doesn't serve me much, but it was interesting to learn about it nonetheless.
01:10:48.644 - 01:10:49.636, Speaker A: I am reading it.
01:10:49.740 - 01:10:54.642, Speaker C: Everyone wants a paper on sukuks. I can send you 28, 28 page paper on Sukook.
01:10:54.748 - 01:11:14.542, Speaker A: I just started a new book which is like a fun read. It's pretty short. It's like 250 pages. It's called. What is it called? It's called drugs in the Third Reich. I don't know if you've heard of it, but basically the thesis is that the Third Reich, like Hitler and the Nazis, was basically an altered. They were all yipped up on methamphetamines.
01:11:14.542 - 01:11:46.684, Speaker A: Yeah, methamphetamines, yeah, exactly. And I just started it. But basically, I think the thesis is that, like, there's this drug called pervitin where. Which was like a low dose methamphetamine, which is like very similar to today's crystal meth. And they, in the book they're talking about, like, Hitler would take this thing called pervitin and supplement it with barbiturates, coke, even like, steroids, sex hormones. And they also had an early form of oxycontin. So, man, that is nuts.
01:11:47.224 - 01:11:47.840, Speaker B: In the.
01:11:47.912 - 01:12:18.288, Speaker C: Well, you know what they attribute. There's a great. If people don't want to read the book, there's a history channel, I think, episode on this and it talks about, like, in the kit that they gave soldiers of the Third Reich, they had a methamphetamine. And when you compare accounts of, like, western soldiers saying these guys like, blitzkrieg. Like, this idea that, like, the Germans would just bulldoze through, like, battlefields and were more efficient. Yeah, guys, they were on meth. So why'd you win the, why did they do such a big advancement?
01:12:18.376 - 01:12:21.056, Speaker B: Like, well, because they were on meth.
01:12:21.080 - 01:12:32.424, Speaker C: And, like, why did the west won the war? Well, because, like, they ran out of meth. No, I'm kidding. Like, why did we get into a crisis? Well, there was an Adderall shortage in the Bahamas, and so that's why FDX went down.
01:12:32.464 - 01:12:32.904, Speaker B: Right?
01:12:33.024 - 01:12:34.720, Speaker C: That's like the plausible theory, right?
01:12:34.752 - 01:12:34.920, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:34.952 - 01:12:46.500, Speaker A: 90 years later, no difference. So, yeah, it's crazy. They said millions of this drug pervitin pills were shipped every week overseas. That is wild. That's crazy. So, yeah. Anyways, that's what I'm reading.
01:12:46.500 - 01:12:47.092, Speaker A: Not really.
01:12:47.148 - 01:12:58.064, Speaker C: Don't do, this is, this is advised. Please, folks, don't do methamphetamines. This is not an endorsement to go into methamphetamines or Adderall or any substance, mind altering substance, for that matter.
01:12:58.364 - 01:13:12.724, Speaker A: Thank you. Disclaimer. Yeah, that's as good of a place as we're going to wrap it as we'll, as we'll ever find. Guys, thanks for, thanks for listening. Fun app Santi per use. Thanks for joining and see you guys next week for the Avalanche episode.
