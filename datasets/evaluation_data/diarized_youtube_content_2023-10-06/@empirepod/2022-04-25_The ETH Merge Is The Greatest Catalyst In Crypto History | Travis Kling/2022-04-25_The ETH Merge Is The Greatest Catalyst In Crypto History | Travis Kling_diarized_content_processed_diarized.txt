00:00:00.360 - 00:00:07.990, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various Dexs. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:08.142 - 00:00:36.004, Speaker B: ETH as an asset is going to go deflationary, it's going to go yield generating, and it's going to go ESG friendly, and all of that's going to happen in one fall swoop. So I think that's what I mean by the digestibility of the narrative. Those three things together, deflationary, yield generating, and ESG friendly, that is an incredibly potent combination for large pools of capital and, you know, institutional type of capital.
00:00:43.464 - 00:00:53.056, Speaker C: All right, everyone got the black t shirt gang here we got Mister Travis Kling of Ikigai capital, one of my favorite people in the entire industry, Trav. Welcome to Empire.
00:00:53.120 - 00:00:56.124, Speaker B: When are we going to get some kind of black t shirt sponsorship going on here?
00:00:56.224 - 00:01:22.984, Speaker C: Yeah, we got it. It feels like the sentiment is starting to be pretty bearish around, like, just Nasdaq S and P and the markets in general. Does this mean, like, if you're bearish and, like, you think the rest of the year is not going to look great for things like the Nasdaq, the S and P? If bitcoin's moved in lockstep, in lockstep with the Nasdaq, does that translate to a bearish outlook for bitcoin for the rest of the year?
00:01:24.034 - 00:02:34.804, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. So definitely pay a lot of attention to that correlation. Bitcoin's correlation to macro assets has ebbed and flowed over the years. There's been periods of time where it's traded with stocks with gold, inverse VIX, the renminbi, the two's tension, various different more specific indexes within stocks, like maybe the S and P or qs, or the momentum factor, for example, which is kind of like qs but a little different right now. The way, and you can measure a correlation a bunch of different ways. Like, you pick a look back in a timeframe, the way I measure correlation, bitcoins, correlation to Nasdaq is at 0.95 right now, which is to say, you know, you know, essentially statistically, the same instrument almost entirely, which is what you, what you just showed on that chart that, you know, in some ways that's an expression of it's all one trade.
00:02:34.804 - 00:03:22.034, Speaker B: In some ways that's an expression of, which is a term I've been using for how long? I've been saying that now, 18 months, probably. I've been saying it's all one trade. I don't know, if I invented it, maybe I did. But, yeah, it's all one trade. In the sense that central bank monetary and fiscal policy actions have such a. Their importance to asset price movements dwarf that dwarfs everything else, to the point that it's like those shirts from the nineties where it's like, baseball is life, the rest is just details, right? It's like fed policy is life, the rest is just details. And, you know, people can hate that or they can love that, but that is just the sort of state of things right now.
00:03:22.034 - 00:03:26.734, Speaker B: So in some ways, this correlation is like this expression of it's all. It's all one trade.
00:03:27.954 - 00:04:12.204, Speaker D: Is it, though? Like, I guess, like when, when we talk about, like, is it just one trade? Like, in the near term, it may be just one trade. Like, everything's so correlated. There's these shocks where the market kind of, like in October, I think we all were coming in towards the end of the year saying, okay, there's going to be inflation. We've kind of known it. But then once it's real, it's like, okay, people adjust, and it's a temporary shock, whether that's six months to a year. But I want to go to something which is like, is this a secular trade? And is it a secular trade over, like a two 3510 year continuum, which is most kind of big allocators of capital? I think, in crypto now, the composition is people that are more long term driven. These are like ten year horizon funds, like venture funds that are deploying billions of dollars.
00:04:12.204 - 00:04:40.360, Speaker D: Do you think it's just one trade? Or you look at something like the merge and you say, holy shit, this is the next arc of the Internet. How could you not deploy and take advantage of this volatility and uncertainty? I'm curious how you positioned your portfolio, because timing, I don't think anyone really, truly understands macro. It's really funky. But if you try to time these markets, it can become quite difficult. I don't know. How do you kind of think about that?
00:04:40.512 - 00:05:42.984, Speaker B: I would say crypto people definitely don't understand macro. There's obviously a whole class, so obviously a whole class of investors that at least try as hard as crypto people to understand crypto macro investors try that hard to understand macro. And some of them are better at it than others, like crypto investors. I completely agree with you that the, the medium long term investment thesis for this technology in this asset class has never been brighter, and there's never been more institutional capital that is committed to it, that is watching it. There's never been more eyeballs on this technology in this asset class. There's never been more dollars that are earmarked. There's never been more dollars that are a term that a friend of mine likes to use, mentally committed, but not physically deployed.
00:05:42.984 - 00:06:22.918, Speaker B: And all of that bodes incredibly well. So I think the question was, why is bitcoin ticking with Q's? That was the question. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's. I think it's this combination of sort of partially an expression of all one trade and partially this institutionalization of crypto trading where, you know, it's. I don't really know exactly how renaissance runs their business, but I have no doubt that renaissance looks at bitcoin and its relationship to queues in some incredibly sophisticated ways and.
00:06:22.918 - 00:07:17.002, Speaker B: And expresses that, as do a lot of different traditional quant focused hedge funds. And you can start to feel that pressure, especially with a lack of kind of clear retail demand. And I think it's pretty apparent that retail fervor has cooled off a lot over the last few weeks in or last few months in crypto. And so I think that allows some of this more quantity, stat, ar, relative value, you know, type of correlation money to come in and look, it's going to hold until it doesn't. All of these things sort of hold for some period of time, and then they decouple. And sometimes they can decouple in either direction, but in a really violent way. Like, I remember in October, I think October of 2020, the VIX was up 40%, and bitcoin was up, like, I don't know, like a lot, like 30% or something like that.
00:07:17.002 - 00:08:19.410, Speaker B: And at the beginning of the month, if somebody told you the VIX is going to be up 40% this month, what's bitcoin going to do? And you'd be like, oh, it's definitely going to be down if the VIX is up 40%. Right. And you would have gotten super run over on that. So I think it's like these things sort of hold until they don't. I agree with you, Santiago, that like, ETH, specifically, this merge setup, you know, this is going to sound like hyperbole. This ETH merge setup, I think, is the single largest, the single most significant, most telegraphed, event driven catalyst in crypto history, in the history of this asset class, in this technology. And that, that sounds like a crazy thing to say, but if it's not going to be, it either has to be something that happened in ETH or it happened in bitcoin, because it's impossible for any other catalyst in any other name to have been as significant as those two names.
00:08:19.410 - 00:09:04.594, Speaker B: And then you think about the history of bitcoin and there's nothing that has been this significant that was this telegraphed where it's this much of a step change and in terms of what the merge represents. And then you couple that with the willingness and the ability for very large pools of capital to buy a lot of ETH for this into this setup. And the digestibility of the narrative and the ETH BTC outperformance trademark is so clean that it scares me.
00:09:05.054 - 00:09:33.644, Speaker D: So. Well, there's a lot to unpack there. One, I just want to give a high level understanding of what the merge is. But before we get there, you talk about this idea of what is priced in. How much of the merge do you think is priced in historically? Everyone knows these things happen. Okay, it's been delayed a little bit, but even bitcoin happenings which are programmed, you know exactly which block it's going to happen. Then of course, bitcoin outperforms after every kind of like, happening.
00:09:33.644 - 00:09:44.124, Speaker D: How much of the merge is do you think is one properly understood to priced into the market? And then maybe if you would just want to address like what the merge, why is it so, like meaningful?
00:09:44.704 - 00:10:44.370, Speaker B: Yeah, so let's see here. So it's just a shift from proof of work to proof of stake. ETH as an asset is going to go deflationary, it's going to go yield generating, and it's going to go ESG friendly, and all of that's going to happen in one false swoop. So I think that's what I mean by the digestibility of the narrative. And then I think like those three things together, deflationary, yield generating and ESG friendly, that is an incredibly potent combination for large pools of capital and institutional type of capital. And then another thing, I've been writing about this, my monthly update letters for a while now. The market seems to broadly be, the market seems to want to own the innovation that's happening at the layer one smart contract level.
00:10:44.370 - 00:11:57.074, Speaker B: And that seems to, the setup seems to be that the market is thinking that that's more attractive than the money ness of bitcoin, right? This term money, it's like an austrian economics term, right? Like the hardness of the, of the characteristics of bitcoin as a money. And we've seen that setup play out in other asset classes. If you look at big tech, right? If you look at the Nasdaq, if you look at the fervor of the early stage venture capital technology investing landscape, it's very clear that the market really wants to own innovation. And in a world that's increasingly starved for growth, that world is willing to reward growth when it can find it. And growth comes from innovation. And it looks like innovation happens on layer one, smart contract levels. And you get this sort of, like, two for one or three for one type of situation where, like, you can own ETH.
00:11:57.074 - 00:12:51.654, Speaker B: And not only do you get this great deflationary yield generation ESG friendly innovation, but you also, like, you don't just get defi. You also get nfts and you also get gaming, and you also get, like, whatever else comes along that haven't invented yet. And that's kind of like owning Facebook stock and getting Instagram and getting WhatsApp or that's kind of like owning Google and you get search and you get YouTube or whatever, right? And so I think there's a lot of pattern matching that's probably happening there. And the amount. The other thing that I think about a lot of in terms of this is that there's. There's never been so, like, two years ago, you know, we were just coming off the COVID crash. Two years ago, the Fed was, you know, in the middle of doing 3 trillion a QE in six weeks.
00:12:51.654 - 00:12:58.134, Speaker B: And, you know, ETH was trading. Dude, no, 800.
00:13:00.794 - 00:13:07.598, Speaker D: Yeah, it went all the way to 180. That was like the. The March black Thursday or what? What is it? It went, like, all the way to 100 ish.
00:13:07.646 - 00:13:12.874, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Two years ago, ethan's trading $200. That's so good.
00:13:14.614 - 00:13:28.874, Speaker D: Which, by the way. Which, by the way, let's do a print. This is, like, at that time, I don't know if you remember, everyone was, like, freaking out. Like, do you think that, like, the same level of, like, fear is in the market today?
00:13:29.374 - 00:13:57.324, Speaker B: Let's see here. The market cap of ETH two years ago was $17 billion. $17 billion. So two years ago, you know, as the Fed was doing 3 trillion QE in two weeks, and then, you know, a month later, Paul Tudor Jones writes his letter about, bought a bunch of bitcoin. It's the fastest horse, all this kind of stuff. And, you know, everything goes off. Gong show.
00:13:57.324 - 00:14:17.574, Speaker B: $17 billion. Large pools of institutional capital cannot buy a $17 billion market cap. Magic Internet money. They cannot buy that. And so they could watch it. But you had to be some, what I call, like, the fast, smart institutional money. Like, the real.
00:14:17.574 - 00:14:39.982, Speaker B: You're pretty out there if you're buying ETH in the summer of 2020, and you're institutional capital. You're pretty far out there and very, very little capital. That is a completely different setup than the situation that we're going into with this. With ETH 2.0. Okay. ETH is now a $380 billion asset. It's super large.
00:14:39.982 - 00:14:59.590, Speaker B: It's super liquid. These narratives have played out a much greater. Nobody's even talking about the ESG differentiation between bitcoin and Ethan. You know, the innovation. None of that was nearly as well understood. So, like, that's what I mean by, like, the. You cannot.
00:14:59.590 - 00:15:16.014, Speaker B: You cannot overstate the importance of the part of this setup. That is the willingness and the ability for very large pools of capital to buy a lot of ETH. And I think it makes. Yeah. Just. It makes this time. This time different.
00:15:16.014 - 00:15:18.654, Speaker B: So that was. I want. Yeah, I wanted to finish that point.
00:15:19.594 - 00:15:51.830, Speaker A: Empire is brought to you by Paraswap, which just reached a whole new level in the Defi game. Paraswap started as a Dex aggregator, which, for those who don't know, it's like a Google flights or an expedia for swapping crypto, you would obviously never just go directly to an airline's website. Same thing with crypto. You would never go directly to an exchange to trade or to swap. You'd go to Paraswap. Why? Because they aggregate liquidity for more than 60 different sources to get you the best prices and the most efficient gas transactions. Now, periswap, obviously still the best aggregator out there.
00:15:51.830 - 00:16:04.918, Speaker A: But now there's more. They now have staking. They have yield farming. There's this one feature that I love. It shows you exactly how much money paraswap saved you on your last trade. They're now on five different blockchains. They've got Ethereum finance, Polygon.
00:16:04.918 - 00:16:36.734, Speaker A: They recently added avalanche and Phantom. So it's really simple. If you're an empire listener, if you are new to defi or you're a power user of Defi, really, anybody? If you're dabbling in defi markets, you have got to try paraswap. Their new staking and yield farming products are a game changer. They've taken Defi to the next level with, really, one of the first mature defi products that I've ever seen. So head on over to Paraswap IO. That is paraswap IO, and start swapping, trading, staking, and so much more today.
00:16:37.114 - 00:16:58.170, Speaker D: Yeah, it makes it like the. The investability of ETH is. Is higher now. I would agree with that. I started to notice that, like, maybe a year in when EAP 1559 was coming around, a lot of big, big macro funds started reaching out and saying, hey, talk to me about not bitcoin. Actually, bitcoin wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Hour long calls, tigers of the world were like, hey, talk to me about ETH.
00:16:58.170 - 00:17:38.652, Speaker D: And these are guys that are smart in tech, are willing to go out there. You know, Tiger was early investor like in really aggressively moving in places like India to invest behind a lot of startups there, Flipkart and stuff like that. And so they were looking at ETH. But maybe to your point, I guess the question to you is from where, from your vantage point, it has felt that, yeah, sure, a year, a year and a half ago it was 17 billion. It's, you know, after you cross like 2000, it's a much different animal, which you could argue ETH has been investable for over a year now because it crossed sort of this 50 billion milestone. I don't know what your heuristic is around like for these type of funds, but seems to me like around 50 billion. It starts to be pretty investible for.
00:17:38.668 - 00:17:39.212, Speaker A: A lot of folks.
00:17:39.268 - 00:18:17.364, Speaker D: We've been in that setup for, call it 912 months and we've seen ETH kind of go all the way up to 4000. It's now at 3000. And so the question for you is from your conversations with these large pools of capital, how much of that do you think is kind of like sitting idly waiting for this to actually go through and then invest? Like how do they deploy? Like do you deploy now because you have good certainty that it's happening? Sure, delayed, but you make the argument to deploy now or do these guys are like buying into the market slowly and just cost averaging in, or are they going to wait after the merge?
00:18:18.264 - 00:18:43.134, Speaker B: So it's probably a combination of all of those. I mean, it looks to me like ETH is being heavily accumulated right now. It makes it interesting that because of the specifics of this setup, expressing the view through derivatives doesn't get you the same. You know, you can't get a yield on a derivative, basically, which makes that set up in terms of the expression of the trade a little bit, a little bit different.
00:18:43.714 - 00:18:49.482, Speaker D: A derivative in this case being like a, like a perp or grayscale product.
00:18:49.538 - 00:18:51.946, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah.
00:18:52.090 - 00:19:18.442, Speaker D: Because it feels like some, sometimes I feel like the market wants to be bullish. We always, at least crypto people always want to be bullish, always want find reasons to say, no, it's correlated now, but like give it a, give it a second. Like it's going to grow. Like everything that you're saying, like it sort of makes sense. I think. I think this very much appeals to music to my ears and everyone in crypto. But what is the scenario where like we see ETH back at like a thousand post merge? Like is it because like scalability, there's nothing there.
00:19:18.442 - 00:19:36.120, Speaker D: Like is this, you know, because one of the things emerge doesn't solve is high gas that comes through L2s, which you could argue are very much developed, but still could there be a world here where we see ETH back below 1000?
00:19:36.312 - 00:21:20.896, Speaker B: Mike, the way the ETH BTC underperforms in the coming months from here is the Fed goes hard in the paint and the market equities get spooked into bringing the VIX in alignment with the move index would be one way to think about that. Or maybe equity is doing some capitulatory type of move to come more in line with what the Fed funds futures are pricing in. That's not my base case, but that's the possibility. If I'm incorrect in my read on the Fed and they are just going to drive this train straight off a recessionary and asset price crash cliff, it would be my base case that would be bearish ETH BTC and that the strength of this narrative would not be able to overcome that macro dark cloud, so to speak. Again, not my base case, but it could happen. And then if there's something technically that actually goes wrong with the merge, I think there's certainly some amount of capital that's waiting to see how that goes and is willing to buy higher afterwards as that risk is diminished in terms of the technical execution of this. And I guess we all know it's just, it's, it's not, it's not, everybody knows, you know, it's not one, one step and done right, it is a multi step, multi year process.
00:21:20.896 - 00:22:21.660, Speaker B: But this first step is obviously, you know, a very, a very big important step. So I think there's, there, there's, there's a technical sort of, sort of aspect to this as well too. And I think the, the thing that's so captivating to me about this trade is that going back to the first part of this conversation about the macro setup, it looks to me like the merge is probably going to happen right around the time that the fed slows down its tightening and the market starts to come to the realization that there's not going to be nine hikes this year that they don't want to drive the train straight off a recessionary and asset price crash cliff. And that they were actually doing maximum jawboning, trying to spook the market into having inflation rollover. Maybe you take GDP growth, you kind of go and kiss a zero GDP growth line and then curve it back up. That's what they're incentivized to do. That's what they've done before.
00:22:21.660 - 00:22:50.140, Speaker B: That's what worked so well in this. The Fed's constituents. The Fed has become completely politicized, and their constituents are boomers. And think about how good of a period of time 2009 to 2020 was for boomers. This is a tremendous time to be an asset owner, to be a boomer. And it's like you own anything. It was an outstanding time, and it was the slowest pace of economic growth in us history.
00:22:50.140 - 00:23:14.994, Speaker B: Slowest us expansion, GDP expansion in US history. It was just that slow and steady. Why would they not want to recreate that? And I think that's probably what they're gonna do. And when the market comes to that realization, there's nothing on planet Earth you want to own more than crypto. There's, like, there's nothing on planet Earth that you want to own. And you're some traditional guy, and you've had a shit year in traditional. 60 40 has gotten smoked.
00:23:14.994 - 00:23:30.654, Speaker B: Equity's gotten smoked, and you're sitting there and you're trying to make up your whole year in the back four months of the calendar year. The fed just went on pause. What do you want to own more than ETH into this merge? Like, are you. Are you serious?
00:23:31.194 - 00:23:53.302, Speaker D: You're singing to the choir, right? I mean, like. But I will say this. Okay, so, like, you saw, as a tangent, take, like, pershing square. Like, Ackman went, you know, balls deep buying NAsdaq, not, sorry, Netflix, and then quickly chopped it because for the first time ever, they've seen subscriber numbers go down. And the market was, like, freaking out about that, realizing that, you know, content is hard to create.
00:23:53.358 - 00:23:53.526, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:53.550 - 00:24:14.606, Speaker D: You need hits. Like, I don't disagree with you. I want to believe that. But there is a thinking. Probabilistically, there is one version where, and the question goes back to these allocators of capital. So, okay, they're buying all this eat. If they're feeling pain in other parts of their portfolio, and this correlation holds true, well, they're sure as hell gonna chop crypto as well.
00:24:14.606 - 00:24:46.668, Speaker D: Like, I even the setup of the, like, all these things, I just tell me if you disagree here, but, like, and by the way, like pershing square, like chopped their Netflix position very quickly. I mean, they sort of exited the trade. It could be a good trade maybe in two years time. But right now, like, they're feeling pain, they're going to chop. If, if crypto is not a meaning meaningful part of their portfolio, I would think that it's no more than 5% of their book. Don't you think that they're going to chop that as opposed to trying to double down and like try to make up the year? They're like, nah, hell no. The correlation's holding.
00:24:46.668 - 00:24:51.712, Speaker D: I'm out. Because the beta on this thing, this puppy is going to be two x Nasdaq. Adios.
00:24:51.888 - 00:24:53.888, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. Potentially.
00:24:54.056 - 00:25:04.720, Speaker D: Maybe the only thing that saves you as a, and I'll stop talking is like these, these more traditional venture funds that have a ten year horizon and are not marking to market and don't have redemptions and all this stuff.
00:25:04.792 - 00:26:02.046, Speaker B: So I think the setup is, the cautiousness is, in the coming months, the caught, the cautiousness, the potential downside risk is like May, June, July. There's like a, I think there's real sell in may go away type of risk in traditional and in turn in crypto. And then I would say then the setup after that then becomes our inflation indicators not rolling over so that the fed has to keep going. You know, they're going to go, they're highly likely to go 50 bps in maybe. Now, I think there's a decent chance you're gonna go 50 bps, you know, in June. That's, that's much less priced in, but there's a decent chance. But like, if these numbers just start staying really hot, you know, do they just keep the foot on the accelerator, you know, crank up the balance sheet, roll off, get up to 95 billion a month is, you know, sooner rather than later.
00:26:02.046 - 00:26:53.046, Speaker B: And the, the jawboning is just remains very hawkishness. And so that's what I mean by the markets can be laser focused on leading inflation and growth indicators because the market needs to see those rolling over so that they can start to expect the Fed to start to take their foot off the accelerator a little bit because the Fed is saying they're going to be data dependent. You need those steps to fall in that place. And if they don't, then the market's going to say, well, then it looks like they're going to keep hammering this thing and it's going to be a sort of like rough landing sort of deal. And you know, look, if you, if the Fed's really going to hike nine times in 2022. You don't want to own any of this. You want to be sitting in cash and you want to.
00:26:53.046 - 00:27:47.584, Speaker B: And this plays into the setup as well, too, for the longer term people, you know, the people that are willing to think not quarters, but years and willing to DCA. And when something's, you know, bitcoin or crypto broadly is 50% off the top, that's when the DCA kicks in and they just keep DCA ing, basically. And there's a lot, there's a lot of capital like that. And the thing that makes this setup, you know, you got to remember about that setup is, like, if they are going to drive the train off of the recession and the asset price crash cliff, what's on the other side of that? Well, it's more QE than they've ever done before. It's rate cuts and more QE than they've ever done before. And so it's, and don't get me wrong, near, there'd be real pain in the near term, and it wouldn't be a COVID style crash would be my base case. But you could have a, you know, go look at, like, Q 418 in traditional asset classes would be like a decent corollary type of thing.
00:27:47.584 - 00:28:48.294, Speaker B: And, you know, crypto had its November 2018 moment, you know, right. Right in the midst of that. But that's the, the thing that makes even that, what I would say the bear scenario still bullish is the amount of cat. The cat's out of the bag about what you want to own in a loosening monetary policy environment. And the cat is out of the bag in terms of what comes after tightening. And the more aggressively they tighten, the faster and more aggressively they're going to have to loosen things back up. And that may be after, you know, some really nasty price action, or they may try and do, like I said, more of this shallow type of kiss zero GDP growth and pull it back up to manage inflation type of stuff, which that is my base case of, of what they're going to do.
00:28:48.294 - 00:29:57.618, Speaker B: But in any case, the sort of, like, long term, medium term outlook, the crossing the Rubicon in terms of the capital coming into this space that sees it as the next major leg of growth and innovation on planet Earth in general. We've covered so much ground in such a short amount of time. The thing that I always, that helps me frame this, you know, I write this monthly update letter, and at the beginning it's got these monthly highlights, these bullet points for the most, most sort of significant things that happened in that month. And then, because on our content website, I've got a page that has just the monthly highlights all in a row. Right. It's like last month, month before, month before that, all the way going back through 2020. And you can look at that page and you can see in one spot, and it helps you frame just how much room or how much ground the space is covered in general, but specifically, the capital raises, the project raises, and the fund raises.
00:29:57.618 - 00:30:49.008, Speaker B: And in the month of March, $100 million project raise was the 6th largest project raise in the month of March. And $100 million venture fund raise was the 6th largest venture fund raise in the month of March. Like that. That is, that capital is raised, that Runway is already there. There's a couple hundred projects that have multiple years of Runway already, and there's billions and billions of dry powder and venture capital that if not another dollar of venture capital is raised. You're sitting on years and years of deployment that ends up funding the innovation, that leads to the adoption that gets even more of this traditional capital into this thing. Yeah, that's a big, massive point.
00:30:49.096 - 00:31:12.228, Speaker D: Part I agree. I think, like, 2017, what people forget is what's different now is the capital formation side of things. A lot of 2017 was just rotating ETH gains into these projects. It wasn't really, like, permanent, more permanent, long term capital. In this case, you do. You have external capital that is deployed, is looking to deploy. And I think the two things that I've looked at recently is the rounds themselves.
00:31:12.228 - 00:31:42.784, Speaker D: Like traditional venture secondary markets have come down 20% in locks of the Nasdaq. The rounds are getting smaller or harder to finance. I think people being more disciplined in traditional venture. But crypto, you've seen these rounds. The pace hasn't really slowed down in many ways, which is very, very encouraging. And you have more funds looking at it. And so, and the other thing that I like to remind myself is, like, you look at the NBCA data top quartile venture fund, traditional venture fund was like two x 2.25
00:31:42.784 - 00:32:31.060, Speaker D: x, and that would have put you in the top quartile, like, last couple years. That's embarrassing if you're in crypto, I'm sorry, but, like, and so you look at that and you say, look, I'm not telling you to, like, deploy all of your capital in a crypto, but had you just deployed, again, if you took, like, a Moskowitz approach, and you would have deployed, like, a slice of your portfolio, like, I've known many venture funds that return their fund on one investment, like flow or Opensea or, I mean, it literally is what save their ass. Because the traditional software, like, they just are. I don't know. It's very competitive. And it's almost like you're left wondering, like, I think more of that. This is, I think, aligned with what I'm trying to say is, I think if they feel pain and traditional kind of value, like, you know, we works of the world or whatever, then you're kind of forced to look elsewhere.
00:32:31.060 - 00:32:51.226, Speaker D: Like, what is the next. Where am I going to actually deliver and clear my hurdle? I mean, yeah, it's. It's crypto. I agree with you. It's what three call it. You know, don't, don't control f crypto in any traditional crypto pitch deck, you're still, like, you're a heretic. But web, web3 is okay.
00:32:51.290 - 00:32:52.186, Speaker B: How great was that?
00:32:52.290 - 00:32:52.858, Speaker D: So good.
00:32:52.946 - 00:32:53.474, Speaker B: God, I love.
00:32:53.514 - 00:32:55.018, Speaker C: Amazing pivot. Yeah, an amazing.
00:32:55.106 - 00:32:56.770, Speaker D: It's really, it's really good.
00:32:56.962 - 00:33:14.706, Speaker C: Travis, what is, um, what is your. It's a. I love hearing this conversation between you two, by the way, because when I met Travis, he was 100% of the portfolio was in bitcoin, all in on bitcoin. So I want to flip that into a question, Travis, like, what is your, like, put your money where your mouth is. Like, what does your portfolio look like today?
00:33:14.850 - 00:33:49.846, Speaker B: May be helpful to just a minute on kind of history for Eki. So the large majority of what we've done over the last few years has been systematic models driven exposure to bitcoin with the purpose of outperforming just holding bitcoin. So we built proprietary statistical models. It's not high frequency, it's, like, mid range. So over, like, a multi week timeframe, you try and buy when you think it's undervalued and sell when you think it's overvalued. And you don't even have to. You certainly don't have to be perfect at it if you can be okay at that.
00:33:49.846 - 00:34:28.844, Speaker B: As the months turn into quarters, you can start compounding your out performance versus just holding bitcoin. And so when you look back over the history of the fund, we've outperformed holding bitcoin by a lot. And the large majority of our capital has been exposed to either bitcoin or cash in this kind of systematic strategy. So I think a couple things happened over the course of last year. We bought a little bit of Solana, and it turned into a lot of Solana because the price went up a lot. That was cool. To a lesser extent, we bought a little bit of FTT and it turned into a lot of FTT because the price went up a lot.
00:34:28.844 - 00:36:06.494, Speaker B: And so this sort of like, you know, 85% of our Aum that had been deployed into this BTC systematic strategy, it got to the point where we didn't have 85% of our portfolio deployed in that anymore because of these very small bets that sort of went up a lot. And then we just started specifically after Axie infinity happened last summer, we started doing a lot of work on metaverse and play to earn, and I got very compelled by the long term horizon for that. And that it just looked like this concept of play to earn, but it looked like that was the top of the second inning, that it was going to be a multi trillion dollar total addressable market, that it was going to be transformative globally, and that had the potential to make many, many people's lives better in a single generation, and specifically people that most need their lives to be made better. And the combination of all of those things got us super interested in that. So we've been, the portfolio has had pretty limited exposure to the hedge fund portfolio has had pretty limited exposure to the metaverse asset class, but we've been doing a ton of work on it. There's honestly not all that much in terms of liquid tokens today that's that compelling. We do like Defi kingdoms.
00:36:06.494 - 00:37:16.470, Speaker B: Shout out defi kingdoms. We think they've got a lot of cool stuff that's going on there. But we've been doing a lot of work in terms of understanding the landscape, doing a lot of framework in terms of trying to understand what innovation looks like in this space. And when new things come down the pipe, you know, we think these new things are going to be sufficient to attract the adoption that's required to sort of get these things scaled up in terms of user bases and that sort of deal. But, you know, I think what we have sort of come to the conclusion of is that, you know, one we're going to have, we're going to be doing a lot more emerging crypto sector investing in general at Ikigai, and I think you'll hear more from us on that and then specifically on this sort of like layer one smart contract and owning the innovation there relative to what's going on with BTC. I've never been a BTC maximalist. I think if you go back to pop's podcast in 2018, I said that exact same thing then, and it's been true.
00:37:16.470 - 00:38:09.764, Speaker B: The entire time we had a BTC centric strategy because we were trying to figure out a way to scale up the Aum of ikigai to get to the point where we're going to make sure we weren't going to go out of business like we had. We needed to create a business and we did that. We got a nice business. But then, you know, you get to that point and now it's like, okay, what's next? And, you know, my assessment of the risk adjusted return opportunity in crypto, broadly for you, systematic BTC relative to a bunch of other things out there, there's just other attractive stuff to do. And we're still going to be trading large cap systematically. We're broadening the quant research horizon in real time. So it's going to be this kind of, the hedge fund is going to be this kind of mix of ten or twelve large cap systematic plus I'd say, significant exposure to just emerging crypto sector, type of beta, boil all of that down.
00:38:09.764 - 00:38:13.680, Speaker B: The fund has about a 1% position in bitcoin right now.
00:38:13.792 - 00:38:21.088, Speaker C: So you've gone from 100, 100% allocated to bitcoin with system trading, like trading it systematically to now you're 1% in bitcoin.
00:38:21.136 - 00:38:26.656, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's right. And we've got a decent, we're sitting on a decent chunk of cash and we own a lot of ETH. Yeah.
00:38:26.800 - 00:38:29.844, Speaker C: What percentage of the liquid portfolios in ETH?
00:38:32.304 - 00:38:33.152, Speaker B: A lot.
00:38:33.288 - 00:38:34.560, Speaker C: You and Santiago both.
00:38:34.672 - 00:38:54.880, Speaker D: I mean, like, I'll jump in here, but like, listen, from my perspective, like, 98% of everyone in crypto. Okay, sure. There's a lot of asymmetry in privates, which you could argue is not very scalable. Not very scalable. I'm super active on the private side. It's not scalable as an institution level. Like the most asymmetry happens in sub, you know, $2 million raises.
00:38:54.880 - 00:39:16.784, Speaker D: Like, good luck trying to deploy more than 2030, $40 million in that strategy. Still, you do it because you outperform. And some of these can, can literally return a fund. Like some, like Stepn, for instance, alluvium now. But for the most part, it's really hard to outperform ETH in the long term. Like historically, it is just very hard. And you can argue that, like now with the merge and you earning a nice yield on that.
00:39:16.784 - 00:39:40.784, Speaker D: Like, I mean, as simple as this sounds like, people like to, like, justify to their lp's doing all these complex esoteric strategies. The reality is sometimes they just pay you to hold the underlying because they don't want to custody deal with all that stuff. Look at the grayscale premium. Those just the market telling you, I want someone to just hold this for me. Stake your ETH, earn 8% at 10%, 12%. I mean, holy shit. Then and there, you're, you're outperforming inflation.
00:39:40.784 - 00:40:07.638, Speaker D: Okay, fine. Use that capital then to rotate and invest in some of these private deals. And fine. Like, honestly, that strategy alone, if you do that, you're probably going to be in the top quartel crypto funds. And, yeah, most importantly, don't blow up because to your point, Travis, there is a probability in crypto and we will see. Every time I, I was like, are we ever going to see ETH below 2000? There's like a 20% probability that that happens. You want to be there to hit the bid.
00:40:07.638 - 00:40:09.434, Speaker D: You don't want to be there and get liquidated.
00:40:10.374 - 00:40:43.426, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I agree with, with all that, definitely staying in the game is paramount. The beta value creation of this asset class is going to be so, you know, I mean, the asset class is going to 10 trillion, I guess the most, you know, it's 2 trillion right now. It's going to ten. And that, you know, that's, that's like the most attractive risk reward on a five x that I think I could possibly imagine. And it's going high. You know, it's highly likely to go high.
00:40:43.426 - 00:41:34.764, Speaker B: It's not going to stop at 10 trillion. But, but you get my point. And it's like, you definitely want to make sure that you're just in the game for that and that, yeah. You don't blow yourself up on leverage and that sort of deal. I think another thing that I'd like to hear your thoughts on is like how the competitor layer one smart contract platforms come into play. And this is a conversation I've been having with other investors a lot about in this setup where ETH BTC looks like there's a clear path to, I would say, testing all time highs, if not breaking all time highs. It's about a $400 billion market cap right now, a little less than that.
00:41:34.764 - 00:42:13.682, Speaker B: It looks like one of the cleanest doubles this year from here that I could possibly imagine. One of the safest, highest rr doubles from here, I think I could possibly imagine. You're going to need a little help from the Fed. But to my point, I think there's a decent chance you can get it. But it's like if ETH is sitting there chilling at like $750 billion market cap, and you start looking at some of these other layer one smart contract platforms, like, how is the market going to be looking at these sorts of things? And what is that, that competition going to look like?
00:42:13.778 - 00:42:37.834, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, if I understand the question correctly, is, like, the ETH BTC trade is clean, and then you say, okay, should I also, like, rotate away from other l two s into ETH? Or how do you play that? Like, what does it mean once a merge goes in? Like, what does that mean for other l two s? And that narrative, which has always been ethereum, doesn't scale. Ethereum doesn't deliver as quickly on their roadmap. I'm going to invest in a more, perhaps centralized team that is going to execute and.
00:42:38.214 - 00:42:48.182, Speaker B: Sorry, just to clarify, I think l two s would be one trade, but then there's, like, saloona vax saloon of axe. Right.
00:42:48.318 - 00:42:48.994, Speaker D: And.
00:42:49.294 - 00:42:51.086, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I don't think.
00:42:51.110 - 00:43:17.354, Speaker C: I don't think the larger institution. Travis, I completely agree that. I think that this is a massive catalyst for ETH. And I think what happens is the institutions come in and start buying ETH for the first, like, in. In bulk, like, in the way that they did it after Paul Tudor Jones, after the having in 2020, and after Paul Tudor Jones kind of took away the career risk for bitcoin. That same thing happens with, with the merge. But I think what ends up happening is, like, they don't do it for tech technology reasons.
00:43:17.354 - 00:43:38.348, Speaker C: Like, I think Santiago is, like, maybe a little more ahead of the curve when it comes to just, like, what this ETH merge actually does and, like, L2s. I think just like any bull market in crypto for the. For all of time, they just. They buy ETH and then they want to push further out on the risk spectrum. Yeah, I don't think it's a. I don't think it's a tech trade. I think it's just looking to push further out on the risk spectrum.
00:43:38.348 - 00:43:55.864, Speaker C: And I think the difference is, like, in the last l one bull run, you had, like, salunivax, and now there's some other l one s that could be interesting that, like, you know, obviously, like, like, near is starting to get really in the narrative. And so I think that the. The l one space is just going to be a little, like, bigger and more established this time around.
00:43:56.684 - 00:44:25.884, Speaker B: I was going to ask you, like, do you have any view on the relative competitiveness of any of those alt, layer one ecosystems versus another? And let's not. Let's. Let's put ETH versus. In the rest of them aside, let's just look at this basket of soul. Luna Avax near to dot atom. You know, I don't know. That's probably the basket.
00:44:25.884 - 00:44:35.098, Speaker B: And like, just how's that slugfest gonna going to sort of play out? You know, in a world where ETH is like approaching a trillion dollar market.
00:44:35.146 - 00:45:48.714, Speaker D: Cap, I think people always want to replicate trades. And if you were, if you missed ETH, sometimes the best investments are just copying a trade, right? If something, like, for me it was, I saw what Axie did, I pass in the seed and I still think about that and lose sleep over it. And then I invested in illuvium right after because I said, okay, the market's telling you there's something here. Do people appreciate, like, it's a very, like very deep question that is seems to be a point of contention in the industry. Is, is it a winner take all market? Like, is ETH gonna suck the air out of the room and obliviate the need for other chains? Like, are you gonna have, and we're having this discussion, like, I think it was with Ilya and other folks is like, where do you like Ilya, the founder of Nir? It's like, is this a multi chain world? Do you believe that? And we were talking about layer zero guys, and the layer zero guys would tell you, no, no, no, it's going to be multiple chains and we're just going to route to the more efficient one. And I think, like, that's like, to me, that feels like a narrative that a lot of venture investors really understand. And so I think a lot of people are going to want to replicate the trade and say, okay, ETH is clearly, I think the correlation between Ethereum and this other basket for the most part, is going to be very strong.
00:45:48.714 - 00:46:04.024, Speaker D: If ETH does a five x, then probably some of these other ones, people might think that's going to probably do more than that. It carries more risk, but people don't really conceptualize that.
00:46:04.684 - 00:46:09.036, Speaker C: Trev, have you looked at the electric capital developer report? Have you seen this before?
00:46:09.180 - 00:46:11.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm familiar with it. I haven't looked at it recently.
00:46:11.612 - 00:46:46.446, Speaker C: This is the big question. If you look at the developers building like ETH is the runaway, right? And then kind of second up, you have Polkadot has the second most monthly active developers. The big, the, like, this is really what we're talking about though. Like this range where everything's just kind of stacked together and nothing's been breakaway, right? And like, this is where I think a lot of the money will be made is like, which one of these ecosystems, like they're all kind of floating around the same. You've got like avalanche and Terra and like you got flow and like near. And they're all kind of approached it differently and like that. I think this basket is where it starts to get really interesting.
00:46:46.550 - 00:46:54.446, Speaker B: Yeah. And then because like, you know, as an investor, do you just not get cute and just own the basket?
00:46:54.550 - 00:46:55.526, Speaker D: Just, just.
00:46:55.630 - 00:47:12.874, Speaker B: And some of them, some of them are going to underperform, some of them are going to outperform, but the blended return of the basket is going to be super attractive, basically. And then, you know, and then I think you end up arguing like, okay, how much ETH do I own versus, versus this basket of alt layer ones?
00:47:12.914 - 00:47:51.510, Speaker D: And I've been thinking about this a lot. Like, why doesn't bit wise or grayscale just create a rebalancing index of the top? Like ten and like, in a similar way, like, if you're not like a very deep, if you're not sequoia, it's kind of hard to outperform the Nasdaq. Like even Mark and recent, like, if you had like $10 million today, where were you put him as a gonna say, we're just buying Nasdaq in the S and P. Why? Because it auto rebalances to the top companies. So in a similar manner, like, I feel like, you know, there's a lot of stuff in the top ten that is absolute crap, dog shit, which I think is going to go away over the next five years. Ten years. As people kind of, as there are certain l ones that different from other times in the history of this market.
00:47:51.510 - 00:48:31.134, Speaker D: There's usability, there's applications like there's games being built. People are using these things and it's going to be harder to justify to people, why would you own Cardano or Ripple when you have an ecosystem like near terra Avalanche that are actually getting usability and traction? And so from that perspective, like, you almost want to own like an index that constantly rebalances and is giving you exposure to whatever gets adoption because, yeah, I don't think anyone is smart enough to understand how do this ecosystem is going to look like five years from now, let alone ten. Right. And if you're not doing this kind of full time, which is even hard to keep up with, you kind of just want to own the index that rebalances.
00:48:32.754 - 00:49:33.254, Speaker B: You can even be really keeping up with it and still have a hard time, I think, outperforming that in a lot of cases one thing I wanted to mention after that ETH versus BTC portfolio allocation comment there is the medium. You know, I would say this would be kind of the second half of this decade type of trade, I think is that. And I think about this a lot. Like, so I think the way that bitcoin goes to like 500,000 and beyond per BTC is just. It slowly starts to be adopted as pristine collateral. This, this moniker, pristine collateral is the. It's the way that for the last year or longer, I framed like, how does BTC, you know, go a lot higher from here? And it has the characteristics to be pristine collateral.
00:49:33.254 - 00:50:47.256, Speaker B: The US dollar is the world reserve currency, but us treasuries are the, you know, in a. In a debt based global financial system like we have, it's collateral that matters. Treasuries are the collateral foundation of that global financial system. Treasuries as a financial instrument have a challenged outlook in the course of this decade and the next. I think just most recently, the sanctions that you saw happen with Ukraine, again, puts this, like, interesting next step on what do FX reserves really mean for sovereigns? And I think that over a longer period of time, that's another sort of feather in bitcoin's cap, I think, as pristine collateral. Although I guess in theory, if the central bank of Russia were holding their $20 billion or whatever worth of bitcoin on their treasure and chainalysis has that marked as Russia's bitcoin, and then they can't move it in the same way that they just sanction Russia's FX reserves. I don't know exactly how that happens.
00:50:47.256 - 00:51:34.158, Speaker B: But anyways, bitcoin is pristine collateral, and that can be very slow adoption. That's just like slowly marching towards that over the course of this decade. And it's not like it has to get to the end of this decade, and it's like, oh, bitcoin's now replaced us treasuries. That's not what I mean at all. It's just this sort of slow march towards being accepted as pristine collateral. The pipes and the infrastructure being built for it to act as pristine collateral, both on the, on the institutional side, but I think also on the individual side as well too. Like just holding some bitcoin, borrowing dollars against that, paying some reasonable rate of interest to do that at a reasonable loan to value, and as long, like that's just a better alternative than a credit card.
00:51:34.158 - 00:52:43.930, Speaker B: And then interesting to see what's happening with, as a reserve asset with some of these stable coins. That's a totally different ball of wax. But the question, or the comment I was going to say, and maybe the question I was going to pose back was you run down a handful of years and bitcoin wrapped bitcoin works seamlessly in all these layer one smart contracts. And it's cheap, it's safe, it's. You can, you can bridge really quickly and cheaply, it works really awesome. And you can use bitcoin, as, you know, the engine to go do all of the innovative stuff that you want to do, where the innovation has happened on these layer one smart contract platforms. And does the market start to realize that in that world, that in that seamless world, do you actually want to just hold the thing that has the most money ness? And does that end up going back to bitcoin? And there's some chance that that happens.
00:52:43.930 - 00:53:11.644, Speaker B: In my head there's. It's not near term. And it would be my base case that layer ones would massively outperform over, you know, probably many years before the, or multiple years before the market starts coming to this realization that, like, you know, where do you actually want to hold bitcoin? So I'd be curious if you had any, if you've ever thought about that before.
00:53:11.944 - 00:53:39.834, Speaker D: I think these are all really good. Like the. I really love your framing around pristine collateral, especially given sort of the geopolitical situation that's good and bad. Candidly, there is a version of this world where it becomes problematic. And I think the European Union has been a little bit slower. I think it's been very encouraging on the regulatory side of things. From what I hear in the US and the UK, the EU has kind of struggled to get around it.
00:53:39.834 - 00:54:04.676, Speaker D: But pristine collateral, I mean, this is something that I tell my friends from, like, they're so skeptical in this industry. Hey, give me an asset that is perfectly collateral, that is perfectly transparent, 24 7365 in real time, you can inspect it and you have full custody over it. Like 2008 wouldn't have happened. And they're like, yeah, and you can build a whole suite of products around that. Um, so I don't think that narrative is actually. I hope that. I think it's.
00:54:04.676 - 00:54:18.432, Speaker D: It would be wise for bitcoin to kind of adopt that narrative, uh, more and more, um, as opposed to just like, we're going to blow up, like, the world as we know, and this is going to be the new utopia, which is difficult, but I think you're.
00:54:18.448 - 00:54:26.088, Speaker C: Starting to see it with what do is doing, like, what LFG is doing. That is the pristine collateral narrative right there in effect.
00:54:26.216 - 00:55:06.674, Speaker D: Yeah, but I want to get your pulse on like bitcoin, and you've been close to it, Travis, just given your exposure, there is this camp within the bitcoin community that says, wait a minute, no, we're going to build smart contracts here like the sovereign. There's, we can build applications on top of the bitcoin network. You have lightning. Do you think about that? Do you think it's credible? It sounds like obviously you're more excited about ethereum and other smart contract, more generalized smart contract platforms to take that role. But is there a play here where bitcoin might catch up and then some because it has a network effects? It's still the king.
00:55:09.404 - 00:55:47.338, Speaker B: I do not have a view on the viability or the timeline of smart contracts on top of bitcoin. I don't and I don't have, I don't, I don't have a view on the developer talent that's working on that. I guess we all know there's a, there's a trip, there's a massive lack of, you know, the folks that can actually build this stuff. And I'm always very clear to point out I am not one of those people. And hats off to them because if it wasn't for them, none of us would be sitting here doing that and we need more of them. But I don't have a view on.
00:55:47.346 - 00:55:53.374, Speaker C: It that feels like the biggest contrarian trade in crypto right now. Is that bitcoin defi actually works?
00:55:54.074 - 00:55:56.362, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:55:56.498 - 00:56:29.430, Speaker D: I mean you post these weekly update, monthly updates, quarterly updates to your investors. Youre on top of the market. How much do you rebalance your portfolio? To what extent are you willing to make big changes to it or are you more methodical? Youre processing information, but it takes you time to reposition the portfolio. Im curious if you consider yourself more an investor, a trader, because crypto allows you to do both. I don't know to what extent successfully.
00:56:29.462 - 00:57:14.514, Speaker B: But yeah, I would say kind of both. Yeah. I think we have done sort of little bits of liquid venture type of exposure in the hedge fund. We're going to be doing more of that. We've done some sort of qualitative fundamental based exposure and are going to be doing more of that. And then we've done a lot of systematic models driven BTC type of exposure and that exposure can move around a lot, a lot. So like that can get pretty whippy, especially during periods of high market volatility.
00:57:14.814 - 00:57:46.264, Speaker D: Yeah. And I guess maybe the last question for me is how do you, how do you see the kind of landscape from here on the investing side, capital formation side? Do you worry about rentech coming in, more sophisticated folks than tradfi coming in? And what does that do to returns? What does that do to your edge? And maybe even perhaps in more general, what is your edge as a, an investor?
00:57:50.684 - 00:57:52.700, Speaker C: The hard question for the last one.
00:57:52.892 - 00:58:50.244, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's a great question. I think from before we even launched ikiguy, we launched the fund December of 18. From before we even launched the fund, we knew we wanted to be really dynamic. We knew we're going to need to be very dynamic. And so we wrote the offering documents of the hedge fund to be super broad, where we can kind of do whatever we want to with very little exception, because it was just like we were big believers in the asset class and in the technology, and we're also just big believers that we were going to need to shuffle our feet a lot. And so I think we've been having that as, you know, a central part of how we approach the market for that entire period of time. I'm also, I'm risk averse as a person.
00:58:50.244 - 00:59:17.592, Speaker B: I'm risk averse as an investor. And people would think that was crazy. I had, like, a career in traditional hedge fund investing, and then I left point 72 to go start a crypto hedge fund, which people think of that as being like a very risk seeking behavior. But I really, like, I would never go bungee jumping or skydiving or, I don't like to gamble. I've never been to a horse track. I've never bet on a sporting event with a bookie in my life. And, like, I don't know, when I looked at crypto, I thought it was the most attractive risk adjusted reward.
00:59:17.592 - 00:59:26.184, Speaker B: I, in summer 2017, I thought it was the most attractive risk adjusted bet I'd ever seen in my life. And that's why I left traditional or come do this and.
00:59:26.304 - 00:59:33.364, Speaker D: You mean you feel the safest owning crypto, as volatile as it is, but it feels safe.
00:59:33.504 - 01:01:03.180, Speaker B: Yeah, just, just, you know, back then, I thought it looked incredible, and it still looks incredible because it's, the numbers have gone up a lot. So sort of their expected return has gone down some, you could argue, but the risk has gone down so much. Like, in some ways, like, the risk adjusted returns, like, the best it's ever been right now with, like, you know, all these, you know, a lot of this stuff, 30, 40, 50 plus percent off the top, depending on where you look at. But the outlook is so apparently obvious about where this is going, but not to get sidetracked from your question. So I think we always thought that we could have, the analogy we like to use is like, courtside tickets to the basketball game, and we've got courtside tickets to the basketball game being real close to this ecosystem, and we don't know which team is going to win yet. And the team that may end up winning the championship may not have even come around yet, potentially, but we've got front row seats and that we can kind of see the game develop and that we can kind of, you know, move around accordingly. And I think doing that in the context of being, you know, somewhat, you know, reasonably risk averse and with the understanding that there's going to be tremendous beta value creation of the space.
01:01:03.180 - 01:02:36.984, Speaker B: So just being in the space and, you know, avoiding the landmines, avoiding the blow ups, avoiding the hacks, that if you had outside exposure to a hack, could be potentially, you know, existential risk to your, to your business, right. If you got 30% of your fund farming Ronin or something like that, then, like, potentially that could be existential risk to your business, right. And so avoiding those types of things and being willing to move your feet along the way as new information becomes available, I always just thought that was going to work out well for our investors and work out well for us. I think that continues to be the case. I think it was really last summer that it was my, which certainly wasn't particularly early, but it was really last summer that it was like, I started to think about owning the innovation that was happening at the smart contract layer and that versus like, you know, the digital gold narrative of bitcoin and how the market was going to think through assigning value to that. And I mean, like I said, we haven't even talked about metaverse or play to earn yet, but we think there's, there's tremendous opportunity there as well, too. And we have been, and we'll continue to be spending a bunch of time there.
01:02:37.154 - 01:02:58.064, Speaker D: Maybe I will say it's the last question, but I just have the converse that, which is, you've been in the space for a long time. You're here, you've survived, adapted your thesis. What's been the worst mistake? Wow, I've certainly made a ton, Jason. Probably too.
01:02:59.164 - 01:02:59.700, Speaker B: None.
01:02:59.772 - 01:03:05.114, Speaker C: No mistakes for me. Flawless execution.
01:03:05.734 - 01:03:52.574, Speaker B: So the one that comes to mind, I've made so many that it's, you know, it's got how much time we have. The one that immediately popped in my head that I think so the way we generally, in our systematic strategy, the way we generally manage exposure is, it's like models that tell you where your exposure should be, and then a discretionary overlay that sits on top, which is, like, my discretion, basically. And so a lot of what I do is, like, read our models. Like, I trade our models, kind of, and my discretion, the manner and degree to which my discretion has been involved in our investment process, has ebbed and flowed over the last few years. There's been periods of time. There's been very little discretion. There's been periods of time where there's been more discretion.
01:03:52.574 - 01:04:24.156, Speaker B: Late last year was a period of time where we had, I would say, more discretion than less. And I think a mistake that I would say was in late November when. When Jay pal came out and said, it's time to retire the word transitory. Like, I should have just gotten the fuck out and just, like. Like, just sold a ton right then. And. And I have.
01:04:24.156 - 01:04:51.064, Speaker B: I think if you line up 100 crypto fund managers in a row, I think. I'm not trying to toot my own horn here. I think I understand macro better than, like, I don't know, 95 or so of, like, crypto hedge fund managers. I've just spent a lot of time on it. It's where my career path was before crypto. So it was something that was, like, right up my alley to understand. We just didn't get out of the way of it nearly as much as I would have liked.
01:04:51.064 - 01:05:27.560, Speaker B: And it was a combination of, like, not seeing in the quantitative stuff, not seeing, like, because if you look at the chart, bitcoin went down 50% in a straight line after. After that. And we didn't see the stuff in all the quant stuff we look at, we didn't really see, like, a down 50% of straight move in a straight line, that kind of move on the table. And I kind of saw, you know, some. I thought maybe we could have a decent January with a bunch of new inflows type of stuff happening. And I just. We didn't take nearly as much of our exposure down as I would have liked.
01:05:27.560 - 01:05:52.788, Speaker B: And the fact that it happened from, like, a macro centric move, I just would have thought that we could have played that a little better. So that was the first thing that came to mind. But it's like, you know, certainly didn't blow the fund. You know, we're in a totally fine spot. So it's like, yeah, we didn't win that one, but, like, we're in a completely fine spot at the same time, too. And so it's like, you know, you always want to make sure that, you know, you're certainly around to keep playing the game.
01:05:52.836 - 01:06:16.260, Speaker D: So, you know, you could have said, like, oh, shit, I could have done this, could have done that. And crypto, I mean, there's so many things you. I shouldn't have sold that shit coin. That Solana at one point was a shitcode. And then, but, like, I feel like if you. If you recriminate yourself too much, you can just, like, paralyze yourself. Like, do you think about these things a lot, or do you kind of say, okay, you know, you know what we were going to learn from this time to move on?
01:06:16.452 - 01:06:40.330, Speaker B: Yeah. It's much more. So the latter. It has to be the latter. Public enemy, the rap group, don't let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart is a really, really good one. But, but I think, and, you know, if you're running a investment process at a fund, then you have to be able to, like, let it go. But then at the same, when you're.
01:06:40.330 - 01:07:27.788, Speaker B: When you're. When you're existing in this shuffle your feet world, like I just talked about, you also have to be like, okay, is there something that we need to shift about our investment process? You look back and you go, okay, what happened there? Good or bad? And then, like, is there. Do we need to do more of this? Do we need to do less of that? Are we being. And it's part of what makes this so challenging, because you have to be responsive without chasing. But, like, sometimes you sort of, like, want to chase, because if you. If you realize that you should shift, if you. If you shuffle your feet at the beginning of, like, some secular shift that's happening in crypto, then that, that feet shuffle, that chase, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, oh, I'm gonna like chase nfts in August of 2021.
01:07:27.788 - 01:07:55.256, Speaker B: Well, if you've been chasing nfts since August 2021, I think that's probably worked out really well for you. Right? Like, and so it's. That's part of what makes. Makes this challenging and the. Yeah, so it's, it's like existing in this dynamic landscape where, you know, you. You need to evolve your investment process while, you know, simultaneously, you know, yeah, you cannot. You can't, you know, all.
01:07:55.256 - 01:07:58.328, Speaker B: If you let it eat you up, it'll. You'll go crazy. Yeah.
01:07:58.456 - 01:08:01.680, Speaker C: Travis, awesome podcast. Awesome conversation.
01:08:01.792 - 01:08:06.688, Speaker D: We thought this was going to be a weekly update. This turned out to be a philosophical discussion and more about ikigai.
01:08:06.856 - 01:08:11.376, Speaker C: Yeah, we had this book for our weekly roundup, and, man, you know, for.
01:08:11.400 - 01:08:39.954, Speaker D: Better or for worse, continue to be front and center in all of what we, you know, think about affects crypto. To think that it doesn't is delusional. So let's get you on, you know, as many times as you want. We can talk about macro all day long, and I can't because I'm not an expert on it, but you certainly, you certainly know your stuff, so we'd love to have you on in the pod again. And it's been a true delight, I think, for anyone that wants to get access to your letters. Do you publish those or where can people get a peek into your brain and more of what you have to offer?
01:08:40.294 - 01:09:00.999, Speaker B: Yeah, Twitter is always good. Travis, underscore Kling and the. You can sign up for the monthly update letters. We have a content depot called kanaand Katana.com, which is the pin and the sword in Japanese. So that's where we can sign up for the monthly update letters. You can see all the historical monthly update letters there.
01:09:00.999 - 01:09:05.423, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's a good spot for that stuff. Appreciate the time, guys. I enjoy the conversation.
01:09:05.543 - 01:09:06.823, Speaker C: I'll get the link. I'll get the link.
01:09:06.863 - 01:09:07.079, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:09:07.111 - 01:09:10.060, Speaker C: And trav, be well. Always a pleasure, and I will talk to you soon.
01:09:10.172 - 01:09:11.924, Speaker D: Take care, my friend. Take care.
