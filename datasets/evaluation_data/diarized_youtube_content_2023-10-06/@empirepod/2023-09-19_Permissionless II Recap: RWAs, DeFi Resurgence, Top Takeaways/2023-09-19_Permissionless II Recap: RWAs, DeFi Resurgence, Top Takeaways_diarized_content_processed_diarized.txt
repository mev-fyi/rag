00:00:00.400 - 00:00:51.990, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent and decentralized oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces Oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about Chronicle later in the show. Hey everyone, before we get into today's episode, I want to take a second to acknowledge vouch. With over 4000 startups insured from napkin sketch ideas to large ipos, Vouch is the insurer of choice for crypto companies, including l one s, l two s, daos, protocols and a whole lot more. Their exclusive coverages are enhanced for crypto, covering everything from regulatory defense to smart contract vulnerabilities. With vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind so you can keep on building.
00:00:51.990 - 00:01:17.200, Speaker A: You'll hear more about vouch later in the show. Alright, everyone, we missed you last week. Santi and I were both at permissionless. My voice is slightly recovered, but I'm running on like 30%. It feels like half the people I know got like bronchitis, laryngitis, some sort of COVID between, between permissionless and token 2049. And there's some event in Germany as well. I feel like half the industry is hurting right now.
00:01:17.200 - 00:01:18.992, Speaker A: So, I mean, it's always true that.
00:01:19.008 - 00:01:25.928, Speaker B: Like, the market does puke every time there's big conferences, the market just will do some big movement. It's always consensus.
00:01:26.056 - 00:01:27.818, Speaker A: We did that. We gave people sell off.
00:01:27.936 - 00:01:56.714, Speaker B: We get, we get, we'll see what's going on. Maintenance is happening. I guess next week, one thing we'll say, the reason why we met, we usually are not here to blame, but the reason why we missed the podcast is I had to catch a flight and we went to the booth, cracking booth, nice little, kind of like aquarium, and it was occupied by the gentlemen of mankliss, you know, Ryan was there. And so, you know, we play nice. And so we said, hey, look, you know, just, you know, record and whatnot, and we can do it. So anyways, here we are.
00:01:56.794 - 00:02:05.154, Speaker A: So Santi never preps for any of these episodes. And I forced Santi, I said, you're off the show if you don't do some damn research.
00:02:05.234 - 00:02:09.570, Speaker B: So he dm'd me at 11:00 p.m. Last night, said, you have to like, do your work.
00:02:09.602 - 00:02:11.362, Speaker A: I'm like, you're not impressed? Are you telling.
00:02:11.418 - 00:02:17.042, Speaker B: Is this a subtle way of telling me that I've like, just, I suck at this? And, you know, honestly, maybe it's true.
00:02:17.178 - 00:02:23.082, Speaker A: If there's one takeaway from permissionless two years in the bear market, you just gotta work harder, man. You just gotta work harder. That's the way to get through this.
00:02:23.138 - 00:02:25.922, Speaker B: So, okay, here's what I asked.
00:02:26.018 - 00:02:49.054, Speaker A: So here's what I want to talk about. I wanted to talk about just takeaways from the conference. I think it was a kind of classic bear market conference in a lot of ways. And I'd be very curious to hear your. I know you weren't able to make it last year. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if you've been to our other conferences, digital asset summit, kind of our other buttoned up conference brand, but I think this might have been the first blockworks event you've.
00:02:49.054 - 00:03:00.492, Speaker A: That you've ever attended. So I'd just be curious. Maybe we can go, like, takeaway for takeaway. You share takeaway, I'll share takeaway. Yeah. Yeah. Just be curious to hear overarching thoughts on the event and maybe get into your first takeaway.
00:03:00.628 - 00:03:30.202, Speaker B: Well, before I. Before we do that, I just want to put out on the record that for history. Yes, I have not attended a blockwork sponsored event. Not only that, but the reason why we're here is because I got rejected first time by these two gentlemen, Mike and Yano, when I suggested to them that we should do a DeFi podcast while I was at Pear Fi, and Defi was not even a thing. And that was right before Defi summer. So I got rejected, and the best way to get my attention is to reject me. So it took the second chance, and then finally we did.
00:03:30.202 - 00:03:35.154, Speaker B: We actually started the podcast when DeFi was, like, ended. And it's been a real bear market.
00:03:35.234 - 00:03:37.242, Speaker A: January 2020, and you're like, totally.
00:03:37.338 - 00:04:14.874, Speaker B: We totally missed the opportunity to do a great podcast. Candidly, it would have been difficult because I was so busy while I said a paraphy. But anyways, one of the. And I'll start with. I guess my first observation is, if you were to kind of take a sample size of the conversations that were happening on these, kind of, either during panels or inside conversations and events that we were at, with fund managers, with investors, just people in the industry and builders, is it feels like there is renewed interest in DeFi. Not all pockets of DeFi, but the key word here is real world assets. It was something that was discussed heavily in the conference.
00:04:14.874 - 00:04:40.520, Speaker B: Not everyone agrees that it's going to be a category, but I was in the panel of who's still investing in crypto, which admittedly could have been a very short panel because no one is investing in crypto these days, which is another takeaway of mine that I'll get to later. But I think real world assets was one of probably the main topics of conversation, whether you believe that to be real or not. I think it was one of the things that, throughout the conference, was buzzing.
00:04:40.652 - 00:04:41.248, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:04:41.376 - 00:04:53.096, Speaker B: You know, like. Like an ETH Paris. It was like, you know, layer twos, your knowledge proofs, like roll ups. This theme, thematic. One of the big themes was real world essence. I don't know if you'd agree with that.
00:04:53.280 - 00:05:04.444, Speaker A: I would agree and disagree. So do you remember, I don't know if you caught chow. Oh, you were on with Chow. Yeah. Yeah. So you're one of. I think one of the best panels was you and chow.
00:05:04.444 - 00:05:19.202, Speaker A: Vance, who is the fourth? Kyle Samani. Kyle, I thought Tom did a great job moderating that, but chaos thing. He said, the real world asset is a fake narrative. And I'd be curious what you thought of if you remember when he said that.
00:05:19.338 - 00:06:15.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I think his point was, look, stable coins are real world assets, like USCC is a real world asset. And I think his point was more nuanced around the way we characterize and describe real world assets as a catch all phrase. And so we ought to be a little bit more discerning when it comes to talking about real world assets, which is. What exactly are we talking about here? Because it is a catch all category. And I think his point was we ought to be a little bit more discerning. And part of the conversation was a 40 minutes panel, but we could have gone on another panel separately, just purely talking about the different classifications and buckets of real world assets that we think are going to get more traction and some that will not. The second observation was, particularly talking about use cases, was certain real world assets lend themselves more to gaining traction on chain than others that just will not and just probably deserve not to even have a crypto native, like.
00:06:15.950 - 00:06:18.390, Speaker B: Like, wrapper to it, if you will.
00:06:18.502 - 00:06:54.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So to this takeaway, I would say I agree. I think one of the clear takeaways from this event is that the two main ways that you kind of import yield into crypto today are, I think, maker actually does a pretty good job of importing yield. It kind of is a tedious process. You have to do, like, the steakhouse team does a lot of work there. You have to value off chain assets, but they do a good job of importing some of this higher yield on chain, and then stable coins import yield on chain. And I think one takeaway that I had from this conference is in the coming year or years, we're going to find and develop more ways to import yield on chain.
00:06:54.714 - 00:07:08.410, Speaker A: And actually, I forget if Leshner said this on stage, but he said this to me offstage. He said, I really hate this idea of real world assets, because what you're actually saying when you say the word real world is you're saying that on chain is not the real world.
00:07:08.442 - 00:07:08.706, Speaker B: It's not.
00:07:08.730 - 00:07:22.258, Speaker A: It's not implicitly, they're not real assets. So there are traditional assets and there are crypto assets, or there are off chain assets and they're on chain. But I think this idea of real world assets is. I don't know, we always get the.
00:07:22.266 - 00:07:23.306, Speaker B: Nomenclature wrong in crypto.
00:07:23.330 - 00:07:23.778, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:23.906 - 00:07:24.354, Speaker B: Terrible.
00:07:24.434 - 00:07:28.782, Speaker A: It never changes, by the way. You can never change a term once it's declared.
00:07:28.838 - 00:07:39.358, Speaker B: We did crypto, then blockchain, not, not crypto. And equity, not tokens, and then web three. And anyways, we do certain things very well as an industry, but nomenclature is not one of them.
00:07:39.406 - 00:07:44.994, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so take away your takeaway. Number one is real world assets are coming more ways to import yield on chain.
00:07:45.294 - 00:07:46.054, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:46.214 - 00:07:52.800, Speaker A: And do you think that this is, remember, in 2018, it's like very tokenized real estate 2019, like token.
00:07:52.902 - 00:08:00.556, Speaker B: Do you look, I mean, I know you want to get to your takeaway, but maybe I'll cheat. And this is a big takeaway. A second takeaway of mine.
00:08:00.580 - 00:08:01.548, Speaker A: Yeah, give me number two.
00:08:01.676 - 00:08:12.276, Speaker B: It is. It is very common in bear markets to be skeptical of things that have been tried before. Meaning, in this case, harbor, like harbor was a tokenization platform.
00:08:12.380 - 00:08:13.652, Speaker A: It sold harbor.
00:08:13.748 - 00:08:28.768, Speaker B: Yeah. A lot of, like, crypto, like ogs, like, or even, like, in the private sector. Remember harbor? It was super hyped. There was a lot of interest, and it didn't get traction. It didn't fulfill its promise, but it's very common. It's not to say that, like, things, and this happened on the Internet. Right? Like, pets.com
00:08:28.768 - 00:08:46.044, Speaker B: failed, and then you saw, like, you know, the same model with a different kind of different infrastructure that allowed for that. It was a good idea. It was just like, it was the right time. It was too early. The infrastructure was not there. And I think that's the state where crypto is today. It is very, and you see a lot of skepticism within crypto around these ideas.
00:08:46.044 - 00:08:57.750, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it's just important to be mindful of things that have been tried in the past, revisit some of those with because the infrastructure has come a long way. And so that's like my takeaway number two. Right. You would have as you.
00:08:57.782 - 00:08:58.318, Speaker A: As you.
00:08:58.366 - 00:09:08.454, Speaker B: As happened now, real world assets are quite polarizing. Tokenization of these things is very polarizing because it failed before. And so it's just mindful to be. You have to be mindful that.
00:09:08.614 - 00:09:21.280, Speaker A: So that's my, one of my takeaways, I'll jump into the front, is that the most bullish people in this market seem to be actually some of the traditional capital markets players and not just.
00:09:21.312 - 00:09:23.484, Speaker B: You stole my thunder, too. That was my third.
00:09:24.024 - 00:09:25.272, Speaker A: Yeah, that's your third. Yeah.
00:09:25.288 - 00:09:25.984, Speaker B: There you go.
00:09:26.104 - 00:09:44.832, Speaker A: I mean, it's tied into that one, though. It's not just the capital markets players, but it's, I mean, a very overlooked announcement, I will say was layer Zero took the stage with Google. Right. Google put on some heavy hitters onto the main stage. Right. They were the last panel on the main stage. And I think you're seeing, like.
00:09:44.832 - 00:09:47.124, Speaker A: Right, layer Zero's partnership with Google.
00:09:47.464 - 00:09:49.648, Speaker B: This is around the oracle, right. Solution.
00:09:49.736 - 00:09:51.912, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Recent developments, which a lot of, a.
00:09:51.928 - 00:09:59.044, Speaker B: Lot of link marines came out saying, like, this is, this is counter crypto decentralization, like yada yada. But yeah, it was. Yeah.
00:09:59.424 - 00:10:22.824, Speaker A: Which I get. And I think Uma, the Uma founder, heart pushback on that as well. Like, which I totally get. I think that's a fair pushback. But there's, like, legitimate big players coming in. Paypal, what is it? Py USD, stablecoin visas, expansion into stablecoin settlement on Solana, Blackrock ETF developments that were talked about. There were some.
00:10:22.824 - 00:10:38.064, Speaker A: Franklin Templeton spoke there. There were some really big asset managers that sent like ten people there. They didn't speak. They wouldn't speak. They wouldn't let us say that they were there. But if you were at the party.
00:10:38.574 - 00:10:59.966, Speaker B: Not only investors, but there were also builders. Right. And it was interesting. I mean, right before permissionless, we had, Tyron from JP Morgan was on the podcast. And it was very illuminating to hear. I mean, when I was a JP Morgan, you couldn't even whisper crypto in the elevator. You would have been, you know, like Jamie was calling on the rat poison and whatnot camp.
00:10:59.966 - 00:11:32.108, Speaker B: But it was very interesting. People go, should go listen to that podcast. And even he was. He was at the conference, was great to catch up with him. I mean, we could have done two or three more episodes to cover the different kind of components of what JPMorgan is building. It is a bit frustrating because a lot of that because of lack of privacy, they cannot operate in a kind of open environment like Ethereum. But it was quite illuminating to hear him and his, the interest, particularly in this market conditions, of how much buying there is within the organization, how much interest there is.
00:11:32.108 - 00:12:22.122, Speaker B: And that's not just jpMorgan. I think you and I were talking about that. There are, there were so many other, not just investors, family offices, endowments that were there because I think, like an event like permissionless, really, the composition of the crowd, and I said it before, is one of the reasons why I wanted to go, because I think it's, it's more diverse. It's not super, like crypto native, purely, but there were a lot of corporations that were there and have been doing work for like six years. And the question was, hey, does Terra, the regulatory environment, like Luna, all these blow ups, like, does that, like, has that been more of an uphill battle internally to convince management that this is something that is worthwhile and they're like, on the margin. Some, like JP Morgan, like, yeah, like, allocators have certainly, like, interest has waned, but we're still moving along. I mean, there's, we've done the work.
00:12:22.122 - 00:12:33.128, Speaker B: We appreciate the opportunity. It's going to be big one day, and we cannot wait for that date to come because we need to be thinking about, we need to be thinking ahead to gain an edge on our competitors.
00:12:33.216 - 00:12:33.488, Speaker A: Yep.
00:12:33.536 - 00:12:40.640, Speaker B: And that's true for PayPal, stripe, JPMorgan, so many others that I think were at the event that you and I and others met with that it was really interesting to see.
00:12:40.752 - 00:12:48.644, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so we have takeaway number one. We're figuring out more ways to import yield on chain takeaway number two. What was your second takeaway?
00:12:49.104 - 00:13:30.132, Speaker B: Well, my second takeaway was, what was that? Particularly amongst crypto investors, I think there is a cohort that is now thinking about ideas that have been tried in prior cycles and appreciate that there's more infrastructure, and we ought to revisit some of those in the panel. We had Vance framework, Kyle myself, we're all actively investing, Xiao from DeFi alliance, and we all were in agreement when we said, yeah, like, this time is different in the sense that infrastructure has come a long way since 2018, that we ought to revisit certain use cases like real world assets. So that was my second takeaway number two.
00:13:30.188 - 00:13:48.674, Speaker A: Takeaway number three. I would say the industry is gaining legitimacy even in pretty crappy markets. And there are a lot more like web two and specifically capital markets players there that are more actively participating than you could ever imagine. So that's number three. Number four, maybe I'll throw a spicier one in here, and I'll try to maybe get you to push back a little.
00:13:48.714 - 00:13:54.014, Speaker B: We haven't been spicy enough. Okay. All right.
00:13:54.554 - 00:14:51.684, Speaker A: So when you pull up crypto Twitter, I think crypto Twitter narrative has always had this kind of ethereum tilt to it. And no wonder why it's obviously the biggest smart contract l one. It did feel like these kind of worlds of l one s are converging. And it felt like if you listen to folks on stage, whether it's Ben from optimism or Steven from arbitrary, Ethan Buckman from Cosmos, Anatoly from Solana, it feels like a lot of the issues that say Solana's dealing with, they're peeking over at other chains to see how they're solving it. It seems like the issues that optimism is about to start facing, those are the classic cosmos issues. Value capture on the op token, coordinating upgrades, interoperability between things built on optimism. Those are things cosmos has been trying to figure out for years.
00:14:51.684 - 00:15:29.608, Speaker A: Soon, once they figure that out, they're going to be forced to contend with the classic Solana problem. Low latency, high throughput, things like that. It feels like these blockchains are converging both in goals. App chain thesis used to be a cosmos thing. Now it's an ethereum thing as well, converging in goals, but also in problems that they're trying to contend with. And it makes me wonder if the future is multi, if the future is multi chain, or if just these folks are all just learning from each other, and one l, one will win out against the other. The other thing here was like, I don't know, Monad.
00:15:29.608 - 00:15:50.398, Speaker A: Some folks were talking about Monad parallelizing the eVM, uh, the launch of roll ups like eclipse. Right. Using the SVM. Um, the innovation still is not done on this front, I would say. And so there's still. Even though it feels like there are too many l two s, too many, you know, kind of all l one s. Like, there's still a ton of innovation going on in this front, so.
00:15:50.446 - 00:16:37.766, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I certainly agree. Look, I mean, I think, uh, crypto Twitter can be quite toxic, especially when people losing money, um, people fight. Like, the level of negativity and social media goes up, I think, during these environments, but also, I think the folks that remain here and are still building, it also brings you together in some capacity, which I think dovetails to what you just said, which is there's a. Even for the conference I think there's more scrutiny and open dialogue within the ethereum community around raising awareness, around, hey, optimism doesn't have for our proofs. Let's talk about that. How is that any different than Solana? We criticize Solana for some things, but is it more secure or less secure? You don't have fraud proofs. That's a bigger issue.
00:16:37.950 - 00:16:38.382, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:38.438 - 00:17:13.836, Speaker B: And so I think the intellectual honesty within the Ethereum community, I've sensed it as of recently, has shifted, tilted towards the better, and openly having these discussions around value capture. I think you look to other chains that have struggled out. There's sort of like two worlds, if you will. On one end, crypto, Twitter is quite toxic. People are waiting for, you know, or losing patience. There's despair, people lose money. But also, there's also kind of a collective like, hey, we're all in this together.
00:17:13.836 - 00:17:28.613, Speaker B: We're kind of suffering a bit. It feels like nothing's going on. But there's a lot of building in the background and I think builders really are probably coming together more in this environment, like bunker and down and trying to learn from each other to kind of weather the storm. And so that's, that's really good. I think that's quite productive.
00:17:28.733 - 00:18:18.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Another, can I, let me add one more takeaway kind of related to this one, which was takeaway number two, is that it felt like people are kind of getting frustrated with some of Ethereum's, the complexity of Ethereum, I would call it, and looking over folks in Ethereum, kind of looking over their shoulder at other ecosystems, saying, I love the simplicity of that. And I think that Ethereum's got a crazy lead and a stupid amount of momentum right now. And all the stuff with l two is like arbitrum optimism. I have a takeaway related to just scroll itself that I want to talk about at the end. But I don't know. I did talk to some folks specifically at the hackathon, which was two days before the conference, and I think that they were like, you have 4844 coming soon, which is this good start, not really a complete solution.
00:18:18.874 - 00:18:33.722, Speaker A: There's going to be two markets, is the way I understand it. Now. There's going to be like a block space market and a blob space market. And I think some of these developers specifically that I spoke with are kind of like, man, this is a, this is a complex landscape to, to navigate if you're trying to build here.
00:18:33.738 - 00:19:13.786, Speaker B: Yeah. So I wasn't with the hackathon, but so I can't really comment on that, but, yeah, I mean, it's still certainly solidity, and there's been, you know, tools out there that have made it easier for developers over time to. To start coding and get familiarized with these code bases, like, even integrations like C and all these things like tooling has improved quite a bit, but it's still challenging, right? Yeah, I guess so. I had dinner the first or second night there with some larger funds and a fund of funds, probably one of the largest, if not the largest, in crypto that I've built a big relationship with over the years.
00:19:13.890 - 00:19:16.282, Speaker A: Who can you name? Who are. I don't know.
00:19:16.338 - 00:19:22.546, Speaker B: I'd rather not. But nonetheless, what you need to know, what matters here is LP interest is dead.
00:19:22.690 - 00:19:23.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:24.594 - 00:19:38.760, Speaker B: Like crickets. No new money has been raised. And I think it is in asking him, hey, is it more idiosyncratic? Is it like, just crypto related? And he's like, no, just generally people hurting, you know, it's not, it's not just crypto.
00:19:38.792 - 00:19:38.976, Speaker A: It's.
00:19:39.000 - 00:20:02.404, Speaker B: It's venture, it's hedge funds. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's a very challenging environment. Um, so, Sadi, where do you like, at what point do you think that changes? Of course, then you tell us, start talking about. He asked me, well, what's your view on macro and interest rates? Yeah. No one you know, you know, I don't know. Best guess. So, yeah, I think.
00:20:02.404 - 00:20:48.164, Speaker B: And so I asked him the question, okay, when you go and talk to, like a calpers, like a big pension fund, at one point between now and five years, you ought to believe there will come a time where there's more appetite to go farther on the risk spectrum. Maybe yields come down and then people naturally go and chase yield in farther on the risk spectrum. Given the choice of investing in traditional tech, traditional venture, or crypto venture, where are those dollars on a relative basis going to go? Do you think it's going to be less or more than prior cycles? That was my question to him. I obviously have bias. And the exhibit aid of this question is look at historical returns of venture funds. And they're terrible.
00:20:48.504 - 00:20:51.936, Speaker A: Is this a fund to fund in crypto? A large crypto in crypto.
00:20:52.120 - 00:20:58.824, Speaker B: And also outside they start. They were one of the earliest fund to funds in venture, like, in the nineties.
00:20:58.904 - 00:21:00.224, Speaker A: Oh, I know who they were.
00:21:00.304 - 00:21:31.640, Speaker B: And they were early as well in crypto. So they have a lot of visibility and historical context to answer the question. And so I, you know, when you look at, like, the Cambridge data around vintage returns for venture as an asset class, they're terrible. They've come down a lot. The last vintage funds, like 2007, 2000, 522 eight, or I guess ten year funds. So, like 2010 plus anything that raised after 2010 is super challenged, especially DPi. Like, forget about DPi.
00:21:31.640 - 00:22:17.666, Speaker B: Just like mom is like, terrible. And look, I think catch funds have gone through this as well. Like, there's overwhelming amount of data that, like, mutual funds just put it on an index fund and why pay a hedge fund? 220. I still think crypto is a very nascent asset class, and the return possibility of venture within crypto will be more attractive, purely because it's just a more emerging asset class with more opportunity than traditional venture. And more of the money is going to the larger funds, super large venture funds, I think, still, you know, raise money.
00:22:17.850 - 00:22:18.170, Speaker A: Why?
00:22:18.202 - 00:22:51.858, Speaker B: Because you never get fired putting money with the larger guys, but new managers are really struggling. But, yeah, you know, I think. I think just to wrap up this point, it's no surprise, I guess, but there's no money, no money coming into crypto, who's a marginal buyer. I think you see these retail kind of within crypto movement of funds into the latest fad and trend. But new money coming in is, I think you, you need a probably bigger catalyst around an ETF. Rates come down. Yep, just more of that.
00:22:51.858 - 00:23:41.252, Speaker B: And, you know, I guess the last comment, I don't mean to be negative, as I think about how I invest, I think it's the best time because if you have the money, valuations are low, and this is the time where you invest, if you have conviction and the best builders. Anecdotally, I've had three companies recently shut down. Three of those founders are still in crypto, are building something new. And to me, that's encouraging because smart people are still in the industry, still believe they have learned a lot over the last six years and the craziness of what Defi summer, and they're like, hey, we've learned a lot from this. We shut down, but we're pivoting and we have this better idea and with better execution, with no more people, and that's great. And the valuation is like one 10th of what it was. And I think, you know, I just look at that.
00:23:41.252 - 00:23:43.740, Speaker B: This is. This is the time you ought to just be patient. Right?
00:23:43.812 - 00:23:49.184, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. All right, give me another takeaway. Um.
00:23:50.044 - 00:24:21.082, Speaker B: Well, you stole my thunder around. There is more skepticism within crypto than outside of it. And my point there was like, there's a lot of building happening from legacy players like this JPMorgan, stripes of the world. So I'll just kind of gloss over that. I guess one of the observations, like, I don't have context on permissions. Last year, fortunately, I got rugged by airlines and got stuck in New York. I didn't feel like a bear market conference and it just.
00:24:21.082 - 00:24:23.614, Speaker B: Because I remember what a bear market conference?
00:24:23.994 - 00:24:24.570, Speaker A: Yeah, true.
00:24:24.602 - 00:24:41.584, Speaker B: There was no one. No one there. I went to the first binance conference in Singapore. Kyle was there, I remember. Cause he had a big thesis on BNB. Cain was there. Man, you could have walked on up to CZ and had a normal conversation with him for like 20 minutes and no one would have approached him.
00:24:41.584 - 00:25:17.094, Speaker B: Today's environment, he's like a celebrity of sorts, you know? And so not only on sheer attendance and diversity of crowd, but also on the level of excitement. And we've talked about here that I don't believe there's existential risk now. Now we're discussing what are the use cases of this technology and which type of. Now we're entering that discussion around things are being used and we're being critical of the things that are being used and the implementations of said ideas versus before, it was just. You didn't have anything to hold on to. And so I think it's very different. It didn't feel like a bear market conference to me.
00:25:17.094 - 00:25:43.886, Speaker B: Of course, the sentiment is not raging bullshit, but it's not. Not the bear market that I'm used to seeing, and certainly was not what I saw in 20, I guess, 1920. Those were. Those were difficult. They were both great and very difficult in terms of morale. So, yeah, that was, I guess, a subtle observation. I don't know if you agree with that.
00:25:43.886 - 00:25:45.758, Speaker B: You've been doing conferences for so many years.
00:25:45.846 - 00:25:59.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you know, just because last year was such an insane event for us with permissionless, this one felt a little more like a bear market conference, but still like thousands of attendees. I mean, very different than like 2019. Yeah. I'll give you that.
00:25:59.172 - 00:25:59.340, Speaker B: Right?
00:25:59.372 - 00:25:59.956, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:00.060 - 00:26:06.948, Speaker B: And then I think candidly, the venue didn't help. I think the venue was very big. The venue is too big.
00:26:06.996 - 00:26:12.864, Speaker A: One of the biggest venues in the US. Right. The Austin City convention, like you felt there was.
00:26:13.404 - 00:26:22.098, Speaker B: You didn't see the concentration, right. Where you go to EcC Paris, it is jam packed because the venue is small. And so it's like, it's just sort of a.
00:26:22.226 - 00:26:28.482, Speaker A: And you did not do it. Yeah, I mean, you could walk like ten minutes to get to the culture track. You know, it was a. Did not do us anything.
00:26:28.538 - 00:26:29.778, Speaker B: I mean, it was a stadium.
00:26:29.866 - 00:26:44.734, Speaker A: I do think though, like if you're, if you're looking at like the conversations you had and only basing it off that it was a very like low amount of shilling, highly technical, non party atmosphere, which, um, which is really nice.
00:26:45.034 - 00:27:06.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I know, it's refreshing. Look, every time I've gone to conferences in raging bull market, it's like the scene of the big short. You want to come out of there, you're like short at all. And this why I don't go to conferences anymore. It's quite tempting. Um, but it was great to catch up with, with folks. And, you know, I think a lot of, a lot of the people that you would have thought that are here for the right reasons are still there and still going.
00:27:06.826 - 00:27:41.570, Speaker B: I think there's a certainly like more like people. There's like a. There's gravity, there's like people, people have sobered up a bit and there was a sense of skepticism, for sure. But I think there's, there's optimism more within builders, less with investors and, and so, yeah, you know, I think it's. And even like students, I met a few students from like University of Austin and Law and whatnot and, and it felt like they were, you know, they're still very excited about this. Like young people are still captivated by this and want to learn about it and take the time to go to the conference and you even send their parents. So it's great.
00:27:41.570 - 00:27:55.282, Speaker B: I mean, it's. I think it's, it's. Those are the things that are enduring and to me, signals and leading indicators of kind of where we're going.
00:27:55.378 - 00:28:11.294, Speaker A: Yeah. I have another takeaway that I didn't know at all about before. Permissionless and specifically before the hackathon. I think I actually learned it. Learned a lot. It was our first hackathon we'd ever done. We had 300 developers come and you had protocols like scroll.
00:28:11.294 - 00:28:37.868, Speaker A: It was really interesting. So scroll, zksync, fireblocks, Ernst and young ey. A lot of other great teams basically sponsored it and then they gave bounties. It was really cool to see what people. We have five different teams that the hackathons pulled all nighters built some awesome stuff. Gitcoin sure, there's some others I'm forgetting there. So we talk about basically infrastructure versus consumer apps, and everyone says we're building too much infrastructure, not enough consumer apps.
00:28:37.868 - 00:29:12.736, Speaker A: The other thing that's missing, developer tooling, which I never think about. So in developer tooling, in web two, if you want to deploy a website, you want to deploy, I don't know, a login, a checkout flow, anything like that. Super easy to just basically deploy some components. You can actually just pull up, react, basically pull a dropdown, type in what you're building, social network. It'll almost like auto fill the different components and react for you. None of that exists in crypto. So in web two, when you want to build an app, you can actually almost like auto populate and auto fill a lot of the things.
00:29:12.736 - 00:29:17.360, Speaker A: As an engineer in web three, in crypto, you are starting from zero every single time.
00:29:17.472 - 00:29:22.324, Speaker B: So you can forge something like chat, GPT, help you just code in solidity.
00:29:22.824 - 00:29:44.978, Speaker A: It can, yeah, it can. It's not good enough. So GitHub copilot is getting better. There are couple, there are a couple of tools like that. Like GitHub Copilot is pretty good. I built, if you know the game pong. Like, I don't know how to build, I can like build a website, like little HTML CSS, but like, I can't build something that, like pong.
00:29:44.978 - 00:30:06.870, Speaker A: And I used only chat GBT to build pong. So you can do little things like that. But yeah, these developer tools, these, a lot of the developers were just saying, like, if you could build anything in the world to get more developers to come into the industry, we need better developer tools. So, yeah, it just got me thinking about from an allocate, like from investing, it might be interesting for you, like if you see any good developers.
00:30:06.902 - 00:30:13.674, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there's a decentralized GitHub. What is it? Error.
00:30:14.254 - 00:30:16.190, Speaker A: But nobody needs a decentralized GitHub.
00:30:16.262 - 00:30:25.994, Speaker B: What you need is arguably, I mean, I mean, you could from a kind of like, redundancy standpoint. But what I'm saying here is there's an opportunity to build more tooling for sure. But then.
00:30:27.774 - 00:31:10.884, Speaker A: Vercel raised at, I think, a 2.5 or $3 billion valuation. Everyone's using Vercel, and that's just a better developer tool. You know, we use Vercel. This episode is brought to you by Chronicle Protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data for anyone who listens to empire, a lot, you know, that we talked a lot about, about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle protocol is this novel oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for maker and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, super excited to share here that Chronicles Oracle service is now publicly available for anyone to use compared to using other Oracle services.

You can learn more about Chronicle at chronicle labs.org. That is Chronicle labs.org.
00:31:53.124 - 00:32:36.448, Speaker A: All right, everyone wanted to talk about vouch again, our favorite insurance provider for crypto companies. If you are building in crypto, you have probably come to realize that contracts need insurance. Partners demand insurance. And as a founder myself, trust me when I say you owe it to not only yourself, but your investors and your clients and your customers. And I'm not just talking about any insurance. Their exclusive coverages are tailored specifically for crypto companies that can address issues like protections for regulatory defense, recognizing daos as insured, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities, and even covering the loss of digital assets. They're in it with you whether you're working on l one, l two s, dows, MPC wallet providers, building a protocol, and a lot more.
00:32:36.448 - 00:33:03.856, Speaker A: So whether you're just scribbling your next big idea on a napkin or gearing up for a big fundraiser, maybe thinking about that IPO or an acquisition, don't leave things to chance. Get insured today with 5% off Vouch's exclusive coverage for empire listeners using code Empire. Think about it this way. With Vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind. I have another takeaway. Regulation. Right.
00:33:03.856 - 00:33:06.284, Speaker A: Did you catch Tom Emmer's panel?
00:33:06.784 - 00:33:07.524, Speaker B: No.
00:33:07.944 - 00:33:24.612, Speaker A: Really good. Kristen Smith, Hester Pierce, Brian Quintess and Tom Emmer. It feels like regulation is just like in a tough place in the US. Let me read you some of these quotes. Like Tom Emmer is just for the.
00:33:24.628 - 00:33:27.944, Speaker B: People, by the people, for context. Who's Tom Emmer?
00:33:28.524 - 00:33:37.884, Speaker A: Tom Emmer is the, the whip. Yeah. In the house. Yeah. Majority whip of the, of the house. Yeah.
00:33:38.044 - 00:33:40.144, Speaker B: People saw house of cards. That was.
00:33:40.524 - 00:34:00.034, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think it's from Minnesota. Anyways, great, great guy. And let me just read you some of these quotes. He goes, he goes. As people in the audience, you should be making decisions that are most important to you. Someone asked him about a proposals to stop people from holding crypto in digital assets he goes, that is not an american value.
00:34:00.034 - 00:34:19.288, Speaker A: Someone says, the moderator says, what's it like being a politician? He goes, it sucks. He goes, you don't have to be pro crypto, but you do have to be pro innovation. I don't know. He was saying pretty. It also followed Eric Voorhees. So he was giving these quotes that were kind of like, do not give up. Do not let them.
00:34:19.288 - 00:34:35.164, Speaker A: Do not give up the fight. Do not let them win. And Hester Pierce had this quote, let me just pull it up, said, the government develops its own interests and has started to forget that it represents the people. We need to be ready to go. And the opportunity strikes.
00:34:35.464 - 00:35:02.868, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, look, I mean, this was something that I. It's not specifically tied to the conference itself, but, you know, no surprise I left San Francisco before things really escalated. I started noticing it's like the frog in boiling water. You know, certainly I'm not american. I love America. It's a country that I, where I went to school, I had the most amount of opportunities, you know, working at JPMorgan, getting a scholarship from JP Morgan.
00:35:02.868 - 00:35:24.300, Speaker B: You know, I think it's the best country in the world, still is to have a fair opportunity, that anyone can come there, education and have opportunities. It's not perfect, but relative to other places, like, you have a fairer shot of being successful because the institutions are there, because there's a culture of innovation. Like in places like Japan, you cannot fail. You fail. It is the worst you can do.
00:35:24.332 - 00:35:24.548, Speaker A: You.
00:35:24.596 - 00:36:05.698, Speaker B: It's a disgrace and dishonor to your family and future generations in America. They celebrate success and failure is okay and accepted and all of those combinations, like, I love that, you know, and I have so much respect. And to anyone that disagrees with that, probably has not lived elsewhere and probably hasn't spent enough time in America, in the US. But I will say, though, is I left because I just didn't see where my tax dollars were going. And I think a certain amount of policies were very misguided. I think there's amount of, like, woke culture that is highly destructive in places like San Francisco. This idea of not like, prosecuting, like, petty crimes and shoplifting, I think on the surface may seem not as impactful.
00:36:05.698 - 00:36:35.998, Speaker B: But if you look at, like, how crime was abolished in New York in the eighties, it was. You started with the small things. You started by cleaning up graffiti in the subway. Because if you look at subtle things like that, it's like chaos theories, small things like that can have a profound impact in social perception and you know, all this leads me to say, you know, I went back to Austin. I hadn't been Austin in, like, probably seven years, and I had very fond memories. Like, my first triathlon there, had a bunch of friends. I went to the University of Austin, Texas.
00:36:35.998 - 00:37:07.036, Speaker B: I always felt that Austin was like a high, very pro you, like, a great place where I could consider living. It felt very different this time. It felt eerily like San Francisco in the early days when things started to, like, kind of get out of hand on the homelessness situation, on the shoplifting situation. I don't know. My spidey senses go up because I grew up in Mexico. So, like, I didn't feel. I just felt like there it was a bit, like, it was a bit of a ghost town downtown.
00:37:07.036 - 00:37:20.876, Speaker B: And I asked Kyle, because he lives there, and I said, is this always been the case? Like, no, you know, it's like, it's pretty bumping. Like, restaurants are full and, like. But I just. I walked around and I was just, like, looking around and it felt like things were like. It's not what I'm used to seeing.
00:37:20.980 - 00:37:21.356, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:21.420 - 00:37:35.514, Speaker B: And, you know, I don't want to be too opinionated around, you know, where's the US? Is that a broader representation of the US? And, you know, I. It was just. Yeah, it was. I thought a lot about that. Let's put it that way.
00:37:35.594 - 00:37:36.042, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:36.138 - 00:38:14.194, Speaker B: And it was a big takeaway for me. And it left me wondering, like, what will it take to get back on course, to get back on track? Because as we've talked about extensively in this podcast on the topic of regulation is you have to believe in the three prong system, you have to believe in the courts. And I still very much think that if you look at the interpretation of the court and sort of like the ripple case, the grayscale case, the Coinbase case, like, it's very encouraging to see that. I think, like, democracy in the US is very sound, and these checks and balances are there for a reason, and crypto is an example of them working.
00:38:14.614 - 00:38:15.354, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:16.094 - 00:38:33.570, Speaker B: So that gives me a lot of hope. But I do wonder, like, you, I mean, you still live there. Maybe more of a question to you. Not to get too philosophical in the topic. But I do think about, like, it's not just in America, this has been a problem. Like, nordic countries have also gone backwards. I feel like this is a general, like, historians are probably going to look back at this phase.
00:38:33.570 - 00:39:06.604, Speaker B: It's like, we got a lot of things right. Innovation was like, top like. It was. It was like, a tale of two cities, like innovation is all time high. Like, probably one of the most impactful developments at a technological standpoint across a number of facets, including AI, crypto, biotech, mRNA, vaccines, all of that is hugely impactful. But also, at the same time, society is really, some of our legacy institutions really are failing us. But there's also this apathy amongst the voter base.
00:39:06.604 - 00:39:46.074, Speaker B: And there's also this. You can't really be public and vocal, and if you're a politician, you can't advocate for these things because there's council culture, and so it feels really paralyzed. And so I am really curious, as you think about like, your experience, if you believe that to be a true, and more importantly as a voter, what do you do? Because, like, civil participation is the bedrock of any democracy. If there's apathy or if there's fear, to be vocal about these things. I mean, we're quite vocal as an industry. But I also know privately there's a lot of people that are very. There is fear to be very vocal, fear of repercussion, fear of being canceled, fear of.
00:39:46.074 - 00:39:54.274, Speaker B: I don't know. And so I am curious how you think about all of that. I know it's kind of a very loaded question, maybe less of a takeaway, but yeah, it's just an observation for me.
00:39:56.974 - 00:40:37.384, Speaker A: I'm an eternal optimist, almost to a fault, right? So I'm incredibly optimistic about the United States in general. And I think that the pendulum always swings right. I'm a lover of history and history major, and I know you like history as well. And the pendulum always swings, right. And if you look back at newspaper clippings from basically any decade in us history, it seems like the world could be ending, right? In the sixties, you have all the riots and you start having Vietnam war, and you have multiple world wars between 19, 1950, and oil.
00:40:37.924 - 00:40:43.384, Speaker B: Although I will say there is also this notion that empires fall every 100 years or so.
00:40:44.724 - 00:41:13.608, Speaker A: That was the next one I was going to get to, is that every hundred years there's a new global currency. And that's for the last 600 years going back to what, 1400 or 1500, whether it's Portugal or Britain or the United States or there's a couple in between there that I forget. I think Spain, maybe every hundred years, there's kind of a new global reserve currency, and we are at the end of the hundred years, right? So then it's like, okay, well, what's the other country that could have the global reserve currency? China.
00:41:13.696 - 00:41:14.352, Speaker B: I'm not.
00:41:14.488 - 00:41:40.174, Speaker A: I'm not moving to China. Right. Then it makes you think, okay, global reserve currency aside, well, what's the, what's the better country in the world? Where else would I move? I mean, now if I was retired and, like, not building block works, maybe I moved to, like, Tuscany and the hills of Italy or something. Yeah, it sounds pretty lovely, but I'm trying to build a business and, like, build, build wealth and build a really impactful company. And there's no better place in the world to do that still today than the United States.
00:41:41.194 - 00:42:15.344, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I mean, I don't think. I disagree with that. I think it's just on the margin. You do feel the. You do feel the rate of change? You do quite a bit, yeah. On the way to the airport, I was thinking of, like, what are the things that let me cut you off and stop me from getting off track? But it was like, the question like, that I thought about, and I heard it was like, what are the things that are, like, our future generations? Like, kids and their kids are going to look back and say, God, why were you guys doing that? Like, so stupid? And the first thing that came to mind of me was petrol stations.
00:42:16.084 - 00:42:16.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:16.524 - 00:42:24.382, Speaker B: And downtown, like, how we think about traffic, like streets, the size of streets, traffic itself probably goes away when you're automated.
00:42:24.518 - 00:42:24.838, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:24.886 - 00:42:56.434, Speaker B: A lot of the traffic jams are just human error. And then the rezoning of said downtowns is probably going to change more commercial real estate crisis or whatnot. But, like, rezoning and whatnot, there's so many that I've thought about. I've thought about this question for a long time. Obviously, the natural one is, why don't we have a non sovereign, independent, neutral kind of unit of account and transfer of value that is ethereum or bitcoin, that is outside the purview of central bank policies that affect certain countries. But. But, yeah, it was just something I was thinking on the flight back.
00:42:58.454 - 00:43:00.874, Speaker A: So, I mean, that could be a whole episode, right?
00:43:01.334 - 00:43:04.382, Speaker B: We can save that for another episode we have. But, yeah, drive.
00:43:04.438 - 00:43:17.376, Speaker A: Driving your own car definitely will be one. Right? Shopping at physical stores will be one. The idea of using a smartphone, this big clunky thing, it's going to just be embedded inside of you eating real meat. Unless you're like, hyper wealth.
00:43:17.560 - 00:43:20.924, Speaker B: Do you think we'll still eat meat? But it would just be lab grown.
00:43:21.384 - 00:43:22.992, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I do.
00:43:23.088 - 00:43:24.384, Speaker B: Or it would just be like, no, me.
00:43:24.464 - 00:43:36.584, Speaker A: It'll be lab. Lab grown will replace traditional farming. Right. Separated devices. This idea of having a smartphone, a laptop, a tablet, instead of one single integrated, multi purpose device that is more inside of you than outside of you. Yeah.
00:43:36.664 - 00:43:39.808, Speaker B: Like, you need, like, a paper passport. You know, it's like, come on, guys, like, scam.
00:43:39.896 - 00:43:49.368, Speaker A: I mean, unfortunately, with all this, the privacy as we know it goes away. Well, biometrics, surveillances, analytics, the no no concept of privacy by the year 20.
00:43:49.416 - 00:43:51.044, Speaker B: Now, on the topic of conferences.
00:43:52.784 - 00:43:53.096, Speaker A: Are.
00:43:53.120 - 00:44:00.244, Speaker B: We going to be in a virtual world with Apple's thing and not be going to permissionless in.
00:44:00.864 - 00:44:11.804, Speaker A: Let me pump my own bag for a second. Which is, the more that we move online, the more powerful conferences become. Because the less you see your friends, the less you go to dinners, the less you meet in person.
00:44:11.844 - 00:44:12.996, Speaker B: For you crave more of that.
00:44:13.020 - 00:44:18.260, Speaker A: You can craft once a year, once every six months in person. Right, right. I do agree with that.
00:44:18.372 - 00:44:31.620, Speaker B: I mean, the watch industry went through this kind of prognostication. A lot of people saying it's the death of the luxury watch industry because the Apple Watch does everything more, and then, boom. I mean, it's just gone through a huge, huge renewed interest in vintage watches.
00:44:31.732 - 00:44:55.184, Speaker A: I am extremely bullish as well on luxury physical items, actually. Yeah. If you look at the two richest people in the world, right? Bernard Arnault runs a luxury house, and Elon Musk builds luxury physical items with. With Teslas. I think that. I think people will demand more and more luxury physical items. So not to get too off topic from permissionless humans.
00:44:56.044 - 00:45:04.174, Speaker B: I mean, this. I think this has been a great recap. I don't know if there's anything else. Those were pretty much my takeaways, obviously. You stole two, which is kind of like, meh. So I did my homework, to be fair.
00:45:04.324 - 00:45:18.618, Speaker A: I appreciate you. I appreciate you. No, that's it. Our next event is. So next. Permissionless is going to be in Salt Lake City in October in 2024. We also have a digital asset summit, and I don't think I'm supposed to say where yet.
00:45:18.618 - 00:45:20.322, Speaker A: We're making an announcement this week.
00:45:20.458 - 00:45:22.094, Speaker B: Is it in Europe?
00:45:22.554 - 00:45:23.314, Speaker A: You'll see.
00:45:23.434 - 00:45:28.578, Speaker B: You'll see. I mean, what continent is this in? Antarctica? Come on, give me some breadcrumbs.
00:45:28.626 - 00:45:34.870, Speaker A: I mean, I'll tell it on the pod. It's going to be in London. I'm pretty sure it's supposed. I'm pretty sure we're making a big announcement, and I'm gonna totally.
00:45:34.942 - 00:45:35.766, Speaker B: Okay, okay.
00:45:35.830 - 00:45:36.318, Speaker A: Announcement.
00:45:36.366 - 00:45:44.314, Speaker B: So I'm just saying, I usually. I've been vocal about saying I only gonna go one conference a year, but if it's in London, I'll be here. I had to be a late time in March.
00:45:45.734 - 00:45:48.094, Speaker A: I can't describe to you how mad our marketing teams.
00:45:48.134 - 00:45:58.382, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fine. It's fine. It's fine. You can blame it on me. But, like, listen, like, I hadn't seen, like, someone like Ben from parafat. Like, you know, we spent so much time together, but, like, the last time we saw each other was, like, when I. We were getting started.
00:45:58.382 - 00:46:10.642, Speaker B: We've gotten this office in San Francisco and literally, I went three times to the office and then everyone else is like, how COVID hit. And then we were all remote. And that was the last time I saw Ben. Like three years ago. We went through, like, defi summer and all. And then. And then.
00:46:10.642 - 00:46:11.610, Speaker B: You want to hear something crazy?
00:46:11.642 - 00:46:21.690, Speaker A: That was the first time I've ever met Ben. I've talked to Ben, like every quarter for like three. I mean, you know way better than I do, but, like, love Ben. Talk to him like every quarter for like four years. First time I've ever met him. Yeah.
00:46:21.722 - 00:46:34.162, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, you and I had met in Solana breakpoint for, like, very, very briefly. It was great to spend more time. And this is the first time I saw Ryan Sean Adams. I mean, I think he's just sort of like an elusive character. He just not go to conferences. So it was the first time I saw him.
00:46:34.162 - 00:46:47.694, Speaker B: I love Ryan. It was great. You know, I really enjoyed it. So a very nice event. And most importantly, I just met people that really enjoyed the podcast. And to me, that's the most important thing. That was like a very wholesome experience that people came up to me like, hey, you know, I met your parents.
00:46:47.694 - 00:46:56.894, Speaker B: That was fun. That was great. Right before the panel, you was like, hey, someone wants to meet you. I'm like, I felt like a celebrity. I'm like, hey, who likes my parents? I'm like, oh, great.
00:46:58.114 - 00:46:58.426, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:58.450 - 00:47:11.464, Speaker B: They were on shout out to all the parents that listen to the podcast. I always tell my parents, this is free melatonin. And I've caught my dad listening to my podcast deep in sleep like snow. So I think your parents are better than that.
00:47:11.624 - 00:47:34.080, Speaker A: No, they're loving it. So by the way, last shout out I will give the mvp of the event. Eric Voorhees gave this why we are here opener that got the entire conference on their feet, standing ovation. It's on Twitter on the permissionless account. It's pinned to the top of the permissionless account. It's got 10,000 likes, 5000 retweets, over two and a half million views. So if you haven't seen it, definitely.
