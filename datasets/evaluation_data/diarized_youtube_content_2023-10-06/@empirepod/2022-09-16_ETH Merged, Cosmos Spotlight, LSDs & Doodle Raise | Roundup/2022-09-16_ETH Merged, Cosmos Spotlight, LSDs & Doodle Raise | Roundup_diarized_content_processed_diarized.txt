00:00:04.080 - 00:00:21.358, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show. All right, happy merging. Happy merge, everybody. Welcome to the roundup. We got Santi here. It's Yano Santi.
00:00:21.358 - 00:00:22.934, Speaker A: Welcome. Happy merge, my friend.
00:00:23.014 - 00:00:33.196, Speaker B: Happy merge, everyone. It's a great day for most of us, at least. It's a very, I think it's like a crypto holiday. It will be.
00:00:33.340 - 00:00:44.812, Speaker A: I think it, I think it will be. I think it will be. It happened at two. So the merge happened at 02:43 a.m. Eastern time. That was like morning time, your time. Were you, were you up? Were you having your espresso?
00:00:44.868 - 00:00:47.420, Speaker B: I was, I was just waking up. Yeah, I was tracking it.
00:00:47.492 - 00:00:48.060, Speaker A: Nice.
00:00:48.212 - 00:00:57.618, Speaker B: So it was a great way to start the day. And the fact that it went so, so far very smoothly was just, just really nice to see.
00:00:57.706 - 00:01:00.934, Speaker A: Yeah. What's the, what's the first time you heard about the merge?
00:01:01.234 - 00:01:04.826, Speaker B: Oh, like the word itself, not the.
00:01:04.850 - 00:01:08.250, Speaker A: Word, but like just this idea of moving from proof of work to proof of stake.
00:01:08.402 - 00:02:03.048, Speaker B: Oh, gosh. Well, it's been like since like the super early days, like it's been talked about forever as far as I can remember. We, there's ongoing discussions around talking about scalability, I should say. And also as part of that, we kind of touched on it on the Cosmos episode, which we'll get into it later in this pod, but right around, like, I'd say the first 2015 or 16 or so and back then, maybe a lot of folks remember or not. But like, proof of stake wasn't this. There was a lot of contention criticisms. A lot of people didn't believe the proof of stake was going to even work and were quite like, there was a lot of criticism and ive observed that a lot of people have, maybe its because theres other networks that have launched that, look, Ethereum is not the first network.
00:02:03.048 - 00:02:48.844, Speaker B: Its the first network, I think, that has upgraded, migrated to proof of stake and done this transition, which is really hard. And I think its perhaps one of the more important things of this adaptability of Ethereum and the community and upgrading the same way that you upgrade your operating system. These things, it's pretty hard to coordinate, but there's other networks that went way before them. Right. Cosmos, you got tezos, you have other versions of proof of stake that went before Ethereum. And I think it's been pretty interesting over the years to observe that, I guess call it Lindy of, ok, proof of stake can actually work and it can be a viable consensus engine that can, can work. And proof of work it doesn't like.
00:02:48.844 - 00:03:00.848, Speaker B: It's not to say the proof of work because, you know, for a long time it's like proof of work. Why would you do anything other than proof of work? But anyways. Yeah. Long winded answer, but I think it was right around like 2015 or so. I think.
00:03:00.896 - 00:03:42.988, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we do talk about it in the Cosmos episode that comes out on Monday about like that 24, 2014 presentation from Jay. It's really interesting, but I think, man, I just woke up in such a good mood and was just thinking about how crazy it is that you have these 200,000 person banks that can't even ship like a usable mobile app and we have these ETH core devs that have worked tirelessly and shipped this thing. And I think it's not just a win for crypto and not just a win for ETH, but I think it's a real win for decentralization and for, for just open source software. Honestly.
00:03:43.116 - 00:04:25.918, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think maybe that is the most important thing, really. The fact that, yes, ok, it was delayed. Yes, there was a lot of, I guess people were critical of that. But in many ways we have to think about, as you said, which is centralized organizations, this innovator's dilemma, that it's really hard even for centralized organizations to make radical changes. And the fact that a decentralized organization, certainly not as hierarchical as companies, if you will, was able to do this and pull this off is a pretty remarkable feat. And I think it gives us hope on this idea that we're very early and we don't know if we're designing.
00:04:25.918 - 00:05:03.294, Speaker B: We're probably designing the first versions of a consensus engine. It's hard for me to believe that we're not going to be making other modifications over the next 1020 years. I think this is a really good precedent and case study of it is possible to upgrade, it is possible to modify things, and sure it takes time and coordination, but the fact that we're able to do this in an open source context is even more remarkable. And I think is for me one of the more bullish, one of the more exciting and things about Ethereum is a community that is adaptable. I think if you're adaptable in this open source world where it's very competitive, it sets you up more from. For success.
00:05:03.414 - 00:05:34.392, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I want to start looking at mainstreams, obviously, like all the publications, including I think blockworks had really good coverage of the merge the last couple of weeks, but other publications did a really good job, too. It was very interesting looking at the mainstream publication coverage of the merge. So let me just share my screen and I'll show you this. Anyone watching on YouTube can see this, but I can also just talk through it for folks listening on, like Spotify and Apple. This is CNN's coverage of the merge. The world's second biggest cryptocurrency just got a lot greener.
00:05:34.392 - 00:05:57.016, Speaker A: This is the verge. Ethereum will use less energy now that it's proof of stake. This is Forbes Ethereum merge. Here's what to know about the hotly anticipated upgrade turning the crypto player green. And this is Politico pro green crypto. Ethereum wins applause in Brussels and in Washington. I think this is the most important narrative that crypto has ever seen.
00:05:57.016 - 00:06:21.084, Speaker A: Right. We saw bitcoin get really, really hamstrung and just hit very hard last year by the bitcoin is bad for the environment. And this obviously trickled down into ethereum with like, nfts are bad for the environment. There are a lot of good things about the merge. There's, you know, it turns into a deflationary asset. It becomes yield generating asset. But I think this, like ESG, it satisfies the ESG mandate.
00:06:21.084 - 00:06:39.082, Speaker A: And it's this green. Like, I think we're moving from Ethereum moves from this, like, thing that's bad for the environment again, in the eyes of investors and mainstream media, to something that is like, innovative, clean, new tech. So it was just, I love seeing how mainstream media covered this is very, very interesting.
00:06:39.178 - 00:07:27.464, Speaker B: Absolutely. Not only that, but it comes at a time where there's a lot of attention on rising energy prices and the crunch that the impact that's having. And I think when you look at it from that perspective, I mean, timing is key to construct narratives. And, you know, the fact that it happened in this particular moment of time where natural gas prices are through the roof and we're in this environment where there is a lot of criticism around, even more so around, like proof of work and the wastefulness of the energy, which I don't necessarily agree with, but nonetheless, it is super important from that narrative. Right. The ESG narrative is something that we've talked about a lot about, of how that is a positive setup. People should go and listen to the podcast that we recorded with Travis from ikigai.
00:07:27.464 - 00:08:05.086, Speaker B: This was in May or March of last year, of this year. And I think this is, I agree with you, it's probably the biggest narrative shift and with a lot of momentum behind it. And so timing here is very key that we, there's a very good tweet from Vitalik that quoted, uh, Justin Drake, which is one of the core devs. He says the merge will reduce worldwide energy consumption by 0.2%. Now, I don't necessarily know the basis of that. We can link to it, and, uh, but nonetheless, if you just take that at face value, it is, um. It's pretty interesting.
00:08:05.190 - 00:08:27.878, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. I think there are two other, or another big interesting thing that's worth talking about. And again, I will link, uh, we'll, we'll throw it in the show notes or, I don't know, you can just search for it. But we did an episode with Travis Kling that I think was really good on this. Um, the other big thing outside of the environmental impact tax is this. So if you can see, if you're on YouTube, you can see this. The total ETH supply peaked at 120 million.
00:08:27.878 - 00:09:07.930, Speaker A: Now that the merger is live, ETH is currently deflationary. Over 80 ETH have already been taken out of supply. And this chart just shows it really, really well. Moving from this inflationary to a deflationary asset, really important. And just in general, the supply demand balance of ETH changes dramatically here. So in a proof of stake, excuse me, in a proof of work system, miners spend, like, significant sums of money to run these, like, large, what people would say is energy intensive, compute facilities to secure the chain. For doing that, they're rewarded with tokens, in ETH's case, obviously, ETH tokens, and then they have to sell those tokens to pay their bills and their hardware costs and things like that.
00:09:07.930 - 00:09:29.744, Speaker A: In a proof of stake system, validators stake significant amounts of the base token. So in ETH's case, in Ethereum's case, it's ETH, and then they risk losing them if a bad transaction is validated. So there's really very little cost associated with the staking. So the tokens that are earned from the staking are mostly held. Right. So in proof of work, you have to spend money on hardware and all that stuff. So then you have to sell it.
00:09:29.744 - 00:10:05.634, Speaker A: The token that you get to pay for the hardware costs and staking, you don't really have those costs. So I've seen a lot of estimates on how this shift is going to play out, and I think, as Fred Wilson put this in his blog, is that Ethereum moves from a system that has roughly $20 million a day of structural outflows to a system that has roughly $500,000 a day of structural inflows. Right. So you're going from $20 million a day of structural outflows to half a million dollars a day of structural inflows. And that's a very important supply and demand dynamic shift there.
00:10:06.094 - 00:10:40.034, Speaker B: Absolutely. Two things I want to point out. One, this feels to me like a more balanced and incentive aligned, where all of the stakeholders, or most of the stakeholders that are securing and validating blocks are more aligned with each other. Whereas if you think of a miner, has really high capex and operating costs, and they naturally have to recoup and sell. So there's this constant sell pressure of what is being mined. And that's in proof of work in a proof of stake system. That's not necessarily the case.
00:10:40.034 - 00:11:33.514, Speaker B: That's one component which to me feels like a more viable security mechanism for the long term. And second of all is this idea that as more tokens are being staked, there's this balance, because the staking yield factors into this, of the opportunity costs and what people do. But nonetheless, the more people are staking, float really reduces dramatically. Or, you know, and that has pretty interesting dynamics. Right. If there are not a lot of sellers because they're staking well, combined with the ESG narrative, combined with the ability to perhaps earn a staking yield with a, you know, Cbeth or Ste or what have you, it. It puts a lot of upward pressure, and so it takes an incremental, marginally less amount of demand to increase the price.
00:11:33.514 - 00:12:00.824, Speaker B: This is just standard economic terms. And so it's. Yeah, it'll be pretty interesting. I think what I'm looking at now is what will happen with a lot of the players that try to play the proof of work. Like the proof of work ETH and those forks. And that's going to be an interesting one. The second one is, you know, the stake derivatives, and as these tokens are unlocked, like, what happens there.
00:12:00.824 - 00:12:05.768, Speaker B: And so, anyway, a lot of things to unpack, but yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:12:05.896 - 00:12:38.776, Speaker A: You want to actually talk about liquid staking derivatives. One thing that Garrett brought up that we could talk about, I sent this tweet out about, like, narratives after the merge, and I was like, the six big narratives after the merge are going to be. One is talking about Mev, one is talking about cosmos ecosystem, one is onboarding real world assets, one is new DeFi primitives, and one is protocol specific stable coins. The last one, though, was liquid staking derivatives. And I don't think we have to talk about all the six big narratives here. But you just mentioned liquid staking derivatives. Mika sent out this tweet.
00:12:38.776 - 00:12:56.764, Speaker A: He said, liquid staking derivatives are likely to replace regular ETH as the primary transaction currency in defined nfts. Nothing else post merge is guaranteed to be up only except for LSD. Liquid staking derivatives supply. I'm curious if you agree with Mika there.
00:12:57.114 - 00:13:28.064, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely possible, for sure. Well, look, the derivatives markets are much fat, much, much larger than the notional spot markets, I guess. And so I would think that, yeah, especially as more people, like, if you're holding ETH, there's a big opportunity cost of not staking it. Right. Just being inflated out. And so most people want to stake, but also maybe just do that quickly. The ability to come in and out of that, um, without necessary gates is, is pretty valuable.
00:13:28.064 - 00:13:47.848, Speaker B: And so liquid staking, yeah, likely will have much, much more volume, you know, over time. Not initially, but over time, like, maybe the next five years, there'll be, like, this flipping of, like, the liquid staking derivative volume. Like, far, far is a multiple of what is being transacted on, like, of just ETH and.
00:13:48.016 - 00:14:10.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, what is the. Here, we can, we can pull this up, but what is the yield now on something like Lido? Let's see. It almost just brings up the question of, like, why. Why would you use ETH now instead of steeth or Cbeth or one of the. What's the Coinbase's other thing? Alluvial ETH or something like that? CB.
00:14:10.072 - 00:14:10.816, Speaker B: Isn't that CB?
00:14:10.880 - 00:14:16.640, Speaker A: No, they did. They have two. It's Cbeth. And then they did the partnership with, like, figment and someone else called.
00:14:16.752 - 00:14:17.048, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:17.096 - 00:14:19.436, Speaker A: I think alluvial or something. Something like that. Yeah.
00:14:19.460 - 00:14:21.004, Speaker B: So it's right around 4%.
00:14:21.164 - 00:14:31.444, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's kind of like, why not just use. Why would you use ETH? I mean, obviously, I guess there's the risk. There's. You get four.
00:14:31.484 - 00:14:54.040, Speaker B: Right. There's risk and there's like a bit of, you know, what happens in a deep event and their yield also factors into that based on how many people are staking. Right. And so composability is another. Right. I mean, I think just pure ETH could be accepted, is more widely accepted, at least today, than most staking derivatives and. Or has more favorable, like, borrowing terms or what have you.
00:14:54.040 - 00:14:54.644, Speaker B: So.
00:14:55.824 - 00:15:16.450, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think native staking integrations into these exchanges is going to be. I wasn't, like, realizing how big that was going to be, but I was looking at a Cosmos last night on just Coinbase, actually, you can get 5% yield on your atom tokens on Coinbase just natively, like directly in Coinbase. Really interesting. So, yeah, they are doing that through.
00:15:16.482 - 00:15:18.010, Speaker B: Bison trails, I believe. Right?
00:15:18.122 - 00:15:32.714, Speaker A: I think through bison trails who met. We learn. I learned this. I didn't know this fun fact in the Cosmos episode that comes out on Monday, the Bison trails founders met in that cosmos kind of validator chat in the early days. I think that Google group that they were talking about.
00:15:32.754 - 00:15:34.254, Speaker B: So, yeah.
00:15:35.274 - 00:15:41.306, Speaker A: What'd you think of the Cosmos episode, by the way? Let's do a little. I want to get your take on just like that. Zack. Yeah.
00:15:41.330 - 00:16:07.410, Speaker B: Before we go there, I just want to point out something that's pretty interesting here, which is we've talked about in other episodes, but, like, I think one of the more important metrics to now track, obviously, the issuance and burns, like, just if ETH is being deflationary and what have you, gas continues to be an important one. That does not solve by the merge, by the way. It's just more of like, really kind of solve that. But the other one is, I think, which is, I think of, if you think of the entire defi stack, the analogy to, like, traditional markets is like this 4% number that you're seeing right here on the screen.
00:16:07.442 - 00:16:07.562, Speaker A: This.
00:16:07.578 - 00:16:46.354, Speaker B: This, like, staking yield of the base layer is kind of like the fed funds rate, if you will. This is like the risk free, the bottom kind of standard of this economy. And then everything needs to sort of compensate for incremental risk on top of that. And Defi, anything else that you do, right. Because that's really the opportunity cost. It's like Libor, if you will, or the ten year treasury or, you know, or treasury rates. And so I think that this number is really important because I think everything else moves according to that, right.
00:16:46.354 - 00:17:24.456, Speaker B: Because if you're getting paid less in Defi, which has way more risk than staking your ethan. Well, just, you know, in a rational market, that shouldn't be the case, right? A rational economic being should stake as ETH. Unless, of course, you see upside in like, whatever the governance token or it's not apples to apples, right. Because sometimes you're earning yield on other things, right? Which you may see some upside, but strictly speaking, like, for, like, this is like the benchmark yield that you should be looking at for everything else. So it becomes very, very important.
00:17:24.560 - 00:17:52.234, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. Like, if you think about the traditional economy, you have, you have the fed, you have the yield curve, right? And the yield curve basically shows like how much, if you push out on the yield curve, you're getting higher yield usually, unless it's inverted. You could kind of say like the staking rate here is similar to short term government loans, but we don't have like the equivalent of, in Ethereum maybe yet. I would say like the one year or the two year or the ten year.
00:17:52.274 - 00:17:52.498, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:52.546 - 00:17:53.650, Speaker A: You know, yeah.
00:17:53.802 - 00:18:35.280, Speaker B: Well, I've been thinking, I've been talking to this team that, I mean, the, the landscape of ETH stake liquid staking derivatives right now is very bare bones. Right? It is floating. But you talked about this in another episode. But like, why don't, I think there will come a time where we're going to have fixed rates and very, very more robust markets around that, right. If one player might like, like you're just basically playing like the interest rate swaps and fix and variable. And I think that that is a pretty interesting market opportunity right now because there's going to be a lot of players that are going to want to capture this yield, maybe risk the notional, like the underlying exposure. They want to just bet on the, on the rates.
00:18:35.280 - 00:18:56.248, Speaker B: And I mean, these are huge, huge markets in traditional markets and they will be very big in this proof of stake system, comparing Ethereum with other proof of stake networks. And there's just so much you can do that. You know, I think we're very early in this, but I think Mika is hinting at this. The staking derivatives market is going to be massive.
00:18:56.336 - 00:19:14.364, Speaker A: Theres another podcast from blockworks called Bell Curve, actually, and we just had the episode that came out this week was the fixed rate lending unlock. We had Simon Jones from Volts and Alan Neburg from yield protocol is really good episode. So id recommend folks check that out. Cosmos.
00:19:14.744 - 00:19:15.832, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:19:15.888 - 00:19:17.202, Speaker A: What do you think about the episode?
00:19:17.368 - 00:19:22.710, Speaker B: Well, you, kudos to you for lining it up. We had Saki and Jack.
00:19:22.822 - 00:19:23.582, Speaker A: Yeah, Jack.
00:19:23.718 - 00:19:32.990, Speaker B: Two great guys, long time, long timers in the cosmos ecosystem. I've known psyche for such a long time and it was good to get a refresh. I've admittedly lost a bit of touch on Cosmos.
00:19:33.102 - 00:19:36.446, Speaker A: What's your cosmos story? Can we start there? Like, you saw cosmos in the early.
00:19:36.510 - 00:20:20.022, Speaker B: Days, super early days. I wanted to buy a lot of atoms back in the day and it was hard to, like, I didn't invest like, I guess, in first round, I guess. But I was very encouraged by what I was seeing, like this, like tendermint. And I really liked, there was a lot of people who were coming from Berkeley kind of blockchain group, which has historically been like really good shout out to them. And I was in San Francisco at the time, so I just became part of like this, like discovered it that way and wanted to at some point like invest in tendermin. And that I think was one of the first rounds deals of paradigm did, actually. And this was like right during the bear market.
00:20:20.022 - 00:21:30.262, Speaker B: And yeah, over the years I've been very fascinated by it. I was increasingly very interested by IBC and what that could do to connect other, like kind of like becoming this web of connecting chains and the communication protocol, which is kind of the key, I think, I think is a key value proposition of Cosmos as a network. And so it unfortunately took longer than anticipated and so that I just turned my attention elsewhere and then kind of defi took off and kind of put it in the back of my mind. But I've always sort of felt that Cosmos hasn't gotten enough, I guess, recognition. And most people, I think, would be surprised to learn that, like binance, smart chain, Terra, Facebook, like, there's been a number of like proof of stake systems that have used attendment and forked that code to run successful proof of stake like networks. Now, the collapse of Terra and other components of these networks there are critic, you should like strip away the fact that Terra collapsed with the fact that they were running a pretty successful proof of stake, like a tendermint implementation. So I think, yeah, it was good to have them on.
00:21:30.262 - 00:22:28.270, Speaker B: I think there's a lot of really exciting things happening. Perhaps my biggest takeaway and a question that I asked during the episode was, now that Ethereum is migrating to proof of stake, what does that mean for Cosmos? I was encouraged to hear from them that it's quite positive because now that Ethereum, that is the more dominant network, if you will, other than bitcoin, but the more developer activity is and what have you, it can now connect to Cosmos. And there could be a lot of really interesting connectivity there. It's very refreshing to hear folks like that and I think is representative of the Cosmos community, which is this win win mentality. And yeah, it's going to be really exciting. I think they alluded to it and hinted at it that there are some exciting updates coming out right around Defcon. And so definitely something that I'm paying attention to, but I'm curious to get your thoughts on it.
00:22:28.382 - 00:23:27.084, Speaker A: It got me pretty excited about cosmos, honestly, like, a lot of our research team is very into cosmos and they've been really, I wouldn't say shilling Cosmos to me, but like, just, you know, I tend to lean into the ETH side of things usually. Yeah. And they've just been like, you really should spend more time in cosmos. And so I use this episode almost as, like, an excuse for myself to go pretty deep into reading about it and learning about it more and just getting an update from Cosmos folks, as I did prep for the episode, just to figure out, like, what's been built. And then I will say, like, jack and Zaki, I was really impressed by, by honestly just the story going back to the early days, that conference in Mountain View in 2015, Jay getting Vitalik on board with proof of stake back in, like, 2014, they had the vision for a lot of the things that we now think of as these mainstream crypto ideas, proof of stake, even slashing, liquid staking. These were all ideas that came out of Cosmos in the very early days. So it was impressive there.
00:23:27.084 - 00:24:12.692, Speaker A: And then also just the app chain thesis. I will say I still need to dig deeper into it, but this idea that you can have these sovereign chains, there's no Mev leak, you can customize the consensus model, security runtime, mempool, all of that stuff. It's a really interesting thesis. I do believe that one day we will see a world where something like IBC, I don't even know if I'm technically saying this right, but can live on Ethereum or can talk to Ethereum and all these systems will one day talk to each other in the same way that you can build on AWS or Azure or Google Cloud or Alibaba's cloud service, but they all can really talk to each other. I do think that's the world we one day live in.
00:24:12.788 - 00:24:30.132, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's well said. And I think transitioning a little bit. One of the things that I asked him towards the end of the episode is the fact that they are more of in the less centralized. They don't have a marketing team. They kind of don't care about that. They have really good tooling and devices resources.
00:24:30.132 - 00:25:27.330, Speaker B: I think they place a lot of emphasis from that because it is a very dev centric kind of team. But nonetheless, I mean, I asked them a question. Look, there are other teams, particularly like polygon, for instance, that is crushing the BD game. And do you ever wonder that? Do you ever want to do that? And maybe this was the idea behind tendermint, but then tendermint kind of flopped and it just got disbanded. Or I think that a lot of the team left and so it's like, the tech can be great, but do you wish that you had a really good BD team, sales team? Are we there in that implementation where you build that really good tech and infrastructure? But at some point, I think you need to sell it. And just this week alone, you've seen Starbucks partner with Polygon, which is, I think, a huge testament to the BD resources and success of that team. Ryan Watt, I think, came from YouTube with a big hire, and that makes a big splash.
00:25:27.330 - 00:25:47.522, Speaker B: Anecdotally, I've heard that, like, Solana has developed this kind of rep among enterprises that it has issues with downtime. And I think it is really important because I keep coming back to sometimes the best tech does not win. Like, this is classic. Like, VHS versus Betamax, betamax better tech, mp3 standard. Not the best tech, but it won.
00:25:47.578 - 00:25:47.746, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:47.770 - 00:26:13.854, Speaker B: And so at some point, you need to have sales muscle and bd muscle to kind of go out there and evangelize. And a lot of people are critical because they say, wait a minute, this enterprise interest in crypto, we've seen this. It's all pr stuff. There's no real, real there. But I kind of feel, and I want to get your thoughts on this. I feel like this time it feels more substantial. You have Reddit across different brands.
00:26:13.854 - 00:26:43.144, Speaker B: I think there's real interest in adopting this and leveraging parts of crypto, whether it's nfts, if you're a consumer retail brand or social app or, you know, just. I don't know. I'm like, I do wonder about this kind of idea, of course. Like, does that make you more bullish on, like, more centralized teams, like Solana Avalanche?
00:26:43.184 - 00:26:52.908, Speaker A: You're saying, like, what's the, what's this idea there? The idea that, like, some teams have these, like, strong bd and marketing teams, and then other teams are more just, like, natively growing and.
00:26:52.956 - 00:27:44.284, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I believe in the multi chain thesis. Like, I believe in, like, there won't be a winner take all, maybe a winner take most, but I do believe, like, maybe IBC helps stitch together a lot of these systems in a more secure, fluid, composable way. But, like, that aside, I think we're still very early. I don't think Ethereum has won the race, but, yeah, it's sort of this idea of a lot of people ask me, okay, which are the more exciting? Like, other l one s. It's a constant question that people are interested in whether you're a game and you want to deploy in another l one or an l two or you're a newcomer and you want to understand and maybe go to another ecosystem and we're seeing it's a constant wave, right. Every cycle we have like other competing l one s and maybe competing is the wrong words, just alternative ones.
00:27:44.784 - 00:28:21.142, Speaker A: I think you have to start with the end goal in mind, actually, just like you're building any other company, you have to start with the end goal. So let's look at some of the l one's here. We'll use avalanche, Solana, Polygon, Cosmos or something like that as examples here. So Avalanche's goal, their one liner is to tokenize the world's assets. They need a BD. So what they've done is, I would say they are heavier on the BD and marketing side. But if you look at actually, and you talk to their sales teams and marketing teams, they come from finance, right? Because they want to tokenize a lot of the world's assets and put it on avalanche.
00:28:21.142 - 00:28:26.646, Speaker A: And actually shout out to Avalanche, they had a really interesting deal. They tokenized one of KKR's funds this week.
00:28:26.750 - 00:28:27.334, Speaker B: Oh, there's some.
00:28:27.374 - 00:28:42.340, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I don't know if you saw that. It was pretty interesting. They're healthcare, one of KKR's healthcare funds. And that deal only gets done if you have a very strong bd team that comes from traditional capital markets. So that's like an avalanche strategy. You look at someone like Polygon and I don't actually know.
00:28:42.340 - 00:28:51.788, Speaker A: They're like one line strategy, but it feels like they want to bring on like enterprises, like big companies, like the Disney's of the world and the Starbucks is of the world. So they have a very strong, it.
00:28:51.796 - 00:28:55.348, Speaker B: Feels a lot of gaming entertainment, given Ryan's background at YouTube.
00:28:55.396 - 00:29:11.832, Speaker A: So they have a very strong sales and marketing team as well, similar to avalanche. But like, if you look at who they hire, very different hires. It's not the finance folks, it's the, like, Disney people. It's Ryan from YouTube, things like that. Then you look at Solana. 92% of projects on Solana come from their hackathons. So Solana.
00:29:11.832 - 00:29:39.344, Speaker A: Solana is basically building what I would call like Nick from like crypto natives from like, the ground up. Very grassroots, very grassroots, very focused on the developers. And that's what I would. So, like they have a smaller bd team because they're focused on like crypto natives, I would say. Then there's cosmos, which is like, as crypto native as you can possibly get. They're basically saying, look, someone like Polygon and like, binance smart chain. They use tendermint, but they'll get those big folks.
00:29:39.344 - 00:29:49.596, Speaker A: We're going to focus on. We're going to. We think that the crypto pie is going to grow so much over the years that we're just going to focus on, like, the crypto natives. So I think it just is like different strategies.
00:29:49.740 - 00:29:58.740, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Plus now then you have other newer projects like Aptos and Sui. Sui, is that how you pronounce it?
00:29:58.772 - 00:30:00.084, Speaker A: Sui say?
00:30:01.104 - 00:30:30.232, Speaker B: Yeah, that look, a lot of people raise their eyebrows when they see these massive raises of 150 million, 300 million. But the reality is you're going to, and you talk to these teams and it's like, yeah, we're going to need a lot of these resources to attract developers and build out bd teams. And so it's, it's, you know, it's not a cheap proposition. And so I think in many ways it doesn't hurt to be super well capitalized because it is very, very competing. Um, space out there.
00:30:30.328 - 00:30:52.992, Speaker A: The last bit of cosmos. So you guys should all listen to the cosmos episode when it comes out on Monday. We talked about this presentation that Zack is giving. Um, the one thing to flag is like there's this, uh, one of the pushbacks on Cosmos is that value doesn't accrue to Adam. They are releasing something called Adam 2.0 at the Cosmo verse conference September 26. So you will like, that's the probably thing to keep your eyes on, I would say.
00:30:52.992 - 00:30:56.584, Speaker A: Yeah, there's definitely a bunch of other things that they're launching. So.
00:30:56.664 - 00:31:06.714, Speaker B: And we'll have them on again, uh, for a part two after they released this, which they weren't very, didn't give us much details, but after the 26 we'll have a part two.
00:31:07.814 - 00:31:26.432, Speaker A: Alright, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky.
00:31:26.432 - 00:31:54.630, Speaker A: They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can exit execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet.
00:31:54.630 - 00:32:24.128, Speaker A: It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms. Right now, Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to Avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download Core today using the link in the show notes.
00:32:24.128 - 00:32:43.484, Speaker A: It's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show. I want to give a couple shout outs here. One is to Coinbase, actually. So Coinbase released this thing again.
00:32:43.484 - 00:33:01.180, Speaker A: I'm going to share my screen. If you're on YouTube, you can see this starting today. This is a Brian Armstrong tweet. I don't know if you saw this. Starting today, Coinbase is going to integrate our crypto policy efforts right into the app. This is going to help our 103 million verified users get educated on the crypto positions held by political leaders where they live. So it's really cool.
00:33:01.180 - 00:33:23.838, Speaker A: You can see this, like, this is the tool. Let's see if I can. So I can actually see, like you can click New York, you can say in the House or the Senate. And then I can see these people like, Richie Torres leans positive. If you look at vet Clark, somewhere in the middle, like Patrick Maloney, somewhere in the middle. Carolyn Maloney, very negative. Lee Zalden.
00:33:23.838 - 00:33:41.412, Speaker A: Not enough data to determine. I think this is really. I just love this move by Coinbase. So I just want to give a shout out to Brian and the policy team there. And I think this is a cool move. Yeah, it reminds me of the uber playbook, actually. I don't know if you know what Uber did in the early days when they were getting a bunch of pushback.
00:33:41.412 - 00:33:49.612, Speaker A: They basically built natively inside of the app, a way to. You like click a button and it sends an automated letter somehow to the.
00:33:49.628 - 00:33:54.932, Speaker B: Rep. Yeah, to their support of, like, to the house. Cause they're getting a lot of pressure from like the taxi lobbyists.
00:33:55.028 - 00:34:12.470, Speaker A: Exactly. So I just want to give a shout out to them. And then I also want to give a shout out to the blockworks team. We had digital asset summit this week and it was just. There's an interesting data point in here. We in bear markets, crypto events get hit pretty hard, actually. So we budgeted, like, usually we have two.
00:34:12.470 - 00:34:24.334, Speaker A: Two events, we have permissionless, and then digital asset summit. Digital asset summit is, like, our institutional conference. Um, but, like, buttoned up. I'm convinced it's the only crypto event where people are still wearing suit and ties. We usually get.
00:34:24.374 - 00:34:25.694, Speaker B: I was gonna ask, did you wear a suit?
00:34:25.814 - 00:34:29.994, Speaker A: So interesting. This is the first blockworks event I didn't attend.
00:34:30.983 - 00:34:31.879, Speaker B: Way. Okay.
00:34:31.911 - 00:34:33.519, Speaker A: This is. It was a really surreal feeling.
00:34:33.551 - 00:34:35.759, Speaker B: This cause a significant life event going.
00:34:35.791 - 00:34:47.959, Speaker A: On, or life event coming up next week and locked down. We. It was really crazy. It was like, such a trip. It was the first of. I didn't sell a single sponsorship. I didn't get a single speaker.
00:34:47.959 - 00:35:01.615, Speaker A: I didn't. I never visited the venue. I barely sold any tickets. Like, it was. I was kind of a surreal moment. Like, I woke up and watched the live stream, and I was like, man, we have such a good team around us. I just want to give a shout out to the black works team.
00:35:01.679 - 00:35:02.776, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's great.
00:35:02.880 - 00:35:03.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:03.248 - 00:35:26.736, Speaker B: I've been to one or two of these, or at least have either streamed it or been, and the other, it skews very institutional. I'm curious, the composition of the crowd, the level of interest, some of the major topics that were discussed. I saw the newsletter, which goes into it a bit. It sounds like you had some really good speakers, but, yeah, I'm curious to get any sort of highlights from the.
00:35:26.760 - 00:35:43.702, Speaker A: Conference from you, I would say. So there's a couple. Like, there's a couple things. One is the makeup of the audience. Numbers were really interesting. So, again, like, crypto market. So crypto events get hit really hard, right? Like, if you look back in bear markets.
00:35:43.702 - 00:36:06.024, Speaker A: So if you look back at Coindesk, I'll use the last bear market as an example. Coindesk, their biggest event ever, was consensus in, like, 2018, May of 2018. So there's a. There's like a six month lag on conferences, by the way. So a little peel back the curtain here. It's like if the market peaked out in December of 2017, Coindesk hosted consensus in May of 2018. That was their biggest event ever.
00:36:06.024 - 00:36:36.790, Speaker A: Biggest revenue generating event ever. Then their numbers got decimated, if you look at their 2019 event. So, for us, we were looking at our Das this year, usually we get, like, 800, 900 institutional folks there. So we had budgeted. We're like, we'll probably take, like a 30 or 40% hit, honestly. Maybe we have, like, 600, 700 people or something like that. We had, I think the final number here is like 1300 or 1400 or 1500 attendees.
00:36:36.790 - 00:37:10.594, Speaker A: So biggest Das ever. Most sponsorships, like, most tickets, like, and if, and like, if you look at the crowd, I think we had like seven people from Apollo, twelve people from JP Morgan, big group from Goldman. Every single bank attended. Every single bank sent at least five people. Ton of the big. Like the large institutional players, like the blackrocks and stuff were there, but a lot of the smaller, like, funds who are like the tiger cubs, like the altimeters and like holocenes of the world matrixes, like they were all, they were all there. So it was really interesting to see.
00:37:10.594 - 00:37:39.884, Speaker A: And I think the big conversations were like, the merge was very prominent, regulation was very prominent, because you got to think about what this institutional crowd cares about. So it was the merge, it's regulation, and then it was macro, which was really interesting. So we actually had a lot of the macro folks like Danielle DiMartino booths and Alfonso Picatellos, the kind of macro crowd there on stage with the Robert Leshners and Antonios from DydX. So that was very fascinating. Nice.
00:37:39.924 - 00:37:43.692, Speaker B: Is there a way to listen to these live streams at some point or the live streams?
00:37:43.708 - 00:38:05.232, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to put all the live streams up for free, actually, so you can go to the website and look at. And we have the whole livestream, but then we're actually going to put up videos on our YouTube channel too, so that's awesome. Yeah. So you'll be able to see that. Yeah. A bunch of good talks we had, like Mark Usco, Dan Tapiero and Bill Barheit from Abra give a really good talk. Robert Leshner, I thought gave one of the best talks.
00:38:05.232 - 00:38:33.668, Speaker A: No, he's a good one. Yeah. All right, moving on. Yeah, I want to get your take on this doodles fundraise, actually. So for those who don't know, doodles are a collection of 10,000 nfts, one of the most popular NFT collections out there. They've done a really good job, I would say, of just keeping the hype alive. They had this awesome thing at south by Southwest last year, or maybe it was earlier this year.
00:38:33.668 - 00:38:58.304, Speaker A: Owning a doodle allows you to, like, vote on community driven features, products, events, things like that. Doodles announced on Tuesday that they had raised 54 million in a round led by 776. Alexis Ohanian's firm, ten T Holdings also participated. FTX Ventures also participated. Yeah. So, and this value doodles at $704 million. Now here's where it gets interesting.
00:38:58.304 - 00:39:47.086, Speaker A: This valued the equity of Doodles, the parent company behind the collection, at 704 million. The announcement resulted in like $2 million worth of NFT sales for doodles and the floor price jumped a bit, but not even by that much. It begged the question of like, I think there are a lot of not, I think there were a lot of people in the NFT community that were upset by this saying that these investors should have just bought, just bought the Doodles basically. And then there are other folks saying that's ridiculous. You don't like VC's aren't just going to come in and sweep your floor. So I'm curious like how you, when you see something like this happen, like what do you think is the right way to raise money as an NFT company? Should they have just bought the doodles or should they have done what? Done what? They didn't invest in the equity?
00:39:47.190 - 00:40:48.998, Speaker B: I think the precedent here is uclabs. The thing that you probably need to ask is you're investing in the company, the studio behind these NFTs and they're investing equity into that studio because perhaps they believe they're going to do much, much more with that. I think the structure makes sense in the same way that you would have invested in, I guess, uniswap, I guess Fortnite, you know, or like World of Warcraft. Like if you can invest in the developer, game developer and, or buy a bunch of like in game assets and skins, like I think you want to own the developer part of the developer to have a voice and say and capitalize them to support. Now I think the Doodles team is, as you said, like they gain revenue streams. The studio itself, the developers that started this from secondary sales, I'm unfamiliar with the percentage of fee, but typically that's what, 5% or so, sometimes more. But give or take.
00:40:48.998 - 00:41:12.854, Speaker B: So they're earning that. So yeah, I mean at some point like I think they, I didn't get the pitch but they went to these investors and said hey listen, we're gonna, this is the vision. This is what we want to build and get on board or not. Right. And so I think I don't see that much of a problem with the structure actually. If you're an NFT holder. I also don't see why it would.
00:41:12.854 - 00:41:19.098, Speaker B: There's a lot of criticism other than some folks saying, oh, pump my bags.
00:41:19.186 - 00:41:19.410, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:19.442 - 00:41:59.570, Speaker B: When you try to flood 54 million of NFT sales and you're a doodle holder like whale and of course you want them to buy and sweep it, but it's very short sighted. I think what you. This is much more positive if you own doodles or track the project. You know, you basically now have 54 million to go out and do partnerships with other people and build out whatever it is that they're going to build out. A game, movies, coffee shops, beer, whatever. Like, we've seen everything in NFT land, so I don't have a problem with it. It will be interesting to see where they prioritize that.
00:41:59.570 - 00:42:27.310, Speaker B: Obviously, UCA Labs is an order of magnitude, I think, more capitalized than these guys. But that's. I mean, it's. It's like saying, like disney competes with MGM grants. Like, the entertainment space is vast and massive and where you can take this is, yeah, pretty big. And so we talked about this, actually, Jason, in the episode when, when Yuga Labs raise, we said, how many other teams are gonna do this? And we kind of. I would have thought by this point you would have seen much, much more.
00:42:27.342 - 00:42:32.482, Speaker A: Well, moonbirds. I mean, it's kind of all the tier one ones have done it. It's like. Moonbirds. Yeah. Cool cats. Yeah.
00:42:32.598 - 00:42:39.854, Speaker B: Moonbirds. Doodles. So, yeah. Not surprised. And I don't think white people are really critical of it.
00:42:41.034 - 00:43:01.942, Speaker A: Here's what I think it comes down to. Holders of NFTs think that they bought an investment into a company or something, an asset that would go up. There is an expectation of NFTs that the price of them will go up, that it's an asset. They're not assets. NFTs are not assets in this sense.
00:43:01.998 - 00:43:03.710, Speaker B: Well, they're more collector asset.
00:43:03.742 - 00:43:07.594, Speaker A: They're a collector asset. They're a consumer. Consumer product. They're a consumer.
00:43:07.894 - 00:43:13.702, Speaker B: Guys, if you go buy a Patek Philippe, you can't go knocking their doors and in Switzerland say, hey, guys, I want you to make.
00:43:13.758 - 00:43:15.126, Speaker A: You can be hopeful that it goes up.
00:43:15.190 - 00:43:15.950, Speaker B: The laugh you out of the room.
00:43:15.982 - 00:43:17.006, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:43:17.110 - 00:43:25.548, Speaker B: No, like, thank you for wanting the watch. We love that you love the brand and our collector, but we are the watchmakers, not you. So.
00:43:25.636 - 00:43:39.388, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like the. I think people are forgetting that they are. That you are a customer of a consumer product. You are not an investor into an asset. You're a collector of a consumer product. And a collectible. That collectible can go up.
00:43:39.388 - 00:43:43.476, Speaker A: Hopefully it'll go up. I do think doodle. I do like doodles, but it is not.
00:43:43.620 - 00:43:44.172, Speaker B: I have some.
00:43:44.228 - 00:43:50.876, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not a protocol token, right? It's not. It is. It is a high end consumer product. A high end.
00:43:50.900 - 00:44:41.084, Speaker B: It is a collector. It is like buying a watch or wine or a consumable if you like. This is the thing, folks. I met with a team earlier this week that is building more of a marketplace for nfts and basically allows you to short nfts. And if you have a huge doodle collection, say, and you can deposit it and earn some yield because someone's going to take that and sell it immediately and short it anyways, basically financializing nfts. My question was like, why would anyone do that? Like, I feel pretty attached to my nfts. Like, I like my doodle, not the other guy's doodle, right? But I think, like it goes, it begs the question of like how many people in this market that are buying nfts are just speculating on it versus just collecting? Because I don't know, I think that I'm just a collector.
00:44:41.124 - 00:44:43.572, Speaker A: Oh, this is, no, I, so I.
00:44:43.588 - 00:45:53.146, Speaker B: Invest and there's a big part of what I do, but I don't think of nfts as investments per se. I buy them because I love them aesthetically pleasing and I don't ever plan to sell them. And, and so it's just a different mindset. And I'm curious if you've seen data or what you think around like what percentage of the NFT market today is purely speculative and, or, and just pure collecting? Because I think it does beg the question of like, I think the things that I'm very curious to understand is as prices have come down, the value proposition, the community, the roadmap, where does that go? Right? And look, punks, it's crazy. Like go on the Punks website and look at the prices of these punks in like as early as two years ago. But there's a very die hard community of punks. There's a great, great interview that I retweeted that was done like by signing messages.
00:45:53.146 - 00:46:27.232, Speaker B: Actually, this guy is the number one or the number two largest punk collector holder. He has like, he or she has like 500 punks at some point. Had 704 punks. Yeah, massive collection had sold some like 200, but it's retained a lot. And I think crypto punk holders generally are just built different. They're just, they're just like, oh, like, but some of these early, more recent projects, I do question like, you know, when you see this kind of criticism, it's clear to me that there's just so many people that are just number go up. I want my NFT to go up and someone to buy it.
00:46:27.248 - 00:47:07.524, Speaker A: Like, yeah, I think basically the market is. You asked that question of like, how many people are collectors? What percentage of the market is collectors versus what percentage is people speculating? I think it's a large amount of people are just speculating. But the micro structure of the markets, the things that got built out in like 2017 and 2018 and 2019 for crypto like derivatives and really good OTC desks and all that kind of stuff to be able to trade in size just doesn't exist in nfts. We have, I haven't told you this. Meltem is going to come on the pod. She wrote this great piece. We're going to link it in the show notes called NFT building market microstructure for nfts.
00:47:07.524 - 00:47:29.204, Speaker A: Really, really good piece. I'd recommend people read it. I'll send it to you, too. Santi and Meltom's going to come on to the pod pretty soon to talk about just like the evolution of the NFT markets. And one of the things that is in her post is the ability to short derivatives, all that kind of stuff, the ability to trade in size, the ability to algorithmically trade. This stuff doesn't exist yet, but it's coming.
00:47:29.684 - 00:47:57.434, Speaker B: I made some investments in this. I do question, like what? I'm just curious, like, I do think there's always going to be a subset of people that buy whatever, wine, watches, collectors market are massive. The art market is massive. Not everyone is going to hold on to the Picasso for life at some point. There's a price for everything, I guess, but it just has felt, especially towards the later parts of the cycle, that it was just very speculator heavy.
00:47:59.374 - 00:47:59.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:59.910 - 00:48:33.894, Speaker B: And, and I'm not like, bearish on it. I just think it's a, it's important to observe that. And a lot of, a lot of these buys were done on leverage. And these are the things that I was like my, what my expectations of when the NFT market was going to top or, and I think yours too was, it was terribly wrong. Like the same way that I like, widely underestimated the size of like deposits in DeFi way back in the day just went from like zero to like 100 billion and was crazy to see. But at the same time, yeah, I think NFT markets are going to be massive. There's going to be potential.
00:48:33.894 - 00:49:17.046, Speaker B: And these money markets, financialization of NFTs, I think it will be a thing, but I just got it. You got to call a spade a spade. I think a lot of teams, we should always be critical of teams that just are talking about utility and are talking about roadmap and all this jazz, I think 99% of projects are just not going to deliver on that. Now, if your doodles probably hire like, this is conviction, right? You know, you raise 54 million to build whatever it is that they're going to do. So, I mean, I place more emphasis and be more excited about seeing what comes out of that than a team that, you know, it's just kind of wishing that the floor price goes up and they get more secondary sales. Like, that just feels artificial.
00:49:17.150 - 00:49:41.034, Speaker A: Yeah. I have an acquisition that is non crypto related that I just thought was really interesting. Do you, do you know Figma design? Yeah, yeah, design. So, yeah, yeah. Okay, so Figma basically powers the design of, like, everybody, Adobe XD and stuff, but nobody uses that shit. Adobe just acquired Figma for $20 billion today. Happened, like, right when we were recording this.
00:49:41.034 - 00:50:05.192, Speaker A: I think it might be one of the biggest private software acquisitions ever. Like, gotta be top five. WhatsApp was 16 billion. Intuit was 12 billion. For Mailchimp, I think it was 20 billion, maybe 15. But, yeah, really impressive. So that was just a huge acquisition.
00:50:05.192 - 00:50:10.964, Speaker A: I don't know. Want to call it out? So, anywho, Santi, what else we have to talk about here?
00:50:11.304 - 00:50:44.740, Speaker B: Nothing, really. I mean, there's a few other things here and there. The thing that is, we're recording Thursday, September 15. Today, the chair of the SEC, Gensler, is supposed it will testify before the Senate committee around what the. Around a recommend. He's supposed to recommend a pathway for digital tokens to register as securities. He, of course, has been very vocal around this point that he believes that a lot of token issuers are securities.
00:50:44.740 - 00:51:26.170, Speaker B: And so a lot of the kind of open questions are just, you know, give us a list, give us a more precise way to do that. And. And so he sort of backed off a little bit. From his stance, is my understanding, where he said, look, it's written there in our website, like, it's like a normal issuer. Like, go and read it and abide by that. Whereas now I think he's saying, you know, that it's, quote unquote, it's sort of like, I think his latest remarks softened that tone and perhaps says, hey, this is new tech. The token is different than equity, like stock of Apple, if you will.
00:51:26.170 - 00:51:49.794, Speaker B: And so it will be interesting what comes out of that. So we'll be looking at that. And I think that was one. And second, there was an arrest warrant for Doe. Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for do Kwon, the founder of Terra he's supposed to be in Singapore, which my understanding is doesn't have an extradition treaty with Korea. Nonetheless, will be interesting to see that.
00:51:50.654 - 00:51:54.430, Speaker A: Very interesting. Feel like they're going to try to make a case out of this one.
00:51:54.582 - 00:51:57.902, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Anything else on your mind?
00:51:58.078 - 00:52:04.594, Speaker A: No, not really. I'm feeling good. Like success for the entire industry. Yeah, all is good.
00:52:05.174 - 00:52:06.958, Speaker B: No macro talk. Successful too.
00:52:07.006 - 00:52:09.354, Speaker A: No macro talk. You know, I don't like the macro talk.
00:52:09.824 - 00:52:29.608, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really nice. I want to point out just two book recommend or two book recommendations. Actually, one of them is the beginning of the end. I just started reading it actually earlier today. This is why I was late to the podcast. The end of the world is just the beginning by Peter Zahan.
00:52:29.608 - 00:52:31.128, Speaker B: There's a great YouTube interview.
00:52:31.216 - 00:52:33.560, Speaker A: Oh, Peter is great.
00:52:33.672 - 00:52:50.022, Speaker B: Very refreshing. Take pro us from why the US actually survived this and this. But yeah, really good book. And so I would encourage folks to check it out. The other one, you talk about design, this is more of like a, like a coffee book table. Web design.
00:52:50.118 - 00:52:52.674, Speaker A: Oh, I love that cover. That is awesome.
00:52:53.094 - 00:53:01.546, Speaker B: The evolution of the digital world. Really, actually just fantastic. Like I was, I sometimes buy these.
00:53:01.610 - 00:53:04.018, Speaker A: Are there other pictures? You know, I like those pictures in the book.
00:53:04.066 - 00:53:06.242, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great. It's like a.
00:53:06.338 - 00:53:08.922, Speaker A: What's, what's it called? Web, web designs.
00:53:09.098 - 00:53:44.408, Speaker B: Web design. The evolution of the digital world 1990 to today. It's uh, it's amazing. It's like, I love how the Internet happened. Just chronicles like the evolution of the Internet and just gives us some really good appreciation for the, that historical development to then I think, think about how this new world of Internet 3.0 is going to develop and this one is kind of second to that. It's just really nice to go back in history and look at the first websites and how clunky they were and why it was being used.
00:53:44.408 - 00:54:03.554, Speaker B: And literally like websites that have pictures of cats. And then you think about like, okay, we had cryptokitties and it's really, I think it was, again, cliche Mark Twain history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And so anyways, pretty interesting book. And so it's a fun read.
00:54:03.854 - 00:54:12.834, Speaker A: Nice. Very cool. I'll check it out. Santi, good chat, my friend. Everyone should check out the cosmos app on, on Monday if you're not subscribed to the pod already.
00:54:13.334 - 00:54:18.742, Speaker B: And I guess the Nft music Nft pod with Koopa who just raised a fund.
00:54:18.878 - 00:54:24.782, Speaker A: Koopa Troopa. Yeah. Coop just raised $10 million for music NFT fund we recorded with him. We have a lot of good episodes coming out soon.
00:54:24.918 - 00:54:39.364, Speaker B: Great. Good stuff, sir. Thank you very much. And thanks, everyone, for listening. Hope we didn't bore you or. I keep telling a lot of people that this is like free melatonin, that you can just, uh, go to sleep, but hopefully it's not. And if you want to hear about anything specific, drop us a comment or listening.
00:54:39.784 - 00:54:52.128, Speaker A: Santi, I just gotta say, you. You know, the panda ETH merge meme? I can't stop looking at you and sing a panda. I'm just gonna say, because of your headphones, it's a reverse. You've got the headphones or, like, the panda ears.
00:54:52.256 - 00:55:05.614, Speaker B: What you talking about? I'm a panda. I don't like. I like to think. Okay, I'll take it as a compliment. Pandas, like, sleep a lot. I wish I slept like a panda. I don't.
00:55:05.614 - 00:55:16.954, Speaker B: Thank you, JP Morgan investment banking. I should probably do a class action lawsuit around my circadian rhythm being totally destroyed, but, yeah, anyways, thank you. I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you.
00:55:17.734 - 00:55:18.894, Speaker A: Be well, my friend. Be well.
