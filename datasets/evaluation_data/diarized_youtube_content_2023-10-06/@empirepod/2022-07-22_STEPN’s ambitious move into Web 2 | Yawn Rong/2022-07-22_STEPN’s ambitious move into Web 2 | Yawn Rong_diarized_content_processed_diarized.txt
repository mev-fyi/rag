00:00:04.160 - 00:00:34.480, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about Core later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Super lucky today to be joined by my co host and my friend Santiago, and a very special guest, who I will share in a second. I want to give a little bit of a background here. There are very few companies that break out of crypto and kind of make it into the Normie zeitgeist. Right? And since I've.
00:00:34.480 - 00:01:01.456, Speaker A: Since I've gotten to the industry, I think a couple come to mind. Right? You had cryptokitties in 2017. You had NBA top shots. You had axie infinity, and most recently, you had a company called Stepn. Stepn is a crypto web3 app that pays users for one thing that most of us do, hopefully every day, which is moving around and walking around. Uh, Stepn really created the move to earn, or move and earn category. They finished fourth out of over 500 projects at the Solana ignition hackathon in 2021.
00:01:01.456 - 00:01:13.844, Speaker A: Uh, and just had absolute rocket ship growth. Just six months after launch. Stepn managed to achieve a peak of. Yan. Yan might have to correct me on these, uh, these numbers, but 400,000 daily active users, I think.
00:01:14.464 - 00:01:19.980, Speaker B: Uh, yes. Uh, we hit about 400,000 after the launch pad, after the launchpad.
00:01:20.012 - 00:01:48.008, Speaker A: So 400,000 daily active users. The number I have for monthly active users is 1.7 million. They were one of the most downloaded apps in the fitness section of the App Store. Just amazing growth in six months. Today, though, I think the big question on everyone's mind is, can stepn sustain the momentum through the bear market, or will they get hit pretty hard like some other play to earn brands did in the last twelve months? There is no better person to discuss that. Big question that's on everyone's mind.
00:01:48.008 - 00:01:57.320, Speaker A: Plus, like, the longer term vision of Stepan than their co founder, Yan Rong. Jan, we are super excited to have you on Empire. Welcome to the show, my friend Sankil.
00:01:57.352 - 00:01:58.136, Speaker B: It's my pleasure.
00:01:58.240 - 00:02:27.994, Speaker A: Yeah, this episode is supposed to be about Stepin almost turned into a Harry Potter episode. Jan told us that he completed a 60,000 piece Hogwarts collection, which is honestly more impressive than Stepn. That is a feat in and of itself. But Yan, we were very excited. I think we have to give a quick disclaimer. Santiago is both a Harry Potter fan, so you got him on that note, but also a seed investor in Stepn. I just wanted to give a quick disclaimer there, Jan, I think it'd be helpful if you could just.
00:02:27.994 - 00:02:51.012, Speaker A: We're recording this early July 2022. You guys had absolutely massive growth over the last six, seven, eight months. And now obviously not just maybe the step in price is down, but the entire market has taken a massive turn. So I think it'd be helpful to get your framework on like a, just like where you're seeing the market today, but also how this relates to Stepn and then we can use that as a jumping off point.
00:02:51.148 - 00:03:27.052, Speaker B: Sure. So yeah, definitely we're in the sort of recession as we see is two consecutive quarters of the US GDP went to negative. So obviously that basically also affect the crypto market, the whole financial market. So definitely in the beer market. And as we can see, everything pretty much went down 80% each. And so we soon discovered the beer market and we started to pivot. So we can talk about that later.
00:03:27.052 - 00:04:11.374, Speaker B: But we are moving now fast to shift our attention from the web3 to web two and trying to capture really the price insensitive crowd that in the renting community and basically from just everyday use on the working trackers or render trackers. So we were starting to see changes well made in the next couple of months. Plus we also. So we pivot two ways. One, we pivot horizontally and one, pivot vertically. So we also pivot away and starting to build a much bigger ecosystem where the move to earn. Often people ask where the earn come from.
00:04:11.374 - 00:04:59.534, Speaker B: So, meaning that we have to build something much bigger than the second app and then to support the earning bit, which again, we can talk about that later. So, yeah, so we are now trying to take this time in the bear market and build a series of flywheels and also web two product and to constant expand the product and brand awareness and recognitions and then to bring people through Stepn. So we always see Stepn as a user like web3 onboarding tools, rather than typically like a Gamefi project where we're trying to get the web two user onboarding with Stepn and then move them to, let's say the DaX we built, the empty marketplace we built. And also down the track, the social app we built.
00:05:00.314 - 00:05:30.046, Speaker A: There's a stat I saw you on that was really impressive, which is one third of stepn users had never actually had a crypto wallet before, which is just an amazing stat. So Stepn alone got hundreds of thousands of people to open a crypto wallet for the first time. It'd be interesting to hear your take on like what is Stepn today? People think of it as the app that you download. You get money when you walk around. It's like move to earn verse. What does Stepn look like maybe 18 months from now or 36 months from now? Today's vision or today's product first, maybe the future vision.
00:05:30.190 - 00:06:19.498, Speaker B: Yes. So stepn now as an individual app is really trying to promote a healthier mind and body and lifestyles and to motivate people to achieve that type of routine, let's say a little bit exercise. Every day we do token incentives, and that will also come in two stages. One, stage one, basically token incentives of the GST. And then stage two will be the token incentive of the GMT. Let's say 18 months from now, I will say we don't need 18 months. Let's say six months from now, we will be able to expand with a complete functional of the DeX and a complete functional of NFT marketplace with a launchpad, which the third party NFT could launch through us.
00:06:19.498 - 00:07:17.822, Speaker B: And we are also branching into a clothing brand. So building our own clothing brand appeals and also building our own beverages. So as you can see that we're trying to tap into the everyday items the web, two people, or normal people, normies use and really just have the brand in front of them. So people drink waters every day. So we're going to have a water brand and wear clothes every day. We're going to have our logo on the clothings. So in a way that we actually reverse integration from the web3, back to the traditional business and use the traditional item, you know, just physical items, sneakers, clothings, food, drinks, and to reverse integrate and have the brand in front of them and in a way that let's even 1% of them say, oh, what is that? And then find out, oh, actually this is a Webster app.
00:07:17.822 - 00:07:24.854, Speaker B: And to actually onboarding them in a massive scale and effective as well.
00:07:25.014 - 00:08:05.938, Speaker A: It's really interesting. I mean, when you talk about it like that, you're building this behemoth of really a sports company which looks maybe something like a Disney meets Nike. When you explain it like that, I think before getting into the Dex, the NFT marketplace, the clothing, the Red Bull sponsorships that you guys maybe plan to do, I think it's important to talk about just how it actually works right now for a couple of minutes. So there are two important things, I think here, or maybe three important things. A, how do people make money? B, there are two different tokens, right? There's GST and GMT, and there are two different wallets. So maybe if you could just give an explainer, maybe tying the three of those together. GST and GMT, two different wallets.
00:08:05.938 - 00:08:12.538, Speaker A: How do people make money? At its surface, it feels like very confusing, but I think when I've heard you lay it out, it actually makes a lot of sense.
00:08:12.666 - 00:08:55.264, Speaker B: Sure. So in this current phase of phase, actually now it's phase four. But in the current phase, people can only earn the GST, which is an infinite supply token, and basically implement many of the token burning mechanics. For example, that people have to repair the sneakers every day, and people can receive a mystery box and open the box. They have to spend a lot of GST. And especially that when it comes to sneaker minting, you also need to GST. We build a whole range of token burning mechanics, which basically to improve on the x infinity, where, except breeding the game token doesn't have much of use.
00:08:55.264 - 00:09:39.104, Speaker B: And we're trying to build a range of use cases where people are more likely to use it. Like for example, that we created gem system where there's ten different levels and people can then just upgrade the gems by burning the GST. And then the gems will enable them to have a better sneaker down the track and then basically earn more token or be prepared for, let's say, GMT earnings. So that is to do with the GST. But again, it doesn't have a cap, meaning that people keep creating the GST and, well, creating an inflationary pressure. And that's the reason that we'll have the GMT earning to counterbalance the GST.
00:09:39.404 - 00:10:01.904, Speaker A: Got it? Okay, so let me just almost repeat this back to you to make sure I fully understand the model. So to start, you download the stepn app, you sign up for stepn, you need a verification code. I think at one point you guys were giving out 1000 a day. I'm not sure if that's still the model. You create a new wallet, right? A crypto wallet. So it generates a twelve word secret phrase. You transfer some solana into your in app wallet.
00:10:01.904 - 00:10:27.976, Speaker A: You then head over to the in app marketplace, you pick up a sneaker and you basically purchase a sneaker. Once you have the sneaker, you can start earning and different. I think different sneakers have different traits, if I remember correctly. You've got the energy and you basically have different levels, right? So if you have like, I think one sneaker, you're a newbie. Three sneakers, you're a daily user. Nine sneakers, you're like a savvy user. The more sneakers you have, the more capital that you can actually earn.
00:10:27.976 - 00:11:12.390, Speaker A: In terms of the token model, there are basically two different tokens. So you have GST, which has an infinite supply, and then you have the GMT, which I think there's a supply of like 6 billion, if I remember correctly. And this kind of dual token model is something that we saw. Axie Infinity really made this dual token system pretty popular, right? Made it popular. I think it's pretty useful model for like x to earn, like play to earn or move to earn applications where you have one token that's designed to be this highly inflationary reward token that kind of bears the brunt of the selling pressure from users cashing out the rewards. That's the GST. And then the other accrues the value that's created by users transactions inside the app.
00:11:12.390 - 00:11:14.994, Speaker A: That's GMT. Do I understand that correctly?
00:11:16.344 - 00:11:27.256, Speaker B: Yes, but the GMT also will serve a multiple layer of purposes, and we only just released one layer, which would be the in game utility functions.
00:11:27.400 - 00:11:56.734, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, so once you get the GMT, is this going to be more of a model? Like, do you predict that users will do a model kind of like sweatcoin? Right? Sweatcoin is a huge web to almost like a move to earn, where they get, it's not cryptocurrencies. They get just like tokens. And then they can use the tokens to buy in app things on like Amazon or Nike or whatever it may be. Do you predict that it's in app purchases? Do you predict that they'll sell and they'll buy bitcoin or ethereum? What do you think this looks like?
00:11:57.994 - 00:12:12.554, Speaker B: So really we want the GS and GMT to be circulating within our own ecosystem, meaning that not only within stipend, but with other things we create, especially with the GMT, which will come in handy where we have other, uh, product being built.
00:12:12.594 - 00:12:12.746, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:12.770 - 00:12:16.498, Speaker B: So if you stake in GMT, you can get different perks on the NFT marketplace, for example.
00:12:16.626 - 00:12:38.244, Speaker A: Got it. Let's talk about the big question at hand here as we, you know, we're maybe seven or eight months into this bear market. Let's talk about how stepn avoids the same fate as axie. Right? What, what learnings did you have? Just watching the meteoric rise and then kind of fall of axie, what learnings did you have? And then maybe why step in different from axie here?
00:12:39.504 - 00:13:28.184, Speaker B: I think the one thing that I think differentiate us is people eventually so maintain a healthier lifestyle is, I think majority is what people want to do. So they want to develop that routines, but they always lack that level of motivation. So with video game playing, that's different. So video game playing, okay, this great game that is really addictive, and then keep playing, and if that pays you money, that's awesome. But eventually, you get a little bit tired of playing these type of video games, and you say, all right, that's it. I move on to the next one. But what we're trying to offer is something that will benefit people.
00:13:28.184 - 00:14:25.356, Speaker B: One, if you keep walking outside or running outside, you get more energy, literally more energy and losing weight, you'll feel better. And we also have seen a lot of users do have smoking issues, diabetes, depressions, and they find their condition being alleviated because they've been exercised regularly, and they can see the benefit doesn't really come from the earnings, but also come from the. The visible improvement on people's health. So I think that's the key point that is differentiate us. So even though everything in this bear market price went down, I still go out and work an hour and 40 minutes every day. And once that built into your routines, it becomes difficult to change. And then you just keep going.
00:14:25.356 - 00:14:33.860, Speaker B: And eventually you discover that, okay, I lose that love handle, I get more energies, and you feel better.
00:14:34.012 - 00:15:25.826, Speaker C: I think, look, yon, I don't disagree with any of that. I mean, when I first met you guys, there are two, obviously, I feel really passionately about healthcare. And one of the things that is wrong in the healthcare system is that it's very reactive. So you then think, okay, there are incentives that we focused on in crypto. How can we apply those to nudge certain outcomes and motivate people to do something? I was a longtime user with Strava, and when I discovered crypto, I was like, wait, why doesn't Strava have a token? The argument that I've heard from a lot of folks when I tell them about Stepn is they say, wait a minute. Well, obviously, this is a Ponzi, because a lot of other people, you know, you're buying the sneaker from another person, right? And that sneaker roughly costs x, which is comparable to an actual sneaker, like it was at one point, like $130. It's priced in sole, I think.
00:15:25.826 - 00:15:49.874, Speaker C: And so how do you respond to someone that says, the current installed base? The current user base is very motivated to use the app, but is dependent on other users coming and buying their sneakers. And when people hear that, they sort of say, wait a minute, that's a ponzi. And I'm sure this is not the first time you've heard this, but what would be your response to someone like that?
00:15:50.494 - 00:17:21.683, Speaker B: So I think if one word has been overused in the cryptocurrency industry is a pounzi word. And you could be very well argued that everything is pounzi, but we're not going to go down that path today. And so with Stepn, when people are creating tokens and we're trying to create a use cases for that token, and there will be people willing to pay to buy the token, and then for, let's say, minting sneakers, yes, you create new sneakers through tokens which somebody sold to you. That token has a value, or for more of the intrinsic reasons, they say, all right, I want to improve this sneaker because the sneaker is my social identity. And this is what we see from a lot of the community gatherings that people say, oh, what stinker you got have this like a genesis, or have this as a special sneaker so it become part of your social identity and then say, all right, this sneaker has more values than a production, production tool, right? To produce tokens, you feel attached and you know, if you sell it, you feel the sneaker, you sell part of your identity. So definitely that we are saying something with pounzi, meaning that you create zero value, right? You simply move somebody's money. The newcomers money you pay, the people come before you.
00:17:21.683 - 00:17:55.288, Speaker B: Really the counter argument for the Pounzi acquisition is, have we create values? Have we create values? So I think we do one. We create a community where we are hosting a lot of live event. We have people showing up, you know, hundreds of them attending live event. Just nice social gatherings. People talk to each other, they do a lab or five laps of running walkings, and then they go out and have a good time. Either it's a picnic or it's going to a pub, have a drink. So there are social value being created.
00:17:55.288 - 00:18:36.194, Speaker B: Definitely. And the social fire is also the past that we also discovering down the track. And also people do need to buy this. NFT, sorry to buy GST or the tokens of the exchange or of the swap and do things. Today I bought $500 worth of GST just to try and upgrade my sneakers. When that creates a value for people to move around and get healthier and then to create value and demand for the tokens. And on top of that, create social value of gathering.
00:18:36.194 - 00:18:46.118, Speaker B: I don't think that fall into the category of pounds because value being created, right? Value being exchanged and the exchange is at a fair value, price goes down.
00:18:46.166 - 00:18:46.374, Speaker A: Why?
00:18:46.414 - 00:18:59.114, Speaker B: Because there's less demand than supply, but it doesn't mean it's a pounzi because it's been created again, connections being created, better being created.
00:18:59.234 - 00:19:27.474, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you. I actually don't love the term Ponzi. I would say what happened with Axie is basically a multi step process where investors bought the NFT assets. Investors then hired scholars to play the game using those NFTs. Scholars made money in the form of a native crypto token. Investors and scholars then started dumping the token on new investors. And that cycle kind of repeated, and I think, Ponzi, I agree with you, I don't love that word here.
00:19:27.474 - 00:19:41.606, Speaker A: But that model with Axie required new investors to keep joining the game to provide exit liquidity for the current investors. So kind of everyone was happy as long as the new money flows in. It sounds like you would push back that that's not the model with Stepn.
00:19:41.750 - 00:20:34.170, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the key point is that people are still using the app and the motivation for them to use in that could be different. Somebody said, I want to make returns, and some say I just want to keep fit. But I think the value creation part is the key, important part where, let's say, if less people are playing Stepn, and we have seen the sneaker has become a deflationary supply now because we have released the enhancement which you burn five sneakers and get a better quality one. So 100,000 sneakers been burned. So they will be going through cycles. Doesn't matter is the sneaker price or the token price, but we are falling an economic trend or cycles.
00:20:34.170 - 00:20:42.130, Speaker B: And you can't cope things when it's dropped pouncy or up pouncy, you become overly irresponsible.
00:20:42.242 - 00:20:59.700, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Who do you think of as you start to build out the app and all these experiences? Who do you think of as your biggest competitors here? Is it the straw like Santiago mentioned, Strava, Nike, sweatcoin? Is that the group, those are your main competitors.
00:20:59.892 - 00:22:38.874, Speaker B: I think we were able to grow this fast was really because there wasn't much of a competition going around, because I think we were lucky that we in this very sweet spot where we are on the mobile end, so we don't need to compete with all the gamefights and also with Swagcoin, with a whole bunch of other moves and to earn sort of project out there, I think we add, I think we make a good balance between the game and financials part. I think with sweatcoin it becomes a little bit boring. After using it for a bit, it doesn't really offer any interactions. I think that's the part also interaction with the app and the user and also between user among users. What we try to facilitate is more on the offline event and that's where we more like Strava to facilitate the face to face interactions, to build the social connections. But again, Strava doesn't have that earn bit working bit. So we actually try to piece all these together and create something that more attractive than the traditional sort of in this old category called free earning apps.
00:22:38.874 - 00:22:44.342, Speaker B: That's where it belonged before this x to earn become really popular.
00:22:44.518 - 00:23:14.924, Speaker C: I want to maybe talk a little bit about your BD plans. You've done some collaborations which I think are pretty interesting sneaker brands, but also with crypto native communities like bored apes. So the ELP realm is pretty interesting. I'm curious if you can talk a little bit about that. How does that enhance the value within stepn? And what are other kind of future like? Where do you see these collaborations going in the future?
00:23:15.544 - 00:24:12.630, Speaker B: With the ape realm, we basically airdropped. So this is where we draw the learnings from the. We create this realm system where we basically open identical games on different blockchain or on the same blockchain with a different theme that enable us to give a reset and also to attract users that wasn't able to attract before. And for that particular reason we draw learning on the BNB chain, which was not enough sneaker at the first. In the beginning it's only a couple thousand pairs. So this time we dropped to all the bored ape holders and also all the JC sneaker holders, plus a whole bunch of raffles and also drawings in and out of the app. So I think we are, because each blockchain.
00:24:12.630 - 00:25:12.788, Speaker B: So with Solana, with BNB chain and now on the Ethereum chain, if we are not on that chain, we cannot tag into that chain's core users, only that when we extend to ethereums, we'll be able to tap into a lot of the blue chip NFT holders. Then we'll be able to grow our ecosystem bigger, basically to influence them, and then to have them to refer to their friend, and so on, so forth, basically to expand the ecosystem. And that's sort of the one of the main objective for us to build newer realms and to grow and to increase our sort of brand awareness and eventually again to break into the web tool and get more users down the track.
00:25:12.916 - 00:25:54.564, Speaker C: Speaking of users, I want to take a moment here to just talk about a couple of stats that are pretty interesting. On your website you show these live, which is pretty great. To date there have been close to 70 million mile that have been logged by users. That translates to roughly 4.3 billion calories burned and some carbon offset attached to that. One of the things that when I was talking to you guys was sort of the scalability problems that you were facing when Solana and then you had to go to another chain. How does you know, you guys have gotten some very early success with a phased rollout because there were so many people that were picking me for codes and I said, guys, I only have so many codes.
00:25:54.564 - 00:26:17.064, Speaker C: You have released a very methodical kind of way of every day. I think in your discord you release certain codes. I think it's a thousand. And then that allows the next set of users to join. How do you think about scaling this to potentially billions of users? Is that possible with the current infrastructure and how do we get there?
00:26:17.844 - 00:27:34.154, Speaker B: I think it's possible because I think a couple months ago we have upgraded the server basically to be able to accommodate not biddings, but at least tens of millions easily every day, basically. So basically we'll do future server upgrade once we see needed. And again, we believe that with user we really cannot grow too fast. And if you go too fast it creates a lot of issues because NFT have been produced by users. And if user growth is faster than the NFT being produced, you can see that the price went up to the sky and then that cause issues. So we want to really pace it out to have a set number of users to join every day and just to smoothly increase our users without impacting too much on the NFT and token prices. So as we again step into the beer market and we actually are trying to again move our focus on more of a traditional method of, of growing.
00:27:34.154 - 00:28:18.192, Speaker B: And the activation code or invite code I think is one of the key, I think key reason that we be able to scale. I always try to use the sort of the COVID metaphor. COVID basically is that you affect close contact friends and families. And with Stefan we also trying to do that. Basically you use it, you feel that it's a great app and you want to introduce to your friends families. And with your activation code, when you have that code, they always know who to ask question from and that create that social bound.
00:28:18.368 - 00:28:36.932, Speaker A: All right, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky.
00:28:36.932 - 00:29:05.150, Speaker A: They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives Avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem system. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet.
00:29:05.150 - 00:29:36.134, Speaker A: It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn, yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now. Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes, it's really, really nice.
00:29:36.134 - 00:29:45.524, Speaker A: If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using link below. Now let's get back to the show.
00:29:46.904 - 00:31:05.224, Speaker C: So certainly we've seen in a game like Axie, there is a very big subset of earners that go away when it's no longer lucrative for them to play and earn. In this case, look, we all walk, but how many? The question is perhaps more on that habitual part, which is how many of your users do you think will stop logging and using stepn if the price kind of collapses? And do you think that, are you focused on that? Or do you think that users will naturally just say, look, I'm going to use stepn the same way that I use Strava, but I just have. Maybe it's just a very marginal incentive and nudge because you're earning something which could be a token, but could also just be you're attached emotionally to your sneakers and you want to, you know, that sort of badge of honor. The same with the go. People go do iron man's and have medals to show for in their walls, you know, when people go to their houses, you know. So I'm curious how you think about that relationship of the different kind of users that are coming to step in now. Because, you know, at the very beginning people would be walking to lunch and they would pay for the lunch with earned tokens.
00:31:05.224 - 00:31:21.624, Speaker C: I don't think you and I and all of us three here can agree that that's sustainable. But the question is, are people going to keep using and be motivated enough to come to step in and set up an onboard if they know that they can't make as much money?
00:31:21.964 - 00:31:54.262, Speaker B: Okay, so it's 2.1 is all in the executions. And because we were so we've seen that we have surge of inflation of the sneakers, basically too much sneaker being produced. And then we soon have the solutions basically to do the enhancement, basically burn five, you have higher quality, a better quality, basically. And we can suddenly see that huge amount of token being burned. Sorry, sneaker being burned. And now we are looking at the deflationary supply of the sneakers.
00:31:54.262 - 00:32:48.314, Speaker B: And yes, people do walk away and because I bought the sneaker price too high, right. And I don't feel that I'm going to make my money back. And they walk away. And this is normal. But when people looking at sneaker now, the RoI is pretty much, pretty consistent where because always the new entry will see, okay, they will be able to make their ROI in two months of time. And when they can sustain that and they will basically motivate it. And when people are bought at the top, unfortunately, we've seen that people say, oh, just keep walking because why not? And we do see people walk away.
00:32:48.314 - 00:33:14.374, Speaker B: But the point I want to make is that I want people to see this as a long term project because once the GMT earning has been enabled, so the thing will starting to change because it is the GSE, that single side selling pressure on the JC causing the issues. Once we have the other side, things will be much improved.
00:33:15.054 - 00:33:39.950, Speaker C: I want to ask a very basic question before we keep going down this path, which is, it was a question that I asked you at the very beginning when we first met, which is, wait a minute, how does someone not game this? You know, and I think you mentioned something about the accelerometer in the phone. But my first question was. My first initial reaction was, okay, somehow, somewhere, someone's gonna find a way to pretend like they're walking and then just make a ton of money.
00:33:39.982 - 00:33:41.462, Speaker A: Put it on a treadmill. Put your phone on the treadmill.
00:33:41.478 - 00:34:00.234, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah. We've all seen the meme of like this guy with like 100 phones, right? And like pretending to walk. How do you, from a technical standpoint, can you just explain to listeners, like how you can you actually detect when someone is walk like faking it and can you fake it?
00:34:00.734 - 00:34:57.114, Speaker B: We are at the rollout of the first generation of the smack, which is the stamping anti cheating mechanics. And we have the first generation came out one month after we made the public beta. And then we spent this months of time to build a much better and complicated algorithm to pick the cheating. There are different ways of cheat. There's one way is basically you pack a full bag of mobile and then you run at once. Then you earn nine times of what you're supposed to earn. And the other type of cheating is basically what we see very common at the moment when you do the replay attack is that you run, you record one section of your actual running and then you keep replaying that and trying to game the system.
00:34:57.114 - 00:36:22.480, Speaker B: So it is difficult because with the artificial intelligence you need a huge amount of dataset in order to say, okay, to distinguish between the cheating with the normal runnings. And we have changed many, many, many ways basically to try to optimize that without interfering people's user experience. Because I think with the third AI we roll out, it will verify every run and then that causes massive issues. Now we are using a more of a background mode basically to not really actively detect users. But if we detect they are being abnormal users, then we will have an internal code turing score reduction and then they won't be able to do any in app interactions after that. Then they have to run normally to restore their training score. So we are using several algorithms based on the machine learning to basically detect if this is the actual person running.
00:36:22.480 - 00:37:16.764, Speaker B: So we now are very good at it because before, without a lot of data set, sometimes you have people argue, say, all right, I'm actually running while detecting me as a bot. And now we can very confident say, if we detect you as a bot, you're a bot. And we actually can prove it. And the next range, so we keep. So basically there's no stop on improving the technology. And to give you another example is that I think on the second generation we built, we can only detect if you carry say four or five phones. And as we're gathering the AI become more smarter, we can now narrow down to three, two and one.
00:37:16.764 - 00:38:11.064, Speaker B: So basically we are trying to tighten up now with the newer algorithm. So that's the current stage. And then moving forward, we also trying to implement what we call edge computations. So that's another way that we try to have the anti cheating done locally at users mobile, meaning that we don't need to collect their GPS data and meaning that with a lot of the privacy issues with the GPS data, there will be none. So there's always that we're trying to. Anti cheating is always like the biggest topic when we come to our dev talk. So we have a whole team basically looking after on the AI side.
00:38:11.064 - 00:39:02.076, Speaker B: So not only collecting the geometers, also the GPS, and also the steps of the step counter. And then we basically run the algorithm and say, all right, are they mobile at the right place? You know, they cannot be like 3 meters high from the ground, you know, these type of things. And what kind of, you know, many of the patent people trying to tweak, especially the replay attack, is when they think they can fake sort of disguise. But in the eye of machine learning, algorithm is anomaly. So basically we're trying to compile all the data set together and then to deconstruct and then to try and to reconstruct if it doesn't make sense. Meaning that it's cheating.
00:39:02.140 - 00:39:40.184, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Because I think when you were talking about that, I just thought, okay, if you have an event, say a marathon, well, there's could be up to thousands of runners and that could be perceived as, wait, someone's cheating. Right. Because there's so many people logging at the same time, the same gps, like kind of location, you're kind of triangulating because the way I think location data is gathered, it might be like the algorithm might say, oh, this is cheating. And so does that limit, would you say that like, the fraudulent score goes up during events where there's like multiple, like people gathering or can you tease that out?
00:39:40.224 - 00:40:10.320, Speaker B: No, no. So when people gathering, you only will see they are very close up of their gps. But GPS is really only one metric. Everybody have different height. They put their phones at different part of their body pocket, you know, holding on hand, meaning that the elevations will always be different and then their pace will be different. So there are so many things, people are different. So you can now have two people, even they hold hand in hand.
00:40:10.320 - 00:40:13.536, Speaker B: They were still showing up. Different in the eye of algorithm.
00:40:13.560 - 00:40:46.472, Speaker C: Yeah. Speaking about this, what's next for the company that built the game is find Satoshi Labs. You built what is now applicable for walking and running, jogging. Do you see yourself doing other type of applications or different type of sports? I'm curious how you think about branching out into other kind of verticals or activities. To tap into this health conscious type.
00:40:46.488 - 00:42:37.798, Speaker B: Of app, we use walking or running because there is a way that we can verify if that's a actual human, but with a lot of other sport is very difficult because, for example, biking, I cannot distinguish if you are riding a motorbike or actually riding a bike or even driving a car because, you know, there's no movement, you know, with walking, running, you actually are moving up and down and also forward. So is verifiable. We have yet found any other type of sport we can easily verify their motion is genuine. So if you cannot verify that token could be mass produced by cheating or robots, and eventually the token much, much, much less than when it's supposed to be, because again, you know, it's infinite supply because there's no cost. I think that the point I'm trying to argue is if you are actually moving yourself, you want to put a price tag behind your work. So say for this distance I want to make how much money and, but if you are running a bot, you can run massive bot farms and there's no cost, let's say with actual humans, okay, if the token reward is too little, I'd rather not walk into it when they are not working, no token being produced, cell pressure reduce. We're starting to see the price rebalance.
00:42:37.966 - 00:43:12.894, Speaker C: Speaking of this, what other avenues, and you've hinted at this during the conversation, you see out there that can accrue value back to stabilizing the ecosystem? Maybe in that equation, do you see insurance companies getting interested, other brands getting interested, events like the New York Marathon or Ironman? I'm curious how you think about the evolution of the ecosystem from a cash flow perspective and having what we call sinks, reasons for people to use the token, not just immediately kind of swap it and clock in again.
00:43:13.434 - 00:44:24.358, Speaker B: The ultimately what we picture ourselves is it becomes the billboard of web3 where people can do the sponsorship of their marathon through our marathon mode and with Realms partnership for example, that to bring their part of the bargain, for example their ip or their users, you know, so there's many, many ways we try to bring external parties to be part of stepn and then we build something together and create more values, so, or to use stepn as a way to advertise. So basically, you know, the typical example would be say if they want to access the premium sort of web3 users that focus on their own health and are well off, and then they have to come to us and then we become the gateway and then we say, right, we'll charge you x amount of money and then this x amount portion of them, then go back to the community.
00:44:24.526 - 00:44:45.554, Speaker A: John, I think it was Chris Dixon who coined this phrase back in maybe 2015, 2016 come for the tool. Stay for the network. Right. Uh, right now, step in feels very much like a tool, less like a network, I would say. What, what's the plan to maybe build social features? Um, Santi mentioned Strava, so I'll go back to Strava. Right. And straw on Strava.
00:44:45.554 - 00:44:59.766, Speaker A: You can share, you can comment, you can give kudos on other people's runs. There's a leaderboard, there are in person events. I know you mentioned that you guys might build marathons yourself or build this network of marathons. What, but what's the plan to, to build the network less building the tool.
00:44:59.950 - 00:45:58.494, Speaker B: So that the social part, I think, is increasingly difficult to tackle, especially in the web3 world that everybody says social fi. Then how do you put the fight into the social without get gamed? The main issue is, let's say if we create a chatting group and say we reward people to chat and then immediately we have a lot of bots trying to say GM's repeatedly. So we need to have a verifiable way to encourage people or incentivize people to go social. But at the moment we can't find any. Maybe we'll find that in the future. So our direction with building the network is building offline networks. And also I think that's one thing that a bit of liking on the web, three on Twitter and on the discord, and they don't go out and meet people much.
00:45:58.494 - 00:46:42.822, Speaker B: And we're trying to build a vibrant offline community, at least for now, and to build ambassadors that could take the responsibilities to organize offline event and so gradually run that into a dao structure. And then we want to see how that take us. We don't know what's going to happen, but let's say we have virus of hundreds of city Dao or city running group. While that creates more synergies and that could create new opportunities for us, we just have to work toward that and see and find out.
00:46:42.938 - 00:47:11.600, Speaker A: Yeah. There's another thing I want to get your take on here, Jan. There are a lot of people who think that gaming is one of the best ways to onboard folks into Defi. Previously step in swaps went through orca. You guys launched your own Dex about three, maybe four weeks ago. It's already the most popular dex on Solana if I'm looking at the right numbers here, by a decent chunk. What is your plan? Yeah, I think 65% of all Dex daily active use.
00:47:11.600 - 00:47:29.724, Speaker A: Yeah. Are now on this decks that you guys build. What is your plan for basically a onboarding folks into Defi. And B, how do you think about, it's almost like this traditional question of build versus buy using other people's defi applications versus building them yourself. How do you think about that?
00:47:30.224 - 00:48:38.158, Speaker B: I think this is the part where we're going back to the thing we discussed is using stepmother as a user onboarding tool. And once they take it on board, they familiarize of how everything works. And then we can say, all right, what, you know, you've tried the NFT with Stepn, especially for the people that never sort of got into crypto before, right? So these people have no idea what Dex is, but they'll be part of the community, and within the community they can be educated and they'll find out what is Dex and can they add liquidity and create lp pairs and et cetera, et cetera, all these traditional sort of Dex stuff. So this is the part that we're trying to onboard user. When they are ready, when they're ready to, say, transform from a stepping user to a web3 users, they're going to need to know how to use stacks, they're going to need to use how to use NFT, marketplace and centralized exchanges, so on, so forth. So we just trying to build this different stage of flywheels. And then when they're ready, here we go.
00:48:38.158 - 00:49:12.138, Speaker B: That's a Dex. And when they're ready, marketplace. And we were thinking about building the music platforms, social platforms down the track. So when they need web3 tools or infrastructures, we have something there. So trying to build like a semi enclosed ecosystem where people will be within the ecosystem and then using same token and exchange values.
00:49:12.266 - 00:50:00.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, ultimately everything really is an attention game. And I think in many ways bored ape was the first instantiation of what started off as a lot of people that had never had no interest in crypto came for the first time. Then they've layered on so many things around that in the same way that WeChat did it back in the day. I am curious what kind of, if we can spend a moment talking about the behavior that you observing from all these users. Obviously, I'd be really interested in getting more insights from what you found interesting on that. Do they immediately start logging? It takes three, four weeks for the user to gradually work their way up. What kind of like user insights you can share with us that you're seeing?
00:50:01.154 - 00:50:55.894, Speaker B: I think we are seeing. I think user behavior are pretty much the same. They trying to maximize the returns. The return could be in different forms, but many of them trying to strategize so as soon as they got into the game, they discover that there's different paths with the success. And then starting to quickly analysis, analyze which pathway this should take for the long term holder or the users who say, all right, I'll having a GMT sneaker park them at level 30 with some of these gems inserted. So within the moment when GMT earning started, they can be the first one to dig in. And there also are the people that trying to really get the return on investment fairly quickly.
00:50:55.894 - 00:51:55.632, Speaker B: They're trying to strategize on different levels. I think the people posting their own guide say, all right, do level nine to level 19 and don't go beyond. And then you have, they did really, really down into this calculation game. And I think that's what we find very fascinating, is they become sort of a game between the developers and the users. The user always trying to find the best way to game the system, and we always trying to patch it up and create more token things. And then they create a very interesting dynamic between the app. And then the users is really trying to have something for people that, let's say for the minters at one time that we discovered that there are many particular person holding a lot of sneakers.
00:51:55.632 - 00:52:53.452, Speaker B: Just keep minting. And then that's when we started to install the minting scroll, which means that you can only get meeting scroll by running. And so, meaning that when people are making profits through just purely minting without any exercise, they have to buy this scroll from people that are doing the exercise. So the profit goes from the minter to the runners. And so once that happened, we started to see people strategize their way to maximize the meeting scrolls, and trying to discover what type of, what level of mystery box contain the meeting scroll and trying to explore. So it's, I think it's a constant evolving on user behavior. And for us, we really want to get people engaged and keep using the app.
00:52:53.452 - 00:52:58.784, Speaker B: And for the user is always trying to maximize their returns.
00:52:59.404 - 00:53:26.760, Speaker C: And of course, the perfect side effect of that is you whip into shape, which has always been one of the biggest criticisms around gaming. It's like you're just kind of a rotten potato in your couch. In this case, people are moving and, you know, obesity rates are up into the right. And that's pretty interesting. Do people log their weight in the platform? Do you collect other types of data? Because, you know, in Strava and others, like, you can monitor this stuff to kind of like, correlate it to the activity. I'm curious if you've thought about that.
00:53:26.792 - 00:53:59.076, Speaker B: People do post, yeah, people do post how they feel and also they do post pictures on Twitter. So, you know, you go search, you can feel find a whole bunch of them. And not only the weight, you know, it's always also the mental state. People are improving. You know, there's many cases I also can find on Twitter. So I think it's overall improving. So people don't discover this after they realized how much they have changed their shape.
00:53:59.076 - 00:54:11.664, Speaker B: And, you know, that's, that's when you sort of say, oh, hold on a second, my trouser become too big to hold my belly. What happened? You lost weight. And that's where they realized that the app is effective.
00:54:11.824 - 00:54:42.384, Speaker C: So last question for me. So when will I be able to go to my insurance provider and say, listen, I'm using this thing called step in. I've lost weight. I've become healthier by all these markers, metrics. Can I get a lower premium? Can I get some sort of discount on my insurance policy? Can I get a lower rate with doctors? Like, do you see that? And if that's on the roadmap, when do you think that is going to be a possibility?
00:54:42.964 - 00:55:53.794, Speaker B: We do have this type of ambition, but it becomes something that you're probably going to need to work with the government side in order to push something like this. And we certainly don't not going to see this in the near future. But I think what we're going to do is that we're going to have to prove to the market that we are a very much sustainable project with true impact to people. Also working on virus of the BD, really to demonstrate the level of execution we can put out, the level of partnership we can create and the level of users we can accrue and really not only get users, but also retain them, and not only getting the web3 users, but also the normies as well. I think that's truly when we starting to, I think, stand out and then be able to work in with more sort of a higher level of collaborations.
00:55:54.374 - 00:56:23.954, Speaker A: Yon, I think I just have one last question to wrap this up, which is, I'd love to just hear your reflections on building a crypto app that almost that kind of bridges between web two and web3. And like, what have been the limitations of maybe the infrastructure? And there are a lot of entrepreneurs who listen to this and folks who are building in crypto. So you guys obviously chose to build on Solana. What are the limitations? What have been the good things, the bad things? What do you wish existed on the infrastructure side of things that maybe could enable you to ten x or 100 x step in?
00:56:24.334 - 00:57:46.522, Speaker B: I think again, I mean, there's no shortcut on this, unfortunately, we tried, but really you really have to have something that is functional and operational and also interesting to play. We spend a lot of time basically just thinking every day and also talking and brainstorming. I think the limit is really your imagination. We always try to find where we can maximize the impact with the minimum effort. I think that's always what entrepreneur want to achieve, and we're always trying to find out sort of weakening and to improve that as well. So I think people, especially for the sort of for the startups, they really have to find that sweet spot before they move, because if they just pick any of area and it was the wrong area or wrong directions, and certainly the more they work and the more they spend their effort on, the further they're going to be away from success. So that's one and two.
00:57:46.522 - 00:58:38.844, Speaker B: I think when we first designed the app, we are far, far different from the original concept. So that's when we discovered the market, also the user demand, and we started to pivot. Right. So I think every day we are looking at the stats and we say, is there a better way we can deal with this? Do we need to pivot to something else? Do we need to open another branch to attract more users? I think we did a lot of trial and errors. I think we have to do it. One way is that you don't know until you try it, it doesn't work. We quickly will pivot again to something else and say, well, that direction works.
00:58:38.844 - 00:59:33.554, Speaker B: So I think for the journey that we've been through almost a year, is that we never really give up. If one way doesn't work, we try the other. If it doesn't run, we just keep trying until we find the right way and then we just push through and we'll have the exponential growth, and then if we're probably going to hit the bottleneck, and then we'll push through again. And I don't, you know, so I don't think we can stay still. Right. So we always have to keep trying, keep building and expanding, pivoting, you know, just to adapt the market, you know, especially in this current stage, basically adapt and survive. Yeah.
00:59:33.554 - 00:59:35.118, Speaker B: For that bull market.
00:59:35.166 - 00:59:50.234, Speaker A: So awesome. Well, Jan, it is tough not to root for you and to root for anyone who is helping to move this space forward. It's been an awesome conversation. Appreciate the time. And yeah, like I said, I think we're all rooting for you here.
00:59:50.774 - 01:00:01.584, Speaker C: I guess before we go any, perhaps one, where can people find you? Learn more about stepn. And two, maybe some parting thoughts or words you want to impress upon our listeners.
01:00:01.924 - 01:00:44.764, Speaker B: Sure. So I think in this particular market condition, we spend a lot of time just keep building and recruiting developers. I think, really people shouldn't. I've seen people sort of get really frustrated about this bear market and step out. I think, you know, been through the last bear market, which is really super depressing for me. Sometimes people just need to hang on there and eventually things get better. And I think people that stay through the last or the last two bear market could agree with me.
01:00:44.764 - 01:00:59.534, Speaker B: So for the people that first got into cryptos for this cycle could be difficult. But I do believe that the whole industry will get better.
01:01:00.034 - 01:01:35.150, Speaker C: Absolutely. In what better way? I think bear markets are for shredding. And so I think this is a perfect opportunity for people who've been in their basement not doing anything to get out, get moving. And I think everyone can sympathize with this idea that you always typically feel better after exercise. And so no matter how bad things you, you think are by looking at charts or a day or your portfolio, I think we've, we all can benefit from an extra walk or an extra run. And, you know, endorphins make you happy, not to quote legally blonde, but I am quoting legally blonde. And so exercise stimulates endorphins and endorphins make you happy.
01:01:35.150 - 01:02:14.594, Speaker C: So at least, you know, we can be in a bear market, but we can be happy by exercising. So I'm brutal. Yeah, I showed my true skin here, quoting legally blonde, but nonetheless, yeah. And this is great. I think the next evolution of apps really will show the world of the positive influence that creating systems that have better incentives, whether and applying that to things that really move the needle. And health is certainly one of those as the world kind of struggles with health crisis is something that is fascinating experiment, and I think it is working to some extent. And so, as Jason said, rooting for you.
01:02:14.594 - 01:02:23.578, Speaker C: And definitely you should check up on you guys over the next, in some time, see how you're doing. But otherwise, thanks for coming on the pod and sharing this with everyone.
01:02:23.666 - 01:02:23.954, Speaker B: Thank you.
