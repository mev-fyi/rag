00:00:00.480 - 00:00:08.873, Speaker A: Even though we have a lot of block space, these are not quality block space. And mega eth is the most differentiated block space that people will ever see.
00:00:08.929 - 00:00:27.349, Speaker B: For us, eth alignment means bringing that power of eth to as many people as possible. And mega eth does that because we understand the role of a L2 and we're not trying to become a layer one. We're not trying to decentralize a sequencer and bring consensus back into this. Where in actuality, what do you need to take is take the power of Ethereum and scale it out.

00:02:21.209 - 00:02:23.777, Speaker C: We got the Mega ETH folks, the.
00:02:23.801 - 00:02:42.775, Speaker D: Most hyped project in crypto that nobody knows anything about. So we wanted to have them on the pod. Santi's an investor. I'm not. Connected me to brother Bing and Nomik in New York. Met them in person, had an awesome conversation, said I Don't think anyone knows this about Mega Eth, so I would love to have them on. So brother Bing Namek, welcome to the pod.
00:02:43.435 - 00:02:44.335, Speaker A: Pleasure.
00:02:44.835 - 00:02:45.859, Speaker E: Welcome guys.
00:02:46.027 - 00:02:50.403, Speaker D: So this is the most ridiculous thing. They all have Mega Eth hats and I don't.
00:02:50.499 - 00:02:54.135, Speaker E: So you can tell who's in the inner circle.
00:02:54.915 - 00:02:56.815, Speaker D: Mega E. Cabal. Right?
00:02:57.475 - 00:02:58.563, Speaker A: Had cabal.
00:02:58.699 - 00:03:19.495, Speaker D: The had cabal. So okay, maybe let's start with the basics, which is. I don't. Shuya, can you just walk us through the story of Mega Eth and like starting maybe actually way back pre Mega Eth, like with your days at Consensys and then talking to Vitalik and like just tell us the whole backstory of Mega Eth. Let's. Let's start there.
00:03:19.655 - 00:04:19.575, Speaker A: So like most of people I got into crypto in 2017. I used to live in Africa, so the idea of crypto was really obvious. I think having a alternative financial real is extremely important for society. Then I moved from Nigeria and Africa to Middle east and then joined consensus during 2017 thinking, you know what, Ethereum is going to take over the world tomorrow. And during my days at Consensus I worked on a lot of very interesting ideas like for example, putting the traffic light on the blockchain, which obviously is not very feasible or realistic. But during the process I witnessed Consensus grew from having 50 different ideas putting everything on the blockchain to really consensys 2.0 with our marquee products such as Metamask, Infura, Truffle, Quorum as well as Linear, which was our layer 2 answers the ZKEVM.
00:04:19.575 - 00:04:48.719, Speaker A: So during my days at Consensys I was leading business development for all of our products. One thing I noticed is quite obvious was we often get tickets for Metamask. Something goes wrong. Most times people get fish, but other times it's like transaction does not go through. So you get a ticket and you're like, let me investigate. And you're like, okay, is there something wrong with MetaMask? And you go a layer deeper. You're like, okay, maybe there's something wrong with the rpc.
00:04:48.719 - 00:05:24.753, Speaker A: Then you go to Infuria. You're like, okay, you know what, Infuria is performing pretty well. And then the problem goes to the base layer and the base layer always has problem and the base layer has not scale even with the current layer 2. So a lot of people ask, there are so many blockchains and so many L2s, why are you doing another Mega East? My answer has always been, even though we have a lot of block space. These are not quality block space. And Mega east is the most differentiated block space that people will ever see. So that's how we started Mega East.
00:05:24.929 - 00:05:36.665, Speaker D: Okay, I got to ask about that one. When you say all the other block spaces are not quality, but we are quality. It's a nice marketing line, I would say, but you got to say more about that.
00:05:37.245 - 00:05:43.549, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just saying a lot of ways you have to look at what is possible on what kind of block space.
00:05:43.717 - 00:05:44.069, Speaker F: Right.
00:05:44.117 - 00:06:04.687, Speaker B: The Ethereum roadmap so far has been very much around. Like let's get a bunch of these different roll ups and let's scale horizontally and have like 10,000 roll ups. Really, really cool. But then you ask yourself what can actually exist on those roll ups. So yeah, you can have like a lot of roll ups and by having a lot of roll ups you kind of have a lot of capacity.
00:06:04.831 - 00:06:05.183, Speaker F: Right.
00:06:05.239 - 00:06:33.395, Speaker B: But what's the actual capability of the application can sit on any of these different chains. What are the kinds of applications that can actually sit on these chains? I think a great one is like autonomous worlds and fully on chain games, but everyone thinks it's really cool. But a fully on chain game has to be fully on chain and there is no block space that can facilitate a truly fully on chain game that isn't a horrible and janky ux. What's the result? There are no really fully on train games out there today.
00:06:34.535 - 00:06:41.595, Speaker D: Hmm. Okay, so maybe Shuya, you want to keep going with the story and like, yeah, just take us up to present day I guess.
00:06:42.455 - 00:07:19.463, Speaker A: Yeah. So you know, when I met my co founder, we are, you know, three co founders. Elon went to Stanford, study low latency data center compute, PhD lay one time IT study high throughput network which is practically blockchain for six years. So they came up with the idea of Mega East. When I met them, I was like, you know, what is a fucking scammy name? Like Mega east, right? Like it just sounds like another 2017 ICO scam. But when I really look at the tech, I was like, you know, this is just the most differentiated block space. And then yeah, I was hanging out with Vitalik.
00:07:19.463 - 00:07:49.185, Speaker A: I was like asking him around, checking out the white paper. And it turned out that the idea of Mega Eth was actually already written in a blog post he wrote in 2021 called Endgame. So what he wrote in the blog post was the end game of a blockchain network is a relatively centralized block production environment and extremely decentralized block validating network. And that's exactly what mega eth is. That's the end of my story.
00:07:51.215 - 00:08:15.925, Speaker E: Can we double click on that? Because I think that's. If there's one takeaway of this entire conversation is, is that. Because I remember the first time that I had a conversation with you guys that was. And I told you, you delivered like a couple of key insights which I always look for in teams. This was the first one and I was like, I perked up when I heard it because. Just delay the context and I'll shut up. Yeah, most people would not lead with that.
00:08:15.925 - 00:08:17.749, Speaker E: If you talk to an L2 that wouldn't lead with that.
00:08:17.797 - 00:08:17.981, Speaker F: Right?
00:08:18.013 - 00:09:11.695, Speaker E: There's, there's. And to me, it's just not a full appreciation of where it matters of, of what you need to have decentralized and what ultimately are the functions of blockchain block blockchains and what is the most important thing? Because, mind you, like, we're been in an environment where a lot of the L2s are not really L2s. You know, they don't have fraud proofs. And instead of focusing on building a fraud proof, they're thinking about doing things that don't matter as much, like decentralizing the sequencer. I'm like, well, focus on goddamn fraud proofs and then decentralize the sequencer. So that's been, from my vantage point as an investor, pretty frustrating. And then I hear you guys say that, what you just said, and I was like, okay, this is quite differentiated at a time where there's like infra fatigue, which I disagree with, so I'll stop talking, but I'd love for you to double click on what you just said.
00:09:12.035 - 00:09:58.655, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's an ugly truth in crypto, right, which is performance does not go well with decentralization. And you can see this on the L1 landscape too, right? Most nodes are homogeneous, meaning that these nodes do all the tasks of a blockchain. And you have to think what really matters to you. So for Ethereum, what really matters is decentralization. Validation needs to be as simple as possible for as many people as possible. And as a result, you know, no one wants, no one's going to pretend that Ethereum is a environment that's performant, but clearly there is need for performant block space. And that's kind of where Solana came in with more beefy nodes that allows them to do additional optimizations, and before you know it, you have a more performant execution environment.
00:09:58.655 - 00:10:53.883, Speaker B: But our thesis is that even Solana is not truly performant when we're comparing to web2 quality, web2 performance, no blockchain is truly performant. And for mega, you know, there is some really, really interesting designs that you can do once you take the inherent like security guarantees of a L2, right? So L2s are able to inherit the security and decentralization of Ethereum in two ways. One is escape hatch which is very powerful, right? Your E is always safe, it can always go back to L1. No one indexes on how powerful that is. And the second is what you said the past few years of L2 land have been focusing on proofs, fraud proofs. So given these two things, mage thesis is hey, you know, we're L2. Let's do what a L2 is supposed to do, which is hyperscale and make an execution environment that's extremely performant.
00:10:53.883 - 00:11:42.045, Speaker B: So what we say is, well let's look back at those nodes, let's see how all of these L1s had to pick and choose where they want to sit on this trade off curve of like performance versus decentralization. What if we could have each of these tasks, right? So the tasks are like broadly block production and block validation. What if we could have hyper specialized both in terms of hardware as well as software configurations for these tasks. So what we say is okay, the dream state for sequencing and execution is not decentralized. It's actually very beefy and very performant. So you can stream transactions on chain instantly. So what does that look like? And we go back to first principles and we basically build the Mega EVE sequencer.
00:11:42.045 - 00:12:33.465, Speaker B: It is not decentralized, it's bare metal and it's very, very powerful. We are able to do optimizations like in memory, compute, JIT compiling, parallelization because we've decided to create a very beefy sequencer. So that's like sequencing, that's block production. But the beauty is because we have chosen to specialize all of our nodes, we can do that for validation as well, right? The nodes that do block validation can be extremely light because our prover network, each of the prover nodes do a subset of the sequences transactions in a model similar to stateless validation. And then we use eigen for da and as a result we're able to have a architecture where hardware is the only limit and we mean that in its truest form. So 100k tps and 1 millisecond block times.
00:12:34.885 - 00:12:51.335, Speaker D: Is this like an abandonment of the, of the ETH values? And you're basically just saying screw the ETH values, like let's just build the most high performant blockchain. Because people are sick about like this whole decentralization theater. Like let's just maximize for performance here.
00:12:51.455 - 00:12:57.319, Speaker B: Yeah. I would say that Chiao and I are some of the most if aligned people you can imagine. But it's actual if alignment.
00:12:57.367 - 00:12:57.575, Speaker F: Right.
00:12:57.615 - 00:13:04.927, Speaker B: I grew up in countries where the value of the U.S. or the value of the native currency devalued 80% in the span of three months.
00:13:05.111 - 00:13:05.835, Speaker F: Right.
00:13:06.135 - 00:13:56.275, Speaker B: And when we look at this question like what is alignment? It's leveraging the power and decentralization of Ethereum to bring the world on chain. That's not possible as an L1, right. I mean, I promise you the new L1 that's going to launch is not going to be more decentralized in Ethereum. For us, ETH alignment means bringing that power of ETH as many people as possible. And mega Eth does that because we understand the role of a L2 and we're not trying to become a layer one, we're not trying to decentralize the sequencer and bring consensus back into this. Where in actuality what do you need to take the power of Ethereum and scale it out? So I think like ETH alignment is much more about apps users experiences bringing stuff that no one could have done before in web2, meaning peer to peer networks, crypto economics to the people.
00:13:57.455 - 00:14:36.711, Speaker A: I think the other thing would be, I think a lot of people confuse ETH alignment with Ethereum foundation alignment. I think there's a lot of just people maneuvering that we have fucking zero interest in our vision and square focus is on adoption things we're doing. For example, I had a great time at Zuzalu last year and we're bringing a megazoo format into Thailand where we bring application builders, only application builders who can leverage Ethereum technology to build things for real people. That to me is alignment.
00:14:36.903 - 00:15:12.935, Speaker E: Yeah, I want to spend a little bit more time on this concept of massively centralized block production and decentralized validation because I think it's quite important. And so we've had folks from Arbitrum, Optimism blast, pretty much Solana, Monad, Bera, all these different kind of execution environments and L2s. The obvious question is why haven't people tried this before? You have hundreds of L2s like what? Why do you think that is?
00:15:14.355 - 00:15:40.115, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually thought quite a lot about it because it's so obvious. Right. The architecture is there. I think there are two reasons. The first one is Ethereum development largely depend on, you know, where the EF points Their fingers at the EF has been focusing quite a lot on consensus and not so much on performance. So I think that's one aspect. The second one is actually on capability.
00:15:40.115 - 00:16:19.563, Speaker A: The thing we're doing to optimize the sequencer is really hard and we are the only team that can do it because Elon studied like how database works and we rerolled the entire state tree and lay studies consensus so we actually understand the blockchain. So you need a team that actually knows both in order to produce what we're doing. And that's why people say, oh, you know, we can just do a Mega Eth clone. And there are a bunch of them out there. It's like Mega east parallel Layer two. But you know what, parallelization is such a tiny part of our tech stack. There's so much going in that's optimizing the sequencer that no one has the capability to do it.
00:16:19.563 - 00:16:21.975, Speaker A: So I think these are the two combined reasons.
00:16:23.995 - 00:16:27.651, Speaker E: Make you're nodding. Anything you want to add to that point?
00:16:27.843 - 00:16:36.331, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, just music to my ears. Right? Yeah. I think there's like two aspects of this. I think fundamentally consensus is difficult.
00:16:36.403 - 00:16:36.683, Speaker F: Right.
00:16:36.739 - 00:16:54.631, Speaker B: Like there are a lot of really smart people in the L2 world and they've worked on these problems and this is what they've been focusing on. And it allows us to, you know, be able to leverage the power of fraud proof and build what we're doing. So I think it's a lot of like the right time and the right team that allows us to build Mega eve.
00:16:54.663 - 00:17:25.729, Speaker E: Now I hear hardware specialization and I think about a lot of the criticism that Solana has faced around higher hardware requirements and costs. And it was, I think now people have come to understand the nuance. Could you double click on that on the specs? Not to get too technical, but just at a high level. The hardware itself, the cost, like the, you know, would love to understand that a little bit more.
00:17:25.857 - 00:17:42.625, Speaker B: Yeah, I will just. It's all in our. We have a, in this research tab of the Mage website. We have a basic breakdown of what those costs will be like and the difference between our, our nodes and everyone else's. So I'll walk you through that. But I do want to touch on one thing before that. Santi, I know you're a big so bowl.
00:17:42.625 - 00:17:44.417, Speaker B: I think there's a big difference between.
00:17:44.561 - 00:17:46.233, Speaker E: Hardware, Mega Eth hats.
00:17:46.329 - 00:17:55.397, Speaker B: Yeah. Mega bullish man. There are big differences between like, you know, that trade off on the L1 versus that trade off on the L2.
00:17:55.501 - 00:17:56.053, Speaker F: Right.
00:17:56.189 - 00:18:07.205, Speaker B: When you're increasing the hardware requirements on the layer one to run a node that's like. It makes sense because you get more performance, but you are, you know, basically decreasing the validator set.
00:18:07.245 - 00:18:07.397, Speaker F: Right.
00:18:07.421 - 00:18:37.915, Speaker B: The amount of people who can participate on Mega Eve. That's not exactly a concern because we're not even pretending to have like a multi. Like a decentralized sequencer architecture for us. We're saying let's take the valuable part of having really, really powerful and beefy hardware and have one sequencer run that at any point in time. And let's make sure that the validation hardware is as low as possible. But sure, Let me walk you guys through some of the numbers on our end.
00:18:37.955 - 00:18:38.251, Speaker F: Right.
00:18:38.323 - 00:19:10.509, Speaker B: So the average Ethereum node is a two core CPU 48 memory, 48 gig, 4 to 8 gigabytes memory, 25 megabytes per second on network Solana is 12 cores. 256 GB and 1 to 10 GBS. Right. Our sequencer alone will be 100 cores. 1 to 4 memories of terabyte 10 gigabyte 10 GBS for network. 1 to 4 memories of 1 to 4 terabytes in memory. My bad.
00:19:10.509 - 00:19:19.505, Speaker B: That's going to be pretty expensive to run right around $10 an hour. While our approver nodes are going to be extremely light, much lighter than an Ethereum or Solana nodes.
00:19:19.545 - 00:19:19.721, Speaker F: Right.
00:19:19.753 - 00:19:33.285, Speaker B: And that's going to be running. The cost of running Those will be $0.004 an hour. So very, very cheap for validation, relatively expensive for production, but that's a cost that we incur.
00:19:34.905 - 00:19:41.203, Speaker E: Got it. Because you're running it so it's subsidized or you're paying that in some way, shape or form.
00:19:41.219 - 00:19:41.795, Speaker A: Yes.
00:19:41.955 - 00:19:45.843, Speaker B: And the plan will be in the future to have a rotational sequencer architecture.
00:19:45.979 - 00:19:46.347, Speaker F: Right.
00:19:46.411 - 00:20:07.481, Speaker B: Where the Mega EVE team will not be the only people who run the sequencer until the end of our days. But the second you have and we're pro a rotation of who is running the sequencer. What is important to us that there's only one sequencer that's running at any given time. That's how you make sure that maintain that level of performance. We're not trying to sell some kind of magic antidote.
00:20:07.633 - 00:20:08.017, Speaker F: Right?
00:20:08.081 - 00:20:11.801, Speaker B: Like our performance comes from the fact that we have one sequencer running.
00:20:11.873 - 00:20:32.605, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. When you. I know it might be farther ahead in the future, but what would a world where you're rotating look like? You're presumably selecting initially the other parties that can do the production? Or would it be permissionless in some Way, shape or form.
00:20:33.535 - 00:20:57.047, Speaker B: It's pretty early. So I don't want to be talking on stuff I'm not really sure about, to be frank. But I mean, I think big picture, you can think of it as a block based thing, right? So like block 1 to 100 is sequencer A, block 100 to 200 is sequencer B. And there's lots of different models in which you can enable the most performance sequencer to be the one that's participating.
00:20:57.151 - 00:20:57.799, Speaker F: Right.
00:20:57.967 - 00:21:19.455, Speaker B: This isn't like a. It's a fair meritocracy. In the end of the day, if Mage is not able to create the most performance sequencer and someone is coming for a more performance sequencer, that sequencer should be the one that's running the network. So a mixture of rotational architectures plus a game where the most performance sequencer is able to run the network for.
00:21:19.615 - 00:21:42.315, Speaker E: People that might not be super well versed. I don't want to lose them. Could you spend very quick 101 on like sequencing itself and maybe contrast that with like a. Something like Arbitrum? Right. They're running the sequencing themselves. But what about their. The way that they're doing it is sub optimal relative to how you're doing is just the hardware itself.
00:21:42.735 - 00:21:43.311, Speaker F: Sure.
00:21:43.423 - 00:22:01.169, Speaker B: So there are two aspects of this. The first one is like, okay, so the arbitrum sequencer is. There's obviously. So what you're saying is correct. There's only one sequence that's running on Arbitrum. The difference is they haven't optimized the sequencer. There's a couple of reasons why they do this.
00:22:01.217 - 00:22:01.689, Speaker F: Right.
00:22:01.817 - 00:22:09.457, Speaker B: One is because maybe they want to decentralize the sequencer in the future. The second is to make sure their prover architecture is able to match the sequencer.
00:22:09.521 - 00:22:10.009, Speaker F: Right.
00:22:10.137 - 00:22:39.433, Speaker B: Usually if you have one, if you have sequencing that's extremely performant and you don't have an architecture that's optimized on the validation side to match that sequencer, the thing breaks apart. So what we do is we basically say, hey, let's create this extremely performant block production via sequencing and then work backwards. How can we make sure that we have every single other part of the sack not become the bottleneck itself? If you make just a sequencer performance, the bottleneck goes somewhere else. That's why we use like eigenva.
00:22:39.529 - 00:22:39.857, Speaker F: Right.
00:22:39.921 - 00:22:58.895, Speaker B: And a lot of people will use eigenva in the future, but then their sequencer will become the bottleneck because their sequence doesn't run at a similar enough interval at a quick Enough interval to us, which results in priority fee markets kicking in. So the answer is optimizations. No one's decided to take this extreme.
00:22:59.595 - 00:23:06.095, Speaker A: I think the answer is extreme node specialization. No one does it more than we do.
00:23:08.835 - 00:23:45.627, Speaker E: And maybe on that point itself, thinking about just you reference like people trying to copy Mega Ethan. It's fairly common, you know, in this open source chaotic world. What went into that specialization? You know, you have other folks in the team that are highly technical as well. Like how long did it take you guys to develop this? When was the key insights around this? Was this sort of like brainchild of MIT coming out of MIT or. I'm just kind of curious like how this all came together.
00:23:45.811 - 00:24:23.311, Speaker A: Yeah, my urge to say it's a brainchild of Stanford, MIT and Harvard. And then you can't get more pedigree than the Mega east team. Name another one. I mean, it took quite a long time, right? The idea started about a year and a half ago when Elon graduated from his PhD program and got really fascinated with the blockchain space. And you know, for like outsiders, for crypto native researchers, we love the little problem that makes us feel so good. So when Elon came in, he's like, yo, this is not that hard. No specialization, like do things with the sequencer.
00:24:23.311 - 00:24:47.199, Speaker A: Which is something he studied for six years at Stanford. So he did architecture. And then Leijun was like, okay, I can do even more with the Eigenda. So that's why I combined them together. It took us a year and a half to be where we are. A lot of our engineering work is actually in, and not only in designing, but coding the sequencer. That takes a lot of time.
00:24:47.199 - 00:25:34.425, Speaker A: And most of our engineers have experiences in open source software, in designing really large network from filecoin, for example. And fun fact, our engineers aren't just your nerdy crypto. Well, nerdy research engineers. They actually really believe in crypto, something we do when we're hiring folks. It's like, you know, are you really here for the next five years? Do you believe that crypto is going to take over the world? And that's something we see from our engineer as well. That's why I tend to think that we have a very powerful team because our mission is extremely aligned with the wider crypto industry. And then to answer your other question about, you know, what other people would be doing, I mean, other people could, you know, if you have a centralized sequencer, right, you can claim a lot what we're claiming.
00:25:34.425 - 00:25:56.825, Speaker A: You can cheat on your code, you can dial Up a few things. But for you to achieve 100,000 tps and submit a second latency, you can't just simply dial a few things, right? Like change something on op, stack and parameter would give you maybe, I don't know, like one second block time. But millisecond is a very heavy lift.
00:25:57.885 - 00:25:59.711, Speaker E: Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.
00:25:59.823 - 00:26:01.875, Speaker D: What's, what's the downside of doing this?
00:26:03.255 - 00:26:04.235, Speaker A: Doing what?
00:26:05.135 - 00:26:22.127, Speaker D: Well, if you look at all of the L1s and all of the L2s, there is a trade off in, in, in every single one of them. And so I'm just curious how you guys think about the trade off of Mega Eth. There's got to be some trade off or downside by making one thing really good. There's. You're, you're hurting something else.
00:26:22.191 - 00:26:47.717, Speaker B: So yeah, I mean, I think that we are. Our downside is we're going to the extreme of this architecture, right. Meaning it's very difficult to like if like decentralizing the sequencer, meaning having the performance breakdown that you would have from one chain decentralizing their sequencer to mega, you've decentralized in their sequencer are very, very different.
00:26:47.861 - 00:26:48.501, Speaker F: Right.
00:26:48.653 - 00:26:54.777, Speaker B: Our ability to have this level of execution, if we were to choose to go the other way, would go away.
00:26:54.881 - 00:26:55.241, Speaker F: Right.
00:26:55.313 - 00:27:21.485, Speaker B: So I think a lot of people when they ask, why do you have a centralized sequencer? What are the downsides of it? The main one is like, we cannot, like our performance will be much, much worse if we decide to bring consensus back into this. Right. In a comparable manner. And I think the second one is like, there's a lot of questions around how do you create more censorship resistant sequencer architectures? And that's where we're working with the rotational sequencer.
00:27:22.665 - 00:27:53.239, Speaker D: What do you, if you guys are successful? I feel like a lot of the like crypto infrastructure in the industry is not actually set up to support something that, I mean like something that actually goes this fast. Like, like literally the RPCs, the indexers, like I think a lot of them max out at like what, 10, 10,000 maybe like, like if you guys are successful there, the things in the industry won't be able to support you guys, like the RBCs and the indexers. So how, Yeah, I guess are you going to have to build all of that in house or how do you think about that?
00:27:53.367 - 00:28:15.173, Speaker B: Yeah, it's unfortunate we will have to build all of this in house or find people to build this for us. Yeah, it's interesting, right, because this level of performance is not something that like we can go find like Solana teams and convince them to, you know, do a couple optimizations or change X or Y and plug right in. Solana is not fast enough to match Mega Eve.
00:28:15.319 - 00:28:15.889, Speaker F: Right.
00:28:16.017 - 00:28:22.525, Speaker B: So we need to find, incubate and work with teams to build a new wave of infrastructure.
00:28:23.905 - 00:28:30.353, Speaker D: I mean even though. One more question Santu before you jump in is like even the DA layer, I think you guys are using Eigend.
00:28:30.489 - 00:28:31.193, Speaker C: Yes.
00:28:31.369 - 00:28:51.565, Speaker D: Like even Eigenda is not spec to support. I was looking at the, I did a quick review of like their docs right before this call. So I might be totally wrong but like even Eigenda's doesn't seem like they're spec to support what you guys are trying to build on Mega Eth. So I mean that's not an RPC or an indexer. Like that's like a core thing of your tech stack. How do you think about that?
00:28:52.305 - 00:29:20.321, Speaker A: Yeah, so the current spec you're seeing probably outdated. We work quite closely with Eigen team. They actually have engineers who are dedicated to make sure that they have capacity for us. So yeah, we're going to see significant improvement. But on the other side, I think it's the middleware like the first example I mentioned. From the wallet to RPC to Data index and all of that. I think simple things like Block Explorer.
00:29:20.321 - 00:29:38.405, Speaker A: I fucking hate looking at Blog Explorer. It's just, it's not good. So we're really thinking about how to make Block Explorer super user friendly and make sure people just see how fast it is. So I think all of these are part of a Mega Eth ecosystem. Right? We're not just building a chain, we're building everything supporting tools around the chain.
00:29:39.935 - 00:30:26.671, Speaker C: Hey everyone, Jason here just wanted to take a quick break to talk about something exciting in the world of blockchain.

This episode is brought to you by Polygon Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source Zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains.
00:31:44.159 - 00:31:47.023, Speaker C: With the AG layer, that was a big mouthful.
00:31:47.079 - 00:31:47.743, Speaker D: So I'm going to tell you what.
00:31:47.759 - 00:32:07.599, Speaker C: It means in my words. There's all these things popping up, L2s and L3s and it's chaos, right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just, just build in the AG layer to tap into the liquidity of the AG layer and the users of the AG layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the AG layer. It's hot.
00:32:07.687 - 00:32:08.815, Speaker D: It's by Polygon Labs.
00:32:08.855 - 00:32:22.823, Speaker C: They've got the Polygon Community Grants Program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for Polygon builders. Season one. It's live right now. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon builders.
00:32:22.879 - 00:32:25.031, Speaker D: Join the aggregated future today by applying.
00:32:25.063 - 00:32:53.183, Speaker C: At Polygon Technology Grants. That's Polygon Technology Grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know blockwork sent you.

00:32:53.183 - 00:33:18.575, Speaker C: Picture this. You're browsing late at night and accidentally approve a shady transaction and it's too late to cancel it. I know, I've been there before. Well, now Harpy's Got your back. It jumps in, intercepts that transaction, and takes your assets away to a vault that you control all completely free. It works with all the major wallets on Ethereum, Base, Polygon and Arbitrum. Head over to Harpy IO Empire and set up your free protection today.
00:33:18.575 - 00:33:26.385, Speaker C: That's Harpy IO Empire. I promise you that your future self will thank you. Now, let's get back to today's episode.
00:33:27.845 - 00:34:51.784, Speaker E: I think this turns into like a second chapter of this conversation, which is we focused on performance. And I tend to think that that that sort of like, can be a very tiring conversation because everyone claims to have, you know, the best highest tps, and there's all these, like, there's no standards, right? And people confuse latency with throughput and all this stuff. But the more important thing is, like, we're talking in an environment, mind you, where Ethereum L1 fees are a record low. So what does that tell you, right? It's just, have we built useful applications? Because we probably have an excess supply of block space. Because, I mean, just by virtue of the fees, right? And so while it is important to build, to optimize, to build for a future where you can envision billions of users on chain and whatnot, there's already been fair amount of traction and I've had the benefit and privilege of seeing it firsthand when I went to Berlin and saw some of the projects that are building on Mega. So I'd like to focus this part of the conversation on how you envision winning that BD game. What type of applications? How do we get millions and millions of users on chain? Because my thesis is it's sort of pointless to have a discussion around performance when we don't have users or killer applications.
00:34:51.784 - 00:35:08.324, Speaker E: It doesn't fucking matter. It's like you have a Ferrari, but no one can drive it, or it doesn't have gas. It's pointless, right? So talk to us about that. How do you win that game? And how do you build a thriving ecosystem of killer apps?
00:35:09.395 - 00:35:41.813, Speaker B: So it's all about latency. Everyone hates latency in life. Like, I hate latency. If it takes my phone a couple seconds to load a web page, I get mad, right? And like, what. What's going on here? And I think that's like, the excuse I keep telling myself for why we haven't won and as an industry yet, why we haven't been able to get users in crypto yet. Because infrastructure, infrastructure is not there. But as Vitalik has called us in the past, right, endearingly megaf is an AWS server of blockchain scaffolding.
00:35:41.813 - 00:36:09.297, Speaker B: That's the level of performance we're talking about. So now it's up to US to build Web2 performance applications with the power of peer to peer networks and crypto economics. And there's a couple ways to go about this. We can say that the builders will come. Oh yeah, the tech is good. The builders, they'll come. Yeah, let's create a blog post or we go and we find these builders and we're like, yo, it's time, let's build something insane.
00:36:09.297 - 00:37:06.259, Speaker B: And we pick the latter, right? So we have a very, very targeted go to market strategy in which we find the smartest people that we know. We basically spend a lot of time with them, convincing them to build on Maggie for context. 3 hours literally in SF right now for one team that we're very bullish on and then we do everything in our power to make them win. That goes from building an application that will not become like the 50th lending market on some execution environment, but a billion dollar business that is enabling a new kind of user behavior that Web2 could not facilitate. It's the ultimate dream, right? Like, I'm sure all four of us got into crypto because we had some wacky idea of what a blockchain would enable and make the world a better place. I remember mine was pretty lame. I was into like bringing legal contracts on chain, right? I know it's kind of, it's kind of out there.
00:37:06.259 - 00:37:39.463, Speaker B: But you know, all of these ideas, you quickly become disenfranchised and now you're like, I guess the future of this industry or the future of France is. And the 6 meme coin launchpad. But this time we can short them as well. Or it's on a bonding curve. It's like a staking mechanism, right? Like that's not the future of crypto. So what we do is we find these teams and we work with them to build really interesting ideas. These ranging from wild game shows where the individual's data is not so valuable as to traditionally be logged on in blockchain.
00:37:39.463 - 00:38:12.255, Speaker B: But in aggregate, when there's many of them, it now becomes immensely valuable for different kinds of verification mechanisms. Or we're talking about decentralized VPN networks where you're able to enable a peer to peer network to compete with Web2 with zero latency trade offs. We find these teams, we work with them closely and we make sure that they are able to bring in net new users. We're not in the business of trying to vampire attack some user from chain A or chain B, we're in the business of vampire attacking facebook web2 meta all of these guys.
00:38:16.995 - 00:38:31.429, Speaker D: Do you need like the basic defi things though? And like can you make the, can you make the basics better? Because like, like take a, take a club, right? Like a club on eth or something like that. Like it just, it's not going to be as good like high latency.
00:38:31.517 - 00:38:32.253, Speaker C: It's not going to be as good.
00:38:32.269 - 00:38:34.741, Speaker D: As a, like a Binance or Coinbase.
00:38:34.773 - 00:38:34.965, Speaker F: Right.
00:38:35.005 - 00:38:52.067, Speaker D: High latency, expensive gas, low throughput. Like if I'm understanding your guys vision like yes, compete with the Facebooks and Googles and all that kind of stuff and get the apps but like I mean can't you make a club that's better than any other club that's ever existed? Yeah, I mean isn't that a win? Yeah, yeah.
00:38:52.091 - 00:38:57.299, Speaker B: I mean we're not even mentioning like low hanging fruit W is across the board there.
00:38:57.347 - 00:38:57.935, Speaker F: Right.
00:38:58.395 - 00:39:08.995, Speaker B: But yeah we have. I'm just joking, I'm just joking. I think that fundamentally a club is a. We are. All of our defi apps are really, really interesting. We already have them. We have world star teams.
00:39:08.995 - 00:39:23.911, Speaker B: For example our club is X imc, X Jump, X Coinbase, X Alchemy. And you know what they're doing is the fundamental pieces that L1 has just has too much jitter and not, not a low enough latency to be competitive with finance.
00:39:24.063 - 00:39:24.615, Speaker F: Right.
00:39:24.735 - 00:39:32.871, Speaker B: Versus Mega Eve where you're literally at parity with finance Real time decks, that's clubs. Lending markets also very exciting.
00:39:32.943 - 00:39:33.463, Speaker F: Right?
00:39:33.599 - 00:40:02.685, Speaker B: What's the biggest issue of lending markets? I mean primarily the. It's like either the end user is going to get screwed by an unfair liquidation margin or the protocol is going to be screwed and have bad debt. But if Mega where you have one millisecond block times with a co located or price Oracle, meaning that you're pushing price feeds at the same frequency and speed as Binance, you no longer have these issues and you have just more efficient markets. So yeah, Defi also game changer across the board.
00:40:06.785 - 00:40:42.445, Speaker E: Can you talk a little bit about the decision for a builder in the current landscape? You know they could decide to build on another L2. They could go to Solana. You mentioned Solana. I want to focus there because that's where we're seeing a lot of activity. You know it's, it's gotten a lot of attention and so I'm curious like what is going through the mind of a builder that is deciding, hey, I can't get this in Solana, but I can't get it in Mega Eth. And, and I. And I guess as a.
00:40:42.445 - 00:40:43.865, Speaker E: So let's just start there.
00:40:45.205 - 00:40:48.589, Speaker A: What do you mean by I can't get this on Solana? I can't. Yeah.
00:40:48.637 - 00:41:51.845, Speaker E: You know, right now, for instance, like, I know Solana, like you said, and I agree with it, no blockchain is perfect in its current instantiation and like, you know, so. But you're seeing a lot of builders move to Solana and build there. And so I am curious what is going through the mind of someone that says, I'd rather build on Mega Eth? I guess this was going to be my follow up, so I'll just bring it up now because it really goes to the heart of the fragmented L2 ecosystem. People talk about the network effects of Ethereum, which I sort of would challenge because it's very fragmented. If you're an arbitrum, going to base is difficult, right? And so that presents UX and just is more difficult for a user to understand than going to a integrated chain like Solana. You don't have to leave. You load up your funds there in Phantom and you're doing whatever it is that you're doing there.
00:41:51.845 - 00:42:27.357, Speaker E: Whereas in Ethereum, it's challenging, right? You have to flip through the different networks that might get abstracted away. And that's okay. You know, I know OP is working really in their cluster and whatnot, but it's, it's, it's, it's more fragmented. It's just presents issues for the user is what I care about and really is the focus on the user. So how do you think about you guys building as an L2? And I know sometimes you would probably challenge that, but like, how. What is that user experience. Correct.
00:42:27.357 - 00:42:50.105, Speaker E: I know that. And then. So do you understand? Do you see where I'm trying to get at? It's really on this focus of the user experience. And how do you become the best, the easiest place for people to interact? And do you not care about all the other L2s? Do you not care about the other networks? You just.
00:42:53.615 - 00:43:35.465, Speaker B: So I think there's two questions there, right? I think you first started by saying, how will a build, like why on earth would a builder on SOL build on NAG if instead. And then the second point, which I think is very important is around like the fragmentation and just like the noise, the amount of noise on L2. And I think, Jason, that's the answer to your question before about trade Offs. What's one of the trade offs of our design? That noise. But yeah, I'm going to start the first part which is like, why would someone, why would a builder on Sol build a mage? Simply because there's a lot of stuff that's not possible on Solana. And they keep hearing only possible on Sol. Well, I'm going to say not possible on Sol right now.
00:43:35.465 - 00:44:34.423, Speaker B: Snap. Like that Mega. Like that VPN architecture I mentioned, right? That's this case in which fundamentally speaking, there's too much latency amongst all of those different like two, if there's what the latency for a block is so high, right? You can no longer work with hopping between different nodes in a network as a way of encryption and boom, that application can no longer exist on Solana. You're seeing a lot of really, really interesting Deepin products not be fully on chain or not even stream data or funding on chain in instantaneous manner because there's fundamental constraints of, of, of Solana. I think the best example would be a game show, right? Like let's say there is a worldwide game show and I'm not saying too much because I have a really cool team building this on Mega Eve, but this game show which has a, you know, Web2 level of success, has hundreds of thousands of users. They're playing this game and every single.
00:44:34.479 - 00:44:37.127, Speaker E: Let's say this is like a trivia HQ kind of game.
00:44:37.191 - 00:44:40.383, Speaker B: Yeah, imagine like an HQ of trivia.
00:44:40.559 - 00:44:41.247, Speaker E: HQ trivia.
00:44:41.271 - 00:45:19.753, Speaker B: Santi just, he just spoiled it to everybody. But yeah, so imagine an HQ trivia, right? This HQ trivia has, let's say, hundreds of thousands of users, which is accurate because that's HQ Trivia up to 2.4 million. If you want to be able to verify the winners of this HQ trivia game, well, you need to be streaming their answers on chain. Well, every four seconds, right? One of the trivia question is answered. If you have 100,000 people playing this game, that's 25,000 transactions per second. That's a level of scale that fundamentally no chain, no L1 Solana just cannot handle, right? Meg Eth can.
00:45:19.753 - 00:45:49.575, Speaker B: So I would say that's why people build stuff on Megaf because the design space is no longer constrained by the blockchain. I don't want people in five years to be like, yeah, or like in six years to be like, yeah, you know, Mega Eth. This app is a Mega Eth app. We should just abstract away the blockchain completely because normies do not care about what a stack looks like. They Just want to have brilliant, beautiful, web free experiences. I do hate the term web free. Anyways, Shu might touch on fragmentation.
00:45:50.315 - 00:46:13.985, Speaker A: I want to add something. Santi, you saw how Mega Mafia worked. I never think I'm selling blockchain to them. I don't think I'm selling block space. I think I'm selling a dream to every one of them. I often look at them in the eyes and I ask, what do you want to do for the next three years of your life? I don't know. You want to do a pump fun? I don't know.
00:46:13.985 - 00:46:41.081, Speaker A: V2, you want to launch a shitcoin and make some money or you want to do a billion dollar protocol and the only way to do a billion dollar protocol is in an environment that does not exist and build something that's truly zero to one. That is how we persuade and inspire the Mega Mafia builders. And a lot of people are scared by that vision. Right. And I'm sorry that you don't get into the mafia. The mafia is a cabal. It's a premium cabal.
00:46:41.081 - 00:47:19.929, Speaker A: So I think that's how we do ecosystem building that is so different from everyone else. I have a very contrarian take, which I'm very proud to say. I think most of the application builders are mid because they like to copy others and there's very much lack of independent thinking and contrarian thinking. We love to welcome builders who have a very strong view on certain use case and experiment the hell out of it. They could fail, but at least where they're iterating. So that's how I think about our ecosystem is different from others. And then in terms of the fragmentation, as I mentioned, everything is about quality over quantity.
00:47:19.929 - 00:47:55.805, Speaker A: It's fragmented because quality is low. We believe in a future where if Mega Eth is successful, we become a global state machine. Barring Solana's tagline where all the dapps are co living and co building and there's no noisy neighbor issue. We also believe that there is so much capital, efficiency and coordination you can explore when you are building on one single state machine. Now the fact you are saying, oh you know, layer 2s are fragmented, Solana is not. I would dare to challenge that. I've been seeing so many pitch deck on scaling Solana.
00:47:55.805 - 00:48:16.485, Speaker A: I do feel like Solana might face the same issue as Ethereum faced in the last cycle. Right? Like what is the correct scaling solution? I don't think we have the perfect blockchain right now, but I do think that Mega Eth solves fragmentation by providing a Much more powerful single state machine for every application to co build and co live on.
00:48:18.075 - 00:49:09.055, Speaker E: And oftentimes we've teased that this idea that an L2 eventually abandons Ethereum L1. What would you say to that? Or what is your view there? Like at what point does it a economically or just from a business development or from a sovereignty? However, there's multiple kind of parameters by which you can think about this. I'm not saying I agree or disagree. I just think that like DYDX may decide to just launch their own chain. And I'm curious if you, in a world where you have all these breakthrough apps, you have all this traction, does it at some point make sense to abandon Ethereum and just live as an independent chain?
00:49:09.565 - 00:49:26.165, Speaker B: So this is what I love the most about Mega Eve. This can also be seen as a trade off. Right, Jason, Another trade off of the Mega EVE architecture. We can't abandon Ethereum because we are fundamentally leveraging Ethereum to make these extreme design decisions and specialize our nodes to the extreme.
00:49:26.325 - 00:49:27.077, Speaker F: Right.
00:49:27.261 - 00:50:03.305, Speaker B: We can't. Just like our core value proposition, right. Is like centralizing block production and getting this level of performance. You can do something kind of like that on the L1, but then you're very, very centralized and the L1 cannot be centralized. That's why we're building on Ethereum. People ask me, why don't you build Mega Efon Sol? Why don't you build Mega Ef on like you know, some other L1? Well, the answer is because Mega Eth needs to exist on the most decentralized layer one so it can create the most performant execution environment. And yeah, that's why we all never abandon Ethereum because then Mega Eth doesn't work anymore.
00:50:03.335 - 00:50:03.693, Speaker A: More.
00:50:03.789 - 00:50:08.197, Speaker B: It's really as simple as that. That's why we're Ethereum aligned, guys. Mega aligned.
00:50:08.301 - 00:50:16.505, Speaker E: Yeah. If Keoni from Monad were here, what do you think you would say to that? Because obviously he's of a different opinion.
00:50:16.885 - 00:50:28.237, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think that Keoni from Monad and there will be a debate between Maggie and, you know, Monad on Bankless in the future. So tune in, that'll be quite exciting.
00:50:28.381 - 00:50:31.945, Speaker A: Don't advertise on that podcast. On a existing podcast.
00:50:32.815 - 00:50:34.755, Speaker D: You're booted. You're booted. That's.
00:50:36.815 - 00:50:43.055, Speaker B: We were doing so well. We were doing so well. Yeah, I mean I think our team internally thinks Monad's super cool.
00:50:43.175 - 00:50:43.455, Speaker F: Right.
00:50:43.495 - 00:50:50.807, Speaker B: Monad has done a lot of really fascinating optimizations onto yeah, both parallelization, but just across the stack.
00:50:50.871 - 00:50:51.407, Speaker F: Right.
00:50:51.551 - 00:51:09.481, Speaker B: And it looks cool. It looks great for now one but we're performance first and to create the most performing blockchain, you need to be doing what we're doing. At least that's our opinion. And yeah, it's really as simple as that. I think Monad's super cool as an L1. I don't know if Monad's gonna be more decentralized in Ethereum. I don't think so.
00:51:09.481 - 00:51:12.525, Speaker B: Maybe I'm wrong. I don't think I'm wrong, but maybe.
00:51:12.905 - 00:51:14.241, Speaker E: Probably not at the start.
00:51:14.393 - 00:51:18.125, Speaker B: Yeah. And then yeah, Ethereum is the most decentralized L1.
00:51:18.545 - 00:51:40.735, Speaker A: You know, I found it super interesting was there's a bunch of layer one. Right. And then they're like, oh, you know, we're really scalable. But what you're often seeing in the ecosystem was another layer one, another L2 for that layer one. So sometimes I scratch my head. It was like even before you're launching you're already thinking about L2. What's the point?
00:51:43.475 - 00:52:45.731, Speaker E: Yeah. Although to be fair, the L2 conversations in Ethereum started fairly early on. I mean, I guess you tried different. Yeah, for sure, for sure. Just sort of contextualizing what you just said. And so it's interesting this idea that like, because you don't hear it often, like most people when I ask this question, don't, don't say it to the level of conviction that you just did, which is we will to reiterate and we will never abandon the Ethereum L1 because we require that for settlement on the most secure settlement layer. And Insofar as Ethereum L1 remains the most decentralized I secure settlement layer, then we'll continue to use it.
00:52:45.731 - 00:53:21.399, Speaker E: And it's. But in that answer, I never heard anything about liquidity users network effects because most people would just say that oh, most of liquidity exists in Ethereum. That's where the attention is. But you're just saying purely from. In order for you guys to achieve that performance, you need to rely on a very stable settlement base called Ethereum L1 that you're posting back to. And that's how you get. And that's a necessary prerequisite to just focus on performance of sequencing and juice I.
00:53:21.447 - 00:53:34.359, Speaker B: So I think like the all the other reasons are the are reasons which would maybe that person who's on Ethereum solely for liquidity would then potentially leave Ethereum down the road once they get all that liquidity.
00:53:34.527 - 00:53:35.095, Speaker F: Right?
00:53:35.215 - 00:53:52.085, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's sick. There's the liquidity on Ethereum, it makes life easier in some way, shape or form, but from an architectural reason like we were on Ethereum because like Ethereum is the most decentralized blockchain and that enables us to do what we do really well.
00:53:52.545 - 00:53:57.685, Speaker D: Let's talk about. Yeah Roadmap mainnet, like rest of the year, like what's coming.
00:53:58.665 - 00:54:52.897, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the rest of the year are extremely exciting. We are very grateful to be on this podcast. Obviously one of our first appearance, we are giving up a testnet around end of September, early October mainnet early next year we are carrying our flagship builders program which is called Mega Mafia to the second phase. So the first phase which happened in Berlin, I don't have my Berlin shirt where we rented a hotel, a co working space, we got a bunch of really cool 0 to 1 application. So we're carrying that forward to Thailand where we're hosting a megazoo along with our friends from Eigenlayer and the goal is to bring more application builders to the Ethereum world. So if you have some ideas about what to build, if you still have that fire in your heart.
00:54:52.897 - 00:55:31.923, Speaker A: If you're listening to this podcast, you're looking for an ecosystem but also fellow builders to challenge yourself, please come to talk to us. We are looking for you to join us in the Thailand trip. We are also gearing up to make sure our middlewares work. Our data indexing is indexing pretty nicely for now, our RPC providers as well. We're looking at how to provide a much better wallet experiences because Mega is so fast. If our wallet is not fast, what's the fucking point? So making sure that those are in the right place. And then lastly we are thinking about how to go to market with the Mega Mafia.
00:55:31.923 - 00:56:00.515, Speaker A: So remember we're taking a very curated approach with our ecosystem. Rather than welcoming everyone, we are doubling down on team that is truly zero to one. So when we're going live with our testnet, we're working with the mafia projects on how to make sure they get liquidity, how to make sure they get users, how to make sure they get eyeballs. So that is a big focus because I don't want people to remember Megaist, I want people to remember Mega Mafia.
00:56:01.415 - 00:56:05.475, Speaker B: Mega if there's nothing about the Mega Mafia. So come join the Mega family.
00:56:08.455 - 00:56:59.705, Speaker E: For someone listening tell us maybe non described like you don't have to go into much detail. I know we spend a little bit of time but like what does that builder look like? Because a lot of the guys, a lot of the teams that I met, had been in the space for quite a bit of time. I had the feeling that they had been thinking about specific problems and finally kind of decided to pull the trigger. For instance, the Valhalla guys, you know, they'd been doing a lot of research on defi. They've been doing a lot of research on different. Other observing other protocols and had. I got the feeling they'd been very thoughtful around how to, how to build what they're building and then they pull the trigger when they perhaps heard the pitch from either one of you guys.
00:56:59.705 - 00:57:47.665, Speaker E: The same is true for other teams that I've interacted with. But I'm, I'm curious. Yeah. What are there specific, specific applications that you would like to see that haven't been, that are currently not being built? Are there ideas that you have kind of like an rfq live rfq? Yeah, I can go like, like obviously like, like prediction markets, for instance. Everyone and their mother wants to build a prediction market now. I was like, okay, well does that, is that really truly differentiated? But I am curious how much, I guess, I guess how much. Guy, how much is.
00:57:47.665 - 00:58:10.365, Speaker E: This is a question. How much has it been you guys putting out a proposal saying, here's this new thing that allows you to build applications that perhaps have been possible before because of the speed, the performance, or people just hearing about Mega and saying, oh shit, I've had this idea, it couldn't have worked anywhere else. And I'm going to come here and you're like, yes.
00:58:12.785 - 00:58:28.557, Speaker A: Great question. It really varies. Our builders program is growing bigger. The family is growing stronger. So Valhalla is a fully on chain per decks only possible on Mega East. The team is seasoned crypto builders. We didn't know them.
00:58:28.557 - 00:58:51.123, Speaker A: The guy DM me on Twitter because during token 2049, the mega east swag is a vape. So Mega is branded vape. So guy was like, yo, dude, what are you guys distributing the vape? I was like, yo, come find me. I was hanging out with Jason from Folios Venture. So he came and we talked. He's like, yeah, your tech is sick. Should we build? And then we start building together.
00:58:51.123 - 00:59:37.753, Speaker A: So he came from a background where he knew he wants to build something. He did diligence on our technology, talked to my co founder Lei, and boom, we're here, right? Other teams are not so straightforward. For example, our social application. The idea is actually, I think that idea came from one of our friends and Namek and the founder took it a step forward. There is a lot of complexity in designing Tokenomics and the founder came from Web2. He single handedly built a Web2 social application that is about reality shifting. So think about us in a crypto universe and we pretend to be satoshi and there's a fake Instagram timeline there, right? And then the builder came to my hot pile dao and wanted to build something for NFT community.
00:59:37.753 - 01:00:11.013, Speaker A: And I told him, dude, don't want to crash your dream. That shit isn't going to work because NFT communities are not real communities sometimes. So he's like, okay, what should I build? And then me and Namik was like, yo, what about this idea with HQ trivia? So we were more heavily involved. We gave him the idea, we were designing the crypto economics together. But that guy is obsessive with product development and product iteration. Right. He often joked with me like he's a people pleaser, that translates into a customer pleasing.
01:00:11.013 - 01:00:40.533, Speaker A: So he really enjoys the process, making sure the product actually works with the end user and we come in as adding the web3 value. So I think these are the two extreme example of an extremely crypto native team comes in, know what they want to Build, and a Web2 founder who's also very legit but doesn't know what to do. And that we came in and in the middle we have different grades of founders who's somewhat more crypto native, but we kind of tell them like, oh, this idea is good. That is not good. Namik, what do you want to add?
01:00:40.709 - 01:00:46.225, Speaker B: I mean, I think we believe in, I think we really believe in like Web2 excellence.
01:00:46.645 - 01:00:47.029, Speaker F: Right.
01:00:47.077 - 01:01:00.957, Speaker B: I think it's something that we're lacking as an industry. That person that Xiao mentioned, ex Amazon Google engineer and his Reality Shifting app had a million downloads and 100,000 monthly active users.
01:01:01.141 - 01:01:01.725, Speaker F: Right?
01:01:01.845 - 01:01:17.413, Speaker B: This is the kind of caliber of builder that when you're able to tell them that the blockchain no longer has a performance degradation trade off, you're able to attract. So yeah, I think like our guiding principle for builders are like how cracked are you?
01:01:17.469 - 01:01:17.757, Speaker F: Right?
01:01:17.821 - 01:01:19.941, Speaker B: Like do you have the dog in you?
01:01:20.013 - 01:01:20.429, Speaker F: Yes.
01:01:20.517 - 01:01:40.109, Speaker B: Awesome. Let's start ideating. Exactly. Let's start ideating on ideas. And some of them we might be more involved in, some we might not be involved in. But we think it's actually very important to make sure that people don't feel disillusioned because that is the main issue I'm seeing of crypto builders right now. They're disillusioned.
01:01:40.109 - 01:02:24.939, Speaker B: They think that the only thing they can build now is some sort of like I mean, for example, during the Trump and you know, Trump had this Twitter space of Elon. I saw somebody was launching meme coins of like big buzzwords and then just rugging them straight away during that Twitter space I said he made like 150 grand or something. And I believe it. Like, that's insane. The fundamental values in the industry are skewing way too much towards gambling because we haven't been able to prove PMF for anything else with Maggie. If we can build the ideas that people first came into space for. And it's a role of myself and Shreya to help people, you know, think bigger than they may be doing now.
01:02:24.939 - 01:02:35.203, Speaker B: So what does the profile look like? Yeah, you can have like this insane Web2 founders. You can have Web2 employees who are crypto curious. You can have seasoned crypto bros.
01:02:35.259 - 01:02:35.907, Speaker F: Right?
01:02:36.091 - 01:02:51.959, Speaker B: Hopefully they're not super bro y but like, you know, we can have crypto people. But what I find most interesting is like, you never know where these founders can come from. They may not have been founder material at first. They may have been an employee in a crypto org. They may have been running a highly profitable mev trading firm. Firm.
01:02:52.087 - 01:02:52.831, Speaker F: Right.
01:02:53.023 - 01:03:06.675, Speaker B: Who knows where they come from? But when that moment clicks and they realize that they can build that dream of theirs, right. That's when me and SH come in to make sure that we can ideate this space together. We're very founder first.
01:03:08.255 - 01:03:13.767, Speaker E: Yeah. So Mainnet, go ahead.
01:03:13.951 - 01:03:34.255, Speaker A: Now to answer your question, the use case, you know, everyone's prediction market. We're very consumer driven because our chain is fast. Um, and to be honest, once you get the right founder, it doesn't matter the idea. So please come talk to us even if you have no idea. You just want to build something and then we can give you the ideas. We can idea together.
01:03:35.755 - 01:03:37.147, Speaker E: Yeah. Heck, I'm not.
01:03:37.251 - 01:03:53.945, Speaker D: How. How do you guys think about picking winners? Like, it seems like Monad. Monad is purposefully not king making and not picking winners. So there could be like 5 dexes that launch on Monad. And I've noticed just watching their marketing, they're purposefully not trying to king make. How do you think about king making?
01:03:57.925 - 01:04:01.781, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's totally fine if you find really good talent.
01:04:01.853 - 01:04:02.465, Speaker F: Right?
01:04:02.845 - 01:04:33.435, Speaker B: We have a. We have a talent issue in crypto. Like, there's a massive skill issue. If you find people who are really, really good, why should they be building the same idea? There's an unlimited amount of ideas. We're founder first and then we can make a founder we make sure that that founder succeeds and we ideate with them on what they can build. I don't understand who wins by having 15 clubs on a chain as long as the person who's building the club is doing a good job building it.
01:04:35.255 - 01:04:57.649, Speaker E: Yeah, we've been at it for an hour, guys. What? And I appreciate the time. Maybe. Actually, I'm curious about two things. Maybe as a, as a breather. One, Brother Bing, please explain. And then, and then, and then hot pot, though.
01:04:57.817 - 01:05:14.985, Speaker A: Oh, there's no explanation. I love you. Oh, okay. So I was. So in 2020, there were a bunch of defi founders, you know, who are. Do psyop. Sing as girls on Twitter.
01:05:14.985 - 01:05:21.105, Speaker A: And then I was like, yo, why can't I just psyops as a dude as a girl. So that was.
01:05:21.925 - 01:05:49.005, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't get too woke in this pod. You know how I stand on that wokeness thing. But do you think that we have a gender issue like, you know, founders or just the culture wise? It's mostly skewed towards males may because, you know, you know, it's more of, to name point, you know, a very gambling type environment. Have you ever felt or what can we do about it?
01:05:49.945 - 01:06:11.485, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the issue is just the same in traditional web2tech, to be honest. I don't know if it's probably better than AI. Who knows? In fact, sometimes I notice myself going on a call with more women than the man. What I think, I don't think is a racial issue. I think women should be more vocal.
01:06:12.105 - 01:06:13.145, Speaker B: About where they are.
01:06:13.185 - 01:06:17.525, Speaker A: But again, that's just inspiration empowerment issue than anything else.
01:06:18.345 - 01:06:20.805, Speaker E: Yeah. Amen. Hot pot.
01:06:21.625 - 01:06:28.009, Speaker A: All about hot dog. Yeah. So I really hate crypto network. Like I hate going into.
01:06:28.057 - 01:06:30.585, Speaker E: You mean. You mean conferences, conferences?
01:06:30.665 - 01:06:32.325, Speaker A: Yeah, I hate going to an event.
01:06:32.655 - 01:06:37.591, Speaker E: Like deciding yada's like double blow. Here we're having them go on.
01:06:37.623 - 01:06:42.687, Speaker D: You reference Bankless, plug in Bankless and then brother Bing saying she hates conferences.
01:06:42.791 - 01:06:46.175, Speaker E: This is. This is why I like the team. They're not afraid to speak their mind.
01:06:46.295 - 01:06:47.515, Speaker D: For me on this podcast.
01:06:50.415 - 01:06:51.151, Speaker A: So. Yeah.
01:06:51.263 - 01:06:53.495, Speaker E: So you hate. You hate networking and stuff?
01:06:53.655 - 01:07:20.775, Speaker A: Yeah, I hate networking. If I go in trying to make small talk because frankly, I just don't remember you. You're one of the 80 bros I've talked to. So an ideal event to get to know people is always food. Then I started hot pot out in 2020 during IMCON, which is a DAO conference. And a bunch of us just went to hot pot restaurant and hang out. Then I just thought, why don't we just do this more often? And also because I love hotpot.
01:07:20.775 - 01:07:35.245, Speaker A: And then four years later, it has grown to be the only DAO that has product market fit in the entire crypto space because people actually pay to come to eat. And every time I get like, more people want to sponsor than I believe it.
01:07:36.105 - 01:07:44.885, Speaker E: That's true. Last question for me. Favorite hot pot restaurant that you've been. You've been at.
01:07:45.545 - 01:07:58.785, Speaker A: So there is a place in Dubai. It's called Night Square. The beautiful part of it, it has a rooftop so you can eat hot pot while watching the Dubai skyline. It's quite surreal.
01:08:00.005 - 01:08:14.025, Speaker E: Nice. We'll have to go check it out. I know for. Well, now that we're in the conferences thing, I know you guys do the circuit. You know you're going out and where are you next? Where can people meet you in person?
01:08:15.205 - 01:08:31.624, Speaker A: Yep. So I'm in San Francisco for the next two weeks. NAMIC is in New York. We will have a small appearance during current Blockchain Week, a small appearance during token 2049. And then we'll also be there for Solana Breakpoint.
01:08:32.484 - 01:08:36.944, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll be. We'll be having a bigger appearance there. So that's exciting.
01:08:37.804 - 01:08:57.795, Speaker E: Very good. Well, guys, this one treat. I mean, obviously I've had the benefit of knowing you guys and I wanted for both of you to come on and share the story. Thank you for taking the time as maybe. Any parting thoughts or just maybe where is the best way to interact with you guys on socials or discord or what have you?
01:08:58.335 - 01:09:31.015, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I think what I really want to send our message is crypto has been here for so many years. We really do have an adoption issue. And now that Mega Eth solve the basic layer, the base layer problem, we don't have any excuse not to build anything. And I want people to rekindle the original fire in their heart when they were like, oh, my God, there's something about crypto. I can do something here to change the world. And if you still have that fire, come talk to us. We're here to support you in every single stage.
01:09:32.115 - 01:09:38.655, Speaker B: We don't have a lot of time. I honestly think that crypto Bitcoin's PMF is downside protection.
01:09:39.035 - 01:09:39.419, Speaker F: Right.
01:09:39.467 - 01:09:53.734, Speaker B: For the world and Ethereum and Solana and the power of the smart contract is meant to show unbounded creativity to make the world much, much better. But we haven't found a lot of PMF yet.
01:09:53.894 - 01:09:54.214, Speaker F: Right.
01:09:54.254 - 01:09:58.918, Speaker B: That initial mission has not been solved. I don't think we have A lot of time to solve it.
01:09:59.086 - 01:09:59.822, Speaker F: Right.
01:09:59.998 - 01:10:25.795, Speaker B: Every single year we have more and more brain drain. Every single time we have like the we didn't. It's not good for any of us. When the article on Bloomberg about crypto is about like Iggy Glaciers's meme coin and not some peer to peer network that's like making the world a better place. I don't think we have a lot of time. If you feel the same way and you're ready to build like real time apps, please do reach out because we've got to make Ethereum great again. I'm not even that.
01:10:25.795 - 01:10:32.555, Speaker B: Should we get rid of that part? I don't want to get hit by a bunch of Trump supporters or even worse Democrats.
01:10:34.855 - 01:10:39.459, Speaker E: I mean I'm wearing the hat sir. So there's nothing, there's no way around it. That's the name of your company.
01:10:39.487 - 01:10:39.867, Speaker B: Company.
01:10:39.971 - 01:11:45.775, Speaker E: I'll embrace it. Let's I, I, I, I, I respect that and I, you know it's, it's. You don't hear it often but this sense of urgency I think we found have found product market fit unfortunately on certain things like stablecoins and and but unfortunately the headlines and this is what media companies not bankless of course sorry not quirks. Wow. Jana's about to go and we'll cut that out But I think media companies report obviously the bad right the meme coins, all that phenomenon. But I do hear your sense of urgency and I think I always go back to Uber as in a prime example of something that was really had to it was such a killer product that it overcame all kinds of resistance at the local level, lobby level, taxis, organizations. It was just because the consumer loved it and I think we haven't really figured that out for crypto yet but we'll get there.
01:11:45.775 - 01:12:08.565, Speaker E: I would hope that in the next five years there's a particular product that you walk on the streets and people are using it and they're loving it and maybe they don't even talk about it. This is a crypto thing but they love it and they can't live without it and what you know brother Bing, I mean you lived in Africa. I think like stablecoins are pretty killer.
01:12:09.025 - 01:12:36.705, Speaker A: 100% yeah. We also have an internal thesis where the mega eth real time applications bring more emotional value to users than financial value. So every single application on us is like people need to love going play HQ trivia and you know what what is on a you know fully entry Minecraft what does it really mean and money token is a small part of it, but you got to love being. Interacting with the blockchain.
01:12:37.485 - 01:12:45.285, Speaker B: Yeah, I will also, I will make note, Santi. Like, I. I think stablecoins are a massive use case. Right back. I grew up, I'm Turkish Cypriot.
01:12:45.325 - 01:12:45.549, Speaker F: Right.
01:12:45.597 - 01:12:54.135, Speaker B: Like only one country in the world recognizes it. It's Turkey. Not both. Not great. But I would say stablecoins are also primarily downside protection.
01:12:54.325 - 01:12:54.675, Speaker F: Right.
01:12:54.715 - 01:13:08.539, Speaker B: Which is saying like, I do not want to be holding the native currency of my own country. I do not trust the sovereign or whoever's in charge of my nation to let me have my. The money in my bank. So I'm going to hold it in USD on my wallet.
01:13:08.667 - 01:13:09.155, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:13:09.235 - 01:13:14.015, Speaker B: So I mean, I love stable coins, but I. Yeah, that's. That's also what I think.
01:13:14.315 - 01:13:39.489, Speaker E: Yeah, your point is a really good one. And this is the last comment, which is most people don't think about finance on a daily basis. Most people don't check their think about their bank accounts. They don't rave about bank of America or JP Morgan. It's sort of like they don't like to do it. It's sort of like they'd rather it's meant to be invisible. And in the background here in crypto we have that on the, on the front seat and it's the first thing that you see and just, just the nature of the beast.
01:13:39.489 - 01:13:58.723, Speaker E: Right. Because you hear these crazy stories of, you know, it's. It is a land of opportunity. And you know, like every major technological revolution has had this initial, like very heavy speculative phase. And I'm not worried about it. I do think that we oughta. We will and we will figure out and we will bit.
01:13:58.723 - 01:14:29.445, Speaker E: We will. We will build killer consumer applications. A lot of it has just been building the foundations to allow that to happen. So I would challenge like this whole idea that like infra is figured out by no way, shape or form. Like it's very, very hard to build decentralized systems that are performant. We're finally seeing glimpses of that and anyone that like doesn't agree with that, I don't think properly understands like the complexity that goes behind building that. But it's worth it.
01:14:29.445 - 01:14:59.259, Speaker E: It's worth it. And I think we'll probably see a faster development and rate of iteration and adoption for now that we're entering this application phase and hopefully it happens in a place like mega. So awesome guys. Well, thank you again for taking the time. Really appreciate it. And hopefully our listeners found it really useful. Best way to interact with you guys Discord Twitter other than local events Discord.
01:14:59.387 - 01:15:04.773, Speaker A: My Twitter account hotpot underscore dao very.
01:15:04.789 - 01:15:12.085, Speaker B: Well minus just my first and last name on Google I guess on Twitter. Yeah I'm very basic guy. So excited.
01:15:12.205 - 01:15:17.677, Speaker E: We'll link that in the show notes but awesome guys. Well, thank you so much for taking the time. We really appreciate the conversation.
01:15:17.861 - 01:15:19.705, Speaker A: Thank you guys for having us.
