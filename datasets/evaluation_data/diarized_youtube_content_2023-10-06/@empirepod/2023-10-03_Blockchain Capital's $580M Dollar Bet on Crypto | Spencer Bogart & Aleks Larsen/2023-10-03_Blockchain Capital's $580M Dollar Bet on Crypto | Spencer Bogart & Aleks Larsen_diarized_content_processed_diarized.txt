00:00:00.200 - 00:00:38.384, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to Bumper, a new DeFi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Go check out bumper. It's bumper five. Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. Hey, everyone, before we get into today's episode, I want to take a second to acknowledge vouch. With over 4000 startups insured from napkin sketch ideas to large ipos, Vouch is the insurer of choice for crypto companies, including l one s, l two s, dows protocols, and a whole lot more.
00:00:38.384 - 00:01:05.648, Speaker A: Their exclusive coverages are enhanced for crypto, covering everything from regulatory defense to smart contract vulnerabilities. With vouch, you are not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind so you can keep on building. You'll hear more about vouch later in the show. Welcome back to another episode of Empire. As promised, we got the blockchain cap folks on the pod. We have spent Spencer and Alex GPS at blockchain cap. Spencer, Alex, welcome to the show.
00:01:05.776 - 00:01:06.924, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:01:07.304 - 00:01:08.048, Speaker C: Great to be on.
00:01:08.096 - 00:01:24.792, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pumped to have you guys here. All right, lot to talk about. Um, you guys just raised 580,000,002 different funds. Haven't seen a fundraise like that in a long time. It's also ten year anniversary of the fund. I think that makes you guys one of the, maybe the longest running crypto fund.
00:01:24.792 - 00:01:43.894, Speaker A: Spencer, I'll throw it to you. Can you just tell us? I'm going to pick into this fundraise a bunch and just want to know as much as possible about this raise, because it's a colossal amount of capital in this market. Two years into the bear market. Tell us everything that we should know about this fundraise, how long you've been raising, who you raise from as much detail as you can.
00:01:44.714 - 00:02:47.964, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's see, I suppose probably what helps explain the ability to kind of raise that amount of capital in this market environment is really probably how institutional in nature the LP base is, right? So historically, allocators to crypto venture funds are pretty much going to be maybe some family offices and high net worths, right. It's been very fortunate that over the past, let's see, almost six years now, we've kind of been building up a larger and larger base of institutional clients. And so that just means pensions and endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and then also strategic partners. So we're fortunate to count folks like PayPal and Visa, strategic partners and in general, the nice thing about having this kind of those large institutional allocators, they tend to be very consistent. As long as you're maintaining the relationship with them, you're putting up the performance that they want to see. They're typically going to keep investing from one fund to another, regardless of market cycle.
00:02:47.964 - 00:03:18.204, Speaker B: And a lot of these LP's have been with us through multiple market cycles, so they're already a little bit numb to it in the same way that we are. They're like, oh, great, so you're telling me that there's a dearth of capital in the industry and you guys are going to deploy into that, like, great, sign me up. That's going to be a great vintage. So that's probably like, what explains being able to pull in 580 million total. Of course, that's across two funds in the depths of a crypto winter and bear market here.
00:03:18.504 - 00:03:22.964, Speaker D: What was your target for that fund, out of curiosity? Was it a billion? Was it 600 or.
00:03:23.394 - 00:03:49.734, Speaker B: It's actually almost exactly at the target. So there's two different funds. So we have our 6th early stage fund. That's what we've been doing for the past decade. This is our bread and butter early stage seed series a, equity tokens, the whole gamut there. That one, we had a target of 400 and it came in at 380. And then we have an opportunity fund.
00:03:49.734 - 00:04:13.314, Speaker B: This is series b. And later we had a target of 200 and it came in at exactly 200. For both of those, they were very, very close to their targets. When we originally started thinking about those target sizes, it was not as brutal of a crypto winter. I'm not going to pretend like it was really easy, but again, we're fortunate to have the LP base that we do that sticks with us.
00:04:13.734 - 00:04:34.574, Speaker D: Was it a big overlap? It was just rolling funds from a prior vintage that they capitalized, crystallized on, and they just rolled out some of the gains into this new fund. What is the overlap like? What is the composition of that LP basis at 100% repeat? Or how much of that is new?
00:04:35.434 - 00:05:02.584, Speaker B: It's a good question. I'd actually have to pull the numbers to be 100% certain, but we can do some math here. Our last early stage fund was 300 million in size, and so we're looking at about 600 total across them. So even if we rolled everybody with the exact same commitments, that only be half of it. Now, in this case, I think pretty much everybody rolled over into the new fund. A lot of them upsized into it. But then we also added in some new lp's into the mix as well.
00:05:03.924 - 00:05:25.994, Speaker A: Was there any thought about raising too much capital? You've seen maybe someone like some of the biggest funds, it becomes really difficult to deploy that much capital into crypto. There are folks like maybe benchmark who I think it's benchmark. They cap their funds at 350 somewhere around there. Was there any conversation about, like, is this too much capital to deploy into crypto at this point?
00:05:27.254 - 00:06:10.392, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, we definitely talked about it a lot. I mean, the fact is, crypto is a pretty immature technology overall. It's been around for a relatively short amount of time, and I'm constantly amazed at how many interesting types of applications and use cases have been developed so far. But at the end of the day, we're still exploring a lot of the white space here. And the opportunity set isn't in the, I'd say many tens of billions right now, like the capital you saw get raised over the last couple of years. And so when thinking about it, in our last fund, which was 300 million, we felt under capitalized. And so we knew that we were going to go higher than that.
00:06:10.392 - 00:06:26.644, Speaker C: But thinking about a billion plus started to make that math really difficult. We want to be able to participate at the earliest stages and have that be meaningful at the fund level. And so we found a nice middle ground that I think is, in our view, appropriate for the stage of the market right now and the opportunity set that we're seeing.
00:06:27.064 - 00:06:27.448, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:27.496 - 00:06:53.844, Speaker D: And so from a structure standpoint, there are funds that have raised like a billion dollars, but it's not all called capital because maybe 1020 percent of that's been called. You guys are structured purely as a venture fund. So you're not calling that 500 plus out of the gate. You're saying, hey, we're going to deploy this over three to five year period and then harvest that towards the tail end. Is that accurate?
00:06:55.064 - 00:07:28.226, Speaker B: 100% accurate. The other thing about the way that we've thought about fund growth a lot is there is this inherent attraction for all asset managers to manage more capital. That's their business. But we've always had this perspective that we need to stay aligned with our LP's, which means that the fund sizes need to be relatively constrained so that we're oriented towards performance. We need to deliver performance for them. And that's the only way the business is going to be enduring across the next two decades. And for us, the way that we try and translate that is going from one fund to the next.
00:07:28.226 - 00:07:39.944, Speaker B: We need to grow it at a rate slower than the growth and the opportunity set in the industry, and as long as we do that, we're not going to be saturating the market and we're not going to be diluting the returns for our limited partners.
00:07:40.104 - 00:08:20.102, Speaker D: Yeah, a lot of times, I mean, back in my days and paraphy just talking to LP's, a lot of what they granted it was structured as a hedge fund. We would go out to market like, not constantly. There would be windows. And I remember one of the things that LP's looked at a lot was you told us you were going to do x. You did, yeah. In terms of the strategy and in crypto, as you said, alex, look at the design space, the opportunity set is ever evolving and how much of your LP's were looking at that. Was there a recurring set of questions where they like, hey, look, we love what you did here, but we didn't like you went this way and we didn't like it.
00:08:20.102 - 00:08:45.114, Speaker D: And was there something like that that ended up hurting you, quote unquote? Obviously you were successful in raising what you wanted, but I'm curious if there are some lP's that have been with you for a long time that just said, hey, look, not anymore, we just were out. And was it because of the industry regulation, risk, or just you as managers, stewards of capital? I'm curious how you think if there's something there that you can give us.
00:08:45.414 - 00:09:19.334, Speaker C: Not really. I think we've done a pretty good job of being consistent. And part of that is having been doing this for a decade now, been investing through all the major cycles in crypto, and I think have refined a strategy that at this point is fairly stable and we're not seeing a new fad and jumping on that and moving the entire ship in a different direction. We're, I would say, pretty steady. And our partners on the LP side, I think, have come to expect that and we haven't really deviated from it much.
00:09:21.574 - 00:10:17.130, Speaker B: And I think so much of life in general, I guess, is expectations management. And that's a lot of what we've worked on with our limited partners of like, here's what you should expect from us, and we want to be constrained enough where they understand what they're getting into, but not so constrained that we nicheify ourselves. It's amazing to me. It's funny, when we were raising four funds ago, one of the main major pushbacks we'd get from limited partners was, I don't know, the industry just seems really small. It's too niche, which is funny now because sometimes prospective limited partners ask us. Why don't you guys just focus on, just do DeFi or just do infrastructure and say, listen, I don't think that makes sense for where we're at because the ability to cover the various subsectors of our industry is to the benefit of our LP's. And so we guide that into the expectations that we are going to go across the industry and some of the investments, they're going to look different than what you're expecting.
00:10:17.130 - 00:10:47.526, Speaker B: And the reason why you're coming to us is to deploy this capital on your behalf, and that's what we are going to do. Now, there's a very delicate balance there of both respecting the guidance and input from your limited partners and letting them steer the shit. That dynamic is actually the exact same as we have as investors and the founders that we back. We want to be there as a sounding board. We want to set expectations with them, but we're not going to step in and call operating shots for them. We backed them to make those calls. They're the ones in the trenches every day.
00:10:47.526 - 00:11:03.390, Speaker B: They're the ones looking at the data, they're the ones talking to clients. So it's their decision to make and we're here to help them think through it and pull it out of them, but never to overrule them. And so we try and mimic that relationship with our limited partners of like, listen, you're going to see us do.
00:11:03.422 - 00:11:05.038, Speaker C: Some stuff that seems off the wall.
00:11:05.166 - 00:11:19.840, Speaker B: Because crypto is going to be a little bit off the wall. It's not just going to be putting your mortgage on the blockchain. You're going to see some crypto things that you've never seen before. And you should be excited about that because that's going to be. I think that's going to be the lion's share of the opportunity.
00:11:19.992 - 00:12:06.524, Speaker D: Yeah. Of course, we're not supposed to talk about returns, but I think the biggest point here is, are you outperforming bitcoin and ETH? And of course, some funds, because of their size or because of the market, just go back to bitcoin and ETH and just holding the benchmark. And in the absence of an ETF, that's kind of, I guess lP's are fine with that because they don't want to do it themselves. I am curious, as you think about you've raised the fund, now you can call the capital. The opportunity set is interesting. A lot of the kind of open question now is the relative opportunity between holding bitcoin, holding ETH, versus doing your series a or pre seed. I'm curious how you think about that and how you think about deploying this capital that you've raised.
00:12:08.704 - 00:12:55.950, Speaker C: Yes, I think over the past ten years, it's been very difficult, if not impossible, to outperform bitcoin and ETH, depending, of course, on when you enter the market looking forward. These are large market cap assets at this point. They don't move at the same rates that they used to, at least with respect to the prices now. And so we think that that starts to change. These are obviously really strong benchmarks to have. And in our thinking, when we look at underwriting and opportunity, it's certainly something that we consider, like, does this have the potential to outperform ETH in particular as it relates to like, an Ethereum based protocol or application? I think is perhaps the most relevant question that you should be asking when you're looking at underwriting something. And so that's our goal.
00:12:55.950 - 00:13:13.714, Speaker C: I mean, we're absolutely here to outperform Ethereum and bitcoin from here. And I think based on where those assets are at today, we have a much better chance of doing that, especially with the quality of the founders that we've seen end of the space over the last two to three years.
00:13:14.734 - 00:13:50.744, Speaker A: Spencer, I noticed in your fundraise announcement, a lot of the things you pointed to, there weren't NFT data, it wasn't gaming metrics. I actually think you put it very eloquently, is like in the depths of a crypto winner. You said 6 trillion in stablecoin volume, 700 million of DeFi protocol revenue, 700 billion of Dex volume, and 3 billion of outstanding loans across the two largest lending protocols. Feels very. And then you had other stats as well. Feels very DeFi focused to me. Is that the thesis moving forward or is that almost the pitch that you made to LP's in the room, they got excited about DeFi, maybe gaming, and NFTs fell flat.
00:13:50.744 - 00:13:53.924, Speaker A: Why was this kind of the thing that you honed in on?
00:13:55.784 - 00:14:29.574, Speaker B: Honestly, just my personal interest. Right. You just did a good job laying out the numbers there, and I think actually pulled just across chains for the stablecoin volume. I think it's like 7.58 trillion over the past year of volume, 6 trillion on Ethereum alone. So I pulled it up after I put out that tweet or that press release. But for one hell of product, product market fit right there, right in the depths of a crypto winter, like seven and a half trillion of stablecoin volume, 700 billion of Dex volume, 700 million of protocol revenue.
00:14:29.574 - 00:14:31.622, Speaker B: Like that's product market fit right there.
00:14:31.718 - 00:14:37.046, Speaker D: And I think that, Spencer, hold on. So many people are questioning that crypto doesn't have product market fit. What are you talking about?
00:14:37.110 - 00:15:21.964, Speaker B: I know, I know. It's absurd, right? Like, these numbers are objectively, like, massive, right? And this is when people are still writing it off. Like people are not even paying attention right now, and you're putting up those kind of numbers. And the reason why I'm focusing on DeFi is because from the outset, we have had the thesis that DeFi would be the thing that works first and that we think that blockchain technology, crypto, can be applied across many different subsectors, but sequencing matters of when those things are going to hit. This whole industry was born out of bitcoin as a financial asset, and the bitcoin network is a financial network. So it has always intuitively made sense to us that the first vertical you're going to see impacted is going to be financial services, financial products. It's no surprise.
00:15:21.964 - 00:15:47.944, Speaker B: And I think what's happening in Defi matters for all of the other subsectors. Let's take the gaming use cases. Let's take the consumer, the social, all of those. The basic primitives are financial in nature. It's ownership, it's transactions, it's the ability to exchange. All of it kind of comes from Defi. So, like, that's what I'm watching as the canary in the coal mine to understand, like, what else might work in other places.
00:15:51.844 - 00:16:25.254, Speaker D: Yeah. In terms of, you know, how you think about, you know, the sequence of Defi getting off the ground. I mean, you could have, you could look at any sort of legacy defi protocol relative to ETH, and it's grossly underperforming even before rates started moving. Now you think about catalysts. You could see that as a great opportunity. Now, when you look at fundamentally, there's protocols out there that are trading at distress PE multiples. You walk around Silicon Valley, you talk to venture capitalists, tell them, hey, this is an early stage company growing 100% plus year over year.
00:16:25.254 - 00:16:56.434, Speaker D: You could argue the addressable market is fin. You could say it's fintech, and you tell them it's profitable, they'll hand over fist. And even in this environment, give you a check. Instacart is not even profitable. They go in public at multiple billions of dollars, and these protocols are not. How do you think about the timing of youre a venture fund? You have to at some point return capital to your investors. How much of timing and catalysts and your horizon for how this tech is going to actually live up to its promise and acquire users.
00:16:56.434 - 00:17:17.480, Speaker D: Its tough because as you said Alex, were a decade in and we have ten users in defi. It's great tech, ten users. So how do you think about, like, is this the next decade? Is this fun where we see millions of users in crypto? Like, because timing is everything in many ways.
00:17:17.632 - 00:17:17.920, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:17.952 - 00:18:10.742, Speaker C: I mean, I think, you know, DeFi was born in an environment where the infrastructure wasn't ready to accommodate mainstream usage, right? Like ETH got bloated really quickly, transaction fees were through the roof. The DeFi thesis at its core, I think is powerful. And to your point, these are massive markets that DeFi is going after, just like bitcoin is going after a massive market and stable coins go after massive markets in general. I mean, that's one of the most exciting things about crypto. Like, you would expect a new technology maybe to go for like niche use cases initially, but crypto goes straight for the juggernauts. With DeFi, specifically, global permissionless financial services are, I think, at a very fundamental level, better suited to serve the Internet economy and will grow with it. And so that's kind of at its core, our thesis in terms of timing.
00:18:10.742 - 00:18:52.826, Speaker C: You're not a daily active user of a mortgage. I forget who gave that quote originally, but I liked it a lot. And so the user numbers for Defi, certainly we couldn't expect to look like a game, for instance. But the amount of capital that the system has amassed, I would say is quite impressive. The volumes have been very impressive, too. And then we got to a point where retail was a major driving part of that, and then started to get caught in basically unsustainable transaction fee environment, which I think really put a damper on adoption at a time when the attention and the spotlight was all over Defi. I think there's a couple of things happening there.
00:18:52.826 - 00:19:36.344, Speaker C: One, the infrastructure simply wasn't ready for DeFi. We're getting there now. I think in the life of these funds, we're going to have infrastructure that's high performance, that's cheap to use, that's secure, and we've seen a lot of progress on that front. So today, the things that are possible to build in the DeFi realm are much more accessible to people around the world than things were three or four years ago. The other thing that's been, I think, holding DeFi back, and this is still where we don't have clarity, is on the regulatory side. There is no clear path for a DeFi founder to scale their applications or products to users in particular in the United States. And so in some sense, innovation in that space has been paused.
00:19:36.344 - 00:20:22.828, Speaker C: We're still seeing interesting things. But to me, really, the zero to one events in DeFi mostly already happened. I'm open to there being new innovation leaps there. DeFi amms like dexs that are open and lending pools were the really powerful core primitives that power DeFi today. And we saw a huge amount of, let's say one to n innovations on those where you tweak the amm a little bit and try and get a more optimal trade route. And we haven't seen a lot of those really be powerful enough to get people excited. So what I think we're waiting on here is this next leg of users.
00:20:22.828 - 00:21:05.884, Speaker C: Defi is kind of, I mean, like financial services generally, I think the power users of those tend to be institutional. In particular. When you think about the next leg of innovation, defi derivatives comes to mind for me, and these are not really retail products. These are products for sophisticated users of financial tools. And so you, a lot of this really, I think, comes down to how fast institutions can get comfortable using this new financial infrastructure so it bleeds into tokenized markets. We're seeing, I think, some pretty exciting developments on that front with folks like Blackrock angling to enter the space. Wouldn't be surprised to see them do something big in the next couple of months.
00:21:05.884 - 00:21:17.774, Speaker C: And it's just going to take a long time. Until then, you have the major potential potential user here remains like crypto, degens and dow treasuries and perhaps forward looking neo banks.
00:21:18.714 - 00:21:39.738, Speaker A: Alex, it was funny leading up to this podcast, you remember the, remember last time we had dinner in New York, the topic we were talking about, it was, it was the uniswap fee switch, which is such a, there's no way in this market anyone would ever even consider that. Which tells me, I mean, I mean, that I forget when we had dinner six months ago, nine months ago.
00:21:39.866 - 00:21:42.874, Speaker D: Why not? Would you consider in this market, state.
00:21:42.914 - 00:22:16.594, Speaker A: Of regulation in the US is so much worse today than it was six to nine months ago. And the reason uniswap can't turn on their fee switch is for regulatory reasons, I would argue. I don't know if you guys would agree with that, but I'm curious. So Alex, you mentioned regulation. What this is all leading into is when you look at the future state of where you guys are allocating capital, especially in Defi, how much of it is going to be outside of the US because of what's happening in the states, because historically, you've allocated a lot of your capital inside the US. I'm curious how you see that changing moving forward.
00:22:17.574 - 00:23:02.560, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I would say, like, over the past ten years, we've probably invested 70% inside of the US, 30% ex US. I mean, crypto, of course, is a global industry, and we have a lot of connectivity with groups all around the world that are just innovating on this stuff. But in particular, over the last two years, that's kind of flipped. And so we're probably closer to, like 50 50 uS, ex us with a pretty strong trend towards ex us, which is unfortunate. We want to see this industry built in the United States. The US had an early lead, I think, on the R and D and the brain power in crypto. And honestly, the regulatory environment in the US has been not constructive at all.
00:23:02.560 - 00:23:17.284, Speaker C: And they are putting the US at a strategic disadvantage when it comes to crypto markets. So expect that trend to continue for the time being. But we're optimistic that the US gets on the right side of history eventually. Spencer, anything you'd add there?
00:23:17.984 - 00:23:53.082, Speaker B: No, 100%. It's definitely global. We try not to focus geographically. The thing we have to be conscious of is rule of law and of course, a regulatory overhang. So, like, here's a weird thing about investing in deFi, is if the primary value accrual mechanism is not going to be in equity, but it's going to be in some token or digital asset, and it exists on a blockchain. The good thing is it's really hard for a corrupt regime to just seize that, right? Whereas my equity, you kidding me? Like, all of a sudden some despotic dictator decides they're like, oh, wow, you built a nice company. There's.
00:23:53.082 - 00:24:13.600, Speaker B: You know what? I don't like these foreign investors being on this cap. Like, nah, I don't really like this ownership. Guess what? You don't own it anymore. And the chances of us winning in court, depending on the jurisdiction, we're not going to win in Russia. Congratulations. The business has been seized. In the odd chance that you actually deliver a successful outcome on a company, your winners get taken away from you.
00:24:13.600 - 00:24:48.624, Speaker B: But the cool thing about crypto is if it's going into a crypto protocol, the risk is lower there. I don't have to worry about suddenly it being seized overnight. It's a funny dynamic. But, Cynthia, you also touched on something earlier, which is thinking about DeFi protocols. If these were just traditional fintech companies, you're right. I think investors would be writing checks left, right, and center, hand over fist, take the money. And I think people should be very frustrated and pissed off at the pace of innovation in fintech and traditional finance.
00:24:48.624 - 00:25:15.234, Speaker B: Like, if we, let's look at the past 15 years, the major innovations that fintech has delivered, it's been buy now, pay later. So, like, affirm and klarna, right? Great. I can pay for my sandwich in four installments. That's kind of cool. You can fractionalize shares. That's Robinhood over collateralized lending to startups. That's Brexit APIs.
00:25:15.234 - 00:25:24.338, Speaker B: That's plaid. So now my bank can talk to my fintech app and maybe payments. There's been some stuff in the past.
00:25:24.386 - 00:25:30.214, Speaker D: By the way, plaid is not necessary in a world of composability. There's a patchwork.
00:25:32.274 - 00:25:58.486, Speaker B: That's exactly where I'm going with this. And so there's one other category that's delivered a bunch of winners in fintech in the past 15 years as payments. So it's been digital payments. We get stripe cross border payments and remittances. We get revolut, remit ly transfer wise. Right now, let's consider all of those innovations in a crypto context. Actually, before I even go there, here's the reason why people should be pissed off that the pace of innovation is not faster in finance.
00:25:58.486 - 00:26:34.538, Speaker B: It is the invisible thing in your daily life all the time. When we make it a little bit better, it has a ripple effect through the entire economy. It might be invisible, but it produces economic surplus for everybody. And we should demand more. We should demand a faster pace of innovation. Now, going back to those categories we just discussed, there's 200, 5350 billion dollars of market value from the companies I just mentioned right there. Just from those companies created from all of these items, which, by the way, Santi, as you just hinted at, crypto does all these things out of the box except for one.
00:26:34.538 - 00:26:50.574, Speaker B: There's one that doesn't do. It's the buy now, pay later. We don't have that yet. Sorry. Like, you won't be able to pay for your sandwich and, like, pay for it in four installments. But, like, all the other things, like, let's think about it, like, fractionalizing shares in a crypto context. How weird is that to think about, like, bro, just move the decimal point.
00:26:50.574 - 00:27:06.004, Speaker B: That's it. That's it. You fractionalized. Good job. And, like, Robinhood's a $10 billion company, right? Like, the ability for, like you said, santi, for my bank to talk to my fintech app, like, hello, this is what smart contracts do out of the box. Like, they talk to each other. You can, like, anybody can integrate them.
00:27:06.004 - 00:27:33.594, Speaker B: And let's see, like, over collateralized lending to startups. Like, by the way, how shocking is it that that, like, and by the way, I'm not trying to, like, fault any of the founders of these companies. They did a great job. So fantastic companies, right? They did a good job. But like, think about Brex. Brex was founded, forget like, maybe 2013. And their major innovation was realizing, realizing that, wait a minute, if a company has $10 million of cash in the bank, I can probably give them a $1 million credit line.
00:27:33.594 - 00:27:43.074, Speaker B: Like, because the regular lenders out there were just like, I don't know, I don't see any, I don't see revenue, cash flow. There's $10 million in the bank.
00:27:44.854 - 00:28:07.448, Speaker D: Well, you bring up a great point because, one, I think it's regulatory capture. Like, there's a great slide, 100%. Finance is just regulatory capture. Like healthcare, and it's just embedded in that is a whole issue of local fiat shit coins and central bank policies. Look, the government wants to control the money supply. And finance is one of those things, heavily regulated. And I get it.
00:28:07.448 - 00:28:51.448, Speaker D: You know, it's people's money. You know, we've had our own faults in crypto, like FTX. FTX is not a crypto problem. It's a finance problem, meaning counterparty risk and not having transparency into the operations, which if you want to be critical of FTX, you're not critical of Defi, you're critical of the traditional financial system and the regulatory arbitrage that has created a lack of clarity and yada, yada, yada. But the problem is, the second point I want to make is in my appreciation, you go talk to any bank right now, to your point around Brex. The reason why large banks are not servicing smaller businesses is because they have been saddled with a bunch of new regulations that are ever evolving. And there's two departments and banks that keep growing.
00:28:51.448 - 00:29:27.254, Speaker D: Finance, like accounting and compliance, the back office. Back office and compliance are the two only departments that keep growing in banks because it is incredibly costly now to run a bank. And so what does that mean? That they can only service their most profitable, largest clients. And so there's a whole underserved market. I'm not talking about like, emerging economies. I'm talking about even in the US, there's a whole set of businesses that don't have access to to just simple finance products. But you know, with crypto, I think if you talk to a bank today, we had a great guy, JP Morgan's head of crypto here.
00:29:27.254 - 00:30:17.474, Speaker D: And they're like, we love crypto because we can cut a bunch of costs in the back. And you tell me, atomic execution, great transparency, great. The problem is like, you don't have privacy, and without privacy they're not going to come and build on chain, they're not going to use Ethereum to settle stuff. So I'm kind of curious, again, it goes back to this point around timing. Like I hear you, you need a catalyst. There arguably is some tech that still needs to get built for these players to show up and start using DeFi. And so from kind of like themes or interesting ideas that you're looking at, like, what are some of the more exciting kind of pieces of innovation that you guys are excited about that you want to fund that haven't been built? DeFi or just generally infrastructure related?
00:30:18.494 - 00:31:13.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I guess a lot of our infrastructure investing has been in response to problems at the application layer that we saw over the last five years of investing in categories like DeFi, gaming, consumer and nfts and so on. We got really excited, in particular about ZK, different use cases of ZK on scaling and then some of the new things, things coming out of companies like Risk zero on the ZK coprocessor side on scaling. I think it's fairly widely considered to be consensus that ZK roll ups, at least for now, the way that we're going to scale Ethereum, we got really, really excited about that. We went and led Matterlabs's series C. We really like the product that they have. We love the team. With that, you get a better security model.
00:31:13.574 - 00:32:44.092, Speaker C: You are verifying correctness on chain in a really succinct proof, so you can push a huge amount of computation off the chain without sacrificing correctness. What that lets you do is basically you can lean out on the risk spectrum with off chain data availability. That means you can accommodate games, you can accommodate microtransactions, all sorts of new use cases that haven't been economically feasible until now, and that frankly still aren't. With the current state of rollups, which have scaled Ethereum by roughly ten x, it's maybe ten x cheaper to use a roll up today that needs to be 100 to 1000 x cheaper. And so ZK rollups are the way that we get there and the opportunity, I think, to create a new environment where you do transactions in this kind of modular way, where Ethereum really is sprouting new execution environments on top of it adds a lot of potential from a developer design space perspective. So in the case of Zksync in particular, they introduce an LLVM based compiler under the hood that'll eventually let developers write smart contracts in popular programming languages. So we get to deviate a little bit from the EVM and then really crack open the design space for the types of applications people can build and the types of tools they can use to build those applications.
00:32:44.092 - 00:33:26.358, Speaker C: You also get really neat features like native account abstractions. You can build much better authentication schemes, much better key recovery schemes, and better user experiences overall, where applications could pay gas for their users, allow users to pay in any token move they want to pay gas in USDC. Great, you can do that, and then eventually you'll get privacy as well. And so I think some of those institutional use cases get unlocked by virtue of new execution environments with differentiated features, as well as solving the issues that the crypto native users had in the last cycle. So that's on the scaling side. We think that's well underway. More and more applications are deploying first on l two, so that's been great.
00:33:26.358 - 00:34:04.744, Speaker C: I think l two beat has this wonderful chart of all l two activity superimposed on Ethereum activity, and the scaling factors, like how many overall transactions happen in the Ethereum context. If you include l two s, it's a little under six x right now. That to me is a really good sign of progress. Obviously, that number needs to get much, much higher. But there's progress underway on the other side. ZK coprocessors. These are, I think, not particularly well understood today, but more generalized versions of what the ZK rollups are doing.
00:34:04.744 - 00:35:15.464, Speaker C: It's really, you could think of it as a verifiable computer that could handle arbitrarily complex computations off chain and then return the results of that computation to Ethereum alongside a zero knowledge proof so that Ethereum can verify that the computation is valid. Blockchains, by nature are constrained in the types of computations they can run, and that's been a lot of the reason why applications have been designed the way that they have in a fairly limited way. This lets you just, I think, vastly expand the types of applications you can build and include more computationally intense things. So we see those kind of new infrastructure pieces as both scaling Ethereum, scaling the performance of it, lowering the costs, making it more accessible, but then also changing the design space for developers and allowing them to run all sorts of experiments, build new types of applications. We've also been excited by things like restaking by what Eigen layer has basically pioneered and then some the identity space as well. But yeah, have to harp on any of them.
00:35:15.804 - 00:35:40.734, Speaker A: Spencer, how do you think about this? Because in the beginning of the conversation, you said this thing, you said the lion's share of returns will be in things that you've never seen before. It's not going to, it's not going to be putting your mortgage on the blockchain. What do you think about this? I mean, obviously Alex mentioned very deep infrastructure investments. I would call that. What else do you think about when you think about these kind of weird, esoteric ideas that, like, haven't been seen before, but you think that crypto enables.
00:35:42.394 - 00:36:16.298, Speaker B: So let's see. So I think the catalysts that Alex just mentioned there are all fantastic. Like, they're a little bit behind the scenes, but they are like, they're the hidden catalysts, I think, that enable developers to build the next wave of applications. Right. So I think that those are like the major hidden catalysts. But, like, when I try to impart on our lp's of, like, why are you here? One of the main points I need to drive home with them is that crypto has a structural advantage in innovation. And this goes back to kind of my complaints about the pace of innovation and fintech and tradfi and Santi, I totally agree with you.
00:36:16.298 - 00:36:40.870, Speaker B: It was like a regulatory capture problem. It's an anti competition stance. It is not a. It's wrapped up in the, like, let me protect you. Like, and I won't go down the rant of, like, how it's literally like, their own studies are like, 99% ineffective and actually stopping illicit transactions. Like, sorry, a 99% failure rate. Like, are you kidding me? Like, the only thing that it's worse than the TSA.
00:36:40.870 - 00:37:21.934, Speaker B: I think the TSA catches like, 5% of illicit items that are supposed to go through, like, on their own self test. Right, okay, I won't go down that. But, like, the important thing is that crypto has this structural advantage and innovation because of this dynamic of it being an open platform that anybody can go and build on that is extremely rare in the world, that anybody can pick it up with minimal platform risk. The chances that the rules suddenly changed underneath them, drastically reduced from what we've ever seen before. You take this dynamic where anybody can build and you're going to unleash innovation. The hard thing about innovation is it's really hard to predict. People don't know where it's going to come from.
00:37:21.934 - 00:37:44.786, Speaker B: If we knew where it's going to come from, we just impose it. Like, have a dictator, just say, go and do the innovations, do this one and that one and that one. But we don't know. So, like, you want to maximize the number of experiments, you want to increase the number of builders, and you want them to be able to get out there and try things. And, like, literally that. An open blockchain is that, and then you add on to that. It's like the first layer.
00:37:44.786 - 00:38:19.100, Speaker B: That's like, I'd say the most important piece of the structural advantage in innovation. But then you take on this dynamic where I can remix anything that's already out there, I can pull the stuff off the shelf. I don't need to recreate the wheel for everything new I want to build. This stuff is out there. I can take bits and pieces of it, stitch those together, add something new, and create a totally different application. That's huge. Lastly, just the fact that I can make all of those things talk to each other and integrate with one another like that is, it's just such a powerful combination.
00:38:19.100 - 00:38:30.024, Speaker B: Like, it is this massive tailwind that is just radically underappreciated. As far as when people ask, like, how do we get from a to b? That's the answer. Yeah, you enable everybody to get in there.
00:38:31.884 - 00:39:27.124, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new DeFi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Bumper alleviates this by allowing you, the user, to lock your tokens into the protocol and set a price. No matter how much the market fluctuates, your investment in your token won't fall below the predetermined value. When you compare this to traditional options platforms, Bumper offers a non custodial and actually cheaper, on average alternative that protects the value of your crypto from market price drops. If you are looking to earn a yield on your crypto, bumper has you covered. By depositing USDC into the bumper protocol, you can earn a return which is derived from the premiums paid by protection buyers, early adopters and empire listeners have a chance to claim a part of the $250,000 early adopter bump rewards.
00:39:27.124 - 00:39:45.196, Speaker A: Go check out bumper. It's bumper five. Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. All right, everyone wanted to talk about. Vouch again, our favorite insurance provider for crypto companies. If you are building in crypto, you have probably come to realize that contracts need insurance. Partners demand insurance.
00:39:45.196 - 00:40:29.990, Speaker A: And as a founder myself, trust me when I say you owe it to not only yourself, but your investors and your clients and your customers. And I'm not just talking about any insurance. Their exclusive coverages are tailored specifically for crypto companies that can address issues like protections for regulatory defense, recognizing daos as insured, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities, and even covering the loss of digital assets. They're in it with you. Whether you're working on l one s, l two s, dows, MPC, wallet providers, building a protocol, and a lot more. So whether you're just scribbling your next big idea on a napkin or gearing up for a big fundraiser, maybe thinking about that IPO or an acquisition, don't leave things to chance. Get insured today with 5% off vouchs.
00:40:29.990 - 00:41:08.302, Speaker A: Exclusive coverage for empire listeners using code empire. Think about it this way. With vouch, you're not just ensuring your startup, you are investing in peace of mind. I have a question that I've always wondered that I guess applies to not only blockchain cap, but I guess probably all crypto venture firms. I'm curious how you handle this when I'm curious how you handle it. If you, let's say you make a bet on an, on an ecosystem, let's say you're making a bet on l two s, let's say you make a bet on ZK and you pick Zksync, it sounds like. But then in a year from now, you realize that maybe Zksync isn't going to be the winner.
00:41:08.302 - 00:41:20.194, Speaker A: And there's this other investment opportunity that you see. Maybe it's like scroll, or maybe it's arbitrum or something else, but you've already allocated to Zksync. How does either a venture fund in general handle this, or how does blockchain capital handle this?
00:41:22.444 - 00:42:06.642, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, we try to put our founders first, always within categories. To the extent that a new company is directly competitive with something that we're already invested in, that makes it pretty difficult for us to do it. And we would never do it without the consent of the founder. So that's the first thing that we do. There are certain cases where, where a founder might say, it actually could be useful to have you guys as kind of a shared stakeholder in each of these. Maybe there are ways that we could work together, maybe there's area for cooperation, basically, and we can take the view that the pie is going to be really big. Big enough for multiple players.
00:42:06.642 - 00:42:38.490, Speaker C: And if we just steer around each other and perhaps work together on certain things and then own different parts of that market, then we can both do better than sort of like going down in a knife fight against each other. And so that, I think, has been the more common pattern that we've seen with founders. They've been, I think, surprisingly, like, happy to have sort of a mediator in between them. And that often avoids, I think, a lot of the more unfortunate zero sum thinking that can sometimes happen in like, fiercely competitive markets.
00:42:38.612 - 00:43:06.714, Speaker A: Yeah. And how do you think about some of the recaps that are going on right now or some of the 80% discounted secondaries? When you look at something like that, is that exciting to you? And maybe it's almost, I'd call it quotes around this old school crypto company that's maybe been around for five, six years and they're doing maybe they're raised at 3 billion, they're trading at like 400 million in the secondary. Are those kind of deals exciting right now or you're really just trying to do like the newest, most innovative companies?
00:43:07.694 - 00:43:22.294, Speaker B: No, they certainly can be like our actually. So we haven't talked much about our opportunity funds. That's the second of the two. That's the series B and later fund. We actually. So it's the first time we've ever launched a different product. We have always stuck to early stage.
00:43:22.294 - 00:44:07.662, Speaker B: There's been a lot of pressure along the way. A lot of prospective LP's that have said, why don't you go and launch this additional type of vehicle, like call it a hedge fund or a active participation fund. Like a bunch of different types of things. People have come to us and we've said, listen, we want to stick to what we know and that's venture and specifically early stage venture. Now, what happened in the one time is the one exception we've made of launching a different product with the opportunity fund was sitting there in the middle of the bull market, and it might have actually even been Alex that first brought this up of like, there is an absolute, like, gluttonous orgy in the late stage market. Like, it is sick what's going on here, and people are going to get wrecked. So a lot of these funds are going to disappear.
00:44:07.662 - 00:44:50.764, Speaker B: And I'd say that's probably what defined in private equity and venture specifically over the past decade was just the absolute gluttony in that mid to late stage of the market. And those things always correct themselves and that's what we've seen. And so in this past market cycle, a ton of seed and series a stage companies are funded. A few of those are going to grow into that mid to late stage of the market, and the capital is gone. There's not very many people that can allocate to it. He said, listen, if there's a time when we're going to step in and do this, it's now. So we start, once the cycle turned, we went out there and raised that capital and we've made two investments out of it so far, and I think we'll make another eight to ten, maybe.
00:44:51.544 - 00:44:57.204, Speaker A: What is the state of that space right now? Series B, Series C? How big are the discounts right now?
00:44:58.354 - 00:45:36.294, Speaker B: It's just so tough, because in the market cycles, there's multiple ways for founders to play this game. They can say, I want to maximize valuation. I want to get the cheapest capital I can. That is one way to play the game. Right now we're seeing the downside of playing the game that way, which is you've oriented your investors, your team around that last valuation, and it's going to be really hard to ever get that valuation again. Or at least it's going to be hard to get it. If you need to raise capital in the next few years, that puts you in this tough position of potentially appearing to have lost momentum even if you've made forward progress.
00:45:36.294 - 00:45:49.534, Speaker B: I think it is tough for a lot of companies in that stage. The good thing is, at least for most of the ones that we know, they raised enough capital in the good times that they don't need to go out to market and do a primary issuance.
00:45:51.974 - 00:46:09.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, it's tough because if you do that, if you have to raise it, this 70% haircut, you've got, a lot of. The toughest part almost becomes motivating the employees who are never going to see a dollar on their equity 100%.
00:46:09.270 - 00:46:28.648, Speaker B: And that's part of what you try and guide them to. But it's always hard because when it's coming from prospective investor, there's a conflict there. It's like you're just trying to talk me into selling some of my equity at a lower price. Like, yeah, 100%. Like, that's in my business. I want to buy your equity at the best price I can. But I'm also just trying to make you aware of what can happen when a cycle turns.
00:46:28.648 - 00:46:46.324, Speaker B: And the, the fall off in retention of your key employees is a major downside of that. And it's like something to be aware of. Of, like, you'd rather have them come in like, you want them to be. Have ownership at a level closer to where you are. Right. Like, not maxed out, where there's no upside left on it.
00:46:47.184 - 00:47:05.008, Speaker A: 100%. Yeah, I think a lot of the folks who raised at the height of the market are facing that right now. Just talking to other founders. Maybe they raised it 100 x revenue. Their revenue is down 50% or maybe even 70% right now. But they raised at a $700 million valuation. Now their revenue is down to 3 million.
00:47:05.008 - 00:47:33.220, Speaker A: Well, now you're looking at a 200 x multiple, so the numbers just don't add up. So, Spencer, you had this tweet. I don't have it pulled up, but I could try to find it. You said something along the lines of, like, world coin is the single most misunderstood project in all of crypto, and I think that was. You got to fact check me. I think it was back in May, I want to say, or maybe early June. I'm pretty sure you tweeted that.
00:47:33.220 - 00:47:39.144, Speaker A: Are you feeling more convicted or less convicted about that now, four months later.
00:47:41.004 - 00:48:12.016, Speaker B: Equally convicted? This is a long horizon thing. Yeah. Listen, we probably need to do an entire episode on World Coin because I have a lot to say about it, but the place where that tweet comes from is because I know, because I was in that position. I'll give you some backstory, some context. Is someone on our team starts flagging in our internal slack channel, hey. We're always talking about who else might be going out and raising and where we should allocate our time. And someone had flagged, hey, worldcoin, I think, might be coming up for a raise soon.
00:48:12.016 - 00:48:25.124, Speaker B: Should we go talk to them? I'm the first to jump in there. No, I want nothing to do with this. This dystopian thing with hardware. No way. Get it out of here. Don't waste your time. Let's allocate our resources elsewhere.
00:48:25.124 - 00:48:49.778, Speaker B: But it took a couple of the engineers on our team were like, Spencer, that's fine. That's your view. I don't know if it's a very informed view. They're like, I've looked through the docs. Have you looked through the docs, Spencer? And I just sit there and kind of, you know, eyes down, like, no, no, I didn't. And they're like, well, you should probably go and talk to them and learn a little bit more about it before you just kind of come off with this surface level judgment. So we did that, and I was still like, hell bent on, we're never going to do this deal.
00:48:49.778 - 00:49:12.154, Speaker B: I'm just going to. I'm going to prove to you that there's. This is not an interesting opportunity. And the further we went, the more I completely flipped to the other side. I still think it's one of the most interesting, most novel things that's going on in crypto. We see a lot of clusters of things. There's nobody else in that category where they think operating at that kind of scale, in terms of the vision of what they want to deliver.
00:49:12.154 - 00:49:33.878, Speaker B: I think at a project at that scale, there's going to be plenty of things to critique, but they're not the things that people talk about. When I see a lot of time, it's just the same thing that I did. Please go spend a little bit of time reading the documentation. It's very well documented, actually. Very good. Like, great engineering team. So, yeah, I don't know.
00:49:33.878 - 00:49:39.566, Speaker B: We'll have to save it for, like, a whole other episode, because, like, Alex knows, like, once you get me going on it, like, I'll rant for a while.
00:49:39.750 - 00:50:01.824, Speaker A: Well, I had a similar experience. I didn't get, like, as bowled up as you did, clearly. But, um, I met Alex Blania. I went into the office in San Francisco and met with that and met with Alex Blania. And I was hyper skeptical. I was like, I consider myself to be, like, pretty outgoing, friendly person. Like, even in the office, I was like, I'm a little skeptical to even meet this guy.
00:50:01.824 - 00:50:16.480, Speaker A: And, yeah, I don't know. It's a really impressive combination of, like, hardware, biometrics, and crypto. And I don't know. I just tip my cap to anyone who can work on something that challenging. Right?
00:50:16.592 - 00:50:40.854, Speaker B: So that's the way it framed. It's, like, the most noxious combination of things. Like, are you kidding me? Like, biometrics, identity, crypto. Like, oh, my God, that's a lot to take on. And listen, hey, we may or may not be successful, but it is the most viable effort that I've seen, and there's some really interesting things going on underneath, and I think it can enable a lot.
00:50:41.274 - 00:51:01.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Alex, what do you think? So I kind of liked Spencer's framing there. I like a lot of things in crypto, but that's probably the most misunderstood thing is worldcoin. Is there anything that you look at, Alex, when you look at the industry where you're like, look, everyone's all hyped up on this thing. What do you think is the most misunderstood thing in crypto right now.
00:51:03.674 - 00:51:43.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we saw a huge wave of interest when the LLMs started getting released and got really popular. And then everyone's talking about AI times crypto. This is going to be kind of the biggest intersection in tech, and we tried really hard to see that. I think long term we see sort of a huge amount of potential there. I think there are some really big short term challenges to realizing that. The vision that a lot of people have in that intersection, that made it difficult for us to get there. We're still really excited about it.
00:51:43.614 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker C: But maybe to be a bit more specific, civic, like a lot of people doing AI inference on chain. I think the selling point there is mostly around verification and trust. And so do you trust the black box of chat, GPT, Bard and Claude and the likes? I think today that's not really what people care about yet, and trust is a fragile thing. You really start caring about it once it's broken. So it's easy to say now before that's really been violated in a big way. And the time will come when that happens. And then I think you'll see a catalyst for using some of these crypto and AI models.
00:52:23.114 - 00:52:49.586, Speaker C: So that's one of the big selling points. I think it's going to be hard to convince people to use it right now, especially if you have to take a hit on performance and cost. The other one is autonomous agents or smart contracts like using AI. Really interesting concept. It's niche for now. It's far from any product market fit. AI's don't yet feel exact enough, in my view, to put a lot of capital behind them without supervision.
00:52:49.586 - 00:53:18.634, Speaker C: So it feels like more like a subjective oracle. And I'm not yet sure what would be a really good use case for that. I think there's also a case to be made for decentralized training and compute, perhaps labeling as well. In the training case, I think people make a cost argument. Remains to be seen if that materializes. It appears to be, for now at least theoretical. And if I understand the argument correctly, it boils down to using latent computational resources.
00:53:18.634 - 00:54:09.894, Speaker C: But I think as we've seen with mining different types of crypto networks, that's not really what happens in practice. You need, especially in the case of AI performance GPU's, those don't tend to be latent, and so you end up with data centers that are chasing the incentives and you sort of revert back to the same economies of scale that give Microsoft, Google, Amazon an advantage. I'll color that with as decentralization gets cheaper and that overhead gets cut down over time. More and more consumers are probably going to want permissionless, censorship resistant versions of these LLMs and other AI models. And so you'll see interesting decentralized markets develop for those eventually. But you need performance to be good enough to be kind of somewhat competitive and for the cost to be manageable. And so I would say short term, like overhyped, long term, huge potential.
00:54:10.354 - 00:55:04.426, Speaker D: I mean, on that vein, I think you bring up a really interesting point, which is why would you decentralize? Not everything needs to be decentralized because you're making a huge trade off in terms of performance and, and cost. And so I think that was like, the biggest lessons from, like, the 2018 cycle hangover. It's like, oh, okay, we shouldn't decentralize Airbnb and Uber because it's kind of nice to be able to call, you know, a centralized party if shit hits the fan and your host doesn't want to open the door. And so what are your, I guess, in that continuation? Like, what are the biggest learnings of this cycle? You know, obviously there was a lot of blow ups. The carnage is still kind of there and real and the blood. And so I'm kind of curious, like, how you guys think about, like, your biggest learnings from this, this last cycle.
00:55:04.610 - 00:55:42.542, Speaker C: You know, one thing that comes to mind is that things go way too far. Like, things that don't work can get huge before they blow up. And, you know, we were watching, I think, with some level of material frustration as, like, algorithmic stablecoins were ballooning into the tens of billions of dollars of outstanding debt. And that was a really frustrating moment because we were thinking, well, they weren't really supposed to get this big. The model is sort of inherently broken. How did it get to this scale? And then can you land the plane? It turns out, no. At least that's really difficult.
00:55:42.542 - 00:56:05.634, Speaker C: No one managed to pull it off. So, you know, I think I was amazed at, you know, how much attention, how many credible people you can get behind a broken and false narrative. That was surprising to me. And certainly I'm going to have, I think, a more vigilant eye in the face of, like, you know, face melting growth.
00:56:07.254 - 00:56:38.720, Speaker B: Spencer, the hard thing with those two is like, you know, you go in, you're like, hey, we're not doing this. Like, it's not going to work. And then you watch it work for a while and you start to get nervous, right? Like, and you're sitting there and, like, we were watching this with algo staples, we were like, nah, it's not like we're looking at them like, these are cool. Like, run the experiment, please keep it small scale. And then you start to watch them. You're like, oh, geez, are we just wrong? And you just wonder if, like, do I just have. Am I just too biased to see that this actually works now? And so, unfortunately, we didn't, like, switch positions.
00:56:38.720 - 00:56:57.080, Speaker B: We didn't all of a sudden decide, great, we're bowling, we're in right at the top. But it is tough in those situations. And we saw that with most of the major implosions. We had the same thing with FTX. We passed that. We looked at the seed, we looked at the series a passed both times. Not because we expected it to implode.
00:56:57.080 - 00:57:17.800, Speaker B: We didn't know that there was an obvious conflict of interest that was flagged. But more importantly, it was flagged in the sense of, like, that is the only competitive differentiator here, right? Like, just going out with the message of like, I'm gonna build a better coinbase is like, okay, great, how, what are you gonna do? And, like, the messaging to me, when I received that bitch was, boom. Was we have Alameda. I'm like, uh oh.
00:57:17.912 - 00:57:25.964, Speaker D: You're like, where's the chinese wall? And they're like, yeah, well, you know, it's there, but, you know, you could jump over it fairly quickly. I'm like, that's not a fucking chinese wall.
00:57:26.864 - 00:57:38.102, Speaker B: That's it, exactly. So, like, we're just like, great, easy to do, but then for, you know, three years afterwards, you're sitting there going, oh, geez. Oh, I just cost unlimited partners a lot of money by not doing that.
00:57:38.158 - 00:58:04.754, Speaker D: Uh oh, well, that's, that's exactly where I was going. Like, how much? I'm sure you had an LP call and say, guys, why didn't you invest in FTX? Sequoia, you missed it. You missed it. And in the game of venture, you can't afford to miss these things, right? I'm just curious, like, if you're willing to, like, I'm sure you got some lP's that would, like, were like, why you're not in Terra? Why are you not an FTX? Why are you not, like, you know, X or Y?
00:58:06.254 - 00:58:26.194, Speaker B: You know, surprisingly, not as much. At least I didn't field them anyways. Like, because we, you know, each of us has different relationships with all of our LP's, but I didn't get a ton of that, surprisingly. Like, I think that there's, I think there's just a level of trust from the several years of working together. But honestly, if I'd been on the other side, if I was a limited partner, I probably would have made that phone call.
00:58:28.614 - 00:58:57.854, Speaker D: Expenser. I told myself I'll never manage outside people's mind, but whoever your lP's are, they sound great. I'll maybe have to call you if I want to do this again. I mean, algorithmic, stable, because I want to go back to that. Because look, they're fascinating experiments. There is this idea that one can become skeptical of things that have been tried in the past, and the crypto, no shortage. I mean, I think we've been in a journey over the last twelve years of try everything, see what sticks.
00:58:57.854 - 00:59:37.556, Speaker D: How much do you go back and revisit old concepts and say, hey, maybe this time is different, the infrastructure is different, the whatever is different. And I know when you ever, you're not supposed to say this, this time is different in investing because it, it's like it's not, but credibly, the infrastructure is different. Like, as it relates to tech. You saw this in the Internet too, like Pets.com didn't work, but then you had, you know, basically a shift from capex to operating opex, open source, like radically reduced costs. And so that allowed for a business model that is sound to be viable. But then, of course, you had record low interest rates and you funded Instacart, and, you know, things that never have.
00:59:37.556 - 00:59:57.160, Speaker D: Terrible unit economics. But hey, let's not go there. I'm just kind of curious if you actually are constantly reevaluating, maybe even sectors or companies that you invested in didn't work, and then you say, hey, maybe l two could work here, it could work in a different type of blockchain environment. I don't know, 100%.
00:59:57.272 - 01:01:09.554, Speaker C: I think we're constantly at risk of being captured by our own biases. Having been in the space for a really long time, we've seen a lot of these ideas that are starting, starting to work a little bit today, been tried five, six years ago and didn't work. I think a really good example of this is friend tech. This is an iteration on a model that has been tried lots of times before, and it didn't work. And so I think, at least the way we think about it, there's different reasons something can't work, and we draw different conclusions when we see things blow up or fail to get traction. And I think a reason not to revisit something again and kind of keep your door closed to that is like, the model is fundamentally really risky and like, cannot under any circumstance survive the crazy volatility in crypto algorithmic stable coins fall into that bucket. Then there are things that just like, aren't feasible given the state of infrastructure today and where at the time of our investment committee looking at that three years ago, we said, well, how are you going to manage the fee environment today or for the next three, four or five years? You're not going to be able to stay alive long enough for this infrastructure to get good to the point where you can scale it.
01:01:09.554 - 01:02:04.944, Speaker C: In that case, what we try to do, our best to do is just put a pin in it and say, look, this will work one day when the networks are performing enough and low cost enough and the user experiences are good enough to get regular users on board. Yeah, I mean, friendtech has been a fascinating launch and they've done a lot of things well and there's probably some element of luck and good timing there. People have been looking for an exciting thing to engage with that feels new and they iterated on that social model, I think in some really nice ways, too. We try and stay open minded. We're obviously at risk of coming to the wrong conclusion. But there's definitely two different categories here. There's like the not yet feasible and then the we should never try this again, which I'm sure people will do algo staples one more time, but they probably shouldn't.
01:02:07.404 - 01:02:16.012, Speaker A: Guys, great conversation. Is there anything else that is clearly missing from this chat or any big ideas that you guys want to talk about that we've missed?
01:02:16.148 - 01:02:47.940, Speaker B: No. I don't know if it's super important, but, like, Santi, going back to your point of like, thinking, revisiting things from the past, it's such a tough one, right? Because once you've ruled something out, you've seen the experiment not work. It's really hard to have the open mind about when it is going to work again. And that is one of these natural things that's really hard about venture, I think. I try to frame it, but it doesn't give me the answer. But I try and frame it in terms of sequencing for our industry, this roughly matches not perfectly. We should match it even better the way we've deployed our funds over the past 1010 years.
01:02:47.940 - 01:03:20.108, Speaker B: But like, first you have centralized years finance, then you have centralized infrastructure, then you get deFi, then you get decentralized infrastructure. And once you cross that, I think that then it opens up the door to things like gaming, consumer social, like some of those categories. But, like, if you try and pull the gaming forward, like, and do it when you're still at the decentralized infrastructure stage, it doesn't work right. The timing's wrong. And we've seen this with, like, a bunch of our investments in the portfolio. I mean, we invested in. I went.
01:03:20.108 - 01:03:44.564, Speaker B: I was so bullish. Indexes in 2017. Like, I went and scoured the market, invested in three of them. Radar relay. It was radar relay, paradox and Bancor. Right? So, like, so, so it's amazing, right? Like, so, so radar went on and ended up getting acquired by core scientific, like, years later. Paradox was acquired by Coinbase, like, three months after we invested.
01:03:44.564 - 01:03:52.304, Speaker B: And then Bancor kind of became the, like, the ugly child because it had a token, which was funny, and then.
01:03:52.384 - 01:03:54.264, Speaker D: Also did the largest ICO, and people.
01:03:54.304 - 01:03:56.504, Speaker B: Were like, you know, yes, 100%.
01:03:56.624 - 01:04:01.616, Speaker D: And then they said, impermanent loss was not a thing. And, you know, yeah, 100%.
01:04:01.680 - 01:04:27.408, Speaker B: And now, of those three, the one that I was not supportive of was Bancor, not because of any of those things that you just mentioned, but because this notion of the amm, and this is where you have to admit when you're wrong as a venture investor, I was like, no, this is not how you price assets. This is not an efficient way for price and assets. An order book is how you price these things. In both radar and paradox, we're going order book models. It was off chain. Order book on chain settlement. That's what's going to win.
01:04:27.408 - 01:04:53.846, Speaker B: And totally missed this notion of, no, the Dex serves a different purpose. It's not about being the most efficient pricing mechanism. It's about being able to price a long tail of assets. And that was what the market needed right then. And I'm, like, mapping over way too much of my tradfi experience and not recognizing that things can look different in crypto. I think that's the most important thing that I'm always trying to drive home with our limited partners. Like, stuff is going to look different.
01:04:53.846 - 01:04:55.474, Speaker B: It's not going to be what you expect.
01:04:56.614 - 01:05:20.654, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's such a good point, because you're right. I mean, so many people like Bancorp would tell you they invented amms. Like, they were the first ones. Arguably true. And then I remember back in my days of paraphy, I was pitching, like, you know, uniswap was raising round, and. And everyone that had anything, even though, you know, that came from finance, said, guys, this is flawed. Order books work better.
01:05:20.654 - 01:05:51.424, Speaker D: And the idea that I think is, is there is like, yeah, you're right? Like, not everything will look the same. And it requires a set of, like, flexibility in saying, hey, there's actually value here. Consumer preference being created when anyone can be a market maker. Maybe you don't care about impermanent loss. It's a good way to hedge. It's a good way to cost average your way in. You know, there's so many different things that I think we're so early, but it's such a true example of, you have to remain extremely open minded about things that may work.
01:05:51.424 - 01:06:25.374, Speaker D: And, you know, Chris Dixon talks about this, the really fancy term skeuomorphic. And, you know, we typically tend to, like, how many people imagine that the smartphone would allow you to, like, do all the different things that you do today, from streaming to hailing a cab and everything in between. No one. Like, the giants at the time, Nokia, Microsoft, like, everyone kind of dismissed. It's like, no, everyone wants to have a, you know, a palm pilot and their walk, man. Like, no, no, no. Like, this is not going to work.
01:06:25.374 - 01:06:31.794, Speaker D: And so it's really fascinating. The pace of innovation in this space never ceases to amaze me.
01:06:32.654 - 01:06:50.936, Speaker B: And, Cynthia, you're dead right on that. Like, and it is like, I love Chris's example of using, like, skeuomorphic stuff. It's like, you know, I've been framing these as, like, legacy boosters and horizon breakers. Like, the legacy boosters are things that, like, take all the stuff that we're already familiar with and do it, like, a bit better with the new technology. I'm like, that stuff's great.
01:06:51.000 - 01:06:53.008, Speaker D: Like a USDC, like a fiat bag.
01:06:53.056 - 01:06:55.576, Speaker A: Like rwas or something like that, right?
01:06:55.640 - 01:07:22.530, Speaker B: Totally rwas. Like, for the Internet, it's email. It's like, okay, great. I can send this faster than the post office, but then we have the horizon breakers, right? And that's, like, the things that are brand new that you couldn't do before, right? And that's where you get, like, social media. That's where you get Uber. That's where you get Spotify, right? Like, essentially all the big Internet stuff that we think about today, right? Like, those are the horizon breakers. And, like, it's funny because you can actually go back through time and look at all sorts of new technology, and this relationship has always been there.
01:07:22.530 - 01:07:38.322, Speaker B: Like, you can go back, like, electricity itself. Great. What can we use it for? Well, like, one is light bulbs. We could replace gas lamps and candles with light bulbs. That's great. You know what? It also unlocked all of your in home appliances. Electric appliances.
01:07:38.322 - 01:08:02.522, Speaker B: Like, you could have a refrigerator. Now, that's crazy. That's crazy, right? In computing, at the beginner beginning, like, what do we do? Okay. We moved from having to use an abacus for complex calculations to use in a calculator. Cool. But, like, what was the horizon breakers? Like, personal computers, gaming consoles, graphic design software. Right? Like, this is stuff that, like, we couldn't do that before.
01:08:02.522 - 01:08:06.054, Speaker B: And, like, that's what's gonna happen in crypto. It's gonna be all the weird stuff.
01:08:06.794 - 01:08:31.234, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, maybe a last question as you think about, I mean, this nice capital that you've raised, like, how do you think about the ratio of the category of those two categories and how much you invest in legacy boosters versus horizon? Kind of like, because, you know, not you. You could be too early or you can make more money and legacy booster, but it's not as sexy, is not as, like, you know, I'm curious how you think about deploying that in these two buckets.
01:08:34.054 - 01:08:50.182, Speaker B: I think the temptation is always to deploy to the legacy boosters and the bulk of the opportunities in the horizon breakers because I think everyone, like, that's the way we think. It's closer. It's been like, okay, I can get. It's a little bit faster and a little bit cheaper. Great. Like, I can totally get that. Like, and again, it goes back to our example of Dexs.
01:08:50.182 - 01:09:21.353, Speaker B: Right? Like, why am I initially dismissing this amm idea? It's too different. I'm missing what it's actually doing right now. That one's funny because it comes full circle. Right? Like, now things look closer to an order book, but definitely that's what I try. And, like, you know, when we're in our, you know, our investment committee and we're in our research discussions, it's like trying to ask that question of, like, which category is it in? And, like, both of them can be okay. We're not going to isolate to one or the other, but we have to be conscious of this inherent temptation to just do all of the same things but on a blockchain.
01:09:22.293 - 01:09:50.896, Speaker D: Nice. That's a fantastic way to end it, guys. I mean, I'm really excited. I think a lot of our listeners also want to understand raising that fund in this environment, and sounds like you have a great lp base there and permanent capital. You know, as permanent as it gets, you know, 710 year horizon is what we need, and I'm sure there's plenty of opportunities out there to deploy. So really, really fun discussion, guys. Where can people find you founders? You guys have a blog? Like, learn about what you guys are doing.
01:09:50.896 - 01:09:56.004, Speaker D: What's the best way to kind of keep tabs on, on how you're going to go out and deploy this, this good cash?
01:09:56.344 - 01:10:05.224, Speaker C: Yeah, we do have a blog on our website. You can also check out all of our personal twitters. You know, a lot of our DM's are open, so easy place to reach us.
01:10:05.804 - 01:10:06.864, Speaker D: Fantastic.
01:10:07.284 - 01:10:09.824, Speaker A: Alex, Spencer, thank you guys. Appreciate the time.
01:10:10.124 - 01:10:12.404, Speaker D: Thanks for having us. Always a treat. Guys, thank you so much for coming on.
