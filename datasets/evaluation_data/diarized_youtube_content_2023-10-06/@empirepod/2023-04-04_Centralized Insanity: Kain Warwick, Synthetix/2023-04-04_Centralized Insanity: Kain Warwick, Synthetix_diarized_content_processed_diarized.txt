00:00:46.648 - 00:00:55.144, Speaker A: You got Santi and you got Kane. Kane, welcome to the show. Are we still calling you the semi benevolent dictator, or do we have a new title for 2023?
00:00:55.964 - 00:01:15.260, Speaker B: I think on Twitter. I'm the head of decentralized finance. Someone wrote an article about me and put that in, and I was like, okay, cool, I'll take that. I haven't yet been rolled up by some international group of three letter agencies yet, so I don't know, maybe no one takes it seriously.
00:01:15.412 - 00:01:17.192, Speaker A: The CEO of Ethereum, huh?
00:01:17.388 - 00:01:18.480, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:18.592 - 00:01:19.208, Speaker A: Nice one's.
00:01:19.216 - 00:01:19.824, Speaker B: Gotta do it.
00:01:19.904 - 00:01:20.504, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:20.544 - 00:01:23.616, Speaker C: I'm just gonna go straight for the jugular because that's what people are doing today.
00:01:23.720 - 00:01:24.056, Speaker B: Are.
00:01:24.120 - 00:01:25.764, Speaker C: Is your all deed in spur.
00:01:27.104 - 00:01:53.774, Speaker B: You know what's so funny is no. Right? And, like, I think, you know, like, it is funny because there was a long time where people in discord especially, were like, this has to be a solve. Like, it just has to be. Like, it would just be so good. And, like, there's a. It's funny because, like, for a long time, I wish that it were, but I don't have the capacity to run alt. I tried to run an alt for, like, a month, and I was like.
00:01:54.514 - 00:02:03.266, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know how people do it. Like, it all also probably has, like, multiple personality disorder at some points. Like, actors, like, snapping out of, like, roles.
00:02:03.290 - 00:02:22.330, Speaker B: Like, he was fun. It was fun because I got to say shit to people, what's wrong with you? But then I'd be like, oh, I probably should be a little bit kinder than that. Yeah. And then I was just like, look, this is too hard. I can't maintain this. I just can't maintain it. So I did hang it up.
00:02:22.442 - 00:02:44.892, Speaker C: Okay, so I'll take that. So, I mean, it's great having you on because you have probably, you've been around in the space. And as we think about everything that's going on recently, you know, Defi has been in a bear market talking about degen spartan. He loves to tweet this chart of Defi versus ETH and how it's like.
00:02:44.988 - 00:02:46.444, Speaker B: Maker versus ETH or whatever.
00:02:46.484 - 00:03:26.414, Speaker C: Exactly. He loves maker. But this Defi, like as a composite, has just been really in a brutal trend. Even before terra, even before like 3 hours, all that stuff. And now it feels like maybe, you know, with all the bank runs happening, with the binance stuff happening, centralizing exchanges, kind of taking a big hit, it sort of does pose the question. And maybe this central theme of the episode is, so what does that mean for Defi? Like, and synthetics has had some recent action and historically, synthetix has sort of been kind of the leading the charge of the next run. And so I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts on everything that's going on.
00:03:27.634 - 00:04:12.004, Speaker B: Yeah, I think just on that point of, like, synthetics leading the charge. Right. Like Defi Summer, it was compound launching a token and leveraging yield farming to really get attention. And both of those things were synthetix playbook things, holding off and launching a token later. That was something that I think everyone thought compound would do. But juicing up the TBL, because that was the game at the time, juicing up TvL was the name of the game. And compound just took up that synthetix level playbook and said, okay, let's throw a bunch of tokens at this and see what happens.
00:04:12.004 - 00:04:45.294, Speaker B: Right? And it was incredibly effective. And that was kind of what launched defy summer. Right. But for all of 2019. And it's funny because I literally compressed 2019 and 2020 about a month ago, and I was on a podcast, like, I literally forgot to defy summer happened in 2020. It seemed like it was all very quick, but Synthetix launched yield farming and the inflationary supply and all this stuff in early 2019, like March, April, 2019. So it really did take a year.
00:04:45.294 - 00:05:16.994, Speaker B: Right. So then the question of like, okay, well, what was it that allowed this kind of defi resurgence? And I think, you know, it was all of those games. There's all of those, like, you know, kind of early PvP games that people, you know, got excited about. And there was something interesting to pay attention to again. And it was within the context of a series of projects that were doing things that were actually functional. You know, compound, you could borrow stuff, lend slash aave, you could borrow stuff. Maker Dai was working, you know, like it was scaling up.
00:05:16.994 - 00:05:29.554, Speaker B: Like we hadn't yet hit any scaling walls. Like, all this stuff was actually working, but that wasn't enough to excite people. You also needed the, like, crazy, you know, kind of incentive schemes to get people inside of.
00:05:30.014 - 00:05:46.114, Speaker C: I would love to get, like, your perspective on, like, how far synthetics has come over the years and what has perhaps been some of the challenges that haven't been possible or weren't able to be solved, maybe until recently, if there are any.
00:05:47.534 - 00:06:36.014, Speaker B: I think, in short, all of the challenges were not possible and we're not even sure if they're possible yet. That's the fun thing about synthetics, is that it is very much this experimental concept doing something that is incredibly hard. Every time we get close to finding out that some component is working, then we just push the envelope further. It's like, ok, let's try this. I think that is one reason why synthetics is kind of perpetually interesting, right? Even if it's not perpetually working or perpetually generating revenue or doing whatever it's doing. Like, it is always interesting because it's a set of really hard problems that we keep solving. And the other thing I think is that we rope other people into helping us solve them.
00:06:36.014 - 00:07:19.544, Speaker B: Like, you made that point about yield farming. We roped uniswap into that, right? Like we said, hey, uniswap's here, and we need liquidity as an on ramp. Like, rather than trying to do it ourselves, like, let's bring uniswap in. And, you know, we were the largest, you know, pool in uniswap for like, nine months right now. That obviously paid off for a lot of people with the Uniswap airdrop, you know, but. But things like that where, you know, we take Uniswap or chainlink or like, some other protocol and say, like, okay, let's work out a way to help, to bring that thing and help us solve this problem. And so it started off with a really simple thing of, we just want tokens that represent things that can't be on Ethereum.
00:07:19.544 - 00:07:47.374, Speaker B: So bitcoin, gold, silver, oil, FX, currencies, and USD is included in that. That's the primary one. USD is not a blockchain concept. USD is a real world concept, and we've tried all kinds of ways to bring USD on blockchain. That was the first synthetics problem. You know, even before synthetic, when it was haven. So all these problems have been like, okay, how do we, how do we do this? So it was like, all right, let's tokenize real world assets.
00:07:47.374 - 00:08:29.216, Speaker B: Like find a way to represent them on blockchain, on Ethereum specifically. Then let's let people exchange those tokens, right? And like find a way to do that, right? And, you know, then let's find a way for people to get leverage. Let's find a way for people to, you know, get margin trade. Let's find a way to like, do a potential future. So it's always like kind of pushing the envelope, and as you push further and things get bigger, you find cracks in the old system and you're like, oh, right, okay. Actually that doesn't work at scale. Like we can get to like, same thing as maker, right? Like Dai looked amazing, the first hundred million dot, right? It's like this thing's gonna scale to a trillion dollars, right? Then you're like, oh, actually, no, there's a problem here.
00:08:29.216 - 00:08:54.266, Speaker B: Like it's a combat capacity of e blending, et cetera. And so, you know, this is what all of Devi about. Just keep pushing, pushing, pushing. You find a new problem and you're like, okay. And, you know, it's one of the reasons why, I guess, synthetix also has struggled at times. Because when you're in the midst of the solution side of one of these hard problems, it can look like it just doesn't work. And it's really easy.
00:08:54.266 - 00:09:15.872, Speaker B: If you're a pessimistic person, be like, well, this thing's dumb. It's never going to work. The amount of people who said, like, you know, being the counterparty to all trades will never work, and it didn't. When you looked at it back then, it actually didn't work. You could see that fundamentally it didn't work. But conceptually did it not work. And that's the thing that people pessimistically assume.
00:09:15.872 - 00:09:29.676, Speaker B: But actually conceptually it does work. When you have perpetual futures and you have these funding rate mechanisms that keep the skew in line and all of this stuff, suddenly we're now two years down the road. It's like, actually maybe it does work. Shit, that would be crazy if that works.
00:09:29.820 - 00:10:15.044, Speaker C: Yeah, that's such a good point. I think you guys were critical in key pieces. When you think about like, synthetic assets, you need a really good oracle. And I guess you were, you know, you're probably one of the more important, more important protocols for adopting Chainlink and the success that they've had. Then you realize, well, it's really expensive when you're doing a lot of frequent transactions in an l one environment. So that I guess push you to then think about optimism or an l two solution, like optimism. I wonder, like from your perspective, I guess you do have a really good vantage point on the infrastructure deficit or the state of the infrastructure of Ethereum and other l ones, which I know you've been really kind of critical on, or just have stayed away from them, and you've been pretty vocal on that.
00:10:15.044 - 00:10:33.174, Speaker C: What's your latest thinking on where is Ethereum today? And the more concrete answer is people look at Defi and say, okay, great, you built all this stuff, but there's like ten users. Like, why are we going to actually see millions of users? And so I'm curious, when do you think that's going to happen?
00:10:33.874 - 00:11:29.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't want to jump ahead too far into the conversation because I know we're going to talk about centralized insanity later, so I'll park that for now. Right. But I think at a fundamental level, Ethereum is the original rolling experiment. It's like, hey, I think this Vitalik in whatever, 2013, I think we can build a thing that can execute smart contracts on chain. And the amount of people who said absolutely no, you can't, and certainly you can't do it that way, and certainly this and certainly that. It's weird how many people are in crypto who are super pessimistic. And I think it's incentives, the incentive to be pessimistic.
00:11:29.640 - 00:12:15.144, Speaker B: Once you're in crypto and you've got something that's working, if you're a bitcoin maxi and you're sitting there on your path of digital gold, it's really easy to be like, no, nothing will work. You're all done. And look at this pile of digital gold. Everyone focus on that thing. That's my thing that I'm excited about. But when you're a pessimist and you're just trying to shoot holes and things, you're right most of the time because most things are really hard in crypto and most things are hard in startups, and most things are hard in life, and a lot of things fail. And so you're going to be right, but you're going to miss out on the fun of, hey, can this thing work? And how do I get it and solve it? When you look at Ethereum, Ethereum started off, and I remember sitting there in 2017 in Mexico, and Vitalik was like proof of stake.
00:12:15.144 - 00:12:52.896, Speaker B: It was just like we're almost there, guys, six months and we're going to nail this. And obviously we all know that that turned out to not be the case. And that's not a criticism of anyone, that's just the world, right? Like the world's fucking hard. And so when you set up to do really hard things, it takes a long time, right? And so, you know, ethereum scaling has taken way longer than we expected. And I've said this many times that the fact that it took longer left a window of opportunity. We can't pick on some level when the cycles happen. And if a cycle starts to ramp up before you're ready, it's going to be bad for everyone.
00:12:52.896 - 00:13:28.482, Speaker B: It's going to be a bad time for everyone because the market will fill the gap. So either you can turn up and be like, well, headway bullshit, whatever, it's going to be fine. Or you can be like, actually, we've still got really hard problems that we don't know how to solve because you're being honest about the problem and someone else turns up and says, hey, I've got a computer over here and it does 30,000 tps, right? And it's decentralized. Don't look over whatever. And that person's going to win on some level because they're selling something that's really easy to get for the average person who's turning up. And they're like, no, no, my thing's going to win. The computer in the back room is going to win.
00:13:28.482 - 00:13:53.246, Speaker B: Ethereum thing is nonsense. It's not going to work. And so I think that that has been an issue for Ethereum a couple of times. And it's been an issue for Defi and for synthetix that like we weren't quite ready to scale up when the market started ripping up. And people, absent a genuine solution, will look for a shitty, not real solution because they want something. They want an answer. Ken, do you think that's just what.
00:13:53.270 - 00:14:16.196, Speaker A: Ends up happening in all these crypto cycles, though, is like bear market, Ethereum wins Ethereum, things get built. Zkevm l two. Those kinds of things get built in the bear market. Bull market happens. Value gets kind of attracted to those things in the beginning of a bull market. But in the latter half of a bull market, you get things like l one s and other ideas. And that's the sexy thing that gets the attention.
00:14:16.196 - 00:14:24.334, Speaker A: And then we have to get to the other side of the bowl to realize that it was Ethereum all along. Or do you think that like, or do you think that changes in future cycles?
00:14:25.314 - 00:14:47.874, Speaker B: I think there have been a couple of reasons why the Alta ones, you know, if you look at the original alto, one thesis was like, eos, right? You know? And, like, we kind of. We left. We left that door open. Like, the amount of people that I had in, like, 2017, 2018 were like, you cannot believe how good eos is. It is so amazing. And it's like, I mean.
00:14:47.914 - 00:14:51.888, Speaker C: I mean, I still remember you guys were like, at some point, we're looking at, like, partner with them.
00:14:51.936 - 00:15:18.272, Speaker B: We were looking at going on there, because we're like, everyone's saying to us, this thing's amazing. Like, maybe we're the idiots, right? Like, we had so many people that were like, no. I was like, oh, okay. So we spent six months, you know, like, JJ, who ran engineering, spent six months looking into it, and his conclusion was this fucking nonsense. This is a guy who had come from MongoDB and was the director of engineering there, and he's like this. There's no engineers here. There's no structure.
00:15:18.272 - 00:15:37.744, Speaker B: There's no. They don't. Like, this is like, ethereum's bad. Don't get me wrong, Ethereum's bad, but this is nonsense, right? Like, and it was like all these people who were talking about how eos was going to be this amazing thing either had no credibility because they had looked into what it was or how it worked or how it was structured or whatever, but they were just talking their own backs, basically.
00:15:37.864 - 00:16:00.626, Speaker C: I mean, so, like, maybe let's put a pause on all this stuff. I'm just kind of curious to get your perspective. How does a company, like, block one, the guys behind eos, managed to raise $4 billion and, like, from, like, really good investors for, like, a. This was going on for, like, a year, and, like, how do they pull it off? I mean, to be fair, you guys probably marked the top of the ico.
00:16:00.690 - 00:16:03.042, Speaker B: Boom. Like, you. You raised up.
00:16:03.138 - 00:16:05.642, Speaker C: It was a 200, 3260 million.
00:16:05.738 - 00:16:07.570, Speaker B: No, 30 million.
00:16:07.762 - 00:16:10.874, Speaker C: 30 million. Sorry. Off by an order of magnitude.
00:16:11.034 - 00:16:11.618, Speaker B: 30 million.
00:16:11.666 - 00:16:20.134, Speaker C: But it was, like, the fastest sale, which was a lot. But, like, how does eos, like, raise this amount of money? And no one ever, like, dig deep like you guys did?
00:16:20.634 - 00:17:00.870, Speaker B: Well, there's two schools of thought on that, right? Like, one is they actually didn't. They structured their sale in a way that was, you know, an ongoing year long thing, right? And they were able to just recycle funds back into it and just buy more and more of their token, which meant that they control so much of the supply, they had a whole bunch of, like, civil wallets. And, you know, that theory's been around for a while. I don't know if you'll ever be able to disprove or prove that they. That it was legit. But crypto being crypto, it wouldn't even surprise me if someone came out and said, actually, it was all legit and we've got all the people, and we just got, like, a document that says, here's all the people, and, you know, this is how the money got in. Like, it wouldn't surprise me.
00:17:00.870 - 00:17:42.068, Speaker B: It would not surprise me if it was totally illegitimate and it was just recycled funds and they really raised like, 500 mil or whatever. But towards the end of the ICO boom in early 2018, I mean, what telegram raised 2 billion or something? Like, let's. And I say this a lot, right? People like, oh, 2 billion, that's not that big of a deal. Because people, I think, actually get confused between raising $2 billion or raising $4 billion at a $4 billion value. Wait, those things are not the same thing. If you raised $4 billion, your valuation is like infinity, right? Like, it's like nonsense. Like, no one's ever raised $4 billion in a round effort.
00:17:42.068 - 00:17:52.380, Speaker B: Like, it could be the largest race in history. I don't know. Like, I just can't imagine, you know, outside of, like, some huge fund. Right? Like someone for an actual thing that people are going to do, raising $4 billion.
00:17:52.492 - 00:17:52.916, Speaker C: I saw it.
00:17:52.940 - 00:18:32.146, Speaker B: Lunacy, right? Yeah. And so, like, you know, why does no one look at this stuff? Because of fomo, you know? I mean, realistically, if you experiment with the mechanism for people to put money in, and this promo, I remember being in, like, St. Moritz in 2018 and everyone, we're in this car and we're like, coming back from like a dinner or whatever, and all of these VC's were just frothing over telegram. And I remember sitting next to this guy and I was like, no, like, guys, like, what are you talking about? Like, even if this is amazing, how are you going to put $2 billion into it and how this makes sense, right? And, you know, that's different. Story. Story. Because obviously a lot of stuff happened.
00:18:32.170 - 00:18:36.814, Speaker C: I mean, we've seen this movie play out before again and again.
00:18:37.354 - 00:18:56.776, Speaker A: Can I just one more point on these, like, going back to what we were talking about earlier with the kind of, like, alternative ecosystems outside of ETH, because I think it's unfair to say that the things happening today are like eos. And I know what you're saying. But I do think, like, it's unfair to compare something like, I don't know, they call it system or Solana to an e 100%.
00:18:56.890 - 00:19:00.484, Speaker B: It's ten times better. Yeah, that's why I said that was the original.
00:19:00.604 - 00:19:14.100, Speaker A: Right, right. I'm curious to get your view on other ecosystems, like, in your mental model for this world and in crypto. Like, is there anything in these other ecosystems? And is there anything of interest there? Or you're like, look, the world will be built on Ethan.
00:19:14.132 - 00:19:46.792, Speaker B: That is it. Look, you know, there's a whole ecosystem of, you know, people. You know, I mean, not anymore, but, like, you know, if you look at even, like, phone os, right? Like Windows Phone. Like, you know, Microsoft was able to, like, pump enough money into that that, like, people came and turned up and they're like, we're building exclusively for Windows Phone or, you know, whatever. So, like, there's always going to be activity there. The question is, like, is it sustainable? Is it the best activity? Are the best people doing it? Like, does that make sense? Right? And so, of course, the all out ones have gotten much better, no question. Like, eos was a dumpster fire.
00:19:46.792 - 00:20:18.458, Speaker B: And, like, you know, Solana, like, you know, they've got challenges or whatever. They're making trade offs that I don't agree with, but, like, it's a real thing. They've got engineers there. So. So, you know, this is not to say that, like, you know, everything is eos all over again. It's, it's, you know, it's definitely better than that. But the reality is that by ETH building out in the open the way that it did, by being honest about the challenges, by being honest about, you know, and like I said, the ETH community being honest about, like, you know, the issues that remain to be solved, right.
00:20:18.458 - 00:20:59.934, Speaker B: It was so easy for someone to turn up and be like, oh, we don't have any issues remaining to be solved. We actually solved them last week. So dump a bunch of money into us because we're about to just run past ethereum, and ethereum's kind of like, and there is this thing if you go on crypto, twitter, especially in the bull market, where, like, ethereum, people are losing their mind. They're like, why are we being honest with people? Like, how can you compete when you're being honest? And it's like, you, can you just compete in the long term? And it's just one cycle and you just let it go, you know, so when the guy's like, no, no, like, we solved that technical problem last week, and here's how we solved it. And just look over there. It can be frustrating, but you just have to accept that that's just the market. The market's going to do what it's going to do.
00:21:00.094 - 00:21:21.624, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to transition a little bit because other than building synthetics, you're also a very prolific investor. Certainly things that you want to see built. What is it that you're most excited about in crypto right now? Things that perhaps haven't worked but will work or they thematically really excited about that you think are really going to take off next cycle.
00:21:22.924 - 00:22:03.248, Speaker B: I think this is the kind of point of all of that stuff leading up to is that ethereum is basically there now, at least to the extent that we can see we have actually solved the problems. Even proof of stake, there was a long time where it was like, oh, proof of stake, not a real thing. It's never going to happen. Even though there were other proof of stake systems that existed, like the idea of transitioning from proof work, proof of stake, people were just like, now it can't happen. Easy to sit there and be a pessimist and chew holes in that, but the reality is that it has happened. And then it's like, okay, we'll move on to the merge, never going to happen. And now it's like rules, rolls, and the next thing is never going to happen, but it inevitably does.
00:22:03.248 - 00:23:01.868, Speaker B: And it seems to me like Ethereum, with the current setup that it has with multi client teams with really good incentives to work hard, like it's working better than it ever has. Like, the decentralized coordination component of Ethereum is ten times better than it was 0.17. It just is like, it's just empirically obvious, right? And so now the question is, okay, like, can we keep this momentum as the ethereum ecosystem into the inevitable next bull market? And my sense is yes. And so, like, you know, to go back to your question, like, what's the difference? You know, do we always end up with this like frothy nonsense at the top? Yes, there will absolutely be that. But if you give people a reason to go to BSc because the transactions are 1000 times cheaper, right. People will do it, right? If you go, you know, if you give people a reason to go somewhere else in the middle of a bull market, they will. I think we are the closest we have been to not giving people a reason to leave Ethereum this cycle.
00:23:01.868 - 00:23:26.602, Speaker B: I think there will be really, there's always a reason. One of the reasons is that if you can go and buy a thing for one cent and pump it to, you know, a dollar, right, like, that's a reason. So that reason will never go away. So there will always be frothy nonsense. But the technical, underlying, architectural reasons and like, user facing reasons, I think we're close to removing that reason for people to go somewhere else.
00:23:26.738 - 00:23:30.514, Speaker A: And what about the kin? Were you, were you in Denver? I'd eat Denver.
00:23:30.594 - 00:23:33.288, Speaker B: Or did you know I wasn't. No, I haven't been traveling much.
00:23:33.386 - 00:24:01.772, Speaker A: I talked to Santi about this the other day. But a lot of the discussion in crypto today is very hardcore infrastructure still. So if you looked at all the folks in Denver, it was very little of the zeitgeist is dedicated to things that people want to use. It was like Zke vms and wallet infrastructure and stuff like that. Staking different staking mechanisms. When does that shift over to things that people want to use? Are we multiple cycles away from that?
00:24:01.948 - 00:24:22.428, Speaker B: No, I think we've already got the stuff that people want to use. People want to use derivatives, they want to trade. Like, if we look at the main use case of crypto, it's, you know, people want to trade crypto, right? Like, that's the main use case. The other use cases, I think will kind of emerge out of that when all of, when that's called. Right. But we can genuinely do that in decentralized way and that's when Defi will win. Right.
00:24:22.428 - 00:24:55.792, Speaker B: And that, you know, again, not to like jump ahead to the conversation, but I think that's where we're close to doing now. Why is everyone focused on infrastructure? Because all of a sudden infrastructure is working for the first fucking time. And so people are like, oh, wow, this is a thing actually, before they were like, oh, maybe we shouldn't work on infrastructure because some guy with 500,000 followers says Ethereum's dead and infrastructure is pointless. And now people are like, oh, wait a second. Infrastructure is a way. There's still unsolved problems here that we can solve, and there are. The gap is getting smaller.
00:24:55.792 - 00:25:09.920, Speaker B: I think we've got an ecosystem of l two s now. There's stuff that's filling those gaps that used to exist within the ethereum ecosystem. And so it will get harder. But there's no question that wallet, there's a whole bunch of unsolved problems still.
00:25:10.072 - 00:25:49.324, Speaker C: Yeah, on that point that you could argue that we're now in an infrastructure surplus point where, you know, transactions on l one super cheap on Ethereum. And there was a time where we complained that it cost the car and a half to, like, do one transaction and l 2ft. Like arbitrum, optimism combined. You could argue there's so much capacity. The question is, again, what is it going to take to onboard millions and millions of users? I know it's a loaded question because you can go in so many directions, but what is the first thing that comes to mind as the main challenge that we could be focused on as a community?
00:25:51.434 - 00:26:16.114, Speaker B: It's. It's an interesting question because even still. Yeah, I say we have working l two s, right? We don't really have working l two s. Now I'm gonna put my honesty hat on, right? And say, like, we don't. And, you know, that's gonna leave the door open for some fucking idiot to waltz in, I guarantee you, in, you know, 2024, and be like, I've got a working l two. If the sequencers decentralized, like, fraud. Yeah.
00:26:16.114 - 00:26:26.004, Speaker B: Like, they're gonna just say, like, we've got all the problems. They're all solved in the background. Just, you can't build it back there right now, but, like, trust me, they're all solved. And, you know, like, you're just describing.
00:26:26.044 - 00:26:27.224, Speaker C: Side chains here, sir.
00:26:28.084 - 00:26:55.838, Speaker B: I'm sorry. Yes, but they will. Sidechains will I, like, listen, like, I promise you right now, I'm gonna be. Side chains will reinvent themselves as, like, some other thing. There'll be some memeable name that they've, like, got that's, like, slightly better than l two s, and they'll be raising 100 million fucking dollars. Promise you this will happen in 2024. And so to go back, we don't have decentralized sequencers yet.
00:26:55.838 - 00:27:28.886, Speaker B: That's going to be a hard problem to solve. We don't have fault proofs or we do, but there's still issues with them or whatever. We don't even have an optimized data availability layer in l one to the l two s. That's still, like, there's still work to happen there, right? You know, there's erps coming that will make that even better. Right. You know, there's fundamental architectural changes that need to happen in the l two s. So, like, you know, we say we've got working l two s, but we don't really.
00:27:28.886 - 00:27:48.094, Speaker B: We have significant scaling still left in the current l two s that we're working on. And yet I would say if, like, you know, 5 million people turned up, um, you know, in a month's time, we would accommodate them so much more effectively than we did last cycle.
00:27:49.714 - 00:28:21.096, Speaker A: All right, quick break from the show. There is this kind of overused cliche saying in crypto, but it's true. Bear markets are building and everyone tells you that and everyone knows it. What people don't know is that if you're building apps in crypto and building apps in web3 without using quick node, you are building on hard mode. So Quicknode is this amazing blockchain development platform. It reduces costs, streamlines the time to market for your app, and it offers consistent performance at scale. For folks that have built apps, you will know that there are a couple key points here.
00:28:21.096 - 00:29:09.174, Speaker A: One, Quicknode offers unlimited endpoints across 18 different chains and 35 different networks. They have response times that are two and a half times faster than any of their competitors, 99.99% uptime and a dedicated 24/7 customer support team. If you've been listening to empire for a while, you might know that I am no gigabrain developer, but I do know a lot of devs and a lot of great product teams at other places. So when I see Coinbase and Twitter and Adobe and OpenSea and doing analytics, all leveraging and trusting Quicknode to power their business, that's when we get excited and that's when we want to partner with them. To the best solution for any leading crypto and web3 company that is seeking an end to end blockchain development platform right out of the box. So my message to you, get off hard mode.
00:29:09.174 - 00:29:27.826, Speaker A: Let quicknode handle the blockchain infrastructure. Let quicknode handle the security. Let quicknode handle the performance while you focus on building beautiful products for your users. Visit quicknode.com comma super easy. You can use code Empire. You'll get a free month on their build plan, so don't forget to use code Empire.
00:29:27.826 - 00:30:11.614, Speaker A: Santi and I got to get credit for this one so they know that we sent you and you will get a first month free. Hope you guys enjoy it. All right, folks, it is time to talk about one of my and a lot of your favorite DeFi protocols. Synthetix synthetix has been pushing the limit in defi innovation since 2017 and has just started its most exciting transition yet with Synthetix v three. With Synthetix V three, any protocol can now tap into Synthetix liquidity to bootstrap derivatives markets. The transition has already started with Synthetix perps. Synthetix perps taps into Synthetix's liquidity layer and is a new primitive that developers can leverage to launch defi derivatives.
00:30:11.614 - 00:30:39.330, Speaker A: The perps product has been going incredibly well so far. Hopefully you've seen it. It's had some great traction, hitting 500 million in daily volume this March. We know that liquidity rules Defi and synthetix is becoming the modular liquidity layer for defi derivatives. As a trader, you can trade synthetix perps with low fees in over 20 different markets at quinta IO, decentrix.com, and polynomial fi. And this opportunity set keeps growing.
00:30:39.330 - 00:31:10.942, Speaker A: With ten new partners in the pipeline ready to launch integrations on top of Synthetix, including front ends, structured products, and institutional offerings, the team gave me a sneak peek of all this stuff. It's really cool. Would really recommend you check out Synthetix IO forward slash perps to learn more. And if you're looking to build on Synthetix, hop into their discord server, reach out to the team directly. Make sure to tell them that Empire and Santi and Yano sent you again, Synthetix IO perps. You can also hop into the disc discord server and reach out to the.
00:31:10.958 - 00:31:40.944, Speaker C: Team directly, transitioning a little bit into kind of what needs to be built. The first obvious thing is there's been a lot of wreckage in the centralized world, partially because. Not because it wasn't a good business model, just because of terrible mismanagement. Like, it's like people that are. Have no experience in finance or risk management just kind of blew something that was actually pretty good. Do you think that all of that eventually transitions into a decentralized context now that we have all this infrastructure?
00:31:41.924 - 00:32:02.952, Speaker B: Yeah. So it comes back to, in my mind, a very simple thing. The market will solve a problem. So the market will solve a problem. It will solve it in the most efficient way that it can. That's what markets do. The most efficient way is to.
00:32:02.952 - 00:32:28.312, Speaker B: To just centralize everything and take all of the benefits of the technology and remove them. Then the market will do that. And every single time we've gotten into a bull market, we've been forced into that because we haven't had the decentralized technology. We've had a little bit. And so people will kind of play in the decentralized land a little bit. But the primary demand in a bull market is trading crypto. That's where the demand is going to come from.
00:32:28.312 - 00:33:01.394, Speaker B: And so if you can't trade crypto in a decentralized fashion, like you couldn't in 2017, so 0% of, you know, activity, I mean, that's not, like, either delta whatever. Like, 0.001%. Right. Of, you know, transactions happened on decentralized exchanges. Right. I saw a chart a couple days ago that says it's like 15% or 20% or something like that of exchange activities happening on decentralized exchanges now. I think Hayden posted about Uniswap and a bunch.
00:33:01.394 - 00:33:34.462, Speaker B: That's crazy. There were people that said that it will never get above 1%. It just isn't even possible that you can compete. I do think that we are going to see, people are going to want to trade crypto again. We'll have a mass influx of people who want to trade crypto, and we are in a position now where the way that they typically want to trade crypto over time, it's like leverage and margin, etcetera. They want, like Bitmex invented the perpetual future. And that's the thing that is the most efficient way to express your desire to trade crypto.
00:33:34.462 - 00:33:54.714, Speaker B: I don't think that's going to change in the near term, and therefore we need decentralized versions of that. We weren't even close in 2020. No one was even close. We're pretty close now. It feels like we're pretty close to that. I think by the time there's a lot of demand, we'll be very close. And the key thing is that you need to have multiple solutions for something.
00:33:54.714 - 00:34:17.394, Speaker B: Too many times in crypto, especially in decentralized finance, we've only had like one, maybe two options. And I think when you have one or two options in a decentralized solution, and then like 50 options that are centralized, it's really hard to compete, even if the two are quite good. So that's one of the things you need, like a flourishing ecosystem of options for people to use.
00:34:17.894 - 00:34:39.604, Speaker C: Well, speaking of options, it does feel like that is dwindling down in the centralized land. There's some, certainly more regulation coming in the US on ramps. Liquidity has really dried up. You could argue potentially coinbase is a viable business, could be impaired. What does that mean for crypto, especially decentralized finance?
00:34:41.024 - 00:35:31.016, Speaker B: I think it means probably a couple of things. One, the regulatory arbitrage payoff increases, finding some jurisdiction, banana republic or something, that you can turn up and buy out the entire government and set up your crypto paradise of centralization there. That pay off will be much higher than it was even last cycle because the delta between coinbase or kraken or an exchange that's trying to do the right thing, that's in a sane ish jurisdiction. And you know, someplace out, you know, in the asteroid somewhere, right. You know, out in space is going to be significant, right. Because they're just going to be able to do things that those other exchanges won't be able to do. Right.
00:35:31.016 - 00:36:01.638, Speaker B: They're going to be really, you know, fine with both hands slide by their back. But we have an alternative, which is decentralized finance. Right, which is its own version of regulatory arbitrage right now. And so the, you know, the delta of using a decent centralized exchange that can give you everything you want as a user versus using centralized exchange is going to compress in a way that it never has. I think we could actually see a viable ecosystem of exchanges, decentralized exchanges.
00:36:01.766 - 00:37:04.384, Speaker C: Yeah. I think all too many times there's some regulatory action and crypto gets bundled altogether and there's not enough nuance. I do think that there's understanding at the working group level of these agencies, but sometimes the press mainstream just sort of like, looks at it, it's like all of it's bad. And unfortunately, that's kind of the state we're in so early. But if a regular regulator approaches you, tries to understand what synthetics does, say the CFDC, and if you look at the issues that they're bringing up against some of these centralized players, you could argue, and I'm curious if you agree with this, that, like, why wouldn't you want to have a totally transparent system, that the counterparty risk is very well understood. The level of permissions that you give a smart contract or whatever counterparty are very well defined. And so you don't really necessarily have these issues that have existed in traditional finance for so long, which are largely a result of there's no transparency, just people don't.
00:37:04.384 - 00:37:44.224, Speaker C: There's just sort of this, like, trust us, I promise. But don't look at the charts. Just today, for instance, as an anecdote. You can't, like CNBC, you can't now look at credit default swaps for most banks. So how crazy is that? So you try to look at the CDs for bank of America, no longer there, folks turn away, go elsewhere, go for a jog, like, you know what I mean? Like. So anyways, back to the serious question. Do you think that ever get to a state where a regulator appreciates that? Do you think that they care? I'm just trying to understand how perhaps the end game might have regulated, can defi work its way into the traditional system, which is just a clusterfuck.
00:37:44.764 - 00:38:32.224, Speaker B: So I've thought about this a lot, and I've talked to some other founders of Defi projects, and you kind of scratch your head a little bit, and you're like, okay, well, you know, these are obviously competent people, right? Like, you know, it's hard to get into a position of power in the world, right? Like, there's this, you know, game where you have to beat other people. Now, maybe you're optimizing for the wrong qualities or skills in a person, right? But it's not easy to become, you know, the head of the CFTC, right? Or, you know, the head of the SEC. Like, that's not an easy thing. You can't just turn up and be like, hey, I'm Jimmy, and I'm going to run this place. Right? You know, it takes a lot of work and time and effort. So then you go, okay, well, like, these are obviously competent people. They're obviously intelligent people.
00:38:32.224 - 00:39:32.886, Speaker B: Where is the misalignment? And I think the answer is that they are, you know, to go back to this, like, pessimism thing, they're skewed, maybe pessimistic, right? They're like, we have a solution to this problem, right? The solution is oversight. That's. That's the solution, right? Like, we don't need to remove the need for oversight. We've got oversight. Look at rules, and we've got rules, and we've got people that can go in and look at your manila folders and go through them and figure it out. It takes ten years, and it's slow and clunky and allows for a bunch of fraud, but we've got that system, and they're just pessimistic at a fundamental level, that you can solve this with technology, that oversight can be removed as a necessity because you can have things that are transparent by default. So I think if you talk to Gensler, he would just say, like, you know, this is like a kind of misdirection where you're building something that won't give us this thing.
00:39:32.886 - 00:40:20.254, Speaker B: Because there's a fundamental level of pessimism that you're not going to get this oversight. And by saying you're going to give people oversight, you're finding a way to, like, kind of skirt around our oversight, which is the only way that the world can be sure that this thing works. And I think everyone in crypto, or at least a lot of us in crypto who believe in the technology and understand why is a better solution to this coordination problem of you either need oversight or you need transparency. I think we believe that the world will get this eventually. This is not. We will win this argument. But at the moment, unfortunately, the people you're trying to convince are people that have been playing this game of, I want to be the head of the SEC for, who knows, 30 years, right? And they like the start of that career.
00:40:20.254 - 00:40:53.434, Speaker B: If I want to be the head of the SEC, there's no such thing as transparency, right? Like, everyone's a bad actor and you got to have oversight or whatever. So, like, that guy needs to die basically right? Before, you know, this is like the structure of scientific revolutions, right? Like this idea that, like, the people who are in charge now grew up in a paradigm that just doesn't comprehend what we're trying to do. And when all of the regulators who are 70, 80 years old kick the bucket, then some new person turns up who knew that crypto was a thing the whole time, and they get it and they're like, oh, okay, this is.
00:40:53.854 - 00:40:56.314, Speaker A: Innovation happens one death at a time, right?
00:40:56.974 - 00:41:33.894, Speaker C: That's such a good point. I feel like regulators by default are pessimistic because, yeah, in a non transparent financial system with, like, you have to kind of assume everyone's like, evil. Brings me back to something you said earlier about efficiency, that ultimately consumers value efficiency and the market. Thats how you win the market. Do you think that were undergoing a paradigm shift with this bank runs that now people really wake up to this idea of, I actually now understand what happens when I deposit into a bank and then that eventually. Now do you think, is that too optimistic?
00:41:34.074 - 00:42:08.774, Speaker B: This is where I'm pessimistic, right? Like, I'm pessimistic that the average person, that we're gonna be able to educate everyone into caring enough about what we care about, right. That they will be like, oh, I get now why this is a good thing, right? Like, you know, there's a battle in the market, and the battle in the market is like, you need to be the most efficient. You need to be the cheapest, best solution or whatever. You need to be ten x better than the incumbent. And then people will use you. People are never going to care how you did that. Like, a small group of enthusiasts will care.
00:42:08.774 - 00:42:17.994, Speaker B: The average person doesn't care. And so, you know, people right now caught up about bank runs. You know, in two weeks time, it'll be, you know, whatever some other.
00:42:18.114 - 00:42:25.574, Speaker A: Okay, so, Kane, what will make Defi a ten x better, better experience than opening up a Robinhood app and trading?
00:42:27.074 - 00:43:07.268, Speaker B: So this is, this is something where I think we in crypto, including myself, were overly optimistic about. I tweeted about this a little while ago that if you want to decentralize a Nasdaq doing it as this guerrilla warfare is just not going to work. I think we kind of thought. I kind of thought maybe it was worth a try. Let's see if maybe we can go and decentralize the Nasdaq without them noticing. I just don't think that's a thing, really. I think that what we need to do is decentralize the things that we can and show that the delta between the things that we can decentralize and the stuff that's not decentralized.
00:43:07.268 - 00:43:43.004, Speaker B: And this has kind of crept into the zeitgeist a little bit. There are people like, wait a second, do we really need to shut off trading every day? What if we had continuous trading, or do we really need three day settlement? What if we had one day settlement? When you put some market pressure on something, all of a sudden people are like, oh, actually, maybe there is a better way of doing it. It's going to take a while, I think, before we decentralized the Nasdaq, but I think we can get efficient, decentralized trading of all of the crypto assets. Let's solve that problem first, and then we can start talking about equities and things like that.
00:43:43.544 - 00:44:03.834, Speaker C: I want to get your take on stablecoins. I know synthetix has its own s. USD has been around for a while, and that feels like the Achilles heel here of defi. Talk about efficiency. People don't care. They'll just use tether and USDC because they work great and they have the best liquidity. What's your vision for stablecoins?
00:44:06.774 - 00:44:56.912, Speaker B: There is a theory out there that was, I think probably Arthur Hayes was the first one to espouse this, that there is a better decentralized stablecoin than what we've got now, which is basically this baseless trade, perpetual future backed bitcoin. In his case, bitcoin. He still hasn't quite got off the bitcoin maxi train yet, but we'll get him there eventually. He's slowly, slowly, slowly migrating to the promised land. But the idea is this asset, and it's the most deeply liquid 24/7 market, and basically construct a stable coin that uses that as its backing. There's a couple of issues with that. One is that bitcoin isn't natively on Ethereum blockchain, and obviously the stable coin needs to be on Ethereum blockchain.
00:44:56.912 - 00:45:30.214, Speaker B: So you've got a couple of issues there. So I think his solution is you go and look at centralized exchanges, et cetera. Again, he's not quite we can't be looking at centralized exchanges as a way to build a decentralized, stable coin. So the alternative is, okay, well, get ETH perpetual futures. Perpetual futures that are running on decentralized exchanges on ETH natively and use them as the underlying collateral, have this basis trade. That to me makes a lot more sense. We're not quite there yet.
00:45:30.214 - 00:46:30.884, Speaker B: We're getting close. Now, whether that will even work is kind of an open question. Like, is it even a thing that's by viable? Like, but it may be, and we have the technology to test it now. I think we're getting close to being able to test it. I think one of the other potential avenues is just a central bank digital currency comes along. Maybe for Australia is even playing around with this thought about like, okay, what if you use something like that, which kind of, you know, it's not, Australia's not as neutral as say, like Switzerland, you know, it was like, you know, CBDC or CHF or whatever, but like, you could potentially use that as a way of collateralizing something, you know, provided, like the issue was credibly neutral. And it's like backed by central bank because like fundamentally, you know, what do people want? What are people worried about now? And there is.
00:46:30.884 - 00:47:07.994, Speaker B: Coins are worried about like, how safe is the collateral, right? And, you know, central bank digital currency is fairly safe. It's certainly safer than where the money is with tether or circle, right? Right. Now you would say, you know, because it's issued by central bank, right? Like, it's narrow banking with central bank. Like, I think the US isn't quite there yet, but like, it's possible that, you know, some, some smaller nations that are still in the g 20 or whatever could start playing around with this stuff and that could end up being like, pretty useful collateral. So there's, there's still experiments to be run here on, like, how do we collateralize a stable coin?
00:47:09.174 - 00:47:24.698, Speaker A: Santiago, I know you have a couple other questions. Kane, I want to get your take on. I saw you tweet out about why FTX is the greatest thing for Defi. So I don't know if you, and like you mentioned these two words, centralized insanity earlier, I don't know if you covered all the, all the things you wanted to mention earlier, but I did just want to dig into that a.
00:47:24.706 - 00:48:23.616, Speaker B: Little more with you. Well, I think there's two things, right? You know, every cycle, people, again, this is default pessimism, right? People are like, well, no one's going to be able to supplant x. Like Poloni X 2016 or whatever. Like, people, like, polo's, like, dominant, and, you know, okay, coinbase has, like, the US market, blah, blah, blah, right? And then it was like, you know, and then binance kind of came and destroyed everyone, right? And people are like, how is that possible to finance in like, eleven months or whatever could become the dominant exchange? It's like, well, they just listed every shitcoin, right? Like, that's a very obvious playbook, right? Like, they do things that no one else is willing to do. And, you know, that people want to trade and they'll go, you know, they'll eventually migrate to the place, which is letting them trade, you know, the stuff that they want to be able to trade. But then I remember, like, vividly in 2018, people were like, well, that's the last time that anyone could ever supply, you know, like, become the biggest exchange. Binance is it, and it will be to the end of time.
00:48:23.616 - 00:49:39.774, Speaker B: And then this scrappy little FTX thing pops up and people are like, huh, okay, now they've got perpetual futures and they've got all this stuff, and they started taking on a whole bunch of things and gave people leverage or whatever. Now, who knows how much of the customer acquisition costs were, like, subsidized by the customer's own money? We may never know the answer to that. If you're just losing money constantly to people, they're probably going to migrate to your exchange because everyone's going to be like, this is the greatest place to trade ever. We don't really know how much Alameda just hemorrhaging money to all the traders on FBX was a driver of growth. But the reality is that we are now in a situation where there isn't really a dominant exchange like there's binance. Right? But, I mean, binance got their own problems, right? But binance has already been beaten by the last guy, but then the last guy blew up, and so now it's like, well, we know Binance can be beaten, right? So then it's a question of, like, who can beat binance? Is it going to be a centralized exchange? Well, maybe binance can be beaten by decentralized exchange or a group of decentralized exchanges, or by the regulator, or by the regulator, or by combination.
00:49:41.484 - 00:49:44.344, Speaker C: Sorry. Speaking of that, what do you think of base?
00:49:47.124 - 00:50:06.904, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I think base is interesting. You know, when we talk about ecosystems, right? We're going to have an ecosystem of all twos, right? And base will be in that ecosystem now. Right? And base has a lot of. Just to be clear, like Coinbase is l two. That's based on op stack. Right.
00:50:06.904 - 00:50:30.844, Speaker B: Like, they've got a lot of customers. Right. You know, they just do. So, you know, taking the best tech stack, arguably. Right. For an l two, and jamming a bunch of customers in, there is definitely a playbook that could work really effectively. Right.
00:50:30.844 - 00:50:46.130, Speaker B: Then it's a question, I guess, from the optimism side of like, how effective is the super chain concept of like a chain of chains where everything kind of boils down. Obviously Bates talked about not launching their own token. We've heard that story a million times.
00:50:46.242 - 00:50:46.974, Speaker C: Themselves.
00:50:47.594 - 00:51:14.762, Speaker B: Themselves. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I think we need to take that with a grain of salt on some level. But because I still believe that absent a token, it's hard to coordinate something in a centralized way. And Coinbase may not have figured that out yet, but whatever, we'll see what happens there. And so you now have three or four different l two s, and then there's zk stuff that's coming around.
00:51:14.762 - 00:51:32.964, Speaker B: There's a whole bunch of things that are ready to accommodate a lot of customers, and one of them already has a bunch of customers. It is the most viable customer acquisition strategy is transfer them from your old tech to your new tech. Hopefully you don't lose too many of them on the way over.
00:51:33.074 - 00:51:42.884, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you think that something like that is what sparks the next bull run as compound liquidity mining program did for Defi summer?
00:51:43.304 - 00:52:30.856, Speaker B: It certainly seems like it could be. Of all the things that could spark that, just dumping whatever, tens of millions of customers into an l two and being like, hey, look at this thing. Isn't this cool? You know, I think that that could work. But to go back to the earlier question about like, infrastructure, right. That only works if you've got like, solid wallet infrastructure and, you know, ease of use of like, all these different things, like, you know, you know, socialized recovery and now maybe base, because it comes from centralized placements, got Kyc and has customer information, like maybe there'll be some ways they can like be a hybrid. You know, certainly a hybrid centralized, decentralized network. Right.
00:52:30.856 - 00:52:43.284, Speaker B: Has some advantages. We saw that would be a c. Right. You know, so base will have some advantages, I would say, right. That, you know, it's got, it's got user information, it's got some stuff that it can do. So it's going to be a very interesting experiment.
00:52:43.664 - 00:53:09.364, Speaker A: Last time you were on Empire, six months ago, we started the conversation by talking about like, in each cycle there's a different metric that people care about. So in 2017, the metric was amount of money that you raised. In 2020, it was TVL. And your thesis at least six, seven months ago was in the next cycle, it'll be cash flow that the protocol is actually spitting off. Do you still think that seven months later?
00:53:10.504 - 00:53:23.670, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's only been bedded down more. Right. Like, you look at, you know, we had crypto fees back then. Defi Llama now has, you know, their own version of that. There's other people that are building it. I do think that, like, Defi.
00:53:23.670 - 00:53:49.658, Speaker B: Defi Llama, you know, started as like a, you know, sort of competitor, Defi pulse, right, which was a TVL dashboard. I do think a dashboard that just focuses on that one metric, you know, is kind of a shelling point. People kind of go to it and now we're in this weird thing. It's obviously a harder thing to track than just Tbl. Tbl. You just look at. Do a contract call and it's just there.
00:53:49.658 - 00:54:05.226, Speaker B: Right. So there's some nuance about how you count things. So it's not as easy. It's a little bit more of a sophisticated metric. But I do think that people are coming around this idea and sort of seeing it as a place to compete. Yeah.
00:54:05.410 - 00:54:19.674, Speaker A: Do you ever think about optimizing, like, when you and the team and community are building synthetix and folks are building on top? Like, how much does that sort of belief about what folks will value in the future dictate how you build the product?
00:54:21.014 - 00:54:39.780, Speaker B: I think that revenue is the real metric. This is the difference. This is where we're kind of getting to a point where it's no longer nonsense. Tbl was kind of nonsensical, but it was the only thing we could track. There wasn't anything else to track. Now it's like, well, we can track revenue. Like that's the end game, right? You need to be able to generate revenue.
00:54:39.780 - 00:54:51.260, Speaker B: But until you can generate revenue, when no one's generating revenue, just like, come up with other metrics, compete with each other, right? But now it's like, no, like, you hold this token, you get this revenue.
00:54:51.412 - 00:54:54.144, Speaker A: How do you think about. Yeah, go ahead.
00:54:54.804 - 00:54:55.628, Speaker B: That's it.
00:54:55.756 - 00:55:24.664, Speaker A: I was going to say. I mean, as someone who thinks about, like, a block works building dashboards that could track fees and things like that. Like, one thing that we're talking about internally is, you know, not all revenue is treated equally, just like not all TVL is treated equally. So, like, using Uniswap revenue, for example, like, do you count all of Uniswap's revenue? Do you only count revenue that they eventually probably send back to token holders? Like, or back to the, back to the protocol? How do you think about revenue across different protocols and different projects?
00:55:25.684 - 00:56:03.092, Speaker B: This is where I think the nuance comes in, right? Because it's real. You don't need nuance when it's a nonsensical game that everyone's playing against each other, right? Like even within TBL. But really it was just like how many assets are in there, right? You know, maybe there was like take out the cut, the token, you know, the internal token of the project. Like carve that out. Maybe that was the only carve out of like, oh, well, let's not count the project's token, let's only count like ETH. But that didn't even really work that well, right? Like I remember Defi pulse had like a just show me like the 8th amount that's locked and everyone's like, ah, fuck, I don't care about that. I want to see the top line number, right? Like whoever has 10 billion or whatever.
00:56:03.092 - 00:56:46.136, Speaker B: So this is a much more nuanced question. And it'll be up to the dashboard, I guess, probably to set those expectations right and try and be neutral. And again, it's now like a market problem, right? Like if one of the dashboards makes a bad decision and starts tracking something that's really gameable and everyone games it and they don't bothered to try and fix that, then someone else will probably pop up and be like, well, I'm going to carve out that gamed metric because this is showing the wrong thing. And then now you got some competition. But competition in crypto is still hideously inefficient. So how long does that take before someone steps up and says, well, wait a second, no, this is not right, let's fix this. It could take a while.
00:56:46.320 - 00:56:59.824, Speaker C: I mean, this sort of assumes that people even care or value these things on cash flow. It took 100 years to develop formal valuation methodologies for stocks. Its probably crazy to think that crypto is trading on any substance of fundamentals.
00:57:00.284 - 00:57:21.430, Speaker A: But even in traditional capital markets outside of crypto were on the other side of this big vc bubble bursting. Even if you look at those very hyped up venture backed tech companies, the Ubers and lyfts of the world, they are, you know, if you look at what their board is telling them to do, they're telling them to race towards profitability too. I don't think it's just a crypto thing.
00:57:21.622 - 00:57:41.246, Speaker B: No. So sorry, just to be clear, I think to Sandy's point and this, I think it's not like we're going to value these things on cash flow. We're going to pick winners based on cash flow and revenue. Right. The price to earnings is going to be like nonsensical. Right. There's no question there.
00:57:41.246 - 00:58:01.516, Speaker B: Right. Right. It's going to be like 1000 x versus 950 x or something like that. Right. PE or price of sales, depending on how you want it, whatever. But it's going to be, the winners will be determined by who has the most revenue. And that's where there is nuance.
00:58:01.516 - 00:58:23.604, Speaker B: Because Uniswap has the most revenue or did for a while had the most revenue of a DeFi protocol. Right. I think there's some argument about like Op, where does that fit in? Network, et cetera. But Uniswap for a long time, but it has zero revenue for token holders. So do you show zero or do you show $3 million a day, whatever, which one is it?
00:58:24.784 - 00:59:12.574, Speaker C: And feel free to answer this question or not. But do you think that we've been in this specifically on the unitoken like fee switch or not? It's been heavily discussed among particularly large holders, which are venture backed, like our VC's, based in the US. Turning on a fee has implications that a crypto lawyer might say, wait a minute, that might then look like a security, which has always been like this problem in crypto. We have done a lot of architectural choices and trade offs because of this security thing. I'm curious to get your opinion on that scenario. One, we continue on this path, at some point we get some regulatory policy whatnot. Or option b, we get clarity.
00:59:12.574 - 00:59:27.754, Speaker C: Say all of these things are securities. You got to register. You got to do information disclosures. Is that scenario terribly bad where crypto no longer becomes a viable thing? Like a lot of startups just die because token issuers just can't issue a token because it's heavily problematic.
00:59:28.554 - 00:59:52.570, Speaker B: I think there's an option c, right. Which is that, you know, for the foreseeable future, regulators do not provide clarity. Right. But also say, you know, I mean, they are already kind of providing clarity. They're saying, like, you should all register, right? Yet no one's scrambling to register. Right. And the reason why not? Because everyone sitting here saying, no, we are securities.
00:59:52.570 - 01:01:00.404, Speaker B: We're just, you know, thumbing our nose at the law and saying, we're not going to registered because there's a fundamental ideological disagreement about what these things are. Right. And then there's a question of like, okay, so who registers? In the case of synthetix, there's no entities, right? There's a DAO token holders, vote people in. Like, you know, the synthetix governance is one of the most decentralized governance frameworks that exist, right? Like, it's not even governance theater. Like, there's still components which are a bit centralized in terms of like deployments and stuff, but in terms of how decisions are made, it's about as decentralized as you can get. And so the question is, like, who registers? Who even can decide to register? What does that even look like? And I think the onus is kind of on the regulator to say, if there is a thing that looks like this and we're saying register, and it is fundamentally incompatible with the thing, something broken here, you need to come up with a new definition or a new, you know, pathway for that thing to do the thing that you want it to do. Right? There's no entity, there's no corporation, you know, in Delaware that's saying, yep, it's us.
01:01:00.404 - 01:01:30.364, Speaker B: We're going to register this thing. And, you know, it's our efforts that are generating, you know, profit for, you know, token holders or whatever. Like, that doesn't exist in a lot of these. It does in some cases, but it doesn't in a lot of cases. And so I think that that could. If, if that really, you know, starts to accelerate, which I think it is, it pushes people more towards option c, which is look more like a thing that doesn't have the ability to register, then look like thing that's refusing to register in spite of the pressure.
01:01:30.864 - 01:02:16.584, Speaker A: Kane, as we think about the next bull market, can we just tie this all back to synthetics, actually? So you guys have. I mean, I think Santi and I have both. I mean, Santi even more intimately, but like, we've watched your evolution from like this application that started with a focus on spot synthetix and then now is really like this infrastructure liquidity layer and we've block works folks have gotten pretty close to like Quenta and Lira and Dhedge and all these folks who have leveraged what you guys have built and have built these really successful applications on top. What is the. Can you talk about v three a little bit? And I've got this dune dashboard up called synthetic Stack Synthetix stats. And the numbers are just ripping, right? There's like 100 million on March 9, 500 million on March 17. I don't know if this is tied in at all with, like, the banking crisis, but the number.
01:02:16.584 - 01:02:24.484, Speaker A: Or maybe it's just with the new launch of V three and stuff like that, but. Of V two. But anyways, tell me about V three and what's coming.
01:02:25.224 - 01:03:09.600, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's. There's kind of like, versions within versions, and synthetics, like Ethereum probably doesn't do a great job of, you know, version versioning or like, what they are or whatever. You know, it's all a big confusing and convoluted. But we have the perps product version, one of which was pretty useless, which I will put my hand up and say, I had a lot of say in how that was designed. And then we have V two, which is actually quite useful and does the thing that it's supposed to do, which launched recently. But perps V two is just a product that's built on the synthetix liquidity engine, if you will. Right.
01:03:09.600 - 01:03:51.890, Speaker B: You know, it's just an internal product that's developed in the same way that, like, Lyra taps into synthetics liquidity or, you know, whoever, right. You know, they like all of these different things. Like, it's just a thing that was built by Synthetix to tap into the liquidity, and that's the old liquidity, right? Like, that's the existing synthetic system that's been around since, you know, late 2018 or whatever. Synthetix V three is basically a complete redesign of that liquidity engine. And that redesign will allow for all of these projects that are already pulling that liquidity to do it much more efficiently. There's a whole bunch of advantages. So it's a reimagining of how a liquidity layer could function.
01:03:51.890 - 01:04:29.564, Speaker B: Now, alongside that, there's going to be improvements to the perps product, which, again, is just a product that's bought bolted onto that liquidity layer. They're independent. Someone could turn up tomorrow, really, and build their own implementation of perks and bolt it onto the liquidity layer because it's permissionless. In fact, I expect that something like that may happen. But from the synthetics token holders perspective, that's great. What you want is more things bolting onto this liquidity layer, because the liquidity layer is what is generating the fees. That's the thing that charges for access to itself.
01:04:29.564 - 01:04:35.360, Speaker B: And synthetix holders are the ones that back that, and they're the ones that get the benefit from it. Nice.
01:04:35.512 - 01:04:40.084, Speaker A: What's the toughest part about this? Getting folks to build on top, or getting the traders?
01:04:41.264 - 01:05:47.396, Speaker B: I think historically it's been getting a product that works. We've had multiple iterations that just didn't work or had, like, significant flaws. And so when you, when you have a product that has flaws, typically what we found, I think, is in practice, the flaws mean that it can't scale, right? Like, that's what I think, you know, you can kind of do it for a while and it works and, you know, until someone notices the flaw and they really try and, like, scale it up and they start exploiting it, you know, so, like, oracle latency was a thing that, you know, oracle latency existed for years, right? And we all just kind of like, looked the other way and just used it or whatever. And then one day someone turned up, they're like, hey, I could maybe exploit this article latency and then a whole bunch of bad things that happened in July 2019 or whatever and kind of kept happening. And we've seen oracle latency exploited in multiple protocols. And so then you go, okay, well, now we're going to change the way the oracles work or whatever. So there's this iterative game of like, you do a thing and there's some inefficiencies, and then people start exploiting those inefficiencies and then you fix them, and then you go and fix part of it.
01:05:47.396 - 01:06:16.106, Speaker B: So we're at a point now where I think we've fixed a lot of the inefficiencies and arc latency isn't an issue. Probably the biggest issue for synthetics right now, I would say is like, liquidity is an issue. We don't have sufficient liquidity. 50 million SUSD and I think 100 million total since is not enough to be the dominant perp trading venue for the world. We need to scale up significantly.
01:06:16.210 - 01:06:26.534, Speaker A: Have you guys ever thought about launching your own chain? After looking at what DyDX is doing, local fee markets, capture the mev, try to get closer to the user. Is that on your roadmap at all?
01:06:28.154 - 01:07:01.154, Speaker B: We definitely thought about it. There was the power chain thing. I was at a talk that I think when Polkadot launched, or ran about the time when Gavin was launching Polkadot, and it was like, okay, parachains, this is interesting. Now it hasn't gone anywhere for whatever, for a number of reasons. The biggest downside to an app chain, in my mind, is composability. People really did not understand the value of composability. I think even early Defi people didn't really understand the value of components.
01:07:01.154 - 01:07:33.938, Speaker B: It turns out it's significantly more valuable than it even seems like it should be. On paper, and I think we valued it highly, but just not as highly as we should have. And so the question for, I guess, optimism, for example, with this super chain idea and with base and maybe other chains that are connected to the super chain, is how do we ensure composability? Or how do we kind of get something that's close or approximates composability? Because if you break composability, what we've seen is that is a significant utility.
01:07:33.986 - 01:07:39.602, Speaker A: For users, for someone listening who doesn't understand why composability is so important, what is that?
01:07:39.778 - 01:08:24.384, Speaker B: Why? So if you, the interesting thing, and I said this about Dydx, Dydx had the luxury of actually camping out and building their own little silo. It was almost like a decentralized, centralized thing. It was like DC fi or something like that, instead of CDFI or whatever. And it was like, we're decentralized, we're non custodial, but we're running on a computer in someone's house, and the worst case is if someone shuts down the computer, you can get your funds out. It'll take a while. You got to send a letter to the house, and then whatever it was, this whole convoluted scheme, no one knew how to write the language. Just ignore that for a second.
01:08:24.384 - 01:08:24.768, Speaker B: Right.
01:08:24.856 - 01:08:29.084, Speaker C: But the idea was no reply at DyDX. Yeah, exactly.
01:08:29.744 - 01:09:37.080, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Or no reply, like, you know, stockware headquarters in Israel or whatever. But anyway, so, like, the point, the point was that, like, we weren't controlling your funds, but we were controlling kind of every aspect of how the system operated, right? But they could do that because all people wanted was like, fast trading, right? They just wanted, like, deep liquidity, fast execution, you know, a lot of different options to trade. And, you know, so DyDX, interestingly, was like the kind of, you know, 2017 centralized exchange playbook of, like, you know, only list ten assets or whatever, but just be really, like, liquid. And, you know, then someone else comes along, finance, and says, well, why don't we have 100 assets, right? And people like, well, actually you have the ten assets that I want to trade with the other 90. And so you kind of migrate away, right? So that's like, it is just an interesting thing to think that, like, they were kind of doing the centralized exchange playbook from like, 2015, 2016, or whatever, of like, be really deeply liquid, but they didn't need composability because you were just literally, you just wanted to trade. You wanted to go and trade e perps.
01:09:37.080 - 01:10:33.038, Speaker B: That was it. Right? Whereas if you were, let's say, aave and you wanted to have a lending market, but people were doing weird stuff with ETH and there was no way for them to take their wrapped ETH derivative and put it into your protocol because you were off in your own silo. That's a huge impediment to growth that would have not really worked. So DyDX had the luxury of going and parking themselves in this little of centralized app chain that they build, because it didn't really diminish the utility. But for almost every other protocol it would have, because not being able to move assets between and create linkages and things like that wouldn't really have worked. Now, the interesting thing is that what I think we've realized now is the composability for a purpose exchange is actually valuable. But we didn't know because we didn't have all of this composability.
01:10:33.038 - 01:10:59.174, Speaker B: And so we're seeing with synthetix that like synthetix having composability and being a liquid purpose exchange or GMX or whatever is actually beneficial because people start building stuff that feeds into that cross margining and other cool things that just couldn't exist on DyDX because you can't cross margin it because you're in your own silo. And so I think that like that is where we're seeing that like composability has value, but you don't see it until you build cool stuff and, and it works.
01:10:59.514 - 01:12:04.726, Speaker C: Would you say that that's one of the things that like composability in DeFi is a beautiful thing? Flash loans and cross. Like it just the ability to innovate is, is incredible, but it feels like super early still. Like it requires a level of sophistication. Like you've seen the meme. Like you take this as, and like it's pretty, like it's crazy to think, but like I would say, like it's limited to maybe 1000 users that are really taking advantage of composability. Is this something that you think over time will play up and really differentiate DeFi where maybe the aggregator, the wallet or the financial institutions really takes advantage? Because there's this whole, as you said, ecosystem that is being built on top of synthetix, but it's too early. And you just sort of building with like a very core set of crazy spartans, which has, by the way, historically been the case, hoping that one day like all these kind of innovations come out of composability, so you can do.
01:12:04.910 - 01:12:26.854, Speaker B: DIY composability which is cool, right? Like, that was, you know, that was like, d five summer. Yeah. Those people being like, oh, okay, I'm just gonna build my own thing, aggregate stuff, whatever. So that was. That's definitely a thing, and that's always available, and that's how the experiments happen. Right. But if you look at composability, the best example, I think, still historically, of composability is, like, instadap.
01:12:26.854 - 01:13:04.528, Speaker B: Instadap just said, hey, there's, like, an interest rate arbitrage between, you know, maker and compound. And people want leverage, and they don't care. You know, they just want the cheapest thing, right? And then one inch probably was then the next best example of, like, people just want to trade, and there's, like, 50 different places where liquidity is pooled. Why don't we just put a layer on top of that, and we can start? And that worked amazingly well. And now you have cowswap, and there's all kinds of stuff. So I think that initial experimentation is always kind of DIY. Like, you just have to turn up and just test stuff out, but then you can systematize it over time.
01:13:04.528 - 01:13:25.426, Speaker B: The insta that guys built that in a hackathon, and we're like, what if we could just click a button, go from compound to maker or maker to compound, and then they're like, well, why don't we put an interface over that? And all of a sudden, they had, like, $5 billion of TVL or a billion dollars, something like that, right? So, yeah, you know, people will systematize composability after the experiments demonstrate value or utility.
01:13:25.570 - 01:13:44.134, Speaker C: Maybe for a skeptical listener that went through the kind of the global financial crisis, might say, wait. Wait a minute. I've seen this movie before. Like, you talk about efficiency. Great. Which I fundamentally think composability makes defi really efficient. These arbs are exploited very quickly, and so it makes a more efficient system.
01:13:44.134 - 01:14:02.054, Speaker C: The counter argument of that is, wait a minute. You built a really fragile house of cards here, where as soon as you start piling up these Legos or Jenga Tower, one brick goes down, shit hits the fan, everything goes down. What is your response to someone that thinks that as he listens to you talk about composability?
01:14:02.804 - 01:15:13.606, Speaker B: So, I think that the difference is that the opacity, you know, all of the connectivity in the GFC, right, between different things, was undermined on some level, or the risk of connectivity was exacerbated by the opacity of each of the things. Right? Like, you couldn't go in and infect the state of, you know. Now you're laughing, right? But like, so like, you know, in Defi, if everything has its own risk management structure, right? Like if maker has good risk management, good liquidation practices or whatever, it shouldn't matter what it's connected to, right? Yeah. Like it should just have an efficient thing. Now there is an argument to be made that like if ETH is the reserve of all these things and ETH goes to zero, well then they all go to zero. I don't think there's a way that you can remove that more fundamental issue, fundamental problem. In the same way that if the dollar goes to zero, then all banks or whatever, if there's fear, there are legitimate things that you just can't avoid.
01:15:13.606 - 01:15:33.172, Speaker B: But if every silo of liquidity has its own risk management practices that are transparent and then you connect them, can bad things happen? 100%. Right. Is it much less risky than connecting a bunch of opaque, centralized things to each other 100%, absolutely.
01:15:33.308 - 01:16:01.336, Speaker C: Well, yeah, I was laughing more so because you talked about oracle problems in Defi. I was just thinking of the scene in the big short where like they're looking at the housing like bubble is bursting and like the CD, like the instrument that they were like using to short the housing hadn't moved. And it's like guys like this is fraudulent. Like they're calling Goldman saying guys like update this thing. Like the housing crisis, just like the housing bubble just burst and the index hadn't moved. So anyways, it's just interesting.
01:16:01.400 - 01:16:05.924, Speaker B: Well, yeah, when the Oracle provider lives in one of those silos, right. Or like a couple of them.
01:16:08.064 - 01:16:44.174, Speaker C: When they have a huge book that they need to offload. Yeah, they're going to delay the oracle for a bit. Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, I hope. I mean it's so great having you on because you have a very sober take, I think, but also optimistic, one in many ways a balanced view. As someone that's been around for such a long time and you've gone through a few pivots and I guess as we round out, I do want to just do a quick fire round questions, but I don't know if there's anything else you want to cover on the synthetics front or things that you're excited about generally you're investing in recently, before we go to the fire round.
01:16:44.874 - 01:17:28.830, Speaker B: No, I think fundamentally I'm excited that we now have the infrastructure that we've been looking for for a long time. And I think the thing that shifted for me and constantly defi forces you to learn lessons. One of the lessons I've learned is that a single solution to a problem is actually not a viable marketplace. And this is probably the lesson from optimism, I would say, is that in order to be a credible alternative to the incumbents, you need an ecosystem of solutions, right. With different trade offs. And I think that that's where we're at now. Like there's an ecosystem of l two s within the ethereum ecosystem, sub ecosystem of l two s that is viable.
01:17:28.830 - 01:18:14.676, Speaker B: The same thing is true of like wallet providers. I think we need like, we can't just have like a single, even though that would be the, you know, optimal solution, is just have like one wallet that does all the things and one l two that does all the things. I just think that's not realistic to expect and that it's better to have an ecosystem and that exists now. And so I think we're in a position where, you know, if the market starts to rip up, you know, this year or next year or whatever, that we're going to be in a place where we can finally do what we've said we would be able to do, which is actually provide an experience that's better than a centralized exchange and not on some like, you know, metric that no one cares about. Right? Like, oh, we're not going to like, you know, fraudulently steal all your money. No one cares about that money moving up. Like actually on the things that people care about.
01:18:14.676 - 01:18:31.876, Speaker B: Like, we've got better assets, we've got better liquidity, we've got better utility, we've got better, you know, whatever, uptime. Like, we've got all these things that are actually the metrics people care about. And not like, hey, we're worse in every way, except we won't steal your money because it turns out people don't care about that. They'll give it to the guy who's going to steal their money.
01:18:31.980 - 01:18:35.250, Speaker C: On the efficiency score, as you said. Yeah, faster, better, cheaper.
01:18:35.322 - 01:18:35.930, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:18:36.042 - 01:18:42.574, Speaker C: All right, man, this has been great. Let's do a quick fire round. Five, six. Questions. What's been your worst trade?
01:18:46.354 - 01:18:55.130, Speaker B: I sold several thousand ETH at about $7 in 2017. That was probably my worst trade.
01:18:55.322 - 01:18:56.734, Speaker A: It's a pretty bad trade.
01:18:58.714 - 01:19:00.374, Speaker C: I feel the pain spill.
01:19:00.794 - 01:19:04.454, Speaker B: I had a good reason. I've been there. In hindsight, it was not a good.
01:19:04.554 - 01:19:10.394, Speaker C: Yeah, well, Dallas hold the tongue at 18 and then went back to eight. Nine. Yeah, good times. Best trade.
01:19:13.934 - 01:19:19.874, Speaker B: My best trade is probably sticking with us. Next. Nice.
01:19:20.694 - 01:19:24.874, Speaker C: How many hours of sleep do you get now? And is it more or less than it was two years ago.
01:19:26.094 - 01:19:34.754, Speaker B: It's a lot more. I used to sleep four or 5 hours a night. Now I try and get like seven or 8 hours sleep. I've realized value of sleep.
01:19:35.334 - 01:19:39.606, Speaker C: Is that because your kids are getting older or just because, you know, it's.
01:19:39.630 - 01:19:49.134, Speaker B: Probably a little bit, but also, like, I've made a, like, concerted effort to get more sleep. It's something that I just didn't focus on. Nice.
01:19:49.294 - 01:19:54.914, Speaker C: Can't help but notice a bunch of really nice musical equipment back there. What's your, what's your favorite song?
01:19:56.854 - 01:20:03.994, Speaker B: My favorite song. My favorite song of all time is probably the diamond Sea by sonic youth. Nice.
01:20:05.534 - 01:20:12.434, Speaker C: And perhaps last two, what's your best advice for someone that is in crypto or looking to get into crypto?
01:20:14.334 - 01:20:45.454, Speaker B: I think if you're looking to get into crypto, find something that excites you that people are sort of pessimistic on. Right? Like, find a problem that you're excited by that you can you put some optimism towards that. You know, the consensus is, like, this is not a thing because oftentimes it is, and that's where the opportunities lie.
01:20:46.714 - 01:21:01.514, Speaker C: That's awesome, Cain, thanks for coming on. Always a treat having you and really appreciate the time. If anyone wants to learn more about what you're doing or about synthetix, what are the best kind of ways to follow you?
01:21:01.814 - 01:21:08.230, Speaker B: I mean, synthetix discord's always fun place to hang out. Be careful going to PGen trading, but.
01:21:08.342 - 01:21:10.594, Speaker C: Everyone else is pretty safe.
01:21:11.294 - 01:21:16.550, Speaker B: And then you can follow me on Twitter by my Twitter handle.
01:21:16.622 - 01:21:18.082, Speaker C: Well, post in the show notes.
01:21:18.278 - 01:21:18.730, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:21:18.802 - 01:21:20.054, Speaker C: Awesome, sir. Thanks.
01:21:20.634 - 01:21:21.874, Speaker B: Yeah, appreciate you. Thanks, guys.
