00:00:00.640 - 00:00:28.426, Speaker A: Fundamentally, AI agents are programmable, so they can leverage other interfaces to do things that they want. So one of the interfaces that they can use is the blockchain, and they can do this permissionlessly. So, for example, they can use ETH as the AI native money, or they can interact with DeFi, or they can play games. And if they do that, they can do that permissionlessly and no one can stop them. So that can get a little bit scary.

All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Very lucky to be joined by Chow Wang from Alliance today. Chow, welcome back to the show, man.
00:01:02.354 - 00:01:03.570, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:01:03.722 - 00:01:26.242, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, of course. One of my favorite. You're one of my favorite people to talk to about broader, just how you're feeling about the market, kind of state of the market and what you're seeing. Really interesting and unique background from alliance. I think there are kind of like three places that we could go in this conversation. There's almost like state of the market. We're 1820 months into this bear market now.
00:01:26.242 - 00:01:58.244, Speaker B: Would love to maybe like, just kick it off with how you're feeling about things. There's also a conversation around, like, I think you and some of the team have been leading the conversation around AI and crypto and the intersection. Those two kinds of things converging, it feels like. And then there's a third bucket, which is you have this really unique experience from alliance, seeing what chains that teams are building on and what teams are building and why they're having success and why a lot of them maybe aren't having success. So I'd like to go there as well. But let's kick it off with high level, um, 18, 1920 months into the bear market. How are you feeling about the market today?
00:01:59.784 - 00:02:41.694, Speaker A: Um, so there's, uh, several aspects we can talk about. One is, um, on the, uh, venture side of things, on the private primary market, it's basically dead. Um, I don't know if you saw the chart from. I think it was, um, the falama, about the month by month venture funding in crypto. I think we're at the lowest level since the last bear market in terms of dollar amount, and I don't even know if it's the bottom. And no one is in a rush to write checks right now. So valuations are going down still.
00:02:41.694 - 00:03:30.500, Speaker A: And fundamentally it's just the fact that the private market generally lags the public market by maybe two, three, four quarters. So even if bitcoin has gone up two x this year, the private market has been bleeding actually slowly. So that's what I'm seeing in the primary market. Founders are having a very hard time fundraising public market. I really don't know. I mean, today bitcoin is trading at 30,000 and it feels a little bit heavy because we couldn't pump on good news. So we had really good bitcoin ETF news, we had the XRP news, which was a huge victory, and somehow we can go above 30k.
00:03:30.500 - 00:03:48.944, Speaker A: So it's a little bit worrisome. And then on the macro side, I have no idea. Half a year ago, people were really bearish. It was the most anticipated recession of all time. But then today people are like, oh, maybe we're going to get the soft landing. I have no idea. I don't have an edge in that market.
00:03:48.944 - 00:03:51.592, Speaker A: So we'll see.
00:03:51.728 - 00:04:18.984, Speaker B: Yeah. Tell me more about the private markets in crypto. It strikes me that there's actually funds who might have some cash and they're sitting on some dollars. Either they are sitting on cash and don't want to deploy it, or they're almost timid to make a capital call to their lp's. It seems like that's the reason that companies aren't getting funded is they actually have the money. They just won't make the commitment and make the check. But tell me if I'm right or wrong there.
00:04:19.804 - 00:05:13.792, Speaker A: Okay, so there's a few possible reasons. I don't know for a fact, but the few possible reasons are, number one, they do have the cash, but a year ago they yolo it into a bunch of deals at ridiculous valuations and now they just can't explain to their lp's they have to do a lot more due diligence. Also, a lot of them invested in some ridiculous failures, catastrophic failures like FTX, for example. So now they're doing a lot more diligence, due diligence and they're deploying a lot slower. But they do have the money, they're just not in a rush to deploy. Another possible reason is that, again, back to the earlier point about the private market lagging the public market. So they're still feeling it out.
00:05:13.792 - 00:05:49.524, Speaker A: So everyone is aware that valuations are continuing to go down, but no one knows when it'll bottom. So no one wants to catch a falling knife. Very illiquid falling knife. So that's sort of another reason. But personally, it's really mind boggling that you would expect the vast majority of VC's to be the kind of contrarian investors be greedy when others are fearful investors. But that is not the case right now. Everyone is fearful.
00:05:49.524 - 00:06:06.784, Speaker A: Half a year ago when FTX happened, I thought that was the bottom, because I've never seen anything like that in the history of crypto. That was the worst, in my opinion, the worst event that has ever happened to crypto. I thought that was the bottom for the private market, but it was not like things are continuing to go down.
00:06:07.244 - 00:06:30.446, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I think you're seeing a real divergence in the private markets in crypto right now between the series, the seed and series A companies and the series B, series C and series D and the series C and series D are getting whacked. Valuations are cut, in some instances 90%. Right. Maybe they raised it 10 billion. Now they're raising a little chunk of change at one 1.5. Right.
00:06:30.446 - 00:06:50.020, Speaker B: They've been completely whacked. I'm actually. I don't know if you're seeing this. I'm seeing very interesting seed deals right now and I'm seeing seed deals and fundraisers get done. Right. Maybe it's a new l two or something, or maybe it's a consumer app and it's a reasonable valuation. It's 1015, $15 million.
00:06:50.020 - 00:07:04.524, Speaker B: And I think that they can just get funded purely with maybe a couple very crypto native funds putting in a million or two each and then a lot of angels. And I think those deals are happening. But the later the series B, the series C are completely dead right now.
00:07:04.684 - 00:07:38.984, Speaker A: Yep, I think that's exactly right. And the ten to 15 million range that you mentioned is spot on as what I'm seeing as well. On the seed at the c stage, preseat is probably a lot lower. Yeah, that's where we are at. For example, we prefer pre seed, but, and you're right that the later stage deals are not happening because everyone got wrecked. All the late stage VC's got wrecked that invested at the peak of the bull market. But in general, deals are, there's fewer deals.
00:07:38.984 - 00:08:23.806, Speaker A: I also feel there's fewer interesting projects and that might be a result of just fewer developer activities in the whole crypto ecosystem. So I don't know if you saw the report from Electric Capital. So they have a live data set on the number of new developers going to crypto. And the number of active developers in crypto. And those two numbers have been down 25% to 50%, respectively, from the peak, which was about a year ago. So there's fewer people building crypto right now. A lot of them are pivoting to AI, for example.
00:08:23.950 - 00:08:38.413, Speaker B: Yeah. Which we'll talk about. I'm not going to force you to predict the macro markets here, chow, but I am going to force you to give me a little prediction on crypto markets. We pulled up, if you can see. Can you see this right here?
00:08:38.873 - 00:08:39.693, Speaker A: Yep.
00:08:40.113 - 00:08:56.577, Speaker B: So Mike and I shared this. We do a company off site at blockworks every six months. We shared this at the July 2022 offsite. We said, bear markets come in four phases. Phase one is the blow up. Right? This is the complete unwind. Euphoria rolls over.
00:08:56.577 - 00:09:16.788, Speaker B: Leverage blows out. There are these rapid price changes down. And the enemy in this market is fear. Everybody is just terrified because things are collapsing so quickly. Stage two, which is where we were at in July 2022, we argued was the fallout, or maybe otherwise, said it was forced capitulation. Everyone is angry. People were looking for someone to blame.
00:09:16.788 - 00:09:54.794, Speaker B: You know, this is when a lot of angry tweets about do Kwan Mashinsky, right? And the enemy here is disenchantment. Just like, what are we doing here? Just this, you know, this is a real bummer, right? Stage three, which I would argue we've been in for the last several months, is boredom. This is bottomless exhaustion, complete silence, lack of attention. Things bullish, news happens, but nobody cares. Peak floor and attention. And the enemy here is boredom. I would argue that we are now coming out of stage three and into stage four, which Mike and I have kind of deemed the rebirth stage.
00:09:54.794 - 00:10:19.790, Speaker B: This is when sparks of hope get brushed off. This is when Ripple beats the SEC Blackrock announces a bitcoin ETF. But because the enemy in this stage is disbelief, it doesn't do anything to the market. And I'm curious where you, first off, if you agree with these stages. And then the second, more important question is, do you think that we're heading into the stage four rebirth stage right now?
00:10:19.942 - 00:10:54.414, Speaker A: Yeah. So I understand your stage one, two, three. I don't fully understand stage four, by the way. I agree with your one, two, three, but in my mind, stage four, to me, is the same stage as three. So I can't make it distinctly, but I feel like we're in the. For me, we're still in the apathy boredom phase. And you mentioned that the good news get brushed off, which is which sounds like apathy to me.
00:10:54.414 - 00:11:18.838, Speaker A: And I feel that because whenever I tweet these days, I get very little engagement. I feel like I'm yelling in the dark. No one listens to me. So I feel like we're at that stage. We're still in the. So that stage is where the market bottoms. It's a very long and arduous, lengthy, a bottoming process.
00:11:18.838 - 00:12:02.820, Speaker A: So that usually takes maybe, let's say a year, if not more, at least according to the last couple of cycles. But the thing that makes this cycle really different is the macro. The whole crypto ecosystem is a lot bigger than the last cycle, so there's a lot more wealth effect that leads to greater correlation between crypto and macro. I can't. I have a hard time predicting where the public market will go in the next six to twelve months. I think a lot of it has to do with the macro. Earlier this year, at the beginning of the year, I tweeted that I think we'll be a lot higher at the end of the year than at the beginning of the year.
00:12:02.820 - 00:12:08.864, Speaker A: And so far I'm right. But from this point on, I really don't know. I think it's really 50 50.
00:12:09.544 - 00:12:47.416, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one of the interesting things to watch next year is the proverbial fight between the macro, especially if we have a bad macro environment next year. This battle between the bad macro and the bitcoin having, because historically, crypto has obviously only existed in a pretty good macro environment. And every four years we have this bitcoin having, which the four year bull and bear market cycles are very tied into this halving. I remember exactly where I was in May 2020 having during COVID I remember the seat I was sitting in. I remember what it did to the market. I remember what was happening on Twitter that day.
00:12:47.416 - 00:13:04.288, Speaker B: And I'm looking ahead to this April, maybe May 2024 bitcoin having, which could very well kick off this next bull run. However, you've got this macro that nobody has any idea what's happening. So I think that's going to be a very interesting kind of convergence to watch there.
00:13:04.456 - 00:13:19.674, Speaker A: Yeah. So to your point, it's entirely possible that we've seen the end of the regular four year cycles. It's entirely possible that this upcoming cycle will be either shorter or longer than the usual four years.
00:13:22.174 - 00:13:35.978, Speaker B: It is. I would not bet against the four year cycles yet. I don't think we're there yet. Chad, maybe if you could give us some insight into what folks are building right now. I would love to hear this. You guys have gone through. You guys are on all eleven.
00:13:35.978 - 00:13:41.346, Speaker B: I think it is the 11th cohort. So big congrats on that. I remember when you guys were doing, doing the first one.
00:13:41.370 - 00:13:42.194, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
00:13:42.354 - 00:13:49.814, Speaker B: Yeah. What are you guys seeing right now in terms of what folks are building in all eleven? Yeah.
00:13:50.914 - 00:14:38.044, Speaker A: So things that you hear on Twitter is mostly right, that there's a lot more infrastructure projects than consumer facing products. Again, this is very cyclical. And historically, this has been the case as well, that during bear markets, people build more infrastructure than consumer products. And so currently, by infrastructure, I mean, for example, again, scaling, restaking, share sequencer, that kind of stuff. Right. Especially for the Ethereum ecosystem. But there's also a lot of infrastructure around wallets and account abstraction is a big driver of that.
00:14:38.044 - 00:15:00.104, Speaker A: In general, I feel a little bit uninspired by the startups. On the consumer side, I think there's just fewer of them. And I love to see more, and I love to see crazy ideas, ideas that piss a lot of people off, ideas that are really creative, that are potentially even outrageous.
00:15:00.564 - 00:15:04.620, Speaker B: Like social networks that embrace bots instead of pushing bots away. Yeah.
00:15:04.652 - 00:15:09.824, Speaker A: For example. Oh, by the way, so, Nikita beer this.
00:15:10.124 - 00:15:12.124, Speaker B: I don't know if you've heard of him.
00:15:12.204 - 00:15:45.476, Speaker A: Yeah, you know him. So he's one of the legends in the consumer products in web two. And he tweeted something really interesting today, which is that it's about AI, but I think it's also transferable to crypto. But what he said was that the AI consumer product startups are building something. Most of them are building things that are too obvious. So, for example, AI girlfriends. But he also said that the truly good founders are using AI to bootstrap the.
00:15:45.476 - 00:16:10.724, Speaker A: The critical mass for their dating app, if that makes sense. So if you build a dating app initially, you have a huge costar problem. You need the supply and the demand, basically, the men and the women. So how do you bootstrap that cold start problem? You use AI to do it. Use bots to do it. So, yeah, just something really interesting that I read today.
00:16:10.764 - 00:16:22.390, Speaker B: I think. That's right. And by the way, Nikita is about as smart as they get when it comes to building these consumer social apps. Right. I think he started gas app sold to Discord. What was it? He sold another one, like the b app or something. It was.
00:16:22.422 - 00:16:31.206, Speaker A: I think it's the same app. And he built it within the span of, like, over five years. So, like, five years ago, he built the first version.
00:16:31.350 - 00:17:04.994, Speaker B: Sold one to Facebook, sold one to Discord. Same apply. Yeah, exactly. So, all right, so folks are building infrastructure. I had a feeling that you're going to say that when they're building infrastructure, are they building, is this like more l two s? Is this account abstraction? Is this ZK, is this what I'd almost call deep infrastructure tech? That is very technical. Is this more like, hey, we give you a seamless way to embed account abstraction into your wallet. Tell me, let's double click on the infrastructure.
00:17:05.454 - 00:17:19.884, Speaker A: All these things that you mentioned, a lot of ZK, a lot of scaling. Layer two, sell rebranded or not rebranded, but pivoted from being a layer one to L2 last week.
00:17:20.004 - 00:17:42.574, Speaker B: I know, followed that very closely. I think that is first of many l one s actually that realize that managing your own nodes and validators is just a complete pain in the ass and that it's just easier to share the security of Ethereum. And I think that will continue happening for some of these other ones. Yeah. What do you think of that, Chao?
00:17:46.674 - 00:18:21.174, Speaker A: I think it's from an outsider's point of view, it's a very intuitive pivot. It makes a lot of sense. Ethereum is where the users are and you want to capture those users. And the only way to do that is if you don't already have a lot of users like Solana does. It's really obvious to pivot into Ethereum. Layer two infrastructure. There's a lot of deep tech in ZK, scaling and scaling related, but there's also wallet infrastructure around account abstraction.
00:18:21.174 - 00:18:50.258, Speaker A: I don't think that's super deep tech. It's often wrappers around existing deep tech and making it very easy for developers to build on top of. There's ZKML as well. There's a niche of developers building products or deep tech at the intersection of Zknai, for example. But yeah, that's what I'm seeing.
00:18:50.386 - 00:19:19.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember after, I don't know if you guys still do this, but after recent cohorts, I think it was like six and seven and eight, you'd send investors a message and you're like, these are where folks are building. These are what chains people are building on. These are where they're building in the world. I don't know if you guys share that data publicly still, but I'm very curious. Like, are folks building on l one s? Are they mostly building on l two s? Like how are they making those choices? Maybe as much data as you guys have on that. I'd be very curious to hear it.
00:19:19.674 - 00:20:08.262, Speaker A: So shortly after FTX last year, Solana went from number three to number four. So Solana has always been number three, right behind Polygon and the Ethereum mainnet. And then when it went from number three to number four, it was arbitrum that took Solana's place. So that was half a year ago. And then shortly after people recovered, the Solana ecosystem recovered, so they went back to being number three, overtaking arbitrum. But recently they're back to number four again, overtaken by arbitram again. So it's a battle between Solana and arbitrage.
00:20:08.262 - 00:20:27.864, Speaker A: I don't know how statistically significant that ranking is, but I think the overall ranking hasn't changed. The big five. The big fives are Ethereum minute Polygon, Solana, arbitrum, optimism, and they're far ahead of everyone else.
00:20:29.684 - 00:20:35.944, Speaker B: That lines up with how I would expect the market to be. Why do folks build on Ethereum mainnet instead of building on arbitrary optimism?
00:20:41.324 - 00:20:42.572, Speaker A: I don't know, to be honest.
00:20:42.668 - 00:20:43.344, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:45.324 - 00:20:46.092, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:20:46.188 - 00:20:59.394, Speaker B: Yeah. What about l three s? Like, are any. Is anyone looking at what DyDx is doing with Cosmos and saying, maybe this is a better strategy for us, maybe we do need to own the full stack?
00:21:01.334 - 00:21:21.378, Speaker A: I haven't seen anyone that adopted the same strategy as Cosmos, and I don't know what to make of the Dydx strategy. We'll see. So they're going to launch. I don't know whether they're going to launch their next version that's fully cosmos based. That's the before. I think it might be in a couple months. October, maybe next month.
00:21:21.378 - 00:21:41.630, Speaker A: October. Okay. But from the looks of it, you can use DyDX from any Ethereum based wallets, including Metamask. So I would imagine that the user experience will be very similar. As if Cosmos was on Ethereum. Sorry. As if Dy.
00:21:41.630 - 00:21:42.878, Speaker A: DX was on Ethereum.
00:21:42.966 - 00:21:45.822, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:21:45.878 - 00:21:55.590, Speaker A: Because originally my biggest worry was that they moved to Cosmos, but they now have access to a much smaller user base. But from the UX, it doesn't seem that way.
00:21:55.622 - 00:22:37.326, Speaker B: So I don't think they're cutting off the liquidity, though, to the, to the ETH. The ETH liquidity, basically. So what, um, chow, what, what types of founders are coming in? Is it. I don't know if you saw Rob Leshner launch his new company, Superstate, but that was a very, in my mind, encouraging development because you have this very successful crypto founder. We're now at the stage of the market, or crypto has been around long enough where you can have successful crypto founders launching their second thing, which, if you look back at tech over the last 20 years, a lot of the best companies started from founders who are not first time founders. They were second time or even third time founders in tech. So it's very encouraging in my mind to see the lecturers of the world do this.
00:22:37.326 - 00:22:47.594, Speaker B: I'm curious what types of founders are coming into this cohort. In the last couple of cohorts, is it Web two? Is it crypto founders on their second run? Who is it?
00:22:47.934 - 00:23:23.298, Speaker A: There's always a small percentage of very successful founders in every cohort. So the next one, there will be a founder that previously built a unicorn. In Web two, the last cohort, there was someone who built a very successful crypto network. That was David Vorick, who built Sia. Sia used to be like top ten coin on Coinmarketcap. So every cohort there is a small percentage of that. But the more interesting trend is the next cohort.
00:23:23.298 - 00:24:01.380, Speaker A: Virtually all of them are crypto natives. Unsurprisingly compared to two years ago. At the peak of the bull market, there was a lot of FAANG engineers or web two people, many of which have pivoted or folded from crypto. I feel really good today because at the peak of the bull market, I always worried about whether or not the founder will be committed to crypto when the bear market hits. But today I'm not worried anymore because everyone is crypto native and has been building for a long time in crypto.
00:24:01.492 - 00:24:29.968, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been interesting to see people get wiped out. I mean, I remember you had this tweet at the beginning of the year. You said, for crypto professionals, the second year of the bear market tends to be the most painful one. It's the year of apathy. There seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel, but simply being aware of this gives you a massive edge. Year three, things will get much better, and I've definitely seen that with companies that I've invested in, where there's this divergence of folks who maybe they've been in crypto for a while, they understand that this is just, you got to grid it out. And then new folks are.
00:24:29.968 - 00:24:34.964, Speaker B: I mean, a couple of them have pivoted into AI. I'm like, guys, what are we doing here?
00:24:35.584 - 00:24:54.696, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I'm seeing a far greater number of pivots from crypto in the last few months. I've seen more pivots from crypto in the last few months than I've ever seen in the last four years. And I've also seen more co founder breakups in the last few months. Same I've ever seen. The bear market is brutal.
00:24:54.800 - 00:25:07.084, Speaker B: Very tough. Yeah. What about, huh? Yeah, that's really interesting. What is the dispute that founders have, do you think?
00:25:10.024 - 00:26:18.594, Speaker A: Okay, this is a really good question, and I think not enough investors pay attention to this. I pay a lot of attention to the co founder relationship of the co founders. Ideally, there are a couple of people who have worked together for a long time in the past within the same company or worked on site projects together and have been friends. So that would be an ideal setup of co founders, because if they found each other online sometime in the last six months, they're still in the honeymoon period and their relationship will get tested in the bear market. When things don't go well, and oftentimes it's really because the product doesn't grow and one of them just either loses conviction in crypto or conflicts arise between the co founders. Growth solves every problem, and conversely, the lack of growth causes all sorts of co founder conflicts.
00:26:23.174 - 00:26:56.530, Speaker B: It's something that I never thought about when investing is the co founder relationship, because Mike and I have a very strong relationship and we went to college together. We were roommates in New York for a while. We've known each other for several years. We handle, I think, when things do not go, when we disagree all the time, obviously, as co founders do. But I think we have a very good system of working out disagreements and we move through disagreements very, very quickly. But so I'd never thought about, like, basically interviewing or assessing co founder relationships until now. We're deep into this market.
00:26:56.530 - 00:27:01.094, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, man, that's one of the main indicators, I would say, for how well a company ends up doing.
00:27:01.434 - 00:27:02.738, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed.
00:27:02.826 - 00:27:46.150, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's talk about tensor for a second. So I met the tensor founders for the first time two weeks ago, maybe, obviously. Why online? We were just, we'd been exchanging DM's for a while on Twitter and we ended up jumping on a call. And I'm a big fan of what they've built, and it's remarkably impressive how quickly they build and just the market share that they've grabbed basically in the NFT space in such a short amount of time with such a small team. I'm curious, when you see a team like, have you done this long enough now, chow, that you can see someone like that, you can see that team, and you're like, that's, that's a winning team. They are going to do it, or is this something that you have no idea.
00:27:46.150 - 00:27:55.154, Speaker B: It's a complete, you know, random, random instance here where, like, you know, just one of your 50 companies ends up being very successful there.
00:27:55.494 - 00:28:21.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, so after doing this for three years, I think I. I've developed some instinct for people like the tensor guys. So, matter of fact, we actually have a name for those people internally. We call them tensorians. So we're always looking for founders that are. That have the same characteristics as the two co founders of Tensor.
00:28:21.294 - 00:28:49.406, Speaker A: But it doesn't mean that we're not open to other types of founders. But the archetypical founders we look for these days are, you know, they're fairly green. They're usually first time founders because that's usually where we can make the most impact. They think about problems deeply, and they work extremely, extremely hard. So the tensor guys, I don't think they sleep and they work seven days a week.
00:28:49.510 - 00:29:04.134, Speaker B: Truly. I was like, you know, I was asking, are you coming down to New York? They're like, why would we leave? I think they're in Toronto or something, or Montreal. They're like, why would we leave here? We've got our computer, we've got our keyboard. Why would we? That's all you need. I was like, all right, exactly. Yeah.
00:29:04.474 - 00:29:44.700, Speaker A: And. But the hard work part is very hard to gauge just from an interview. You have to look at their past achievement, but the thing that you can look for during the interview is how they think about the product, how they think about go to market. Do they have very unique insights about their users that I've never heard elsewhere? Again, it sounds simple on paper, but most of it really is a black box in my mind. It's like a neural network that I developed from the last. Just doing this for three years.
00:29:44.812 - 00:29:53.850, Speaker B: What are the characteristics? If you're sitting down with Imran and Jacob and the team, and you've got a whiteboard up and you write down five characteristics of tensorians, what's coming up there?
00:29:53.882 - 00:30:28.364, Speaker A: Yeah. The single most important one is resilience, and it basically trumps everything else. I think resilience is the only common characteristic of every successful founder. Every founder is different, but resilience is the one characteristic that is common to everyone. So that's the one that we look for, but it's also the one that's the hardest to gauge from an interview again. Yeah, but so that would be number one. Number two would be unique insights into their users.
00:30:28.364 - 00:31:14.224, Speaker A: So oftentimes you hear about a super interesting narrative on Twitter. It sounds great, but you have to dive deeper, you have to understand, you have to see if the founders truly understand their users. You have to go well below the surface. So unique insights into their users is really important. So, to give you a concrete example, the unique insight that tensor had about their users was that the vast majority of trading volume of NFTs came from speculators. So people who treated NFTs as shitcoins, not the collectors. The collectors don't trade that much.
00:31:14.224 - 00:31:31.636, Speaker A: It's the DJ's that trade a lot. A lot in terms of number of transactions, but also in dollar amount. And you had to build a product that served these people really well. So that was the unique insight that Tensor had, by the way. It's the same insight as blur. It's exactly the same.
00:31:31.820 - 00:31:37.474, Speaker B: Right outside of tensor, what are other or. Go ahead. Anything else on Tensorflow?
00:31:37.474 - 00:31:38.804, Speaker A: No, go ahead.
00:31:39.264 - 00:31:47.724, Speaker B: I was going to say, any other successful companies that have come out of alliance that you've, like, maybe gained a bit of insight into how you guys can make better investments moving forward?
00:31:50.664 - 00:32:29.664, Speaker A: So there were. Here's another really interesting example. It's Stepan. Stepan came out of our program, I think, the cohort before tensor. And what makes Stepan really interesting is their English is completely broken, and they would have a very hard time raising from american VC's. I chatted with them in Chinese. So the cultural barrier and the language barrier is real, and I think it's an alpha that I have just because I.
00:32:29.664 - 00:32:40.556, Speaker A: So English is actually my third language. Before English, I mostly spoke French in my teenage years and Chinese in first ten years.
00:32:40.740 - 00:32:42.180, Speaker B: Where are you from, chao?
00:32:42.372 - 00:33:15.662, Speaker A: I grew up in Montreal, so Montreal is bilingual, but mostly French. Actually never spoke. I didn't speak English on a regular basis until the age of 18. But anyway, so what I'm trying to say is there's an alpha about understanding this cultural barrier and break that barrier. But the step in guys, they have the same characteristics as tensor in terms of resilience. So these guys also never sleep. They're based in Australia.
00:33:15.662 - 00:33:29.196, Speaker A: They join our program, our lectures at 01:00 a.m. Their time, we can recount. Ridiculous, to be honest. So resilience.
00:33:29.380 - 00:34:06.554, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Resilience and hard work. One more question on the alliance cohorts, and then we can move on to some of this AI conversation that I know we wanted to have. It feels like we might be at Peak Bull. Asia, bear us in crypto right now. I'm curious what you're seeing on the ground in terms of where folks are building, where people are trying to get users. It feels like there's a lot of focus now on maybe Korea or Japan or renewed interest in Singapore.
00:34:06.554 - 00:34:32.714, Speaker B: Hong Kong is opening back up. Everyone's very anti uS. The SEC is clamping down CFTC, et cetera. In my mind, it feels like we're kind of like. I would be betting on the US right now, but I'm very curious. But that might just be my us centric grew up in the US worldview that I want to have. I'm curious both what you think about that and then where maybe on the data from the data where people are actually building.
00:34:33.654 - 00:35:17.982, Speaker A: So I certainly thought this way a couple of months ago that we were at the peak Asia and bottom us. But I felt like the bitcoin ETF news and the XRP news changed things a lot. So the very fact that it was Larry Fink Blackrock that filed for the bitcoin ETF probably would change the perception of a lot of people in the US, from traffic people to tech people. That was a huge positive for the US. And then same thing goes with the XRP news. It was a huge victory. Obviously the dust hasn't fully settled.
00:35:17.982 - 00:35:47.394, Speaker A: We'll see if the SEC will appeal the decision, but just from a perception point of view, I think the US is actually going back up. But in terms of data, I don't have very good data. I don't have clear data on who, you know, whether or not Asia is rising in terms of developer activities versus the US. But I would say.
00:35:49.534 - 00:35:50.286, Speaker B: A good portion.
00:35:50.310 - 00:36:13.854, Speaker A: Of our applicants come from Asia. Like maybe a third of them. We're still mostly us. Like, most of our applicants are still based in the US. Like I would say 50% of them are based in the US and then maybe 20% based in Europe and other regions. Oh, the one interesting thing, there's two interesting trends that emerged recently. One is Latin America.
00:36:13.854 - 00:36:58.934, Speaker A: I think Latin America in terms of crypto adoption is maybe a few years behind. I don't know how much exactly, but there's a far greater number of latin american founders building what the US founders were building a few years ago for Latin America. So, for example, on ramp, off Ramp Dubai is another interesting one. There's a lot of founders based in Dubai. Some people say there's a lot of scammers in Dubai as well. I suppose there's a reason for that. Maybe the taxes and other laws, but there's more and more founders based in Dubai.
00:36:58.934 - 00:37:03.454, Speaker A: And there's certainly more and more founders based in Hong Kong.
00:37:05.274 - 00:37:33.222, Speaker B: Everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute. But before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best deFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers.
00:37:33.222 - 00:37:59.750, Speaker B: A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there. You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app, chain thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff. That will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team.
00:37:59.750 - 00:38:17.266, Speaker B: You get 30% off if you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless. Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30 when buying your permissionless ticket. You get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:38:17.266 - 00:38:28.138, Speaker B: Episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up. Let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there.
00:38:28.138 - 00:39:21.626, Speaker B: Let's face it, concentrated liquidity is hard and that's why I'm super excited to partner with Carbon for Empire. Carbon is a new Dex on ethereum that makes concentrated liquidity easy. With carbon, LP's can now automate your liquidity strategy with custom on chain limit orders and range orders. Want to buy a token when it dips and sell it when it spikes with carbon? You can now set a strategy that buys in on one price range and sells in a higher range on repeat. Using a single source of automated rotating liquidity strategies can be created for any standard ERC 20 token. I recently checked out the carbon beta that just dropped pretty blown away by the liquidity strategies that carbon enables on chain. It has these rich trading features that you'd expect from a centralized exchange, except carbon is fully on chain, decentralized and non custodial.
00:39:21.626 - 00:39:43.986, Speaker B: Just connect your wallet. It's carbon defi XYZ. That's carbon Defi XYZ. Choose a trading pair, set your buy and sell ranges and amounts hit create and you're done. Carbon automatically moves your liquidity into your solution selected ranges. As the market moves LP's, it is time to take back control of your liquidity with carbon. Check out the link and get started today.
00:39:43.986 - 00:40:19.704, Speaker B: Now let's get back to Empire Chow. Let's move away from alliance and let's talk about. Let's talk about AI for a little bit. I think I got a little smile on my face saying, AI, you got a little smile. I think one of the reasons we just, like, subconsciously smiled there is it feels like this kind of, like, hypey thing and even, like, bringing up, like, all this convergence of AI and crypto, it feels very, I don't know, just fluffy. I would say maybe if you could tell me, like, you know, the Gartner hype cycle, you know, big up, down, slowly comes back up. Where do you think that we are on the.
00:40:19.704 - 00:40:22.244, Speaker B: On the Gartner hype cycle for AI right now?
00:40:22.704 - 00:41:10.690, Speaker A: I actually tweeted about this probably two months ago. It felt like we're at the peak, but I did caveat that the bottom might last only a few months because AI is moving really, really fast. So today. So two months after my tweet, it feels like a lot of people are disillusioned with the current state of AI, especially the consumers. If you look at the Google trends, the search for chat DPT has been going down for the last couple of months. And then there's also a very interesting study on how the performance of chat GPT has gone down in the last few months. I thought that was really interesting, but anyway, that's.
00:41:10.690 - 00:41:11.854, Speaker A: That's a different topic.
00:41:12.394 - 00:41:19.414, Speaker B: So performance of Cha, how good it is at actually doing its tasks is getting worse.
00:41:19.954 - 00:41:59.676, Speaker A: Right. So how good it is in terms of doing math, in terms of, like, just doing some basic tasks went down a lot over the last few months. And we were actually discussing this internally last night about the hypoth. Like, what are the hypotheses as to why this has been happening? So one of the hypotheses that we saw on Twitter is that. So OpenAI uses this thing called reinforcement learning with human feedback. So the human feedback is, the import is the keyword here. So when OpenAI first launched, there was all the human feedback they had to train.
00:41:59.676 - 00:42:44.082, Speaker A: Their model was their internal staff. But once they've launched the product, there's like hundreds of millions of people providing this feedback back to OpenAI. And those people are, I don't know, they destroy the model or somehow I don't really buy this hypothesis, but I can see it. But another, more, I think, more plausible hypothesis is that OpenAI is prioritizing AI safety versus performance. So they actively dumb down the model itself just so people don't do crazy shit with a very powerful tool. So that's another plausible hypothesis. Obviously, the OpenAI people have denied these things.
00:42:44.082 - 00:43:07.344, Speaker A: But anyway, so that's, it's just overall, this degradation of performance leads people to feel a little bit more disillusioned with AI in the last couple of months. So I feel like there has been a little bit of sentiment change, but that's just my perception. I don't know if other people see the same thing.
00:43:07.764 - 00:43:54.072, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're right there. So, just for background from our past conversations, I think, like, one of the reasons that maybe you're qualified to talk about this is you. I mean, you have a decade of experience building some of these models. I don't think you've, like, maybe it's not necessarily neural networks because you were mainly working in like building model tra, uh, trading models in finance where neural networks don't either they don't really work, or they're just too hard. But, you know, you, you have about a decade of building models. I'm curious how you think about, um, like when I think about the, you know, when I see like headlines about the intersection of AI and crypto, and when I try to think about it, I've kind of bucketed it into three, three buckets in my mind. There's AI that ends up helping with the AI that helps companies and people inside of companies build better products.
00:43:54.072 - 00:44:23.884, Speaker B: Maybe this is AI that helps developers move ten x faster. This is AI that helps customers support chat bots on the website. That's like, that's one bucket in my mind. Then there's a more, probably two other, like, maybe more technical buckets, which is kind of decentralizing AI. And looking at that from two different angles, there's the compute, like, decentralizing compute. I know the multicore guys invested in a company called Render, been looking into them. There's decentralized compute.
00:44:23.884 - 00:44:37.080, Speaker B: I guess maybe there's another bucket. There's training. How do you decentralize the training of the AI? And then how do you decentralize whatever the front end is on the AI?
00:44:37.152 - 00:44:37.528, Speaker A: Inference?
00:44:37.576 - 00:44:50.154, Speaker B: The inference, yeah. Thank you. There's like, decentralizing that. So I don't know, like, how do you, what do you think about those buckets? Is that, are you, do you agree with those buckets? Are you more excited about one of those buckets than the other are those fair buckets to put this into?
00:44:50.774 - 00:45:36.548, Speaker A: So the first bucket that you mentioned is it applies across every company. It's not just a crypto thing. So, like, helping developers become more productive, helping companies do better, customer engagement, customer support, that applies to everywhere, not just crypto. And I actually think that helping developers become more productive, that is the single most important, by far the single most important use case of GPT. And it's not even close. I know this from personal experience. Last week we actually had an internal hackathon, and so we spent like three days together for our offside, and one of the three days, we spent a whole day on an AI hackathon.
00:45:36.548 - 00:46:33.584, Speaker A: So all of us build stuff for alliance, and it's really incredible because we only had maybe five technical people on our team out of like 20. But the vast majority of non technical people wrote code thanks to GPT, and they wrote code that worked. It's really impressive. And there are two, so more specifically, there are two things. So when you write a piece of code, the first thing you need to do is architect sort of how the code works. And then the second part, I'm really simplifying this, but the second part is writing the actual code itself. Um, so GPT is really, really good at the second part, which is you architect the whole thing.
00:46:33.584 - 00:47:02.300, Speaker A: You, you read out the functions, but you ask GPT to write the functions for you. So that, that in itself is a ten x improvement. And I know I experienced this personally, um, ten x improvement in terms of speed of, uh, writing a code, a piece of code that actually works. But then there's a second piece which is called the code interpreter of chat. GPT. I don't know if you've heard of it. I think it came out a couple months ago, but last week was the first time I tried it.
00:47:02.300 - 00:47:26.544, Speaker A: But this part, it does the architecting for you. So you don't even need to architect the code in your head. You can just tell GPT what you want to do in plain English and it'll do the architect. Architect. The code interpreter will do the architecting for you, and they're writing the code for you. So this, this is another ten x improvement in terms of speed. So overall, for me, it was like 100 x improvement.
00:47:26.544 - 00:47:37.540, Speaker A: It's really mind boggling. It's really impressive. So, yeah, I don't. The AI.
00:47:37.612 - 00:47:53.814, Speaker B: Chad, let me, let me, let me show you this. I will share my screen here. I don't know how to. I've never built anything in Python. I've never written a line of code in Python. I wanted to build a game of pong. You know, the game, the very simple game pong.
00:47:53.814 - 00:48:20.594, Speaker B: And I just, without any knowledge of pong, I typed into GPT, I said, I want to build pong, pull it up in versus code. I had like one window with GBT three or GBT 35 or whatever, four maybe. I forget which one it was, and then another with just like the area where I was putting the code in. And I just said, I want to build pong. I have no idea how to do it. I barely. All I know is HTML and css and little JavaScript.
00:48:20.594 - 00:48:37.738, Speaker B: Never written anything in python. Teach me how to do it. So it said, here's what you do, pull it up. And it would give me code to put in. I would play around with that, I'd do some Googling, I'd put it in. And you can see here, if you can see that, I think you can see my screen right now. I would say, look, there's an error right here.
00:48:37.738 - 00:49:10.194, Speaker B: And it would say, oh, this Error Message is missing two required positional arguments, x and y. We, which means, this is what that means. Make sure to pass the correct values for x and y for each paddle in your game. And I asked it, I said, so should I replace this line with this line? And it said, no, you should replace this line with this line. After a couple, took me about 3 hours, maybe 2 hours, maybe I forget one to 3 hours. I had a working pong Game, and you can see this tweet here. It says, I just built pong using Python entirely from chat gbt.
00:49:10.194 - 00:49:22.826, Speaker B: Whenever I got an error, I would put it in chat GPT and would both explain it and fix it. I know Pong is basic, but being able to build this, it took me, all right, less than 1 hour without ever having written python feels incredible to me, and I think that's exactly what you're talking about.
00:49:22.890 - 00:50:00.174, Speaker A: Yeah. The 3 hours you took would otherwise take, I don't know, at least a month for you to learn Python and write off, right? So I think GPT is. So the more beginner of a developer you are, the more GPT can help you. So I think GPT is less of an improvement for the experience for the ten X developers. So GPT might be a 5% improvement for the ten X developers, but a ten x improvement for the one x developer and 100 x improvement for the 0.1 developer, like yourself.
00:50:00.254 - 00:50:18.186, Speaker B: Like me. Yeah, I'm a 0.1 x engineer. That's great. That's great. Crypto, for the last decade, has been focused on decentralizing money and, like, decentralizing value, right? Like bitcoin, like decentralizing money. Now it feels like there's this new conversation happening, which is decentralizing AI, maybe.
00:50:18.186 - 00:50:21.014, Speaker B: Could you tell me in your mind why you feel that that is important?
00:50:22.074 - 00:51:11.884, Speaker A: It's important for the same reason as to why money should be decentralized, as to why social networks should be decentralized, as to why finance should be decentralized, which is that you don't want these powerful models to be controlled by one central entity. And by the way, we just experienced this, where OpenAI probably dumbed down their models for all their consumers. For all their customers, whereas they internally have the most powerful model still. So they decide they're the king makers. They decide who gets the access to the powerful models and who doesn't. So you don't want to give this much power to one central entity. That's the whole idea behind decentralized AI, and a very closely related notion is privacy.
00:51:11.884 - 00:52:10.924, Speaker A: Today, when you interact with chat GPT, you send them a lot of personal data and they know everything about you, and it just doesn't feel great. So the idea of decentralized AI is to solve these two problems. Now, there's many ways to do that. To me, on the inference side, the most intuitive way is to what they call edge computing, edge AI. And by edge AI, they mean running an open source model on your local device. So all the compute happens on your local device within an open source piece of software, rather than being run on the cloud. At OpenAI, this achieves the two goals that we had before, which is that one, the user owns the model because it's open source, and two, the user owns their data because they don't send the data to the cloud to open AI.
00:52:10.924 - 00:53:10.104, Speaker A: So this edge computing is the most intuitive way to solve this. Obviously, there's arguments against whether or not consumer grade hardware is powerful enough to run the most powerful models in the world. Maybe we're not there yet, but there are good enough of open source models and efficient enough of open source models. By the way, Facebook and open source, their llama model, I think last week, and there was a collaboration with Microsoft, even I didn't read into the exact news, but the very concept of edge computing solves the decentralization problem. Now, there's another problem, which is, um, which is not about privacy or self, self sovereignty. It's more about a very pragmatic issue today, which is the lack of GPU's. GPU's are a massive shortage because everyone wants GPU's.
00:53:10.104 - 00:54:08.334, Speaker A: Everyone needs GPU's to train powerful models. Everyone needs GPU's to do inference. By everyone, I mean the big tech, the casual developers, the casual hackers to build products off of those open source LLM models. So there's a massive shortage of GPU. So the decentralized AI in this context tries to solve this problem by allowing the average consumer to participate in the compute network by offering their consumer grade GPU's from their laptop. So for example, the laptop you're working on now is probably not being used 24/7 so when it's idle, you can contribute that compute resource to the network and help the developers to leverage the GPU's to train their models or to do inference. So this is GPU shortage problem.
00:54:10.594 - 00:54:17.226, Speaker B: Does this make sense? That feels like the modern day version of the 2017 filecoin thesis.
00:54:17.330 - 00:54:35.614, Speaker A: Yes, yes, exactly. It's exactly the thesis for behind Filecoin before GPU's. And so the thesis behind file coin is for. Is for storage. But now we're doing what Filecon does for storage before AI for GPU's.
00:54:36.394 - 00:55:08.520, Speaker B: Yeah. Hmm. I think there's a clear counterargument, though, that might be stronger than the benefit there, which is decentralized compute has this extreme disadvantage of being slower. Right. In ML training, because at least my basic understanding of it is like, you have this horrible communication overhead between a bunch of different types. So, like, I've got my laptop, it might be different than your laptop, which is different than this person's laptop. And there's this like communication overhead between these different computing devices.
00:55:08.520 - 00:55:30.280, Speaker B: And for anyone building an AI, you were saying? Like, this kind of AI bear market might be slow because of how quickly people are moving. And I think speed is like one of the number one advantages for any AI company building today. So if you're telling me you've got, maybe you can make it cheaper or whatever it is, but it's gonna be ten times slower, there's no way that I'm taking that trade off. Yep. I'm curious what you think of that.
00:55:30.352 - 00:56:34.454, Speaker A: I think you're spot on. So this is a very valid counterargument against the whole idea of decentralized compute or decentralized GPU compute. A very related counterargument is that the hardware that's used for training the LLM models at OpenAI are way more powerful than the average consumer grade hardware, and they're also more standardized more specialized. And so the counterargument is basically that the consumer grade hardware, consumer grade gpu, is not powerful enough to train the super large models. Now, the counter counterargument is, maybe we don't need this decentralized AI compute to train the OpenAI kind of models. We can use the decentralized compute to train smaller models or to fine tune a large model. So it's the kind of work that doesn't require as much compute.
00:56:34.454 - 00:57:06.334, Speaker A: So I see the counter, the arguments and the counter arguments on both sides. And overall, I think that the counterarguments against decentralized AI or decentralized compute are valid, but if they're wrong, they can be really wrong. Right? As in, if decentralized compute does work, it can be a really big idea, because there is just a massive shortage of GPU's. So the payoff is very asymmetric, in my opinion.
00:57:08.554 - 00:58:04.444, Speaker B: I guess you could see, yeah, you could see a world like, I think my computer right now is running this m one chip. Then, you know, I haven't, you know, Apple's got the m one and the m two s, right? You could see a world where you're basically running these powerful enough chips, which are really GPU's on your laptop, and it gets exponentially better and better and better. Yeah, that's interesting. So there's decentralized compute, then there's more, the inference and the. Or, excuse me. Then there's, like, the training and, like, building it, which is. I was listening to an interesting conversation about kind of the chat GBTs of that are getting built in China right now, and how, if you type in something like, you type in, like, what is the best political system into the thing, it's like, oh, like, you know, communism is the perfect version.
00:58:04.444 - 00:58:24.336, Speaker B: And this is the. And it's like. But to me, that. I mean, that seems nuts. But, like, if I typed in, like, on chat GBT, like, what is the perfect version of. What is the perfect political system into this GBT four? It's gonna be like democracy because of these reasons. And the reason it's pulling from that is because it's mainly pulling from, you know, us or english centric sources.
00:58:24.336 - 00:58:35.616, Speaker B: So maybe there's like a. It sounds like that's another version of decentralizing, like, the sources or what. Help me contextualize, like, how you think about that version of this decentralized, the.
00:58:35.640 - 00:59:13.284, Speaker A: Data set that is used in trading data. Um, because it's garbage in, garbage out. If you feed the model training with a very politically biased data set, then output will be a very politically biased model. Um, so I've seen, um, I don't know if it was actual data or it was just opinions, but the average Internet is. Leans more liberal than conservative conservative, which would make sense because the liberals, at least in the US, are generally more educated. So they use the Internet more. I think the majority of social networks are more liberal than conservatives.
00:59:13.284 - 00:59:37.544, Speaker A: And the data, the content from those social networks are what OpenAI uses to train their models. Again, this is a problem with centralization. OpenAI can choose what kind of data they want to use to feed their model. When I use GPT, clearly, see, I clearly feel a political bias towards, you know, liberals.
00:59:38.404 - 00:59:56.644, Speaker B: Very much so, yeah. Where does crypto tie into all of this, chao? Because what is the, are we talking about using tokens as to enforce some of the learning here and to speed this to exchange value? What is the, what is the crypto element here?
00:59:56.804 - 01:00:16.274, Speaker A: I don't know if there's a crypto element. I wish there was. But pragmatically, how do you use tokens to incentivize a more politically neutral or more politically diverse content? I find it very hard to do. I mean, conceptually, yes, but pragmatically, it feels really hard.
01:00:16.814 - 01:00:37.914, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. It feels like maybe a 2017 version of like, putting healthcare records on the blockchain, right? We're kind of trying to throw a blockchain at everything six years ago, and now maybe we're trying to throw crypto AI at everything. So then where is the crypto application here for AI?
01:00:38.574 - 01:01:43.264, Speaker A: Yeah. So the decentralized compute is something we talked about earlier, but there's also using crypto to digitally assign content to fight deepfakes, for example. So, for example, this podcast that we're recording, after the recording, you can sign on the Ethereum blockchain, you can provide a signature on the Ethereum blockchain that this podcast was produced really by Jason, and you can put your public key on your Twitter profile that people can use to verify the digital signature. So this is another very important application. I don't know who should be building this. I don't know if it's the job of a startup or it's the job of the big tech, but this will be a very important application, especially with the elections coming up next year. There will be a lot of deep fakes, a lot of AI generated content to influence the results of the election.
01:01:43.344 - 01:02:00.712, Speaker B: For example, basically what you're talking about here is crypto offering this kind of, I think you tweeted about this a little bit ago that I saw offering like a checks and balances against AI, right, via like, digital signatures to battle deepfakes and zero knowledge proofs to kind of protect privacy here. That's the bucket that you're excited about.
01:02:00.808 - 01:02:50.044, Speaker A: Yep. So that's the good thing that crypto can provide to AI, is the checks and balances. But there's also a flip side, which is that crypto is a permissionless platform, and the permissionless platform can be used by AI agents. So you can think of so fundamentally, AI agents are programmable, so they can leverage other interfaces to do things that they want. So one of the interfaces that they can use is the blockchain, and they can do this permissionlessly. So for example, they can use ETH as the AI native money, or they can interact with DeFi, or they can play games. And if they do that, they can do that permissionlessly and no one can stop them.
01:02:50.044 - 01:03:09.704, Speaker A: So that can get a little bit scary. So currently, AI agents don't do much, but if you give them the ability to do permissionless programming on chain and give them an unstoppable form of money, which is, for example, ETH, in this case, I don't know what they're going to do with this type of capability.
01:03:11.164 - 01:03:48.914, Speaker B: So I went into the world coin offices a couple months ago and met one of their founders, not Sam Altman, but the other one, Alex Blania. And he was kind of painting this vision of the future, which said, look, chat GBT for you. I mean, right now, you just put in a prompt onto this kind of user interface and spits out an answer. He goes, what GBT six and seven and eight will look like is you're giving, you are giving it not just read access, but write access to your computer so I can type in, hey, go. Go farm. Go farm GMX right now. Just go.
01:03:48.914 - 01:04:12.744, Speaker B: Just go. Just go farm GMX with $10,000 and it's going to know the perfect farming strategy. It's going to be like, look, there's an airdrop coming up. Based on all this data, there's probably an airdrop coming up in this month. I'm going to go farm all these tokens here are the best farming strategies. And if you give it the right access, it's going to be able to do that for you. And if you extend that out, what you could see is we think that, like, there are bots.
01:04:12.744 - 01:04:30.794, Speaker B: Bots on Twitter right now are a problem. That problem is going to get 1 million times worse. It is going to grow by orders of magnitude, because you're going to be able to give your AI, your, like, little AI assistant access to your social and basically write access. But what it sounds like you're talking about is.
01:04:32.294 - 01:04:43.194, Speaker A: No, what I'm talking about is exactly that. So when you give AI not just read access, but also write access to the blockchain, things can get really interesting.
01:04:44.614 - 01:05:17.134, Speaker B: That's interesting. I mean, so the world coin, this guy Alex's take on this would be that you need. You need, like, a crypto wallet. You need to scan the eyeball to digitally verify, basically, like, verifying who is a human online is going to be becoming an incredibly tough challenge and that we have to do that. I think there's probably another take here, though, which is that there are going to be some billion dollar companies that are built on the back of embracing these bots. I don't even know if I want to call them bots. I would like just these.
01:05:17.134 - 01:05:43.474, Speaker B: These AI agents. And instead of trying to turn them all away, they lean into them and they say, look, these are the new. These are our new users. Basically, like what you were mentioning with Nikita, with Nikita's tweet, it's like, these are our new users. Like, instead of pushing them away and trying to play whack a mole with bots, it's like, what if we just said, these are our users now, and we embrace them? That's an interesting thought process that you've sparked there.
01:05:44.044 - 01:06:39.292, Speaker A: Embracing AI is probably one of the two most interesting things I can think of for consumer crypto products. The other one being embracing hyper financialization, because trading shitcoins, speculating is the one thing that crypto really enables for the mainstream. So I think it'd be really fun for crypto consumer products to embrace that, to try things that are related to speculation, to hyper financialization. But the other thing that they should try is to embrace the AI bots. But I've just been thinking about this. I think a lot of people are disillusioned about why it's been ten years. We still haven't seen a consumer product in crypto that has reached the mainstream.
01:06:39.292 - 01:06:49.064, Speaker A: And so I tried to brainstorm ideas for just startups to try, and these two things came to mind. I don't know if they work, but I think they're worth trying.
01:06:49.444 - 01:07:02.140, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what does this look like? Maybe with a social network, like a web3 social. Maybe paint a picture of what you think this looks like. Let's take it one step further.
01:07:02.292 - 01:07:51.174, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really hard to say, yeah, I think a better example I can give you is DeFi really, Defi Summer, to me, is still the most magical moment in the entire history of crypto. I probably signed more transactions that summer than I've ever done in the last ten years, like, probably by order of magnitude. And I think. I think a lot of people felt the same way. A lot of people felt that DeFi Summer was really a moment of magic. And I think DeFi Summer worked because it unapologetically embraced speculation and hyper financialization. And the whole DeFi summer was a game.
01:07:51.174 - 01:07:58.374, Speaker A: It was not really finance. I mean, finance in itself is really, is a game. Defi Summer was a gamer, was all one big game.
01:07:58.414 - 01:07:58.926, Speaker B: I agree.
01:07:59.030 - 01:08:28.264, Speaker A: It was one big game, and it was social, except that the social interactions happen mostly on Twitter. It was so fun, right? So I kind of want to see the same consumer behavior on crypto social networks. Something that feels really degen, something that feels crazy, potentially outrageous. So yesterday, the hamsters raise. I'm sure you've seen it. That was fun. So I want to see stuff like, weird things like that.
01:08:28.923 - 01:08:57.759, Speaker B: Hmm. I wonder if. Yeah, I wonder if we're going to start seeing more, like, social tokens kind of as well come out, like, you know, you know, one. One like version of betting. Basically that already happens is I find an Instagram account and I, you know, maybe it's I, or I find an artist on Spotify and they're really small, or I find an Instagram account with 5000 followers. I think it's really cool when that account gets to 100,000 followers. I'm, yeah, I'm telling my friends, not that I found, I'm like, oh, I found that account at 5000.
01:08:57.759 - 01:09:09.647, Speaker B: You got to imagine you'll be able to kind of bet on accounts and, like, more financialization of, like, tweets. And I like that tweet when it was only at ten likes. It's not viral. Like, I was early on that tweet. I was early on that account.
01:09:09.775 - 01:10:20.302, Speaker A: So, coincidentally, I was actually thinking about this yesterday. So there was a product that came out of China in 2017. It was a product where you can, as a consumer, you can book time with a celebrity and then you can speculate on the time. So when you can almost think of it as an NFT, except it was not NFT, but you can think of it as an NFT that represents, like, 30 minutes of conversation with this celebrity, and you can buy that right, that NFT that gives you the right to have that 30 minutes conversation. And once you've bought that NFT, it can be traded on the open market. So if that person, if the celebrity commits to their conversation and provides interesting insights to their fans, then you could imagine that the price of the NFT goes up over time because people will want that thing more often or they want that more to chat with the celebrity. So this is another way to speculate on the value of celebrity or creator.
01:10:20.438 - 01:10:22.342, Speaker B: Chad, do you know what intro.com is?
01:10:22.438 - 01:10:28.662, Speaker A: Yes. So intro.com is exactly that. Without the speculation, I think without the speculation.
01:10:28.758 - 01:10:32.102, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting.
01:10:32.158 - 01:10:37.394, Speaker A: I would love to see the speculation because that's what crypto uniquely enables.
01:10:41.224 - 01:11:07.770, Speaker B: I heard you and Fouda talking about AI agents, and it sparked this really interesting. I just went down this kind of deep dive of AI agents and one AI hiring another AI, and then you've got this kind of master AI, which is maybe your assistant AI, and that AI hires other AI's. Can you explain this to me and maybe tie in like how you need crypto rails to enable that world?
01:11:07.962 - 01:12:23.304, Speaker A: Okay, so AI agents, just to be upfront, I don't have a strong thesis about it. I don't know how it'll play out. But what happened was a few months ago, there was a vc that built a open source, sort of MVP, where you as a user, you can launch a AI agent and you can tell them what to do. So for example, you can tell them, start a podcast, how to start a podcast for me. And then the AI agent would first research what are the steps needed to start the podcast, and then it'll break the original task into those steps, and then it'll iterate from step one to step two, et cetera, et cetera. And then for each step, it'll break that task even further and then do things on the Internet to do more research, or sometimes to have this right access that we said earlier, to actually do things to transact, to hire other agents, et cetera, et cetera. So that was a really fun experiment that the VC did, but I think the hype kind of died down pretty quickly.
01:12:23.304 - 01:12:37.844, Speaker A: So I don't know where it's going now. It's certainly a very interesting experiment to have these autonomous AI agents that can do things, that can break tasks down for you and to execute those tasks.
01:12:39.824 - 01:12:46.640, Speaker B: We zoom way out here. Chow. Like, is this. Why do you remain excited and optimistic.
01:12:46.672 - 01:12:49.844, Speaker A: About all of this, AI or crypto?
01:12:51.384 - 01:13:29.808, Speaker B: I think all of it. I mean, I think there's a. If someone's listening to this and they're hearing AI, AI agents, here's a version of someone who's listening. I'm hearing about AI agents, AI hiring, other AI social networks that are populated with millions and eventually billions of AI bots. Games that aren't p two p with people, but are p two p with AI. It doesn't sound like a super fun world to live in, I would say, even for me, the eternal optimist and the that someone who just always has believed that technology enables a better world. Even I hear this and I'm like, this doesn't sound like an incredible world to live in.
01:13:29.808 - 01:13:33.760, Speaker B: Why do you remain either excited and or optimistic about this?
01:13:33.872 - 01:14:16.298, Speaker A: Okay, so where I'm optimistic is something really specific, which is the ten x developer thing that we mentioned earlier. Cause I felt it personally, again, I think it's by far the single most important use case of GPT. It's not even close. Everyone can code now, and everyone can code much faster. And it's much easier for startups to launch MVP's with GPT than it used to be. That's why I'm really excited about this. It basically brings the cost of launching products down by an order of magnitude, potentially for developers.
01:14:16.298 - 01:14:49.890, Speaker A: And it's going to be a really interesting world. It's going to, I think, uniquely benefit the idea man. People who have good ideas, but not necessarily have the ability to code their ideas into actual products. With GPT, if you have good ideas, you can implement them much easier than it used to. That's the most important thing I'm excited about, AI, everything else. I feel like it's a work in progress. I don't have a strong thesis yet.
01:14:49.890 - 01:14:50.354, Speaker A: We'll see.
01:14:50.394 - 01:15:07.414, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Ciao. Awesome conversation, man. I love talking to you about this stuff. Anything else that we're from either where we're at in the market AI alliance and the things that you guys are seeing in the trends. Anything else that we haven't, that you wanted to cover, that we haven't covered?
01:15:10.374 - 01:15:45.734, Speaker A: I think we've covered most things. I just think it's. I think it's a great time to be in crypto right now. Two years ago during the bull market, I felt a lot of stress. Every bull market is very stressful for me. You constantly think about when to exit the market, and then you as an investor, you constantly think about, is this person going to be here for a long time? Are they going to commit to crypto? But now everything is a lot easier. Like everyone who still today, who's still here today talking about crypto, you know, they're committed to crypto.
01:15:45.734 - 01:15:56.350, Speaker A: Yeah, it's also more. It's for the most part a contrarian place to be and I feel very comfortable being in an environment like this.
01:15:56.502 - 01:16:37.644, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you. I was at the office with a bunch of our team week ago, two weeks ago whenever the ripple sec thing happened. And um, my first thought was pure elation and excitement because that's a, that's one of those moments that can bring you out of a bear market I think is that ripple sec thing. My second thought was frustration that the bear market was ending. I just wanting to hang on a little bit longer for this blissful time in the market where everything feels so simple and knowing that the chaos will, before we know it, be here. So I share your thoughts. Yeah, awesome man.
01:16:37.644 - 01:16:42.604, Speaker B: Well wishing you guys all the best and I will talk to you soon. I'm sure we'll have you on again soon. Thanks for the time. Thanks.
