00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.414, Speaker A: You know, you're in a bear market when any news is negative news. In January of 2019, I was with Kane in the binance conference and like, synthetix was putting out like, really cool developments of transit, like very, like, updates. And every time Cain said, you know, we're in like the worst part of the cycle, when any news that we put out, we just see the token collapse another 9510 percent or more because people are reminded that they own this stuff.
00:00:24.454 - 00:00:26.478, Speaker B: They're reminded that they own it. That's, that's horrible.
00:00:26.526 - 00:00:30.554, Speaker A: I think we're in that. We're in that. We're working our way through that.
00:00:31.974 - 00:00:45.394, Speaker B: All right, everyone, hope you're having a good start to October, a good week. We're back with another roundup. I feel like it's been a long time since it was just you and me on a roundup, Santi, getting together, chatting about the week. I've missed you, my friend.
00:00:45.814 - 00:01:01.336, Speaker A: I have missed you, too. And, you know, I feel like I've been abandoned here because you now in a different capacity as a married man. And so I've been abandoned, but we're back at it. So, you know, hopefully this relationship doesn't change as much.
00:01:01.470 - 00:01:03.344, Speaker B: No, it can't change. It can't.
00:01:03.924 - 00:01:04.548, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:04.636 - 00:01:06.064, Speaker B: How you been? What's going on?
00:01:06.564 - 00:01:30.150, Speaker A: Good. You know, just there's a lot going on in crypto, as always. I perhaps starting off like I was in Singapore for the token 2049 conference. I've been to a few of these over the years in London. I think they attract a fairly interesting institutional crowd similar to, you know, the blockworks conference. Permissionless. I was shocked by the number of participants in Singapore.
00:01:30.150 - 00:01:44.078, Speaker A: I mean, this was full bull market vibes. I mean, it was packed. Marina Bay Sands, huge convention center. Packed, packed. Absolutely packed. It was really nice to catch up with teams. A lot of excitement in the air, a lot of enthusiasm.
00:01:44.078 - 00:02:15.706, Speaker A: And I was just comparing it to the first binance conference in Singapore in 2019, also in that venue. And it was January of 2019. So kind of think of it, the bottom of the bottom, like, of the last bear market. It was crickets. And so it was just a very good, it was a very stark contrast, which makes me wonder, a, have we bottomed? And b, I mean, obviously the ecosystem has grown a lot over the last three years.
00:02:15.890 - 00:02:30.726, Speaker B: Well, let me, let me turn that into a question. Do. So. I think a lot of folk. Okay, so when I hear that there are two ways to approach to think about that, one is bullish, one is bearish. Right. The marina sands in Singapore, flooded with thousands of people, a lot of institutions.
00:02:30.726 - 00:02:50.000, Speaker B: Really exciting. The bearish take is, damn, we have not bottomed yet. The bottom is when people lose interest. The bottom is when the conferences are not sold out. The bottom is when people just walk away and call it quits. The bold take would be, maybe we don't have that kind of bottom this time around. Maybe we don't ever get that.
00:02:50.000 - 00:02:59.772, Speaker B: Remember in 2019 that, like, endless pit in your stomach being like, did I choose the wrong profession here? Like, are we in the right? Like, is this thing going to work? You know, like a lot of people have.
00:02:59.828 - 00:03:08.652, Speaker A: Wait, you. You're telling me that you don't feel that and question yourself every time you wake up or, like, are staring at your phone at three in the morning? I must be a rare breed, sir.
00:03:08.748 - 00:03:17.918, Speaker B: I don't. I don't anymore. I don't ever have that feeling. But I think that's because this is. I think a lot of people have that feeling in their. In their first cycle. Yeah.
00:03:17.966 - 00:03:40.718, Speaker A: Well, to be fair, I think that you are in a very interesting privileged position, because news no matter, and research no matter what, it's kind of like counter cyclic. I mean, it's just all weather kind of business, right? You can talk, maybe tell us, like, you know, like, do you get more interest? I mean, it sounds like the interest for block. Like, just research hasn't stopped even in current market environment.
00:03:40.886 - 00:03:45.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I will literally pull up our growth numbers right now and I will give a little behind the.
00:03:45.046 - 00:03:46.900, Speaker A: Scenes humble brag, humble bragging.
00:03:46.900 - 00:04:10.226, Speaker B: No, no. I mean, some of our numbers are down, right? Like, some of our sales numbers, like, the advertising dollars are down just because people, like, basically what drives ad dollars in crypto is when it's a bull market, more and more people come into the industry, right? There's more texts from friends. Oh, holy shit. Check out bitcoin's price. More people are coming into the industry. Marketers know that. So what they do is they ramp up their ad budgets by, like, ten x trying to capture all those new people.
00:04:10.226 - 00:04:29.890, Speaker B: So ad budgets inherently pull down, like 40%. In the bear market, our ad dollars are down a bit, but actually our numbers are all still up, right? So if you look at social growth pages, like, to our editorial site, podcast downloads. Like, this podcast is booming right now, and we have, like, record number of downloads. That's.
00:04:29.962 - 00:04:31.506, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone, for listening.
00:04:31.530 - 00:04:54.768, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, everyone. But actually, when I did projections for the second half of the year, I had this show, I had all of our shows being basically flat because if you look at the numbers from other media companies in the bear market in 2018, 2019, their numbers fell between 40% to 60%. Page views, podcast downloads, conference attendees, all their numbers fell. So that was actually in our budget. So it's pretty interesting that our growth numbers are still going up.
00:04:54.896 - 00:05:05.264, Speaker A: Do you have a sense of the composition of that? Is it mostly now institutional that are driving the growth versus retail? Is there a way to discern? Because it would be really interesting to understand that.
00:05:05.304 - 00:05:34.794, Speaker B: Yeah, there, there is. I mean, we have a decent bit of data on some of our different channels, actually. You know, one, one idea I was thinking is we could do a, we should do a podcast survey on this podcast where, if you like, it's in the show notes, and if you listen, would love to hear, like, who you are, title company, like what you're interested in, what you like about the show, what you don't, then maybe we could host a meetup or something like that in, like, New York or London. Yeah. For the folks that fill it up. But, so here, so here's like, how we bucket it. Uh, retail is leaving, like, retail.
00:05:34.794 - 00:06:07.374, Speaker B: Our, our retail audience is kind of our retail, non crypto audience, I would call it. So the folks who are like, crypto adjacent, and they were retail and they were kind of just their friend maybe works in crypto or maybe they have some bitcoin and ETH. They are, they have, they have left, essentially. They're, they're almost out. The institutional fo and in 2018 and 2019, the institutional folks, when the retail left, institutional left, too. Now the institutional folks are still very much in, right? So when I look at who's reading our newsletter every day, shout out, Byron, really good pieces this week. And like, who's reading? Yeah, the.
00:06:07.374 - 00:06:45.496, Speaker B: Who's reading our research, it's. I would call it prosumer and up. I would call it like, yeah, prosumer and up, though. I think for us, like, we're really focused on, uh, like the first half of building blockworks the first couple of years was very much like, bring the institutional crowd, the capital markets crowd into crypto. Now we're really focused on, I want to make content and build content that that is for a crypto native audience. Like, I'm just, we're taking a bet on crypto as a, as a market and as an asset class and as an industry growing and less about, like, pulling people into the industry. I'm like, they'll come when they want to come.
00:06:45.496 - 00:06:51.016, Speaker B: I want to, I want to build content for the folks who have already made the leap into crypto. So.
00:06:51.080 - 00:06:52.996, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very interesting.
00:06:53.140 - 00:07:07.424, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, how are you feeling about things? We're like three weeks away from the year mark of the top, right? Like November of 2021 was the top. We're like three weeks away from that. Almost a year into the bear market. How are you feeling about things?
00:07:08.804 - 00:07:39.134, Speaker A: I think you mentioned something like, have we seen Max Payne? If people recall in the summer, I felt like I hadn't seen it. I definitely didn't see it in Singapore. I mean, the things that I, look, I'm not a macro guy, nor do I want to spend all my time thinking or talking about macro. I think that, but of course, it's front and center. And so I think the correlations of crypto to the Nasdaq and broader markets are all time high. I mean, it's super tightly correlated. It's one narrative.
00:07:39.134 - 00:08:17.166, Speaker A: Right now. I would have hoped that by now we would have had some resolution and clarity. Obviously, this pivot was front and center, and people were talking about a pivotal looking at what the central bank in Australia was doing as, like, early indications. And then they, of course, the Fed didn't deliver on that. The things that I'm mostly looking at and trying to just understand is obviously the war in Ukraine and how that would unfold. Hopefully, no nuclear fallout or escalation. The inflation stuff, I think, is probably going to, I mean, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and Europe is going to be hit pretty hard.
00:08:17.166 - 00:08:25.046, Speaker A: I live here and I'm seeing it firsthand. I think it's nothing. Nothing of that is transitory.
00:08:25.190 - 00:08:30.354, Speaker B: And so Harris turned off the lights on the Eiffel Tower. Like you're starting to see it.
00:08:30.734 - 00:09:19.544, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And so I think that my best guess is that, look, I haven't stopped my deployment on private stuff, on super early stage stuff, continue to see really good teams. Macro wise, I think is still, we're definitely not out of the woodwork. I think there's still going to be some pain and choppiness. Is bitcoin and crypto going to kind of lead the recovery as it marked the top before broader markets, TBD, but putting my trader hat on, I think we're going to chop for the rest of the year. And market participants are just going to observe how this macro situation unfolds. Inflation, geopolitical tension, and then more importantly, in specific to crypto.
00:09:19.544 - 00:10:19.588, Speaker A: I think the thing that I'm most excited about is getting clarity on the regulatory front. I think there are a number of moving bills in Europe and in the US, there's a great interview today in Bloomberg with the CFTC commissioner talking about updating securities definitions and just working it to adapt to this industry. And so, look, we've been waiting for regulation and just clarity for years, and it seems like we're closer to that, which I think, look, no matter what that is, isn't that positive? Because a lot of crypto markets, specifically stuff like Defi, I think we're in a standstill. A lot of people have just been kind of on the fence and on the sidelines, you know, talk about Eric, who came on the podcast talking about, look, we don't touch Defi. We don't want to touch it. We're sticking to bitcoin, maybe some ETH because of the regulatory risk. And so I think there's a lot that we can talk about in this episode about recent developments on the regulatory front.
00:10:19.588 - 00:10:52.394, Speaker A: But I'm hopeful that we get some clarity over the next 612 months, and that will really open up and set the stage for if and when they're not if, but when the recovery happens, it will be much more, I think, much more clear, because once you have regulatory clarity, you have a whole host of people that haven't touched this space for that reason alone. And I think that's a very sizable number and both in number of funds, number of people, but also capital that has been idle.
00:10:53.054 - 00:11:17.786, Speaker B: Yeah. There's one thing I want to dig into there, which is you're still investing in the private markets. It was Arthur at. Yeah, at defiance had this tweet yesterday, said there's a certain coin nuking 90% in a month, even without any investors unlock. That run was highly contested, extremely competitive, and led by well regarded investors. This venture market is broken af. The token is that VC is on the losing end here.
00:11:17.786 - 00:11:45.894, Speaker B: The main point that I want to highlight is there's a massive disconnect between how crypto, VC's, and the public markets value a project right now. The billion dollar question is, how will this valuation discrepancy get resolved? I don't see valuation in the primary market coming down hard enough yet, so I'd turn that into a question and just say, Arthur, saying the billion dollar question is, how does this valuation discrepancy between private markets and crypto versus the public markets get resolved? What do you think about that?
00:11:46.954 - 00:11:52.124, Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate his thoughts there. Also.
00:11:52.544 - 00:11:53.992, Speaker B: What was the token? Was it metaplex?
00:11:54.048 - 00:11:57.432, Speaker A: I actually don't know which one. Probably. Yeah, actually.
00:11:57.568 - 00:11:58.284, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:58.704 - 00:12:29.944, Speaker A: It got pretty. Yeah. Look, I mean, in bear you know, you're in a bear market when any news is negative news. I remember, like in February, in January of 2019, I was with Kane in the binance conference and like, synthetics was putting out like, really cool developments of transit, like very, like, updates. And every time Kane said, you know, we're in like the worst part of the cycle, when any news that we put out, we just see the token collapse another 9510 percent or more because people are reminded that they own this stuff.
00:12:29.984 - 00:12:32.008, Speaker B: They're reminded that they own it. That's, that's horrible.
00:12:32.056 - 00:13:24.586, Speaker A: I think we're in that. We're in that. We're working our way through that, right? There's a lot of capital in the private markets, a lot of dry powder. There still are a lot of the rounds that I've done are probably half of the valuation that they would have gotten in the last nine months ago, for instance. That is on the super early stage. I still think there's some fluff on the growth rounds where you have pretty large capital, because think of it this way, if you're like a greater than $250 million fund, 500 million to a billion, and there's a number of these, it is very hard to construct a portfolio on the early stage stuff where you're deploying like a million bucks, you're not going to do that. It's not very viable from a portfolio construction standpoint.
00:13:24.586 - 00:13:39.488, Speaker A: So what do you do? You're forced to do growth deals and so you want to allocate at least 2030, $50 million. And there's, those are, I think, the rounds that tend to, I don't said differently. I don't understand the valuation for a lot of these rounds.
00:13:39.666 - 00:13:40.068, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:40.116 - 00:14:42.420, Speaker A: You know, you invest in something at 20 million, it's largely a team bet. It's human capital, right? It's. For years you've priced these y combinator early stage rounds between 8,000,020, 5 million, maybe a bit more. The team is very experienced and, you know, whatever, but for the most part, like, how do you go from, we were going from 20 million round to like hundred million in a matter of months, sometimes weeks, and you're left wondering there. It's like, well, there's really no reason to justify a bump in the valuation other than there's a fund out there that wants to deploy capital. And, and there were a number of deals like that that I was part of, like I had invested earlier. And it's just a really bad dynamic because it, for instance, this token, if your token collapses, you know, you hire people, they're like, you give them a grant, they're left thinking that the company's worth officer 100 million, you list the token and then it collapses.
00:14:42.420 - 00:16:25.954, Speaker A: That, like, is terrible for morale. And I think there's just an, where crypto has historically been very difficult asset class from an investing standpoint, and also probably for founders, is this circulating versus total supply and having, like, price discovery on super early stage stuff, which like 99% of tokens out there are in full price discovery. There's a reason why a lot of traditional venture hasn't, like, you don't have a price for a lot of these things because it's really hard to value. In the panel that I was in Singapore, the question was like, have we bought them? It's always the question, right? How do we value this asset class? My question is, I don't know if we bought them because it's hard to value this, these, okay, you value things on a cash flow basis, right? Okay, fine, I understand that. But, like, you know, valuing, like, the Internet, like, Internet companies, like in the nineties and even in 2000, like, takes time to, like, formalize a lot of these metrics, right? And like, even when Facebook was doing its ipo, a lot of people didn't understand how to, like, social networks work. And I think we're still in that. Like, we're so early that, and that's the challenge, right? Is a company worth 100 million on a fully diluted basis? Probably, but the market is not as sophisticated to look at circulating and saying, okay, the token inflation is like 50 years, and the curve is very, like, you know, you should look at, like circulating more than total or, like circulating in a year or two or three years to understand, like, you know, can they really grow into the valuation? But, like, I'm getting too intellectual here because I think the market right now is in full survival mode.
00:16:25.954 - 00:16:40.162, Speaker A: And as soon as you get, like, you know, some ability to recoup your, your capital, you're gonna take it because you're. A lot of, most portfolios are in pain right now, and there people are not being very rational right now.
00:16:40.338 - 00:17:04.258, Speaker B: All right, let me, let me ask you this. So I had a call on, I think it was on Saturday with one of the, with a, with a huge, with a huge traditional fund, not a crypto fund. Huge traditional fund. He said it is. He said, you know, the market's bad. The equities market is bad. When my friends, other billionaire fund managers are calling their congressmen, their senators, their local government officials, telling them to fix the market.
00:17:04.258 - 00:17:12.994, Speaker B: He said, I haven't seen, he said that just started in the last two weeks. Folks are calling their congressman to do something about the market. You saw Van Eck?
00:17:13.074 - 00:17:13.290, Speaker A: No.
00:17:13.322 - 00:17:50.374, Speaker B: Excuse me, not Vanek. My bad. Vanek Ark, whose flagship fund is down 60% this year, just wrote a letter to the Fed arguing that they should stop raising rates and that the central bank has, quote, shocked not just the US, but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust. And this guy, this big fund manager, said that he hasn't seen this since 2008, 2009, when folks are so upset and spooked about where the market's going that they call their congressman. I'll turn that into a question about crypto for the markets to reset. Oh, and the last thing that he said is he said, but I think that we have one leg down because we have to bust. We have to hit full bust.
00:17:50.374 - 00:18:20.354, Speaker B: I think we have one more big leg down, and then we bottom in equities. Now, no one can predict the future, but tying this into crypto for the market to healthily reset, does the private market have to break? I think we can all agree it feels like liquids underinvested. It feels like I'm seeing a lot of funds that are fundraising with liquid strategies more than ever with liquid strategies. I think those will probably be really well. But does the private market have to break? Like this guy is saying, like, one big leg down before we reset?
00:18:20.774 - 00:18:25.878, Speaker A: The question is, are you even going to know if it breaks or not? I guess, like, well, you would, you.
00:18:25.886 - 00:18:28.358, Speaker B: Would see down rounds. Like we haven't. Like, you remember all those.
00:18:28.446 - 00:18:33.326, Speaker A: Well, you're seeing down rounds, to be fair. Maybe in crypto, not so much. I guess not in crypto.
00:18:33.430 - 00:18:38.318, Speaker B: I mean, there companies are raising down rounds. It hasn't been super public, I would say. I think.
00:18:38.366 - 00:19:01.814, Speaker A: Or advertise that. That's my argument. A lot of times you don't want to advertise that there's a down round. And a lot of times, and also anecdotally, funds, a lot of the down rounds are done by existing investors that have reserved some capital for their existing portfolio. Now, if you're an existing investor and you do a down round, you probably don't want to advertise that.
00:19:02.234 - 00:19:04.954, Speaker B: No, you'll do whatever it takes not to not advertise.
00:19:05.034 - 00:19:40.464, Speaker A: Correct. And so it's sort of this, like, adverse selection. Like, it's difficult to understand if you actually down or like, the private markets have totally shut down, I think. I mean, look, venture funding in crypto has come down pretty dramatically. Yeah, there's a great report, I think, that comes out. We can link in the show notes, but activity is down quite substantially on the private side. Even though you still have a lot of capital out there, I think, left to be deployed.
00:19:40.464 - 00:20:14.686, Speaker A: I think long gone are the days where you have these fluffy $100 million equity rounds. 200, 150. I mean, I'm seeing at least a 50% haircut on the super early stage stuff, which tends to be more defensive. Like, again, there's like a lower threshold. If you're a smart team, you're not going to raise sub ten, sub eight. But yeah, it's really the growth rounds where I think you've gotten the most amount of impact on the downside.
00:20:14.830 - 00:20:15.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:15.934 - 00:20:30.860, Speaker A: There's also one metric that probably is interesting to track at a perfect world is secondary activity, both on traditional venture and also in crypto, where a lot of times just equity gets traded because people are looking.
00:20:31.012 - 00:20:42.748, Speaker B: What that means is there's not a fund, there's not an actual raise. That happens, but maybe an investor is like, I'm kind of done with this deal. I'm willing to swap some. Or a founder to. Or early employees.
00:20:42.876 - 00:21:24.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I need liquidity. Like, look at what's happening in the UK with all these pension funds with guilt prices. Like, basically you talk about like the Fed and what it's done. Like, in the UK, it's actually more acute. Like, with this like, mini budget stuff that I've been tracking. Like, pension funds are like selling a lot of their liquid portfolio at like pennies on the dollar because they need to raise cash to meet liabilities. And so that, that's where I think I pay closer attention to illiquid assets because those are the ones that just when you see something that is a quality asset gets and someone willing to sell a particular project or something at like twenty cents, thirty cents, forty, fifty cents on the dollar.
00:21:24.854 - 00:21:39.502, Speaker A: That's pain. Yeah, that's. And that's where, I mean, that's personally where I see a lot of really interesting strategies going forward. Like, if you could probably raise like a distress fund right now to pursue this particular strategy.
00:21:39.678 - 00:22:09.552, Speaker B: I think you're right. Hmm. It makes me think about, I had this interesting dinner that you would have. You would have really liked this dinner. It was a couple folks in the longevity space. Like, it was God, who's the big longevity? So David Sinclair started this new longevity company, and it was the guy that he, one of the guys at the dinners is David Sinclair is basically right hand man who's like running the company. So some longevity, folks, and then some people investing in the creator economy.
00:22:09.552 - 00:22:51.476, Speaker B: And this one woman who's at slow ventures, Sam lessons thing, I think she leads their creator investing. They have these insane deals that they do, which is they will invest it like 25 to, on these 25 to 30 year agreements with creators. So it's like an income sharing agreement on a massive amount of steroids, right? Where it's not like an income sharing agreement. You might get the first two or three years of their revenue after they graduate college or something like that. Or after they go through some program. This is, you know, you could be a 20 year old influencer. You're getting a 10% or 20% of their revenue that they make in their entire until they're like 50 years old.
00:22:51.476 - 00:23:11.616, Speaker B: That's crazy. And the reason I bring that up right there is that sounds good. Until like things kind of, I was gonna, I've been thinking about like income sharing agreements and whether or not it makes sense to put a token around a person. Right. And like, what happens if you invest in, I think Alex Mezzo Mesmesh did that with the guy who runs showtime.
00:23:11.680 - 00:23:12.896, Speaker A: Yeah, the social tokens. Yeah.
00:23:12.960 - 00:23:28.604, Speaker B: But it's like, what happens when that token goes down 90%? Like if the Aave token is down 95%, that's fine. Like that. That's all right. Like Aave is going to build their way out of this. But if a person's token goes down 90, 95%, like, you're kind of screwing their reputation. I don't know, just maybe.
00:23:29.104 - 00:24:06.440, Speaker A: Yeah. There's like, this goes back to a more existential question that you always need to wonder is like, does this need a token? Do, should we be tokenizing XYZ? Should we be tokenizing music? Nfts? I still don't know if you're a creator. Look in a bull market, it's great, right? You mint these nfts, your fans are super happy. They make some money. I'll be Shao from the Defi alliance has a great, has a great observation, which is culture. Initially, one of the prerequisites of creating culture and community is making a lot of people very rich. And I think it's right.
00:24:06.440 - 00:24:46.324, Speaker A: And conversely, if you are having, if you have a token, especially right now, if you're a team, like you wouldn't in your right mind issue a token now. Because like, you know, it's not a very, it's like the reason why people, companies are not ipoing, right. And so it is, it poses an interesting question of, like, what is the long term viability of music, nfts of creator, like, social tokens and all this stuff. Like, it's very difficult when. When people lose money, you know, they become really nasty. You see the worst side of people. I've seen it time and time again in these bear markets and.
00:24:46.324 - 00:25:09.654, Speaker A: And people, you know, it's. I understand why that happens, but it's one thing, you know, when you're attaching, like, more personal stuff, culture. We just recorded a great episode with Melton, you know, on culture and the ability to tokenize this stuff, I'm not entirely convinced. It's. It's like, it's a killer use case, to be honest, for this particular reason.
00:25:09.774 - 00:25:10.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:10.094 - 00:25:17.078, Speaker A: You. Sometimes you don't want to put a real time price index on some things, and there's. There's a reason. There's beauty in that.
00:25:17.126 - 00:25:17.598, Speaker B: I wonder.
00:25:17.686 - 00:25:18.102, Speaker A: I should have.
00:25:18.118 - 00:25:29.114, Speaker B: We should have. By the way, great episode with Meltom on arbitraging culture comes out on Monday. Uh, we should have asked her about this because I think Meltom's take is that all making all markets more efficient equals good.
00:25:29.194 - 00:25:29.362, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:29.378 - 00:25:35.410, Speaker B: There are downsides, but, like, the more efficient you can make all markets, the better. Yeah, man, we should have asked her about that. But.
00:25:35.442 - 00:25:58.838, Speaker A: Yeah, but like, jason, I don't necessarily want to know if you're fully diluted valuation or circulating, you know, valuation of your token. The Yano token is, you know, 2 billion or 2 million or two. And mine is, you know, it's like, I understand that people want to size each other up, but sometimes, you know, we shouldn't do that or not.
00:25:58.886 - 00:26:06.350, Speaker B: That is. That is probably what it would be. I'd probably be around 2 billion. You'd probably be around 2 million. That is probably a fair. Yeah, fully.
00:26:06.422 - 00:26:13.086, Speaker A: Absolutely. There's a third. There's a. Yes. There's a thousand x differential between you and me, at least.
00:26:13.270 - 00:26:28.364, Speaker B: Let's get into. All right, let's get into mango markets. All right, so there are a couple of hacks. We didn't. We weren't able to talk about the binance hack, but I think it's just important to talk about that really quickly for anyone who missed it. And then. But I want to spend the majority talking about mango.
00:26:28.364 - 00:26:52.452, Speaker B: Last Thursday, a week ago, there was a vulnerability in BNB's chain, BNB chain's bridge. I think I'm going to get some of this correct. Most of this correct. That allowed a hacker to steal almost $570 million. It was roughly like 2 million. BNB tokens. The hacker only managed to move 100 million of the 570 million before 26 of BNB chain's validators halted the.
00:26:52.452 - 00:27:28.874, Speaker B: They halted the chain which prevented what could have been this huge, you know, over half a billion dollar hack. Samson, as always, had a great like highly technical thread. He describes the bounty related to how the binance bridge verified proofs that allowed attackers to forge these arbitrary messages. The attacker here only forged two messages, but the damage could have been a lot, a lot worse, as he describes. I don't know, there's been some discussion around this hack. If it demonstrated a vulnerability in the cosmos, SDK or tendermin, which BNB chain leverages, I think that was just fud around cosmos. I don't think that's true.
00:27:28.874 - 00:27:59.550, Speaker B: It appears that this really comes down to just, I think it BNB using pretty outdated code and just like failure to accept repository updates, which is interesting because if you remember the cosmos episode that we did. Oh no. They were talking about how polygain, Polygon uses 2018 tenderprint. But anyways, I just like all of these hacks. I'm not technical enough to really understand them, but all of these hacks, it just makes me think, it's like, it's like playing whack a mole. It feels like, it feels like there's like a new type of hack every time. All of these are like.
00:27:59.582 - 00:28:40.734, Speaker A: Well, yes, no, but like, there are, there are hacks across different ecosystems. I do think that you can narrow that down to some. So like, so like a lot of the hacks, for instance, similar to this BNB one where you fork a repo and then, and then there's a vulnerability in the original repo that doesn't get patched by the team that forked that repo. For instance, someone forked compound and deployed it in, I forget which other chain. Maybe it was BNB, maybe it was avalanche. There was an issue with that code that ended up being patched by the compound team, but that other team wasn't very technically savvy in my estimation. They didn't patch it, they got exploited.
00:28:40.734 - 00:29:36.414, Speaker A: And so I think that's one bucket where the team is just not very technically savvy and competent is forking code. And look, there are always, most of the time, vulnerabilities get exposed and it's the where they fault is not updating that. Right. So that's one, the second one is really allow around like this oracle problem, the oracle price feed and the ability to manipulate the price feed is probably the number one. If you look at the number of hacks and the sheer number and also amount that has been lost is largely because of this oracle problem. A, they're not using very sound, resilient oracles price feeds. They're using like their own or a weighted one that it can be manipulated via flashlights or whatever.
00:29:36.414 - 00:30:23.008, Speaker A: And in this case with mango, it was that they were manipulating the price of mango token, I think, and then leveraging in four x because they were able to manipulate the price of an illiquid asset, liquid market. So anytime you have less volume on a particular asset, you can, like, the price moves much, much more. And so, you know, they were able to manipulate the price of the token, then leverage that forex. So what ended up being a 25 million, like, you know, initial, they were able to like, take it to 100 million and borrow, I think, and withdraw that. And so I think, like, those two reasons alone, I think, encompass most of the hacks. Of course, there's some more. Like, that's a good point.
00:30:23.008 - 00:30:45.254, Speaker A: Complex and esoteric ones. But, like, yeah, at least in defi, time and time again, it ends up being that, of course there's always the social engineering, phishing, hacks and attacks. But, like, as it relates to like, smart contract code, it's really these two that, in my estimation, are the ones that end up being kind of the root cause of a lot of hacks out there. Yeah.
00:30:45.834 - 00:31:08.524, Speaker B: Let me get your take on this GCR tweet. I don't know if you saw this. This could just be like real, real big fud, but they tweeted out. Once you realize the majority of defi exploits exploits, in parenthesis, in quotes, the majority of Defi exploits are inside jobs, you'll be more wary of where to keep your funds. Always bet on incentives in a bear market fud or some truth, perhaps.
00:31:08.564 - 00:31:30.426, Speaker A: Some truth. Yeah. Like, I wouldn't discredit the potential for inside jobs. There's a lot of speculation around that, of course. Um, but, uh, yeah, I'll be candid with you. Like, I, I don't for a while. I haven't ventured into new protocols for a, like a really long time, actually.
00:31:30.570 - 00:31:30.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:30.914 - 00:31:47.950, Speaker A: Like, I. There's this idea of Lindy effect. The longer something exists, the more certainty you have that it's secure. And security, you never, it's never an end state. You never know anything is perfectly secure. You can't have that. All you can really bet on is the longer something exists.
00:31:47.950 - 00:32:18.726, Speaker A: Then, you know, you assume that people want to constantly hack into it, especially if the bounty keeps growing. And if that hasn't happened, then you can kind of rest. Not rest, but like, have reasonable guarantees that it's fairly battle tested. But like, look, I think we're in the state of the industry where it's chaotic innovation and, you know, people want to push the boundaries of new smart contract development. You still don't have hardened standards yet. And so I think, you know, things.
00:32:18.750 - 00:32:19.594, Speaker B: Are going to break.
00:32:20.814 - 00:33:09.944, Speaker A: Although to be fair, I've advocated for security. It's an area where I spend a lot of time talking to teams that want to. White hat hackers, like pawn no more or immunefi, some of these, like, collectives that are white hat hackers that I think do a really important job to complement what auditors are doing to just police and be watchdogs in the industry and look out for teams whenever there's a hack that gets. That happens. But, yeah, it's very difficult now, especially if you're yield farming in a new protocol that is really small or whatever. I don't even think the yields are there anymore to. If you measure, like, the risk.
00:33:09.944 - 00:33:41.280, Speaker A: I think the risk in Defi is still very high and high on the sense of, like, smart contract potential bugs, but also just you messing stuff up. You combine all the two and it's like you need to be very sophisticated, like full time and pretty technical to kind of venture into these things. And the sad part of it is that a lot of people are not even buying insurance like Nexus or, you know, or other solutions out there.
00:33:41.472 - 00:33:48.304, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm surprised there was $100 million on mango, honestly. Like, where's.
00:33:48.344 - 00:33:49.364, Speaker A: It's one of the more.
00:33:52.104 - 00:33:54.824, Speaker B: Right? I think. I think that's the number I saw. But like, that's.
00:33:54.864 - 00:33:55.856, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:33:55.880 - 00:34:16.660, Speaker B: It's a lot of capital. Wait, so this is what happened. Right, let me just make sure I understand. So the hacker exploited mango. Hacker basically levered up to get 100 million out of mango, exploited mango for the 100 million. They then turned around and offered to return a lot of the funds if the DAO promised to pursue criminal investigations against, like, some debts that they owed. I don't, I don't fully.
00:34:16.660 - 00:34:25.504, Speaker B: And then they used, because they had so many mango tokens, they used 32 million votes from the exploit to vote, yes, I'm doing this right now.
00:34:25.924 - 00:34:34.132, Speaker A: They. Well, the only correction there is that they. The proposal was that they would return the funds if they did, did not pursue criminal action against this hacker.
00:34:34.308 - 00:34:39.252, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. If they pursued. Obviously pursue. If they don't pursue criminal investigations against them, that's.
00:34:39.308 - 00:35:18.310, Speaker A: Then he'll return the funds and then he voted yes, which is like a decentralization theater. This is the problem. It's actually like a really interesting precedent for how governance goes wrong. When you have, I've said this for a while, I mean, the attack surface area for governance is there. The fact that you haven't seen as many exploits is not indicative of governance is really battle tested. I actually think that a lot of these protocols are not being very thoughtful on how they design governance for a variety of reasons. Economic voting like this can be problematic in certain instances when people are borrowing tokens.
00:35:18.310 - 00:35:59.886, Speaker A: For instance, in a, in a market like AaVE, for instance, if you borrow, if, say in a hypothetical example, you have, everyone is deposited protocol a, everyone, a lot like 30% of the supply is in this particular aave. Now the attacker borrows those tokens, submits a proposal, borrows. The snapshot happens they have a voting power and then they vote on it and you're done. Like you can introduce a malicious, like, proposal or. And so that's one surface area. I think a lot of protocols are not being as thoughtful as perhaps maker and other protocols that have like, thought about this, of how to mitigate these type of attacks. But these are going to continue to happen like voter, voter apathy.
00:35:59.886 - 00:36:33.996, Speaker A: Just given the CFTC recent, kind of like BZX Dow or the, rename the Dow, like voting and potential liability there, I think has, has kept a lot of particularly institutional players on the fence of actually being involved and participating in on chain governance until this matter gets resolved. And so if you don't have like a threshold where if there's a proposal and you don't have at least 510, 20% of all votes being casted, then the proposal cannot pass. Simple things like these that are intuitive are not embedded in most of these governance tokens. That's very problematic.
00:36:34.140 - 00:36:43.994, Speaker B: Yeah. Two interesting things that I'm thinking about here. One is if the mango team. So the mango team is obviously not going to implement the vote. Right. Right. So that just makes this vote very.
00:36:44.494 - 00:36:48.374, Speaker A: But what does that mean, not implement the vote? Like honor it, you mean?
00:36:48.494 - 00:36:53.678, Speaker B: Yeah, they're not going to honor the proposal. I would assume they don't honor the proposal. So then this government process just kind of looks like a farce.
00:36:53.726 - 00:36:56.354, Speaker A: Then since they, then you're back to Rari.
00:36:57.014 - 00:37:30.764, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's interesting, right? Like, it was a very, it was actually a very smart proposal by the mango exploiter. Right. They're proposing making the depositors whole by using the entirety of the $70 million insurance fund and in turning and returning 750,000 Solana and 800,000, like, M Solana. So I got one and a half million dollars of Solana, or one and a half million Solana tokens in exchange for immunity. That covers all the depositors, but it also pits the mango team against the depositors, which is very interesting.
00:37:30.844 - 00:37:43.014, Speaker A: Pretty sophisticated attack. Yeah, pretty smart. This is the thing. The operating assumption in crypto is it's a very adversarial environment. If it can be exploited, it will be exploited. It's just a matter of time.
00:37:43.134 - 00:37:46.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Anything else on the hacks?
00:37:46.494 - 00:38:09.004, Speaker A: I mean, there are a number of other hacks out there. The question, I guess, is for the more critical listener out there would be, like, guys, just, what's the point of Defi? Like, just close shop, and there's just continues to be a lot of. A lot of, you know, issues there. And I think. I don't want to. I think that we all. Obviously, there are issues.
00:38:09.004 - 00:38:22.040, Speaker A: There are a lot of Defi protocols. When I started, there were, like, five. Now there's, like, thousands. Right. And so, like, everything. I don't want to make it seem like Defi is like, all of DeFi is like this. Yes, it's very risky.
00:38:22.040 - 00:39:06.844, Speaker A: Yes, we need better insurance solutions. But that doesn't mean that because we have these hacks, like, things are like, every incremental hack makes us smarter about things that we need to patch if we're going to really build truly the future of finance rails. In many ways, we're playing with relatively small dollars here. Like, you want to settle a trillion, trillions of dollars in Defi. The optimistic view is these hacks, while very painful, just allow us to grow and become more anti fragile. And it's also to remember there are other protocols that are pretty battle tested out there. And so I think, yeah, it's just really unfortunate.
00:39:06.844 - 00:39:30.764, Speaker A: So, you know, anyone that's listening, like, whenever you're interacting with Defi, play with small numbers, like, and. And, you know, like, use the Horcrux model of use multiple wallets, check your approvals. There's, like, security hygiene. Unfortunately, a lot of people become complacent, become lazy. It happens to all of us. And look at what happened to winter mute. It's just.
00:39:30.764 - 00:39:42.920, Speaker A: It's unfortunately, like, there's no, like, undo button in crypto. Well, unless you reverse the chain, of course, but, like, that's not really crypto anyways. You get my point.
00:39:43.032 - 00:39:48.074, Speaker B: I get your point. Let's move on. Let's go. Let's talk about you guys and the sec. So, yeah.
00:39:49.814 - 00:39:51.966, Speaker A: Sec come knocking on the door of Yuga.
00:39:52.110 - 00:40:16.112, Speaker B: Yeah, SEc is coming, knocking on the door, Yuga. It's really not surprising, I would say, because, I mean, they raised $4 billion and launched a token or multiple tokens, many tokens, I would say, or many, many different NFT brands and a token. They're one of the biggest. They are the biggest NFT brand. They did a $4 billion raise. They launched a token. Uh, it's a good one to go after, I would say.
00:40:16.112 - 00:40:37.232, Speaker B: If you're the sec, just like headline wise, I would also say, as someone who would be on Yuga lives side here, obviously, um, me being as biased as I can get, it's probably a good one to go after with Andreessen's policy team and like, andreessen, um, like, I'm assuming they, you know, crossed their t's and dotted their eyes here. So, um, yeah, I mean, I think.
00:40:37.248 - 00:40:43.356, Speaker A: That is it, uh, I still don't know, is it an investigation or a probe?
00:40:43.500 - 00:40:45.772, Speaker B: My understanding is that it's information requests.
00:40:45.948 - 00:41:59.164, Speaker A: Okay, well, yeah, I mean, I think your point is good one, which is, of course, these, this will be a very interesting precedent for other projects in the NFT space. A lot of the, on the risk spectrum, and this is just kind of, I think on the risk spectrum of regulatory stuff, Defi is farther out and closer to things that are touching derivatives and options, financial markets and what have you. NFTs have been more on, like perhaps less on the limelight, let's call it that. But of course, the ape token just changes the dynamic a bit. And so it sets an interesting precedent for a lot of NFT teams that we always kind of talk about. Like this is utility being overhyped that we're promised. What does this mean for other NFT projects that have raised some capital and are you relying on the effort of others? What does the apecoin mean? It's one thing to buy a digital collectible, it's another to the apecoin introduces another dimension that feels much closer to, well, it is just like any other ERC token point.
00:41:59.164 - 00:42:10.132, Speaker A: Yeah. I wonder what the fallout is going or the, this is perhaps going to be one of the more interesting regulatory precedents set out there.
00:42:10.268 - 00:42:34.568, Speaker B: All right, so I listen to this four minute clip from the Jon Stewart Gary Gensler podcast. So John Stewart has a new podcast and they're dropping an episode with. He's dropped, he did an episode with Gary Gensler and they put out this little four minute teaser. And Jon Stewart really got to the heart of the issues right away. He's like, why are you going after. He was really, he was talking about like, DJ Khaled and like, Kim Kardashian. He's like, why are you going after these?
00:42:34.616 - 00:42:36.360, Speaker A: Floyd Mayweather, right?
00:42:36.392 - 00:43:06.690, Speaker B: He's like, why are you going after them? Why are you going after them and not Nancy Pelosi, Citadel, Blackrock and Gary Gensler, I thought, had a horrible answer for himself. He was not media trained here. It basically was along the lines of, or if he was media trained, his media trained into a good job. It was basically along the lines of, well, we will get sued. He said, we will have to face these guys in court if we go after them. It was like a wind about. He was trying to avoid directly saying that.
00:43:06.690 - 00:43:29.208, Speaker B: But, like, reading between the lines, it sounded like, we don't go after Blackrock and Citadel and Nancy Pelosi because we will get fined or we will have to face them in court. And we have small bandwidth. We don't have that much money as a government organization. And so we go after other people. And it was just like, man, it was such a bad answer. And this board ape thing, like, the first thing I thought, I was like, these rule. Maybe it is a security.
00:43:29.208 - 00:43:47.500, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I have no idea what is a security and what's really not a security. Like, everyone's speculating on that. I have no idea. But we need a new system because what did bored ape do? It turned all these regular, like, 20 and 30 year olds into millionaires. Highly speculative, sure, but it turned a bunch of people into millionaires.
00:43:47.500 - 00:43:50.540, Speaker B: And the SEC is like, we need to protect people from this.
00:43:50.732 - 00:43:59.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I it's really, I think it's the heart of the question here, Jason, which is a fantastic one, which is, what is the spirit of the law.
00:44:00.564 - 00:44:00.948, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:00.996 - 00:44:40.780, Speaker A: And what are we trying to accomplish here? Because I understand the most important thing from my perspective, when I talk to teams that I invest in, when, when I'm thinking about regulation, I always feel like it's. It's consumer protection and market integrity. You want to have fair markets and, and you want to have protecting consumers, which means, most of the time, information disclosures. Right. Um, and so, but other than that, like, I think, like, that should always be the guiding principle. To your point, what's the harm that is being done here from yuga, from tokens? Like, okay, absent, like, of course, like, price go down well. Well, that happens in any market.
00:44:40.780 - 00:45:24.316, Speaker A: Like, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's just like a market right now. The question, of course, is, well, like perhaps there should be some more standard and proper disclosures. And like, I get that a lot of this information is public and is embedded on chain and immutable records called blockchains. It can't be tampered with. And you have the certainty of, to, of certain parameters. And so the encouraging thing just to kind of, I think, like I've saw recently that the SEC created this sort of platform or department for like, to basically create this information, what do you call it? We should link it in the show notes.
00:45:24.316 - 00:45:52.460, Speaker A: But it's like this information department. I think that what they're trying to do is like just tell teams that have tokens, like these are the, the things that you like, fair disclosures. And so I'm very much in favor of that. I think that's a great idea, right. Of like, you know, when you're going to put out a press release, should it, like, you should communicate it on this venue, not on, you know, or, you know. And I think that's a really good idea. But you're right.
00:45:52.460 - 00:46:00.496, Speaker A: I, sometimes I'm like, how much harm or benefit we had from these accreditation rules at this point?
00:46:00.640 - 00:46:26.916, Speaker B: Yeah. Here's the other thing I don't like about this is it's regulation by enforcement. I'm really happy we're not building a token company and now we don't have the blockworks token right now because I would be like, here would be my mindset. I think it's the mindset of a lot of protocol founders right now. And NFT projects is like, I will comply with your laws. I don't care. I'm not trying to build the censorship resistant platform, whatever.
00:46:26.916 - 00:46:43.724, Speaker B: Most people, a lot of people aren't. They're like, I want to comply with the laws. What the hell are the laws? Just give me some. But they're not going to do that because they don't, they don't want another Howie test. That's not what they want. And I'm scared that this is just going to keep happening. Like regulation by enforcement, which is a horrible strategy.
00:46:43.844 - 00:47:17.562, Speaker A: Yeah, it's unfortunate. I'm optimistic that hopefully we'll get it. Just because it has become. Crypto has become a very important topic among the constituent base for a lot of. And politicians understand that. And that is, I think, the most important thing here, which is, you know, I think the more that politicians understand how important this asset class is from an innovation standpoint, from cultural standpoint, really capturing the psyche of the generation. Then.
00:47:17.562 - 00:47:40.818, Speaker A: Then, you know, at some point, you're just forced to, like, face it and address it. Of course, like, I've heard time and time again, the regulatory agency says the laws have been written and just follow them. But I don't. I don't agree with that. I think. I think most of. If most of the teams out there, to your point, in crypto, want to do the right thing, they just don't know what that is.
00:47:40.906 - 00:47:41.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:42.114 - 00:47:45.958, Speaker A: Or how. Or how to do it. They want to do it. They don't know how to express it.
00:47:46.046 - 00:48:04.750, Speaker B: If you guys are interested in the regulatory side, I would recommend you listen to the podcast we did with Rebecca and Jake. We also have. I haven't even told you this. We have a us senator coming on the show to talk about. Yeah. His views on Crypto, and he's one of the most prominent, I would say, pro crypto senators. So probably get some biased takes, but that's okay.
00:48:04.750 - 00:48:07.102, Speaker B: So, really excited to hear for that episode.
00:48:07.118 - 00:48:07.606, Speaker A: That's great.
00:48:07.710 - 00:48:09.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's talk about.
00:48:09.494 - 00:48:09.806, Speaker A: All right.
00:48:09.830 - 00:48:31.834, Speaker B: That was pretty bearish. Last, like, 30 minutes with the hacks and the SEC probe. There's a lot of good stuff going on in crypto bear market building that I want to talk about. The first thing being, there are three big ZK announcements over the past few days. Scroll, who we've previously had on the podcast. You are, I think, probably an angel investor in them, if I remember correctly.
00:48:32.494 - 00:48:33.318, Speaker A: Which one? Sorry.
00:48:33.406 - 00:48:34.734, Speaker B: And scroll.
00:48:34.894 - 00:48:36.158, Speaker A: Yes. Scroll. Absolutely.
00:48:36.246 - 00:48:38.194, Speaker B: Okay. Are you an investor in Zksync?
00:48:38.774 - 00:48:39.350, Speaker A: No.
00:48:39.462 - 00:48:42.434, Speaker B: Are you an investor in. Okay, well, we'll get.
00:48:42.854 - 00:48:50.366, Speaker A: This is from an l two perspective. I'm an investor in scroll and arbitrum. So, full disclosure.
00:48:50.550 - 00:49:18.614, Speaker B: So scroll announced the release of an upgraded ZKe EVM testnet that now enables you to officially deploy smart contracts on the scroll network. So that's first one. Really excited about that. The scroll team's like a bunch of big brains. Polygon officially deployed their ZK EVM public testnet. This one, just because of polygons, just what they've already built. This one's gonna, I think, be pretty interesting to watch.
00:49:18.614 - 00:49:55.474, Speaker B: Aave uniswap and lens are three blue chip defi projects that are already confirmed to join their testnet. It's the first, as I know, it's the first ZK EVM network with a full featured open source proving system, which is pretty interesting if you don't know what that means. We wrote a. There's a blockworks research piece on polygon that we can link to in the show notes. And then Zksync announced their layer three Pathfinder, which enables app specific l three s, which is going to be released to the public testnet in q one of 2023. So that's pretty interesting. I think Pathfinder is the first l three prototype that has this, like, ZK roll up as a fractal hyper chain in layer three.
00:49:55.474 - 00:50:04.836, Speaker B: If you have no idea what that means, go listen to our starkware episode that we did with the Starkware founders. Yeah, I don't know. This is pretty cool. I'm really excited about the ZK stuff.
00:50:05.020 - 00:50:27.792, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Look, I mean, I think, of course, the activity is not there. Right. Gas fees in ethereum l one are really low. And so again, I will remind listeners that there was a time where gas fees and ethereum and, you know, cumulative, there's like a terrible website that you can go on there and check, like the amount of gas that you've paid in a particular wallet and you want to get depressed. Just look at that. Right.
00:50:27.792 - 00:51:24.792, Speaker A: But now, of course, people, these are the kind of developments that go unnoticed, right? Because when you think about fast forward, in a year or two, three, once macro side users will come, there's killer great apps that are being built, and these type of developments really set us up. There's always a gap, right, between too much users or too much adoption and infrastructure. There's like this deficit that grows in these cycles. And I think we're in a part of the cycle now where you have infrastructure really, really kind of that gap, or at least converging on where usage meets infrastructure. And now perhaps infrastructure now being ahead of that. And when interest and usage comes back, gaming, nfts, other applications, payments, social, you have infrastructure like this that is critically important to support hundreds of millions, even billions of users. So really exciting across the l two fronts.
00:51:24.792 - 00:51:35.568, Speaker A: And these developments have been in the works for years, and it's very exciting to see them kind of launch all kind of at the same time.
00:51:35.696 - 00:51:41.344, Speaker B: Yeah. Feels like l two season, huh? L two season. App specific scaling season. Horizontal scaling.
00:51:41.384 - 00:51:41.512, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:41.528 - 00:51:55.058, Speaker B: We've got Cosmos and the app chain hype. We've got like, Celestia and SVM. The Solana virtual machine, like Frax is launching Frax chain, which is this, like hybrid ETH roll up. So a lot of cool stuff in the l two roll up space coming out.
00:51:55.106 - 00:51:55.894, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:51:56.234 - 00:52:04.346, Speaker B: I think just there are. There are other things that I don't want to spend a full segment on, but just kind of calling out some news arbitrum acquired Prism labs.
00:52:04.530 - 00:52:05.178, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:05.306 - 00:52:16.436, Speaker B: Which is probably the biggest, was really cool news. Really cool excitement announcement. Can you just share like, how much do you know about this deal? You were the first one of the first investors in Arbitrum.
00:52:16.460 - 00:52:29.988, Speaker A: Yeah, I was not, not the first because they had raised around, okay. Way back. I mean, the arbitrum team, off chain lapses, is thinking about scalability. They came out of Princeton. Really smart guys that have been thinking here.
00:52:29.996 - 00:52:41.320, Speaker B: A funny story, by the way, about that is my wife's grandma lives in Princeton. And she's like, yeah. She's like, I met these, I met this fella because one of the founders is like, he's like, I don't know, 75 years old or something.
00:52:41.352 - 00:52:44.176, Speaker A: Or like eight years old. He's like, yeah, yeah.
00:52:44.200 - 00:52:58.440, Speaker B: He's like, I'm out. She's like, I met this fella. He's working on this crypto thing. I was like, oh, like, okay, grandma, like, what is it? And she's like, it's called arbitrum or something. I was like, oh, yeah, that's a huge, that's massive. Yeah, okay.
00:52:58.632 - 00:53:22.828, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, this team has been like in the background working on thinking about scalability for such a long time. Um, and so this deal is, is a really good one, I think. Like the prismatic labs team has done a lot of great work on the, um, like scale. Like scale on the scalability side of Ethereum. Um, well, they were like, they were.
00:53:22.836 - 00:53:23.820, Speaker B: One of the core engineers.
00:53:23.932 - 00:53:40.198, Speaker A: One of the core, yeah, absolutely. It's Preston von Loom, I think, and Jordan. What's his, this other guy's name? Raul Jordan. Or Jordan. I forget his. Anyways, nonetheless, it's, I think it's a really interesting.
00:53:40.246 - 00:53:41.542, Speaker B: Raul Jordan. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
00:53:41.598 - 00:53:42.622, Speaker A: Raul Jordan.
00:53:42.758 - 00:53:43.078, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:43.126 - 00:54:04.524, Speaker A: Really smart guys. The entire team there is, I think, fantastic. One of the stronger technical teams. So it's great to see that. Obviously, the nice thing about arbitrary, I'm super well capitalized. And so I think, I think they found a really nice home to. It's great to see very smart teams find a how a home where they can just think and have the resources in place.
00:54:04.524 - 00:54:38.132, Speaker A: Because, again, funding public goods, if you think about like, ethereum, proof of work, a lot of that, you know, is supported by the Ethereum foundation and other people in the ecosystem. But, you know, it's always good to have the muscle of an organization like Arbitrum, off chain labs, that is super well capitalized. Right? And so, yeah, it's, this is really from my perspective, it's just very positive for the ecosystem. Of course, I'm biased because I'm an investor in Arbitrum, but I still think I'm very happy to see these guys, prismatic lab teams find a home, which is arbitrary.
00:54:38.228 - 00:54:54.076, Speaker B: Yeah. I had an interesting call. So arbitrum with someone. Arbitrum. Arbitrum has been, like, very technically focused. I would categorize arbitrum as focusing the least on marketing and biz dev compared to a lot of other folks. They just hired one of Jeff Bezos's right hand men.
00:54:54.076 - 00:55:06.756, Speaker B: Right hand, like people to be Arbitrum's new CMO, how to call it the guy. He's brilliant. Like, very, very interesting. So that's. I think. I have a feeling you'll see a lot more coming from Arbitrum soon. I think.
00:55:06.780 - 00:55:36.022, Speaker A: So look at how they did the rollout for the Testnet and then nitro, like, allowing every team to explore the testnet, play around with it, everyone on equal footing, which is different than how other teams have done it. And so I think it just speaks to the level of maturity of the team. And we ought to have AJ and Stephen on the show talk about, you know, there's a lot of really exciting developments on the arbitram side of things.
00:55:36.118 - 00:55:57.664, Speaker B: Yeah. Speaking of public funding goods, just one I want to call out Coinbase. They announced that they have a dedicated team working on research for EIP 4844. Yes. The. What is it called? Proto dank sharding proposal. I think it is, which is just an awesome name, but really, what 4844 does, it drastically reduces fees for rollups, creates this dedicated roll up call data fee market.
00:55:57.664 - 00:56:08.344, Speaker B: So that's. Yeah, just shout out to Coinbase. Good on them to be funding public goods. Yeah. By the way, did you see the Coinbase documentary? Brian Armstrong documentary?
00:56:08.904 - 00:56:10.192, Speaker A: No, actually, I've been.
00:56:10.288 - 00:56:10.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:11.032 - 00:56:12.056, Speaker A: Is it out now?
00:56:12.200 - 00:56:21.576, Speaker B: Yeah, dropped on Friday. It's, uh. Okay. I would recommend it. I mean, it's built. It's a doc, it's a. I put quotes around the documentary.
00:56:21.576 - 00:56:34.448, Speaker B: I'd say it's funded and, like, built by the Coinbase team. So it's more of like a marketing and pr thing. I loved it. I thought it was great. I'm like a. But I'm, you know, a crypto person. So I thought it was really interesting.
00:56:34.448 - 00:56:50.210, Speaker B: I'm not sure how much, like, non crypto folks would find it interesting, but I just. I. You like, I just. I have a lot of respect for, like, for founders and Brian, like, just seeing the Brian Armstrong journey and Fred. Fred Ersham's journey. Like, it's just seemed like there's some. Couple of late nights in there.
00:56:50.210 - 00:56:52.418, Speaker B: And I liked it. I liked seeing the story.
00:56:52.466 - 00:56:54.738, Speaker A: I'll have to check it out. Where do you find it? Netflix. Amazon?
00:56:54.786 - 00:56:55.654, Speaker B: Amazon prime.
00:56:56.034 - 00:56:58.386, Speaker A: Okay, great. Yeah, I'll have to check it out.
00:56:58.570 - 00:57:07.646, Speaker B: Other small news. Jared Gray. Nope, never mind. Not talking about that. Google Cloud and selected Coinbase to. Garrett's trying to make me dig into the horse now.
00:57:07.710 - 00:57:10.262, Speaker A: No, wait. Nevermind. Moving right along.
00:57:10.358 - 00:57:26.198, Speaker B: Moving right along. Google Cloud selected Coinbase to expand their crypto offerings. I thought that was pretty interesting. This was interesting, Stephan, the founder of Flashbots announced last Friday that he's left flashbots after a series of disagreements with the team. What happened here?
00:57:26.326 - 00:57:38.820, Speaker A: No idea. Not surprised. Bear markets always make some of these problems more acute and. Or people just leave. And so I don't know what the background here. I just made a general statement.
00:57:38.972 - 00:57:39.492, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:39.588 - 00:57:52.356, Speaker A: But I. My. I think we'll see a lot of. Well, okay, the. What is it? The CFO of Opensea also left. There's been a number of departures. I think he left because I guess he realized there was not going to be an ipo on site anytime soon.
00:57:52.420 - 00:57:56.184, Speaker B: Yeah, that guy wanted ipO. What? He was. I think he was like, the left CFO before that. He.
00:57:57.684 - 00:57:58.700, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:57:58.852 - 00:58:10.508, Speaker B: I don't know. Big shout out to Stefan that. He's like, what flashbots has contributed to the industry is not recognized that much. And I think. Yeah, just. He's. He's made a lot of great contributions to crypto.
00:58:10.508 - 00:58:20.612, Speaker B: So. Yeah. Big shout out to Stefan. BNY Mellon's probably the last news of the week on Tuesday, BNY Mellon, which is one of the largest custodians in the world, also America's largest bank.
00:58:20.668 - 00:58:20.836, Speaker A: No.
00:58:20.860 - 00:58:37.484, Speaker B: Excuse me. Oldest bank announced that its crypto platform is live in the US with select clients. They're now able to hold and transfer bitcoin and ETH. So big shout out to Bny Mellon. Way to go. I think Fireblocks is behind this. I think Fireblocks is powering this.
00:58:37.824 - 00:58:39.472, Speaker A: Yeah. Very nice.
00:58:39.568 - 00:58:42.204, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's all I got.
00:58:42.904 - 00:59:14.684, Speaker A: Well, I do want to leave. You've made a film recommendation. I will do a book recommendation or audiobook. On my way to Singapore, I listen to influence Empire, which is on the shortlist for the Financial Times book of the year. It is the story of Tencent. And the reason why I think is interesting is because my thesis, and I've said this in prior episodes, is I think there will be a Tencent type of app in this space. I think it's going to be a killer game.
00:59:14.684 - 00:59:45.810, Speaker A: It's just fascinating to observe how Tencent built an empire. And I've always felt that Asia offers a very good window into predicting the future because they're farther ahead in so many way, in so many different aspects of, you know, like, finance. Like, people don't have brick and mortar banks there, and they've just sort of leapfrogged a lot of things. And so, yeah, it's a really good book. I want her to learn more about the origins of Tencent and does it.
00:59:45.842 - 00:59:50.146, Speaker B: Portray Pony Ma as. Is that the guy's name you started, Tencent? Pony Ma.
00:59:50.210 - 00:59:50.674, Speaker A: Pony, yeah.
00:59:50.714 - 00:59:57.346, Speaker B: Does it portray him as someone who's, like, innovating and challenging Silicon Valley or is just, like, a copycat of Silicon Valley?
00:59:57.490 - 01:00:20.760, Speaker A: A little bit of both, actually. It goes into, of course, there were a lot of things that he also had a lot of reputation, even in China, of copying a lot of things. But I think it's a balanced take on, like, everything. It's, like, in this world of open source, like, yeah, everyone is standing on the shoulder of giants. Of course, there's, like, more. Of course, like. Like, I feel like when.
01:00:20.760 - 01:00:34.552, Speaker A: When it's, like, blatant copying, which I think is fair. Like, there was a lot of it in the. In the history of Tencent, but, you know, point to me, a company that hasn't borrowed concepts from others.
01:00:34.688 - 01:00:45.596, Speaker B: I read a quote. There was a quote that was circulating around Twitter from the book that I thought was just. I was like, damn, that's a good. That's a good line in the book. I think the author's name is, like, Chen or something. Something like that.
01:00:45.780 - 01:00:49.692, Speaker A: I'll tell you. Yeah, it is. Lulu Chen. Yeah.
01:00:49.748 - 01:00:57.148, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Lulu Chen. So I guess Chen has this great line. It's like Pony. So the guy who started Tencent, Tony Ma. Yeah, Pony Ma.
01:00:57.148 - 01:01:32.212, Speaker B: Pony is a master of creating products so convenient and intuitive that billions of people want to join his network. Yet in the back of everyone's minds is the knowledge that their every move, every location and utterance is documented and scrutinized, a fact they're increasingly and openly reminded of by the chinese government itself. So, I mean, I haven't read the book. That's the only two lines I've read from the book. But it. It seems like it might be this founder story that ends up turning into, like, this story about how does what has enabled Tencent to, like, thrive under this communist regime like, I'm assuming they probably talk about Trump and, like, curtailing american investments in Tencent.
01:01:32.268 - 01:01:38.468, Speaker A: So, like, yeah, they also talk about Alibaba and how you can completely play good and when you don't play good. Yeah.
01:01:38.636 - 01:01:41.396, Speaker B: Interesting. So I would. That's a great recommendation. I'm gonna read that.
01:01:41.460 - 01:02:13.760, Speaker A: It's a good book. Yeah, I encourage everyone. Speaking of, and the last parting thought, and I think it's an important piece here, is PayPal and their terms of service, which were updated to, like, withdraw. Was it $2,000 if they. If you were in violation, or they, if you did, like, in their estimation, you were doing, like, discriminatory or some other type of, like, basically, like, comments that you were doing in a social, public context, if they disagreed with that, they could withdraw from your account, like, up to $2,000, $2,500. Just ludicrous.
01:02:13.832 - 01:02:16.440, Speaker B: Ludicrous. David Marcus had the best tweet on this. David Marcus.
01:02:16.472 - 01:02:17.084, Speaker A: Yes.
01:02:17.664 - 01:02:23.624, Speaker B: Chief payments officer. Ran payments at Facebook and also involved.
01:02:23.664 - 01:02:28.176, Speaker A: In meta or like, in the CEO, PayPal, or.
01:02:28.360 - 01:02:45.614, Speaker B: He was an executive. Yes. Anyways, he said, it's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But PayPal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something. They disagree with insanity.
01:02:46.674 - 01:02:53.654, Speaker A: And a lot of the really good takes are, well, if you. This is just foreshadowing what central bank digital currencies could do.
01:02:54.274 - 01:02:55.574, Speaker B: It's exactly right.
01:02:56.434 - 01:03:06.374, Speaker A: So, anyways, good. Good place to round it up. It's good to be back and hopefully people enjoy this and we ought to do the survey. I think it'd be really interesting to see.
01:03:07.114 - 01:03:21.522, Speaker B: We're also announcing permissionless soon. So, folks, just get ready, get your fingers on the trigger to buy tickets. We're in honor of EIP 4844. We are going live with ticket prices at $484.40. So get ready for that.
01:03:21.578 - 01:03:24.574, Speaker A: Get this. Going to be in the same venue as last year or a different one.
01:03:24.674 - 01:03:31.414, Speaker B: We are moving. We will not be in. We will not be in Palm beach, actually. So you'll see in the US. Perfect.
01:03:31.454 - 01:03:35.214, Speaker A: Well, I. I do want to go to this one. Assuming airlines don't rug me again.
01:03:35.374 - 01:03:38.394, Speaker B: It's like the boy who cried wolf. I can't trust you on these things anymore.
01:03:39.214 - 01:03:47.142, Speaker A: No amount of. No amount of words can disprove. I'll just. Actions will speak here. So, you know, I'll just. This is the last thing I'll say.
01:03:47.318 - 01:03:56.716, Speaker B: Fair all right, my friend. This has been a great conversation. If you guys enjoy this chat, hit the subscribe button. It really helps. Santi me if you guys dropped like a review. Subscribe. Yeah.
01:03:56.716 - 01:04:03.364, Speaker B: Santi's got the big grinning face. Throw it. Throw the. Throw the arrows down. Santi, you're turning into a real YouTube influencer these days. You gotta quit.
01:04:03.404 - 01:04:08.860, Speaker A: I know. Have been media training condition by you. God. Anyways, awesome.
01:04:08.892 - 01:04:12.892, Speaker B: Everyone loves you. Have a great rest of your Friday and a great weekend. We'll see you next week.
01:04:13.068 - 01:04:13.524, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
