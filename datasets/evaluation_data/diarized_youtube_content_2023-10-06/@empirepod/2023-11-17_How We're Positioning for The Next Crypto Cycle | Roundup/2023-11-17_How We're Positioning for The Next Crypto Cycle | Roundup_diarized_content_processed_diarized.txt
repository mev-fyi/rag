00:00:00.160 - 00:00:21.350, Speaker A: All right, everyone. So on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We posted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code. Empire 20.
00:00:21.350 - 00:01:05.246, Speaker A: We'll see you in London. This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle Protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized Oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces Oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about chronicle later in the show. This episode is brought to you by Northstake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors.

00:01:05.246 - 00:01:10.702, Speaker A: If you're on YouTube now, let's get into the show. Okay.
00:01:10.798 - 00:01:16.638, Speaker B: It's good content, this good content. Well, I almost died last 15 days.
00:01:16.686 - 00:01:18.074, Speaker A: So you go by Jacob, huh?
00:01:18.374 - 00:01:24.462, Speaker B: I go by Jacob on Starbucks, like Cyrus has no business in. Well, I now I will change it, of course, because, you know, I don't.
00:01:24.478 - 00:01:29.126, Speaker A: Know, but JJ are so paranoid about being doxxed.
00:01:29.270 - 00:01:42.374, Speaker B: No, man, I'm not. I mean, look, everyone's dogs. I think the reality is, do you want to realize it or not? But, you know, it's good to go by different names. Do you ever think of, like, what if your name was, I don't know, Andrew?
00:01:42.754 - 00:01:54.362, Speaker A: Well, people call me. It's funny because people call me Yano, but my name is Jason. All my friends, everyone on crypto, Twitter, even. Even some of our employees call me Yano, but. But my real name is Jason, so.
00:01:54.458 - 00:01:57.354, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.
00:01:57.734 - 00:02:09.834, Speaker A: Anyways, dude, we had a big. It was a. Well, first off, you ran the marathon. People haven't heard about that. You ran the marathon, and you had, uh, influenza, it turns out, while you ran the marathon. So that's pretty ridiculous.
00:02:10.214 - 00:02:31.328, Speaker B: I was feeling pretty bad a couple days before flying in, and right before I started running the marathon, I never cramped up. But, you know, when you feel like your muscles are pretty, they're, like, twitching, and they're ready to get cramps, I'm like, I haven't even started running, and I'm feeling my legs like they want to cramp up. So it was like I was pacing. A good friend of mine from back home, so I kind of one of.
00:02:31.336 - 00:02:33.616, Speaker A: The guys with the signs, you know, the guys with the sun.
00:02:33.720 - 00:02:52.564, Speaker B: Like, I mean, I was. I wasn't one of the guys with the signs because I wasn't doing for everyone else. I was just doing it for a good friend of mine who's actually a professor, used to be a professional cyclist, so guy can run. He wanted to break sub three, and I was on a mission. So we both clocked sub three. I got to say, it's probably. Probably the hardest.
00:02:52.564 - 00:02:58.044, Speaker B: New York's always hard. But this was. I went to a deep, dark spot to finish it.
00:02:58.344 - 00:03:02.044, Speaker A: I was struggling, just pumping avicii.
00:03:02.424 - 00:03:10.424, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. No, I even stopped the music. I was like, I don't want to. Yeah, it was just. It was difficult. But we finished.
00:03:10.504 - 00:03:29.056, Speaker A: So it's funny, everyone started around the same time. Like, I was tracking probably six or seven people. And everyone started around the same time, except you started way ahead of everyone else. So I was like, in my apartment, just, you know, kind of eating some food. And I was like, oh, I wonder when, like, I'll pull up the map of everyone. And everyone hadn't started yet. Except you were probably half mile out from my apartment.
00:03:29.056 - 00:03:30.604, Speaker A: And I was like, oh, shit.
00:03:32.144 - 00:03:48.610, Speaker B: I had a feeling you were. You were there. By the way, Brooklyn is probably my favorite. Used to be in Manhattan when you cross the bridge and hit fifth. Sorry. First there's so many people. But Brooklyn is just so narrow and everyone's in the streets and Manhattan's gotten.
00:03:48.642 - 00:04:01.494, Speaker A: Cause I watched at around 8 miles and 25 and a half mile marks. And it's. Brooklyn's just more, it's like more grassroots community. Rooting people on Manhattan feels very touristy.
00:04:02.754 - 00:04:07.866, Speaker B: Yeah. Cause now they have barricades and stuff and so. Yeah. Anyways, fantastic. I love doing this.
00:04:07.930 - 00:04:10.878, Speaker A: Nice work. Sub three with influenza. We'll take it.
00:04:11.026 - 00:04:12.838, Speaker B: 257. Yeah, I'll take it, man.
00:04:12.926 - 00:04:15.918, Speaker A: That's what, 630 minutes or 635.
00:04:16.046 - 00:04:17.198, Speaker B: 635, yeah.
00:04:17.286 - 00:04:18.914, Speaker A: Wow. What'd your buddy get?
00:04:20.014 - 00:04:23.782, Speaker B: 259. So he just made it by under a minute. Wow.
00:04:23.838 - 00:04:25.798, Speaker A: Nice, nice. But who's counting?
00:04:25.966 - 00:04:26.994, Speaker B: Who's counting?
00:04:28.414 - 00:04:35.350, Speaker A: All right, so we have Das coming up March 18 to 20th, you're speaking. Got some big names lined up. Really?
00:04:35.382 - 00:04:35.550, Speaker B: Cool.
00:04:35.582 - 00:04:56.838, Speaker A: So two weeks ago we lined up a bunch of the big institutions, um, Goldman, Blackrock, folks like that. This past week we lined up a bunch of the big lp's. So we've got a bunch of big Lp's that we're announcing, unfortunately. So we have a competition internally that we're running. Santi. Each podcast basically gets a discount code. So right now, on the margin, Mike's show has driven ten tickets for Das.
00:04:56.838 - 00:05:14.804, Speaker A: With the on the margin code, we have driven zero. Now, I will say I got. I didn't actually record our ads until about a couple days ago, so they just started going live, the Das ads inside of these podcasts. But I will just say we're getting rocked. So people got to go use those Empire 20 codes.
00:05:15.104 - 00:05:16.924, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, no doubt.
00:05:17.664 - 00:05:30.364, Speaker A: I'm coming to London. I'll be in London. December 4, we host this thing called blockworks beers. I'm bringing blockworks beers to London. So December 4, if you're in London, holler 1st. 50 beers around me.
00:05:30.904 - 00:05:33.326, Speaker B: That's great. Should be really exciting.
00:05:33.510 - 00:05:37.914, Speaker A: And last bit of housekeeping, I passed you on Twitter.
00:05:39.094 - 00:05:51.654, Speaker B: Oh, now you're counting. Like, you still haven't even shaved your head. So, like, you have no right to make that a housekeeping item and. But sure, fine. Okay.
00:05:51.694 - 00:05:55.054, Speaker A: Higher for longer. Bald for longer, baby. No more.
00:05:55.174 - 00:06:11.974, Speaker B: I was gonna shave all my beard in as a good friend that I am. Like, all right, if you shave your head, I'll shave my beard. But, I mean, it sounds like a deal of a century to me. All right, congrats. You deserve it. You've been tweeting some really good takes. I have not.
00:06:11.974 - 00:06:13.630, Speaker B: So, you know, that's funny.
00:06:13.662 - 00:06:46.896, Speaker A: I tweeted this thing about Jupiter. This is actually kind of nuts. You drop Jupiter for the first time, and I've been hearing amazing things about Jupiter for a while. And so I was like, I actually got to start playing around and salon to defi. So I used some stuff and I played with Jupiter and had this, like, really, really phenomenal experience first, starting with the Phantom wallet. Like, it was a really easy integration with Phantom, with this place where I hold my assets, and then Phantom into Jupiter trade was seamless. Took, like a second to settle.
00:06:46.896 - 00:07:15.122, Speaker A: So, anyways, I posted this on Twitter, and the response initially was like, all of these solana folks getting really excited. The tweet got, like, 1000 likes. You know, it was very exciting. And then what happened is, by the end of the day, my inbox was flooded. And actually people were, like, screenshotting it and publicly posting, being like, this is what's wrong with crypto. Undisclosed paid shillers. I was like, wow, that's like, I think there's two communities.
00:07:15.122 - 00:07:39.054, Speaker A: There's one was the ETH community who I think maybe is feeling a little upset that the price hasn't gone up. But then it was a lot of, like, the kind of, like, shitty l one s from the 2017 era who I think got burned a lot by the YouTube, the, like, YouTube influencer crowd and probably got dumped on a lot by those folks. So it was just interesting to see that happen.
00:07:39.394 - 00:08:00.608, Speaker B: Well, first of all, look, we had one of our best episodes this week with Joe McCann. I've been following him. Look, he can be loud on Twitter. The guy has interesting take, interesting thesis on Solana. He just acknowledges node j's. You know, when you unpack, when you first hear him, he approaches it from a trading perspective. And then he, when you asked him, hey, look, can you just go deeper in your thesis and look, there's.
00:08:00.608 - 00:08:28.354, Speaker B: There's fundamental behind his thesis. There's fundamentals behind his thesis that I just think is perhaps not as appreciated. Yeah, and look, when you and I were talking about, like, so what should we talk about in this episode? I think this is a kind of environment where a lot of people and I can talk about all my conversations over the last ten days been with a lot of allocators, a lot of fund managers, and they're all asking the same question. It's like, what's everyone doing? I feel underexposed.
00:08:29.454 - 00:08:35.354, Speaker A: Am I late to the trade? Basically. Should I enter now or should I wait? That's the question. Everyone wants to enter now.
00:08:35.934 - 00:09:14.304, Speaker B: Not only absolutely, right, and it's not just retail, it is every other fun manager. What I want to impress on people is fun. Managers are humans. They have an emotional whirlwind as well. And everyone kind of goes through this, right? People are going get through, like, in the public markets, too. Like, am I underexposed to Nvidia or AI? And you look at the latest 13 fs and, like, it's obvious that, look, managing your emotions is the most important thing, especially in crypto, where stuff is so volatile. And anyways, I think this would be a good episode because it's, you know, we're not necessarily going to cover the news, but I think it could be a good one where we can just go deep.
00:09:14.384 - 00:09:52.464, Speaker A: Maybe we can start there. Sante. I'd be curious to. We've talked a lot in the last probably nine months about how we've both positioned our portfolios, headed into what I think we thought was going to be starting to be an up market. And I would just be curious to get your take on how you think about if you don't think your portfolio is perfectly allocated right now. And you see there's a new investment, let's say that you want to allocate to, but that has run up from, let's say, a dollar to dollar three. Are you waiting for that pullback? Are you just entering? How do you think about timing entries on investments that you think you want to allocate to, but you might have been late to?
00:09:53.644 - 00:10:25.826, Speaker B: It's a great question. One, I don't think there's a perfect allocation ever. And two, I'll go back and make, I'll make a general statement. You at some point need to just understand what your time horizon is and what you want to get out of it. And that really dictates a lot of things that you do from there. And so, for instance, during the pod with Joe, I had an idea and I asked him a question. Do you think bonk outperformed Sol? Because to me it was absolutely yes.
00:10:25.826 - 00:11:27.282, Speaker B: If you long saw then to me feels like bonk outperforms. It's just higher beta now, of course, it could be super volatile. And so one of the things that I've learned from, and I've heard it from like multiple really good traders, Stan Druckenmiller, for instance, great investor, he says, look, we don't make a ton of deals. If I like an idea, I'll put in a trade and then we start doing way more work. But you have to put in a small amount to justify putting in the work. And I think, and psychologically it really helps because even if it had a huge run up, well, it warrants doing way more, you know, spending more time analyzing that. Like, why did it run up? How far can it go? And one of the things I've been very wrong in crypto, and I just, it is my operating assumption is I will have very little understanding in how quickly or slow my thesis manifests itself, like my price target and having targets of what happens once it reaches that.
00:11:27.282 - 00:12:09.552, Speaker B: So, for instance, like bonk, I buy a small amount thinking that if I want to allocate 100, I will buy ten or 20 or 30, and then do more work, try to talk to the team, trying to monitor the position. And from there it's just easier. Because psychologically, for me, the worst is having a great idea, not doing anything, and thinking that you can do more work. And at some point it's like, well, how much work is enough to put in opposition? And so for me, if I have an idea of have a hunch and intuition, I'll just buy some and then do more work towards the goal of allocating more over time.
00:12:09.648 - 00:12:17.488, Speaker A: So you won't really look to enter. Let me take. I don't know. Let's use a real example here. Let me pull up a chart of something.
00:12:17.656 - 00:12:29.352, Speaker B: Oh, look, Solana, look publicly. I said in this pod, Solana hits eight. I think it's a good buy. Did I buy my entire amount that I wanted to? It's a difficult. Let's use a difficult.
00:12:29.408 - 00:12:51.452, Speaker A: So Solana hits eight. You buy maybe a little bit. You buy maybe some more at like, 1015 then. But then it goes on a crazy run, right? So now it's sitting at like 50 or $60 today, I think $60. But you're like, well, I want more exposure to Solana, but there's this psychological blocker. Cause you're like, fuck, I could have got it at, you know, $10. So then are you, how do you, like, maybe this is a real example here.
00:12:51.452 - 00:12:55.304, Speaker A: I don't know if you're currently considering allocating more, but, like, how do you. How do you play that?
00:12:55.764 - 00:12:56.564, Speaker B: Well, there's two things.
00:12:56.604 - 00:13:01.666, Speaker A: Why and do options come into this at all? It doesn't have a great question, because.
00:13:01.690 - 00:13:55.824, Speaker B: We did talk a lot about options in Joe's episode. So I think in the case of Solana, it's a difficult question to say. How did you allocate all you wanted to? Because as the price goes up or as fundamentals improve, the desire to allocate more may increase. And so when you ask the question today, once that has happened, well, naturally you have a skew towards saying, I wish I allocated more. But at the time, it just felt like a good allocation as a percentage of my portfolio, as a percentage of what I wanted to be liquid versus carving out for other stuff. So it felt right at the time, because I don't think you ever want to position yourself in a really, really uncomfortable spot. I think as slides, I sized it, what I felt appropriate at the time with a goal towards allocating more.
00:13:55.824 - 00:14:35.308, Speaker B: The question around, okay, it's had a huge run up. If you look at a price chart, it looks exponential. Gravity at some point has its toll. And these things, even Joe mentioned in the episode, they took some profit. So there's naturally people that take profit. That, to me, feels like a game, like, of trying to play, like, near term, kind of like trying to be cute on the price. The real question for me that I'm asking is, can Solana hit $500? Can it get 400 as a percentage of ETH market cap? Now, let me ask you a series of questions like, probabilistically.
00:14:35.308 - 00:15:00.536, Speaker B: And I asked Joe the same. It's like, oh, Solana sitting at 60, 50. Now, do you see it having a greater probability of hitting 100 or back to 20? And so I asked a series of these questions, okay, like, because there is this idea of reflexivity, and also as more price, you know, the price action is important. Like this idea of reflexivity as prices increase. It's sort of a self fulfilling privacy where the fundamentals improve more developers. Right?
00:15:00.560 - 00:15:29.572, Speaker A: Everyone wants price to follow on chain activity, but really on chain activity tends to follow price. So let me ask you then, this hypothetical, which is, let's say you believe something. Like you believe Solana is going to run. We'll keep with this example. Solana is going to hit $500 in this market, and it's at $60 today. Are you trying to time that and come in at a. Are you looking at things like funding rates and volumes and open interest, and you're trying to time maybe an entry at like 40 or $50? Are you like, look, I think it's going to 500.
00:15:29.572 - 00:15:31.784, Speaker A: I'm just going to enter the market now?
00:15:32.764 - 00:16:26.298, Speaker B: It depends. I mean, I pay attention to funding rate. Like, in this environment, like, when I just see a very quick run up, what I've learned and observed, every time I think I'm not going to see a price again, there's probably the time where I'm going to see it. Like, there's that meme where traders or people in Twitter say, this is the last time you see bitcoin below 30k or three. And it just, when I see that type of exuberance, I just, I'm cautious of, of, like, building a position I like to buy when, when days where stuff is down, just kind of, you know, like, just when there's a pretty big deviation in price, like, you know, down 5%, down 4%, down 10%. Those are the days where I come out and like to just, you know, chip at it a little bit more. Yeah, it is.
00:16:26.298 - 00:16:45.192, Speaker B: I appreciate trying to play cute a bit. You know, rationally speaking, you might say, hey, if you think it's 500 on the margin, doesn't matter if you buy it at 55 or 60. It does on the margin, like, just marginally. But there's something psychological about just buying on days when the market's down.
00:16:45.368 - 00:17:04.496, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people forget, too. I remember the road from three. I think it was the road from three to 20k for bitcoin. Or maybe it was one to 20k for bitcoin. There were six different pullbacks of over 30%. Right. So those six different times, you had the ability to enter the market at a 30% pullback.
00:17:04.496 - 00:17:36.456, Speaker A: So, yeah, I have a slightly different take on that, actually. I think it's nuts to try to time. I think there's timing the market and then there's trading the market too, by the way, which are two. So I have a lot of friends right now who are basically trying to trade their way to hire to a bigger stack. And to me, that's always seemed like a crazy strategy. And I think the helpful framing for this, in my mind is actually to remove yourself from crypto right now, because it's too in the day to day of the moment. Let me frame it like this.
00:17:36.456 - 00:18:24.000, Speaker A: And I first actually heard Michael Saylor talk about it like this, and I liked it. 2007, Apple launches the iPhone. By 2009, Apple gets the App Stores. And if you understood anything about software back then, you would start to understand that iOS would become this new ecosystem that was maybe going to be as important as the web. And over the last, that was 2009. Over the last 14 years, the mobile wave is now responsible for creating, let's call it, five to $10 trillion of wealth. It seems nuts to me to look back and say, could you imagine someone saying, I get how big the mobile revolution is going to be, but I'm trying to time my entry into Apple stock in 2011, right? I'm buying and I'm basically like, you know, Apple's trading at like, $20.
00:18:24.000 - 00:18:34.840, Speaker A: I'm basically trying to time this entry into at $18. Or can you imagine trading Facebook shares? When did they go public? 2014, I want to say. Or 13. Absolutely. Trading.
00:18:34.872 - 00:18:42.338, Speaker B: I mean, I was. I was a JP Morgan. When I was a JPMorgan, that ipo happened. No one understood. Very few people understood how they made money like social media.
00:18:42.386 - 00:18:55.786, Speaker A: I did this with Facebook stock, actually. I remember, um. Cause I was on Facebook all the time back then. That was like, the dominant social platform. And I was like, I want to buy some Facebook stock. And I was. I, like, was very new to the investing world.
00:18:55.786 - 00:19:16.760, Speaker A: And I think they ipo'd for like, either twelve or 20 or something somewhere around then, around there. But I remember saying, oh, I'll wait for it to pull back so I can enter. Like, are you an idiot? Like, do you not under did, like, did I? And so then I knew, absolutely, every time it goes up more, you psychologically are like, well, I saw it.
00:19:16.872 - 00:19:51.208, Speaker B: It will hurt more. Absolutely. Now, look, I want to impress. I definitely agree with this strategy. Time would have been better served back then. Pick your stock Facebook Nvidia, Solana to spend more time understanding the long term value fundamental drivers of that, you know, instead of trying to, you know, cute your way, like, buy your wintis Nvidia between 405 hundred. Well, is this thing going to actually be a 2000 then understand capex, understand their chips, understand.
00:19:51.208 - 00:20:45.746, Speaker B: Go and listen to the acquired pod where they do like four or five, six episodes of like, understanding Nvidia. Same with Facebook. Right? So I definitely agree with you in terms of if you're going to, as a percentage of your time, 80% of my time is spent on understanding, for instance, Solana. Okay, well, how many developers are actually building? Like, what are the problems with this? Like, one of the things that we didn't spend enough time on the, on the pod with Joe was what are the problems with Solana? Like, it is unrealistic to assume that the network doesn't have any problems. And I understand fire dancer and I understand, you know, reliability is improved. That maybe justified the move from eight to 60. But, you know, I think it just gives you way more comfort if you have a long term understanding of if Solana doesn't have a fair shot of being anything close to what ETH is or more.
00:20:45.746 - 00:20:51.346, Speaker B: And if it does, then you're absolutely right. Does it really matter if you bought it at 40 or 50 or even ETH? Right?
00:20:51.370 - 00:20:59.538, Speaker A: You think, you think ETH is going to be this generational global state network, global state computer, and you're trying to get it at 1800 instead of 2000.
00:20:59.626 - 00:21:41.100, Speaker B: Like it's a blip in the chart if you zoom out. So, yeah, you know, I remind myself, and I was talking to my, I'm in New York. I'm talking to a lot of my friends that are not in crypto, our venture. And the question really is, like, categorically, I continue to believe that this is the best investment that you will be able to make, like, crypto as a whole. If you were to bet on the crypto market cap expanding, I think it's the best bet that you can make over the next ten years. Like, average crypto, average venture, top tier. I was talking to, like, Vance has delivered, like two x or so, at most three x.
00:21:41.100 - 00:22:20.196, Speaker B: Like, if you delivered three x in venture, you would have been like the best performing venture fund. Now that's like 2017 or 2015 cohort. Forget about the most recent cohorts that raise way more money. And in Ventura, like in crypto, I just think that it's at least a ten x from here in terms of market cap over the next 510 years, and I don't see any opportunity, and I've dabbled in other asset classes. I don't see as clean of a trade to do that. And so if you think about it that way, like, just allocate and go about living your normal life and do research and read like, too, that comes.
00:22:20.220 - 00:22:33.064, Speaker A: From trading, it's like you could use all of that energy on something else. So let me ask you this. I don't know how comfortable you're sharing or how transparent you want to be here, but what does your portfolio look like right now, positioned into the end of the year.
00:22:34.804 - 00:23:00.894, Speaker B: Very long, within crypto or just within crypto? Within crypto. Well, a lot of my portfolio is in early stage stuff, doesn't have a token. You know, stuff like scroll, for instance. And I was, I am and continue to be really active in investing in privates.
00:23:02.754 - 00:23:04.694, Speaker A: Have you adjusted that strategy at all?
00:23:05.514 - 00:23:56.484, Speaker B: I've been thinking about. You have to also think about, okay, once that there's a token attached to a project, how you think about kind of the long term prospects of it. So, yeah, like, naturally, there's a big part of the portfolio, like, probably 50% of it, that is liquid and that is concentrated in ETH and Solana and projects that have had a token that launch, like blur, for instance, and others, aptos. And, you know, there's projects that, you know, not as financial advice, but, you know, these are projects that I've invested in, have a token, right? Arbitrum. And so arbitrum, as an example, is an interesting one because I'm still locked up. I invested when I was a verified, and then I invested personally in two rounds. I know the team very well.
00:23:56.484 - 00:25:12.238, Speaker B: And the question is, what do I do with that? Do I rotate back to Ethereum? Do I buy something like Solana? And it's always that relative kind of trade that I'm thinking. And my calculus is, okay, if I've already clocked in a certain return, what is the probability of it doing another five x from here? Because I can always take that money and invest it in an early stage project at a $10 million valuation, the probability of that doing a ten x is greater than perhaps a much later stage project to do a ten x within a five year window. And so it's always that relative calculation and always thinking of probabilities. Like, I just love framing it that way because it has given me much, much more clarity in saying, do you think ETH is hits three before it goes back to one, what's a skew? And do you think, what's the probability of Ethan, on a relative basis, doing a ten x versus Lana doing a ten x? Like, what do you need to believe for that to be true? Well, you know, and there's some. There's some trades that. Or some. I'm going to use trades and investments here interchangeably.
00:25:12.238 - 00:25:31.750, Speaker B: I know I shouldn't be. So if I do, please apologize. I'm more taking this from a perspective of an investor first, because, to your point, trading is just extremely hard. I don't. I've never met anyone that is systematically been good at trading in crypto. It's just hard. And so I approach it from an investing standpoint.
00:25:31.750 - 00:25:52.546, Speaker B: I think your mental clarity. There's more clarity when you start expanding your timeframe towards at least a year or two. There's a portfolio manager that called me and said, in the next ten days, what would you buy? I'm like, I don't know. Throw a dart to the board and see if it sticks. It's just impossible, I think. Um. But, um, on a.
00:25:52.546 - 00:26:15.810, Speaker B: Like, thinking of it in probabilities has helped me rotate from private liquids. Um, and also just thinking about the duration of my capital. Like, do I want to skew more liquid? Am I comfortable, you know, skewing more towards, you know, illiquidity and longer duration and so general things. But I'm happy to go through examples. But that's so.
00:26:15.842 - 00:26:32.274, Speaker A: I mean, when let's. Yeah, let's go keep going down that rabbit hole. So when you start allocating more to liquid right now, how do you start to think about that? Here's some frameworks that you could think about. Okay. Solana's gone up a lot. Other l one should maybe. So there's this big bear market trade.
00:26:32.274 - 00:26:45.390, Speaker A: Big bear market. L two trade optimism. Arbitrum kind of had their time in the sun during the bear market. You could say, okay, maybe that was a bear market trade. Bull market trade. Solana's gone up. All right.
00:26:45.390 - 00:27:05.094, Speaker A: Maybe there's going to be a new rotation back into the l one's, actually. Okay, so what are the best l one s out there? All right, well, then does it happen in, like, aptos and Sui and, like, Monad and some of these folks? Or is it maybe in the kind of older. Is it the avalanches and folks like that? Like, is that the way that you think about these things, or am I framing it differently?
00:27:05.874 - 00:27:29.894, Speaker B: I heard it from Kobe, actually, which is, I think one of the best investors in crypto has been and he's been around for a while. And I heard from him, he said, look, my best returning investments were once where I missed the first wave. And then I identified the second or third best. So, for instance, you missed bitcoin. I think you did. Huge litecoin position.
00:27:34.794 - 00:27:38.922, Speaker A: Oh, he's not saying this. He's not saying the next wave up. He's not saying no.
00:27:38.938 - 00:28:22.704, Speaker B: For instance, at the time, for instance, I'd missed axie. I had an allocation, it was small for the fund, and so we didn't do it. But you look at, that's where I paid a lot of attention into, okay, like, there is something here that is touching a nerve, like gaming display to earn. Whether you believe it now, today or not, I think we can talk about things that are hugely overlooked in this market, like gaming. But then, at the time, I was like, I missed axie. And I paid a lot of attention into that and said, okay, what do I do now? And then that led me to invest in illuvium. First check in illuvium after game and then do a number of other gaming deals.
00:28:22.704 - 00:28:36.464, Speaker B: Was it premature? DVD, right? These things take a long time. But there are. But that's what I'm trying to say. For instance. So now let's bring it back to Solana. A lot of people, I said, oh, I miss Solana. It hit eight.
00:28:36.464 - 00:28:42.936, Speaker B: I'm so stupid. Like, I should have realized, like, there's fundamental. Like, how many times have we had Anatolia here? Like, you know, we've talked about this.
00:28:42.960 - 00:28:43.120, Speaker A: We.
00:28:43.152 - 00:29:23.664, Speaker B: We constantly, like, revisited the thesis publicly here in this pod. And so the real question is, I think it's just a bunch of noise to look at something that has gone from, first of all, it didn't die. Second of all, there's been a lot of headwinds. Like, you know, the FDX estate and, you know, how much hasn't been confirmed, but, you know, their cell pressure of estates. And it's like, well, now maybe the best. You know, if something didn't die and survived and it's done this price action, like, then I think it warrants a closer look, actually, because of all the benefits. Like ETH was ETH, because it made a lot of money for developers.
00:29:23.664 - 00:30:28.764, Speaker B: Like, that's the best way to build community. And so Solana is in that similar position now where a lot of the developers got a bonk airdrop that's not worth, you know, half a million bucks. Like, do you think that doesn't come, like, if that's not computing into your thesis of the network effects that that will have in attracting more developers and funding more projects, and the rotation of wealth that has been created within the ecosystem towards other projects, then I think you're missing the point. So, so, yeah, you almost want to pay more attention when projects had this kind of breakout moment. And Solana is having that breakout moment, and that's hugely positive because it computes every, you got to believe that every other project out there is thinking, why am I not deployed in Solana? And every fund manager is certainly reaching out to more funds that are more Solana focused and saying, I feel grossly underexposed. What do I do? What do I buy? And that's just the nature, I think, of the state we're in right now.
00:30:30.984 - 00:30:53.372, Speaker A: So Joe talked about event driven investments versus fundamental driven investments. I'd be curious about how you. There's two ways to think about that, right? Dy DX moving. Launching Dy DX chain Uniswap, turning on the fee switch for everything. Like, there are these, like, events that happen moments in time that you can trade around. There's fundamentals saying, like, if you take that thing out. Yeah, yeah.
00:30:53.372 - 00:30:54.104, Speaker A: So.
00:30:55.804 - 00:31:37.888, Speaker B: Well, okay. Impossible to do event driven trading, I think, in a systematic manner, because it's, it's, it's like doing merger arbitrage. How much of that's priced in? Like, a lot of people understand the happening as an example, you know when it's gonna happen, but the fundamental question is how much of that is priced in? And no one really knows for sure. Right. Dy DXc unlock, like, unlocking events and other things that you're looking on chain. Everyone kind of understands. There's a great website, by the way, that shows, like, all the different unlocks and when they're happening, like, it's programmed, like you can expect, they do a great job.
00:31:37.888 - 00:32:40.044, Speaker B: Yeah. And so token unlocks are one of those things where the data is all over the place. There have been bullish unlocks, there have been bearish unlocks, there have been muted unlocks. For me, I think it's important to understand what the sell pressure is, what the token inflation is, how many more tokens are going to come online, who's going to actually buy, and who's a marginal buyer. Why would they buy? But it's very difficult for me to make an investment solely or just around these type of catalysts. Now, I think you can perhaps more interestingly look at that catalyst and say, okay, how did this maker, for instance, was one where we talked about publicly here in this pod and said, okay, we knew that the long term holders like e 16, z and paradigm were selling, but what do they know that I don't? They've been holding this for years. And I think you can take these discrete catalysts or events to inform your fundamental long term view on a position.
00:32:40.044 - 00:33:38.520, Speaker B: Have they lost conviction on maker? Or why are they selling? Versus who's actually buying these tokens? And so those are things that are pretty interesting because you can understand on chain why these things are happening in the similar manner that you can inspect 13 fs and saying, okay, what does Stan druck and Miller know about Nvidia? Or why are all these hedge funds selling oil and gas stuff? And take that and ask yourself these type of questions. Because the question I think that the biggest, I'll say this, the biggest problem when someone comes into investing is not focusing nearly enough on price. To take your example of Facebook or back then and today you could have said, God, I use this thing all day long. It should be worth a ton. But what is a ton? What is that price? Or similarly, someone might say, God, Amazon's everywhere. Like, it must be hugely valuable. I'm just gonna buy Amazon stock.
00:33:38.520 - 00:34:49.014, Speaker B: It's like, well, it's like when you go buy, like Howard Marks, like about this, when you go buy a car, like the first thing you ask is, what's it worth? Like, how much, how much am I paying for this? And people don't nearly do enough of an analysis of saying, what is this? What should this thing be worth? Now, crypto is really, really difficult because I don't, there's not a consensus of how you should value these things on cash flow or anything. It will take a long time, but it's hard, right? Like, how do you value bank? How do you value Solana? Well, I think Solana is easier to understand on a relative basis to Ethereum. I think that's the comp. And do you believe that it can actually hit what ethereum is or even be better than Ethereum then? I think that's how you take a look at it. And then, of course, the question is, well, should Ethereum be worth that much? And it's a difficult exercise, but I think it's one where you fundamentally just have to have a view on relative valuation. I think that's probably the thing that is most useful in crypto right now. Like one starting on, what is the aggregate? Like, should crypto be worth at least a trillion or a trillion for.
00:34:51.114 - 00:34:51.426, Speaker A: You.
00:34:51.450 - 00:36:00.184, Speaker B: Start kind of asking questions, well, what's it worth? To be able to seamlessly move money around the world for a lot of people, like untethered capital markets. What are the use case? Is stablecoin use case enough to justify all this activity? How many users do we have? What's it worth? Okay, is it worth at least 10 trillion? Like, well, digital gold, eight value of seamlessly transacting the Internet feels like it should be worth way more than 10 trillion. What's a value capture? And then just like, if you fundamentally, if you have a lot of conviction that crypto will be at least 10 trillion market cap, I think that's a good, like plant your flag and have a discussion around that and we can have it here. I fundamentally believe that it will be. It will be worth more than 10 trillion in ten years. And so if you believe that it's a ten x, there will be things that may do 100 x or a thousand x, and it's really understanding what are those things that are going to do that maybe they don't exist today. But I think that's how I would start.
00:36:00.184 - 00:36:40.200, Speaker B: And then invert from there and then saying, okay, bitcoin is perhaps more narrow, but something like Solana being able to power nfts and gaming and payments, and you start seeing stuff like circle and stable connectivity there and certain use cases that are not possible in ethereum, l one or l two today, like something like drip. And then you start, I think for me, then you start building a conviction around, okay, Solana could be a leader in this 10 trillion plus asset class. And it's worth today. I don't know how much. Let's take a look. Well, does that make sense?
00:36:40.352 - 00:37:06.512, Speaker A: It does make sense. Do you frame, when you think about your liquid portfolio, Santi, do you have, is it one bucket or two? And what I mean by that is the way sometimes I think about my portfolio. I'd love to hear if you think this is the right way or the wrong way. Is almost two buckets. One are assets that I have a price target on, basically. So let's say there's a token trading at $20. Maybe I'm going to trim half the position at 50 and let the rest ride for the bull market.
00:37:06.512 - 00:37:29.824, Speaker A: And maybe the rest of it, I'll start trimming it like 100 or something like that, or 300 or whatever it may be. Then there are assets like bitcoin. If you came out of the 2017 cycle, it was really just bitcoin for me. Coming out of the last cycle was bitcoin and ETH, where I could never bring myself to hit sell on bitcoin and ETH. And I feel like I have these.
00:37:30.404 - 00:37:33.224, Speaker B: Why not? Because you just don't want to exit crypto.
00:37:34.324 - 00:37:49.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I just don't want to. I believe that bitcoin and ETH will be two of the most fundamental networks to the, for the, for the next hundred years. And to me, selling those, I'm like, I'm going to hold, I'm going to hold those two assets for the next 50 years at least.
00:37:49.922 - 00:37:53.614, Speaker B: So why am I, how much, how much should taxes compute in your thinking there?
00:37:55.994 - 00:38:00.894, Speaker A: A decent bit. They have to, they have to compute in that, in that calculation, right?
00:38:01.434 - 00:38:02.194, Speaker B: Do they?
00:38:02.314 - 00:38:20.874, Speaker A: I mean, let's say, let's say you bought ETH at 2000, let's say someone's entering today and you're selling it at, and you buy one ETH and you're selling it at 10,000. That's an $8,000 capital gain you're paying. Depends how long you hold it for. But 15, 20% on that, that's got a factor.
00:38:23.094 - 00:38:28.014, Speaker B: Some might say you just have to think about what is a relative opportunity elsewhere.
00:38:28.134 - 00:38:53.126, Speaker A: Actually it's not a tax decision, though. It is a, I know that I want to hold these assets for the next 50 years of my life. So why am I trying to basically trade in and out and trying to, what I'm doing by selling is I'm trying to time the market. Um, sure. So that's, but I, but it sounds like you, you think that's not the right strategy and that every asset, no matter how generational it is, should, should have a price target on it.
00:38:53.150 - 00:38:55.166, Speaker B: Yes, yes, I think so.
00:38:55.270 - 00:38:55.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:56.094 - 00:40:01.632, Speaker B: Like I have more of, and I came in and investing crypto from a peer venture perspective. Like I'm going to buy Ethereum because I was investing in open source at the time and I felt that Ethereum was a huge unlock for open source development with a token as a smart contract. And then I wake up three months later and the prices went from seventy five cents to eighteen bucks. And then Vitalik is selling, I'm like, oh, what? Crypto just forces you to have more discipline in risk frameworks and management. Joe talked about, once a position hits a certain percentage of the portfolio, you have to take some profit and manage that. And I think one of the things where I focus more, my attention is, is this risk management, I think you have to, because not paying enough attention to that is going to force you to position you to probably do dumb shit when a position becomes more than 30, 40, 50%, 90%, of your net worth, like, you have. Like, look, I commend and respect people that have never sold a single ETH.
00:40:01.632 - 00:40:20.774, Speaker B: Like, I've known these, like, they participate in the ICO. They just still hold the bag. I'm not one of them. Maybe I'm more stupid, maybe I'm more or less disciplined, I don't know. But this is where everyone's just very unique. If your time horizon is forever, you're a Michael Saylor. Okay, fine.
00:40:20.774 - 00:41:15.724, Speaker B: But I still think that you need to pay more attention to risk management and protect your capital. And so when you're making, like, when you're making an assessment of going into a position, I think you need to have some sort of view around when, when and where. Like, at what price would I sell this? And one of the things that I constantly remind myself is I continue to make a ten x. I'll become the best and richest investor of all time. Am I gonna do that? Probabilistically, no, I don't think I'm that person. And so once I do 100 x in one position, I start looking very closely into, I know the odds are going to be way stacked against me. You know what I mean? Like, once you start making, and this was a bull environment that we were like in last cycle, once everything goes up, it's not you, it's the market.
00:41:15.724 - 00:42:12.000, Speaker B: You're not that smart. And I think it's important to constantly remind yourself of that. But, but you would say, why would I sell my bitcoin or east to take the other position and say, and invest in what? Real estate? Stocks maybe, I don't know, bonds? Interesting. Today, maybe not so much down the road. My best advice, and I don't want to give advice because everyone's different, is insulate your lifestyle. Get to a point where you feel really comfortable allocating whatever money you have, a pocket of money that it's not going to compute, because then, but the problem then becomes, it always computes. Because even if you threw in about punted $25,000 in the ETH of the ICO for, I gotta save almost everyone that became life changing money.
00:42:12.000 - 00:42:56.198, Speaker B: So what do you do from there? It's hard. It's really hard. Crypto does, like, I think we should feel incredibly, incredibly fortunate to be investing in a market that, and I tell this to my normal, like, former boss, he was a KKR first analyst at KKR, like, killed it and said, I probably have lived through more cycles. And if you've been in crypto for a while, I think you've lived through more market cycles and most professional investors that are in their eighties, like you just seen a lot, and that is a great education. But I don't think anything really prepares you for the type of wild prices that you see in crypto with liquidity.
00:42:56.326 - 00:43:34.466, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks 8th ever Digital Asset Summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from Standard Charter, FIS, JPMorgan framework folks coming out Wintermute Vanek Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference.
00:43:34.466 - 00:44:10.566, Speaker A: One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF two, a view from the buy side three, RWAs tokenization and stable coins four, global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got you back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is Empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off.
00:44:10.566 - 00:45:08.472, Speaker A: That is Empire 20. Today's episode is brought to you by north stake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors. North Stake is purpose built for institutions that want to enable the ability to move in and out of staked ethics seamlessly while controlling all aspects of their fund management. Northstake's tokenized ETH staking service offers institutions easy, low risk crypto yield opportunities, complies with both AML and Mika regulations, making it possible for institutions to tap into Ethereum's growth and earn staking rewards even through these pretty turbulent regulatory times in crypto, if you are an institutional investor seeking compliant crypto exposure and yield, north stake streamlines that all for you.

00:45:08.472 - 00:45:49.946, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the episode. This episode is brought to you by Chronicle Protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data. For anyone who listens to empire a lot, you know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle Protocol is this novel Oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for Maker and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, super excited to share here that Chronicles Oracle service is now publicly available for anyone to use, compared to using other Oracle services. Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees. They have an unparalleled level of transparency at Chronicle.
00:45:49.946 - 00:46:25.354, Speaker A: They offer a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides, marking this milestone in on chain data availability. Chronicle is endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, Gitcoin, Duidx, and Makerdao.

You can learn more about Chronicle at chronicle labs.org dot. That is chroniclelabs.org dot.
00:46:25.354 - 00:46:30.166, Speaker A: So do you have a price target on ETH where you're exiting some of your position?
00:46:30.230 - 00:47:36.834, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. You know, and, you know, ethan, three to four now, I have a view that eve probabilistically can hit a 10,000. I think, you know, and I can unpack that. You know, in terms of, I'm of the mind that l two s are very positive and then they will flow back, that, like, l two activity will flow back to l one. I understand that some people believe that, like Joe, for instance, we had this conversation. I think, you know, you have to believe that more users come, that the use cases are there, like, all that factors into the thinking of why I could reach ten k and. But, yeah, I think at that level, like, and along that way, I think the relative attractiveness of investing in something that could, that could, at that point to a cleaner ten X versus ethereum is how I would think of rotating capital from ETH into privates.
00:47:36.834 - 00:47:56.306, Speaker B: And it's really just that relative. I'm not necessarily leaving the system. I'm just thinking there's better investments that I can make, that I think I can ten x my capital or five x my capital. I wouldn't sell all of it, but I would sell chunks to fund the private portfolio.
00:47:56.410 - 00:48:01.734, Speaker A: Preston, what's your equivalent? Ten k. So ten k for ETH. What's your equivalent number for bitcoin, how do you think about that?
00:48:03.794 - 00:48:38.674, Speaker B: Well, bitcoin is really hard. Again, a commodity. It's base supply and demand and it is a bit harder for me to like. What do you need to believe for bitcoin to go from 35 to or 350k in terms of flows of capital? It's much, much more. It's just a more mature asset. And so you start saying, what do I need to believe for that to be true? Well, I think you probably need to see a lot of hedge funds, traditional allocators come into the asset class. You definitely need probably sovereigns to start buying this.
00:48:38.674 - 00:49:28.924, Speaker B: What does the world look like in that state of the world? And the thing that I have historically struggled with bitcoin is that I think it's an interesting non sovereign store of value at the time. For a long time, it was really the only game in town. So if you wanted to take your money and move it, it was really useful. But now you have stable coins, now you have other assets where you can do that. I struggle to believe, one in proof of work, one and two in the security budget bitcoin, and three in the false starts of developer interest and activity on bitcoin. I think it's really challenged. And if the developer community is tough, then are they going to figure out the security budget? And I worry about that.
00:49:28.924 - 00:50:06.080, Speaker B: And so I've started paying like, I perk up when I see developers talk about these things. But it's not enough for me to like, I feel much more comfortable holding someone like ethan, even Solano or stable coins because the use case is much, much more narrow. You mean like, like 8 trillion? Like historically thesis for bitcoin has been gold is 8 trillion or so that we know of. Like what is 94% of all gold has been mined into existence. Like we know the kind of reserves, but you know, it's a hard asset. You know, austrian economics, yada, yada, yada. Gold can get 8 trillion.
00:50:06.192 - 00:50:06.464, Speaker A: Great.
00:50:06.504 - 00:50:55.002, Speaker B: That becomes really interesting. It's eight x, ten x from here. But I just. Maybe it's because I'm more like in terms of technologists, I believe you start building a case as to why something like Ethereum or Solana can be far, far larger than that. If they power a number of different applications, like a sediment layer for the Internet, like what's that worth now the value capture is the. The TBD because we just don't know how much value will be captured out of those use cases. But this is where going back to example of Facebook, the learning that I had back then was I haven't seen a network that has had wild like, that has had very strong demand and usage and not accrue a ton of value.
00:50:55.002 - 00:51:25.088, Speaker B: And this is a mistake that so many people did with Facebook back then and other social networks. Like, if a network really has this amount of traction and demand, it will, it's easier for it to figure out value accrual and capture. But if you don't have that, then you really, you're in a very tight spot. And that's what I see with bitcoin. I don't see that problem with some, like Ethereum, Solana, you know, because they're just powering so many different payments and, you know, e commerce and all of these things will come on chain, I believe.
00:51:25.256 - 00:51:25.672, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:25.728 - 00:51:56.224, Speaker B: And the probabilistically, what do you think? Is that going to be bitcoin or is that going to. That flow is going to go to Solana or Ethereum? That's a smart contracting platform. And that use case is like that fundamental use case and demand driver is very powerful, I think will continue to grow far, far more than the demand for bitcoin. And I just have way more conviction on that and predicating my investment on that versus buying digital gold.
00:51:56.604 - 00:52:20.104, Speaker A: Yeah. What about the other bucket, which are the apps? When you think about a liquid strategy, I'd be curious how much of your liquid crypto portfolio is allocated to something like Uniswap, DyDX, Aave, rollbit, GMX. Not the network state, not the layer, but the applications on top of them.
00:52:21.584 - 00:52:57.394, Speaker B: Well, I invest a lot in that layer on the private side. And then like blur, for instance, you could argue is an app layer. It sits on top of Ethereum. It's a marketplace for nfts. Something like that was a big position of mine on the private side. Now has a token. The question I think you're making is, would I want to hold Blur or would I rotate back to owning something like Ethereum or an l two or Solana? I think it depends.
00:52:57.394 - 00:53:47.540, Speaker B: There are a couple of things that compute in my thinking. One, it's just been a thing where most investors have favored investing in infrastructure. Now, you could say that the marketplace is infrastructure, but I think the market cap of, let's just put it this way, the market cap of l two s and l one s has been far, is far larger than apps you look at DeFi combined is minuscule relative to all the l one s and l two s. The market just understands and likes these type of things. I say that because it is important to computer my thinking of, okay, well, it's sort of the family feud way of investing, which is it's not so much what you believe to be the right answer. It's like what others also believe. You know, at the end of the day, these are all investing.
00:53:47.540 - 00:54:23.848, Speaker B: The price reflects a consensus. And so, look, I think was really interesting. I think Defi is very interesting, right? You start talking about things that are overlooked, like Defi is overlooked. Yeah, the value capture. The problem is, of course, these are general statements, because the value capture has been difficult for some apps. You could argue that the biggest value capture, if a network gets a lot of demand. The simplistic thesis for something like Solana is you don't have to be right about DeFi or nfts or gaming to really take off.
00:54:23.848 - 00:55:28.714, Speaker B: You just assume, okay, if there is growing demand, either through MEV or others like fee, like accrual for validation, that network is going to benefit from all that. And it's easier to make just one bet. That bet, like Mev capture, you would have done far better investing in Ethereum and l two s than investing in DeFi over the last two years, because you could argue that most of that value just has gone through MEV. But I think going into, as I think about how I position my private book that eventually will become liquid, a lot of it is DeFi. I think you said it in the episode with Joe, Defi hasn't stopped working. And you could argue that it will continue to work, continue to accrue value some protocols better than others. As more activity happens on chain, they might use defi protocols on the backend, like games.
00:55:28.714 - 00:56:32.674, Speaker B: If you're trading in game assets, maybe that happens on a Dex that you don't even care about or know about. But that fee accrual, like happens right where I feel a bit underexposed is probably at the wallet user aggregation layer. I think wallets historically have been tough investments, but like something like Metamask is hugely profitable. Like, you know, so you buy consensus equity, I guess. Full disclosure, I own consensus equity, but they're charging a fee swap, and users very much not price sensitive to these fees as much as institutions. So anyways, I'm rambling a bit. I don't know if there's anything specific you want to unpack, but I would say it's probably 25% at most of my portfolio of app layer stuff that can change very dramatically depending on how these privates perform and if they ever have become liquid.
00:56:32.674 - 00:56:51.014, Speaker B: But let me ask you a question. Gun to your head. Would you prefer to invest in Solana or like Phantom Wallet and say Phantom is valued at 100 million, 200 million solana? Why?
00:56:53.154 - 00:57:21.586, Speaker A: Because anybody who uses, I think, any activity that happens on Solana and ends up either direct, directly or indirectly flowing back to the soul token. However, Phantom is probably going to have a lot of competition. I like Phantom a lot, by the way. I use Phantom, but they'll probably have competition from someone like backpack and, yeah, backpack metamask will. I don't know if they've already done this, but I'm sure at some point they'll launch soul support. If they don't already, they'll face a lot of competition. So.
00:57:21.586 - 00:57:22.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:23.914 - 00:57:24.530, Speaker B: What about.
00:57:24.602 - 00:57:56.876, Speaker A: I do think it's interesting though, Santi is right now there are only two. We're bucketing these in two different buckets. There's basically the network layer, the l one or the l two, and then the app layer. But if you look at how SaaS ended up evolving, folks were selling a product which I would define as the app layer and crypto, and then a few, and very few of them, but a couple of them were able to evolve into the, into platform businesses. So you look at Salesforce, for example. Salesforce is no longer a product business. They're not a SaaS company.
00:57:56.876 - 00:58:32.496, Speaker A: They are a platform company. Now, their business model is SaaS, it's software business, but they are a platform company instead of a product company. And I think a few applications in crypto are going to be able to make that, are going to be able to expand into platform companies. I think the first one that will do this successfully is Uniswap. And Uniswap is going to do it with their hooks. I think everyone's right now sleeping on hooks. I think if you actually talk to some of the developers who are on ETH and who are building marketplace businesses, there are a lot of folks building with, I think it was v four with Uniswap hooks right now.
00:58:32.496 - 00:58:38.454, Speaker A: I think it'll be interesting to see a couple of these apps evolve from just apps into platform businesses.
00:58:39.834 - 00:58:46.374, Speaker B: Yeah. And the monetization there is just more activity, more fees.
00:58:47.274 - 00:58:57.294, Speaker A: I'm sure there's a more right bell curve way to answer that with the monetization, but, yeah, I think, like the left bell curve way is, yeah, more, more activity, more, more fees.
00:58:58.234 - 00:59:22.714, Speaker B: Yeah. Because I mean, you're looking at Uniswap at a fully diluted .3 billion circulating four. So a lot of tokens have been, you know, in circulation like 80% of the tokens are 75 6% of the tokens are in circulation. The protocol itself generates a lot of fees that are going on the admin contract. The company itself is now generating interesting fee streams. So perhaps you believe that they're not going to sell the tokens.
00:59:22.714 - 01:00:00.636, Speaker B: So you look at the fees and say, okay, well, yeah, I believe hooks are going to generate way more fees, and it's trading at so and so. This is a cash flow. This is the PE multiple. That's like a fundamental way of looking at it. And you could say the same for maker. And like, I at some point believe that that type of thinking and investing will be rewarded in crypto, even though I appreciate that also, a lot of it trades on just memetics and, you know, again, like social consensus and people like, like bonk, for instance. You know, it's a culture coin, and you can laugh that off, I think, in crypto.
01:00:00.636 - 01:00:46.904, Speaker B: I think crypto gives you a really deep appreciation for culture and how valuable it is. We've just never had it. I mean, there have been perhaps ways to express these views, but it's very real, and I think it's a challenge coming in as a professional investor. If you go to a conference and you say that the best investment you can make is something like Bonk, you'd be laughed out of the room. But again, like, as someone a CMS loves to say, do you want to be, do you want to make money or do you want to be. Right? And there's all these different types of investing styles you can have in crypto. Fundamental, for instance, has perhaps not been as rewarded as momentum and some of these other strategies.
01:00:46.904 - 01:01:16.910, Speaker B: But, you know, I think where you can get into trouble is trying to do a lot of different things in terms of investing styles. Yeah, because of fomo. Because other, the worst feeling for a lot of people is not being able to process that other people making more money than you, and that leads you to do really, really stupid things. And that's probably the state where some bitter folks, or some folks become bitter because they see the success of Solana and they can't stand that because they missed the trade.
01:01:17.062 - 01:02:02.880, Speaker A: I think that's actually the toughest. That's arguably the best point in this entire podcast, is bull markets end up being entirely relative. Right? Bear markets, it feels like you're all in this together. And bull markets, you end up having a lot of fomo every day, whether, if you're running a company, someone else is always making more money than you, launching a token, whatever billion dollar market cap whatever it may be, if you're investing, there's always someone making more money than you. And I think that does end up becoming the hardest part of bull markets for a lot of people. Also, the reason a lot of people end up losing money at the end of bull markets is by the end of the bull market, you've gotten so fed up with that feeling that you end up levering up a lot and using leverage to try to catch up with your peers. But remember, it's almost what happens on crypto.
01:02:02.880 - 01:02:17.496, Speaker A: Twitter is almost what happens in real society with Instagram, where the only thing that people are posting on Instagram is the best, prettiest pictures of themselves. The only thing that people are posting on Twitter, on crypto, Twitter, are there wins. But remember that there are a lot of losses happening behind the scenes as well.
01:02:17.560 - 01:02:55.056, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Look, anxiety is very real, and I think the other more refreshing take, I think, is for a long time, public market investing was not interesting to me. I've now had to dabble a lot in public markets for a variety of reasons, and I've actually really liked that. I want to do more on public and liquid. Even in crypto, the market is like a truth machine in some capacity. And, you know, I think you could say, well, it's very humbling if you're wrong, and it hurts, for sure.
01:02:55.056 - 01:03:30.724, Speaker B: But I think, you know, it's actually incredibly the opportunity to kind of, like, refine your thesis, go on this journey of, hey, I want to find value. I want to understand my own investing style and framework and learn from others. And if you're intellectually curious, like, I just don't think there's a better journey to make than invest in public markets or even private markets. Like, it's incredibly rewarding. Like, you just continuously learn. Like, and you can never stay put an idle. Like, you know, you can.
01:03:30.724 - 01:03:59.024, Speaker B: You cannot do anything over ten years. But that doesn't mean you're not processing information. Like, you could hold Ethan and not care about anything else. But maybe throughout that journey, you probably have had to look at and process and reevaluate your thesis constantly. Or maybe not. You could have just, like, invested and left. But the more interesting thing is, once you buy something, even if it's a small amount, you have a vested interest to continue to learn.
01:03:59.024 - 01:04:27.834, Speaker B: Yeah, that was my first approach to investing in crypto. I wanted to learn more about it, and so I just punted money that. That I got as a bonus, JPMorgan, and was like, I'm gonna learn about this. Like, how much does a university course cost today? Well, maybe at the time is 2500. Now it's probably $3,000 in America, which. Which is crazy, but, you know, that's a good. Some amount of money is like, am I gonna learn more here than a semester of, you know, economics 101? I guarantee you we're gonna learn way more in crypto than what you're gonna learn in a cookie cutter university class.
01:04:27.834 - 01:04:51.786, Speaker B: Psychology 101. Like, you're gonna learn about anthropology, game theory, politics, you know, economics, finance, everything. Like, it is the best education that you can get. So that's probably worth at least 5000, $10,000. You know, university cost $250,000. So, you know, if you can afford that, like, this is a better education than a four year, like, bullshit course in economics.
01:04:51.810 - 01:04:52.186, Speaker A: Like, this is.
01:04:52.210 - 01:05:00.834, Speaker B: You're not gonna learn shit in college. It's a professor who's pontificating about risk, go and pump these meme coins, and then you'll understand risk really, really quickly.
01:05:00.914 - 01:05:29.544, Speaker A: You know what's funny about that? The. The oxymoron? Is that. So a lot of my friends and I went to Emory in Atlanta. Mike and I both went to Emory, and all of our friends who got business degrees ended up going into, you know, with, like. Like, business in the. In the capital b version of business, right? And Mike and I were our only two friends who didn't study accounting or the markets or, you know, what, finance or whatever it was corporate finance, right? In the business school at Emory. And I was a history major.
01:05:29.544 - 01:05:38.274, Speaker A: Mike was a classics major. And I think it's no surprise that the history major and the classic major ended up falling into the crypto rabbit hole in the way that we did.
01:05:38.974 - 01:06:31.168, Speaker B: Well, you know, like, at JP Morgan, we used to hire a bunch of people that are. Studied the classics and not business, because it is harder to rewire the brain of someone that has studied finance. And maybe not thinking first principles versus other majors are more malleable and more open to learning and doing inquiry. And I think, look, a lot of people miss Defi investing something like Uniswap because they fundamentally believe order book models are just superior and didn't really appreciate the distinction and the value of having something like an Amm price discovery for tail end assets, being a market maker for retail, like, all of that is. So I think it serves you well to constantly be open to learn about new, different models. And I think this is what we try to do in this podcast. Solana and Ethereum are different type of.
01:06:31.168 - 01:06:57.476, Speaker B: Are the most different type of l two s. Like, Solana is the most different type of l two relative to ETH. All the other ETH evms are just similar on the margin. But Solana is actually the first to be very different in their monolithic approach, and the team is different. So it's interesting just to pay attention. I'm not asking you to. To go and rotate all your Ethan by Solana, but at minimum, if you're holding ETH, you have to pay attention to something like Solana.
01:06:57.476 - 01:07:25.264, Speaker B: You just have to. I think if you're. If you're a professional, like, money manager, even more so. Yeah, I think. But the anxiety piece is something that, as we head into what I think is, you know, I don't know how much we're in a bull market for sure. Like, flows is something that Joe, like, we all look at stablecoin volume and say, okay, like, there has been an uptick. It broke the trend of just going all down.
01:07:25.264 - 01:07:36.904, Speaker B: Right. Stablecoins are flowing into the system. That's very positive. We'll see how that holds up. Like, we can start talking about things we want to see for this bull market. I think a lot of people are asking that question, too. One is, have I missed a rally? You missed this rally.
01:07:36.904 - 01:07:56.344, Speaker B: But are we in a more sustained period of more capital flowing into the space? Maybe that's something we can just talk about, like, now, because that's also probably computing to a lot of people's thinking right now. Is. Is this actually real, given all the macro backdrop and everything else is going on? Yeah, I don't know if you have a view.
01:07:58.644 - 01:08:23.976, Speaker A: My. I always thought the bull market was going to come, like, mid 2024. That was kind of my framing for it and what's happening right now. I want to be excited about this market right now. I really do. But I'm a little concerned about the way, about how it feels like we've all gotten a little out ahead of our skis with this market. And specifically, like, in my mind, a healthy market is a bitcoin led market that flows into ETH and.
01:08:23.976 - 01:09:10.705, Speaker A: And then. And then, and then converts into some other assets. And, look, not all crypto bull runs are going to be the same, but the. The fact that alts are running so far ahead of, uh, what I'd call, like, the majors right now is a little concerning. That's one bucket. The other bucket is, I do just flashback to the binance ieo bull market at the end of 2019 and where the thing that ran back then was really these ieos and the Alts if you remember that Binance launched their initial exchange offerings two years after the ICO era. And that kicked off this little like two to three month bull run at the end of, I think it was like fall 2019, and then we had the, this violent crash, obviously, you remember, in March of 2020, and then we got the very extended bull, bull market.
01:09:10.705 - 01:09:27.273, Speaker A: So this has been super fun. This has been awesome. I am cautious, though, about saying, I do think this is the start of a bull market, but I am cautious about saying, I don't think it's up only from here. I do think we get.
01:09:27.393 - 01:09:30.275, Speaker B: It's never up only, I guess.
01:09:30.409 - 01:09:43.856, Speaker A: No, I mean from 20, from March of 2020 to November of 2021, it was basically up only. That was 18 months of up only. And it was, it was crazy, but.
01:09:43.920 - 01:09:50.208, Speaker B: To be fair, but during that period, I mean, there were days or moments or weeks where you had a lot of volatility and, you know, a lot.
01:09:50.216 - 01:10:06.150, Speaker A: Of people, days and weeks. Like, what I think could happen is that we have either months of like months of consolidation around here or a violent pullback. Like, I do think this is the start of something real, but I don't think this is like the start of the up only period. That would be my high level take on it.
01:10:06.182 - 01:11:07.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're right in assessing like bitcoin stability and in price increase is probably very indicative along with stablecoin inflows, because you do need more capital to enter the space. So the question is, like, what is led the Solana rally? I think a lot of that is rotation into a trade of, you know, I guess you could say, well, ETH hasn't moved much, bitcoin has. And that new wealth is flowing into something like Solana, perhaps more than Ethereum. And so the price action on Sol is much more powerful. It has been more interesting than what it has been for Ethereum. And the one of the things that I don't fully understand is where is this capital coming from? There is new capital coming into the space. I wouldn't say it is like allocators in the US, like pension funds.
01:11:07.040 - 01:11:51.060, Speaker B: It's more perhaps in other jurisdictions. Like if you look at macro, like China has eased from monetary perspective and they're getting helicopter money because the government is worried about real estate and the economy there is not doing as well. Other central banks are easing, so there is new capital coming in from other places, not the US. But I do think you probably have to see flows coming in from the US to see resume actual prolonged bull market. But that's not to say that you can't make money. You can make money in any market environment. I think some of my best deals at the peak of the bull market last time, at least, very sensible valuations.
01:11:51.060 - 01:12:19.928, Speaker B: I think some of the best teams, like, appreciate that. Don't get caught up into, oh, I can raise at 100 or 200, I'm just gonna go and do that. I think they stay disciplined and raised. So that's actually a really good signal. But you can do terrible deals also in this market. And so I don't know. I think the private market still very much like, because, you know, like, the private market took, was it last to adjust? Like, valuations of the private market were the last to adjust to the bear market.
01:12:19.928 - 01:12:53.908, Speaker B: I think now you're seeing the opposite, where valuations of Seed and Series A, series B are probably, are still very much in bear market. These are like two and a half million, $5 million valuations. Like, teams are raising the bear minimum because they know they can't get it. I spoke with the largest fund of funds in crypto yesterday because I had an idea, and they're like, no one, no one is interested in crypto right now. And they skew us. Right?
01:12:53.996 - 01:12:54.664, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:55.284 - 01:12:56.744, Speaker B: So is this interesting?
01:12:58.364 - 01:13:11.624, Speaker A: I mean, I told you, we've met with the, I think, probably largest financial data company in the world this week, and they just cut as thing. I was telling you this on Telegram, they just cut their entire crypto team.
01:13:11.704 - 01:13:15.760, Speaker B: They just do a segment every day, an hour segment every day.
01:13:15.872 - 01:13:35.786, Speaker A: They wiped out their entire crypto team, and very soon they're making some more cuts to other crypto folks at the company. And they, it's just not, they did the same thing in 2019. They, they capitulated the bottom, and then they ended up building back their product team, the research team, their data team, their editorial team, and now they're doing it again. And it's, it's just crazy to see them compete.
01:13:35.810 - 01:13:47.250, Speaker B: That just seems highly irrational to me because crypto, like, crypto cranks out if it's up. Like, the only thing that's up only in crypto is headlines. Like, you can always, there's always interesting things to report on in crypto.
01:13:47.282 - 01:14:07.644, Speaker A: Like, it's because they, this is, this is where, so there's a fine line between looking at the data, listening to your customers, and having conviction on a bet. And this is a traditional institution over optimizing on listening to their customers instead of having conviction on the future. That's what I would say.
01:14:08.704 - 01:14:12.952, Speaker B: And do you read that to be a bottoming signal or a more.
01:14:13.128 - 01:14:30.014, Speaker A: I mean, it was a bottoming signal in 2019 when they. When they basically laid off their whole crypto team in 2019 after. So they so bitcoin rip. They spent 2018 building their crypto team. In 20 end of 2019, they laid them off. And that was, you know, March 3 months away from the bottom. I don't know, it makes us excited.
01:14:30.014 - 01:14:40.494, Speaker A: It's another four year cycle where blockworks can dominate, basically, and it gives us four more years of a head start on them, which is exciting.
01:14:41.234 - 01:14:50.374, Speaker B: Are you putting in more money into crypto now outside your crypto portfolio, or are you just rotating within.
01:14:53.414 - 01:14:55.678, Speaker A: My personal portfolio or blockworks as we invest?
01:14:55.726 - 01:14:57.314, Speaker B: No, no, your personal portfolio.
01:14:59.334 - 01:15:44.868, Speaker A: I put in a lot more, like six months ago when we were talking, maybe like three or four months ago when we were talking about this. I did invest a little bit more, like about a week ago. As I started to see her starting to rip, I started to really, like, press, I would say I just had a bunch sitting in USDC because, you know, what kills me is, uh, when you have to transfer from your bank into. Into whatever platform that you use, whether it's Coinbase or Gemini or whatever, you know, what finance or whatever it is that. That, like two or three, three day window if you have it, which sometimes it, like, transfers automatically some or instantly, sometimes it doesn't. For me, I never really know why, but that lag kills me. So I just.
01:15:44.868 - 01:15:54.704, Speaker A: I've had a bunch sitting in USDC and just earning. I think it earns four or 5% right now on the platform that I use. So, yeah, I just allocated a bunch of that USDC.
01:15:55.204 - 01:15:56.028, Speaker B: That makes sense.
01:15:56.116 - 01:15:56.644, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:15:56.764 - 01:16:33.208, Speaker B: Yeah. I've been dabbling more in public markets, and one of those is Coinbase, I think it's. Again, none of this is financial advice. I always ask. It has been an interesting question for me when someone's interested in crypto, I always ask them, would you invest in Coinbase versus bitcoin versus the majors? Like, do you think Coinbase is going to outperform? Because there are multiple ways to have a view and express your view on crypto? Right. You know, maybe in a tax efficient manner, maybe through options. Like, options have been tricky because they're not very scalable.
01:16:33.208 - 01:17:13.094, Speaker B: Like, now you don't have as much market makers that you can deal with, folks like Galaxy and Whatnot. But, you know, if you want to. If you want to scale this up, and it's a bit difficult to do, but something like Coinbase, it's certainly a much more robust option market. And you can do some interesting things to have exposure to that. And I always pay attention to Coinbase because there's analysts that obviously produce research reports and I think it's probably one of the best barometers for sentiment towards the Sasa class. And. And it's still very.
01:17:13.094 - 01:17:17.730, Speaker B: I think it's one of those names that is very not properly understood.
01:17:17.882 - 01:17:23.974, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. We both put on a decently sized Coinbase position, what, three?
01:17:24.314 - 01:17:28.002, Speaker B: It's my largest position, probably outside of like in the public markets.
01:17:28.058 - 01:17:30.654, Speaker A: Yeah, but same with me by far.
01:17:32.354 - 01:17:41.602, Speaker B: Now, of course there are challenges and whatnot, but I think the market doesn't appreciate like all the different components and what it's doing today.
01:17:41.698 - 01:17:55.094, Speaker A: Differences. I just bought Coinbase spot. You have some ridiculous call straddle seven different names, whatever, whatever it means. But yeah, we are both expressing.
01:17:55.674 - 01:18:14.480, Speaker B: I'll tell you what. Well, this is where I. When I say it's probably the one, one of the most under misunderstood names is the willingness for the market to short it and pay you an inordinate amount of money coupon to go to like, just have a long view on it.
01:18:14.552 - 01:18:15.112, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:18:15.248 - 01:18:35.270, Speaker B: And I think the skew is overly negative on this. And look, it's a very volatile name for sure. But when I compare the volatility of coinbase to other volatile names in tech, and just similarly volatile names don't pay this high of a coupon. And that, to me, leads me to believe that the market is just more negative on some, like Coinbase.
01:18:35.342 - 01:18:35.646, Speaker A: Right.
01:18:35.710 - 01:19:25.974, Speaker B: Because if the ball is the same for two assets, but the coupon is more like not marketing, but meaningfully higher. Like I'm saying, like a turn or two higher, like a volatile name in these instruments, like Phoenix elsewhere. Is it maybe getting a high teen coupon on a one year, like Phoenix, for instance, and maybe you're getting 15, 20%, 25%, maybe something like Tesla. But like for like instrument, Coinbase would pay like 45%. And I'm like, okay, well, like. And so the round of all this discussion, I think my thinking when I look at all this, I think it's difficult to understand how much is priced into something because I think you have to focus on price. Absolutely.
01:19:25.974 - 01:20:35.638, Speaker B: Like, you cannot just be like a fundamental in a vacuum. Like, you have to pay attention to your thesis, what is baked into your assumptions around anything you're touching and how much of that is already priced in. And it's the most difficult question because someone might lazily say, oh, I have a ten year view, no problem. Just continue to go up. I'm like, well, no, if it's priced to perfection, if everything that you believe is going to happen in ten years, everyone also believes that, then you're setting yourself up for like, making a terrible return because there's no margin, like Seth Klarman, there's no margin of safety for that to deviate. Like if, for instance, say, if for instance, the value of the price of the price of Ethereum or Solana right now reflects everything that we've talked about, like all the positive catalysts that, you know, there's going to be massive e commerce and payments and, and all this, like, value accrual, back to that, to the all one. If that already is baked in to the price today, then you shouldn't be investing because there are, there are assets out there that, where you probably can find a greater margin of safety.
01:20:35.638 - 01:21:36.222, Speaker B: You just have to believe that in your model, if you're not baking in a bear case and a bullcase and that fan of returns is not interesting and you're buying something that if there's a marginal deviation in that not playing out, then you sure as hell know that that price is going to be very skewed to underperform. And I think options are interesting. When you go out and look at that and how they're priced, I think it will give you a really good understanding of how the market looks at the name. That's why the exercise with Coinbase is interesting because I think the market is sort of, as our marks says, the pendulum is swinging to extremes of total left for dead. Like Solana was left or dead at eight, so I left for dead at 66. Now, it's interesting. I think it's working and it has a whole, a lot of reflexivity and that's positive for fundamentals, too.
01:21:36.222 - 01:21:40.294, Speaker B: But the margin of safety is much. Is different.
01:21:40.454 - 01:21:40.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:41.014 - 01:21:43.554, Speaker B: So you have to pay attention to this stuff.
01:21:46.734 - 01:21:49.754, Speaker A: I think that's. I think that's a good, good pod right there.
01:21:50.094 - 01:21:54.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, I think, like, there are other pods that just go and get wild.
01:21:54.966 - 01:22:13.224, Speaker A: I have some content for you. We. May we wrap it with some, some content that you'll like. So I listened to two phenomenal founder interviews this week. One was with Ryan Peterson of Flexport and one was with Brian Chesky of Airbnb. I think that Brian Chesky will end up going down as one of the greatest entrepreneurs, actually, of our generation. He's.
01:22:13.224 - 01:22:18.944, Speaker A: I'm going to send you this. It's on. It's on this guy, Lenny. Lenny's podcast.
01:22:19.244 - 01:22:19.804, Speaker B: Okay.
01:22:19.884 - 01:22:52.854, Speaker A: Anyways, I'll send it to you. It's phenomenal. The other one was Ryan Peterson on 20 minutes, VC and Harry Stebbins. Yeah, Harry Stebbins. And actually, there's this one part that I really like, that you'll like, because I know you love thinking these ProB. I know you love thinking these probabilities, where Ryan Peterson basically says, harry steppings goes, did you feel pressure when you got that $8 billion valuation on Flexport? He goes, no, because our valuation is not 8 billion. He goes, when you get a valuation on a company, that is a combined probability of a bunch of different things.
01:22:52.854 - 01:23:22.920, Speaker A: So he goes, there's a probability that our valuation is 80 billion, a probability that our valuation one day is a trillion dollars, probability that we are valued at maybe $10 million, because we go to. And some probability that we're valued at $0. So when I think about our value, like that is a moment in time, a sliver, that you take all of those probabilities and you put them at 80% expected value. Yeah, exactly. Now, there's obviously a classical form way to value a company. You take the cash flows and you discount them back.
01:23:23.072 - 01:23:40.832, Speaker B: But even the cash flows, like when you're making that assumption on cash flows, that factors in some sort of state of probabilistic state in the future over ten years. The terminal value. Yeah. Look, guys, probabilistic thinking is the most valuable thing that you can inject yourself into your framework.
01:23:40.888 - 01:23:42.164, Speaker A: Have you read thinking invest?
01:23:42.544 - 01:24:09.112, Speaker B: Yeah. Any duke or any. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, there's, there's a whole host of literature and just books that you can, or even interviews that you can, that you can read. Thinking bets is probably the best place to sync, but it really just, it really forces you to challenge everything. And when you thinking, you thinking probabilities, you appreciate that a probability is not static. It's constantly changing.
01:24:09.112 - 01:25:01.728, Speaker B: And that forces you to constantly be processed, to process new information, to update your probabilities of that expected value, whether it's eight or 80. And I think that the more interesting assets are ones where you have what is called a positive skew, like positive asymmetry, where the downside is fairly muted, and even in the worst case scenario, you get your money back. But in the best case of outcomes, and this is, I think crypto very much reflects his. We don't really kind of know the full extent, but in a version where everything in the Internet is being settled in blockchains, it is not a $1.4 trillion asset class folks, it just is not. And so what's the probability of that? And I think you constantly look at activity and you say like, nfts are a generational moment. Like younger folks love it, they're here to stay.
01:25:01.728 - 01:26:06.096, Speaker B: And you might look at all the volume near term and it's just noise because it's just beta users. But long, long term, you just, if you believe nfts will do x, if you believe games are going to do, yeah, payments like everything just moves on chain. And you support that with a number of like socioeconomic shifts and changes, like, yeah, I think, is it going to matter if you bought at plus ten, plus 20? Arguably not, but it's still important psychologically to just manage your emotions and prepare yourself for what it will be a very wild journey. But that journey can be really positive where you constantly learn and maybe listen to empire, or it can be extremely difficult because you constantly beat yourself up and ego gets in the way because you just, you just somehow believe that you can't make mistakes. And that's, that's a worse form because you will always. The nature of investing is you're gonna make more mistakes. Hopefully you make less mistakes than then the winning outcomes.
01:26:06.096 - 01:26:13.080, Speaker B: And the net of that is a whole host of learning and positive returns. So anyways, that's the pod.
01:26:13.152 - 01:26:14.152, Speaker A: Let's wrap it up.
01:26:14.288 - 01:26:20.288, Speaker B: Let's wrap it up, sir. Hopefully people can listen through my muted insignias.
01:26:20.416 - 01:26:22.044, Speaker A: Nipples really coming out.
01:26:22.464 - 01:26:32.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been resisting. But anyways, thanks so much, everyone, for listening. And if there's anything you want to listen or talk about or there or guests that you want to have on the pod, let us know.
01:26:32.452 - 01:26:38.540, Speaker A: I think yeah, you guys should tweet at us. We see all those tweets. When you tweet out guest recommendations or topics you want us to cover, we see all those.
01:26:38.572 - 01:26:42.404, Speaker B: So yeah, I guess as a teaser, we have a really good lineup coming up. Right.
01:26:42.444 - 01:27:11.196, Speaker A: We've tease out one episode. We have a really good episode with Kane, Kane Warwick on dropping on Tuesday. So we wanted this to basically be like conversation on Synthetix and Infinix, but it ended up just kind of being Kane's. I actually took, just really took a backseat because you have such a good relationship with Kane and you've known him for so many years now. It kind of just was Kane's musings on the market, synthetix and Infinix, but also the perps market l two s dows stable coins is really interesting conversation. So that drops two.
01:27:11.220 - 01:27:16.100, Speaker B: Sure. Awesome. Yana, great to see you, everyone.
01:27:16.172 - 01:27:39.030, Speaker A: Thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it. We wanted to take a second to just remind you about our upcoming digital asset summit in London, March 18 to 20th. I got your back. Seats are limited, and we hooked you up with a 20% off discount code. It is Empire 20. If you heard it earlier in the podcast, there's a little competition running at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets.
01:27:39.030 - 01:27:44.574, Speaker A: So when you register for the digital asset summit, make sure you use our code. Empire 20. See you in London.
