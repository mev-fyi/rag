00:01:44.545 - 00:02:35.571, Speaker A: I believe this is the first time that I'm hosting a Twitter space where I actually know every single speaker personally. So this one is a special one for me. I want to thank everyone and welcome everyone to the space. I hope you guys enjoy today and take the chance to learn something new. The focus today is going to be defi marketing and web free marketing in general. Okay? We're going to talk about community growth, we're going to talk about social media management, we're going to talk about content creation and we're going to talk about also about incentives management. With that said, okay, without further ado, let's go do a run up about the speakers, do a small introduction and I don't know guys, like I want this to be a free chat, okay? I don't want you guys to wait for me to invite you to speak.
00:02:35.571 - 00:02:50.905, Speaker A: This is a free discussion. I believe everyone here at least knows one or two people from the panel. So you are more than welcome to just raise your hand and come on board to speak and share your insights. Okay? Yog, my man, you want to go first and introduce yourself?
00:02:51.325 - 00:03:46.557, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. First of all, I think it's. I'm happy to be here with a lot of Known faces, you know, especially on the, you know, sticking circle side, the Turtle side as well. And I can see some folks from my anchor time here as well, which is, you know, always a good memory of course. As for the intro, well, I'm Diogo, I'm the one leading Martin at Renzo. I've been in the, well, liquid staking and liquid restaking space since its early inception, you know, 2020 and then of course restaking a bit later. Of course, you know, we've been through a prequel such as, you know, anchor on the, on the lst side and a few more went through big pharmacy know luxury as well, especially in Portugal, you know, and at Renzo, like just to give a brief intro, we're providing, you know, the best risk adjusted rewards.
00:03:46.557 - 00:04:10.525, Speaker B: One of our key focus right now it's the auto compounding of both staking and risk taking rewards which ultimately enables like our users to get the highest rewards. And that's something that, you know, in terms of marketing has been working quite well on our side. But you know, looking forward to speak about, you know, I've been doing marketing and like what's our take in this upcoming space? Yeah, once again, thank you.
00:04:13.265 - 00:04:16.521, Speaker A: Thank you sir. Happy to have you here. Go ahead for that.
00:04:16.673 - 00:04:34.875, Speaker C: Yeah, I can, I can take the mic. Hey everybody, it seems that you have some kind of a Portuguese crew over on the panel team. I guess Lunar Strategy is also based in Portugal. So welcome man. Myself, I'm Pedro. I've been in this space for the last, I know, four or five years. Started writing content, back for one inch.
00:04:34.875 - 00:05:09.875, Speaker C: Worked on a launchpad for a lot of time leading marketing, had my own marketing agency, although a bit smaller. We scaled that up from 2 people up to 34. Co founded Inception last year and now also helping Turtle Club kind of leading the marketing for their, for their protocol or product. And yeah, excited to be here at Turtle Club. We're pretty much connecting defi protocols to the struggle or the thing that they struggle the most, which is liquidity. Tvl Happy to explore it a bit more as we go through these space and yeah, excited for the talk.
00:05:12.815 - 00:05:26.287, Speaker A: Perfect man, happy to have you here. I've been interacting a lot with lrts and also following up Turtle Club growth. So I'm excited to hear your insights on this. Sarah, go ahead. Thank you.
00:05:26.351 - 00:05:51.227, Speaker E: Hello everyone. Thank you so much for the invites, Miguel. So yeah, so about me, I've been working in the Web3 space for the past five years. Always related to marketing, community strategy in very different projects and challenge. Now I'M representing Impossible Cloud Network as you can see. I'm more than happy to share what we are building, what we are offering to the market. I think it's a very ambitious project.
00:05:51.227 - 00:06:00.705, Speaker E: That's one of the reasons why I decided to join. What else can I say? I'm also Portuguese, so I can relate to the Portuguese crowd.
00:06:01.325 - 00:06:01.805, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:01.885 - 00:06:20.345, Speaker E: And that's it, I think. I mean as you mentioned, Miguel, this can be a very informal conversation. If you have any questions about what we are building and I mean any questions about like with web free marketing, Defi marketing in general. More than happy to just clarify all the questions and doubts.
00:06:23.045 - 00:06:39.045, Speaker A: Thank you very much Sara. I'm really excited to hear your thoughts also because of your experience also with NFTs in exclusible before. Really excited because I really believe that you're going to have somewhat of a different take here from the rest. Tim, last but not least. Go ahead sir.
00:06:39.385 - 00:07:27.525, Speaker D: Thank you so much. Just a little bit background. I'm originally from Sweden, but I moved to Lisbon about six years ago and when I got here I was basically having like crypto as a hobby. And then I was working in marketing. And then in five years ago, in 2019, I founded the Lunar Strategy, which is a crypto marketing firm. We have our headquarter here in Lisbon where we have about 15 people working from the office and then we have another 10 people working remotely and we work with ecosystems. In total, about 250 projects, I would say probably half of them in the Defi space.
00:07:27.525 - 00:07:49.535, Speaker D: And then we are also hosting in a conference here in Lisbon called Crypto AI com that is happening in about two and a half weeks from now and it will be the largest crypto AI conference in Europe. So super happy to be here today. And yeah, and talk Defi marketer.
00:07:51.355 - 00:08:21.451, Speaker A: Perfect man. Thank you for joining. Just a quick shout out here to the conference. Okay, I know that at that time a lot of the web3 people will be going to DEFCON in Bangkok. But guys, if you're not there, you need to be in Lisbon because we're going to have the Crypto AI conference organized here by Lunar Strategy. We're going to have Web Summit and I already saw like we have more than 100 side events already planned in Lisbon, so. So if you're not going to DEFCON in Bangkok, you should for sure be in Lisbon.
00:08:21.451 - 00:09:12.185, Speaker A: Okay. So without further ado, let's get started. Okay, we have some topics to go over today and I want to dive right in to social media management. I believe that's the first layer, when you think about marketing is okay, what is the teams doing for social media? And right now a lot of defi projects often rely on platforms like Twitter, Discord, Telegram just to grow and engage with their communities. And I'm going to throw a general question because I want to hear all your thoughts about this. What are some of the best strategies that you have been implementing yourself to manage your social media presence and grow your community in the Web3 space? And guys, whoever wants to come up first, just raise your hand. I'll be happy to let you guys come in.
00:09:12.185 - 00:09:16.801, Speaker A: If you have any intakes, feel free to jump in and talk.
00:09:16.873 - 00:09:23.737, Speaker B: Okay, what was the question, Miguel? I broke up here a bit on the Twitter space side.
00:09:23.841 - 00:09:47.825, Speaker A: No problem sir. It's like a general question because I want to allow everyone to just share the takes. My question is right now, like everyone has been using Twitter, Discord and Telegram mainly to promote their protocols for G5. And my question is, what are some of the best strategies that you have been implementing yourself for a protocol to grow your social media presence and your community? Also.
00:09:49.605 - 00:10:38.615, Speaker B: I mean I can start. I do feel like, you know, then Verdaj could also shed some light on this. I feel like we share a lot of the same visions and insights on the side. I do think that, you know, at least on Renzo side, one thing that we've been focusing a lot is co marketing, especially because it allows us to convert users from our partners that we already know that are first of all our token holders. Like second of all, they have an interest on these kind of products. So we end up increasing the conversion from doing these targeted campaigns with partners. And usually we try to do it on, you know, like on a, on a timeframe that allows us to provide a bit of consistency when talking about, you know, our products.
00:10:38.615 - 00:12:22.551, Speaker B: One thing that I firmly believe is that for example, when we look at how we pretty much share specific product announcements and we have, you know, the specific verticals like pr, overall socials, community events, what I do see a lot of protocols doing is focusing heavily on the first day of the announcement and taking into consideration the current attention spawn on Twitter and across, I mean overall human society, I don't think that that works quite well. I think overall allowing users to consistently read educational and explanatory content on the given announcement or product is always the best. And my preference on doing these weekly campaigns with these partners. Another thing that I also try to do is like things that usually convert towards not only users but followers and end up attracting Even perhaps users that weren't kind of aware of what Renzo was doing is through the way we produce content at Renzo, which is, and this, you know, has been shifting, you know, it's a fast paced environment especially because, you know, Renzo is a protocol that is currently releasing a lot of new products and such. One thing that we've been doing is content is clearly focused on the benefits that is easily understandable by the user. And sometimes I do feel like for marketing teams it's fairly complicated to put ourselves. We're so focused on producing good content that we sometimes overestimate how the user clearly understands the content.
00:12:22.551 - 00:13:06.751, Speaker B: And this is why I always tell people, if you're testing new UXes, if you're testing new campaigns, if you're testing the way you explain a specific product, go to your family, go to your wife, your girlfriend, wherever, just ask them and see how they construct their logic upon the new product or announcement. And these will shed some light on. Now you should be also producing your content so it's like it's more appealing and it's actually highly shareable. On the highly shareable side, we try to focus on, you know, more research based but still easy to understand, especially with comparisons. For example. Sometimes on the research side I feel like it's very difficult as well. Sorry.
00:13:06.751 - 00:13:34.725, Speaker B: It's very easy to kind of sense that users will understand everything that you're saying. Just because for you constructing the research piece, it's easy but it's actually the opposite. You need to have added, you know, kind of attention to the way you're putting out stuff. So that's something that we've been seeing that's working quite well. I'm just thinking if I have anything else and probably Verlaj, we talk a lot.
00:13:34.805 - 00:14:06.521, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I can take it from there. I agree on the LE5 or explain, explain me like I'm five approach. When it comes to social media, you need to ensure that users are aware of what we're talking about. Usually like these kind of DEFI products or protocols are not that easy to understand for the not so savvy defi users. So we really need to ensure that they know what we're talking about. And in the case of Turtle, for example, like we, we believe that liquidity flows where there's less friction.
00:14:06.521 - 00:15:14.683, Speaker C: So our goal is to ensure there's no friction or not a lot of friction when it comes to social media and the dapp. So we focus on working on the product first and then we kind of translate that approach onto Social media then when it comes to content and content calendars and all of that kind of stuff, obviously I think there needs to be a lot of categories when it comes to the content that you put out there. I do also do a lot of co marketing approach or initiatives where we go through our partner protocol, we explain what they do and we try to convert some of their users onto ours because the value prop is pretty easy in that regard. And then we also try to connect with some of the thought leadership guys within the industry. I'm not talking kols, but more thought leadership. And nowadays we have a bunch of tools to tell us who are these guys and what they bring to the table being Kaito, AI and few other tools that you can use. So yeah, there's a bunch of stuff that you can do in regards to social media.
00:15:14.683 - 00:15:26.619, Speaker C: We want to explain it easily for the user and we also want to keep it a bit funny and meme because in the end of the day we're, we're in crypto, I mean over.
00:15:26.667 - 00:16:47.361, Speaker B: That, just, just jumping on like what you were saying like quickly. I think even on the converting side it's important to, you know, like sometimes I find myself thinking like, all right, of course on the converting side we can do content, but like overall campaign, how can I make it easier for users to take the leap towards, you know, in this, in this scenario reins are right and you know, this is something that the marketers should ask themselves because thinking about marketing from a perspective or just content won't do much instead of, at least I prefer to find a quantifiable way on which, you know, I can see if the conversions are taking place. And then it's also important, you know, specifically because, and you were saying that very well, we are on a space specifically liquid restaking and liquid staking on which even the terms are quite difficult to understand. You know, you know, when you look at, you know, and you know, we've been with Eigenlayer since the, since their inception. Now we're with Geo now and Solana since their inception into restaking as well and all of these terms around NCNs and AVSS and then you know, we're talking about custom quorums and you know, programmatic incentives. It's not easy for user itself to understand. And sometimes like for example, if I see these kind of terms on the first titles of like these kind of pieces going on, I'm like, you know, you lost me already.
00:16:47.361 - 00:17:34.069, Speaker B: So it's also very important to ensure that the partner itself is making good job on making content about you like you guys, Turtle or us at Renzo. Yeah, that's. And specifically another thing that I would advise is when we're talking about, well, keeping the leaders, especially the researchers, it's very important to, from a marketing perspective to fairly understand the technical aspect of the protocol in which you're working with. Because this will pretty much allow you to create a better relationship with these folks. Then it will translate into better content being made in higher regularity as well, higher support from their side as well. So this is something that I also take into consideration. Like it's all about building relationships.
00:17:34.069 - 00:17:46.873, Speaker B: Not it's not just about the trade off in terms of money. It's also about the relationship. Because this will allow you then to ask for a bit more the trade off itself. It will appear more positive. So yeah, that's, that's that just what, what I wanted to.
00:17:46.969 - 00:19:05.887, Speaker D: I think one key thing to remember is that on X primarily every day or every week, you see DeFi protocol, XYZ drained of $10 million, insider got hacked. Or this happened. Or this happened. I think a key thing in the Defi space is that by default a lot of people are very skeptical. And I think what it comes down to is that Defi is very creative with coming up with new ways for Yield and everybody are promising like, okay, so this is so good because of xyz. I think a very important part in Defi marketing is building, of course building trust, but also explaining more where Yield is coming from as well as explaining the, well, security audits and highlighting these features. Because the underlying tone when I learn about the new Defi project is why are these guys not going to run away with the money or can they do it? Or do they have a multisig? Because there's a very big underlying tone of fear overall.
00:19:05.887 - 00:20:12.587, Speaker D: So I think that the key part is there. And that also comes back to co marketing. Because when you know that the Defi protocol is interacting with a lot of other founders, let's say we're doing shared Digify roundtables as well as you collaborate with leading security audit firms, that means that how a lot of people view it is that they are more likely to have like private keys and so on under control. Because there is like it's every week you can read about the new Defi protocol that got drained, hacked and so on. So I think that that's a very important part. So when we often do Defi marketing, we also want to do like investor roundtables and similar spaces where we outline like here is what we have done to ensure and protect our ecosystem. So I think that's another important key pillar in on social media to be able to communicate that very clearly 100%.
00:20:12.701 - 00:21:29.585, Speaker A: Like Tim, thank you for joining and also spreading awareness on that side, I believe like we already jumped into a little bit of the content creation side and for me there's two ways that you need to do it. One is like dumb down everything. So as Diogo and Verdu quickly mentioned, there's a lot of not so easy to understand topics and if you want to bring the mass adoption as we all want and we want the user to onboard our product, then we need to make sure that it's easy for him to understand. But at the same time, as you just quickly and rightfully mentioned, there's a lot of hacks, there's a lot of lack of knowledge and we also need to provide the deep down educational content that will allow them to understand better what is actually happening besides and on the back end of the protocol and actually be aware of how to be safe in the space. Sara, you didn't have the chance to speak regarding the previous question. I'm really keen to know more about your take on this part of the content creation. Are you more towards the educational side? Are you more towards the dumb downside, a balance between both?
00:21:31.845 - 00:22:19.467, Speaker E: Yeah, actually I totally agree with what the other speakers were just mentioning, but I think teams touch on a very important point that is the fact that, and I totally agree what you just mentioned, I really believe education is a big pillar of all of this. Right. Especially because as you mentioned in the beginning of the space, I'm not exactly involved in a defi project. I mean I started NFTS as you shared with the audience. Now I'm involved in a Deep Ink project that of course as the name stays a little bit complex and difficult to understand. So when it comes to education and making sure that we translate things like in a simple language for people to actually understand the potential and the opportunities that this represents. Right.
00:22:19.467 - 00:23:23.327, Speaker E: So me leading a marketing department right now in a deep in project and managing the entire social media planning strategy and all of that, what we really try to do is make sure that we are very easy to understand because it's, it's a complex thing, right? It's cloud. We're going to release our notes. So there's a lot of different learnings that we need to share with the community and for that reason we always try, you know, to have this open dialogue also learn from them. What they really want to understand more on what we are doing and most importantly, be transparent at all times. Right. So yeah, so I completely agree with all of the other speakers and it's a matter of. Also to be fair, I'm a teacher about Web three marketing and one of the questions that my students raise a lot is what is the difference between Web2 and Web3 marketing? And there's a lot of different things that we need to take into consideration for sure.
00:23:23.327 - 00:24:02.765, Speaker E: But ultimately the principles are there, right? I mean what we want is to educate, is to convert, is to achieve brand awareness, build a community. Of course Web 2.0 is going to be around customers, right? And clientele and all of that. And Web three we're all about community, co creation, open dialogue, open growth and evolution. So of course there are some slightly different things that we need to embrace and take into consideration. But in the end it's all about drafting a strategy, making sure that we hear what our audience wants and making sure that our product is going to fit that needs and the desires. Right.
00:24:02.765 - 00:24:27.787, Speaker E: So happy to hear what other hosts have to say about this if they think it's completely different from the web 2 world to the web 3. Of course, different platforms, different way of speaking, different way of interacting with each other. Super informal, but this is also something that I'm always super curious about. So I don't know if I can bring this topic to the table if I'm allowed. But since you mentioned that it's an informal conversation, I will be curious to.
00:24:27.811 - 00:24:49.283, Speaker A: Know it's an open discussion. Everyone is welcome to do your own questions, bring a new topic. I actually want to. I will do a test here. Already gave you access back. Pedro, I thought that you dropped down. There's actually a great person here also to speak about Marting, which is Christina.
00:24:49.283 - 00:25:10.377, Speaker A: I don't know guys, if you are familiar with cookie free, but he's basically a very cool analytics tool for Martin. Not sure if she's listening, but if she is, Christina, I will actually invite you to join the stage also if you want. If not, I just gave you a free shout out. So I hope you enjoyed this space. But yeah, guys.
00:25:10.521 - 00:25:11.033, Speaker B: Miguel.
00:25:11.089 - 00:25:11.977, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead, Miguel.
00:25:12.041 - 00:25:43.461, Speaker B: You also have a deal here, Oxynequil, which has been, you know, in charge of several LST related protocols on the marketing side. And you know, that's. It's one of the persons that I've been in touch for the longest when it comes to marketing, you know, like so if you want and if he's down to speak about Morting and if you allow it for sure would be awesome. Also a good speaker for sure for.
00:25:43.493 - 00:26:04.425, Speaker A: Me guys, I actually already have also another request here from bbyb. Happy to have you here. Let me already add you as a speaker but let's try to keep this. Okay, so we already have two new speakers in guys. Thank you for joining and for accepting the request. Hi Christina, how are you doing?
00:26:05.245 - 00:26:13.365, Speaker F: Hi, I'm good, thank you. My connection is good. I'll be like next to Wi Fi in about 30 seconds so you should hear me better.
00:26:13.825 - 00:26:17.805, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you for joining bbuyb. How are you doing mate?
00:26:19.105 - 00:26:22.641, Speaker G: I'm doing swimmingly, thank you very much. Brother, how are you doing this morning?
00:26:22.833 - 00:26:38.975, Speaker A: Perfect, thank you for joining. Excited to also hear your takes on this. Without further ado, let's then come back to the topic. Sarah actually just did a great question Sarah, if you want to just simplify it again I'm a little bit lost because I had two.
00:26:39.515 - 00:27:13.385, Speaker E: Yeah, that's, that's a good way to say that you weren't listening. That's fantastic. No, yeah. So my question was actually if you guys being professionals and experts in Web3 marketing for a couple of years now, of course, if you guys think that the gap or the difference between Web3 marketing and Web3 marketing, if it's completely different, right? Because I honestly believe the fundamentals and the basics are the same, of course, different tools, different audience. So different things in like a lot of different things that we need to adapt. But ultimately it's, it's, it's the same.
00:27:13.465 - 00:27:13.705, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:13.745 - 00:27:18.245, Speaker E: I mean that's my take. But more than happy to hear from other experts what you think.
00:27:22.545 - 00:27:37.611, Speaker F: Well I just jumped on so maybe I can give a perspective from analytics point of view because what I find super interesting and I might be a bit biased because cookie 3 is an analytics tool is the difference in access to data.
00:27:37.683 - 00:27:43.859, Speaker E: Because Obviously you know Web3 and Blockchain, they're totally transparent and normally you can't.
00:27:43.907 - 00:27:52.571, Speaker F: See what other people are doing with your competitors if they're engaging with their products, if they're buying their products. And in Web three because everything's happening.
00:27:52.603 - 00:27:55.563, Speaker E: On chain, you can actually peek into.
00:27:55.619 - 00:28:07.475, Speaker F: Your audiences and your users transactions. You can see what other projects and smart contracts they are interacting with. And if you see, let's say 40% of your users are interacting with another.
00:28:07.555 - 00:28:10.163, Speaker E: Project or holding their NFTs, it's a.
00:28:10.179 - 00:28:18.395, Speaker F: Great indication to do a partnership with them. It's something, it's an insight that you don't have in web two and in Web three you can really leverage the.
00:28:18.435 - 00:28:22.855, Speaker E: Data transparency, which I feel is a big difference between Web two and Web three marketing.
00:28:23.885 - 00:29:02.889, Speaker C: Yeah, just to add on to that, I totally agree with you, Christina. And by the way, I'm a user of cookie3. I do really like her platform. But I still think although Web3 is transparent and you can see a lot of the data, there's still a lot of troubles when it comes to indexing data and getting the exact date. Mainly when you're talking about defi and liquidity pools and boosts and points and then the users end up looping their assets tons and tons and tons of times. So there's still a long way to go when it comes to having the full information that you want in a transparent manner. But yeah, I agree with you, there's a few differences between web 2 and web 3.
00:29:02.889 - 00:29:15.685, Speaker C: I also think the audience is super different and the attention span of a web3 user might be even smaller than the web2 guy. But yeah, and shout out to cookie3. Great platform that you guys have.
00:29:20.555 - 00:29:21.695, Speaker F: Thank you so much.
00:29:25.595 - 00:30:01.077, Speaker B: Emily. Emily, I just also sent you an invitation. I've been a huge fan of your content, especially you know, like anything Martin related. So if you want to come up, feel free. And yeah, I just wanted to, before we jump into back into the topic, also wanted to kind of welcome Adelia here. So feel free to also share your thoughts, I think. And before I, you know, like regarding the differences between Web2 and Web3, I think Web3, you know, kind of uses informational aspects of Web3 marketing.
00:30:01.077 - 00:32:27.925, Speaker B: Of course, like every, every other, every other vertical strategy. I do think, you know, Peter said it very well the James spun off of and the easiness of pretty much explaining certain concepts when you generally and this is not only towards Web3 but generally in terms of due to the financial literacy at this point it's often quite difficult to overall mention or explain financial products and I think that doesn't help. I think and this could also apply to, to thread fi, but I've been actually speaking about this with quite a few friends. But like when you have an industry that is so moved based on returns, this is why we often speak that you know, users are mostly concerned and the content usually works, you know, the best is usually on rewards, it's usually on points, incentivization, all of these sorts of campaigns that in my opinion are those who are able to convert the most and hence, you know, it's fairly difficult to predict any kind of parent in terms of users Right. Because we're also fighting against or between ourselves to pretty much attract new TVL through all of these rewards and incentives. So even on the marketing side fighting with these motivations, it's complicated because it's so kind of inside ourselves, the motivation towards higher returns, it's when you compare it to tech or any other hyper fragmented industry where there's little to no differentiator between products or there's no high incentivization, especially financial incentivization towards changing products, it becomes, you know, a bit easier to do marketing in terms of the loyalization, I believe. But when we're talking about less permitted market with, you know, all of a sudden you got like a ton of incentives on a new protocol, you know, especially, you know, new liquidity pools, combination of, you know, points and in boost, you know, it makes it a bit harder for us marketeers to adapt to this, to these kind of cycles where there's no new people coming in, new particles coming in with these new incentives.
00:32:27.925 - 00:32:35.829, Speaker B: Yeah, but yeah, we'll had other speakers speaking on stage duly if you want to drop some alpha as well.
00:32:35.957 - 00:32:55.709, Speaker H: Yeah, yeah. Hi everyone. Thanks for bringing me on the space. I just thought this space was cool so I started listening. But yeah, really happy to also come here and chat. So yeah, I heard Diogo talk about a few topics like incentives, you know, and how it's like the market in a very fragmented industry. It's quite interesting.
00:32:55.709 - 00:33:32.371, Speaker H: I think I'm so used to thinking about how I can incentivize users to do things that I forgotten how different it is in web 3 to web 2. Like in web 2 I was downloading this new food review app and I was asking my friend what's the incentive they're giving me to add a review. Then he's like, nothing. Why do you even need an incentive? And that's when I realized my brain was broken from web3. But back to marketing. I totally also think that web3 marketing is somehow very. Also quite technical.
00:33:32.371 - 00:34:16.279, Speaker H: Right. In comparison to other sectors. Like even if you see like apps, consumer apps, their marketing campaigns are more visual than text. Whereas we somehow still try to cram in as much of product messaging as possible in our campaigns and focus less on storytelling. I think that's something that I personally hope to incorporate more like more storytelling, less technical information in my campaigns. Because I think that's actually how marketing should evolve eventually. Because I think it's also partly due to the fact that we are using Twitter to distribute content knowledge and gain mind share community members.
00:34:16.279 - 00:34:51.145, Speaker H: But realistically you see dating apps or social media platforms or even investment robo investment products. A lot of the marketing is more visual, more story, less technical, less features. They don't really talk about their algorithm, they don't really talk about the incentives, their fees, but somehow we like to cram all of that in. So I think, you know, personally I would like to see, you know, Defi marketing, you know, go towards a more like storytelling kind of high level narratives than just trying to cram in as much detail as possible.
00:34:53.014 - 00:35:07.158, Speaker A: Thank you very much guys. I just want to do a quick shout out and welcome the new speakers. Adilia, thank you for joining. Emily, thank you for joining. I'm also a fan of your work and I've been following you. Hi. Personally myself really happy to have you here with us.
00:35:07.158 - 00:35:42.291, Speaker A: Guys. I'm sorry for this but like I didn't want to go a lot outside of the of the script that we had like we focused today is Defi marketing. I'm happy to have you all here but I have 30 more minutes for the space so if you don't mind, let's come back to the script. Okay. And at least for the topic. So we already talked about social media management, we already talked about content and I believe like what makes and builds a protocol in Web3 and in DeFi is their community. Okay.
00:35:42.291 - 00:36:21.039, Speaker A: For me, like this is the biggest thing that protocol can have is their community. Because if you have a community, you have everything. And even if you don't have a valuable product, if you have a community, you have value. Because what's the sense of meme coins without the community? Right? So with this said, like, obviously community building is crucial in Defi and in web free marketing in general. And obviously we tend to have our users staying loyal to the projects that we are building. What is like some of the most effective strategies that you have been using to build your community. And I know that we have a lot of people with a big experience here.
00:36:21.039 - 00:36:36.315, Speaker A: I visited all of your discords and I quickly see which ones have the biggest and the most active community and I quickly see which ones are dead. So bbyb man, go ahead. You have joined us, you have the hand raised. Go ahead sir.
00:36:36.775 - 00:37:04.945, Speaker G: Thank you very much. Just a very quick introduction. I won't dally too much. I'm coming into this with no web3 defi background. I've done web2 marketing for a whole host of companies and in the Last sort of 10ish months since I've been quote unquote retired, I've done A lot of like meme coin, project marketing, community management, community building. One thing that has always stuck out is you need to have law, you need to have a center point. So for a lot of memes that might be sort of.
00:37:04.945 - 00:37:37.957, Speaker G: This can be applied to defi, of course. But you saw maybe with classic examples would be sort of like McDonald's back in the day, how they had the clown and they built a whole sort of marketing platform on a platform structure around the clown. Can't remember his name. You can apply the same two web2 techniques into web3. DeFi projects arguably don't need a mascot. But if you built the law and you built someone that the community idolizes, you can then push going forward with that. Jupiter did it quite well with when.
00:37:37.957 - 00:38:15.755, Speaker G: When they release their cap sort of meme coin and they're actually bringing that back and still running with it. It doesn't always. So it doesn't resonate with everybody all the time. But depending how you push one centerpiece in your marketing plan, whether that's a singular person who's an actual person or a meme or a character, having someone that you can build lore around then congregates the community specifically around that, you can grow using that as well. From what I've seen at least in the last 10 months, specifically working in Web3 and specifically working with only meme projects. So yeah.
00:38:19.895 - 00:38:24.463, Speaker C: We always end up talking about memes in all of these spaces. Thanks man.
00:38:24.639 - 00:38:25.915, Speaker G: I'm so sorry.
00:38:28.855 - 00:39:13.665, Speaker C: I just wanted to give my 2 cents where a lot of people in the panel so I'll let everyone speak. I think also transparency is really important when it comes to building a community. I think generally we should host a bunch of campaigns and community calls where we go through the product, through the updates and kind of know the users or let the users know what's happening on the background because developers are always evving and there's a lot of stuff happening on the background. So I think that's really important. And then just keeping the guys incentivized, but not only with cash prizes. You need to make them really feel like they're part of a community or something bigger kind of value. These ensure they know your value prop in the in the end of the day.
00:39:13.665 - 00:39:25.965, Speaker C: And I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Gonzalo. I think he's here on the audience as well for his amazing work that he's done over the past few months on that as well. And I'll pass the words to the next one.
00:39:28.035 - 00:40:13.843, Speaker B: I think one thing that is fairly crazy. Just like dropping a few ideas and especially this is something that on the luxury industry I used to do with collectors and I used to work with Ion Watch, especially Rolex and Patek. Something that we've used to do is a lot of attention towards meeting and giving time to develop personal and in the real world relationships. And when it comes to community is something that Renzo one thing that we communicate a lot is look, if you can pretty much be aware of where the team is located, if you want to grab a coffee lunch wherever we are, let us know. Discord Twitter. Lunch is on us. Coffee is on us.
00:40:13.843 - 00:41:23.189, Speaker B: If we're attending a specific event like Nevcorn right now, we're going to have a lot of our team members there. And this is something that we I'm personally pushing because it's where you get the chance to actually develop these personal relationships with which much likely will last for years and they become brand champions. And I do this like, you know, like that's, you know, the team does daily breakfast where we allow everyone to come to the breakfast. It's on us. If there's any events on which like our community wants to attend but they're not being approved, I'll personally look after them and make sure they're the max number of them are approved. And it's something that you know, might look small but consistently and once again I think on marketing specifically consistency is very important and I'm really trying not to kind of speak a lot here but like the overall the summary is that, you know, like taking a chance to develop this personal relationship I think is very important. We get too used to telegrams and Twitters that we sometimes forget how powerful meeting with people, especially on the community side is.
00:41:23.189 - 00:41:33.055, Speaker B: And like word of mouth and kind of the compound effect on word of mouth is quite meaningful even if at the time might look small. But that's pretty much it.
00:41:41.875 - 00:42:12.065, Speaker H: Yeah. So everyone made great points and I think they are all super valid. I just want to add on one more point on like just basically showing up, right? I think showing up is half the battle on. And what do I mean by that is that don't rely on passive like communications or like too many bots to deliver all the information. You know, let people know who the team are on Twitter. Right. This also segues into like team led marketing and community building.
00:42:12.065 - 00:43:14.409, Speaker H: Be there, you know, be reply right when someone brings up a problem, reply when someone compliments the product. You know, just show up right when the community, you know, gives feedback on Discord, Telegram or Twitter. Because just by showing up and letting them know that they are heard really, you know, makes them feel a lot more like a community and really helps them to feel more encouraged and empowered to evangelize your product or protocol on social media. So I feel that, you know, there are projects who kind of really want to stay away from Telegram. They don't even want like the account as an admin on Discord or Telegram because they just want to be as distant as possible. You know, I'm not saying, you know, to abandon like property, like, sorry, I'm not saying to abandon proper community, user flow kind of onboarding and ticketing. I'm not saying like abandon that, just let the users go wild.
00:43:14.409 - 00:43:24.221, Speaker H: But I'm also saying that, you know, just be present, you know, be active. Don't only show up when there's like a major fire to put out. And I think that goes a long way.
00:43:24.293 - 00:44:02.617, Speaker B: Yeah, like, don't know about you guys, but one of the most bullish factors in my opinion when I'm looking at any defi protocols is where when I go to their discords and I see the founder typing there. Because, like, we sometimes think that in our, like the founders and the C level team is usually very busy, but usually the best founders that I know and the best C level team that I know is usually the ones that will reply to you the quickest and are always there to answer, always there to support. And for me that's like, of course there's people with busy lives. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a busy life, but for me, usually it's a very positive factor.
00:44:02.761 - 00:44:30.485, Speaker A: Seeing the founders on Discord 100%, sir, what's the best way to get something to be arranged or changed on the protocol than speaking directly with the founder? This is also like something that I'm always trying to push to the founders that man, like be there, be in the community, say good morning, interact with them, even if it's just for 10 minutes per day. That already makes the difference. Gonzalo, my man, co host, you had some problems during the space come up, sir.
00:44:31.585 - 00:44:33.817, Speaker I: Can you guys hear me perfectly?
00:44:33.921 - 00:44:34.601, Speaker A: Welcome back.
00:44:34.673 - 00:45:35.355, Speaker I: Yeah, thanks. So, yeah, I think what I wanted to also add is we got a lot of great ideas regarding Web3 marketing. I think the main thing is building trust. And I think besides the memes and the culture and the meme culture, I think it kind of goes to the mindshare and the attention span that we're always fighting for that because there's so much noise in web3 or the blockchain space. I think in the end what the user wants is like they want this one on one communication because it's kind of different. I think also Dio was talking about this regarding the difference between web 2 and web 3. Since this is mainly digital and mainly we have everyone from so many different parts around the world, the digital aspect is something that you have to work out.
00:45:35.355 - 00:47:05.623, Speaker I: So I think one of the things that we have been seeing everyone, you could say in top positions in Web3 marketing are pushing those narratives regarding, hey, everyone in the team that is part of a project or protocol should be on social, should develop their personal brands. Also the founders, they should be engaging. I think that is one of the most important strategies that have come up recently in the space and it's really working. And I think if I go to a protocol or project, despite any socials, if I see the founders or even any person of the team engaging, like I'm gonna be, hey, this, this project is like going places. It's gonna give me a good first impression. And I think also as a question for everyone is besides this, besides the team and the founders engaging still in the end we are going to get some community burnout because I think where is it? Adelia? I think it was saying that regarding we have to balance the technical aspect between the memes and also the type of content of how we communicate and things. So yeah, I think in the end it's kind of hard to balance that because we don't want to create too many burnout.
00:47:05.623 - 00:47:34.975, Speaker I: Regarding if we go too technical and maybe, I don't know, sometimes we have the directive from the company of the project that still we can do some memes but you have to balance because we don't want to look too professional. So I don't know, this is something really important and I would like to know how most of you guys balance or how do you guys work around this? This is something like internally we always are fighting regarding this.
00:47:37.515 - 00:48:38.565, Speaker G: Would I just be able to add to what both you guys have just said? Because again, I'm coming from a bit of an outsider's perspective. So there's sort of a question within this as well. How much do defi platforms build a personality on their main Twitter? And I'm not just talking about things saying like, you know, good morning this, that and the other. And obviously it's important the founders have a personal brand, but it builds a lot more trust to have an actual quote unquote intern. I mean that's quite a loose term that gets thrown around. We saw it done really well with Poly Markets. I don't know how familiar you guys are with their sort of strategy where their intern, who I can't remember the name of, but he has a whole personal brand of Twitter and he bought that to polymarkets using words that historically a company like Polymarket wouldn't use, but because they bought the branding and they actually sort of ignited a whole personality for their company, aside from graphics and everything else, they did it, you know, through tweets that then built a whole community around Polymarkets as if they were interacting with the brand themselves.
00:48:38.565 - 00:48:51.335, Speaker G: So I guess, yeah, it's kind of a question, kind of an input. But how common is it for Defi projects to have a social media marketing strategy where they actually build a brand personality rather than just pure branding?
00:48:51.835 - 00:48:53.339, Speaker C: That's. That's a great take.
00:48:53.427 - 00:48:53.723, Speaker B: I.
00:48:53.779 - 00:48:54.815, Speaker C: Go ahead, Go ahead.
00:48:55.115 - 00:49:20.253, Speaker F: Sorry, I wanted to jump in also. I'm sorry, I just joined, but I wasn't even meant to be here. I want to actually comment on this because it's something that I also wanted to mention. I'm coming in as my intern account and a few tips that at least for us, has worked. Like, bear in mind, we haven't launched anything. Like, we don't have a product, we have a points program deployed. So it's a lot of like, community, community building at this stage.
00:49:20.253 - 00:49:46.223, Speaker F: I think intern is like super interesting. Like, we have gained a lot of attraction from it. Like, not just posting memes, but like doing calculation things that we can't do on a main account. We do through our intern. Also, like, connecting with KOLs is so much easier because we don't have to be as formal or anything with them. It's just like they feel like they're actually talking to someone. And I think building connections with KOLs is also very important.
00:49:46.223 - 00:50:15.833, Speaker F: Like, a lot of times with KOLs, we always think it's like a transactional thing, like they do when post and then we have to pay them. But I think building on relationships is super important. Also, backing on what you said in terms of Intern account, like, it has really helped us. But I do see a shift now in the market. Like, I see a lot of accounts like protocols now. Like, their teams are kind of like their mini KOLs. Like, you see this with Athena from like, for example, Seraphine or Pendle team.
00:50:15.833 - 00:51:02.347, Speaker F: Like, they're super advocates of their own project and they all post about it, like in all their different languages and stuff. And they really represent the company. So I think interns is a great way to like obviously if you also want to be an on or I don't know if you want more creative freedom. But I think also betting on like team talking about it and building each personality, I think it's super interesting. And then one last thing I would say for growth is I think a lot of times we overthink about like posting, posting, posting, like and I used to think, okay, I need to have like X amount of posts a day. And now I've actually said, you know what, like if there's something interesting to post or that we have to like an announcement, something that's important, fair enough. If not, like I want my team to be commenting on everything that's on Twitter.
00:51:02.347 - 00:51:09.789, Speaker F: So we're just like reply guy all the time. And in terms of reach, this has helped us massively. So yeah, that's my take.
00:51:09.957 - 00:51:37.421, Speaker C: Great, great take. And shout out to loop and to loop intern. Totally agree. I think intern accounts are super important. I think Monad has one really good pendle as an amazing one as well. And because of legislation as well, we can't really talk about yields and all of this kind of stuff in the, in the main accounts of protocols. So it's helpful that we have these smaller accounts where we can kind of build these defi strategies about the protocols that we're connected with.
00:51:37.421 - 00:52:01.815, Speaker C: So yeah, definitely a thing to eye there. And also a big believer that relationships shouldn't be transactional. Being with Kols or any other partner, it needs to be both ways. These four KOLs for co marketing for everything. And if it's transactional, usually it won't last for long as well. I had a few other things to say but I forgot so I'll pass the mic to.
00:52:03.875 - 00:52:55.497, Speaker B: Like on to what, like what you're speaking. Regarding transactional, I think, you know, I'm just gonna drop a few bullet points, just not go too long on this. Regarding interns, definitely, you know, Vaneck itself kind of intern style communication panel intern, solo intern in terms of the like kind of company employees being their own brand advocates and brand champions. Definitely look at Omni with Graham and Matt. I think they've done a good job of course surfing as well. I think overall, you know, transactional, like 4QLs or any kind of research based code writers and it's, it's something that you can do and develop the relationship is, you know, weekly, weekly calls with them, like ask for feedback, have a chat with them, ask how you can provide them with data. Not really concerned about your protocol, but about overall.
00:52:55.497 - 00:53:35.125, Speaker B: Overall, the sector in which you're working on, I think there's. It's about, once again, not being transactional, like the Loop intern just said. It's about, you know, like, sometimes in life you have to give first before you receive. And I think having this kind of approach works very well when it comes to, in my opinion, building these individual brands on Twitter. From the protocols employees, I think it's very easy to. To go through specific weekly calls with them to at least make them understand how important it is to be the reply guy. Once again, how easy it is to jump on spaces as well, give them some guidelines on content creation.
00:53:35.125 - 00:53:52.485, Speaker B: But overall, I do also agree that being the reply guy and something that a lot of people have been speaking about recently in crypto, Twitter, which is one of the biggest boosters in engagement. Raise the hands here, we'll shut up.
00:53:54.075 - 00:53:57.059, Speaker F: All right. I just wanted to add on. Oh, go ahead, Tim.
00:53:57.227 - 00:54:01.939, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I. I just wanted to add, like, another little perspective here on the.
00:54:01.987 - 00:54:04.615, Speaker C: Take the mic, guys. Take the mic or I'll take it.
00:54:04.995 - 00:54:06.455, Speaker D: Can you hear me or no?
00:54:09.395 - 00:54:10.051, Speaker B: Yeah, I can.
00:54:10.083 - 00:54:15.979, Speaker A: We can. We can hear you for that problem with. On this. On his side. I will send him a message.
00:54:16.107 - 00:54:16.815, Speaker D: Okay.
00:54:17.955 - 00:54:19.811, Speaker B: Exit the space and come. Come back again.
00:54:19.923 - 00:54:34.715, Speaker D: I think the perspective I wanted, that is, like, when it comes to building a def. It also really depends if you're building within Solana or Ethereum that are like the main ecosystems where you have a lot.
00:54:51.425 - 00:54:54.897, Speaker B: Not sure if we're hearing Tim, but I'm not.
00:54:55.041 - 00:54:57.921, Speaker A: Okay. I thought Twitter was just wrecking, ragging.
00:54:57.953 - 00:55:02.725, Speaker C: Me, but also here I'm not sure what's happening.
00:55:03.505 - 00:55:04.609, Speaker B: It's rugging us all.
00:55:04.657 - 00:55:06.525, Speaker A: Okay, Tim, can you hear us?
00:55:07.385 - 00:55:08.681, Speaker D: I can. I can hear you.
00:55:08.713 - 00:55:14.329, Speaker A: Yeah, because, like, you get it off from. For a moment, we thought Twitter was rigging us.
00:55:14.417 - 00:56:08.525, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it got automatically muted. No, but what I wanted to. So if you're building Defi, a defi community on Solana or on Ethereum, it's very different than if you go into more niche ecosystems, because on Solana or ethereum, there's like 10 different competitors within each niche of Defi. While as soon as you go into a more niche ecosystem, you can take like the top 15 coins. Most of them have 1, 2 or 3, which means that it's much more one main dex, one main lending protocol, one. And it's much easier to compete. And I think that's an important thing, too, because a lot of niche Defi projects that are within, let's say within Polkadot ICP or Multiverse Polygon.
00:56:08.525 - 00:57:14.955, Speaker D: You need to use different strategies because they often look at like, okay, so what are the top products doing on Solana or Ethereum? And then they're like trying to deploy that into a niche ecosystem. And that doesn't often work as good as it does within, let's say the mainstream ecosystems. So you have to be very strategic on how, how you build within your ecosystem and also partner up with the other projects that are building, especially with launches. DEFI projects can often do very well if they do co marketing with new projects within the ecosystem. And I think that's a key part to growing as well as there's a lot of cross chain platforms right now and a lot of them are also open to doing very strong cross ecosystem collaborations, which can be a very effective way to grow, to grow the ecosystem, especially when you're in a more niche ecosystem.
00:57:20.455 - 00:58:09.933, Speaker H: Hey, I think that's very interesting what you said, that it's not as simple. I think it begins with people trying to or projects trying to identify who they want to reach out to. I think because there's just cross circulation of the same people using the same apps. But if you really want to onboard more people, we have to identify what kind of users we need to reach out to. And it is marketing is literally a communication problem solving methodology. If we're not able to communicate something which is probably so complex in such simple words, then I don't think anyone's doing a good job. Then if we are not able to reach the new crowds, then again we're going around in the same cycle.
00:58:09.933 - 00:59:00.525, Speaker H: So anyone, any project which has already grown to a certain level, which has an established community, should look onto onboarding newer members rather than just catering to the existing community. Because if a community is already active and any active community will foster itself, that is the whole point of a community. They take care of each other, they take care of themselves, but the focus has to refocus to the newer users. So I think this is something that needs to be looked into and people really need to simplify the language that they're using to communicate what they're doing, what they're building, how it works, just as simple as possible.
00:59:02.705 - 00:59:08.321, Speaker F: Absolutely agree and love what you said and I would love to add one thing to it, is that community.
00:59:08.433 - 00:59:10.897, Speaker E: And it sort of jumps onto what.
00:59:10.921 - 00:59:17.365, Speaker F: Loop intern said when she was just speaking. It should start with your team. If your team is active and your.
00:59:17.405 - 00:59:21.989, Speaker E: Team is able to explain what you're doing and what you're building and is passionate about this.
00:59:22.117 - 00:59:35.317, Speaker F: You're going to onboard these new people into your community through Network Effects, an experiment we've been doing at Cookie 3 lately. I told my entire like marketing and business team, everyone get on Twitter, go.
00:59:35.341 - 00:59:38.197, Speaker E: Into the community and we're getting so.
00:59:38.221 - 01:00:07.805, Speaker F: Much great traction because of this. I was recently posting to my team shout outs with like screenshots from Kaito of smart followers and I see we're building much more quality community than when we were just trying to onboard people through, let's say quests, which in my opinion don't work, or ways that most web free marketers do this. So for community building and getting these new users, make sure your team is active and people who are at the core of what you're doing are there and the community is going to come.
01:00:07.845 - 01:00:09.873, Speaker E: Following them because they're going to believe.
01:00:09.929 - 01:00:46.333, Speaker F: Them and be inspired by them. I don't know if that there's anyone that wants to add, but I just wanted to add something really quick to this. I think a lot of times we think about like, oh, we need to go to like reach loads of people and like, like our target audience needs to be huge. And since day one with our product, by the way, I'm cold Valve. I just entered with Loop Intern. But yeah, to get more reach. But yeah, I think a lot of times people think like, oh, we need to, you know, target a huge mass of users.
01:00:46.333 - 01:01:28.819, Speaker F: And with us, at least with our product, like we're very focused on Pendle and a lot of people have said, oh, what if, what if this is like too niche. But I mean if you think about it like it's not about the number of users, it's about the quality of them. And this goes back with the speaker just said like questing isn't going to bring you the best type of users. One strategy that I actually wanted also to share. I've been testing this lately so I can't really give feedback if it's super good or not. But start working on debank, you can target really the users. You can find a lot of on chain data and literally you can target message them and test out different campaigns there.
01:01:28.819 - 01:01:35.535, Speaker F: So this is something that we're also exploring not just to focus on Twitter all the time, which everyone's trying to compete for attention for.
01:01:37.355 - 01:02:02.975, Speaker A: The bank is like a great platform. To be honest, I already used it and tried the direct messaging myself. Although there's that part that okay, you can target already the users that you want. My personal experience until now it has been that the opening rate is very, very, very low. Good part is that the costs of the sending the message basically returns if they don't open it. So it's always worth a try.
01:02:04.835 - 01:02:41.355, Speaker C: For the ones interested on the bank, I actually advise you guys to go to Silo Finance and check how they do it on the bank. Whenever a user drops out of a liquidity pool, for example, and they see they have X asset, I don't know, he has Ethereum or something, directly, they message him saying, hey, we saw that you went out of this pool. Do you want to see other alternatives within our protocol? And then you can do this, this and this. And they just send them a list of strategies, for example, that they can use that the user can use within their protocol. So yeah, their strategy is pretty, pretty solid. I've been testing it out as well over the last few days. But yeah.
01:02:45.455 - 01:02:55.333, Speaker A: Thank you. So basically what they are doing is this is the direct messaging or this is just on the, on the post side. Whether they are direct messaging, I'm not.
01:02:55.349 - 01:03:15.105, Speaker C: Sure if they automatize it some way or somehow. But once a user leaves the liquidity pool and he has assets in his wallet that he's not using, they forward them multiple options where he can use his assets in order or to get extra yield or APYs or just not to have the assets stopped on the wallet.
01:03:15.445 - 01:03:45.825, Speaker A: Well, guess I will need to message them to learn how they do it because that's. That's fucking crazy. That's awesome. To be honest, Emily, like you've joined the speakers, I've been following you, but you have been very, very quiet. I'm actually curious to hear your input on this. Have you been using the bank yourself or any other like web free social media? Because we have been focusing a lot in Twitter, Telegram and Discord. But now that we brought out debank, I actually want to know your input on this.
01:03:46.165 - 01:04:17.297, Speaker J: Hey everyone, thanks so much for having me. This has been really fun to just listen to. I think maybe where I can start is just zooming out a little bit. A lot of what I've been hearing are tactics. I am hearing some strategy sharing which is really cool. But for example, I heard a mixture of how do you build community? And maybe founders should be talking to users and maybe the founders should also be having a personal brand and also the team can also communicate and build community or add and contribute to a community. And then I also heard a little bit about intern accounts.
01:04:17.297 - 01:05:06.283, Speaker J: So I wanted to first just say it's really cool to hear all of these tactics being shared. And I think if anyone's listening, wondering how do I actually go to market with my protocol, my product, my ecosystem, my app? It always starts with who are you? Like what is your positioning, what is your message? Who are you targeting? And this is where it gets a little tricky because in crypto oftentimes there's multiple audiences. So a little bit earlier I heard, hey, we need to balance memes with technical content. And I often look at this as the left curve, right curve meme of you want to be able to put out 40 IQ content as well as 160 IQ content. And that also means that your community makeup is going to be very different. Right. Like I think Mega Eth does a really good example of they have a community purely just for builders.
01:05:06.283 - 01:06:02.297, Speaker J: And it's very clear that a lot of their call to actions are funneling to how do we acquire more builders? At the same time they also have some type of acquisition funnel or user journey for people that simply want to contribute, whether that is being an evangelist or repurposing their content. I think we really need to think about the fact that there's multiple different types of funnels and how are they all intertwined. Now, specifically to your question about DBank, this sounds like it's a wallet messaging service. We haven't personally tested it at hype back in 2021 we did a lot of on chain paid ads targeting when it was very early and new. I think that I heard a use case here where it sounds like there's a lifecycle retention tactic of when somebody drops out, you can retarget them. That sounds really interesting. Personally never explored it for a client, mainly because few things.
01:06:02.297 - 01:06:19.793, Speaker J: The scale of what I've seen is really low and it's high cost. I would rather. Or it is a cost which I would rather give back to the community. So that's one piece and then the second piece is when I was exploring wallet targeting. Mind you, this is a year ago. So also that's the thing about Web3 growth tools. I'll.
01:06:19.793 - 01:07:08.085, Speaker J: I'll touch on that in a bit. But about a year ago when I also started getting targeted, there was a lot of spam content. And I think that type of seeing so many messages come in or spam content, it didn't look like the best channel at the time. With that said, it's always important, I think to re explore products that are building in the space as well as new channels. I've been a bit vocal about, hey, I don't recommend using paid ads except if you're like a company where CAC and LTV can be a bit more measurable. That could be like a dex a game, maybe a product that is already post cashflow positive. But the thing is it's so important to retest things and have an open mind because so many growth tools are constantly building shout out to Cookie 3 team.
01:07:08.085 - 01:08:07.115, Speaker J: They now have like a KOL analysis tool and many other growth tools that we've used in the past or are still currently using. They're constantly either building new features, sometimes they even pivot. And what I expect to happen is we're not always going to be purely targeting this kind of infra circus on crypto Twitter and I do see a future where we will need to tap into markets outside of this. So I think thinking about how do you prepare your brand or company? If it makes sense of course because first of all defi is also nuanced. I think I heard someone related to Poly Market earlier and I wouldn't say Poly Market is a defi category so that just wanted to throw in that nuance there. But yeah, I think it really comes back to how do you instead of thinking about tactics like hey should we set up an intern account really zoom out and focus on the strategy and think about if an intern account makes sense and if it does, why.
01:08:09.775 - 01:08:24.495, Speaker A: Those are great inputs. Like I knew that asking you to come to the stage will have his value. Emily, thank you very much for the inputs. Really great. Gonzalo my man, I know that you have been also raising your hand for some time now. Go ahead sir.
01:08:29.155 - 01:08:31.171, Speaker I: You mean me or the other Gonzalo?
01:08:31.323 - 01:08:33.455, Speaker A: No, the other Gonzalez.
01:08:36.035 - 01:09:01.228, Speaker I: Yeah, it's okay. I think. Yeah. Something that well I guess Emily, Emily joined and just put a new perspective in everything we were talking about. So you have to like think macro now that it's. And I think this is something that the message that also been hearing lately from Emily I think it's. I think it's Claire also of the CMO of Aztec.
01:09:01.228 - 01:09:47.849, Speaker I: It's like who are you? I think that's, that's, that's what the main thing regarding marketing should. Should be at the corner and then you can start thinking about strategies. So I think that's really important. That's something that sometimes here in the industries we are always trying to get the most amount of attention users conversions but I think sometimes we kind of get deluded in the main things regarding market. So yeah but I don't know Miguel, I don't know if you will continue. I don't know if you have, you want to continue with this page. I think you have something else because I think we can go here like for one more hour.
01:09:47.849 - 01:09:50.325, Speaker I: But I don't, I don't know if you want to continue for more.
01:09:55.945 - 01:10:15.485, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead. I'm up for it. Like if the speakers are up for it, we have people entering and leaving. So for now I'm good. We still have some other topics that we can cover. I'm also very curious to go over the incentives management because loop is not here anymore. But they mentioned the points matter.
01:10:15.485 - 01:10:56.735, Speaker A: They have been following a lot on the points situation and obviously like once you are pre TD or you don't have a full product out, you have some sort of incentives that you can manage and send to the community. But after that runs out or the community is already saturated with the incentives that you are sending them, how do you actually fight the FUD or the people shorting or just selling your token or just stop using your platform? Because right now a lot of defi protocols sustain themselves on the basis of incentives. So I believe this is a great topic to talk about.
01:10:56.895 - 01:11:55.655, Speaker B: Mikael. I think, you know, I think taking it step by step, I think we also have to consider that upon two GE and the impact that this specific event has on token price and the. Well, pretty much all certain protocols have been dealing with the way they filter out specific wallets, the way they attribute points or you know, like they do the way they do the conversion towards tokens, you know, has been far from unhappy situation in most cases. And you know, I think there's a handful of protocols that managed to do this quite well. I mean, it's always difficult to please everyone. And you know, every single time you have one of these events, well, slash stages on the life of your protocol, it's important to have a good moderation team, pretty active on customer support, tickets and all that. It's usually very difficult to please everyone.
01:11:55.655 - 01:12:40.737, Speaker B: I think, and this is one of the reasons where I see a lot of users being also saturated by points, right. Why would I spend so much time and so much capital when then the conversion is not what I expected, of course, that this is kind of, kind of an individualistic assumption that each user does, taking consideration the capital they're, they're involving in the protocol. So you know, it's, it's, it's difficult to match what they were expecting as well. But you know, like when there's all these airdrops and all these GGs that usually don't rise to the expectations. That also kind of helps the whole points Matter to die out. Right. And it's.
01:12:40.737 - 01:13:31.947, Speaker B: And it also helps when a lot of these protocols have been doing these campaigns for a lot of time they've been delaying the ge. Sometimes it's needed to delay the specific events to make sure everything goes well. I'm not saying that that's wrong, but that's the impact that it has on the user base of these protocols. So overall I feel like users are. It is something we've been discussing for a while. Even when the points matter was quite active. It said, you know, users will in the end of the day always search for the real yields and you know, more at least incentives in the form of governance tokens, for example, instead of waiting for these events on which, you know, after six months or nine months, they'll get a non surprising amount of tokens.
01:13:31.947 - 01:14:18.497, Speaker B: So that's, that's what I wanted to say. I think there's multiple factors into it. I think, you know, it's also how you then manage it, manage your tokenomics, the amounts that are meant towards distribution, towards incentives or your seasons as well. I think you also need to consider, users need to also be aware to. I mean this is kind of like we can break it down, but still like, kind of like users will not be that interested, but they can do the calculations on the amount of TVL that a certain protocol has, the amount of, you know, incentives. They'll be providing the total amount of users and token holders that they have. So they can pretty much calculate how much dollars at a given time a certain amount of users will receive and kind of consider.
01:14:18.497 - 01:14:33.275, Speaker B: All right, let me compare to other protocols and they will see that they'll be able to identify specific protocols that are going to give them more value for their buck. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Not sure if anyone from the, from the speakers want to step in.
01:14:34.135 - 01:15:11.515, Speaker C: I think you really need to be transparent as a protocol and to ensure that the users know what they're getting into. And you need to put the user somehow first place. Because what we're seeing with all of these point systems, and we saw it, we saw the backlash with scroll like these last week. We saw buffer launching and having, I don't know, half a billion of withdrawals as well. So everyone wants to get out once the token is live. That's okay, that's fair. But the protocols themselves need to be fair and transparent and ensure that the users will continue post TGE being, as you said, yoga with Governance proposals, so on and so forth.
01:15:11.515 - 01:15:41.435, Speaker C: So you need to be really careful with the decisions you make there. And some protocols end up always farming users too much, I would say, and we need to shift that around as well, because if you farm a user for two years and then you don't compensate them accordingly, it's kind of normal that he ends up leaving or he's not so satisfied. So there needs really to be a good balance between incentives keeping the user happy, ensuring that he continues so on, so on and so forth.
01:15:42.535 - 01:16:02.589, Speaker B: Verdant. We all need to. It's going to be a joke, but it would be amazing if we could apply V model and bribing structures every single time you do a tge, right, Just to ensure that there's a higher motivation to keep the token specially locked so they increase the amount of voting power you have.
01:16:02.717 - 01:16:41.645, Speaker C: Actually, there's a few protocols that are already doing that, so they deploy this V token, but in the end of the day, the users don't want the V model or maybe they're not so focused on the governance part and they just want to cash out, which is also fair. So that's why there needs to be a balanced strategy from the protocol perspective. And I also think, like, protocol shouldn't sell their soul to the devil in order to give investors a sellout or a buyout. Once the token, the token is live, then dumping on the users that have been with them for the past two, three, four years. There's also a bit that's also a bit of what we're working in Turtle Club, but I'll leave that to another discussion.
01:16:44.355 - 01:17:25.845, Speaker H: I think that was a very interesting overview because if anyone's using a DEFI platform, they're literally in it for the money. There's only very few people who are who are in there because they believe in a particular project. So catering to all of these crowds is a very tough job. But I think we are at a stage where we have enough data to study what has worked and doesn't mean what strategy has worked it like what. What particular task or what particular format has worked. It's more about what has psychologically worked. Analyzing that is the key to actually cracking whatever you want to do next.
01:17:25.845 - 01:17:53.635, Speaker H: Just by building different strategies and just doing everything and anything, because 10 other projects are doing it is not going to work. There has to be some thought around why we are doing this and what outcome do we expect from this. And that only comes from studying your user behavior and the potential of that particular step that you're thinking Next.
01:17:55.615 - 01:17:55.903, Speaker C: At.
01:17:55.919 - 01:18:05.405, Speaker H: The end of the day, if you understand your users, you will be able to crack them. And all of that comes from studying how they're acting.
01:18:08.225 - 01:18:56.287, Speaker A: 100%. Like I now said that Christine already left because like there's some more platforms, but Cookie free allows us to do this very, very well, is to understand what type of community is interacting with our protocol, where they are based, which tokens they hold, even which NFT collections they are interacting like. And this is all like certain type of incentives that you can create normally pre TG the most, but it's all things that we can explore. Emily, we have been running here for a long time, so I will give you the last words and after that we will need to wrap this up. We already had a great space with great speakers, even more than the ones I was expecting. So shout out to all of you guys. Emily, go ahead.
01:18:56.431 - 01:19:00.875, Speaker J: I'm honored to have the last word. Should I leave everyone with an inspirational quote?
01:19:01.815 - 01:19:03.407, Speaker A: Please, please do, please do.
01:19:03.551 - 01:19:04.095, Speaker B: Okay, okay.
01:19:04.135 - 01:19:04.575, Speaker A: If you want.
01:19:04.615 - 01:19:33.569, Speaker J: Oh well, first I wanted to say, I just wanted to riff off. I'm so sorry if I mispronounce your name what Radhika was saying. I completely agree of you really need to understand your audience. I want to add some color to this. This is exactly why community is so important in crypto and in web 3. Like ultimately a lot of this tech is very early stage and it's pre product market fit and oftentimes even pre channel narrative fit. Which is exactly why like yes, all of these tools are amazing.
01:19:33.569 - 01:20:08.615, Speaker J: We use them as well to measure. But at the end of the day, like you as a founder, you as a team, you should be out here in the trenches talking to your users or potential audiences because you're not going to nail your user on the first try. So I think having that dialogue and conversation with people who are testing your product, using your product, validating your roadmap if it's not built yet, that's really the crux of building a community. And especially at this stage. I mean because of course like community isn't exclusive just to crypto. There's Web2Communities, okay? And my inspirational quote is, be yourself and be kind.
01:20:10.435 - 01:20:11.307, Speaker C: Let's go.
01:20:11.451 - 01:20:32.715, Speaker A: There you have it. There you have it, guys. Emily, thank you very much, guys, all the speakers, thank you very much for joining us today. Shout out to Diox, shout out to Verdant, shout out to Radica, shout out to bbyb. And to everyone that was here with us today, to the audience, thank you very much for joining us on the space. I hope you had the chance to learn something new. I hope you had fun.
01:20:32.715 - 01:21:01.827, Speaker A: We had an amazing space and this would not be possible without these amazing speakers. So quick, shout out to them, go follow them, leave them a like follow up on their content. We have amazing content creators here that are always sharing their own tips in terms of marketing and defi and whatever you guys are looking for. And with that said, thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the space. I hope you have a rest of a great Friday and an amazing weekend. And I'll see you guys next week for the next space.
01:21:01.827 - 01:21:06.135, Speaker A: Thank you very much. And I'll see you guys on the next space.
01:21:07.115 - 01:21:07.891, Speaker B: Have a good weekend.
01:21:07.923 - 01:21:08.855, Speaker I: Cheers everyone.
01:21:10.075 - 01:21:10.723, Speaker B: Cheers.
01:21:10.819 - 01:21:11.035, Speaker G: Enjoy.
