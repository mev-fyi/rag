00:00:00.840 - 00:00:16.321, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello everyone. How are you today? Welcome to Staking Circle Spaces Once again. We are back with our guests Stacking Dao. Before we do Kickstart, I do want to do a quick mic check. Leo, can I hear your voice man?
00:00:16.393 - 00:00:18.805, Speaker B: Hey, hey gm. Gm, can you hear me?
00:00:19.865 - 00:00:41.835, Speaker A: GM Jam loud and clear, mate. Thank you very much. I sorry about this but I always need to do quick my check. As three Peter has been ragging us a lot. So guys, it's our pleasure to having you here today for the first time. I think it's the first time you are here on these spaces and it's the first time we will talk about the product you're developing. I'm quite interested to be honest.
00:00:41.835 - 00:01:05.149, Speaker A: I researched a bit on you guys, have some questions, have some ideas of what you already do, but I would love to introduce you guys to the audience. I don't see that we have many people entering but it's usual drill, we start smoothly and then people will start getting in. So lior, can we get a quick intro from your end? So who are you? What's your role in the company and yeah, a quick intro from your side.
00:01:05.237 - 00:01:47.795, Speaker B: Sure, absolutely. First, I just want to start by thanking you for hosting the space and definitely very excited to be here to discuss Stacking Dao and all the fun things that we're working on. I can go pretty deep on my background in the space which is quite extensive but you know, not sure if we have all the time in the world to go there but just to give you the abridged version. So I recently joined Stacking Dao as the head of growth. Obviously we'll have plenty of time to discuss Stacking Dao and what makes us unique. But for me personally, I've been working professionally in the space since around 2017 or so. I started by launching a fund called Nova Block Capital.
00:01:47.795 - 00:02:43.235, Speaker B: So that was an early stage venture fund that was primarily investing in in tokenization projects, mostly on the equity side back then. And while at the time like a lot of our peers were flipping ICOs, we were more focused on actual businesses that were using blockchains as a financial tool and as rails for financial assets. So I was doing that for a couple years and from there I actually moved on to work at Fundstrat, which is a market research firm led by T. Tom Lee. You may know Tom Lee is kind of a big bitcoin bull in the space. Has been very bullish on Bitcoin since 2017, so was there for a little while just mostly working on as I mentioned market research and also consulting engagements with a variety of projects in the space at the time. Then I was actually tapped by a recruiter at Kraken to join their BD and partnerships team.
00:02:43.235 - 00:04:01.255, Speaker B: So I worked at Kraken for a couple years on just development and partnerships initiatives primarily relating to their NFT marketplace as well as their Web3 strategy. So it was interesting to be part of a larger centralized exchange and seeing the inner workings of the large centralized exchanges as well. So it was there for a couple years and I wanted to join more on the infrastructure side, especially with the smaller projects and smaller teams. So in 20 a year ago I joined DRPC, which is basically a distributed RPC network that's part of the P2P staking family, P2P itself being one of the larger institutional staking providers and drpc. There's actually quite a few parallels between what Stacking Dao is doing because they create a decentralized RPC node network. So really tackling some of the more centralized providers like Alchemy, Infura, Quick Node to offer more robust and resilient node infrastructure. And at Stacking Daos, I'm sure we'll get into, you know, we have a signer program where we've onboarded a permission pool of validators to offer just really high performance and help to contribute to the health and decentralization of the stacks blockchain.
00:04:01.255 - 00:04:20.055, Speaker B: Yeah, and so, you know, joining Stacking Dao, obviously this is why we're here in this space right now to discuss, happy to go in, exactly what we're offering, how we work, all the fun stuff we're working on. But yeah, that's my background and I'll leave it at that.
00:04:22.435 - 00:04:45.783, Speaker A: Nice, nice man. Quite an extensive background. I see we have an OG with us today. Thank you very much for that intro. Now diving into Stacking Dao, I'd like to start out. Let's start from a very high level level here and then progressively dive more into the protocol and your approach. Stacking Dao is building a liquid staking protocol on stacks.
00:04:45.783 - 00:05:04.159, Speaker A: Would you mind if we start with the general background on what liquid staking is for some of the new stakers we might have in the on your community and what are stacks about? Because I do think that these are two concepts like liquid staking, I do think that most people will understand, but stacks. Not so sure about it. So can you give us a quick intro here?
00:05:04.247 - 00:05:35.135, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So liquid staking, you know, I'm not sure what was actually the first project. I'm Assuming it was probably Lido, but it's basically the way where you can participate in consensus and earn consensus rewards for proof of stake networks. So obviously Ethereum being the largest while also maintaining liquidity. So you're issued a liquid staking token. In the case of lio, it's staked eth. In the case of stacking dao, it's STX or stacked stx.
00:05:35.135 - 00:06:33.335, Speaker B: And the principle is the same allows you to earn consensus rewards, which in Stacks case right now is around a 9% yield. So you can earn those rewards that's natively paid out in the stacks token while also maintaining liquidity and really exploring the full universe of defi applications that exist on stacks. So yeah, that's the high level overview about liquid staking. Obviously there's been like quite a few different approaches to liquid staking and different approaches in terms of, I guess, how you approach decentralization. So I know like Lido got a little bit of flack because you know, they've, they have a permission set of validators and they have a lot of concentration of eth. I believe it's about 30% of all staked ether or something like that. And you know, I know the community has been kind of banging the drama as to how that may lead to certain edge cases or risks.
00:06:33.335 - 00:07:17.969, Speaker B: But yeah, I mean, we've taken a pretty similar approach. As I mentioned earlier, we also have a permission pool of validators or signers and perhaps it'd be useful just to talk a bit about stacks and kind of what makes the Stacks blockchain itself unique. But yeah, just the overview there for Stacks. So Stacks is the leading Bitcoin L2. They launched their mainnet in January of 2021. So I mean, although there's been other attempts at creating protocols on Bitcoin to enhance the scalability and functionality of Bitcoin. You know, if you look, looking back in history, we had, you know, the Omni blockchain, which actually was the first Rails that Tether ran on and that was anchored on Bitcoin.
00:07:17.969 - 00:08:20.057, Speaker B: And it's funny how not many people actually know that. It's a fun bit of history there. With Tether, you obviously have the Lightning network, which has gotten a lot of interest and a lot of mind share, but has kind of been constrained in terms of the actual capacity or the amount of Bitcoin that is enabled on Lightning. And I think a big part of that as well is perhaps maybe because Lightning doesn't have an incentive mechanism in the case of its own token, whereas Stacks does So stacks, you know, pivoting to stacks here a little bit. As I mentioned, it's the leading Bitcoin L2, and what it did was it enabled or brought over smart contracts and programmability to Bitcoin. So if you could build Defi applications, you could build NFT projects, you can launch Meme coins, you can really do all the fun things that people on Ethereum or Solana or other ecosystems enjoy. So you can do all of that on Stacks while anchoring and really inheriting a lot of the security properties of Bitcoin.
00:08:20.057 - 00:08:32.445, Speaker B: So that's what makes Stacks unique. It's like basically enhancing the functionality of Bitcoin and just allowing for more programmability, expressivity and at the end of the day, just bringing more utility to Bitcoin.
00:08:33.465 - 00:08:58.951, Speaker A: And how do you guys start? Quick mention, let's go for this way. How do you guys basically build your layer on top of Bitcoin? Because we've received a lot of guests that are developing this space and I think like the end question that everyone ends up with is how are these L2s being built on top of Bitcoin with the limitations of Bitcoin smart contracts?
00:08:59.023 - 00:09:04.995, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's definitely an interesting technical question that I'm probably not the best person to ask.
00:09:05.975 - 00:09:06.815, Speaker A: Sorry, man.
00:09:06.935 - 00:09:49.849, Speaker B: But yeah, to my understanding, basically, Stacks transactions ultimately settled on Bitcoin and inherit a lot of the security and finality of Bitcoin. And there's going to be a big upgrade coming out. Hopefully it's going to launch in August of this year. So just another month and a half or so, which is the Nakamoto upgrade. And the stacks community has done a lot of work building towards that upgrade, but that will even basically shore up the connection between Stacks and Bitcoin even more and really inherit 100% of the finality of Bitcoin. While also another interesting thing about the Nakamoto upgrade is that alongside they're going to. We're going to.
00:09:49.849 - 00:10:07.285, Speaker B: The stacks community is going to be launching a tokenized version of Bitcoin called SBTC that will be kind of like the native Bitcoin asset that will be able to be deployed across Stacks applications. So, yeah, don't ask me to go too further in detail than that.
00:10:08.065 - 00:10:24.341, Speaker A: No, I think I already got a pretty good grasp. Just a small remark you were earlier stating or asking what was the first liquid sticking protocol. And we have it here today. It's Anchor. They are on the panel. Welcome, guys. Huge pleasure to have you guys here.
00:10:24.341 - 00:10:41.971, Speaker A: And they were the first to to release an lst, we think areth just a small remark and a shout out to our audience. Okay, can you. Not going back to the topic, can you elaborate on the stacking process with stacking down? So how does it happen? What does the user needs to do and so on?
00:10:42.043 - 00:11:28.107, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So it's super simple for a user. They just go to stackingdao.com they can connect their wallet and they just deposit STX tokens. And once they do that, they get the STSTX token, which is the liquid staking token. And as I kind of alluded to before, since we have this distributed network of signers or validators, we basically delegate that stacks to these signers and they're the ones that are actually running the nodes and accruing the rewards that we then pay out to all the holders of stx. Something I should also mention about the way that staking or stacking works on the stacks blockchain is it happens in two week cycles.
00:11:28.107 - 00:12:24.197, Speaker B: So you basically have to lock up your assets for a minimum of two weeks. And you can do it like obviously run as many cycles as you want, but that's kind of the minimum just to be stacking is you have a two week minimum. And typically if you're a solo validator, you're running a node yourself. You have to stack with 90,000 STX tokens, which is quite prohibitive as you can imagine for just individual users, because that amounts to close to $200,000 or whatever it is today based off of the stacks price. So with stacking dao, another benefit is that you can deposit any amount that you want. You can earn those stacking rewards, we automatically pay it out to the, to the holders in stacks tokens. And something I forgot to mention before as well, like the way that the stacking consensus mechanism works for stacks, it's something called proof of transfer.
00:12:24.197 - 00:12:58.255, Speaker B: And you actually, if you're stacking STX tokens, you're actually earning, not stacks rewards, but you're earning bitcoin rewards. So what we do is we convert those bitcoin rewards to stacks so that everything stays within stacks. So what we like to say is that if you're bullish on stacks and you want to express a long position or a bullish view on stacks, stacking DAO really is the best way to do that because based off of this mechanism, your return basically auto compounds your rewards. Auto compound in the STX native token.
00:13:00.235 - 00:13:11.403, Speaker A: And how, basically how is your yield generated? Because users do stake it to get a yield. How is your Yield generated. Is it from transactions on your network? How is it done?
00:13:11.539 - 00:13:19.305, Speaker B: Yeah, it's from transaction fees as well as the production of, you know, minting of, of new stacks tokens every block.
00:13:20.645 - 00:13:34.517, Speaker A: Okay, okay, okay. So I guess there's a clear, a clear road map there. Thank you for that, very much for that intro. Is there any plans for a token of stacking Dao?
00:13:34.701 - 00:14:52.893, Speaker B: Yeah, so what, I can't really talk about a particular token but, but what I will say is that we have a robust points program that's live and active right now and yeah, so you know, I guess maybe you can infer some things through that. There will be some sort of rewards at some point in the not too distant future. But yeah, we definitely have. Our community is very excited about the points program that we have in play right now and we also have relationships with other DEFI apps across the stacks ecosystem where you essentially will earn a points booster for participating. So you know the way that it works today with our points, for every STX token that you deposit on our platform, you earn one point per day. But if you engage with other defi apps and stacks, so like as one example, bitflow, which is one of the leading dexes in the ecosystem, if you're providing liquidity with the STSTX token on their pool, then you'll earn 150% points boost on the points you would otherwise receive. So we have a nice, like strong points booster for doing a few different things within with our partners in the ecosystem.
00:14:52.893 - 00:15:34.345, Speaker B: Another example of that as well is there's Zest Protocol which is a lending market kind of similar to AAVE or Compound, but it's a lending market that's native to stacks. And we similarly like if you, if you lend out your STX tokens, you receive a 50% points booster for stacking DAO. So you know, we're always looking for kind of interesting ways to incentivize our community and reward our community. And you know, we're in conversation with a lot of different builders and developers that are in this ecosystem. So if, yeah, I mean, if there's any other projects that, you know, anyone this audience or this community thinks that we should be talking to that could be interesting to collaborate with. Always happy to chat.
00:15:36.215 - 00:15:49.623, Speaker A: Nice. Like I was checking Nal defile and you have around 100 million TVL what are your plans to grow this TVL? So you are onboarding more protocols, more utility. How are you tackling these markets?
00:15:49.799 - 00:16:18.043, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean we have a few different strategies I think like right now where things stand. We're in a pretty privileged position. Our growth has been very strong. So we launched just in December of last year. So we're about six months into our journey. But we were able to amass 100 million TVL faster than any other liquid staking project that really ever existed. So that, that was a very like, important milestone for us that I think like shows to.
00:16:18.043 - 00:17:26.795, Speaker B: Speaks to the, the work and the growth that we've been, that we've been pursuing. And at the same time like we, we have a lot of interesting initiatives that I can't really talk about quite yet. Stay tuned. I think as I mentioned before, always looking for new partnership opportunities with other projects in the stacks ecosystem or perhaps even with other Bitcoin L2s. And through our points program we're always happy to incentivize certain activities across DeFi. And something else I want to mention as well, kind of contributing to our growth prior to the launch of Stacking Dao and really having a liquid staking token in this ecosystem, if you were an investor or a stacks holder, you had to choose between locking up your stacks tokens to earn the staking consensus rewards or participating in DeFi. So what I think was a really big unlock for this ecosystem was now that there's a liquid staking token with Stacking Dao, you don't have to choose between the two, you can do both.
00:17:26.795 - 00:18:12.155, Speaker B: And we saw how that supercharged growth within DEFI in Ethereum and Solana and other blockchains as well, but seemed to really be a big unlock for our community in stacks. And I think the numbers really point to that just as one example as well. Just want to throw in a figure like TVL across stacks was pretty stagnant before the launch of Stacking Dao. It was kind of range bound right around 30 million stacks total in TVL. And ever since we launched that number quadrupled. So now like the total TVL within stacks is 120 million stacks tokens. So, you know, I like to think that, I think Stacking DAO played a big role in kind of supercharging liquidity across the DEFI ecosystem on stacks.
00:18:13.455 - 00:18:48.947, Speaker A: No, that's. I think that's basically the role of lst. So we did see similar adoption. Like I do recall Ethereum back in the day. Day like one of the main complaints everyone was having when the first iteration of staking came out was that no one was staking. Then Lido showed up, the liquid staking tokens started to gain some traction. And it does Improve like the overall ecosystem, not only sustainability but like the capacity of things that users can do with the liquid staking tokens is just so much larger than just staking that.
00:18:48.947 - 00:19:42.267, Speaker A: Yeah, it's only natural that you saw and you were like the driver for the further growth of the ecosystem. Congrats on that guys. Like, I'll be honest, I've not been the most authentic or focused guys on Stack, but you do seem to be like the unlockers of the ecosystem. And congrats, it's always important to have such protocols whenever you're building on these ecosystems. So congrats. Going back to the staking, what risk mitigation features are you implementing to mitigate the risks associated with staking? So how large is your node operator network? Like we are so very used to speaking about Ethereum node operator network that we often overlook how these other chains work. How large is your node operating network and what are you doing to implement like to mitigate any risk of staking, like slashing and so on?
00:19:42.291 - 00:20:48.159, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I think just through our distributed signer program that is kind of the best, the biggest risk mitigation initiative that we've undertaken. And actually through that, by onboarding really large and robust and enterprise grade node operators, we're able to receive or generate high rewards on behalf of our users because they have the best performance, they have limited downtime, they're actually able to earn rewards in the best way for their users. Today we've onboarded seven of these larger node operators into our program. These are folks like, I'm sure you know some household names you've heard of like Block, Damon Chorus, one Kiln Restake and we're actually in conversation, pretty, you know, progressive conversation with about half a dozen others. So we'll be onboarding quite a few more into this program just to again like help to ensure the health and you know, further distribution of our network. So that's something that we always have a key eye towards.
00:20:48.159 - 00:21:15.065, Speaker B: Just we want to expand that network as much as possible. Right now, as I mentioned, it's a permission pool. So we're having conversations with the largest operators out there. We're delegating stacks to them and also like to go back to your question about kind of our growth strategy, we're also going to be leaning on them to tap into their communities to just generate more awareness about stacking DAO and get more STSTX through the door, hopefully.
00:21:17.525 - 00:21:46.863, Speaker A: That's nice, that's a nice roadmap and I do agree with you, I do know some of the names you mentioned regarding operators. And yeah, you are for sure going on the right direction. Best of luck on those endeavors because I do think that will be a major for you guys. So. Okay, we are coming to the end of this space. Thank you for coming. But before that, you already hinted of a possible token.
00:21:46.863 - 00:21:57.471, Speaker A: You did mention the point system. What are you cooking more besides this and what are your plans regarding the future developments ahead of us?
00:21:57.583 - 00:22:42.661, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So definitely a bunch of things. We have quite a few things on our roadmap that we're actively building towards. Unfortunately can't be super public about it quite yet, but what I can share is we actually want to be kind of like the analytics hub across the stacks ecosystem. So we're actively working on analytics dashboards and an analytics page to show more about the actual like stacking or validator process. You know, like who's involved, who are the largest validators, you know, how many, how much bitcoin rewards are they earning, what are the fees associated with that? So we want to kind of be the hub for all things stacking across the stacks ecosystem. And so just stay tuned for more exciting updates on that.
00:22:42.661 - 00:23:28.865, Speaker B: Just because we identified that data and analytics is kind of a big point that's not quite built out yet for stacks given kind of like, we're still pretty early here for the development of our ecosystem. So like, we're just very mindful of like some of the, the holes that we need to help fill. And something else as well I think will be very interesting to look at as well. Like clearly like restaking has been a, a big meta across this, this, this bull market. And I think especially after the Nakamoto upgrade is live, there'll be a lot of restaking opportunities, particularly with SBTC and bitcoin. So we haven't quite ironed out what that would look like, but I think there'll be a lot of interesting opportunities to participate with these restaking protocols that are building on bitcoin as well.
00:23:30.485 - 00:23:57.435, Speaker A: Nice, nice, nice man. Thank you very much. It was a pleasure hosting you here and I think you gave me, at least to me, a pretty insightful overview of the stacks ecosystem. I didn't have it and really appreciate it. I for sure will have to research more and we'll reach you out with the doubts and questions. Now to conclude the space, how can the users find more about stacks stacking, dao and everything about.
00:23:57.515 - 00:23:58.135, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:58.435 - 00:24:00.067, Speaker A: Which channel should be direct?
00:24:00.171 - 00:24:08.587, Speaker B: Sure. So, you know, please follow myself as the head of growth. My DMs are open so always happy to answer any questions or and you.
00:24:08.611 - 00:24:11.939, Speaker A: Have alpha and you have insight alpha to coming out on your page.
00:24:11.987 - 00:24:49.685, Speaker B: Actually you know you got to DM me to find out or follow me to find out. And yeah also please follow our our main project Twitter handle which is also a co host of the space right now which you'll see at the top of the page Stacking Dao. So yeah, just follow myself and our Stacking Dao page to get all the latest updates and something else as well I'd like to mention if you have any idle stacks in your wallets, you know please like don't hesitate to deposit on Stacking Dao to earn auto compounding rewards. And as I mentioned before, STSTX is the best way to express a bullish view on stacks.
00:24:51.625 - 00:25:13.045, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much Leo. It was a pleasure hosting you guys. For the rest of the audience, we do have a few updates on Sticking Circle coming. We have a major announcement tomorrow. Stay tuned for it. And I guess we will be back next week with another space and this is a major one. There's a huge surprise incoming so stay tuned.
00:25:13.045 - 00:25:38.437, Speaker A: Leo, you're also invited to come to that space and listen because it will be a lot of offer. I think we will talk a little bit about BTC risk taking. Maybe we will, maybe we don't. I guess as you said you need to stay tuned to see it. So yeah guys, thank you very much for everyone attending and for everyone listening to the recording. Don't forget to always check Sticking Circle stacking dial content. There's a lot of offer coming.
00:25:38.437 - 00:25:39.421, Speaker A: So cheers.
00:25:39.533 - 00:25:40.925, Speaker B: Thanks so much guys. Have a good one.
