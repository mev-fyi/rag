00:00:01.520 - 00:00:44.897, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah, I think let's get started. So, as always, let's give a quick introduction of what Staking Circle is. So, Staking Circle is an organization dedicated to fostering collaboration and innovation within the DEFI ecosystem. Specifically, as the name implies, focusing on all things staking. And basically the organization intends to bring together professionals from various sectors of the DeFi space. So that is protocols, VCs, funds and blockchain networks where we are trying to create a synergistic environment where ideas, resources and strategies can be shared to help advance the understanding and implementation of staking and restaking practices within DeFi.
00:00:44.897 - 00:00:57.775, Speaker A: And without further ado. Yeah. I'd like to welcome SRU. Great to have you guys here. Maybe if you want to provide a quick introduction about yourself and then we can dive straight into it.
00:01:00.555 - 00:01:30.527, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you for the invitation. My name is Ross and I'm co founder of Stroom. So. But today I'm from Stroom Network account. Yeah, so we, we started our path in crypto in 2016 when we joined Bitfir Group and worked there on the Light Network technologies and other big bitcoin ecosystem technologies. And later I worked at Lido Finance.
00:01:30.527 - 00:02:11.905, Speaker B: And yeah, like the first second transaction was made by me because I was a product manager there and I need to test the protocol before announcement. Yeah. And yeah, so after that I worked with Busti. Boost is also one of the biggest dev shop and it was more like a consulting experience. I worked there with different DEFI protocols on ramp of ram solutions, wallets, etc. And yeah, so. And at some point, so idea of Stroom came to my mind and it's simply just like a.
00:02:11.905 - 00:02:26.095, Speaker B: Some kind of like overlapping of my previous experiences in Light Network and Bitcoin and in liquid staking at L. Yes.
00:02:26.135 - 00:02:26.311, Speaker C: So.
00:02:26.343 - 00:02:30.635, Speaker B: And like I pitched my idea to Slava and we decided to go Fundstrom.
00:02:31.695 - 00:02:59.565, Speaker A: Okay, thank you so much for the introduction. Great. Yeah, so I think like, you know, might as well just dive straight into it. I think if maybe in layman's terms, if you can explain what is proof of work essentially, and maybe the difference from proof of stake and then if we can then pivot into Bitcoin staking. And what makes it different from the current proof of stake we see now with Ethereum.
00:03:03.545 - 00:03:14.635, Speaker B: Yeah. Also on that space, Slava together with us. Slava is our cto. And yeah, I think it's a very good question for him.
00:03:15.895 - 00:03:53.715, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. Yeah, I will also tell a short introduction about myself. I have technical background. I finished Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology And Stony Brook University at New York. My degree was in applied mathematics. So as you can see I love to solve some different puzzles and logical problems and that's why I like crypto industry. Because in crypto there are lots of challenges, technical challenges that you need to solve and it's super interesting for me.
00:03:53.715 - 00:04:39.635, Speaker C: Yeah. Regarding the difference between the proof of work and proof of stake. Yeah. So as you can see, as you probably everyone know that bitcoin blockchain is. It was the first blockchain invented and it works on proof of work when you need to in order to add a block to the blockchain you need to solve computationally intense task. So you need the specialized hardware to do so because on the regular PCs or even GPUs Bitcoin network you can't do that. So people devote a lot of resources to mine blocks and that's how they achieve security of their network.
00:04:39.635 - 00:05:24.025, Speaker C: That's how the overall network is secured. But in proof. Like lately some people were claiming that it's not. It's somehow waste of resources or like because you burn a lot of energy when you solve this computational task. So it was a big push from the community to utilize some security mechanisms that is not so resource intensive. So that's how people start thinking about inventing something like proof of stake where resources that you devote it's not like burning energy to. To.
00:05:24.025 - 00:06:25.015, Speaker C: So it's because it's like some environmental issues with that. So they now in proof of stake, if you are a miner and you want to add a block so you need to provide some stake in form of tokens locked for some period of time and if you behave honestly then you earn something on top of your stake. That's how proof of. That's how like staking arises here. But so, but if you behave not honestly then your stake is slashed so you lose all money. So that's like simple incentive mechanisms that make sure that everyone in the system behaves honestly and in for the sake of security of the whole network.
00:06:29.155 - 00:06:50.745, Speaker A: Lovely, thank you so much for that insight. So I guess then moving into stream. So how are you guys enabling bitcoin staking? Maybe if you can talk about I guess the underlying mechanisms within that and then I guess that's what makes stream unique and you know, happy for you to talk over a bit about that.
00:06:52.645 - 00:06:55.865, Speaker B: Yeah. So can you hear me?
00:06:57.045 - 00:06:58.145, Speaker A: Loud and clear.
00:06:59.325 - 00:07:40.345, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah. So why we call our solutions taken? Because like with Troom user can deposit their bitcoins and generate some yields in BTC and in bitcoin's ecosystem. It's possible only in lighting network in decentralized way. Like Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin blockchain. And it's a network of directional payment channels. And to make it work you need to put there some liquidity.
00:07:40.345 - 00:08:24.755, Speaker B: And this is like a beauty of this protocol because first of all it is horizontally scalable and it because this layer 2 is not a blockchain, it's just like a P2P network of the channels. And you can put some liquidity there, raw transactions, collect some fees and like earn these yields based on your bitcoin liquidity. So from the user perspective it looks just like a staking because you can stake your bitcoins and earn bitcoins on top of that.
00:08:26.095 - 00:09:09.835, Speaker C: Yeah. But I want also to add that staking in lightning network technically much more challenging than just staking in proof of stake chains like Ethereum or Polygon or whatever. It requires much more advanced algorithm in management liquidity in lighting network. So yeah, so it's harder to do so, so it's harder to run lighting network node. And in stroom we aim to provide people with possibility to stake in lighting network without all of that technical, technical burden of running a lighting network node.
00:09:11.175 - 00:09:34.475, Speaker A: Okay, great. Yeah, I think you guys have like pivoted almost to my next question. And you know, that is like what are the advantages of using strewn? So maybe if you can talk about a few others. Obviously you've now mentioned that you know, there's not this technical requirement from a user standpoint, but are there potentially any eligibility requirements for a user who's willing to, you know, participate within strew?
00:09:38.975 - 00:10:27.815, Speaker C: No, there is no requirements. So any user, I mean like the user from the, like from legally okay. Jurisdictions can participate in our protocol. So they just need to deposit bitcoins into our multisig vault and then the infrastructure providers will do the rest. And another advantage of using the strum, that's where actually liquid part coming in. So we don't keep this liquidity frozen. We actually provide a user a wrapped token which is one to one convertible to bitcoin.
00:10:27.815 - 00:11:05.025, Speaker C: So this token lives on Ethereum blockchain and user can take that token and use it in any defi protocol he wants. Defi protocol that will be integrated with us. And so you can trade it on Dex, you can lend it or you can use it as a collateral. So that increases the utility of that liquidity. So it's like your liquidity working simultaneously in two different places and you can achieve yields in both defi and on lighting network.
00:11:06.925 - 00:11:18.025, Speaker A: Sounds great. Just one question in terms of like maintaining the peg. So one to one of let's say stream BTC for example and btc, how are you guys managing that?
00:11:24.295 - 00:12:39.675, Speaker C: So we always preserve user ability to redeem token wrapped token to actually bitcoins to physical bitcoins on bitcoin blockchain. So we have some portion of reserves dedicated for that. It's like around 10 to 15% of overall liquidity in the protocol. So that resource will be used to pay out redemptions. But in case if some situation happens, for example, I don't know, like bear market again and people want to withdraw More than 15% of overall liquidity in that case we just need to close lighting network channels which is on chain operation that takes like three confirmations on Bitcoin blockchain so it's like 30 minutes and then in the worst case we can close all channels if we need and pay all bitcoins, pay out all bitcoins redemptions to users but hopefully that's not going to happen.
00:12:42.975 - 00:13:11.685, Speaker A: Okay, great. Thank you so much for that. I think like another question, you know a lot of people obviously are very interested as it is a bull market in terms of yields and returns in terms of let's say bitcoin staking through strew. Obviously right now there is no, let's call it a native yield. For example, what are your guys predictions in you know, potential returns for users?
00:13:21.185 - 00:13:24.085, Speaker C: Are you asking specifically for Lightning Network?
00:13:25.665 - 00:13:32.925, Speaker A: Yeah. Or you can give us like a more thorough rundown on the various aspects.
00:13:34.515 - 00:14:27.385, Speaker C: Yeah. So in Lightning Network our research data suggests that it can be achieved like 3% even up to 5% APY, which is very nice for bitcoin. I think as far as I understand the other layer, two solutions to bitcoin, none of them actually have native yield. In bitcoins for example in stacks if you stake bitcoins you receive rewards in stacks token. So it's slightly different. The beauty of using Lightning network for the staking that your rewards in Lightning network is paid in native bitcoin currencies so you don't deal with some other token that can drop in value.
00:14:31.215 - 00:14:55.235, Speaker A: Yeah, I must say that is one very attractive aspect and it could potentially be a nice moat for Lightning Network and on top of that stream. So yeah, very exciting to see that. I guess getting into it a bit strewn Mainnet, what timeline do you guys have there? Maybe you can provide some insight into your roadmap.
00:14:57.295 - 00:15:40.041, Speaker B: Yeah, so as you know like we started our test Net a few weeks ago and currently we have like around 10k testnet users. So yeah we see like a very good traction and like currently fixing a few bugs and also adding new features to our Testnet. And speaking about timeline of Mainnet launch, we plan to launch it 100 this year and but it will be like around end of second quarter or like in third.
00:15:40.113 - 00:15:40.321, Speaker C: So.
00:15:40.353 - 00:15:44.005, Speaker B: Okay, somewhere at summer this is our target.
00:15:45.985 - 00:16:27.175, Speaker A: Oh, exciting. And congrats on those numbers. Must say those are very impressive and looking forward to obviously your guys Mainnet and I think you know like pivoting a bit away potential risks. I know with people holding Bitcoin most people are pretty reluctant I would say to you know, use it within defi, let alone, you know, stake it, etc. So in terms of risks, what risks have you guys identified and you know, how are you guys looking at mitigating those risks and basically giving users the confidence to utilize their Bitcoin since it is technically a new aspect compared to eth.
00:16:29.915 - 00:17:40.355, Speaker B: Yeah. So okay, first of all I want to say that we are decentralized protocol so we don't have any risks related to decentralized exchanges or some products like Celsius was or something like that. Also some like a liquid staking Bitcoin or bitcoin staking protocols also uses like exchanges like to earn something on trading and so on. So like we don't have any economical risks. So like we don't like gamble with these bitcoins and so on. Yeah, and I think like the main risks risks is technical ones or like a risk on smart contracts or something like that. But like a security is one of the I think important in our product and our like a full we are fully focused on security side and even like when we try to make some trade offs between good user experience and security, we always choose security.
00:17:40.355 - 00:17:45.185, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Maybe Slava also can add something.
00:17:45.885 - 00:18:50.515, Speaker C: Yeah, as Ross said the most the biggest risk for our project is technical one that is related to running the bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum and actually there are several bridge projects that are already like operational. I want to notice two of them. One is WBTC and another is TBTC from the Threshold network. So WBTC was, it is the longest living bridge from Bitcoin blockchain to Ethereum blockchain and it has like last time I checked it has like 5 billion in TVL threshold. TBTC had like several hundreds of thousands in TVL of millions. Sorry. Yeah, so actually WBTC is centralized, it's run by a single company.
00:18:50.515 - 00:19:24.221, Speaker C: But it was a first bridge, so that's why a lot of people using it. But TBTC in my opinion is the most secure bridge from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It's very simple. It's not like a wormhole or some complex bridge. It's super simple. It's just for moving bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to Ethereum. So the attacking surface is very low and it has like hundreds of validators that validating bridging transactions.
00:19:24.221 - 00:20:15.545, Speaker C: And we actually using the same architecture as Threshold BTC because it's in our opinion the most secure Bitcoin bridge currently on the market. Yeah, we use in the same architecture and that's regarding the architectural risks. So our bridge will be as secure as TBTC bridge. And also of course we will do a lot of audits to make sure that we don't have any bugs in our software. So we really tries to maximize the security of the project because in our opinion all infrastructure projects, they need to prioritize security first and we are because of infrastructure projects, we doing that.
00:20:17.485 - 00:20:59.835, Speaker A: Great, thank you. And I think an interesting aspect, obviously we've briefly run down that say the user participating in stroom, but maybe you can give us a glimpse into like what is the capabilities of stbtc. So I come to stream, I deposit my btc, I now have sdbtc. What do you see the potential use cases for that? I mean it may be pretty straightforward for some of the listeners here, I guess who've obviously used SD ETH or whatever it may be. But yeah, keen to learn a bit about where you guys see this and potentially how big the asset may be. Are we looking at a competitor to SDE which users may favor?
00:21:09.215 - 00:21:52.755, Speaker C: So of course we plan to integrate our ST BTC token into blue chip or DEFI protocols like AAVE and Curve and all of that. Of course that will be available on dexas for sure. But also that's going to be by functionality very similar to wbtc. But the only difference that it has some yield on top of that. But actually wbtc, they require you to pay some fee when you're doing withdrawal. We will not do that. We will pay users for staking bitcoins in our protocol.
00:21:52.755 - 00:22:23.885, Speaker C: Yeah, but also very interesting narrative. Currently on the market it's liquid restaking protocols like Eigenlayer and we also would love to be integrated in angular layer and we'll do everything to achieve that. Yeah, we just need to get some traction on the market and some track records so such protocols can integrate STBTC into them.
00:22:25.625 - 00:23:06.905, Speaker B: Yeah, also just want to add that also like we see the race of like a Bitcoin L2s and roll ups on bitcoin and from the other hand a lot of bitcoin users are bitcoin only and bitcoin max guys and they don't want like interact with other ecosystems like Ethereum. So also we plan to integrate our liquid token to bitcoin tools especially to roll ups. Yeah and we like started conversation with few of them. So like in parallel we also have, we will have like a solution for only bitcoin people as well.
00:23:09.165 - 00:23:36.375, Speaker A: It's very exciting stuff and I think you know like pivoting from there. You know you guys obviously had a race if I'm looking correctly it's a website must have very impressive VC is there. So congratulations on that. And in terms of like mainnet potential integrations, how can users stay updated about Stream's progress and you know where can they go and learn a bit more about Stream and what you guys are doing.
00:23:44.085 - 00:23:49.701, Speaker B: Sorry, can you repeat please the end of the phrase the question.
00:23:49.893 - 00:24:09.535, Speaker A: No worries. What I was saying is you know how can users stay up to date regarding your guys progress. So this could be mainnet, this could be potential partnership announcement and for those who are obviously a bit more curious to maybe do a bigger deep dive into Stream and Lightning network, you know where can they find these resources?
00:24:13.475 - 00:26:05.033, Speaker B: Yeah so like for a long like after the race for pretty long time the main focus was a product and yeah maybe we didn't like grow our community and as well because like we are pretty, I don't know a little bit conservative in this question and we wanted to like deliver something between work on it and so like as we said like we already launched our testnet and currently the main focus is community building as well. So like we also open to work with different ambassadors and yeah like or any communities who are interested in bitcoin technologies and can help us to find like a early adopters in the future. And in parallel we are working hard on our managed solution. So the first stage of the testnet like it was just to test our user interface and like an overall lot on bridge and some specific functions. Also plan to make the update in common weeks and add validators to our bridge. So we also signed a few very good validators and we will announce this partnership soon after that we need to add a few features and make the audits, security audits and then launch our mainnet. Yeah so this is like the main what we're working in Very exciting.
00:26:05.089 - 00:26:27.375, Speaker A: So yeah, I would definitely encourage everyone to go give Stream a follow and to keep up to date with various updates. And then I think finally, obviously you know there's quite a lot of events and conferences happening right now around the world. Any that you guys are going to and you know people can potentially bump into the founders, co founders and team of Strew.
00:26:30.915 - 00:27:01.665, Speaker B: Yeah. So currently. So currently maybe you know that a big light network conference in Tuscany and one of like our third co founder and a few people from our team are there and we also plan to visit Paris Blockchain week. Yeah. And like a plan to be on the most of big conferences in Europe but also maybe we'll visit a few months in Asia as well.
00:27:03.205 - 00:27:36.725, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Well that'd be great you know, for anyone listening if you guys end up at those conferences to look out for the Stream team and I'm sure they'd appreciate you guys haggling them with many, many questions. But yeah, I just really want to say, you know, thank you so much for participating. It's been great. Really looking forward to, you know, seeing how you guys progress throughout the year. I definitely think Stream is going to be a very exciting feature to the Defi ecosystem and bitcoin. So yeah, thank you so much for your time gentlemen.
00:27:39.145 - 00:27:58.571, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for the invitation and for listeners like please follow our Twitter and like we will keep you updated with our progress and yes like you can find all news about bitcoin staking and especially Bostrom. Yeah, thank you a lot.
00:27:58.763 - 00:28:01.015, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you a lot for having us.
00:28:01.755 - 00:28:03.735, Speaker A: Thank you. Goodbye.
00:28:04.795 - 00:28:05.675, Speaker C: Thank you. Goodbye.
