00:00:04.480 - 00:00:06.180, Speaker A: Everyone use a different like.
00:00:06.640 - 00:00:38.714, Speaker B: All right, we are ready to kick start the second panel. I hope everyone can hear you slightly better now. Let's try to keep this shorter and simpler. Guys, first of all, welcome. Sorry for the wait, but I'm sure this will be amazing. 1. First of all, can I ask each one of you to introduce yourselves? You were all previous guests, so most of the people already know you from our Twitter spaces from our events, but nevertheless, can I have an introduction from your side?
00:00:38.882 - 00:01:02.442, Speaker C: Absolutely. My name is Joao, I'm CEO and co founder at Inception omidchain LRT Protocol and currently going full meta lrts. And now we are going to share some alpha and meta lrts here where you can with one click go on multiple infrastructures which we are going to revolutionize the space in the early Q1 next year.
00:01:02.626 - 00:01:04.074, Speaker B: Thank you very much, Gregory.
00:01:04.202 - 00:01:17.590, Speaker D: Hi guys, I'm Greg, I'm from Bob, the first hybrid L2 where our vision is we want to bring the massive liquidity from Ethereum and Bitcoin. So we're working quite heavily with bitvm to enable that for a permissionless future.
00:01:18.210 - 00:01:44.700, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Moko, I'm CEO and co founder of StakeModz.com and we are staking aggregator over six years now and we integrate different staking opportunities across different assets. We have Ethereum, integrated Bitcoin and many others. So we integrate for example Inceptionality and Bob and different staking opportunities and make it easy for anyone to stake BTC, ETH and any other token.
00:01:46.160 - 00:02:07.708, Speaker E: Here's Chris from StakeZone. It's a great honor to be here Stone, I'm co contributor Stack Zone and Stack Zone is a omnichannel liquidity infrastructure and we help connect the liquidity demand side and supply side with our yield bearing and non yield bearing assets namely Stone yield bearing east sbdc, Non Y bearing BDC and Stone BDC yield bearing Bitcoin. Thank you.
00:02:07.844 - 00:02:32.128, Speaker B: All right guys, welcome. I want to kickstart this smoothly but straight to the point so everyone talks about now, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, btcfi. How can the users start making some yield on bitcoin? What are your views on it and how do you predict this will happen? Short and simple, because we will dive deeper into it in a few minutes. Again, if any of you wants to kickstart.
00:02:32.224 - 00:03:06.660, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, I can start. So first of course we need more AVSs for this, right? So more infrastructure. Currently we have Babylon leading the way and I think that, well if you see all the big whales, they are part of The BTC Time BTC ecosystem. Right. So BTC wants to go to defi. Right. And that's exactly our mission is to bring yields to btc, is to bring share security to BTC and to make it happen in a way that instead of you having your BTC on your cold wallets doing nothing, at least you get 2, 3, 4% yields on your BTC.
00:03:06.660 - 00:03:19.596, Speaker C: The way to do it I think like we are super, super early in the game so there will be a lot, a lot of things to be made and to be researched in early next year. But I think that everyone here is leading the way to that. So very excited.
00:03:19.788 - 00:03:21.020, Speaker B: Thank you Gregory.
00:03:21.100 - 00:03:32.720, Speaker D: Yeah, I haven't got much to add to that. It was a good answer. I think if I summarize the state of play in the most simplistic way possible. Protocol stake into Babylon users stake into protocols and they get yield.
00:03:33.620 - 00:03:56.740, Speaker A: Yeah I think nowadays everyone is pretty much used that you can earn some sort of interest on your tokens because proof of stake is so accept already with like eth having a yield and so on. So there's actually a lot of people also on BTC that don't do anything with it and wonder yeah what to do really. So they're actively searching for yield as well and it seems like a concept that is ripe also for the BTC space Really.
00:03:57.760 - 00:04:33.480, Speaker E: I think for Bitcoin there are majorly two kinds of yields. The first is the proof of stake potentials brought by Babylon and the second is alongside all the bitcoin lrts LSDS build upon of Babylon you can get some more organic rewards in the application layers. For example what Bob is building is you get the interest rate in the lending protocol for BTC related assets or on a uniswap you can get a trading fees. So I think in general for what kind of assets they are just yields from consensus layer and yields from application layers. It's similar for BTC as well.
00:04:34.260 - 00:05:19.130, Speaker B: I agree with you and I want to pick on something I think not sure if it was you Gregory or Jerome that said at the beginning about the avss I'm not sure who mentioned the concept. So right now like Babylon is bringing yield for bitcoin. Babylon is a restaking platform. Babylon will be supporting AVSs but what the hell are AVS's because I see a lot of people talking about AVS's and many AVS is coming out but I still receive on the staking circle page is probably one of the most asked questions is what are the AVSs in the end of the day, can you give us like a brief definition from your perspective? How do you see them and what do you think is a proper AVS in the market or that the market really needs?
00:05:22.470 - 00:05:31.330, Speaker E: Yeah, of course, in one sentence, AVS is a buyer of the share security, no matter is provided by time lock, Bitcoin or the restake Ethereum.
00:05:32.860 - 00:06:26.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the issue is really like which AVSs, which networks and services that are looking to decentralize really are willing to pay for shared security and can pay for shared security that are also not launching their own token themselves to be able to stake and already have security that can be used for securing the network. So it has to be something that doesn't have their own token and just wants to buy security. And then somehow there needs to be a lot of revenue generated in that system as well. And I don't know, I haven't seen any yet that really has like, yeah, generating revenue and also doesn't have a token because everything seems to have a token. So it's. I mean that's a bearish case I guess on avs and restaking yield. But I also think there is a scenario where there actually will be applications that also produce yield.
00:06:26.350 - 00:06:33.066, Speaker A: I guess the best would be something like stablecoins because stablecoins is the only real use case in crypto.
00:06:33.098 - 00:06:43.070, Speaker C: It needs to exist. It needs to exist without yields. We need more and more rewards. We need to evolve, we need to go out of this loop. Otherwise it will be unsustainable.
00:06:43.730 - 00:06:58.400, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what's happening right now. It's just kind of more protocols launching everyone launching their own token and points and that's pretty much where the yield is coming from. There's no real sustainable yield source yet.
00:06:58.520 - 00:07:04.208, Speaker B: I guess what we need is an AVS without a token. Gregory, do you want to add anything here?
00:07:04.264 - 00:07:06.224, Speaker D: No, I think they've summarized my points perfectly.
00:07:06.352 - 00:07:20.700, Speaker B: All right guys, trying to keep this short, we have Eggen layer, then we had symbiotic Carac Babylon for btc. What will come next in terms of infrastructure? Nothing.
00:07:21.760 - 00:08:22.360, Speaker C: I think that I can talk a little bit about inception here. Like the way that I think that because there are already a lot of infrastructure providers, is then the job of the LRT protocol to actually make a kind of a secondary infrastructure on top that allows the users to restake more easily. Right. So and what we are doing with the meta lrts is really like with one click you access all the multiple pools and multiple infrastructures in one click and then all the job of choosing the pools, go to the node operators and then choosing the AVS's inside of each infrastructure. And we also help a bit on that on the back end. But it's really like to simplify the way to restake because it's also again, unsustainable to continue to produce a lot, a lot of infrastructure providers if you don't have yields, if you don't have avss paying rewards. So I think that now it's our job in the LRT protocol level to actually help the user to bring even more tvl, even more liquidity, by making the journey as simple as possible.
00:08:24.980 - 00:08:31.724, Speaker B: And how do you think all these infrastructures will impact the user strategies at the end of the day to get those rewards?
00:08:31.852 - 00:08:35.282, Speaker C: Depends on the AVS's. How much are you paying?
00:08:35.476 - 00:08:39.970, Speaker E: Yeah, we really do need more ABSs for the existing infrastructure. Right.
00:08:41.150 - 00:08:43.050, Speaker B: Anything you want to add, guys?
00:08:43.470 - 00:08:53.210, Speaker D: Yeah, I think as the ecosystem grows, we're going to see a lot more competition, reduction in fees, additional rewards, and more ways for users to earn on the bitcoin specifically.
00:08:54.030 - 00:09:36.534, Speaker B: All right, picking up on what you said earlier and with the promise that I gave you that these would be shorter, we spoke about points, but points are something. And the incentives programs are something that protocols, AVS infrastructures are all using to bootstrap in the early days of the protocol. What's coming after the points? What's the strategy that protocols are adopting? And well, I would like to maybe hear you guys kick starting on this one because I think a lot of people now are just stuck on points and they don't know what happens after the points. They just dump the token. And that's not the strategy at the end of the day. So what are you guys planning and what are the steps forward?
00:09:36.702 - 00:09:53.142, Speaker D: Sure, I think everyone's tired of points by this point. Everyone, their mom has a point system. So it's really overplayed. Blast. I think innovated in the space quite a lot and it drew a lot of attention back to the protocols. Interesting work there. So we're guilty of it.
00:09:53.142 - 00:10:17.358, Speaker D: We're running a points program. It's a great way for attracting users and to engage the users on our platform which they otherwise wouldn't want to facilitate that continued interaction. But it is a good question, what comes after the points program? From my side, there are some things I can't say, but there are some expectations. What comes after points system?
00:10:17.414 - 00:10:19.330, Speaker B: Spill the alpha spiel. Alpha.
00:10:21.050 - 00:10:39.510, Speaker D: But I will say that there are many mechanisms point systems do enable, like the gamification. I Think is one of the best things that come out of it. And it can really. I think we can still use those mechanisms in different ways with different incentives, different ideas and can get those users to continue engaging with our platform and our partners.
00:10:41.690 - 00:11:20.850, Speaker A: I think the thing that really talks about points is that it's like so intransparent, basically how points are actually translating to real tokens in the end. So I think we have to solve the issue that actually when you have some sort of incentives, you need to know exactly how much you're getting out of it, otherwise there's no point and you're just going to get fucked over by kind of multipliers and bonuses and I don't know. Then they introduce new points for everything, for this and this and that. And in the end as a user you don't even know anymore, like what are you getting? What does it even mean to get points?
00:11:21.230 - 00:11:27.290, Speaker B: Wales Market I think is trying to do some job there, but even those are not accurate.
00:11:33.950 - 00:12:27.538, Speaker E: Yes, I think the points is actually becoming serious problem for. I would say. Okay, yeah, yeah. So I think points started to become kind of problem for builders in this industry as liquidity providers and users got tired of it. So I totally agree with the opinion for intransparency and I think a good example for this is probably like Morphle, they're offering basically intransferable tokens and you can calculate API based on some of the very simple actions like providing liquidity. As long assets will get higher using collaterals, the long tail assets will get lower. So I think actually this is probably something that in the future more protocols would adopt because it is more predictable and like for Stackson.
00:12:27.538 - 00:13:05.880, Speaker E: At midst of the staking circle event we announced the new round led by Polychain which with a total of 22mil. So yeah, we are heading to the next stage and definitely we're rethinking about what's the best way we can do in this new stage after this very exciting announcement. How we can further incentivize users with more predictable benefits or share more trust and credits, long term credits with those institutional and large LPs that has been working with us for the past years. So I think this is actually something that. Yeah, I think it's kind of pivot points for the points. Yeah.
00:13:06.300 - 00:13:11.732, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Joel, do you want to add something?
00:13:11.916 - 00:13:37.200, Speaker C: Yeah. So for us I think inception points is mainly to incentivize the users, is about community, is about bringing more incentives and of course preparing the airdrop. Right. So for us it's a way to incentivize communities mainly. But of course that if every protocol, everyone is doing points, it can get tiring and it's like it's just going around and around in the circle. Right. We need to stop.
00:13:37.320 - 00:14:06.070, Speaker B: All right. Thank you for your insights. First of all, welcome. Congratulations on the new founding. Let me just briefly touch base on the Bitcoin ETFs. They started at the beginning of the year. Do you guys foresee that these Bitcoin ETFs will move into defi? Will they bring liquidity defi or will just be buy and hodl with these new ETFs?
00:14:07.770 - 00:14:32.472, Speaker A: I don't think there were. I think it also still took a long time for ETH even to be staked and then there's still a lot of regulation and hurdles also in terms of insurance and like really making sure that it's absolutely secure. And we have to have the same thing about bitcoin. But bitcoin is way more risky to stake in general. So I think it will take a long time.
00:14:32.656 - 00:14:39.800, Speaker B: But don't you think it. Okay, I agree. No, I was about to ask like. I see.
00:14:39.840 - 00:14:40.168, Speaker A: I think.
00:14:40.224 - 00:15:01.604, Speaker B: I do think that the bitcoin staking parody will take some time to adopted especially because of the user of bitcoin. It's different than the Ethereum user or the other token users. But do you think the Bitcoin ETF will have a quick shift to the staking environment, to the defi environment or not?
00:15:01.692 - 00:15:15.536, Speaker C: Yes, because it bring more institutional adoption. Of course. More institutional adoption, more money, more investment banks. You know, Blackrock is already in J.P. morgan. You know like these guys are coming next. Goldman probably coming next.
00:15:15.536 - 00:15:26.940, Speaker C: So that's trillions and trillions of dollars that is coming into crypto. And now with the bull market vibes. By the way, we just had a new all time high like one hour ago or something. So like it's just a matter of time.
00:15:27.240 - 00:15:43.814, Speaker D: Yeah. To harken that. I guess. Yeah. We're such an early phase of bitcoin defi. Babylon hasn't even launched and that's one of the biggest opportunities for staking. I think it's just going to take time for the ETFs and and regulatory people to realize the opportunities there and slowly adopt it.
00:15:43.814 - 00:15:52.690, Speaker D: Of course there's some speculation with the recent results of the US election things will shift in a particular way but anyone can guess what's going to happen.
00:15:53.550 - 00:16:06.338, Speaker E: Totally agree. I think it's always right to dream big. I know some of the bitcoin Assets Issuers is also already started doing a pitching so who knows. But yeah, it's always right to join big, right?
00:16:06.474 - 00:16:27.922, Speaker B: All right, thank you very much guys. Final question for you and I wasn't about to ask this, I skipped this question, but you guys mentioned all of you this. What do you think of institutions and institutions and Bitcoin? Is it something for the long run? Is it something that is just now giving your perspective and we can wrap this up?
00:16:28.026 - 00:16:31.308, Speaker C: Long run, of course, yeah.
00:16:31.324 - 00:16:46.120, Speaker D: From the Bob side we're seeing a lot of demand. We have a product called Bob Stake and a lot of interest. We're working now with key partners such as staking rewards and seeing real usage from users and institutions that are interested in using it in some capacity. So yeah, I think so.
00:16:46.820 - 00:17:10.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a huge demand because institutions that are already holding crypto, they know that it can stake crypto. It's a concept that is really starting to be much, much more popular. So I think there will demand for some sort of like bitcoin staking even at some point. So I think in the long run 100% and I can't wait until microstrategy stakes their bitcoin.
00:17:10.900 - 00:17:28.971, Speaker C: Yeah, but just to just to give some comment there, the majority of the institutions are actually looking at staking and not restaking for example because restaking is already too risky for now. So I think it will take time to go on restaking but they're already looking at staking. So it's a matter of maybe staking.
00:17:29.115 - 00:17:32.523, Speaker A: Restaking and then defi and yeah, and.
00:17:32.531 - 00:17:36.999, Speaker C: Then karak with restaking of restaked assets. So that's the final one.
00:17:37.619 - 00:18:15.556, Speaker E: I think institutions definitely the future as like Saison majorly work with different kinds of liquidity providers. Most of them are different kinds of institutions miners. I see their interest as well as the real actions in participation gradually increase over past years. And before this event I spoke with one of our very large institute LPs. They actually said they are internally they are debating because they made attempts for deploying bitcoins, deploying Ethereum assets in staking, restaking on application layers and they got the rewards. They're actually trying to build a long term framework to evaluate different kinds of opportunities. So I see that they actually take actions.
00:18:15.556 - 00:18:37.510, Speaker E: Right, right. With hundreds of millions of dollars and they are actually trying to even with debates with arguments like we just give it up, we never do that. But still half of their teams believe is like still worth trying and trying to build a framework. So I think long term speaking with that institution, adoptions and participation is definitely something key.
00:18:37.970 - 00:18:53.280, Speaker B: Okay, thank you very much guys. Any final remarks, any farewells to the people listening to us and bear in mind that at home we have a lot of people listening. We are broadcasting this for YouTube Twitter. So if you want to give any final remarks, go ahead.
00:18:54.060 - 00:19:08.680, Speaker C: Thank you for being here and just follow inception@inceptionlrt.com and look for our meta lrts that will be coming out in a matter of weeks where you can restake one click all the infrastructures. So it's going to be amazing.
00:19:09.660 - 00:19:12.200, Speaker D: I think three words build on Bitcoin.
00:19:12.700 - 00:19:14.480, Speaker B: Thank you enough.
00:19:15.340 - 00:19:30.480, Speaker A: Yeah, stakingworlds.com, we're building the best multi chain staking experience. We integrated Bitcoin staking, native staking, liquid staking and other staking opportunities and just aggregate all staking opportunities in one place.
00:19:31.340 - 00:19:55.264, Speaker E: It's a great honor to be here for this wonderful event and all this awesome panelists and partners. So Sigstone is dedicating to provide different yield opportunities for LPs. And yeah, I said we have a new announcement. We're going to come over with more official ones and more yield opportunities later on our official Twitter. So stay tuned and glad to be here.
00:19:55.432 - 00:20:13.602, Speaker B: Okay guys, thank you very much for everyone that attended the event in person that is attending by the broadcast. I hope to see you around on the coming events. We'll have more events. We'll be doing Twitter spaces with Staking circle and all these amazing guests more oftenly. So thank you all and let's have some drinks and food.
00:20:13.706 - 00:20:14.370, Speaker C: Yes. Thanks.
00:20:14.450 - 00:20:14.850, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:20:14.890 - 00:20:15.474, Speaker D: Thanks everyone.
00:20:15.562 - 00:20:15.890, Speaker A: Cheers.
