00:00:00.240 - 00:00:06.645, Speaker A: Well, awesome, guys, let's, let's just wait a few minutes until some more people join and we're good to start.
00:00:08.225 - 00:00:10.965, Speaker B: Sounds great. Sounds great.
00:02:26.955 - 00:03:10.895, Speaker A: Hello. Hello everyone. So let's not wait further. So my name is Simone and I'll be your host for today. Today we have a really nice guest. We have Oliver from Future Finance. Oliver, can you hear to me, can you give a brief introduction about yourself and what you do at Future Finance? Sorry, can you hear me, Oliver?
00:03:18.155 - 00:04:14.065, Speaker B: And let me get into sort of giving a, just a brief overview of what we've been doing at Future. So Future was initially created in 2021 and our objective and our mission at FUTURE has been to build cutting edge asset management infrastructure to enable better on chain asset management on chain products. Everything ranging from index funds, passively managed index funds, to actively managed funds to yield aggregated funds. And you know, really taking advantage of the composability that defi Legos allow. And so since 2021 we've created a plethora of products and protocols that enable these products. And really, you know where we are with our latest iteration, we're very much at the forefront of what's now possible in terms of multi chain asset management.
00:04:16.765 - 00:04:25.565, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's awesome. Love to hear that. So basically your product is so let's say kind of stock for liquid staking.
00:04:26.865 - 00:05:10.269, Speaker B: Yes. So the product that we've recently launched is the Tracker Liquid Staking Index. Tracker is just a subsidiary of Future and it's our Arbitrum specific subsidiary. You know, we launched there for a number of reasons, but mainly because we wanted to create the most cost effective product for people to enter into. You know, one of the biggest problems with asset management products in general have been that they've been very expensive to get into. And that was one of the things that we wanted to make sure that we solved for in the latest version of our protocol. And so the Tracker Liquid Staking index is an index that invests into nine different liquid staking and restaking assets across three different blockchains.
00:05:10.269 - 00:05:54.589, Speaker B: And so, you know, in this we have Avalanche, we have Polygon, and then we have Arbitrum, which, you know, Arbitrum has done a great job of basically, you know, hosting all of the topics, sort of Ethereum based liquid staking and restaking tokens. And so we get our liquidity natively from there. And what this allows us to do is, you know, allows us to give a full picture a broad exposure to the liquid staking market. Not just what ETH is offering, but Also Polygon Avalanche as well. And it allows us to tap to native liquidity. So, you know, there's no need for wrapped asset liquidity. We can buy, you know, Savax on the Avalanche blockchain with, you know, the highest level of liquidity.
00:05:54.589 - 00:06:06.625, Speaker B: And what that really ends up meaning to the end user is that we can support a product that's very large in terms of capital without having to sacrifice on very good execution costs when we trade.
00:06:08.365 - 00:06:27.265, Speaker A: Yes. Sounds amazing. Now that we're talking about execution, what's the, let's say, the technological stack behind the technology? How can you guys aggregate these many LSTs and LRTs from so many chains and so many markets and build an index fund with this?
00:06:29.085 - 00:07:11.793, Speaker B: Great question. And that's really what we've been working on for the last 18 months. So just to give a bit of a brief sort of overview of our lifecycle, right. The first protocol that we launched was Future V1. And the most successful product launched on Future V1 is the Colony Avalanche Ecosystem Index. It's the largest index on Avalanche by a long way and is one of the largest on chain indexes globally. And when we was, you know, after we built that, we figured what is the next step for us in terms of building out the capabilities that we have and like, how can we push the industry forward? And it, it became very apparent that, you know, investing into the liquid staking narrative only on a single chain is very limiting.
00:07:11.793 - 00:08:10.277, Speaker B: And for people that would like to access the narrative across all of the chains that are available, I mean, we predominantly focus on EVM for now, you know, and all the EVM chains available, like there's no product that's offering that. And so that was our inspiration to then go on an 18 month journey to develop future V2. And that was because we were really breaking new ground. We're the only protocol right now that can hold assets across a number of different chains within a fund structure in a completely non custodial way. Any other iterations of that where they're holding multi chain assets is typically done through a centralized custody account, like a Coinbase Custody, for example. So we're the only ones to have enabled this in a completely definated way. So future V2 brings in a lot of firsts and you can visit our white papers and see all of the breakdown of the innovations that we've created.
00:08:10.277 - 00:09:13.995, Speaker B: But at the basis of it, we use layer 0 as our message passing protocol. We did an analysis of a lot of different message passing protocols and we figured that, you know, the one thing that really is important when it comes to passing messages across different chains is a lack of upgradability. It's really important that the admins of the bridge or of the message passing protocol are not able to upgrade the logic and force everybody who's using their protocol to upgrade with them. Because we've seen that, you know, majority of the hacks that have happened with regards to bridges has come through, you know, issues related to upgradability and Layer zero. They allow you to configure your very own security profile and no one else can tap into that or no one else can adjust that when we really like that. And so the innovations that we've brought are multi chain accounting. We have the idea of a home chain and then we have the idea of the concept of destination chains.
00:09:13.995 - 00:10:03.725, Speaker B: The home chain knows everything that's going on on all of the destination chains. And what that means is we can price the index at any time without, you know, we already know all of the assets that we hold on the destination chain. So if someone comes to the home chain to mint the index, we can mint it atomically. I think this is really important because a lot of time when people are talking about multi chain products, you think, oh, do I have to wait for, you know, swaps to be done, etc. The way our funds work is you, you invest a reserve asset into the fund that, let's say it's usdc. So USDC enters the fund and that's an atomic transaction. It happens completely atomically in one go, right? And then what happens is we then take that USDC that's accumulated and we invest it into the constituent assets.
00:10:03.725 - 00:10:47.003, Speaker B: So the different liquid staking assets across the different chains, we bridge via Stargate. And there's a lot of complexity that we've wrapped into these transactions to make it very simple for the end user. Now the advantage of this reserve model is that where if, let's say there's $10,000 in the reserve and someone wants to come and redeem $2,000 of the index that they hold, they don't need to execute any remote trades or any remote transactions for that. They can just take $2,000 from the $10,000 in the reserve. And so again that transaction is atomic. And we think this is a really good user experience for most people that are investing smaller amounts. They don't want to have to wait for all of these trade.
00:10:47.003 - 00:11:45.497, Speaker B: So typically there'll be enough assets within the reserve of the index to facilitate that. And so I'm happy to go in any direction you want in terms of more details. But ultimately we're bridging via layer zero. We take advantage of ping pong messaging and I think honestly we are one of the power users of layer zero. We're really using the full feature set because you got to imagine if we're going to, you know, buy 10 assets on a single chain, we're having to pack 10 0x trades into a message, send that message over, you know, trade the assets back to a common bridging asset like usdc and then we bridge the USDC back from the destination chain to the home chain. And then we ask the user, well, what do you want to receive in? And he says, oh, I want to receive it in uni tokens. And so we then trade all of the assets that we can't that we get from the bridge into uni tokens and distributes to the user.
00:11:45.497 - 00:11:50.545, Speaker B: And that whole process is just one metamask. Confirmed.
00:11:53.525 - 00:12:18.565, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Sir, I feel like this was a really detailed explanation on how your protocol works, but let me just try to recap a little bit on the underlying technology. So basically what you guys do is you get the information and the tokens from all the chain. Let's say that you support and then you bridge everything to X layer, and then it's from X layer that you get the information, right?
00:12:20.865 - 00:13:09.355, Speaker B: Yeah. So, well, we accept, we accept funds on the home chain and then we bridge, we bridge those funds to the destination chains. So like layer zero is not really a blockchain, right? It's just a path. It just, it's just like an interface and we pass messages between protocols and we say, okay, we want to take this assets from Arbitrum, transfer it to Avalanche when we get there. We want to buy Avalanche, we want to buy, you know, Savax and then we want to transfer Savax into the index. And then what we do is we send a message back from Avalanche to Arbitrum to let Arbitrum know, hey, by the way, we bought 45 Savax tokens. So just remember and store that information on the home chain and remember that for, you know, the next time because then that way we can accurately price the product.
00:13:10.815 - 00:13:21.915, Speaker A: Okay, awesome, awesome. I feel like I totally understand now. So is this the only product that you're building at the moment, the index, or do you guys have any more products and service that you offer?
00:13:22.695 - 00:14:03.963, Speaker B: So we're building a number of different products now. So, you know, we, we firmly believe that the liquid staking and restaking narrative, I mean, if you just have to check Defi Llama. It's the biggest segment of DEFI by far and we believe that's going to continue. There's going to be lots of innovation and lots of excite products coming out in this realm. So we wanted to have an index that represents that sector and that is the Tracker liquid staking index. It's going to represent all of the major liquid staking tokens that are out there and give people an easy place to just go and buy that narrative. However, there's other products that we're working on, some within the liquid staking realm, some not.
00:14:03.963 - 00:15:00.599, Speaker B: So the next product that we're going to be launching through Tracker is the Pendle Boosted ETH index. And so this is going to essentially take the Tracker liquid staking token which is probably generating around 4% yield right now and we're looking to really boost that up to north of 20% and it's going to be investing into Pendle LP positions and Pendle PT positions predominantly. All of them are going to be ETH liquid staking based positions. Right. And so this is going to allow people to either take a very like a much lower risk and just go with the Tracker liquid staking index but if they want to have, if they want to see much higher returns they can go to the Boost ETH fund as well. And that's going to be, you know we're, we're, we're literally I would say three, four weeks away from launching that. The logic is all in place, we're starting to test them and we're very excited about that.
00:15:00.599 - 00:15:36.085, Speaker B: But Future also has a number of other initiatives that it's looking at. Right. So you know we are a protocol and we're exploring many different sort of sectors. The first one we've just launched recently is the ArtX AI Fund and is essentially a mega cap fund investing into USDC ste and wrapped Bitcoin. And it's completely powered by ArtX's AI trading models. It rebalances every one to four hours. Just actively manage.
00:15:36.085 - 00:16:15.745, Speaker B: It's the only index really of its kind on chain has actively managed so aggressively. And this is the whole idea of the fund is to outperform the typical buy and hold benchmark strategies. And then we're also looking at gaming indexes because this really takes advantage of a lot of our multi chain capabilities that gaming tokens across many different chains, Meme coin tokens across many different chains. So there's a lot of different initiatives that we're, you know, we're currently engaged with and for us you know, we're always looking to work with great partners. We tend to love launching products with partners because that way we can get a massive amount of distribution and awareness.
00:16:17.645 - 00:16:40.215, Speaker A: Yeah, love to hear this man. Especially regarding the liquid risk taking and liquid. And liquid staking. Because here at Staking Circle we follow really close those narratives. I also have another question that is, do you guys have any competitors? And if so, what differentiates you guys from your competitors? So what is your unique selling point?
00:16:41.475 - 00:17:10.915, Speaker B: Yeah, so I would say that our main competitor is Index Coupe. You know, they are another company that are enabling these type of easy to use funds. They expose different narratives to people. They do a great job. And I think that that's our main differentiating factor right now. And I think it's interesting because we went in two different ways. They focused initially on getting a lot of defi Legos kind of enabled on their platform.
00:17:10.915 - 00:17:49.191, Speaker B: So they're able to access lots of different protocols and integrate those into their funds. And we focused on going multi chain. So right now we're the only, we're the only project out there that can support multi chain index funds. Nobody else can do it in the way that we do it. So that is our majority differentiating factor because we can create funds that access liquid staking yields on different chains and different chains have different incentives. So through one fund we can basically tap into all these different incentives that are going on across the EVM ecosystem. That is our major differentiating factor.
00:17:49.191 - 00:18:03.725, Speaker B: And we're now moving into, like I've said, supporting Pendle and supporting other defi Legos as well. Because we recognize that that's where we need to go next in order to provide like a very holistic service.
00:18:06.185 - 00:18:39.639, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds awesome. Really sounds like that you guys are building something really interesting. And now let's talk a little bit about what I feel like people think when they thought about an index and about a fund. So as well know, like regulation regarding funds is pretty heavily. So what kind of measures? And so in general, how can future finance navigate in these regulations that, that go around funds and index funds?
00:18:39.687 - 00:19:16.611, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's a great question. I think it's, it's, you know, something that is constantly evolving. I mean our personal setup is that we have a Cayman foundation that launches and manages all of our products. And we do that in a, you know, it's, you know, the laws really depend on where you launch the product. So Cayman is a very friendly foundation to, you know, crypto, to launching these types of products. And it's really the structure and the legal structure that we have is really the industry standard for, you know, many DEFI protocols out there. And so that's the first point.
00:19:16.611 - 00:19:47.275, Speaker B: And our foundation runs our website, it deploys our products, it manages our products, et cetera. The second part is that's now we've deployed the funds, we manage the funds. It's all blockchain based. So it's completely decentralized. There's no real one person or entity that is controlling everything. And I think that's really key is that our protocol is decentralized. Now the other aspect of it is the promotion side.
00:19:47.275 - 00:20:47.795, Speaker B: It's okay that you deploy in the Caymans, but if you can access our products from the uk, you know, that's, that that can be seen as you're promoting these products in the uk. And we have, you know, spoken with the FCA on these matters and essentially the way that we've handled it is we've just blocked the UK and the us The US is just more of a court, more out of caution. The uk, you know, it's, it's clear in their financial promotion laws that it doesn't really matter where the fund comes from. If it's accessible by the uk, then you know, it, it's sort of, you need to, you need to appease those, those promotion laws. So you know, there are a number of ways that you can handle that. And you know, those include you have to have a certain, like you have a questionnaire for suitability. Then you have to, if you want to have UK clients, when they come to your website, you have to give them a 24 hour sort of period where they can't do anything on your platform.
00:20:47.795 - 00:21:04.775, Speaker B: So I guess it's like a cooling off period. So there's many factors that you have to go through in order to be UK compliant. For us, we just didn't get enough business from the UK at this point to make that, you know, a priority. But I think in the future it definitely will be.
00:21:06.475 - 00:21:19.165, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome, man. You mentioned that future finance was decentralized. So I'm wondering how this works. Are you guys like a dao? Can you brief us a little bit on that?
00:21:19.865 - 00:21:53.615, Speaker B: Yeah. So the Future foundation includes the future dao, right? And the future DAO is managed by the PHDR token holders. And so the multi stakes that are sort of, you know, the PHDR token holders have given control of some of the key multisigs to a number of wallets that all agree and sign on specific activities like rebalancing and other treasury functions. So yeah, we operate as a DAO using the PHR token.
00:21:54.875 - 00:22:06.983, Speaker A: Oh yes. So that's the token that you guys have. Is that the only utility for the token or does the token allows you to do other things? What's the purpose of the token?
00:22:07.159 - 00:23:00.935, Speaker B: So the fourth, primarily it is all about governance because, you know, as we generate revenue, as we generate, you know, we have, you know, income from different streams, it is ultimately a decision of, well, do we distribute those, do we reinvest those? Like what do we do with those funds? And that is the decisions that are made by the PSGR token holders, other decisions that we've made recently. You see, future V2 is under a business source license. So in order for new chains to use it or new projects that might want to use future v2, they have to apply for a license through the DAO and that is also voted on by the token holders. We also have a staking functionality for those that want to generate Yield on their PhDR so they can stake PhDR to earn more PhDR through the staking contract.
00:23:03.115 - 00:23:15.975, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome to hear that, man. I also have another question regarding partnerships. Do you guys have any pending partnerships that you guys might want to disclose here or something that you're working with?
00:23:19.555 - 00:24:10.791, Speaker B: You know, we definitely have some exciting partnerships coming up. There's nothing I can, you know, say concrete in terms of names just yet, but I will say that we have a really exciting engagement in the gaming on the gaming side, which would be, which would be to really create the first multi chain gaming index, the largest of its kind. There are a few other index that sort of look at gaming at the moment. This one is looking to be, you know, the largest. With all of the support from the major assets from Ronin, from the Ronin chain to all the other chains that are focused on gaming, this could be really big for us. I'm very excited about it. There's lots of discussions at the moment behind the scenes to just get everyone aligned, including the major brands that want to be a part of the index.
00:24:10.791 - 00:24:40.885, Speaker B: But from initial discussions with these brands, they're all very excited to be a part of it. And then we're also working on something on the Meme coin side, which I think it's an area that we've wanted to get into for a long time and we've just been trying to find the right people to work with in order to make that brand and that sort of index come to life. And there's something we're working on there as well. Two very exciting opportunities. But that's All I can say for now.
00:24:42.345 - 00:24:46.445, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. For sure that the Meme Coin index will attract a lot of people.
00:24:47.375 - 00:24:49.663, Speaker B: I think so. I really think so. Yeah.
00:24:49.839 - 00:25:09.755, Speaker A: Yeah. Now that we're talking about attracting a lot of people, I just want to touch a little bit on what is Future Finance plan to actually, what kind of incentives are you guys planning to do to increase user adoption? Do you guys have anything in mind?
00:25:11.775 - 00:25:56.239, Speaker B: You know, we, we have not. I mean, nothing immediate in mind. I mean, my view on this market at the moment is that, you know, you could drop incentives on it, but it still wouldn't help. Like it may be, you may, you know, we've done incentives in the past and maybe you get a small blip of activity, but then majority of that activity disappears, so you're really paying for fleeting activity. And I think, you know, that just that that's the vibe that I'm getting and the sentiment I'm getting from this current market. I think, you know, the retail portion of the market is really not participating in a lot of the defi stuff. I think they're mostly focused on the meme coin side of things.
00:25:56.239 - 00:26:52.679, Speaker B: And that's probably where, you know, some incentives will go, will go further. You know, things we've explored in the past is like, we call them like index wars. You know, where we're, where we have like index one, like say one DeFi index versus our DeFi index and we have like a competition to see who can outperform each other over like a 30 day period. And you know, there's prizes for getting the, you know, sort of like a binary option, getting the, getting the direction right or getting which index outperforms correct. But, you know, nothing that we've, nothing that we're actively planning at the moment. We just don't think that, you know, incentives will produce a sort of long lasting positive result. We're more focused on working with the right partners that have really good brands, that have really big communities, that have good distribution channels.
00:26:52.679 - 00:26:56.115, Speaker B: I think that for us is much more important than the incentives.
00:26:59.135 - 00:27:15.105, Speaker A: Awesome, man, awesome. Now that we're coming to the end of the space, there's just one question that I want to do. Like, how can users get involved with Future Finance? Where can they learn more about you guys? Yeah. Any final remarks that you want to give to the audience?
00:27:16.125 - 00:27:53.107, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a few places. So the first is our website, Future Finance. You'll see all of our products there. Each of our products have an FAQ section. They have a methodology, they have all the information there that you can see of how they run, which assets they hold, etc. If you'd like to get involved with our community within the future dao, then come and join our discord and we have discussion in there about what sort of future products we should launch, what should we do with existing products, what trends do we find, exciting things like that. And then I would also encourage people to check out our docs.
00:27:53.107 - 00:28:03.655, Speaker B: Docs Future Finance. This is again more of an in depth overview of Future, the Future v2 Protocol and the products that we have as well.
00:28:05.195 - 00:28:16.335, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. This sounds awesome. I'm really excited to hear your talk, man, because you look really excited about the technology and everything and that's the kind of people that we need building in this space.
00:28:17.315 - 00:28:56.673, Speaker B: Yeah, we're trying to push the envelope forward and launch some cool stuff. I think for us, indexes have been. We think it's a no brainer that eventually indexes will be a huge part of everyone's crypto portfolios. But you know, for the, for the, at least the, you know, the beginning. I've been in crypto since 2016 and since that time it's mostly been trailblazers, right. People that want to do that, do the research on their own, who want to, you know, invest into, no diversification, investing into projects that they believe in and things like that. And I totally get that for people who are like really involved in the space.
00:28:56.673 - 00:29:51.941, Speaker B: But I think as crypto matures and more and more people enter it, there's a lot of people that don't want to do that level of research or find that when they do that level of research they actually end up underperforming the market. You know, as it's. Sometimes people make a lot of money on the way up, but you know, they forget to sell and then the market comes down, they think, oh, you know what, if I just bought an index, I probably would have outperformed my current performance. And I think that is a trend that we're going to see continue. And in the meantime, you know, our goal as a business is to find demand where it currently sits. You know, whether that's in actively managed AI driven products, whether that's in yield managed products, you know, things that invest into, you know, various lending protocols and fixed rate interest protocols, etc. Or whether that's, you know, meme coins where we know there's a lot of demand.
00:29:51.941 - 00:30:03.465, Speaker B: So that's kind of, you know, our, our thoughts on the current landscape. You know, indexes are definitely going to be huge. But in order to have a successful business, you've got to be where the demand is right now.
00:30:04.805 - 00:30:26.875, Speaker A: Definitely. Ben, totally agree. And I really think that we are going to start seeing a lot more index because it allows you to have more exposure to more projects and still have more safety. Right? Yeah. Sounds awesome. And Sounds awesome. Oliver, it was great hosting you today.
00:30:26.875 - 00:30:30.367, Speaker A: Any final remarks you want to say before I close up the space?
00:30:30.551 - 00:30:52.355, Speaker B: I just want to say thanks a lot Staking Circle for having us on. Really love what you guys are doing. I'm actively following and we're actively following you on Twitter and seeing the different events that you're putting on. I think it's an excellent community to be a part of and very glad that we were able to get on this space today and have a discussion.
