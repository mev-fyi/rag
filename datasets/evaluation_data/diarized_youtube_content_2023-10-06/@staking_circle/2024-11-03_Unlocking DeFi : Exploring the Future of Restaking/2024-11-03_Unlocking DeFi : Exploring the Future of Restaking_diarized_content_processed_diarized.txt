00:00:00.280 - 00:00:53.615, Speaker A: And I think that restaking is a way forward for us to kind of form new capital structures and underwrite a lot of the risks and a lot of the centralization points that we still have in decentralized financial systems. And I'm very excited with yieldness to bring out our new metaphor that are going to go live soon that will basically rebalance around all the different, like restaking protocols to kind of, kind of absorb all the highest yields and also rebalance into DEFI protocols directly itself. So I'm very bullish on defi with all the new innovation, with Intense and all the other things that I see. So I'm very bullish on it. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of DEFI very soon. And, yeah, complete, decent, completely decentralized financial structures are, I think, very important for the world. So I'm very passionate and working hard with everybody here to make that into a reality.
