00:00:00.280 - 00:00:33.617, Speaker A: Because at the end of the day, it's all about settlement guarantees. We kind of want to trade risks with one another, and that's what restake platforms do. We kind of use assets to restake them, to kind of trade risks with one another and earn a yield with that. And if you then restake on eth, you just settle back to the core Ethereum layer. If you restake on Bitcoin, I don't see how it settles back to the core Ethereum, how it settles to the core Bitcoin layer. I just don't. I've been looking to that in the code, how that works, but has not been able to find it.
00:00:33.617 - 00:00:37.545, Speaker A: And if somebody can point that to me, I would love to research that and to understand that better.
