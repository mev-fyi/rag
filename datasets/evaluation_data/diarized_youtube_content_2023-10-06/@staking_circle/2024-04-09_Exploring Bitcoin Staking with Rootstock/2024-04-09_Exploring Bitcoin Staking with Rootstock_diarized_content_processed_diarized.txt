00:00:02.760 - 00:00:26.725, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Welcome to Staking Circle Twitter spaces with Rootstock exploring Bitcoin staking. How are you guys? So, first of all, I have a do apologies to give to everyone. Twitter was not allowing me to start the space and to be honest, I'm quite scared if this will work or not. So before we kick start, Sam, can I hear your voice at least?
00:00:27.645 - 00:00:30.781, Speaker B: Hello, hello. Yes, I can hear you loud and clear.
00:00:30.933 - 00:00:45.785, Speaker A: Nice, nice. I was so, like, so sure that once I asked you to speak, I wouldn't hear you. I'm glad I can hear you, mate. From your team, I saw Ricardo also requested earlier and Rootstock. Should I give them the microphone as well?
00:00:46.245 - 00:00:48.505, Speaker B: Yeah, why not? Let's bring the Rootstock.
00:00:49.725 - 00:01:19.285, Speaker A: I'm giving them sending you guys the invite to speak. So join when you see the invite, it should pop up on the left corner of your Twitter space ui. So I'm sending you again just to check if you are not receiving these. Probably some issues with Twitter. Nothing we can do to solve them. And we will start the space.
00:01:20.425 - 00:01:23.689, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds good. We can always kick things off and then if we can do it.
00:01:23.737 - 00:01:32.825, Speaker A: Yeah, let's kick it off. So, guys, first of all, welcome. Thank you for being here. It's lovely that. Oh, Ricardo is here. Hey, Ricardo, can I hear you?
00:01:33.805 - 00:01:35.141, Speaker B: Hello, can you hear me?
00:01:35.253 - 00:01:39.865, Speaker A: Yeah, loud and clear. Thank you very much. And who do we have behind the brand Rootstock?
00:01:41.205 - 00:01:45.065, Speaker B: I believe it's Marco. Right? Marco is our community manager.
00:01:46.245 - 00:01:54.525, Speaker A: It's me, it's Bachi. Hi. The social media manager. Hello. Hello. Welcome, guys. So now we have the Wolf back here.
00:01:54.525 - 00:02:03.945, Speaker A: Thank you very much for coming, guys. I would like to kickstart with the simplest of questions. Can you introduce. Who can move over? You can introduce Rootstock to the audience.
00:02:04.645 - 00:02:40.057, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I will kick things off. So Rootstock is the largest and longest running bitcoin side chain, often referred to as a Bitcoin L2. We are a separate blockchain, cryptographically connected to the bitcoin main chain through a process known as merge mining. So we use proof of work consensus, leveraging about 60% of the hashing power of the main bitcoin network. So that makes us the most secure, smart contract platform in the world. And what that means is 60% of all of the hashing power of bitcoin.
00:02:40.057 - 00:03:16.135, Speaker B: So all of the bitcoin miners are simultaneously merge mining Rootstock, which is what creates the security of the Rootstock network. What's really exciting about Rootstock as a network is we've got the connection to Bitcoin, but also it's EVM compatible. So anyone can deploy Dapps on top of bitcoin using Rootstock in the same way you'd build on Ethereum or any of the other Ethereum L2s, which is really exciting. We're seeing more EVM builders and solidity developers moving their protocols from other chains and launching them on top of Bitcoin using Rootstock, which is really, really cool to see.
00:03:17.005 - 00:03:18.101, Speaker A: That's really.
00:03:18.253 - 00:03:50.125, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just going to say, yeah. The white paper was first published back in 2015 and Rootstock launched on Mainnet in 2018. So that's over 2, 000 days, Mainnet 100 uptime since then, which is super exciting. We're publishing a merge mining report which looks at where all that hashing power is coming from in the coming days and over Q1. So January, February and March of this year, we've had about 62% of the hash power of bitcoin has been securing the network, which is really cool.
00:03:50.585 - 00:04:21.101, Speaker A: It's huge numbers, I have to say. I didn't know they were so high. Congrats, guys, on that. So I do have a couple questions for you and one of the questions I would like to kick start is how do you guys leverage your sidechain's architecture to facilitate the bitcoin staking? Because you want a proof of work network I've read about you guys about, with some relation to the staking. How does it work? Can you explain me? Can you correct me if I'm wrong? It's easier, lightweight.
00:04:21.213 - 00:04:58.519, Speaker B: So yeah, go ahead, please, for sure, yeah. So, hoping. It always goes without saying, but this is just educational content, not financial advice. So the really exciting thing about Rootstock is bitcoin is used for gas on the network. So using Bridge, a trustless bridge from the bitcoin main chain, you can move your bitcoin into Rootstock where it turns. It takes the form of rbtc, what we sometimes call smart Bitcoin. Once you've got your bitcoin in Rootstock, you can then put it to work in a number of different protocols and apps live on the network, including a number of different staking protocols.
00:04:58.519 - 00:05:40.255, Speaker B: And an example I can give you today is Sovereign. A lot of people on the call have probably heard of Sovereign. It's the largest defi protocol in the world today, I believe, and it's built on top of Rootstock. They offer a number of different staking opportunities, whether that's staking Bitcoin on top of Rootstock or any of the Other tokens that are live on top of the rootstock network as well. They also have some really interesting yield products as well as 0% bitcoin backed loans. So you can get a loan across from your Bitcoin with 0% interest, which is super interesting. So you don't have to sell and you can access that capital and then use it on other protocols on the network as well.
00:05:40.675 - 00:06:15.561, Speaker A: So that's like the defi moves you can do with bitcoin. I would just like to clarify and simplify. Correct me if I'm wrong all the time. You can correct me. So you guys are a proof of work network that basically since you are EVM compatible, you allow the staking ecosystem to also work on top of your network. So for instance, to sustain any protocol that is built on top of your network, which is a proof of work connected to the bitcoin mining ecosystem itself, users can stake to sustain other protocols or to enter in any other defi endeavor. Am I correct? Am I incorrect?
00:06:15.673 - 00:06:53.405, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. Exactly. Yeah. So you can move your bitcoin into rootstock and then interact with a number of different protocols, sovereign being one example, and earn yield against your Bitcoin as well as participating in liquidity pools through things like oku. One thing that's really interesting and exciting is Uniswap. The first and only bitcoin connected network that is supported by Uniswap and recently passed a governance vote is Rootstock. So that means using some of the front ends like oku, you can deploy your bitcoin into liquidity pools and earn yield on that bitcoin, which is super exciting.
00:06:53.775 - 00:07:16.915, Speaker A: That's amazing. What are like the. I ask you this because I think this is the bull that is marked by a lot of protocols trying to bring defi on top of Bitcoin and bringing these L2 type of ideas to Bitcoin. What is your key unique selling point that differentiates you from all of these new solutions? Besides the fact that you are alive for over 2,000 days already?
00:07:17.615 - 00:08:10.697, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's definitely one. Having that first mover advantage is always a good thing. Yeah, I think the deep cryptographic connection with bitcoin, the fact we have the support of the mining pools actually providing that security to rootstock is really exciting and something that you couldn't just replicate overnight. That has been years in the making. And the reason that those bitcoin miners choose to secure rootstock through merge mining is they earn the fees from the rootstock network for doing so. One thing that we also believe at Rootstock Labs and many of the contributors to Rootstock as well, is that bitcoin is fundamental to the kind of future of humanity and we should be working to contribute to the security budget of bitcoin and extend the value of bitcoin as well. And that's something that rootstock does.
00:08:10.697 - 00:09:11.785, Speaker B: Not only does it add the functionality on top of bitcoin by allowing people to build apps, but it also all of the fees go back to the bitcoin miners. So transaction fees on rootstock reward bitcoin miners as well, which obviously incentivizes them to mine bitcoin. And with the upcoming halving, this becomes even more important because as fees on the main chain for miners get cut in half, they can access additional revenue by merge mining Rootstock as well. So I think that's the kind of cryptographic connection, the philosophical connection to bitcoin and the economic connection to bitcoin all really important for me. And that's why there isn't a competing money token on Rootstock. Some other networks that claim to be sidechains or L2s to Bitcoin, gas is paid in a competing token to bitcoin. And one of the things that we see is really important in Rootstock is that bitcoin is king and there isn't a competing money token.
00:09:11.785 - 00:09:40.285, Speaker B: So gas is paid in bitcoin. You only need bitcoin to use the network. You can interact with all of the different apps on top of Rootstock only using bitcoin. But there is also the opportunity to access NFTs, launch your own tokens that leverage the security of bitcoin, whatever you might want to do. But at the core of it, bitcoin is the kind of the gas fee token for the network, which we think is really important and makes us kind of stand out compared to some of the others.
00:09:41.035 - 00:09:48.215, Speaker A: That's amazing. And leveraging what you said, how can users bridge their bitcoin to a rootstock?
00:09:50.435 - 00:10:58.587, Speaker B: Yes, there's an increasing amount of ways that people can move bitcoin from the main chain into rootstock. The most kind of like trustless and decentralized is the two way peg. This continues to evolve from the day it started off as quite a simple federated model, similar to another sidechain liquid, where a number of different federation members control a multisig and you're essentially moving your bitcoin into that multisig and it gets locked in the multisig and then gets unlocked on the rootstock chain over time. So about three years ago, extra Layers of security and defense were added on top of that original federation to remove the trust and remove the risk from you moving your bitcoin and lock it in, locking it into, into a different network. So now each of the different federation members has a hardware security module. This is essentially a modified hardware wallet that is running firmware which is publicly attestable online. This firmware means that even the people holding the multisig private keys don't have access to that private key.
00:10:58.587 - 00:11:47.825, Speaker B: It's encrypted within this hardware security module. And these hardware security modules are dotted around the world. There's actually a proposal at the moment to increase that number of kind of multisigs that are supporting the network from nine today to over 66 by now, allowing SegWit enabled multisigs. So that's one of the ways you can do it. You move your bitcoin through a process called the PAL peg, the proof of work peg, which uses multiple different layers of security to make sure that your bitcoin is safe locked in that peg. There's over 3,000 bitcoins locked into that peg today, as I mentioned, 100% uptime on the network since launch in 2018 and no breaches. It's essentially a giant bounty for anyone who thinks that they can breach the security of the bitcoin network, which we all know will never happen.
00:11:47.825 - 00:12:28.935, Speaker B: So it's really exciting to see that. And that's the most trustless way to move your bitcoin from the main chain into Rootstock to interact with adapts. But there's also many other ways as well. So you could use an exchange to access RBTC on Rootstock immediately. Someone like Buenbit, Mount Pelerin, Decrypto, you could use. Some of the apps launched on top of Rootstock offer different bridging mechanisms. So Money on Chain, which is a bitcoin collateralized stablecoin, you can go to their app, use a wallet like Metamask and basically send bitcoin through the app and receive RBTC in return.
00:12:28.935 - 00:13:14.815, Speaker B: You can also bridge from many other networks using Symbiosis, which is a cross chain aggregator or OKU or many other different sites. And I think there's probably someone who's on the call can probably pin to the top a guide on how people can get RBTC and start interacting with these dapps. There's lots of different ways, that's just a few that kind of come to mind today. You could also go to an exchange like Binance Access, a token built on top of Rootstock like the Rootstock infrastructure framework, RIF token and then you could swap that token for RBTC using an exchange like Mount Pelerin or someone like sovereign or money on chain as well. Hopefully it answers the question.
00:13:15.435 - 00:13:35.199, Speaker A: It does, it does answer. I was trying to find the post you were talking about. I think I found it a step by step guide on basically. Oh, this opens the wall thread. Sorry guys. But yeah, this is the step by step guide on how we explore to access rootstock tokens through this cyclo non custodial wallet. I think this is only a matter.
00:13:35.199 - 00:13:55.615, Speaker A: There will be more different ways to to bridge the tokens to your to rootstock. Okay, and what is RBTC and what is its function? Is it just the representation of a bitcoin in rootstock network or does it have meaning within Rootstock?
00:13:56.355 - 00:14:08.123, Speaker B: That's correct. It is the form of bitcoin on the rootstock network. So RBTC is bitcoin essentially. Once it exists inside Rootstock it's a.
00:14:08.139 - 00:14:15.019, Speaker A: One to one pair with what the users lock on the other side of the proof of work bridge you were talking about. Right?
00:14:15.107 - 00:14:24.285, Speaker B: That's exactly correct. Yeah. So as you move it over, it's always one to one pegs with bitcoin and you can move it back through that bridge at any time and receive the same amount of bitcoin back.
00:14:24.435 - 00:14:38.721, Speaker A: And do you only have like. I do know like there's a huge market for wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum and any other chain. Do you also breach from other chains or users do always need to go to bitcoin to breach to rootstock?
00:14:38.873 - 00:15:13.079, Speaker B: No, you can, you can go from other chains. So you could use oku, which is a uniswap front end to swap other tokens for rbtc. Symbiosis is cross chain aggregation app as well that recently integrated Rootstock that supports around I think over 20 of the main chains. So any token that they support you can basically then swap through for RBTC on Rootstock as well. And there is also some of the Rootstock core contributors built a rootstock token bridge which allows you to bridge from Ethereum over to Rootstock as well.
00:15:13.247 - 00:15:52.685, Speaker A: Okay, I think that's a pretty complete answer guys. So from the audience, anyone has a question? Sorry to make this remark. Here is from the audience, anyone has a question? I do have plenty of questions for these guys, so drop your comments on the bottom right corner of your phone you have a chat button. You can type your questions and I'll read them if they are interesting enough to be read to be read, of course. And I have a final question. So, since we are staking circle, we do care a lot, a lot about staking rewards and APY and APR of the users. What are the potential returns that you see right now on staking Bitcoin with Rootstock?
00:15:53.265 - 00:16:07.753, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. Yeah. So I was taking a look yesterday at staking on Sovereign. We talked about this previously. There is. Let me bring this up for you right now. Yesterday I had a look.
00:16:07.753 - 00:16:45.835, Speaker B: There's different opportunities to stake whether you're staking Bitcoin or if you're staking any of the other tokens launched on top of rootstock. The APYs range from around a kind of modest 5% up to 22% yesterday for staking a mix of Bitcoin and the sovereign dollar, which is a bitcoin collateralized stablecoin launched on top of Rootstock. So you basically stake one to one sovereign dollar and Bitcoin and earn that interest through the sovereign dap. That's one of the ones that comes to mind. There's quite a few other different protocols out there which would have different APYs as well.
00:16:46.455 - 00:17:07.355, Speaker A: Okay, that's really pretty good. So from the audience, of course, again, this is not financial advice, but there are, of course, highlights that we can give here in terms of protocols building on top of Rootstock that you can get leveraged to get some APR on your Bitcoin. How do you guys basically contribute to a freer, fairer, and more decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem?
00:17:08.595 - 00:18:17.605, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. So actually, Rootstock Labs, which is the organization I work for and one of the key contributors to the Rootstock network, our CEO was speaking on stage today at Paris Blockchain Week around this kind of topic. And really it goes back to the origins of rootstock back in 2013 in Argentina. And the creators of the network back then were experiencing a devaluing currency, capital controls, a lot of economic turmoil in their country. And they'd already seen Bitcoin as this way to kind of take control of their sovereignty and take control of their capital and protect it from inflation and devaluation. And at the same time that they were looking at Bitcoin as this tool for economic freedom, they also discovered Ethereum and the programmability that allowed in a decentralized way. And that's what really gave birth to the vision of Rootstock, the idea of combining the security and the store of value of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum.
00:18:17.605 - 00:19:20.589, Speaker B: So when we talk at Rootstock Labs a lot around Our vision for the future, we talk about making Bitcoin work for everyone. And this idea that bitcoin on the base layer, especially as interest grows, value locked in, the main chain grows, transaction volume increases. We all know about the kind of classic blockchain trilemma. And as we see that kind of the security and decentralization of Bitcoin main chain means that scalability is one of the big challenges for the network. And as well as scalability, Bitcoin at its core doesn't have the same level of programmability as other networks. And so that's what Rootstock really sets out to solve. It allows Bitcoin to become not just a store of value, but a fully fledged decentralized financial system with all the programmability and all of the different kind of functionality, whether that's lending, saving, borrowing payments that you see on other networks.
00:19:20.589 - 00:20:20.115, Speaker B: So we have this really strong belief that Bitcoin will become critical infrastructure in the kind of financial economies of the future. But the only way that Bitcoin can reach that civilization scale appeal is with L2s and sidechains like Rootstock on top of it. And it all goes back to that idea of individuals having economic freedom, control of their own capital, protection from others, taking it away, a choice of how they spend it, where they spend it, how they send it, how they earn money, and what they do to earn earn money as well. So we talk a lot about economic freedom and we also talk a lot about everyday defi. So I know the audience today. A lot of you are probably very advanced Defi users. We believe the real next chasm to cross for Defi is to move to a world where everyone can interact with it, where it really reaches that kind of mass market appeal.
00:20:20.115 - 00:21:04.485, Speaker B: And that comes from improving usability and simplifying. And that's something that Rootstock Labs is really focused on. As we contribute to the growth of Rootstock and we help support other protocols as well, is making sure that everything we're doing it reaches a scale where defi isn't just for the select few, but everybody has the opportunity to interact with it, to protect their savings from inflation, to be able to send currency around the world without limitations or high fees. These are the things that we think are really important. To give everyone equal access to financial inclusion and financial tools that some of us might take for granted, but in some parts of the world aren't available to most people.
00:21:05.705 - 00:21:33.935, Speaker A: That's really good. And even though some of us can take it for granted, there's always a centralized problem that can come into, into play. No matter how wealthy you are, that's always a risk. So with bitcoin, you don't have that risk. And once again, guys, not financial advice, just commenting on facts. So how, what are the biggest challenges that you face in promotion, in the promotion of a wider adoption of bitcoin?
00:21:37.275 - 00:22:27.915, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. Can you guys hear me? The microphone? Yeah, it's a really good question. I think that there's like until maybe 12 months ago, the market for defi and bitcoin was really small. Rootstock and a few other players were the only people in there. The recent kind of approvals of Bitcoin ETFs and the launch of things like ordinals and BRC20 tokens has brought a load more excitement back to, to the bitcoin ecosystem. I think there was almost this kind of view that bitcoin was the kind of old guy on the block and Ethereum was the new kid and everyone wanted to be a part of those ecosystems. But now people are seeing that bitcoin isn't just a store of value and has all of these other opportunities built on top of it.
00:22:27.915 - 00:23:05.571, Speaker B: I think that was one of the biggest challenges is the perception of bitcoin. The perception that bitcoin is, is only a store of value and can't be anything more meant that people were less interested in investigating defi opportunities on top of it. That's really changed. I think ordinals played a big role in that. BLC20, the ETFs we talked about have brought the spotlight back to bitcoin as well. And also I talked briefly about Argentina. There's also other nation states in the world that have looked to bitcoin as a kind of foundation for a new financial system.
00:23:05.571 - 00:23:48.457, Speaker B: I think El Salvador is a classic example, but also in Argentina. Now Argentina have accepted bitcoin as a legal tender, as something that can be used to pay for different services. So a lot of these things is kind of changing the perception of bitcoin. But that's been the typical challenge, is people not understanding that you can do more and you can build on top of bitcoin. And the work of the contributors to Rootstock over the Last kind of 5, 6 years has started to change that. But there's still a lot of work to do. The bitcoin defi ecosystem, the size of it pales in comparison to the defi activity happening on Ethereum.
00:23:48.457 - 00:24:02.005, Speaker B: But that being said, there's trillions of dollars locked inside bitcoin that people could be putting to work on side chains like Rootstock. And that's where we think the big opportunity is and what we'll see happening over the next few years.
00:24:02.905 - 00:24:31.865, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you very much. And as we step, basically we enter the final minutes of our repeater space, I would like to invite everyone on the audience to follow Sam. He's an amazing speaker and he has been blowing my mind off with some of his explanations. So thank you very much, Sam, and thank you very much, Rootstock, Marco and Ricardo to be here. Don't, don't forget to follow all these guys and follow sticking circle as well. So, entering here, the final steps of our call.
00:24:31.865 - 00:24:38.785, Speaker A: What is the future roadmap for Rootstock development and how basically, what do you have coming up?
00:24:39.525 - 00:25:34.017, Speaker B: Yeah, really good question. I think this is a really good opportunity, especially if there's any solidity developers or entrepreneurs in the audience. Today, Rootstock Labs is committing $5 million over the next year for grants to anyone looking to build on top of Bitcoin using Rootstock. There's lots more information about this on the Roots Rootstock Labs website, but essentially there are grants ranging from $25,000 up for you to build a business or a protocol or a service on top of Bitcoin using Rootstock. So that's one big opportunity for anyone who's, who's looking to start building on Bitcoin today in terms of the roadmap for rootstock in 2024. Loads of exciting announcements coming up. I think one thing I'd say to everyone is keep your eyes out on the stage of Bitcoin in Austin this year, as well as Bitcoin Nashville later in the year for some big announcements from some of the core contributors.
00:25:34.017 - 00:26:11.157, Speaker B: The really cool thing about Rootstock is as a decentralized network, the contributions are coming from the community. They're referred to as RSK IPs in the same way you have BIPS on Bitcoin. And those proposals cover a whole different wide range of things. Some of the ones that I'm really excited about is a proposal to reduce block time from 30 seconds to 5 seconds. So faster block time on Rootstock. There is proposals to introduce Lightning network swaps. So swapping LBTC on Lightning straight to RBTC on Rootstock.
00:26:11.157 - 00:27:04.413, Speaker B: There's proposals to bring ordinals from bitcoin main chain into Rootstock as well. So these are all things that are actively being discussed and worked on by the community right now. There's also been a big wave of new protocols, especially EVM protocols, integrating Rootstock as a way to build a bridge to bitcoin. Expect to see a lot more of that in the coming months as well, especially in terms of staking Dexs bridges aggregators. Lots of interesting projects getting in touch about integrating Rootstock and supporting Bitcoin in that way. So I think keep your eyes on the Discord channel and make sure you follow the Rootstock Twitter account so you can kind of find out more about what's happening there. And then, I guess, like a final thing to mention here, I talked about the bitcoin bridge that connects rootstock and bitcoin main chain.
00:27:04.413 - 00:27:50.975, Speaker B: There is a research project at the moment investigating bitvm. A lot of you may have already heard about bitvm to create an entirely permissionless bitcoin bridge connecting rootstock and bitcoin. This is something that's never been achieved before. And it's something that until Robin Linus kind of published the bitvm white paper in October last year, people didn't even know would ever be possible. We're reaching a reality where that will become possible. And Rootstock Labs and a number of other contributors to Rootstock have formed a bit of a super squad investigating a way to use BitVM, evolve BitVM and implement it in a way to create a trustless bridge between bitcoin and rootstock main chain. So loads of exciting stuff happening at the moment.
00:27:50.975 - 00:28:09.667, Speaker B: Whether you're a user or a developer or just interested in hearing more about the frontiers of decentralized technology, I think it's worth following the Rootstock account and keeping an eye on what's going to be happening over the next few months and years as well. And thanks a lot for having us today, by the way. I've really enjoyed this.
00:28:09.851 - 00:28:31.443, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So guys, there's really a lot I was trying to track down everything. One thing that I would like to highlight. Ricardo did us a great favor and drop the grants link here on the comments. So if you close the space, when you close the space. If you are really looking to get a grant from the Rootstock team, please check the comments below and you will find all of them. I see that we have.
00:28:31.443 - 00:28:52.425, Speaker A: And also Marco just shared the Discord link. So guys, please don't forget to join. I do think that what Rootstock is building, it's very interesting and quite important to our ecosystem at the King Circle. We do believe the same. That's why we wanted to invite you guys. Thank you very much for coming. For anyone in the audience, if you have any questions, please visit Rootstock Discord.
00:28:52.425 - 00:29:40.725, Speaker A: Don't forget to leave a follow to Staking Circle as well. We will be coming back next week with more Twitter spaces and we will also be featuring now on events and apologies guys let me just do the remarks.
