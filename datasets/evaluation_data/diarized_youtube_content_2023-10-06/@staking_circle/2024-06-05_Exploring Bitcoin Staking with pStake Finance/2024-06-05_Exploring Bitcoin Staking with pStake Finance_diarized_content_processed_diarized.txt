00:00:02.200 - 00:00:17.885, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello everyone. Welcome to staking Circle spaces once again and this time exploring bitcoin staking with P Stake Finance. How are you guys? Everything all right? Can I have a quick mic check before we do kickstart this place?
00:00:18.865 - 00:00:21.809, Speaker B: Hey, hey everyone, can you hear me?
00:00:21.937 - 00:00:25.375, Speaker A: Yeah, loud and clear. Mikkel, how are you, man? Everything all right?
00:00:25.545 - 00:00:35.455, Speaker B: Good, good, all good. Very pumped, very excited. It's a good last few weeks. You know, we've been going at it. So really enjoyable.
00:00:36.195 - 00:01:16.819, Speaker A: Nice, nice, nice. Pleasure and happy to hear that. So man, I hope you're ready for this quick space that we have ahead of us. We have basically we host these spaces on a weekly manner and we do invite all protocols that are related to staking, defi and whatsoever that basically can connect to our community. Our goal here is to bring some value to our community and of course introduce you guys to what we have been doing and developing all together. So this place is getting rich and by reach, I say the space is getting a lot of activity and there's a lot of new things around. There's a special reason why we bring you here today.
00:01:16.819 - 00:01:35.157, Speaker A: We want to hear a little bit more on your bitcoin staking. But let's kick start from the ground up. I want to hear a little bit about yourself. Who are you? Who is the. What you are doing in the company? And yeah, basically who are you, man? Introduce yourself, man.
00:01:35.181 - 00:02:02.801, Speaker B: I'm just a normal human being who's passionate about defi bitcoin staking, yields and passionate about the space. So I started out in 2019 in the space officially and co founded Peace Take with Tushar, who's my co founder. Founder. I'm actually with him in Singapore right now. We've been going at it with the bitcoin staking thing. Started off with yields within Cosmos staking. So we were very big on staking back in the day.
00:02:02.801 - 00:02:34.589, Speaker B: Like I. I'm an engineer by background, so I got very excited about smart contracts. I was not very excited about bitcoin. Actually the first token I bought was eth, which is very surprising because in today's context I'm in love with bitcoin and what it stands for. So for me, like the programmability of smart contracts and money was super exciting. And I was like, okay, I really want to look into the space deeply. So I graduated from university in 2019 in India and started looking at crypto very deeply.
00:02:34.589 - 00:03:03.455, Speaker B: On the tech side, met Tushar, who was more on the business side. I brought in some tech capabilities. I was Never a great dev, but obviously I love product, product design, mechanism design and you know, got excited by the Cosmos tech stack, which was very unique compared to what everybody was talking about because staking was such a new thing. So 2019 staking was not a big deal. Nobody cared about staking. But you know, Tushar, he's like super big on cash flow. His whole life he's thinking about cash flows.
00:03:03.455 - 00:03:28.045, Speaker B: For me, the idea of staking was the tech element was so exciting. So he came in with the idea that okay, staking brings cash flows. And I understood that staking is such a unique tech play. So that's kind of how I got excited about staking. In 2019, we worked on liquid staking in Cosmos. We are the first Atom liquid staking protocol. Back in 2020 when we started building, we launched in early 21.
00:03:28.045 - 00:04:12.121, Speaker B: This is before IBC was live, before osmosis, before Cosmos had anything. So very early into the Cosmos ecosystem. And Cosmos aligns a lot with the bitcoin ecosystem and ethos. So kind of like pivoted towards bitcoin a lot more over time. And considering the world that we live in, which is pretty scary with so many wars happening, so many, you know, the monetary system of the world failing so many people today, it kind of makes just a lot of sense to look at Bitcoin. So from that perspective, got very excited about bitcoin. Have been, you know, on a, on a spree where I've been rotating all my assets into bitcoin over time and kind of where I am at personally, where I think obviously for me, bitcoin is what I believe in.
00:04:12.121 - 00:05:01.905, Speaker B: And what I've realized over time is I like building things over long periods of time. I'm a commitment guy, I like to commit. I don't do things half assed. So for me it was like, okay, we've been doing liquid staking in Cosmos for such a long time, but does it make sense? Is it something that you can build for a very long period of time? Also because Cosmos has failed to get that attention, that traction those users and at some point it may just get those users and traction, but we have an expertise within the Cosmos ecosystem. How can we combine that and build for something that can last for decades, that's where bitcoin yields come into play. And bitcoin staking, because staking is such a big part of what we've been doing for five years, eels is a big part of what we've been doing. And bitcoin is the biggest part of this ecosystem of this economy.
00:05:02.845 - 00:05:05.793, Speaker A: It just makes sense to join them all together, right?
00:05:05.849 - 00:05:08.017, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:08.161 - 00:05:34.553, Speaker A: Amazing intro. Thank you very much. So I know you guys have been in the the market for quite some time, to be honest. When I first started to explore defi or basically trying to experiment things, I did explore Cosmos as well. And I did think, I do think I did stick with you guys earlier. So pretty good experience. Everything that I have done on Cosmos was pretty amazing from my experience at least.
00:05:34.553 - 00:06:28.545, Speaker A: So huge shout out to you guys, man. Without further ado, let's enter into the questions I have here prepared for you. So the first thing I wanted to ask you to explain to the audience. So we did get this question from some of our users. So we do have events worldwide as taking circle and we are already in touch with some people that basically asked us, yeah, what's happening on bitcoin? Why out of nowhere users can stake bitcoin? Can you explain us this new trend of defi on bitcoin and how are these L2 solutions bringing bitcoin staking and yeah, of course, if you want to point out any limitation, please go ahead. But can you just at least break this initial rock that we know that some users have?
00:06:29.255 - 00:06:47.751, Speaker B: Absolutely, man. I think that's a very good question and a very good place to begin with, I would say. So. Bitcoin. For the longest time, nobody thought you could build anything on Bitcoin. Bitcoin OGs were so skeptical of anybody who wanted to build on bitcoin. I think there were like a handful of teams trying to build anything meaningful on bitcoin.
00:06:47.751 - 00:07:17.843, Speaker B: There's stacks that was trying to build an L2 back then as well. But what recently has happened over the last couple of years with Taproot and all the different upgrades that have come to bitcoin on the network itself is people have started experimenting with things like ordinals came out, runes came out. These were small, small things that you could do. Now. Ordinals saw a lot of traction early on, but immediately the traction died off. So people were like, okay, maybe this was just something that lasted for a short while. It's not going to sustain.
00:07:17.843 - 00:07:45.651, Speaker B: Then comes runes. Runes did very well. People start seeing these different small, small things as signs of something big happening in the bitcoin ecosystem. But what really changed the perception of bitcoin as a network was the fact that people started looking at BTC as an active asset. People started thinking of using BTC for more things. And that's kind of where you see BTC L2s come in obviously BTC L2s today are just sidechains. They are not layer 2s in its truest form.
00:07:45.651 - 00:08:29.033, Speaker B: So layer 2 actually settle transactions on the main network, but that does not happen. So if you have a L2 on Ethereum, it actually settles transactions on the, you know, it actually settles transactions on the Ethereum network. But that does not happen with Bitcoin today. Because Bitcoin chains, L2s are just sidechains that just run independently of the bitcoin network. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin network, to be very honest, except the fact that they bridge their assets from the bitcoin network to these L2s or sidechains. So in today's form, what exists with BTC defi is not that great, to be very honest, very frank. And that's why for me, that's not the most exciting part.
00:08:29.033 - 00:09:28.419, Speaker B: The most exciting part for me is the development of Bitcoin as an asset, which is from a very passive asset to an active asset, where people are starting to see, okay, so far, I was just holding BTC like we see BTC as two different values, right? We can say, oh, BTC is a store of value, or BTC is peer to peer cash, which is what, you know, Satoshi envisioned to be, right? That's the title of the white paper. We've seen BTC become a peer to peer cash, but also at the same time become a store of value. Now BTC is compared to gold, great, but gold you cannot do many things with, especially physical gold. The real gold that sits in your house for example, or your bank, you can't do much with it, the physical gold, right? But with BTC it's actually better than gold because you can store it yourself. Now you can do exciting things with it to generate yield. So BTC becomes a better form of gold, which people have talked about for years. But where does this BTC yield come from? That's where staking comes in so far, Bitcoin.
00:09:28.419 - 00:10:11.507, Speaker B: So bitcoin, the network itself is still proof of work. It has nothing to do with staking. BTC as an asset is not natively used for staking on the bitcoin network. But what can you do with btc? BTC is the biggest asset in this, in the space. It is literally one of the, you know, like if BTC dies today, nothing will exist in this ecosystem, to be honest. So what can you do with this trillion dollar asset class that is sitting there not providing any value to the rest of the ecosystem, which is worth half a billion or another, you know, sorry, half a trillion or another trillion. And that's where staking for bitcoin comes in, where you use the bitcoin, the economic value of the bitcoin to secure smaller chains that need economic security.
00:10:11.507 - 00:11:01.733, Speaker B: So economic security is this concept where to attack a network. Let's say you have built a chain, that chain has 100 million TVL but the FDV of the chain is $20 million and only half of the supply is staked. So that's $10 million worth of assets staked on the network that has 100 million in TVL, which means to attack this network you need less than $7 million worth of assets. So as an attacker I have to go in the market, acquire, you know, let's say acquire $10 million worth of assets and I can actually end up attacking this network to steal those hundred million dollar worth of assets. Now I'm taking arbitrary numbers if you want me to be very specific. I'll have to do some mental math here. But you know, it's slightly more than $10 million worth of assets that an attacker would need to acquire to attack the network and steal this hundred million dollar worth of assets.
00:11:01.733 - 00:11:47.433, Speaker B: How do you prevent that from happening? You prevent that from happening by staking bitcoin which has such high economic value. So you bring in, you know, 100 mil worth of Bitcoin and you stake it to secure this chain. Now all of a sudden to attack this chain is so much more difficult because there's, you know, you need to acquire like $120 million worth, 66% of $120 million worth of assets to steal this 100 million. So it doesn't make any sense for an attacker to actually try attacking this network. That's kind of what bitcoin staking is where you stake your bitcoin to secure different, different chains and earn some yields. Where do these yields comes from? These yield comes from different chains providing, you know, some. Basically if you do a service for me, I'm going to pay you for it.
00:11:47.433 - 00:12:20.083, Speaker B: Similar this, it's the same concept where if you bring your BTC to stake and secure my chain, I'm going to have, I'm going to have to pay you for it. I pay you in different forms, whether it's a revenue share or a portion of my inflation. And that's where cosmos chains come in. Because cosmos chains have emissions, inflations and revenues that are generated by transactions on chain. A portion of that gets shared with BTC stakers. So that's BTC Staking, that's where BTC defi is headed. So once you have BTC staking, you can do a lot more exciting things on top of it.
00:12:20.083 - 00:12:22.015, Speaker B: And I'm sure we'll discuss that here.
00:12:22.785 - 00:13:07.593, Speaker A: Yeah, I did, I apologize. I do want to disconstruct something which was a question that initially I do, I did have. So when you basically you are getting this yield out of bitcoin, you are not getting it. And this is more, as a clarification for our users, you won't be getting more Bitcoin on top of your Bitcoin. You will be earning the chains, tokens, or exactly as Mikil was explaining, you will be chaining the rewards generated from the chain itself that the you are securing through the staking on your wallet bank. Basically, you will receive those as rewards. Am I correct, Mikhail, or have I simplified it properly? Because many people, many people ask us, okay, so how can I be receiving a yield on Bitcoin? You are not receiving that yield on Bitcoin.
00:13:07.593 - 00:13:16.485, Speaker A: You are receiving correspondent yield to the stake of the bitcoin you made, but it will be on the chain's native token, correct?
00:13:17.295 - 00:13:18.599, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah.
00:13:18.767 - 00:13:32.635, Speaker A: Okay, man. So going down now to. Or diving a little deeper into how you are doing it. What are the underlying mechanisms here you are implementing to be able to. For the users to stake Bitcoin?
00:13:33.615 - 00:14:07.405, Speaker B: Yeah, so a very good question. I think even before we go into that, maybe taking a step back and understanding what happens with bitcoin staking. So Babylon has introduced this novel mechanism for bitcoin staking. Nobody has yet implemented this. What they do is you use your Bitcoin, you put it into Babylon, and Babylon is going to use the dollar value of the Bitcoin to secure other chains. You earn some yields. But when you stake your Bitcoin, you have the same problem that you have with native staking of POS assets.
00:14:07.405 - 00:14:40.643, Speaker B: If you stake your atom on the cosmos hub, it's 21 days unbonding period. So your atom gets locked up. Similarly with btc, when you stake it, you kind of end up locking your btc, which is not ideal because you know the market is volatile. You want to sell your tokens. If you, if you want to do something else with it, you can't do all of that. So the, all the problems that exist with staking kind of start appearing with BTC staking as well. Although it's great that now you finally have wheels on bitcoin, but it's not the best because it's going to end up Being locked up, that's where we come in.
00:14:40.643 - 00:15:22.781, Speaker B: We do BTC liquid staking again. Like I said, we've been doing liquid staking for a while now here. The only difference is P stake is the one that is accepting BTC deposits and then depositing it into Babylon on behalf of the users. Whatever yields come, we convert them into BTC again and we send that back to the users who are depositing bitcoin. So in a way, we do the depositing part. We do the, you know, consolidation of yields and return those yields to the users. But what we do on top of it is we issue a liquid stake token where if you deposit, you know, we're still debating what we want to call the liquid stake token, whether we want to call it SDK, BTC or ybtc.
00:15:22.781 - 00:15:58.275, Speaker B: Ybtc to keep it more broad and at a later stage, expand to, you know, other yield sources. Not just rely on staking as a yield source for this product, but essentially building a yield product where we issue a liquid token for every BTC that is deposited into P stake. And this liquid token can then be used in bitcoin DeFi on these BTC sidechains or any chain for that matter. It doesn't have to be Bitcoin L2s or sidechains. It can go into any chain, any Ethereum, Melvin, L2 Cosmos chains, wherever there is a possibility for users to use this. These, you know, why BTC tokens?
00:15:58.975 - 00:16:47.179, Speaker A: Nice. I think pretty much answered like, I had here like three or four questions prepared for you, and you pretty much answered all of them in your single statement. Thank you very much, man. It's clear that you are quite enthusiastic about this and I'm happy to hear this because it also gives us confidence that you are really happy with what you're doing and happy people usually deliver better products. That's my opinion. Can you now, like, allow me to understand, what are the risks? Like, even though we are working with a pretty consolidated company as you guys, there are always risks in terms of security. So users will have to lock their bitcoin in a bridge or smart contract that it's not on the bitcoin chain.
00:16:47.179 - 00:16:59.435, Speaker A: How will this work? Will you guys rep bitcoin before being able to stake it? So basically, how will you guys ensure the security of the stake Bitcoin and what are the risks and mitigations that you have in place?
00:17:00.255 - 00:18:16.929, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I think this is the biggest point that I would say we need to be mindful of because the bitcoin network itself is not so advanced today that you could have interesting smart contract logics or anything like that. In today's context, the way most BTC sidechains work, for example, is you have to bridge your assets to these sidechains. To do that, what most people use is essentially just NPCs or multi party competition wallets where you have three to five signers who sign transactions to bridge off their BTC from the Bitcoin network. So it's stored in this NPC wallet on the Bitcoin network and a wrapped version is issued on the other side on the L2 or sidechain. For us, how it's going to work is Babylon accepts BTC in a trustless manner. So again, Babylon has built this product where you don't actually have to give up custody of your btc, you still have custody of your btc, but that would lead to, you know, you facing the same issues that you face with native POS staking in order to solve for that.
00:18:16.929 - 00:19:10.599, Speaker B: In today's context, E Stake uses MPC where we have three different signers who are going to sign transactions on behalf of the users to deposit the BTC into Babylon and issue the YBTC token. What is interesting though is we're going to go down the path of using insurance and coverage for all of these assets. So whatever assets get put into the NPC wallet will be insured by certain third parties. And again, I can share more details about this maybe at a later stage once we have more concrete launch deadlines or launch timelines. But for now I would say the security assumptions that every Bitcoin sidechain has is that of an MPC or a custodian. Everybody uses custodians in today's context. We have Kobo, we have all these different anchorage.
00:19:10.599 - 00:19:41.305, Speaker B: There are multiple custodians that work on the Bitcoin side today. So we are going to work with some of these players, not just one many custodians where we secure this BTC across these different custodians. And yeah, I think that's the biggest security concern. Obviously then the other security concern is your BTC getting slashed with Babylon. But that is again a percentage, a very small percentage of your actual BTC holdings. It's the same as slashing on the Cosmos. It's minimal, it's not too big.
00:19:41.305 - 00:19:43.401, Speaker B: So you're not about it.
00:19:43.513 - 00:20:30.189, Speaker A: Like I did see some metrics a while ago that basically the slashing risks were like everyone poses them as one of the hugest risks but even on Ethereum they represent like A very, very, very small percentage of the risk. So I do think you have that part pretty well established. And of course I think we have here the lineup for a next Twitter space with you guys on a later stage to explain better everything else that you are still conc the details. So the invite is already here. I want you guys on a later stage. Whenever you are ready to and have everything settled, we should reconnect and invite you here once again. Now I wanted to go a little deeper onto peace take itself.
00:20:30.189 - 00:20:40.785, Speaker A: So you do guys. You guys do have a token. Can you elaborate on the PSTake token? PSTake token and its role within your ecosystem?
00:20:42.505 - 00:21:22.667, Speaker B: Absolutely. So P stake is the governance token for the protocol where all the parameters around the protocol are decided by PSTake token holders. How many incentives are spent to bootstrap traction on certain projects. Products are decided by P Stake token holders. It's essentially the token holders that determine what happens within the protocol and how it grows. Obviously there are other elements of the P Stake token that a few stakeholders are working on which I'm sure will come to light very soon. But you know, more or less like bringing more utility to the P stake token is something that I know a few stakeholders are working on, so that could be exciting.
00:21:22.667 - 00:21:47.019, Speaker B: But other than that, it's a governance token. It's like your uni token without. Obviously uni has still not implemented the fee switch and rev share, but without the ref share part. It's like that in a way. Yeah, I think that's all I want.
00:21:47.147 - 00:22:03.985, Speaker A: Sorry, I was speaking. I was with it. Sorry. And how like basically I do get that you have it as a governor, so you basically use the token to give the decision model to the community. How do you guys think that the token promotes an healthier and more secure staking environment?
00:22:05.045 - 00:22:47.547, Speaker B: I think again, it's different than. I don't think the token can present a very secure for anything in fact, like even chains and cosmos. Cosmos chains. I don't think any token can actually end up providing security as such unless the token is a high market cap token which then has high economic security. It's a problem we faced with, you know, like liquid staking in cosmos for Atom on the persistence chain because the persistence chain is not, you know, does not have a very high market cap. So people argue that, okay, it's easier to attack the network. So please take the DAPP will exist across the Bitcoin network and Ethereum where the yield BTC token will be issued.
00:22:47.547 - 00:23:26.297, Speaker B: So we are instead of issuing it on a BTC side chain or a BTC L2 which is what most people are trying to do today, or issue the token within Cosmos, for example, we are going to just issue it on Ethereum L1 because that's where most of the liquidity exists. That's where most of the borrowing activity happens. You want to issue the token in a place where you know, you first of all you don't have to rely on security assumptions from smaller chains, smaller projects which have multisig based bridges. Because if we shoot on a BTC L2 or a sidechain, you're going to have to rely on the sidechain.
00:23:26.441 - 00:23:29.289, Speaker A: Exactly. On all those protocols, security.
00:23:29.417 - 00:24:06.503, Speaker B: So we want to first and foremost avoid that risk. In today's context, obviously, as the Bitcoin network evolves, we see OPCATs and 20 other things on the Bitcoin network. We may try to do things on these sidechains and in fact we can also allow people to bridge these assets from the ETH11 to these sidechains. But in the short term we focus on issuance on the Ethereum network because that's where liquidity is. You can issue it in Cosmos, for example, as a Cosmos chain, if you have high economic security plus you're staking ratios high enough. But the problem with that is nobody in Cosmos cares about how. I have Vishal here, by the way.
00:24:06.503 - 00:24:43.689, Speaker B: I see Vishal who is the founder of Stride and they have done a phenomenal job with Atom liquid staking and other liquid staking. But demand for liquid staked assets in Cosmos is quite minimal right now and it may change in the future. But I think for an asset like btc, I don't know how many BTC holders are going to go use Kepler and be like, wow, this excites me. Right? But on the other side, you've seen there is demand, real demand for wbtc, obviously not enough. That's why we are seeing all these problems. But WBTC is like what, 10, $12 billion of WBTC exists on Ethereum. So you can actually see some traction there.
00:24:43.689 - 00:24:51.445, Speaker B: And it's better than in terms of security assumptions, it's better than sidechains or btc. So we want to avoid those security risks.
00:24:52.785 - 00:25:01.785, Speaker A: Nice, nice. I think pretty much answered everything again on the, on the first question. I'm loving your vibe, man, I have to tell you. Thank you very much.
00:25:01.905 - 00:25:04.145, Speaker B: Sorry man, I'll speak less going forward.
00:25:04.265 - 00:25:38.455, Speaker A: No, no, no, go ahead, go ahead and please be my guest. Speak as much as you want because like the alpha you're dropping like in your Vision is really invaluable and like the, the opportunity to bring this type of opinions to our community. That's why we created these places. So totally appreciate you. Thank you very much for everything that you are saying. I'm just trying to go over the doc and see what's missing in terms of questions for you guys. So we already covered the token, the, the liquidities.
00:25:38.455 - 00:25:59.885, Speaker A: What is your roadmap for the next, the next months ahead? So we are currently on a bull run. Everything we are doing is getting is being met by with hype. So how are you guys evolved to cater to future needs of bitcoin stakers and what are you guys planning to do on the next couple months?
00:26:00.545 - 00:26:48.751, Speaker B: Yeah, very good question and I like how you said the roadmap for the next couple months. I think the standards in this industry are like roadmaps for two months. But I can maybe say for us like I started off with right, the goal is to build for decades with Bitcoin. Like that's an asset you can actually aim to build for decades. One is like really making sure. So Babylon goes live based on my knowledge and maybe speculation, they will not have any consumer chains or any AVs that will be live at launch, which means they will be accepting deposits. Assuming they accept deposits with a cap, you know, let's say they have 50 mil, 100 mil cap of deposits in BTC and assuming they have some point system like eigenlayer.
00:26:48.751 - 00:27:34.893, Speaker B: Did you want to be in a position where you are able to deposit your btc? Because there's going to be a rush to deposit BTC again? For me, what's the most important thing is to make sure our users who deposit BTC with us are able to, you know, earn those Babylon points or whatever they look like. I don't know if they're gonna exist, but if they exist, our users are able to earn those points and be in a place where they are actually like, you know, the first step is secured and we cover a large part of the Babylon cap. If Babylon has, you know, 100 mil cap, we would love to have like 50% of that filled by peace take. Obviously all speculative. Can't say it's going to happen. It's tough. But in a way making sure that happens, that's the first and foremost thing for us.
00:27:34.893 - 00:28:32.369, Speaker B: We build the product again, we'll test out more capabilities which is running the strategies for which chains to secure which validators, which node operators. Like an Eigen layer, these assets are delegated with and then which chains they secure. Similarly I believe there are about four or five chains that Babylon is going to support. We want to be able to make sure that they receive as much economic security as possible through peace take, which means sourcing btc, getting more BTC holders excited. I think the biggest difference in our approach versus what everyone else is trying to do is everyone else is going after the five major BTC players in the ecosystem world, BTC and supplying liquidity in these, you know, L2 sidechains. I believe it's not even controversial at this point for me to say it out loud, which is like most of the TVL that you see is just, yeah, I put it here today, tomorrow I remove it, put it there. It's like five, 10 big players doing that.
00:28:32.369 - 00:29:17.995, Speaker B: What I want to do is go after like real people who, who care about Bitcoin and generating yields on their Bitcoin and make it sustainable over a long term. So one is using Bitcoin, using Babylon to stake. That's the first big part of our roadmap. The second big part of our roadmap is to find other interesting decentralized or C defi opportunities to generate yield. Again, a lot of people are running the basis trade arbitrage and those kinds of strategies. We want to see how we can go beyond that and generate yield on people's Bitcoin in a secure manner, as safe as possible. Getting multiple audits, getting audits of the infrastructure, and then working towards a longer term roadmap where you actually see bitcoin network evolves.
00:29:17.995 - 00:29:44.925, Speaker B: So, you know, if Bitcoin network tomorrow has opcat, how would you want, like, how would you want to be positioned for that even before that happens? So more research oriented work, we'll be doing that instead of just, you know, like trying to source BTC from five whales or 10 whales. So obviously getting that TVL, getting people to generate the reels through Babylon staking, but going beyond that immediately after is going to be a big part of roadmap.
00:29:45.085 - 00:30:22.035, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it makes total sense and fully subscribe to the theory of 10 people deploying all the TVL at the moment. We do see that like anyone looking into the market can understand that there are some where it moves around and liquidity just moves around within a couple people, man. Thank you very much, Mikhil. Like, in terms of questions, I think it's pretty much a wrap. I don't know if you have any final statements you want to leave to our community. I do see that we have a packed audience today. So if you want to give and drop any final statements from the Peace Tech side.
00:30:22.035 - 00:30:27.295, Speaker A: We will be happy to hear. And then, yeah, we can close the space. Thank you very much for coming, man.
00:30:27.715 - 00:30:48.759, Speaker B: No, absolutely, man. Very happy to be here and thank you so much for hosting. I know you're a busy man as well, so appreciate you taking the time from my side. I would just maybe add, like, finally, I think we've kind of meandered around the space a lot. We spent like trying a lot to find that emf. Right. Because it's hard to do that.
00:30:48.759 - 00:31:10.699, Speaker B: There are. There are teams who ship very fast. There are teams who have things figured out. And to be very honest, we weren't one of those teams. I keep saying we started from a negative place instead of zero as a startup. When we started, we were like in a negative place, to be honest. But today we are in a place where we have all the necessary pieces of the puzzle to make it big.
00:31:10.699 - 00:31:34.675, Speaker B: And that's kind of what our objective is. But more than anything, it's to build over a long period of time. And the tokens are fully liquid. The team is vested, there's everything. But I still have the same motivation I had four years ago to build and so has most of the team. Right. So for us it's about like, you know, not caring whether it's a bull bear, but just continue building.
00:31:34.675 - 00:32:00.765, Speaker B: The token is up, down. None of that. All of that is a distraction. Obviously you want to be in a position where you can build for multiple years, multiple cycles. That's why the treasury is important, which we do have. So for us, it's just about like building for an asset that you are excited about, personally very excited about. And, you know, you can see yourself building for a long time and then just go after it relentlessly over those decades.
00:32:00.765 - 00:32:10.353, Speaker B: Very young, right? I'm like 26, you know, I have hopefully my whole life ahead of me, so I'm gonna build for this. And that's what most of the team here wants to do as well.
00:32:10.489 - 00:32:31.809, Speaker A: Man, I'm so glad to hear that. It's like we can hear on your voice the enthusiasm and all the efforts you are putting. Man. Thank you very much for coming.
