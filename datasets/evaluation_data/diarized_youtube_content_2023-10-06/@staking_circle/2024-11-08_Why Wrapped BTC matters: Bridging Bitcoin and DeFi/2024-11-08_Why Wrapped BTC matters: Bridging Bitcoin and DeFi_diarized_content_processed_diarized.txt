00:00:01.280 - 00:00:19.241, Speaker A: Okay guys, let's get started already. Ping. The communities here, they should be joining us across the time. How are you guys doing today? Everything good? Joao, my man, I know that you are in Thailand. It's already a little bit late for you. Thank you for joining. How are you doing, sir?
00:00:19.353 - 00:00:49.205, Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely. Actually, it's like a super rainy day today. Like, I couldn't even get lunch because all the drivers, like there are no drivers in the street. So I still need an 8, which is ridiculous anyways. But I have food in the house, so it's fine. But yeah, it's like still tropical rain here, so I hope that when devcon comes, like, it will be gone. But now it's still like crazy rains nowadays, which is insane.
00:00:49.205 - 00:00:55.695, Speaker B: Like you cannot even get out of the house. It's like a river outside. Like the streets are in river mode. You need a boat to leave.
00:00:56.635 - 00:00:58.283, Speaker A: Damn. So that's crazy.
00:00:58.379 - 00:01:41.825, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think like in like two weeks or something, it should clear. So I think that when DEFCON comes, it will be completely clear. I also saw some crazy news that some team of some crypto project went to the forests of Talent to try to find Mul and they got like stuck in a forest or something like that, like trying to find the hippo. Like some crazy. Yeah, some crazy meme stuff, you know, like imagine if we as Inception, we put like all our team in the middle of the forest just trying to find a hippo to take a picture for marketing. That's crazy.
00:01:41.825 - 00:01:43.437, Speaker B: That's really crazy.
00:01:43.501 - 00:01:53.081, Speaker A: The crypto space is crazy. Like meme coins are also like a big part of it. And like, if they were able to do it, just imagine the hype. Like, hey guys, we actually found Mudang.
00:01:53.153 - 00:01:54.761, Speaker B: Exactly. Every. Exactly.
00:01:54.793 - 00:01:57.325, Speaker A: Every people of that community would be with them.
00:01:58.185 - 00:02:20.639, Speaker B: No, exactly, exactly. That's why I think that these guys took the chance to go to the middle of the forest just to try to take a picture. I think they did it. I saw this in some newsletter email that I got yesterday and everyone is getting super, super hyped for Thailand. So I guess it's going to be pretty good. It's going to be pretty good. Like it's going to be like the last event of the year.
00:02:20.639 - 00:02:29.047, Speaker B: So I guess everyone is excited to just have a last event and you chill for Christmas pretty much. And yeah, that's it.
00:02:29.151 - 00:02:42.391, Speaker A: But yeah, man, thank you very much for joining us. Really excited. Apguru, man, how are you doing? Just was a quick intro for the people that are joining us. We are very Familiar with Linux, but we might have some new people here, so go ahead sir.
00:02:42.583 - 00:03:03.887, Speaker C: Sounds good. Yeah, Doing well over here. Looking forward to defcon. Hopefully it's not going to be that rainy when I arrive there. So I've been building in DEFI for the past four years. Co founded Apeswap Bootstrap from 0 to 750 million in TVL. Now rebranded to Avon, the multichain bonding solution.
00:03:03.887 - 00:03:12.195, Speaker C: I'm currently focused on Linux which is Lineas liquidity hub that offers concentrated liquidity and automated liquidity management solutions.
00:03:14.405 - 00:03:39.225, Speaker A: That's great man. Thank you for joining. Excited to also see you guys joining defcon. I know already that Linux will be there present and they're going to be a lot of events. Like there's going to be the main events, but the side events is also going to be crazy. I already saw some lists of the amount of side events and I gotta be honest with you, I don't even know how we can manage across.
00:03:40.595 - 00:03:45.211, Speaker C: Yeah, we have a problem of side event fragmentation nowadays for sure.
00:03:45.283 - 00:03:57.175, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Like you just need to choose like three or four per day that you really like and then just go to those ones and like prioritize like meetings, like important meetings and stuff. Otherwise it's impossible.
00:03:57.875 - 00:03:58.467, Speaker A: Of course.
00:03:58.531 - 00:03:59.775, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah.
00:04:00.395 - 00:04:12.275, Speaker A: Gonzalo, my guy, my co host, my brother in arms. I know that it's very early for you. So basically like Joao and Gonzalo are literally in two opposites, the points of the world. How are you doing, sir?
00:04:13.215 - 00:04:32.795, Speaker D: They're really great. Well, I'm in Peru, South America, so it's really early for me. But still like yeah, it's really great. It's. It's doing fine. I'm nothing. Nothing like a rainy day or like flooding going outside like Joel.
00:04:32.795 - 00:05:02.815, Speaker D: But yeah, what we were talking like you guys were talking about regarding side events. Yeah, side events have been like getting like kind of hectic recently in the major events and I think from the past, I think past two years in the industry. Side events is where things happen. To be completely honest. Nothing against not throwing shade to, to the main event, to defcon. But yeah, I think what Joel said.
00:05:04.525 - 00:05:25.025, Speaker B: Like in the fence it's where everything happens. Like for sure. Like it's true. Like, like if Paris. No, if CC next year is going to be in Ken and like the real estate in Cairns is already like skyrocketing in price just because of that announcement. I just saw that news. Like it's crazy.
00:05:25.025 - 00:05:30.911, Speaker B: Yeah, everyone is just like hyping up like side events and events in general.
00:05:30.983 - 00:05:56.849, Speaker A: So the crypto is the crypto inflation. God damn. We are already pumping the markets, but the wrong ones. But yeah, my man, thank you very much. Really happy to have you guys here. Welcome to everyone in the space. Okay, I hope you guys enjoy it and also are able to learn something new.
00:05:56.849 - 00:06:41.069, Speaker A: The topic today is why repbtc matters. Okay? For those that are not familiar, rep BTC is one of the oldest projects in the defi space and it was the first one to allow us to use BTC in defi. So today is going to be an exciting topic. There's a lot of controversy and a lot of things happening around it. There's a lot of new players joining the rep BTC versions of, of the market and we're going to cover it all. So to start, I would like just to have the most simple answer. What is exactly rap BTC and why is it so important? Joao, you have been in the market for a lot of time.
00:06:41.069 - 00:06:42.149, Speaker A: This is one stress.
00:06:42.197 - 00:07:51.705, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Like, why it's important is actually a super simple answer, right? It's because you are bringing btc, which is the oldest asset, the original one, right to defi. So you are adding defi composability to that. So you're adding the fact that you can now produce yields on top of btc. You can actually bring it to evm, you can actually stake it, restake it. You can actually do all the loops that you want with btc, right? So, and I think that's really exciting, especially now that you are seeing a lot of retail coming in, because you have all these big whales, these big guys from the old days of BTC that probably are tired of just having their BTC just waiting on their wallet, right? So by doing this bridge and by bringing it to wrapped btc, you can now use your BTC in way, way, way more ways. And you can add yields, you can add whatever you want, you know, because, like, why just keeping your BTC locked in your wallet forever when you can actually use it and make something out of it and earn more money on it.
00:07:51.705 - 00:08:09.805, Speaker B: So I think that, like, it's still super early, as we always say, but with more and more retail coming in, I think it will grow more and more and more and it'll be more and more important. That's, that's the way I see it. Because everyone wants to get more money. So this is the way to do it. Special.
00:08:10.805 - 00:08:17.745, Speaker A: Most definitely. Most definitely, sir. Thank you for the short explanation. Do you have anything to add here or.
00:08:18.565 - 00:09:02.965, Speaker C: So I would say that Yeah, I think I agree with everything sh say. I think that at the end of the day bitcoin's utility is largely limited by its own blockchain. And here is where the significance of RAP BTC comes in by Enable to create like a one on one pegged asset to tap into basically programmable money or programmable blockchains. This unlocks everything that Shao says without having to actually exit your bitcoin to participate on DeFi. So at the end of the day with all the limitations that the bitcoin blockchain has, like rapid is quite important to be able to tap into this liquidity in more comprehensive ecosystems such as Ethereum and others.
00:09:03.935 - 00:09:05.435, Speaker B: Yep, exactly.
00:09:07.295 - 00:10:14.925, Speaker A: For sure man. Thank you. Like Rapidity as you said guys, like is on the market and it was like the first breach to bring BTC to Defi and obviously it earns its merits. Like it shows its value is right now roughly 65% of all rap BTC is currently used as a collateral in the major defi platforms like mostly AAVE and it used to be on MakerDAO but from what I see MakerDAO already started at the off program, an off ramp program of REPTC support due to the most recent news. We're going to get there, we're going to cover it, but obviously there's the space and the need for rep BTC AAVE still uses it and it's one of the biggest deposits that they have in their in their depth. With that said guys, what do you guys believe are the implications of RAPDZC making for 15% of Avex Capital with over 2.5, over 2.7
00:10:14.925 - 00:10:43.095, Speaker A: billion assets borrowed? And how does this impact the DEFI protocol stability since the RAPIDC is now facing custody challenges, which is basically the main reason why MakerDAO decided to stop supporting it. Do you believe like this is something to be aware of? Is it something that is just a fad and is people flooding the RapidC or is there any sustainable or anything relevant about this?
00:10:44.275 - 00:11:19.719, Speaker B: Like I can start here. I think that this is, this is just the proof that we are again in super, super early days and we just need more adoption, right? We need more companies and more protocols supporting and this is just the beginning. So I don't see this as a bad thing. This is just like the natural evolution of things. Like I would believe that in the next 1, 2, 3 years you have way, way more adoption and more, more decentralization. So I guess this is just like the beginning, you know. So you have of course some Players adopting more than others.
00:11:19.719 - 00:11:46.635, Speaker B: But with time I do see more and more adoption coming, especially now with all these restaking narrative and even with Karak that wants to do restaking of restaked assets and all that. So you will see more and more interest in this asset and of course more adoption in general. So I don't see it as a bad thing as of now, I just see as a natural evolution. So I do believe that in the future we'll have more and more decentralization.
00:11:48.455 - 00:13:02.455, Speaker C: I personally believe that this situation offers both opportunity and risk. On one hand I do believe that it's way more capital efficient to focus on a single asset, to grow its liquidity, to grow its collateral, to enable to borrow and make sure that liquidations can be executed with deep liquidity under a single bitcoin derivative. But on the other hand, when a single token accounts for so much of the borrower amount of a single lending network or multiple lending networks, or when a single asset dominates all on chain liquidity, the whole of Defi is sensitive to the risks of that token. And for example custodial issue as was bringed up disruption of trust, loss of access to a bitcoin reserves or compromise of the custodial wallets could put all of Ethereum defi at risk. It kind of undermines the value of decentralization and brings a lot of security risks. So it's kind of a do so it's super capital efficient to have like this single asset as the core of all of Bitcoin defi. But on the other hand, like if something falls out of place, the risks are enormous at this stage.
00:13:03.675 - 00:13:19.049, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but I guess that we just need more and more assets, more adoption, more protocol supporting at the end of the day to just have less risks like you just said.
00:13:19.217 - 00:13:48.455, Speaker C: Right. But on the contrary, like if you end up having five or six bitcoin derivatives, it's not necessarily going to be super capital efficient for the end user or the protocols themselves when they need to manage risk factors, liquidations, borrow rates. Also when you are trying to get into bitcoin from Ethereum, like the liquidity is not going to be super deep if it's split among six or seven different derivatives. So it's kind of a double edged sword on this case.
00:13:48.615 - 00:13:50.199, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is, it is.
00:13:50.327 - 00:15:11.385, Speaker A: But at the same time it's an open market, like if we want to grow like obviously there will be competitors for different spaces in the web, free space and obviously RAPIDC is one of the biggest right now and we can see Already competition surging like cb, if cb, BTC from Coinbase, KBTC from Kraken, they are approaching the market, they are taking advantage of what's happening to RAPIDC to take their share. And the good thing or the bad thing like as we said normally is always a double edged sword. At least Kraken and Coinbase already have their backing because of their biggest execution behind it. I'm interested to see what will be the adoption of it and actually like Makerdao actually decided to stop supporting RapidityC and he started supporting CB BTC and I'm really curious to see what the next month hold for us in terms of the growth or the loss of these wrapped versions of btc. Let's see how it goes. And obviously we are speculating right now in the terms of Ross that each one of them can have. It's all speculation, it's all suppositions but it's good to see that at least in terms of market competition and the search of new solutions is evolving.
00:15:11.385 - 00:15:18.225, Speaker A: With that said, Gonzalo my man, you are very quiet. I know that you have your own thoughts on this. Please go ahead sir.
00:15:18.765 - 00:15:48.111, Speaker D: No, I think what I agree with you guys are saying we have like those concerns but I think everything in the end goes to you could say the drama behind all of this. Regarding Bitco's plan to do a joint venture with Bitlobal, I don't know if you wanted to start talking about this Miguel, for sure.
00:15:48.223 - 00:16:55.625, Speaker A: So like guys, for those that don't have not been following the situation, just a quick summary. What basically happened is that repbtc is suffering a little bit of the Bitgo controversy because Bitgo announced plans to transfer RAP BTC management to a new joint venture with Bitglobal. And the way that they communicated this and shared that they wanted to do raise some concerns regarding centralization and some regulatory uncertainty behind it so that they should follow compliance if they will follow all the security measures. And the thing that a lot of protocols are trying to figure out right now is if these risks are valid, what would be the worst case scenarios and how can they at least be prepared for them? Do you guys have any idea on how they could fight with against this? Maybe Apgur you can go ahead like you are on the front of one of the biggest Dexes in Linea. Maybe you have already a solution or at least some thoughts around this?
00:16:57.325 - 00:17:55.861, Speaker C: Definitely. So my understanding is that first Bitgo gave custody of the multisim to be global as part of their arrangement. Nevertheless, as they saw the community concerns they actually changed to actually be a multiparty and multi jurisdiction involving Hong Kong, Singapore and also their US entity. So I personally find that the decentralization argument quite far fetched because here we go into having single source of custody on a single country to go into multiple source of custodies in multiple jurisdictions, which in my opinion mitigates the risks of a centralized third party. I also find far fetched that argument because RAPIDC never alleged to be a decentralized asset. It was always in custody of Bitgo in the US jurisdiction. It was always subject to US regulations and so forth.
00:17:55.861 - 00:18:39.425, Speaker C: So the change, in my opinion, it's in general net positive because now we have three jurisdictions. Not a single point of failure. If one jurisdiction decides to change the regulations, decides to brick the whole system, you still have two jurisdictions that can continue to partake in the protocol. They can continue to execute signatures. They can also find another custodian to participate if one of the jurisdictions decides that this is not a legal operation or whatever. So in general, I think it's a good change. And I think that having multiple parties partaking on the custody of RAPIDC is healthier than having a single party.
00:18:40.325 - 00:19:17.205, Speaker A: Most definitely. Like obviously, if we can centralize somehow the control of it, obviously that's great. And at least on that part of being in several countries already gives them a little bit of an edge on that the problem that was raised and I believe this is still being discussed. So the initial announcement was that BitGo allocated 2 keys to BitGlobal of a 2 out of 3 multi sig setup. Obviously this would mean that Bitcoin Global alone could sign the transactions. This was like the biggest worry at the beginning, I believe. Like they haven't, or at least I haven't followed up the announcements yet.
00:19:17.205 - 00:19:26.855, Speaker A: I actually need to follow up on this. But I believe that they are still discussing it, addressing these concerns so that maybe they can propose a new solution.
00:19:27.755 - 00:19:38.935, Speaker C: My understanding is that they included the Bitgo Singapore entity to make sure that BitGlowal wasn't two or three and it was actually one per country.
00:19:39.755 - 00:20:00.495, Speaker A: Okay, so there's already an update on that. Man, thank you for explaining that because I was not following up on that part. This is already an improvement. So it's 1, 1, 1 instead of being 2:1. So they will always need two entities in two different countries to sign it. That's perfect. So that's already at least alleviate a little bit of the major concern.
00:20:00.495 - 00:20:26.721, Speaker A: But yeah, man. Gonzalo, do you want to take a lead A little bit. Now I know that you have some thoughts on the next questions. You might be able to get some hype here from the community. And guys, right now. I know that you are hearing Apguru and Joaon, they have a lot of experience in the market. But if you guys have any questions, any thoughts, any new that you actually followed up or seen, please feel free to drop it in the comments.
00:20:26.721 - 00:20:46.485, Speaker A: We are more than happy to hear and share our thoughts with you and also learn with you guys. Okay? If by any chance someone is interested in joining this space on the stage, I will be happy to also invite you later down the space. Okay, so just leaving that clear here. Gonzalo, the mic is yours. Sir.
00:20:47.105 - 00:21:57.867, Speaker D: Yes, I think what you were saying regarding this, I think one of the major concerns or the two concerns that the community overall raised was regarding regulatory status, particularly given just in some history of regulatory challenges. And also there have been a lot of concerns regarding transparent audits for the RAP BTC custody. So I think that's most of the main concerns. I think yes, they managed to kind of like revise the model and they do these three institutions, three credit instructions to offer better regulatory and security diversification. But it kind of partially restored the community trust. Concerns still are running rampant and I think the reaction of other players and what they managed to somehow like take advantage of this is what's going on. I don't know, Joao, what is your.
00:21:58.051 - 00:22:32.795, Speaker B: Yeah, like the thing is like people sometimes forget that the BTC market, especially in Asia, is like controlled by a couple players, very big players. And the retail, even though big. And I think that's more global. Like even though the retail is big, like you still have big, big whales controlling the majority of the market. And you see that Justin sun is pretty much on everything, you know, like even on, like specifically our market, like on. On. On restaking.
00:22:32.795 - 00:22:51.991, Speaker B: The majority of the protocols are working with Justin sun. Even ourselves, our advisors. And we also plan to work with Justin in the future. We have advisors that work directly with Justin. And the thing is, I think that this is the case of. It is what it is. You cannot change it.
00:22:51.991 - 00:23:21.353, Speaker B: If Justin has a couple of B's and B's and B's to deploy the market, you need to work with him eventually. The same with like players like Arthur Hayes and other like big Chinese family offices, etc. Etc. The same thing for like Russian money and all that. And that's just crypto. No, that's just how it is. And I think that we in Europe, or maybe in America in general, like still very concerned about all regulation.
00:23:21.353 - 00:24:08.243, Speaker B: Regulation. But like if you just worry about regulation all day, just don't evolve. So I think that now that I'm spending a lot of time in Asia and I know things work here, it's like you just do whatever you need to do. You just sit down with people, you do the deals the best way as possible and you advance, you know, that's how things work here. And I think that's how crypto has been since the early, early days, you know, like in even like antminer bit mining, Shenzhen, China. You know, like, like all these things started with like dinners with people, sitting down with people doing the deals and then things advanced, you know. So if you are expecting that you need to, oh, I don't like Justin, I will not touch his money.
00:24:08.243 - 00:24:54.303, Speaker B: I'm so sorry. Probably you have some of his money like in the majority of the protocols already, you know, like it's impossible to just not see that. Right. So I think that still the guy is doing great for the ecosystem in general. Everyone appreciates all these big whales and the big whales are pretty much shaping the market. So I guess that it is what it is because imagine a normal person will probably, I don't know, invest 10k max 20k, even maybe 100k. It's rare for again normal persons like to invest million, 10 million, whatever.
00:24:54.303 - 00:25:31.665, Speaker B: You know, you need all these big whales or you have of course the institution which is now coming a lot, right? BlackRock, having a lot of interest in these topics, etc. Etc. Like you will see more and more institutional money coming in and I think that's good. So I think that like me, that I'm from the early, early days of btc, where was everything on like Silk Road, Dark web, et cetera, et cetera. Like less regulation, more money and more speed. Like classic crypto. Like I'm up for that.
00:25:31.665 - 00:25:39.129, Speaker B: So that's my view, like maybe a little bit of more anarchistic view of crypto, but that's my view. That's why I love crypto.
00:25:39.297 - 00:27:11.179, Speaker D: Yeah, it's really interesting what you just said because there is like probably on the side of media and the echo chamber that always X or Twitter always happening around us is like we are kind of more like we get the western side of things. The opinion which is more related to like USA Americans, like we need more regulations on the SEC and everyone, they're getting a lot of things and the, and the cultural difference between how businesses are made in Asia in general is kind of different. Like you were saying most things are like you go to dinner with with people and then you do the OTC most of the time and hey we just joined America is different, completely different. And I think this could be like under wraps is like be an Asia versus the West. It could be. I don't know. Yeah regarding this but I think something also important to mention is that Makerdao's decision to halt a new borrowing they have also decided to burn like RAP BTC signal as loss of trust in instability and I think they have burned like 30 million in rap BTC is still, I think the, the sentiment is still like.
00:27:11.179 - 00:27:47.645, Speaker D: Like Ape you were saying. Yes, we got like the three institution, three jurisdictions but still the. The market has reacted negatively. You could see other players have reacted like taking advantage and this move could shift like liquidity to alternatives like cbt, cv, btc. This is Coinbase. But we're going to talk about this a little bit in a moment and I think Ape, how do you. What do you think regarding this reaction from Makerdao? How significant do you think this reaction is for the market in general?
00:27:48.985 - 00:28:32.523, Speaker C: I think it's definitely a significant reaction. After all like dai, it's potentially the biggest decentralized stablecoin even though they change quite a bit their paradigm, even their name. I personally do think it's a little bit of an overreaction. I think that many of the processes and how RAP BTC is audited and how you check the amount of BTC on chain hasn't really changed to signify an immediate risk. But as you say the market is reacting, the protocols are talking. AAVE has also been talking about this. MakerDAO took an immediate action as soon as there was a change in custody.
00:28:32.523 - 00:29:27.255, Speaker C: So there's definitely something happening. I mean the market is definitely reacting to this. Potentially many players don't like what they are seeing and it also opens the doors to new alternatives and new competitors which I think is generally healthy to the ecosystem to have a let's say fair competition. But on the other hand going back to efficiency we might see like a lot of liquidity fragmentation which is also a massive topic on DeFi. But at the end of the day, I mean I think it is what it is I guess and we'll see how it evolves. But also let's say on the back end or the back door, you never know the true intentions of what is happening. I mean maybe CBTC was on the pipeline, they saw an opportunity, people coordinated to make all this talk about ERA btc.
00:29:27.255 - 00:29:52.105, Speaker C: We don't know because basically this happened and suddenly this new Bitcoin derivatives came to life. Then protocols might be more aligned to the new one and the intentions. At the end of the day it's hard to really understand what's going behind if it's really because we are afraid of the new custody of rap BTC or because we are more aligned with the new btc.
00:29:54.175 - 00:30:37.205, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like always things are brewing on the back end or behind curtains. So sometimes there's like narratives that we don't know that are going around until we get like them in the media or reactions or actions from other players. And I think also I don't know if this loose of trust in in rap BTC could drive liquidity but like permanent, like steadily like towards alternative. Like you were saying regarding TBTC or Coinbase btc. And what does this mean for the Rap BTC future dominance? Maybe like Joao, maybe you could have like an insight regarding this.
00:30:40.065 - 00:31:31.457, Speaker B: Like I don't have like a super, super hardcore opinion on this, but I'll say that TPTC is definitely like getting good territory and good adoption. So I will say that TBTC is definitely like something that I see being used more and more every day. For CBTC that you just talked, it's a thing about west versus east again because some people like more Coinbase, some people are more on the Asia side with OKX Bina. So I don't know about that. Like it depends a lot on the feeling of the sentiment of the people. But for TBTC specifically I do see getting more and more adoption every day. At least that's my opinion there.
00:31:31.521 - 00:31:41.725, Speaker A: The thing is sir, TBTC is a fully decentralized one. Coinbase has the old institutional part.
00:31:42.065 - 00:31:44.005, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly.
00:31:44.945 - 00:32:29.169, Speaker A: Right now they are custodying, I would say like 80% of all the ETFs of Bitcoin. What will happen when they actually start adding yield to it? Mostly probably all of it will go to CBBTC to be used in defying rep. At least this is something that I would expect to see not right now, but further down the line. This could be something that could be seen. Okay. And this is worrying but at the same time very cool to see that. Okay, ETFs already have BTC being supported and considered by Coinbase.
00:32:29.169 - 00:33:02.667, Speaker A: Most of it. If they can somehow use it and bring it to defi. Look at the amount of liquidity that will enter the space. Yeah, but this is like the long tail situation as you say. Once again the two sides of the space. You have one side btc which is mostly centralized and run by Coinbase and they have also based. It's one of the biggest chains right now in terms of growth and volume.
00:33:02.667 - 00:33:26.777, Speaker A: So there's a lot going on for them on that side. But at the same time, like we have TBTC coming up, it's fully the centralized or at least it aims to be. And as you said, like it's mostly supported on Asia. The biggest interest is on the east side of the world for tbtc, west side of the world for cbtc and there's still going to be new players joining the market.
00:33:26.891 - 00:33:28.813, Speaker B: As I said like 100%.
00:33:28.909 - 00:33:31.105, Speaker A: Kraken already wants their own token.
00:33:31.445 - 00:33:38.669, Speaker B: So yeah, I would love to also hear. I opinion on this, like RapidC versus TBTC versus CB.
00:33:38.717 - 00:34:26.750, Speaker C: So I'm personally like a fan of TBTC. I'm hoping that they get the market share they deserve. I think it's well designed, decentralized, easy to use, no gatekeeping, fully transparent. It really holds true to the ethos of crypto. So I'm hoping that TBTC gets the share they deserve and I'm definitely rooting for them under all these changes, let's say in wrapped bitcoin options and then for Coinbase btc, I find this kind of going into CB BTC from rap btc. In my opinion, it's kind of like, how to say it's contradictory to the fat around Rap btc. It's like we are changing one for the other.
00:34:26.750 - 00:35:17.063, Speaker C: Yeah, Coinbase is well known, it's well regulated, but for now, like there is no proof of reserves. You can't really mint it, you can't really redeem it. It's like, oh yeah, Coinbase has this bitcoin somewhere and it's distributing them on chain in the form of cbtc. So considering all the negative thoughts about wrapped BTC like cb BTC currently is far behind in terms of transparency, in terms of like who can participate, in terms of who can mint it, redeem it, et cetera. So I find very contradictory for someone to go from rap BTC to cbtc in my opinion, like, I don't see this. Like it's not even like addressing the concerns that people brought in terms of rap btc. So having said this, I'm a massive fan of tbtc.
00:35:17.063 - 00:35:19.275, Speaker C: I think they are doing the right thing.
00:35:20.605 - 00:35:36.501, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Agreed, agreed, agreed, agreed. Perfect. Guys, I need to leave for another meeting. Like now I know that is a bit. Still we have some. Maybe one more topic, but I really need to leave.
00:35:36.501 - 00:35:42.925, Speaker B: Was amazing to be here with you guys and I expect to see you very, very soon. Thank you guys.
00:35:42.965 - 00:35:48.733, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Well, thank you for joining us and already sharing all those insights. Really looking forward to see you soon.
00:35:48.789 - 00:35:49.525, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:35:49.645 - 00:35:51.465, Speaker A: And appreciate you sir.
00:35:52.845 - 00:35:53.669, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you.
00:35:53.717 - 00:35:54.305, Speaker C: Bye.
00:35:54.965 - 00:35:55.613, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:35:55.709 - 00:35:56.957, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Cheers guys.
00:35:57.021 - 00:35:57.293, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:35:57.349 - 00:35:58.385, Speaker B: Bye. Bye. Bye.
00:35:59.885 - 00:36:28.875, Speaker A: And now we were three left. Guru, you have all the, all the, all the shy lights to you. There's all. We are also almost wrapping up also the space. Okay, we have only one more topic that I would like to go over which is basically the future outlook. Okay, we already covered the situation behind wrapped btc. We already mentioned and went over the new wrapped versions and what this problem will come up and search on the market.
00:36:28.875 - 00:37:17.345, Speaker A: My question is what will this look like for the future of RapidTC and how will this impact the full model of wrapped versions of Bitcoin in DeFi? What do you think it's going to be like? Okay, we have new players joining the market, we have the backlash still being analyzed behind rep btc. I can already tell that although this backlash, there's still a lot of rapidity and I believe there was even a small increase in rapid TC in the market. So there's not a lot of backlash behind it. So actually. But sir, go ahead, share your thoughts. This is the last question. If anyone also wants to share their thoughts on this, feel free to raise your hands and come up to the stage.
00:37:18.765 - 00:38:26.265, Speaker C: So I personally believe that considering the RAP BTC market share, it's going to be really tough to displace it. Although not impossible. Also, like if defi protocols decide to coordinate themselves to start like removing rapid DC as collateral to stop incentivizing RAPIDC liquidity and so forth, it's definitely possible to displace its dominance. But without a massive change on how defi protocols operate and with the current state of affairs, I still think it's a long way for RAPIDC to not being the default bitcoin asset for Defi. Nevertheless, I mean I see that as we were just discussing this still brought new opportunities for competition. We have tbtc, we have cb, btc. And the way I see it is that probably like Sebi Bitcoin, not bitcoin defi protocols are going to slowly start building liquidity on the new wrapped bitcoin assets in a way to hedge in the case of RAPIDC losing its dominance.
00:38:26.265 - 00:38:59.365, Speaker C: And I think that's how it's going to generally go. Like those protocols that are more adverse to RAPIDC are going to start tone it down and including new Bitcoin wrapped assets and others that are maybe neutral to this whole state of affairs are still going to try to let's say hedge and maybe include other wrapped assets just to not be on the wrong side of things. But not necessarily let's say having an what I would consider an exaggerated reaction.
00:39:02.785 - 00:39:50.207, Speaker A: For sure man, like it's what I tell you. Like there's a lot of happening right now behind rapidity. Obviously there's no idea against that they are the markets winner at least for now. They are the biggest one in the market and are the oldest one in the market as a bridge for rep BTC on defy. But due to this new controversy coming up we might see some shifts. Obviously there's already as we can see new competitors joining the market cbbtc, tbtc, KBTC from Kraken. We have a new evolvement on this specific area as you previously said, like it might be a double edged sword.
00:39:50.207 - 00:40:01.327, Speaker A: We'll see a fragmentation of liquidity but at the same time I'm happy to see a little bit of the more competition. Gonzalo, I see that you are wanting to share your thoughts. Go ahead sir.
00:40:01.431 - 00:40:56.945, Speaker D: Yes, yes I I think what you were saying like it's really the sentiments of everyone. I think in my opinion this has been positive because we are now we are going towards a future where there are more viable alternatives to Rapid DC which was dominant for such a long time. It probably is going to lead to like more centralized and transparent solution that are going to challenge rad BTC dominance and I think we're probably going to be heading towards a multi custodian setup alternative with DEFI protocols likely diversifying their BTC based collateral to reduce reliance on any single custodian is something like APUR was saying before and in my opinion this has been possible because this can enhance the ecosystem or resilience.
00:40:59.375 - 00:41:16.595, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree. I also see this as a positive thing because it's basically encouraging competition and the artification and even though I don't like liquidity fragmentation it encourages the industry to continue to progress towards more resilient solutions.
00:41:17.055 - 00:41:17.835, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:21.615 - 00:41:29.575, Speaker D: Miguel, I don't know if you do want to go up with the the final question. This is more like aim for retail or like community.
00:41:31.635 - 00:42:17.223, Speaker A: Like I believe in terms of questions like obviously in the script we already went over everything guys. If anyone has like a question that you want to share please feel free to do it. Rap. BTC obviously has been the one that has been allowing to bring us BTC for Defi the oldest in case anyone like has their own strategy using it. Would also love to hear it. Okay, please do join our telegram so that we can share more ideas around it there. If you would like to also learn more about the REPTC situation, really more about the bitcoin controversy, you already can see the pins post on top of the space.
00:42:17.223 - 00:42:30.585, Speaker A: Okay, you have there a blog that Staking Circle wrote diving deep into this, but I guess that's it. Apguru, any final remarks regarding that you would like to share?
00:42:34.845 - 00:43:18.439, Speaker C: Nothing that comes immediate immediately to mind right now. I think that for everyone listening it's worthwhile to check all the alternatives, TBTC, CBTC and also like all the new BTC 5 opportunities that build on top of this, which I also think are going to get a lot of traction with all these rap BTC I know announcements or whatever. So I think there's like a lot to check and a lot that's going to happen around this. So for everyone listening I encourage to do some research as I do think some bitcoin finance opportunities are definitely emerging and going to emerge around this for sure.
00:43:18.527 - 00:43:36.475, Speaker A: Most definitely. Sir, thank you very much for joining us today. It's always good to hear you talking. Okay. I've been following you in a lot of spaces in Staking Circle and outside. Really looking forward to be able to meet up with you in real life. Okay, I haven't had the chance to get that pleasure.
00:43:36.475 - 00:43:46.675, Speaker A: Once again sir, thank you for joining. Really appreciate you for taking the time to be here with us and I hope you have a great day. Gonzalo, any final remarks from your answer?
00:43:47.295 - 00:45:11.155, Speaker D: No, I think April just went ahead with what I wanted to know. Regarding closing thoughts, what could retail like, I don't know, like should monitor in the future because we are kind of in the end we're all retail. We're also like users and I think like EBRU was saying like we should monitor adoption of alternative like Coinbase, btc, tbtc and I think you were mentioning also the Kraken BTC and I think also the outcome of the regulatory scrutiny on BIT Global because this is an ongoing thing, this hasn't finished to be completely honest. And the performance of the Rice custody models. This is going to be like a really big topic in the bitcoin community that I think is the driving force of DEFI at the moment. So also maybe tracking governance boats on DEFI platforms like could provide insights into future collateral preference. But yeah, I think went ahead and also gave his opinion regarding this and yeah, it's been like a really great space talking about this and I think we're probably going to have like more spaces regarding this as things evolve regarding the Defi Renaissance.
00:45:12.215 - 00:45:22.831, Speaker A: For sure. For sure, man. Thank you very much guys. That's gonna be a wrap for the day. Okay. I really hope you enjoyed the space. For everyone that has been hearing us, really appreciate you.
00:45:22.831 - 00:45:47.983, Speaker A: Thank you for joining us. I hope you had a chance to learn something new and get some insights. As I said, if you want to dive deeper into this, we already pinned here one blog that we wrote that will explain you and give you an overview around what is happening with Rap, BTC and Bit Global in Bitco. Okay. Once again appreciate you. Hope you have a great day. I hope you enjoyed the space.
00:45:47.983 - 00:46:03.525, Speaker A: I want to thank you once again Apeguru and also John that is not here anymore. So I will thank to Inception for joining us. And that's a wrap guys. Hope you have a great week. I hope you have a great weekend and I'll catch you guys next week. See everyone.
00:46:04.065 - 00:46:05.417, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:46:05.521 - 00:46:06.369, Speaker B: Cheers.
00:46:06.537 - 00:46:07.145, Speaker C: Thank you everyone.
