00:00:00.560 - 00:00:18.793, Speaker A: Well, let's kick start, guys. Can everyone hear me? Loud and clear. Hey, Clayton. Welcome, sir. Let me invite you to join as a speaker. You should have received the invite already. If it does not work, it might be bugged.
00:00:18.793 - 00:00:51.753, Speaker A: So I would recommend you to drop from the space and join back so that we are able to hear you. In the meantime, guys, let's just do a quick round of introductions. First of all, to everyone, welcome to the space. We are here once again just to give a little bit of a scope and a preview of what we're going to talk about in our event next week. Okay. It's going to be on the 11th. We're having here speakers from the our sponsors and from our guests.
00:00:51.753 - 00:01:19.835, Speaker A: Speakers from Babylon, speakers from Gold Network, from Symbiotic, and also from Build on Bitcoin. Without further ado, I would like to invite each guest to just do a quick, small introduction of who you are, what's your role within the company and how you join the space. Okay? So without further ado, Clayton, I'll ask you to kick start. You have been the last one to join, so I'll give you the head start here. How are you doing, sir?
00:01:21.885 - 00:01:38.221, Speaker B: I'm good. I'm good. Yeah. So I'm Clayton. I'm the head of BD at Babylon. I've been here for about three months. Before that I was at Rio and that company got acquired by Eigenlayer.
00:01:38.221 - 00:01:48.385, Speaker B: But I've been in the staking space for about five years at this point. So I was an early employee at Figment and also was a partner at Figment Capital. Happy to be here.
00:01:49.965 - 00:02:02.013, Speaker A: Thank you, man. Thank you for joining. Excited to hear your thoughts on the panel of today and also very, very excited to meet you next week in the in real life event Reptile. How are you doing, sir?
00:02:02.149 - 00:02:15.035, Speaker C: Hey, guys. For whatever reason, I don't actually hear the host. I just heard Clay answering, but I don't hear anything that the hosting account is saying. I don't know if you can hear me, if you can react, if you can hear me. Just so I know.
00:02:15.735 - 00:02:16.167, Speaker D: Right?
00:02:16.231 - 00:02:25.035, Speaker C: Okay. I cannot hear you. Let me try and rejoin because if you. If you ask me anything I didn't hear, I'll rejoin the space.
00:02:25.735 - 00:02:27.887, Speaker E: Yes, try to rejoin.
00:02:27.951 - 00:02:44.885, Speaker A: I still. I don't know if you can hear me. Let's let him. Okay. Not sure what is happening. Really quick, send a message to Reptile. Able to hear.
00:02:45.745 - 00:02:48.009, Speaker E: No, he's there. He's. He's up.
00:02:48.177 - 00:02:48.681, Speaker A: You can.
00:02:48.713 - 00:02:51.009, Speaker E: You can send him a speaker again.
00:02:51.177 - 00:03:06.457, Speaker A: Okay. Twitter is Always ragging us. Not really sure why this happens. If someone knows and can tell us how to fix this, this would be very good. Reptile, welcome back. Can you hear me now? Perfect. Okay, let's get it.
00:03:06.457 - 00:03:19.545, Speaker A: Let's start, man. I was doing a quick question just to ask you, just to do a quick introduction about who you are, how you joined the space and how you joined the company that you are working with currently.
00:03:20.005 - 00:04:07.335, Speaker C: Yeah, sure thing. Yeah, I was just sitting here, I thought you guys are taking like exceptionally long to kick things off, but sometimes Twitter spaces will basically not allow one of the speakers to hear the other speakers. I don't know why they haven't sold this bug, but anyway, so MrP, I've joined crypto in 2017 as your typical retail participant and then realize there is something more there. So in 2020 I've joined the space full time. Previously I was a contributor to Balancer, to Fjord Foundry, to Vela Exchange and right now I'm the marketing lead at Gold Network. I'm super excited to be here and yeah, that's it about me.
00:04:07.955 - 00:04:26.331, Speaker A: Thank you sir. Happy to have you here with us today. Also very eager to hear our thoughts on some of the questions and also learn a little bit more about GOT network and what's your objectives with Bevcon. Without further ado, Chris, how are you doing, sir? Welcome. Please tell me that you can hear me.
00:04:26.523 - 00:05:06.169, Speaker D: Okay, Yes, I think I can hear everyone, luckily. Thanks very much for having me. So yeah, my name is Chris, I am head of BD at bob, same as Reptile. I got into Crypto during all the ICO madness in 2017. Saw some interesting stuff, some not so interesting stuff and then kind of got involved in decentralized bridges and mainly bitcoin obviously because I mean bitcoin has always been the one that's been most interesting. And then yeah, from, from that time from decentralized bridges got into roll ups and I'm now at bob Perfect Man.
00:05:06.217 - 00:05:25.005, Speaker A: Thank you for joining the space. Really, really excited to hear your thoughts on this. Also been following the developing of bob. I actually need to speak with your SMM because I already have an invite for you guys to join in a future space about the super chain. But this is a topic for another time.
00:05:25.825 - 00:05:28.297, Speaker D: Very nice. Okay, yeah, sounds good.
00:05:28.481 - 00:05:33.575, Speaker A: We already doing some work here. Last but not least, Jordan. How are you doing sir?
00:05:35.875 - 00:05:53.603, Speaker E: Hey, all good. Yeah, thanks for having me. So yeah, I'm currently the BD lead at Symbiotic. Yeah, I've been working in the space now full time. For several years. I was first joined the space working for Stakewise as head of bd. It's a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum.
00:05:53.603 - 00:06:11.347, Speaker E: So my focus is very much on E staking. Previously before that I was in TradFi. So yeah, with Symbiotic. Now it's moving on from Ether and looking into providing security or economic security across the whole of crypto basically. And yeah, thanks for having me.
00:06:11.451 - 00:06:47.547, Speaker A: Perfect, sir. Welcome, welcome. Really, really excited to have you all here. So guys, before we start with the space, just to give a quick shout out here to our speakers, please do give them a follow. They are the professionals that we all are aiming to be and they are the ones that are building the industry. So if you want to be connected to DeFi and specifically BTCFI, they are the right ones to be aware of. Okay, so without further ado, guys, I know that you have big brands, okay, I know that you are building the BTC FI industry as of now.
00:06:47.547 - 00:07:05.525, Speaker A: But we have some new listeners here in the space joining us. For those that don't know, I would like you to ask, just to ask you to do a quick introduction about each of your protocols. Maybe Babylon can go ahead first. Clayton, just give us like a brief one minute introduction about what Babylon is.
00:07:06.745 - 00:07:59.235, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I. We're not necessarily BTC Phi, but BTC 5 can exist on top of what we're building. So to put it simply, Babylon is effectively, you know, attempting to be the staking shared security layer and liquidity layer for the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin as an asset. So we are creating a staking functionality that exists natively on the Bitcoin network. That Bitcoin that is locked can ultimately be used to provide additional security guarantees to two other execution layer environments. And then also that locking function can allow LST issuers to mint representations of those state positions and other ecosystems.
00:08:01.935 - 00:08:10.115, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Rp, can you tell us a little bit more about what Gold Network is?
00:08:10.415 - 00:09:29.095, Speaker C: Yes, sir. So Gold Network is a Bitcoin L2 and we're basically focusing on trying to solve three main problems just to keep things short. So for all the Bitcoin that's sitting idle, we're trying to enable sustainable yield on our chain so that you can deploy and actually have your Bitcoin work for you instead of just sitting there and being a trillion dollar asset which doesn't really do much. And if you want to build on top of Bitcoin, we want to provide all the tools so that you can build the cool apps, DeFi BTCFI, I guess, rather than defi, you know, landing protocols, gamify, all of that good stuff. And if you're worried about centralization when it comes to L2s, we're also very much focused on that and we're developing toward having a fully decentralized sequencer. Plus on top of this, we have this program called Founders Club where essentially people that are building on top of us early, they get kind of like early incentives to incentivize them to incentivize their community. So that's pretty much what the Gold Network does in a nutshell.
00:09:30.155 - 00:09:48.017, Speaker A: Perfect, sir. Happy to have you guys here. Also really happy to have you guys joining us for the in real life event. Okay, just to give a key here, a brief point when we start, like going over to the next questions. Okay. I want this to be an open panel. Okay.
00:09:48.017 - 00:10:14.285, Speaker A: So don't wait for me to ask you to come up to the stage. Okay. If you have any additional insights that you want to give regarding a specific question, just raise your hand or unmute yourself and go ahead. Okay. Don't wait for my cue to give you the lead on the mic. Okay. Just to complete this round, Jordan, can you please give us a little bit of insight of what Symbiotic is, what you guys are building right now, and what's the purpose of it?
00:10:16.185 - 00:10:40.745, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So Symbiotic is a permissionless shared security framework. So we allow any business, any protocol, any network to kind of build their optimal decentralized security on top of our infrastructure. We have a centralization issue in the space. I don't think we can turn away from that. The Bitcoin network is obviously incredibly decentralized. So too is Eth and a few other L1s.
00:10:40.745 - 00:11:15.965, Speaker E: But a lot of the platforms that get built on top of these core networks are pretty centralized or they have centralized components. So it's a systematic risk that we need to solve for. And so yeah, our mission is pretty simple. We want to make it unjustifiable for anything to launch in a centralized manner. And we do that by making decentralization as easy, as inefficient and as cost effective for these businesses as possible. So yeah, we have businesses building on us. We have node operators that run infrastructure for of these various businesses.
00:11:15.965 - 00:11:50.805, Speaker E: And we have a lot of economic capital stake that is currently in the system that allows these networks, these businesses to kind of bootstrap economic security out of the box in a very, very cost effective manner. And then, yeah, we're Essentially agnostic to what these assets are used, which assets are used for security. And obviously this being a BTC focused space, we have various BTC assets currently staked in Symbardic and actually one of them is LBTC from Lombard which is a BTC RA built on top of Babylon. So yeah, we're all a little bit connected here.
00:11:53.265 - 00:12:13.125, Speaker A: Perfect sir, thank you very much. Excited to have you guys here and also excited to have you guys in the in real life event. Last but not least Chris, give us an insight. What is Bob all about, what are you guys building and what like you have literally built in the name. So go ahead sir.
00:12:14.235 - 00:13:14.769, Speaker D: Yes, so basically what we're trying to do is we're the first hybrid chain which is basically bringing all of the usability and users of Ethereum to Bitcoin in one place. So we'd start as an OP stack roll up. We work with Robin Linus on the bitvm white paper which will eventually allow optimistic roll ups and fraud proofs to happen on Bitcoin and a native Bitcoin bridge into a roll up environment. So we've been have about 100 projects live about 100 million in TBL and the aim is basically we're part of the super chain so we have all of the kind of partnerships within the Ethereum space and we have all the usability and all of the infrastructure that comes with all of that to make it very easy and then we connect to Bitcoin and eventually settle on Bitcoin using BitVM. So you could think of it like base but settles on Bitcoin the basics.
00:13:14.937 - 00:14:33.265, Speaker A: Perfect, thank you very much sir. So I have right now like obviously I don't want to give a lot of spoilers on what's going to be talked about in the in real life event, but I do have a question about BTC and BTC5 which is a concern for me, but I am very eager to know your thoughts on this. Okay, so here it goes. As BTC5 grows. Okay, there's one common criticism that I've been hearing and thing coming up on Twitter which is basically that it often operates on chains outside of the Bitcoin network, leaving basically the BTC locked up in a vault in the BT Coin network instead of actively transacting on Bitcoin itself. The problem of this is that okay, right now all the miners are getting the emissions of Bitcoin that is now being redeemed but once that decreases, basically they also receive fees and rewards of the transaction volume if the BTC FI grows and continues to operate outside of the bitcoin network. This could affect and raise a lot of concerns about the network's long term sustainability.
00:14:33.265 - 00:14:44.435, Speaker A: How do each of you view this challenge and what role do you think that BTC could play in supporting or potentially offsetting these impacts on the bitcoin network?
00:14:48.215 - 00:15:17.699, Speaker D: I could take a stab at it, I guess. I mean we speak to miners all the time, like 80% of the hash rate is on our cap table. So we have these concerns being pushed to us on quite regular basis. We don't. That is a good point and it's a great question. Like it does make sense that like, well, all of this stuff's going on in another place. So like where, where does the value come back to Bitcoin? We see it in a different way.
00:15:17.699 - 00:16:16.715, Speaker D: We see it as like, yes, it's reducing on chain fees, but these L2s are doing stuff that you couldn't do with bitcoin and they are, they are at the end of the day connected to bitcoin. So they have a vested interest to use that and make sure that it's done in a sustainable way. So I mean we're bringing users to Bitcoin that allow for long term sustainability on bitcoin. So like at the end of the day all of these chains, whether we need the staking or whether like, however we use bitcoin, we have a vested interest to increase the security budget for bitcoin long term. That's the thing that all the L2s will all need at the end of the day. So yes, at the start of course these things are happening elsewhere, but in everyone's roadmap, bitcoin security is number one. That's the reason why everyone's interested in it.
00:16:16.715 - 00:17:13.759, Speaker D: That's why all of these Bitcoin L2s are becoming an interesting thing to people. And every single project that does anything and calls itself a Bitcoin R2 or does anything in BTCFI has to in their roadmap have something that increases the security and the fees that are coming back eventually to bitcoin in the end. So the three ways in which you're doing that, obviously number one, like how RSK was doing it and how other chains do it is merge mining. So you can use the hash rate to secure multiple chains and do. And then basically miners earn extra fees. On top of that there's things like Babylon doing like bitcoin staking, where you can add security by staking bitcoin in Babylon and then using that security to secure other chains, which is also a really good way to put value back onto the Bitcoin chain. And then thirdly is the data availability sort of stuff.
00:17:13.759 - 00:18:18.625, Speaker D: So obviously roll ups use Ether as a data availability layer. Bitcoin isn't well suited to that because it's just much more expensive. But this, the whole market is going to grow a huge amount and that's what we're predicting. And eventually as these chains grow and as technology changes on Bitcoin as a data availability, making it easier and making it cheaper, that could be an option when economies of scale allow that. So instead of thinking, what we say when we speak to miners is like, instead of thinking like, how do we get as much money from this stuff while this hype is going right now? It's like, think of the long term, like everyone's got you on your roadmap and there's these, there's these three very good options right now for that value to come back. So instill an environment in which those things are able to grow so that it's a sustainable thing and then the value will eventually come back, given the success of all the L2s that will be growing and all the BTC fund.
00:18:20.925 - 00:19:47.415, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, if you increase the usability of btc, right, like it's ultimately going to increase the price of btc, which in turn will also increase the fees that miners are earning, at least from, you know, inflation. Obviously, like the best way to sustain, you know, earnings of miners long term. Acknowledging that inflation, you know, decays, you know, by half every single four years, is to have like, you know, more settlement existing natively on the bitcoin network. But we're not there, right? I mean like that, that's not going to happen, at least in this cycle at scale. But you know, as, you know, expressivity at some capacity, you know, grows over time with bitvm2 as well as, you know, opcat, that's an obvious, you know, transition where, you know, a lot of these things may not be settled on Ethereum anymore as long as they're like bitcoin denominated defi projects. So I don't think we necessarily need to worry about the fees that are being given to the miners right now. I mean, they seem to be fairly happy about their position in the market currently because people keep on, you know, adding more mining capacity to the network.
00:19:47.415 - 00:19:52.715, Speaker B: So I really don't think that's a problem for this year or even next year.
00:19:54.655 - 00:20:33.465, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm basically inclined to incline to agree with Both. I also think there's kind of another issue. I don't think necessarily BTC FI is going to be the only driver of like lack of utilization. I think the way BTC is going now, at least in the eyes of like traditional finance as well, it's a great store of value. And so what happens in a situation when you, where you have the US government, all of these governments holding a boatload of BTC that is just sat dormant. So there are other kind of avenues that can cause like a lack of like network usage. But yeah, it's kind of the, it's kind of an issue that's been apparent on ETH for a little while now.
00:20:33.465 - 00:21:34.293, Speaker E: Um, it's one of the core reasons why ETH has really underperformed this cycle, at least in the last six months. And that is because it's a very fragmented ecosystem with lots of L2s that are capturing all the economic value. And the way this is being resolved on Etherneth specifically, and Chris touched upon this, is that you can still run A, an L2 while still rewarding or utilizing the core validators running on the network. So there's a new concept in Ethereum called like based roll ups where the, the L2s are offloading the sequencer duties to Ethereum validators. That's certainly the problem with Bitcoin is that there's, there's, there's, it's slightly harder to achieve technically because of the limitations on the network. But yeah, I think to Clayton's point as well these things, I don't expect it to be an issue this cycle. I think price appreciation at least hopefully will support the network enough.
00:21:34.293 - 00:22:03.715, Speaker E: And yeah, I mean hash rate continues to grow. Right. Like it's very, it's only when we start entering bear markets do we see minor stress and a bit of capitulation there. So I think we're, we can talk about this, but I don't expect anything to really happen until we're in the like the real bottom of the next bear. And the miners are really crying because right now they can shout, but I don't think they're going to be shouting loud enough to actually really make any changes on the current roadmap, at least for the next three years or so.
00:22:07.415 - 00:22:42.245, Speaker C: I can just add briefly to this. I mean all three guys gave super comprehensive answers. I'm not going to go as in depth, but I think if you wanted to have this cynical glass half empty mentality towards L2s whether on ETH or on Bitcoin, you can, but Ultimately and especially for an L1 like Bitcoin, I think having L2s, like the amount of stuff you'll be able to do compared to what was possible to do on Bitcoin in previous cycle is just going to be such a huge improvement that I see as a net positive still.
00:22:46.385 - 00:23:38.145, Speaker A: Amazing guys, like amazing answers. This was like just to just for you guys to be aware, like this question was asked the same way on last Tuesday. Like we had two panels to promote the events. The script was very similar and this was a very common question between both spaces. And the answers, what pleasants me is that they were very, very similar. But there was something that was raised during the space which is also something that for me is a double edged sword which is the adoption of Bitcoin and even ethereum on the ETS. Because right now BlackRock and all those big giant companies are buying a shitten amount of Bitcoin and a huge amount of Ethereum which right now like they are just being held like they are not being used in the, in the market.
00:23:38.145 - 00:24:29.455, Speaker A: And although in the short term valuation this might be very good, I'm not really sure, as you guys just mentioned, if in the bear market what will be the impact of this. But I guess we'll just need to wait and see how it's gonna perform, right guys, thank you very much for answering this question. I believe everyone here already got a little bit of more insights on what to expect as the BTC5 grows on what impact this could have in the Bitcoin network. If anyone has any additional remarks to add to this, please let me know. If not, I would like them to shift our focus to devcon and Asia purpose for each one of your protocols. What do you think? Should we move forward? I'll take that as a yes.
00:24:29.575 - 00:24:30.687, Speaker D: Yeah, let's do it.
00:24:30.831 - 00:25:18.935, Speaker A: So guys, all of you are going to be in defcon or at least your protocols are going to be in devcon. I know that some of us are not going there due to like priorities or not having availability to travel to Thailand right now as it's the case for me. But I would like to ask you like if you are going there or if your protocol in general is going to be there. What are you most excited about for devcon? Like what are you hoping to achieve during your time in talents for the event? Is it community outreach? Is it meeting up with partners? Is it meeting up with investors? What's your goal? And by going to DEFCON in Thailand. Rp, I will let you take this one. You didn't have a lot of time to speak on the previous question. I'll let you take the lead on this one.
00:25:19.475 - 00:25:51.351, Speaker C: No worries. Yeah, so I'm not going to personally be a defcon, but we have several people from our team attending, including our founder Kevin. And I guess for us it's multipurpose participation, so to speak. So of course we want to meet with the community and like all the devs, but also we want to forge new partnerships. For sure we're going to have a lot of our existing partners there. So some of those guys we haven't met in person yet. So that's going to be a great opportunity.
00:25:51.351 - 00:26:31.685, Speaker C: We're participating at several events. We're going to be at ZK Hub, the BTC5 event for Incode Club. We're sponsoring a bouncy and then we're going to be hosting a nubit event as well. So we're trying to be as involved as possible. And if anyone is there and wants to meet with people from Goat Network, feel free to DM either me or our official account and I'll make sure to connect you. So yeah, super excited overall about this opportunity. We try to participate in as many conferences as possible as long as they're quality ones and DEFCON is as good as it can get.
00:26:34.515 - 00:27:16.245, Speaker A: 100% sir. Thank you very much. Really excited to have got network in the event and I'm excited to see what's gonna be your results from defcon. I'm really excited to see these upcoming next two, three weeks after defcon. We already had a pivotal moment this last week with the elections of the US which I don't want to dive into but of course we need to mention that it was pivotal for the crypto space. And I really believe that with devcon being the last big event of the year, a lot will be announced and a lot will be will change in the last two months of the year. Chris, do you want to go next Sir?
00:27:18.065 - 00:28:01.999, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean like it's going to be huge. I feel like everyone is going to devcon. So obviously there's going to be a lot of meeting with partners, I guess a lot with speaking about the election because of the timing. We have a few exciting events that we're doing. Obviously will be L2CON. We have a shark tank where basically people who want to do interesting stuff and want to get in front of investors can come to that and pitch basically and introduce themselves to investors and things like that. I mean, yeah, so I just side events, meeting people and then I mean who doesn't enjoy going to Bangkok? I think it's a really good location to go to and it'll be lots of fun.
00:28:01.999 - 00:28:08.835, Speaker D: So, I mean, all of that stuff, really looking forward to all of it. It'll be very, very, very busy, I imagine.
00:28:09.775 - 00:28:41.433, Speaker A: Perfect, sir. Obviously, Bangkok right now is one of the crypto hubs for, like, obviously there's a lot of activity there, but it's also a place in Asia of partying and also just having a fun time. So if you're going there, do take time to enjoy both. Maybe visit the countries if it's your first time going there, or if you just want to spend some free time visiting and knowing the culture. I believe it's a great country to know. Clayton. Sir.
00:28:41.433 - 00:28:42.445, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:28:44.745 - 00:29:23.275, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm actually currently in Bangkok, and I've been here since the 5th. So Babylon is actually wrapping up its hacker house tomorrow. We had about 100 builders, like, over this week, which has been good. Outside of that, I mean, it's mostly just BDSM for me. So, like, you know, business development, sales and marketing, like, meeting a lot of people in person, doing a lot of speaking events, things like that, you know, pretty standard. I think a lot of our early network participants are primarily based in this region, so, you know, catching up with those folks will be good. But.
00:29:23.275 - 00:29:38.375, Speaker B: But overall, it's. It's just, you know, meeting integration partners, meeting, you know, people that want to leverage Babylon security, meeting our LST issuers, and then meeting, you know, unique folks in the supply side of the market as well.
00:29:39.715 - 00:29:44.655, Speaker A: Perfect, sir. Jordan, last but not least. Go ahead, sir.
00:29:47.675 - 00:30:15.371, Speaker E: Yeah, similar to Clayton, really. Like, I've actually been here for coming up to a week now as well. There was like, a lot. A lot of people were in Chiang Mai, which is in Northern Thailand, over the past various weeks actually for, like, kind of. Yeah, a lot of the people who are more nomadic in the space were up there just working together and what have you. So I went to join them for a few days before back in Bangkok. And for me, like, just on a personal note, it's like my first time in Thailand, so it's pretty cool to be here.
00:30:15.371 - 00:30:46.145, Speaker E: And as a Westerner, it's a bit of a shock to the senses. I'm now getting on the back of a moped to work every day effectively, which is pretty crazy. And, yeah, so there's a bunch of stuff going on, like the staking summit happening today and tomorrow, and then next week's calendar is just. It's a bit like token 2049 where there's just like crazy almost too many events. I'm still, yeah it's impossible to make them all. So I'm just going to be like ping ponging around all day or week basically. So it's gonna be very busy.
00:30:46.145 - 00:31:19.019, Speaker E: But it's always, it's always good to see a lot of friends in the space that obviously when you work in the space for over years you get to know a lot of people and a lot of the kind of existing partners we have but also meeting new partners as well. Like that's one of the cool things I guess working at Symbolic is that we can, you know, we can work with so many different entities. So it's nice to learn about new projects, how they're, you know what's. Just get an idea of what's new in the space and then also trying to figure out like how and if we can collaborate. So yeah, it's like I said, gonna be a pretty, pretty hectic couple of weeks.
00:31:19.067 - 00:31:27.975, Speaker A: Perfect sir, thank you very much. Just to clarify. So have you already written to your work on a moped or. You said that you didn't.
00:31:28.915 - 00:31:46.101, Speaker E: Right, right. No, I have. So the pat. Yeah, Yesterday I got into Bangkok and then obviously I got the normal cab from as in a car from the airport with my suitcase but then now I was taking summits on. I've been going back and forth there. You literally just hop on the back of a moped. You hope that they have a helmet that they can give you and then.
00:31:46.101 - 00:32:02.283, Speaker E: Yeah, but it's, it saves so much time because the traffic here is terrible. And so like when I hopped on yesterday it said half an hour on Google Maps but it literally took us maybe like it was less than 20 minutes just because the moped can just weave in and out of traffic. So it's super efficient but it's a bit sketchy. I'm not going to lie.
00:32:02.429 - 00:32:23.195, Speaker A: Guys, you, you already heard the dial for here. If you are going to Bangkok for devcon, you already know how to travel from each side. To go on a moped it might be a little bit sketchy. I would advise you guys to ask for a helmet but it's probably the faster way to travel from each side. Guys, thank you very much for, for sharing that. Yeah, go ahead rp.
00:32:24.455 - 00:32:33.865, Speaker C: I was gonna say be super, super careful. Last time I was in Thailand and on a moped unfortunately that ended up in an accident. Still alive but yeah, never fun.
00:32:34.025 - 00:32:59.355, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Guys obviously don't take this as advice like yeah, we are just joking around obviously if you want to ride on moped please do but always need to be careful. I actually know someone that also is in Bangkok right now and on driving a moped also had an accident so might not be the best way to travel or the most secure. It might be the fastest so you need to handle here the risk reward ratio.
00:33:00.815 - 00:33:02.635, Speaker C: Thailand roads are dangerous.
00:33:03.775 - 00:33:14.575, Speaker A: Like it should be fun though. Fun week for everyone that is going to be in Bangkok. Guys, just wrap up this. Okay. We have been here for almost 40 minutes. I only have one last question. Okay.
00:33:14.575 - 00:33:48.165, Speaker A: Which is about the roadmap and future plans of each of your protocols. There were two questions, I'm going to bundle them up into one and the question is what are some of your upcoming milestone milestones for each of you and are there any features or updates in the pipeline that you can share with us that you are particularly excited about? I'll let you guys go. Go for like. I don't want to invite anyone to talk about this. I just want to see which one of you is excited to share some offer about this.
00:33:49.635 - 00:34:11.403, Speaker E: I can just jump in quickly here. For us it's pretty short and sweet. We've had a full protocol build out for a little while now. It's been tested thoroughly so our main end is right around the corner. So that's kind of the next big step for us. And yeah, obviously it's just super exciting getting a protocol live. But yeah, we have snatching, we have rewards, we have native token staking, we are a feature complete restaking platform.
00:34:11.403 - 00:34:28.030, Speaker E: So it's just going to be very nice to have shared security restaking live on the Ethereum side to see how we can make the ecosystem grow and actually start putting the theory to the test. So yeah, I guess stay tuned for that.
00:34:28.142 - 00:34:32.594, Speaker A: Is this going to be announced during devcon or is it still under wraps?
00:34:36.294 - 00:35:05.767, Speaker E: Honestly, it's still under wraps, but it's not like I'm giving away massive alpha here. People know that we've been maintained ready for a while. What we have said though is that the reason why we haven't launched is because the networks, the businesses that are building on top of us, we want to make sure that they're ready. We don't want to launch on mainnet without actually any restaking going on under the hood. So we're just waiting for a couple more of our partners to finish their audits on their code and then we'll be hitting the deploy button. So yeah, it's coming.
00:35:05.831 - 00:35:20.195, Speaker A: Perfect. So thank you for sharing that. Really, really excited Also waiting for you guys to increase some of your caps. I want to add some more liquidity myself. So this is something that I'm waiting for. But thank you sir. Thank you for sharing that rp.
00:35:20.195 - 00:35:24.875, Speaker A: Sorry, whoever wants to go next.
00:35:25.455 - 00:36:14.765, Speaker C: Yeah, I can go next, no problem. Happy to go next. So what makes us the most excited is our main net launch, which I cannot give the exact date, but it's going to be this quarter. And what makes this launch special is that we're not just launching alone, we're going to have several day one partners that are going to go live with us. So it's going to be a complete ecosystem. Well, I maybe wouldn't say complete because that's going to be always work in progress and we always want to get better, but it's going to be a place where you can actually do a lot of things with your BTC from day one. I'm thinking stuff like using all the yield opportunities, different applications, gamify all of that stuff that's also going to be built with bitcoin security at a core.
00:36:14.765 - 00:36:51.715, Speaker C: And then to support this we're going to have Founders Club, which is essentially our internal ecosystem program incentive program where we actively onboarding builders. And because of these incentives, we're essentially going to have a launch that's going to be aligned for everyone. So for builders, for users, for bitcoin holders. So that's our big milestone that we're all looking forward to internally and our community. So if you want to know when exactly we go live, make sure to follow the official account and you'll be able to get more info there.
00:36:53.015 - 00:37:20.969, Speaker A: Guys, you already have the call to action here. You have the shout out do follow Goat network. They are going to be launching their main net very, very soon this quarter still. And from our, from what our pages shared here with us, you're going to have a lot of depth to use your funds on, man. Thank you very much for sharing that alpha. Who wants to go next? We have two people left. Clayton, Chris.
00:37:20.969 - 00:37:23.125, Speaker A: Okay, Chris already went ahead. Go ahead, Chris.
00:37:23.705 - 00:38:16.539, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, so obviously mainnet's already live. We did the super chain announcement recently in the hybrid L2 paper sort of stuff. So I mean currently 170,000 unique users, 100 mil on chain, around 100 projects. Phase two is basically getting the bitvm2 bridge up and running so that we have an ETH L2 with Bitcoin finality. We should have the prototype end of this year and a live testnet where you can actually test out the bridge for Ethan for next year and then after that actually having a bitcoin roll up where we do fraud proofs on Bitcoin and just fully inherit Bitcoin security and then obviously partnerships within infrastructure. So it's actually a chain that can be used by significant power users and significant amounts of liquidity.
00:38:16.539 - 00:38:29.745, Speaker D: So closing a few things in the custody space that you'll see in the next couple months and also in the kind of larger a list lending protocols that you should see beginning of next year.
00:38:30.405 - 00:38:41.345, Speaker A: Perfect. Chris, thank you very much for sharing the Alpha here on build on Bitcoin on Bob Clayton. Last but not least, sir, what's the alpha on Babylon?
00:38:43.565 - 00:39:28.995, Speaker B: Yeah, so I, I mean we do want to, you know, offer folks an ability to stake again here soon. So you know we, we have about 1.8 billion in BTC staked currently over the span of 2 caps. The window has been like roughly like 2 hours. And so we, we do want to have an opportunity that you know, is a little bit longer and then you know, announcing something sometime this quarter for that and then preparation for mainnet launch which we're targeting for Q1 of next year. But wish I could share more things but unfortunately I can't be super detailed at this point in time.
00:39:29.155 - 00:39:37.735, Speaker A: It's still everything under wraps. Do we might hear any big update during devcon or. You cannot even share that.
00:39:41.315 - 00:39:44.243, Speaker B: Not. Not publicly. We're not doing any events here.
00:39:44.299 - 00:39:49.745, Speaker A: Okay, so you had your echo house during this finishing tomorrow, right?
00:39:51.325 - 00:39:51.717, Speaker B: Yep.
00:39:51.741 - 00:40:14.551, Speaker A: Okay. Yep, Perfect sir. Thank you very much. Excited to see you guys opening your caps again and also very excited to see the mainnet launch. Okay. I believe this is going to be big for everyone in the space and if I'm not wrong, like almost here is working somehow together for a partnership or for any integration. Guys, that's a wrap for today.
00:40:14.551 - 00:40:42.283, Speaker A: Okay. To the speakers. Thank you very much for joining us and give us a little bit of your time just to share some of your insights and some of your alpha about the protocols to all the listeners. I hope you enjoyed the space. I hope you were able to learn something new or just get a little bit of offer from each of the protocols. And guys, I wish you the best weekend. Okay, we have our event on the 11th is already next week on Monday.
00:40:42.283 - 00:41:13.655, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly on Monday. We have DEFCON starting very, very soon. We have already a lot of events happening in Bangkok, so if you guys are around, do come to our event. Okay? Please try to meet as many people as possible and as a final shout out, please don't forget to follow here. Our amazing guest speakers follow their protocols and I guess I'll see you guys next week. To everyone, thank you very much. I hope you have the best weekend and I'll see you guys in the in real life event.
