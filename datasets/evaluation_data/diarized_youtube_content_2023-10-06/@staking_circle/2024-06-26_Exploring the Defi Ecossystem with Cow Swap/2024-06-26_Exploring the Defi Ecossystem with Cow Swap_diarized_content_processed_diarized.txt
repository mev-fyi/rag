00:00:01.800 - 00:00:17.965, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello everyone. Welcome to another sticking Circle Spaces. It's a pleasure to have today here with us, Cal Swap. And to represent Cow Swap, we do have. Alex. Alex, can I just do a quick mic check with you before we do kickstart the space?
00:00:18.505 - 00:00:21.313, Speaker B: Yes. Can you hear me? Hello, Hello.
00:00:21.449 - 00:00:25.409, Speaker A: Yep, Loud and clear. Loud and clear. Welcome Alex. How are you man? Everything all right?
00:00:25.497 - 00:00:28.845, Speaker B: Good, everything good in San Spain. What about you?
00:00:30.305 - 00:00:32.585, Speaker A: Fine, fine, fine. Where are you from?
00:00:32.665 - 00:00:33.605, Speaker B: From Spain.
00:00:34.825 - 00:00:42.005, Speaker A: Oh, you're nearby? I'm speaking from Portugal. So you're pretty close by. No reason for Twitter to rug us today.
00:00:42.385 - 00:00:47.645, Speaker B: True, but you never know because Twitter is not very Euro friendly. Smart America.
00:00:48.825 - 00:01:16.237, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly, exactly. So man, thank you very much for accepting the invite. Just a small note, I'm sending an invitation for Carl D to be our co host here. So are up with us on the panel and all our listeners can follow Cowswap. So please make sure you are connected on mobile with the account from the protocol and you will be able to join me in here. Me and you of course here in the panel. But yeah, in the meantime, let's start.
00:01:16.237 - 00:01:29.685, Speaker A: So Alex, we always like to start by getting an understanding of who you are and of course what you have been doing in crypto. So can you tell us a bit more about your background and how long have you been working in the space?
00:01:29.805 - 00:02:07.675, Speaker B: Yeah, so my background is in finance. I was working at consulting before I actually made the switch to crypto full time. I was always intrigued by kind of crypto and blockchain. So when I was in banking, I was focused a little bit on the blockchain enterprise side of things. But it was of course way too early. And then back in 2020 I had the awesome opportunity to actually join the Gnosis family. And before cows was in the making? No, it was brewing, but it wasn't already live.
00:02:07.675 - 00:02:35.175, Speaker B: But six months after I joined Gnosis, we actually launched Cow Swap and then it got traction. So we started the whole spin off process from Gnosis Dao to actually Cao Dao. And now since working for Cow Dao as a contributor, I've been basically focusing on the product marketing side of things as well as the business and partnerships aspect.
00:02:37.235 - 00:02:44.307, Speaker A: Okay, so you started in 2020, right on the peak of the last bull run. How was the bear market for you?
00:02:44.411 - 00:03:03.885, Speaker B: It was good. I mean it was definitely different. Interesting. You know, it's like anything in life, what they say is true. You see the true faces of people in the darkest times. Right. So in here it's the same kind of you Saw who was here, for what and for what reasons.
00:03:03.885 - 00:03:20.485, Speaker B: And you know, cards were upside down, like flipped so everyone could see everyone's cards. And actually, I mean the ones that stayed have maintained their position and things have evolved into a better, better outcome.
00:03:22.025 - 00:03:44.787, Speaker A: Nice, nice, nice. So thank you for that to this, for this small intro. I think we've got a lot to unravel here. So I'd like to start out at a very high level and then progressively dive into the weeds of coswap. And your approach on building the first trading interface build on top of COW protocol. So let's take a step back. Cowswap is presenting the first trading interface built on top of protocol.
00:03:44.787 - 00:03:48.859, Speaker A: Would you mind if we start with a general background on what COW protocol is?
00:03:48.907 - 00:05:06.025, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So COW protocol is the first trading protocol to actually leverage intents in Ethereum. When we launched this in 2020, maybe the word wasn't the now so famous word intense because we actually call them intents to trade or kind of gasless trades. But the whole idea was that we were going to leverage batch options to actually achieve better settlements for the users. Because if you treat the users kind of orders in a multi dimension instead of in a single dimension, there are a lot of upsides and optimizations that you can do to disorders. So the whole idea was to create a protocol that would actually batch orders into a single auction and then have this competition of solvers who would compete to win the right to settle the orders. And within this competition, the solver that won would actually be the one that would settle these intent to trades either with a private liquidity on chain liquidity or any other means like peer to peer orders that the users would want it to do.
00:05:07.845 - 00:05:20.557, Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much for that. Now taking a deeper look into. It's kind of difficult to say both words in a row. How does it work?
00:05:20.661 - 00:05:55.875, Speaker B: Yeah, so cow swap is your common dex interface, let's say where you kind of like you're used to what you're seeing. And from there what you basically do is you sign an order that says that I am willing to accept me selling my token A for my token B. And then from there you, this order gets registered into the actual order book protocol and then it's passed on to these solvers for them to find the most optimal route for settlement.
00:05:57.645 - 00:06:08.305, Speaker A: Okay, you, I was trying that. You said these keywords. So you identify yourselves as a methodex aggregator. What's a methodex aggregator? Can you explain?
00:06:08.685 - 00:07:19.769, Speaker B: So the whole point of the metadex aggregator, right, is that before, when you leverage an aggregator, you're basically bound to how good this aggregator is on the specific kind of algorithm that they have. So this means that for example, not to pick, but just to pick the major kind of competitor. Right. If you are trading on 1 inch, 1 inch might be very good for certain token pairs, but might be worse off in comparison to Matcha or Parasoft in other set of tokens. So this means that if you're trading on just on one inch, you're actually not taking the upside of the aggregator kind of mentality. Mentality. So what we proposed was the whole system of having this be this sort of method X, whereas you have each individual solver that is tapping into a specific aggregate or API and therefore where you connect to Couchwap and request a quote, you're actually getting exposed to all the single aggregators all at once this way.
00:07:19.769 - 00:07:53.585, Speaker B: Right. You're kind of, you know that in the event that, in the event that the tokens that you're trading Parasol might be better off that 1 inch your cover because you're also asking Parasol for a quote and vice versa. Right. If given that maybe Matcha is better than what's called than Carswap, then you're also covered by that. And this is the whole idea of the Metadex kind of mentality. It's like a layer on top of the aggregators that aggregates them all.
00:07:55.525 - 00:08:00.037, Speaker A: But you guys also use math technology on your swaps, correctly?
00:08:00.101 - 00:09:04.945, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, correct. So the whole point from that angle is that basically instead of having the users be the ones that execute transactions, basically what we have is this, as he mentioned, this system of solvers that compete for the right to set up the user's order. And basically these solvers are the ones responsible for executing the orders on chain, and then the solver that wins is the one that gets to submit. And these solvers are bound to submit all these orders based on the fact that all the orders must be ME protected. So with the right settings, and also with the fact that all the orders must follow this thing known as uniform clearing prices, for which all the trades within a batch clear at the same price and therefore make reordering the transactions within the batch irrelevant.
00:09:07.645 - 00:09:33.535, Speaker A: Okay, I'm kind of confused. So basically when a user uses your dex, he basically entitles a MEV robot to do the swap for him on the best, like fee or not considering fees, but on the best, most efficient way possible, using the best routers. Is it correct or am I confusing stuff here?
00:09:34.595 - 00:10:00.835, Speaker B: You're confusing a little bit the terminology because it's not that you kind of give green light for a mapbot, right? In this case you are just. It's a similar concept, but it's not a methbot. It's just this party that optimizes based on like similar to a meth bot. Like it optimizes the stuff, but it's not. It's always for your win. It's never gonna go against you.
00:10:01.975 - 00:10:12.929, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, of course that part. I had figured it out. Okay. But I guess I understood. And what's the. Sorry, what is the. The term Coincidence of what's.
00:10:12.929 - 00:10:19.081, Speaker A: Of ones. Which basically creates your acronym COW referred to.
00:10:19.153 - 00:11:20.421, Speaker B: Yeah. So coincidence of ONES is this economic phenomena where two parties hold what each other want. So the most simple way to understand it is, you know, if you. If we're trading on the same batch and for example, you're selling ETH for USDC and I'm trying to buy ETH with usdc, then we all have the each other's wants, right? I have the USDC that you actually want and you have the ETH that I actually want. So what coincidence of wants signifies is that through our patch auction system, through our trading mechanism, right, we're able to get match in a peer to peer fashion. Because we're not kind of saying to the exchange, to the exchange, to the Dex or to the kind of router, hey, you need to settle me here in this way against this type of user. But rather you're saying, hey, I just want this amount of ETH or this amount of usdc.
00:11:20.421 - 00:11:49.575, Speaker B: Now you kind of propose to me what the best execution for this is. And this is where the whole thing comes in. Hello? Hello?
00:11:50.315 - 00:12:08.585, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, I was muted. I was posing a question. I was muted. Sorry, I was asking about the security measures you do implement. So what security measures do you have in place right now to make sure the users can safely use Cowswap and basically use your protocol?
00:12:10.365 - 00:13:30.485, Speaker B: Not sure I follow the question. In terms of security measures like what would you. I mean every. The cool thing is that the users aren't really exposed to anything because to leverage everything that's COW protocol has to offer, you only need to approve the COW protocol smart contract. So in the event that you want to trade some new token that the server might have to do, let the one that's doing the approval on your behalf so that you don't have to worry about this approval that you've done on with your wallet. And within the cloud protocol settlement contract itself, the transactions are not able to ignite as long they can do it if the result that the solvers propose is less than the limit price that you signed via the order. So actually there is a double verification system in which the settlement contract validates that you actually made the correct signature and also that you are the owner of such funds.
00:13:31.225 - 00:13:54.785, Speaker A: Okay, makes full sense. Thank you for that. Now Alex, if you allow me, I would like to dive in to the more degen part of our space. So talking about what the users usually want to hear. So if you allow me to ask, do you guys have any token and if so, what's their role within the cow DAO ecosystem?
00:13:55.125 - 00:14:40.635, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do have a token. It's called cow is a decision to name and the role within the ecosystem of the cow token. It's first to control the direction of the cow dao. Right. So basically like have a say on where the DAO is going, what the DAO is doing, and of any possible revenue that it might generate through these products. Then also what's called duel. And then another part in which for the token is actually used is for incentivizing the solver competition.
00:14:40.635 - 00:14:51.965, Speaker B: So each solver gets rewarded cow tokens for settling correctly the right batch.
00:14:54.585 - 00:15:18.045, Speaker A: So basically you have like a governance model under your token. Do you also will you also have a V model? So for instance, having. Implementing a V model to boost liquidity pools or for users to vote on different liquidity pools where they would like to have extra rewards or not.
00:15:18.725 - 00:15:29.541, Speaker B: So this is possible, but it's something for the DAO to bottom and decide. It's something that we haven't actually played around with yet, but definitely is something.
00:15:29.613 - 00:15:48.425, Speaker A: That is doable and like the emissions that you guys have, how do they occur? Is your token all out already or is it like slowly getting emitted along with the like the validations on the chain?
00:15:50.005 - 00:16:36.065, Speaker B: It's so basically the way it goes is that we, the DAO did the airdrop with the initial TGE and from there certain chunk of the emissions were set via. Via everything. Right, via what you called. I don't have the English word. Now the vestings and all that were already done. And then every six months, more or less, the DAO gets a vote on how much is the solver budget, how much of the tokens are we actually allocating for the solver competition.
00:16:36.645 - 00:16:57.935, Speaker A: Okay, okay, okay, that seems pretty fair and quite interesting, to be honest. Thank you very much for enlightening us on that end. So like, how can users get higher yields and higher rewards with Your protocol, do you have any staking system applied to your token? How does it work?
00:16:59.835 - 00:17:25.225, Speaker B: No, basically like the, I mean you have other, what you call other ways in which, you know, there are other protocols that actually offer yield with the token or whatever. But within the DAO itself, this is something that besides the liquidity incentives that you have on Balancer and whatever, you don't, you don't have.
00:17:26.445 - 00:17:41.685, Speaker A: Nice, nice, nice, nice man. Thank you very much. I think you gave us a pretty insightful overview of what is the cow swap. I don't know if there's anything you would like to highlight regarding the protocol or anything else.
00:17:42.745 - 00:18:10.585, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, in general, just to highlight that cow protocol is sort of the best way to get exposed to everything all at once. If you're interested in not having to worry, as in, you know, which is the best venue to get the best price for this top token, whether it being like a normal token or let's say like a liquidity providing token, then cow protocol is, is your friend because the solvers are just going to do all the hard work on your behalf.
00:18:11.525 - 00:18:49.245, Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much, Alex. It was a pleasure hosting you and I think it gave us a pretty good and insightful overview of Kaoudao. I do want to explore more so I will be a tester of the protocol and the user. So yeah, I'll probably come back with questions for you if I do have them. I'm quite used to using some dexes and so I'm pretty sure I'll grasp everything, everything from there. Moreover, like any final remark you would like to leave for the audience, where can they follow you? How can they stay connected to everything you're doing? Let us know.
00:18:50.425 - 00:19:15.675, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean Twitter is the best place to follow me and also both the protocol cow swap we actually like. While we were on the talk, we just launched a major rebrand for making Caldao more understandable and you know, actually easier to grasp the different product lines that Cloud Dao is tackling and yeah, this is all I have.
00:19:17.215 - 00:19:54.513, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much, Alex. Was a pleasure. So you already know guys, Kaoudao is in the space. Listeners, you can check me probably on your mobile, they will be on the top, you can visit their page, get on the scoop with everything new they are releasing. Once again, Alex, thank you very much for joining this small deep dive session. It's always a pleasure for us to introduce new protocols and new systems here to our audience. As you guys know, just a final reminder, you will have two events in ECC both LRT Summit, LRT Summer and BTC Summit.
00:19:54.513 - 00:20:15.619, Speaker A: You can look into our Twitter profile as well to find the latest on the events. The latest sponsors have already been out. We have a pretty Pack Alpha ready for you guys, so don't forget to stay tuned. Once again, Alex, thank you very much and cheers. This is taking circle and I hope you get back next week. Cheers.
00:20:15.667 - 00:20:17.155, Speaker B: Thank you. Cheers. Bye.
