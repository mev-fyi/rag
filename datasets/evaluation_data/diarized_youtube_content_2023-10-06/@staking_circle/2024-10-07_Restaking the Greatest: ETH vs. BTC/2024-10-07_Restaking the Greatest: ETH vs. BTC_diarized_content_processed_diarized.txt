00:00:07.720 - 00:00:23.205, Speaker A: Okay, so we are going to start the second panel right now. So I'm going to ask for each of our panelists to just say a few words to say who do you work for, what you do and who you are and then we kick start with the questions.
00:00:25.105 - 00:01:10.733, Speaker B: It's a great pleasure to be here. Here's Chris and I work for Stakestone. Just a slight reminder on behalf of Rose, the CSO for Stack Zone to participate in this panel. Unfortunately she has some issues with her thoughts and yeah, basically it's a great pleasure to be here. And some short introductions of stakes. We are a protocol focusing on issuing liquid assets, liquid Ethereum, liquid Bitcoin. On the one side it helps to cover LP's opportunity cost through staking and restaking and on the other side is unlocked liquidity and unlimited use cases on the application layers and brought the users and lps with more potentials and yield opportunities.
00:01:10.733 - 00:01:12.825, Speaker B: Thanks, it's a great pleasure to be here.
00:01:13.765 - 00:01:18.185, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Nader Dabat, I'm the director of developer relations at Eigen Labs.
00:01:19.205 - 00:01:40.725, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Moko, I'm the co founder@stakemods.com we've been aggregating data for proof of stake and staking since 2018 and are now offering staking directly on our website as well. We just launched with Babylon and Lombard so you can stake from several different chains, assets and any staking providers from our website.
00:01:43.945 - 00:01:54.895, Speaker E: Hey, I'm Walter, I'm a data science lead at Gauntlet. We're a leading crypto economic research firm specializing in quantitative optimization and modeling at the forefront of DeFi.
00:01:56.715 - 00:02:10.055, Speaker F: Hello, I'm Amadeo Brands, co founder of Yieldnest and we built a liquid restaking protocol that risk adjusted the highest yield across all the restaking protocols and different defi primitives.
00:02:10.795 - 00:02:22.815, Speaker A: Perfect, Perfect. So for the first question, I will not ask you to explain what restaking is because I'm sure that everyone knows. But if you sell Restaking in one sentence, how do you sell it?
00:02:25.195 - 00:02:34.935, Speaker B: I think for us it's pretty straightforward. That is you are getting a new opportunity cost for Ethereum, so why not cover it?
00:02:37.795 - 00:02:47.375, Speaker C: The way I look at it, it's just a way to power a better developer platform for developers to build verifiable services.
00:02:48.875 - 00:03:13.255, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say restaking is basically security and decentralization out of the box. It's like crypto. Crypto's value proposition is to cut out the middleman and provide decentralized systems that are more efficient. And restaking basically does that to any network As a service without the cumbersome and all the way of bootstrapping all of this kind of system.
00:03:15.135 - 00:03:28.715, Speaker E: Yeah, I can add on to that. Yeah. Let's suppose we all like tokens, right? Let's say I want to launch an L1, you know, I got to bootstrap this somehow. Yeah, Rest taking helps me lower my inflation curve basically.
00:03:30.055 - 00:03:58.215, Speaker F: Yeah, I agreed with what everybody just said and I think it's the, it's actually from Eigen layer. It's a Ford economic paradigm where we can actually secure and risk underwrite different services also outside of blockchains and we can build new systems as Nader also just highlighted. So we can build new crypto economic systems in a more easier way. And I see a lot of new possibilities that we still need to figure out together.
00:03:58.955 - 00:04:20.985, Speaker A: Perfect, perfect. Love the answers. So for the first more in depth question about mass adoption. So crypto is still far away from mass adoption, but what do you think about restaking? Can restaking be mass adopt? Yes or no? What do you think? And if not, what can we actually bring to the, to the users, to the masses that are outside of this niche?
00:04:22.925 - 00:05:14.617, Speaker B: I think it's a great question, but standing on the side of a stake. So I think for the mass adoption probably there's two aspects. The first is about clients of restaking that is to get the shared security. We spoke with many ecosystems and application chain builders. They think it makes absolute sense to bootstrap their, to bootstrap their security with taping into race staking and so I think it's going to be a general trend for that and for the users. To be honest, I think most of the users are being raised acres even without noticing that. So this actually thanks to the gateways of doing racetakings like Yield Nest, also like Stakestone and also at the inception network tees there are many perfect gateways to onboard many, many users to become racetakers without the end users even realizing that.
00:05:14.617 - 00:05:30.165, Speaker B: So I think basically on the user side and also on the clients for the shared security side we can also see the trend as well. But we really actually expecting the next milestone for shared security to happen.
00:05:32.625 - 00:06:44.319, Speaker C: I feel like mass adoption will probably start at the app layer and I think we've already kind of seen the how a lot of the newer wallets and SDKs are enabling social login, oauth passkeys, things like that paired with high performance, high throughput, low cost networks. I think now that we're kind of getting there then you can kind of talk about potential of Mass adoption and where it wasn't even, maybe even possible before, the way this might fit in. I think if you listen to the Sriram talk, he often mentions this idea of verifiable SaaS software as a service. At AWS where I worked for about three and a half years, we had hundreds of services that were there that people that wanted to build an application could just compose to build out their idea and they just focus on their core business logic. In AWS we did the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing all the underlying infrastructure. I think in the future what we're going to have is essentially a marketplace of services that developers have built that enable them to build out higher quality applications and to experiment faster. I think the more experimentation, the more things that people are able to try out, the higher the chance that someone builds something that actually gets users.
00:06:44.319 - 00:06:55.275, Speaker C: And I think that where this fits in, it just lowers the barrier to entry for developers to build out those services. At that point application developers have more choices to kind of build out their new ideas.
00:06:56.255 - 00:07:35.461, Speaker D: Yeah, for mass adoption obviously there's two things. There's the supply side of capital and security and then the, yeah, the demand side of like for networks and AVs or services to like decentralize with restaking. And I think on that side it needs to be super, super easy for those teams to like just kind of, yeah, basically click a button and then decentralize as a service. Like it's very simple in AWS and so on to like yeah, just host something and it must be as easy as this. And I think right now that's still lagging. Right. It's, it's not as straightforward and there's uncertainties and it's not that you just kind of decentralized out of the box.
00:07:35.461 - 00:08:12.635, Speaker D: There's a lot of kind of things that you have to consider and you still need to be relatively savvy and so on to really do that. So if you want every single app on the Internet to be decentralized and yeah like we really need to improve on that side. And then in terms of the capital, I guess we don't really need mass adoption necessarily for like everyone and their mom to restake. It's more like yeah, we need the big institutions to deploy capital and there needs to be community around the networks. What's really important I think to generate hype and nurture the communities.
00:08:14.255 - 00:08:38.085, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess I can add on to that. Yeah, mass adoption can be quite two dimensional in that perspective. You have the magnitude of assets being restaked and you have sort of the various types of assets. Right. Like the general trend nowadays is for any asset to be able to be restaked. You see that in all the restaking marketplaces these days. Yeah, so that's on the side, supply side, like Marco said.
00:08:38.085 - 00:09:08.355, Speaker E: Of course, you have on the demand side as well. We can add on to what Nader said as well. I personally really like the Eigenda developments over the past couple of months. I really like seeing all the raw hashes from all the chains being posted. And clearly that's just a huge example of what the scalability potential of a secondary service on top of restaking what that can actually be. And that also serves as a pristine example for all the other developers out there. It's like, hey, this is a model we can strive towards.
00:09:08.355 - 00:09:13.075, Speaker E: What is the actual ceiling? Is there even a ceiling for what we can build?
00:09:15.335 - 00:10:25.135, Speaker F: Yeah, I agree. I think we have a lot of work to do until we get a lot of applications that will kind of generate a lot of like those yields that we want and think what needs to happen. Like all those, we need to be able to trade risks with each other and then these risks need to be liquid and then we can basically build a better market for risk and better that people trade risks with one another. And I think we need to move away from just network security also, like to more economic security and just open that up fully and then make sure that we get people to build on that. I think personally that if we get insurance markets or other bigger markets to open up and to see how they can use restake capital or to risk on the right capital, then we potentially get mass adoption. When people understand how to like, oh, we can actually, I can use my money to stake it in that specific risk and make a little bit more return. When people start to understand how that works, then we get into potentially mass adoption.
00:10:25.135 - 00:10:43.545, Speaker F: But that will probably come with a lot of swings in the market, I would say. So a lot of work to do. But I think we can get to mass adoption because I do think we can outcompete the traditional financial markets in capital structuring with restaking or defi.
00:10:44.885 - 00:10:53.773, Speaker A: So it's a lot about education, right? So you need to educate everyone, every user that they need to restake, how to restake, et cetera, to bring more and more people. Right.
00:10:53.909 - 00:11:13.195, Speaker F: Well, right now it's not ready. Right. So I think we have a lot of building to do before educating it, but we do need to educate a lot of the builders and then build really Cool stuff. And then wrap these assets in more understandable products and then release that and show how we are better than basically the legacy market.
00:11:13.355 - 00:11:34.095, Speaker A: Absolutely, I agree 100%. So the next question is actually pretty much a follow up on this. So the staking and restaking ecosystem has evolved a lot from the academic concepts to the points mania. Now btc. And so how do you see the future for restaking? And as a follow up questions for the ones doing btc, why btc? Shared security actually matters.
00:11:36.395 - 00:12:23.711, Speaker B: Yes, this actually is a very interesting question. As said for stick zone we focus on building liquid assets like blood flowing the vessels. So we ourselves actually don't quite basically in house the staking stuff or rest taking stuff. For example for the last panel on the Ethereum side we work basically with. On Ethereum side basically we can work with validators etc. And yeah basically we have other partners who work for us in terms of dealing the staking and restaking we don't do it ourselves. And for the bitcoin stuff, maxim from Lombard we have a good conversations and if we're going to do bitcoin restaking they will handle this for us.
00:12:23.711 - 00:13:16.465, Speaker B: But I wanted to share a bit from the assets perspective why we think it's different for bitcoin than anything to be reinstate. And I think the narrative for bitcoin staking I think it's no restaking staking is kind of sexy because you have the general logic that bitcoin is a very large and trusted assets. Why not turning pure proof of work to pow to pos? It's a good trend. But yeah, let's see, let's see. So this is also the reason why we have two bitcoin product that is already launched that one is focused on liquid, another is focused on yield bearing and the yield definitely comes from the bitrole staking etc. But also at the same time we're going to keep on doing staking and restaking with our partners like eigenlayer for sure to cover users opportunity costs while we focusing on putting more use cases for the assets.
00:13:19.165 - 00:13:52.455, Speaker C: Bitcoin restaking is interesting because it kind of provides more utility to what is the most pristine like crypto asset in the world. And it enables programmability where it wasn't there before, which is really really awesome. And I think restaking is here to stay because it just brings utility to literally every token that exists. Where people in the past may have just been speculating, only now you can actually put that to work and it's going to affect everything. In my opinion. Kind of like going forward, every new L1 is going to probably implement that. And that's where we're of already seeing, I think.
00:13:55.715 - 00:14:36.545, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Bitcoin restaking is interesting because the restaking and always services and networks would always tend to like get the biggest, most stable assets to secure their network. So Bitcoin is obviously super interesting because it is still like, yeah, way bigger than Ethereum and makes like a perfect collateral to stake. The only problem is there's still a lot of challenges to make it actually accessible for networks and services. It's not available in a trustless manner on Ethereum. And yeah, there's basically trust assumptions and challenges that they still need to overcome. But apart from that, I think Bitcoin is a perfect, even better collateral than E's probably to stake.
00:14:39.285 - 00:15:58.065, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think all the panelists brought up really good points. The idea of BTC collateral in general for shared security is I think very important as well. Despite there being a perception of a glut or an excess of crypto economic security right now, continued deposits in the staking ecosystem remain really important because we will always have some sort of withdrawal rate, some sort of stake decay I guess is the best way to call it within the ecosystem. And if you can't like sort of incentivize deposits, if you can't give people a real reason to sort of put that passive capital work, eventually there might be some medium or some, I guess some trajectory along the thousands or millions of possible ways the future could sort of unfold where there's a real risk of like stake loss. And of course Gauntlet's done a lot of work on the reflexitivity of that state loss and how one instance of slashing can cause multiple instances of slashing down the road. So yeah, this BTC cloud really helps unlock this new dimension. And I don't want to use the word insurance because that's not really what it is, but it provides a huge buffer and an additional source for a lot of this security derived from.
00:16:00.815 - 00:16:35.803, Speaker F: Yeah, I think Bitcoin is also really good collateral for restaking into. I would not say on Bitcoin itself, but I would say like the best L2 for Bitcoin, I always say, is Ethereum. And I think restaking Bitcoin on Ethereum or on other restaking protocols makes a lot of sense. I do have question marks on restaking on Bitcoin itself. How do you trade off those security guarantees? But I do think using Bitcoin as collateral in restaking protocols makes perfect sense to me.
00:16:35.899 - 00:17:11.035, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. Now looking at the risks exactly like many of you were talking about, like there is so many questions unanswered. Right. So in terms of risks, how do you see the weaknesses of BTC and have we learned can we bring any lessons from the Ethereum ecosystem to the BTC one and can we actually leverage some of these lessons for BTC to just lower risk to how to do it better, how to improve, et cetera? What do you think that are the risks for BTC risk taking for example, how do you do it?
00:17:12.735 - 00:18:20.795, Speaker B: This is actually another pretty interesting question. I think one of the greatest differences for Bitcoin and Ethereum is taking is the holders of these two different assets actually are basically they're comfortable with totally different risk assumptions. For Ethereum is naturally going to be stake going to be used in defi going to be used in many things. But for Bitcoins as we always speak to this LPs miners, large holders, they are basically suspicious of everything. So if it comes to bitcoin staking it's a kind of a self custodial time log solution for many of them. For many of them is still kind of like something new and Bitcoin holders probably not that comfortable to accept something new in a very fast speed and they probably not that comfortable to give away the rights of holding these assets. So I think there's a very interesting perspective view this, the nature of BTC and Ethereum as assets and their preferences for these two different holders.
00:18:20.795 - 00:19:00.925, Speaker B: Let's see for Babylon timelock stuff the slash chain is not open yet and currently as they already opened Cap 1 and gone to open Cap 2 in I assume October currently many of the users are not able to write a script by themselves to do that. So only some of the top institutions do that or some of the custodials like Kobo and Seifu probably they're developing a kind of Babylon re staking solutions in their own custodial. So let's see, it's still in a pretty early stage but definitely they're going to be a very very huge potential. Just providing a like perspective to view this.
00:19:03.345 - 00:19:11.765, Speaker C: I don't have a lot to add to this topic because I'm not really an expert on BTT restaking. I'm just looking forward to hearing from some of these other folks.
00:19:13.345 - 00:20:00.555, Speaker D: Yeah in regards to the risk I think also I mean it's very early like there's not many risks like there's not even slashing yet on like Bitcoin staking and so on. It's really hard to tell, I think, or like very early to tell. I think the biggest risk right now is just kind of all the protocols and the whole like ecosystem just being overhyped and then not being able to deliver and then kind of everything crumbles, like not living up to the expectations. And I think that's a real risk actually that can happen to the ecosystem if everything gets hyped up too much and everyone is so interested in it and deploying millions of capital and then there's no yields, there's no users and no services that actually want to decentralize and so on. So I guess that's a serious risk actually for everyone building in the ecosystem right now.
00:20:02.855 - 00:20:30.425, Speaker E: Yeah, I think a lot of the risks gauntlet does do a lot of risk optimization, I guess. Yeah, we could probably consider this just like a bunch of Legos. We're playing around with a bunch of Legos. A lot of the risks in E3 staking, probably there's some sort of analogy in Bitcoin staking as well. But then you have to consider what's unique about Bitcoin staking. Right. For each variable that's unique in Bitcoin staking, what's the relationship between that variable and all the variables in E3 staking? Right.
00:20:30.425 - 00:20:37.585, Speaker E: The dimension sort of increases, I guess, I don't know, by some magnitude as well. You have to consider all those paralyzed interactions as well.
00:20:38.405 - 00:20:38.757, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:38.781 - 00:21:08.925, Speaker E: There's another dimension to this as well, obviously with Symbiotic and other marketplaces. On Ethereum we have WBTC as restaking, not restaking but like as staking collateral on these shared market, shared security marketplaces as well. This gets a little more complex and interesting when you decide to put Bitcoin LSTS or Bitcoin LRTS as valid collateral on Ethereum restaking marketplaces. Right. So I'm actually quite excited to see what that looks like and yeah.
00:21:11.865 - 00:22:02.247, Speaker F: Yeah, no, I'm also very excited to see how that, how it will evolve, how the space will evolve. But you know, I worked with RSK like 7 years ago, like not as a core computer builder, but I'm a bitcoin maximalist before and then I turn more to EVE to try because I, I can build stuff on Eve. It's really hard to build stuff on Bitcoin. So I would love to see how that will evolve in the future and I'm very open minded to it. But I think what I see today is just a lot of risk trade offs where you have a, for example, Eigen layer or symbiotic or other risk taking protocols on the ETH base layer as a settlement layer. If you then take assets and then say, oh, we're set, they don't using Bitcoin as a settlement layer, they're using this other, like other settlement layer. Right.
00:22:02.247 - 00:22:42.901, Speaker F: So I don't think, I think that the risks on Bitcoin restaking are higher than the risk on restaking on other platforms. Right? Because at the end of the day it's all about settlement guarantees. We all, we kind of want to trade risks with one another and that's what restake platforms do. We kind of use assets to restake them, to kind of trade risks with one another and earn a yield with that. And if you then restake on E, if you just settle back to the core Ethereum layer, if you restake on Bitcoin, I don't see how it settles back to the core Ethereum, how it settles to the core Bitcoin layer. I just don't. I have been looking to that in the code, how that works, but it's not been able to find it.
00:22:42.901 - 00:23:26.567, Speaker F: And if somebody can point that to me, I would love to research that and to understand that better. But so far I see ETH the best settlement layer for restaking. So I think Bitcoin restaking is great, but then with Bitcoin as an asset that you bridge over from the Bitcoin kind of the Bitcoin layer to Ethereum layer, where you can do more things with it, where you can do slashing or you can do custom slashing or you can do committees or all these things that restake platforms will be able to do. But I think on Bitcoin itself it's going to be pretty hard to build out that infrastructure. But I'm open minded, but I think there's a lot of risks there. If we just go with like, oh, these hard computer science problems are solved that RSK tried to solve seven years ago, but they didn't. Right.
00:23:26.567 - 00:24:01.551, Speaker F: So how is this suddenly solved? I still looking for an answer to that, but generally I'm quite open minded to it. But I still see EVE as the best settlement layer for restake protocols. And then I would even say that something like Binance Smart chain is a better settlement layer than because you can do more things with it. Right. At the end of the day we do certain computations, we want to settle that data and then say, okay, if something goes wrong, we slash. Right. And then we can trade those risks with one Another.
00:24:01.551 - 00:24:19.149, Speaker F: I think that's what it is. And I think there's a. We have a lot of work to do on the Ethereum side. We have a lot of work to do on all the other chains and also on Bitcoin. So I think that Ethereum is now the furthest ahead. And as an industry, if we really want to innovate on it, we should probably focus on the least resistant path.
00:24:19.237 - 00:24:48.923, Speaker A: I think 100% agree. So as a final question here, so which one between ETH and BTC do you think that will attract the most users? And why? Being because of all the difficulties with btc. But still, BTC is of course like the mother coin of all. So what? Yeah. Who do you think that will actually win? More users. More users want to restake their ETH or BTC in the end of the day, who do you think? This is a question for everyone, so please feel free to ask them.
00:24:49.099 - 00:25:09.635, Speaker F: Yeah, no, I think Bitcoin is the biggest asset. So people want to do something with their Bitcoin. I think they can better stake on a lightning node or something if they want to do that. That if you can start to restake on these complex cryptographic protocols that. On eth, we didn't figure it fully out on eth. Right. There's still a lot of work to do on restaking protocols, and I don't see that Bitcoin would certainly.
00:25:09.635 - 00:25:16.699, Speaker F: Bitcoin resyncing would certainly jump a lot of steps where we still need to work on it. Also, on the ETH side of things.
00:25:16.867 - 00:25:19.175, Speaker A: If someone wants to add anything, please.
00:25:22.555 - 00:25:49.129, Speaker D: Yeah, I would totally agree. I think there's still a lot of challenges for Bitcoin. Like it has to be bridged somehow and there's always trust assumptions around it. Even if it's a trustless bridge, you still have to trust it somehow. And in that sense it's like, yeah, this is not solved yet. So I think in general, I would say, yeah, bitcoin can attract more because it's the bigger asset, it's a better collateral to stake. But can we make it accessible to services and networks? That's the other question.
00:25:49.129 - 00:25:52.445, Speaker D: And I think that's a challenge that's unsolved, remains unsolved.
00:25:53.425 - 00:25:56.925, Speaker A: What Eigen thinks about this? Curious to know.
00:25:57.385 - 00:26:22.825, Speaker C: I mean, I personally just feel it's a little too early to say. I think that they both have really great characteristics. Bitcoin is, you know, again, the original and most trusted cryptocurrency in existence, but it's not as programmable as a smart Contract blockchain like Ethereum. So the trade offs are there. We'll see what happens over the next year or two and then I think we'll be able to revisit this question with a little bit more context.
00:26:25.005 - 00:26:56.561, Speaker B: From our perspective. Let's say we build on both. So I think we don't have to actually make kind of this predictions just to tailor users need. But actually out of pure curiosity, I have a question for Aigan is that I saw that Aigan currently supports the ERC20 tokens. Does that mean anything or intentions or interest in terms of like getting some ERC20 BTCs or other tokens for the shared security? Just very curious about it.
00:26:56.593 - 00:26:59.993, Speaker C: Are you asking if we support arbitrary ERC20 tokens?
00:27:00.129 - 00:27:00.633, Speaker B: Yes.
00:27:00.729 - 00:27:01.241, Speaker C: Yes.
00:27:01.353 - 00:27:04.441, Speaker B: Oh, that's something huge. That sounds so huge.
00:27:04.633 - 00:27:12.489, Speaker C: It was part of the original white paper. It was called dual staking I believe then, but they've just renamed it to something else. I think it's permissionless.
00:27:12.617 - 00:27:24.323, Speaker A: Permissionless. Correct. Correct. Perfect. Perfect. So we are over. So I will just ask for any final remarks, anything that you want to say, any news that you want to shout out.
00:27:24.323 - 00:27:25.695, Speaker A: Please feel free.
00:27:29.315 - 00:27:37.295, Speaker B: I think it's all good. Just a great pleasure to be here. Very insightful conversations and get some alpha. That's pretty much it.
00:27:38.795 - 00:27:40.255, Speaker C: That's it for me. Thank you.
00:27:41.435 - 00:27:51.125, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm just very excited what the future holds for ETH restaking and bitcoin staking slash. Restaking. I think it's yeah, very exciting times ahead.
00:27:52.945 - 00:27:54.965, Speaker E: Yeah, same I like points.
00:27:56.705 - 00:28:58.635, Speaker F: Yeah, very excited about the modular security stack and how we can, how we can work together to make, to make defi actually work. And I think that restaking is a way forward for us to kind of form new capital structures. And on the right a lot of the risks and a lot of the centralization points that we still have in decentralized financial systems and I'm very excited with yieldness to bring out our new metaphor that are going to go live soon that will basically rebalance around all the different restaking protocols to absorb all the highest yields and also rebalance into DEFI protocols directly itself. I'm very bullish on defi with all the new innovation with intense and all the other things that I see. So I'm very bullish on it and I think we're going to see a resurgence of of DEFI very soon. And yeah, complete decent, completely decentralized financial structures are I think very important for the world. So I'm very passionate and working hard to with everybody here to make that into a reality.
00:28:58.635 - 00:29:00.363, Speaker F: So thank you. Yeah.
00:29:00.419 - 00:29:02.315, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much, guys. Cheers. Thank you.
