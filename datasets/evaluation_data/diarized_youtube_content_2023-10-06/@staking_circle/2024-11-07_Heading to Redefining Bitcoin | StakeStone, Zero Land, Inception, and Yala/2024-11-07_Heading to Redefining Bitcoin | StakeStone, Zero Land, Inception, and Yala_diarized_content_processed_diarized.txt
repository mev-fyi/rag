00:00:01.280 - 00:00:25.635, Speaker A: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning everyone. How are you doing today? It's Tuesday. It's a fine weekend. We had Binance Blockchain week happening last week. We have a lot of our fellow partners going right now to DEFCON in Bangkok and we are excited for our event coming up next week.
00:00:25.635 - 00:00:51.315, Speaker A: Heading to redefining bitcoin. I hope you guys are doing well this day. My name is Miguel. I'm your host of Staking Circle Spaces. We are here today with some of our guests and sponsors of our next event in Bangkok. I just want to run a quick mic check before we start with the space stakes. Ivan, how are you doing today sir?
00:00:54.125 - 00:00:58.549, Speaker B: Great, great. Ivan here. CMO Stakestone. Thanks for having me today.
00:00:58.677 - 00:01:09.293, Speaker A: Staking Circle perfect. Thank you man. Thank you for joining us. Really excited to have you here. Kt. I saw that you already unmuted yourself. Go ahead sir.
00:01:09.389 - 00:01:15.865, Speaker C: Hey. Hi everyone. GM Kaitai here, co founder Elf Yala. Thank you for having us.
00:01:16.695 - 00:01:23.635, Speaker A: Perfect man. Thank you for joining us. We can hear you loud and clear. Joo, my man. How are you doing sir?
00:01:24.135 - 00:01:26.235, Speaker D: Hello. Hello. All good here?
00:01:26.935 - 00:01:28.515, Speaker A: Perfect. How's Thailand?
00:01:29.415 - 00:01:51.771, Speaker D: Very good. So I already arrived so getting ready for devcon already preparing everything from the inception side. Part of the team is already here and more people will come in this week so we'll be ready to rock and roll starting like Thursday, Friday we are ready for events. So very, very excited. 100%.
00:01:51.963 - 00:01:59.095, Speaker A: Let's get it. Let's get it. Happy to have you here with us today, sir. Last but not least, Gafur from Zero Land. How are you doing sir?
00:02:01.195 - 00:02:06.747, Speaker E: Yes, taking Circle. I'm Gafur, one of the co founders at Zero Land and thanks a lot for having me.
00:02:06.811 - 00:02:33.605, Speaker A: Perfect man, thank you for joining us. Last but not least, Gonzalo, my co host. How are you doing sir? Gonzalo, can you hear me? Seems like we are having some problems from his side. No worries guys. Once again thank you for joining. To everyone in the audience. Guys, thank you for joining us today.
00:02:33.605 - 00:03:19.595, Speaker A: We are here to tell us a little bit more about our events that we are hosting on Defcon next week. It's going to be on the 11th so if you are going to Thailand, we already pinned the post. Feel free to apply and join us for the event so that you can meet every single person here. Today we are going to talk a little bit about Bitcoin which is going to be the topic of our event and also to introduce you to our amazing partners and sponsors. Without further ado then let's kickstart these amazing Sports space today. Okay, we're gonna be focusing on redefining Bitcoin and just to start, okay we have some new speakers that are here for the first time. I would just like to run a quick run around of introductions.
00:03:19.595 - 00:03:32.635, Speaker A: Kt, I believe you are the only one that has not been in a space with us before. I will give you the priority on this one. Sir, please introduce yourself, tell us a little bit more about Yala and let's get started.
00:03:33.185 - 00:04:12.597, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you. Let me get it started. So Kai Tai here, co founder of yala. My background is in computer science. I am an engineer by training. Started my career as data scientist before moving into crypto and then I've been back and forth first as a founder, then as an investor and prior to co founding Yala I was working for Binance Labs on the early stage VC team, essentially investing in infrastructure, middleware and defi related deals then when it comes to yala. So this is a bitcoin backed stablecoin and our goal is to help BTC holders to earn yields without selling their assets.
00:04:12.597 - 00:04:55.895, Speaker C: In other words you can still have your BTC in your cold wallet and through a over collateralized stablecoin will help you in a single transaction to mint the liquidity. On any given chain we have two modes for our user. For the crypto native guys we have a pro mode so that user can have their hands on every step of the user journey. Whereas on the other hand for institutions or people who do not interact much, light mode is a perfect fit. So Yala, the platform will abstract everything from paying for gas fee, maintaining different type of tokens so that people get in with BTC and get out with btc plus extra earnings in btc.
00:05:00.715 - 00:05:27.315, Speaker A: Perfect man. Glad to hear that. Happy to have you joining us here on the space and also on the event. Really excited to have you in Bangkok with us and really excited to hear your thoughts on our panel today here. Without further ado, steak stone. Ivan, you already are frequent guests here but as you know we always have some new listeners. So please go ahead sir.
00:05:28.935 - 00:06:00.369, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me here again. So I'm Ivan. So I know Kai Tai when he was still in Binance Labs and I was still at BNB chain. So you know we go way back and before that I was in the sexes, then into layer 1s and then now I'm at Stakestone since the start of this year. So just a brief background on Stakestone. So we are actually an Omnichain liquidity asset protocol. What we're really Doing is actually we're building an adaptive staking network for liquid ETH and bdc.
00:06:00.369 - 00:06:41.465, Speaker B: So throughout U bearing asset stone and we have launched SBTC as well, which we'll go into a bit more details later and stonebtc soon which is a U bearing asset. It allows for asset staking beyond the traditional consensus layer. So we are fully decentralized, we have multi underlying asset compatibility, automatic yield optimization and we help to maximize the capital efficiency for our users. So our vision really is to establish new standards for liquid assets and helping to enhance the liquidity distribution for widespread adoption and also users trust. Thank you for having me here.
00:06:42.415 - 00:07:01.555, Speaker A: Thank you sir. Thank you for accepting the invite. Really excited. You already have. So we already know each other, we already are here for the vibes and also to increase the defi knowledge and increase defi composability and that's our objective. Joao, how are you doing sir, the leader of inception.
00:07:02.295 - 00:07:40.937, Speaker D: All good? All good? All good sir. All good. All good here. Yeah. So just a little bit about myself. So my background is in finance, working in crypto for about 10 years now. Started with Bitcoin mining about in 2013, so actually 11 years now and worked as a VC in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, did my graduate students in SF2 in Berkeley and then we started inception last year when we started hearing about Igon and of course we didn't stop until today.
00:07:40.937 - 00:08:20.877, Speaker D: Right. So we started mostly as a EVM compatible product where we launched 12 LSTs plus native staking on ETH on iGen. Currently exploring symbiotic. We just released also BTC token TBTC. Looking at releasing LBTC soon too. Looking to release all the majority of our tokens also in pools in Symbiotic and also going for Karak next and Babylon. And for us BTC is definitely the next stage because we see it as of course like the main driver of crypto.
00:08:20.877 - 00:08:37.565, Speaker D: So it doesn't make sense to be only on Ethereum. Like we want to be some of the biggest players in the market in regards to both ETH and btc. So definitely BTC is like the roadmap to go in the next next year for us.
00:08:39.465 - 00:08:59.675, Speaker A: Perfect man. Excited, excited to see the growth, excited to see what the next couple of months brings to BTC5 and to defy in general as I believe we're going to have some crazy crazy growth in the next times ahead. Last but not least, Gafur 0 land. Go ahead sir.
00:09:02.615 - 00:09:59.625, Speaker E: So hey, hey everyone, my name is Kafur, I've been in the space for about six years now almost as far as I can remember, my role mostly is geared towards marketing and growth at 0 len. So I take care of almost everything non tech essentially. So BD partnerships, content marketing, all of those things. And what 0lend is is essentially it's a peer to pool lending platform, much more like aave. The only difference between us and other lending markets would be our focus on the longer tail of assets. We work very closely with most of the people on this in the space like Stakestone, Inception and we focus. Our focus is essentially on on the longer tail of assets like lrts, meme coins, LP Tokens and things like that.
00:09:59.625 - 00:10:56.745, Speaker E: Whereas most other lending platforms are really just focused on the blue chip assets, our focus is essentially on any asset that can be used as collateral. The vision that the or the goal that we look at is if there's an if there's any asset that you can use in crypto, it should essentially be allowed to be collateralized as well. So that's our ultimate goal. But of course the space is so nascent that there are risks involved and technical and economic risks involved. But that's our ultimate vision and goal. So yeah, Zero Land is essentially like a lending market. To summarize, Zero Land is a lending market primarily we are the largest one on linear, but our recent launch of the Bitcoin only markets on the mainnet have attracted a lot of traction and we are probably the largest lending platform when it comes to lending and borrowing your BTC assets.
00:10:58.245 - 00:11:31.463, Speaker A: Perfect sir, happy to have you here. Thank you for sharing more about Zero Land. Without further ado then introductions are made. Let's get started. Okay, let's jump into already our BTC5 questions. Okay, I only have one and this is something that I'm personally concerned, but I'm also very curious to know your view on this right now as BTC5 grows. One common criticism that I've been seeing is that often operates on chains outside of the Bitcoin network itself, leaving a lot of BTC locked up.
00:11:31.463 - 00:12:33.415, Speaker A: Instead of actively transacting on Bitcoin network, this could lead potentially to reduce the transaction volume and obviously the fee revenue for Bitcoin miners, raising concerns about the network's long term sustainability. Okay, my concern is okay, right now the miners still get rewards from mining Bitcoin itself and also from the fee revenue. But after some time due to the events on Bitcoin and if we start seeing the volume reducing on the bitcoin network, do you believe that Bitcoin network will still be sustainable or will we have to Find a, a solution for this. Guys, this is an open question so I will invite you to just jump in and if you hear some of the speakers saying something that you agree or just want to share some light on, don't wait for me to give you the word, just jump in, raise your hand and let's have an open discussion about this.
00:12:34.075 - 00:13:41.309, Speaker D: Yeah, I can start if you allow me. So I think that this is a very first is a very complex question, right? But the thing is, if you see right now what we are doing, especially in this LR MRT space to bringing Bitcoin to Defi and to giving yields on top of BTC and all that, like it's still very in early stages, right? So I'll say that at least for the next one or two years I don't see this problem happening as bad as you, as you put it in the question because. And then you have the thing that the majority of the BTC holders are very risk averse. So there will still take a lot of time for a lot of BTC to move into these new DEFI protocols and people to actually want to earn more yields on the btc. So that is actually our job, everyone here in this panel actually to bring more BTC to DeFi. Right. But I will say that this problem only exists if the majority of the BTC is in defi and then you probably have a new problem to actually solve.
00:13:41.309 - 00:13:54.705, Speaker D: But I'll say that we are still very far ahead from this problem, at least in my perspective. Now what I want is to bring more BTC to Defi. Then I will think about this problem later, at least for me.
00:13:58.165 - 00:14:03.581, Speaker A: Thank you sir. Who wants to go ahead? Guys, I'm going to treat you like.
00:14:03.733 - 00:14:36.339, Speaker C: Yeah, I can jump in next. I have a slight Newman's view that. So two points. We've seen a emergence of sidechain and L2s trying to play the ETH playbook and then put all the different actions back to the btc. I think there's one point that we are missing in the whole picture is miners. And my first point of view is we have to integrate the miners revenue models into anything related to BTC5. It's like tying the interest together.
00:14:36.339 - 00:15:35.545, Speaker C: The BTC miners will get incentive to allocate one portion of those fees generated from BTC5 back to their wallets so that we can funnel part of the revenue from, you name it, staking fees, you can say all the part of the revenue from BTC5 to sustain the BTC security. As mentioned Previously BTC miners are pretty risk adverse. Some of the ways is putting the BTC liquidity on chain. We have other protocols trying to keep the BTC in code wallet and for example with Stablecoin to move the liquidity from one chain to the other. So all those avenues could be explored if we can share the pie in a fairly manner. So one part is miners because we have to remember that it's still a POW chain and on the other part is getting those key actors on chain engaging liquidity in a safely manner.
00:15:38.125 - 00:16:09.265, Speaker A: 100%, sir. Like I understand both points of view and obviously as John said, this is probably not a problem for now and neither for like the next two, three, probably even 10 years. But it's something that as Kaitaja said, we need to be aware of not only bring incentives to Bitcoin holders but also for the miners because in reality they are the ones providing security and sustainability for the chain to work. Gafur, do you have any thoughts which you would like to share on this?
00:16:10.925 - 00:16:53.625, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. So firstly, I think that's a great question. Not a lot of people are visionary enough to look at things so much into the future. Right. But yeah, just to break down what that question is for the users and the listeners, essentially what staking Circle is trying to say is whenever you're doing any sort of bitcoin finance, it's essentially what happens is users lock up their bitcoin assets on the native network and then use it on another chain altogether to use those assets and do something with it. Right. Whether it's on Zero Land, whether it's on Lombard, Inception or whatever it is.
00:16:53.625 - 00:17:31.070, Speaker E: Right. So the question is when that happens, essentially miners cannot really earn fees because that, that part of bitcoin is just locked up and it's not moving anywhere. There are no transactions happening. Right. I think what Joa mentioned here is great. I think it's not a problem for today for sure, maybe not even for a couple of years. But eventually when people do realize, when even the risk averse people realize that there are eels and activations that they can do using their bitcoins, they will eventually flock to these L2 solutions.
00:17:31.070 - 00:17:58.193, Speaker E: Right. And then, and then how do we solve it? I think, I think ultimately the expansion of Bitcoin across Defi is super essential. Right. Because it helps us to onboard a lot of these bitcoin whales to get more interested into the defi approach and whatever you guys are doing. Right. Including all the, all the speakers here. But yeah, if we are able to.
00:17:58.193 - 00:18:35.705, Speaker E: I don't know how. But if we are able to eventually figure out a way just how Ethereum can benefit so much using these L2 solutions where roll ups operate and then they batch transactions and then ultimately it goes back to Ethereum. Right? So the growth of L2s primarily leads to Ethereum's growth as well. If we are able to somehow figure that piece out, then this problem is resolved. But I don't know how because essentially the major difference is again the pow, the proof of work versus proof of stake and there are so many nitty gritties involved. But yeah, that's, that's my answer.
00:18:36.005 - 00:18:56.335, Speaker A: Thank you sir. And also thank you for explaining a little bit more like to our listeners what I meant. Like I sometimes miss the point that probably not everyone will understand the question or have the full understanding of how things work yet, but Ivan, go ahead sir, I see that you already unmuted yourself.
00:18:56.955 - 00:19:40.167, Speaker B: I just want to add on one point here because I think Stakestone has been using Stone, at least on the Ethereum space for a lot of Defi users. I think all Defi users are quite familiar with Stone. But I think for us our Stone BTC in the coming days when we launch is actually also on ERC20. So it's a yield bearing asset. And right now we have already launched our basically SPTC product which is like an index btc. In future you can move your SPTC into a U bearing token which is Stone btc. So I think what we actually aim is to mitigate some of the concerns surrounding the fee revenues for Bitcoin miners.
00:19:40.167 - 00:20:12.885, Speaker B: And also with the BTC5 solution actually gaining more traction, we feel that BTC assets may still serve as a source of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, especially as more sophisticated cross chain protocols develop. I mean we are still very early like what everyone has mentioned, so I think we feel that this interaction could actually balance the shift, right, supporting both whether it's a defi growth or for miners revenue. Thank you.
00:20:13.305 - 00:20:57.587, Speaker A: Perfect. Ivan, thank you very much. What do you guys think? Like I have some other question here about BTC5 but I don't want to prolong this a lot. Do you guys want to go over it or should we pass through the devcon and Regional focus part of the space? Gonzalo, my co host, what do you think sir? And once again my co host is having a microphone issues. No worries. Well guys, thank you very much for sharing your light and your knowledge here on this question. I personally like, it's something that I'm very interested in Seeing how we're gonna solve, although it's not a problem for now, is something that we'll need to be aware in the future.
00:20:57.587 - 00:21:22.837, Speaker A: Okay, shifting a little bit more of our focus right now to the event itself to defcon. I want to ask you, like, what are you most excited about devcon and what are you hoping to achieve during your time in talent for the event? Like, what's your focus here? Kaita, you can go ahead, sir. Like you, you've been quite for a long. You were one of the first ones to answer the previous question. I will give you the mic.
00:21:22.901 - 00:22:04.137, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, thank you. DEFCON is, I think for a lot of builders, one of the last events people are going to attend. So my priority would one is getting to maintain the relationship we have established, catching up with people we work together with and to lay down the milestone for the coming months. So at least for next year. And then we have engaged because we launched our testnet last month. So we have been engaging remotely with different type of partners. That would be great to catch up with them and to make sure that we are still aligned and to prepare for the different versions of our testnets and eventually go to mainnet in January.
00:22:04.137 - 00:22:28.545, Speaker C: And then second one priority would be exploring Thailand. That would be one of the great way for me being the first time here in going to Thailand. So discovering a new culture, getting to know people locally, what are their habits, what are the appetite on crypto or technology in general. And then enjoy the food and the conference as well.
00:22:31.815 - 00:22:51.079, Speaker A: Thank you very much, sir. Thank you for sharing. I personally won't be in Thailand, would love to join, but I didn't have the possibility to do it this year. But I'm really happy that you guys are going to be able to be there, meet each other and just get your goals down. Go ahead, Ivan. I see that you already unmuted yourself, sir.
00:22:51.207 - 00:23:32.535, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just going to mention, I mean you brought up the point where you're not going to be there. Actually, I'm not going to be there as well, but my team will be including our founder. So, you know, if you guys see anyone wearing a stick stone T shirt walking around or carrying a stick stone tote bag, you know, feel free to reach out to, to walk up to them and ask them some questions about stakes on. So I think for us Asia, I mean stick stone is actually, it's a stick zone. I mean it's a, I would say I, I don't want to call it an Asian project, but you know, the founders and also the core team is also based in Asia. We actually feel that, you know, like Thailand itself, it's a dynamic market, right. With really high crypto adoption rate.
00:23:32.535 - 00:24:18.749, Speaker B: That is also. There is also, I think there are also local centralized exchanges in Thailand as well. And I think the regulatory support is quite strong as well in Thailand. So we actually not just want to position ourselves within this rapidly growing market, but also aligning with communities, local communities that are highly receptive to, you know, DeFi to BTC Fi or just in staking in general. Right. So I think this is what our goal is really is to, you know, meet a local community in Thailand. And also, you know, eventually I hope I can, you know, hire a ambassador in Thailand as well.
00:24:18.749 - 00:24:33.075, Speaker B: So, you know, if you guys know of any good community builders in Thailand, feel free to, you know, drop me a DM on my Twitter or drop a DM to Stickstone account. And yeah, I know. We'll chat from there. Thank you.
00:24:35.895 - 00:24:42.755, Speaker A: Thank you very much, sir. John, you already been there for almost one week, I believe.
00:24:43.855 - 00:24:46.315, Speaker D: Actually, I'm here for like three weeks already.
00:24:47.365 - 00:24:51.501, Speaker A: Okay, so you already are the local one. You already can share some light.
00:24:51.693 - 00:25:39.875, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it was funny because what Stakestone was saying is about, like, what is an Asian project or not an Asian project. And I will say that nowadays any good crypto project is an Asian project. Like, it doesn't. Like it needs to be, you know, so even for us, like, as I think that the majority of people, at least that no inception, know, like the majority of our clients, tvl, community, most of them comes from Asia. Like this year I. I was making the calculation and I spent almost 10 months in Asia this year, mainly traveling between Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, also in Taiwan and Korea. And these past three months, I've been doing all the events in Asia from Korea.
00:25:39.875 - 00:26:38.187, Speaker D: Blockchain Week, Token Singapore, stayed in Hong Kong for a long time just for meetings, and now in Thailand also, because we do have an office here and we do have also a local team here. So it's also good for us to be here from time to time. But the thing is, even for us that our base is between Europe and Dubai. How I realized that the majority of all the tvl, all the builders, all the big communities are around Asia. So for us, makes sense to be in Asia, like I would say 75, 80% of the time of the year, because all our partnerships pretty much come from here. So it's a place that we of course, do a lot of business. We like, we are deep in all the communities around Southeast Asia pretty much and for us it's a great place to be.
00:26:38.187 - 00:27:37.125, Speaker D: Like what we expect from DEFCON asking was also saying is mainly to maintain relationships to see people that we were not able to see in either Korea or Token is also the final event of the year. So for us it's also premature to wrap up the year and to prepare the next quarter, second quarter for events. I will say that after Thailand we will take a break from events for about two months. Then the next one that will be on will be probably east Denver in the US which is I think the only US event that we normally do is going to eat Denver and then probably back to Asian events again next year. But yeah, very excited. I think it's going to be great and I think that there is a lot of people that again never visited Thailand and Thailand is a beautiful country so I think that everyone's going to enjoy it very much.
00:27:38.705 - 00:27:54.405, Speaker A: Thank you very much sir. Looking forward for seeing the growth and what type of communities you're gonna bring from Thailand and Asia in general. If we were last but not least, share your light sir. Give us your insights.
00:27:56.705 - 00:29:26.415, Speaker E: Yeah, so in fact insights are what I go to conferences for because most of the times what happens on crypto Twitter is just a glimpse of what's coming for the, for the industry. Right. But when you, when you visit these conferences is where you actually realize where the biggest opportunity is lying next to you. And for us it's worked in the favor for sure. Like we were one of the first few lending markets to realize that LRTS are the next are going to be the next phase of growth back in January and we were one of the first few lending markets to actually list a lot of LRT eat based LRT projects like Renzo Etify, even Stakestone which is LST back in the days and eventually when we visited Token is when we realized that the bitcoin finance ecosystem, WTC5 ecosystem is where the next next phase of growth is going to be. So I, I think it's, it's great to, to go to these events only to understand a perspectives from people that you would otherwise not have have access to. Right? That is one thing for sure though what KT mentioned is just keeping, just meeting friends in the industry, keeping good relationship with the already existing partners that we have and more or less zero lens growth story has been because of its partners like Inception, Stakestone and others.
00:29:26.415 - 00:30:21.645, Speaker E: We are nothing without the assets that we list is what we believe and our primary goal is to extend our line of assets which is allow for more lending and borrowing happening on as many assets. It's as visible B expand onto as many markets which is chains you too. The third thing is we also look at growth in a way that how well we can get discovered in the space. So that is where a lot of front ends come into the space. We meet a lot of front ends, a lot of data oriented projects like Token Terminal and get ourselves integrated there and yeah, that's really it. Like so a lot of BD some fun and yeah, getting more assets listed on our site.
00:30:22.785 - 00:30:51.795, Speaker A: Perfect. Sir, thank you for sharing. We're gonna head out to our last question. Okay. And this is just a little bit of alpha so that we can spread and share with here with our listeners. Therefore I will allow you to take the lead on this one. What are the upcoming milestones that you have for Zero Land and are there any new feature or updates in the pipeline that you are particularly excited about?
00:30:54.855 - 00:31:59.489, Speaker E: Sure, I think so. Just to give you guys some context on Zero Land, as I mentioned, we are the largest lending market when it comes to BTC Fire. We launched this market back in in September and in a month's span we've been able to attract around a hundred million dollars of TVL on those markets. And we are essentially the largest, the second or third largest holder for ebtc. We work very closely with Pendle so there are these various strategies that Giga brains and whales use across Pendle and Zero len and we've been able to attract a lot of users on those markets. I think for us the next target is around a billion dollars in the bitcoin markets that we've launched. And so this is essentially a market that is a correlated asset market, meaning only bitcoin assets are listed.
00:31:59.489 - 00:32:47.985, Speaker E: So your ebtc maybe stone BTC when it launch launches or inceptions BTC derivative and users because it's a of up to 97% and so essentially users can take a looped position of up to 10x. So if Pendle is offering a fixed Yield on their PT tokens of around 5% you can essentially loop it up to 50% using zero land and maybe a front end like contango using a one click strategy. We see a lot of growth and we think that we've actually found product market fit for our lending markets. And our next phase of growth is essentially doubling down on BTC 5 ecosystem and taking it to a billion dollars in TPM.
00:32:49.725 - 00:33:07.775, Speaker A: Amazing sir, excited. Would love to see you guys reach the 1 billion TVL mark. I believe you Guys are gonna do it, it's just a matter of when, not a matter of if. Excited employee and reporting for you guys on this. Juan, want to go ahead next sir?
00:33:08.715 - 00:33:52.287, Speaker D: Absolutely, absolutely. So for us next exciting things as I said is definitely on the the BTC sphere with more assets on Symbiotic and on Babylon next. One thing that I'm particularly very excited about is we recently closed a big funding from actually European family office and it's going to be live in a matter of one to two weeks. So it's going to be about nine digits of TVL showing up on Inception. So it's big alpha. Like we are we really really excited to put it live in the next few few days. And another thing more on the infrastructure side.
00:33:52.287 - 00:34:31.695, Speaker D: So we are working on what we call the Meta lrts which is with one deposit, this deposit is split between several infrastructures so the yields can be optimized meaning that you can restate your lrt. And this instead of just being on Eigen can be on like split between Eigen Symbiotic or like Eigen and Carac and so we can actually have the best yields for the user and the best experience as possible for restaking. So this is something that we are working already for a while and it will be also live in the next I would say like one to two months. And we are really excited about this also.
00:34:34.675 - 00:34:59.685, Speaker A: Sir. Those are crazy news like congrats on the deal. Congratulations on what you achieved guys. You already heard a big alpha here from Inception sites and I believe like this also for Zero Lands and some other integrations probably with Yala if possible could mean some new integrations and bring new TVL to zero land and yellow also congrats.
00:34:59.725 - 00:35:01.749, Speaker D: 100% stake soon.
00:35:01.877 - 00:35:03.025, Speaker A: You want to go next?
00:35:04.765 - 00:35:05.189, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:35:05.237 - 00:35:42.481, Speaker B: So you know Zero Land and Yala, they are a close partner of Stick Stone already. But I just want to mention a bit about our our near term roadmap. So with SPTC launch we are also going to roll out a Stick Stone vault. Actually it's gonna come out this Thursday, this Thursday night Asia time. So stay tuned for it. There is a limited, the vote is limited to a certain amount of money. So you know this is for the people who are on the on the call here and this is the alpha for you to join.
00:35:42.481 - 00:36:23.625, Speaker B: It's going to be Thursday night Asia time. Just look out for Stickstones X account and after that we'll also be launching our stone BTC which is actually the U bearing asset of our BDC product. And then in the coming days we're also going to have a huge announcement probably either this Friday or next Monday somewhere during DEF con. So do look out for that as well. And also we are also moving into pay fine a later day, later dates. I would say this product is probably going to be ready around maybe December or January period. So yeah, these are, these are the upcoming roadmap in the short term for Stakestone.
00:36:23.625 - 00:36:24.525, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:36:24.945 - 00:36:35.719, Speaker A: We're having all the alpha here today. Ivan, just to clarify. So you already have SBTC Live which is basically a wrapped version of btc. Like it's not.
00:36:35.887 - 00:36:52.455, Speaker B: It's a. It's not wrapped basically index BDC version. So you're able to mint it. It's a 1:1 mint. So it's not. The only difference between SPDC and StoneBDC is that SPDC is not you pairing so you don't earn the posu. So yep, it's already live.
00:36:52.455 - 00:37:08.357, Speaker B: It's already on our website. You can either deposit via router protocol, so we use router protocol. If you have any other assets on any chain you can deposit via there or either BNB chain or Ethereum is fine.
00:37:08.421 - 00:37:08.973, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:37:09.109 - 00:37:09.597, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:37:09.661 - 00:37:28.211, Speaker A: Thank you sir. Excited to see the next week. What's coming out? I'm already speculating on what you might be announcing on Friday or Monday. I'm waiting for it. Last but not least, Kaitai sir, what's the alpha on Yala size? Hey.
00:37:28.283 - 00:38:09.405, Speaker C: Hey. Yeah. The testnet has been live for three weeks and we are going to have two order test nets to give you some data points on the traction. So we have so far 124 BTC staked. It's around 6 billion worth of our stablecoin called Yu minted across the ecosystem and we'll have new functionalities coming such as the light mode that is going to be live for V2. In the meantime feel free to get to our webpage and to get into the testnet. We just launched the team up function for referrals and to get more points.
00:38:09.405 - 00:38:49.835, Speaker C: Our points is called Barry and then the next few key milestones would be January, our mainnet it would be a TVL campaign with different caps and we'll do our token launch in Q2 so around April time. In the meantime we'll be around in offline events so feel free to meet in person. My DM is also always open so if you have any questions, feedback, we're happy to integrate it into our product as we are still improving the product for the rest. Enjoy the rest of your day.
