00:00:01.520 - 00:00:08.205, Speaker A: Awesome, guys. I believe we have everyone now. Let's just run a quick mic check with everyone. Is everyone listening to me? All right.
00:00:10.025 - 00:00:10.925, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:12.025 - 00:00:13.045, Speaker C: Can hear you.
00:00:13.545 - 00:00:15.089, Speaker A: Perfect. Perfect, guys. Awesome.
00:00:15.137 - 00:00:15.725, Speaker B: So.
00:00:17.945 - 00:00:31.915, Speaker A: Let'S start with a quick intro from everyone. So maybe we can start with Lear from stakingdao. Do you mind giving a brief intro about you, about what you did and what you're currently building at stakingdao?
00:00:32.035 - 00:00:59.187, Speaker D: Hey, yeah, gm. Gm, thanks for having me. You know, really happy and excited to be part of the space and also get to see some other folks here that I definitely know and recognize. So I'm head of growth at stackingdao. We are the leading liquid staking protocol on the stacks blockchain. We have about $100 million in TVL and about 40,000 active users. We launched our project back in December of 2023.
00:00:59.187 - 00:01:20.505, Speaker D: We're actually the fastest liquid staking protocol to reach 100 million TVL, which we did in six months. So for us, like, it's very easy to mint STSTX and earn the consensus reward, which today is around 10% APY. And you know, happy to discuss more about the the broader stacks and Bitcoin L2 ecosystem.
00:01:23.685 - 00:01:31.749, Speaker A: Awesome pleasure to have you here. Moving on with Mihil, maybe you can introduce what you do at PSTake and what you're currently building.
00:01:31.877 - 00:01:59.357, Speaker B: Hey, thank you. Hey everyone, this is Mikhil. I'm the co founder for PSTake. We started building liquid staking in 2020 primarily for the Cosmos ecosystem. At the time we did liquid staking for BNB as well. But very soon we realized that these assets don't have as much demand as you would need for a thriving liquid staking ecosystem. And obviously we all know that there's no better asset than Bitcoin and there's no asset that has more demand than Bitcoin.
00:01:59.357 - 00:02:05.785, Speaker B: So we are here building liquid staking for Bitcoin. Very excited to be here and talk about everything around staking.
00:02:08.285 - 00:02:17.225, Speaker A: Thank you for being here, mate. Always a pleasure to speak with you as well. Moving on to Akre. Brian, do you mind giving us a brief intro what you guys are building?
00:02:18.635 - 00:02:47.357, Speaker C: Hey everyone. Yes, good to be here. My name is Brian Mahoney. I'm the one of the co founders of acre. We are a bitcoin in Bitcoin out liquid staking platform. I also am the VP of business development at Thesis, which is a bitcoin venture studio that's been building products in the space for the last 10 years. I myself have been in the industry since 2016 and I'm excited about all this renaissance coming back to bitcoin.
00:02:47.357 - 00:02:50.505, Speaker C: Looking forward to chatting more about bitcoin staking today.
00:02:51.765 - 00:02:57.973, Speaker A: Awesome. Now, final but not least, Slava, do you mind introducing yourself and what you guys are building at Stroom?
00:02:58.149 - 00:03:22.415, Speaker E: Hello, everyone. Hi and nice to be here. Thank you for inviting. Yeah, my name is Slava. I'm CTO and co founder at Stroom Network and it's Strom Network. We are building Bitcoin Liquid Staking on top of Lightning Network and Liquid Token will be live on Ethereum first, but then we are planning to go Omnichain. Currently we are on Testnet stage.
00:03:22.415 - 00:03:33.275, Speaker E: We launched it several months ago and yeah, we have like 25k users there and hope to release a mainnet by the end of this year.
00:03:37.225 - 00:04:09.091, Speaker A: Awesome, guys. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining here today. So, to start, I want to start with a question that I feel like is really important regarding this all bitcoin staking ecosystem. So because as we all know, Defi users and bitcoin users, normally they don't have the same type of risk aversion. Right? Normally bitcoin users are more safe users. So my question to you guys is, how do we convince normal bitcoin user to add an extra layer of staking risk to their Bitcoin? Anyone want to.
00:04:09.091 - 00:04:09.939, Speaker A: Want to start?
00:04:09.987 - 00:05:00.419, Speaker D: Yeah, I can start off. Yeah. I think that clearly there's a big culture around bitcoin maximalism and there's definitely some percentage of bitcoin holders that will have a hard time to convince to experiment with their bitcoin. And I think that's for good reason. That being said, in traditional finance you have something called the barbell approach, where you hold a large percentage of your assets and something that's super safe and that you expect will be a little bit less volatile. So in this case Bitcoin, but then you also hold a percentage of your portfolio and something that's a little bit riskier that you can be maybe a bit more experimental with. And so I think for a lot of these Bitcoin L2s or staking opportunities, you know, we've actually seen that a project like Stacks itself is kind of a high beta play on Bitcoin.
00:05:00.419 - 00:05:44.495, Speaker D: So, you know, what that means is that when bitcoin rises, stacks actually increases by a greater amount. So, you know, as long as you're kind of adhering to this type of strategy where you know you're holding maybe majority of your assets in bitcoin, but you have some percentage that you're, you Know, willing to take on a bit more risk and be a bit more experimental with typically that type of portfolio I think will outperform. And again, like we're not really trying to reach out or advocate to the bitcoin maxis of the world. I think there's a plurality of bitcoin holders that want to experiment and want to earn yield in various ways and are comfortable with taking additional risk. It's about really giving them the opportunities to do so while also having the appropriate safeguards in place.
00:05:52.165 - 00:06:16.297, Speaker C: I'll jump in here. Yeah. So I think one of the key things that we've learned, you know, over the last few cycles is I think there's not really a, like, put it this way, people, it's an innate human characteristic to want to grow your wealth. Right. I think we're all here, you know, wanting to participate in the economy. We live in a capitalist society. There's a lot of Hodler.
00:06:16.297 - 00:07:17.825, Speaker C: Yes, Bitcoin maxi, or we call them the Bitcoin stoics at Acre, but in general they're a loud minority. I think more broadly people want to grow their wealth in bitcoin, which is the soundest money in the world. I think the real key issue is convincing these groups and various demographics that hold bitcoin that in fact, hey, there's as close to a risk free rate or close to as risk free as possible way to grow your bitcoin. That's inherently true to the underlying value set of bitcoin, meaning open source, decentralized community run and fully on chain. And that's really what we're trying to unlock here with our product and user experience at Acre and really just kind of tapping into the tailwinds of the appetite that people want to grow their bitcoin and do it Bitcoin on bitcoin. Right. So I think there's a tremendous opportunity here in the market that we're clearly all attacking and building in a post FTX world.
00:07:17.825 - 00:07:27.105, Speaker C: You know what, that's better than the last cycles. You know, learning from those mistakes and unlocking sort of the next evolution of bitcoin values.
00:07:29.965 - 00:07:52.855, Speaker E: I totally agree with previous speakers. Everything said is just right. I just want to say that, yeah, it's basic math. So if you have some higher risk, you need to promise some higher rewards for that. So yeah, I think that's, that's it. Basic.
00:08:00.675 - 00:08:21.795, Speaker B: No, I think, I think we covered everything right. I think yields dictate finance. Everybody wants to do something with their assets like Brian said, right. Everybody wants to grow their wealth. So People are going to jump in. I think the kind of people hold BTC now is very different to what the case was 10 years ago. BTC is a lot more exciting asset to high risk individuals as well.
00:08:21.795 - 00:08:52.284, Speaker B: Today it's not just a thing where I just got to hold my btc. I think miners are a lot more interested to do things with the bitcoin today than they were ever before. So I think things have changed, times have changed. We just gotta stay relevant with time, so we gotta do what is needed. So I think it's not gonna be a problem to get people to stake their bitcoin to generate some yields. I think it should be a lot easier and we'll probably have insane demand when things start getting exciting.
00:08:55.304 - 00:09:18.985, Speaker A: Thank you guys. But now that we're talking about the onboarding and the experience for users, we all know that with onboarding we need to incentivize people to come to our projects, Right? So my question is what kind of incentives are you guys providing for the users to use your protocols? Are you guys jumping on the current points meta? What is your vision on this type of incentives?
00:09:19.765 - 00:09:39.895, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I can take this one first. So for us, for pstec. Pstec is a project that has been live for a while. We launched in at least the first product, went live in early 21 and then that was for Atom. It was the first Atom lst. We did other assets as well. But the token went live in early 2022.
00:09:39.895 - 00:10:20.791, Speaker B: So the token has been live for more than two years. It's fully circulating today, almost fully circulating today. So what we've realized is points are great because it gives you that flexibility to reward certain kinds of behaviors and you can choose how much you want to spend for what kind of traction you end up getting. The biggest problem with points is it is highly speculative, right? So you don't know what's going to happen, how much the value of a token is going to be and how much you may end up earning. So the biggest difference for P stake are we going to do points as well. But the biggest difference is that the token is live. So people could just convert their points for tokens on a monthly basis every month.
00:10:20.791 - 00:10:44.915, Speaker B: So you know, you don't have to. If you don't like it after a month you have the choice not to continue. But you, you see what real incentives look like. It's not going to be just points and hoping for a nice token launch that's going to lead to some, you know, some value for you. So I think that's the biggest difference in terms of our approach, which is the fact that we have a live, we have a token that's been live and trading for a while.
00:10:47.825 - 00:11:39.825, Speaker D: Yeah, I think people often point to recent airdrops and say like the points meta is dead. I think I definitely disagree with that. I mean, I think you just have to be smarter with how you incentivize your users and reward different behaviors for stacking dao. So, I mean, our protocol is pretty straightforward, just kind of a vanilla liquid staking protocol. But we do have immense value and utility in the sense that, you know, it really reduce the barriers for folks to participate in, you know, stacking for the stacks blockchain. So, you know, if you run your own node and you want to be participating and earning the stacks consensus reward, typically you have to lock up at least 90,000 tokens for to run a single node. And that's very cost prohibitive for especially retail users that, you know, don't have anywhere near that amount of wealth.
00:11:39.825 - 00:12:16.257, Speaker D: But for us, you can deposit any amount of stacks, you can start earning that 10% yield. And we do also have a points program that's been live for quite a few months now. For us it's pretty straightforward. You mint STSTX or liquid staking protocol. And for every day that you hold one ststx, you earn one point. And we're also very open to engaging with various protocols and applications across the stacks defi ecosystem, as well as other Bitcoin L2s that have emerged. You know, we're running various points booster campaigns.
00:12:16.257 - 00:12:42.275, Speaker D: Happy to talk about that a little bit later. But yeah, I think, you know, I think the first thing, like if you're a project and you want to incentivize users to use your protocol, you know, obviously you need to have some base organic yields and you just need to be straightforward about, you know, what the points will yield and you know, what the potential behind that would be. And I think there's still a lot of design space to try and incentivize different behaviors with points.
00:12:45.415 - 00:13:23.525, Speaker E: In regarding to stroom, I think when we will launch our protocol to the mainnet, we will have liquidity mining program as usually defi projects doing it. Yeah, but before the token launch, we actually use endpoint program a lot. Currently it is super useful for the testnet because in the testnet you can incentivize different behaviors for customers and it helps with testing a lot. And without points it would be impossible to attract so much users to the testnet.
00:13:26.985 - 00:14:22.455, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just to piggyback off the question in terms of incentives. So I think Lior, you made a great comment about the market saying points matter is dead, but that's not something we necessarily agree with here. I think I echo that. I think ultimately where you're seeing the issues on a lot of these incentive mechanisms and points kind of, you know, fall out, if you will, is the fact that, you know, a lot of protocols have been unable to make that transition from sort of the initial bootstrap period, which is ultimately what points are solving for. Is that chicken and egg, you know, classic marketplace problem, right? You're launching a protocol, you need TVL and depositors and users, right? So you got to focus on one side of the marketplace and points or, you know, liquidity mining programs, however you call it. It's just a new flavor every year, depending on the market cycle. But ultimately it's just a great bootstrap mechanism that, you know, is market standard at this point.
00:14:22.455 - 00:15:32.399, Speaker C: So if you're launching a new project, you need to have something like this to get the users on board, right? Because that's, that's sort of where, you know, the market standards are. And from there, you know, can you turn that into, you know, real use cases and real yield and real opportunities within the ecosystem that you're building? And so for us, you know, we're starting with the points program because that's what the market wants. We have a little bit of a different approach in terms of how we're attacking it or crossing the chasm, as you will. So we're starting with an Acre points program, plus the fact that we also are bridge agnostic and Bitcoin L2 agnostic. We're offering incentives from the various other chains and ecosystems that we're plugging into, which is ultimately where the yield will come from. So when users come to acre, they'll be able to earn not just acre points, but also any chain or bridge partner project of ours points from there and or tokens from those ecosystems as well. And then as the market continues to mature, bitcoin staking adoption continues to drive tailwinds more further in the space, and people get more comfortable with this as a category.
00:15:32.399 - 00:15:39.995, Speaker C: I think you're going to see kind of the real winners play out. And who had the most successful points program into transition into real yield in the protocol.
00:15:42.495 - 00:15:58.355, Speaker A: Thank you so much for your answer, guys. So now I want to shift a little bit to the risky part of bitcoin staking. So I want to know for you guys, what are the primary risks and challenges associated with bitcoin staking. And how are you guys managing these issues?
00:15:59.215 - 00:16:57.129, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I can start. So I think bitcoin staking today comes with problems, right? Especially in the context of liquid staking. We see Babylon being the leading staking, at least taking service provider today where you could stake your BTC to secure other proof of stake chains and earn some yield against it. It's a very interesting proposition because so far, you know, you actually have proof of stake chains that don't have enough economic security and would love to reduce their the security budget because they have high inflation. So staking itself I think is a very interesting mechanism, interesting product. And to do this with BTC as the asset behind staking it makes it even more phenomenal, right, because it's the most reliable and secure asset. But how do you actually do that? The good thing with Babylon and bitcoin staking is it's trustless or trust minimized staking, which means you stake your BTC from within your wallet.
00:16:57.129 - 00:17:43.921, Speaker B: You don't have to send it outside. You know, that's with bitcoin staking. But the moment you add a liquid staking element to it, which is what P Stake does, or other players like Lombard Lorenzo Bedrock, do you have to deposit your BTC into a vault or into another address or into an MPC TSS wallet, which is not ideal because you give up custody of your Bitcoin and you expect some yields in return. Now what happens here? You start assuming that P stake is an honest protocol, Lombard is an honest protocol. All these LST issuance protocols are honest and they are not malicious. So there's a little bit of trust assumptions here. Because MPCS means there's 2 out of 3 signers, 3 out of 5 signers who sign transactions with your bitcoin.
00:17:43.921 - 00:18:22.193, Speaker B: Not idle, right? But what other. There's another layer of trust involved. If you see which is where is the LST being issued? Now if you issue it directly on a BTC L2 or a sidechain today that is not decentralized enough, has bridges to other ecosystems which are also through multi party competition wallets, it's not decentralized. Again, you have the same problem. So you have one layer of trust assumption, which is the fact that you deposit your BTC into another wallet or into another contract, that's going to be a problem. And then where you issue your liquid stake token could be a problem. So I think how we think about it is one this problem.
00:18:22.193 - 00:18:52.843, Speaker B: There's no way around it. Today if you're building Liquid staking. There is absolutely no way to build a decentralized liquid staking protocol. The good thing is we've seen how this works. You saw Lido launch in 2020 with not such a, not a very decentralized product, right? They had multisigs, they had a lot of centralization risk. And that's fine because tech usually comes after there's enough demand. Once you start seeing demand, people who are building the tech, they get excited and they want to build the tech faster.
00:18:52.843 - 00:19:27.381, Speaker B: So we've seen how this historically plays out. When we built Atom LSTs, there was no way you could build a non custodial liquid staking system solution in Cosmos. There was no ibc, nothing, you know, but we built it. And later there was, there was new tech within Cosmos that would allow you to build liquid staking in a non custodial manner. So we've seen how this plays out over a long term, which is why, you know, we go ahead with a somewhat, you know, centralized product. But what B Stake wants to do different is something unique. Right? We've looked at liquid staking as a huge thing, but I think for most people with the Bitcoin, it's not always about liquidity staking.
00:19:27.381 - 00:20:03.835, Speaker B: It could purely be about the staking element, which is 3 to 5% yield. For example, if you can generate 3 to 5% yield on your bitcoin, that could be great. Now Babylon is going to have multiple AVSs, multiple chains that it secures, who are going to borrow security with this BTC that you stake, which makes your life much, much more complex than you think. Because now today, you know, you stake your btc, you have to choose which finality provider. How are you going to select that if you don't know what these finality providers are doing or which AVS is, they are secure occurring. Now you will have to dig into the code base of each of these AVSs and see. Oh, is this a legit thing? Is this not? Can my BTC get slashed here? I don't know that for sure.
00:20:03.835 - 00:20:37.435, Speaker B: So you have a lot of work then. And then there will be rewards that come for you in the form of multiple different tokens. What do you do with this 10 tokens that you get? Where do you swap it out for your btc? You don't know that. So what P Stake does is P Stake also offers a managed self custody solution wherein you stake your BTC from within your wallet. You don't have to trust me or P Stake or you know, all those multisig signers. You don't have to do that. You use our APIs, you stake it within your wallet and you choose the finality providers for which P Stake has done the hard work and due diligence for you stake your BTC with them.
00:20:37.435 - 00:21:00.255, Speaker B: The rewards that come in, PStack will manage those for you. So in a way you're principal protected. Your actual BTC that you stake is from your own wallet. P Stake can't touch it. The only thing P Stake does is it decides which finality provider you should stake with and how to manage your rewards. So PSTake will claim the rewards on your behalf, swap it into BTC and send it back to you. Easy.
00:21:00.255 - 00:21:20.423, Speaker B: Nothing else you need to do. We'll charge a small percentage of fee on that. But this is another offering compared to just a liquid stake offering. Right. Because there are different types of users. One who care about liquidity, the others who care about security. If you care about liquidity, you may not be using the most secure solution there, but you'll get liquidity in the form of a liquid stake token.
00:21:20.423 - 00:21:42.787, Speaker B: But you'll have to deposit your BTC into a vault. If you care about security more than that and you just want to earn some meals, please. You know you can do that through the self staking solution on top of Babylon using an API that P Stake will provide with integrations to every single wallet out there. So that's, that's how we do it. And it's kind of unique. And you know, it goes beyond looking at just liquid staking as liquid staking. It goes for us.
00:21:42.787 - 00:21:59.125, Speaker B: It's about yields. That's why the issuance of the lst. The LST is called ybtc. It's not a stake btc, it's about yield btc. But all the yields come from on chain sources trustlessly. And it's not going to be like a CD5 play for us. So that's what P Stake does different.
00:22:01.425 - 00:22:42.863, Speaker E: Yeah. As we also build in a liquid stack. So I totally agree with everything that Mikilo said. Yeah. So the decentralization and trust minimization is a core feature that you need to think about because security still is a super priority for such projects. And like if you're talking about us specifically, it was a big challenge for us to implement the liquid staking enlightened network in a way that minimizes trust assumptions. Just because of the light network design.
00:22:42.863 - 00:23:20.387, Speaker E: Yeah. So. And we need to keep, we need to be sure that custody of the trust is minimized on all steps while on every step. When User stake with you. Yeah, but I wanted to talk more about challenges. As for liquid staking, it's very important to be integrated in different defi projects because that's the idea of liquid staking. So you stake with some protocol and then your token is in a liquid form and you still can use it.
00:23:20.387 - 00:24:02.145, Speaker E: In summary, defi. Yeah, and since we are early stage project, that's a challenge for us. And yeah, mainly the biggest challenge is to attract some initial capital that will allow us to create all needed oracles that will help us to be integrated in various defi projects. And also we need to have some track record on the market that blue chip protocols like AAVE can see that our protocol is valid one and they will be willing to integrate us at some point.
00:24:04.645 - 00:24:49.755, Speaker D: Yeah, Just to address your initial question about risk, you know, I would never advocate for someone to just like ape in all of their assets into a new protocol that lasted for all of five minutes. You know, I think position sizing is important. So yeah, I mean, maybe there's plenty of yield opportunities out there and some of these yields are quite tasty and appetizing. And I'm not saying don't engage in projects that promise high yield, but just, you know, kind of be mindful of what you're doing. Only use maybe a minority of your stack. Because obviously we've had so many blow ups in this industry over the past couple of years, both from the centralized side as well as decentralized side. So just be mindful of what you're doing on chain.
00:24:49.755 - 00:25:50.455, Speaker D: In the case of stacking dao, we have a lot of safeguards in place to try to minimize any exploits or just ways to lose your funds. We've been audited by four separate entities. All the results have come back as kosher. And also even just like the way a liquid staking protocol works specifically for stacking dao on stacks, since stacks has two weeks staking cycles, what we do is we delegate assets to validators and as soon as we delegate them and they basically lock them in the consensus mechanism. And even if there was an exploit, since they're locked in that consensus mechanism, those assets can't move. And that's quite different from maybe other defi protocols like lending protocols where, you know, if a smart contract is compromised, then an actor can very quickly and easily just move the funds, you know, and you know, bridge them over to another chain or swap them from other assets. And that can happen, you know, in the blink of an eye.
00:25:50.455 - 00:26:01.375, Speaker D: So that's just a bit of a structural Difference. And I think that's something to be mindful of. You know, what type of defi application are you even working with and what are some of those, the risks that are involved there?
00:26:04.795 - 00:27:07.777, Speaker C: The way we think about risk at ACRE is we have, we formed a, what we're calling the ACRE Security Council, which oversees the protocol and will be managed in a decentralized way by the dao. And we have a few different kind of frameworks or pillars that are input into this. The first bucket is, you know, financial risk, right? So things like, you know, making sure the user is aware of where their funds are at all times, being as transparent as possible. You know, no black boxes, no rehypothecation, no funny business, and ideally no credit risk as well. The second bucket is security risk. So from a, you know, Bitcoin bridge standpoint, right, how is the Bitcoin actually being put to work? What is, you know, at the validator level? Is it at the defi app level, you know, and who is staking on behalf of the users with your assets? Right, so ensuring that there's minimal vulnerabilities across the board. I mean, you can never be 100% certain, but staying as true as we can to the user and being as transparent as possible.
00:27:07.777 - 00:27:50.357, Speaker C: And then the third is sort of the regulatory risk as well. Right? You've seen lots of other players throughout the previous cycles get into trouble here. I think the biggest thing is, you know, if you can stay true to and as close to as Bitcoin value set as possible, meaning decentralized, open source and transparent, there's a good way to mitigate that. You can never be super certain, obviously. And some, some projects take the extra extent of going, you know, and blocking certain geographic geographies all around the world. But for us, you know, we're, we're not, we're never taking custody on anyone's behalf. It's, it's a fully sort of transparent and decentralized process that is aligned with Bitcoin as much as we can be.
00:27:50.357 - 00:28:08.265, Speaker C: And obviously it is, to Mikhail's point earlier, it is a progressive decentralization journey for many of us in the bootstrap stage. So the key is just really communicating that with the users and making sure that you're honest and building in public as much as possible along that way.
00:28:09.925 - 00:28:35.465, Speaker A: Awesome, guys, thank you for these valuable insights. Now I want to base a little bit on a point that I believe that Mikhil already talked a little bit about this regarding P Stake, but I want to hear from all you guys so from the user perspective, why should I as a user delegate my money to your protocol? So the question is, what is your unique selling point? Why should I delegate my money to you?
00:28:36.725 - 00:29:20.085, Speaker C: Because you want some lavender. Bitcoin or Bitcoin rewards, as many of us are are taught to say here, especially if you're in the U.S. but I think for us, you know, what we're ultimately after in kind of the North Star is, you know, bitcoin native yield, meaning Bitcoin in, bitcoin out, and you're stacking bitcoin on Bitcoin. There's no shitcoins or funny business going on. Sure, you can add that on top and get as aggressive as you want on the yield curve and incorporating other protocols, but we see a massive void in the market for native bitcoin staking and that's exactly what we're addressing here at Anchor in a nice way that it's super easy for the user to use and it's transparent all throughout.
00:29:21.585 - 00:30:15.675, Speaker E: Yeah, our unique Selenium proposition is very similar to what just Brian described because we also second protocol at Bitcoin in Bitcoin out and that's because of the design of Lightning Network. And yeah, lots of cool L2 currently emerge around the Bitcoin. But I want to advocate a little bit for Lightning Network since that's probably the most the oldest L2 on top of Bitcoin. It was proposed in 2016 and I guess the first working prototype was down in 2018. So it's a really old network and it's kind of like continuous. Satoshi Nakabata envision of Bitcoin as a peer to peer cash system. Lightning makes Bitcoin really scalable in terms of payments.
00:30:15.675 - 00:31:46.295, Speaker E: Yeah, you can do some fancy defi on top of Lightning maybe with RGB protocol, but that's a different story. Yeah, but Lightning is very good at payments and currently there is no way how people can stake liquidity in Lighting Network and earn yield for providing liquidity to Lighting Network in an easy way. So we are like taking this burden to us and we managed Lightning network infrastructure for people and people just can. Our customers just can stake bitcoins in Lightning and receive transaction fee that is happening online. And in addition, I would also say that this is cool overall because you kind of, when you stake your bitcoins in Lightning, you kind of contribute into the adoption of Bitcoin as a pure cash system. Yeah, so if you're a bitcoin maxi, you probably want to be bitcoin adopter globally as A payment system. So, yeah, contribute to lighting and that will drive more payment volumes to Bitcoin.
00:31:49.285 - 00:33:03.815, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm a big fan of what Lightning has done and really been like a pioneer in building out a Bitcoin L2. You know, I think it still has a long journey ahead of it, but I'm also even more encouraged by the other innovation we've seen across the whole Bitcoin L2 landscape. And I think Stacks has been a big driver of that as well, being one of the first to launch its main net in early 2021. So today with Stacking Dao, we actually haven't integrated Bitcoin quite yet. I think that's something we're actively looking into and it might change after the big Nakamoto upgrade that's slated to happen later this month for the Stacks blockchain. For those who don't know, I mean, it's going to be a big upgrade for stacks slated for August 28, so the end of this month and then shortly thereafter there'll also be the launch of sbtc, which will be one of the most permissionless and trustless ways to bridge Bitcoin onto a Bitcoin L2. So I think for other liquid staking protocols like Stacking Dao or maybe others, this could be a big unlock and a great opportunity for users to deploy their Bitcoin across various strategies and earn yield or borrow against and do all the fun things that we like to do in defi.
00:33:03.815 - 00:34:09.009, Speaker D: Yeah. And to your original question, why should users use our project or use Stacking Dao? As I mentioned earlier, it's really the easiest way to be stacking your STX tokens and earning that 10% yield. I actually did an analysis pretty recently, like looking at, hypothetically, if you had the relative price performance, you know, comparing bitcoin to holding stacks versus holding stacks and also like deploying into Stacking Dao and earning that stacking reward. And if you look at that, the relative price performance going back to early 2021, which is when the stacks mainnet launched, you would have seen that Stacks actually was a high beta play on Bitcoin. Bitcoin had performed, and this is at today's prices, you would have returned something like 120% holding just Bitcoin. If you held just stacks since then, you would have performed over 300%. But if you are also actively stacking your stacks and earning that 10% yield, you would have had a return of over 400%.
00:34:09.009 - 00:34:51.394, Speaker D: So, you know, just by stacking your stacks tokens, I Mean you would have outperformed Bitcoin and you would have also juiced your, you know, your stacks return by over 100%. Again, like, you know, obviously with more volatility there's, there's more risk. But this kind of goes back to what I was talking about before. Kind of like the barbell approach. You know, hold your Bitcoin or hold the majority of your stack in bitcoin, then take some sort of minority percentage that you're comfortable, you know, with, that you're comfortable experimenting with and deploying it across, you know, other applications. Whether it's buying stacks and stacking on stacking Dao or you know, using Acre or you know, whatever other applications exist across Bitcoin L2s.
00:34:54.694 - 00:35:39.979, Speaker B: Oh yeah. I think from my side, how I like to think about, you know, why somebody would use P Stake. There's three things, right? There's the product itself. Is the product different? Does it offer something unique? How do we go to market and about the team? So I think in terms of product itself, like I briefly mentioned, we do have a separate offering. It's not just liquid staking, it's managed self staking, which I think is a very unique proposition and potentially serves the kind of people that we want to go after. Plus also at the same time, most people today want to dip their toes into the water first before dive in. And I think everybody would be, most people would like to stake their BTC but would not want to give away custody of their btc.
00:35:39.979 - 00:36:20.067, Speaker B: So the self staking product kind of makes that differentiation from anything else in the market and offers something unique. The moment you go to gtm. How we've thought about it is we want to go to market in a way which is kind of more conservative, right? We don't want to launch with the fact that oh, let's have 20 billion in TVL. I don't think that's scalable, that's sustainable and it poses huge risks. Especially if you have like a liquid staking product that relies on three participants on a multisig having 10 billion, $20 billion TVL is a nightmare. I don't think I would be able to sleep peacefully at night. The other signers on the multisig, you know, would also have the same problem.
00:36:20.067 - 00:36:54.427, Speaker B: So I think the most important thing for us is to launch in a conservative manner. Issue the YBTC token on a chain that is more neutral and does not introduce additional trust assumptions until we get to a point where there are chains that can be trusted with direct issuance. Of a liquid stake token for btc. So that's a little bit about how we think in terms of being conservative versus aggressive. We do want to be aggressive, but that's mostly to get people to self stake their BTC and get excited about staking and earning some yields with Bitcoin. And the last is the team. I think we've been in the staking space before liquid staking.
00:36:54.427 - 00:37:28.375, Speaker B: I think like we were very early to liquid staking before liquid staking was cool or sexy, before Lido was born. We've been in liquid staking before proof of stake was a thing. Right. Like we've been building since, you know, like at least I've been involved in the staking space since 2019. There were two peers chains at the time, Cosmos and Tezos. POS is a great thing today, everybody likes to talk about it, but we've bet very early on staking and liquid staking and that's primarily because we believe in yields and cash flows. So for us the North Star has always been yields, yields, yields and you know, that is primarily through staking.
00:37:28.375 - 00:38:08.505, Speaker B: And yeah, I think, you know, we have lots of insights around staking, liquid staking. And the Babylon chain is built on the Cosmos SDK, part of its go to market strategies to go after Cosmos based chains which is something we have huge expertise in also picking, you know, finality providers who then choose different areas. So it comes with, we come with some knowledge and insights of the staking space and I think that makes a difference. Obviously I'm not saying any of the other teams here, you know, don't add that value. I'm just trying to position pstake in a way where you understand that we've been in staking for a long enough time. So those are I think the unique selling points for PSTake.
00:38:11.165 - 00:39:08.551, Speaker A: Awesome guys. Now that we're wrapping up and coming to the end of this awesome space, I just want to briefly mention about Bitcoin, the bitcoin risk taking narrative. So as we all see on what happened on Ethereum, right, we had Lido, which was like the biggest liquid staking protocol when the liquid staking narrative was on top. But then the restaking narrative came and suddenly everyone is paying a lot more attention to restaking. So nodware that. Now that we're talking about the bitcoin staking narrative, I want to touch point on the bitcoin restaking one. So what is your guys strategy on the bitcoin restaking narrative? What are your plans with it? Do you plan to follow this narrative for the future, what is your plan? Do you want to make partners on this risk taking narrative? What's your view on this? And also a heads up for Babylon that's been following us closely since the beginning of this ama.
00:39:08.703 - 00:39:11.711, Speaker B: Nice, nice. Yeah, I can go first. Maybe I need to jump off.
00:39:11.743 - 00:39:11.951, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:39:11.983 - 00:39:53.897, Speaker B: But I think bitcoin, obviously there's no restaking as such. Right now there's bitcoin staking because with Ethereum the restaking narratives comes into play because you have ETH stake that can be restaked to secure other AVs. With Bitcoin, the first step is staking and then you have liquid staking and then on top of that you will have restaking with people like Pel or projects like Pel Network or SAT Layer and a bunch of others who then do restaking. I think in general, you know, restaking has existed for a very long time. It's not a new concept that was introduced by Eigenlayer. Eigenlayer just did a phenomenal job to take the product to market. Because what does restaking do? It allows you to use certain assets that have been staked or that exist to secure chains that do not have enough economic security.
00:39:53.897 - 00:40:30.851, Speaker B: So every proof of stake blockchain needs economic security. In the past, what would happen is you would use the native asset to secure the chain. Okay, you have, you know, Ethereum, you want to secure the Ethereum blockchain, let's use Ethan, you want to secure Cosmos, let's use Atom, you want to secure Solana, let's use Sol. But that limits the security of the chain to the size of the asset itself, which is not desirable. Why have less security when you can have more? So with Ethereum's restaking, you know, obviously becoming a big thing. So shared security was a concept that was introduced by Polkadot back in the days 2018, 2019. Cosmos did interchange security before eigenlayer was live.
00:40:30.851 - 00:41:11.161, Speaker B: So we've had this concept, but it never really picked up. Today Eigenl has a lot of eth that is restaked. But do I believe that eigenlair is going to create enough field for people to actually restake their eth down the line? I don't know that. I don't think so. Because eth already has a risk free rate, which is the staking rate, which is about 3% or so. And with $20 billion in $15 billion, $20 billion in E3 staked, Eigenlay would really need a lot of high value AVs that generate enough field that can be then shared with these E3 stakers, to even generate 1% yield and to jump from 3% to 3.54% is not desirable enough.
00:41:11.161 - 00:41:54.319, Speaker B: Also the fact that ETH has missed out on having enough inflows this cycle. We've seen institutions chasing bitcoin, retail chasing Bitcoin or Solana or Meme Coins. ETH has kind of missed out and I do think ETH might not be able to have that demand today. So what is the next best asset when it comes to staking, restaking that is Bitcoin? It's not even the next best, it's the absolute best because it's the most stable, least volatile asset, is an asset that everybody in the world cares about. You know, today you can use SOL in defi, you can use ETH in defi, you can use, you know, chain, smaller assets in defi borrow against those assets. But you know, there's less than like a million people who would be doing that. The world is much bigger.
00:41:54.319 - 00:42:31.673, Speaker B: Most people are going to care about BTC more than any other asset and they would want to do things with their btc. But the first step is to have an LST that generates some yield in the background. And the fact that you have Babylon creating this bitcoin staking, which is the first layer of yield for bitcoin in a trustless on chain manner, I think it makes things super interesting. And the fact that BTC can, every chain would want to have BTC security because when the markets crash, BTC goes down the lowest. When the market goes up, BTC is still stable and strong. So it makes for a very nice security, collateral security asset. So I think that that is why bitcoin staking is going to be far more appealing.
00:42:31.673 - 00:43:08.955, Speaker B: And the fact that you go from 0% yield to 2% or 3% or any percent, I think it's a significant improvement from no yields. Right. So I think those factors combined would make bitcoins taking a very interesting narrative. But more so than that, the fact that you would have yields on bitcoin from on chain sources makes it, it's a very, very compelling argument. So that's my take on bitcoin staking. And I think this narrative is not a narrative, it's more about a historic moment for bitcoin where it's going to generate people can generate yield on bitcoin and trustless manners on chain. And that's going to be fun to watch.
00:43:08.955 - 00:43:13.685, Speaker B: I'll jump off. Thanks. Thanks for hosting guys and great chatting.
00:43:14.505 - 00:43:16.105, Speaker A: Thank you for being here, Mikhail, today.
00:43:16.225 - 00:43:42.205, Speaker D: Thank you Yeah, I guess I can jump in. Yeah. I mean the resetting narrative obviously is very hot and has generated a lot of hype. I'm still skeptical of like the underlying utility of it. Maybe that's a bit spicy or controversial to say on this space. I'm more bullish on apps and actual use cases. We saw when Eigenlayer actually launched and was one of probably the most hyped launches this bull cycle.
00:43:42.205 - 00:44:36.755, Speaker D: It did launch like a multibillion dollar FTV. But in terms of the actual demand for AVS's and all these restaking chains, like I just haven't seen it yet. You know, I hope to that I'm wrong and I hope that there is a lot of demand for these restaking chains, but I think it just really needs to be app and use case oriented, you know, like what do you, I think just launching a restaking chain for the sake of launching a chain and you know, launching an additional token that you're securing without having any underlying demand, you know, that's just going to put us in a lot of this kind of like speculative bubbly territory that we've seen time and time again. So, you know, I think it just needs to be app and you know, demand driven. So, you know, hopefully these chains will do something new and interesting when it comes to different defi primitives or different ways to deploy your Bitcoin and you know, just leverage, you know, the value inherent to your bitcoin in numerous ways. But you know, I just, I just haven't seen it yet.
00:44:41.415 - 00:45:26.365, Speaker C: I think Bakil and Lior did a great job kind of covering the both ends of the spectrum here. But I'll just. So maybe I'll kind of address this from the financial use case rather than from like the security or AVI standpoint. Because you know, liquid restaking is definitely a category that is rapidly emerging, especially at the defi layer. For us at Acre, our core focus is sort of nailing that primary use case of just simple kind of one click bitcoin yield that's natively denominated in Bitcoin. So stacking bitcoin on bitcoin. But of course what fun is on chain experiences and liquidity without some fun yield farming and casino games.
00:45:26.365 - 00:46:40.189, Speaker C: And so I think there's going to be a number of opportunities opening up here at the defi layer across different ecosystems for liquid restaking with bitcoin assets. So for us, we're actually launching in a couple weeks here we're going live with stbtc, which is our liquid Staking token or we sort of refer to it as a deposit receipt internally. So when a user deposits Bitcoin on Acre, they get a deposit receipt in the form of STBTC, which is an ERC 4626 token, the non rebase token that accrues automatically that compounding native bitcoin yield. And there's no lockup there. So they can take this token and restake it or redeploy it in secondary markets. And I think the groundwork that's been laid for Post ETH and Solana just in terms of those ecosystems, so we're looking to sort of tap into those and open up, you know, sort of that ability for users to go as aggressively as they want on the sort of the yield farming curve. And so that's an area where, you know, I think you're going to get a lot of capital inflows into the Bitcoin staking component.
00:46:40.189 - 00:47:03.025, Speaker C: It's going to be, you know, you're going to have sort of the nice other end of the flywheel on the liquid restaking side. As these markets mature further and further, more capital comes in and then I think, you know, you kind of get down to that baseline security for use cases that, you know, folks will be able to put their liquid restaking tokens back to work and help secure other chains in these ecosystems.
00:47:05.685 - 00:47:36.755, Speaker E: I just don't know what to add more. Previous speakers just described restaking narrative very deeply from different perspectives. Yeah, I just want to add that Babylon and Aguilar actually did a great job from the technology perspective. It's really a nice and beautiful solution. However, we need to see if there is a real demand for both technologies. That's true. Yeah, we would.
00:47:36.755 - 00:48:34.015, Speaker E: If we speak about from the like our project standpoint then like integration with Babylon would be super cool for us. However, it's currently not feasible to integrate like simultaneous or staking or restaking in both Lightning Network and Babylon because all of that happening on layer 1 contracts in Bitcoin and those contracts are very limited in functionality. Yeah. So we are looking more into projects on Ethereum side like Symbiotic or K since they can integrate any assets as a restakable asset. So we actually would plan to partner with one of these projects and integrate our liquid staked Bitcoin as a restakable asset.
00:48:37.765 - 00:48:54.189, Speaker A: Awesome guys. Thank you so much for being here today. It was a pleasure hosting you for our audience. Thank you as well for being here, listening to our amazing panelists here today. Do feel free to give them a follow. All of them are building amazing stuff here. So congratulations to you guys all.
00:48:54.189 - 00:49:11.145, Speaker A: Also pay close attention to staking circle. Because we'll be releasing some event soon. We're going to start our events in Asia, starting with Seul. So do do pay close attention, guys. Once again, guys, thank you so much for being here. It was a pleasure hosting you.
00:49:12.365 - 00:49:14.205, Speaker C: Thanks for having us on. See you in Asia.
