00:01:10.405 - 00:01:54.099, Speaker A: So Stephen from Zero Land, if you are around, I see Zero Land team, you can drop it there. So everyone, we are about to start the first panel. I would like to ask everyone to have a seat and in five, in two or three minutes, we will kick start. Thank you very much. So this is for you. If you have more microphones, just a little bit. No worries.
00:01:54.099 - 00:01:57.095, Speaker A: Give me just three. Three. And.
00:02:49.775 - 00:02:51.199, Speaker B: Nice to meet you as well. What's your name?
00:02:51.287 - 00:02:51.783, Speaker A: Steven.
00:02:51.879 - 00:02:52.515, Speaker C: Ste.
00:04:22.495 - 00:04:49.965, Speaker B: Yeah, you could say like oh, hi everyone. We're going to get started now with the panel. My name is Darren and I'm with the Blockworks advisory team. That's our new DAO consulting and protocol consulting wing. We spun that out last month and yeah, we're just going to jump right in. So if everyone here could give me a little introduction to themselves and like what they're working on, that'd be great.
00:04:50.825 - 00:04:52.085, Speaker C: Sound commuter.
00:04:53.265 - 00:04:54.045, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:00.025 - 00:05:33.495, Speaker A: Hey guys, my name is Stephen, I'm the founder of Zero Land. We are one of the largest money markets on BTC5. So we have about 120, 150 mil of TVL for BTCFI on eth mainnet. We're super excited to be working with Babylon Etherfi, Eth Lombard, quite a few assets and in summary zero lend money market. You can lend borrow BTCFI assets and that's really it.
00:05:34.405 - 00:05:43.025, Speaker D: Hi, Clayton, head of BDF Babylon. Babylon's staking security and liquidity protocol on Bitcoin.
00:05:43.805 - 00:05:53.505, Speaker E: Hi everyone. Kaitai here, co founder of yala. We are a platform that provides a stablecoin and help users, the BTC holders, to earn yields across the ecosystem.
00:05:55.765 - 00:06:17.155, Speaker F: Hey, Jordan Sutcliffe, I'm the BD lead at Symbiotic. So Symbiotic is a shared security framework. Our goal is to make decentralization the default for any new networks, any new protocols that are launching in the space by giving them access to a vast node operating network and restate capital for their security needs.
00:06:17.895 - 00:06:48.535, Speaker G: Hi everyone, my name is Philip. I'm a core contributor in Inception lrt. It's isolated liquid restaking protocol building on top of figun layer and also very soon on top of Symbiotic. And then we bridge those isolated LRT tokens that can be on top of rap, BTC assets, ECLSTs, even stablecoins. Yet you order L2s to simplify the experience and allow users to accumulate additional rewards on top of those assets.
00:06:50.635 - 00:07:09.165, Speaker H: I'm Annie, I work for Goat Network and we are building a Bitcoin L2 that can provide you with Sustainable yield and we're utilizing ZKBM as well as decentralized sequencer nodes infrastructure to allow shared ownership as well as achieving cost efficiency.
00:07:11.265 - 00:07:30.265, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you everyone. So I guess to kick things off and start with something a bit open, if each one of you could give your thoughts on Bitcoin like FI or finance and like the ecosystem there, that would be lovely. Anyone want to start?
00:07:35.805 - 00:08:30.959, Speaker D: I mean, at least what Babylon is doing is unlocking this finance layer through our staking functionality. But I mean, ultimately I think the opportunity size compared to anything else is the largest if thinking about building a financial product on crypto rails. But outside of that, I think it's probably the most positive sum game in the space as well. Just because, I mean, talking about Babylon Specifically, right, like 0.1% of Bitcoin is now effectively locked in the Babylon protocol. But also you have a little over 1% in wrappers, whether that be on Ethereum or other places like Solana or rollups. So you have 99% of.
00:08:30.959 - 00:09:29.665, Speaker D: You know, I don't even know what the number is of the market cap of bitcoin now. I think like 1.4 trillion asset that no one like is doing anything with on crypto rails, right. So like if you're looking at, you know, Dex volume, it's not a lot of activity in terms of like, you know, wrapped bitcoin swaps or otherwise. So I think in that regard, the significance of bitcoin versus any other asset and the fact that it's ultimately just been dormant and everything that's been going on over the past four years in terms of usability on smart contract enabled blockchains is very significant. So if thinking about what you're building, do you try to take something from someone else or do you try to convince someone to like, you know, do something with an asset that they've already cared about just by holding it as a store of value.
00:09:31.965 - 00:10:04.585, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I agree with a lot of what Clayton says. And one thing for sure is that the bitcoin ecosystem has a lot of traction. You can easily see that when Babylon raises the caps, it gets filled instantly. So one thing for sure is that while there's a lot of speculation of whether this space is going to grow or die, we can agree on one thing, is that there's a lot of traction, there's a lot of demand for BTC FI to be seen and grow. That's it.
00:10:07.045 - 00:10:43.335, Speaker E: All right. If you look at the innovation curve, the S curve, for me, I consider the early adopter stage until 2016. So I completely agree with the order to partners here. We have now since 2016 a very happy rapid growth stage. But for some reason I thought that the alignment on incentive is not there. If you look at the liquidity, we have different chains, different side chains, oil tools trying to create what Eve has done so far. But we face the same liquidity issue.
00:10:43.335 - 00:11:14.065, Speaker E: Then we have bitcoin holders trying to contribute and get yields on top of the btc but we overpromise rather than getting the true reality for our users. So we're in a phase that waits for key market leaders to make sure that BTC FI is going in the right path so that mass adoption can continue until we have the second phase of the innovation curve and adoption curve to have everything settled and following the path from ETH side to the BTC side.
00:11:17.355 - 00:12:00.083, Speaker F: Yeah, on my side, honestly when I first heard about bitcoin staking I was like really like I'm still not 100% convinced eth maxi over here. For me, Bitcoin has already found its product market fit. Right. It is quality store of value and that value asset transfer. I completely understand the the desire for BTC holders to find extra yield and there's no surprise by the demand and I'm certainly I'm suddenly growing in favor of that. Especially when it allows like the BTC denominated assets to be then restaked provide security elsewhere. There is a genuine need for that use case of Bitcoin as well.
00:12:00.083 - 00:12:25.555, Speaker F: However, I'm going to put it out there and say I still think that B2C DeFi is going to remain like a very minority use of bitcoin probably for many years to come. I still think that the main reason a lot of these big entities hold Bitcoin isn't to stake it isn't to use it for security. It is for that store of value. And so I expect that not I don't expect that to change for several years.
00:12:27.375 - 00:13:19.715, Speaker G: So I also agree with what Clayton said and I also agree with what Clayton said and with symbiotic so there is definitely like a bit more than 1% of BTC that is actively being used in defi. But there is a reason to that and there are still challenges to see more adoption. I will say that one fold is the bitcoiners who are like naturally more risk averse. So it can come by many reasons but someone with ETH just has more experience to interact in defi naturally and so on. So it's different profiles. And the second reason I will say that there is also a risk when bridging, right, BTC and using ether L2. So it's obviously safer to use ETH on Ethereum than using BTC on some other chain because you cannot do DEFI on BTC naturally.
00:13:19.715 - 00:13:38.355, Speaker G: So the cross chain part of BTC and the bridging is definitely going to be super important and whoever can find a the safest way to bridge Those BTC into L2S is definitely going to be a good contributor for adoption of BTC. 5.
00:13:41.215 - 00:14:27.907, Speaker H: I think everyone made very good points as to why we need to scale BTC and how little it's been utilized. Right now it's actually interesting, like the idea of DEFI and all that actually first started within the Bitcoin community but was really carried out in the Ethereum ecosystem. And it's good because like we can learn from it, right? Like what are the lessons, what are the good things that we can hope to cooperate in terms of like the BTC fire ecosystem. And so yeah, but things are looking pretty good, you know, very promising projects, LST stablecoin projects, et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, I think we have a pretty full panel, so let's try to keep everything within time, right?
00:14:28.091 - 00:15:10.655, Speaker B: And so I think what a lot of you have touched on is something about like the demand for Bitcoin and Defi right now, right? So going back to these past two years, we've seen a increase in complex activity on the bitcoin layer one, right, with the introduction of ordinals and runes. So I'm curious to know everyone's perspective here. Or maybe we could just choose a few people on if this activity is genuine, right? Is this sustainable and we'll see like growth in these new complex trend like transaction activity or is this just simply like a boom and bust and it will eventually dissipate?
00:15:14.965 - 00:16:50.353, Speaker D: I mean it's either everything is genuine on chain or nothing is. I mean, I think like, you know, the activity and the NFT stuff that's happening on the bitcoin network, it's interesting because it's almost reverse compared to like a lot of other chains that went live, right? Like, you know, with Ethereum, you know, you had like secure smart contracts first and then you had staking and then you had liquid staking or then you had NFTs and then you had defi and then you had staking, then you had liquid staking, then you had shared security, right? And it's like NFTs came first on Bitcoin, which is, which is interesting. Like before this staking stuff, before this like you know, BTC 5 stuff that was happening at scale and before like you know, what we're doing at Babylon which is like you know, staking liquidity and as well as like offering that, you know, security to other ecosystems. So I think you have like obvious like you know, product market fit on the degeneracy of some Bitcoin holders like willing to like do something on the bitcoin network and buying these NFTs. So weirdly it's like it's reverse in the sense of like they're probably doing something a little less risk on when they're staking BTC or doing something via Babylon or you minting a stablecoin, you know, off of these stake positions, etc. So in terms of like where this could go, like, I mean if you like you're looking at Ethereum for example, right? It's like 28% of ether staked on Ethereum. That's been a relatively stable number.
00:16:50.353 - 00:17:17.205, Speaker D: So like I think we've hit a point where like that's the majority of, you know, what people want to be doing with their eth. What that number could be for Bitcoin, like could be, you know, even if it's a quarter of that, it's the same market cap of state on Ethereum right now. So yeah, I think there are, there is a version of Bitcoin holders that are very hungry to do something with it.
00:17:19.865 - 00:17:20.481, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:17:20.553 - 00:18:37.839, Speaker G: Yeah, so I think like also activity that you mentioned, it's also a concern because it can also overload Bitcoin. Right. If I remember well even on Babylon when you open the deposits, the gas, I mean the cost of depositing BTC there was extremely high. Right. So even simply doing like native BTC risk taking on using Babylon on top of Bitcoin, such a simple activity is already increasing significantly, you know, the cost of transaction on Bitcoin. And so I think it's super important to be concerned about the limitation of scalability of Bitcoin itself, not overload it and come up with solutions that will bring the minimum level of congestion to Bitcoin but also ensuring a good level of security. And I think as I mentioned before, the bridging rights of that BTC to the L2 is very important, but also reducing as much as possible the non necessity to consistently bridge the RAP BTC or BTC LST from the L2 to BTC back and forth too many times and try to optimize it so that we avoid congestion.
00:18:37.887 - 00:18:38.475, Speaker C: It.
00:18:42.455 - 00:19:27.055, Speaker D: I will say like, yeah, the first cap, but also I would love that we're paying miners a shitload of money. I think that's like a cool thing to do. But outside of that, the second cap that we had, the cost per transaction was around like $2. So we did have limitations in the first cap, but the second cap was much smaller. But bitcoin also, because it's economic inflation schedule, it's like you eventually need to get significant fees from transactions like on the bitcoin network. So I mean, I like to think that like Babylon can be a part of that, but also at the same time. Yeah, like you don't want to spend like $300 to stake $300.
00:19:27.435 - 00:20:05.475, Speaker G: I mean, I think it's different stakeholders, right? The miner running, you know, infrastructure and so on, and receiving bitcoin rewards. And then on the other end, like on Babylon, you're enabling yield on top of bitcoiners. I mean, obviously miners end up having a lot of bitcoin and they want to do something with it and earn more rewards. But then there is still plenty of passive bitcoin holders that want to have yield. And then there is a little bit of a divergent interest between the interest of the miners and the interest of the stakers that want to capture the gas fees and everything from holding bitcoin and staking it.
00:20:12.265 - 00:20:15.425, Speaker B: Anyone else want to chip in here? Any other thought?
00:20:15.545 - 00:20:52.361, Speaker F: I think just to quickly add that, I mean, it remains to be seen whether ordinals runes are long term. I think the biggest problem that bitcoin has is its limitations in the technology stack. Right. And the only way that this is going to change is by changing that core stack. And then this is people have to remember that one of the reasons why bitcoin has this USP and this market fit compared to Ethan compared to others. Obviously it was first, but it doesn't have hard forks. Every other year that does some massive upgrade that introduce a lot of risk into the system.
00:20:52.361 - 00:21:31.205, Speaker F: Eth has that like Solana still in beta or whatever they want to call it. Right. And so again, it kind of comes back to my point where bitcoin has this core function and the more and more we try and push extra stuff on the network, it introduces risks and the more. And you mentioned complexity at the start and that is key. Complexity introduces risks. And so I'll be very like interested to see long term how much of these core bitcoin holders are willing to kind of introduce this complexity and put their asset, core asset at risk just to achieve something which is also achievable on other networks. But to Clay's point, like because of the size of bitcoin, it only needs a small.
00:21:31.205 - 00:21:42.385, Speaker F: It needs a smaller percentage of the actual network to take part in this activity, to already compete with the salon of the eth ecosystems because just how much bigger the bitcoin ecosystem is right now.
00:21:43.245 - 00:22:15.575, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually, I think this gets at an interesting question for. In relation to Bitcoin L2s. Right? So something that you can like. I guess the question that I would have for a Bitcoin L2 is that why would I use a Bitcoin L2 or a Bitcoin specific L2 over something like a. Something that just has like a better bitcoin enabled bridge to like Solana or Ethereum or something along those lines. Right, and maybe someone here can provide an answer to that. Annie?
00:22:15.655 - 00:23:00.565, Speaker H: Yeah, sure. So great question. Why do we exactly need a Bitcoin layer 2? Or everyone knows the need to scale or you know, the restriction, lack of programmability of bitcoin etc, etc. So I'm not going to go deeper into that. But one thing to mention is that I think a lot of the right now bitcoin L2s are actually sidechains and there's a difference between sidechain and roll up. And at Goat Network we're actually building a roll up that's utilizing ZK MIPS infrastructure and our underlying tech stack is provided by ZKM, which is a unified ZK MIPS infrastructure. Sort of like what RISC0 are doing.
00:23:00.565 - 00:23:56.135, Speaker H: And in that way that means bitcoin base layer is not out of the picture. Like we actually need to write those ZK MIPS to get the layer one to verify it. So in that way we're not in a sense stealing traffic away. Yeah, sure, there will be traffic happening on L2 that layer one's incapable to handle, but we're still involving layer one and inheriting the security of layer one in that sense. And also miners can be part of it because one obviously there's still verifying the ZK proofs and they are also, they can take part into the L2 to become a sequencer nodes because we're going to run a network of decentralized sequencer nodes. We are pos chain. So the miners, the decentralized sequencer nodes are essentially miners of our L2 network.
00:23:56.135 - 00:24:27.209, Speaker H: They safeguard the network, they get mining rewards, they share all the gas fee. The gas fee is going to be denoted in bitcoin. So if you are a bitcoin holder who has call it 0.01 bitcoin you can still choose to stake with one of the sequencer nodes and hence get a share of that node's gas fee profit that they're going to get. So in that way we're actually not running a centralized sequencer and we're the only one. So with that infrastructure you have shared ownership. Talking about stakeholder interest alignment.
00:24:27.209 - 00:25:02.295, Speaker H: Why should people care and why this is a more robust, secured, decentralized infrastructure. And I don't have time but if you're interested hop onto our website go network. We have tech white paper there, we have an economic page paper can read through it and yeah but in short yes it's different side chain versus roll up and I think what matters more is to have have an actual roll up and in that way or even the miners on the bitcoin base chain they it's still relevant to them and it's needed.
00:25:03.595 - 00:25:18.415, Speaker B: Thank you. And so I guess moving on to our next question. What is or what are the most I guess important developments you see for the bitcoin ecosystem in the next two years? Like what do you think will be game changing?
00:25:21.195 - 00:25:57.495, Speaker E: I can start with that question. We mentioned programmability. We are stablecoin issuer and when we talk to BTC holders, institutions for example and shout out to Marcus here, that is from Coinbase and help us to understand the needs. The key question is on custody institutions wants to somehow have exposure to btc. They also wanted to be a little bit more greedy to have more yields on top of btc. But the issue is what if we lose that btc. So for us I think the major missing point is the custodian.
00:25:57.495 - 00:26:36.625, Speaker E: So we have to find something that can do a decentralized custody for the BTC holders. And second is what is the connecting points from any BTC5 to the rest of the ecosystem so far is stablecoin what is the stablecoin behind it and is there any innovation? The innovation here is how can we rely on a 100% decentralized protocol to have the liquidity to move within a single transaction from point A to point B while having no risk for users. So those two points are for yala very important and for us the two missing points on the BTC ecosystem.
00:26:41.165 - 00:28:18.145, Speaker G: Yeah, I think that there is a part of making the bridging safe that is also very important. And I will say yeah there is good examples like Lombard on top of Babylon really trying to get like proof of reserve from chainlink for example also trying to make it as much as transparent as possible and making sure that the minting process of the native LRT on top of native BTC is, you know, trust minimize and as secure as possible is developments that will be very welcome because that will allow then more DEFI activity on top of it and bring more trust in the ecosystem. Related to institutional investors, I think there is already right the same problem on Ethereum. There is still plenty of, you know, eth token holders that are institutional, they don't want to have smart contract risk and they just interact. They run just a validator node with the help of staking companies. And I believe that crypto custodians will onboard Babylon and Babylon will enable them to also be able to receive risk taking rewards without, you know, additional smart contract risk and so on and so forth. So on that part I think it might end up being a little bit similar where you have basically that two class of investors, the ones that are okay with smart contract risk and will get just more yield from Defi and the others that were more reluctant and they will just limit themselves by receiving staking rewards from BTC sidechains, BTC L2s or from BTC re staking from Babylon since they support native BTC restaking.
00:28:19.845 - 00:28:33.795, Speaker A: I don't want to piss off too many people, but I would love to see a bitcoin meme coin that just gets launched on an L2 that becomes so popular that it gets listed on Binance the next day and Kim Kardashian endorses it.
00:28:34.455 - 00:29:25.117, Speaker D: So yeah, so we just had a hacker house last week and two teams were baby long and super baby that were planning to do stuff on Babylon with a bunch of meme coin. I will say that we're not a restaking layer. Babylon's not a restaking layer because the bitcoin isn't staked yet. But it's also, and I hate this word and defining restaking, but it's not rehypothecated in the sense of like it's staked to one piece of infrastructure or one, you know, operator address and that can be managing a lot. You would stake it to one finality provider and effectively like split the positions if you wanted to. I will say though, because like the interesting. I mean I think that the end goal, right is like, you know, trustless settlement on Bitcoin for transactions that are a little bit more exotic outside of like send and receive.
00:29:25.117 - 00:30:08.295, Speaker D: Right. You know how you get there and like you know, testing something at least in production with funds at risk. Right. Like you didn't do need some sort of staking layer that effectively, like most people trust to be able to like, you know, see, like what do people want to do with bitcoin on crypto rails, right? Like, you know, obviously that's not happening a lot right now compared to like, you know, the amount of like spot volume and centralized exchanges. But I think as long as we're continuing getting to the North Star of trustless settlement on Bitcoin over time through staking and lending protocols and stablecoin protocols being built on top of these systems, it's a good move in the right direction.
00:30:11.515 - 00:30:56.595, Speaker F: So to your initial question of what's one of the biggest developments? Like there's been a systematic change now the US election is over. And I just wanted to come back to this on my point how I still think that BTC DeFi is going to be a small part of Bitcoin. The reason being is that Michael Saylor has now got, has just been verified. Like we're going to be seeing governments, governments, companies, more, more and more companies owning bitcoin as part of their standard corporate treasury. And to everyone's point here, institutions have been slow to move on Ethereum. And so for the same reason that we're going to see way more institutional adoption of Bitcoin now, it is going to be equally slow to move on Bitcoin as well. And to Clay's point about there is no native staking on Bitcoin where there is on eth.
00:30:56.595 - 00:31:39.375, Speaker F: It's not as simple for an institution to say, yeah sure, let's stake our Bitcoin because they have to go to Babylon and then evaluate all the different, sorry, you call them networks, don't you? All the different BSNs and do like a risk analysis on these different BSNs before they then commit to stake their bitcoins. And it's the same reason why on Ethereum, institutional restaking is not really a thing yet. It's going to take years. It's going to take even longer on the bitcoin side as well. So yeah, just going back to my point on to me, the most recent important development is not necessarily like technological. It's more systematic and almost regulatory.
00:31:41.715 - 00:32:05.325, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, everyone calls it something different. I'm hearing BSNs, AVs, they're like a list of names nowadays. But on the same note of. So we have like the best developments in the next few years, but let's hear about like some of the most overrated developments. What do you think is actually not all that in the bitcoin defi space.
00:32:10.105 - 00:32:16.925, Speaker A: No comments. I think everything needs to grow more. I'm growth maxi.
00:32:21.865 - 00:32:58.575, Speaker B: Takes. I mean if no one has anything to say, I'll save my own little take. So I actually I'm a big fan of Bitcoin L2s. However I do think a lot of them, I tend to agree with the view that most of them are sidechains at this point in time. And most of the, most of the development we see for Bitcoin ZK is very limited right now. The only Bitcoin L2s that I think will be live and functioning will likely be like optimistic rollups or something along those lines. That's just my spicy take, I guess.
00:32:58.575 - 00:33:05.035, Speaker B: If anyone has anything to say, I mean, or not, speak now or forever hold your peace. Otherwise we'll move to the next.
00:33:05.735 - 00:34:13.605, Speaker D: Fine, I'll say something. I mean I will say and this goes beyond bitcoin, but the terminology of staking being co opted not just like at the protocol level to provide security, but like also like you know, for defi rewards at some capacity. Whether that's, you know, bridging or otherwise is an annoying thing to have to explain. Whether that's, you know, talking to an institution on Ethereum, talking to an institution about Solana like rewards or bitcoin rights like Babylon is building a staking protocol where the staking functionality exists natively on the bitcoin network. A lot of other staking functionalities that exist in the market, there's a lot more risk attached to it. And I wouldn't necessarily call it like protocol staking, I would call it defi staking for, you know, inflationary like, you know, rewards over time. But like I would say that those things are ultimately overrated without pissing off anyone here.
00:34:18.435 - 00:34:48.504, Speaker B: So I guess moving on onto like, so like I think we talk a lot about how bitcoin defi can affect the end user, but we often think about the end user as just an individual. With institutions becoming more active in Bitcoin and with the recent change in politics, what do you see? How do you see institutions getting involved with Bitcoin defi in the future? Either medium term or long term?
00:34:54.124 - 00:36:02.515, Speaker D: I mean, I think so. I used to work at Figment for like four years, which is an institutional staking provider. The complexities around explaining staking Ethereum is extreme, right? Like you need batches of 32, it needs to get bridged to this thing called the beacon chain and then that address becomes a withdrawal address and like all of these things become like very, very scary, right? Like it's like a huge list of things that you have to explain to someone when, when you explain like bitcoin staking. Although it is like a new concept for them for that like specific asset, it's a simple locking, you know, functionality within a wallet that they control and it doesn't leave the wallet. So I think I agree with Jordan in the sense that this restaking and getting much more deeper in the weeds in terms of how much they want to participate will take some time. But ultimately I think in these Babylon's design it's so simple to where it's actually a lot more digestible for certain types of institutions compared to Ethereum's staking design. To be honest.
00:36:04.895 - 00:36:40.435, Speaker E: I think that the role of institutions is pretty scary. So far in the bitcoin space we have seen a pretty organic adoption. But now with institutions every protocol try to get those BTC from institutions. So in some way if you think about it is the institutions would dictate what they wanted to. They want users and protocols to build and not necessarily turning around what users want. So in other words the growth would be forced the way the pathway would be forced as well. So that not necessarily something that I'm optimistic.
00:36:40.435 - 00:37:07.665, Speaker E: And last example is institutions require a certain mpy when providing BTC. So far on DeFi protocols those APY were pretty organic with market demand and offer. But now you have institution dictating say hey I can give you XYZ amount of BTC but in exchange you have gave me X percent per year as interest. So that's pros and cons. But for me I'm more like a pessimist point of view.
00:37:14.045 - 00:37:57.775, Speaker H: I think it will be a long way Apart from you know they mentioned a few very good points and I come from Trifi background. I think for Trifi install guys to be able want to take part into staking restaking to earn, let's call it high single digit, low, mid, low teams. You have to really convince them maybe they need to come up with like credit ratings so to speak for different like staking protocols and stuff. Like there is some way you have to definitely standardize it, make it more regulatory clarity, improve it. But yeah, in short it's going to be a long way. We hope so. But you know it's realistically speaking it will be challenging.
00:37:59.475 - 00:38:26.545, Speaker B: Awesome. And so we're approaching, we're approaching the end here. So I'll just like throw one last question out here for all of you and I'm curious what is a I guess major use case you would like to see developed in Bitcoin defi. We talked a little bit about like bitcoin enabled like meme coins. Right. What are some other things we could possibly like do here that haven't been done with bitcoin quite yet?
00:38:28.085 - 00:38:55.335, Speaker A: Yeah, I stand my case. Satoshi with cat Meme coin has to rip and that's gonna, that's gonna be interesting. But zero lend in particular we're building a lot of lending tech on BTC fi so we're super excited to kind of explore that. And we also are looking to possibly have our own chain as well secured by Babylon. So that's some interesting tech that we are building. But yeah, that's my perspective.
00:38:57.195 - 00:39:37.015, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean I think bitcoin is an asset for everyone and I think at least in conversations we've been having with other protocols recently, folks are really interested in having this native version of Bitcoin represented on their network that's branded and there's some sort of control that they have. So I think that's very, very interesting because it almost becomes like a protocol owned version of BTC that's represented. That's ultimately stakes on Babylon 1st and verified that it's locked on the network. So I would love to see more interesting use cases for that.
00:39:39.515 - 00:40:06.965, Speaker E: I like to see a faster settlement time. YALA has been on testnet for three and a half weeks and the 10 minutes per block on paper is actually more than 10 minutes per block. So I like to see a more smooth experience for our user for better adoption and getting to the masses. So hopefully we can have some of the protocols or having the union of miners to agree on something that can solve that latency issue.
00:40:09.985 - 00:40:46.207, Speaker F: Yeah, for me I think it's going to come down to bridging and general interoperability between Bitcoin and any network. One of the biggest risks in this whole ecosystem is the reliance on bridges right now. And you know, I think if we're going to see BTC FI take off, we need to be continuing to improve that, that ability to bridge Bitcoin safely from Bitcoin to any network. So yeah, I'm again that's obviously not related just to B2C5, it's just in general. But yeah, that's kind of the key thing. Especially as we enter this more and more fragmented ecosystem. There's more and more dependence on this bridging and interoperability architecture.
00:40:46.207 - 00:40:48.875, Speaker F: So yeah, I hope to see some advancements there.
00:40:51.185 - 00:41:49.211, Speaker G: So I'd like to see more like adoption of BTC and I think one way it can be also to see more diversity of wrapped btc. You know from Kraken Coinbase they came up with more diversity. I think there is not really a lot of consensus around using just wrapped btc. People want to see other things probably so obviously brings a little bit maybe too much diversity at some point, but that can address some of the concerns about the custody aspect that is technologically much easier to do. And then see those different versions of BTC and Defi. It can be on an Ethereum roll up or BTC sections, doesn't really matter if we want to focus on more BTC adoption and see it restakable on symbiotic on Eigen layer and not necessarily focusing at all cost to try to have native btc. Because in the end of the day, as we in the beginning, Bitcoin is a store of value and people don't trade physical gold.
00:41:49.211 - 00:42:23.075, Speaker G: Right. It's not meant for this. So it's okay to create a currency for example on top of physical gold. So I think it's okay to create a representation of native BTC and make that representation of native BTC which will be just Coinbase btc, Kraken BTC and so on. Much more fluid, right. And usable in defi on chains like Inc on base and so on and make it restickable and then you let people to earn more rewards and so on. And I think that path can probably more rapidly lead to more adoption of Bitcoin in general.
00:42:25.455 - 00:42:56.015, Speaker H: That's good. Yeah, it's definitely a dynamic and revolving kind of situation. I mean the ecosystem is thriving, but as well as we need to really pay attention to development of BITVM2 and et cetera and those techniques might just be the game changer to really get the BTC fi ecosystem to be more, how to say, just secure and solve the problem of trustless bridging and et cetera, et cetera.
00:42:56.715 - 00:43:02.323, Speaker B: All right, thank you everyone. That concludes this panel. Thanks for your time.
00:43:02.379 - 00:43:03.095, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:43:43.685 - 00:44:36.591, Speaker A: Hello everyone again. I hope you like the first panel. I would now like to ask to the speakers of the second panel to come forward just so we can start to get organized. So Gregory Hill from Bob Rose from Stakestone, Mirku, I know you are around because I've seen you a lot of times already. And of course Juan Simon from Inception. Hello again everyone. We are starting to prepare the second panel.
00:44:36.591 - 00:46:01.355, Speaker A: I would like to ask the speakers to come onto the stage please. We will wait around five minutes for the speakers to join us in the stage. Joan Simois, Mirko and let me recall Rose and of course Gregory Hill. If you could join me up here, that would be great. Once again calling out for the speakers of Inception, Stakestone, Staking Rewards and Bob to come onto the stage.
00:46:03.305 - 00:46:05.833, Speaker H: You have the video released after this event.
00:46:05.889 - 00:46:24.609, Speaker A: It's being transmitted live right now. So we will, we will have it on YouTube and Twitter and keep the video. Yeah, no, it will remain live. It's already been recorded. Just be to do the YouTube so you can check up on everything like. Thank you. Sorry sir.
00:46:24.697 - 00:46:25.065, Speaker F: Tell me.
00:46:25.105 - 00:46:43.123, Speaker A: I will. I will start the second. Yeah, I'm trying to put the speakers all on here. I would like to call again everyone from Bob and Stakestone. You are only the two only members missing. Oh, Bob is already here. Mirko from Staking Rewards.
00:46:43.123 - 00:46:56.225, Speaker A: I know he's around. Oh, sorry sir. So Give me just one minute.
00:49:28.925 - 00:51:34.545, Speaker D: It-22-2.
00:51:36.905 - 00:51:37.481, Speaker A: Too.
00:51:37.593 - 00:51:38.285, Speaker C: Hey.
00:51:47.665 - 00:52:17.131, Speaker A: Hello everyone. I think you can hear me better at the end of the room. Chris from Stakestone. We had a last minute exchange. We are waiting you and we are about to start the second panel of the day and the last one after these you can drink, eat as much as you can and have fun. Crazy is coming. So everyone, we are two minutes away from starting the second panel.
00:52:17.131 - 00:52:41.821, Speaker A: Thank you very much. I would like to ask if you are networking to do it outside so people can hear the panel while we are here. I think all of us can have microphones now. I think each one of us can have a microphone.
00:52:41.853 - 00:52:52.345, Speaker H: Okay, I take roll.
00:52:55.615 - 00:55:50.195, Speaker A: Hello everyone. One minute to kickstart the second panel. This one will be slightly shorter. I would like to ask everyone that is networking over there on the back to just move outside so we can have a better moment for everyone that wants to listen. Camera, cameraman is telling us just chip a little bit. We were less and we were able to fix. All right, all right.
00:55:50.195 - 00:56:18.201, Speaker A: We are ready to kick start the second panel. I hope everyone can hear me slightly better now. Let's try to keep this shorter and simpler guys. First of all, welcome. Sorry for the wait but I'm sure this will be amazing. 1. First of all, can I ask each one of you to introduce yourselves? You are all previous guests so most of the people already know you from our Twitter spaces from our events.
00:56:18.201 - 00:56:21.597, Speaker A: But nevertheless, can I have an introduction from your side?
00:56:21.781 - 00:56:45.235, Speaker C: Absolutely. My name is Joao. I'm a CEO and co founder at Inception Omidchain LRT Protocol and currently going full Meta lrts. And now we are going to share some alpha on Meta lrts here where you can with one click go on multiple infrastructures which we are going to think that is going to revolutionize the space in the early Q1 next year.
00:56:45.575 - 00:56:46.975, Speaker A: Thank you very much Gregory.
00:56:47.135 - 00:57:00.515, Speaker I: Hi guys, I'm Greg, I'm from Bob, the first hybrid L2 where our vision is we want to bring the massive liquidity from Ethereum and Bitcoin. So we're working quite heavily with bitvm to enable that for a promotionless future.
00:57:01.175 - 00:57:27.535, Speaker J: Hi, my name is Moko, I'm CEO and co founder of StakeMods.com and we are staking aggregator over six years now and we integrate different staking opportunities across different assets. We have Ethereum, integrated Bitcoin and many others. So we integrate for example Inceptionality and Bob and different staking opportunities and make it easy for anyone to stake BTC ETH and any other token.
00:57:29.115 - 00:57:50.651, Speaker H: Here is Chris from Stackzone. It's a great honor to be here. I'm co contributor at Stackzone and Stackzone is an omnichannel liquid infrastructure and we help connect liquidity demand side and supply side with our yield bearing and non yield bearing assets namely Stone Yale Bearing East SBDC Non yobearing BTC and Stone BTC yo bearing Bitcoin. Thank you.
00:57:50.803 - 00:58:15.003, Speaker A: All right guys, welcome. I want to kickstart this smoothly but straight to the point. So everyone talks about now Bitcoin, Bitcoin and BTC 5. How can the users start making some yield on bitcoin? What are your views on it and how do you predict this will happen? Short and simple because we will dive deeper into it in a few minutes. Again if any of you wants to kickstart.
00:58:15.099 - 00:59:01.129, Speaker C: Yeah sure, I can start. So first of course we need more AVSs for this, right? So more infrastructure. Currently we have Babylon leading the way and I think that well if you see all the big whales, they are part of the BTC Time BTC ecosystem, right? So BTC wants to go to DeFi. Right? And that's exactly. Our mission is to bring yields to btc is to bring share security to BTC and to make it happen in a way that instead of you having your BTC on your cold wallets doing nothing, at least you get 2, 3, 4% yields on your BTC. The way to do it I think like we are super, super early in the game so there will be a lot, a lot of things to be made and to be researched in early next year. But I think that everyone here is leading the way to that.
00:59:01.129 - 00:59:02.405, Speaker C: So very excited.
00:59:02.745 - 00:59:03.913, Speaker A: Thank you Gregory.
00:59:04.009 - 00:59:15.565, Speaker I: Yeah, I haven't got much to Add to that it was a good answer. I think if I summarize the state of play in the most simplistic way possible. Protocols stake into Babylon users stake into protocols and they get yield.
00:59:16.545 - 00:59:39.625, Speaker J: Yeah, I think nowadays everyone is pretty much used that you can earn some sort of interest on your token because proof of stake is so accepted already with like eth having a yield and so on. So there's actually a lot of people also on BTC that don't do anything with it and wonder what to do really. So they're actively searching for yield as well and it seems like a concept that is ripe also for the BTC space really.
00:59:40.725 - 01:00:16.345, Speaker H: I think for bitcoin there are majorly two kinds of yields. The first is the proof of stake potentials brought by Babylon and the second is alongside all the Bitcoin LRTS LSTs built upon Babylon you can get some more organic rewards in the application layers. For example what Bob is building is you get the interest rate in the lending protocol for a BTC related assets or on a uniswap you can get a trading fees. So I think in general for what kind of assets they are just yields from consensus layer and yields from application similar for PTC as well.
01:00:17.245 - 01:01:02.045, Speaker A: I agree with you and I want to pick on something I think not sure if it was you Gregory or Jerome that said at the beginning about the abses. I'm not sure who mentioned the concept. So right now like Babylon is bringing guild for bitcoin. Babylon is a risk taking platform. Babylon will be supporting absence but what the hell are absent? Because I see a lot of people talking about AVSs and many AVSs coming out but I still receive on the staking circle page it's probably one of the most asked questions is what are the AVSs in the end of the day can you give us like a brief definition from your perspective? How do you see them and what do you think is a proper AVS in the market or that the market really needs?
01:01:05.395 - 01:01:14.215, Speaker H: Yeah, in one sentence AVS is a buyer of the share security no matter is provided by time lock, Bitcoin or the restake Ethereum.
01:01:15.755 - 01:02:00.855, Speaker J: Yeah I guess the issue is really like which AVs, which networks and services that are looking to decentralize really are willing to pay for shared security and can pay for shared security that are also not launching their own token themselves to like be able to stake and already have security that can be used for securing the network. So it has to be something that doesn't have their own token and just wants to buy security. And then somehow there needs to be a lot of revenue generated in that system as well. And I don't know, I haven't seen any yet. That really has like, yeah, generating revenue and also doesn't have a ton because everything seems to have a token. So it's. I mean, that's a bearish case, I guess, on AVS and restaking yield.
01:02:00.855 - 01:02:15.883, Speaker J: But I also think there is a scenario where there actually will be applications that also produce yields. I guess the best would be something like stablecoins, because stablecoins is the only real use case in crypto.
01:02:15.899 - 01:02:25.935, Speaker C: It needs to exist. It needs to exist without yields. We need more and more rewards. We need to evolve, we need to go out of this loop. Otherwise it will be unsustainable.
01:02:26.675 - 01:02:41.323, Speaker J: Yeah, that's what's happening right now. Like it's just kind of more protocols launching everyone, launching their own token and points, and that's pretty much where the yield is coming from. There's no real sustainable yield source yet.
01:02:41.459 - 01:02:47.163, Speaker A: I guess what we need is an AVS without a token. Gregory, do you want to add anything here?
01:02:47.219 - 01:02:49.139, Speaker I: No, I think they've summarized my points perfectly.
01:02:49.307 - 01:03:03.655, Speaker A: All right, guys, trying to keep this short. We have Eigen layer, then we had symbiotic Carac Babylon for btc. What will come next in terms of infrastructure? Nothing.
01:03:04.635 - 01:03:53.427, Speaker C: I think that I can talk a little bit about inception here. Like the way that I think that because there are already a lot of infrastructure providers, is then the job of, of the LRT protocol to actually make a kind of a secondary infrastructure on top that allows the users to restake more easily. Right. So and what we are doing with the meta lrts is really like with one click, you access all the multiple pools and multiple infrastructures in one click. And then all the job of choosing the pools go to the node operators and then choosing the AVs inside of each infrastructure. And we also help bit on that on the back end. But it's really like to simplify the way to restake because it's also again, unsustainable to continue to produce a lot, a lot of infrastructure providers if you don't have yields, if you don't have AVs paying rewards.
01:03:53.427 - 01:04:05.295, Speaker C: So I think that now it's our job in the LRT protocol level to actually help the user to bring even more tvl, even more liquidity by making the journey as simple as possible.
01:04:06.005 - 01:04:13.589, Speaker A: All right, and how do you think all these infrastructures will impact the user strategies at the end of the day.
01:04:13.637 - 01:04:18.105, Speaker C: To get those rewards depends on the avss. How much are you paying?
01:04:18.445 - 01:04:22.905, Speaker H: Yeah, we really do need more AVSs for the existing infrastructure. Right.
01:04:24.085 - 01:04:25.905, Speaker A: Anything you want to add, guys?
01:04:26.365 - 01:04:36.005, Speaker I: Yeah, I think as the ecosystem grows, we're going to see a lot more competition, reduction in fees, additional rewards. Rewards and more ways for users to earn on their Bitcoin specifically.
01:04:36.985 - 01:05:19.453, Speaker A: All right, Picking up on what you said earlier and with the promise that I gave you that these would be shorter, we spoke about points, but points are something. And the incentives programs are something that protocols, AVS infrastructures are all using to bootstrap in the early days of the protocol. What's coming after the points? What's the strategy that protocols are adopting? And. Well, I would like to maybe hear you guys kickstarting on this one, because I think a lot of people now are just stuck on points and they don't know what happens after the points. They just dump the token. And that's not the strategy at the end of the day. So what are you guys planning and what are the steps forward?
01:05:19.629 - 01:05:20.133, Speaker D: Sure.
01:05:20.229 - 01:05:49.675, Speaker I: I think everyone's tired of points by this point. Everyone, their mom has a point system. So it's really overplayed. Blast, I think, innovates in the space quite a lot and it drew a lot of attention back to the protocols and interesting work there. So we're guilty of it. We're running a points program. It's a great way for attracting users and to engage the users on our platform, which they otherwise wouldn't want to facilitate that continued interaction.
01:05:49.675 - 01:06:00.245, Speaker I: But it's a good question, what comes after the points program? From my side, I can't. There's some things I can't say, but there are some expectations. What comes after point system?
01:06:00.285 - 01:06:02.105, Speaker A: Spill the alpha. Spill the alpha.
01:06:04.005 - 01:06:22.405, Speaker I: But I will say that there are many mechanisms point systems do enable. Like the gamification, I think, is one of the best things that come out of it. And it can really. I think we can still use those mechanisms in different ways with different incentives, different ideas, and get those users to continue engaging with our platform and our partners.
01:06:24.625 - 01:07:03.785, Speaker J: I think the thing that really sucks about points is that it's so intransparent, basically how points are actually translating to real tokens in the end. So I think we have to solve the issue that actually when you have some sort of incentives, you need to know exactly how much you're getting out of it. Otherwise there's no point and you're just going to get fucked over by kind of multipliers and bonuses. And I don't know. Then they introduce New points for everything, for this and this and that. And in the end as a user, you don't even know anymore, like what are you getting? Like what does it even mean to get points?
01:07:04.125 - 01:07:10.065, Speaker A: Whales market I think is trying to do some job there, but like even those are not accurate.
01:07:16.915 - 01:08:09.097, Speaker H: Yes, I think like the points is actually becoming a serious problem for the. I would say. Okay, yeah, yeah. So I think points started to become kind of problem for builders in this industry as liquidity providers and users that got tired of it. So I totally agree with the opinion for intransparency and I think a good example for this is probably like Morpho they are offering, they are offering basically intransferable tokens and you can calculate API based on some of the very simple actions like providing liquidity. As long assets you got higher using collaterals, the long tail assets will get lower. So I think actually this is probably something that in the future more protocols would adopt because it is more predictable.
01:08:09.097 - 01:08:48.765, Speaker H: And like for stackstone, at midst of the staking circle event, we announced the new round lead by Polychain with a total of 22mil. So yeah, we are heading to the next stage and definitely we're rethinking about what's the best way we can do in this new stage after this very exciting announcement, how we can further incentivize users with, with more like predictable benefits or have shared more trust and credits, long term credits with those institutional and large LPs that has been working with us for the past years. So I think this is actually something. I think it's kind of pivot points for the points. Yeah.
01:08:49.305 - 01:08:54.525, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Joan, do you want to add something?
01:08:54.865 - 01:09:18.967, Speaker C: Yes. So for us I think ception points is mainly to incentivize the users. It's about community, it's about bringing more incentives and of course preparing the airdrop. Right. So for us it's a way to incentivize communities mainly. But of course that if every protocol, everyone is doing points, it can get tiring and it's like it's just going around and around in the circle. Right.
01:09:18.967 - 01:09:20.135, Speaker C: We need to stop.
01:09:20.255 - 01:09:48.845, Speaker A: All right, thank you for your insights. First of all, welcome. Congratulations on the new founding. Let me just briefly touch base on the Bitcoin ETFs. They started at the beginning of the year. Do you guys foresee that these Bitcoin ETFs will move into defi? Will they bring liquidity to defi or will just be buy and hodl with these new ETFs?
01:09:50.755 - 01:10:15.255, Speaker J: I don't think there were. I think it also took a long time for ETH even to be staked and then there's still a lot of like yeah, regulation and hurdles also in terms of insurance and like really making sure that it's absolutely secure. And we'll have to have the same thing about bitcoin but bitcoin is way more risky to stake in general. So I think it will take a long time.
01:10:15.615 - 01:10:44.513, Speaker A: But don't you think it. Okay, I agree. No, I was about to ask like. I see. I think, I do think that the bitcoin staking paradigm will take some time to be adopted, especially because of the user of bitcoin. It's different than the Ethereum user or the other token users. But do you think the Bitcoin ETF will have a quick shift to the staking environment, to the defi environment or not?
01:10:44.609 - 01:11:07.199, Speaker C: Yes, because it bring more institutional adoption. Of course, more institutional adoption, more money, more investment banks. You know, Blackrock is already in J.P. morgan, you know, like these guys are coming next. Goldman probably coming next. So that's trillions and trillions of dollars that is coming into crypto. And now with the bull market vibes by the way, we just had a new all time high like one hour ago or something so.
01:11:07.199 - 01:11:09.907, Speaker C: So like it's just a matter of time.
01:11:10.091 - 01:11:35.685, Speaker I: Yeah. To harken that I guess. Yeah. We're such an early phase of bitcoin Defi Babylon hasn't even launched and that's one of the biggest opportunities for staking. I think it's just going to take time for the ETFs and regulatory people to realize the opportunities there and slowly adopt it. Of course there's some speculation with the recent results of the US election. Things will shift in a particular way but anyone can guess what's going to happen.
01:11:36.545 - 01:11:37.249, Speaker E: Totally agree.
01:11:37.297 - 01:11:49.257, Speaker H: I think it's always right to dream big. I know some of the bitcoin assets issuers already started doing a pitching so like who knows. But yeah, it's always right to dream big, right?
01:11:49.401 - 01:12:10.835, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much guys, final question for you and I wasn't about to ask this, I skipped this question but you guys mentioned all of you this. What do you think of institutions and bit institutions and bitcoin? Is it something for the long run? Is it something that is just now giving your perspective and we can wrap this up?
01:12:10.955 - 01:12:14.163, Speaker C: Long run? Of course, yeah.
01:12:14.179 - 01:12:30.139, Speaker I: From the Bob side we're seeing a lot of demand. We have a product called Bob Stake and a lot of interest. We're working now with key partners such as staking rewards and seeing real usage from users and institutions that are interested in using it in some capacity. So yeah, I think so yeah, I.
01:12:30.147 - 01:12:53.455, Speaker J: Think that's a huge demand because institutions that are already holding crypto, they, they know that it can stake crypto. It's a concept that is really like starting to be much, much more popular. So I think that there will demand for some sort of like bitcoin staking even at some point. So I think in the long run 100% and I can't wait until micro strategy stakes the bitcoin.
01:12:53.835 - 01:13:11.883, Speaker C: Yeah, but just to, just to give some comment there, the majority of the institutions are actually looking at staking and not restaking for example because restaking is already too risky for now. So I think it will take. Take time to go on restaking, but they're already looking at staking. So it's a matter of maybe staking.
01:13:12.019 - 01:13:15.403, Speaker J: Restaking and then defi and yeah, and.
01:13:15.419 - 01:13:19.895, Speaker C: Then cut up with restaking of restake assets. So that's the final one.
01:13:20.635 - 01:14:13.343, Speaker H: I think institutions definitely the future as like saison majorly work with different kinds of liquidity providers. Most of them are different kinds of institutions miners. I see their interest as well as the real actions in participation gradually increasing over past years. And before this event I spoke with one of our very large institute LPs. They actually said they're internally they're debating because they made attempts for deploying bitcoins, deploying Ethereum assets in staking, restaking on application layers and they got the rewards and they're actually trying to build a long term framework to evaluate different kinds of opportunities. So I see that they actually take actions right with hundreds of millions of dollars and they are actually trying to even with debates with arguments like we just give it up, we never do that. But still half of their teams believe is like Silvers trying and trying to build a framework.
01:14:13.343 - 01:14:20.435, Speaker H: So I think long term speaking with that institution, adoptions and participation is definitely something key.
01:14:20.895 - 01:14:36.115, Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much guys. Any final remarks, any farewells to the people listening to us and bear in mind that at home we have a lot of people listening. We are broadcasting this for you to Twitter. So if you want to give any final remarks, go ahead.
