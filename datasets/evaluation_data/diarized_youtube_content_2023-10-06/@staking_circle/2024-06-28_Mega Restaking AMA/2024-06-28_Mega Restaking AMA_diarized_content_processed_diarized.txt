00:00:00.960 - 00:00:39.397, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello everyone. Welcome to Staking Circle Spaces. I'm Gonzalo. I'm your host at Staking Circle and I'm thrilled to be hosting today's session where we will discuss the current state of the risk taking ecosystem. This is a pivotal moment for Staking Circle as we have gathered the leading LRT protocols to discuss the current state of the industry and its future endeavors. I would like to welcome everyone to the mega risk taking space. This is the first time we have so many restaking protocols together before we do Kickstart because as you know, Staking Circle does a lot of spaces online and we do have a lot of Twitter rug problems.
00:00:39.397 - 00:00:50.905, Speaker A: I just wanted to do a quick mic check and ensure that everyone here is. I can hear everyone. So let me kick start for the ones on my right today. Egan PI, can I hear you guys?
00:00:51.685 - 00:00:55.149, Speaker B: Hey guys, it's nice to be here and looking forward to space.
00:00:55.317 - 00:00:59.689, Speaker A: Nice, nice. I can hear you loud and clear. Thank you. Inception. Can I hear you now?
00:00:59.877 - 00:01:01.905, Speaker C: Hello, hello. Yep, I'm here.
00:01:02.065 - 00:01:05.285, Speaker A: Nice one. Welcome, welcome. Yildness. Can I hear you guys?
00:01:05.785 - 00:01:07.793, Speaker D: Yes, hello, can you hear me?
00:01:07.969 - 00:01:18.105, Speaker A: Yes, loud and clear. Iter fai, can I hear you? Yep. Good morning, good morning. Good morning, Rob. How are you, Kelp doll? Can I hear you?
00:01:18.265 - 00:01:19.745, Speaker E: Yep, I can hear you.
00:01:19.905 - 00:01:33.875, Speaker A: Nice, nice. Thank you very much. Now, swell. Can I hear you? Final one. Good morning. Man, this is unique. First of all, Twitter is not rugging us, so thank you very much, Alan, for this one today.
00:01:33.875 - 00:02:00.157, Speaker A: Guys, it's a pleasure to have you here. Let me just. Before we do kickstart and you give you the interest, let me just give you a quick rundown of the rules and the space guidelines. So we have a lot of people here today on the panel, as you can see. What I will ask you guys is for this to stay all polite. Whenever you want to speak, just use the emoji button on the bottom of your screen. If you click it, you have a hands up raised on the right side.
00:02:00.157 - 00:02:42.617, Speaker A: Just click there if you want to step in into any other protocol or any other speaker comment. And I will give you the time to speak and the opportunity to give your opinion as soon as the person that is speaking at that moment concludes his argument. Basically, let's have some fun altogether. I hope this is a nice space where we can give some insights to the audience. We have a very packed space already, almost 300 people in, so I'm quite excited for this one. And let's kick start with some interest. So if you could give me a quick 45 seconds intro about who you are, what you, what brought you to crypto and of course your protocol.
00:02:42.617 - 00:02:48.579, Speaker A: That would be great kick starting here with Etherfi. Can I hear, Can I hear you guys?
00:02:48.777 - 00:03:28.495, Speaker F: Hey, yeah, good morning. So my name is Rock. I'm one of the co founders over at Ethify. I appreciate you having us on today and looking forward to chatting a bunch of great people up here and yeah, it should be a fun, fun time. We started building Etherfi about a year and a half ago. It's crazy the ride that it's been so, you know, feel super fortunate to have just kind of been able to ride this wave, I think. You know, as you kind of mentioned, we're coming up on some pretty like important times like points meta point season is passing and actual restaking is going to actually have to happen now.
00:03:28.495 - 00:03:35.855, Speaker F: So I'm super excited about where things are kind of where we're going and look forward to chatting with everyone today.
00:03:36.235 - 00:03:41.195, Speaker A: Thank you very much Rock and apologies. Earlier I called you Rock. Apologies on my head.
00:03:41.315 - 00:03:42.935, Speaker F: It's all good. Everyone does it.
00:03:43.715 - 00:03:58.395, Speaker A: No worries. Thank you very much. Now his buffer is not joining yet. They will probably join a little later guys and apologies for that. I guess just as a justification, he told me he was stuck on the plane and couldn't get out. So let's wait for him now. Kelp.
00:03:58.395 - 00:04:02.367, Speaker A: Kelp. Can I hear you guys?
00:04:02.551 - 00:04:24.835, Speaker E: Yep, yep. Hey guys. Hi, good morning, good afternoon, evening wherever you are. My name is Amit. I'm one of the co founders of Kelp Dao. Kelp is a liquidity staking platform started in December last year and live on over 10/L2s and mainnet. Pretty excited to chat with everyone today.
00:04:25.455 - 00:04:35.595, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Amit, welcome to the space. I think it's the first time we host you, so welcome. And now, thank you very much. Can I hear Egan PI, how are you doing?
00:04:36.095 - 00:04:58.685, Speaker B: Hey guys, nice to be here. This is Louis Mark, ama lead of the Magpie ecosystem. So eigenpy is a subdo of Magpie ecosystem and we are the first isolated liquid restaking protocol around the market and currently we are seeing around like a 900 million TVL restaked by the retail and institutional users and looking forward to more questions. Thank you.
00:04:59.225 - 00:05:05.005, Speaker A: Thank you very, very much. Man, that was a quick intro. Thank you. Now Svel, can I hear you guys?
00:05:05.925 - 00:05:28.305, Speaker G: Yeah. Hey guys, glad to be here. Thanks for arranging the space. I think it's the most people I've ever seen in a space. Well done. Yeah, swell's Liquid Staking protocol and Liquid Restaking protocol together. We are Busy launching the swell L2, bringing all of the different LTS and LSTs together into one ecosystem.
00:05:28.305 - 00:05:32.375, Speaker G: And yeah, happy to be here and excited to chat today.
00:05:32.525 - 00:05:36.139, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Man, I didn't hear your name. It's Killian, correct?
00:05:36.187 - 00:05:37.331, Speaker G: Kilian. Yeah.
00:05:37.443 - 00:05:47.015, Speaker A: All right, just so I do try to call you for the first name and apologies guys, if I do forget it. Your first name I'll call for the protocol name. It's easier now. Yildnest. How are you guys?
00:05:47.555 - 00:06:26.987, Speaker D: Hello there. Good evening. Here for me and good morning, Good afternoon for everybody. I'm Amadeo Brands from the Yieldnest Protocol. We are a liquid restaking protocol, building liquid restaking strategies, Defi strategies and yeah integrated and collaborating with curve frags and most of the biggest protocols in Defi have been around for some time working on this now for around six months and we are excited to bring the real yield and the realness back into restaking. So we're very excited to talk about this topic with everybody here today. Thank you.
00:06:27.171 - 00:06:33.587, Speaker A: Thank you very much. That was a good intro. And now for the final ones. Last but not least, Inception. How are you guys?
00:06:33.771 - 00:07:05.519, Speaker C: Hello. Hello, I'm Joo, one of the co founders of Inception. So currently Inception is an omnichain LRT protocol and we are, we have the 12 LSTs restaking plus native staking on ETH. Also building an insurance against slashing on chain. Currently we are releasing this week. Also the Flash and Stake solution where users can unstake in a matter of minutes. Also very excited to be here today.
00:07:05.519 - 00:07:17.395, Speaker C: Very excited for these questions and very excited for the future of risk taking. Until the rest of the year many things will happen and it's an amazing space. So thank you for welcoming us here.
00:07:18.255 - 00:07:52.455, Speaker A: My pleasure. To be honest, it's a pleasure to host every one of you here. There's a lot of to unravel here in lrts. I do want to kick start things on a smooth way. So looking into your business models. As you all know, unfortunately least recently one of the early players of the risk taking industry exited the market citing a lack of profitability. How are you guys developing your business models to ensure long term profitability and sustainability of your protocol? If anyone wants to kickstart, go ahead, raise your hand and you can start.
00:07:54.635 - 00:08:36.661, Speaker C: I can start right off the bat actually. Yeah. So the way that I'm looking at the space. So first as exactly Rox said in Etherfi, like point season is starting to be over. And we are going to be looking at Eigenlayer now for the next releases and actually the real restaking happening and the increasing of the yields. And not only that, but we are also looking at other infrastructure providers such as Symbiotic or Karak for example, that also promised to have a new view on restaking. And this is also very exciting for the space and specifically for Inception.
00:08:36.661 - 00:09:21.845, Speaker C: The way that we are also looking at this problem and looking at the vision for the future is to start onboarding also new forms and new cryptos to restaking such as Bitcoin. So this is something that we are looking very seriously now and also looking at Babylon and ways to do restaking on top of btc. So we believe that that is definitely the next step so we can have of course higher yields and more using other types of assets to continue to evolve and to bring more innovation to the space. So this is my take on it, but very happy to hear what the other guys have.
00:09:23.465 - 00:09:35.045, Speaker A: Thank you very much. And I think you've touched point on some of the things we will discuss later. Guys, who wants to jump next and tell us a little bit about your business models and how you are avoiding it? Yeah, go ahead.
00:09:35.595 - 00:10:38.929, Speaker D: Yeah, I can go next so. No, I fully agree still the point system meta is over and especially the intransparent point systems I think are gone and we need to bring in the real yield and I think that will comment from vertical integrating different restating protocols. Really cool to see Nectar, Symbiotic and Eigen layer. These spawns are the, the one I see building real things and also the other ones are interesting keeping an eye on them and you see all of them having like different approaches on how to build node networks, how to build modular like security stacks. And we now need to go to do a lot of like these hackathons and see what everybody is building. And we're also building our own AVs right now. We built, we recently won the prize in the Eigenlayer hackathon that we participate in and over the, over the weekend we build our own AVs called point guards that kind of like deterministically shows kind of like all the point systems and any point system can plug into that.
00:10:38.929 - 00:11:45.205, Speaker D: So I do think that real AVsS are coming and I think the real yield for the profitability for the liquid restaking protocols will come from different defi strategies that can be implemented and different verticals with like other restaking platforms like Symbiotic or Nectar and, and Eigenlayer of course. And I think that will bring in new forms of yield and that will bring in new product possibilities. And I also think that the LRT protocols like ourselves should probably show a little bit away with coming out with some fess, probably for our own infrastructure to harden that and to kind of showcase how that shared security modules can be used. Because I think there's a lot of misconceptions in the market right now. A lot of AVS's are still pretty immature. So I do think it's still a little bit far away to be honest, like the real like AVS yields. But I do think there's a lot of other forms of yield that you can also include under the restaking umbrella, basically.
00:11:46.465 - 00:11:47.201, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:11:47.233 - 00:12:04.975, Speaker F: And can I step in? What other yields do you think you'd include? I'm very curious. Sorry, you said you thought there was other yields. Like besides like ABS's coming online. What other yields are you like referring to? I'm curious on thoughts on that.
00:12:05.835 - 00:12:41.073, Speaker D: Yeah, so basically you can generate yields for different kind of defi strategies that alluring to. So there's yields with an active valid service with like restaking capital. But there's also like other platforms that kind of do. They do more like modular security in different ways. You get yield in other forms basically. For example, making sure that certain LP pools are stable, building our own AVs, et cetera, et cetera, or networks or whatever you call them.
00:12:41.129 - 00:12:42.961, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
00:12:43.033 - 00:12:44.045, Speaker C: Okay, cool.
00:12:44.545 - 00:12:48.655, Speaker A: Rock. If you want to step in next and give your take on this one, go ahead.
00:12:48.815 - 00:12:51.447, Speaker F: Yeah, what was the actual question? Sorry.
00:12:51.631 - 00:12:59.755, Speaker A: Basically how you guys are developing and ensuring that your business model ensures a long term profitability of the protocol and sustainability of the same.
00:13:01.055 - 00:13:48.747, Speaker F: Yeah, so we come from the web2world so like profitability is something that we've thought about since day one. And so we're building something that's vertically integrated. And so ultimately like we want to replace banks. So people who want to be like off like completely on chain, we want to make that a reality for people. So we started with E to 5 stake that's you know, been super successful. The points meta played super well. There's like some really big real yield that could be earned from you know, from both retail or like more degen who were taking the YT of Pendle and then the PT play which like seemed like a lot of institutions were playing.
00:13:48.747 - 00:14:22.839, Speaker F: So there's actually some of these really good strategies that kind of came. So that's kind of how we started. Then we built Etherfi Liquid and our thought on that was like, you know, people don't want to spend as much time like doing these defi strategies. Like obviously there's people that do want to do that but like, you know, take it a step further. If we're going to onboard A next 100 million people, which I think is necessary for all of us to be successful, like sometimes I think it gets lost. We're in this very small space. Like we don't win if the space doesn't grow.
00:14:22.839 - 00:15:09.859, Speaker F: So we have to grow the space and so we got to think about how we like onboard more people into the space and so we just think we need to make defi easy and that's kind of what we did with Etherfi liquid. So basically with a couple of buttons or a couple clicks of the button, you get deployed into defi strategies that you don't have to manage. So think of it as like an ETF on the stock market market. Like you just put money in there and they manage where the money goes. And then the third thing that we're doing, you know, we're in pre signup phase is Etherfi cash. And so Etherfi cash is an actual Visa credit card that you're going to be able to use in stores and yeah, so that one's super exciting. So for people who want to live on chain, it's just an unbelievable opportunity and so like we've got super, super good feedback about that.
00:15:09.859 - 00:15:35.045, Speaker F: So that's what we're doing. Everything is vertically integrated. We're focused on profitability. Like at some point the air gets sucked out and so I think that's, that's important, you know, tons of market dynamics to play out within restaking and where they are. So if we've seen anything within crypto people will be attracted to the yield and so you know, that's kind of what we've done, how we've done about things.
00:15:35.945 - 00:15:46.195, Speaker A: Thank you very much. I think that's a pretty insightful answer and emadow as well. Pretty much a pretty good answer with Davies Kelp Dows. Do we want to follow up Amit?
00:15:46.315 - 00:15:47.427, Speaker E: Yep, for sure.
00:15:47.491 - 00:15:47.739, Speaker G: Thanks.
00:15:47.787 - 00:16:34.455, Speaker E: Thanks for this very interesting question. So obviously we've been quite, quite conscious about the way we grow as well as the way we build the decentralized org. Profitability is a function of both obviously the revenues as well as the cost structure of the, of the protocol. So in both, under both scenarios we've been quite conservative as well as building the right teams when it comes to revenues. We obviously like most of the protocols here we charge a percentage of staking rewards and obviously that extends to percentage of restaking rewards when actually the rewards from protocols, rewards from the avss go live. So that is one set of revenues. As we scale, obviously those revenues grow.
00:16:34.455 - 00:17:12.639, Speaker E: The other thing that we are also doing kind of what ETHERFI is already doing, which is like we are also starting an earn section but with a with a set of innovative offerings that will probably go live in a few weeks from now where we have a significantly higher revenue potential. Beyond that we are also expanding to the infrastructure space where we are actually building the restaking protocol ourselves on other L1s. So those are the 3 main revenue sources that will make us sustainable and.
00:17:12.807 - 00:17:20.911, Speaker A: Those three revenue sources are already pretty good. Thank you very much Amit. Now Lou, can I hear your take from EG and PI?
00:17:21.103 - 00:18:26.001, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah sure. So like at Macbeth Ecosystem like sustainability and like the natural growth are the fundamental factors that driving our development strategy. So this approach extends to EIGENPY as well. So although we are currently in the prelaunch and like point accumulation session, we are committed to being like cautious and deliberate in every step that we take. So like our focus is on embracing natural and sustainable practices like similar to all of the other subdos of the MAGPA ecosystem. So rather than solely pursuing metrics that may harm other components of egumpy such as like the token holders and other our partners. So like basically we will be community oriented as the our core of our philosophy and we aim to establish a self sustainable protocol that operates on a platform revenue rather than relying on heavily on token emissions to push the stats of our protocol.
00:18:26.001 - 00:18:46.665, Speaker B: So like as I mentioned like our goal is to create harmonious and mutually beneficial environment where all stakeholders are benefiting from the revenue that we take and the overall platform like the benefits from the revenue that we receive from risk taking.
00:18:48.605 - 00:18:56.865, Speaker A: Thank you very much for that insightful take. Now to close this topic Kylian, do you want to give a swell perspective on this?
00:18:57.625 - 00:19:42.585, Speaker G: Yeah, sure. So I think like as everyone has mentioned, all LSTs and allot generally have the same base model, right? Everyone like the industry Standard is a 10% commission and then you know, half of that is shared with the node operators. But I think we can all agree that will likely trend down over time. So you know, the way Swallow's looking at it is that's partly why we went the L2 route. You know we felt that. I guess we'll chat about it a bit later in one of the other questions but you know one of the core pieces of the restaking economy is these AVs is actually generating real yield, right. And finding a clear use case for what they're building.
00:19:42.585 - 00:20:37.585, Speaker G: And you know, it's our belief that we can bring that and create that ecosystem for them to thrive on small L2. So not only supplying security on one hand, but actually providing an ecosystem for them to find product market fit on the chain and to give them a kickstart in that way. And of course there's the L2 revenue model that most L2s have, which is sequencer fees. So that is one avenue. But I think as we all know that will be decentralized over time and that's exactly what eigenlay enables, decentralized sequences. So yes, we are still early on that and I think the tech still needs to be battle tested in production and sort of prove itself. But yeah, for swallow it would be the L2 and growing in that direction.
00:20:39.365 - 00:21:18.673, Speaker A: Thank you very much for your take. I think it's pretty clear that each of you has a different strategy and a different route. But at least as someone that is using the industry that is exploring the risk taking space, I found it relieving to know that we have solutions in the market, different solutions. Each one of you is exploring its own one. Of course AVSS will do a big part of it. So yeah guys, thank you very much for this first question and for this first discussion. I want to now jump into the second topic and is about basically moving on to the base infrastructure where you develop your protocols, which is again layer.
00:21:18.673 - 00:21:43.025, Speaker A: It's anticipated that Eigen will introduce slashing features by the end of the year. These slashing features will be applied to both operators which of course can impact your protocols. How are you guys preparing for the introduction of these slashing features and do you have any concerns about their application or have you spoken with Eigen Layer about it? Tell us a little bit more on your insights.
00:21:43.565 - 00:23:08.655, Speaker C: Yeah, I can start once again. Yeah, so regarding slashing conditions, I think this is a topic that has been discussed between all the protocols and even within the Eigen layer community since day one. I do believe and I remember that when I talked with Chiram in I think was in October or November, he said that after the slashing conditions applied in this Q3, Q4 like all the LRTs need to be prepared for it. And one thing that we are doing in Inception and I know that Buffer is also doing a similar solution which is by avoiding slashing we are preparing ourselves a more on chain solution which will be slashing insurance and by the client will have the possibility to choose the percentage of how much eth, for example, they want to insure. And we want to make sure that by having separated pools and these pools being fed by the fees that user pays for this insurance, we want to make sure that up to a certain amount the user can be covered more than 50% will be.
00:23:15.995 - 00:23:21.895, Speaker A: I'm not sure I'm the only one with the problem, but I just lost Johan's voice.
00:23:22.955 - 00:23:25.539, Speaker D: I can hear you, but I cannot hear John.
00:23:25.587 - 00:23:25.827, Speaker F: Hello.
00:23:25.851 - 00:23:26.437, Speaker C: Hello.
00:23:26.611 - 00:23:27.377, Speaker D: Hello.
00:23:27.561 - 00:23:30.113, Speaker A: You cut it off to beat. Can you repeat?
00:23:30.289 - 00:23:35.165, Speaker C: Okay, okay. For sure, for sure. Now I was saying that when did you lost me, by the way?
00:23:35.905 - 00:23:43.961, Speaker A: You were talking about the insurance against sloshing and then like somewhere between. I lost it.
00:23:44.073 - 00:24:48.853, Speaker C: Okay, okay, okay. So I was just saying that the way that we are looking at it is we want to in the first phase to make sure that our insurance covers can cover up to 50% of the user ETH or LSTS. And by doing this, we will have pools that will be fed by the fees that the user pay when they want to ensure their own eth. Since that slashing on Ethereum is actually pretty low, we are confident that we can make a solution that is viable that can protect at least 50% of the users on the first phase. And then we want of course to start to upgrade it to a higher standard. But in general case, I do believe that every protocol should have some kind of either insurance or a mechanism to avoid slashing as Puffer has, or any type of solution. There could be multiple solutions for this problem, but definitely the higher the leverage the most solutions you need to have to protect the user.
00:24:48.853 - 00:24:56.305, Speaker C: So that's why we are actively working on this solution for quite a while and we plan to release it before I.
00:25:01.245 - 00:25:04.117, Speaker A: Unsure if it is me, but I lost slash.
00:25:04.301 - 00:25:30.027, Speaker D: Somebody is slashed. I actually think that the best analogy for like an AVS or like uptime compute or SLA or however you want to call it like an avs is basically like restate security, right? Like you could even with this. It's like if I'm speaking on Twitter, I want to have uptime and I want people to guarantee that to me. And if that goes down, you get slashed.
00:25:30.051 - 00:25:30.775, Speaker G: Exactly.
00:25:37.995 - 00:25:39.435, Speaker C: I think I'm back, right?
00:25:39.595 - 00:25:43.011, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we can hear. Can I ask you to conclude, please? Yeah, yeah.
00:25:43.043 - 00:25:59.899, Speaker C: So I was just concluding, saying that I do believe that all the protocols should have some type of solution until year end for this because we are working with a lot of leverage and the more leverage you have, you should have definitely A solution to protect your users.
00:25:59.987 - 00:26:12.425, Speaker A: So yeah, that's for sure. And appreciate Inception for developing that. Is anyone else developing such a solution? Proffer is not here. So. Yeah, Yildest, can you go ahead? I saw you wanted me to, so.
00:26:13.045 - 00:26:43.009, Speaker D: Oh yeah, no, I can go next. No, that's, that's a great solution. I think democratizing it like and giving the users options to ensure themselves is a great way to do it. And of course standard ways is democratizing the slicing risk. I actually have quite a controversial take on it. I do think that in a flourishing restaking ecosystem and in a flourishing like these kind of risk, you should make the risks transparently. You should make very clear for a user before he enters a product for what he's actually restaking on.
00:26:43.009 - 00:27:43.415, Speaker D: And I see a future where we don't have one, not 100 aviators, but thousands of like AVS is and also like where bigger corporations use AVs or insurance companies or you know, like I always say, like the real defi revolution will start when we see mortgages on chain or things like that. And then you get, you know, you get real decentralized financial activity, a real parallel financial system. If that happens, then restaking or staking or slicing could also be seen as risk underwriting and things like that. Right. And there's multiple ways to insure against that or there's multiple ways to construct different structured products that kind of move the risks around. And then there are certain yields that associate with the risks that are associated with, with the products you're using. And from the yieldness perspective, what we are doing, we're collaborating with the Llama risk team that's also working for Curve and Prisma.
00:27:43.415 - 00:28:58.135, Speaker D: And then we have, we white label that risk team under the name the Yieldness Risk Team. And we just, we are going to publish like an extensive kind of AVs and operator selection criteria. So we dove like really deep into for example, Eigenda and we are analyzing and seeing all the centralized factors and all the yeah, issues besides the slashing, there's a lot of other risks involved in, in, in, in restaking that I think a lot of players are not really aware of. So we, we are highlighting all the risks, making everything very transparent in pretty deep and extensive risk reports and also like academic reports on like what, what is the risks on that product that you're using? We make these risks transparent and we build like derivative products where people can transparently see risks, see yields and decide themselves how they want to kind of handle that. I think that, you know, of Course, we, we are protecting users, but we need to make these things transparent because I'm actually of the opinion if you don't have real slashing or real risk, there will also never be real yields. So yeah, that's my opinion.
00:28:58.835 - 00:29:10.095, Speaker A: Allow me to ask, are you publishing these research papers publishedly or are you keeping them still private? Because that's pretty interesting and as a researcher of the industry, I would like to read those.
00:29:10.635 - 00:29:37.313, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's all open source. So you can go to yieldnas Finance and then you go to our documentation and you can find all these risk reports. They're a little bit, they're not hidden on purpose. It's just that we're kind of like overloaded with a lot of things and there's a couple of new releases coming up. I just like, just finished coding so like I'm just now on the space. So we're doing a lot of things. It's more like the information is all there, it's all open source, it's all going to be used for everybody.
00:29:37.313 - 00:30:08.945, Speaker D: We're building frameworks for operators, framework for avss. We're building our own AVSS to kind of secure certain infrastructure parts. And that's all going to be open sourced. We believe in open source development and all these components will be open. And I must say that Eigenlay of Etrify and Yield NAS are the only actual and I think Inception maybe as well. But we were developing everything in the open. If you go to our GitHub, you can see all the code and all the things that we're pushing just in the open.
00:30:10.325 - 00:30:14.157, Speaker C: We have everything open. Yes, yes, true, yes.
00:30:14.301 - 00:30:22.535, Speaker D: I think it's Inception and Etrify and Yield NAS that is developing in the open. So I think that should give a shout out.
00:30:23.555 - 00:30:36.375, Speaker A: All right guys, thank you very much. Now I want to move this question for swell. So Kylian, how are you guys preparing for these conditions or are you considering even more risks as Yield Nest is also considering.
00:30:37.675 - 00:31:24.461, Speaker G: Yeah, sure. So we are working really closely with Gauntlet. I'm sure everyone's familiar with, with Gauntlet and what they actually do, but yeah, we are leaning heavily on their expertise. We have like a lot of back and forth and you know, meeting with them weekly, discussing this, planning, strategizing, because I think I recall, I think it was Rock or Mike that mentioned it in E. Denver, but it takes one slashing event and it's game over for liquid restaking protocols. So, you know, the aim is to keep our users as safe as possible, to make sure we're working with the best people in the space to ensure that. And yeah, that ultimately creates the best user experience.
00:31:24.461 - 00:31:34.765, Speaker G: Right. You don't as a user want to be, you know, boring and stressing at night on whether or not you'll wake up and you got roped by getting slashed.
00:31:34.805 - 00:31:35.413, Speaker E: Right.
00:31:35.589 - 00:32:13.137, Speaker G: It shouldn't be like taking a meme coin trade and holding it overnight and waking up and getting a bit of a fright. So I think that's how we see it. And I think, you know, another way to really mitigate a large amount of the risk is working with really professional operators, which we have done. We were very specific about the operators we wanted to bring on board. Right. Really respected and well known players in the industry and a lot of them do have their own slashing insurance in place. So you know, there's all these different ways that you can mitigate the risk.
00:32:13.137 - 00:32:21.165, Speaker G: But yes, something's out of your control. But as far as possible do what you can as a protocol to keep your users safe.
00:32:23.265 - 00:32:33.485, Speaker A: Thank you very much. And I think that's pretty good and insightful answer to this question. Eigenpay, do you want to compliment it or take on it?
00:32:33.795 - 00:33:48.975, Speaker B: So like basically we don't have insurance solution yet but like it's a cool idea but like when it comes to like avoiding the slashing risk and taking precautions, like we place our trust in operators who demonstrate the honesty and competence similar to individuals selecting staking services on Ethereum. Like we prioritize operators who have a track record avoiding like slashable offenses and maintenance or active participation in preventing inactivity lack penalties. Like it's important to note that operators may differ in avss they validate and each AVS carries its own level of risks. So to mitigate the risks effectively we take time to carefully select operators and to stake with and we consider not only the potential yield but also the cumulative risk associated with the AVSs they validate. So by making informed choices and evaluating both of the operators repetition and risk profiles of the AVSs they support so we can limit the like our exposure to potential slashing risks.
00:33:49.635 - 00:33:54.335, Speaker A: I think that's a pretty good answer. Emmerdale, I saw you raising your hand.
00:33:55.955 - 00:34:41.612, Speaker D: Oh, sorry. But no, I was just an observation that I think by offloading that responsibility to operators, I think that's. That's wrong. I think but after that also mentioned you're looking also into the AVS's. But in my opinion the operators we are working with we actively monitor. So like when we. Yeah, we are very selective with operators and then we actively monitor operators and have also a way that we have the AVS is with a whole framework that we're analyzing and I think that is probably the way and then it would be really good for I think our industry to all publish all our risk insights openly.
00:34:41.612 - 00:34:44.664, Speaker D: So yeah, let's all try to do that.
00:34:46.804 - 00:34:54.464, Speaker A: Thank you very much. I think you got some claps from fellow protocols so pretty much agree that we can all agree on that one.
00:34:54.845 - 00:35:29.755, Speaker E: I just have a couple of. Yeah, I just had a couple of points that I that I I think are relevant here. I think there's a lot of scare around the risks of slashing with regards to restaking. While I agree to most of the points, I think one needs to also keep in mind that slashing is a very statistically insignificant event. In the entire history of Ethereum POS there there were hardly any slashing events, maybe one or two. So just to. Just to sort of.
00:35:29.835 - 00:36:35.517, Speaker D: I completely disagree with that because I think that in a flourishing restaking ecosystem kind of all the bumpers should be removed. So I think that we will see if yes, that might slash more often and we see also custom slashing where it's not just slashing in the sense of like just destroying or burning capital, it's also maybe paying out insurance claims or things like that. So I think it's. It's a bit broader and I do think that that even slashing on Ethereum is something you need to take very seriously as a liquid restaking protocol as a LSD or as a if you are home. I'm a personal home staker and now also building we are yielding also has a native restake token and that happens more often than you think. Like there's always something that could go wrong also is very little or you mission so you need to always take that into account when you're designing or architecting your protocol. And I think for restaking slashing is going to be more of a thing, more of a feature than a bug because you can also do custom slashing and capital allocation or risk underwriting.
00:36:35.517 - 00:37:06.785, Speaker D: So I think it is something that we need to take very seriously. But I do agree that it's in the beginning the fears of Ethereum existential events or things like that, I think that's less of a issue. But generally as a liquid restaking protocol I think that slashing mitigation or at least making transparent the risk, making the risk transparent and making transparently on what is restaked on and what risks associate associated with that is very important.
00:37:08.165 - 00:38:11.325, Speaker E: I think what you're saying makes sense, but I think it's also important for us to be a little more objective here. I'm not, by no means I'm advocating for not being careful regarding slashing. I think it's also important for us to put numbers behind some of these subjective assessment of slashing. That's why I wanted to sort of bring up and educate the listeners here about the number of instances of slashing and the amount of slashing. So using Ethereum as an example or a reference point, those events have been insignificant. But obviously at the same time as liquid restaking protocols, slashing will definitely be an important aspect in the design of the protocol as well as selection of validators and potentially designing the tokenomics for liquid restaking protocol. So obviously a lot of liquid restaking protocols here have selected some of the best quality operators to validate their eth or run their nodes.
00:38:11.325 - 00:39:12.925, Speaker E: So all of those design choices are definitely quite important. And monitoring those as well as the clients that these guys are using and not overly relying on a single client are also quite critical elements or aspects of the design. Beyond that, there are certain interesting models that we could look at like using governance token as a way to ensure against any potential slashing events could be other areas that one could look at and we are definitely working in that direction as kelp. Apart from working with some of the, some of the risk managers that others have mentioned, the likes of Gauntlet or Chaos that will help define and design the right set of delegation strategy for the protocol will also help. So these are some of the important aspects that at least like we are considering and I'm sure a lot of other players as well are considering these.
00:39:14.985 - 00:39:23.249, Speaker A: Thank you Emmet for your reply. And yeah, now I do have a small remark to make. Rock, can you hear us?
00:39:23.337 - 00:39:25.241, Speaker F: And apologies guys, but yeah, I'm here.
00:39:25.313 - 00:39:28.645, Speaker A: Okay, good. Can you give your take on this one?
00:39:29.305 - 00:39:39.245, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean I think there's just so many market dynamics to play out on. This is my honest answer. So, you know, one of the things in crypto that's interesting is like.
00:39:41.025 - 00:39:41.313, Speaker C: You.
00:39:41.329 - 00:40:21.083, Speaker F: Can be as transparent as you want to on things. I honestly don't think, you know, users really like look into the security and whatnot and so it's just kind of on the protocols to provide a product that people can trust and whatnot. Crypto is one of those industries. I think you start from a place of distrust, but as you start to earn trust, you know, it flywheels and kind of go. So the, the whole ABS space And where it is like, you know, as well mentioned as Kelp has mentioned, like there's so many market dynamics that need to play out. It's. It's still just points, right? I'm happy to see that there's other competitors coming into the space.
00:40:21.083 - 00:40:42.375, Speaker F: I think that that's a good thing. I actually really appreciate what Eigen layer has done in taking their approach. Like they built this like amazing thing. A lot of people have got frustrated like them not being overly commercial but like that's, that's totally a call that eigenlayer gets to make. Like it doesn't mean they're not building great stuff.
00:40:43.115 - 00:40:43.427, Speaker D: So.
00:40:43.451 - 00:41:22.945, Speaker F: But I think it's helpful that symbiotic crack nectar are all coming into play here. So we'll see as these things come out. Like payments and slashing are the first things that need to happen. Otherwise like, no, there's, there's no difference between, you know, staking and restaking outside of like additional risk. So like rewards just really need to happen and happen, you know, quickly in order for like TBL to stay within the space. So I think that's one of the biggest things we're kind of keeping our eyes on and making sure that we're, we're kind of there and playing. So yeah, we'll see as it, as it plays out.
00:41:22.945 - 00:41:44.235, Speaker F: But it's, it's, you know, I think the next three months are pretty important as far as what kind of gets built. I love that ABs are starting to come online. So we just had another one come online yesterday with Hyperlane and then you know, Lagrange is online, I NDA is online. So there's like a lot of really good stuff that's, that's starting to happen and building in the space.
00:41:46.175 - 00:42:14.329, Speaker A: That'S for sure. Thank you very much guys for your replies. I were pretty insightful. So for everyone on the space, I see that you are having some issues. So I keep having my guests dropping off the panel and asking to return yield as I'm giving you guys again putting you back on. So for anyone and let me just do this small remark, anyone is on the space listing, we do have a live giveaway. You can crawl to the top of this Twitter space on the post you have all the rules.
00:42:14.329 - 00:43:04.997, Speaker A: The first step to participate on this giveaway is to of course be here. The second one is to follow staking circle and we will be doing the rewards distribution by the end of the space. Now coming back to the space topics once again, thank you for your earlier discussion. It was pretty insightful on what you guys are doing to protect and to basically ensure that your users won't be slashed. I think was Amit that highlighted that there were only like two or three slashes in Ethereum and we do expect to have not so as many slashes in restaking. But as the AVS grow and the node operators start to increase as well, there's always that risk and I'm glad that you are taking the precautions. Now guys, touching base on these AVSs related, there's a common discussion in the space and I've spoken with some of you before about this.
00:43:04.997 - 00:43:39.255, Speaker A: I think there's not a pretty clear answer. I know that from the panel here we have different approaches to it, but basically what the Eigen layer infrastructure allows is protocols to choose operators and then operators of course validate each AVS transactions. How are you guys planning to do it? Will you choose the operators based on the AVS they are backing or will you choose the operators based on the yields they are generating? Do you already have a clear overview on how you're going to do it or not? Rock, since you were the last one to speak, do you want to kickstart this one?
00:43:40.075 - 00:43:40.855, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:43.835 - 00:44:37.599, Speaker F: It'S an interesting marketplace, right? It's kind of like this three sided marketplace that needs to happen. It seems that the absence operators are starting to work pretty well together. So that's a good thing, I mean for us. And like once your validators get spun up, you know, the cost of changing validators is high. So the operators that we currently have are probably the ones that we'll, we'll be with. We are continuously bringing new ones on, but we will keep the operators that we have and try, you know, find out an AVS of Which of the 15 operators you know will work with them to kind of work that way. So yeah, I think it'll be more AVS driven of where we want to be and then like we'll find the proper like operator to kind of work with it.
00:44:37.647 - 00:44:44.355, Speaker A: So yeah, all right, thank you very much Kelp. Now do you want to go next, Amit?
00:44:45.615 - 00:44:47.853, Speaker E: Yep, I can. Could you please repeat the question?
00:44:47.999 - 00:45:13.285, Speaker A: So my question is more is regarding the AVSs and operators. So basically what the infrastructure or the layout the framework proposes is that protocols will choose operators to delegate their stakes. However, there's like a clear discussion if protocols will be choosing operators based on their APR or based on the AVS they are supporting. What are you guys planning to do?
00:45:14.435 - 00:45:39.987, Speaker E: So there's a. Let's, let's probably break it down into two time frames, right? Short term and long term. In the short term, because there is no, there's no slashing yet on the avss. So obviously there is an interest in delegating to as many AVSs as possible and also letting the operators that are working with us delegate to as many AVsS as possible.
00:45:40.051 - 00:45:40.599, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:40.747 - 00:46:02.367, Speaker E: Because they could be giving out points or once they start giving out yields that the users don't want to be, miss out on that. But in the long term, when the, when I can layer introduces slashing, that is when some of the, some of the points that we discussed during the conversation about slashing becomes very critical and important.
00:46:02.431 - 00:46:02.631, Speaker A: Right?
00:46:02.663 - 00:46:10.585, Speaker E: That is when we'll be a lot more cautious and assist the risks in the right way before we pick the right abs.
00:46:12.045 - 00:46:28.065, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much, Amit. Guys, I will have to ask to speed up the answers a little bit just so we are able to to come to an end. We are getting slightly behind. So Lou from eg, do you want to give your take on it?
00:46:29.005 - 00:47:18.295, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So like on in pie, we believe like striking a balance between two. So while selecting reliable node operators in vital for maintaining the network integrity, we also understand the importance of choosing the right avss. So egimpy places a strong emphasis on optimizing performance and returns for our users and we prioritize a comprehensive approach to carefully evaluate both node operators and avss. So moving forward we will continue to monitor and assess the performance of our node operators and avss. And we maintain an open and iterative approach taking into account like the data. And our goal is to create a robust and efficient liquid restaking protocol that maximizes the performance.
00:47:20.715 - 00:47:24.055, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Now Kylian from Swell.
00:47:25.995 - 00:48:47.645, Speaker G: Yeah, I think for us, I think like the flow of events is, you know, you first select the operators you want to work with and then from there you would delegate to them on eigenlay and they would then run specific AVSs. So yes, all the operators are basically running all the AVSs for now, but let's just think a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of which AVsS we would want to support and you know, have those operators run those AVSs. I think it comes down to like what is that avs actually doing, right? Are they sustainable? Are they building something that's useful to the ecosystem? You know, will they produce revenue outside of the token? Right. Just being just selling your token for security. I think those are all honest and hard questions we have to ask ourselves, you know, and what we're Doing at Swell is working closely with all the AVs, speaking to them regularly, seeing how they're developing, you know, how's healthy service that they're building actually growing. And how can we actually be a help to them? How can we help you in the broader ecosystem? Right, because it can be daunting and you know, introducing and playing sort of a middleman between them and where they want to be. So yeah, I think that's, that's how we see it and that's how we've been filtering through the AVs thus far.
00:48:54.195 - 00:48:55.375, Speaker D: I can go next.
00:48:55.915 - 00:49:01.455, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, I was muted saying that Rowan muted himself so he could get next.
00:49:02.115 - 00:50:15.295, Speaker C: Okay, yeah. So in Inception the way that we are doing things is instead of choosing the AVS's ourselves, we are betting on the node operators, meaning that we are choosing the best node operators in the space that have already reputation. And by working with the best node operators we are putting this, let's say, responsibility of choosing the avss on the node operators. So instead of literally wasting our time by going on infinite list of AVSs, we just bet on having the best relationship with the best node operators ourselves. Then we delegate this responsibility of cherry picking the avss to the node operators which will be better equipped to do it than ourselves. And we focused on building the best solution for our users instead of just going on and doing due diligence on all the AVSs we prefer to build relationship with node operators. And then we do believe that this is the best way to do it because that's what they are good at doing.
00:50:16.435 - 00:50:44.185, Speaker A: So pocket question for you Jo. I saw that you guys have DVT technology for the staking part of init. Do you also will work with SSV to apply the same technology on the operators on the restaking site? I guess we cannot hear you again, Joan. So Amadeo, you can go next and reply.
00:50:45.605 - 00:52:06.795, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think this is a super critical topic, right? So at yieldnest we are making the best risk adjusted return with our yieldness curated products, right? So we have yieldness curated products and we also have a way for other external parties to create products as well. And how we do that in the yieldness created products is basically we have our own kind of strategy engine that we built on top of eigenlayer and the strategy engine will also be used to build on top of the other restaking protocols and we build like kind of like structured products around that. And basically I do think that a liquid restaking protocol does need to actually select and analyze all the AVSs they work with and then monitor the nodes that are running the avss. I don't think we can offload that responsibility to the nodes itself, in my opinion. And I also think that the whole infrastructure and architecture of restaking protocols is very interesting to monitor and to examine. If you for example, look at Symbiotic, they take a completely different approach than eigenlayer when it comes to building networks. They called it networks instead of AVs and networks taking again a completely different approach.
00:52:06.795 - 00:53:15.859, Speaker D: So in my opinion it's. Eigenlayer takes a certain approach where it's selecting a node operator and then connecting the node operator connects AVS to that. Where in Symbiotic there's. There's a completely different architecture where it's a little bit more defi LEGO block like where there's more responsibility to the LRT for constructing these different products. So I think that it's important from an architectural point of view, how are you going to build different strategies and how are you going to construct and how do you make these product liquids and how do you make them work in defi or how do you make them, how do you make these risks clear? So I do think it's very important to actually analyze the full stack. Not only to look at an operator, not only to look at AVs. We try to look at the full stack of the architecture of different restake protocol and to the different underlying operating AVs in the case of eigenlayer, in this case.
00:53:15.859 - 00:54:13.795, Speaker D: But all the restake protocols all have their different kind of ways of risks that need to be analyzed. And yeah, as I said, I do think that kind of slashing or that kind of, well, distribution of money or free stake money at the moment of a slashing condition or the action is going to be different per protocol. So that's my opinion. So I think that it's very important to select the AVS's to understand what an AVS is doing and then select the node operator or work with white label node operators for example, and then just kind of monitor them and make sure that the whole stack is secure, not only from node operator side. So the illness, we're looking at the full stack of, of risks and opportunities.
00:54:16.455 - 00:54:52.695, Speaker A: Right, thank you very much. I think like you guys are the researchers in the space, of course, and I'm glad to see you, you will be focusing on the full funnel. Now guys, let's jump into the part that the users want to hear. So we saw a lot of point systems, we saw the points meta coming out. I want to ask you and I want to call out all of you. So just reply, open your mic and reply to this question. What are you guys planning to do after the point system? Will there be a second season of points? I saw that etherfi had a second season of points.
00:54:52.695 - 00:54:58.955, Speaker A: What are you guys planning to do to keep attracting the users to your protocol? Who wants to kickstart this one?
00:54:59.375 - 00:55:15.085, Speaker D: I. I can start. I made a. We made a. As I said, I've been a point guard avs. So I think that the first thing which is important to note I think is that point system generally are not that transparent. Maybe some of them are more transparent than others.
00:55:15.085 - 00:56:00.481, Speaker D: We are making our point system just fully deterministic, meaning that you can actually always see and validate all the different points and you can see the whole stack of points. For example, we don't do any like point deals or something. That's something that we're not doing. And we are currently making points as fully deterministic. So a user can actually validate exactly what actions and how does it work. And I think that we should approach this question more from first principles where like why are we distributing points and what are points for? In my opinion, points are for alignment and for distribution of governance. At Yieldnas, we're going to give away more than like 60% to community allocation.
00:56:00.481 - 00:56:35.091, Speaker D: And that means that we want to be a. Yeah, we're striving to be a fully decentralized protocol and giving most of the power away over time to decentralized. To decentralize our protocol over time. And for that we do need to find good communities and actors that we will find by distributing our governance power with. And that's how we're approaching this challenge. It's an ongoing challenge. You can even see that in layer zero or other things that just went live with their airdrop they spent months on removing Sybil attacks and things like that.
00:56:35.091 - 00:57:14.647, Speaker D: And I think point system are pretty cool because you can transparently show to the whole community of who got a certain allocation, how does it work. And I think that is the approach that yield NASA takes is like eventually like full transparency in points where they. What are they used for and how are we distributing and why are we distributing them. And yeah, we have a clear response for that. It's just like we want to decentralize. We want to include our governance power to the right actors in the space and to the right communities in the space. And that's why we're working with for example, the llamas and we're working with other more educated.
00:57:14.647 - 00:57:58.757, Speaker D: We try to get the best educated community and try to make them all interested in the research that we're doing and make them all engaged in what we're building and in that way distributing our governance power over time in the form of points that will be fully transparent and turning into a real cryptographic token over time. And that timeline will be very clearly communicated to our community and they can see exactly what they get by certain actions that they're doing and how they can stay engaged and how they can earn more governance power in the protocols. And I think that that's our again, that's our approach.
00:57:58.941 - 00:58:29.595, Speaker A: So you'll create an AVS for points. That's an interesting one. I'm looking forward to see to see that. And guys, who else is thinking about different structures to reward the users with points or like the tokens? Some of the airdrops, like the major ones that everyone was waiting for, were kind of disappointing. So I think now everyone is looking to the different points systems you guys are building because you are the protocols driving the market at the moment. So yeah, what are you guys doing more? Who wants to step in next?
00:58:32.255 - 00:58:33.359, Speaker B: I can go on?
00:58:33.487 - 00:58:34.919, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead please.
00:58:35.087 - 00:59:34.645, Speaker B: So like I can go on because like currently the point accumulation continues and we haven't launched our token and like we haven't discussed the details like after the tokens, but on the like point accumulation like as yield nest mentioned like the being community oriented. So on Eagle Pie we will distribute 45% of total supply to users who accumulated points and which will be like huge part of the token will be distributed as airdrop and like moving forward like we are currently preparing for the IDO and like after that like the airdrop will start and we will like decide what will we do. And like as I mentioned it's still in under the discussion. And like apart from the retail users like currently on Eagle PI site, we are trying to onboard more like institutional partners to the ecosystem. So these are our main focuses on right now.
00:59:36.025 - 00:59:40.485, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So you said 85% of the supply for the airdrop?
00:59:40.785 - 00:59:41.965, Speaker C: Oh no. 45.
00:59:43.665 - 00:59:53.227, Speaker A: Sorry guys. As a user I was already extrapolating. Okay, Jerome, since you're talking, what is inception doing about points, man?
00:59:53.291 - 01:00:54.083, Speaker C: Absolutely, absolutely. So as we also are ramping up things to do our TGE very soon. So for us, points is also a part of course of community growth and has a big, big part on that. The points will of course turn into the airdrop so we can reward the community with a point so of course people that farm more points will have more access to the airdrops and of course this will all result also in our governance token. So by giving more power to the community, we also make sure that the community can participate on decisions inside the protocol. So for us that is extremely important. And by having the point system is definitely something to ramp up the airdrop, ramp up the tge, and of course to keep the community super, super excited and to keep working very, very closely with the community and also give them something in return for all their support.
01:00:54.083 - 01:00:56.735, Speaker C: So it's extremely important. 100%.
01:00:57.915 - 01:01:27.945, Speaker A: Nice man. Thank you very much. Now any of you wants to close this topic? Okay, let's move on then to the further topic. I do want to touch base on Eigen layer competitors Eigenlayer. We saw Karak, we saw Symbiotic Nectar is also coming out. How are you guys addressing these and what are you planning to do to integrate these new infrastructures into your protocols? Guys?
01:01:28.925 - 01:02:25.485, Speaker D: Yeah, I can go for that. Neil Nas wants to be a fully liquid restaking protocol that wraps around all the restaking protocols that are building real infrastructure and real code. So we do deep analysis on AVSs and node operators and on Eigenlayer and we're also doing deep analysis on all the other restaking protocols. So we have for example in the pipeline a really big research on BTC restaking and how it makes less sense than restaking on Eve, in my opinion. And that's of course a bit of a hot topic, but it might make sense, but new opcodes need to be enabled on Bitcoin to actually make that a real thing, in my opinion. And I will have a more extensive report on that coming down the pipeline. And basically I do think there's a lot of really cool innovations with Symbiotic or Nectar that they are building some real cool stuff.
01:02:25.485 - 01:02:49.659, Speaker D: But it is quite still early to just be completely transparent on that because eigenlayer is working on this for multiple years and a couple of new entrances are just kind of starting. So that's something to be aware of and that we will also really point out the ones that are wearing no other emperors that are wearing no clothes, but we will work with all the ones that have real infrastructure and will bring real yields.
01:02:49.707 - 01:02:49.915, Speaker G: Right?
01:02:49.955 - 01:03:12.213, Speaker D: So we are investigating all these different protocols and we are investigating all their different architectures. And I actually think that potentially it's still the question like what, what, what restaking protocol will have the highest real yield? I think that is, that is a very big question and I Think that's a question that I also don't have a direct answer to. But I, I can say that what.
01:03:12.229 - 01:03:13.385, Speaker A: I wanted to hear.
01:03:13.885 - 01:03:53.911, Speaker D: Yeah, but we, I can say that there is a lot of very interesting protocols that are building in a direction that might front run eigenlayer in terms of like some more pragmatic ways to get real Yield or Real AVs that are coming online and we are, we are actively like vertically integrating with all of them and making products that are kind of like that. You can stake one token and get exposure to kind of all of that, that whole sector. Right. And I'm just most excited about like just having these kind of structured product where you can have the security of an Ethereum network and then can also secure all these other services via different networks.
01:03:53.983 - 01:03:54.215, Speaker A: Right.
01:03:54.255 - 01:04:48.221, Speaker D: So it's like we were exporting the security of the Ethereum network onto different monster networks and we are wrapping around all these restaking protocols kind of with one protocol. Yield nas. Right. So Yield NAS is kind of that entrance for retail that wants to retail or institutions that want to have exposure to, to, to, to ETH and, or, or, or stable coins and restake that. So we're also working on this kind of USD, USDCA or not USDC but like Etina or CRV USD or other like sake frags. We're working on this kind of products with stablecoins or with ETH because I think the funny narrative kind of existed where it was like oh, we're restaking lsds and we're restaking like, like Bitcoin and things like that. But it's, it's, it like restaking pure eve.
01:04:48.221 - 01:05:43.825, Speaker D: So native restaking makes a lot of sense. And then, and all any other form of restaking is just ERC20 tokens or liquidity pools that you can then also use as like backing of your economic security. Right. And that's what we are putting a lot of time into, into kind of making products that are not only like native EVE restaking but we, we have native EV staking but we're also going to offer other tokens for restaking wrapped around different restaking protocols in the, in the back end. So that is what we're working on and I'm very bullish on the whole restaking sector and I think it's, it's moving very fast. There's a lot of code being built, there's a lot of things happening and yeah, we are looking at all of it and we'll integrate with all the ones that we see beneficial for Long term.
01:05:44.125 - 01:05:48.905, Speaker A: So you don't have a clear overview on which one you guys are more Bullish and.
01:05:52.605 - 01:06:00.955, Speaker D: Nectar. Symbiotic and well Eigen layer, Symbiotic and Nectar. I would say those are the three ones that that we're mostly looking into right now. Yeah.
01:06:01.255 - 01:06:16.475, Speaker A: Okay Eigenpay, I do want to hear your opinion also Inception because from what I understood Semiotic is pretty much anchored on steeth from Lido. So what you guys planning with Semiotic? Because I do know that you have st.
01:06:17.775 - 01:07:00.615, Speaker B: So basically like Symbiotic and Karak are likely to attract like attention and adaptation from users who value flexibility, diversification and improved liquidity. So they may encourage competition and innovation in the staking industry. So that like recently we passed like governance voting. So we will be building a new protocol called simpy and like currently it's just past the voting but yeah it will be built by Magpie ecosystem simply and we will try to get as much attention as we get from ecompy set as well. So we are so bullish on the site as well.
01:07:01.395 - 01:07:05.843, Speaker A: I was expecting that answer from you guys. Inception. Jo, what's your take on this?
01:07:05.979 - 01:08:00.633, Speaker C: Yeah, so for us our take is that the way that Symbiotic is building is actually very, very interesting. I do think that can be a very good extra offer a part of Eigen. So I agree with Yieldnet Yield Nest saying that first comes Eigen, then symbiotic, then nectar. I will say that Karak the way that Karak is building is a bit strange in my opinion because they allow to restake restaked assets and by doing that you are literally like adding leverage on top of leverage on top of infinite leverage. And I don't know if that is good for the space. Let's So I do know that some of some of the LRTs are doing partnerships with Karak. I don't think that Inception will do that because we don't believe that it's a good model specifically.
01:08:00.633 - 01:08:26.615, Speaker C: But very curious to see because again everything is new so anything can change any moment. We are going so fast and everything is so interesting outside that things can change from one day to the other. But yeah, let's say that restaking assets on top of restaked assets. I don't know if it's. It's a good one. But yeah, definitely bullish on Symbiotic Nectar and of course Eigen 100% I guess.
01:08:26.655 - 01:08:35.635, Speaker A: I can is your go to platform for all of you svel. I do want to hear you guys because I Know you also have scs, right?
01:08:37.815 - 01:09:25.821, Speaker G: Yeah, correct. So I think Swell is like in a unique position there where we have our liquid staking token. Right. Which is also accepted into Symbotic, you know, even though like, in terms of the share that each LST has, I guess it's around the middle, but, you know, not as much as Steve. But I think how. How we're looking at it is of course Symbotic came after eigenlayer and you know, eigenlayer had the first mover advantage, but Symbotic had the opportunity to learn from the mistakes eigenlayer has made from a design perspective. And I think, I guess everyone here can agree that maybe parts of the symbiotic design is better and it is more conducive to, as we mentioned, like the operators and like Rock mentioned earlier, rotating all of the validators.
01:09:25.821 - 01:10:10.511, Speaker G: It's. It would cost a lot in eigenlayer, but, you know, the design is different in Symbiotic. So I think Symbiotic has that going for it and they obviously are strategically aligned with Lido. So yeah, I don't think we should write them off. They're obviously a great team and I think how swell is looking at it is we will be launching a swell lot on Symbiotic. We've started teasing that this week, so you guys should probably see that in the near future. And in terms of all the other restaking protocols, you know, it's an open market, right? So everyone is now part of the industry and I think each one will have their space.
01:10:10.511 - 01:10:26.463, Speaker G: I don't think it's like one just wins the entire market. It's never really like that. So yes, we'll see maybe a longer tail of smaller restaking platforms, but I think each will find their space and find their niche.
01:10:26.559 - 01:10:35.019, Speaker A: I guess I need to put this for the Alpha you just dropped. Thank you very much. Man, that was a good Alpha.
01:10:35.067 - 01:10:36.535, Speaker C: What the hell was that?
01:10:37.875 - 01:11:05.489, Speaker A: Sorry guys, I was just finding out the buttons that we have here on space. But that's a pretty cool Alpha, man. Thank you very much for giving it here. Now jumping into the last topic and guys, this is more an exploratory way because I know that some of you already announced that we are starting to do. I think it was even resu the only protocol that didn't accept come to this space that introduced this. But I want to hear. So there are some rumors out there in the market.
01:11:05.489 - 01:11:25.245, Speaker A: I saw what Babylon is doing. Who is exploring BTC risk taking. We will have lrts of BTC Are you guys developing anything in this field? Can you shed some light in here or not? Well, I saw a couple mics unmuting. Who wants to go first?
01:11:26.375 - 01:11:27.835, Speaker C: I can go first.
01:11:28.655 - 01:11:29.103, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:11:29.159 - 01:11:30.595, Speaker C: Can you hear me now or.
01:11:31.415 - 01:11:32.127, Speaker A: Okay.
01:11:32.271 - 01:12:07.835, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. So we do think that's definitely the next frontier for LRPs. Like there is about like 1 trillion, more than $1 trillion of BTC that is not being used right now. And we think that, well, why not using those BTC to earn extra yields on top of platforms like Babylon and even Aigan? Because already heard that Eigen can or will maybe start doing BTC restaking too. So I don't know if that is a rumor or not, but. Let's see.
01:12:07.835 - 01:12:43.125, Speaker C: But definitely this is something that we are really exploring hardcore at this moment. We believe that that is the next frontier for lrts. And we plan to release way to do restaking of BTC first with wrapped btc, then native btc. But we plan to do that very, very soon. And we believe that that's the next stage for any LRT protocol. So we definitely are looking at that to bring that to users in the next few months. 100%.
01:12:43.795 - 01:12:48.275, Speaker A: So you will release BTC risk taking. That's for what I understood, right?
01:12:48.435 - 01:12:49.595, Speaker C: Yes, yes.
01:12:49.755 - 01:13:02.695, Speaker A: And I have this button here. Sorry if it's too loud but I need to click it. I had to try it out. I had to try it again. I saw you also unmuted yourselves. I can test more buttons so give me more alpha. So I test more buttons.
01:13:05.675 - 01:13:52.235, Speaker B: So. Okay, let me move on on message. So like as we know like LRT space is like blooming and on the eth side and it's really cool to see how all of these protocols are leveraging and creating a new ways to people to generate yield. So like the bitcoin restaking is a new trend and can bring similar benefits to the overall defi community. And so to to get benefit and to help people on that side like on eigenpy side, not eigenpysa sorry on magpie ecosystem. So we recently proposed a new subdavo call will be called Babypi. We'll be focusing on the like Bitcoin restaking.
01:13:52.235 - 01:14:03.765, Speaker B: It's still under the vote but most likely it will pass since it's like received 99%. Yes. So yes, we will be building a new subdo as well on that side.
01:14:03.925 - 01:14:18.185, Speaker A: Damn, that's a good offer. Let me test another button. Sorry man. Thank you very much. Anyone wants to step in on this one as well? Amid Gillian, do you want to step in, of course. Amando, you have been so active.
01:14:19.925 - 01:14:20.373, Speaker G: Yeah.
01:14:20.429 - 01:14:42.685, Speaker E: So in terms of BTC restaking, we did evaluate that ecosystem, but yet to make a decision on that one. It's definitely interesting with a lot of TVL out there and a lot of potentially opportunities for btc, but we are yet to. Yet to make a decision on the one.
01:14:43.025 - 01:14:49.005, Speaker A: All right. All right. So I guess we will just have to wait for future developments. Amanda, do you have any take from your end?
01:14:49.385 - 01:15:02.205, Speaker D: Yeah. So we're bringing out this kind of deep dive into risk taking protocols. Right. Soon. And BTC restaking is part of that. We're definitely examining it right now. I would say I was.
01:15:02.205 - 01:15:39.937, Speaker D: I stand with my, my opinion that new opcodes need to be enabled for that to make sense on Bitcoin at the moment. But that's my, my personal view. I know it's a bit of a party poop review, but I think Resign right now makes more midsize, makes more sense in terms of settlement assurances and how that works technically. Right. But I do think it's definitely possible and it's a huge market that we will definitely also explore. But we will see how Babylon and things play out. As you can see in Eigen layer and in Symbiotic and Nectar and all these protocols, there's a lot of work to do still.
01:15:39.937 - 01:16:08.785, Speaker D: And I think on BTC restaking there's definitely also a lot of ongoing work. So we're actively monitoring it right now, but we keep our focus on ETH, ERC, 20 tokens, LP tokens and stablecoins. That's our main focus for now, but doesn't mean that we're going to not do that in the future. I just want to see that, how that plays out a little bit, how the real AVSs and real protocols will be built on that kind of stack.
01:16:09.205 - 01:16:29.245, Speaker A: Nice, nice. So we have a future outlook of possible integration. I like to hear that. I'm really looking forward to see that BTC liquidity being tapped and used in defi. There are so many L2s in Bitcoin right now. I do think that the system like this would help along. Killian, I don't know if you want to step in with any, with any comment from your guys end.
01:16:31.185 - 01:17:54.099, Speaker G: Yeah, I guess, you know, everyone, everyone is looking into it. Of course. I think like a good way for maybe the listeners to think about it is, you know, ask yourself like, how real will the yield be that Babylon is sort of promising, right? I guess their strategy in general is the Cosmos ecosystem and Some could argue that that's good and that's more sustainable. But others could argue that why would a Cosmos chain trade 30, 40% of their security when for a large portion of cosmos chains, that's their only utility staking their token? If you look at the staking ratios for most cosmos chains, it's it's actually upwards of 60, 70%. Right? So if you unlock 30 or 40% of that supply, what does that do to the actual price of that token into those communities? So, you know, those are important questions I think to think about when, you know, we talk about BTC restaking in terms of. In terms of Babylon and that I think they are doing a great job and it's in no way like a way to undermine them. But I think that's the first question we would ask is okay, how sustainable is the yield that's coming from this restaking platform, whether it's Babylon or whoever else, and then use first principle thinking and look at it from there.
01:17:54.099 - 01:17:56.227, Speaker G: So I guess that's what I would add there.
01:17:56.291 - 01:18:21.803, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So guys, I think there are pretty good overviews already here. We are coming to an end of this space. Thank you to everyone on the audience. This was for sure, I think for a large margin the largest space that's staking circle has ever hosted. However, I do want to remind everyone on the top of this space I've pinned it now. We do also host in real life events.
01:18:21.803 - 01:18:48.769, Speaker A: We will have two events in Brussels now on EthCC. So we have the LRT summit on the 7th. That will be between 5pm and 10pm and then we have the BTC 7 on the 8th of July between 6pm and 9pm or and 10pm Sorry for the hours here guys. So yeah, I totally invite anyone audience to subscribe. You can go to the top of the space. Click directly. You have the Luma links.
01:18:48.769 - 01:19:15.691, Speaker A: We are already pretty packed for the events, but we believe we'll have room for everyone. We have just extended the venue to make sure everyone is comfy. Some of these guests will be also there. So you want. If you want to know more about LRTS and the future, the future steps of lrts, come to our LRT Summit. If you want to know more about BTC restaking, BTC L2s come to our BTC summit event on the 8th of July. Guys, I appreciate it.
01:19:15.691 - 01:19:24.095, Speaker A: I totally appreciate you for coming. Now I'll leave you some space for final remarks. Who wants to kickstart the final remarks of the space?
01:19:25.965 - 01:20:24.765, Speaker D: I can go first if you guys want like. So, yeah, we have a very exciting live stream coming up tomorrow with Bybit tomorrow. I believe it's tomorrow afternoon European time and there's a huge announcement dropping, I think tonight about a merger that's going to happen. I cannot mention exactly what that is, but just follow the Yield Next, Just follow the yieldnast Twitter account, stay up to date and yeah, we are, we are, we are building, yeah, technology first, research first and we are also always looking for really cool new people to join our team and to join our community. So follow, follow yieldnast, Go to yieldnas Finance and follow us on Twitter, Discord website. Go to app like everything is on the Internet. So we're very excited about our announcement soon and the Bybit live stream that's coming tomorrow.
01:20:25.625 - 01:20:33.605, Speaker A: Okay guys, so stay tuned to Yield next because there will be some alpha dropping. Who wants to do the final remarks next? Thank you very much Amanda for coming.
01:20:34.985 - 01:20:37.605, Speaker D: Thank you guys and hope to see everybody in Brussels.
01:20:39.225 - 01:20:42.805, Speaker A: Stay tuned and go to our events. I think you are one of our sponsors, right?
01:20:43.235 - 01:20:43.915, Speaker D: Yes, sir.
01:20:43.995 - 01:20:44.459, Speaker B: Yes, sir.
01:20:44.507 - 01:20:49.403, Speaker A: Yeah, so I will see you there, man. Will be a pleasure to connect in real life. Amit. Yeah, go ahead, man.
01:20:49.459 - 01:21:01.615, Speaker E: Thank you. No, I just want to say thank you everyone. Thanks to all the listeners for tuning in today and thanks taking circle for hosting us today. Looking forward to seeing some of you in Brussels.
01:21:01.955 - 01:21:10.055, Speaker A: Thank you very much, mate. We will also see you in the LRT summit I think. Eigenfy, do you want to do the closing remarks from your end?
01:21:10.895 - 01:21:27.983, Speaker B: Yes, sure. Thank you guys for having us and giving opportunity to introduce Eigenpy and overall Magpie ecosystem. So there are a lot of things happening on the MEG by ecosystem and new subdoubs are being logged. So be sure that you're following our social channels to get updates with us and thank you guys again.
01:21:28.159 - 01:21:33.595, Speaker A: Thank you man. My pleasure. Now Kylian, do you want to close the remarks from your end?
01:21:35.465 - 01:21:48.525, Speaker G: Yeah. Thanks everyone. It's been a pleasure to be here. Yeah, keen for. Keen to see you all in ECC and for all the users. Thanks for all the contributions I guess to everyone's protocol here.
01:21:49.545 - 01:21:56.009, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you very much, man. Now I do have some questions if I will be able to hear you. Jo, are you still there or not? Can you hear me?
01:21:56.017 - 01:21:57.565, Speaker C: Yes sir. Yes sir, I'm here.
01:21:58.185 - 01:22:01.087, Speaker A: You dropped. I was concerned to put you on.
01:22:01.241 - 01:22:49.215, Speaker C: No, no, no, I'm here, I'm here. Yes, so final remarks. So we also going to be in Brussels, so very excited to meet everyone there and I Will say the alpha drop is really that we are very close to tge, so it's the perfect time for you to farm, farm, farm, farm, farm this point, farm the airdrop because TGE was going to be soon. So yeah, like that's the big alpha. You can put the alpha, the big alpha. And yeah, and I think that everyone is excited to Brussels now to etc and very excited to continue to build. Very excited for the BTC restaking solution coming next and of course to get all these big yields on $1 trillion of BTC.
01:22:49.215 - 01:22:52.295, Speaker C: So that's it. Thank you.
01:22:52.715 - 01:22:59.875, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Rob, you had some issues with Twitter. Can we hear you now? Yep.
01:22:59.915 - 01:23:03.895, Speaker F: Hey, I'm back. I appreciate you guys having us on here.
01:23:04.315 - 01:23:24.183, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Rob. It was a pleasure hosting you all guys. So, guys, final remarks from Staking Circle side. As you all know, we have a live giveaway for this space and I do want to test the button of the money. I wanted to hear that sound. So you were here. You already did the hardest step, which was to be here on the space with us.
01:23:24.183 - 01:24:02.431, Speaker A: The next step you have to do is follow staking circle. You can follow sticking circle and also follow these amazing guests because all of them are developing amazing things. Look at risk taking or risk taking only as you prefer it. It's one of the most exciting industries right now in crypto. Follow everyone on the panel because there's a lot of alpha coming out and yeah, guys, I guess we meet each other, everyone and everybody, everyone in the audience. We meet each other on the LRT Summer and BTC Summit events by staking Circle on ECC. Do recall 7th of July and 8th of July, go to Luma and register.
01:24:02.431 - 01:24:20.781, Speaker A: We are already overbooked. We managed to extend the venue so we can encompass everyone. I want to see you all there. I want to have discussions with you all there. I'll be at the entry welcoming you all there. So thank you very much for coming, guys and see you on the next taking circle space next week. Cheers.
