00:00:06.010 - 00:00:17.440, Speaker A: So here with Greg Marling of Idexo. So, Greg, why don't you start off with a few slides for people to understand what that exo is, and then we'll go deeper on that.
00:00:18.210 - 00:01:19.300, Speaker B: So yeah, quickly, Idexo, we are API for NFTs and NFT marketplaces, also a lot of other methods, but this is where we're getting a lot of attention. So if you look at, we talked a bit about in our panel that there's the opportunity to really disrupt everything in the $88 trillion world economy, and talked about the idea that a lot of the people who are going to build the applications that really create great disruption are coming from those industries. They're not necessarily blockchain people. And one of the problems is when you ask someone to do that, currently, we ask them to do a lot of things that don't have a lot to do with the application itself. So learn a lot about blockchain, learn how to code it. And we talked about it, you mentioned it early. This was a real blocker on some people trying to do innovation before, is that they would spend a lot of time repeating work that had been already been done.
00:01:19.300 - 00:02:31.260, Speaker B: What we do, and of course, you have to do that across different blockchains, and different blockchains, have individual features that can be very interesting. And so we try to really unlock those features, make them very easy to use. Really looking at things like how can we boil down to one line of code that you can, without knowing anything about all the complexity behind the scenes web, three js and individual sdks of individual blockchains that you can just go at exactly what you're trying to do, whether it be deploying an NFT minter and simultaneously minting the first edition, or doing different kinds of tokenomics, et cetera. And so what we're doing is we're wrapping those sdks into one. So you'd only have to learn one SDK. And then we are also wrapping the economic complexity of managing different wallets and different currencies that can fluctuate and having an infrastructure for doing those transactions and presenting that as like one compute credit, reliable sort of purchasing power, and then someone can go and build a business model out of that. So that's essentially what we do.
00:02:31.260 - 00:02:57.298, Speaker B: And we've only been at this a pretty short time. We've gotten some really good feedback. I've been doing startups and products for a long time, and I don't know that I've ever had this kind of feedback where I talk to people and say, this is absolutely needed. People really need this stuff. Can't believe people haven't done this before kind of thing. And then the people who are using it, not talking about, hey, I like your project, it's kind of cool. They're saying, I love what you're doing.
00:02:57.298 - 00:03:18.090, Speaker B: I really want to be a part of it. So that's really good in terms of who we are. Both me and my co founder, we're devs. So we've read a lot of code. We come at it from different perspectives. I've also worn a lot of hats over my career, been the CEO or in the business guy or sales, marketing. So I bring a lot of sort of perspectives.
00:03:18.090 - 00:03:36.820, Speaker B: Right now, we're looking to hire our next sort of early leaders. So if you are someone listening here and any of those roles on the slide speak to you or you just like what we're doing, definitely reach out to us on careersidexo IO and.
00:03:38.870 - 00:03:39.138, Speaker A: A.
00:03:39.144 - 00:03:54.280, Speaker B: Good way to reach us if you have questions. We do a lot through telegram, so go join our telegram. I'm on it all the time. We have community managers, as you know, ask any questions you have and of know, check us out on Twitter as well if you prefer that.
00:03:57.370 - 00:04:13.306, Speaker A: Great, thanks. So which change protocols systems is Alexa currently integrating with and which are first on the near term roadmap?
00:04:13.498 - 00:04:39.730, Speaker B: Yeah, so far we have rweave, which is really cool. I always like rweave because know pay once and store forever, which is obviously really applicable to NFTs. We do ethereum because that's kind of expected. We do binance smart chain. We have a lot of interest right now, actually in binance smart chain. And coming shortly is matic. So polygon.
00:04:39.730 - 00:05:26.610, Speaker B: Sorry, it's hard to get away from that. And I think avalanche shortly thereafter. So there's a couple that are in the pipeline, really, we are going to be looking at all times for. Is there an interesting feature that a blockchain has come out with? We talked on the panel about really application specific or state data specific, that kind of thing, chains. And so if we see one pop up, we're definitely going to try and integrate it if it provides some valuable feature to an application developer. But there's so many that we have on the roadmap and so that's part of, like we listed there's a job on our careers page for a lead integration developer. I would love that job.
00:05:26.610 - 00:05:42.150, Speaker B: That's just going to be such a fun job for someone to do. So we're definitely going to dedicate a lot of resources to constantly integrating new chains as well as of course going deeper on existing integrations based on customer demand.
00:05:43.470 - 00:05:54.266, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. So you mentioned you built an NPM module very early on in the process, right? And iterating on that to extend its capabilities.
00:05:54.458 - 00:06:34.090, Speaker B: Yeah. Basically the way that someone uses our tool is they download idexostk. So hyphen, but I'll paste it in chat. So you would download that. That connects to our API. So behind our API is this engine that does all the things that you're actually doing in anything we try and we can get it simpler even than we are today. So we start with, let's have one line of code and then I even look at that one line of code and like I could make that even a little easier.
00:06:34.090 - 00:07:13.654, Speaker B: But yeah, that's how they transact. And then what's coming is I think we're going to come out with a react specific library. So yes, you can install NPM obviously in react, but I think there's some usefulness to having a react specific library. We're going to have drop in interfaces. So stripe did this right pretty well. They made it really easy to integrate payment processing into your SaaS app. And we're going to try and do something similar, just really make it easy to drop blockchain features into your application.
00:07:13.654 - 00:07:24.410, Speaker B: And some of that might be to have sort of drop in even styled components that connect to that API. I don't know. Is that a good answer to your question?
00:07:24.560 - 00:08:08.460, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. You're going to where developers already are, like you're already using node. Everybody's using node, right? Everybody's using react. I don't want to spend a week learning something, but I do want to store my data and keep it there forever. Maybe you can close your screen share. Okay. And with those kind of easy, good building blocks in the paradigm technologies that people already use, that should provide really good ways for people to start with this, but also augment their existing applications with some capability or some capabilities and go from there.
00:08:08.460 - 00:08:28.480, Speaker A: And you mentioned nfts previously. I think you did a tweet a while back like, hey, create an NFT in one line of code. Could you say a bit more about what you've done there and the directions that it got and what's in store on that front?
00:08:29.010 - 00:08:52.390, Speaker B: Yeah. So we're going to be announcing something pretty cool next week on Telegram. So join Telegram. Yeah, nfps are really interesting, right? They're taking off for good reason. Right. They solve a lot of really interesting use cases. But yeah, we launched that.
00:08:52.390 - 00:09:22.634, Speaker B: We kind of intuitively launched that it got a lot of buz. And then once you dive into the world of nfts, right, there's just a lot of different flavors to it. So there's a lot of different things you can do with a 721 contract. There's different things you can do with 1155. How you buy and sell and transfer nfts is very interesting. Across chains is one aspect. And the neat thing is there's a lot of innovation in the space.
00:09:22.634 - 00:10:13.150, Speaker B: So I'll look at something that's been popular with how they structure, for instance, additions, different pricing, sort of bonded curve models, capping them at certain levels. So there's a lot of innovation around that that goes into the smart contract itself. So we want to expose some of that innovation in really simple ways. So I think that's one of the areas. And then, of course, on the marketplaces themselves, we want to make it really easy for anyone to launch their own marketplace. And I think there's going to be some interesting applications to that that are very different from what you see right now. So integrating that within a community, a community forum, for instance, you got forum software, you've got a website, and you have a specific take on it.
00:10:13.150 - 00:10:35.720, Speaker B: So I know that the marketplaces have their own way of the existing big ones have their way of making it easy to build your marketplace on their site sort of thing. But I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to build their own version for a very specific audience that they've got already. And so we're just going to make it really easy for them to do that.
00:10:37.390 - 00:10:54.430, Speaker A: Great. All right, we're looking to wrap up. We have 1 minute left. So you mentioned telegram, you mentioned you're hiring for people, but where can people find you and what do you want? How can people help you? How can people interact?
00:10:54.930 - 00:11:31.480, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that's a really good point. Join the community. Telegram is the main one, right. And just spread the good word. If you're someone who wants to use it, try it out. There's a lot of features of our application that are free to use, so go have fun and give us feedback on those. And if you want to integrate this in your application or you see seven tenths of what you need from us, please reach out and we'll fill that and work with you.
00:11:32.250 - 00:11:34.210, Speaker A: Awesome, thanks. Cool. Thanks, Rick.
