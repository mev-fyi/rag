00:00:14.330 - 00:01:12.980, Speaker A: Hi everyone, I'm Mattis Stace, token design lead at Outlier Ventures, and this is the second episode of the new outlier venture series where we're going to cover a range of topics related to token design, such as token economics, mechanism design and token engineering. Our goal is to help our audiences understand the core principles of token design and we are going to do that by discussing projects that are well established in the space outfly eventures or I may hold tokens mentioned on this show, but nothing said here constitutes financial advice. So please do your own research before making any investment decisions. And now is the time to welcome ZX Jang, who is in charge of token economics research at Protocol Labs, which is an open source research, development and deployment lab where projects whose projects include the likes of IPFs and Filecoin. And we are going to use the next 30 minutes or so to talk about Filecoin's unique token design. Welcome ZX, it's great to have you.
00:01:14.310 - 00:01:16.260, Speaker B: Thank you, Matthew. It's great to be here.
00:01:16.950 - 00:01:23.560, Speaker A: So to kick things off, can you please give us a quick elevator pitch on Filecoin and your role in its token design?
00:01:23.930 - 00:01:51.066, Speaker B: Definitely. Hi everyone, my name is ZX and I work on token economics at Filecoin and protocol apps. Just a quick disclaimer here. Today I'm coming on the show as a member of both the Filecoin and the token engineering communities to tell you more about the work that we have done. All my views are my personal views. They are not representing any of the organization or communities that we associated with. So great, let's talk about Filecoin.
00:01:51.066 - 00:02:35.786, Speaker B: With the launch of Filecoin, I think cryptocurrency mining really enters into a new era and that represents opportunity for blockchain to go mainstream and really deliver value for businesses. It's a pretty unique blockchain based on proof of use for work. And it's also like a platform economy of providers, which are miners producing storage related goods and services and clients consuming this service. Sometimes people may I think I use the Airbnb model to think about this. Like there could be many different providers on this platform that is powered by pretty innovative cryptographic proof and blockchain technologies and crypto economic incentives. And the network currently is growing at about one petabyte of capacity every hour and is sitting at more than 2.8 exabyte of storage.
00:02:35.786 - 00:03:22.720, Speaker B: And many organizations and developers are entering the ecosystem to build businesses around Falcon ecosystem and from a system engineering standpoint, I think Falcon is less opinionated about how storage is produced and consumed to allow for maximal emergence. So I would argue that it's well positioned for both web two interaction and web3 use cases. Web two interactions meaning like somebody has a file and need to find someone to store them, and that's taken care of. The whole flow is supported by the protocol. And for the web3 interactions, in my mind, file can introduce this really unique building block into the web3 ecosystem where you have storage being proven at regular frequency, and then there could be lots of interesting use cases and businesses that can be built on top of.
00:03:27.010 - 00:03:57.510, Speaker A: Thank you. Really interesting. All right, let's jump into the actual token design. In my experience, it's always helpful if you want to understand the token design of a project to start by understanding the different types of stakeholders in the network. So can you please tell us something about each stakeholder group that's active in the Filecode network?
00:03:58.350 - 00:04:39.670, Speaker B: Absolutely. I totally agree. A very big part of token design is to understand the stakeholders stakeholder groups. And from token design we go to economic governance. At some point, governance becomes sometimes this interest of different stakeholder groups might cross and how do we make a recommended decision for the community? And sometimes we need to balance both short term, medium term and long term interests for everybody and also align everyone with the goal of the network. So within Filecoin, there are five main stakeholder groups, the first one being the storage clients, where they want to make use of the storage on the network. And I think everybody else in some way is serving the storage client stakeholder group.
00:04:39.670 - 00:05:34.098, Speaker B: How do we make storage on Filecoin more attractive and useful and also in the early phases of the network because it's a community. Clients also have a pretty big say in shaping the product offerings on the platform. The second big stakeholder group obviously are our miners. So miners are both producers of the service on Filecoin, but also maintainer of the blockchain consensus. So they play a really critical role in the filecoin ecosystem. And miners basically amass the resources and also other research and development and produce these goods and export that to the outside world, which is mostly our clients for the network. And the other big stakeholder group is developers and researchers, where they actually design and build algorithms and then they build services and software on top of the raw storage that the platform provides.
00:05:34.098 - 00:06:11.214, Speaker B: And this group collaborates pretty closely with both miners and clients to deliver that experience on filecoin. And in addition, we have two more. The other one is ecosystem partners. These are the groups which play a pretty major role in the ecosystem, in seeding new companies, supporting new entrants into the ecosystem and doing education to the market. We have pretty stellar ecosystem partner within the filecoin ecosystem. And lastly, which is a role that many of these share, which we call token holders. For anyone who owns a filecoin token, you are part of the ecosystem, you are part of the economy.
00:06:11.214 - 00:06:21.190, Speaker B: As the token holder. And all these other roles may overlap, token holders may provide lending and financing to facilitate both production and consumption of the services on Filecoin.
00:06:22.890 - 00:06:55.150, Speaker A: Makes sense, makes sense. So you briefly touched on the Filecoin network goals. The file token is really used to kind of align the file coin network goals with the individual incentives of the different stakeholder groups. Can you briefly describe high level the filecoin network goals?
00:06:55.490 - 00:07:37.018, Speaker B: Absolutely. We also spend lots of time iterating this and everyone in the community feel free, everybody's welcome to actually provide more input and direction of how the ecosystem should grow into. But on a high level, I think in terms of what the network wants to incentivize, I think there are two key pillars to storage. One is reliability, the other one is usefulness. So the network wants to incentivize reliable and useful storage, and then we design the minimal set of mechanism and rules to enable maximal emergence. Like filecoins start from storage, but it doesn't end there. Storage is very close to data, compute and value, which is up to the community to emerge.
00:07:37.018 - 00:07:43.570, Speaker B: But on a protocol level, we care about the most fundamental building blocks, which is reliable and useful storage.
00:07:45.830 - 00:08:03.202, Speaker A: So reliability and usefulness. Can you please talk about the different mechanisms the token is using to align incentives of the stakeholders to achieve these goals of reliability and usefulness?
00:08:03.346 - 00:08:42.066, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. And to do that, I think I may have to go down to some of this detail, try to keep it a bit more high level, but feel free to ask me to jump into any of this. And there are many, many mechanisms within the Falcon ecosystem, within the Falcon protocol to actually align individual participants incentive with the goals of the network. So let's start from minting. Minting is always like a pretty dominant driver in any token economic systems, and the goal of the minting is pretty much to align the minor minting curve with the network utility. And we have a pretty interesting innovation here that we call baseline minting. But let me give you some background of how we came to that in the first place.
00:08:42.066 - 00:09:23.070, Speaker B: So in most traditional blockchain we follow some kind of an exponential decay of some flavor of minting. So this is pretty good in incentivizing early adoption, but you also have some certain issue because it's mostly time based. In the case of bitcoin, right, like you just mint, follow a fixed prefixed time schedule, irrespective of the agent behavior in the network. And we noticed that there might be a few problems here. The most dominant ones include potentially, you mean the most. When the network is the least mature, the utility is the lowest, the speculative value is the highest, and the network is the most vulnerable. At this stage, there's a very fast inflation, fast increase in token supply.
00:09:23.070 - 00:10:27.702, Speaker B: So we pretty creatively designed this idea of a KPI of how do we approximate the utility of the network. And one big part of that is the size of the network, how much storage is being committed to network, and it's being proven. And so we defined this idea called a baseline, where the network is only minting at the maximum speed. If the network collectively hits some kind of baseline, and then we basically parata that when the network is not growing at that speed, but that gives an alignment from the participants to basically grow the network super quickly and follow certain kind of API. And the network will only mint token sort of proportional to how much utility is being brought onto the network. Of course, if we only do that, that carries its own problem too, which I will not go into. On top of that, we created this hybrid minting model where you have both baseline, where it's KPI driven, and you also have this simple minting, which is time based.
00:10:27.702 - 00:11:21.826, Speaker B: This provides the necessary antifragility to the system and create this early mover advantage, incentivize early adoption. So that is token minting. And we also have token vesting, where we align stakeholders with the long term interest of the network. This is everywhere, which, from the staff investor to the minor block reward, most block reward, we have to go through a six month linear vesting to make sure that all participants are aligned with the network. The next one is how do we align participants with reliable storage, which we use this combination of mechanism called collateral and slashing. So because of proof of useful work, we need collateral for two things. As mentioned earlier, miners participate both by being a provider of services on the platform, but also securing the consensus of the blockchain.
00:11:21.826 - 00:12:03.614, Speaker B: So that's why you need collateral. For both these reasons. One is to secure the consensus, because dominating purely resource driven network is not that difficult. So you need some kind of stake to secure consensus, but you also need some kind of stake to secure the reliability of the storage services that's being provided. And then you couple that with flashing. When the storage become unreliable, there will be penalty. So the guarantee on reliability is sort of like an economic argument, and there are lots of intricacy here about how do you set this number, which we can go into in a bit as an example, but this combination of collateral and slashing.
00:12:03.614 - 00:12:33.550, Speaker B: And also, remember earlier I said all the blur reward has to go through some vesting because blow reward is only minted conditioned on reliable and useful storage. Right. If the storage is not reliable, sorry, the protocol say I shouldn't have minted you this block reward. I take back my cash advance and some of the vesting block reward will be slashed. And it's pretty heavy. But we're also evolving this and doing analysis on the network and understand what is the right threshold. I have two more mechanisms to share.
00:12:33.550 - 00:13:36.660, Speaker B: The other one is filecoin plus. So we mentioned we want a reliable and useful story. This big part is how do we lend some lever into incentivizing usefulness? And a pretty tricky thing here that we have to deal with is on the protocol level, it's very difficult to distinguish between programmatically distinguish useful data and randomness. So we innovatively added this layer of social trust on top of the resource driven network. So we basically put token production power in the hands of the client through this falcon plus program, where when a client become a falcon plus client, miners storing this client's data will gain like a ten x in their storage power, which leads to like ten x in a share of the block reward that they earn. And lastly, we also have network transaction fee, where we align the token supply with the network usage. This is adapting from Ethereum's EIP 1559, and then we can go more into that as well.
00:13:37.990 - 00:14:09.146, Speaker A: Awesome. Good stuff. So let's zoom in on one of the mechanisms that you mentioned. Based on my understanding of the new tokens that are minted, 30% is subject to baseline minting. So it always stays the same essentially. And 70% is subject to this kind of elastic, what do you call it?
00:14:09.168 - 00:14:13.318, Speaker B: Sorry, baseline is the elastic one. Simple is the.
00:14:13.504 - 00:14:25.398, Speaker A: Yeah, so simple minting is 30% and baseline minting is 70%. I was wondering, what was the process of coming up with these exact parameters for these mechanisms?
00:14:25.594 - 00:15:21.518, Speaker B: Got it. This is a great question, and a lot of our work went into setting these numbers. But when we talk about crypto ecom, people sometimes tend to say, oh, we just be setting some number, but should be to be told. Most of the work is done in structuring the structures to know what number to set, understanding what are the leverage point, understanding your objective, and then how do we have numerical methods and simulation and so on as tools to help us set those numbers. But setting number is like a combination of all these other steps that need to happen first. And when we set numbers, when we set these parameters, we need to have a pretty good understanding of what the dynamic of the system looks like. Because most crypto projects are complex economies, we can just zoom in on one set of parameters or mechanism and not taking into account of the interaction between these mechanisms.
00:15:21.518 - 00:16:49.280, Speaker B: So how we do that is we first have this digital twin of the economy, where we basically model all the different dynamics, and then we basically understand, when we design this structure, we understand there's a lever here, there's like a parameterized option of like, okay, it can be 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, all the way up. And then we also ask ourselves, what are the objectives and what are the goals? What are the shortcomings and strength of each of this? And then we basically run numerical simulation and understand, okay, so given different combination, both just this particular parameters, but also the rest, how would this play out, and how would this satisfy? How would that meet certain objectives? And let me give you some example of just some consideration for this 30 70 split. One big part of that. Of course, there's some amount of incentivizing early adoption, but we also want to make sure that it's fair, that it's sustainable. Some of that is minted based on this KPI of how much utility that participants are bringing onto the network. There's also the other piece, which is very interesting for blockchain, which is like this whole idea of an antifragility and robustness is that that's where this kind of simple schedule can provide. It's like when people drop or there's some kind of unexpected consequences event happen on the network, some people might have to leave.
00:16:49.280 - 00:17:09.080, Speaker B: Do the remaining participant have a stronger incentive to increase their participation in the economy? That's like a pretty big piece. We basically want the network to be enterprise job to come back stronger after certain shock events. And these are different considerations that we're taking into account when proposing that number makes sense.
00:17:10.410 - 00:17:19.900, Speaker A: I was wondering, are there any new mechanisms on top of everything that you mentioned that you're considering for the future?
00:17:20.430 - 00:18:08.950, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. There are always things that we're considering for the future. And I think for all of these economic networks and token economic systems, for every one of these, they are all living an evolutionary system, they're evolving all the time, and it's really up to the community to step up and actually share about their thoughts and opinions of how things should evolve. I think a very big part that we previously described in Falcon is retrieval. So the whole retrieval, market, retrieval, mining, and a different incentive structure on top of that, that's something that we're working on and we're also looking for people to collaborate on together. So if anybody is interested out there, feel free to reach out. And on top of that, I'm personally interested in thinking about all the different new business models that could be enabled with filecoin and other web3 ecosystem.
00:18:08.950 - 00:18:11.980, Speaker B: So happy to chat more with interested folks as well.
00:18:13.390 - 00:18:27.360, Speaker A: So what were the main challenges when you were kind of in the process of designing the file token? And what lessons would you say you learned in that process?
00:18:28.130 - 00:19:19.418, Speaker B: Oh, plenty of lessons to learn, happy to share, maybe just like a snippet in the interest of time. So I think in general, for most token design processes, it goes through this four stage process that I would call it. We start from the design phase, it goes to the validation phase, and then from validation you go to deployment phase, and then after deployment our job is not done yet. There is the whole governance phase, which is a continuous process, and there are challenges in every step of the way. I can give you guys some flavor of what these challenges might be in the design phase. One big part is most people think of token system on the narrative level, on the business narrative. But how can we concretize that into requirement and specification and actually mapping out how this state would evolve and change that in and of itself is a challenge.
00:19:19.418 - 00:20:01.478, Speaker B: And many projects spend lots of time iterating that. And trust me, that is a time well spent and it's a worthy investment of our time. And then once you have some design, the next natural question to ask is, how do I know my design is good? So that is all this validation phase where you have different numerical methods and tools that can help you with that. And we spend lots of time building these tools and then also doing this analysis. And the question would be, oh, so you have one analysis, but how do you know the analysis is right? Because it's stochastic. Nobody knows for sure. Can you have more different methods? An ensemble of methods help you understand the different kind of situation that a system will encounter.
00:20:01.478 - 00:20:35.720, Speaker B: And once you do that, there's also deployment. How do you work with the different teams to make sure we deploy that in a timely fashion? And how do we manage the community? Because sometimes you can have interesting design. How do you convince people, how do you say this is a design that is good for everyone in the ecosystem. So there is that of that. And lastly, you may go to governance. And I think this is a continuous trend where as more and more protocol move to community governance, how do you govern a community effectively? With different interests and so on. And we might lean in pretty heavily on data analytics to do that.
00:20:36.490 - 00:21:10.114, Speaker A: No, yeah, totally agree. Token design is an incredibly complex process and it takes a lot of work. It's great to have you in the space and have you really aspires in this field. All right, thank you ZX for joining us today. It's been very informative. Is there anything you'd like to say, you'd like to add? I don't know, maybe where can people learn more about filecoin? What do you guys focus right now?
00:21:10.152 - 00:21:50.666, Speaker B: Et cetera? Yeah, absolutely. So I think right now it's a pretty amazing opportunity to enter the filecoin ecosystem. There's lots of builders joining. I think, as I mentioned earlier, it's well positioned to support web two star interactions like migration and making it easy tooling to make it easy to store on Filecoin. That is very valuable and very high impact in and of itself. But at the same time, there's this whole greenfield of web3 style interaction that can be built on top of Filecoin and its interaction with other ecosystem. Filecoin starts from storage, but it doesn't end there, right? It's very close to all the other compute data, value, attribution, supply chain for data and so on and so forth.
00:21:50.666 - 00:22:25.180, Speaker B: So I strongly encourage everyone to check it out. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in building some ideas of getting bouncing some ideas off of me and our lab. The crypto economics lab at protocol labs is also hiring, so we're looking for data scientists, blockchain protocol engineers, research scientists. If you are working in the area, feel free to reach out. My email is ZX at protocol AI. We would love to have a chat and then let's move this web3 ecosystem token engineering system forward ecosystem forward together. Thank you.
