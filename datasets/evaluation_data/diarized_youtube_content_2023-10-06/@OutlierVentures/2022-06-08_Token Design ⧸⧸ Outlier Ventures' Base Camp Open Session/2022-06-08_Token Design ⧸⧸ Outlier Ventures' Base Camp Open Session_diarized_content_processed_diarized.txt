00:00:08.080 - 00:00:41.416, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Welcome to our session today, a tester session with the Outlive Ventures Token design team. My name is Hanan. I'm going to be your moderator today, but on my day to day job I'm a program manager for the base camp eight program. Today we're very lucky because we have the token design team with us. Let me try to share my screen first. And the way today will work is we are going to start the session and try to cover four main topics.
00:00:41.416 - 00:01:13.400, Speaker A: The first one is we are going to meet the team and try to understand what are their expertise, what their backgrounds are and why they are the right people to help you with your token design. We will also cover how the token design team helps basecam teams, why token design is so important and how do we navigate to economics in the current market. So we've got with us today Dimi, Yan and Mattis from the Token design team. I will pass the floor to Dimi to introduce himself and then to Matthews and Yan.
00:01:15.100 - 00:02:14.428, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks so much Anna for the introduction. And welcome everybody. Thank you so much for attending. We would like to spend the next probably 45 minutes to give you a bit of intro and a taste of session into outlier ventures and our token economies activities. I would quickly introduce myself and then I will pass it over to Matthews and Jan to also quickly introduce themselves. So you have a bit of our backgrounds and what motivates us, where we're coming from. And then I will quickly introduce the team, how we are structured and we will dive deeper into how we work as Hannah introduced and how we can help you achieve proper token economic system and how we see the current market and what we believe, describe and reflect the great token so quickly to myself.
00:02:14.428 - 00:02:52.360, Speaker B: I'm an aerospace engineer. I spent nearly ten years at university. From studying over research assistant in academia. I dived into the blockchain ecosystem over five years now ago where I was working in academia on a research project. So I'm holding two patent pendings around products that basically use blockchain technology. And there my private track started in cryptocurrencies. I'm now full time working in the space.
00:02:52.360 - 00:03:31.830, Speaker B: Since three years I've worked on the corporate side, leading projects around tokenization of assets and I spinned off with a project. I founded my own company and I went basically through the founders path. I know Outlier Ventures from the other side as a founder, so I went through Basecamp too. And recently I joined basically now Outlier as head of token economies to help projects and founders navigate and design their proper token system now handing it over to Matthews and.
00:03:40.650 - 00:03:44.620, Speaker A: Sorry, sorry, Matthews, you were on mute. You can go on now.
00:03:45.150 - 00:04:24.920, Speaker C: Is it working now? Cool. All right, so again, hello everyone. My name is Mattis. I've been at Outlier for almost two years now. My background is in investment banking and management consulting, and I sort of made the transition to crypto back in 2017 when I started working for a crypto focused venture capital fund. And yeah, I gradually became more and more interested in the mechanism design of token projects, which is essentially what token design is. And during my time in outlier, I've worked with more than 50 extremely diverse projects and yeah, happy to be here and share that experience with you.
00:04:26.170 - 00:04:26.920, Speaker A: Cool.
00:04:27.530 - 00:05:14.950, Speaker D: My name is Jan. My background is in tech and business, so I've had experience at a VC firm at Google for a while and startups also went through outlier with one of the startups. So that was an interesting experience. And then decided it's better on the other side, at least for myself. And then, yeah, so I've been with outlier for more than a year now on the token design role and very passionate about that subject because to me, I've always had this passion for designing games and games of all types, and I think that's a good frame of how to think about token design as basically designing games that are worth. Yeah, very excited to help design better games with the teams.
00:05:16.330 - 00:05:24.170, Speaker A: Thank you, Tim. Demi, how do we actually help teams at basecam in relations to token design?
00:05:24.320 - 00:06:44.274, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks. So maybe quickly to give you the domains we're working in as a team, and we structured the whole team in three domains, which is token design, token engineering, and Dow strategy. And within token design, we basically focus on the 360 degrees around token economical systems. So we do a lot of research, we understand the market, we understand the whole universe of token mechanisms out there. We apply best practices out there on our portfolio companies, but we design or develop also new developed ideas, depending also what the market is currently attractive in the market, and we do it on a lot of conceptual and qualitative basis. And then we hand it over basically into the token engineering domain where we dive deeper into later stage of basecamp, the second program, the ascent program, where we dive deeper into some kind of economical modeling and analysis. So we help there the projects around how they should think of the quantitative side and we basically look into revenues and everything.
00:06:44.274 - 00:07:42.120, Speaker B: I will introduce this later on, much more in detail. And on the Dow strategy part, it's basically around organizational structure and design of not only purely dows, basically it's all projects in web3 that have a path to decentralization, whatever they want to decentralize, being an element of the product, the whole product, the company, another entity. There is something about decentralization and we go through like a canvas and try to set up together the right things at the right time to focus on into decentralization and how we work at outlier within basecamp. I would like to give it over to Matus and Jan to describe the token design activities. And afterwards I will dive a bit deeper into the engineering part.
00:07:42.730 - 00:07:45.640, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess I can start. Is my mic working?
00:07:46.010 - 00:07:47.894, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good. No worries.
00:07:48.092 - 00:08:46.330, Speaker C: Yeah. So how do we work with projects? So basically, in most cases, we start by getting to know the project really well. And we do that by setting up a one on one call and really try to understand the business model, value flow, and all things that connect to sort of making sure that we know what the project is about and what it's doing. And already at the call we try to provide some indications as to if and where a potential token could come in. We also try to direct the project to any relevant resources they can use as food for thought in the meantime, as they are sort of thinking about their token design. Because although we try to be very hands on, it's very important that the project itself understands what their token design is about. And it's also able to make the important choices, and then it's also able to explain these choices to their community and investors.
00:08:46.330 - 00:10:03.220, Speaker C: That's for us, very important. And then in the subsequent week or two, we proceed to having sessions and workshops where we try to explain the, let's call it the basics of token design. And that's why it's important what it entails. What are some of the main frameworks to use when thinking about constructing token ecosystems? So that when we proceed to the next stage, which is one on one calls in which we perfect their token design ideas, we have this sort of common language and we're able to communicate and align efficiently. And to give you an idea on what this entails, the first step is to know what the objective of the token is. For example, do I want to use the token because I need to incentivize growth adoption traction, which is the case, for example, with the most liquidity mining mechanisms, such as curve or compound, or on the other hand, do I need the token to incentivize certain behaviors, which is the case, for example, with filecoin. Well, one important thing here is that this is very difficult to do if the project doesn't have its product idea cleared up.
00:10:03.220 - 00:11:21.126, Speaker C: In other words, it doesn't make much sense to do this exercise if we are still figuring out whether the project is an NFT marketplace or an NFT launch pad, because obviously the token would have very different objectives in each of these cases. So these token design exercises and this token design support comes only after we've figured out and clearly defined what the product. Yeah, and then once we know what we are doing, we proceed to analyzing the various stakeholders in the project's ecosystem. So for example, in the case of bitcoin, it's miners, users, exchanges, et cetera, and we try to understand their incentives, what they want, what they don't want, so that we can start thinking about the correct mechanisms to align all of these incentives for the common objective that we defined previously. So using the example of bitcoin, we have people who want to transact in a decentralized way and store value in a decentralized way. Then we have people who are miners and who have computation resources and they want to exchange these for fees. And a good token ecosystem is a one where all of these stakeholders feel like they are better off and the overall objective has been fulfilled.
00:11:21.126 - 00:12:00.790, Speaker C: For example, the objective of growth, the network is growing. If we are able to let. You're still using the example of bitcoin, which is the most OG example. If we are able to design the ecosystem in a way where users can come in and pay fees for the benefit of transacting in a decentralized way, miners can come in and exchange their resources, computation resources for their fees, and the ecosystem is growing. Well, that's in a nutshell what we'd be doing with you. That's the sort of token design win win. But that's definitely not all that we're.
00:12:00.790 - 00:12:05.420, Speaker C: Yeah, and I believe Jan has much more to add here.
00:12:07.230 - 00:13:13.898, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Mattis did a great job around outlying the process that we take projects through. And then generally what we look at when we design a token economy, which is making sure all of the stakeholders have the incentives set properly, and some other things generally, for example, making sure that the token captures value, that's another important part that we make sure with every team, and there's different ways of how we do that. But for example, with a fee or whether it's through a burning mechanism or buybacks, there's many ways, but we need to make sure that some way we capture value for the token holders. And so then there's other domains that we give. Also a workshop to give everybody an overview over what's important in these. But then depending on the team and the situation, we might spend much more time one on one in any of these subdomains, whatever makes sense. Just two of them would be distribution and governance.
00:13:13.898 - 00:14:08.210, Speaker D: So depending on the project, again, these are more or less relevant, but I think for all of them, there are at least somewhat relevant and need to be considered. So distribution then means once we have designed how that token works, how it interacts with the product, with all the stakeholders, why it's valuable, what mechanism it uses, we still need to think about, all right, now, how are we getting it out there, who gets it, how, when, basically. And so for that, we have a whole range of mechanisms at our disposal. We could sell it, or we could give it away, and then we could sell it in different ways. We could do private sales, a public sale, we could use auctions, and then on the giving away side. And that also ties into how we use the token as an incentive. That will be like, we could have an airdrop, or we can have continuous incentives.
00:14:08.210 - 00:15:00.446, Speaker D: Deciding between these options and then helping to spec out and model the options as much as possible is one of the things that we're working with the teams on. And so distribution is one of these areas, and then governance would be a whole other one. So that is within that token system, how are decisions made? And then that might be on different levels. And here, too, there's a range of mechanisms like the proposal and voting scheme that I'm sure if you've ever been on a snapshot voting page, I'm sure you're familiar with that set up. But there's a whole range of other things that we can do. For example, use delegation and then the type of delegation we use. And even with the voting and proposals, how you set the thresholds and the quorum, all of that is valid and needs to be considered.
00:15:00.446 - 00:15:21.800, Speaker D: And so, yeah, I hope that gives you some more ideas around what we might discuss in a team. And then all of these mechanisms have trade offs. So there's not like, this is one best token design. It really is different in every circumstance because we need to incorporate incentives for the specific stakeholders that are at play.
00:15:23.290 - 00:15:46.260, Speaker A: Cool. And there's a question there in the ask the question box. Are all basecam attendees encouraged to make their own token, or is it often better to use an existing token until specific criteria are met? And based on what I'm hearing, there's a lot of like, it depends answer to the specificity of the companies that we on board. Anything you guys want to add on that?
00:15:49.210 - 00:16:37.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I can take this one. I didn't understand yet. The second part of the question around the existing token, maybe the audience is asking specifically if we build, for example on Ethereum, why not to use Ethereum or any other stablecoin? So generally, to answer the question for us, the most importantly is basically if the product you're creating is not functioning without a token, then leave it. Because then it gives us a bit of vibes of a Ponti scheme. So first and foremost, it's about your product. Your product should be working even without a token, if it's not a layer one blockchain infrastructure that needs, for example, to secure the network. Right, and you need your own token.
00:16:37.750 - 00:17:45.340, Speaker B: But we will get later to this point around why we believe on how a token can help. If we move into web3 and decentralization, the token can help encourage specific behavior and then token can help you acquire much faster. At the beginning your user, by testing the product and incentivizing them, you can basically give them, also hand them over a bit of governance on the product they're even using, and give them back value by bringing value, getting back some value. But to make it short, no, we're not pushing 100% to go for a token. It should be just if it's the right fit there and we believe we can do a proper token and bake it into that's going to fuel the product, then we will advise to do it. Otherwise, probably get first your product out and we can see further down the line if it makes sense to implement one.
00:17:46.110 - 00:18:06.080, Speaker D: And typically, at least within the base camp scope, we're working with projects who haven't yet launched their token. I believe in ascend they have cases where it's actually a redesign of an existing token. But yeah, generally it's projects who are still developing their token or haven't even started yet.
00:18:07.250 - 00:18:27.880, Speaker A: Just a bit of context that at outlier ventures we have two different programs. Basecam are for early stage companies, and SnR for companies that would like to launch token and a bit more mature for valuation wise. Cool. And then demi, maybe circling back to what you and your team are doing for Basecamp teams, what else can you help them.
00:18:32.410 - 00:19:42.442, Speaker B: Generally? I mean, it's all about setting up the right expectations at the beginning and what we want to optimize for with the project. So if the project basically wants to create product market fit and get first users on board, then we will try to focus how they can do it and how the token can help. But in a sense how we can help them achieve or what we can do and help to help them achieve everything is at the beginning we structure first the problem. So one of the main things is always designing tokens and multidisciplinary thing. And founders have so many things in their head around they need to raise funds, they need to talk to lawyers, they need to care about the community and marketing. And often they don't have time for all this deep dive into token economical system. So we help them first, bringing simplicity in structuring the problem, what they want to solve, understanding what we need to focus on, on setting up the roadmap, not to lose themselves in complexity, but do one thing after another, helping to articulate how the web3 product functions.
00:19:42.442 - 00:20:40.418, Speaker B: I mean, we get investors feedback, we get the market feedback, so we understand what makes a product great and what makes a token great. So we try to focus on especially designing a token that is sophisticated, but at the same time it's simple to use. The moment you add in too much of complexity, it might end up being exit liquidity for somebody else or whatever. And it depends also who your customer base is. So it's simplicity, it's sophisticated token mechanisms, it's linking the token to the real value of the product that's being created and thinking of the right mechanics. Right. A defi product needs another kind of token than a game might need it.
00:20:40.418 - 00:21:11.420, Speaker B: Or as I said, an infrastructure layer needs a token, maybe to secure the network. So you have really different bunch of mechanics you need to think of. And we're strong there. As Mattu said, he helped so many projects, Jan, myself, so together we saw dozens of projects out there and tokens. So I believe we can definitely help them and provide the best of our value. Yeah, think that's a great.
00:21:13.810 - 00:21:18.270, Speaker A: Why is token design so important? What makes a good token?
00:21:21.650 - 00:21:40.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have different answers here. I would say, of course we are aligned within our team, that we want to optimize for the same outcomes. But I would say I would like to hear first, like what Matthews thinks, what Jan thinks about that. And I will add at the end.
00:21:40.810 - 00:22:39.302, Speaker C: Yeah. So for me, a good token design would be a one that keeps its objectives in mind, understands its stakeholders, and kind of comes up with mechanisms that align stakeholders'wants, with the overall. So for example, I don't know, I'm sure most of you are familiar with Aave, which is the lending and borrowing Defi protocol. So for example, one of Ave's goals is safety. So what they did is that they designed a mechanism called safety module, where AavE governance token holders can stake their tokens and earn yield, which comes from the protocol's revenues. But when there is an economic shortfall and AavE's users perhaps lose money, they get compensated with these. So this mechanism does a couple of things.
00:22:39.302 - 00:23:27.800, Speaker C: First, it incentivizes Aave governance token holders to lock their tokens and earn yield on them, so they're less likely to sell the token, which is overall good for the token ecosystem and for the project. And then the token has this extra functionality of being able to earn additional yield, so the token holders are happy, and it also provides this extra layer of safety for the protocol. So the users of the protocol are happy and the protocol is happy as well, because this mechanism reduces the circulating supply of the token and that positively impacts the price. So to me this is a good example of a good token design. It's a token design win win, because the users are winning, the protocol is winning, and the token holders are winning. So that's how I would sum it up.
00:23:29.210 - 00:24:19.910, Speaker D: Yeah, that's great, maybe to put a slightly different frame on it. But again, the answer is going to be convergent, would be to look at it again from this angle of games. So as Matt has explained, we want it to be win win for all the stakeholders. And that's what I would call a good game to play, because if everybody can win, they're all going to be happy continuing playing the game. So that's just the general answer. And then I would just check mark a few important things, one of them being the value capture. So we need to make sure that if the protocol or product is successful, that actually the token two will go up in value, because that relationship is not, we need to design it into the system, and so it's not there for default, except maybe through brand association.
00:24:19.910 - 00:25:15.580, Speaker D: But ideally we'd have a stronger link there. So the token should capture value, and then we should also definitely think about the supply dynamics of the token. So that includes when we're selling it, to whom, but it also includes mechanisms like Mattis mentioned staking. So that's one way how we can, from a mechanism point of view, reinforce positive supply dynamics. So I'd say that's the second very important point, and then maybe a third one would be to see whether the token can be used as an incentive to gain an unfair advantage. So how can we make this more appealing than the same model without a token? And so it can do more than just distribute value and capture it, but it can actually lead to a sustainable competitive advantage through the token design. So that's what I'd be aiming for.
00:25:17.470 - 00:26:22.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I can underline this. So I'd like to see a token that it is rewarding. On the one side that it can achieve basically flywheel effect through rewarding your biggest contributors who bring the value to your own product. And not just passive holders that just buy in or whatever, but at the same time that the mechanics are designed in that way, that this rewarding and emission schedule comes at the point where basically it's not forever and it decreases slowly and the value capture kicks in. That product is creating, generating revenue, creating value, and then the token basically starts capturing this and reflecting this. And another point, for me, it's always about simplicity. So tokens are in its nature even difficult to understand.
00:26:22.398 - 00:26:58.060, Speaker B: And if your main customers are like retail customers, you want to onboard into web3, you need to keep it simple and have simple rules around your token. And best example for me is always for example, Makerdao. Even if it sounds complicated, the rules are simple. Borrowers have to keep a collateral ratio or they can get liquidated plus a liquidation fee and liquidations bid on the vault with die. That's like the simple rules, although the whole protocol is complex. And that's what I would like to add on this too.
00:26:59.790 - 00:27:11.710, Speaker A: Amazing. Anything else that you guys want to add in relations to what you look for in a company when you work with them in relation to token design specifically?
00:27:16.550 - 00:27:58.080, Speaker C: Well, I would just say that despite the fact that you can do very fancy stuff with token design and you can come up with all these cool mechanisms that incentivize this over this and all that, it's very important to have to work on adoption traction to make sure the product is useful. Because if the product doesn't work, then the token design is not going to do anything about it. Definitely in the medium to long term, sure you can use it to temporarily artificially increase adoption in the short term, but that's really not what we are looking for. So that's just something that I would add.
00:27:58.770 - 00:28:10.690, Speaker A: And Mathis, just on your expertise in relations to stakeholders earlier, there's a question here that says how can one define the actors or stakeholders token actions while designing the token?
00:28:11.270 - 00:28:14.514, Speaker C: How can one, sorry, define define the.
00:28:14.552 - 00:28:18.310, Speaker A: Actors or stakeholders token actions while designing the token?
00:28:20.090 - 00:29:15.174, Speaker C: Well, how you do it? Well, basically you just have to analyze your different participants in your ecosystem. So if you have customers or clients, you have to break down who they are. Perhaps there are different. I'm not sure what the right word is, but subspecies, right. Because they can have different preferences and they might want or need different things. And all that is something that you need to understand in order to be able to design the incentives and the mechanism so that it actually takes on and people start using or start engaging with aspects of the token design. I wouldn't say there's a correct way of doing it.
00:29:15.174 - 00:29:36.800, Speaker C: You really have to understand your customers, and not only your customers, but perhaps other participants in your ecosystem. So for example, if you're working with telcos because they're providing the infrastructure for your project, you need to understand them, what they want, what they don't want, if they have any problems that need solving as a result of the kind of antiquated web two infrastructure, all that.
00:29:38.530 - 00:30:21.002, Speaker B: Cool, thanks. I can add also on this, this process of designing a token, it's not from zero to one, it's like an iterative process. So before analyzing what token actions by each stakeholder can be, first you need to analyze and understand what general actions on the product can be before they even get a token in their hand, the stakeholders and actors. So after understanding this, we try, as I said, to bake in a token. That's going to fuel it. And then I would say it's a lot of experience and that is what makes us strong as outlier. We have seen a lot of behaviors out there.
00:30:21.002 - 00:31:07.994, Speaker B: I mean, it's like we think about them as agents and each agent is a role that is acting in any way and we need to understand. And that, as I said, experience kicks in. How can a product or the token design can be gamified or exploited or whatever? Because there will be always actors that will try to exploit it. And based on our experience, we try to think of every possible scenario and to understand different kind of edge cases, because what we don't want to end up is getting into a death spiral. With a token price, you have only once your chance. It's the one shot you only can once emit your token and that's it. So we need to make it right.
00:31:07.994 - 00:31:36.050, Speaker B: And sometimes I advise first, like, let's bring your product live and afterwards launch a token depending on the market, right? You don't want to handle bad price action because the overall market sentiment is bearish. It might end up your token price also to go down even if your product is great. We see that currently with a lot of product. So first of all, it's around the product and then the token actions.
00:31:37.210 - 00:31:46.710, Speaker A: Speaking of market, how do you guys think the current market sentiment is affecting token design principles?
00:31:50.430 - 00:32:34.760, Speaker D: Maybe I can go first with a few points. Well, generally I think the sentiment and the narratives are shifting around. So that means people will maybe tend towards more conservatism. So trusting mechanisms and token designs that have been proven for longer. I think people will tend towards that and also maybe be more conservative when it comes to using public sales. Maybe. I think I could see it projects preferring to raise from private investors and then maybe doing a bit more distributions, maybe more airdrops and less public sales will be one guess of what might happen soon.
00:32:37.370 - 00:32:38.120, Speaker A: Cool.
00:32:39.470 - 00:33:16.450, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say that based on my experience. Is my mic working? No. Yes. Perfect. Based on my experience. So the last couple of months, I believe, can be characterized by two things, like a widespread collapse of token prices across the board, and then also the lunar failure. And the lunar failure has been particularly interesting because what I'm seeing specifically in stablecoin design is that projects are way more wary of collateralizing their stable coins with their native volatile governance tokens.
00:33:16.450 - 00:33:51.280, Speaker C: Or at least when they do, they supplement it with uncorrelated assets. So, long story short, I feel like they are thinking much more in terms of risk management, correlation of the underlying assets. And yeah, the Luna collabs has been a bit of a wake up call when it comes to designing tokens that are financially sort of relevant and meaningful and carry a lot of value and have the potential to impact people's lives.
00:33:52.130 - 00:35:54.902, Speaker B: And I would say as a third person in the round that it's basically the best time to think about token designs. Because priorly, where everybody just dropped a token out and incentivized aggressively, just pure users of the protocol or just by providing some liquidity or whatever, it ended up basically creating a lot of farmers that exploited the system and just had their own job, was basically to use as much possible to gain these tokens and to dump them on the market and go to the next product and continue doing this. And previously it was difficult to explain all this thinking why you should do it and why should you give us so much token? And it's the biggest cost for a product, basically for its strategy, and now it's the best time, because now they think and the whole market understands it, they just dive deeper into the projects. They take the time to dive deeper into projects. So they care about your product, and we're seeing basically much more advanced and sophisticated mechanics, like how they can lock in, how you as a founder and as a product can lock in your stakeholders, that you can still incentivize them, but you can keep them more engaged and these are the things we are seeing like a shifting. And another point is how basically also the merch is coming around nfts and fungible tokens where we're getting previously we have been seeing the whole NFT and another PFP project and another PFP project and it was unexplainable for a lot of us. What's the whole thing? Why is this happening and why are these crazy performances out there? And we saw that many projects got a big hit now.
00:35:54.902 - 00:36:17.070, Speaker B: And what we're seeing basically strong what we thought is a pure PFP project becoming an ecosystem, designing even a fungible token. And we see the next phase will be how these kinds of things merge. We see NFT utilization within the product plus a fungible token. So great time also as a token designer to be alive.
00:36:17.730 - 00:36:41.670, Speaker A: Yeah, and just on that we've got the right question for your comment there. Where someone is coming from a very web two sort of industry, or like heavily legacy industry vertical and wanting to move to a new market category that uses token, what would typically be some of the best strategies for people who want to embark on a new journey?
00:36:42.090 - 00:37:46.646, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question because this is something we discuss currently on a weekly basis because this is what we are seeing. Many web two projects moving or try to move into web3, and a lot of them have been until now, pretty naive. Like I want to come into web3 and drop a token or just do another NFT. And that's where also we are helping out. Very good on the side is basically understanding first why you want to do this move and what elements of the product should become web3. I mean it's a bit of like the whole business model around web3 platforms had been basically to be the intermediary that connects supply and demand and then projects want to move into web3. So the first thing we want to understand is are you about to disrupt your own business model? Because web3 also is also about cutting out the middleman and the intermediary.
00:37:46.646 - 00:38:57.166, Speaker B: And that's mostly, no, we don't want to do this. Right. So we dive deeper into, okay, what makes sense, what kind of elements maybe is it maybe you want to onboard web3 users because they have some kind of, some other kind of user bases that can help your product or they can, I don't know, usage, another vertical whatever, or is it you want to move the payment infrastructure on web3? So we try to analyze which kind of elements should become web3 and then we will think about what makes sense in order to even drop a token, because dropping a token as an established web two company is even more difficult. I mean, you have your shareholders already, maybe you have already ipoed. So there is another kind of complexity we need to dive deeper into. That's why I think we see also a lot of web two projects going into launching an NFT and experimenting with nfts. But this market is also becoming pretty saturated because what's after me as a user in web3? Buying an NFT token.
00:38:57.166 - 00:39:03.860, Speaker B: So it's all about understanding first why the movement into web3 and what should become web3.
00:39:06.470 - 00:39:11.080, Speaker A: Cool. You want to make a comment there on public sales?
00:39:13.050 - 00:39:50.974, Speaker D: Yeah, I thought that was a great question in the chat, Sven. I didn't mean to express that there was a problem with public sales. I'm actually a great advocate for them. And I think it's one of the things that makes crypto unique is that we can include a much wider set of people. And I would very much hope that these opportunities continue to exist. I was more describing it from a level of what one might expect to happen and why. I think how that correlates to the bear market is that just in a bear market, everything tends to go down because people lose confidence in crypto as a category.
00:39:50.974 - 00:40:59.058, Speaker D: So even if your individual project is going well, if it's publicly traded and we're in a bear market, it might go down for a while just with all of the rest of the market. And if you've sold to retail investors, they're usually the ones who really kind of get hurt by this and complain and might sue you. Whereas for the private investors, they're usually vested for years, so they couldn't even sell. And also they're doing it professionally, so they're used to the markets going up and down. So there, it's just much easier and less potential negative downside. However, what I think it can totally also be mitigated on the mechanism level. For example, if we had public sales where people also vest, just like the private investors, I think then yes, I think we could remove that potential downside of people getting hurt or just in general, like maybe having a sale event and then the token gets released gradually over time, not just with other mechanisms other than vesting.
00:40:59.058 - 00:41:10.730, Speaker D: I think that might also become more popular, and I would hope so. I was just describing how I might see the market reacting to a general downturn.
00:41:12.190 - 00:41:32.340, Speaker A: Cool. Okay. Glad that we got that cleared up. So we've got one last question from the box there, and apologies that we weren't able to cover everything the question is, do the token design teams continue to work with the teams after launch to provide ongoing support or assistance with economics, pivots, et cetera, if needed?
00:41:34.390 - 00:42:06.720, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So you're our portfolio company once you are within basecamp, so we still provide you, you're still our kit, and there are a couple of portfolio companies that even turn into like the token model V two or V three. So we are providing still advice or even if it's coming to oh, you're going to be decentralized and you want to basically change some stuff and you need to do a proper governance proposal. Yes, we're going to help you in this.
00:42:08.050 - 00:42:42.970, Speaker A: Cool. And with that I'm going to use the next few minutes to just maybe outline what we have in relation to basecam. So the base cam program is a twelve week program that we have here at Ov. We're looking for eight to twelve promising teams building on any chain, although if you're building on polygon, we have a similar program happening in parallel in July. We're looking for exceptional founders. OV is a talent first vc company. We look at ability to execute, domain expertise, commercial awareness.
00:42:42.970 - 00:43:38.118, Speaker A: We're not limited for particular base cam on any specific thesis. So anything that you're building infrastructure, nfts, cross chain, dapps, developer tools, anything not specific to any category, we will assess. We will offer you 100,000 usd investment upfront so you can focus your time and energy on building your companies and interacting with our token design team with whatever you need. Token wise we provide all around expert support. So not just token design, we also have legal fundraising. I can see in the chat earlier, there's so many jurisdiction questions, some strategy questions, which we have in house experts for that. And you also have access to obese ecosystem, including our mentors, investors, founders and our alumni network, which is still active even after they've moved on from BScam.
00:43:38.118 - 00:44:31.462, Speaker A: So application will close on the 9 June, so very soon. Make sure you either book an office hour to fast track or submit application as soon as possible, and then you will receive our offer confirmation on the week of the 20th to 27th, and the program will start from the 4 July. From then you will have access to our in house experts, including the Token design team up until the 23 September where we have our main event called diffusion. And then you also have a two month support afterwards. And then as I mentioned, you'll be part of our alumni network and still can have access to our expertise. Yeah, so with that being said, I would just like to thank everyone from the Token design team for your time today. I know you guys are very busy and very pleased that everyone's here spending a bit of your time for our applicants.
00:44:31.462 - 00:44:52.020, Speaker A: And if you have any questions in relation to the base camp program, please feel free to reach out to me. Send across an email to Hananor at Outliventures IO, or you can book an office hour available on our website. Any last words from you guys? No? Yes.
00:44:56.790 - 00:44:58.020, Speaker C: Sorry, go ahead.
00:44:58.390 - 00:45:12.780, Speaker B: Different bunch of questions that have stayed unanswered. So one thing I want to add, like, feel free to reach out to us over LinkedIn. We are open and happy to answer. Answer questions that stayed unanswered today.
00:45:13.550 - 00:45:19.174, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Bye.
00:45:19.302 - 00:45:20.410, Speaker D: See you. Bye.
