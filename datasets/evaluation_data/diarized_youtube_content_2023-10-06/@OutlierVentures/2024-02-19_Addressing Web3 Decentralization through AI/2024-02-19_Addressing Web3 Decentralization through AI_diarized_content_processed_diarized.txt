00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.950, Speaker A: Looking at the market, you know, around generative AI as well, the rise of so much content, it's so easy actually to create content, but it's super hard to, you know, differentiate now between what's real and what's actually fake. So again, you know, leveraging some of this developments with AI, but with the transparency and the provability and so on with blockchain, I think is a real your benefit of combining.
00:00:38.410 - 00:00:53.442, Speaker B: Hello, my name is Jasper de Mara. I'm research lead here at Outliers Ventures. And welcome to the Metaverse podcast. I'm joined here today with Ruth Galvin to talk about the upcoming AIX crypto program, which we're very excited about. Welcome, Ruth.
00:00:53.526 - 00:01:01.870, Speaker A: Awesome, great to be here. So yes, I'm Ruth, the program manager for this upcoming base camp, which will be really good. So looking forward to discussing it.
00:01:02.020 - 00:01:25.638, Speaker B: So I think we'll ask the most important question first. Right. Why does this matter? Why is crypto AI an important topic? We've obviously discussed this already, like in 2018. I think with the convergent thesis coming out, feel like there's more excitement in the space now that, hence why we're launching a base camp. So let's get into the weeds. Why is this important? Why were you excited about this?
00:01:25.724 - 00:02:23.158, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're increasingly seeing the convergence of these two types of technology. So AI and web three encrypto the technology has been around for over a decade now, but it's really more recently that the rise of more complex llms and generative AI that we're really seeing the benefits of these two coming together. And when we look at the current state of the Internet, it's quite clear that there's some key structural issues that are still there. So I think four that we also outline in thesis is firstly, misinformation, lack of data privacy and security, the rise of bots, and also algorithmic bias and centralized control. So when you look at those with AI becoming more ubiquitous as well, I think those are just going to be exasperated. So it's really an opportunity for founders as well to start building in this space and bring together the benefits of both of these technologies into the convergence tech stack.
00:02:23.254 - 00:03:12.662, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think some other observations we've seen as well is web two is increasingly adopting AI technology in their front end as well, actually creating this sense of urgency in web three that we cannot be left behind. Right. I think we need to start taking AI integration into the front end more seriously if you don't want to fall behind from a user experience perspective. And I think also, what we've seen is that as this technology obviously falls into the hands of the masses, like through mass adoption and through application integration, there are some limitations. There's some limitations around data privacy, there are some limitations around scalability of the tech. So what are the ultimate benefits that are unlocked by combining both technologies in this convergence stack?
00:03:12.726 - 00:03:49.666, Speaker A: I mean, when you look at the heart of both of these technologies, they're both based off data, essentially. So blockchain at more of the infrastructure level of storing data and then AI building on top of that. So kind of extracting some of the value from the data and so on. So even looking at that tech stack, I think is like quite an interesting piece. Find the commonality between them and then how they're different and where they can intersect. I think it's also interesting if you try and bring it to life with an example. So, looking at healthcare, for example, AI models at the moment, they're only as good as the data that feeds it and also the data availability.
00:03:49.666 - 00:05:11.050, Speaker A: But a lot of data in healthcare just isn't available because it's really personal and private data. So if you can leverage some of the privacy preserving aspects of blockchain and crypto and combine that with AI, I think you can actually really make some advancements in that space. So whether that's privacy preserving around ZKML or some other technologies around that, I think it's a really cool area to see what can be built from that. Maybe as a second example, looking at the market around generative AI as well, the rise of so much content, it's so easy actually to create content, but it's super hard to differentiate now between what's real and what's actually fake. So again, leveraging some of this developments with AI, but with the transparency and the provability and so on with blockchain, I think is a real benefit of combining. And from a societal level, it's super important, whether it's deep fakes or some of this other misinformation, how can you prove it is real and that impacts politics or social aspects? So, yeah, hopefully we won't see as many Taylor Swift deepfakes after the combination, but, yeah, I think those are two examples.
00:05:11.130 - 00:05:41.990, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think there's a genuine excitement about the intersection, right. Especially because, as you mentioned, deepfakes authenticity, it's very top of mind into 20 to 24 going into arguably, like the biggest election, again, from the US. So solving these issues are very pressing. If you then look a little bit further out, because obviously we're only scratching the surface of what's possible. Right. We did a lot of market mapping, we looked at the ecosystem, we've identified trends.
00:05:41.990 - 00:06:20.390, Speaker B: The more short term trends are around, I think augmentation. So improving existing practices, for example, like the authenticity checks, audits, for example, like AI driven smart contracts, or like smart contract audits, some of the shorter term ones, if we push it very far out, like at a long term, more exciting stuff, we are looking at ZKML, decentralized model marketplaces and AI agents. What are you currently seeing in that pocket of the market? Because that's far out, right? That's ultimate end goal, definitely.
00:06:20.460 - 00:06:54.980, Speaker A: And I think that's an opportunity for builders and founders because it does feel like this is white space. Like we really are at the beginning of this intersection. So, yeah, we did a lot of work of really mapping who's currently building in the space and grouping some of those categories together, the decentralized resources. So that was the marketplaces and so on that are there. So whether that's marketplaces around data models and so on. So kind of looking at a supply and demand within the AI landscape in web three. Second is around AI agents.
00:06:54.980 - 00:07:23.260, Speaker A: I think the third category is looking at that security and privacy preserving technology. So ZKML, and then lastly is the enhancements. So it's a broader category of the builders that are bringing augmenting AI with web three or web three with AI. And there are other buckets around there, but those are kind of the four groupings that we managed to do from the startup landscape and also the types of companies that we'd be looking for roughly as well.
00:07:24.830 - 00:07:32.926, Speaker B: Do you feel like this is an exhaustive list? Like all four buckets capture the entire space, or how are we currently looking at it?
00:07:33.028 - 00:08:04.454, Speaker A: Honestly, no. I think these are just a starting point, because if we're right here today, we don't know what could come in the future. So being very transparent with that is if a founder is building something that doesn't fit in one of those categories, I would 100% encourage them to come to Ov and just talk about it and see if it's a good fish and if some of our team can also help bring that to market into life. So I think it's very much just the beginning and super excited to see where we go from here.
00:08:04.572 - 00:08:16.346, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think looking at the market map, these four pillars also underpin the program. Right. Could you tell us a little bit more about the program, how it's going to be structured and what we can.
00:08:16.368 - 00:09:09.158, Speaker A: Expect going into that yeah, definitely. So the program will run over twelve weeks and by joining the program you'll have access to some of the top specialists within the web three space withinov. So we've got tech token marketing, fundraising, legal, and also a broader mentor network of both AI and web three experts. So there will be both workshops around a range of topics, really 360 support to grow your business and then also more of a one to one session. So really going beyond the surface level and diving into your tech strategy and fundraising strategy with our experts and then also connecting you in with the broader ecosystem as well. So yeah, twelve weeks and then it all culminates in an end of program demo day where you'd pitch to the network of investors and if fundraising isn't your roadmap, then continue on to fundraise.
00:09:09.254 - 00:09:17.278, Speaker B: So for the founders and our listeners, who are obviously excited about this program, like where could they get in touch? How could they learn more about the program?
00:09:17.444 - 00:09:35.634, Speaker A: Yeah, so you can check it out on our website. So outliventures IO and we have the thesis that's there as well, which we've been heavily involved in. And yeah, lots of information on our website. So yeah, definitely check it out and you're welcome to also reach out to the OB team as well.
00:09:35.752 - 00:09:50.630, Speaker B: So Ruth, you're going to be the program manager for this specific AI program, right. You're already very experienced with decentralized marketplaces. Last year you were heading up the IPFS program. What are some of the key takeaways having worked with founders building in the space?
00:09:50.780 - 00:10:24.658, Speaker A: So IPfs firstly is all around decentralized storage and kind of retrieving data as well. So I think it has some overlap with also some of the companies that we saw in the program. Maybe to highlight one in quarter three last year we had exabytes. So exabytes saw the rise of AI and the cost of that as well. So they were building a decentralized compute platform. And yeah, through this program that we were running with protocol labs, exabytes could come in and really grow, but they've been fantastic. They've grown their business massively since then.
00:10:24.658 - 00:11:18.930, Speaker A: Really good revenue, that revenue growth, and they've now oversubscribed their round as well. So it's been fantastic to see. And then I think more broadly, your question advice for founders building in the space? I think there's a lot. I mean, firstly, both AI and web three are super deep technical areas that we have specialists and founders with deep technical knowledge within there. So I feel like sometimes it's also translating that into bringing into the commercial realm and becoming VC ready. So how do you really, really translate as a founder your vision, and from the technical concept to a scalable business model and a scalable business. So through the program, to give an example, in the first two weeks, we'll introduce the founders to kind of 30 plus people from the ecosystem and they'll pitch quite a lot and really start to refine and iterate on their pitch and find what sticks.
00:11:18.930 - 00:11:40.746, Speaker A: And that's a really good way to also set the program of founders building up their network and meeting others and finding what's the right way to also position themselves going forwards and where there might be some gaps and where they need to fill those. And it kind of sets the scene and the stage for the rest of the program, which can also become quite tailored as well.
00:11:40.848 - 00:11:48.560, Speaker B: So we're launching this program, right? We're launching this AI X crypto program. What can founders expect and what are we delivering for them?
00:11:48.930 - 00:12:24.822, Speaker A: Yes. So this program will really focus on that intersection, AI and web three. And when we were looking at the market, what are the current startups within this space and what are some of our investment pillars? I would say that there's at least four categories within there. So first category would be decentralized resources, so decentralized marketplaces, whether that's around data models, compute. Second one is around AI agents. Third is around cryptographically enhanced AI. And then the fourth is looking at AI and web three augmentation.
00:12:24.822 - 00:13:10.522, Speaker A: So kind of a broader category of where can web three augment AI, and also vice versa. So I would say there's more categories than that as well. Those are just some of the high level ones. So if founders are building outside of those, definitely still check out the program and apply. And then also going to your question, what can founders really expect from the program? I think building the ecosystem around it is really important and like a really key part of the program. So diving into our mentors, mentors come from throughout the ecosystem. So we'll have sector experts, domain experts, previous founders, so you can learn from someone who's already been through that process, investors and so on.
00:13:10.522 - 00:13:48.130, Speaker A: And then we also have our partners. So looking at some of the past programs we've run, we have partners from different protocols, also enterprises like Walmart and Farfetch, and we have enterprise advisors that we've had like KPMG. So it's really all of these top world class partners from web three, enterprise and other areas coming together to support the founders. I think sometimes being a founder can be quite a solo journey or even if you've got lots of people around you. So it's really trying to bolster up the founders and make sure they're connected and supported.
00:13:48.290 - 00:14:10.794, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think we're trying to fulfill our role again as this intermediator. Right. And this will be especially important when you're dealing with two verticals which historically have been very sinoids and are now all of a sudden converging. Right. So bringing AI expertise and Webtree expertise, which has been for us, like our bread and butter, will be critical to this program. Right.
00:14:10.794 - 00:14:28.510, Speaker B: So it's something we're very excited about. I think it's going to be a vertical we'll be looking at for the next decade, at least. I think very constructive on this one. Is there anything like, anything you would like to say to the founders? Any last messages in terms of how they reach out to you, how they can get involved?
00:14:28.590 - 00:14:47.140, Speaker A: So it's been great. Speaking today, we've covered the thesis of the AI web three base camp. We've given you a snippet of what the base camp could look like. So if you're a founder, I would really encourage you to apply. You can find out more information and apply at our website, outlierventures IO. I would really encourage you to check it out.
