00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.426, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Defi basecamp elevate panel today. My name is Joshua Koplavatsky. I'm the Defi basecamp program manager here at Outlier Adventures and I'll be your host today. With me, I've got three amazing panelists who kindly dedicated their time to give us a bit of an insight into their lives and their involvement in the Defi basecamp. So let me start by introducing them. First of all, we have a mentor with us, and our mentor is Yuki Yuminaga.
00:00:27.426 - 00:00:42.194, Speaker A: Yuki works at Fanbushi Capital and he is a researcher and investor there. Fanbushi Capital is one of the most prominent venture capital blockchain investors worldwide and we are glad to have him with us today. Thank you for being here today.
00:00:42.332 - 00:00:44.874, Speaker B: Thanks for having me and great to be here as well.
00:00:44.992 - 00:01:05.682, Speaker A: Secondly, we have Amber, she with us. Amber is the head of venture at New Order. Now. New Order is not only our valued partner within the Defi base camp, they are also an incubation Dao and as such have produced many reputable Defi projects in their own right. Nice to have you here, Amber. Thank you for taking your time.
00:01:05.816 - 00:01:07.822, Speaker C: Thank you, Yasha. Always a pleasure.
00:01:07.966 - 00:01:16.270, Speaker A: Last but least, we have Kareem Halabi with us. Kareem is a token designer on the outlay adventures token team. Good to have you here, Kareem.
00:01:16.350 - 00:01:18.530, Speaker B: Yeah, pleasure to be here. Thanks, guys.
00:01:18.680 - 00:01:43.440, Speaker A: So I've got a couple of questions prepared, and I want to go straight into those. So the first question I'd like to pose to Yuki. So, Yuki, you work at Fibushi. You see a lot of DFO, you see a lot of fantastic projects coming across your desk, yet you still decided to be a mentor on the Defi base camp. What sort of motivated you to become a mentor, and how do you guide these portfolio companies that you work.
00:01:48.290 - 00:02:52.866, Speaker B: Started? Well, when I was first noticed about the outlier Richards Defi base campus. I think one of the portfolio companies, or like few of the companies that was either a portfolio or almost become a portfolio came out of Defi base camp. So that's when I noticed that, oh, there's some interesting camp around here that is creating some good quality projects. And that's when I was like, okay, well, maybe I want to also chat up with them and see exactly what they're doing. And turns out you guys are doing a lot of projects iterations with founders. And yeah, you guys were also looking for some external support from my side. So that's when I was like, okay, maybe I would help participate and share some of my perspectives on stuff as well.
00:02:52.866 - 00:03:51.960, Speaker B: Now, specifically on the side of how I would be participating for DeFi based camp. So I oftentimes do a lot of research a bit more so like a deeper research on things like Meb and trust minimized, infra and privacy stuff and whatnot. And so I would be kind of more so providing some perspectives from that aspect to a lot of DeFi projects, whether it be building stuff in the mev space, or maybe building some stuff in some dark pool type of stuff or whatever that might be. I mean, a lot of it's quite relevant to those heavy infrastructure as part of their engineering work as, yeah, that's kind of like where I try to help them as much as possible. Okay, awesome. Thank you for that.
00:03:52.490 - 00:04:10.490, Speaker A: The second question is to Amber. Amber, at new order, you incubate a lot of projects, and yet you decided to partner with outlier ventures to run the Defi base camp. What sort of motivated you and what do you think the base camp can offer to founders?
00:04:10.990 - 00:05:03.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I've had the pleasure of working with OV for the last two years. We've launched three cohorts together, and the fourth one is on the way. I want to say I'm very impressed by how much value the program can add to the startups. I think ov truly understand how a crypto startup differs from a web to one. If you look at a curriculum, there are a lot of very uniquely deFi, uniquely crypto components, like, for example, the liquidity management, the token design, the token fundraising, which are highly necessary for the founders to understand, but not always covered by other programs. And I want to say it's not just the individual parts, it's also the structure of it. It's about bringing structure to a naturally chaotic world of building startups.
00:05:03.710 - 00:05:29.490, Speaker C: So I think the program is divided to different phases. The founders know what to focus on on each stage. I think that's also really important. Other than that, I want to say the people. I really like the fact that each venture has its own venture associate. I have a program manager like Yuyasha, so they know where to find support, who to turn to when it's necessary.
00:05:29.910 - 00:05:48.890, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great answer. We like to call it tailored support, and I think let's keep going with that theme, because tailored support is something we pride ourselves on. Now, Kareem, you work on a token team and you interact especially a lot with our DeFi projects. So why do you think token support is so important for DeFi projects?
00:05:50.290 - 00:06:39.980, Speaker B: There are several reasons why tokens or tokenized things are important in just, I'll cover like three. So firstly, especially for DeFi, liquidity is especially know products live and die by the liquidity they manage to attract. And here tokens often play a very important role. Furthermore, the token can also often be part of the mechanism design of the project itself, and can have a big role to play in the financial engineering behind the product and figuring out how it actually works from a first principles basis. And more often than not, a lot of projects actually go and fundraise with their token. So it's very important here to structure the token in a healthy way and make sure basically you can raise money with it.
00:06:40.590 - 00:06:58.558, Speaker A: Amber at New Order and you personally have a lot of experience working with Defi founders. I mentioned earlier, you're an incubation Dao, you incubate your own projects, but you also work very closely with the Defi projects in the Defi base camp. So out of your experience, what do you think really makes a successful founder?
00:06:58.734 - 00:07:41.840, Speaker C: That's a good question. I think it might be very obvious to say, but I think a good Defi founder understand what makes sense in Defi and what doesn't make sense. I think just like in any other field of innovation, first a founder need to have a very deep understanding of the industry, which grants them unique insights. And those insights accumulate that will contribute to the development of new products. Sometimes I feel like in Defi or crypto, some founders are escaping some steps before venturing to a new product. So that's something you want to avoid. And I also think it's important to have a high conviction and a clear vision for whatever you're building.
00:07:41.840 - 00:08:17.900, Speaker C: The token price fluctuates in the short term gain state. It comes and goes. And as a founder, you are making a multi year commitment to building something. I know the cycle in crypto is a little bit shorter, but still, that's a significant portion of your life. So you want to make sure you're building something that brings long term value to the industry. And during your entrepreneurial journey, you'll probably encounter numerous challenges, some of which you never have even thought of. So having that unwavering conviction is going to prove valuable during those times.
00:08:18.910 - 00:08:40.450, Speaker A: On the same theme, talking about working with founders Kareem, when Defi projects come into the Defi base camp, oftentimes they have an existing token design, or they have a preconceived idea of what they think their token should look like or what it should do. Where do you think working with these projects that you as a token designer, provide them the most support and the most help.
00:08:40.600 - 00:09:30.546, Speaker B: Yeah. So very often founders, as you said, come in with already some preconceived notions of what they want the token to do or some ideas of mechanisms they want to use. And very often all this stuff is thought of without answering some of the more fundamental stuff. You got to answer first before even thinking about the token, such as, do I even need a token? Most of the time this answer is no. But in many cases it can be beneficial. Right? But if we do decide it is beneficial and or needed, then we can start thinking of the mechanisms and the specific things we want to incentivize, the specific things or behaviors we want users to engage with when using this product or this network. And then based on those needs, we can kind of structure the token design and figure out what the token should do as opposed to going straight into.
00:09:30.546 - 00:09:57.290, Speaker B: We want this kind of staking or this kind of whatever mechanism that people want to use. So the way I work with a lot of these founders is by pushing them back kind of to the first step and assuming we can answer all these fundamental questions that take us to the later stages, then thinking of the right mechanisms and the right parameters we can use to ensure the best kind of possible outcome.
00:09:57.790 - 00:10:11.120, Speaker A: So I have another question for yuki here. So yuki, I want to understand what originally motivated you to get involved in the DeFi space and why do you think Defi builders should build in this space?
00:10:11.570 - 00:12:00.930, Speaker B: I hold this belief that the defi will remain to be the king of the crypto space. So I think before web3 was a thing that was maybe one or two years ago, I think crypto has always been surrounded or centered around d five primitives. And I think part of it is also because of the selective values that the crypto asset itself provides to the broader, I guess, countries that need it. Like, for example, look at pesos and when the Ukraine things happen, Ukraine for the usage of bitcoins and ethereum as a store of values instead of their state currency, which is something that has driven up the adoptions of crypto and also have made people realize the value of crypto a lot more. And when you have something like that, defi, in my opinion, is a very natural extension of the use cases of crypto being the store of values. And that's why I believe that the broader adoption of crypto should happen with the adoption of crypto assets being a stateless currency and that follow on to that. Defi is an extension of usage of crypto being a status currency, where it can provide added financial products services that enables them to easily use crypto assets as again, a status currency.
00:12:01.670 - 00:12:24.826, Speaker A: So I have a question for all the panelists here at outer ventures, especially on the defi side as well. We constantly reiterate our thesis. We think about what are new trends, what are the things that we need to focus on. So for all my three panelists, the question I like to ask is, what do you think? Is there one specific topic that you want to focus on that you're really interested in? So maybe starting with Amber, I think.
00:12:24.848 - 00:13:12.006, Speaker C: There'S numerous innovation going on in the industry, but if I have to choose one today, I'm going to say decentralized validator technology DVT. But if you ask me another day, I'll probably give you a different answer. So I think DVT basically enhance the management for private keys for your stakers. So also brings peace of mind to stakers. If you are a stakeholder in estaking ecosystem, regardless, you're going to benefit from this technology. Either you're a liquid staking provider, or at home staker or no operator, you more or less like benefits. So it's not just a technological advancement, it's also bring immediate value to the ecosystem.
00:13:12.006 - 00:13:46.050, Speaker C: So that's what I like about it. I want to know, after Shanghai upgrade, we did see an increasing amount of staking activity. So I guess that's why it is my opinion that DVT is going to become more and more relevant in the future. And in terms of adoption, if you read into DVT, it's easy to understand relatively. It's not so esoteric like many other Defi concepts. So I'm pretty optimistic about its adoption as well.
00:13:46.200 - 00:13:50.280, Speaker A: Kareem, what about yourself? What's the one trend that you're focused on?
00:13:51.290 - 00:14:52.060, Speaker B: I think Amber put it very well when she said every day it could be a different thing because there's so much happening all the time. Although if I had to pick one, I'd say maybe kind of emerging trend of where people are kind of talking about and what looks like will happen is there will be kind of a marketplace for execution, where in the future I'll be able to express, maybe even in natural language, and an LLM will translate it into machine words. Some kind of arbitrary action I'd like to take. And maybe, I don't even know it's blockchain in the background, but say maybe I want to deposit collateral on this chain and withdraw, mint something on another chain against it, or blah, blah, blah, and basically, people compete behind the scenes to give you the best execution possible. This is all to do, I guess, with the MEV and transaction supply chain. But kind of the slow emergence of these marketplaces and the different design trade offs they're making is very interesting.
00:14:52.750 - 00:14:57.340, Speaker A: Yuki, last but not least, what's the one trend that you're focused on that you're excited about?
00:14:57.950 - 00:17:11.490, Speaker B: I'm looking forward to seeing how the auto book space is going to shape out in terms of like spot order book decks or some perp auto book decks. I mean, there are a lot of perp auto book decks, but oftentimes a lot of it's on off chains, off chain order books. And I'm also looking forward to seeing how people are working with off chain order books in a way that it's either verifiable, like running on some verifiable compute, or that if the infrastructure supports it, it could be run even fully on chain as well, which I believe would be the case for if someone is using something like, let's say like a fuel network, for example. Another aspect that I'm looking forward to seeing from the defi space is in general the optimization for the Amms, as in a lot of the amms, let's say unisop, like the Unison V three, for example, has had a lot of, I guess, loss to the arbitragers due to the price stalling issues, which is somewhat unavoidable given their model within the constraint of ethereum's like twelve second buck. So you always have time delay, which results in a price stalling that allows more, I guess, efficient arbitragers to extract MUV out of the price executions on chain versus let's say the off chain like centralized exchange. And that way they can essentially generate revenues that way. Now, I believe that MUV is not a bad thing, but I think it's something that could be minimized or something that can be bettered, such that one, it provides less loss for the lps, and then two, provides better transaction executions for the users.
00:17:11.490 - 00:17:42.640, Speaker B: And then even in that case, I believe there will be still mev, but perhaps not as much as what we see today. So I think there's still very big opportunities for people to either build on top of Uniswap V three via V four, or maybe just independent projects, but still a lot of opportunities and space for actually improving the user experiences and transaction execution on Univ. Three.
00:17:43.410 - 00:18:03.350, Speaker A: Thank you for joining us on our panel today. I hope you thought it's as insightful and interesting as I thought it was. I learned a lot, and I hope you did too. We have got some amazing projects coming up, so if you're interested to see the kind of companies that we work with on the DeFi basecamp that we're accelerating, then stay tuned for the trailers. Thank you and goodbye.
00:18:32.210 - 00:20:32.050, Speaker B: We are supporting the open metaverse by creating a financial infrastructure layer that not only improves capital efficiency for institutions across the entire investment lifecycle, but that provides institutional grade financial tooling for every single digital creator in the decentralized economy. If money is evil, then that building is hell. This is the most obnoxious group of money hungry, low iq, high energy, jackrabbit fucking wannabe, big time, small time, shit talking, bothersome, irritating bunch of motherfucker. The most memorable part of basecamp for me was the token flow diagram exercise. I remember the helpful feedback, the multitude of perspectives that surfaced, and the sense of improvement and evolution throughout the entire exercise. It was like watching our raw concept being chiseled into a practical, marketable idea right before our very eyes. This encapsulates the essence of basecamp for me, practical, transformative learning in a supportive and dynamic environment.
00:20:32.130 - 00:21:05.140, Speaker D: The Internet was intended to be a realm of free ideas and shared innovation. Today, that essence is in peril. Web three is a chance to return the Internet to the people, but centralized validation is putting its future at risk. Until now. Coaxion network will decentralize web3 by turning delegators into stakeholders. Through validator tokenization, we're developing a revolutionary protocol that will change the staking world forever. By giving validators the tools they need to thrive, rewarding delegators with a secondary token for their stake in real time.
00:21:05.140 - 00:21:33.590, Speaker D: Creating a decentralized network of tokenized validators, all uniting for the same cause. All done under the backdrop of our cutting edge app design. Co action will fundamentally change the delegator validator relationship forever. With co action, we are striving to revive the true essence of web3, where freedom isn't just an illusion, this isn't just a shift, it's co action.
00:21:52.210 - 00:24:01.370, Speaker B: Well, as users increasingly go online, we need to ensure that the little guy's voice is heard. We cannot have the same system that already exists where the highest bidder wins. What event Horizon lets you do is if you're voting, if you're participating, if you're informed, if you actually care about the future of governance, web3, d five, et cetera, you can have your voice heard with an outsized vote multiple. Nowhere else can you do that. Nowhere else can you talk in one place with everyone around the community and actually have your voice heard. That's what event Horizon lets you do. You it always had keen interest and curiosity for technology, having spent more than 15 years building portfolio management, risk and trading platforms during my time at Goldman Sachs and as the CTO of Helicop, prominent fintech startup here in Singapore.
00:24:01.370 - 00:24:23.170, Speaker B: During my time at Helicop, one of the issues that we have always been focused on was how do we enable financial inclusion at scale? And I believe blockchain and web3 has the power to solve this challenge in a very, very scalable and efficient way, by connecting crypto investors with sustainable yields backed by real world businesses. And that's exactly what led to the genesis of Felix.
00:24:27.190 - 00:25:31.690, Speaker E: Defi is on the verge of a major transformation. Faced with the scarcity of sustainable yields, crypto investors are actively pursuing alternative sources of stable returns. This has led to the emergence of tokenized real world assets RWA, which is poised to skyrocket to a $16 trillion market by 2030. But today's RWA protocols face significant challenges, hindering institutional adoption. Inadequate origination pipelines, poor credit risk assessments, liquidity constraints and regulatory hurdles limit their potential. Introducing Helix, the institutional grade RWA DFI platform designed to address these challenges head on. Founded by a team with an unmatched track record of over $200 million in loans originated with zero default, Helix brings unrivaled expertise to the table.
00:25:31.690 - 00:25:58.900, Speaker E: Leveraging its proprietary credit analytics platform, secondary marketplace, robust risk management and compliance framework, helix empowers crypto investors with stable yields while unlocking global liquidity for real world borrowers. Join us as we define the future of finance. Helix connecting DeFi to the real world.
00:26:19.550 - 00:27:06.070, Speaker B: We are changing the world for better, because we want to make blockchain technology, and especially Ethereum, to be more usable to the general public. I think so far, blockchain defi has been this kind of a niche thing that's not been publicly used. We don't think that should be the case. I think in our ideal world, everyone should be able to use it with ease. That includes me, my parents, my grandparents. In the beginning, there was a body language, a nod, a gesture, a glance, our first language, our first form of communication. Then came the spoken word, a symphony of sounds, giving shapes to our thoughts, our dreams, or stories.
00:27:06.070 - 00:27:37.886, Speaker B: Johannes Gutenberg then gave us the printing machine. Now, officially, thoughts became immortal. With the telephone, the distance became irrelevant. Then came the Internet, a digital discourse where ideas are exchanged freely, stored in databases that could last for centuries. And now, eventually, Ethereum, a machine that produces a canonical truth every 12 seconds, a marvelous achievement. But like the printing machine, it's not exactly designed for everyone to use. It's a bit like being illiterate during the middle ages.
00:27:37.886 - 00:28:45.536, Speaker B: If you cannot read the chain, you are left behind. We are here to change that, because that's the new language of the new world. It's the new literacy, and we believe everyone should be fluent. Remnasis is really for the open metaverse in two main ways. Firstly, we want to have ease of financial access to cryptocurrency. This means that you should not need to know specifically how wallets work, or you don't even need to learn about how to sign transactions in order to make a purchase or an event happen in the metaverse. This is where RAM houses really excels, because we want to make sure the most efficient way that you get access to your assets in the metaverse is through analysis.
00:28:45.536 - 00:29:04.344, Speaker B: And the second way is that we want to also allow you to have complete account abstraction. This means that logging in through analysis issues your wallet behind the scenes without you even worry about it. And this is what we really want to build and put forward.
00:29:04.382 - 00:29:41.508, Speaker F: For a lot of our users, enabling buying and selling of cryptocurrency on your website shouldn't be a daunting task.

00:30:38.460 - 00:31:11.890, Speaker B: The world is not perfect. It consists of a lot of unfairness and imperfection, and web free is our chance to correct part of that. It's not just about transforming the Internet into fair and open place. It's about building the backbone for the future of our society. A better, transparent, privacy focused, democratic and inclusive one. And this vision inspires thousands of different people across the globe to reshape what our tomorrow will look like. And I'm happy to be one of them.
00:31:43.860 - 00:32:08.400, Speaker C: Solution for your business token checkout to sell your tokens with Visa or Mastercard directly on your webpage, and NFT checkout to easily sell NFTs with credit cards or wallet creation to create wallets for end users if they don't have one n zero id to onboard end users instantly.
00:32:28.080 - 00:33:27.264, Speaker G: Blockchain is ushering in a new era of transparency and financial freedom, and is literally creating a new world order as we speak. And every chain is playing its own part in accelerating this change. Every chain offers users a unique experience and an ecosystem. So if you want users to be able to experience all of this freely, we need to allow for the free movement of assets between these multiple chains. Think of each chain as an individual country, a country with a unique culture, unique community, unique investment opportunities, unique employment opportunities. Now, had these opportunities within a particular country been available just to the natives of that particular country, would the world have grown this fast? I don't think I need to answer this for any one of you. The answer is no.
00:33:27.264 - 00:34:39.610, Speaker G: The only reason why the world has grown this fast is because we're all interconnected. It's because we are living in a collaborative environment. You have a person sitting in India who has access to opportunities in America, and vice versa, because a lot of folks in the US are now turning to the tech talent which is residing in India. So we're succeeding because of this collaborative framework. Now, that's exactly what Synthr is trying to do in the blockchain world. What globalization did, what this interconnected framework did for the world is what Synthr will do for the blockchain world by creating an interconnected and interoperable multi chain ecosystem, where no matter which ecosystem a user is residing on, he or she can access opportunities that are present in another ecosystem. And what we're essentially creating is, or what we're essentially facilitating, is the free movement of assets and users between each chain, which is not just a chain, but an ecosystem and a community.
00:34:44.060 - 00:35:48.884, Speaker H: It all began with simple ideas of security, transparency, and immutability to create a world where our assets are truly ours, free from any interventional control. A dynamic explosion of innovation, a new revolution in asset management, transfer of value, and financial freedom. But we keep striving for more, keep pushing the boundaries of possibility. The possibilities of not a hundred blockchains, or a thousand blockchains, but a million connected networks. And the freedom to move between these chains seamlessly. Synthr provides you with frictionless interoperability and slippage free omnichan liquidity, so you can access your own limitless excursions through endless worlds of curiosity, innovation, and freedom, highly solvent and interoperable synthetic assets, and perform zero slippage cross chain swaps with instant and guaranteed finality. The spirit of exploration awaits.
00:35:48.884 - 00:35:54.300, Speaker H: Step forward, for there's a world of endless possibilities to be discovered with Cynthia.
