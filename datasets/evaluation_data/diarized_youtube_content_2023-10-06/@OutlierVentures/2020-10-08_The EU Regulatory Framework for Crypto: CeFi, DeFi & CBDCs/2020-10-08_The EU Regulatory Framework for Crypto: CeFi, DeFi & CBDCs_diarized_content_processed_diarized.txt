00:00:10.170 - 00:00:49.986, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. So this is the second time that we're playing around with this format. This is going out live on both LinkedIn and Twitter, where we invite an expert or analyst in crypto to join us and deep dive either into a thesis, thesis, or a new topical area. So today we've got a really good friend of outlier Ventures, Philip Sadner, professor, lecturer at Frankfurt Business School. He set up the blockchain center there. He's also an author, an investor in crypto himself. Philip is one of our go to people to make sense of what's going on in policy and regulation, both globally and specifically into Europe.
00:00:49.986 - 00:01:56.754, Speaker A: He is a man with an inside track. So today we're going to be talking about quite a few things, but most specifically, Mika. This is a new proposal by the EU back in September that people have been wrestling with for the last month or so, which effectively is proposing a full regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Now, this is a proposal, so presumably for consultation, although we're going to get an understanding from Philip as to what stage this is and how people can engage with it. The European Commission has proposed legislation that will turn cryptocurrencies into a regulated financial instrument, dubbed the regulation on markets and crypto assets, hence the abbreviation mika. The bill will provide clarity on what constitutes a crypto asset, as well as the various definitions and categorizations of those, including subcategories. And I know this is an area that Philip's been working a lot to help inform, and we're going to talk about that a little bit later.
00:01:56.754 - 00:02:52.210, Speaker A: We'll also provide rules on digital asset custody, as well as capital requirements, while stipulating the relationship between a token issuer and a token holder. Of course, things that we all want to have greater clarity as innovators in the space. This framework will be applicable to all 27 member states, giving regulated crypto companies passport rights across the entire block. And if past Mika could turn the EU into the largest and most comprehensive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world. And so we're going to unpack whether that's net good, net bad for the industry and innovators. So this is really a major inflection point for the crypto industry. And as far as I know, many of the big players in this space do not yet have a concrete plan as to how to engage with this.
00:02:52.210 - 00:03:33.134, Speaker A: So I'm looking forward to making sense with Philip of this so quick background. Philip set up and head the Frankfurt Business School blockchain Center. He's also been a member of the Fintech council. Fintech Rat, unfortunate name, I guess, of the German Federal Ministry of Finance. He's a member of the EU Blockchain Observatory and forum working groups. He's chairman of ITSA, the International Token Standardization Association, a body that's been doing some great work to inform some of this policy set up back in 2018. He is a tireless devotee and advocate for crypto, both in Europe and globally.
00:03:33.134 - 00:03:43.842, Speaker A: And I'm really grateful that he's here doing what he's doing. So, Philip, there's a lot going on in crypto. Welcome to the show.
00:03:43.896 - 00:04:18.842, Speaker B: Firstly, thanks very much. Happy to be here and also happy to experiment with this technology. Doing this all live, that's really exciting. But let's directly jump into the topic from my side. I'm really trying to keep the overview on the following three domains. That's, of course, crypto, bitcoin, ethereum, then the digital euro, getting the euro on a blockchain system, and also digital securities, which is a looming topic in Germany. And it's quite difficult to keep the overview, but it's interesting to see that all these domains at some point of time will be driven by DLT and blockchain.
00:04:18.842 - 00:04:31.374, Speaker B: And I would also make the expectations that at some point of time you could say there will be no finance, there will be no capital market without blockchain, but it will take a while until this will become common sense. At this point of time, it's a hypothesis.
00:04:31.422 - 00:04:31.826, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:31.928 - 00:05:01.286, Speaker B: But let's now directly jump into the Mica regulation. So what has been doing now is basically that the European Commission has been pushed on the regulatory level to really get this sorted out. And then they started, I would guess so, 1.5 years ago. And it's got quite extensive framework, the Mika regulation itself. You can see it here on the slide. The Mika regulation itself concerns primarily crypto assets.
00:05:01.286 - 00:05:47.946, Speaker B: So crypto assets are a catch all category here. And this is distinguished from security tokens or digital securities. You see that these boxes are not overlapping. So you have with the Mika regime something which is now existing, and for an rising crypto asset category besides digital security, so it's not overlapping. That's an interesting point. And with this, crypto assets are not regulated by digital securities law, but they will get own laws for best price, execution, trading and so on. Just to give it a very quick examples, you see bitcoin and ethereum here on the catch all category on the left hand side, and traditional market capital formats such as bonds and shares on the right hand side.
00:05:47.946 - 00:06:07.922, Speaker B: Then we have e money. That's basically the euro on a blockchain, but it could also be the US dollar on a blockchain. This can be done on a blockchain system. That's the left hand side of the bar. And it can also be traditionally being done without blockchain. That's why it's basically partly overlapping with the outside white background. Right.
00:06:07.922 - 00:06:55.362, Speaker B: And within the emoney tokens, there will be the so called EMT tokens, emoney tokens. That would be the euro on a blockchain format, but also by issuers who have applied for the Emoney license. That's really a big and tough hurdle to do it. And for those who will not be able to and who do not want to apply for an emoney license, that would be so called asset reference tokens. Let's call it art tokens, right? This could be the US dollar coin for Emoney, potentially, once they're applying for the license or future existing euro equivalents. And the DAI most probably will become an art token because they will not be able to apply for an emoney license, as far as I know. But this can of course also change.
00:06:55.362 - 00:07:25.306, Speaker B: And within these categories you have subcategories which are called significant emoney tokens. Let's call it semt tokens. That would be probably the Libra tokenized euro bonds existing, of course. And there will be the Sartre tokens. That would be significant asset reference tokens as a subcategory on the lower half here, probably tether would fall in here and the, you know, like the basket would also fall in here. Why is tether on the lower half and not on the upper half? That's an assumption. Now please don't get me wrong here.
00:07:25.306 - 00:07:58.466, Speaker B: It's an assumption. The assumption is that tether will not want to apply for an IMaNI license in Europe. And maybe they even cannot for various reasons. That's why they would still potentially be an SARS token. And by the way, in case they would not get the license or the allowance by european regulatory bodies, then once the Mika regulation is in place, tether would be forbidden and prohibited in Europe. We come to this in a second. And then there will be of course the category of utility tokens.
00:07:58.466 - 00:08:21.600, Speaker B: I think this is pretty much well known. For example here as an example, the basic attention token, or for example the OKX platform tokens. That's it for this slide. And therefore, I would quickly like to mention some more views here. I think you have seen the slide, we don't need it now anymore. But it's interesting, I think, to just get these silos right.
00:08:23.010 - 00:08:41.730, Speaker A: So I was going to say, what do you think the intent is here? Clearly, this is, on the one hand, pretty comprehensive. On the other hand, there's still a lot of gray space. It's quite broad categorizations. But what do you think is the driving force and intent here by the EU?
00:08:42.150 - 00:09:14.798, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an excellent question, actually, because the crypto markets by now have a market capitalization fluctuating around $300 to $350,000,000,000. Right. This is not much when compared to the apple stock, which alone has 1.5 trillion, like apple alone is, I don't know, three, four times larger than the entire crypto market. That's just one company. So the crypto market still is quite small. And this is surprising, because what the European Commission did is not any random regulation like a paper here and there.
00:09:14.798 - 00:09:49.882, Speaker B: It's 170 pages of one line text written. It's endless to read, and it's difficult to read and to excel on this. That's not all. There will be multiple delegate acts in the foreseeable future detailing all kinds of stuff. So this will be hundreds of pages of law just for a quite small market of crypto assets. And then, of course, the question arises, would they like to close down, track down on these crypto assets of all kinds? Crypto assets from bitcoin over to libra over to euro are all regulated in ekai. It's a very broad thing.
00:09:49.882 - 00:10:31.986, Speaker B: And my expectation is actually, that's not a crackdown in any way. That's exactly the opposite. That's the proposal and the trial to create a solid fundament in terms of multiple silos, a solid fundament for future growth, because this regulation scheme will be a unified one for the entire European Union. That's more than 400 million citizens, which could be served by one and the same regulations once the company is complying with it. So, of course, it creates some hurdles. Not everybody will be able to jump over these hurdles. But if you can do it, then you will have a market of 400 million people, plus minus who you could target.
00:10:31.986 - 00:11:09.170, Speaker B: And the last word here on this is basically the fact that the question is key, when will this be enforced? And most probably, and the earliest probably date when this visa regulation comes into force will be end of 2022. But it's also probable that it takes one year longer than it would be 2023. Up until then, companies can prepare. Up until then, Tesla would be allowed in Europe and so on. But from that date on, you have to really decide in case you would like to serve european customers, then you would have to comply with ease. Silo.
00:11:09.670 - 00:11:42.094, Speaker A: So from your perspective, is it that they're trying to prohibit, contain, or enable innovation, or kind of a mixture of both? Because as you know, comparatively, this is a relatively small capital market, but presumably they're looking at the innovations in a more long term perspective. And does the EU think that they need to act ahead of other markets because it gives them some kind of competitive edge as an economic block? What's the thinking there?
00:11:42.212 - 00:11:53.914, Speaker B: Yeah, that's also a good question. It's difficult to answer, actually. I can only speculate here. There has not been presented. Okay, there have been presented some arguments, but you never know what's happening behind the scenes.
00:11:53.962 - 00:11:54.414, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:54.532 - 00:12:57.074, Speaker B: When I first read the mika, and actually I didn't read 170 pages, I picked out 50 or 60. When I read the regulation first, I was disappointed because I felt, now they are creating silos, but we know the crypto asset space, there are no silos, so to say, everybody's doing new kinds of formats and so on. And I was also previously inspired by the Liechtenstein Token act, which is basically having an entire different spirit of tokenizing any right out there. Right. But of course, Europe is a huge continent with many countries politically extremely complex. You know it. And therefore, I think it's a good approach to create large silos for large potential projects and to root these innovative, creative projects in these silos such that I would expect that these silos, which I have just presented, they would cover maybe 90% of the market in the next five years.
00:12:57.074 - 00:13:32.510, Speaker B: Something like this. And the other 10% are the catch all categories, by the way, DFI, decentralized finance is difficult to bring it into the mika. I would expect that this is the catch all category of crypto assets, because it's interesting to see that the European Commission many, many times writes issuer. And we all know that decentralized finance should have no issuer or do not want to have issuer. So it's not entirely clear how to put the defi instruments, which are also strongly growing in the Mika regime. But in any case, it will probably be the catch all category.
00:13:32.930 - 00:14:16.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting if you look at mean, they have no choice other than to look at it as the edge case. They kind of regulate what becomes established norms where they want to kind of enhance or prohibit. And then presumably there will be this process which will kind of onboard new innovations over a certain period of time, but with a kind of a softer, lighter guidance. And it's interesting you mentioned the Lichtenstein Token act beginning part of this year. I mean, 2020 has been a big year for crypto regulation. So as you say, Lichtenstein token Act, a legal framework for tokenization, which is now already enforced. I believe you now have Mika, which came out in September, just this week.
00:14:16.800 - 00:15:06.926, Speaker A: In the beginning of October, we had the UK crypto derivatives ban, which we're all trying to catch up with. And then in parallel, you've got chairman, the SEC chairman Clayton, saying all stocks could become tokenized whilst the CFTC is charging BitMex. So I mean, there's just so much going on. On the one hand, lots of reasons to be bullish, on the other hand, lots of things to kind of navigate. So where is Mika in the process of regulation? So is it policy yet? Is it a draft for consultation? Is it already pretty involved? How can the crypto industry engage with it? Or do you think it's already got a momentum now and we just have to see what comes out the other end?
00:15:07.108 - 00:15:43.622, Speaker B: That's a good question. So probably the European Commission started to draft this one year ago, and it took them quite some time to create multiple surveys for asking the public with surveys what should be in the mika and whatnot and so on. And then they proposed now the first version of it now. And given the time that they started to draft it, probably one year ago. At that time there was no defi yet on a large scale. So that's not astonishing that it's not perfectly included yet because the market developed so extremely quickly. I think we need to have an important point as follows.
00:15:43.622 - 00:16:37.494, Speaker B: Crypto enthusiasts and technologically skilled people, they can do self custody now and in the future. That's, for example, self storing the bitcoin and other things. But in case we all want this crypto ecosystem to grow, we cannot expect our neighbors, our parents, our friends, everybody to do self custody because they might not have the technological knowledge to do it and maybe they don't want it. So you have to have trusted institutions, which could also be banks and exchanges and others who are caring about assets of those people who just don't want or cannot take care of their assets. And for these people, you have to have regulations because companies, exchanges, they have to comply with this regulation. And then friends, parents, all these guys out there who we want to join then can join. Right? And therefore, I think this is the right perspective on this regulation.
00:16:37.494 - 00:17:14.594, Speaker B: And luckily in Europe we see this developing quite nicely because we see governments really trying to create a solid fundament, of course, ruling out some crazy projects which we do not want to have, and of course trying to get rid of fraudulent icos. But in all, they are trying to create some routes for innovation in the future. And if companies and issuers are trying to tap into these routes, then the benefit is basically an opened up market with trusted agents of 400 plus million people living in the EU.
00:17:14.642 - 00:17:14.806, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:14.828 - 00:17:23.420, Speaker B: So therefore, I think we should view it positive at this point of time in case we would really like to want this market to grow.
00:17:23.870 - 00:18:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, I guess one way of looking at it is in the more decentralized end of crypto Defi, where there is self custody and these various things, and there's a natural technical barrier to participation that naturally contains it. That's not something that they can directly regulate beyond general rules and making sure malpractice doesn't happen. But as innovations that happen in this permissionless sandbox that is DeFi begin to want to mainstream, they're going to have to go through gateways or bridges into either retail or institutional users. And therefore this brings some order or some rules, a process through which companies can begin to begin those trusted intermediaries and participants, and that's ultimately where we're going to get growth, both at the institutional and retail end. So, I mean, it sounds like you feel that this is net positive, and do you think that this has been, as you said, it's probably been in process for at least a year. I mean, you are somebody that's directly participated in various working groups, which I would assume have at least in part informed this.
00:18:38.514 - 00:18:48.600, Speaker A: Do you think that the global context of what's happening with central backed digital currencies in China is also an accelerant for the EU driving this forward?
00:18:48.970 - 00:19:12.542, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess so. As you proposed, I would agree we should view it net positive. Of course there are rules in the mika where you say, so they should have done this differently and so on. Of course, there's always the stuff with laws, but I think it's even better to have some laws which you are not perfectly compliant with. It's all better than uncertainty of a government who is doing simply nothing.
00:19:12.596 - 00:19:13.054, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:13.172 - 00:19:51.162, Speaker B: And also, I guess most of the viewers know the stock to flow theory on bitcoin. I actually like and appreciate this theory quite much, but very often it's not truly explained. Why should the price exactly rise? The price is a result of supply and demand, and the price will only increase in case there is excess demand in the market. Right. So there needs to be money flowing into the system. And then we have to ask, where should this money be coming from? Is it professional investors, is it retail investors? And so on. And that's exactly the point where I think regulation at some point of time is required to have more money flowing into this entire crypto market.
00:19:51.162 - 00:20:22.658, Speaker B: So it will be absolutely exciting times. And yes, also to your question, Jamie, the Chinese are really pushing this. This started, I think, approximately one year ago when the president holds a speech where bitcoin jumped by 10% overnight. Maybe some of you remember this. This was really crazy. And since then, they have been really pushing their digital currency version of the remimbi. And by now they have experiments being in place with 40 million people where they are trying how these transactions work.
00:20:22.658 - 00:20:46.070, Speaker B: And yesterday I read an article where they can say that transaction volume for their chinese version of their CBDC has exceeded 160,000,000 transaction volume. That's not much in comparison to what tether is doing day by day. Right? But it's, of course, still much more than any other government in the world exploring central bank issued currencies.
00:20:46.150 - 00:20:46.490, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:46.560 - 00:21:23.234, Speaker B: So for example, ECB is exploring this topic in the US also. Many central banks are exploring it, but China is probably, I would expect it to be six to eight years ahead on government or central bank issued. Government is wrong on central bank issued currencies. And maybe I also show one slide on what's happening here. But this is not crypto, right? This is now enterprise domain. It's a little bit different, but I will quickly show what's happening here. So what you see here is basically how payment works now since years, maybe sometimes decades.
00:21:23.234 - 00:22:07.234, Speaker B: You know these stories about 40 year old systems being in place in the financial markets, right? So that's CPAR technologies, target two and tips. That's the technologies in place for transferring, for example, my rent to department owner. Right? Then you can see that money is now running in accounts, in bank accounts. That's not a technical term, that's a bank term. So it's a bank account. What is meant here? And then on the right hand side as a monetary unit, you see here that this is, for example, the euro could be the pound or anything else, how things are working. Then people have invented the smart contract, and suddenly you have something like a smart contract execution system, let's call it smart contract, which you would like to use.
00:22:07.234 - 00:22:43.306, Speaker B: And then people found out that it's extremely difficult to get the euro in these smart contracts because only then you can do interest payments, loans and all kinds of things. You first have to have the euro, not a stable coin by the way. You have to have the euro like a licensed currency or the pound or the US dollar. You have to have this on the chain to then execute smart contracts. That's why now, and that's the short term solution. That's exactly why some banks in Germany and I think probably also in Europe, are now creating some kind of bridge or trigger solution to use smart contracts which are then triggering the legacy route of payments.
00:22:43.338 - 00:22:43.534, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:43.572 - 00:23:13.930, Speaker B: That's the dotted line here. And this will come probably next year. But it's not the ultimate game here because the ultimate game would be to have to euro on a DLT network. And that's what I would like to quickly show here, because smart contract systems would allow programmable payments. That's basically everything which is done in the Defi ecosystem with smart contracts, but with a license currency, so to say. Right. And in the future you will then have that.
00:23:13.930 - 00:23:58.546, Speaker B: Basically the digital payment infrastructure could also run on a blockchain technology. Then you would also be able to have programmable money. This would be configurations of money such that money, for example, cannot travel everywhere, money cannot travel in sanctioned countries, money cannot travel to AML listed people, and so on. This would be the second function. If you do this, then you could plug the money into tokens, right? And then you would have the possibility to do atomic swaps. That's basically trading or delivery versus payment. This is what we all dream of, basically real time settlements of assets with real currencies based on smart contracts.
00:23:58.546 - 00:24:50.438, Speaker B: But it requires, at least in the enterprise world, like Bosch, Daimler, Siemens, these companies, they require the euro on a blockchain. They cannot deal with ether or any other cryptocurrency. And this is now the state of the art. You can of course put tokens, you can of course put fiat currencies in the euro, and of course you could put new kinds of asset into tokens. And that's basically where the goal is for the next, say five to ten years. And here you see the upper route is currently being explored by banks and the lower route is currently being existing as concepts, right? In China they are a little bit more advanced here, but in Europe, the lower route is at least with the euro inside a smart contract. This is not being finished yet that's existing as concepts.
00:24:50.438 - 00:25:23.822, Speaker B: But we see quite some movement that in the next years the lower route will also be realized by european financial organizations with the goal to, for example, serve machines from Bosch, Daimler, Siemens and all these industrial companies to be able to transact in euro, not a stable coin, but in euro. That's basically the goal, but it will take a couple of years. I think that's it with this slide. I hope it worked kind of nicely and I hope this was fine.
00:25:23.956 - 00:25:49.930, Speaker A: That was really useful. So how do you see these two worlds interacting? Sort of base level? Could Dai of Makerdao become collateral in something that happens at the kind of central government backed level and vice versa? Could a CBD, a digital euro or digital renimbi become collateral in Makerdao? How do you see these two worlds interacting?
00:25:51.470 - 00:26:59.678, Speaker B: That's a difficult question actually, Jamie, but I think that when we talk about crypto defi, including Tesla, right, bitcoin, Ethereum and so on, this is something at this point of time for individuals, startups and so on. But on a worldwide level, everybody on the entire world is interacting with these systems. For example, you have a programmer in South Korea or in the UK or in Japan and they all interact with one system. That's for example Ethereum, right? Or not a system. And then there is the existing world of B. Two B, that's companies producing machinery, sensors, trains, airplanes, everything which our societies needs, right? And these are large scale companies out there with 10,000 hundred thousands of employees who are producing all kinds of industrial goods, right? And they of course need to comply to any law outside, you could also call them legacy organizations and so on. And in their world they do want to do blockchain stuff, of course, but they require the euro and they do not require any kind of stable coin or makerdao like a die.
00:26:59.678 - 00:27:49.586, Speaker B: They want to have the licensed euro, so to say the regulated euro, mainly for accounting reasons, because this needs to be somehow go into their bookkeeping records and their annual statements because it's required by law, simply. And that's exactly why I think these two worlds are both developing nicely. They also have intersections with each other. Of course, one intersection is Ethereum because we could also run the euro on Ethereum at some point of time. This should be possible. They have intersections, but still it's also two domains which are having own rules. And therefore I think it's developing both nicely and I think the interactions between both worlds will increasingly be visible and will be interwoven, but it will take a couple of years.
00:27:49.586 - 00:28:09.640, Speaker B: And of course the crypto segment, including DFI, bitcoin, Ethereum and so on, many startups on an international level, the crypto ecosystem evolves much more dynamically than the industrial segment. But the industrial segment is much larger with hundreds, thousands of employees working there.
00:28:10.330 - 00:28:43.246, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess what's going to be interesting, we're an outlier in the process of developing our kind of d five 2.0 thesis. On the one hand, you have retail, on the other hand, you have bringing more institutions in institutions as a spectrum from a professional trader into a large financial institution organization. And one of the things that I think is really clear for DeFi to evolve is the collateral in. It has to be more than just crypto as it is today. Cryptocurrencies. It has to begin to have income bearing instruments.
00:28:43.246 - 00:29:31.902, Speaker A: It has to have real world assets like real estate for it to grow and to become more interesting to a wider group of institutional organizations. And I think generally, and I don't know if you would agree with this, I've been in space for quite a while, as have you. We're both based in Europe. Hopefully I'm still categorized as european. I don't know, being a, you know, the EU generally has got pretty good form to date, right? It has been pretty patient compared to a lot of other regulators, both in terms of how it's acted, how it's communicated responsibly into the market. I've had Piteris Zilgavis on many times. I had him on the podcast recently, the founders of web3 podcast, and he has consistently said, look, we are pro innovation.
00:29:31.902 - 00:30:23.458, Speaker A: We want to see how the market plays out. And I think the fact that they've waited, they've consulted, and they've given a reasonable time for industry to act. As you said, it's going to be a few years before this becomes law. It's given time for industry to adapt. I guess the one concern is just the rate of innovation that happens. If you look at how GDPR, which is only really fully coming into force in the last year or two around data, it almost kind of doesn't account for the innovation of blockchain, which has been around for ten years. So how can these new regulations accommodate for the crazy world of food protocols or meme coins in DFI? So, Philip, it's been wonderful having you on the show.
00:30:23.458 - 00:30:37.640, Speaker A: I know you've really helped. Certainly me and many others understand and navigate this space. Where can people find you? How can they follow you? And more importantly, how can they engage and support a lot of the advocacy work that you're doing?
00:30:38.110 - 00:31:00.014, Speaker B: That's also a nice question. Thanks. So LinkedIn, Twitter, Google works also quite well. Just put in my name and I think I'm trying to also keep up with these many domains, regulation and so on. So follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. You can also write me. I try to answer any email if somehow possible, and therefore happy to help.
00:31:00.014 - 00:31:08.770, Speaker B: And happy to help, basically somehow growing this ecosystem. But it will take some more years and will be exciting decades ahead. Honestly.
00:31:09.350 - 00:31:32.226, Speaker A: Great. Thanks so much for joining us, Philip. So, just a quick plug. We are the world's leading web3 accelerator. We're actually recruiting for our winter cohort right now. We've been investing in crypto and now DFI for over several years. We've got a really good appreciation for the regulatory landscape.
00:31:32.226 - 00:32:38.060, Speaker A: We've got in house securities lawyers. We actively engage with a number of regulatory working groups, including Wall Street, Blockchain, Alliance, Digital Chamber of Commerce, all in the US, various working groups within the UK parliament, and of course within the EU. We've got great people like Philip in our network that help startups and innovators understand and navigate this very complex, fast moving environment. So if you are working in crypto and Defi, and especially in looking at how we can bring in more institutions into the space with DeFi as it is today, insurance, new forms of collateral, stablecoins and what have you, please do get in touch and apply at outliventures IO slash basecamp.
