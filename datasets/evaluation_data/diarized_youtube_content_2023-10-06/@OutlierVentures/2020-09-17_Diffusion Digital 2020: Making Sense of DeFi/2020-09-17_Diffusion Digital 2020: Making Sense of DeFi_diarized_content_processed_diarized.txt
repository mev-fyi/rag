00:00:10.250 - 00:00:39.260, Speaker A: Defi is considered the foundational crypto powerhouse today that is driving the sector's growth. And at the surface, the numbers just go up these days. It's incredible. So beginning of July, according to Defi House, there were 1.8 billion us dollar locked in Defi, and this was skyrocketing to 8.7 billion us dollar as of today, or rather as of yesterday. So please check the numbers again, it might be even higher.
00:00:39.260 - 00:01:16.458, Speaker A: And in the news this reads like the recent crypto rally shows global investors and traders are rushing into digital coins. However, if you look behind the hype, this common defi metrics tell a much more nuanced story. And I'd like to discuss this today with Czech Purdy, research analyst at Missari. Hello. And Andrew Kung, managing partner at Mechanism Capital. And I'm Angela Kreitenweis, I'm co founder of the Token Engineering Community. And by the way, we are offering courses at our token engineering academy.
00:01:16.458 - 00:01:32.490, Speaker A: If you're interested, check out tokenengineering.org. We have a new course starting in October and the application deadline is Thursday. So check it out today. Tokenengineering.org all right, let's start with our panel. Hi Jack. Hi Andrew.
00:01:32.490 - 00:02:08.040, Speaker A: Hello. We have been discussing several metrics prior to this panel, and let's directly jump in and review our first metric and see what's behind the numbers in a way market cap. So we prepared some slides. Let me make sure that I can idle share them. I think you should be able to see them. Yeah, there we go. Market cap is calculated first.
00:02:08.040 - 00:02:43.810, Speaker A: Token supply times current price and the token supply is the number of tokens. Sounds simple. And the current price is normally given in us dollar. Market cap is usually. Here we have a typical dashboard. Market cap is usually taken to measure the relative size of a cryptocurrency or token, or in order to compare tokens and projects. And usually it's like the higher the market cap, the more relevant a token and associated protocol.
00:02:43.810 - 00:03:41.250, Speaker A: And here we should have a first look at the two factors in this equation, price and token supply. Of course, whenever a metric is defined by price, you have to take into account that big price swings that are driven by demand are not necessarily caused by project's great achievements. And on the other hand, we have token supply here. And token supply is despite the fact that we have a distributed ledger, encrypted, sometimes sophisticated to measure. And here I'd like to get you check. If you look at different platforms, you'll find different specifications, how token supply is measured and at Missari, you differentiate. And maybe let's check out what's the specific definition of supply you use and think is relevant.
00:03:42.550 - 00:04:53.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so thanks for that intro to market cap. It's interesting because it is one of the most widely used metrics, but we oftentimes see it misused because people try to have their conceptual framework of market cap in the traditional financial world and port it into crypto. But there's a lot more nuances, particularly around token supply. And so the way we think about it in sari is there's really three different tranches you can think where you have the overall outstanding supply, which is every token that could ever be in existence. And so that's what gives the commonee is fully diluted market cap. But oftentimes there's a lot more to the story because the tokens can be locked for an extended period of time, in which case they're taken out of circulation and may not be as relevant to assess the general value of network. So a step below outstanding, we look at what's called liquid market cap or liquid supply, and that is the overall outstanding token supply.
00:04:53.942 - 00:05:44.698, Speaker B: But then you take out any tokens that are encumbered by either legal or smart contracts. So that's just a typical vesting schedule. And that could be from the early team advisors investors, because those tokens really cannot be accessed unequivocally. And that's obviously relevant. But there's also the situation where tokens could be held by a token team's treasury, but not necessarily under some stringent vesting schedule. And so then a step below liquid supply is what is circulating, which you can think of as the amount of tokens in float that are actively trading. And so circulating supply, that gives a good proxy of the value right now.
00:05:44.698 - 00:05:54.000, Speaker B: And it can be relevant to look at the liquid supply versus circulating supply to see how many tokens could theoretically be dumped on the market at any given time.
00:06:00.440 - 00:06:18.350, Speaker A: Before when preparing this panel, we talked about XRP ripple, because there we have a very specific, let's say, difference between circulating and liquid supply. Right. Maybe you can elaborate on that example a little bit.
00:06:19.280 - 00:07:19.710, Speaker B: Yeah, so they're kind of a unique case where the company itself, they hold a very large percent of the supply and have arbitrary release schedule for it. So if you were to hype that we want to invest in XRP, that's a very relevant metric to look at, because again, at any point in time, the foundation can decide to just sell on the open market. All of this, as you can see, supply that they have and there's that weird little dropout in 2018 because they recognized this and thought this kind of makes the market uneasy knowing that there's 75 billion just held in the treasury. So, okay, let's actually put it under some sort of vesting schedule and then gradually release it over time to kind of assuage the market's fears around that.
00:07:33.500 - 00:08:28.920, Speaker A: Billions from 100 billions at the very beginning. And in case they would sell to the market, the market cap would change dramatically. And of course this would have a substantial negative price impact. All right, so this is why it is so important to not only look at the market cap with let's say a general token supply, but digest liquid supply, circulating supply, and understand how this makes a difference for particular protocols. Because again, this is XRP is an entirely different case compared to other protocols. And every single protocol has different vesting schemes, has different lockup schemes, and this all needs to be taken into account to rate a market cap, let's say, appropriately.
00:08:31.340 - 00:09:04.790, Speaker B: And I think one more thing I think is important. When you are deciding what market cap to use to evaluate a network, you really have to align the time frame with your investment horizon, right? If I'm looking to purchase a token and think it's going to bump in six months, then I don't really care about tokens that are vesting seven years from now, right? Because I know that's not going to be released on the market then. But if you're looking over a wider time frame, it might make sense to look at.
00:09:08.040 - 00:10:09.390, Speaker A: Yeah, true. Very important metric today. Token value locked TvL this TvL is calculated by tokens locked times current price. And the tokens locked is the total token balance held by a smart contract. This is at least how it's specified at token terminal. And they are distributing this prominent or no, it's Defi pulse. This token value locked at the moment and current price again is defined in us dollar and token value locked is certainly the metric at the moment to prove traction of the defi sector overall of a particular platform, to prove product market fit also trust or greed.
00:10:09.390 - 00:11:10.978, Speaker A: But a spike in token value locked again doesn't necessarily mean that there are new users or fresh capital entering the system. And here we have a nice example. It's from a study of DAP radar and they examined the token value locked at Makerdao for ETH. And I guess this is an interesting chart because ETH accounts for 73% of the total value locked on Makerdao. And in blue you see the token value locked based on the actual us dollar price of ETH. And in pink, this is an inflation adjusted us dollar price, excluding the pure price increase of ETH in this timeframe. And apparently the ETH price has a significant impact because the purple curve is not that exciting, I'd say.
00:11:10.978 - 00:11:31.340, Speaker A: So if looking at the inflation adjusted total value locked, the increase is six times slower. So, to sum up, price has a big impact on total value locked. So if you look at total token value locked, check, is there anything else you typically take into account?
00:11:32.910 - 00:12:23.194, Speaker B: Yes, I think the big thing to look at is, especially when you're looking at a particular protocol, is knowing what to benchmark it against. Right. Or being able to take into account pure changes in the price. Right? Yeah. So with something like maker, where if the price of eth doubles, and that's the main form of collateral system, if you look purely at a USD TVL, then it's going to appear that, oh, the TVL double double. And when people use that as a gauge of general adoption or new capital flowing in, you can kind of be misled there. I think another big factor taking account is the actual realizable value in the system.
00:12:23.194 - 00:13:19.690, Speaker B: So if you look at something like synthetics, they have their own native token used as collateral in the system. So when they measure tbl, it's all which can be. Don't know exactly the numbers now, but like in the nine figures, but it's a very large percentage of the total SNX supply that's locked up. So if you think about it, the realizable value in synthetics, if that were to hypothetically be sold, it would be at a fraction of what the price times total amount in the system are. So there are nuances that need to be taken account as opposed to thinking like, oh, okay, now that there's 800 million in the system, that's how valuable or how much value can be extracted from this. If you're then looking to value the token from some derivative metric.
00:13:20.990 - 00:13:53.720, Speaker A: Totally. And I think there's another aspect, which is the accounting. So here's the circulating supply of dye versus dilocked on compound CDI. And there we can see that the number of die locked in compound is way higher than in maker die, and perhaps. Check. So there's an accounting effect of token value locked, which is often overseen, I guess.
00:13:57.930 - 00:14:49.640, Speaker B: Yeah. And so I remember right when the compound farming really got picked up in full force. When you look at the amount of CDI outstanding, and it's kind of like a head scratcher that, oh, this is more than the total dye outstanding. Like, how can that happen? And again, yeah, this kind of has to do with weird accounting tricks where I can deposit $100 worth of die, but then actually use that as collateral and borrow some more die and then lend that out. And it's just this cycle of rehypothecation. So it can lead to the number being inflated. And I think a lot of people, their gut reaction was to kind of jump on that and be like, oh, this is like a fractional reserve banking system.
00:14:49.640 - 00:15:29.030, Speaker B: This is super risky and whatnot. Which isn't really the case because every time I'm borrowing, I'm still actually depositing more in value than I'm borrowing. So it's like, yeah, I'm opening myself up to more leverage, more risk, but the system as a whole is still safe. But from a TVL perspective, it's important to really take that no count and recognize that yes, dye is being used in a system like compound, but there's not a billion dollars of value really in compound.
00:15:30.170 - 00:16:33.130, Speaker A: And again, the token value locked is referring to the locked tokens. And this doesn't equal the original numbers of, in this case die. This is a different way of counting it. And we will come back to this when we discuss later liquidity mining and liquidity wars. Because this relationship to you can lock a token and you can relock tokens and then kind of increase and pump the number of tokens locked is also a reason that can, or a challenge, let's say, for the protocols once we have this composabilities. Okay, we'll come back to that in a minute. And here's another popular metric, or increasingly popular metric, I'd say, for DeFi, which is revenues.
00:16:33.130 - 00:17:22.220, Speaker A: Revenues are calculated. Now this is token terminal by the take rate and GMv. The take rate is the fee charged as a percentage, and the GMV is the total value of transactions for which the protocol charges a fee, its gross merchandise value. And this is again, or this should offer insights into the fundamental value of governance tokens and to the growth potential of a platform. In a way, more earnings equals more sustainable growth and user traction on the surface. But first, I guess we have to acknowledge that revenue is not equal to Token holder revenue check, right?
00:17:23.710 - 00:18:42.290, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that when people hear protocol revenue and you see maybe something like balancer has half a million dollars in 24 hours revenue, revenue that leads people to be fine, like, oh, then the bell token has rights to that revenue, but not really, right? Because the implicit assumption is that token holders will be able to vote in some kind of value capture. But that's still kind of up in the air, like sushi swap, in contrast, they're taking five bits of that revenue. So, okay, then you can say derive some value for the sushi token. But we're still kind of like in the very early stages where we don't actually know if the lps will be okay with five bits being siphoned off to token holders. And once liquidity mining stops, like, oh, maybe they go to uniswap because they're getting 30 bits. And so that gross margin percentage is really going to be crucial to assess to see how much of this revenue can actually be extracted to token holders.
00:18:42.870 - 00:19:29.342, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think in long term it's even more complicated because any kind of distribution to token holders or liquidity providers is up to governance, and this might change over time. And so just looking at the total revenues doesn't tell that much on what you can expect as a token holder. All right, wait. Yeah. Long term distribution of revenues to token holders is up to governance and hard to predict. And there's another important difference discussing revenues, which is revenues are not equal to token holder revenues, and those are not equal to yield.
00:19:29.342 - 00:19:41.270, Speaker A: And perhaps here we should first take a look at what is yield actually, maybe. Andrew, please explain briefly.
00:19:43.530 - 00:20:40.818, Speaker C: Sure. So when I think about yield, I usually think about essentially the revenue that I'm generating through a protocol divided by the total amount of assets that I'm putting into generating that yield. And so yield can come in a lot of different forms, and it really is represented by the sum of all of those yield sources. And so if we look at one particular example, one example could be yield farming in curve, right? And if you yield farm in curve, you have to deposit stable coins into YCRV. And then you put the YCRV into a gauss. And that generates yield in the form of CRV incentives. It generates yield in terms of transaction fees of people that are trading through the Y CRV pool, and also generates yield in terms of the underlying stablecoins being lent out.
00:20:40.818 - 00:20:49.420, Speaker C: And so they all have their own respective yield revenue streams. And kind of those all summed up encompass the total yield that you're looking at.
00:20:52.800 - 00:22:00.372, Speaker A: Let's say, claiming that liquidity mining related to yield farming is this new thing, this key innovation in the Defi sector, where users specifically get not only when locking a specific token on a platform, they earn a governance token like sushi or comp paid in exchange for locking of a pool token. And the more assets one would contribute to the pool, the more governance token that user would be able to claim. And this is a very useful structure to bootstrap, theoretically any platform with a network effect. So any sort of business model, also non defi business models. Okay, so this is liquidity mining. Now this liquidity mining has challenges because it's just, I think we can take the Uniswap example and the fact that Uniswap is not distributing revenues via a governance token. Right.
00:22:00.372 - 00:22:01.140, Speaker A: Andrew?
00:22:02.120 - 00:22:16.410, Speaker C: They're not currently, but there are other projects which want to incentivize liquidity of their own tokens. And so they will incentivize liquidity providers on you as well. And that's led to some of the growth that we've seen over the past year.
00:22:19.660 - 00:22:45.680, Speaker A: And let's maybe also referring to liquidity worth, take the example of die locked on compound again. So there in July 2020, compound changed its comp distribution plan, which made locking Dai on compound much more attractive. And as a result, this caused challenges for makerdao. What was it again, Andrew?
00:22:46.900 - 00:23:30.208, Speaker C: Right. So the way that they designed the incentive program for compound was that it led to recursively lending and borrowing dye on compound being a showing point in terms of maximizing your yield. Farming on compound, a lot of people just ended up borrowing dye, putting it back in and then borrowing and putting it back in. And it led to also a lot of people just buying dye in the first place. Right. And so whenever Dai is bought, there's positive price pressure on the die peg. So dai is supposed to be trading at one to one with us dollar, but started trading at 1.11.41.
00:23:30.208 - 00:24:11.800, Speaker C: .5 and you had positive price pressure both from that. And then you also had positive price pressure from other speculators that were speculating on the peg breaking. So other funds or independent traders. And so that's kind of what led to die running into a situation where they didn't have very many leverage points to take die back to the peg of one point. Besides doing some stuff like quantitative easing like minting a large amount of dye or. Sorry, yeah, dye from an unpeked source or uncolorized source.
00:24:11.800 - 00:24:15.870, Speaker C: So there are some interesting discussions around that. Within the past two months.
00:24:20.500 - 00:25:11.650, Speaker A: At some point in July, they were really discussing an emergency shutdown. This wasn't necessary and there should be other measures, but basically the reason was just that it became more profitable to lock dye and farm compound than supply dye to the markets by selling them, for example. All right. And there could be an even more extreme effect due to yields created by locking tokens, which you called the liquidity black hole. Andrew in a tweet storm just recently, maybe to sum up this conversation, what do you mean by liquidity black hole? What's the challenge here?
00:25:12.660 - 00:26:29.320, Speaker C: Yeah, so the liquidity black hole kind of derives from this concept that liquidity begets even more liquidity, and that there are very strong network effects that come into play once you reach a threshold of liquidity. And with all of these incentives that are going into these decentralized exchanges and decentralized money markets, the idea is that a lot of the liquidity that is created will essentially create a black hole of liquidity, sucking in even more liquidity. And to understand this, you really need to drive down into kind of the second order and third order effects of liquidity, which is, say, you look at balancer, for example, which incentivize people to provide liquidity on balancer, lock up their assets into certain liquidity pools. What happens there is people are able to trade on balancer for less slippage because there are more essentially market makers on both ends. And that leads to more people trading on balancer, which generates more trading fees to the balancer liquidity providers. And because these liquidity providers are more profitable, then more people are going to start providing liquidity. And then your spreads get tighter.
00:26:29.320 - 00:27:01.212, Speaker C: Traders have less flippage, and then incentivizes larger and larger traders to come in. And it kind of works in this very cyclical cycle or recursive cycle. And that's kind of what we saw with centralized exchanges. Right. The centralized exchanges that are able to generate a lot of liquidity, they become even stronger and stronger. And the ones that have trouble generating liquidity on their platform are the ones that get weaker and weaker. And it's just because of the fact that market makers, they have a cost of capital, they have opportunity costs.
00:27:01.212 - 00:27:10.900, Speaker C: So they're always going to go towards where trading volume is. So if you don't have trading volume, it's going to be hard to get liquidity. But if you do have it, then it could be a positive feedback loop.
00:27:12.680 - 00:27:57.350, Speaker A: Yes. We are not, let's say there are many more metrics to explore to better understand what's going on in Defi. I think at the moment we have a lot of metrics that have been used in traditional finance. Maybe we need different metrics to better understand those effects, or maybe also to understand distributed ownership and track this new kind of how protocols are organized and governed. Is there any thoughts on that new innovative metrics for the Defi sector, perhaps? Jack at Missari, what's going on there?
00:27:59.400 - 00:28:53.690, Speaker B: Yes, I guess just harping back to some of the supply nuances we were talking about before. Something that we look into quite a bit is what we kind of refer to internally as like the liquid supply overhang. So it's that total amount of liquid supply over the circulating supply. So negating tokens that are held by again like the foundation of the treasury but not necessarily encumbered by any smart or legal contracts and again that shows kind of like the risk of the market being just flooded with tokens and causing rapid circulating supply inflation. It really seems like that is one of the leading drivers are oftentimes in just like a steady slow price depreciation that oftentimes people don't really take into account.
00:28:59.760 - 00:29:22.370, Speaker A: And also more information at Messari I guess and thank you for that check. Thank you Andrew for joining this panel and we'll stay in touch and have again the chance to provide metrics and a deep dive into to better understand the markets, these crazy markets in Defi today. Thank you.
00:29:23.380 - 00:29:24.780, Speaker C: Thank you. Bye.
