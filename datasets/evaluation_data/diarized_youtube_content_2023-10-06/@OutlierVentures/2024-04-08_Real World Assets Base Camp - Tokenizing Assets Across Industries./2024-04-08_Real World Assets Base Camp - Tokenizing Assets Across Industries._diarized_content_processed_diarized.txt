00:00:00.440 - 00:00:25.342, Speaker A: The problem in this space right now is there's not many demand for a lot of the supplies that all these very different projects are trying to put on chain. So encouraging the founders and projects focus on the demand side is, I think, where the holy Grail gonna be. RWA is an interesting topic, potentially very, very big, and it's an interesting time to connect with all of the founders.
00:00:25.398 - 00:00:34.694, Speaker B: Tokenization. It's very much not a new concept. There was a lot of talk about adoption back in the last cycle, and we've been very much at the forefront of that as.
00:00:34.734 - 00:00:47.702, Speaker A: A accelerator, like someone like outlier. I think if you'd be able to centrally look at a space providing that solutions and then just focusing on building a product that was a great market fit, I think you'll be able to really jump start your growth.
00:00:47.798 - 00:01:17.254, Speaker B: Outlier ventures have been around in this space for a long time. Actually, one of our portfolio companies who participated on our first ever Basecamp back in 2019 is of course, Boson Protocol. And then, of course, we've worked with a number of players more in the financial space as well. We've seen what didn't work out last time. We've seen kind of that road to adoption via those founders, and I think meeting in the middle somewhere, having that institutional side and having our web3 expertise come together is really a sweet spot.
