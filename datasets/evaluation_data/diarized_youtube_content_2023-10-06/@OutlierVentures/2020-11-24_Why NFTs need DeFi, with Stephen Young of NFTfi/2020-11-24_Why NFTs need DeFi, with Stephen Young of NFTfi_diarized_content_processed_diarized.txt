00:00:13.130 - 00:01:06.926, Speaker A: So welcome again to this week's Diffusion Live. So today we're going to be talking about why nfts need DeFi. There's been an increasing trend that nfts are being leveraged in Defi as a new form of collateral and to effectively borrow and lend. And by that, by nfts, I mean things like cryptokitties, gaming items from axes, virtual land on decentraland, crypto, voxels, you name it, the plethora of nfts. We're going to cover all that today. So we're going to go and do a deep dive into how both borrowers and lenders are using these markets. Who are they? Why are they doing it? What are the behaviors and what are their motivations? So today I'm really happy to welcome on Stephen Young, founder of Nifty Phi DeFi for nfTs.
00:01:06.926 - 00:01:08.210, Speaker A: Welcome, Stephen.
00:01:08.870 - 00:01:11.410, Speaker B: Hey, nice to be here. Thanks for having me, Jamie.
00:01:11.990 - 00:01:36.940, Speaker A: So you describe the platform as peer to peer collateralized lending, obviously in the context of nfts, as I described at the top. So it'd be good to high level. Just start to explain what's happening here, who's involved, why is it happening, and the kind of scale. I know you've got some really good stats for us before we then jump into the detail.
00:01:37.630 - 00:02:20.806, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. So what's happened now over the last few years, since cryptokitties started in 2017, there's been a whole and cryptopunks and some of the early projects, a lot of these assets have slowly kind of been accruing quite a lot of value. So there's all of this kind of value sitting in these NFts that are quite illiquid. And a lot of people want to still hold on to the NFT, but they want to have access to that liquidity. So what we saw originally in the market was that people were doing this kind of between friends. So somebody would need some ether for something often because they want to buy into some new project.
00:02:20.806 - 00:03:12.958, Speaker B: And then people would run these spreadsheets where they would have things like, okay, well, I'll give you this item. You've given me this much. And then it's all kind of trust based. It only works for people that know each other. And then, so essentially what we've done is we've built a trustless way to do that. So who are involved? So on the borrower side, it's typically people who have either they want to go long on another project. So we had a huge influx of people listing cryptokitties during the NBA Topshots launch, because everybody spent all of the ether buying topshots and then had these founder cryptokitties sitting in their wallets worth 20 ether, and they wanted to take a loan out against those cats and then go long on topshots.
00:03:12.958 - 00:03:47.400, Speaker B: So that's the one. The other thing we see quite often is people who just need short term liquidity to cover a short position. So they went a margin somewhere else. The markets have moved against them, so they're looking to cover short positions. And then the last one is people just needing money in the real world. So it's people who've invested in these projects for long term, who are struggling a little bit with capital at the moment, and they're literally taking out loans to cover costs in their real life. So that's on the borrower side.
00:03:47.400 - 00:04:32.094, Speaker B: On the lenders, there's a few different strategies. So the one is just, you're trying to get yields, so you're just trying to make money. So typically those people will give loans, loan offers, kind of region of like an 80%, between 60 and 100% APR, but roughly around the 80%. And really they are just looking to make a yield on the ether. The other strategy is to use in FTFI almost as an acquisition strategy. So that's what I do often. So if I see an artwork that I really like, I'll kind of give a 50% of the market value loan on that, and then kind of hoping that the person defaults.
00:04:32.094 - 00:04:45.910, Speaker B: Because essentially what you've done then is you've bought an artwork that you like for 50% of market value. Those are the kind of the two main strategies, just trying to make money, and the underside collectors.
00:04:47.610 - 00:05:28.822, Speaker A: Great. And obviously, the collecting behavior, at least from my personal experience, is incredibly addictive. And I know you're also a member of the 100 X art discord, which was primarily around like, fine art, digital fine art. But naturally, a lot of people have a mix of different types of collateral collectibles and gaming items is something I'm only just starting to look at. But it's hilarious, because in there, everybody's always saying, okay, I'm tapping out, now I'm not going to buy anymore. And then the next minute they're saying that they participated in a particular drop. So people are almost definitely overextending themselves, hopefully for the better.
00:05:28.822 - 00:06:42.666, Speaker A: But certainly from a personal perspective, I can see why something like this is going to be so critical. And then equally, I can imagine a lot of people who are starting out bootstrapping a collection, but feel that they've got some kind of edge, whether it's specific to a particular game or they feel that they have an eye for fine art. This can be a way for them to bootstrap a collection so they can borrow against their growing collection to buy more. And assuming that they're any good, that should hopefully go in the right direction for them. I also think that with everything that's going on, wider crypto market now, bitcoin potentially breaking all time highs, the idea that an NFT will be the new lambo. So like we had when moon and when Lambo in 2017 with icos, I can see a lot of new crypto wealth being recycled into NFTs as a form of status, as a bit more relevant to crypto than a lambo, especially in a Covid world where most people are not likely to see you driving around in it anyway. So enough of that.
00:06:42.666 - 00:07:02.020, Speaker A: We're going to go really deep and make the most of having somebody like you on here, because obviously you're seeing the statistics that are coming off your platform more widely. So I believe you're going to walk us through a presentation, looking at each different asset class and then potentially showing us how some particular trades in market.
00:07:02.950 - 00:08:00.738, Speaker B: Yes, so I've got some stats that I pulled over the last since we went live. So we went live roughly June. So obviously a lot of the stuff is still preliminary, the market is still developing, but I'll kind of highlight kind of the major trends I'm seeing so far, and then dive a little bit into first the different categories of projects. So looking at metaverse, collectibles, art and gaming, and then we also look at some of the bigger projects inside each one of those categories, and we can look at how the lending behavior differs between the two of them. So just a very kind of brief overview of how things work. We don't have to go into a lot of detail, but some of this is important to understand how we get to prices. So the way it works is that a borrower can list any NFT that they have on our platform, and then lenders can make them offers.
00:08:00.738 - 00:08:50.120, Speaker B: And the offer consists of a few fields, it's the loan principal, the repayment amount, and the loan period. So there's no obligation for a borrower to accept any offers. So essentially what happens is that they get a bunch of offers and then they pick whatever offer is most appropriate to them. We kind of have this market based way to figure out what the price is. Why is it useful for people who are interested in NFTs to a have a platform like this and b look at some of the stats on it. So the main thing that we're doing is we're just providing more liquidity. So we're kind of unlocking some of the value already in this space to kind of have it move around so that we can use it for other things.
00:08:50.120 - 00:09:36.420, Speaker B: But if you're looking purely at the stats, what you're getting is price signals that you don't get on other platforms. And what you get out of that is a very conservative price floor. So what the lenders do is they won't make an offer for more than say 50 60% of the floor price of an asset because if the borrower defaults, they need to flip that asset as soon as possible. So you pretty guarantee that this is going to be a very conservative floor price. If you're looking at the APRs, that also gives you some indication of how risky the market perceives these assets to be. I'll show a couple of examples of that when we get into the data. And then loan volume gives you an indication of how many people are actually interacting with this platform.
00:09:36.420 - 00:10:05.840, Speaker B: So I'm going to just jump into a very quick overview now of the market. So first of all, let's just look at overall stats. So we launched in June. A lot of these loans were just early tests. So really the action started after that. So we've done 282 loans and average loan size is about two ether, with the largest loan being around 34 ether. And you can see the average or the mean APR is roughly 80%.
00:10:05.840 - 00:10:39.166, Speaker B: And we've done 624 ether in loan over the last, say four months or so. Four and a half. So it's still relatively small if you compare it to the wider DFI ecosystem. I think the main limiting factor there is just having enough nfts of high value to be able to do these loans. With the gas prices, how they've been, it doesn't make sense to do a 0.1 ether loan on anything because you're going to pay more in gas fees. So let's look quickly at the kind of the major categories.
00:10:39.166 - 00:11:20.710, Speaker B: So collectibles compared to the main category, you can see we've got slightly lower aprs and some of the largest loans are in there. And the mean loan size is also slightly higher with a relatively good repayment ratio. So I suspect the reason collectibles have a slightly lower APR is because a lot of the first NFT projects that came out were collectibles. So these are the projects that have been around the longest they've got an established market. There's a big user base, so it's less risky for people to lend against that. If we dive deeper, you can see in much more detail. You see cryptokitties.
00:11:20.710 - 00:11:49.194, Speaker B: So this July spike over here, that was when Topshots launched. So a lot of the dapper Labs people had cryptokitties, and they all wanted loans during that period of time. And you also see the repayment ratio is actually not that great for cryptokitties at the moment. And I suspect that was because a lot of people were speculating here. And then the market moved. The ethereum market went up, so they couldn't quite cover all of their positions. So a lot of these loans got defaulted.
00:11:49.194 - 00:12:32.858, Speaker B: I got a really great cryptokitty out of a default in one of those, so I was happy. Crypto punks are really interesting. So they just recently started being usable on our platform because of the guys from art gallery doing that wrap crypto punks contract, which then makes them EOC seven to one compliant. Sorry. So if you look at the APR on these, it's really low. It's 30%, and the largest loan on this one is five ether. There's one loan that's not included in here, which was a $10,000 loan on a die based loan on a cryptopunk ape.
00:12:32.858 - 00:13:14.380, Speaker B: So these are only the Ethereum stats. So we've had some really big loans there. But the interesting feeling for me really is kind of how low the aprs on cryptopunks and cryptopunks are. Really the project that's kind of proven long term value, the most of any of the other NFT projects. Avastars is a new project kind of taking off similar loan sizes to the cryptopunks, but much, much higher aprs. So we then look at the metaverse side of things, really. There's three main projects that are interesting in this space.
00:13:14.380 - 00:13:42.980, Speaker B: Again, our largest loan here was 34 ether. That was on a Decentraland estate. And it's like 197 ether loan volume. So it's like a third of the volume that we've done so far. Crypto voxels is really big. We've like relatively high loan values and 34 loans on there. And then Decentraland, and that's really started taking off over the last little while.
00:13:42.980 - 00:14:26.946, Speaker B: We've kind of seen a shift from lots of action in crypto voxels to lots of action in Decentraland over the last little while. This is that huge decentraland estate of 34 ether that we got the other day. Sandbox is interesting because if you look at the total loan volume, it's quite low. And largest loans are also quite low, and that's because the lands that are available at the moment are relatively small plots and they're still quite cheap. But if you look at the number of loans, there's 36 loans been done over the last little while. So if you look at it in loan volume, it's one of the lower ones. But if you look at it in number of loans, it's one of the busier projects out there.
00:14:26.946 - 00:15:09.022, Speaker B: So I think sandbox is something to watch. There's like a big community that's very active. Then on the art side, it's. A few of the platforms are showing up here, but we're actually seeing quite a lot of action from people who like Trevor Jones and Josie, who are minting on their own contracts. I think it's a bit harder to kind of get there, but once you have enough of a brand, it might be worthwhile for artists to consider doing their own contracts with their own names on there. And then what we've seen recently is a lot of action in the super rare space. So we're seeing more and more art being listed over here.
00:15:09.022 - 00:15:35.682, Speaker B: Aprs are slightly higher. And again, I think it's because art is a little bit more illiquid. There's a lot of art being produced. It's a little bit harder to value because it's a little bit subjective. And then you need to make sure that there are other collectors who are looking to buy this artist from you. The last one is gaming. It's like, on the smaller side, mainly Axi.
00:15:35.682 - 00:16:01.098, Speaker B: Really. It's pretty much all axi yesterday got a loan for gods unchained. But Axi, the biggest loan was on axi, which is eleven ether, as you can see here. Aprs are much higher, though, and we'll kind of see this. There's different behavior between different projects and there's different people. So you'll see a lot of the lenders specialize. Like you said earlier, Jamie, in one or two of the projects.
00:16:01.098 - 00:16:25.670, Speaker B: So again, there's only 13 loans. Over time, we should be getting much more accurate stats as things progress. So that's really it. That was like a very quick whirlwind tour of kind of the main areas. I'm happy to kind of jump back in and kind of go into more detail in any of these other things. Otherwise we can just carry on with the discussion.
00:16:26.250 - 00:17:09.510, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that was really useful. So I definitely want to pick up on a couple of points that you made there at the moment. I guess to lend requires pretty good knowledge and understanding of the underlying asset. I imagine the people that are lending are the same people that are borrowing, perhaps just at a different cycle in their month or their quarter or whatever's going on in the market. Have you got any insights in terms of the types of users? Are they the same people? Are people both on the lend and borrow side, specializing in one type of asset, or are you seeing them being a bit more diversified?
00:17:10.570 - 00:18:03.670, Speaker B: So I think it's a little bit of a mix. There are people that kind of go through cycles where they're sitting on a lot of liquidity waiting for another project. So then they would kind of put that to work on the platform, on the other hand, and then at other times they kind of maxed out. They kind of put their ether to flip. There is a cycle to the lenders on the borrower side, some people are doing that, but I see more people that are purely borrowers than people that are purely lenders. So I think that lenders often borrow because they just need some liquidity and they often have high value assets. But borrowers tend to kind of be more likely to just be borrowing.
00:18:03.670 - 00:18:43.070, Speaker B: And then what people tend to do is they specialize. Yes. So there's so many projects, you can't know everything about all of them. So people will kind of go into the discord and say, I'm willing to offer stuff on cryptokitties and crypto punks and arts, for example. So people do specialize, and then the kinds of people that are doing the lending. So there's a number of different groups. So it's either just collectors, so people who are looking to find to actually buy items.
00:18:43.070 - 00:19:42.600, Speaker B: And then we're also seeing quite a lot of interest from funds and from dows that are involved in collecting art pieces. So they've kind of raised a bunch of capital that's now sitting inside a smart contract somewhere that's not doing anything. So because of the way that the system works where you can make offers purely with signatures, it doesn't cost you anything to make an offer if your offer gets accepted, worst case scenario? Well, depending on what you want. But either you get some yield on your ether or you get an asset for 50% of the market value. So as an acquisition strategy for like a patient investor, it is quite a no brainer, to be honest. Obviously, you won't catch up and coming projects and artists early on because there's just not going to be enough value in those assets to warrant a loan. But what you can do is get kind of blue chip, high value assets for a cheap price.
00:19:45.210 - 00:20:14.514, Speaker A: If you are lending, it inherently requires you to be active, because as you say, the worst outcome, which might be the best one, depending on your strategies, is that you end up with this asset that you've quickly got to move on or recycle. So I guess until that becomes managed, like a managed service or packaged in some way, the lender has to feel comfortable that they could execute that trade quickly if they needed to.
00:20:14.712 - 00:21:17.926, Speaker B: That's also why we see loan to value ratios roughly 50%, especially for projects like a punk. So if you know that crypto punk's floor at the moment is three ether, and you did a one and a half ether loan, if the person doesn't pay back, you can sell that punk for two ether basically instantly. And in those scenarios, often the lenders make more money on selling and flipping the assets. So even if you're not looking to do it as an acquisition strategy and you're just looking to flip, it's often more profitable to actually get a default, as long as, you know, an accurately valued item. So if you get the valuation wrong, you're going to be in the wrong side of that trade. The other thing that adds a little bit of risk is you're dealing with movements in two assets, right? So it's the value of the project, and then it's the value of ether. And then some people price those assets in ether, others price them in dollars.
00:21:17.926 - 00:21:41.840, Speaker B: Sometimes the assets grow quicker than ether, other times it doesn't. So you just need to kind of manage your risk in that way. We do offer die based loans, so then at least you're not exposed to ether movements. But then on the other hand, you're not kind of exposed to any increases in price in ether if you're not in ether at the time.
00:21:42.770 - 00:22:03.380, Speaker A: Yeah, and I was going to ask that, what is the split between how things are priced and what do you see as the impact when you have a market movement like we're having now? Does what's going on in bitcoin impact this at all either?
00:22:03.910 - 00:22:49.200, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think bitcoin is a little bit. Well, if bitcoin goes up, ether goes up, which means it impacts us. Bitcoin indirectly impacts the market. So what we do see is you will see more defaults after a big run up in the ether price. So if you're doing a four ether loan, and then the price of ether doubles all of a sudden in dollar terms, that asset has now gone become twice as valuable, so you probably won't be able to sell it on the secondary market as easily. So again, longer term loans become more risky then, so you should expect higher APR for a longer term loan. So it definitely does.
00:22:49.200 - 00:23:21.660, Speaker B: We do see an increase in default rates after we've seen a huge spike in the Ethereum price, I suspect. So we've launched the DAi support a while back and we haven't really seen much traction on it. And now all of a sudden, as all of the price starts running now we're kind of seeing more and more Dai offers and people accepting Dai loans because it's a little bit easier to kind of manage in that way. And then you asked about the split in prices. What did you mean by that?
00:23:22.110 - 00:23:27.546, Speaker A: Oh, I think the question was the split between Dai and ETh. But I think you explained that die.
00:23:27.578 - 00:23:38.290, Speaker B: Yeah, like I said, we've had like two or three small die based loans and then we had that 110 thousand dollars loan on the crypto punk.
00:23:38.630 - 00:24:03.820, Speaker A: And so at the moment, because of everything that we just said, I imagine it's largely people doing these trades in a peer to peer way. Are you starting to see any algorithmic trading where people have algorithms looking for, I guess, this lend to acquire opportunity, or even just general arbitrage opportunities, price differentials and stuff like that.
00:24:04.190 - 00:25:05.902, Speaker B: So we're not seeing it directly on our platform yet. I do know of a couple of people that are looking to use machine learning based models to try predict the price of these assets. I think we've got a lot more history that needs to be built before we can get accurate pricing models. I think those kinds of pricing models would work much better for things like collectibles, where a lot of the things that give it value are encoded in a machine readable way on chain. So you know that every ape punk is more valuable than every non ape punk. What you then do is because you don't have as much liquidity in each individual item, you can at least spread all of the trades across all of the ones with the same traits to start getting enough information to do a prediction model. So I don't really think that's ready for prime time yet.
00:25:05.902 - 00:26:17.446, Speaker B: I think over the next four or five years, as we build up more data, I think some assets will have relatively good models. The other thing that we are seeing, which I think is going to be quite interesting, is you're starting to see these ERC 20 tokens that essentially wrap usually a collectible project with a specific trait so for example, there's a token called wrapped gen zero, which the contract allows you to send any gen zero cryptokitty to the contract and you'll get an ERT 20 token back. And I think you're going to start seeing arbitrage opportunities for those where you can just look at what the price of WGO is and automatically make offers for either loans or to purchase on secondary markets and immediately send it to Uniswap to you, wrap the token, send it to Uniswap, and sell it for a profit. So I do think that's coming, but it's going to require some of these other kind of pieces to be a bit more liquid and a bit more like, you need slightly bigger liquidity pool on Uniswap so you don't end up with too much slippage. Yeah.
00:26:17.468 - 00:27:20.822, Speaker A: And so you mentioned earlier you were starting to have conversations with dows in the context of lending. But as the value well as a blue chip form of NFT starts to emerge, I don't know if you class crypto punks as one of those, but there become nfts that become prohibitively high as an asset for the average person to participate in as like an alternative asset class. I imagine there's going to be maybe three ways that people can begin to get exposure to that asset. So that could be through fractionalization of an NFT. It could be through forms of indices, but also dows where collectives start to pull capital, potentially collateral, to then take a loan against to go after bigger pieces of assets. I can imagine that happening in a gaming context. I've been having conversations recently with people around NFT esports.
00:27:20.822 - 00:27:47.970, Speaker A: And obviously, to be able to play at the elite level, you need certain cards which hold a lot of value. And so you might need $100,000 worth of axio infinity cards just to in order to play at that level. So I can imagine increasingly going to see dows from the borrower side. Are you starting to see anything happening in any of these three areas, fractionalization indices, or dows from a borrowing perspective.
00:27:49.030 - 00:28:25.758, Speaker B: So we are definitely getting a lot of interest and getting contacted by quite a few dows. Typically, these are dows that are they mania looking as an acquisition strategy. These are dows that are. Their mandate is to collect art and kind of nfts. They've pre collected a whole bunch of ethereum. So now that Ethereum is sitting in their smart contract, and then they can start making offers and getting some yield on those assets. So that is definitely interesting.
00:28:25.758 - 00:29:04.460, Speaker B: There aren't that many of these dowels that are kind of up and running yet, but there's more and more of them kind of starting every day. So we're seeing quite a lot of interest on that side. On the fractionalization side, once something's fractionalized, it depends. So some of the fractionalization projects, like arc gallery, they do fractionalized punks. The fractions themselves are nfts. So we are seeing some of those things being listed on the platform as collateral. But for Niftyx and some of those other ones, what you get out is an ERC 20.
00:29:04.460 - 00:29:32.846, Speaker B: So we don't really have support for getting loans against an ERC 20. I think it makes more sense if it's an ERC 20, to just put it in uniswap pool or something like that, or eventually to do a maker Dow loan. But I don't think there's going to be a while before you accept it as collateral there. But, yeah, so we're seeing some there, but not a huge amount. And then the last one was. What was the last one, Jamie?
00:29:33.038 - 00:29:38.230, Speaker A: So you had fractionalization indices and dows from a borrow.
00:29:40.810 - 00:30:53.886, Speaker B: So I think the indices are going to be quite interesting. I haven't seen one that gives you a really clear indication. Maybe whale is kind of the closest to an index for the NFT space, but a lot of the value of whale comes from the community. So it's quite hard to untangle how much of it is the vault and how much of it is all of the marketing and the community all kind of built around that. I quite like these, almost the opposite of an index, but where you kind of go more specific, where you have a project like cryptokitties with millions of cats, and you have these tokens that represent a subset of those cats. And I think that's going to be more interesting in this space, because then you can get some kind of, what is the average price of a collectible that shares these traits, and that becomes quite interesting then to do automated trading on top of. Because the problem with a big index is it tells you what the whole market is doing, but doesn't tell you anything about what an individual asset is worth.
00:30:53.886 - 00:31:49.200, Speaker B: And the real problem with NFts that makes it different. Well, at least the NFTs we're seeing today, which makes them very different, they're just a completely different animal to what you deal with in ERC 20 because ERC 20s are fungible, so any one of them is equal to any other one. Nfds are unique so they're all unique, and a lot of the valuation then comes from people. So I'm sure you've kind of spending time in discord. You get to know the people that you're trading against, you get to know the artists that you're collecting, you get to know the people who live next to you in Decentraland, whereas if you're in a liquidity pool with 10,000 other people on Uniswap, you don't know who they are, you don't care who they are. There's no kind of social aspect to the whole. Yeah, I think it'd be interesting.
00:31:49.200 - 00:32:02.900, Speaker B: Indexes, I think will be useful, but it's almost not the thing that I'm most excited about in the space. What I really like about the NFT space is how many people you meet and how there is this kind of social component to it.
00:32:03.830 - 00:32:52.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting to think how you price in social value. And I think one of the ways that I describe nfts to people who are new to the space, if you almost forget the specific design of the NFT or its characteristics, is its social function. It's a form of social currency. And increasingly these things are being experienced in a social context, as you say, in a virtual environment. Right now, it might be in a fairly 2d digital environment, like a discord channel, but increasingly these things are being brought into a social context. They're being experienced, potentially even consumed in these environments. And I think for a lot of people that might be listening to this and aren't deep in nfts already, they're probably thinking we're just totally insane, right? We're talking about borrowing and lending and fractionalizing ownership of caps.
00:32:52.850 - 00:34:31.842, Speaker A: But the reality is, I think, to kind of help people grasp why this might feel very niche at the moment, but ultimately, especially for younger generations or also low income environments, a lot of people now whose primary wealth is going to be digital, and that might be for the rest of their life, so they're going to hold more wealth in a digital form than they ever will in a physical form. And in that context, whether it's kids earning in game items in a gaming environment, they might end up borrowing against those to buy a physical car, or borrowing against those to buy a home eventually, because that's how they're going to make their income and their wealth. On the other side, if you look at things like axes, which is a highly complex game to play, it's not easy either to play and therefore to collect, but there are like farms being created effectively of people, because the income that you can generate from just playing these things is the equivalent of a salary in many countries, especially in places like India, Southeast Asia, of course, Africa and Latin America. And so as a consequence, these people are earning digital wealth. They're maybe splitting that income with their benefactor, the person that's effectively financing them. But potentially, as they can begin to borrow against their collateral, they become less serfs working for somebody else's farm, and they become more of an individual entrepreneur or a business person. And so in that context, that is where a huge amount of economic wealth is going to happen.
00:34:31.842 - 00:35:22.260, Speaker A: And I think it's in these kind of environments that you're creating these protocols and platforms, which is effectively going to be how they finance what they do. And so I think, who needs a bank when you can borrow and lend against your nfts, right? And so the idea of him unbanked becomes almost irrelevant. Stephen, it's been great having you on. Definitely going to get you on again, because I can see that you're getting great growth figures on the platform, and this is only just the beginning. Right? And circling back to what I said earlier, I really believe that nfts are going to be the Lambo of 2021 boron. So where can people find you? Do you have any recommendations if people are looking to dip their toe into lending where they might not be so deep in any particular asset type?
00:35:22.630 - 00:36:15.042, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Our website is called htpnftfi.com, so we've got some guides on there that kind of look at the different strategies and how you need to do it. There's also a link on the website to our discord, and the community is quite friendly, and if you need some help in valuing assets, they're often willing to jump in and help you out. I'm also on discord in there, so if anybody needs some help or needs some advice on how to value stuff, there are tools that allow you to value some of these assets. So I can kind of point you in the right direction, and then you can also just follow us on Twitter at nftfi. But, yeah, I think Discord is by far the best place.
00:36:15.042 - 00:36:27.800, Speaker B: There's some really smart people in there, a lot of kind of the big collectors and people who've been around in the space for a long time. So if you need to know anything or need some advice on the offers that you're making, that's probably the best place to go.
00:36:28.170 - 00:36:49.246, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, as you said, it's a very relatively small community at the moment. Everything's done in a social context. So actually you're probably best starting out a discord server, getting to know the people that you're probably going to be borrowing and lending against and getting a feel for individual assets. And it's been a huge help to me. So Stephen, it's really been great having you on. Thanks for coming on.
00:36:49.246 - 00:37:14.342, Speaker A: I hope everybody enjoyed it. I know I did. Incredibly informative. For those that don't already know, Outlier Ventures is a web3 accelerator. We're working with lots of NFT related startups similar to Niftyfi. So if you're working in this space, especially early stage, please do get in touch at Outliventures IO slash basecamp. Stephen, thanks for coming on and for everybody.
00:37:14.342 - 00:37:19.830, Speaker A: I'll see you next week, same time UTC on Wednesday.
00:37:20.250 - 00:37:20.930, Speaker B: Thanks Jamie.
