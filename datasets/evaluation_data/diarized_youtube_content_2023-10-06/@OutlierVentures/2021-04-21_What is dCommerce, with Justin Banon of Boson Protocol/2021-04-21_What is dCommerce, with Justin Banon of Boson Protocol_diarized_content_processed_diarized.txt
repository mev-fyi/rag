00:00:00.250 - 00:00:48.682, Speaker A: So welcome to OV studios. Justin, good to have you here. Obviously, we've known each other for some time, so what I want to do is to talk through Boson today. Obviously, there's a lot of hype, I'm sure both of us would think rightfully so. But for those kind of looking from the outside in as to boson, the project, the traction, momentum and hype that's been having over the last several months, it's difficult to understand what's behind it, what's driving its momentum and how it's going to deliver on its promise. So today we want to try to kind of unpack that for everybody. So I think before we go into boson, it's important to contextualize boson and to think about it in the context of the current web.
00:00:48.682 - 00:01:50.090, Speaker A: And obviously, it's an antithesis to web platforms, platform monopolies that have kind of dominated the last decade plus of the web. The best example in the context of e commerce is obviously Amazon. The reality is, though, and you and I will openly admit this, we enjoy the benefits of things like Amazon prime. We have too many alexas in too many rooms around our home. So it's undeniable that everybody's benefited from platform monopolies, the efficiency gains that we get, the final mile capabilities and all this good stuff. But at the same time, I think there's a spectrum of understanding about what's wrong or broken with the platform model, perhaps why, if you follow it to its end, conclusion, it's dystopic. So from your perspective, what's the problem? Why do we need ecommerce?
00:01:50.250 - 00:03:03.000, Speaker B: So the benefits of ecommerce and digital technologies are clear, and you outlined some of them, the convenience, the sort of instant delivery, the choice, et cetera. However, what we're also finding is that some of the promise of, for example, a sharing economy, of removing friction and cost from the system, aren't being delivered. And part of that is due to the sort of market structure of having an intermediary between a buyer and a seller who can exercise control and market power. And what we're seeing is that the economies of scale and scope which companies such as Amazon accrue mean that over time they are creating a playing field where other firms can't compete and where increasingly they are able to extract more and more from consumers, from firms and distort the market.
00:03:04.170 - 00:03:41.022, Speaker A: Yeah, so know monopolies monopolize. And so it could be argued, Amazon as a corporation is just doing what any good corporation would do. It's maximizing profits. It's trying to acquire as much market share as you know. Why should it be any different? And what do you think has been the role of regulators in this? Why haven't regulators stopped or contained this? And I guess, why is a digital monopoly worse than any other monopoly?
00:03:41.086 - 00:04:07.770, Speaker B: Governments and regulators are failing to contain the threat of complete monopolization and complete domination. And that trajectory leads to essentially a kind of global extraction farm where consumers, other businesses are all in a position where there is no competition and where value, excessive value, is extracted.
00:04:08.670 - 00:04:38.738, Speaker A: So if we think about what is a digital monopoly, digital platform, monopoly, it's not just a monopoly of transaction, right? There's also a data component. There's other components to that that are perhaps more pernicious than just having a monopoly on a particular form of good. Right. Can you maybe talk through why those elements are equally, if not more concerning from a monopolistic perspective?
00:04:38.834 - 00:05:41.130, Speaker B: Sure. If you take an ecommerce platform, for example, there are a number of core activities that they perform. So one is the coordination of buying and selling, the exchange of sort of digital value for a physical item. So this coordination function, but then, as you highlighted, there's also this increasingly this data function, and being able to collect data on buyers, sellers, their preferences, transaction data, et cetera, is a powerful and unassailable tool to developing more products, to being able to capture more market share and extract more value. And what we're seeing then is this monopolization of both the coordination function and the data function, which means that other firms just can't compete. And so we just see this sort of black hole towards a single organization controlling what should be an entire ecosystem.
00:05:41.630 - 00:06:20.358, Speaker A: And I guess that compounds as well, right? Because very quickly that becomes a data monopoly, ultimately is an AI monopoly, and that then allows the system to better optimize, to make better decisions. And that advantage is very difficult to catch up. So even if you could break up Amazon, it's already enjoyed the data advantage. It's allowed its systems to be better trained and its AI to effectively be more. So. I don't know if you've kind of got some thinking around that element as well.
00:06:20.444 - 00:06:45.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's multiple nested feedback loops of economies of scale, economies of scope, then these economies of insight from the data, and then these kind of economies of intelligence as well, all of which, as you said, compound towards this sort of singularity, almost of just complete control of a market.
00:06:46.850 - 00:07:05.490, Speaker A: Right? So what's the alternative then? So you've got, on the one hand, platform monopolies, most people experience them, whether they fully understand the business model or not. But this is the web as it is today, the ecommerce businesses that we engage with, what's the alternative?
00:07:06.250 - 00:08:20.442, Speaker B: So if we look firstly at what a platform is, essentially a digital platform enables a consumer and a producer to come together with an interaction facilitated by an intermediary. And so in order to, platforms were hugely disruptive to the previous business models, and that's why we've seen such a huge rise in them. But there are also business models or design patterns that disrupt platforms. And I think what we are starting to see is the rise of these tokenized ecosystems. So if you look at DeFi, we have an ecosystem of tokenized kind of protocols and applications all working together to create this sort of liquid digital marketplace. And likewise, boson protocol, leveraging Defi infrastructure and technology, creates a liquid digital marketplace for things. So it's similar to, for example, the liquid sort of global market for commodities.
00:08:20.442 - 00:08:42.226, Speaker B: So you can trade cocoa futures or pork belly in Beijing or Chicago, and these real world things flow across this global digital marketplace. Boson protocol enables that for anything, product, service.
00:08:42.408 - 00:08:56.760, Speaker A: So the status quo are platform monopolies. As you said, these are kind of e commerce platforms, which everybody knows and interacts. They might not fully understand it. So what's the alternative to a platform?
00:08:57.630 - 00:09:49.740, Speaker B: So if we look at what a platform is, essentially a platform is a closed digital environment where a centralized intermediary will bring together a producer and a consumer and manage some sort of interaction or transaction between them. And you could liken a platform to a centralized economy. However, in the same way that platforms disrupted the previous sort of business models or design patterns, platforms themselves can be disrupted. And we've seen that centralized economies get disrupted by market economies, and likewise, centralized platforms can be disrupted by open markets, tokenized ecosystems, in fact.
00:09:50.190 - 00:10:21.860, Speaker A: So when you talk about tokens, most people will just think about that in the context of these speculative assets in crypto. But actually, for you, a tokenized network is important, it's an important innovation because they are incentive or disincentive mechanisms, right? They can allow for you to program behaviors into systems. So could you just talk us through that conceptually, and why that makes a network that much more powerful compared to a platform?
00:10:22.550 - 00:11:10.494, Speaker B: Sure. So the key with tokenized networks, in fact, tokens are a generalized term, and tokens can impact networks in a number of ways. So firstly, within platforms or network affects business models, there are some pretty fundamental challenges. One is the whole bootstrapping problem of how do I get buyers to join a network with no sellers, sellers to join a network with no buyers. So tokens give a very powerful way of incentivizing early users to provide this financial utility in advance of network utility. So it's a way of really turbocharging network effects. Business models.
00:11:10.494 - 00:11:42.570, Speaker B: Firstly, secondly, tokens, certain types of tokens, for example, nfts, can be programmed with, for example, game theory. Or you could think of this as just a set of rules that will cause behaviors within or incentivize behaviors between participants. So this combination of incentives and then encoding, game theory is very powerful in changing the properties of these networks.
00:11:44.670 - 00:12:19.170, Speaker A: So I know you think of dcommerce as an innovation system, and you take a lot of inspiration and look to leverage innovations and technologies, infrastructure from ecommerce. And I know we kind of share this feeling that DeFi is incredibly powerful because it's competition, Max, if you compare it to the existing financial system. So could you talk us through how ecommerce is similar to DeFi and why it will enable kind of greater levels of innovation and competition?
00:12:19.330 - 00:13:37.970, Speaker B: Sure. I see the different systems for innovation as it's a bit like having a, well, banking, for example, is a bit like having a fortress. You put all of your expenditure and energy on the castle walls to protect competitors from coming in, and there's very little incentive to then innovate inside those castle walls. In contrast, DeFi is the castle walls have been breached and there are people marauding everywhere, and lots and lots of combat and competition. And this drives this kind of innovation. And the same could be said of e commerce, where we are creating monopolies that, yes, will innovate to support their market position, but not that fundamental innovation all across the value chain, and this kind of creative destruction, if you like. Whereas within ecommerce, the system that we seek to set up is one that in a similar way to DeFi, there will be this kind of competition, Max, across the entire value chain of separate projects, working on each area to optimize.
00:13:38.710 - 00:13:44.900, Speaker A: So how does boson protocol enable ecommerce? I know you have a primitive and ecosystem play.
00:13:45.530 - 00:15:04.654, Speaker B: So at the heart of boson protocol, there are a number of these core primitives. And so firstly, there is the coordination of the exchange between a buyer and a seller. So a buyer exchanging digital value for a physical product or service, this primitive is handled by a piece of game theory that's actually encoded within an NFT, within what we call a commitment token. So a buyer will place a deposit, a seller will place a deposit, and a buyer will place a payment amount into an escrow, which is then managed by this sequential game. And so what that does is automates away a lot of the kind of the cost and friction of having a human arbitrator, and also eliminates the need for a centralized intermediary. So those commitment tokens are one primitive, another primitive are thing tokens. So thing tokens are ERC 20 tokens that represent a particular type of thing product service.
00:15:04.654 - 00:16:01.630, Speaker B: So for example, we could have an ERC 20 token that's minted for a particular green bicycle, let's say. And I can buy that ERC 20 token either directly at a fixed price, but perhaps I buy that ERC 20 token from a balancer pool with a bonding curve, giving us all sorts of kind of DFI and financial possibilities. But essentially I buy this thing token, and that can then flow across the whole of Defi. It can find itself in a collateral pool, it can find itself know with some sort of synthetic product built on top of it. But then eventually that thing token is the thing that can then be used to buy the NFT. So you plug that thing token into the NFT and commitment token, and then that commitment token handles, using game theory, the exchange of digital value for a physical thing between a buyer and a seller.
00:16:02.050 - 00:16:44.410, Speaker A: So you alluded to the idea that once you have a commitment token and you have a thing token, these become collateral in DeFi. And so you can begin to then leverage all the things that happen in DeFi today, but then things that are also in development. Right? So you could have something that is a derivative, you could have something that is people speculating on the fulfillment of a particular thing. You can have new forms of credit and insurance. Can you talk us through perhaps in the near to midterm, some of the things that in defi that you think could be leveraged in the context of ecommerce?
00:16:44.570 - 00:17:39.274, Speaker B: Sure. Well, a really basic one is just forward orders. So as a restaurant, I could sell my tables and meals for the next year in advance, and then they could be secondary traded, or they could be bundled. That's a pretty basic one. But also, let's say you and I, Jamie, decided that we had an idea to create some sort of anti gravity hoverboard, which sort of thing we might come up with. And we said, okay, well, let's raise some money for that. Then what we could do is we could mint a thing token for our antigrab hoverboard, and we could put that into a balancer pool, and we could create an initial product offering in advance of actually building and building that hoverboard.
00:17:39.274 - 00:17:55.090, Speaker B: And so what we have is just straight out the box, a decentralized Kickstarter. So these are just a couple of the examples of what happens when you leverage defi with boson as a bridge to financialize real world assets.
00:17:56.250 - 00:18:48.390, Speaker A: So I want to kind of circle back to the core primitive again, because I think it's important for people to realize why ecommerce is now possible as a consequence of boson. So of course, a lot of innovation is going to come in the ecommerce stack from organizations and people beyond the boson team. But this kind of exchange mechanism is the core primitive, right? Because without that, it's like the cornerstone to what's possible and could be considered like the innovation Kickstarter that stablecoins were to defi. This is to, is that, why has that been so hard to solve for? And why is it so important in the context of ecommerce, but then maybe even extending into things around like the metaverse and virtual environments.
00:18:49.210 - 00:19:47.094, Speaker B: So that core, what we call our core exchange mechanism, is this commitment bridge between the digital and physical worlds. And so actually what we don't do, we do not tokenize real world items. Actually, we tokenize a commitment between a buyer and a seller to perform a transaction, to perform this exchange. And so we are a type of futures contract. And so in the same way that futures contracts can then be kind of represented digitally and sort of bundled into other products, that's what boson enables, and it enables that in a composable way. So every time you have some sort of application that you want to create a digital to physical redemption, you don't need to solve for that. You don't need to build that complex piece of technology.
00:19:47.094 - 00:19:54.250, Speaker B: You can just plug into boson as almost an oracle to the world of physical assets.
00:19:54.830 - 00:20:32.070, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess if you subscribe to the inevitability of DeFi because of that competition max principle, and you begin to understand that commitment tokens and thing tokens then become a new form of real world or truly valuable assets in the context of DeFi. For the first time, actually, you've got things that mean something to real people in the real world being used in DeFi, rather than just people speculating on any given token or stablecoin.
00:20:34.090 - 00:21:22.440, Speaker B: My view on DeFi is that the infrastructure that underpins DeFi is the thing, and the financial part is the first instance of its use. So that part of it, but also the fact that this infrastructure is just natively infused with finance as well, is the other key thing. But we've seen with what ocean protocol are doing with data, using DeFi infrastructure and infusing finance with data. And now building on that, what we at Boson protocol are doing with things I think DFI infrastructure will be the infrastructure upon which the web3 is built.
00:21:23.450 - 00:21:43.200, Speaker A: So let's talk about go to market. I know that there are a number of sdks that you've got, and then there are a handful of first applications that you're kind of seeding and populating this ecommerce stat with. Can you talk us through how you're rolling those out?
00:21:43.730 - 00:23:38.958, Speaker B: So we have a thought out, but quite dynamic go to market. So the way that looks at the moment is our first SDK that we will be launching will be an SDK called Metamol, which quite simply enables brands to, or anyone, in fact, too, to be able to sell a real world item in a virtual, in game or in world at one of our metamol stores, where you'll go and you'll buy a boson NFT, which you can purchase in game, in world, and then redeem that in store for the physical item. So that's the first release fast. Following that will then be an SDK that will enable NFT artists and marketplaces to purchase a boson commitment token NFT for a physical twin of a piece of art, and also for gamers to be able to buy a boson commitment token as an in game item for a physical product or service. So those are the first sort of series of boson sdks. And then following on from that is a DeFi SDK where we are partnering with a number of DeFi protocols where their users will be able to buy real world items or exchange digital value for real world items within the protocol, with no intermediaries, without touching fiat. And so that's a sort of sequence of boson sdks.
00:23:38.958 - 00:24:15.710, Speaker B: We're also working closely to support a number of more web 2.5 applications and thicker applications, one being nifty key, which is a crypto native rewards and loyalty program, which enables crypto exchanges, crypto credit cards, loyalty programs to buy boson nfts to reward and plug into their propositions, enabling their customers to redeem nfts for real world items.
00:24:16.130 - 00:24:43.510, Speaker A: And I noticed this other thing which I imagine is an extension of maybe metamorph, but this idea of a metaverse bazaar. So the idea that it's not just purely for digital to physical redemption, there is this idea that you can allow for the redemption or exchange of digital things without the permission of a platform itself, right? For example, a gaming environment.
00:24:44.650 - 00:25:23.700, Speaker B: Absolutely. So Boson protocol enables this sort of trust minimized exchange without the need for an intermediary. And the metaverse bazaar is simply that that could be a physical, digital, or on chain thing, an assortment of different items, and enabling that trust minimized exchange within world or from metaverse to universe. It should be irrelevant where you're buying from, too. You should still have the same sort of trust assurances and a very, very kind of slick user experience to go and just buy things without thinking about it.
00:25:24.310 - 00:25:49.994, Speaker A: And of course, you can't totally remove risk from the system through the mechanism or anything else, but there are layers of innovations that you can put on top, right? So let's say something goes wrong. Let's say the core exchange mechanism can't totally solve for an exchange. What can then happen? And what's the future roadmap for the additional layers that you can build on top of managing risk? Sure.
00:25:50.032 - 00:26:48.960, Speaker B: So, I mean, we're building bose on almost like a sort of an onion skin type approach. So there's the core mechanism, which we've discussed, of this core exchange mechanism that automates the management of that exchange. But if then a buyer, say, wants a refund or a return, that exchange mechanism, they can request one. And if the seller agrees, then that exchange mechanism can reverse and the item can be refunded using the core mechanism. But there are always going to be situations where the buyer or seller are not satisfied with the outcome, in which case there is an option to perform escalated arbitration to human arbitrators. And again, that's another module. And how we then cover the cost of that.
00:26:48.960 - 00:27:30.300, Speaker B: We leverage some sort of defi mechanisms where we, for example, will assess the risk of the buyer and the seller and then mutualise that cost. So it's like a defi insurance mechanism. And of course, all of these things are entirely possible in ecommerce, and they're entirely possible in ecommerce. The beauty of ecommerce is as you unbundle these services, you're reducing the power of one single centralized intermediary to control all those levers and then exercise market power. We're distributing those services and decentralizing the control.
00:27:31.330 - 00:27:55.170, Speaker A: And so the stack integral to the decommerce stack, like the defi stack, is that it is an ecosystem. It's composable. Any one module is interchangeable, and therefore, even boson can't monopolize that system. So can you just talk through the plans about how you're going to grow that ecosystem.
00:27:55.610 - 00:28:56.790, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. To start, there are two things. One is I don't think it's possible for one single entity to solve this scale of design challenges that are there. And two, it's not our intention to replace a centralized well with a decentralized well. So whilst we focus on the core and also some core components, outside of that, there is a whole range of different problems that need solving. And our approach is we are, for example, doing a collaboration with the token engineering community and Gitcoin to fuse web3 developers, token engineers and technologists with ecommerce devs and technologists by bringing these two sets of people together through hackathons and working groups, et cetera, to first discover what are the problems.
00:28:56.790 - 00:29:47.350, Speaker B: So there are some obvious ones, for example, connectors into shopify, on and off, ramping connectors into point of sale systems, identity. All of these different elements are all pretty obvious, but there will be some that we just haven't foreseen that these smart minds getting together will see. So the first part there is the discovery and then providing through the boson and ecommerce Dow structure that we have, providing funding to then take these concepts to the next stage and then eventually for certain set of projects to actually fund them, including through the conversations we've had with the outlier ventures basecamp having an accelerator track to fund e commerce projects.
00:29:48.170 - 00:29:57.590, Speaker A: Well Justin, thanks for coming into chat. Really looking forward to sharing with you on this decade plus long mission of making e commerce mainstream.
00:29:57.930 - 00:30:01.770, Speaker B: Thanks Jamie, and thanks for yours and outlier support on this journey.
00:30:01.850 - 00:30:04.030, Speaker A: I guess we'll go and burn our alexis now, right?
00:30:04.100 - 00:30:04.720, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:30:06.130 - 00:30:06.590, Speaker A: Great.
00:30:06.660 - 00:30:08.090, Speaker B: Love it. Awesome. Cheers.
00:30:08.250 - 00:30:13.180, Speaker A: Do you want to retake any of that or. Yeah, no, I was happy with it. I've noted down every point where.
