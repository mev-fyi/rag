00:00:48.512 - 00:00:57.002, Speaker A: So today I'm really happy to welcome Vivek Prasanan, co founder and executive director of Pockadex. Welcome Vivek.
00:00:57.146 - 00:00:59.326, Speaker B: Thanks Jimmy, thanks for having me here.
00:00:59.508 - 00:01:53.194, Speaker A: So Polkadex is a fully decentralized peer to peer order book for the substrate DeFi ecosystem. So there's several reasons why I've got you on the show. Firstly, you are our latest investment, actually our second indian investment, and that seems to be a really big trend. I'm seeing lots more talent come out of the indian ecosystem for DFI and I think you're a great example of that. You are also a serial entrepreneur and clearly there is tremendous growth happening within the deck space, both in terms of volume. I think it's just surpassed 50 billion last month, which is a 20 x annual growth on the previous year. But within that there's a lot of feeling that it's still very heavily constrained by a number of things, including liquidity.
00:01:53.194 - 00:02:51.394, Speaker A: Liquidity risks, high fees, now an all time high for provenance. We are kind of first week of March 2021, but also things like inefficient settlement, poor ux, and all these things that kind of just make it harder for the full spectrum of investor and trader to access DeFi. So there's a very good argument that it's got a long way to go before it can go primetime. And of course this is something that you seek to address with Polkadex. And I think also there's a huge amount of excitement as to what's going on in the Polkadot ecosystem. I know there are now several funds that are almost exclusively investing in that space and a number of exchanges are themselves kind of directly looking to kind of get in on the space. So there's lots for us to talk about there.
00:02:51.394 - 00:02:57.910, Speaker A: So this is at the top end. You are a co founder. I think there are three of you, right? Three co founders?
00:02:58.650 - 00:03:00.840, Speaker B: That's right, yes, three of us.
00:03:01.290 - 00:03:41.940, Speaker A: And you yourself are a serial entrepreneur, beginning I guess, towards the latter part of the.com boom. So you've seen several technology cycles yourself, and you've been an entrepreneur in pretty much all of them. So I think it's going to be great to kind of get and hear about your journey as a founder. So maybe we start there. So it'd be great to kind of hear from you your journey into Defi, and then we can kind of begin to explore what you think is broken or incomplete about the dex ecosystem today.
00:03:42.310 - 00:04:32.690, Speaker B: Okay, thanks, Jamie, for that brief intro. Well, I'm Vivek. Basically, I'm a systems engineer. I started out my career as starting out my first company back 20 years ago. I was into it consulting space for about 15 years before I diversified into building products. I think the most part I have been involved in, I've been very excited about solving problems, mostly in the engineering space back in 2013. It's a very accidental encounter with bitcoin with one of my friends introducing me.
00:04:32.690 - 00:05:42.620, Speaker B: And so I stumbled upon the concept of bitcoin and the white paper, and it was very exciting. So that's when the whole journey started. So since coming from an engineering background, I could grasp many of the fundamentals of bitcoin, and I was really captivated by it, and that's how the whole journey began. And since those days were like the wild west of the crypto, cyberpunks used to group together in a forum called Bitcoin Talk, and I used to be a regular visitor trying to figure out what things are going. And so for fascination, I used to try and get some mining machines as hobby and try and see how things are working. So I kept this interest long while I was also working on my other things, like my primary businesses, like mostly into not only it consulting, but also tried to. I was also involved in a couple of startups in the fintech space.
00:05:42.620 - 00:06:56.510, Speaker B: One of them was about a fee payment channel called NFE and also a banking software. So about the time I really got bored with service firm because you reach a point in your business life where you seek for more creativity and seek for more challenge in solving problems. And that's the time, about the same time that I started building products that I came across bitcoin. So that was pretty much a good set up for me to try and figure out the engineering behind it and go behind the entire whole nine yards. Since I was a regular visitor in bitcoin talk, I wanted to try and acquire some bitcoins. And since I was trying it as a hobby, I got some coins in my hand and then tried to trade it in one of those earliest exchanges, which some of them are no longer there right now. And so it's really fascinating, because it's the first time that you could have a peer to peer transaction settlement without any intermediary.
00:06:56.510 - 00:08:04.920, Speaker B: So even at that time, there were several people trying to take that peer to peer system forward, because I still remember the 44 gigahash mining machine I tried to acquire for testing out the mining. The transaction had to be made in bitcoin, and you basically had to have an intermediary, too. It works like an escrow service, right? Someone who is trusted by both parties. And he just acted as a middleman, and I sent the bitcoin to him, and the other guy shipped that mining machine to me, and the whole process was, again, cumbersome. So even at that time, there was a spark in my head where the system, even though it is a peer to peer Internet cache, the exchange process was really difficult. So I think not. So before too much of time, I think you could see people trying to solve this problem.
00:08:04.920 - 00:08:59.958, Speaker B: And that's when I came across one of the earliest dexes. That next was one of them, and bitshares was one of them. And I was really interested in bitshares. I still remember reading the post set up by Dan Larimer in bitcoin talk. So I used to follow that very keenly, and when the whole system launched. But since I was also primarily engaged in other businesses, I was simply watching from watching and trying to figure out how this space is growing. And in 2016 is when I thought of getting into that space, because bitches was a great platform that could actually allow you to create that experience of peer to peer, one to one settlement layer against different tokens.
00:08:59.958 - 00:10:33.590, Speaker B: So you could basically build a decentralized exchange on bitshares back then. And there were several people who tried it. And I think, unfortunately, I think due to a variety of reasons, down from the application of governance and the regulatory pressure on many of the exchanges built on top of that, they couldn't really scale or reach the potential which they promised in the beginning. So that's what actually prompted me to think about why it's not becoming mainstream, because it's a great technology. You have the peer to peer settlement layer of bitcoin and the blockchain, but you simply do not have the technology to allow two different assets to be exchanged in a trustless manner. And bitches had this great idea of collateralized assets, where you could collateralize bit shares for an equivalent value of assets, and you basically could create any asset in the world using these kind of smart contracts. So that's also about the same time when Ethereum rose to the scene and completely changed the way you could create smart contracts and create your own tokens and create your own ideas and raise money.
00:10:33.590 - 00:12:02.174, Speaker B: So I think it just got completely blown away by the ico hype in 2017, due to which I think nothing much could be done. I don't think industry could do much, except the fact that a lot of cleanup had to be done at that time. I believe from the investors perspective, and also from the industry perspective, that was a time when you really understood the difficulty of scaling, and you first came across the fact that even though these technologies are really fascinating, it does not have the underlying infrastructure to scale. And that's also about the time I fiddled around trying to create something in bitshare, and I tried to see if we could change the way the interface behaved. Because bitches had a three second settlement time those days, and I used to trade there just as a hobby, just to see how it. So I felt it's the problems Texas had even from those days of three second block time. It was the novelty around it, and the lack of liquidity and general aversion to people who do not want to have an interface that will not allow them to make profits.
00:12:02.174 - 00:13:14.614, Speaker B: Right end of the day, people are motivated by some sort of real use case. So I think it had great potential, but the reasons why it failed. So those are things which I used to think about how and why we could solve these problems. And that's also about the same time. I also was very much in touch with several startups in the crypto space in India. And through a common friend of mine, we met Gautam and know they were working on a consensus algorithm, very interesting consensus algorithm, and it was based on vector clocks. So even before that, I used to think about various, not really in the sense that of a real invested r and D, but I put a lot of effort into studying how the scaling issue could be, because many people were working on the layer two solutions lighten network, and I just follow Andreas Antonio Poly's very closely.
00:13:14.614 - 00:14:12.430, Speaker B: I'm a big fan, and the fact that many people are working was so fascinating. This particular algorithm was based on vector clock, so it's scalable algorithm, and it can basically increase the throughput to several times. So I think similar algorithms have been tried everywhere, but this was something unique in the sense that it is a little bit more. It's a totally different way to approach the problem away from the core blockchain architecture. So that's when we started regularly interacting. And Gautam and dipansh, they were working on that. So we reached a point where we had to apply it on an application layer which could demonstrate the scalability of the network.
00:14:12.430 - 00:15:15.794, Speaker B: So that's when I told Gautam, hey, man, I tried it with bitches, but just not working. You need to help me. And that's something that we could make work. The same algorithm could help make the problems with Texas so much better, because it's not only scalable, it also helps you to have transaction speed and many others, many other, you could have a very modular interface. So many of the issues which bitch has faced could be solved if you had a separate consensus algorithm away from the main interface part of the order book, which could be bit more plug and play sort of thing. That's when Gautam introduced me to Polkadot, because Polkadot is fairly new and substrate was also fairly new. And that's about the time when we started working together.
00:15:15.794 - 00:16:44.602, Speaker B: And after going through substrate, we felt it was a perfect platform to build such a product because it had everything that we need, I mean, everything that we were looking for, because it's very composable. It had a separate runtime, off chain workers or the concept of designing a blockchain was very much possible because all these years, like, people were applying their ideas on top of general purpose blockchains. So here we had an opportunity to create a blockchain out of scratch and decide what are the areas that could be under the consensus algorithm and what were the areas that could be taken out of it. And we could basically custom build a blockchain or custom build a defi application with the way you want it. Right? So going by the first principles, like what are we going to address it? So we are going to address the problems with Texas, which fairly is very straightforward, interface, liquidity, speed, and finally, something which many people don't understand is the latency. Right. So latency is very interesting because it's something which it is required for a platform, like a trading platform, to be really responsive.
00:16:44.602 - 00:18:12.026, Speaker B: So if you want a trading bot, or if you want a market maker, if you want any sort of bots to interact with your platform, latency has to be really low. So it's not just a matter of solving the throughput, it also had to be a problem of the latency. So I think that's how the whole thing came together. And we wanted to create a Dex, which not only solves the problem with the interface, but also solves the problem where participation is lacking in the other dexes because of this latency problem where the bots and the institutionalized market makers, institutionalized trading bots, people who are coming for a big profit, those people, as long as we keep them out, Dexes can never be mainstream. I think it has reached a time where a lot more needs to be done on the protocol layer of things, rather than just fancy ideas on top of blockchain. So I think polka dot and Web three is doing a great job, and they've brought out a big, great vision in rolling out a product like this, rolling out a platform like this. And the framework is perfect for someone who's trying to solve certain fundamental problems in many of the applications that they're trying to build, especially in the defi space.
00:18:12.026 - 00:18:16.922, Speaker B: So, yes, that's how we came together and started working on this.
00:18:17.056 - 00:19:13.920, Speaker A: Great, thanks. That was a really good intro and sets us up quite nicely to kind of move into the next part of maybe going a little bit deeper. So you alluded to some of the challenges within Dexes generally, and I know you've got some novel approaches, but I think let's just stay at trying to kind of understand some of the challenges at the moment within these dexes. So things like price slippage, impermanent loss, front running, and just general feasibility of certain trades for certain types of trader. Right. So could you, could you talk us through some of that in a little bit more detail? And then I think it'd be good to go into discussing some of your innovations about how you begin to solve for them.
00:19:14.290 - 00:20:01.710, Speaker B: Right. I think most of the problems around those list of things you mentioned, Jamie, I think, has to do with the way the basic network functions. Right. Basically, it's a matter of scalability. It's like a real estate, right. Everybody's competing for the real estate, so solving a problem like front running, it's not going to be possible if we clearly look at just reducing the fees or anything of that sort. So you maybe need to shift that idea outside it and bring it back to the blockchain for trust, because essentially what we are trying to create here, we are trying to create trust among the participants in the transaction.
00:20:01.710 - 00:21:22.326, Speaker B: So these problems originate from the fact that blockchains are inherently not very scalable, and there are certain parameters which are mutually exclusive. Like, for example, if you want to have more security, it's better to have slow confirmation times and all of that. So the more you focus on scalability, you have to compromise on many other things that's the same thing with the smart contracts and the programmability layer. And on chain, the more programmable, more complex it is, the more attack vectors you open up. So coming back to the problems we have tried to really address right from the start, the problem with front running and the gas fees. So right now, I think Ethereum, Texas are, most of them are going off chain because it's simply not sustainable anymore. And the fact that most of these defi applications are built on Ethereum is becoming more and more like a bottleneck where you have exciting ideas, but since the infrastructure is not ready, it's simply not working out.
00:21:22.326 - 00:22:14.338, Speaker B: It's simply like trying to create a Facebook app in 90s. Imagine if you tried to create a Facebook app into the 90s. It just wouldn't work. So I think more work needs to be done on the protocol layer or the network layer of things where the basic problems needs to be solved. So that's the reason why Polkadot, for example, is coming up with a larger vision of chain of chains, where you could offload many of the functions in a blockchain or many of the core properties of a blockchain. You separate that out. And Polkadot, being a relay chain, is able to take over the security of the other chains and help the other chains to focus on what they're really building or on their complex programs.
00:22:14.338 - 00:23:20.054, Speaker B: So that's a scalable architecture if you look at it. But it also depends on how fast you can spin another blockchain and how fast you can actually spin out something like a trust based network out of how fast you can do it. It's again a question, but still, when we started working on Polkadex, we looked at it from two angles. First is the interface of the customer. So interface has to be similar to a centralized exchange means that you need to have subsequent response on the interface, right? So subsequent response on interface is not really possible with a blockchain, because you need confirmation. So that's where we came up. We were continuously working on refactoring the trading engine on substrate, because the initial idea was to see how much you can stretch the blockchain, how much you can stretch the algorithm, and what was the throughput we could obtain.
00:23:20.054 - 00:23:35.330, Speaker B: Right? So that was the main objective with our first version of Testnet. And the more we tried, it got better and better. And the maximum we could achieve was 500, around 500 transit TPS, because there's a lot of execution that needs to be done for comparing the trade and settling it.
00:23:35.400 - 00:23:42.530, Speaker A: And just for context, how does that compare and I appreciate this is just testnet, but how does that compare to a centralized exchange?
00:23:42.950 - 00:24:32.610, Speaker B: Yeah, so you basically need to know how much of load the blockchain can handle, right. You need to benchmark the blockchain, you really need to know how many executions it can handle, because end of the day you need to know how many trades it can handle, how many trade settlements it can handle, and also the fact that you may have people placing trades and canceling it. So it needs to be accounted for. That's why it's very important to have first understand, because it's the first time that substrate has been tested. It's not like it's a very, fairly new platform. So nobody had written a trading engine on top of substrate. And so that's why it was very important for us to build an engine and try and test it out and see the throughput and see how.
00:24:32.610 - 00:25:07.322, Speaker B: And how we did that is very simple. We simulated the trades coming in from a centralized exchange and tried to figure out how much it could handle. And though initially the response it was really positive. But more you load it, the more transactions you load, the lesser and lesser the performance became. And that's when it came very clear that we need to have some sort of a mechanism to execute the transactions off chain and try and come up with something off chain, but verifiable sort of a solution.
00:25:07.466 - 00:25:17.140, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a hybrid approach of a centralized exchange with an order book and with the benefits of decentralization and security.
00:25:17.510 - 00:25:56.490, Speaker B: Exactly like the best of both worlds. Right. You need a faster interface. At the same time you need verifiability for final confirmation on the blockchain. So that's what we have been working on for the last couple of months, even after the initial version was mostly for benchmarking. But the team has been working hard on the layer two for the last two months. That's how we came up with the new idea of settling transactions on chain using a combination of state channels and commit chains.
00:25:56.490 - 00:26:39.606, Speaker B: It's basically a snapshot that's been passed on to the blockchain, every block. So that's how we have brought verifiability and coming back to the fearless transactions. Right, you asked about that. Yes, fearless transaction is very fascinating. It's something which can probably only possible with the way substrate and the polka dot system is designed. Right. See, because of the fact that you could have the security of the blockchain taken over by a parent chain or taken over by a relay chain, you can afford to have a fearless transaction yet keep the blockchain secure.
00:26:39.606 - 00:26:58.386, Speaker B: So it's very inherent to substrate's governance system. And that's something of an idea Gautam came up with. And it's a brilliant idea. And I think we are probably the first one to implement feelers transactions. There are so many. It's a double edged sword. Right.
00:26:58.386 - 00:27:23.290, Speaker B: You have feelers means you also is prone to attack. But we are working out a few things to make it expensive in a different way rather than by raising a gas fee sort of thing. But we approach it in a different way, which will be more detailed. Explanation will be in the white paper. So yes, I think we are going to be the first one with fearless transactions.
00:27:24.350 - 00:28:11.450, Speaker A: And so the consequence to these design choices or the removal of some of the limitations that come with Ethereum in DeFi is that almost a byproduct is that you remove some of the risk associated with, say, impermanent loss, but you also remove some of the asymmetry between participants in the dex. Right. So could you just talk us through the kind of front running component? And I know that you've developed a machine learning capability that allows the network to react real time to remove the incentive, the economic incentive for malicious activity like front running.
00:28:11.520 - 00:28:53.640, Speaker B: Right, right. So basically that was the initial idea, but I think we voted and made it more easier, more simpler. And how we have done is basically, you know how front running works, right? Because you basically have a bunch of transactions waiting to be confirmed and someone can just sneak in a transaction with the higher fees and he can just read the pool and he can insert the transaction ahead of the others. So he knows that, okay, transaction is coming and he can acquire that trade. So that's basically front running. So the fact that Polkadex don't have fees, gas fees. Right.
00:28:53.640 - 00:29:29.300, Speaker B: It just doesn't work. So every transaction is executed in the order, like a first in, first out, right. So you cannot bypass the queue. So it's something which is already available in substrate. So once we implement that, it is not possible to jump the queue by paying high gas fees. And it's regarding the DDoS scenario that we were really trying to engineer something which would detect and protect the network. That was the initial plan.
00:29:29.300 - 00:30:43.898, Speaker B: We tried to solve that in a little bit more simpler way by making it procreative for someone to create a trading pairs and swap randomly and clock or ddos the blockchain. So that design is also possible now that we have the layer two finalized. Because I mentioned about layer two, right. We were working on a layer two solution for the last two months. And because the order book is now separated and we only have to deal with the gas fees connected with the amm pool side of the exchange, we necessarily do not have to apply any other complex algorithms to prevent that, because we can always have a governance system and also a separate pooling system to make sure that nobody tries to abuse the network by creating random tokens. And there are so many other ways to solve that. So that's something which we were able.
00:30:43.904 - 00:30:58.490, Speaker A: To achieve, understood, and obviously that's very beneficial for the little guy to be able to kind of play on equal terms, right, with some of the larger, more sophisticated participants.
00:30:58.650 - 00:31:37.146, Speaker B: Absolutely. That is the main aim of the polkadex Amm pool, because it will be solving all of the present issues that we face with uniswap protocol, where you have very high gas fees, you still are able to read transactions and front run the transactions, and all of that is eliminated. You don't have zero gas fees, you don't pay anything, you just pay the basic takeoff fee and complete a swap. I know people who pay like $100, $200 for a swap. So yeah, it's insane right now.
00:31:37.328 - 00:31:50.080, Speaker A: That's really interesting. So what's going to be possible on it now in the near term, and what are your plans to add kind of increased features and functionality over the next twelve months?
00:31:50.850 - 00:32:41.534, Speaker B: Well, that's a good question. The fact that we have solved the on chain settlement problem using a layer two solution now, I think the system is capable of handling the load, which is quite okay to support whatever is required for margin or lending or even derivatives can be put on top of it. So I think at the launch we will definitely be going ahead and try and put at least marginal lending platform on top of the exchange at the launch, because it's not very complicated now, right? Because since it's executed off chain and it can scale. So it's just a matter of adding the features. So you can expect that one of these will be launched together and very soon this year we will be launching the derivatives market as well.
00:32:41.732 - 00:33:21.950, Speaker A: Okay, great. And you mentioned earlier a governance component as part of the, I guess, security model. How do you stop, or do you even want to stop? A lot of the things that happened with food protocols over on Ethereum in the summer of 2020, where liquidity was just, dexes were being forked, liquidity was jumping around wherever offered the most, the highest yield. Is that something you're looking to limit? Or if not, how do you grow market share in that environment?
00:33:22.290 - 00:34:01.478, Speaker B: Yeah. Right. So since Polkadex itself is a very application specific blockchain. It can really focus on what it needs to do best. Right. So the fact that it can accommodate the liquidity providers and keep rewarding them constantly from the growth it's able to sustain. We have also developed a perpetual liquidity mining program which will be able to reward the liquidity providers on a perpetual way from the profits that are generated.
00:34:01.478 - 00:35:07.966, Speaker B: Because it's a completely decentralized protocol that we are building on amm pool, because it's completely run by governance. And governance is also funded, the treasury is also funded continuously by the swaps and trades happening. So you have governance as a very strong way to control any sort of mishaps on the network in terms of people who want to abuse the network, or people who want to create problems or even create tokens and try and deedoze, or any sort of activity and try and fork the network, basically. I think governance plays a huge role in making sure that the tokens are distributed fairly. And the fact that it is a revenue generating product sitting on top of the blockchain, I think it's fairly easy to incentivize people who are participating in it. So that's a good way to. It's not a simple platform for people.
00:35:07.966 - 00:35:19.170, Speaker B: It has a revenue making product. Right. So the cash flow is still there, which can be used by the crushery to keep rewarding and sustaining that for a long.
00:35:19.320 - 00:35:29.010, Speaker A: Yeah, so the sustainable yield. And then could you just tell us a little bit about how the governance works and how you design for governance attacks?
00:35:29.170 - 00:36:08.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the specifics of that is currently, I think it's part of the white paper. I would just reserve my comments on that. But still, you can rest assured that it is a completely decentralized thing. So it's run by the community and you basically have a certain set of votes. And right now I think certain algorithms are being tried to make sure that if there is less participation, how the voting should go, how many yeses will be a no and those kind of things. Right. I mean, that has been designed, but it will be a completely community driven method for the MM pool.
00:36:09.006 - 00:36:34.874, Speaker A: Understood. Vivek, it's been great having you on the show. As I said, we're really proud to add you to the portfolio and again to have our kind of second indian startup come on. I would have loved to have had time to talk to you about what's going on in the ecosystem there. As I said, I'm seeing increased volume of startups coming out of there now. Within DeFi, crypto and even nfts. Sadly, we just don't have time.
00:36:34.874 - 00:36:44.062, Speaker A: But could you tell people, I guess, key events that are going on right now and how they can get in touch or follow what the progress that's happening?
00:36:44.196 - 00:37:25.466, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. So we have our ERC 20 token launch happening this month, end of the month, and we also have the main net launch with the product itself getting ready in May this year. So active security audit is going to happen starting from March, which will positively help us to deliver the product by the end of quarter two. So it's an exciting time for us. The ERC 20 token launch is shaping up, I think. Yeah, hopefully everything will go fine and we expect everybody to support us.
00:37:25.466 - 00:37:27.046, Speaker B: And thank you very much, Jamie.
00:37:27.158 - 00:37:55.700, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I know there's a lot of interest in you guys as a consequence of being a key part of the polka dot ecosystem. I know the web3 foundation, I think, invested in you as well, gave you a grant. So I know there's a lot of hope and expectation that you're going to be a big driver for polka dot in the DFI context. So looking forward to watching your progress, Vivek, and I definitely recommend people kind of follow you on Twitter and stuff. What's your Twitter handle again?
