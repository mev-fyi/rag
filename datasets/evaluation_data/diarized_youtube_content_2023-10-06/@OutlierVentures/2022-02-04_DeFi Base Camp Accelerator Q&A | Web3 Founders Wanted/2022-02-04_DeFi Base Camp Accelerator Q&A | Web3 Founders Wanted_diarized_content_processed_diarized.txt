00:00:07.100 - 00:00:53.000, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us today. My name is Abdullah Al Majali and I'm the program manager of the Defi base camp program powered by New Order. We'd like to thank you for joining us for this program overview and AMA. And we have with us on the call our CEO, Jamie Burke, who will be walking us through outlier Ventures and what it is we do here at Ov. And we also have Amber. She from New Order will be walking us through what New Order do and how we're partnering together and the investment thesis we'll be following.
00:00:53.000 - 00:01:04.640, Speaker A: And we'll also be joined later on by Eden, one of the founders of New Order, who can answer some of your questions. So you have the floor, Jamie, everybody.
00:01:04.790 - 00:02:17.972, Speaker B: So thanks for showing up and really happy to answer any questions relating to this exciting new partnership of ours with New Order. As we just mentioned, Eden, who is one of the leads on this, is an outlier member. He actually used to run our token engineering practice and help develop a lot of our thinking around there and has gone on to do some really interesting things now in the defi space. So it's great to be collaborating with him and his team on this particular base camp. So, firstly, as outlive ventures, hopefully you've heard of us before. If not, we've been around for a while as an accelerator more recently. But overall, the last eight years we've been entirely dedicated to web three, its principles, and of course, a subset of that being DeFI DFI, perhaps one of the most important aspects of it in the context of being this inclusive, efficient financial system and set of rails to allow for greater levels of financial inclusion.
00:02:17.972 - 00:03:16.750, Speaker B: And yet, if we look at where DeFi is today, we're still a million miles away from that. Only a very small subset of even crypto are using it. And so that's something that we really want to address. As you may or may not know already, we run the base camp accelerator program. We're now running many of those concurrently or in parallel with specific protocols, so where we're working with protocols and their ecosystems on accelerating the most promising startups. That said, this is the first thematic accelerator that we've run previously, really, we're working with what's already in a protocols ecosystem, and that, of course, would include DeFi and things related to, say, nfts, and we've been doing that across Filecoin, Polkadot, Polygon. More recently, we just announced Hedera hashgraph, and we've got several other protocols on the way.
00:03:16.750 - 00:04:19.856, Speaker B: However, of course, DeFi is different. Working with a DeFi startup has slightly different dimensions, not just in a regulatory sense, but then also in the kind of service provision that we need to offer as an accelerator. One of the important things is that whilst our accelerator program is finite, the period of time that you're in that program is about three months. There's a huge amount of aftercare that is required afterwards, where we work with now growing portfolio of 100 plus startups to help them at all their various stages in the lifecycle. And again, a DFI protocols lifecycle looks very different to say an NFT one. And we'll talk a little bit later about the thesis. We actually see there's some interesting convergence between NFDFIs into something we call Metafi, but just kind of going back to the basecamp accelerator itself.
00:04:19.856 - 00:05:13.472, Speaker B: As I said, we've been doing it for some time now, and one of the benefits of having done this across multiple ecosystems is that we have a deep understanding of kind of the technical possibilities and limitations of different protocols in the context of DeFi. And also we've operated across cycles. So that's both bear markets and bull markets. We've helped projects raise hundreds of millions in seed capital. That's not including all the money that might then happen in public sales and various other things. And we've helped birth several billion dollar networks and consistently networks that go out at 250 to 500 million in network value. So we've been very successful working with teams at different stages in different geographies all around the world.
00:05:13.472 - 00:06:26.760, Speaker B: It's an entirely virtual program, and we actively seek out projects that are outside of the usual spheres of influence geographically and also from a kind of background perspective. So very keen to welcome people that are realizing or bringing DeFI to parts of the world that are underserved, coming back to that kind of purpose of us as an accelerator more generally around financial inclusion. So in combination, if you look at our network as outlier, we're about 100 full time staff now, or moving towards it, you can broadly break that out into two groups. Half of those are people that will help you with the usual stuff. You would expect an accelerator to do fundraising, structuring, go to market branding, marketing, hiring. On the other side, the other 50% are specialists specific to web three. And now DFI, which is everything from understanding how you might configure your technology stack with our technical analysts.
00:06:26.760 - 00:07:23.160, Speaker B: It might be token design, governance models, liquidity provision, regulatory and compliance. We've got in house securities laws, tax structuring, all the complexities of navigating web three and more specifically, DFI. We've got specialists on hand to help you with those subject matter questions. We've also got a very rich and deep partner network, and I'm pretty sure for any one of your requirements, we've got several partners that we could introduce you to. And in the rare instance that we don't, we're usually one or two degrees away from any individual or any organization in the space. We're connected to pretty much every leading founder protocol project in the space, and if relevant, we can kind of connect you to them. So it's not just the people at outlier, it's also the power of our partner network.
00:07:23.160 - 00:08:04.232, Speaker B: And again, I think this program is a great illustration of that, working more specifically and closely with a particular partner in delivering value within a particular subset. It is worth saying that we are active, whether it's a bull market or a bear market. We've been around for a long time. I think in the last crypto winter, 18 to 20, we were the most active investor in Europe by volume. We're not going anywhere. In fact, we find that our services are needed more in a bear market than perhaps a bull market. And as you say, there's a little bit more around kind of attention and building that happens.
00:08:04.232 - 00:08:30.620, Speaker B: And so we're here for you. Whatever the market condition, we're not going to go away. And so if you enter a program now, maybe you're a bit concerned about the markets and is now the right time to do it? Absolutely. I can almost guarantee you by the time that you graduate from the program, pretty sure the markets were back to where they were. And if they're not, we're still here. We'll still help you raise money and build out a success. We've had some projects like Biconomy, Bico.
00:08:30.620 - 00:08:56.344, Speaker B: We worked with them during the beginning of the last bear market in 2022. Years later, they built an amazing business, clients, partners revenue. Two years later they launched token economy. It went out at about 13, $14 billion network value. So great things can happen in a winter. So that's kind of really us as a business. Again, hopefully many of you already aware of us.
00:08:56.344 - 00:10:24.368, Speaker B: But more interesting than that, I think, is to kind of get into the specifics of the program, the people that you've been working with, and the kind of thesis. So I think this is where we will hand over, I guess, as a segue into that. Hopefully you would have already seen a paper we published January of last year, 21, on what we call the open metaverse Os. So that's where, based upon projects that we've been working with in 2020 and the kind of emergence of nfts in a startup context. Of course, nfts have been around for a long time as a technology set, but in terms of investable startups that started to come through into our accelerator in 2020, that led us to publish a paper January 2021 which predated the massive NFT bull run Facebook transitioning to become a metaverse company where we believed web three will be most impactful over the next decade as an infrastructure or an operating system for the metaverse to make it more open across all the dimensions that you can kind of see illustrated there. Whilst some of the detail and nuance is perhaps a bit outdated, a year later, the space moves very fast, the principles are still the same. And so that's kind of our north star now as a driving force of our thesis, but it's also how we look at DeFi, and that's something we call Metafi.
00:10:24.368 - 00:11:00.416, Speaker B: We published the metafi paper as kind of an evolution of the open metaverse os a couple of months ago now. So I highly recommend you read that we identify growth markets, asset classes, instruments, and missing foundational pieces of the metafi stack that we would love to work with in particular in this program. And I'm sure hopefully many of you will identify where you sit in the context of the metafi. I'm assuming this is the only slide we've got to talk about metify, right? So I get everything done here before we move in?
00:11:00.438 - 00:11:00.672, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:00.726 - 00:12:19.460, Speaker B: So maybe to kind of close off what we mean by Metafi and why we're excited by it, is that a lot of the attention post defi summer around where growth in DeFi is going to come from has been in the context of people thinking about CFI, DeFi bridges, how we bring more tradfi assets into DeFi. These are, of course, these are very exciting innovations. However, if you look at the regulatory tailwinds, especially in the US context, we believe as a startup it's going to be challenging to bring many of these things to market at scale. In the short term, we actually believe the primary area of growth and demand for Defi protocols and infrastructure is going to be coming from the metaverse in the context of nfts as collateral in all the shapes and forms that they might bring. And so this is kind of our vision. As I said, I'd recommend you read the Metafi paper. We break that down with much greater nuance.
00:12:19.460 - 00:12:45.730, Speaker B: Hopefully you identify as to where you are in that and we would love for you to apply. Now, that said, I don't want to put off people that are working on bridges, that are working on bringing tradfi assets into the space. We are absolutely interested in those too. But that is just kind of one section alongside all the other stuff. And this is where I'll hand over to the team to kind of give more nuance on the kind of areas that we're looking for specific to this program.
00:12:46.660 - 00:12:48.240, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Jamie.
00:12:48.740 - 00:12:57.460, Speaker B: One thing that's like, I think I have to dash imminently, so I will leave you in the hands of the team. I'll try and stick around for as long as I can, but I might just have to disappear.
00:12:58.200 - 00:12:59.620, Speaker A: Sure. Thank you, Jamie.
00:12:59.700 - 00:13:00.740, Speaker C: Thank you, Jamie.
00:13:00.900 - 00:13:41.140, Speaker A: So at Outlier Ventures we basically have two programs. One is our base camp program, which is for early stage startups that need to focus on token design, traction, fundraising and community. And we have the ascent program, which is more focused on further developed teams that have already raised venture funding and are about to launch a token what we'll be talking about today is the base camp program and particularly the Defi base camp program that we're launching alongside New Order, our partners. And to tell you a bit more about new order, I'll hand over to Amber.
00:13:41.480 - 00:14:44.120, Speaker C: Thank you Abdallah. So to tell you a bit more about what we do for founders at New Order, we are a permissionless, community led venture Dow really focusing on incubating the next generation of Defi projects. Our mission is to create a self governing incubator to support web three entrepreneurs and builders and help them launch their products and scale their business. Next slide. So collectively as a Dow, we believe in the future of DeFi that is multi chain with expansive on chain asset classes, and with Defi applications being increasingly data AI and machine learning driven. So we want to achieve this future by creating a platform that is let it governed by a community of Defi builders. We're working closely with many leaders in DeFi really to make sure we provide startups with the right resource network, technical know how, so on and so forth to fast track their growth and not just to deploy capital.
00:14:44.120 - 00:15:24.260, Speaker C: Our DAO is designed for maximum transparency. We're public facing DAO. Anyone's welcome to join and contribute. Your experience and the network collectively will make judgments on which projects will have the highest potential, makes the biggest impact, and best serve the future of DeFi. Those teams will get selected, get picked up by community, and go through our incubation. And how the DAO economics work is that as we incubate and launch new projects. The DAO treasury keeps diversifying its token allocation and keeps deploying assets into the forefront of DeFi.
00:15:24.260 - 00:16:07.110, Speaker C: And those teams, once they graduate, once they launch, they in turn become part of the ecosystem, become decision makers in the next wave of incubation. Next slide, please. So at new order, we have two programs, one for earlier stage founders, one for build later stage ventures. New Order Labs is how we help early stage DeFi applications. It can be as early as ideation stage. And the three projects listed here redacted h 20 and optify, they are really being built in house from the ground up and grew out of the core teams experience. We launched redacted last month.
00:16:07.110 - 00:16:57.964, Speaker C: It is a protocol owned liquidity solution that used the bonding mechanism of Olympus Dow and some key milestones, including raising $73 million at token generation event and acquiring Votemac. And the second one pipeline is h 20. It's a stable asset created in collaboration with ocean protocol and reflexal labs. It use a new digital asset class data token as collateral. That's a really pirating approach in terms of creating a stable asset. And it's scheduled to launch in less than two months. And the third one is optify, which is a machine learning based yield optimizer for DeFi evaluates thousands of yield strategies across protocol, across blockchain, across liquidity pools.
00:16:57.964 - 00:17:46.800, Speaker C: And it's still under development, but scheduled to launch the second quarter of this year. So a lot of exciting projects in the pipeline and if we have any founders in the audience and you have an idea what we should launch next, and we'd love to hear from you. So the second part of new order is that we are launching Defi Basecamp in partnership with Ally Adventures. We're really excited about this partnership for many reasons, one being that as Jimmy said, we resonate with each other's thesis. We definitely agree. Open Metaverse and a metafi thesis will be realized in near future of web three development as already see happening in Gamefi. And the DeFi we think will continue to grow as a backbone for all the digital economies as a DeFi increase utility of native tokens.
00:17:46.800 - 00:18:58.308, Speaker C: And I think all kinds of applications, not just DeFi application will continue to explore the further use case of NFT for user incentive. That's participation. And those two combined can be very powerful tool in terms of enabling the interoperabilities across different digital economies, not just the ones listed here and also beyond. So for Defi Basecamp, what we're looking for are projects working on solutions within this framework and across tech stack. Now OB has been running one of the most successful blockchain accelerators in this space since 2014 and they have a very comprehensive curriculum that helps founders to grow in many different ways. I think when you order brings to the table it's a group of hundreds of web three builders in our community on a core team and we have a network connecting to most of the D five players to have a closer look at thesis we are looking for founders who are building solutions that solve the existing pain points in DeFi. So particularly cross chain Defi protocols.
00:18:58.308 - 00:19:46.820, Speaker C: For that I'm thinking cross contract calling infrastructures, gas efficiency tools, EVM to non EVM bridges, so on and so forth. Also looking for Metafi applications, the ones that applying DeFi to open metaverse, maybe like further financial use cases on NFT and also projects that leverage other technologies like AI and machine learning. And it can be AI powered oracles or machine learning driven smart contracts. Those can be very exciting. And also looking for projects exploring the interaction between CFI and DeFi on chain. That can be any number of institution facing DeFi interfaces, permission, liquid pool, so on and so forth. And then we're also chain agnostic.
00:19:46.820 - 00:20:36.708, Speaker C: We welcome founders to apply regardless which blockchain you choose to build on. Okay, this is our ecosystem partner map. We just listed some of them. So as you can see we have partners across different sectors and across tech stack. And we understand how important it is for early stage founders to build a strong network if they were to launch a new DeFi project in this space. So we will help founders in Basecamp plug into both our industry network as well as our new order community. And in our community we have people who work closely with who are DJN D five founders, influencers, whales and market key opinion leaders.
00:20:36.708 - 00:21:16.580, Speaker C: And I think being able to be recognized by names like DCF, God, Tetronote, Maki, Zeus can be great signals for market validation, maybe even before vcs and early revenue. Not just because they have a huge following, also because I think they represent market judgment and wherever they take interest and the resource will follow. And we'll help founders to build those relationships. And I think most importantly in new order, we are a builder first community. We're not just a platform, not just a capital pool. We're project makers. And we're eager to work with talented web three founders.
00:21:16.580 - 00:21:43.630, Speaker C: Next slide. I think that's all. If you wish to join our community, just click the link here and our circular slides after this call as well. And our founder Eden is also on the call or he's going to join momentarily. It will be a great opportunity to ask questions and get connected with us. Thank you, I think. Abdallah, would you like to talk about the program yourself?
00:21:44.320 - 00:22:37.520, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, Amber. Thank you Jamie, for walking us through Ov and new order. What we'd like to do now is just to give you a quick overview on the DeFi basecamp program, how it's structured, and then we'll open up the floor for you to ask any questions you may have and we'd be happy to answer them. So what is Basecamp all about? Basecamp is built on top of three main pillars, process people and partners. So the process is really about helping you learn how to get stuff done. And on that, what we do is we connect you to a network of mentors who help you refine your vision and direction for your project and based on that, set goals and okrs which are tracked throughout the program.
00:22:37.520 - 00:23:25.788, Speaker A: And we continuously touch point with you to make sure you reflect and iterate on the goals and okrs. Second is people. So this is all about the community and ecosystem. And at ov, this consists of three main pillars for this particular program. Number one is the outlier ventures expert team, the new order network and our ecosystem of mentors. Of course, we can't do everything alone and web three and DFI are big spaces, so we definitely plug you into our partner network who can help you out as well. So this includes vcs, liquidity providers, enterprises and other projects, as well as our research partners.
00:23:25.788 - 00:24:35.792, Speaker A: So we'll give you a bit more information about each of those three pillars and then we'll tell you how you can apply. So starting with the first one process just high level, the program is divided into three phases. Phase one is about mentor madness. So this takes place over the first two weeks and what we do there is we focus first on onboarding you into the program. And over the two weeks you pitch to a number of different mentors, the new order team, the outlier Ventures teams, and based on what you pitch, you'll be given feedback by everyone, which is consolidated, synthesized and used to set your goals and okrs for the program. Also, at the end of mentor Madness, what we do is we match you to the mentors in our network that you're interested in working with and the mentors who are interested in working with you as well. So starting in week three, phase two, which is the knowledge building and execution phase, starts.
00:24:35.792 - 00:25:54.680, Speaker A: So here, as the name suggests, we focus on two things. Number one is building your knowledge and competencies and number two, helping you with execution and building. So this takes place through a lot of different founder Amas, where we invite founders from different d five protocols, as well as other web three projects to tell you about their experience building projects, the pitfalls, best practices and so on. As Jamie mentioned, we also have different teams within OV, such as the legal team, token design, tokenomics and fundraising, and quite a few others who will give you workshops to support you in their respective areas. And finally, in phase two, what we'll also help you with, and this is tailored to each team based on your needs, is helping you build out your product, helping you hire a team, helping you register your entity and set up bank accounts, and so on. So it's not limited to these points, but it's really about helping you build out your project and your platform. In phase three, which starts in week nine, we start focusing more on fundraising and liquidity sourcing.
00:25:54.680 - 00:27:00.468, Speaker A: So what we do here is we help you fine tune your pitch deck and we discuss with you the fundraising strategy you'd like to take, which means how much money you should be raising, what your Runway is and so on, and the means by which you want to raise funding, whether it's equity or a token, and how you go about doing that. We'll also help you design your liquidity mining program if you're a defi protocol that requires liquidity. And then we'll also introduce you to vcs and liquidity providers so you can get the funding and the liquidity you need for your protocol to function. Second is the people. So here at outlier, we have a multideisciplinary team, just a few members of the team here on board. You saw Jamie, who spoke a bit earlier today. We also have Aaron, who's our CTO, who has 15 years of tech experience and over five years in building blockchain tech products.
00:27:00.468 - 00:28:12.430, Speaker A: We also have a team consisting of Stefan, Rumi and Tim, who are ex tradfi bankers who have switched to crypto and Defi, and who can help you engineer any financial products you may want to create. In terms of our mentor network, we also have mentors across five main areas. Investors, sector experts, domain experts, connectors and founders. So the investors include most of the large blockchain focused vcs across the world, both in the Americas, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. And in terms of sector experts, these experts focus on a specific area, such as tech marketing, community building and so on. Our domain experts focus on a specific domain or a vertical. So we have Demi here, who's the co founder and CEO of Token Fabric and Pragmify, who's focused on tokenization of real world assets, for example.
00:28:12.430 - 00:29:25.490, Speaker A: We also have some connectors on board. So Simon, for example, these are people who have a big network who can connect you to different people based on your needs. So Simon, for example, has a big network of liquidity providers that he can help out with. And finally, as I mentioned before, we also invite founders to tell you more about their experience of building out their project. So for instance, Betty, the co founder of Akala, which is the Defi layer one built on top of Polkadot, is one of the founders that's on board as a mentor. Of course, all of this also includes the new order mentor network, as well as for our community. Without going into too much detail, it consists of everything around web three, whether it's blockchains, layer ones, layer twos, whether it's exchanges, centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, investors and liquidity providers, as well as other parts of the web three community like data platforms, token simulation companies, and so on.
00:29:25.490 - 00:30:20.724, Speaker A: So that's the base camp in a nutshell. And you must be wondering how you can apply to the base camp. So what we're looking for is eight to ten teams for the next cohort building the next generation of DFI protocols. So as Amber mentioned, we're really looking for teams building cross chain DeFi products utilizing composability across different chains. We're looking for teams building out Metafi, which is the application of DeFi to the open metaverse teams building at the intersection of DeFi and other technologies such as AI and machine learning, as well as teams bridging centralized finance with decentralized finance. And we're also, as Amber mentioned, blockchain and ecosystem agnostic. So we're open to anyone to apply.
00:30:20.724 - 00:31:11.712, Speaker A: And what we offer is $100,000 investment with an optional $250,000 follow on investment and a $30,000 repayable loan. And you can tap into both our in house experts as well as the OV and new order ecosystem and in terms of the application process. So the applications are currently open and you can apply using the link that you see here or by scanning the QR code. And this video will be saved online at this same link. So you can always access it and scan this QR code. But the deadline for the applications are on the 7 March. After that, we'll take a week to send out the final offers on the 14 March.
00:31:11.712 - 00:32:02.150, Speaker A: And the idea is for the program to also start on the 11 April. It'll run for twelve weeks and will end on the 1 July. And throughout that period we'll be reviewing your applications on a rolling basis, scheduling one to one meetings with you just to understand your projects a bit better. And if you're shortlisted, you'll basically pitch in front of our investment committee, which consists of members from the OV team, as well as members from the new Order team and community representatives from new order. And the final step would be conducting tech due diligence before we onboard you into the program. If you're interested, please click on the link ov. Click Slash DeFi to apply.
00:32:02.150 - 00:33:03.400, Speaker A: You can also scan the QR code and if you have any questions that you'd like to send after this and after the AMA, feel free to shoot me an email on Abdullah at outlierventures IO. Or you can book some office hours with us at ov. Click Slash DeFi meet with that, we've given you a comprehensive overview of the program and now it's time to hear from you, so please feel free to ask us any questions you'd like us to answer. There's an ask a question box which you can submit questions through. And I'd also like to invite Eden to join us on the stage. So I'm just getting him on the screen now and we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Sorry, just give me a second to get Eden on board.
00:33:03.400 - 00:34:07.500, Speaker A: Okay, so I've invited you, Eden, you should be able to join any second now. Okay, I'll try to answer some questions. In the meantime. Am I right that you are going to accept projects with as well as without tokens? Yes, definitely. So we accept both types of projects, projects raising funding through equity and with an equity registered entity, as well as projects that have a token and a token ecosystem. Is there an upfront cost for joining the camp? No, there's no upfront cost. Basically, our standard terms are the $100,000 investment in exchange for a certain percentage of tokens and equity, which we can walk you through when we have our office hours and when you apply on the website.
00:34:07.500 - 00:35:04.470, Speaker A: In terms of time commitment, what time commitment is needed per week? What we typically recommend is that at least one founder spends a good portion of their time on the program, so more than 50% of their time, and particularly that's needed in the first two weeks. After that, we sort of give you more space to build out your project and your product. So I'm just looking for questions for new order as well. So we have one here. While it has been stated on several occasions that the program is protocol agnostic. Is ovneworder opinionated at all with regards to which protocol we're building on Eden or Amber? Do you want to take that?
00:35:05.560 - 00:36:16.670, Speaker D: Yeah, sure, I'll take so. Well, obviously there's a lot of defi that has already evolved on Ethereum over the past few years. I think we're very interested in Solana Cosmos Polkadot based ecosystems, where basically we see a lot of TVL, a lot of assets that are locked up in these chains, but we don't necessarily see the type of DeFi applications and services that could sort of facilitate a wide variety of DeFi on those networks. So we're really interested in Solana Cosmos Polkadot definitely welcome rust based development. And we also see, we just think there's going to be an increasingly multi chain, cross chain, composable DeFi that's going to evolve. And so I think we are very interested in non Ethereum based DeFi just because that's the way we see DeFi evolving over the next year or two.
00:36:18.320 - 00:36:23.950, Speaker A: We also have a question about Tezos Eden and whether we're looking into teams building.
00:36:25.600 - 00:37:12.270, Speaker D: I mean, I think we'd explore know we're agnostic, right? I mean, if there's a really interesting use case, if it's a use case, for example, that maybe isn't oriented around cross chain composability, if it is actually furthering DeFi into new areas. We've talked about Metafi, but even like financialization of data, right, data know if the application itself is taking us and know sort of pushing the frontier of DeFi, I don't think we're going to know necessarily a ton of attention to what chain the application is built on.
00:37:14.240 - 00:37:23.040, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for that, Eden. We also have sean asking whether we will consider pseudonymous teams applicants.
00:37:24.420 - 00:38:47.710, Speaker D: So, yes, the answer is yes. I think that was a long discussion we had internally. Certainly new order is very open to anonymous teams, and in fact, we work with anonymous teams all the time and even have anonymous team members on new order. But I think we understand that there's a wide variety of reasons to be anonymous. I know from a legal compliance standpoint, we kind of see almost like three different layers of DeFi, one in which is just compliant with, let's say, SeC and US regulations, another layer that is regulatory compliant, but maybe not regulatory compliant with the US, and then a third sort of level where it is basically anonymous decentralized, not necessarily following any regulations, but is trying to serve a wide variety of sort of market, a big market that does sort of see the necessity or value in that service. And so those are often run by anonymous teams, and we see the value in that. So we're open to it.
00:38:47.710 - 00:39:06.050, Speaker D: What we concluded, I think, was that we would, as part of the application process, like to know who those anonymous people are, but of course, would strictly abide by maintaining their anonymity moving forward.
00:39:08.680 - 00:39:56.176, Speaker A: Great. Thanks for answering that, Eden. We have a question from Julia asking whether projects need an established legal entity to apply. So the answer to that is no, you can apply and join the program without having an established legal entity. And actually, one of the things we support you on is picking which jurisdiction to register a legal entity in, what the pros and cons of registering in different jurisdictions are. So we support you throughout that process. So I'm just looking through the list of questions in connection with the program.
00:39:56.176 - 00:40:09.270, Speaker A: Can ov slash new order help guide us on how to navigate the tricky regulatory landscape for DeFi as a team that wants to be compliant? Maybe Amber or Eden, you can take that one.
00:40:10.440 - 00:40:51.844, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think it's part of the program to provide support for legal compliance. On the new order side, we think we're very tapped in with a wide variety of jurisdictions and how to utilize and how to sort of create the right sort of corporate structure for you and then also just sort of provide insight on how you want to build your product in order to be compliant, as compliant as possible and what you need to look out for.
00:40:51.882 - 00:40:52.868, Speaker B: So, yeah, absolutely.
00:40:52.954 - 00:40:55.910, Speaker D: We're here to support on that level.
00:40:57.720 - 00:41:32.828, Speaker A: Thank you. We have some questions about the program logistics. So is the base camp virtual? Yes, the base camp is virtual. Another question is whether the program has restricted timelines and whether teams can apply earlier if they have a part of a product already ready. So applications are currently open. Teams can apply from today to the 7 March. Obviously, what we do is we select the most promising team from the applicant pools.
00:41:32.828 - 00:42:15.710, Speaker A: So that takes some time, which is why we need until the 7 march just to go through all the applications. And we typically receive more than 200 applications for each of our base camps. So just to give you an idea, out of which we select eight to ten. So it does take a bit of time. Of course, if we do make the selection early and we have time to finalize the contracting with everyone, and that's all done, we can definitely start the program early. Just going through the list of questions. So if we have an mvp already ready, should we wait? I think no, you can go ahead and apply.
00:42:15.710 - 00:42:41.910, Speaker A: As I mentioned, the applications are open. So feel free just to shoot your application our way. We've also received some questions via email prior to the session. So this one's for new order, which is. So what sets new order apart from other Defi focused venture dows? Or.
00:42:46.380 - 00:43:43.080, Speaker D: I mean, the premise of new order is to create a community venture model that's deploying resources rather than capital. Right. So we're seeing right now in the crypto space almost an overcapitalization. Right. And so capital in of itself is kind of a commoditized sort of resource right now. So this venture model that new order is presenting is a model where it is community based. It's an open, permissionless community where anybody can come and contribute to the community, basically get involved in what they believe should be sort of the future of DeFi, what projects should be built, and then also get involved in that incubation process and helping those projects become successful.
00:43:43.080 - 00:43:53.310, Speaker D: So we're highly community based. We're open, we're permissionless. The type of resources we provide.
00:43:57.760 - 00:43:58.076, Speaker A: What.
00:43:58.098 - 00:45:17.908, Speaker D: We'Re really trying to do is build alongside builders, right. And so we provide everything from smart contract development to assistance with security audits to running token engineering and token simulation. We also obviously help bootstrap community, bootstrap liquidity. And so we're here to kind of deploy resources that are going to further projects faster rather than just sort of be a passive capital provider. And by getting our hands dirty, by harnessing sort of a community of DFI builders and an ecosystem of DFI and web three projects, we create this sort of pool of resources that we could sort of start to aggregate behind projects to kind of further them faster. And so what we see in the future, in the near future, is projects launching with not just a lead vc in which they're sort of capturing, you could say that's where their fundraise is derived from. But also like a lead venture dow.
00:45:17.908 - 00:45:43.840, Speaker D: Right, where they're leveraging for community, for liquidity and various other supports. And so new order is really on a mission to kind of establish venture dows as sort of a new paradigm that builders can leverage.
00:45:47.280 - 00:46:25.976, Speaker A: Great, thank you. Thanks. That was very insightful. We have one question on finding co founders and talent. So finding co founders and talent feels like the biggest hurdle for me. What are some suggestions for pitching to the web three community to gather talent? Yeah, this is something we're definitely aware of and something that comes up quite often with our teams. So we know there's to onboard developers, especially in web three, it can be quite costly, so it's definitely one of the things that the program is designed to address.
00:46:25.976 - 00:46:58.740, Speaker A: So we help you out both with that upfront capital that would allow you to hire a team, at least for the duration of the program, until you can raise funding at the end of the program, which almost all of our teams that go through basecamp do. And we also help you out in finding the talent, hiring, connecting you with blockchain headhunters who can help you pinpoint the exact profiles you need to make your project successful.
00:46:59.640 - 00:47:47.750, Speaker D: I should add that new Order is also in the middle of creating a founder program where you can join us, kind of get involved in the incubation process of a project. And through this sort of program, there's the ability to kind of, I think, meet other founders, maybe get some matchmaking, sort of facilitated for you to find a co founder. So that's something to be on the lookout for as well. We should have something sort of built around that founder program in the coming weeks.
00:47:49.400 - 00:48:03.880, Speaker A: Great. Thanks, Eden. And to that point, we also got some questions in the office hours about how teams can leverage the new order network. So could you tell us a bit more about that, please?
00:48:04.030 - 00:48:24.610, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. So as I mentioned, new Order. The premise of New Order is to create a venture model that's aligned with builders and other web three and D five projects, right. And so by doing so.
00:48:27.220 - 00:48:27.756, Speaker A: What we're.
00:48:27.788 - 00:49:08.620, Speaker D: Trying to establish is a launch that solves kind of a cold start, right? A launch that's going to have a community that's going to build alongside you, and then also a community of users that are going to sort of launch with your service. Right. So at New Order, we've actually pre incubated three projects. We actually launched two months ago. So not that long ago, but in that process, we have three projects that we've pre incubated. One of them has launched. It's called Redacted.
00:49:08.620 - 00:50:04.384, Speaker D: Launched with a very successful TGE, raised $73 million. None of it was VC money, it's completely public community fundraise. We're also doing another project called H 20, which is a stable coin that will be backed by data tokens. We're doing that in partnership with Ocean and reflexor. And then lastly, optify. Optify is a multichain machine intelligent yield optimizer that plugs into over a dozen protocols to deliver the best yield for a particular asset in real time. So in incubating these projects, we actually built three communities, or helped to build three communities as well.
00:50:04.384 - 00:51:31.580, Speaker D: And so by having new Order sort of support your project, what we can do is get you exposure to this sort of, you can almost say this greater new Order community, which is really at this point, like four communities that can be leveraged to get behind your project. Right. And so there is a very sort of symbiotic relationship that we're creating with our ecosystem of incubated projects. And you could think of New Order as offering almost like a stack of communities that could get behind your project. So there's these communities that we've sort of incubated that we could plug you into. In addition to that, I think we uniquely have really strong relationships with a lot of anonymous founders, whales, influencers that we could plug you into and get behind your project and also give you a lot of unique insight. I think that is, well, that I think would be different in terms of how you would maybe build some strategy around in the d five space that would be uniquely different than the perspective that you might get from institutional players.
00:51:31.580 - 00:52:09.110, Speaker D: And then lastly, I would say that we've got very deep, long standing, well established relationships with a lot of web three and d five projects. And so the ability for us to kind of make introductions and facilitate partnerships again, to kind of ensure that we got this sort of momentum at launch, that's another thing that at New Order, we're sort of, I would say, uniquely positioned to do.
00:52:10.760 - 00:52:35.920, Speaker C: Yeah. Just to add to that, how teams can leverage on networking, also, we want to have a tailored approach for each team in the base camp. And based on what you need, we can connect you to the right person, the right resource, and we can even help you delegate some of tasks to the community through our internal system. And many people in our community is really eager to help, and almost all of them are from great DeFi background.
00:52:38.100 - 00:53:12.956, Speaker A: Thanks for that, Amber. Thank you, Eden. We have oas asking whether you need to have a team in place to get approved. No, you don't necessarily have to have a team in place. What we typically evaluate, we evaluate the team, but the team. So if there's a strong founder, it's something we would definitely consider and it's something we would also help you on. So the program is designed to help solo founders, and we have had solo founders go through the program before.
00:53:12.956 - 00:54:18.850, Speaker A: So to help solo founders build a team, if you're already a team, but a small team, missing some competencies. So, for example, you're very strong in tech, but you're missing a business angle. We'll help you refine that business angle and onboard some people who can take on role so we can help you through that process. And another question is, have we ever experimented with an in house software team to help semitechnical founders build out mvps? Yeah. So again, to my point in the previous question, it's something we help out teams with. So we try to help you out where you're weakest. So if you're a bit weaker on tech and development, we have Aaron, who leads our technical team, who can help you with that new order, also have a technical team in house who can have a look at what you're building, support you with that, connect you with builders and developers in the DeFi community who can support you.
00:54:18.850 - 00:54:47.410, Speaker A: So I think we've covered all the questions. Maybe I'll give it a minute just to see if anyone has any other questions. Okay. It doesn't look like it. Just before we disconnect, Amber Eden, do you have any closing remarks before we end for today?
00:54:49.140 - 00:56:04.650, Speaker D: Well, I think just know, obviously we're very excited about DeFi base camp, and I think it's a unique opportunity to sort of push the frontier of DFI. And I think this program, leveraging basecamp's sort of web three industry leading accelerator program, along with new orders, I think network of d five builders and dgens that are on the forefront. I think this program, I think, which is kind of a new addition to the base camp series, I think over the next year or so, we'll absolutely uncover some really valuable innovations. And so we are super excited to just get in touch with everybody that has that exciting project. And we'd love to hear from you. And obviously we're here to help, so encourage everybody to sort of reach out.
00:56:06.460 - 00:56:10.336, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for that, Eden. Go ahead, Amber.
00:56:10.468 - 00:56:16.270, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I'm just going to say, come join us, our discord, join our community, and check out what we're doing every day.
00:56:17.920 - 00:56:51.396, Speaker A: Great. Thanks a lot. I'd like to thank Eden, Amber, Jamie, for walking us through outlier ventures, new order and the base camp today. And I'd like to thank everyone who tuned in to hear about the Defi base camp. We're looking forward to the base camp and we're looking forward to receiving all your applications. So I'll just go one slide back to show you. Here's the application link.
00:56:51.396 - 00:56:58.230, Speaker A: Please feel free to send across your application. And thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Bye, everyone.
00:56:58.640 - 00:57:00.280, Speaker D: Thank you, everybody. Bye.
