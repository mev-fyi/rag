00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.840, Speaker A: I want my mom, who's 82, to be in the metaverse buying stuff, connecting with my son, her grandson, interacting in that space. And I don't think that future is that far away to, to interact where he can hold her hand in that metaverse, take it into a shopping list, and she buys something for him.
00:00:31.530 - 00:00:39.570, Speaker B: Okay. So today I'm really happy to welcome on the Metaverse show Thomas Kang, vice president and general manager at store number eight. Welcome, Thomas.
00:00:39.650 - 00:00:40.802, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much.
00:00:40.876 - 00:01:29.210, Speaker B: So I believe I can call you Tom throughout this. So store number eight. Correct me if I'm wrong, it is an incubation arm of Walmart. Still, today's the world's largest retailer effectively looks at supporting self contained companies that benefit from startup speed and enterprise scale, ultimately with a goal of enriching the lives of Walmart customers and its partner network. A number of reasons why we've got you on the show, of course, we've just launched and are recruiting for a base camp program that we're running together, which is store number eight. Basecamp, along with a venture partner called synergist Capital, will kind of talk through the kind of shared thesis there, looking at the future of retail and e commerce. And of course, you are effectively the sponsor of that initiative, leading store number eight.
00:01:29.210 - 00:02:04.622, Speaker B: We also have a very interesting background as well beyond that, both in the world of digital media and technology. A serial entrepreneur with a couple of exits, including various senior roles at Amazon, Amazon games, Amazon Web services, and I believe, an exit to Disney. But we'll get into that just shortly. So firstly, welcome on the show and of course, thanks for this kind of brilliant program that we're running together. Maybe let's learn a little bit about you, Tom, your kind of background. I alluded to some of it there. How did you end up at store number eight? What's your journey?
00:02:04.686 - 00:02:24.780, Speaker A: I'm passionate about video games. My family comes from Korea. It's a farming family. Went to Korea every summer throughout my childhood, through my high school years. And there's nothing to do on the farm other than go to the video game arcades and play video games. So that's how I got really into this space of interactive digital entertainment. Fast forward multiple number of years.
00:02:24.780 - 00:03:25.658, Speaker A: I played a bunch of roles in corporate at ExxonMobil, big oil in M A. But my good friend Alex Ropian, who I went to college with, who's the co creator of Halo, asked me to help look at his company because he had just sold his company to Microsoft. We created a partnership creating original IP for Disney. And then Disney came calling and said, we'd love to have an organization that could create original ip in an environment where it's very hard to create original ip at Disney through the interactive digital media. And so that's where my entire journey with games and digital media kind of started me and about 25 people left because I had a small epiphany about trying to connect games to causes and created a company called Zigzag Zoom, where if you do something in a game, something good happens in the world. And then I ended up at Amazon Web Services to help gamers convert to AWS. And then from there, I became the head of strategy business development investments for the entire games organization.
00:03:25.658 - 00:03:37.234, Speaker A: I wanted to be an environment where I could really invent and be innovative. I love zero to one problems without having to raise money all the time. As you know, so much of my life in my prior startup had been dedicated to raising money.
00:03:37.272 - 00:04:49.978, Speaker B: And so it's actually really funny because you're the second recording I've done today, and both are with people in very senior roles in very large organizations that self identify as gamers first. And it's really interesting that there is now this generation of gamers that are leading strategy at some of the world's leading organizations. Actually, both of you are kind of looking at this in the context of the metaverse as well. So obviously, the kind of vision for the Metaverse is decades old now, but it's interesting that we're starting to have an executive class of people that are kind of coming with that mindset, that philosophy, and think like gamers. And I know off air you were saying that you have an embarrassingly large collection of virtual goods in the tens of thousands of dollars. And so naturally you understand the benefit, the concepts of digital property and the potential of digital property rights. And I know that, of course, whilst our collaboration is very much focused on enabling or applying web three primitives and innovations, I know you kind of see the metaverse much more broadly than that.
00:04:49.978 - 00:05:02.894, Speaker B: So could you kind of just talk through that spectrum how you understand the role of web three versus, say, environments which might be more closed and limited to a particular platform?
00:05:03.012 - 00:05:56.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I really believe in the metaverse as a consumer metaverse. I coined the term within my team, metaverse for everyone. Metaverse is still a very kind of mysterious term to people, and everybody defines it in whatever way they'd like to define it. I want to define it in ways where it has actual meaning and utility to people. So it's really about 3d virtual spaces it's about where people are spending time playing games, connecting socially, and there are lots of things around it that can enable that ecosystem, including blockchain, cryptocurrency, nfts, when it comes to kind of the ownership and the commerce aspect of it. Because as you alluded to before, I've been buying virtual goods. I played maple story and Cartwrighter, which are games, the early progenitors of the free to play space coming out of Korea.
00:05:56.922 - 00:06:38.874, Speaker A: Right? And so the notion of virtual good purchases has been here for over a decade. There is no reason that people are not going to buy physical goods in these spaces and also potentially connect their virtual lives to their physical lives. So I really think the whole thesis is that current and next generation of people are going to be spending more time in these spaces, and we don't want to replace their physical lives. We want to connect it to virtual lives and kind of have this 360 degree ecosystem where it's a continuum of kind of where they spend their time and attention and money.
00:06:38.912 - 00:07:12.022, Speaker B: And to what extent, because we're very much kind of talking about, I guess, this blurring of gaming becoming increasingly a social media. People aren't necessarily there just to play a game, they're there to socialize. And by virtue of that, the opportunity to extend, I guess, social commerce and to enable brands to kind of have a presence there. To what extent are you also looking at innovations in augmented reality where it's kind of layers of reality on top of kind of the normal experience?
00:07:12.156 - 00:07:23.238, Speaker A: There are, I think, about 15 billion devices in the world that are connected to the Internet. I would like to be able to enable people to enter our metaverse ecosystem with just the modern browser.
00:07:23.334 - 00:07:57.682, Speaker B: When people think about immersive experiences, it can be somewhere on the XR spectrum. But I think that point around, effectively accessibility, right? If there's a hardware barrier, then there's a cost barrier, then effectively you're financially excluding people from the system as it goes from just entertainment into a digital economy, a virtual economy where you can earn an income. If the barrier to that is too high for most people to participate, then effectively you're excluding huge parts of the population, right?
00:07:57.736 - 00:08:23.742, Speaker A: The majority. It's also kind of a technology barrier, right? It's hardware and technology. We don't want people to have to learn a lot of stuff. I want my mom, who's 82, to be in the metaverse, buying stuff, connecting with my son, her grandson, interacting in that space. And I don't think that future is that far away to interact where he can hold her hand in that metaverse, take it into a shopping list, and she buys something for him.
00:08:23.796 - 00:08:48.578, Speaker B: So when we look at that spectrum of participant user or kind of the population, and it's spanning these kind of demographics, obviously they require slightly different experiences, and there's kind of these considerations around safety and creating a safer environment for consumer metaverse. How do you consider these things? As a large corporation like Walmart and.
00:08:48.584 - 00:09:29.954, Speaker A: I worked at Disney, and you could imagine trust and safety was a very important factor there. I believe in order to be a leader in the metaverse and metaverse commerce, we have to be leaders in trust and safety in the metaverse. And it's still the wild, wild west. I think store number eight and Walmart has an opportunity to become the best of trust and safety in the metaverse to create a safe environment. I already talked about accessibility and inclusiveness in the metaverse we're trying to build. So I want to make sure that an environment is trusted and safe for everybody. So this requires a mixture of policies, technologies, and just investment in people.
00:09:29.954 - 00:10:10.078, Speaker A: And as we develop this plan for the future, I think this is an area where we have some tenets related to where we are going with metaverse commerce. This is a very important tenet that we're going to be thinking about as we build our business over time. And by the way, I think it's great for ROI. I have a twelve year old and a 15 year old. I want to send them to social spaces that I believe are safe. I want, want to make sure when I partner with brands that they know that their brands are going to be good stewards of their brand. There's going to be no piracy, there's going to be no unauthorized use.
00:10:10.078 - 00:10:16.606, Speaker A: So I think it's good for business. So investing in trust and safety, I think is high ROI.
00:10:16.718 - 00:10:32.962, Speaker B: We're talking about virtual goods, and obviously that can mean any number of things you mentioned, I guess, in game items and stuff like that. Could you talk us through that spectrum where you're seeing, I guess, the most traction or the most revenue opportunity in the short to midterm?
00:10:33.026 - 00:11:53.734, Speaker A: I think we all know as gamers the place that is personalization has always been at the front and the front forefront of kind of where games and avatars are here. So I really think the first fashion and apparel and digital fashion is an area where we're really looking at deeply, because once again, it's a behavior that exists already, and there's a vibrant economy, virtual economy, that exists already. So how do we think about that in the context of who Walmart is. How do we, for example, take our physical brands and make them virtual? That's a whole new revenue stream and a new economy. How do we use virtual worlds and virtual items to inform what we make physically? Does that make sense to you? Eliminate waste, to be very targeted about what people might like. So I think that's a space we're really focusing on. We always also entertainment, music, as you all know, we all know about the big concerts that happened in Fortnite, where millions of people came and watched at the same time and socialized.
00:11:53.734 - 00:12:27.782, Speaker A: So we also think there's a great way to engage people through music and entertainment in kind of these metaverse worlds to create communities and think about commerce related to entertainment and music. If you think about a brand like Disney, there's a huge catalog of potential things people collect and buy related to ips. And so we really like the focus of, like I said, like fashion and entertainment being kind of the initial areas where we explore.
00:12:27.846 - 00:13:15.114, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that point around sustainability is key as well. We've seen already, even before this program, a number of startups that have gone through previous programs focused on virtual goods or digiphysical goods can have a more sustainable supply chain. They can reduce waste. And I know this is an area of focus within the program thesis as well, this kind of co creation where you can effectively create a feedback loop with the user, the end user, to inform product development. So when you actually roll out a product at the scale that you guys can, you have kind of great assurity. It's what people want, right? And therefore significantly reducing waste, improving efficiency, effectiveness and stuff like that.
00:13:15.152 - 00:13:24.042, Speaker A: As corporate citizens, that's very, very important to me and I know it is to Walmart. So I think the ability to impact in that way, we'd all be proud of that.
00:13:24.096 - 00:13:41.422, Speaker B: To what extent? Because I know this is a focus area for the program as well, is this kind of convergence of AI and blockchain? Obviously, there's a lot of hype around generative AI and AI tooling. How are you guys thinking about that in the context of the metaverse? Where might it converge and impact?
00:13:41.486 - 00:14:21.998, Speaker A: So in two ways, it is a buzword and it's in its height of its hype cycle today. But we'd like to think of it in very practical terms. I like AI in the form of the ability to create content, because the cost of content creation is very expensive and very hard. Imagine the example that I gave you about creating apparel like fashion, digital fashion design. A big part of the metaverse to me is also about user generated content. That whole economy is going to involve people creating virtual items and selling them. Right.
00:14:21.998 - 00:15:08.574, Speaker A: And Walmart powering all that. You know, the ability for generative AI to enable people to create digital fashion I think is a fascinating area we're really exploring. The second area is in trust and safety and content moderation. Once again, I already said we are going to be a global leader in trust and safety in the metaverse. No, moderation and trust and safety is perfect, as you know. But we can use technology like generative AI and AI to dramatically create efficiencies around how we do that. And as our database grows and experience grows, it can get better and better.
00:15:08.612 - 00:15:47.862, Speaker B: Yeah. And I guess nobody more than you appreciates the potential, having worked at Disney and with Disney for how, from a content perspective, how the production process can, I guess, really shift from this industrial know, hundreds of people, several years, hundreds of millions to create content, whether it's a game or a Hollywood blockbuster movie, it's pretty much the same now, right, in terms of cost and people power. And then here, effectively, you can dramatically reduce down the time to kind of produce that content. And then, as you say, allow even people to take it one step further, personalize, adapt and refine.
00:15:47.926 - 00:16:18.178, Speaker A: Being at Disney, I saw both tv and film production as well as game, and same with Amazon as well. They do both with Prime Video. And actually games are becoming more expensive than movies. Right. And so I really think the ability for AI and generative AI to enable that, you're going to see Stepfold innovations happening in that space in the next five years. And so we want to make sure we're on top of that because as I mentioned before, I'm a big believer in user generated content.
00:16:18.264 - 00:16:46.446, Speaker B: Yeah. And that kind of comes back to the theme around co creation as well. Right? So even reinventing what is a brand, we're seeing a lot of native brands born in the metaverse. By default, they're effectively community generated. But it is interesting to think about if you're a large ip conglomerate, how you can begin to open up that process to kind of fans fandom and have them as a more active participant, I guess, in the process.
00:16:46.548 - 00:17:39.918, Speaker A: I think there's going to be big paradigm shifts in the future, and I think how we view commerce could shift. And that's why story exists, right? How do people engage with brands? For example, my son is a crazy baseball player. Is he going to go to a dick's or a sporting goods store in the metaverse? Or is he going to go to a space where people who love baseball bats hang out, does that make sense? Where brands happen to exist and brands happen to create their entertaining experiences. And so all these people who love baseball bats are socializing and talking about the merits of a bat in the social space where there are commerce opportunities. So these paradigm shifts, I think, are going to happen over time, and we want to be there, we want to lead it. Yeah.
00:17:39.924 - 00:18:38.766, Speaker B: And I think that's one of the really exciting things about the program that we're running is because whilst there are some specific pillars that we're looking at, so four main ones, as I understand it, commerce, infrastructure, data and growth solutions, including the kind of social component, CRM and marketing suite, immersive experiences, which I think we've talked about everything from gaming through to kind of co creation and then this AI plus blockchain stack, as we mentioned, from moderation to user generated content. Above all of that, I guess, is this thing that we're mutually exploring together along with our venture partner, which is what does the supply chain of the future look like in the context of the metaverse? And I know some people have referred to it as direct to avatar, for example, how are you guys as an organization thinking about that shift, both in disruptive terms as well as kind of transformative terms, to Walmart?
00:18:38.878 - 00:19:53.962, Speaker A: We're a commerce company, and so we want to focus on the things we're very good at, which is creating the ability for people to conduct commerce in that environment. Does that make sense? And we want to enable that in many ways over time. It's obviously, we know how it happens today physically, if we want to make it happen virtually and in the future, it could happen in different ways. You and I discussed enabled by blockchain and cryptocurrencies and nfts, right? So we want to power that commerce and enable people to do that in very convenient and efficient ways. The other interesting advantage we have, and I'm a little straying a little here, is that, as you know, Walmart is within 10 miles of 90% of Americans, right? There's massive opportunity to connect kind of the virtual and physical elements of this as well, where the experience, you go to the store and you experience something that enables you to, or creates some incentive to do something virtually and that is connected. So as I mentioned before, connecting that virtual and physical ecosystem is very interesting to us. And enabling commerce all around that to bring convenience to customers is really important for us.
00:19:53.962 - 00:20:02.010, Speaker A: And I think we're very well positioned to do that because we have this large physical footprint as well as a vibrant ecommerce community.
00:20:02.080 - 00:20:31.782, Speaker B: Yeah. And for me, I think that's the key thing. That's why for us, there's no better partner to do this with. Because ultimately, for me, the metaverse is when the kind of physical and additional become indistinguishable from one another. It has to be this kind of seamless experience, as you say, where you can purchase something physically in a virtual sense. Many people assumed that ecommerce would totally replace the need for any physical retail outlet. And actually, we've seen that's just not the case.
00:20:31.782 - 00:20:45.110, Speaker B: Right. If anything, there's a resurgence of physical retail and so it's much more dynamic than kind of just one medium or one distribution channel replacing another entirely.
00:20:45.190 - 00:21:20.342, Speaker A: The other thing I need to mention is, as I said, we're focusing on commerce and why we're well positioned. The other element is we're trusted. People trust us to conduct commerce with us. We're talking about payments, right? We're talking about the ability to provide information and have an organization which is going to trust their information, like guard it and make it safe. And so that's why I think we're very well positioned to kind of connect this virtual and physical economy because to a large extent it's already happening today. Right. I'm just expanding that and connecting it.
00:21:20.342 - 00:21:43.290, Speaker A: So in many ways, I view metaverse commerce as long term over time, and story looks in long term horizons as could be a connective tissue to all of that. Does that make sense to you? It connects really the social, ecom and physical commerce into this kind of continuum of an experience which touches the consumer.
00:21:43.370 - 00:22:31.162, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that point around trust is really key because as I mentioned in, I think the second of the four pillars, data and data solutions that can ensure privacy. Whilst people will want to transact with brands, with retailers, with one another, across different virtual spaces, and then also in a physical sense, they want that to be seamless. And to do that, they need to be able to trust the identity solutions, the kind of way that various metadata, transactional data, buying data is associated to that. So that presents a huge opportunity. And again, it helps if you're a trusted player coming to the table with that. So, look, Tom, it's been a real pleasure having you on, as I said, very excited about having launched this program with you.
00:22:31.162 - 00:23:09.270, Speaker B: I believe applications are still live. As I said, at the top. Not only do you get to work with outlier ventures who can help you with this kind of 360 of understanding web, three business models, technology innovation, you obviously get to work with store number eight and all that brings with it, which Tom's done a great job of articulating. And of course, we also have that additional venture partner, synchronous capital, who I believe is very close to the Walmart organization. And so combined, I think it's a real dream team to be able to exploring the future of metaverse commerce. So, Tom, real pleasure chatting to you. Thanks for your insights and really excited about this program.
00:23:09.340 - 00:23:19.446, Speaker A: Likewise. Thank you. I think the program is very exciting, and great ideas come from entrepreneurs. Right. People who have no boundaries, who can think. If you can think it, it's real. Right.
00:23:19.446 - 00:23:21.760, Speaker A: So really excited to partner with you.
