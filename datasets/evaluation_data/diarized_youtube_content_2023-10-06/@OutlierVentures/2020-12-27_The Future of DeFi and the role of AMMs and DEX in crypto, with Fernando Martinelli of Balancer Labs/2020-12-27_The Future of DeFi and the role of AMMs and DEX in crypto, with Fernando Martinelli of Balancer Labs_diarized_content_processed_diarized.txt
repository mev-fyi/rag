So today I'm happy to welcome on Fernando Martinelli, CEO and founder of Balancer.
00:00:52.378 - 00:00:56.206, Speaker B: Welcome, Fernando. Thank you for having me, Jamie. Nice to be here.
00:00:56.308 - 00:02:12.280, Speaker A: So Balancer is a protocol for programmable liquidity, as it would imply. It's a DeFi protocol project, and we'll unpack a little bit about what we mean by that as the show goes on. So the reasons why I've got you on the show DFI continues to be a hot topic, but obviously it feels like we're moving into a kind of new phase of DFI. You might call it DFI 2.0, but certainly an evolution from what we've seen in the summer of 2020. And so I want to take the opportunity to explore the role of Dexes and Amas in crypto. And of course, you guys are making great traction as a project, and several portfolio companies of ours are looking at collaborating with you in particular around your lbps, which we'll again talk about a little bit later, launching of new tokens, allowing for price discovery and all these kind of good things.
00:02:12.280 - 00:03:29.230, Speaker A: And equally, several other projects, reputable projects in space, have leveraged you from appy finance to ensure. And I also want to kind of get your wider perspective on DeFi, its direction of travel and wider adoption in both a retail and institutional context. To give a summary of your kind of origin story, from what I could see, you've had quite a diverse background. So originally you studied robotics and image processing at several different academic institutions in Italy. From what I could see, you then did an MBA in France at the University of Pantheon, Sabon, which we're on scholarship from Renault. You've worked at Airbus in the flight control department, modeling actuation technologies, and you've worked at WEG in meteorology, including conception, validation of high precision laser sensing measurement systems. Maybe we pause there because then there's some other stuff that comes after it, but maybe we kind of just touch a little bit on that background.
00:03:32.850 - 00:04:05.114, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I'm an engineer and always love to solve problems and also have some of the entrepreneurial spirit that I think founders share. So we always wanted to solve problems that we have and we see that are not solved yet. And I started that when I was 14 years old. I was addicted to counterstrike. I think it still exists. Right, but that's a long time ago.
00:04:05.114 - 00:04:21.040, Speaker B: It was already like a frenzy, and I realized that there was a lot more demand than supply. So I started this cyber cafe with 22 computers, and that was very successful, very profitable. So it kind of gave me. This.
00:04:22.770 - 00:04:23.870, Speaker A: Was in Brazil, right?
00:04:23.940 - 00:05:03.154, Speaker B: Being an entrepreneur, that was in Brazil. When I was 14, I started that. And, yeah, actually it was under my father's name because I couldn't start a company so young. But anyways, I did all the planning and configuring the machines and everything. But, yeah, I kind of went on and created other companies, studied, did an MBA and something you had mentioned. I worked as a strategy consultant at Bain company in Germany. So, yeah, lived quite a bit in Europe and ended up going back to Brazil.
00:05:03.154 - 00:06:10.850, Speaker B: Now I live in Europe again, kind of maybe how crypto fits into this. Sorry if I may talk about that. I was introduced to bitcoin early or late 2012, and I thought it was a Ponzi scheme like I think most people do or did. And then I looked again and again, and the third time I realized the depth of the revolution that it would cause and got really interested. And then I realized that and kind of a segue into how I think about crypto in general and why I'm an ethereum in the first place, I believe, and it's still the case that mass adoption will come with stablecoins. I think stablecoins are very important, and USDT and Dai like all of them, like having more than a billion dollars in USDT, so much more than that. It's proof that people really want to have stable coins on Ethereum or on crypto networks in general.
00:06:10.850 - 00:07:36.602, Speaker B: So, yeah, that led me to realize how powerful Ethereum was when the white paper came out, because I straightaway realized that having smart contracts would allow you to create a stable coin, to have positions and debts and being liquidated. And when I saw Makerdow early in 2015, I heard about them, it really struck me like, this is going to be something big. And I got involved. I collaborated with a team when there were still, like a few people. And yeah, this is kind of how my passion for crypto started and maybe kind of going to how balancer was created or how the idea came about. It was 2017 and early 2018, I was looking at all the discussions around Amms and this threads that Alan Liu and Vitalik were discussing on like x times Y equals k, this constant function that's preserved. And what I found interesting about that function and the idea of Amms wasn't so much the fact that it was allowing exchanges or decentralized exchanges to happen, but I looked at it from another lens, and it was the fact that it rebalanced automatically the two assets that you put into that Amm.
00:07:36.602 - 00:08:42.366, Speaker B: That was a very simple one, which actually later on, Uniswap launched with. So x times Y equals k means that whatever pool you create, you always have the same amount of value on both sides in dollars or whatever measure you have. So you have kind of a portfolio management system that makes sure that you always have 50% of each of the two assets. This is not so interesting from the portfolio management perspective, or hedging or exposure to risk, because you can't really control those weights, or you can't really add more tokens. So that was what intrigued me back then, and I looked at this formula, x times y equals k, and spent a few months doing some crazy thought experiments, and ended up with a value function that we use for balancer, which allows you to have the same idea of rebalancing a portfolio, but with all the flexibility of choosing weights and also having more than two tokens. So you can have like five tokens, and you say, I want to have ten and 60. So that's the idea of balancer.
00:08:42.366 - 00:08:45.714, Speaker B: It's like this programmable liquidity protocol. Yeah.
00:08:45.752 - 00:09:19.818, Speaker A: And maybe just for listeners that perhaps aren't as familiar with Defi, and in particular how a Dex decentralized exchange might function effectively, the automated market maker replaces where you would have previously had an order book on a centralized exchange. So you mentioned being inspired or building upon work, both from Vitalik and then of course, as you say, from some of the first decentralized exchanges that come out, I see there was also a reference to Zargam. Is that Michael Zargam?
00:09:19.914 - 00:09:44.742, Speaker B: Yes, that's Michael Zargam. So, yeah, I just shortened a bit the story, but Balancer was born in collaboration with blockscience. I was working with blockscience and Michael Zargham, and this is where the balancer idea was incubated. So, yeah, I owe a lot to Zargim and the whole block science team.
00:09:44.876 - 00:10:24.686, Speaker A: Yeah, Zargim is a good friend of outliers. We've worked with block science on a number of different token designs, and they of course, big pioneers in the token engineering community. So interesting to see the connection. I wasn't aware of that previously. So as you say, that then enables portfolio management, liquidity provision and also the potential for kind of indices. Could you just talk us through oracles? Oracles, right. Could you maybe talk us through what this then balance this kind of innovation then enables?
00:10:24.798 - 00:11:31.510, Speaker B: Sure. So yeah, you can think of balancer. That's something that is only possible with smart contracts and trustlessness. You can think of kind of a mixture or hybrid of fidelity that offers index funds and Nasdaq that offers exchange between shares or stocks. So the idea is that being a trustless protocol and using smart contracts, you can sell or let people buy what you want to sell by setting up the right price. So it sounds a bit complicated, but the idea is that if you have two tokens and one of the tokens goes up, the price that your amm is offering doesn't change until someone trades with it. As someone buys the asset that went up, then that works as like a feedback control loop where as you have less of those tokens in that pool, that gets more expensive.
00:11:31.510 - 00:12:30.298, Speaker B: So actually the market itself, the arbitragers that are looking at all the prices in all markets like taxes and sexes, whatnot, they see that you're lagging behind a little bit and offering that asset that went up for a bit less and then people can buy it and that kind of corrects the price. So that's the underlying mechanism. The amount of innovation or things that you can build on top of that is really kind of hard to describe how much design space you have. And I think the main difference, and you pointed at that, jen, you talked about order books being an alternative to amms. I think the main interesting point to stress here is that order books have to be actively maintained. Right. If you want to market make and market making, maybe one step back is like you're selling for, let's say, $10 and you're buying for eight.
00:12:30.298 - 00:13:13.174, Speaker B: So there you're market making, you're kind of selling and buying. You're not holding just one of the positions, but you're really making money on the volatility. That's what market making means. If you want to market make on order books, you have to have infrastructure. You have to have a server that makes sure that you're not keeping orders that are stale, that are out of sync with the market. So the main difference between order books and amms is that order books require this infrastructure that you have to maintain and make sure it's live and up 99.9% of the time, because you have to make sure that as prices move, so do your orders.
00:13:13.174 - 00:14:20.430, Speaker B: So if price went up from ten to 20, your orders have to be 21 sell and 19 buy. The difference between amms and order books is that amms are like the lazy way of market making. Actually, you don't need to update the orders on an order book because you just put money into an amm, into balance or uniswap or dodo or whatever, and those protocols are responsible for setting the right prices at the right moments. So the protocol itself sells for a little bit more than the market price and buys for a little bit less, which means that over time, when there's volatility, prices go up and down. You're going to make money because you provided liquidity. So that's kind of the main difference between order book based exchanges and ordexes and amms. So yeah, it kind of opened the floodgate for lots of small people who just want to participate in market making, but they wouldn't have the chance to have infrastructure or keep orders on decentralized exchanges.
00:14:20.430 - 00:14:59.222, Speaker B: They just provide liquidity to balancer and just forget about it. And then at the end of a year, they collected a lot of fees. And that comes with the caveat, of course, that we should all mention working with amms, which is called the impermanent loss risk. And I think, yeah, that's kind of another topic in and of itself. But it's something that I always like to mention when I talk about the fees you collect. You also have that risk, which some people see as kind of a loss. And I see more like as an inherent consequence of rebalancing.
00:14:59.222 - 00:15:56.586, Speaker B: So if you don't want to be overexposed, if you have two assets and one of them goes up, like, let's say you start 50, 51 of them skyrockets relative to the other, you would end up with 90 10% of your portfolio, which is dangerous, because if that 90% of your portfolio token just crashes or there's like a hack, you lose 90% of your portfolio. Right? So rebalancing inherently sells what's going up over time. And the fact that you start selling when the price was low, one to one, and then as the price goes up, you keep selling, keep selling. Then when the price is a lot higher, in that example, 90, ten, like nine times more expensive, you just would have more money. If you look at the nominal value, the face value, if you had held all those tokens that you sold along the way, but no one knew that it would go to nine and then stay up there. It could go back. So that's why it's called impermanent loss.
00:15:56.586 - 00:16:09.700, Speaker B: It's really like you can't read the future. So, yeah, a way to make sure you're hedging risk is to rebalance. And that's why the name is balancer. That's where it comes.
00:16:12.150 - 00:16:32.442, Speaker A: So what are the other limitations or constraints of an amm or a Dex generally? And do you think that crypto needs both dexes and sexes? And if so, how do they interact? And what's your view on that?
00:16:32.576 - 00:17:13.686, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think today definitely both are needed, maybe two main reasons. First is scalability and user experience. Saxes have a much better user experience because they're fast and it's just web two, it's just APIs, fast servers, so you can do lots of trades and it costs nothing. Right? So they're scalable, which today decentralized exchanges are not. Unfortunately, the other reason why they need to exist today is regulation. For many funds or institutions, they have to know who they're trading with.
00:17:13.686 - 00:18:07.270, Speaker B: If they go to an exchange, a centralized exchange, the centralized exchange is kind of facilitating all the regulatory kind of environment that an institution needs to buy and sell. If you go to a Dax, it's just like a protocol, it's a smart contract, you have no idea who the counterpart is. So for some use cases, that's a challenge. So I think that today we still need both saxes and daxis, but as we have more scalability, e 2.0 and other layer ones that are promising, who knows? I think ethereum has a very big kind of head start here. So as I said, I'm an ethereum, I'm an ethereum fan, but I never like to dismiss the chances of other layer ones being successful. And maybe I don't think this is a winner takes all market.
00:18:07.270 - 00:19:08.182, Speaker B: I think there might be many or maybe a few layer ones that are kind of niche and still very successful and very big. But I think that as we solve scalability and the regulatory kind of environment gets better and regulators understand better crypto and have clearer rules. I really don't see a future where centralized exchanges need to exist because it's just like an inferior, like if you have all the advantages of saxis, like scalability, so user experience, everything can be emulated on dexis, and that can still be non custodial, that's much better, right? I think the key here is that if you go to a centralized exchange. You have to send them your crypto, it's not yours anymore. And if they get hacked or the company just rug pulls you, you lose all your money. And of course, there's contract risk. And if you go to a Dex, that can also happen tomorrow.
00:19:08.182 - 00:19:59.100, Speaker B: There could be a bug on balancer or on uniswap, for that matter. But that gets less and less likely as those Dexes get battle tested and used for years without anyone finding bugs. So I think the noncustodial characteristic of Dexs is, to me, like a major advantage that will eventually kind of make the balance go more towards Dexs than to saxis, which is the case today. And we've seen that in the numbers. The amount of volume traded on Dexs has skyrocketed this year and some days, and I think maybe every day now, uniswap is trading more than Coinbase. So, yeah, that's pretty crazy. No one would have said that one year ago, let alone two years ago.
00:19:59.710 - 00:20:16.914, Speaker A: Absolutely. And so what's your view on things like flash attacks? Do you see them as a bug or a feature of defi? And you might actually be able to do a better job of explaining a flash load and a flash attack than I can.
00:20:17.112 - 00:20:58.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a feature. Definitely not a bug. This is the beauty of ethereum, smart contracts and atomicity. You can do a very complex operation, and if anything goes wrong along the way, the whole thing gets canceled. You can't do that in real life. You want to trade on, I don't know, Dax, which is the german stock exchange, and on Nasdaq, and then you buy on one side, maybe you miss out on the trade. On the other side, you just end up with some stocks that you didn't want.
00:20:58.334 - 00:21:39.290, Speaker B: You just wanted to trade to arbitrage them. So Ethereum allows you to, if I can't buy the other one, I'll just not buy the first one. It's a much more guaranteed way to do arbitrage. So flash loans are that you can take a lot of money and then do whatever you want with it. As long as you give it back at the end of the transaction, then you're fine. And we just have to deal with that. All protocols have to be created and designed and tested, and you have to do modeling, and you have to do fuzzing, you have to do all sorts of different attempts of attacks, because people will try to attack you in all different ways.
00:21:39.290 - 00:22:27.850, Speaker B: And it's clear that flash loans are the source or a tool for very complex attacks. So this, in my opinion, is something we just have to get used to. And we'll still see many more attacks like the ones we've seen in the last weeks and have been seeing the whole time. It's hard to protect against flash loans because maybe you're using a protocol like this happened with BZX. They used uniswap as an oracle, indirectly, I think. And Uniswap didn't have the accumulator idea, which kind of protects against sandwich attacks or flash. And you have to think of the whole thing, not only about your protocol, every piece you're using as part of your product.
00:22:27.850 - 00:23:01.480, Speaker B: And we're doing this more and more like, we're not creating everything from scratch, we're just building on top of other protocols, our tools, and that's what we call the composability, which is something beautiful about Ethereum, but that brings with itself the risk of kind of waterfall risk, like things failing and bringing down everything. So you have to think about all the other protocols you use, not only your protocol. So, yeah, to summarize, it's definitely a feature and something new that we have to learn how to deal with.
00:23:02.410 - 00:24:06.858, Speaker A: And so do you see as somebody that's had to design something like balancer and to consider the attack vectors, as you say, understanding that the strength of Ethereum and Defi's composability also increases the attack surface, how do you design for that level of complexity, especially when you have to then have considerations around the governance of how you respond to them? Let's say that a new innovation emerges that causes risk to your platform. And do you also look at these kind of things as ways of hardening the network? So actually, by playing this massive bug bounty in a way, or trading arb game with this network of traders, do you think that that makes the system more resilient and harder with time, more effective over time?
00:24:06.944 - 00:24:45.398, Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah. I think there's three main areas to focus to mitigate those risks. I think the first one is keep things simple as much as possible. Of course, as we develop new tools, new protocols, things naturally get more and more complex. But it's like the Oakham's razor, you should always choose the simplest alternative or option if you have a few on the table, and you can make things very complicated and complex in crypto, but then you're like begging to be hacked or to have vulnerabilities. So keep things simple. That's the first one.
00:24:45.398 - 00:25:42.294, Speaker B: The second one is learn from prior or previous mistakes, hopefully from others. Right. If you didn't have any issues in the past, but you should learn from others, like what caused the BZX hack or what caused whatever hack. There's so many in history that we have to kind of learn and study all of those when we are creating new protocols or new things. And the third is really making sure that a lot of people look at your code and you model things and you design things in a way that you can test and battle, test all your assumptions, and there's like tools for that and companies that focus on that, like block science and gauntlet. Those guys are really good at simulating different actors, like actors that are malicious, and many actors interacting with your protocol at the same time. Yeah.
00:25:42.294 - 00:26:20.146, Speaker B: So I think those three topics are good ways to mitigate the risk. The risk is always there. So I think also you should have a proper bug bounty so that you incentivize white hat hackers as opposed to hackers that just steal all your funds or funds of your protocol. But it's a hard thing as time goes by and your project didn't get hacked, it gives you some peace of mind. But as you launch something and money starts to pile in, then, yeah, you can get some sleepless nights, I'll tell you that.
00:26:20.248 - 00:27:26.438, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I've always said that the saving grace for DeFi has been that its economic load has been relatively light compared to wider crypto or any comparable capital market. And so actually we can afford this period of experimentation whilst it doesn't have to carry that economic payload. But I guess if you look at everything that's now happening in the wider market, we're coming towards the end of November 2020, e two launched bitcoins just broke the ceiling, and very likely a lot of attention is going to be coming to the space. Presumably a lot of economic load as well. I'm going to get into that a little bit later about where you think DFI is going to go if there's such a thing as DFI 2.0. But maybe let's just jump back to balancer and the products. I know you mentioned earlier this innovation of smart pools.
00:27:26.438 - 00:27:30.006, Speaker A: Could you talk us through those and what they enable?
00:27:30.118 - 00:27:59.342, Speaker B: Definitely. So I think smart pools are one of the best, greatest use cases of balancer. It's basically the fact that pools can have their parameters changed on the fly. So maybe like to explain that it would be helpful to talk about the two native types of balancer pools. We have. We have shared pools on balancer that are similar to what you have on uniswap pools that cannot be changed. So they're immutable.
00:27:59.342 - 00:28:36.590, Speaker B: You can have any combination of weights, different tokens, but those cannot change. So you always have the same trade, and you can have a trading fee that goes from zero to 10%. But if it's a shared pool, anyone can provide liquidity, and the pool is immutable. People that provide liquidity, they know this pool will not change. On the other side, you have the private pools, which are pools that can change anything at any moment. So the pool can start with two tokens, and then you can add a new token, you can change weight, you can increase the trading fee, you can do whatever you want. But since you can change anything, you could indirectly steal money from someone who also put liquidity in that pool.
00:28:36.590 - 00:29:23.326, Speaker B: By adding a token that you have 100% of the supply, you can drain the value of the whole pool. So other people cannot put money or liquidity in that pool. So that's why it's called a private pool. But then we came up with a very interesting concept or construct called smart pools, which is nothing but a private pool that's controlled, owned by a smart contract. And that smart contract serves as a gateway for other people to provide liquidity to that pool, at the same time being able to change some parameters of that pool so that controller can say, like, you can read my code, I'm a smart contract, I own this private pool. So if you give me money, I'll just put money in that private pool that I own. But of course, it's your money, so you can withdraw it at any time.
00:29:23.326 - 00:30:29.054, Speaker B: But if you look at my code, you see that when there's a lot of volatility, I have the code to increase the trading fee of this private pool that I own. So actually, that construct is just like a shared pool, but that can adapt to the market conditions in known ways, like in logical ways that you can read and make sure you're not going to be kind of stolen or you're not going to get your money stolen from you. Examples of that are as simple as a search pricing pool. So when you have lots of volatility, demand for liquidity, you can just increase your fees, right? Because people are not so much worrying or worried about what the fee I'm paying. I just want to get the price right now because I know price is going up or it's going down. So search price pool, what we have today with normal share pools, on balancer or uniswap, it's really like taxis. However, the market changes, those pools are fixed they don't adapt, which is obviously suboptimal.
00:30:29.054 - 00:31:17.602, Speaker B: Right? So you should adapt your pool to the market conditions. Another example, and that's something you mentioned that is really catching on, a lot of people or projects are using is this idea of an ido imbalancer, an offering of initial offering on balancer, which we call the liquidity bootstrapping pool. The idea of a liquidity bootstrapping pool is it's a smart pool. And what changes in that pool, it's not the trading fee, it's rather the weight. So you start your smart pool with a lot more of your project token. So let's say you start with 95% of your project token and 5% e, right? So you can have a very big amount of liquidity without a lot of the money up front, because you're trying to sell your token for eth or for die. So you don't have a lot of that, right.
00:31:17.602 - 00:31:57.506, Speaker B: So what you're doing is you start with 95 five, and then the smart pool, what it does is it slowly decreases the weight of your token and increase the weight of die or eth. And then you end up with, instead of 95 five, you end up with 595. So you have 95% of the value of the pool in dai or e and only 5% in your project token. So it's equivalent to a dutch auction. The price starts very high. As the weights flip, the price goes down, and people start buying whenever their price point comes. So if the LVP starts at $10 per token, I think the right price is five.
00:31:57.506 - 00:32:35.050, Speaker B: If everyone thinks the price is five, then as time goes by, the weights change and the prices go down until people start buying, and then the price starts stabilizing. Because as the weights go down and people buy, those are opposing forces. So yeah, people buying would make the price go up, but the weights going down causes the price to go down. So it's kind of a dutch auction. But the nice thing is that people who bought can sell. And it's just like any other balancer pool, people can buy and sell, buy and sell. Just the price is going down over time according to a schedule that the project defines.
00:32:35.050 - 00:33:36.438, Speaker B: And the nice thing about that, Jamie, is that it avoids bots that are really fast and buy prices like tokens that, for example, on Uniswap, when you look at the offering, the bot that bought in the first block, they got like, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of dollars just for being the first. And they dumped those tokens a few blocks afterwards. I'm not 100% sure, but those bots that were the first ones got the best price and then a price like five x, and they just made a lot of money with balancer, lbps, liquidity, bootstrapping pools. It's actually the opposite. If you buy too early, you're going to get wrecked because the price has a schedule to go down. And this makes for a very healthy price discovery mechanism. And people, if they bought for a price and they think, okay, now it's a good time to sell, they don't need to go to another venue, secondary market to sell the token that they just bought in this ido.
00:33:36.438 - 00:33:46.998, Speaker B: They can sell back to the balancer pool, liquidity pool. So not only you can buy, but you can also sell. It's a trading venue in and of itself. Yeah.
00:33:47.004 - 00:34:53.900, Speaker A: And as I said, I know a number of projects within our portfolio are actively exploring this as a distribution event strategy. And what they really like about it is that it removes a lot of the complexity that goes with this from, as you say, price discovery having to worry about creating a bonding curve, a token bonding curve. It allows for automated market making, something that they would normally have to contract somebody to do manually, and allows for this capital market to form in an efficient way quickly. And obviously, most tokens that come to market, they have poor liquidity. Price discovery is weak. So I know a lot are very excited about this as a way to kind of birth a token into the world and allows them to kind of quote one of them. It allows them to just focus on community and not have to worry about all of these problems that would otherwise be had to solve for.
00:34:53.900 - 00:35:16.420, Speaker A: So maybe let's zoom out. Firstly, do you agree with the premise that we're moving into a DFI 2.0, a new phase of DFI, following on from the server 2020? Or do you just see it as a continuum? How do you see the space evolving over the next 1218 months?
00:35:17.110 - 00:36:28.002, Speaker B: That's a great and a hard question at the same time, Jamie. I think it's a continuum. I don't see any event that kind of a watershed event that changed completely, like the era of Defi and now we're entering a new era. I think that people, everyone was a bit too hyped in summer, and of course the Defi tokens went to very high prices and then kind of people realized that maybe we should wait a bit more to see where this all is going and if it's going to add enough value to justify all these valuations. And people also kind of got tested with all the clones and copycats and anonymous teams that were generating those weekend projects that stole liquidity from Unisoft and from balancer. So there's a lot of learnings there to rug pulls from anonymous teams. I think people are getting more mature and knowing a bit better, like who to trust and to do their due diligence before investing in any high API.
00:36:28.002 - 00:37:32.530, Speaker B: Just because the API is high, people are starting to take into account the risk side of the equation, because it's always risk reward. And I think so far, at least during summer, the hype season, people were only looking at the reward side of the equation. Now people are looking more at the risk side as well. I think that DeFi is going to impress us even more than it has already. The reason why I think that is that Ethereum is going to, and I said that on other podcasts, I think Ethereum is going to prove to be a great reserve of value as well. And I think we'll see a lot of monetary bandwidth, as you were just mentioning so far, it's like a fraction or a tiny bit of what we can see in the conventional financial world. So as more and more companies start tokenizing things on Ethereum and using DeFi, we're going to see a lot of value and assets being used on Defi.
00:37:32.530 - 00:38:13.174, Speaker B: And I think we are kind of the pioneers, balancer, Uniswap and so many other protocols that are leading the pack here. I think those protocols will be seeing enormous growth and there's going to be new protocols as well. And I think it's great because together with composability, we're all tackling different challenges. Like there's people doing insurance, people doing derivatives and indexes and order books. So it's a community that's helping. It's a lot easier to launch something on Ethereum because of those protocols that exist already and serve as building blocks. And we see balancer as a primitive and as a building block.
00:38:13.174 - 00:38:46.370, Speaker B: Right. We want other projects to build upon balancer. I think we're less focused on the end user than uniswap, for example. So I think we're more like this infrastructure layer for other projects to build on top. So yeah, I think this is going to impress us. In twelve months, maybe we'll be looking at defy and being as impressed as we would be if we were to look today, one year ago, like 12 billion, I don't know how many billion already, like over $10 billion locked to defy. No one would have guessed that last year.
00:38:46.370 - 00:39:04.922, Speaker B: I think we're going to be impressed. And now seeing all this bull run coming up and bitcoin hitting new highs and e 2.0 getting released and launched, those things can be catalysts. And yeah, I see a very bright future. No investment advice, of course, but that's my personal view.
00:39:04.976 - 00:39:31.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to not be bullish on DeFi generally because the economic incentive. So yes, there are challenges, limitations, but there's this amazing brain trust of people like yourself being drawn into the space and there's enough of an economic incentive to solve the problems. So I think it's very hard to not be bullish long term about that.
00:39:31.240 - 00:40:10.746, Speaker B: It's so much better, right Jamie? It's obviously better. There's so many less intermediaries. It's transparent. You can audit easily looking at the smart contract, so it's a matter of time. People who control most of the money are like those white guys in suits that are used to stock exchanges and going to only being able to exchange stocks from nine to five, not on weekend. So it's a new paradigm and I think it takes time to adapt, but it's clearly to me a much better alternative and option and it will prevail and win in the medium to long term, in my opinion.
00:40:10.938 - 00:40:52.090, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think if you look at the DNA of Defi, it is designed around hyper competition because of its composability. If something is suboptimal, something else can immediately replace its part in the stack. And if you compare that to the existing financial system, which is anti competitive, it does not need to innovate. It's impossible for one market that does not innovate, that is not based on competition to compete with one that is entirely oriented around that. Fernando, it's been great having you on. Both you and your wife did really well.
00:40:52.090 - 00:41:08.750, Speaker A: Managing a child of three, waking up in the middle of the podcast to manage that situation. You had a bit of drilling going on as well. You managed to get through it like a real pro. So thanks Fernando, so much, and I'm really looking forward to seeing more lbps happen over the next twelve months.
00:41:08.900 - 00:41:12.510, Speaker B: Thanks so much Jamie, for having me here. Yeah, it's been a pleasure.
