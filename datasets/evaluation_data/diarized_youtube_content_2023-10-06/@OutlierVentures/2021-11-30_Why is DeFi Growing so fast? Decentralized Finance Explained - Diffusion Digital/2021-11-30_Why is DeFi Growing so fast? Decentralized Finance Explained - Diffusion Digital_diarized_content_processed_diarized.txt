00:00:14.810 - 00:00:21.310, Speaker A: What's driving the growth in defi at the moment? And is it based upon some fundamentals?
00:00:21.810 - 00:01:16.690, Speaker B: So I think what's driving the growth is the ecosystems. The ecosystems and the engineering has benefited from kind of the. We overestimate what we can do in ten years and we underestimate what we can do in ten. And we're kind of starting to see the garden blossom of engineering that's been done five years ago. I think that we're going to have this continual composability, Lego blocks being built and built and built. But I fear that while 65 billion may sound like a lot of money, that is a very small piece of the capital markets. And I would say that's mostly retail driven.
00:01:16.690 - 00:02:04.050, Speaker B: And I'm going to include family offices in retail. Family offices, in my opinion, is not institutional. And really, that's kind of when we start getting the Pimcos of the world and the pension funds of the world, deploying capital into this, that's when we cross the chasm. But we're really kind of just playing with ourselves. The evangelists are really doing that. And I think that there are a few things specifically that need to happen to get there. One which interests me, which surprises me that it hasn't been addressed more, but the concept of finality.
00:02:04.050 - 00:03:07.390, Speaker B: So basically, trade finality in the legacy financial markets is table stakes. And with probabilistic blockchains and concepts like optimistic roll ups where you could have seven days before you have trade finality, I think that's very difficult for an institution or a custodian like a Morgan or a bank of New York Mellon or State street. They have to have finality before really custodying these assets. So I think that once we start having technologies that have that finality at L2, I think that'll be very important. One example of that is a group called Nami, which is a L2 scaling solution that's focused specifically on having instant finality versus kind of the seven day look backs of optimistic roll ups.
00:03:07.490 - 00:03:20.300, Speaker A: So let's talk about the thesis that you have going into nfts, how you kind of divide out the different types of assets that are available today within that space.
00:03:20.930 - 00:04:37.480, Speaker B: So first and foremost, what I want to dispel to the world, and I think a lot of people in the space, and maybe you'll agree, is the concept that these are overpriced jpegs. And I get all the cute things from cryptokitties back in the day to what's being built now with punks and whatnot, and they're lovely, but we're not acquiring them for artistic, we're not acquiring nfts for our own artistic desires. What I'm much more interested is kind of the infrastructure around them. So kind of first and foremost, like, going low into the protocols. We're very much interested in kind of the long term storage issues. So as you've been working with Filecoin and ipfs, I think that really getting the plumbing done properly in kind of the storage of the assets and kind of the data markets of tomorrow, we're very interested.
00:04:38.090 - 00:04:41.960, Speaker A: And you're doing that through your venture arm, right? Is that separate to the.
00:04:44.330 - 00:06:13.678, Speaker B: We're large believers in the implementation of ipfs and filecoin, and we've taken a huge position there years ago and we are watching kind of just data markets evolve. And so basically we want to understand kind of how data markets evolve and how we can improve infrastructure at that point. Secondarily, we consider kind of the NFT being, I would say, just part of a brand. And so if you're AC Milan, or if you're John Doe, the country music singer, or if you're, I would know, Mattel, the toy maker, each of those have various aspects of additional ways that the population sees them. Mattel, you literally have a brick and mortar toy. The singer would have music. And basically we want to figure out how we know, incorporate this into branding and social media and have things where you can have access to the digital NFT.
00:06:13.678 - 00:07:18.198, Speaker B: But that's really the deed to the brick and mortar asset. And with that, we can embed business logic that if it's sold from primary creator to secondary buyer and the secondary buyer sells it to the tertiary buyer, embedding the business logic that the primary creator is paid on that secondary sale. A lot of time in venture we're building for the ten year olds. But I don't see this crossing over to adults per se. And I want to see how we can target the adults. So I'm curious and I'm open. And kind of all of the NFT companies that I talk to, I ask them how do they target somebody who has not bought bitcoin or ether or any other crypto asset for that matter? So I think that that's another question we're trying to solve for and to see if there's any traction in solving that question.
00:07:18.284 - 00:07:24.438, Speaker A: Do you think that play to earn will have a little bit more latitude in terms of who can participate?
00:07:24.614 - 00:08:18.186, Speaker B: And I think that there's got to be a monetary threshold as well. If junior is playing to earn the $20 sword versus John Doe Jr's dad buying the million dollar digital artwork or song or digital. Right. And is doing that so they can have a bond like yield a monthly income. Those are two distinct animals, and I think there should be some type of de minimis. Maybe it's under $500. That gets kind of the kids who are earning the game or earning the assets out of it.
00:08:18.186 - 00:08:44.722, Speaker B: So I think that we could solve that with maybe $1,000, $1,0000 de minimis annually on various toys. But I think you're right. A royalty is not much different than a bond if you're acquiring it for the ongoing cash flows. It's the same animal.
00:08:44.906 - 00:09:14.490, Speaker A: Drew, I was like, over the moon to find out that I actually had 40 more minutes with you. I only thought I had 20, so I was really rushing at the beginning, and then I had that whole hour. So thank you. I don't know if you knew that, but thanks for your time. I really appreciate it all worked out. I know we went a little bit all over the place, but I can see in the chat people were loving the direction of it. I'm really grateful of your time, and I know that you're going to be one of the people that will be leading the space and hopefully bringing in some of that institutional money, whether it's directly or indirectly.
00:09:14.490 - 00:09:16.030, Speaker A: So thanks for your time, Andrew.
00:09:16.370 - 00:09:18.860, Speaker B: Godspeed. Thank you, Jamie. Be well, everyone.
