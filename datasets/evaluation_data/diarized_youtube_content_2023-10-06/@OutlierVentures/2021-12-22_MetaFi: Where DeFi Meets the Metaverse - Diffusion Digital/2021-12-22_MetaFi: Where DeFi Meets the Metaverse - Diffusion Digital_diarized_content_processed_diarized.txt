00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.658, Speaker A: What do we mean specifically by metaverse finance? How might that be categorized?
00:00:05.754 - 00:00:11.082, Speaker B: Users generate huge amounts of useful data, which is currently mostly sold for advertising.
00:00:11.146 - 00:00:19.470, Speaker C: So we've seen already early experiments in social tokens like friends with benefits, or like daos, like Nounsdao, which is very NFT centric.
00:00:33.850 - 00:01:14.770, Speaker A: Let's just frame it a little bit more. So, you know, we're talking about Defi and the metaverse. Of course, the metaverse is incredibly expansive. It can mean lots of things to different people. I think for us, in the context of Metafi, where we're really focusing, is this idea on a kind of digital economy. So if you look at the digital economy as it exists today, the different kinds of digital value, they are generally trapped in web two platforms, typically monopolies like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. If it's in the social media context, if it's e commerce, it's Amazon, Google, it's search or gaming, Fortnite and Roblox.
00:01:14.770 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker A: And if we think about the people that are creating that value, which you could call the creator economy, how do they get to participate in that wealth creation, both on the platform and of course, off the platform? And the off the platform bit is the most critical, because actually, in almost every context where the value, the bulk of the value is being created by the creator, by the user, it is being captured by the shareholder of the platform. So let's start with you, Mattis. How can we break down and understand, I guess, the structural problems of web two as it is today, and its creator economy?
00:01:59.830 - 00:02:46.910, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a couple of problems that we have identified in the course of kind of coming up with this metafi thesis. The first one is that value in web two platforms is siloed by design, which means that users cannot transfer value in between these platforms. It can mean different things in different contexts. For example, in the context of social media, it's about data. Users generate huge amounts of useful data, which is currently mostly sold for advertising. But the possibilities in terms of what can be done with the data in the future are basically limitless. And despite that, users are not being compensated for providing this useful input and have usually very little idea or kind of control over what happens to this data as it lives on centralized servers.
00:02:46.910 - 00:03:45.300, Speaker B: Then, in the context of gaming, it's about in game items. Although people spend huge amounts of money here in these games and on these in game items, for example, an average Fortnite player spends $85. They cannot move these items from platform to platform. So that's the first problem. The next problem is something we called kind of limited financial inclusion, which means that digital creators cannot use value they create digitally in the existing financial system. And what we mean by that is that they cannot use, for example, a crypto bank as collateral to borrow against at a traditional bank, which puts them at a disadvantage. And then the third problem is dynamic terms and conditions, which means that users cannot trust credible neutrality of centralized services like Facebook or Amazon, for example.
00:03:45.300 - 00:03:55.560, Speaker B: There's a chance that Amazon may deplatform you if you're viewed as their competitor, even though that's not really what you signed up for when you started using their platform.
00:03:57.850 - 00:04:11.678, Speaker A: And then of course, there's this idea of credible, you know, the kind of state in which the participants in that platform feel they exist. Can you talk about that a little bit as well?
00:04:11.844 - 00:04:51.180, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So as you said, it's a state in which these users are kind of treated fairly and they can reasonably believe that they will be treated so in the future. And the way this is normally achieved is by giving these users some sort of a say in how the platform is managed. And in the web free world, this is normally done by distributing, for example, governance tokens to these users as they kind of use this platform. So that increasingly, the more they use it, the more say they get in terms of how this platform is managed. And this is something that web free is really good at.
00:04:52.270 - 00:04:52.682, Speaker C: Cool.
00:04:52.736 - 00:05:37.030, Speaker A: All right, so we kind of broken down the kind of four problems, structural problems with web two, at least as we see it, and the impact on the credit economy. For me, the financial inclusion one is the more important, but we'll kind of circle back to that a little bit later. So, Jan, you're kind of one of our resident DeFi experts and degens. How does DeFi tooling or innovations in DeFi solve for some of these problems? And how can they begin to give a better deal, especially in a financial inclusion context with the creator economy?
00:05:38.010 - 00:06:13.678, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think the best way to start is to tag on where Matsus left off with the credible neutrality bit. So because of that, it disenables composability of all of these toolings that are being developed. So, like, say, in the case of DeFi, everything that projects are doing with tokens, from raising capital to creating more engagement and mechanisms, from staking to airdrops and all of these things, they can be leveraged as kind of lego blocks in, like I say, a metaverse or creator economy context.
00:06:13.774 - 00:06:38.170, Speaker A: So we've kind of established in basic form how DeFi could be applied the basic innovations of DeFi. We've hinted to how they could be applied in a metaverse context. But let's unpack exactly what we mean by Metafi. So what do we mean specifically by metaverse finance? How might that be categorized?
00:06:39.310 - 00:08:05.378, Speaker C: Yes, so I think it is a first way into understanding this is looking at basically the merger of DeFi and then metaverse elements such as nfts and play to earn gaming and all of these different areas. So what we're getting from the DeFi mechanisms is the unstoppability and composability so that they can freely be recombined and employed in these new games and schemes and experiences. And then specifically, if we're looking at a combination of DeFi and nfTs, we're seeing the first few examples emerge now, but we're expecting that there will be many more types and ways of combining these mechanisms. So for example, an NFT project can issue their own native token and then combine, confirm government's rights in a DAO, or have other ways that people interact with a token on top of the NFT. Another example would be using nfts in a defi context, say a valuable NFT such as an in game item, a PFP, or some digital art. They could be used as collateral to get out a loan. So that's the Niftyfi example you mentioned earlier.
00:08:05.378 - 00:08:21.430, Speaker C: And then most importantly, again, I will bring it back to this direct connection between creators and the community around them, and that the fact that the community is getting ownership. So they're not just passive consumers, they're co creators and co owners.
00:08:21.510 - 00:08:44.542, Speaker A: So very quickly I want to give you each 1 minute and then we'll have to close off, have to wrap this up. But 1 minute matters on the limitations of metify. And then Jan, I want to try to get some predictions from you, obviously representative our thinking as a team. So 1 minute each, one on the limitations matters, one on some kind of predictions of the possibilities.
00:08:44.606 - 00:09:18.426, Speaker B: Jan? Sure. Yeah. So very quickly. So there's a couple of limitations that we've identified. NFT appraisals are a very important aspect of metafi, because in order to be able to borrow against an NFT, you need to know what the NFT is worth, of course, but they are still hard to do. So how it's done now is that you go on Niftyfi, you list your NFT on their website as collateral, and lenders can offer you loans based on how valuable they think your NFT is. So it's essentially appraised by lenders.
00:09:18.426 - 00:10:16.260, Speaker B: It's a good solution, but it has its drawbacks, and we kind of expect this problem to be kind of solved in the future or improved. Then there is the kind of legal and governance issues around fractionalization. So if you divide your NFT into 100 pieces and distribute them to different people, it's not always clear who can do what and when and under what circumstances. Then another limitation would be probably standards across blockchains. So the metaverse is now being built on different blockchains, like Solana, Ethereum, polka dot, a lot, but they're still not 100% interoperable, which means we can kind of again experience this siloing of value, which would probably set us back economically. But there are people working on solutions to these problems, so I don't think it's something that we need to be too down about.
00:10:17.190 - 00:10:30.520, Speaker A: Great, thanks, Mattis and Jan, tell us about some of the possibilities that we're seeing both be applied to our start, to our accelerator, and then also some things that we want to see built out in the world.
00:10:31.850 - 00:11:21.240, Speaker C: So, first of all, I think we're going to see much more autonomous communities with their own financial and governance logic. So we've seen already early experiments in social tokens like friends with benefits, or daos like nounstao, which is very NFT centric. But I think we're going to see much more of those and new variants in combination of those mechanisms. And what this is going to lead to is a kind of financialization of culture in a way, or at least adding financial elements to culture. And the upside of this is that fun things can start making you money. So it's not just music or art, because you like to do so, but you can actually earn a living doing that. Same goes with playing games and so on.
00:11:21.240 - 00:11:30.500, Speaker C: So, as the summary, I would say we're going to see a whole range of new jobs of the metaverse. I find.
