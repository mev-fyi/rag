00:00:06.260 - 00:01:05.448, Speaker A: Hello everyone and welcome to another tech Tuesdays with Altar Ventures. And today with three guests from some big projects in the crypto and Defi space. Today we'll go into our blockchain and Defi developer trends reports and some of the conclusions that we got out of there. And the reason we invited these three projects, Ave, Terra and Avalanche, to join us today is that we saw them do really well over the period last. Yeah, we'll get into a bit like how that was for them, what open source development is like, and of course any questions that you all would like to ask. We're live streaming on crowdcasts today and also on Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and I think on Dlive. Well, wanted to do a bit more decentralized streaming and yeah, just for a.
00:01:05.454 - 00:01:07.436, Speaker B: Very quick introduction, round of introduction so.
00:01:07.458 - 00:01:19.756, Speaker A: That everybody knows who they have in front of them. I'm going to go alphabetical. On first name we have Ernesto from Ave. Can you say what you do at Ave?
00:01:19.868 - 00:01:34.260, Speaker C: Hello everybody. Yeah, I'm Ernesto, I'm one of the lead developers at Avi and mainly I work like in the smart contract blockchain but also a lot on product and other parts.
00:01:37.160 - 00:01:42.820, Speaker A: Great, thanks. And Gabrielle from Avalanche or Ava Labs Labs.
00:01:44.200 - 00:02:14.940, Speaker D: Good morning everyone. Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor and a pleasure. So, my name is Gabriel Cardona, as he mentioned, I am from Ava Labs. My title is developer evangelist. So I spend a large part of my time interfacing with biz dev partners and hackathons and community members, hoping to help inspire and on ramp developers and businesses into the avalanche ecosystem. And then I also spend a part of my time maintaining avalanche js, which is our typescript Javascript library for our ecosystem.
00:02:14.940 - 00:02:16.368, Speaker D: Thank you for having me.
00:02:16.534 - 00:02:24.900, Speaker A: Great, thanks. Yeah, we saw a good bit of commits from yourself as well. Good. All right, and finally, William from Terra.
00:02:25.320 - 00:02:55.900, Speaker E: Hi, I'm William, I work at developer experience and relations at Terra and I am currently focusing on developing the depth developer community at. So we've worked on stuff that make developers lives easier for developing smart contracts on Terra. And I personally work on Terra Js, Terra Python and local Terra, which is a ganache for Terra one click blockchain.
00:02:56.500 - 00:03:08.710, Speaker A: Yeah, great, thanks. All right, mudit, who are you? So, yeah.
00:03:12.440 - 00:03:39.980, Speaker B: Bit of trouble with the microphone, sorry. Yeah, so myself, mudit, I work with Outlier as the web3 technology analyst and I work primarily with different protocols trying to analyze how their technology is and especially worked for this bot. All the code base was managed by me and we'll see more about how we did what we did in coming slides, I guess.
00:03:40.130 - 00:04:43.836, Speaker A: Thanks. Great, thanks. And then to close off, Aran Vanamas, CTO and founding partner of Outlive Ventures with business since 2014. So, worked with a lot of companies over the year, over the years, and in this day and age, that's mostly with our base camp accelerator, where we work with early stage startups in web3, D five nfts, and increasingly we call the open metaverse to make them as successful as they can be. And that is really also the background of why are we even doing this. We work with lots of companies who are all developing something different, and we want to be best informed to help them choose the right platforms, the ones that are most suitable to them, the ones that are really active in development, the ones that are really actively being maintained. So yeah, this is why we do this amount of number crunching and analyzing regularly.
00:04:43.836 - 00:05:18.190, Speaker A: Actually, this is the second edition. The first one was halfway last year. And yeah, we intend to keep that rhythm and improve it as we go. So we'll go into some of the highlights from the report. First, of course, disclaimer, take care of what we say today is investment advice. And yeah, something a bit more about the report itself.
00:05:18.720 - 00:05:20.430, Speaker B: Buddhist, will you want to take this?
00:05:22.080 - 00:05:22.588, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:22.674 - 00:05:53.320, Speaker B: So, yes, Aaron kind of gave an intro about what this report is. It's basically like we were trying to analyze different blockchain protocols, DFI protocols and NFT projects for deriving the key trends for 2020 and for 2021. And the basic need for this project for this report was to, as Aaron said, to analyze different blockchain protocols.
00:05:55.100 - 00:05:55.416, Speaker A: For.
00:05:55.438 - 00:06:46.600, Speaker B: Our various companies that come in our cohorts, for our base camp and ascend. And as a result of this developer trend report was born. So for this, we analyzed primarily three metrics, core blockchain development, core developer contribution, and GitHub statistics for the past twelve months, starting from January 27, I think. More details on the next slide. The full methodology, the data sources that we used and all the code is available. It's open source and it's available on our GitHub and our GitHub repository. And yeah, it was featured, I guess in Cointelegraph, Coindesk, EMB, crypto and crypto ninjas, and a couple of more such channels.
00:06:51.580 - 00:08:09.488, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. On the methodology, there's various ways in which you can look at this, and of course, if you dive into it, there's endless metrics that you could use to look at developer like development activity, development adoption, and you can make it as big as or as small as you want to get. Sort of the balance between offering signal versus noise and being able to do include a large selection of protocols. Some of the choices we made was to focus on actual core protocol development rather than adoption, in the sense that really looking at the core repository of the important, like the core organizations, if they are there to grasp those, and of course those will always include any external contributions. We've gratefully used the electric capitals repository of what's called the crypto ecosystems repository. It's a large crowdsourced collection of an index, basically of this GitHub organization belongs or contributes to Ethereum.
00:08:09.488 - 00:09:26.912, Speaker A: This GitHub organization contributes to Bitcoin. This GitHub repository uses avalanche and yeah, that's been one of the important source for us to select the repository that we include from that we have taken and curated and changed in some cases which core organizations we include for which protocols, just to get rid of some of the noise that's inevitably going to be in there when you have a large crowdsourced data source. And yeah, for the period was effectively entire 2020. And that's what it said. Core protocol development in terms of commit counts and code updates, we do use some additional metrics behind the scenes to sort of back test and check whether the data that we got was correct and made sense. And the core developers, in terms of monthly active user developers, where we say, well, if you made at least one commit to the protocol in that month, you can't including that, of course that has caveats. There's going to be no method is perfect, no set of metrics is perfect, and you'll make trade offs.
00:09:26.912 - 00:10:11.156, Speaker A: Some of the trade offs that we made is like commit counts. It is a fallible metric in a sense that some developers, when they get something done in one evening, they make ten commits and some others they make one commit in a week. So that will lead to very different numbers. However, spread over a logic group. We felt, and we have sample wise checked that to an extent levels out. And with multi active developers, there's no distinction between level of development of activity that we made. So you could look deeper into that or less deep.
00:10:11.156 - 00:11:15.710, Speaker A: And we took this one to get this number and finally one on imported forks. We chose to ignore actually forked repositories marked on GitHub because that happens very often, like when someone clicks hey, fork this repository, then suddenly you would have this huge set of code that would suddenly contribute to development activity for your protocol. However, if you take a code base and then upload it to GitHub then still it will recognize, oh, there's lots of contributions here, but it won't actually mark them as such. Now those are included in this report, and there are quite a few actually legitimate cases of that where it is actually developer community or activity. Consider for example, when the Ethereum gat repository changes from that get merged into the core gat repository, which is in the Ethereum classic group of organizations. So many developers there are counted as contributors to Ethereum classic, but in a sense they are. And there's work being done of merging those changes.
00:11:15.710 - 00:11:58.330, Speaker A: But you can say, well, you should maybe count those for a lower amount or should you do something more with that? And those are things that will take into account for next addition. We are improving our metrics and our methodology over every report, and there's lots of every addition and there's lots of things that we want to improve as well. But this is the state of things. Yeah, so two main sections for today, like core blockchain protocols. Those are mainly the layer ones and then DeFi protocols. We're building centralized finance on top of those. Do you want to take this one with it?
00:11:59.200 - 00:13:16.432, Speaker B: So yeah, this was the executive summary, as was mentioned in the report. And the key findings that we sort of came across is that Ethereum had the maximum number of commits and was still the most actively developed protocol, followed by Cardano, bitcoin and Polkadot and Cosmos. So again, there was one more caveat in this is that there were a lot of caveats and we just highlighted the top three, but there were a couple of more and we suggest that all of you guys should definitely check those out. But yeah, one such caveat was that, for example, Cardano has this massive number of commits, which is also because the core organization that develops that works on Cardano, IOhK, is also working on other protocols. So such organizations have been fitted in one protocol, but they do work on other protocols as well. So yeah, that was one. Other than that, we saw that multi chain protocols like Polkadot and Cosmos and Avalanche are seeing a consistent rise in both code development and developer contribution.
00:13:16.432 - 00:14:14.490, Speaker B: Avalanche saw a massive, tremendous growth, which is close to four x in terms of monthly developers. And yeah, other than that, we also saw that decentralized storage protocols, filecoin, CR, probably even storage was doing pretty decent. Filecoin saw a great jump and in the start of the year, and from the start of the year till towards the end, it joined one of the top five actively developed blockchain projects. So that's a big thing. And we also saw that a lot of projects like Tron, EOS, Comodo and Qtum were not doing as well as they had been, and they saw a significant decrease in core development metrics. Other than that, I can't see the last one, but.
00:14:15.820 - 00:15:00.150, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's the enterprise blockchain domain on the screen. It's a hyperledger who had still higher development activity than quarter on some metrics still in the top five, but quarter has slightly better growth. And interestingly, shortly after we released the report, the announcement, or maybe the leak, I don't know, the information came out that IBM had sort of laid off or got canceled most of their core contribution department to Hyperledger. So, yeah, interesting data point there. We took some of the top five charts here. So you can see the orange one.
00:15:00.150 - 00:15:44.080, Speaker A: These are the commits weekly, weekly basis. Orange one is Ethereum, blue one is Cardano. So you see those are actually very close one point of notice. Like, you'll see these charts decline very quickly at the end of the year. Part of that is very likely due to the holiday season. Part of that is to, again, a small caveat in the methodology. When you run metrics at the end of a period, not everything that has been done in that period might be included in the main branch yet, and we have included the main branch of those repositories.
00:15:44.080 - 00:16:38.390, Speaker A: So over time, you might see this slightly increase. And what we see is bitcoin here in the middle, and polka dots, again, about that level. And like I said, filecoin jumped straight into the top five of raw commit numbers. So, yeah, pretty impressive. I guess Filecoin, of course, sort of came out of stealth in this year and to their main net release, but, yeah, very impressive indeed. The core developers, we see some of the same names, Ethereum having a bigger lead here and interestingly, Hyperledger. So with a large absolute number of developers, but you can see it's steadily declining over the year, but still ending up with a very active community.
00:16:38.390 - 00:17:10.830, Speaker A: One note with respect to Hyperledger is that they don't have one blockchain technology, they have quite a few. And there's an aggregated number of all developers who contribute to Hyperledger. Fabric and sawtooth and Arias and Indy and all of those things together. So it's sort of the Hyperledger community and Filecon here as well jumping into the top five. Do you want to take this one?
00:17:12.980 - 00:17:13.536, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:13.638 - 00:18:16.310, Speaker B: So amongst the blockchain protocols that we saw, we saw that, as you can see, ocean protocol, avalanche, terra Hedera and Iota saw significant increases in the commits ocean sort of saw a consistent increase till close to October. And avalanche peaked around September, mid September, which I think was close to the main net launch with Terra. It started off with low numbers but consistently increased. So we had a couple of versions of this. This is not the logarithmic version. This is all plotted on the same scale. And yeah, I guess we'll get more to the exact figures of the increases and the probable reasons why they happened.
00:18:16.310 - 00:18:48.540, Speaker B: Again, avalanche, terra, significant increase in the core developers almost doubling, tripling towards the middle of the year with slight decrease towards the end as we predict is because of the holiday season kicking in and developers taking their time off. Should we go ahead, Aaron?
00:18:49.200 - 00:19:28.970, Speaker A: Sorry, I was muted. Yeah. So the other one of the highlights was flow, which launched this year out of the dapper labs, the team behind cryptokitties, as people know them globally. Yeah. Also seeing really impressive growth numbers, then focusing on Defi. Would you like to take this one again with it? Yeah, for sure. Do you mean that I asked you to take it? Maybe that got lost.
00:19:33.410 - 00:20:32.206, Speaker B: Again. We ran similar scripts for D five protocols. Again, we used D five pulse as the main source of curating the protocols that we wanted to analyze. We kind of shortlisted the top 50, out of which about 40 had their indexes built by the crypto ecosystems index of electric capital. And running the scripts. And the scripts for all these 40, we came across the following key conclusions is that Maker is still one of the most actively developed protocol, but its numbers aren't as strong as they were. And we will see that the top five are still makergnosis, Synthetix and probably even uniswap.
00:20:32.206 - 00:21:21.360, Speaker B: And a couple of projects that shot up across the year were Ave and Bancor and probably even Synthetix. And one interesting sort of insight that we got while analyzing DeFi projects is that a lot of folk repositories, a lot of folk projects and mashup projects kind of surpassed their parent project in terms of development, which was pretty interesting and insight. Other than that. Yeah, DeFi development was very open sourced as compared to the kind of development we saw in NFT and metaverse projects. So that's a brief summary of what we saw.
00:21:22.950 - 00:21:55.274, Speaker A: Yeah, indeed. And two more things to mention there. The biggest ones in DeFi, I think we have them in the top five. Yeah. In fact, the entire top five in commit count is composed of projects that originate in 2018 or earlier, I think synthetics, maybe later, but this is all the old guard, but they're doing it. So. Yeah.
00:21:55.274 - 00:22:22.066, Speaker A: Really impressive to keep those numbers up. Like we said, maker showing somewhat of a decline, but still really impressive. High levels and gnosis I guess was the one that really stood out as the most stable and steady over the year. Just chunking out code and having really consistently high developers numbers over the year. You want to talk about this one.
00:22:22.088 - 00:22:35.400, Speaker B: Or the previous one? The previous one probably. Augur wanted to point out that with augur there is a consistent decline, even though it is still in the top five. There was a slight decline that we saw across the.
00:22:37.230 - 00:23:18.820, Speaker A: Important one indeed. And compound and uniswap in terms of core developers, also amongst the top five of course, very widely used and forked as well. It seemed that at some point everybody was either forking compound or wrapping it or whatever and trading it to uniswap. So that did show up in the numbers as well. Looking at some of the rising stars, take them on with it.
00:23:19.210 - 00:23:54.740, Speaker B: Yeah, so we saw that as we can see our way set. Yearn in fact as well showed pretty good increases and Ave, I think shot up the most with the massive, I think about a 700% increase in code commits, which was pretty crazy for a protocol to do. And I think yuan finance also followed good lead and yeah, I mean, we can look at the developers as well. It shows similar trends, I guess.
00:23:57.830 - 00:25:08.282, Speaker A: Yeah, we have sushi Valperin as well. I want to say about that they were one of the examples where it started as almost a frivolous fork, but are now suddenly a pretty mature business, which they've done over a couple of months and are contributing lots of original work rather than just taking upstream changes from Uniswap and putting a token on top. So yeah, really, really exciting to see the speed at which that happens. And indeed, like you said, in the defi the default is open source, everything is open source. Hardly anyone is doing anything behind closed doors. And yeah, it's quite good and really helpful for our analysis, obviously, but really interesting to see how that accelerates, I guess, the space as a whole, as everyone can see what everybody else does and still through tokenization have a really strong form of economics around all of that. Yeah.
00:25:08.416 - 00:25:39.540, Speaker B: Another couple of insights on the DeFi protocols is that DeFi saw, I mean, as we saw, DeFi had a massive boom across the year and in fact it was the DeFi protocols in terms of both core development and developer count that they increased consistently over the year without any drop towards the end. I mean, even when the holiday season kicked in, the DeFi nerds and the Defi developers were going strong and churning out.
00:25:43.850 - 00:26:30.130, Speaker A: Great, right? Yeah. And a bit of a zoom in to our guests today. You pointed out some of the things already avalanche, we're starting really impressive growth on developers and especially commit counts. Terra, also very big jump into commits and ave having especially, yeah, really impressive number. The highest out of the defi category for sure. Maybe also the blockchain, I'm not sure, but yeah, really impressive numbers. So yeah, I'm going to take the opportunity to bring in our guests and let's start from top to bottom from Avalanche.
00:26:30.130 - 00:26:47.820, Speaker A: Gabriel, first off, were we right? Do you feel like that peak was related to the race up to mainnet? And yeah. Can you say a bit about that experience?
00:26:50.590 - 00:27:28.578, Speaker D: Sure. So I've now been working in the blockchain space for several years. Prior to this I was@bitcoin.com and I did a couple startups prior to that. So now that I've been working in the blockchain space for several years, I really do believe that the team at Ava Labs is the best that I've personally worked with. I believe that it's one of the most technically competent teams in the entire space, going all the way up to our CEO, which is of course Mn gun Serre, professor from Cornell. And our coo is Kevin technique, PhD from Cornell.
00:27:28.578 - 00:28:13.970, Speaker D: And our chief protocol architect is also a PhD from Cornell. I think right now our team is around 60 people and I believe we have ten or so phds from Cornell. So thankfully, due to goon and his great networking there, we have a very deep technical bench and a lot of engineering deal flow coming out of Cornell. So we've been able to build a really strong, competent core team of developers. Our platform team of developers I think is only around four or five people and they just are able to achieve monumental work. Steven and Dan and Aaron, they all deserve a shout out. So yeah, to answer your question specifically, yes, we went live with our main net in September and I'm sure that those numbers are directly tied to that push for the main net.
00:28:13.970 - 00:29:19.670, Speaker D: Again, I think it's worth noting that our core team isn't that huge and these guys are churning out absolutely amazing work and our team has been growing steadily, so we had a token sale and we raised some capital. So we're hiring as quickly as possible if anybody out there is looking for a great team to join. But yeah, just to answer your question directly, I think it's a combination of us pushing for Mainnet and then us also just having a very strong again because a lot of our teams sort of emerged out of academia and actually had worked together, many of them studying under goon while they were doing their masters or their phds. I think we just have a very strong culture of, a strong culture that maps very well to startup cultures. So it's like a marathon of sprints, and we know when it's time to put in the work because we've got to hit the deadline and we know when it's time to kind of take some time off. So, yeah, I think that push in September was related to our main net, and I suspect we'll continue to kind of have that level of output simply because we have an incredibly competent team and everybody's properly motivated.
00:29:20.730 - 00:29:43.860, Speaker A: Great. Thanks for the insight. Yeah. Then, William, around Terra, we saw the Columbus and Houston, or the main net upgrade, Columbus and Houston framework, in September. Was there indeed in your experience? A lot of activity around that. And can you tell a little bit more?
00:29:47.030 - 00:31:02.410, Speaker E: So the thing that you might not know about Terra is that most of the development doesn't come from the open source community, but from us internally. So if there were more commits during that time, it probably meant that we had a lot more resources to hire because we were building out like the apps that you've seen, such as Mirror and Anchor, and the fact that we had recently integrated the new main net, which has the feature to run smart contracts, as you know, and that had to pull in outside work from the Cosmosm team. And we also had to integrate many new features from the upcoming versions of Cosmos upstream and make sure that those were compatible. So that was that time last year, a couple, like around maybe four or five months ago, yeah. In order to facilitate this new feature, because before Terra was just a very simple chain, it was forked off of the Cosmos SDK.
00:31:03.550 - 00:31:18.080, Speaker A: And as I remembered, that was very deliberate, right, to do very, I guess, similar to binance chain when it started, like do something. High performance transactions make that really work really well. So interesting to see that that smart contract did now come.
00:31:19.970 - 00:33:01.134, Speaker E: So for me, Terra was a boring chain, but it remained focused, right? It was all about payments in the beginning, where we launched with Terra X, or it's now known as chai, and that kind of allowed us to have the basic stability mechanism with a couple modules, like the on chain swap module, where you could swap from our unstable collateral token to a variety of stable coins, which were all collateralized by Luna. But other than that, there wasn't much you could do with Terra except hold and stake. So before December, it was quite boring chain to work on because it couldn't do anything but hold could. There was not even a way where you can inject some way to program stuff like with bitcoin, where you can actually use bitcoin script to create interesting programs like Namecoin or Omni Wallet. So that was that for most of Terra, which was about like a year and a half since the first mainnet is launched. So the reason why there was a sudden spike was that we had to get all of this prepared and in order to do so, we had to develop some internal tools that kind of made the transition as smooth as possible from no smart contracts to yes, smart contracts. So we have to build out things that smart contract developers would want and need.
00:33:01.134 - 00:34:05.140, Speaker E: And for us internally, because we'd have to do rigorous testing on just to make sure that it worked. Because like, again, this is pretty much a quantum leap for Terra because we're adding this execution layer to a chain which was robust but had already millions of transactions on it and was powering a large dap that was being used all throughout Korea. So we want to make sure that it wouldn't affect the day to day business with chai. So that kind of explains why a couple months back you saw a large spike in development activity. Just because before know Terra was a simple chain, there are only a couple people who maintain it, I think like one or two people who do the whole chain because it's so simple. But since we have to think about all this other stuff with allowing an execution layer and having people be able to upload their own code and run it on.
00:34:10.090 - 00:34:57.880, Speaker A: Great, thanks. Thanks for insight. Yeah. So Ernesto Ave. I mean, you saw the biggest relative increase of all, at least in Defi and I guess similarly a rise in the total assets, total value locked and the value of the token. So really old charts were up, I guess went up, I guess for frave during 2020. Can you say a bit about how that was? And was a lot of that on core protocol or were there a lot of auxiliary projects added to hear about that?
00:34:58.810 - 00:36:10.474, Speaker C: Yeah, well, like you say, for habitat, 2020 was like really crazy year, but in the good sense, because mainly it's everything about growth. So here is about the growth in code and like you say, that at the end of the year and during the year in general, but yes, at the end of the year there is like a huge spike, but also in terms of TBL, in terms of token, everything like a bit of insights of that growth at the end of the year that in my case I was participating directly on that development is that in December, beginning of December we released the version two of the protocol. That is quite big step. But also we release the version two of our governance. That is like the final governance. A bit before we did, two months before we did the date of the token, also from the migration from the previous land token to the other token. So there was a lot of activity, but I would say like core projects activity, we have also some auxiliary tools and some repos.
00:36:10.474 - 00:37:12.670, Speaker C: But I think during that time was a bit lower. I mean still growing, but not at the rhythm of the core projects. And actually most probably now is when these tooling projects are getting a bit more of raw commits. In terms of contributors, it's more or less the same. We started during 2021st of all, we were developing quite a lot of things during 2020 in private rep and then doing syncs on GitHub because we were using GitLab for example. But then at some point we decided to, once we were a bit more mature as ecosystem, we decided to start moving the development to GitHub completely public. And right now we are in that stage of trying to onboard more contributors and trying to be the most transparent as possible, even in terms of open source.
00:37:14.790 - 00:37:57.566, Speaker A: Yeah, got it, thanks. We have a question from the audience, can take it and can continue with more questions for myself on my side as well, but I want to make sure that we answer this one and for anyone else in the audience, do shoot us your questions in the ask a question box so that we can get them in front of our guests. So this is from Stephen. What is your opinion on the next d five trends to expect in this year? In 2021, I'm going to open it up if anyone wants to take it. Otherwise I'm going to call the name, but I'd like to have all of you your views on it.
00:37:57.748 - 00:38:43.422, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there are a lot of things happening. One thing that I personally have been seeing a lot of that I think is a nascent trend which is going to explode. Maybe not in the next year, but I would say definitely in the next five years. Or know the timelines are all compressing because everything is accelerating. So it probably won't be five years. But I just think nfts in general and nfts integrating in with video games, I think imagine playing Zelda, breath of the wild, and every single item that you interact with, from apples to swords to spell potion books to everything, are nfts that you own and that you can go then exchange on decentralized, on dexes decentralized exchanges. I have a twelve year old son, and we play video games quite often.
00:38:43.422 - 00:39:25.674, Speaker D: It's one of our favorite hobies, and even he internalizes even that. I can see just from the look on his face how great he thinks that idea was to be able to own and trade in game assets. And so I just think nfts in general, but also, I just think there's an incredibly ripe opportunity for NFT integration with things like video games. So turning on an entirely new generation of people, the generation that comes after us, and then having an impact on something that they're very close and attached to, which is gaming. Gaming culture is huge. Esports are larger than traditional sports now. So that's something I've been seeing a lot on my radar that I think is going to be really big.
00:39:25.674 - 00:39:27.850, Speaker D: NFT integration with video games.
00:39:31.650 - 00:40:06.070, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. I was very much on point with our new investment thesis that we just released just last week. Entirely that and more. But, yeah, this interconnection between deFi, nfts, financial instruments, which are open, you have nfts which are sovereign, virtual goods. They can interact. They can interact with virtual worlds, be it games, be it spaces, be it places to connect, to collaborate, et cetera.
00:40:06.070 - 00:40:20.400, Speaker A: We are strong believers in that. So, yeah, great to hear. William, how about you? What do you think are the. The biggest, the next d five trends in 2020 going to be, or 21, sorry, 2021?
00:40:22.130 - 00:42:02.502, Speaker E: So I think at Terra, we have an interesting perspective on how we can make a dent in DeFi, is that rather than catering to integrating slowly into incremental iterations of adding it to another space of games, what we try to do is we try to completely take over a space in the pursuit of mass adoption. How we did for, say, payments. Right. Instead of trying to go by merchant by merchant, we start by creating a platform that's really easy to use and that is really attractive to the merchants, such that it becomes sort of viral. And that's how now we have the chai card, where everything is integrated with the blockchain. So probably Korea has the largest population of people who are inadvertently using the blockchain, as Michael Eric had tweeted out. So what we're trying to do, or what we see the trend in doing, is that there are other parts of Defi that when we started with chai, we thought that a lot of the value that was made possible by crypto wasn't accessible by the mainstream user who was not aware of crypto.
00:42:02.566 - 00:42:02.806, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:02.848 - 00:43:12.740, Speaker E: So in order to bridge that gap, we created the terra stablecoin, which allowed people to pay with less fees, giving that value to the customer by giving that in the form of discounts, as the discounts that you can get on Chi and on many of these merchants. So another thing about DeFi that we want to bring to the mainstream is the concept of savings account. So things like anchor will bring the high yields that you see in DeFi to people who wouldn't know anything about crypto, but want to get those high yields in their USD. So I think that the trend is just taking a lot of the low hanging fruit out there. With a DeFi savings product, you can easily get a lot of the attention because of the rates that you can, the competitive rates against what is normally considered a high yield interest account. So I think that is kind of where Defi will head, at least for us, in 2021.
00:43:14.230 - 00:43:20.334, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. So it's really opening it up to the rest of the world, right? Yeah.
00:43:20.392 - 00:43:25.750, Speaker E: Who may not necessarily even need to be consciously aware that it is powered by DeFi.
00:43:26.490 - 00:43:34.582, Speaker A: They suddenly have an app that gives them multiples of the interest that they will get at their bank and that is trustworthy.
00:43:34.646 - 00:43:58.290, Speaker E: So let's go infrastructurely building the bridge to fiat, or just building that connection such that they don't need to be aware. And they just received 10% in USD in gains every year. I think that's what's going to be less flashy, but it's going to have the most impact on getting more users.
00:43:59.990 - 00:44:08.070, Speaker A: Great, thanks. And how about you, Ernesto? What do you think are going to be some of the big trends in Defi for this year and beyond?
00:44:08.570 - 00:45:15.334, Speaker C: Well, I think that, for example, the point of Gabriel of NFTs is pretty clear. So there is not really much to comment on that direction, but something that I'm not fully sure if it's going to be a trend, but at least for me, it will be really interesting to see how it's going to evolve. Is that right now we are at a point where core protocols are more or less already developed, at least the basic engine. And now the main mission, let's say, is to onboard other contributors and join people to develop more things on top. And this leads to really interesting problems of coordination, because it's development in one side in what relates to DeFi, but at the same time, it has a really big component of economics and, for example, risk analysis. So it's one of the things that we in Abe are trying to work on is how to coordinate this. Like these really different profiles of people that they came to work together in the same protocol.
00:45:15.334 - 00:45:35.970, Speaker C: That is not only like a piece of software that only the developer background can work in. So I think that coordination is going to be really interesting to see how it goes to scale. Like having hundreds of developers working in a piece of software that involves economics, risks, and software.
00:45:38.790 - 00:45:54.102, Speaker A: Like. If I would have to summarize Williams as making DeFi available to the public, you're talking more about making the core DeFi protocols accessible to a wider group of developers, including their economics, and seeing.
00:45:54.236 - 00:46:05.420, Speaker C: How that works out and the coordination around that. That is nothing that we actually saw before, I think. Not at this scale, at least.
00:46:05.790 - 00:46:09.446, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Well, I mean, that little flash loan.
00:46:09.478 - 00:46:11.054, Speaker B: Thingy that you introduced, or that you.
00:46:11.092 - 00:46:15.450, Speaker A: At least co introduced, that had some coordination effects, surely.
00:46:15.530 - 00:46:42.040, Speaker C: Yeah. If you think about it, that is one of the main points of flash loan, because in order to execute, let's say, interesting action is not only about knowing the technicalities of the protocols that you are interacting with that is needed, but also about finding, for example, arbitrage opportunities or certain asymmetries in systems. It's like, really interesting.
00:46:45.530 - 00:46:46.502, Speaker A: You want to say something?
00:46:46.556 - 00:47:41.994, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there are two other trends that are probably worth mentioning that I see as well. Number one, I think we are genuinely at the beginning of mainstream adoption by so called mom and pop investors. And I'm sure everybody on this call has been getting reached out to in the same way we were in 2017, by all of our family and friends wanting to know what's up. But I think we're in a new paradigm now, and I think there's multiple. There are multiple things that are converging that are going to cause crypto to take off what I believe will be in a permanent way. Now, the first is obviously with COVID and the entire world is kind of going into an economic spin, and there's been a lot of wealth generated, and then there's also been a lot of people who shifted from middle class to lower middle class, or there's been a huge increase in poverty around the world. So on the one side, you have people who are losing money trying to figure out what the next play is, and on the other side, you have people in crypto who are making a lot of money.
00:47:41.994 - 00:48:27.894, Speaker D: If you look at the crypto markets over the last four or five months, they've done exceptionally well. And so there's this signal that's being sent out to the mom and pops all around the world that there is this hugely unique opportunity. And there's so many more rails to on ramp into the crypto ecosystem than there were even in 2017. And then this is amplified by the fact that I believe the statistic is one out of every $4 that have ever been printed in the United States have been printed in the year 2020. And so we have this sort of like, this situation where they're just continually printing more and more money faster and faster, and it's hitting this peak. And so that's going to feed more into crypto. And that's what gun has been saying this entire year.
00:48:27.894 - 00:49:03.646, Speaker D: He expected this price to go up simply because of all the money the US was injecting into the economy because of COVID So I think that's one. I really do genuinely believe that we are at the beginning of the inflection point where we're going to see mainstream adoption. I think the US dollar being endlessly printed. I think a lot of people losing money due to Covid and losing jobs, and then seeing all of the gains that are happening in crypto. I believe the technology is maturing, and then I think there's more on ramps. So I do think that we're at a unique point where we're going to just start seeing mainstream adoption. Sure, the prices could go down again, but I believe that from here on out, things will accelerate.
00:49:03.646 - 00:49:50.622, Speaker D: And then the other thing I think is worth mentioning is I think we're also going to see an acceleration of the decentralized web infrastructure. So one of the big things that's been happening over 2020 is people being deplatformed. And whether or not you agree with what the people are saying, it's sort of a signal of censorship. And we're at a very fortunate time in history where we're developing these censorship resistant technologies. And so I think that the deplatforming is going to accelerate the adoption of decentralized web. I know something that I see in my deal flow nearly daily now is ipfs and filecoin integration. So it's clear to me that we're at a place where the decentralized web, because necessity is the mother of invention, and we're at a place where we really do need a censorship resistant infrastructure.
00:49:50.622 - 00:50:02.550, Speaker D: So I think those two things are also trends that are going to accelerate the adoption of this technology by the mom and pop investor class and then the acceleration of the decentralized web infrastructure.
00:50:03.610 - 00:50:38.660, Speaker A: Great, thanks. Yeah, so I think that's a really good note to close off on, actually. I want to make sure that we finish on time. So, yeah, we're going mainstream finally. And I think from looking at these technologies, in my case, since 2014, in professional capacity. We are now at a space where there are many mature platforms. The charts that we're looking at here, it's not that there's only one platform to build on and the others are messing around.
00:50:38.660 - 00:51:21.780, Speaker A: There are many that are really mature, that have really closed developer communities, that have good tooling, that have live chains that address different quality properties. Some optimize more for like you said with Terra, like you went for the money use case took that really well and scalable. And with avalanche, of course, you have another. Yeah, I share that sentiment, especially on the building side, but also increasingly so on the financial side. Let them come. Right, we're ready. Open up.
00:51:21.780 - 00:52:05.470, Speaker A: So yeah, exciting to see what's going to happen in 2021. I just want to give a small and loud shout out. Ventures. As I said, we run an accelerator. We're in the fourth cohort with eleven really exciting teams, but we're also recruiting for the fifth cohort. So if you're building something in DFI, in nfts, in the open metaverse, if you're working with in game items and making them tradable or interest bearing on ave or those kind of things, if you're building on avalanche, if you're building on Aave, if you're building on Terra, do come to us and help us help you be successful. Let us help you be successful.
00:52:05.470 - 00:52:16.610, Speaker A: I want to thank you all very much. Just very briefly, where should people go if they want to learn more about Ave NSo?
00:52:18.870 - 00:52:49.980, Speaker C: Well, I think for developers to docsabe.com and the developer guide, there is really good about how to integrate the protocol and so on. But also our discord there is quite a lot of activity and to ask direct questions. And of course there are also a lot of hackathons like for example, right now is finishing market make. So hackathons are really good place to enter in contact with the team.
00:52:51.470 - 00:52:57.518, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah, thanks. And on Avalanche, Gabrielle, where should people go?
00:52:57.684 - 00:53:30.026, Speaker D: Sure. So you can check out Docs Avocs network if you are a developer, we have very extensive documentation. I myself help maintain it and we do our best to keep it always up to date. We also have a very active discord and we have a very active telegram and you can reach out to me personally, CG Cardona CGcar Dona at Twitter or telegram, or you can even drop me an email. Gabriel@avalabs.org it's my job and my task to help on ramp as many people as I can to the ecosystem. So feel free to reach out to me.
00:53:30.026 - 00:53:36.940, Speaker D: But yeah, primarily check out docs Avex network and then join our discord. We're incredibly active and responsive all the time.
00:53:37.550 - 00:53:41.760, Speaker A: Thanks. Great. And finally, William, where do people learn about.
00:53:47.410 - 00:54:28.460, Speaker E: So coming into Terra? Obviously there's like a lot to since we're so spread out in many different projects and I think the official site doesn't really give you good grounding. So you can find out more information at Docs Terra Money for developer docs. And right now I think the best place to look is on our GitHub where a lot of our projects have readmes and going into. Those are interesting, right? And we also have a telegram and discord which are available on our main page and on our docs Terra money.
00:54:31.090 - 00:54:46.820, Speaker A: Great, thanks. Still waiting for the moment when somebody says yeah, no, we communicate on IRC. That's our main communication channel. Doesn't really happen these days anymore, but Discord seems to have all the momentum in telegram. Great muddit, any final words?
00:54:47.510 - 00:54:51.140, Speaker B: No, no, I think we've covered it all.
00:54:51.910 - 00:55:16.054, Speaker A: All right then. Thanks a lot everybody. Thanks Ernesto, thanks Gabrielle, thanks William for coming on. And thanks mudit of course for coming on and all of your work to reports. And thanks everyone in the audience here on Twitter and LinkedIn YouTube dlive for watching us today. We shall soon be back. Follow our channels to learn about the next session.
00:55:16.054 - 00:55:21.580, Speaker A: We do these tech Tuesdays regularly with projects around space. Thanks all.
00:55:22.430 - 00:55:22.920, Speaker C: Bye everyone.
