Today. I'm really happy to welcome on Tasha Panya Nehra mit of Alpha Finance Labs. Welcome, Tasha. Did I get the pronunciation perfect?
00:00:58.884 - 00:01:02.618, Speaker B: Hi, thanks for having me. Yep, you got the pronunciation correct.
00:01:02.724 - 00:01:42.110, Speaker A: All right. Well, thank you for the coaching before we started. So, Alpha Finance Labs is a ecosystem of automated, yield maximizing Defi cross chain products, starting on the binance smart chain and ethereum. The vision is to reform traditional finance in a decentralized manner. You were previously head of strategy at band protocol. You have been a product manager at Tencent and investment banker at places like Jeffries, and you've pretty much worked all around the world, from San Francisco to London to Bangkok. So the reason why I wanted to get you on the show, there are several.
00:01:42.110 - 00:02:36.682, Speaker A: Firstly, I came across you by seeing that you were backed by some of the leading vcs in the DeFi space, including Spartan Group, multi coin Cap and Defiance Capital. You're actually the first founder we've had from Thailand and back when I was traveling out in Asia and Southeast Asia, tail end of last year feels like a lifetime ago now. Thailand actually kept on coming up in a number of conversations about how it was hotting up as a destination for crypto and potentially for DeFi more generally. So I really want to kind of get to the heart of that. And of course, that's where a lot of the band protocol team and founders are also from. So you are our first founder from Thailand, and so I want to kind of go into what's happening there. And you've also been announcing a number of really exciting partnerships.
00:02:36.682 - 00:03:21.626, Speaker A: I believe just this week announced a partnership with SCB Ten X, which is the venture arm of one of the largest commercial banks in Thailand, Siam Commercial bank. So want to explore with you and understand your views on institutional adoption of DFI generally, and of course that in the spectrum of what we mean by institutional, and of course the retail adoption that will hopefully be coming off the back of this specific collaboration. So to give a background as to your origin story going all the way back. You studied chemistry at Stanford, I believe. Stanford Summer College, yeah.
00:03:21.648 - 00:03:28.666, Speaker B: So that was more of a summer program when I was in high school, but my undergraduate degree was in economics at UC Berkeley.
00:03:28.778 - 00:04:22.480, Speaker A: Right. And then before that, you were at an international school in Bangkok, Thailand. And then, as you say, you went on to Berkeley and did a ba in economics, graduating in 2016, and received a number of awards whilst you were there, including leadership awards, scholarship. You were a finalist in the big ideas Berkeley competition, which is an innovation contest at Berkeley, and several other things. So clearly you excelled within academia, and then you spent a few years interning at a mix of different financial institutions, I guess venture capital, investment banking, private equity at the likes of creative ventures in San Francisco, Wilshire, Patrick securities in Bangkok, and also Bangkok. Well, ey. And then Deloitte, right?
00:04:22.790 - 00:04:23.346, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:23.448 - 00:04:54.334, Speaker A: You then went to be an investment banking analyst at places like Jeffrey's here in the UK in 2018. Product manager at Tencent from 18 to 20. And then you joined band protocol as head of strategy beginning part of this year, Jan 2020. So tell us a little bit about your journey from Tencent, I guess, into crypto and specifically band.
00:04:54.482 - 00:05:59.226, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I have been investing in crypto since about 2016 17, and pretty much followed the industry since then. And what I realized is I came from traditional finance. Finance is something that I have always been interested in and also cryptocurrency and blockchain. So it used to be something separate back in the days, and there was not huge adoption of Defi. And then when I know of band protocol, and at the moment that I joined, they are actually working on their new chain, pretty much band chain, and changed from providing data on Ethereum itself to be a separate chain. And that's when I realized that there is a huge gap that I can bring to them and pretty much drive the adoption of data oracle to various DeFi protocols.
00:05:59.226 - 00:06:18.246, Speaker B: So I could also tap into the decentralized finance area that I'm a lot more interested in. And that's really much how I really dig deeper into DeFi and saw a lot of the gaps that can be filled, and which is why I left to build Alpha Finance lab with my colleague Nipun as well.
00:06:18.428 - 00:07:02.318, Speaker A: And so you did that in July 2020. So it's all relatively new, very fast moving. Maybe before we go into some of the detail, it'd be interesting to understand. So, as I said in the intro, when I was traveling in Asia last year, especially when I was in places like Singapore, but even mainland China, Thailand, kept on coming up in conversation in the context of crypto and defi, what's going on there? And is there a very deliberate reason why you've chosen to kind of base alpha finance labs out of Bangkok rather than, say, moving to Singapore or a different hub?
00:07:02.494 - 00:07:45.570, Speaker B: Good question. I mean, several reasons. Number one definitely is there is a lot of demand and interest from the local community. And as you have mentioned already, that there is significant conversations that Thailand was brought up. And I think that's mainly because of the developing country nature, where the structure and the financial systems are not as strong as other developed countries. So that's definitely number one. Number two is that I have been in the space and have talked to multiple people, including different banks, institutional players, or even bigger firms like Tencent itself, where I used to work.
00:07:45.570 - 00:08:08.070, Speaker B: And a lot of them are actually aware of blockchain, of defi, and they are keenly to move towards that direction when opportunities arise. So when combining a lot of different things, and I already was here in Thailand when I was starting off our finance lab, then, you know, it makes sense to be here. So that's pretty much the background.
00:08:08.890 - 00:08:41.460, Speaker A: So I know we might get onto this a little bit later, especially with the work that you're doing with one of the commercial banks there. But I also heard that at a regulatory level, the government is fairly pro crypto, or at least experimentation in fintech generally. And I guess when you mentioned that there's fairly immature kind of retail banking, do you see that as an opportunity to go over the top of, I guess, what might be a legacy financial system anywhere else?
00:08:42.390 - 00:09:21.850, Speaker B: Definitely there is a chance, but at the same time, I would give it some room for the government to experiment and take time, because when it comes to governmental projects, it definitely can take time. And that's why we and the Siam commercial bank that we partner with are looking to speed up that governmental processes and their attention to push Defi forward. Because if there's no partnership happen, if there's no projects like us in the country, then it could take many more years than otherwise.
00:09:22.010 - 00:09:46.760, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm interested to know, what is the attitude towards crypto generally within an organization like Tencent? I know there's a number of initiatives coming out, especially in the kind of province of Shanghai or the city of Shanghai. But generally, if you look in, and I don't know, were you involved in a regional part of the Tencent business?
00:09:47.470 - 00:10:57.360, Speaker B: Yeah, somewhat. The product that I worked on was pretty much developed out of here, but it is reported to Tencent, China, pretty much to oversee the growth of Southeast Asia expansion. And we are liaison with them on that front. But in terms of their sentiment on crypto, I can't speak much to it, but if I were to make more my own assumption, from what I've known of their occurrences with crypto or even their relationship with chinese government, there are a number of things that I would say. Number one is pretty much that China and big companies like Tencent definitely are really aware and not sure if you've known that chinese government already paid out some of the governmental employees in their digital yuan. So they are very SaaS on that, even if they haven't gone into crypto explicitly. But there are a number of projects that they have used similar concepts, like digital coin and digital payment.
00:10:57.360 - 00:11:33.078, Speaker B: Maybe it's very different. But if you look in terms of the concept underlying concept itself, one of the products is called jups, which is the music streaming, and they are pretty much finding a way to apply the concept of digital coin and distribute to the users. So users have more say in how the interaction is, how to interact with the artists. So if you look at the underlying level, the concepts are pretty much quite similar in some aspects, although more amateur than a typical crypto coin.
00:11:33.174 - 00:12:01.380, Speaker A: Right. Maybe before we go into the specifics of alpha, it would be good to get an understanding of, I guess, the motivation behind setting up alpha. Like, what is it a response to? Is it a specific gap in the defi space? Is it a particular problem that you think could be addressed? How do you frame the reason for Alpha before we go into the product itself?
00:12:01.750 - 00:12:45.934, Speaker B: Yeah, there are multiple gaps that I saw and Nipun saw, and we agreed on these things, and that's why we built Alpha finance lab with these visions. So the three problems that we saw pretty much. Number one is that a lot of the projects actually spend time, a lot of time building products that in the end, don't get adoption. Or maybe it's something that is too advanced for defi landscape right now. So that's pretty much one gap that we see, right. There is a gap between supply and demand. There are a lot of great products out there as the supply, but doesn't fit with the demand right now, perhaps.
00:12:45.934 - 00:14:00.822, Speaker B: Maybe it's something that the demand doesn't want, or sometimes it's because the supply of products are too mature, comparing to the current demand landscape. So that's number one. Number two is that there are a lot of products as well that are not as user friendly. And we believe that if we want to drive Defi to the next stage and expand it even further. We need to make it more friendly, make it so that users can make it easy for them to use and welcome more new defi users by doing so. And pretty much the third one is how there are so many DeFi projects on Ethereum and in the mean, the good thing is that there is high composability, but the bad thing is also that drives up the fees and in turns turn away the retail users from using these products that were built for them. So we combined a lot of different things that we saw and pretty much form our strategy around that and our products around our strategy.
00:14:00.822 - 00:15:07.726, Speaker B: And to give you a bit very high level of how we work and the strategy that we do to pretty much address all of these, one is that we take time to understand the problems, to understand how we can come up with innovative solutions, run simulations on different ideas, and then bounce with different investors, invest in different people in the space. Right. But at the same time, we don't rush to build something that we don't believe is going to stick to the market, is going to be really innovative. So that's why we also have the second strategy, which is a bit different from understanding the problem and really see how we can build and solve that problem. For the second strategy, pretty much to understand the landscape and see what else our users want to use, but they don't have the product to use for. And we matched the first strategy and the second strategy to build the products. So to give you a very high level, alpha Homora came about.
00:15:07.726 - 00:16:01.898, Speaker B: Alpha Homora, which is one of the first products that we built, came about because we spotted number of market gaps. And I can tell you later, at a later time or for the next question, but pretty much once we launched, we were able to get a total value locked of about 19 million within 24 hours. So we combined a number of market gaps that we saw and really pushed the product out with product market fit. So now we are going to expand from there and then drive d five forward. That's pretty much on the usage part, and building products that have demand. But at the same time, Alpha Homora and all the products that we're going to build will also have something that's very user friendly. So at the back end, Alpha Homora actually automates a number of steps for users.
00:16:01.898 - 00:16:43.280, Speaker B: And from the user's perspective, they only have to click on three clicks and that's pretty much done. So that's the second thing. And the third thing that I mentioned is how Defi on ethereum is getting very crowded. And I think in order for us to help position defi beyond ethereum, of course it's going to be, Ethereum will be a key component, but we have to start expanding Defi beyond that. And that's why we are building our second product on both binance smart chain and Ethereum, to drive that across chain defi forward.
00:16:44.690 - 00:17:26.090, Speaker A: Yeah, and I know cross chain Defi is an important part of your strategy, as well as cross chain liquidity. So just to kind of close off on the structure of alpha labs itself. So is it fair to describe you almost as a studio to incubate and kind of rapidly test and deploy defi products? Would these things become their own businesses? Or is it a suite of smart contracts that effectively could be used by the same user? Or are they for different customer segments entirely?
00:17:26.910 - 00:18:05.158, Speaker B: So it's a bit of both, actually. So each different product solves their own problems and tap its own unaddressed demand segment. But at the end of the day, there is going to be a way to leverage those products together. So as an example, alpha Homora, there are two types of users on alpha Homora. One is eth lender. So you can get the highest ease lending rate on alpha Homora, period. Just before this podcast, it was about 16% interest rate on ease just from lending ease, and you cannot find that anywhere else.
00:18:05.158 - 00:18:39.582, Speaker B: So that's from lending perspective. The other user on alpha Homora is youth farmers. So if they want to go leverage on youth farming, that's where you can do it. This is the only place where you can do it. So working together, you have this one product called homora. Right. But technically, by taking leverage position on ute farming pool on afahomora, you're actually shorting east because you have to borrow some ease from the contract to ute farm.
00:18:39.582 - 00:19:06.300, Speaker B: And as a result, that's how you can leverage a second product, which is in the perpetual swap area to take the counter position or the long on east position, so you can hedge your risk out. And that's how we are going to connect between the two products. Maybe on the front end or maybe on the smart contract level, but at the end of the day, there's going to be connection between the two products.
00:19:07.310 - 00:19:56.810, Speaker A: Understood. And so, at least as far as I understand it, and I appreciate this is a very large casual term, but like Asia generally, and maybe as a subset, Southeast Asia, the perception has been in the west, and my perspective formed by people like Dovi, that Asia's been slow to catch on to. So I guess the classic assumption would be that somehow you would be localizing existing defi, but actually it sounds very different. It sounds like you're more focused on introducing entirely new innovations, but perhaps using a local retail base to kind of grow liquidity and stuff. Is that a correct assumption?
00:19:57.630 - 00:20:34.760, Speaker B: I would not agree totally. Although the team is based mostly out of here, our users and our community is actually globally, and majority of the users on alpha Homora are actually from the US, the UK, China, and we are looking to expand beyond these three regions for sure. But at the end of the day, I think crypto and blockchain definitely is a global market, so liquidity locally helps, but at the same time, we are not limiting to liquidity here.
00:20:35.290 - 00:20:49.414, Speaker A: Yes. So how much emphasis will be placed on the localization of your products? Or are you kind of just starting from the basis of these products are going to be introduced at a global level because of the permissionless nature?
00:20:49.462 - 00:22:11.350, Speaker B: I guess so. I would say it's not focused on localized local community in a sense that we are pushing the adoption to people locally, even though they are not in Defi, because how we think of it is a lot of the demand right now in DeFi has been captured, but there are also a number of areas that haven't been tapped with the current DeFi landscape. So that's the target that we're targeting. If thai people or local people are in that target, then definitely they're within our target users. But in terms of pushing the local adoption, I think that's more of on the education side and also on working with local big firms like SCB Ten X, which is the venture arm of one of the largest commercial bank in Thailand, to pretty much push out forward the DFI landscape in Thailand. Because without our help, without this partnership, it would take a long time, as I said earlier. So I think on the local landscape side, it's more on what can we do to change the landscape more, and as a result can drive more adoption of DeFi from the local retail or institutional players.
00:22:12.410 - 00:22:12.774, Speaker A: Great.
00:22:12.812 - 00:22:12.966, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:12.988 - 00:22:33.680, Speaker A: And I definitely want to get into that working relationship. It sounds really exciting to understand the kind of feedback loop that's happening there. So let's jump into the products. As I understand it, you've got alpha lending, I think you mentioned already Alpha Homora, and was there a third one that you've recently announced, or is that an extension of one of these existing products?
00:22:34.290 - 00:23:08.906, Speaker B: So we have Alpha Homora and the second product is this new product in the perpetual swap area. We haven't had a name yet, but it's pretty much an extension as well as a totally new product. So you can think of it as an extension from Homora because it allows you to take the market neutral leverage position. Right. By using Alpha Homora, you're shorting eth. And as a result you can take the long position on this perpetual swap product that we're building. And so that's how it extends from Homora in a sense.
00:23:08.906 - 00:24:08.554, Speaker B: But it's also a new target segment that we're capturing because we're actually capturing the traders who are trading long and short perpetual swaps already on either centralized solutions or the other decentralized products. And we are implementing it in a very different way from the other decentralized protocols out there. And we think that the space for perpetuous swap is really large. If you look at the trading volume on the centralized solutions, like finance, it's about 2,000,000,024 hours trading volume, and that's six times more than bitcoin spot trading. So the 2 billion professional volume is only for bitcoin. So that's how large it is. And if you look at that number in the decentralized protocols available out there, there are not that many out there and the trading volume is also not as high.
00:24:08.554 - 00:24:23.838, Speaker B: So we believe that there is a large market that we could capture and there is also enough room for multiple designs and other protocols have different designs. And let's see how we can work together in complementing the designs.
00:24:24.014 - 00:25:01.550, Speaker A: So you talked a little bit about this interoperability out of the gate. So as you mean naturally it works with Ethereum as it is, but you've also rolled out across binance smart chain. So how do you see? Well, firstly, are you looking at other environments like Polkadot or Cosmos? And then secondly, with something like binance smart chain, how do you look at the relationship between what you're building and binance and centralized exchanges like binance?
00:25:02.130 - 00:25:58.730, Speaker B: Good question. So yes, we have looked at the other chains, definitely. And the reason that we say we're starting on Binance March and Ethereum, that's because we're not limiting to these two. So when we find fit, we're definitely going to expand to other chains as well. And in terms of binance itself, we definitely see a lot of synergy that we can bring together. So first of all, the perpetual swap product that I mentioned, it's going to be on both Ethereum and binance smart chain, right? And Ethereum definitely, because there's a huge defi demand right there. And at the same time on binance smart chain, there is a huge group of traders who are already trading on binance, and if they are looking for decentralized version, then they can find that version on binance marching very easily.
00:25:58.730 - 00:26:50.960, Speaker B: So they will still be in the binance ecosystem and still be able to use their perpetual swap, be it on centralized or decentralized version. And down the line, there are a number of ways that we are looking to work with Binance and also the other centralized exchanges to really much bridge and onboard those users who are using centralized exchanges. Whenever they're ready to come to DeFi, then we would be helping them to bridge to deFi. So that's pretty much down the line of our goal, and that's why we want to start making relationship and helping binance to grow BSC right now, so that when that adoption from CFI users come in, then we would be ready to help them.
00:26:51.330 - 00:28:23.534, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think this is a really interesting debate in DeFi generally now about where adoption comes from, where the demand comes from. As you said, there's like almost an oversupply. And so on the one hand, you have centralized exchanges like binance, on the other hand, you have a bank like Sab, and maybe somewhere in the middle you have some fintech startups. I mean, I could imagine that all three of those could be seen as a distribution channel for the DeFi products that you create and gateways to kind of bring new demand into the system. So as a young organization, in terms of relative size and maturity, how do you engage? Well, firstly, strategically, do you see these as distribution channels, and how do you then engage with them? And like an engagement, for example, with the more extreme end of the spectrum, a banking institution in Thailand, as a startup, that can be very demanding from a time perspective, from a resource perspective. Sorry, two questions there. So, strategically, how do you look at that spectrum of institutional organizations? Do you see them as a distribution channel? And then second question, how do you prioritize and engage with each of those?
00:28:23.572 - 00:29:57.850, Speaker B: As an early startup distributional channel, you can think of multiple ways of what you distribute. So let's say with binance, what we're really helping to drive is not only expanding DeFi beyond Ethereum, and as a result bring more users, be it binance users, be it other retail users who want to enter into deFi, but Ethereum gas fee is too high, or be know binance users from centralized exchange that are trading on binance already, but now they are exposed to DeFi on BSc. So if you look from binance perspective, there are a number of ways that we can distribute to this ecosystem or pretty much add value to this ecosystem. Number one, pretty much is to build on BSE so that when these demand come in, we would be able to capture and pretty much help grow DeFi on this chain. And at the end of the day, we are here for the long run, and hopefully we are also going to bridge multiple products and in multiple chains so that we could help drive this interoperability for DeFi. In the beginning, it might be just on the asset level. For instance, if your assets on Ethereum can be parked to port to BSE and then cross over and use the different products onto ecosystem very easily.
00:29:57.850 - 00:30:09.150, Speaker B: But later on we really hope to drive the connection beyond just token transfer. So that would take a bit more time, but we are eyeing on that as well.
00:30:09.300 - 00:30:30.550, Speaker A: And just on that point, sorry to interrupt on that point, do you see the things that you'll be building in the labs as a standalone product and or a feature that could then be enabled on the binance exchange as a consequence of your integration into their chain?
00:30:31.690 - 00:31:30.090, Speaker B: There are multiple things. So number one, depending on the product itself, product nature itself, sometimes it would make sense to only be on Ethereum, for instance, alpha homora right now as of right now, because we're building on uniswap, so it is on Ethereum. But at the end of the day, we are not limiting to Ethereum. And if there are a number of youth farming pools that are very attractive on BSc and we evaluate the risks and it makes sense, then definitely we're going to deploy alpha homora on BSE to capture another demand segment. So that's one point. The second point is that some of the products would make sense on both chains. And if they are going to be on both chains, then there may be some features that will make sense to add on BSc because of the cheaper gas and the faster transaction processing time.
00:31:30.090 - 00:32:08.040, Speaker B: So let's say with the propellerswap product, when we launch on Ethereum and binance smart chain, then we're going to see how we can optimize the features, optimize the user experience to the maximum given the different blockchain that we're working on. So one example can be, with binance smart chain being faster and cheaper gas, perhaps we can enable the leverage to be higher. So that's just one example in terms of how we are thinking of deploying different products and having different products to work together.
00:32:10.170 - 00:32:35.550, Speaker A: Great. And then the other end of the spectrum, which is this engagement that you have with SAP ten x so how do you see that relationship? And I know off air, you mentioned that there's this kind of feedback loop, there's kind of some shared learning. How do you understand that relationship and how do you hope it evolves?
00:32:37.330 - 00:33:18.374, Speaker B: Number of ways. Number one, pretty much, if you think of it in terms of the really long term, right, how we're going to drive mass adoption would definitely come from education. And education comes from, first, the heart of the institutions who can make the change. And pretty much that's the bank. And this is the venture arm, SCP ten X. This is the venture arm of the bank. They are very interested in Defi, and by working with us, they are able to adapt a number of different things and see how they can push forward the regulation so that they could do multiple projects.
00:33:18.374 - 00:34:47.000, Speaker B: For example, they are trying to work on the stablecoin project right now with new learnings and insights that they get from us. Perhaps they can have multiple data points, multiple angles that they can help and push the regulations to be more friendly on that front. So that's pretty much number one on the education and really the long term perspective. And in terms of the midterm and near term perspective, they are also, and we are also getting a lot of pretty much working together and share the development resources so we can build more alpha products that not only take into account the DeFi landscape, but also take into account the information and insights that financial services people and pretty much the resources that have spent years in the financial services, so that they can bring in those insights and help us to build product that are more insightful and pretty much expand the finance landscape further as well. And at the end of the day, it's really much on who can innovate faster. And in terms of innovation itself, it's definitely not just going to come from ourselves, or not just going to come from other DeFi protocols. But I think it's also important to expand to the traditional finance, as they have years of experience in the traditional finance services and see what we can apply from them.
00:34:47.610 - 00:35:43.820, Speaker A: Yeah, fascinating. So I'm going to be interested to know how the engagement happened with SAB. I believe that's just for clarification, part of the Siam commercial bank. So clearly, you mentioned earlier the word risk, and I think most people in DeFi appreciate the risk that's involved through largely the composability. But of course, it has a number of different vectors. How do you convince an institution, especially one that is a regulated retail bank, to firstly appreciate and then get comfortable with the level of risk in DeFi now and then, presumably, I guess, overcome concerns that by them introducing that risk into the wider economic system, the problems that might come with that.
00:35:45.390 - 00:36:36.966, Speaker B: Well, first of all, sab ten x isn't new to DFI, isn't new to crypto. They invested in ripple. They also invested in blockfi, which is the lending protocol. So they have expressed interest in DeFi for a long time, and they also have been trying to push out the stablecoin project here in Thailand. So they're working pretty closely with the regulatory segment on that. So we, as in Alpha Finance lab, have been in the space and have been talking to SCB Ten X about different angles that we can help push DFI adoption further. So, pretty much that's how the partnership came about, because we really want to help expand the DeFi landscape in Thailand or even in Asia and beyond.
00:36:36.966 - 00:37:51.342, Speaker B: But in term of risks itself, I believe that definitely, if users are using DeFi products now, there are definitely going to be a number of risks that they have to be mindful of. But in terms of the institutional players and onboarding retail to DeFi, I believe that's going to take a long time, and that's going to also enter from the least risky products. So, for instance, in terms of lending product as opposed to yield farming. Right. Because with you farming, you also have to educate people on impermanent loss, on multiple things as well, but from lending aspects, I think that's something that if we see adoption from Thailand and if we see adoption in developing countries, I think that would come from lending, which is more on the least risky side. But at the end of the day, there will also be smart contract risks and other attacks that we have to prevent. And that's why we have a really strong team of researchers and engineers to work on that, pretty much to mitigate those risks.
00:37:51.342 - 00:38:26.190, Speaker B: So, just to give you some of the data points, our CTO, Nipun, he got four gold medals and one silver medal from International mathematical Olympiad, and he's really strong on the quant computer science part and really the one behind different parameters that we set, different pools that we add on offer Homora, so that there is high mitigation of attacks, high mitigation of risk, and pretty much make it more friendly to new DeFi users.
00:38:27.570 - 00:38:44.798, Speaker A: So, as somebody that's rapidly pushing out this tech, but as you say, trying to do it in a very considered way, you mentioned it could be years before we see retail adoption. I mean, by that, do you mean a decade plus?
00:38:44.984 - 00:39:26.798, Speaker B: I wish I could answer, because I would. Time the product in a timely manner. But at the end of the day, I think you cannot compare defi timeline in traditional timeline as well. As we all know, one month in Defi can mean a number of months or even a year in several industries. Right. So I think it definitely depends on the landscape in Defi and see what are the things that we can help push forward. But yeah, I think it's going to be a while, but cannot say at all how many months, how many years from.
00:39:26.964 - 00:40:08.586, Speaker A: Understand? I understand. So maybe to just zoom out, what do you think, as somebody deep in the weeds in Defi, what do you think is missing to enable you to be able to deploy the products that you want to deploy with a level of, say, security that you'd like? Because obviously you can only be as good as the infrastructure that you're building on. And of course, this is still very nascent. So what do you think is missing? What do you think are the low hanging fruit or the kind of critical bits of infrastructure that need to be solved for, for you to be able to fully realize your goals at alpha?
00:40:08.778 - 00:40:57.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there are multiple things, definitely. Number one, I think what we're really missing is a number of firms for economic audit. As you have seen, if you look at the technical audit itself, there are not that many to begin with that deliver very good audit results and very thorough results. And that's already technical audit. Right. And if you look at economic audit, there's pretty much none because it's really difficult for anyone to also read the code and imply the economic attack from it. So if you look from harvest finance attack, which happened last week, the code was working just fine, but the attack came from economic audit.
00:40:57.130 - 00:42:14.070, Speaker B: And I think as Defi grows, capturing more total value locked and real money in there, economic audit will be so important going forward. So if any firm can start doing that, I think that they can bring a lot of value and also capture a lot of value themselves. The second point is also how there can be a number of ways that help bridge multiple blockchains or multiple L2s together. So what I'd like to see later on is pretty much that DeFi protocols don't have to choose which blockchain they have to be in. Because right now what I'm seeing is that a number of protocols, a number of products have to choose if they are choosing composability, hence ethereum or low gas fee, and no composability on other chains. So there are some choices that they have to make. But I think the longer term, what would be really nice is pretty much that anyone can build on any chain that they find fit, depending on their product, and still be able to compose and build off of each other.
00:42:14.070 - 00:42:44.900, Speaker B: And that's pretty much we would see a real cross chain defi ecosystem, but there are no tools or no available infrastructure for us to move towards that phase yet. But I'm pretty sure a lot of people are coming up with different ways to make that happen because it's not that easy. And different blockchains have different pros and cons, so people have to be mindful of.
00:42:45.270 - 00:43:19.130, Speaker A: So of course, Defi is already proven. It's quite easy to bootstrap liquidity into a network. I mean, you mentioned you had several million very quickly within your first product, the kind of problem, and of course that can create quite promiscuous behavior from users. How do you look at kind of closing the loyalty loop to create stickiness around a product in a sector which is incredibly promiscuous.
00:43:19.970 - 00:43:50.098, Speaker B: So if your product provide unique value proposition that users cannot find elsewhere, then they're going to come back. So like Alpha Homora, you can get the highest lending rate on ETH. So that's very clear. And there are a lot of ETH holders out there who don't want to sell to make money from their ETH, so they can supply to Alpha Homora and get interest rate on ETH. And we actually have pretty high retention rate on alpha Homora.
00:43:50.194 - 00:43:54.166, Speaker A: And how do you achieve that, by the way? How do you achieve the highest interest rate?
00:43:54.268 - 00:44:42.838, Speaker B: Yeah, because on the borrow side, the smart contract does one thing, it borrows for you, so you can utfarm. So pretty much it's different from other lending protocol. For other lending protocol, users deposit to get interest rate right as the lender. And from the borrow side they borrow and then they find a way to benefit and profit from that borrowed asset themselves. But for Alpha Homora, the borrowers can actually go leverage on youth farming. What that means is pretty much, let's say if they have 100 eth, they can come in with 100 eth, they can tell the smart contract and pretty much tell from the front end that they want to uth farm with 2.5 times.
00:44:42.838 - 00:45:34.598, Speaker B: So pretty much they are borrowing 150 more ease. So in total, they're ute farming with 250 e and they're paying interest on that borrowed ETH. And as a result, the alpha homora contract will yield farm for them. So the contract will automate a number of functionalities that otherwise users would have to do it themselves on multiple transactions, paying multiple number of gas fees. And at the end of the day, the profit that they get, I mean there are some risks as well, but the profit that they get is high and they are willing to pay for that high borrow interest rate, generating high yields back to the lenders. So we innovate on the borrow side so that there is unique proposition not only on the borrow side, but also on the lending side.
00:45:34.764 - 00:46:05.678, Speaker A: Understood. Okay, great. Well, look, it was a pleasure to have you on, Tasha. I think anybody who launches a startup this year in 2020 and survives deserves an award. And actually, there's a very good argument to say that if you were going to launch alpha, maybe 2020 would be the year to do it with everything that's going on in a wider economy. So congratulations as we edge towards the end of your first year, and it's been a pleasure having you on the show.
00:46:05.764 - 00:46:07.150, Speaker B: Thank you, Jamie.
