00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.250, Speaker A: The younger generations is the kind of generation that don't tend normally to have a lot or a large financial knowledge.
00:00:06.330 - 00:00:12.990, Speaker B: So whatever. We think that, of course, like young people, they don't need to learn about the old financial world because probably eventually it will disappear and they know.
00:00:13.060 - 00:00:24.510, Speaker C: But I think this year on, majority of the folks already own crypto or have done something with crypto or even, you know, wrote smart contract code before they enter the university.
00:00:43.100 - 00:00:59.980, Speaker D: Speaking of onboarding, young people essentially like banking and investment and money in general, is probably the foundation of it all. What are the banking investment options available to younger people right now?
00:01:00.130 - 00:01:23.876, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's great question. So basically, the younger generations is the kind of generation that don't tend normally to have a lot or large financial knowledge. So you got to remove a lot of things from the options that we have about investments because it requires financial knowledge, and financial knowledge also requires risks. So you got to understand risk, you got to understand where you're putting yourself into it.
00:01:23.898 - 00:01:24.420, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:24.570 - 00:02:15.540, Speaker A: So basically what we see between the young people, so I would say my friends between 20 and 35, would be that they move basically to options that do not require any sort of financial knowledge and that basically they can just get tangible income. So something that they can see which is tangible in the short term. So they basically focus on the short term. So what we see commonly, which is sad, is that younger generations tend to just use a lot, for example, basically buying random cryptos because they think they're going to become millionaires. One cool thing about this is that I want to do a talk on Barcelona on a university, and I just basically asked. It wasn't an engineering class, I just asked how many people there have tokens or crypto. It was like more than one third of the class, which was exactly what's super glad to see that.
00:02:15.540 - 00:02:52.512, Speaker A: But obviously they didn't understood, obviously, where they were putting the money on. And another one that they do a lot is doing gambling or lottery, because it does not require to have any sort of financial knowledge. And you can do or you can have the chance of winning a lot. Right. And the other option that we have since the long was savings accounts. But younger generations do not use the savings account. Basically, if you see a little bit of numbers, you see that 32% of the population in Europe is younger than 30, but just 2% of the savings account are actually owned by people younger than 30.
00:02:52.512 - 00:03:13.224, Speaker A: So they're actually not something that they are looking for, for the main reason that the rates that they can produce on yield or interest are very low. Basically their deposits are low too. So it requires a super extend period of time to produce any sort of yield or basically profit that is tangible for them.
00:03:13.262 - 00:03:13.704, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:13.822 - 00:03:26.840, Speaker A: And when it comes a very extended period of time, what happens is that basically the opportunity cost for you to lock in the money is actually higher than the actually actual profit that you are producing.
00:03:26.920 - 00:03:27.308, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:27.394 - 00:03:42.000, Speaker A: So for them it doesn't make sense. So they end up trying more risky things that at the end of the day can just basically give higher profits on that, I would say. But basically that would be the ones that are more suited.
00:03:44.180 - 00:04:10.968, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks. That makes a lot of sense. The only reason why I have a bank account is because my parents kept telling me, don't keep all your money in your current account that's linked to a bank card. You want your money some way when, if your car gets stolen, nobody can touch your money. So that's pretty much the only reason why I started getting like, I got my investment account, I got my savings account when I was 18. Right. But most people don't really have that.
00:04:10.968 - 00:04:19.340, Speaker D: I guess they don't really have that knowledge always. And the parents are not always navigating them or they're also not always listening to their parents.
00:04:21.120 - 00:04:56.330, Speaker A: I would say that one. Another important thing is that they don't want to get that knowledge, which is that the important thing we have to realize that people don't want to learn things that they don't have interest on. Right. It's the same way that you cannot, from my point of view, the education system trying to educate people in the same way doesn't make sense because education is something very personal. And you can just try to force people to learn the same things. And people have many problems during the day, many things they have to worry about, they don't want to understand, which is the fundamentals of theoreticals, analysis of stocks or crypto sometimes.
00:04:56.780 - 00:05:33.760, Speaker B: Anyway, you'd get surprised how many people, like all the people they are coming to me, coming from the financial, traditional financial world, that they want to understand tokenization and a lot of stuff. But basically what they say all of the time is like, okay, my world probably will last for ten years more, but no more than that. So whatever we think, of course, like young people, they don't need to learn about the old financial world, because probably eventually it will disappear. And they know. And the funny thing is, as Paul said, we did this research and a lot of the young people, they thought of money as something like short term, next week spending. That was money. But when it comes to savings.
00:05:33.760 - 00:06:08.670, Speaker B: What came to their minds always was digital goods, like maybe an iPhone on League of Legends, probably not even blockchain, just things in game purchases, all these kind of things. Somebody once told me like, yeah, because eventually I will have to travel to Mars because I will have to go to live to Mars and I cannot bring money, but I can bring my NFTs there. So that was a little bit. I don't need a car, that's not an investment. I don't need a house, that's not an investment, but an NFT, I can bring it anywhere. So, yeah, I think it's completely changing the way people think about savings, about money. And that's good, by the way.
00:06:09.680 - 00:06:43.660, Speaker A: Yeah. For example, I buy from it, I got a couple of friends that when I ask them how much money you have, they're going to tell me I got $40 or I got $500 on the bank, but then I have 1000 in the skins of League of Legend. And they think that they network, they sum the network and if they need money, what they're going to do is they're going to take the skins of League of Legends and they're going to sell it on steam, for example. Right. And then they would basically take that money, but it's something that basically, as you can see, they see new ways of reserve value. Older generations can see.
00:06:43.810 - 00:07:31.704, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. That's the thing. And that's why digital goods have been so popular. It's not about being in this super dystopian world of everybody lives with a headset VR on them. Some people actually want to explore space, people want to explore different planets, people want to explore, even when you travel, exploring different countries, it's not about being dystopian, it's about merging your virtual world and your physical world so you can actually keep being friends with people where you no longer live in the same place. And I guess it's very similar about cash, right? You want to be able to take all your assets with you wherever you are in the world or whatever planet you're on. So that makes a lot of sense.
00:07:31.704 - 00:07:49.570, Speaker D: But that also poses some questions around infrastructure like, Betty, I know you've built one of the superb protocols in that, like how can we as Defi builders and investors actually enable the young people to join us?
00:07:51.460 - 00:09:30.736, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a very animated discussion there between Paul and Alex. I think they are right to the point where I think web three and blockchain has brought structural changes, not just technological but structural changes to our society. Because. About removing agencies, right. Because web two is all about concentrated resources, power, information into a field of those agencies, right? You have to acquire all of those in order to kind of win the game in the web two world, whereas web three is basically broke the mold where you don't need to be the biggest, the best, and then have it all agency, whether it's those companies or I guess, banking institutions or whatever, those power can be back to whether it's individuals or protocols, and as long as you can actually offer something valuable to whoever is using you. So because of that nature, then I think the barrier of entering into the field has significantly lowered in web three. And then another thing that I think we are bringing to the field is a mixture of play, work as well as earn, and also, I guess, life having fun.
00:09:30.736 - 00:10:30.836, Speaker C: Because when you are collecting digital goods, I think part of it is also fun, right? Because that's also where your friends are at. But at the same time, it also brings you potential returns on investment. But at the same time, the boundary is very blurred in sort of the new world that we are creating. So I think as builders and investors, it's very important that remember why we are even here, right? Because I think blockchain is a field that's very extreme. There's a lot of people comes into the field because of the hype, because of new technology, you could actually fall into the hype extreme, but there are also a lot of people here for the long term and building. So I keep remembering why we are even here. We are here to actually remove those agencies so that we can keep the barrier as low as possible.
00:10:30.836 - 00:12:54.890, Speaker C: This is true for builders who's building infrastructures, platforms. It is also true, I think, for investors who's looking at projects to invest, because when we first started three or four years ago with Akala, we were just like a few people, right? We don't have fancy background. Same for the young people. Like Paul pointed out very correctly, the education system. Why do you have to go to a fancy school to be able to allow to do certain things? And why do you have to have certain identity to be allowed to open a bank account, to have a certain type of investment? Why do you have to be judged, right? I think in the web three world it is trust but verify, right? So you can enter the field without permission, but once you are in the field, you are judged by what you can do with all the facilities you have. If you are coder, then you can write code and you can build stuff. Or if you are a user who are willing to learn, you could collect goods do trades and then learn all the various different things and innovate together build community so I think these are the things that the mindset for the builders in the web three and also investors are very important to have and as for the stuff that we do practically would be we working very closely in universities and one thing we noticed is two years ago well for example working with folks from Berkeley a lot two years ago I think only one third of the folks come through those programs actually know crypto or own crypto they're in the class but I think this year on majority of the folks already own crypto or have done something with crypto or know wrote smart contract code before they enter the university so you will see a lot of folks come through the industry they are already crypto native not only like Internet native I think we have to work with the younger generation to be able to build stuff and empower the generation yeah so that's my take thank.
