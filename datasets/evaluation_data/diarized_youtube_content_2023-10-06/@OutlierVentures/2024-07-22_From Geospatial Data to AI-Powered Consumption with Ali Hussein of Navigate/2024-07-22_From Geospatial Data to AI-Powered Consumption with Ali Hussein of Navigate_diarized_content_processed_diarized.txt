00:00:00.480 - 00:00:27.441, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Metaverse podcast. It is my huge pleasure today to welcome Ali Hussain, who is CEO and co founder of Navigate. For those of you who've been in Blockchain for a long time, like me, or perhaps you're new to this space, you may still share this same emotion and opinion, which is that we who create our data should own our own data.
00:00:27.513 - 00:00:27.685, Speaker B: It.
00:00:27.715 - 00:00:29.417, Speaker C: It was one of the first philosophies.
00:00:29.561 - 00:01:34.501, Speaker A: That I kind of connected with when I first got involved in Blockchain. If you're using Facebook, for example, and you post a picture of your dog or you write this wonderful story and you decided to share it on Reddit, what happens? Well, certainly you're not getting compensated for that, are you? That's your dog and that's your picture, and that's your intellectual thoughts and ideas. Rather, these data platforms get your data. Not only do you not get compensated for it, but it's not yours to own. Navigate wants to change that. And I know that so many other companies over the years in this space have tried, but I think, and you'll hear what they're doing is very, very unique in terms of passive data collection, active data collection, through a really cool gaming solution that they have, and as well as their origin, their DNA rooted within artificial intelligence. First in a company called Spark Cognition, which is an industrial AI company based in Austin, Texas, which has done some really pioneering work in cognitive AI.
00:01:34.501 - 00:02:27.031, Speaker A: And through their journey in Skygrid, which was a joint venture between Boeing and Spark Cognition. All of this has informed Navigate's journey into becoming a decentralized intelligence platform. And I cannot tell you how exciting it is to have Ali with us today. Full disclosure, I was an investor in Spark Cognition and an advisor to Navigate, and I've seen Ali's journey along the years. But as you'll hear as he talks through, exactly why Navigate was created, the importance of both passive and active data collection in creating an intelligence platform, and the overall cool community that they are building. Amongst the navigators who are contributing to Navigate, you're just going to be as inspired as I am, I'm sure, when we hear this story. So thank you so much for listening in.
00:02:27.031 - 00:03:01.505, Speaker A: But before we get started, I know you're going to want to do this right, which is subscribe if you've enjoyed our podcasts, if you like hearing Jamie Burke, if you like listening to me every now and then, please feel free to subscribe. Your support makes a huge, huge, huge difference. It enables us to continue bringing content your way and really Makes us super jazzed to keep on bringing fantastic interviews to you. So with that, let's get started talking to Ali and learning about Navigate.
00:03:12.565 - 00:03:18.861, Speaker C: Ali, it is wonderful to see you, to have you here on the Metaverse podcast. Welcome.
00:03:19.013 - 00:03:19.869, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:03:19.917 - 00:03:21.269, Speaker D: Rumi. Great to be here.
00:03:21.357 - 00:03:30.277, Speaker C: I have to tell our listeners, our viewers, just a little bit about Ali. We've known each other for how long now? How long has it been?
00:03:30.381 - 00:03:31.141, Speaker D: 2016 onward?
00:03:31.221 - 00:03:31.541, Speaker B: 2016.
00:03:31.621 - 00:03:35.143, Speaker C: I thought you were going to say 20 years.
00:03:35.223 - 00:03:37.544, Speaker B: I'm like, we're not that old.
00:03:37.624 - 00:03:57.305, Speaker C: No. Yeah, 2016. I had the remarkable pleasure of being an investor in a company that you worked at called Spark Cognition. And it's been wonderful, just wonderful to see you develop over these years to now where you're now in the position of being the CEO and co founder of Navigate. So just congratulations on that journey.
00:03:57.425 - 00:03:58.425, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
00:03:58.505 - 00:03:59.761, Speaker D: It's been fantastic.
00:03:59.833 - 00:04:07.929, Speaker B: I mean, from Spark Cognition, and then you've been following along all the way from Spark to Skygrid to now Navigate.
00:04:07.977 - 00:04:08.705, Speaker D: It's been wonderful.
00:04:08.785 - 00:04:16.740, Speaker C: Let's walk through that for everyone. Am I starting with Spark Cognition? Because that has an important part to play in the Navigate story?
00:04:16.872 - 00:04:18.324, Speaker D: Absolutely, absolutely.
00:04:18.404 - 00:04:22.364, Speaker B: So I moved back to Austin from.
00:04:22.404 - 00:04:25.556, Speaker D: Seattle in 2015 to join Spark Cognition.
00:04:25.660 - 00:04:29.084, Speaker B: Which is an AI, industrial AI company.
00:04:29.244 - 00:04:30.860, Speaker D: Based in Austin, Texas.
00:04:31.012 - 00:04:32.660, Speaker B: The time that I moved back, I.
00:04:32.692 - 00:04:34.380, Speaker D: Think there were about nine or ten.
00:04:34.412 - 00:04:44.515, Speaker B: Or so people at the company. So very, very early days, we were looking at essentially cybersecurity using AI and.
00:04:44.595 - 00:04:50.579, Speaker D: Predictive and preventative maintenance for industrial equipment. Using AI for industrial equipment.
00:04:50.627 - 00:04:54.067, Speaker C: We're talking about, like, large turbines and things like that.
00:04:54.251 - 00:05:01.651, Speaker B: Yes, large turbines, generators, you know, things like that. So a lot of our customers were.
00:05:01.803 - 00:05:05.227, Speaker D: Big Fortune 500, Fortune 100 companies, energy.
00:05:05.331 - 00:05:09.005, Speaker B: Companies, utility companies, so on and so forth.
00:05:09.115 - 00:05:28.425, Speaker C: And I'd also like to emphasize, if I selfishly can, that when you say AI, you truly mean it. It's not like the AI that everyone's kind of throwing around these days, professing to be an expert. But you and the team at Spark Cognition truly have a lot of practical experience in artificial intelligence going back years.
00:05:28.585 - 00:05:48.829, Speaker B: Yes, I'd like to think so. And one of the first things that I worked at when I was at Spark Cognition was our natural language processing platform, which was called DeepNLP. I built the first version of that. So seeing how natural language has evolved and now the, you know, the current.
00:05:48.917 - 00:05:50.821, Speaker D: State with LLMs, which are really the.
00:05:50.853 - 00:05:55.245, Speaker B: Next iteration of NLP systems, it's very.
00:05:55.405 - 00:05:58.213, Speaker D: Exciting and gratifying to have seen that.
00:05:58.269 - 00:06:00.085, Speaker B: Progress over the last, you know, eight.
00:06:00.165 - 00:06:01.101, Speaker D: Nine years or so.
00:06:01.173 - 00:06:12.163, Speaker C: So then with your work at Spark Cognition and Deep nlp, you've continued right to adventure forward into a firm called SkyGrid. You mentioned Sky Grid.
00:06:12.299 - 00:06:12.731, Speaker D: Yes.
00:06:12.803 - 00:06:21.259, Speaker B: So basically around the time that I moved back to Austin is also the time that I got into crypto and, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff.
00:06:21.307 - 00:06:24.135, Speaker D: Like order some litecoin miners from China.
00:06:24.555 - 00:06:37.227, Speaker B: Ran them at our place. Until my wife, you know, told me that with my noise and the miners, it was getting too much for her, so I had to get rid of the miners. But the cool thing about my work.
00:06:37.251 - 00:06:38.955, Speaker D: At Spark Cognition was that I really.
00:06:38.995 - 00:06:43.103, Speaker B: Got to work on all of the new technologies that were, were popular at.
00:06:43.119 - 00:06:44.431, Speaker D: The time and that were emerging.
00:06:44.503 - 00:06:57.895, Speaker B: So virtual reality, augmented reality, and a lot of our, you know, NLP solutions even, for example, were the interface for them was through VR headsets.
00:06:57.975 - 00:06:59.655, Speaker D: And then later, if you recall, when.
00:06:59.695 - 00:07:02.527, Speaker B: Microsoft released the Hololens, we built a.
00:07:02.551 - 00:07:06.319, Speaker D: Custom version for Deep NLP to run on the HoloLens for folks who would.
00:07:06.367 - 00:07:15.555, Speaker B: Be able to, you know, walk up to a generator, have the Hololens on their head and see AR pieces of the generator come up and ask questions.
00:07:15.595 - 00:07:16.611, Speaker D: And so on and so forth.
00:07:16.643 - 00:07:22.323, Speaker B: So for debugging. So blockchain was one of the things that I got to, you know, bring.
00:07:22.379 - 00:07:23.627, Speaker D: To work with me.
00:07:23.731 - 00:07:35.395, Speaker B: And the Boeing company became an investor in Spark Cognition during our Series B, if I recall correctly. And one of the things that we were working on at Spark Cognition was.
00:07:35.555 - 00:07:38.675, Speaker D: Utilizing drones that we were building internally.
00:07:38.755 - 00:07:49.207, Speaker B: Like cheap drones that could basically fly around and do collect video and images for things, things like wind turbines, just from an inspection perspective.
00:07:49.271 - 00:07:49.543, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:49.599 - 00:07:52.343, Speaker B: Making it cheaper and then combining that.
00:07:52.399 - 00:07:54.031, Speaker D: Getting that data and then running it.
00:07:54.063 - 00:07:58.455, Speaker B: Through our ML models and, you know, kind of trying to do prediction based.
00:07:58.495 - 00:08:00.447, Speaker D: Off of, you know, what was detected.
00:08:00.551 - 00:08:11.719, Speaker B: So Boeing was obviously following along with this stuff. And I was part of the team that was writing software to control these drones and, you know, have them perform.
00:08:11.807 - 00:08:13.911, Speaker D: Different tasks and so on and so forth.
00:08:13.983 - 00:08:17.947, Speaker B: And they said, you know, we really like this concept because we were basically.
00:08:18.011 - 00:08:21.923, Speaker D: Building this operating system for drones that could command and control them.
00:08:21.979 - 00:08:25.363, Speaker C: Okay, so kind of like a air traffic controlled.
00:08:25.499 - 00:08:30.131, Speaker B: Yes. And so that's what they saw. And they were like, you know, if you kind of take the hardware piece.
00:08:30.163 - 00:08:31.907, Speaker D: Out of it, let's take the software.
00:08:31.971 - 00:08:35.275, Speaker B: Piece and start a separate joint venture.
00:08:35.355 - 00:08:38.995, Speaker C: And that Sky Grid, the joint venture for Spark Cognition.
00:08:39.155 - 00:08:44.030, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. We started a 5050 joint venture called.
00:08:44.144 - 00:08:52.655, Speaker D: SkyGrid with Boeing and Spark Cogn. I was part of the founding team there, the chief software architect and later the chief product officer.
00:08:52.815 - 00:09:10.183, Speaker B: And we started collaborating with the FAA with Boeing's other subsidiary, wisk, which is the one that's building these vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. So, yeah, so skygrid basically became this.
00:09:10.279 - 00:09:12.847, Speaker D: Aerial operating system for drones and how.
00:09:12.871 - 00:09:22.063, Speaker B: To integrate them into the national airspace. So that was my kind of work over the last four years or so when I was at Spark, because I.
00:09:22.079 - 00:09:24.175, Speaker D: Was serving mostly on the skygrid side.
00:09:24.255 - 00:09:32.303, Speaker C: That is super cool. I have to tell you. I once went to a conference a few years ago, the auvsi.
00:09:32.399 - 00:09:36.735, Speaker B: Yes, it's auvsi, there's no nicer way to say it.
00:09:36.895 - 00:09:58.345, Speaker C: The association for Uncrewed or Unmanned Vehicle Systems. And I have to tell you, I saw a Sky Grid drone at that conference at that convention center. It was so cool to see a company like Boeing partner with a cognitive AI company like Spark Cognition and enter this field.
00:09:58.465 - 00:10:00.945, Speaker D: It was a lot of fun. We did a lot of cool things there.
00:10:00.985 - 00:10:03.137, Speaker B: One of my favorite memories was we.
00:10:03.161 - 00:10:04.425, Speaker D: Went to one of the biggest air.
00:10:04.465 - 00:10:22.587, Speaker B: Shows is in Farnborough every year right outside London. And so in, I think this was 2019, we went there and I gave a talk on AI and blockchain in aviation. And it's really like incredible how applicable.
00:10:22.651 - 00:10:28.667, Speaker D: Both these technologies are in something like aviation from an auditability perspective, from an.
00:10:28.691 - 00:10:35.651, Speaker B: Immutability perspective, just record keeping, safety. Because, you know, aviation, in aviation, you.
00:10:35.683 - 00:10:39.779, Speaker D: Have to be quite obsessed with safety. And so it was very well received.
00:10:39.867 - 00:10:44.023, Speaker B: It's lovely now that I've moved on from skygrid to see how that company.
00:10:44.079 - 00:10:50.879, Speaker D: Has grown very, very substantially. I think they're approaching with 200 people at Skygrid. So it's just, it's wonderful to look.
00:10:50.927 - 00:10:53.431, Speaker B: Back and remember how it all started.
00:10:53.543 - 00:11:17.785, Speaker C: Absolutely. So let's make that connection. You've mentioned your interest in Blockchain personally. You mentioned blockchain and its interaction in technologies and within skygrid. So let's thread this on to Navigate. How was navigate born out of all of this? How does AI drones and blockchain all kind of come together with the formation of navigate and your vision going forward?
00:11:18.125 - 00:11:18.949, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:11:19.037 - 00:11:27.397, Speaker B: So navigate started within skygrid. And one of the things that we made available during our time at skygrid.
00:11:27.421 - 00:11:29.421, Speaker D: Was this application that would let you.
00:11:29.493 - 00:11:38.597, Speaker B: Control your DJI drones and parrot drones and so on and so forth and basically define missions within an app, an.
00:11:38.621 - 00:11:40.685, Speaker D: Iphone app, and later an Android app.
00:11:40.765 - 00:11:46.769, Speaker B: Where you could, you know, give instructions like, this is the path that I want you to fly, but when you.
00:11:46.817 - 00:11:51.681, Speaker D: Reach from waypoint A to waypoint B, I want you to stop there, do.
00:11:51.713 - 00:12:06.625, Speaker B: A360, record everything around you, move up, move down, you know, all, all of those things from like an inspection perspective, so on and so forth, then move to the next waypoint to take a bunch of pictures. And so if I recall correctly, we'd.
00:12:06.665 - 00:12:08.689, Speaker D: Hit about 100,000 downloads.
00:12:08.817 - 00:12:11.113, Speaker B: And this is now during, you know.
00:12:11.169 - 00:12:16.297, Speaker D: The post Covid world. And one of the things that we wanted to do, I always wanted to.
00:12:16.321 - 00:12:20.145, Speaker B: Do this there was tokenize a lot.
00:12:20.185 - 00:12:22.401, Speaker D: Of what skygrid was doing, because you.
00:12:22.433 - 00:12:25.249, Speaker B: Have to remember that this was all built on blockchain.
00:12:25.417 - 00:12:27.665, Speaker D: Every single drone that was flying when.
00:12:27.705 - 00:12:36.177, Speaker B: You made this mission was sending heartbeats to the blockchain about its mission, so on and so forth. So we had a custom for those.
00:12:36.241 - 00:12:40.025, Speaker C: Who may not have caught that. Skygrid was built on a blockchain.
00:12:40.185 - 00:12:48.149, Speaker B: Yes, we had a permissioned blockchain. And the idea was to kind of scale that out and have different entities.
00:12:48.237 - 00:12:50.165, Speaker D: Run nodes later, because this would be.
00:12:50.205 - 00:12:52.509, Speaker B: Something that, for example, Boeing could later.
00:12:52.557 - 00:12:54.181, Speaker D: Run a node, the FAA could run.
00:12:54.213 - 00:13:04.349, Speaker B: A node, so on and so forth. And by the way, this was happening at the same time that IASA had written a paper on the use of.
00:13:04.397 - 00:13:06.549, Speaker D: Blockchain and tokens in aviation.
00:13:06.597 - 00:13:14.693, Speaker B: It's very cool that one of the use cases that they talked about was potentially taking the point system for all the airlines, making it a common point.
00:13:14.749 - 00:13:16.073, Speaker D: System and putting it on ch.
00:13:16.149 - 00:13:50.447, Speaker C: I think the skygrid use case of blockchain makes a lot of sense that likes incredibly scalable sense. If I mentioned earlier, there is no air traffic controller for drones, and you think of how many. Not just companies that utilize drone fleets, but individuals and hobbyists putting drones up in the sky in terms of managing them, collecting the data, utilizing that data, it makes a lot of sense that you would want to put that on a shared network and where users are also incentivized to participate in that network for sure.
00:13:50.511 - 00:13:54.303, Speaker D: And the biggest thing for that was from a safety perspective, because right now.
00:13:54.319 - 00:14:02.879, Speaker B: If you and I fly a drone outside of any of this, the FAA has no information about that. And from an air traffic and air.
00:14:02.927 - 00:14:05.047, Speaker D: Safety perspective, there have been many, many.
00:14:05.111 - 00:14:17.179, Speaker B: Incidents with drones flying too close to airports and this, that and the other, which have caused a lot of problems for air traffic control. So that was one of the big motivations. So we said, look, you know, with.
00:14:17.227 - 00:14:19.171, Speaker D: Drones, 100,000 users or.
00:14:19.203 - 00:14:30.771, Speaker B: So what's a cool way to go about doing this? And one way that the first use case that we saw was making an updated and high definition map of the.
00:14:30.803 - 00:14:34.203, Speaker D: World, because even the lowest low orbit.
00:14:34.259 - 00:14:57.293, Speaker B: Satellite has, you know, orders of magnitude worse image quality than a drone would have. Because, for example, here in the United States, you can't fly a drone above 400ft. So with the multiple megapixel cameras that they now have flying between 200 and 400ft, you get incredible imagery.
00:14:57.429 - 00:15:06.061, Speaker C: So if you're saying the imagery that you would be able to produce would be better than what we would have on Google Maps, for example, for sure.
00:15:06.133 - 00:15:11.349, Speaker B: And we collected thousands of kilometers of data for all of this stuff from.
00:15:11.397 - 00:15:12.929, Speaker D: Drones as well, well as later dash.
00:15:12.977 - 00:15:21.289, Speaker B: Cams in the 2022, 2023 time period. So this was the concept. The Skygrid board was very excited.
00:15:21.377 - 00:15:22.849, Speaker D: We were all very supportive.
00:15:22.897 - 00:15:25.321, Speaker B: And this is when we started raising.
00:15:25.473 - 00:15:29.401, Speaker D: Money for this concept. That's what became the Navigate Seed round.
00:15:29.513 - 00:15:35.497, Speaker B: Bunch of things happened, which I won't go into, but let's just, you know, say one word. Lawyers.
00:15:35.641 - 00:15:41.025, Speaker C: Lawyers, yes, in the first word my mind, yeah, lawyers happened.
00:15:41.145 - 00:15:42.521, Speaker B: Lawyers happened.
00:15:42.673 - 00:15:44.441, Speaker D: And the decision was made to kind.
00:15:44.473 - 00:15:46.457, Speaker B: Of take, you know, this concept out.
00:15:46.481 - 00:15:48.033, Speaker D: Of skygrid so that there would be.
00:15:48.049 - 00:15:51.937, Speaker B: No Boeing involvement and make it, you know, its own separate entity.
00:15:52.041 - 00:15:57.745, Speaker C: I should say no Boeing involvement in terms of direct ownership. But obviously the influence, the DNA.
00:15:57.905 - 00:16:04.889, Speaker B: Of course. Of course, like I said, first thing I said, yes, was incubated within skygrid. Right.
00:16:04.977 - 00:16:06.265, Speaker D: It came from that.
00:16:06.345 - 00:16:17.345, Speaker B: And so that's when we created this Navigate entity. And then seed round was 7.6 million. Outlier participated in that.
00:16:17.425 - 00:16:20.937, Speaker D: We had participation from Distributed Global, Alan.
00:16:21.001 - 00:16:29.401, Speaker B: Howard, Kraken Ventures and a few others. And then we started building this out. So when the round closed, that's when.
00:16:29.513 - 00:16:31.321, Speaker D: The 2022 bear hit.
00:16:31.433 - 00:16:35.631, Speaker B: And what we built out was essentially.
00:16:35.703 - 00:16:46.527, Speaker D: An ecosystem where you could go in. And since there was no explicit dependency on drones anymore, one of the first things that we did was we expanded the datasets that we were collecting.
00:16:46.671 - 00:16:52.151, Speaker B: And so we made it drones and dash cams to build this high fidelity.
00:16:52.223 - 00:16:54.799, Speaker D: Map to build a geospatial dataset.
00:16:54.887 - 00:16:57.383, Speaker B: Because then after this shift, one of.
00:16:57.399 - 00:16:58.927, Speaker D: The things that we did which was.
00:16:59.031 - 00:17:08.737, Speaker B: Kind of critical to understand is we wanted to broaden the scope of navigate and we wanted to make it a larger kind of data ecosystem.
00:17:08.921 - 00:17:14.649, Speaker D: And so geospatial data was one part of that. And that's where we started out.
00:17:14.777 - 00:17:24.681, Speaker B: We built a marketplace that allowed folks to redeem the tokens that they earned for gift cards or hold on to the token.
00:17:24.753 - 00:17:28.609, Speaker C: And how many people were engaged in the platform at this point?
00:17:28.697 - 00:17:37.633, Speaker B: At this point, there were. We had engagement in I think over about 30, 40 countries globally. Yeah.
00:17:37.769 - 00:17:49.393, Speaker D: And the community was small because we didn't really advertise this or push this too much. But I think in terms of users that were on the system, there were between 1,000 or 2,000 contributors, active contributors.
00:17:49.449 - 00:17:59.033, Speaker B: Who were, you know, sending us this data. So from Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, in Europe, England, et cetera, and then a.
00:17:59.049 - 00:18:03.665, Speaker D: Bunch of folks in the US in Canada. So there was very good coverage that way.
00:18:03.735 - 00:18:36.673, Speaker C: Okay, so you had already built quite a sizable and international community last focusing on drone and geospatial or dash cam data for geospatial analysis. Kind of fast forward a little bit to the NAVIGATE of today because it seems like in very short order you are now referring to yourselves as the world's largest decentralized intelligence platform. Do I have that correct? So it's more than. Just like you said, you had ambitions beyond drones. It seems like you have ambitions beyond just geospatial.
00:18:36.849 - 00:18:50.273, Speaker B: Yes, and that's a fantastic question. Basically a lot has happened in 2023, right? LLMs became a thing. And as I mentioned early on, it's very, very satisfying to see how, you.
00:18:50.289 - 00:18:52.209, Speaker D: Know, AI has progressed over the last.
00:18:52.257 - 00:18:54.513, Speaker B: Nine years or so with LLMs, it's.
00:18:54.649 - 00:19:00.353, Speaker D: We'Ve finally broken through to the consumer, directly to the consumer, and kind of.
00:19:00.369 - 00:19:02.425, Speaker B: You know, it's not that B2B anymore.
00:19:02.465 - 00:19:04.965, Speaker D: And it's very easy to explain to people.
00:19:05.925 - 00:19:06.773, Speaker B: Can do.
00:19:06.909 - 00:19:08.653, Speaker D: Because now you can say, hey, you.
00:19:08.669 - 00:19:11.061, Speaker B: Know, look at ChatGPT, look at Claude.
00:19:11.213 - 00:19:14.765, Speaker D: You know how they run, They've just ingested the whole Internet.
00:19:14.925 - 00:19:21.501, Speaker B: And you have this seemingly, you know, super intelligent, you know, know it all.
00:19:21.533 - 00:19:23.265, Speaker D: That you can talk to all the time.
00:19:23.565 - 00:19:32.853, Speaker B: So that's become a lot easier to explain because of this example. And so what navigate's mission is essentially.
00:19:32.949 - 00:19:39.777, Speaker D: Empower end users, consumers, traditional consumers, to become contributors of data.
00:19:39.881 - 00:19:44.001, Speaker B: And I'll give you three very specific examples.
00:19:44.153 - 00:19:46.297, Speaker D: You look at the largest platforms out.
00:19:46.321 - 00:19:51.089, Speaker B: There today, Twitter Now X, Reddit and Facebook.
00:19:51.217 - 00:20:04.377, Speaker D: They're fantastic communities, but all of their value is generated by the users that are on those platforms. I mean, we get breaking news on X now and it comes from citizen.
00:20:04.441 - 00:20:08.301, Speaker B: Journalists, it comes from the average folks.
00:20:08.493 - 00:20:23.357, Speaker D: Same with Reddit. You have real time information coming in. And so there's a lot of this data that we generate and we contribute for Free. And we don't get anything from it. Traditionally, we haven't gotten anything from it.
00:20:23.501 - 00:20:25.981, Speaker B: So it's just become the norm and.
00:20:26.013 - 00:20:31.735, Speaker D: We'Re used to it now. And that's what Navigate wants to break.
00:20:31.885 - 00:20:34.747, Speaker B: We want to break this habit that.
00:20:34.771 - 00:20:38.835, Speaker D: We'Re in of constantly generating data, giving.
00:20:38.875 - 00:20:46.595, Speaker B: It away for free, and allowing large corporations to earn from it while we don't get to share a piece of that pie.
00:20:46.675 - 00:21:24.723, Speaker C: So can I challenge you, though? I'll say this. I agree with what you just stated. I think many of us have agreed, though, for years over that. If you post a picture of your ramen noodles on Facebook and you get 50 likes for it, you're not seeing anything of that. Maybe, maybe the restaurant that you ordered it from isn't seeing anything from that. The only company that gets any true value from that is Facebook, and it owns what you've just contributed. We've all hated that, or at least many of us in this blockchain space have never liked that idea that we are basically giving our intellectual property, the content that we're creating, to these centralized parties for free.
00:21:24.723 - 00:21:32.335, Speaker C: Let's change that model. We've been saying this for years. Why is Navigate going to be the one to break that habit? How are you guys going to do it?
00:21:32.455 - 00:21:36.055, Speaker B: So the way that we're going to do it is we've kind of broken.
00:21:36.095 - 00:21:37.559, Speaker D: This into two buckets.
00:21:37.687 - 00:21:42.735, Speaker B: There's the contribution of resources and the contribution of time.
00:21:42.855 - 00:21:44.735, Speaker D: Those are the two things that have value.
00:21:44.855 - 00:21:52.687, Speaker B: You can look at these Instagram influencers. They put in a ton of resources and a ton of times to build up their followings.
00:21:52.751 - 00:22:04.779, Speaker D: They focus on a niche and then they use advertisers and they monetize that. So it works for all of these influencers on an individual basis, what Navigate wants to do. And by the way, the issue there.
00:22:04.827 - 00:22:10.595, Speaker B: Is that very few people comparatively, are willing to put in that time and.
00:22:10.635 - 00:22:15.747, Speaker D: Effort because it takes a lot of time to build up an Instagram following, for example, so on and so forth.
00:22:15.891 - 00:22:20.651, Speaker B: So, number one, and this is something that we learned while we were collecting.
00:22:20.683 - 00:22:22.859, Speaker D: The geospatial data set, this was a.
00:22:22.907 - 00:22:27.059, Speaker B: Fantastic learning for us. It's an effort, like going out, flying.
00:22:27.107 - 00:22:29.203, Speaker D: A drone, taking all those pictures, coming.
00:22:29.259 - 00:22:31.555, Speaker B: Back down, taking out your SD card.
00:22:31.595 - 00:22:33.547, Speaker D: And uploading all of that information, that.
00:22:33.571 - 00:22:34.763, Speaker B: Takes time and effort.
00:22:34.899 - 00:22:43.135, Speaker D: So we wanted to divide this into active data contribution and augmentation and passive data contribution.
00:22:43.555 - 00:22:50.815, Speaker B: The passive piece is exactly as it sounds. We want to be able to use.
00:22:51.115 - 00:22:53.835, Speaker D: Your resource, your computer.
00:22:53.995 - 00:22:57.107, Speaker B: We've built an extension that will be launching here soon.
00:22:57.171 - 00:23:00.507, Speaker D: A browser extension that will allow you.
00:23:00.651 - 00:23:07.231, Speaker B: To contribute from the open Internet, so places like Reddit and Google News and.
00:23:07.263 - 00:23:10.607, Speaker D: Stuff like that, as well as from the closed Internet.
00:23:10.711 - 00:23:12.367, Speaker B: And this is not something that we've.
00:23:12.391 - 00:23:13.871, Speaker D: Ever seen anyone do before.
00:23:13.943 - 00:23:25.823, Speaker B: I'll give you a couple of examples. You have an Amazon account, I have an Amazon account. We have 7, 10, 12 years of history on that Amazon account of all.
00:23:25.839 - 00:23:27.607, Speaker D: Of the things that we've purchased and.
00:23:27.631 - 00:23:28.735, Speaker B: So on and so forth.
00:23:28.855 - 00:23:45.689, Speaker D: That's amazing consumer insight data that only Amazon has and only Amazon can monetize. But by law, you are entitled to get all of your information and I'm entitled to get all of mine. And so the idea is Navigate isn't.
00:23:45.737 - 00:23:53.521, Speaker B: Trying to put the burden on any one user. It's like passively. If you're connected to Amazon, we'll anonymize.
00:23:53.593 - 00:24:21.839, Speaker D: All of your personal information. But you are able to now share all of these items that you've bought over the last 10 years with your personal information removed. And you are now powering this massive community dataset of hundreds of thousands, millions of items that have been purchased over thousands of years. When you put people together, that's incredible. That's not something that we have to.
00:24:21.887 - 00:24:24.167, Speaker B: Start from scratch because the data is.
00:24:24.191 - 00:24:31.695, Speaker D: Already there, but it's just been behind these corporate firewalls and no one has bothered to liberate that data.
00:24:31.815 - 00:24:45.743, Speaker C: That's interesting. Can I underscore that? Make sure I fully understand. So with an extension, an extension that you plan to launch, this data will passively be collected or contributed to the Navigate platform. Anonymized.
00:24:45.919 - 00:24:59.835, Speaker B: Yes. And this is something that I really want to underscore. We want to make this as transparent as possible because that's something that we truly believe in. So how exactly this will work?
00:24:59.995 - 00:25:03.611, Speaker D: What traffic is being transmitted over your network?
00:25:03.803 - 00:25:10.051, Speaker B: Is anyone trying to pull a fast one on you and get data that you don't know about? None of that is going to happen.
00:25:10.163 - 00:25:11.571, Speaker D: The way that it works is that.
00:25:11.603 - 00:25:16.055, Speaker B: This browser extension will first download all of your data locally.
00:25:16.635 - 00:25:18.515, Speaker D: You will have a one time setup.
00:25:18.555 - 00:25:35.391, Speaker B: When you can say, hey, I'm comfortable sharing all of these categories, but I don't want to share any of the clothes that I bought, for example, random example. So you can just uncheck that box and once you set it up, then it'll start working automatically.
00:25:35.543 - 00:25:41.727, Speaker D: But that's the way that it works. All of your data comes to your machine first. You're able to verify what it looks.
00:25:41.751 - 00:26:01.485, Speaker B: Like, and then anonymized, it's sent over the wire and you start contributing to this community powered data set. Just fast forward a little bit. Other than Amazon, I mean, we would be the only ones to have this data. And as you and I both know, Amazon makes a ton of money on this.
00:26:01.605 - 00:26:09.637, Speaker C: Right. Why shouldn't the people who are actually great contributing that user data makes a lot of sense.
00:26:09.781 - 00:26:13.957, Speaker B: So we just haven't seen that done before. And that's what makes me really kind.
00:26:13.981 - 00:26:15.765, Speaker D: Of bullish and excited on this.
00:26:15.885 - 00:26:23.759, Speaker C: Me too. But that's just one part of it, that's the passive contribution. You have an active. Let's talk about that.
00:26:23.847 - 00:26:26.119, Speaker B: Yeah, so the active piece of it.
00:26:26.167 - 00:26:31.007, Speaker D: Is called, we're calling it Dataquest. I've been obsessed with games all my life.
00:26:31.111 - 00:26:38.991, Speaker B: That's why I got into computer science. You know, the typical I'm going to grow up and make games thing. And then I graduated college and went.
00:26:39.023 - 00:26:41.519, Speaker D: To Microsoft and got into enterprise software.
00:26:41.647 - 00:26:46.159, Speaker B: So just a little away from games, you know, not too much.
00:26:46.327 - 00:26:48.715, Speaker D: But what we've done with Data Core.
00:26:48.855 - 00:26:51.611, Speaker B: Is we're building out a big mmo.
00:26:51.723 - 00:26:54.251, Speaker D: It's an old school, you know, pixel.
00:26:54.283 - 00:26:57.227, Speaker B: Art, Pokemon vibes mmo.
00:26:57.411 - 00:26:59.355, Speaker D: And what you're able to do there.
00:26:59.515 - 00:27:01.683, Speaker B: Is, you know, log into that world.
00:27:01.739 - 00:27:06.075, Speaker D: There's a whole story going on. The whole story is based on data ownership.
00:27:06.115 - 00:27:11.379, Speaker B: You know, you live in this fictional world where these large corporations are taking all of your data.
00:27:11.547 - 00:27:14.479, Speaker D: And there's an organization called the Navigators.
00:27:14.627 - 00:27:27.023, Speaker B: You know, think of the Navigators as the Linux to Microsoft's, you know, windows in the 90s. They're all about, you know, owning your data. And so one of the things that we're doing there is we've collected a.
00:27:27.039 - 00:27:28.919, Speaker D: Bunch of posts and we do this.
00:27:28.967 - 00:27:34.567, Speaker B: Every day on the election that's happening in the US between the, unfortunately, the.
00:27:34.591 - 00:27:37.327, Speaker D: Two bad decisions that we have, we'll.
00:27:37.351 - 00:27:39.375, Speaker C: See if it changes over time, right?
00:27:39.495 - 00:27:49.259, Speaker B: One can hope. Fingers, toes, everything crossed. So, you know, you log into this world and you walk up as your character and you see a massive billboard.
00:27:49.307 - 00:27:51.275, Speaker D: That'S kind of advertising the blue team.
00:27:51.315 - 00:27:54.779, Speaker B: And the red team. And folks can then read those posts.
00:27:54.827 - 00:27:59.755, Speaker D: That users have posted on communities like Reddit, on Twitter, so on and so forth.
00:27:59.835 - 00:28:05.011, Speaker B: And they are able to label them as is this a pro Democrat tweet?
00:28:05.043 - 00:28:09.883, Speaker D: Or is this a pro Republican tweet or is this a neutral tweet? And the reason that this kind of.
00:28:09.899 - 00:28:22.455, Speaker B: Stuff matters is because we've all seen the rise of prediction markets like Polymarket, for example, that's super popular. But one of the things that something.
00:28:22.495 - 00:28:31.607, Speaker D: Like polymarket is missing is you can see what odds Biden has over Trump. But you don't see a lot of the reasoning, you don't see a lot.
00:28:31.631 - 00:28:47.731, Speaker B: Of the data powering, why people are betting that way. It's primarily, I think this is going to happen, and obviously it's not purely speculative. I read the news today or I watched the debate, and this was my opinion after the debate.
00:28:47.883 - 00:28:54.803, Speaker D: So these datasets that we're building specifically around election is yet another example of that. So being able to.
00:28:54.899 - 00:29:13.839, Speaker B: You remember how when AI was just, you know, this current iteration of AI was starting out explainable, AI was a big deal. Like, you know, how do we break into the AI black box and explain what the. So this is basically kind of taking that same principle and allowing people to.
00:29:14.027 - 00:29:16.615, Speaker D: Label and augment data that's already out.
00:29:16.655 - 00:29:20.119, Speaker B: There and make it higher order, better.
00:29:20.207 - 00:29:23.159, Speaker D: Quality data and use that to power decisions.
00:29:23.207 - 00:29:25.823, Speaker B: So data sets like that, Rumi, are.
00:29:25.879 - 00:29:29.711, Speaker D: Invaluable for hedge funds, for example. And we've seen this in the past.
00:29:29.783 - 00:29:34.319, Speaker B: Right, like with Brexit and when the 2016 election happened.
00:29:34.447 - 00:29:36.647, Speaker D: Everyone wants this data because they want.
00:29:36.671 - 00:29:39.519, Speaker B: To use it as yet another component.
00:29:39.567 - 00:29:45.247, Speaker D: In their prediction models. So that's what the active piece of Navigate can do.
00:29:45.351 - 00:29:47.255, Speaker B: There's a real market for it and.
00:29:47.335 - 00:29:50.279, Speaker D: The contributors get rewarded for all of this effort.
00:29:50.367 - 00:30:31.511, Speaker C: So the contributors participate in something called Dataquest, right? They act as navigators. They go off into the wild of the Internet and verify or look or tag or just interact with data that they see, they give it. That also gets contributed to this decentralized intelligence platform. I was going to go in one direction, but I'm going to first ask everyone, if you're driving and you're listening to this podcast, please don't do this. But if otherwise, you're able to check out NVG8 navigate. NVG8IO is your website. You have to take a look at the art at these navigators.
00:30:31.511 - 00:31:02.675, Speaker C: It is just unbelievable. I've got to tell you, as someone who's been in the blockchain space for perhaps too long, a little bit jammed. When I talk about, I hear about gaming and blockchain, this is very special. I feel like you really get engaged in the characters and the avatars and the art that you've created here at Navigate. Can you talk a little bit about more of that, the gaming feeling, how people are getting engaged here, how your community has responded so far?
00:31:02.795 - 00:31:05.819, Speaker D: Absolutely. Shared this with a bunch of folks.
00:31:05.947 - 00:31:22.295, Speaker B: And obviously our community's been a critical part of the feedback process as well. But the idea was to make data fun and data cool, which is hard to do. So we're revealing this website in phases.
00:31:22.755 - 00:31:30.855, Speaker D: And close to the end of this month, you'll see the whole story of the navigators unfold on the website itself.
00:31:31.355 - 00:31:34.059, Speaker B: So I'm really looking forward to folks.
00:31:34.107 - 00:31:35.779, Speaker D: Seeing that and how they react to that.
00:31:35.827 - 00:31:39.481, Speaker B: But the idea was to have merch.
00:31:39.553 - 00:31:42.433, Speaker D: Around these navigators, to have something that.
00:31:42.489 - 00:31:44.521, Speaker B: Makes you feel like you've, you know.
00:31:44.553 - 00:31:47.577, Speaker D: You found your tribe, your digital tribe.
00:31:47.721 - 00:32:00.657, Speaker B: And you know, you see someone where you see someone, you know, sporting a Spotify logo or Nike or Adidas, and you're like, oh, you know, this guy must go on hikes or run or, you know, he has these particular shoes.
00:32:00.801 - 00:32:07.757, Speaker D: So he must be into sneakers and whatnot. And so that's the kind of thing that we wanted to project with Navigate.
00:32:07.901 - 00:32:10.525, Speaker B: Where if someone is wearing a Navigate.
00:32:10.565 - 00:32:13.989, Speaker D: Hoodie, you're like, oh, this person's really interested in data.
00:32:14.037 - 00:32:16.277, Speaker B: And they're all about data ownership and.
00:32:16.381 - 00:32:19.341, Speaker D: The monetization and control of their data.
00:32:19.493 - 00:32:23.757, Speaker B: So we wanted to do that in a friendly, approachable way.
00:32:23.861 - 00:32:26.509, Speaker D: And that's where the design for the.
00:32:26.557 - 00:32:36.907, Speaker B: Navigators and the whole gamification aspect came about, really making it into. Sounds a little odd, but a lifestyle brand of sorts around data.
00:32:37.011 - 00:33:23.565, Speaker C: I can definitely see that. And as you know, this podcast is called the Metaverse Podcast, and I know that some people may look at the first hype cycle of the Metaverse with some regret isn't the best word, but it's like there was a lot of promise there that perhaps wasn't achieved. But when I look at the assets that you're building just from a visual context, from a digital collectible context, that Navigate has even beyond just the simple action of the data collection, whether it's active or passive, of just the coolness of it. Like you said, the community, the fashion, the identity formation here, that for me is a third area of navigate what you're building that's incredibly cool and potentially incredibly powerful as the company continues to develop.
00:33:23.685 - 00:33:32.061, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, there's so much to do here. This is going to be quite the long journey and we're super excited about.
00:33:32.133 - 00:33:33.565, Speaker D: What the future holds.
00:33:33.685 - 00:33:36.837, Speaker B: The idea, obviously, is to start building.
00:33:36.901 - 00:33:38.873, Speaker D: These data sets and on onboard more.
00:33:38.929 - 00:33:52.473, Speaker B: Community members and then really kind of, you know, like I said, Data Quest, the active piece just becomes this kind of 2D pixel art, MMO slash metaverse.
00:33:52.529 - 00:33:53.817, Speaker D: Where you hang out and you do.
00:33:53.841 - 00:33:55.369, Speaker B: A bunch of things, you just, you.
00:33:55.377 - 00:33:59.913, Speaker D: Know, you play fun games, you do your data labeling, you talk about data.
00:34:00.049 - 00:34:06.675, Speaker B: It just becomes this online club of sorts for people with, with like minded.
00:34:06.715 - 00:34:09.179, Speaker D: People with shared interests to hang out.
00:34:09.307 - 00:34:19.499, Speaker B: And I think it's very critical to talk about data and data ownership because this is something that's going to matter.
00:34:19.587 - 00:34:21.347, Speaker D: More and more with each passing day.
00:34:21.371 - 00:34:25.459, Speaker B: And we're all seeing it and that's just, you know, that's what we hope.
00:34:25.507 - 00:34:27.827, Speaker D: That Dataquest can become kind of a.
00:34:27.851 - 00:34:29.539, Speaker B: Hub for all of the people who.
00:34:29.667 - 00:34:31.661, Speaker D: Are like minded and share this interest.
00:34:31.803 - 00:35:14.951, Speaker C: It is incredibly exciting what you and the NAVIGATE team are building. I was just wondering, you know, in our closing minutes though, if you can step back a little bit less about navigate, perhaps just more about you Ali, if that's okay. You have such an interesting and extensive background in AI and blockchain and gaming and I understand and hopefully our listeners and viewers have a good idea of the potential for navigate. But in the context of Web3 altogether, how do you see these technologies evolving? I'm just wondering what type of advice you would give to founders in terms of what they should be building to work with the Navigates of the world, to work with these emerging technologies. Where are we going?
00:35:15.063 - 00:35:18.503, Speaker D: I think we're going in an incredibly exciting direction.
00:35:18.599 - 00:35:26.607, Speaker B: I got red pilled on web3 as soon as I encountered it. I think there is a lot of.
00:35:26.751 - 00:35:28.595, Speaker D: Potential in the technology.
00:35:28.935 - 00:35:31.073, Speaker B: I think there is really.
00:35:31.169 - 00:35:38.193, Speaker D: Chris Dixon's book Read Write Own is such a fantastic introduction to this whole thing and kind of, you know, talks.
00:35:38.209 - 00:35:45.649, Speaker B: About the philosophy of it. Because Web3 is part technology and part philosophy. And it's really about this if you.
00:35:45.697 - 00:35:50.113, Speaker D: Believe in ownership of digital resources, in.
00:35:50.209 - 00:35:56.209, Speaker B: The ability to control your privacy, be able to have more of a say.
00:35:56.257 - 00:36:02.903, Speaker D: In how your data is used, for example, which is what we're doing with navigate. My advice to folks would be, and.
00:36:02.919 - 00:36:09.927, Speaker B: This is just kind of generally from what I've seen is there's a lot of infrastructure now whether you want to.
00:36:09.951 - 00:36:14.871, Speaker D: Look at things like even on Bitcoin, they have ordinals and there's talks of.
00:36:14.903 - 00:36:31.855, Speaker B: Bitcoin L2s and additional stuff like that on Ethereum. The technology is there through optimism, through arbitrum, et cetera. There are other chains as well. Now is the time for us to just go out and build cool applications. And the way that it always starts.
00:36:31.895 - 00:36:34.103, Speaker D: Is you take concepts in Web2 and.
00:36:34.119 - 00:36:41.575, Speaker B: You can say, hey, you know, I'm going to give this a web 3 spin. If people want to start there, that's fantastic. Like, you could make a, you know.
00:36:41.615 - 00:37:00.257, Speaker D: Web3 version of OneNote for example, but build applications, because we'll have to build thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of applications. Most of them will suck. And that's totally fine. And that is how we will make progress. I think the focus now needs to.
00:37:00.281 - 00:37:02.761, Speaker B: Be more on the application layer of.
00:37:02.793 - 00:37:16.865, Speaker D: Things than the infrastructural stuff, because I think the technology is there and we can build more infrastructure as we go along. But that's probably kind of the biggest pitfall I see, like, focusing too much.
00:37:16.905 - 00:37:19.649, Speaker B: On infra right now as opposed to.
00:37:19.697 - 00:37:24.977, Speaker D: Applications because we talk about bringing consumers on and mass adoption.
00:37:25.121 - 00:37:31.985, Speaker B: That's going to happen through an app. That's going to happen through you. Build one killer app, all of us get together.
00:37:32.145 - 00:37:36.257, Speaker D: And even if one of the teams in web 3 succeeds and builds this.
00:37:36.321 - 00:37:40.085, Speaker B: Absolutely killer app, there you go. We get mass adoption.
00:37:40.825 - 00:38:12.139, Speaker C: Well, I'm really hoping Navigate is that killer. We're trying for the future to get everyone owning their data, getting data back in the hands of those who create it. But thank you for making that experience fun as well. Right. For the users and just being a true pioneer in the space for so long. It's been a great pleasure having you here. I will say, for those who are unable to view right now, if you'll see behind Ali's, there's a guitar on his wall.
00:38:12.139 - 00:38:16.237, Speaker C: Maybe next time you're on the show, you can play some tune.
00:38:16.371 - 00:38:23.085, Speaker B: I'll have to practice a bunch before then, so you've got to give me a decent heads up. Maybe like a year or so.
00:38:23.785 - 00:38:30.801, Speaker C: I'm going to hold you to that. Navigate will be a success and you'll be rocking out in the guitar on this podcast again. All right, thank you so much.
00:38:30.913 - 00:38:32.001, Speaker D: Thank you, Rumi.
00:38:32.073 - 00:38:32.745, Speaker C: Always a pleasure.
