00:00:00.410 - 00:00:10.330, Speaker A: Hello, this is Aaron of Outlier Ventures, the organizers of diffusion, the multi protocol hackathon, this weekend in Berlin. And with me is Johan aid of Chainlink.
00:00:10.410 - 00:00:18.800, Speaker B: Hey, Joan. Hey guys, it's Johan eight from Chainlink. As you can see, I'm in Paris right now. It's a bit windy. Thank you, Aaron, for welcoming me.
00:00:19.250 - 00:00:25.462, Speaker A: Great. So yeah, tell us, what is Chainlink and what's new at Chainlink there?
00:00:25.596 - 00:00:55.440, Speaker B: Yeah, so Chainlink is building a decentralized oracle network. Basically our premise is just like whenever a developer wants to build a DAP, he doesn't want to have to rebuild the blockchain on which a DAP is sitting on. People who want to access external data shouldn't have to rebuild all the infrastructure to get this data right. So basically we want to provide the network which has all the infrastructure, all the right incentives to have players which get the data you need onto your smart contracts. That's what Chainlink is.
00:00:58.610 - 00:01:02.794, Speaker A: Of. With which blockchains can developers currently use Chainlink?
00:01:02.922 - 00:01:20.326, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So Chainlink is blockchain agnostic. So we are building a protocol that shouldn't rely on any blockchain currently. As you know, the state of the industry is still early. Right. With the lack of standards, it's very hard to be fully blockchain agnostic. In fact, right now.
00:01:20.326 - 00:01:30.710, Speaker B: So basically what happens that currently we're only on Ethereum, however our protocol is made to integrate on any other blockchains. It's just bit more work. So currently on Ethereum.
00:01:31.930 - 00:01:54.270, Speaker A: Excellent. Cool. Yeah, because diffusion is a multi protocol hackathon, and we're very happy for people to build on Ethereum, also very happy for them to build on many other technologies that are there. So it's good to know that Chainlink has this intention of supporting multiple. So when developers want to use Chainlink, what do they do? Do you have sdKs, APIs, Mainnet, testnets?
00:01:55.190 - 00:02:35.806, Speaker B: Yeah, so currently we're on Mainnet. We have a great documentation which we'll probably have ready for developers during the hackathon, where basically we show examples on how they can use solidity to create a chainlink request. Basically a chainlink request is something you send to an oracle to retrieve any kind of data. So currently any kind of public API can be accessed using Chainlink. And if you want authenticated API, we have created adapters which can plug into other systems. So for instance, flight stats for flight data, easy post for delivery data, and multiple other adapters. And if you need other data points, we can probably create it for you.
00:02:35.806 - 00:02:38.160, Speaker B: It takes 30 minutes, literally, to do.
00:02:39.170 - 00:02:40.922, Speaker A: All right. Well, we have a whole weekend.
00:02:41.066 - 00:02:42.686, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. We have time.
00:02:42.868 - 00:02:54.542, Speaker A: All right. Well, this looks great. So, yeah, thanks for this. I'm looking forward to meeting you this weekend at diffusion in Berlin. And, yeah, I hope that many of the teams at the hackathon. Will build with Chainlink. Yeah.
00:02:54.596 - 00:03:00.162, Speaker B: Thanks to you very much, Aaron. And, yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting you all in Berlin at diffusion.
00:03:00.226 - 00:03:00.710, Speaker A: All right.
00:03:00.780 - 00:03:02.166, Speaker B: See you this weekend then.
00:03:02.348 - 00:03:03.078, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:03:03.164 - 00:03:03.860, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
