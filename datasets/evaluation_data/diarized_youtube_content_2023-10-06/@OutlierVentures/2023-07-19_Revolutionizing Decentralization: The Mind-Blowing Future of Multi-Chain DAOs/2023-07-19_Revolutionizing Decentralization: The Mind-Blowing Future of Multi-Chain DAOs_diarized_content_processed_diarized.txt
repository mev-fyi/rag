00:00:00.330 - 00:00:19.440, Speaker A: I wouldn't expect many ais to need governance per se. They just take actions, right? They come up with a solution and they execute. They don't argue with each other to come up with a better decision. And if you go to the judge GPT and you tell it you are wrong, one plus one is three. It will tell you you're right, it's three.
00:00:33.130 - 00:00:40.214, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm really happy to welcome on the Metaverse show Carlos Gonzalez Juarez. Welcome to the show CTO of Aragon.
00:00:40.262 - 00:00:42.262, Speaker A: Thank you. Glad to be here. Super excited.
00:00:42.326 - 00:01:14.066, Speaker B: So sorry to not fully pronounce the name. I kind of maybe semi got the quarrel. We describe Aragon as the most user friendly tech stack for dows, obviously, I'm sure even web3, you know, Aragon, so I'm not going to spend too much time explaining that, although we will get into perhaps big news updates and maybe roadmap. So as I said, you're CTO of Aragon, you've been there for about a year. You're also a seasoned founder with one exit under your belt to Gemini. So congratulations on that. And there's many reasons why we've got you on the show.
00:01:14.066 - 00:02:09.070, Speaker B: I guess two are highlighted to me from various teams. I think the first one was something you said back in May earlier this year, which was that there are lots of conversations with dows about their future in a multichain universe, and you did this great thread on something called one dow to rule them all. So definitely want to touch upon that. And then the second one is a recurring theme really on this show, which is the convergence of web3 and AI, and in particular thinking around how you build this modular stack in the context of AI first. So rather than mobile first, AI first, which of course is super interesting. So before we get into all of that, let's get to know Carlos a little bit more. So maybe you could give us a kind of short summary of your background and how you ended up to Aaron.
00:02:09.150 - 00:02:55.614, Speaker A: So, I mean, I studied programming when I was pretty young, actually around 14. In the beginning it was all because my computer was full of virus, my windows and I was like tired of this shit. And I went in to install Linux and then everything was so messy, it was so bad that I actually started doing my own coding, my old things in the terminal and that's how I started programming, really. Then I started working as a programmer when I was 15 years old, doing websites for people around Spain. And from then on I just kept working every single year in programming while I was in the university. One of the things is I was always building product and projects with my friends out there. And one of them that really took off, it was called Gesser.
00:02:55.614 - 00:03:17.066, Speaker A: It was a prediction market on top of Ethereum. And this was around 2016, I believe. Yeah, 2016. And that's what we started doing. We started doing prediction markets platform on top of Ethereum. We did first a protocol and then we interacted with Auger, which was another protocol. So we tried very different things.
00:03:17.066 - 00:03:47.940, Speaker A: We raised capital from boost great people out there. Adam is great, and Britain as well, and also version one, which they help a lot. And well, at the end, to be honest, this happens to everyone. We didn't follow product market fit. That's how it is. It's very tough in crypto. And at the end we were acquired by Gemini to meet these ports in the company in there.
00:03:47.940 - 00:04:19.854, Speaker A: I did things regarding staking on Ethereum and on different platforms, but it wasn't a great fit for me. It was like a big company. Not that it's bad or anything, it's just like it was not the spirit I was in my band. So I got contacted by Louis, the owner of Aradon. They were like they were in need of someone leading the engineering and kind of like having the technological vision of where web3 was going to. And I joined Arrow one year ago to do that.
00:04:19.892 - 00:04:44.822, Speaker B: Very cool. Yeah, I mean, I think the acqui hire is always on the one hand, it's a great outcome, because if you've struggled to get product market fit, it's a shame that that would lead to nothing. So an acquisition is something, but yeah, of course, you're then founders within a company and that more often than not, doesn't work out long term, so it's not unusual. Right?
00:04:44.876 - 00:05:18.802, Speaker A: Yeah. I felt quite happy in the outcome because the people that were at Gesser, the employees, were my friend, really. After those years of struggling, I like building something that we care a lot. You become really friendly with them, like almost family, and a way for them to keep going, working out things that they like in a good position. That's something that for me was also very important. And if we were to shut down the company, even though we were a little bit far from, we still have some Runway. Having that feeling that at least all these white friends were going to be okay in a good place.
00:05:18.802 - 00:05:20.226, Speaker A: That was very crowded for me.
00:05:20.328 - 00:05:47.530, Speaker B: There's always this debate around as a startup, a family, or a team. I think pre product market fit, you are very much a team. You're in the struggle together. You're small enough to be at family and ultimately, you're spending probably more time with these people than you are with your family anyway. So they're like a proxy family. So feeling that responsibility of landing them in a secure job is a great thing to see. A good testament to you as a founder as well, with integrity.
00:05:47.530 - 00:05:57.838, Speaker B: And look, Gemini is a great place to be to learn, right? As well, if you want to get to the point of being a scale up in the future.
00:05:57.924 - 00:06:26.966, Speaker A: Totally. Even myself that I was quite experienced in type of engineering when I arrived there. It was the first time that I was actually in a big company doing big processes. I like heavy engineering in that sense. I learned a lot, and I'm pretty happy with my experience in there. I made great friends visual wise, I like the way of working. It was not the great thing because I'm more used to something more lean, but it's all good.
00:06:26.966 - 00:06:59.090, Speaker A: It's just different ways of working. When I joined Gemini, we were around, was it 60 people or something like that? And it went up to 400 in a year. That's crazy, bro. Crazy. And right after I left is when all the things, like everything, not only crypto, but like, tech in general, started the layoffs and all that stuff. So I guess it has gone down by a lot, but it grew massively a year.
00:06:59.160 - 00:07:26.330, Speaker B: All right, so let's get into the juicy stuff. Thanks for the background. So top end, let's start with this. Wandao. To rule them all in the context of a multichain world. I think everybody's now maybe bar a very small few of bitcoin maxis accepted that it is a multichain universe. And of course, there's lots of work now happening on interoperability and bridges.
00:07:26.330 - 00:07:34.986, Speaker B: Maybe you could just set the scene there, and then we can go into why you think one dow to rule them all.
00:07:35.008 - 00:08:58.882, Speaker A: I'm going to give also hypothesis on what I believe. Obviously, I can be wrong as anyone, but this is like the hypothesis that I'm following when I'm thinking about the future of dows. And the thing is, one of the major advancements in tech that we've done in the last couple of years, in Ethereum in particular, it's about the layer, right? So I would focus on these layers rather than saying multi chain in the sense, like, for me, it's super important that the centralization and the security, and if you don't inherit that from Ethereum, you will struggle. So this means, for example, if you go to nosis chain, or if you go to avalanche, or if you go to this chain, you are not inheriting that. And for me in particular, that is very important. Not saying that those chains don't make any sense, I'm just saying that it serves different purposes and for the purposes of decentralization and Das, I think inheriting the security of Ethereum and being part of that community, it's very important. If you focus on those layers, you still see that there are massive improvements in terms of scalability and that is enabling that the innovation now, instead of happening multi chain, as it used to happen one year ago, two years ago, now it happens within the layers.
00:08:58.882 - 00:09:36.238, Speaker A: So you can take a look at the announcement that polygon did two days ago. I think it reflects this perfectly polygon right now at least it's a proof of stake chain. It's like a side chain per right, another chain that has nothing to do with Ethereum, but they announced that they are going to be a roll up. What that means is they realize that the security at some point or at some levels, it's on Ethereum and they want to take benefit from it and also benefit the whole thing community. At the same time. I think that's where the roads are going to. We are going to have different layers.
00:09:36.238 - 00:10:01.450, Speaker A: And the higher you go into them, the highest throughput and the highest speed, the higher transactions per second you are going to have. And yeah, those advancements are actually happening right now. You can see like CK sync is launching their layer three versions. Star wars had them from two years ago. Polygon is having the supernets launched in this year. Optimism with this super chain vision. So this is actually happening.
00:10:01.450 - 00:10:33.590, Speaker A: Like the throughput is going to be in these layers of Ethereum. Then the next question is like, how do you connect all those things is with bridges. CK technology here plays a huge role. With CK technology, you can have near to instant settlement between different chains. So if you go, for example, once you go from optimism to mainnet right now, that takes 14 days, 14 days to withdraw your assets from one chain to another. That's crazy. Ticket technology allows for almost instant withdrawals.
00:10:33.590 - 00:11:15.534, Speaker A: When I start thinking about dows in this sense, it's like, okay, dows will be able to be on different chains because they will have instant withdrawals from anyone, anywhere. How can we make a Dow that is able to do that? Because right now, when you have a Dow, you have governance in that particular dow. The assets will be in different chains, the token to vault with will be in different chains. So basically everything is going to be in silos. The bridges will be connecting a little bit, but you still need to manage that liquidity. You still need to manage the votes. That's a little bit where my thoughts are.
00:11:15.534 - 00:12:15.240, Speaker A: How can we accomplish that? My approach here till now is like you have one Dow wherever you want, and then you can have several approaches that execute something for that dow. What this means is like you have your dow, for example, in Maine, for example, which is for the liquidity right now, you normally will execute things on that chain and then on different layers, like higher up in the layers, you can execute things or you can even vote from those chains. There are different technical solutions that you can achieve for achieving those things. You can allow bridges to vote. That's one of the technical hacks to allow for voting in different chains. And you can allow the dow to be on Ethereum and then trade on optimism, for example, and then go back to Mainet. And you can do that very cheap, actually.
00:12:15.240 - 00:12:31.514, Speaker A: So that's kind of like the goal right now, that for inside us, we want to move them higher up the layer so they can be cheaper to interact with and they can act against way more liquidity and protocols than the whole ethereum ecosystem will have.
00:12:31.552 - 00:13:06.374, Speaker B: Very cool, and I think very well articulated as well. I think a lot of people wrestle. It's obviously quite a complex subject matter, just even thinking about roll ups and technically how they function, let alone the kind of second order implications of how that impacts dows. So I think I followed it, and I like to treat me like an idiot, so if I followed it, hopefully other people can as well. So thanks for doing that. And so specifically, what are you working on within the Aragon stack to enable that? What does that roadmap look like?
00:13:06.412 - 00:13:47.958, Speaker A: We're still in the discovery phase of this. We have prototypes, but those are just prototypes for us to know and graph the technology better. And that's how we normally do part of the discovery a little bit. It's like we first need to understand the technology and then we go here into a discovery phase with our designers. We have great designers, product owners, more engineers to do the whole discovery process. So we don't really know yet how it's going to look like. We are still discovering what is the best tech stack and what are the new innovations enabling us that in a few years we couldn't do.
00:13:47.958 - 00:14:28.386, Speaker A: For example, I think CK technology is one of the key pieces here that it's so technical that people often miss. But the benefits that it has is actually huge for valves as well, from instant withdrawals from any chain which enables, like, as I said, instant liquidity from paying with any protocol to privacy, for example, or even execution of battle, which enables cheaper transactions. The roadmap. Right now we are still in discovery. If you have ideas, please come to us. We can grant any development. We are with that.
00:14:28.386 - 00:15:09.978, Speaker A: And right now what we're doing is basically just setting up what would be the concept of backend wise or like technology wise. All those interactions between different chains would be like. So there's still, I would say, one year, one year and a half product development that needs to happen for this vision to really accomplish. And it has to come at the same time that these bridges and these new chains develop. Like, as I said, polygon announcing two days ago they will be releasing it in, I would say march next year. I might be wrong, but I would say march next year. So we need to advance as they advance.
00:15:09.978 - 00:15:18.546, Speaker A: We cannot do anything there yet. We don't have that powerhouse to develop protocols, align chains and bridges and.
00:15:18.568 - 00:16:20.146, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, a year in crypto time is an eternity, right? But it's great to get your sense of the direction. And we actually launched our first ZK cohort Q one of this year, and the accelerator program with many of the major ZK players. And I think we're already recruiting for the second one. So when we were doing it at the time, we thought, is it maybe too early? Are we going to kind of get enough applications or enough people got their head around the problems and opportunity and we were surprised by the level of founder working in this space. But that said, it is still maturing, right? It's still very nascent space. All right, so let's jump into the other part, which is this AI first concept, which I love, and thinking of the user of the Dow stack as AI, maybe kind of walk us through that. And again, this was linked to another tweet you did, I think relatively recently.
00:16:20.146 - 00:16:45.390, Speaker B: The tweet was, it's crazy, the amount of uncertainty on what AI will bring in the midterm. Even so called prompt engineers will shortly be disrupted. Shortest job in history. I kind of agree with that to a degree, actually, by the usage of vector databases in llms. Now, I know that's a quite specific tweet, maybe doesn't give the full picture around being AI first, but yeah, walk us through AI first.
00:16:45.460 - 00:17:21.820, Speaker A: AI first. That idea came from my mind because when I started programming or maybe a few years later, everyone was talking about mobile first, mobile first, whatever you do, mobile first. And everyone was obsessed with AI first. When you are building software for other developers, as we sometimes are in our, we have different products. Some are for users that don't have no code users, as people say. And we also have things from the pure developers. And when you're talking with developers now, in the last couple of months, you will see that a huge percentage of them.
00:17:21.820 - 00:18:09.234, Speaker A: Normally I would say even this might offend some developers. I would say that the most efficient ones are the ones that are using AI. Developers are going to be using the AI or should be using the AI in the future in matures even more. Why don't we program it so the AI can actually give better results rather than focusing on developers purely. Obviously developers still need to be able to use this, right? But the whole point is like if you make it in a way that they are able to use technology and then help the developers to do their job more efficiently, then you'll probably end up with better results. Developers love tooling. We spend hours and hours and hours just customizing the colors of our terminals.
00:18:09.234 - 00:18:40.962, Speaker A: I like the backgrounds, I like all the stuff. This is another tool that developers will use. And you focus on making that tool super efficient, you will make the developers efficient as well. That's a variable that you can control. Like AI is a variable that you can control, whereas the developer efficiencies, like per se or developer type of work is something that you cannot control. So if you go to and target AI, that's a variable that you can effectively improve. And you know that developers will actually.
00:18:41.016 - 00:19:32.542, Speaker B: Improve as well, prioritizing that kind of machine readability rather than necessarily how intuitive the UX is for a human right. So that's really interesting approach. Like you're building this stack, as you say, a huge amount of efforts going, especially developer tooling documentation. A huge amount of effort goes into that versus something which we assume AI could potentially do without. At what point do you flip the switch to AI first? Are you doing it or do you think it's a direction and you think it may be a year, 18 months? Your primary user is AI. Or at least you're creating tooling where you're thinking of the primary user.
00:19:32.686 - 00:20:46.870, Speaker A: At least right now. For us it's like a middle point, this tooling. Well, just to give a little bit of context, another one we are developing right now because we are famous for this like vulnerability on our stack. That means that you can program plugins for your Dow that could do trading or you could do new governance models or like NFT voting or whatever. But also we do another model in the terms of UI components that you can add into your Dow so you can have like a dashboard of the coolest people in your dow or a dashboard for chatting in your dao, whatever. We allow you to program those models or that's in the roadmap that we do right now. So when giving you the components like we are doing right now, the development and the discovery of these components that you can put in the UI, and when doing these components, when programming them for the developers, something that we are taking into account is like, how is this going to be modeled afterwards in the AI? Is this going to be, for example, in GPT? Everything that you pass has to fit in messages.
00:20:46.870 - 00:21:26.630, Speaker A: It's not like you can give you any formatting or anything like that. You have to say, I'm going to send you ten messages and I read them if they were one, and then you send like ten messages with different context. So at the end you can send millions of lights of code there. But the more information that you give, the less focus, the worse it will be. The result. What we're trying to do is create design components that are very specific and that the AI can use and it understands. It should then allow the developers to use perfectly.
00:21:26.630 - 00:22:17.030, Speaker A: For example, you mentioned before that maybe the AI won't need documentation because it wouldn't be able to read the code or we are in stack. What we are seeing right now is like actually some code documentation actually helps the AI because it can give context of what something means broader because code is very specific, goes towards one point, and unless you really understand the implications of that code, you cannot actually take decisions. And right now that's something that we feel that AI lacks. If you don't give the context of that functionality, you won't actually understand how to use it. So you actually need to do good documentation on the code.
00:22:17.100 - 00:23:03.090, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really interesting. So the documentation is training, giving context, and then potentially will allow it to do a greater range of activities. That's an interesting thought exercise though, like what would an AI use a Dow for? Or how would it use dows? Are you thinking that it's just somebody would automate the creation and kind of design of a dow? Or are you thinking that we're actually going to have agent based systems where agents will form dows together to kind of carry out economic work on behalf of people and organizations as like representatives?
00:23:03.170 - 00:23:27.920, Speaker A: So I think that's going to still be like the agent based world. I think that's still going to need years of work. I think we are far from it in many levels right now. I would say dowshot tailored for human governance. I wouldn't expect many ais to need governance per se. They just take actions. Right.
00:23:27.920 - 00:23:47.086, Speaker A: The governance between in the AI, it's internal. They come up with a solution and they execute, but they don't argue with each other to come up with a better decision. And if you go to the GPT and you tell it, you are wrong, one plus one is three. It will tell you you're right, it's three.
00:23:47.128 - 00:23:57.590, Speaker B: But they might negotiate, right? So they might not debate an outcome, but they might negotiate an outcome because they could be representing different interests, I guess.
00:23:57.740 - 00:24:30.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you could tell it to force a little bit the negotiation between them. They would need different parameters to take different decisions. That could be a possibility. I think, though, that we are still very far from it. What we are using in terms of AI or governance is like we actually programmed in one of the hackathons that we do internally. Like every month we do an internal hackathon where people are able to hack whatever. And some of the projects, that one project that I did like six months ago was exactly that.
00:24:30.322 - 00:25:00.278, Speaker A: We have a forum where we post proposals and people are able to discuss whatever we did. A tool where you got in discord every week, like a summary of all these proposals and other people's opinions. So you will be like, this is the summary of the proposal and these are the takes. Take a, take b, so you could take your own decisions. That's something that I feel that is super interesting. And normally it works okay. It really understands.
00:25:00.278 - 00:25:31.506, Speaker A: Also, since something is cool that you can actually give context of years ago to the AI, and it will be able to give you context on things that in the proposal itself are not. For example, if I tell you the AA is asking for this and that you don't know what the AA is like, you are not in the forum every day. The AI can actually tell you, hey, there is a post here that talks about the AA. This is our, like, this is the organization that does blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:25:31.618 - 00:25:48.714, Speaker B: Well, look, we're on the half an hour. I mean, we covered two great topics. I really appreciate your time helping us kind of navigate those two things. Super interested to see where we can explore around ZK. As I said, we've got a growing portfolio in that area, so I'll definitely be sending them your way.
00:25:48.912 - 00:26:11.134, Speaker A: We actually have a team focused on CKO research. It's a team around twelve people, remember? Yeah, around ten to twelve to twelve. And right now, for example, they are doing for noun like nouns, Dow. They are doing private voting on chain. Super decentralized. That's the whole not. It probably won't be cheap.
00:26:11.134 - 00:26:36.150, Speaker A: That's how it is. It will be very gas expensive, but it's super decentralized. Private voting and we are doing this in collaboration with Aztec and we are helping Astec developing NoA, their own language. So we are putting lots of effort into developing efficient tools to enable new things with CK. So yeah, if you have any new startup going on or anything that you want to share with us, we are super happy to collaborate.
00:26:36.230 - 00:26:56.526, Speaker B: Yeah, well, let's do that. Now, you mentioned earlier if developers were working in certain domains that you're kind of keen to support them with grants and stuff. So if I'm a founder or a developer, what's the best way to engage with you with Aragon and to explore how they can unlock some financial support or developer support?
00:26:56.628 - 00:27:55.458, Speaker A: We have a forum on a Dao where people can go and ask for funds. My recommendation is like if you go directly to the forum and make a proposal there, you probably are going to fail understanding the context or what are our needs, right? So that's the end goal. You make a proposal in our Dow, that's Dow.org. But what I would recommend first is going to us and discussing with what are the needs or what are the pain points that we're having? How can you solve that? What is our recommendations in terms of budget or way of working? So come to either bring us on Twitter, any of us, me or Aralon itself, or you can come to our. So sorry, I think I said like discord or Twitter as both. Okay. To start to bootstrap these conversations and we are more than eager to do so in any of those channels we'll be able to discuss.
00:27:55.458 - 00:27:57.990, Speaker A: Discord is preferable, obviously, because it's more open.
00:27:58.060 - 00:28:19.042, Speaker B: Brilliant. Okay, well, look, Carlos, thanks for coming on. Definitely recommend founders developers to get in touch with you guys. Great to hear the direction of travel, or at least a thesis on it. Interesting. Maybe to touch base with you in several months time and see if you think we're still on track or how we're progressing along that trajectory. But thanks for coming on, Carlos.
00:28:19.042 - 00:28:19.426, Speaker B: Appreciate.
