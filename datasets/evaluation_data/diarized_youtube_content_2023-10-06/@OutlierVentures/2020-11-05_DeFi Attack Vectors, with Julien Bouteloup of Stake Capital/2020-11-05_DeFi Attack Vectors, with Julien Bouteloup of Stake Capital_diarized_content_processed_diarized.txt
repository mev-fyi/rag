00:00:18.730 - 00:00:50.826, Speaker A: So welcome to another session of Diffusion Live. We've June Butterloop, which actually translates as Wolf Hunter, which I'm incredibly jealous about in French. He is the CEO of State Capital, a Defi quantitative hedge fund. He wears two hats. On one hand, he does defi security audits. On the other hand, he does this algorithmic trading at the fund. And so, I guess, gets to leverage the understanding of security risks.
00:00:50.826 - 00:01:13.256, Speaker A: And so today we're going to get him to talk about Defi attack vectors. But before we do, Julian, welcome to the show. Thanks for joining. So, could you just tell us a little bit about your day to day? As I said, you've got two hats. Be good to understand those two roles and how they interplay and how you leverage them.
00:01:13.438 - 00:02:10.152, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So my background is very tech computer science, and got a master in electrical engineering. So I've been working in tech for many years. In DeFi, I do security audits. So I like to find some, like, go deep inside those different decentralized financial products, decentralized applications, either to find some vulnerabilities and try to fix them. And then on the other side, on stake capital, we start as a staking as a service two years ago. So we made acquisition of a few different baker or different services in a staking as a service such as Tezos pocket and cosmos.
00:02:10.152 - 00:02:46.984, Speaker B: But we primarily focus on Ethereum. So this is about 20% of the business model, and then the rest is liquidity provider, market maker, arbitrage, a few different things like that. So we really deep on understanding the different protocols. Most people, they call it DeFi legal. So how can we can leverage each of those protocols to make the ecosystem a safer place? I would say, yeah.
00:02:47.022 - 00:03:40.120, Speaker A: And so I've been following you a bit on Twitter, and you certainly helped me navigate and understand what's going on in DeFi equally, when I put out a tweet, I think this week, last week, asking for somebody to come on the show, you were recommended multiple times in order that we can begin to try to help people navigate and understand what's going on in Defi and these various attack vectors. Every week we hear about some kind of attack, whether that's an oracle attack, an economic attack, vampire attacks. I know off air, you were talking about things like governance attacks and things around flash loans. So ultimately, the success of Defi as money Lego comes from its composability. But with that composability, of course, it brings several new forms of risk or attack vectors. And so these are things I want to talk through. So at a high level.
00:03:40.120 - 00:03:54.590, Speaker A: Could you talk us through the variation of attacks that we're seeing and the kind of the frequency and I guess where we're seeing the most impact. And after that we're going to focus in on one. You did a great tweet storm on a few weeks back.
00:03:54.960 - 00:04:41.960, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So in a defi space, because the protocol is completely permissionless and transparent, people, they can analyze different condition between those different products. So for example, you can use some liquidity. Imagine if you have some arbitrage like the same as the traditional market, you find some arbitrage opportunities. For example, you find the price of a specific asset on Uniswap that is trading lower than for example on Kyber. So you might actually want to buy those assets on uniswap and sell them on Kyber. So those are simple arbitrage.
00:04:41.960 - 00:05:05.168, Speaker B: And then you have people that doing everyday. So that's called like market maker, simple market maker. And you have other people providing liquidity on the market. So for example, you can provide liquidity on curve, or you can provide liquidity on ave or compound or uniswap and then make a return on those liquidity provisions.
00:05:05.344 - 00:05:20.836, Speaker A: So all that stuff is like a healthy functioning market. So none of those things are things to be concerned about. And having arbitrage opportunities is a good thing. And there's all the other stuff that kind of comes after that, which new.
00:05:20.938 - 00:06:16.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I wanted to mention this, because for most people, they think those attacks and those arbitrage, they call it like crime or attacks, but they basically not most of them, but except if they used some vulnerabilities, they were inside the protocol. But some of them are exactly the same. It's just like finding an arbitrage opportunity. But instead of just using a small liquidity provision from a specific place, for example like on Fulcrum or AAvE, you use flash loan, but flash loan not just a feature to empower accessibility to most of the people to be able to do those arbitrage. But if you're well and you have a lot of liquidity, you don't actually need a flash loan. You can actually trigger those arbitrage yourself.
00:06:19.340 - 00:06:25.656, Speaker A: Let's talk about the flash loan thing for a second. So maybe just describe a flash loan for people that might not be familiar.
00:06:25.768 - 00:07:45.888, Speaker B: Yeah. So flash loan are the ability to do under collateralized loan and use this loan, use this liquidity to do a specific action on the market and then reimburse the loan. But all those different actions are within the block. So twelve minutes and the thing is that you don't actually need to provide funds to triggered to have access to those liquidity. So, for example, someone that has zero, an empty wallet or maybe just a few eth inside the wallet to pay for the gas, can actually trigger ten or 15 or 20 million under collateralized loan, as long as he's able to reimburse the loan inside the same block, plus a little bit of fees for the person who's providing the liquidity. So, for example, like the two biggest hackers on the market are Ave and DyDX, and they charge a little bit of fees when you request this loan. But anyone can actually trigger a loan and trigger a flash loan.
00:07:45.888 - 00:07:47.600, Speaker B: It's super easy, right?
00:07:47.690 - 00:08:14.480, Speaker A: And so all the other things that you mentioned around arbitrage opportunities, you say if you have the collateral, that's nothing new, that's just a healthy functioning capital market. But flash loans are new because of this under collateralization feature. And so, yeah, could you talk us through the things that you would class as true attacks perhaps, rather than just kind of a simple arbitrage opportunity or maybe the full spectrum.
00:08:15.140 - 00:09:26.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I have to make sure I don't use proper wordings, but it depends if you're using the protocol properly, meaning that you make a flash loan, for example, you use a flash loan on Ave, you take $10 million, and then you go on uniswap. For example, you take a short on fulcrum, a five x on bitcoin price, and then you dump. So you get those ease, you collateralize them into fulcrum, and then you take the bitcoin, right, BTC, and you sell them on uniswap. So basically the price goes down. So then you trigger your short, and then you reimburse the loan and you make a profit. Would you call this an attack? For me, it's an arbitrage. I think the reason why the market exists and the reason why decentralized finance exists is because of arbitragers.
00:09:26.640 - 00:10:02.444, Speaker B: Otherwise, if there is no arbitrage, there is no market. It's like traditional finance. If you don't have people providing you a quote on both side on the sell and buy, then you will not find any decentralized exchange, obviously. And then you have other system where there's a bug in the system. And then those people, they use the system for their own interest. So then those attacks are bad arbitrage or bad, they can be considered as crime and. Yeah, depends.
00:10:02.444 - 00:10:42.992, Speaker B: But I think the reason why arbitrage is good in the cost system, it actually showed people that they need to be cautious and be careful. Otherwise it will be like a complete Disneyland, like yield farming. If nothing happened in the space, people continue and they're not scared or they don't have any. I mean, those big API. If you have big API, there's a reason for that. If you take profit on one side, it means that other people are losing money. So it's always the same as as long as you make money, then you call the system super interesting and you collapse your hands.
00:10:42.992 - 00:10:52.070, Speaker B: But if you lose money, then you call for scam. But if you make money, then someone else is losing money.
00:10:52.840 - 00:11:25.496, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess one of my questions was, do you see these air quote attacks as a bug or a feature of defi? And are they in aggregate net beneficial? So whilst the DFI community is probably little more than 1% of even the crypto population, let alone the global population of traders, are these things not just hardening the network and making the overall system more resilient?
00:11:25.688 - 00:12:04.084, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. I think we need white hackers. But if you need white hackers, you need also bad hackers. You need people to find vulnerabilities and to post to make sure that the system you're using is not 100% safe. That's the reason why people will build better security, they will increase some insurance mechanism. That's the reason why, for example, if you use a protocol, you better insure yourself, you better hedge yourself. The reason why those products exist is because the system is not 100% secure.
00:12:04.084 - 00:12:32.640, Speaker B: And people, they need to understand that. They cannot just, they call it like Dejan, jump into the protocol because the APY is 300 or 500 or 1000%. But yeah, they need to be careful because a lot of these different protocols, they're not fully audited. And even if a system is fully audited, it doesn't mean that you cannot get affected by a small or bigger vulnerability.
00:12:33.940 - 00:13:16.364, Speaker A: Yeah, and so let's go into that. As I said, you do defi security audits, obviously incredibly in demand at the moment. I've heard there's a backlog of new protocols coming to market that want to get their smart contracts audited. It's just like almost impossible. It's like several month backlog. Could you talk us through some of the kind of technical exploits? So there are oracle attacks, as we said, smart contract attacks, and then also people attacking the underlying economics. I don't know if that's of a single protocol or exploiting where multiple DeFI protocols are combined.
00:13:16.364 - 00:13:25.270, Speaker A: Could you talk us through some of the perhaps more what would be perceived as malicious attacks, even though, as we just discussed, you could also argue that they're just hardening the system.
00:13:25.960 - 00:15:05.248, Speaker B: Yeah, well, malicious attacks are attacks there that people, they like to call it code is low. So people will probably. What I think is malicious and it's bad is when people put backdoor inside the code and they make it in such a way that it's really difficult to understand how this backdoor can be triggered either if it's reinsurance inside the smart contract, or trigger, because there's another system that's being fragileized. But yeah, I think codes inside the smart contract are the most malicious attacks because even if you spend a lot of time inside the contract, it's not guaranteed that it's not a backdoor, except if you have five or different audits on the same smart contract. And that's the reason why I think yield farming during summer took off is because most of those contracts, they were actually just contracts that were reused from, well, audited contracts such as the one from synthetix. This contract, like the Unipool or other contract, they were actually used in the ecosystem for locking a lot of TVL. So if you have a lot of money in one place, and this place has never been hacked because the bounty is so big for a hacker, means that it's pretty safe.
00:15:05.248 - 00:16:34.268, Speaker B: So if someone just reuse it and doesn't change any side, the code, and you can actually check if the code actually changed inside, you can make a diff on the contract and then you can be 100% sure that it's safe to use. So then what happened is like the system of locking and lock where the contract doesn't change for two weeks, that's the reason what happened with sushi swap and a few different things of that. So I think this is one of the most malicious attack, the ones that are on the card. And then now we're seeing new kind of attacks where I think it's more a replication of how society works, which I think is really interesting is the governance, either because those protocols, for example like ave or curve finance, I think one of them because for now, for example like Uniswap, it's not really decentralized, it's mostly owned by Dharma. And then you also have compound, I think protocol for now. I mean, they're moving into full decentralizations. But full decentralization can be actually very dangerous because if someone control a big piece of your protocol and then it's got incentivized for some reason, for one way or another to take a decision of not vot on a proposal.
00:16:34.268 - 00:17:10.456, Speaker B: If your protocol is fully decentralized, then it can actually pose risk to the protocol. And some people might argue that because it's got so much big piece of the cake, then it won't do such things. But it depends. Maybe there's a competitor on the market that has got a bigger, bigger cake and then it can actually be incentivized to do such things. And now we saw. So those type of attacks are only possible if you have a lot of funding and a lot of percentage ownership inside the protocol. I think it was a week ago, what happened on maker.
00:17:10.456 - 00:17:48.520, Speaker B: So maker got actually attacked on a governance level. One of the protocol, they were trying to get his proposal passed over there did a flash loan. So actually used a flash loan to borrow a lot of maker and then pass his vote. And then because the system is built in such a way that it's a little bit complex, then maker didn't see it at the beginning, but then the protocol was really clear what it did. But yeah, flash loan, having access to flash loan can actually pose a lot of risk in the governance aside. So governance and card in the contract are malicious attacks?
00:17:48.940 - 00:18:07.836, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean there's just such an order of magnitude of complexity and as I said, there's also things like Oracle attacks affecting smart contract and what it executes based upon the data that goes into it. So I know today you're going to.
00:18:07.858 - 00:19:02.624, Speaker B: Focus on, but I think overcode attack for me, they're not really, I wouldn't call them like malicious attack because overcode attack, you can expect those attacks to, I mean, you understand the protocol is completely transparent and you understand that the oracle, if you actually base your price mechanism on a pool that for example, on an asset inside a pool that can be easily manipulated with a lot of money, then you might actually expect to be wrecked because it's very likely that someone can actually provide a lot of liquidity inside the pool and change the asset value inside and then collapse the value. So if you price your system on that modification, then obviously it's not good. Yeah.
00:19:02.662 - 00:19:48.220, Speaker A: So I guess the semantics are these are vulnerabilities based upon design choices rather than necessarily malicious or what you'd even determine as attack. I guess if you are the protocol, you would regard it as an attack on your design. But as you say, I think attack comes with loaded terms. And effectively, if you're building a system and you're designing it in a certain way, you should be thinking through all these different attack vectors and trying to accommodate for them. I guess, at the same time, probably similar to you intellectually. It's fascinating because of the degree of complexity. And as you say, it's not just at a technical level, it's not just an economic level.
00:19:48.220 - 00:20:10.736, Speaker A: It's also at a kind of social governance level. So today, you're going to talk us through. We're going to zoom in specifically into something called the fulcrum attack, which is actually pinned to your Twitter account. Your Twitter account. Your Twitter handle, I believe, is next to your name here on the screen. It went crazy. So you should never measure a man by his likes.
00:20:10.736 - 00:20:27.324, Speaker A: But it had 414 retweets, six, nine likes. So that clearly means something. I think it was a very simple explanation, breakdown step by step of what happened. And you're going to talk us through that now.
00:20:27.522 - 00:21:05.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this one is very interesting because beginning of the year, so Ave was actually building flash loan mechanism. So I can probably, maybe it's. Where is that? Um, boys, this one, me slowing.
00:21:06.080 - 00:21:07.556, Speaker A: This was a medium post you did.
00:21:07.578 - 00:21:42.800, Speaker B: Recently, right, was actually the first week of January. That was the first flash loan ever made in a defi space. I mean, flash loan, only defi. So I think this one was probably the first flash loan. So it was like beginning of. I explained how the flash loan was triggered and a different money made on arbitrage. Arbitrage mostly on stable coins.
00:21:42.800 - 00:23:03.372, Speaker B: Arbitrage on stable coins are nice because you understand you're not taking any speculation, any exposure to speculation. So one was the first arbitrage, and then I think that was a couple of weeks after this. So people got a little bit knowledgeable about flash loan, and they could actually do a few different things in an ecosystem. So this one was actually the first attack, the biggest attack on the defi space, using a flash loan. And this attack, or arbitrage, whatever you call it, depends on your appetite. But this kind of attack is super easy. Most people, they think this is obviously, like, if you look at those different connections, basically each of those protocols that were used inside this attack, for example, you got DydX, you got Kyber here, you also have like, uniswap, you got a few different connections, and then the main contract that deployed the attack.
00:23:03.372 - 00:24:20.900, Speaker B: So when you do an arbitrage, when you do, like, a flash loan, you need to add piece of code inside the contract and deploy the contract, add enough funding inside the contract to be able to pay for the gas. Inside the contract, you get the logic. And inside this contract, where you have the logic, you have a few different functions and those few different functions will help you trigger those different actions. So on a high level, it was an attack on Fulcrum. The reason for that is the person who did those very nice steps basically didn't a flash loan from Dydx by borrowing $2.7 billion, I mean, ten k e back then at the price back in February, and then basically put half, a little bit more than half on compound to get some, let's call it BTC. Obviously it's right BTC because it's on the Ethereum.
00:24:20.900 - 00:25:37.336, Speaker B: So it took actually like half of it and then took a short on fulcrum, a short by five x, meaning imagine you have a short, you're basically betting on the price that is going to collapse for that specific bitcoin. How do you make sure you collapse the price? Well, what you do, you look at where is Fulcrum getting his price? Oracle so that's why those attacks, the people like judging those hackers and they're saying this is bad whatsoever. Those people, they have a very nice knowledge about those different defi applications and they are the ones that actually either make sure those applications are safe or they also sometime used for their own interest. But my point is, you need to understand the entire ecosystem. So what you do, you go inside Fulcrum and you actually check how they get their price. Oracle and then you borrow liquidity from, you make a flash loan from DydX, you get ten k, you put those eth because Dydx only give you eth. So you get those eth into compound, you get in exchange, it's a secure loan.
00:25:37.336 - 00:26:44.896, Speaker B: So it's not under collateralized loan, it's a secure loan from compound. Then you borrow 112 BTC bitcoin, then you place your shot with the other half that you borrow from IDX on Fulcrum. And then what you do, you dump those one that you borrow from compound, you dump them on Kyber, uniswap. So kyber and uniswap. So then you triggered price change for fukrum price. Oracle and then what happened is like your shot got triggered, so basically the price goes down, then you reimburse the loan, you reimburse your shot and you leave and you make a lot of profit. So it's a super simple attack, this one, and then obviously because people got understanding of this one and then they were able to do other type of attacks, for example, the latice one on harvest and few different things, but those type of things are just using the protocol as it was designed, not like malicious code inside the contract.
00:26:44.896 - 00:27:44.500, Speaker B: So you might argue that someone understood the price Oracle mechanism and actually used it for its own to do like an attack on Oracle. But at the end of the day, those oracles, they behave as they were designed just because those systems, they didn't actually expect or they didn't build the protocol in such a way that someone, a big well, could actually come and damp a lot of asset. But you don't need full Chrome, you don't need flash loan to do those type of attacks. You can just be a big well, you have like $3 million and you can do it yourself. So what actually, a lot of people is like normal people can actually behave as wells and then maintain the protocol to be safe by either obviously doing those kind of attacks. So it's your own judgment to say if it's bad or not. But I do think that those type of attacks, they make the system safer.
00:27:45.320 - 00:27:54.488, Speaker A: Yeah, fascinating. Thanks for walking us through that. So, on that particular attack, how much profit do you think the attacker made?
00:27:54.654 - 00:28:26.900, Speaker B: Well, this one was like a little bit less than half a million. Like 253. I think it was like 400, a little bit more. Because obviously when you provide, sometimes you can. Not on this one, but sometime as well. When you provide liquidity, you also make the underlying asset, native asset tokens that you can actually receive some tokens from the protocol. So you can also receive a little bit of rewards when doing those attacks.
00:28:27.240 - 00:29:16.724, Speaker A: Understood. So circling back to what I was saying at the top end, which is if this is a feature rather than a bug, and clearly you're somebody that does these security audits. And as I mentioned, there's this, there's not many people that can understand systems and all the different attack vectors with the level of proficiency of you or for example, the person that carried out this attack. So does this get worse before it gets better? How do you see, since this exploit is something that just grows in volume and the profit that's taken, I think.
00:29:16.762 - 00:30:26.724, Speaker B: For example, well, it depends now, because people, they understand that they can get, even if your contract is fully audited and there's no backdoor, there's no malicious piece of codes inside, but then they understand that they can get vulnerability from the outside, because as you mentioned before, it's a money legal. So if you price or if you base, if you build your protocol to get outside values to make some modification inside your system, you have to be 100% sure that those outside features that you're bringing on are fully either secure or they're not going to be used to attack your systems. So my point is, now that people are actually adding a few different. For example, during the yield farming phase, you add people. They were. Now it's happening. For example, you have, how do you call it, top flow.
00:30:26.724 - 00:31:31.244, Speaker B: So a pool cannot get more liquidity and then it stops at some point, because if the pool gets more liquidity than necessary, then someone can actually trigger an attack on the top of it. Or you have some, how do you call it? Trigger. You can immediately trigger like urgent triggers where you can deploy to make sure that it stops and freeze the found inside the pool before something needs to be fixed. And I think one of them that is leading the race and builds different mechanics to make sure the system is safe, one of them that are really professional is white earn. I think they're really tacking with the version two. They're taking the next level of bringing security to the next level inside the protocol because they're basically getting involved in a few different deFi space over there. Yeah, you have to take security to very high standards.
00:31:31.244 - 00:31:39.120, Speaker B: And also one of them is curved finance. They've been audited multiple times for very various auditing firms.
00:31:43.080 - 00:32:06.628, Speaker A: In simple terms, you are only as secure as your neighboring protocol. Right. If you are benefiting from composability, interoperability with every other DeFi protocol that there is a dependency or relationship with, you can only be as secure as that protocol. Putting aside your own kind of, let's call them internal or network specific.
00:32:06.814 - 00:33:08.940, Speaker B: Yeah. Or you can build different levels of security. If you find the first level is getting a little bit sneaky or like there's something happening, you can always backtrack to the second level. With flash loan, it's a little bit difficult. Flash loan are good, for example, like for system where you need more than one block in order to use a system, because flash loan, they can only operate in one block. But if your system requires more than one block, so you have like integral and for example, governance level, then you cannot really use flashroom for those ones. But yeah, flash loans are just a feature per day I receive like ten or 20 messages and they're like, oh, can you tell me how to use flash loans? I'm like, flash loans are super easy to use.
00:33:08.940 - 00:33:40.490, Speaker B: Everyone can actually use it. You don't need to be like, I mean, a little bit technical, but you can actually use it. But the difference is what you can do with those flash loans, those arbitrage are very difficult to find and those kind of vulnerabilities first, you cannot actually use a flashlone by yourself. Don't even think you can actually trigger those kind of attacks, because those one, I mean, not attacks, but like those kind of arbitrage, because those one, you need to understand the code, the underlying functionality, the underlying mechanism, and how they link to each other.
00:33:41.260 - 00:34:28.410, Speaker A: I mean, in a way, it's democratizing the ability to exploit arbitrage in the system. And presumably, the more people that are doing that in the system, the more hardened it becomes, resilient it becomes. So it's difficult to. I mean, it's one of those things. Of course, now, if you speak to an institutional investor participant, it'll be the thing that will put them off from DeFi. But at the same time, for me, it feels like the reason why DeFi is going to win, right? Because if you just think effectively, it's probably the biggest bug bounty that the world, in aggregate, if you look at.
00:34:30.460 - 00:35:12.592, Speaker B: DeFi, is exactly what happened on protocols level. For example, one of the biggest bounty in the world is bitcoin. If someone is good enough and a hacker, then go and hack and try to hack a bitcoin. If you can hack it, I think it will be good for the ecosystem because it means that it was not secure enough. If something can be hacked in decentralized finance, then it means that the system was not properly built and needs to be modified, needs to be increased. The security needs to be increased over there. I mean, traditional finance, in a traditional society, a bank is protected by a safe.
00:35:12.592 - 00:35:52.076, Speaker B: And obviously, if you try to go and then enter the bank, you're making a crime, because this is how the bank is protected. This is how the centralized finance is working. They got it safe in decentralized finance, because the system is building in a way that everyone can actually access it, everyone can modify it, everyone can use it. So you need to be 100% sure the system is secure. And the only way you can actually secure a system is by having white hackers trying to find vulnerabilities and trying to secure the system. But at the same time, you need people to use those different mechanisms to make sure that the system you built is actually secure.
00:35:52.268 - 00:36:37.890, Speaker A: Yeah, and as you said, there are some white hackers who have returned funds. But equally, you could argue that there is a good reason to have enough of a profit motive to make the system work. So not only with things like flash loans are you democratizing the amount of people that can effectively participate in the game of DeFi. But equally, one of the other reasons why you could argue it will outcompete traditional capital markets as a system is because most stock markets have a break, right. If something happens that they don't want, it's too much of a shock to the system. They can just halt trading. Whilst in DFI, it's twenty four seven and there's very few ways to kind of put a break on things.
00:36:37.890 - 00:37:01.930, Speaker A: You've also been tweeting recently about how some of the big four firms are looking at this. Big four accounting firms are looking at this. And you've also raised concerns about smart contract audits being seen as legal verification somehow. Could you talk about how that world is looking at this space?
00:37:03.500 - 00:38:06.510, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. You're talking about auditing firm and trying to go inside. Yeah, I mean you've got actually different startups that are building auditing on the top of smart contract and transaction. But I think the accounting as well is probably one of the big market for that. But on the auditing side, you got actually traditional companies that now are trying, for example Ashantur, like big corporations and also because now hedge fund or like big banks like Morgan or society general and all those different big banking systems, they're now looking into getting their really advanced. I mean, some people that work there in Edgefound, they're very top notch mathematician people like programming and all the stuff. So now they need very advanced auditing system that they can.
00:38:06.510 - 00:38:39.130, Speaker B: So they're actually building their own department of auditing inside. I think one of the system that will be good in Ethereum that you can find in other protocols, for example, like in Tezos, it's actually formal verifications where you make sure that the contract, that the different function that you have, I mean, high level understanding is you basically can fully test your contract. That is not possible in Ethereum right now because we mean fully functional formal verification system.
00:38:41.580 - 00:39:06.928, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, it's been really fascinating talking to you, Julian. So thanks for coming on the show. I know I've personally learned a lot. I know that a lot of other people that have been really struggling wrestling with trying to understand what's going on in Defi, I'm sure this has really given them a leg up. People can, as I said, follow you on your twitter handle. So Julian, Wolf Hunter booter loop, thanks for coming on the show.
00:39:07.094 - 00:39:47.390, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks Jamie, for having me. I would actually start, I mean, I used to do like free class for Ethereum back in London. I think it was like back in 2016 with Nick Johnson and all those different guys. And I will start doing it again online, doing some probably do some class, free class for flash loan, how to use flash loan, how to trigger your first flash loans. But I think people shouldn't be scared about flash loan. Flash loan is just like one feature. People will just forget about flash loan and maybe in a year and that will be something else.
00:39:47.390 - 00:39:52.456, Speaker B: It's always like that. But flash loans are really useful for the ecosystem to be safe.
00:39:52.648 - 00:40:15.510, Speaker A: Well, by the way, I don't know why do it for free. I mean it's very generous of you but I think you could probably charge a lot of money for that. So I guess if you're going to be doing those tutorials people can follow you on Twitter. You'll promote them as and when you roll them out again. Thanks for coming on the show. Definitely going to get you on again. I'm sure the next big attack or arbitrage event.
00:40:15.960 - 00:40:18.048, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. Thanks Jamie for having me. Bye.
