00:00:05.770 - 00:00:42.650, Speaker A: Hi everyone, I'm Matthew Stace, token design lead at Altlive Ventures. And this is the 6th episode of a new Alpha Ventures series where we are going to cover a range of topics related to token design, such as token economics, mechanism design and token engineering. Alpha ventures or I may hold tokens mentioned on the show, but nothing said here constitutes financial advice. So please do your own research before making any investment decisions. And today I'd like to welcome Andre Biliakov, the founder of Opium Protocol, which is a protocol that allows for creating, settling and trading of any decentralized derivative. So yeah, very good to have you here, Andre.
00:00:43.310 - 00:00:51.838, Speaker B: Hello. Hello. Thank you so much for introduction and for inviting. Happy to speak about these things all day long.
00:00:52.004 - 00:01:00.480, Speaker A: Likewise, likewise. So to kick off, can you please tell us about your background, how you ended up founding opium and about what opium does?
00:01:02.390 - 00:01:52.602, Speaker B: Yes, sure. So my background basically is traditional finance, centralized finance. And I used to be a bond trader and I used to manage also some different funds, including hedge funds. And hedge funds normally utilize a lot of derivatives and that's what I absolutely love to do. So three years ago I quit to start to build derivatives on the blockchain. It was no defi, it was just me working with traditional derivatives all my life. And seeing that here is technology which can change the world, make exotic derivatives available to everyone, make it very efficient, transparent, permissionless, so on and so on.
00:01:52.602 - 00:01:59.170, Speaker B: And that's how we started. But I knew quite a lot about derivatives. I love them from the beginning.
00:02:00.790 - 00:02:11.670, Speaker A: Interesting. And yeah, can you briefly describe what opium does? I mean, I kind of outlined it at the beginning, but maybe you're going to do a better job.
00:02:11.820 - 00:02:49.762, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, you said it all right, you said about derivatives, but maybe I just say a little bit about derivatives. Not everybody like thinking of derivatives on a daily basis. Normal people don't, but everybody has exposure to derivatives. That's also true. So it means if you have a bank account, if you have insurance, if you have savings account, checking account, it doesn't matter. Any financial product almost. It means you have derivatives because they help to create the financial system.
00:02:49.762 - 00:04:01.450, Speaker B: And if you look at the size of the market, of the derivative market, it's normally estimated like 20 times bigger than the world gdp, something like this. And that's for a reason, okay? Everybody has exports, derivatives, they're very big markets, the biggest market. But what is this? In a very simple way, not to bore you too much, it's the way to trade isolated risk in a market. And financial markets are big, they are full of risks and hedge funds, institutional investors, private investors, and all kind of financial institutes, they're trying to manipulate the risks, isolate the risks, set different risks together, package, repackage the risks, so on, so on, so on. And that's exactly why they need derivatives, because it's super easy way to trade any risk. And I would explain it like this. And all options, probably futures, it's a way to trade a risk future.
00:04:01.450 - 00:04:41.334, Speaker B: Basically, you trade upside and outside risk options. You only trade upside, for example, risk. And you have no downside risk cds, you have tail risk, and you trade it and so on, so on. So you can make million derivatives and million type of risks. And it's pretty cool instrument used by hedge funds a lot, because the idea of hedge funds is a fund. Smart guys sitting together and trying to make something out of unefficiencies, trying to be smarter than everybody else. And normally they do it quite well.
00:04:41.334 - 00:05:17.122, Speaker B: They fly with private jets and make lots of money. So everybody wanted to be hedge funds, or at least work in hedge funds. Now you can be a hedge fund yourself, thanks to defi, you can do all kind of things. If you understand what you're doing, you can be really successful. And we see a lot of very successful young people in crypto. But okay, I'm speaking too long about derivatives, just a spoiler to make it a little bit more live and interesting, so that derivatives is not something abstract. This is like everybody can use, they can be very simple.
00:05:17.122 - 00:06:02.654, Speaker B: And it's now accessible, thanks to crypto, thanks to DeFi. What opium protocol does is very simple. We are trying to work with any asset, is it gold price, is it oil price, is it stock price, ethereum price, bitcoin price. And we're allowed to do all kind of interesting logic on top of it, which going to make it to option, to future, to cds, to whatever you want, CDO, and that's open protocol. Basically, you select an underlying, you select type of derivative, you press the button and you have long, short positions which are directly in the markets and can be tradable, no barriers at all.
00:06:02.692 - 00:06:27.830, Speaker A: That's super cool. That's super cool. Thank you so much for this explanation. So, yeah, you very briefly already touched on kind of the answer to my next question, but yeah, just to kind of have a kind of like a whole answer to that. Why do we need decentralized derivatives? So who is using decentralized derivatives? Who will be using decentralized derivatives? Why can't they just stay centralized?
00:06:29.870 - 00:07:17.480, Speaker B: They can stay centralized and I'm sure big part of them, they will always be centralized. There is no problem with centralized boon futures. Most traded future in the world probably super liquid, so on and so on. But some of them, they're only possible in Defi because the entry barrier is very high. If you want to create what is called exotic derivative or very custom telephone derivative, you would need to spend lots of money nowadays for the lawyers, for the legal setup. And it's like millions of dollars, literally. So we have this company, for example.
00:07:17.480 - 00:07:50.574, Speaker B: They trade olive oil. And they need a future just to hedge the risk between buyers and sellers. And they had a chance to create this future on top of opium within a matter of days and no costs. Otherwise it would be economically not possible to go to investment bank and ask them to create it. So that's why we need decentralized derivatives in a traditional financial system. And that is number one. What is number two? We do need derivatives in Defi itself.
00:07:50.574 - 00:08:23.946, Speaker B: Now, Defi is growing. And as any financial system, it should be efficient. We all like it to be efficient. And derivatives are absolutely needed. And that's why they normally part of any market, any isolated market, you take any country, any market, you will see derivatives normally 100 times bigger than the spot market. Because they make spot markets more efficient and it's cool. So basically, that's how we started to do derivatives.
00:08:23.946 - 00:08:55.010, Speaker B: We thought like this. Exactly. And I thought from one side you need traditional finance. Traditional finance, they need more transparent, easier, more accessible instruments. That's one. But from another side, if decentralized finance, or we didn't call it back, then decentralized finance, but blockchain will grow, it will need these instruments as well. So we have two sites and demand coming from both sides.
00:08:55.010 - 00:08:56.440, Speaker B: And this is pretty cool.
00:08:58.350 - 00:09:14.174, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. So, to sum up, decentralized derivatives are, on the whole, cheaper than centralized derivatives. They are more accessible and they cater to defi, which centralized derivatives largely. Right, exactly.
00:09:14.372 - 00:09:38.018, Speaker B: So they're composable with Defi. And once you have a protocol which does lending, then you have borrowing and something else, then you naturally see derivatives can improve liquidity pricing, risk management a lot, so on and so on. So it does make sense to have them because it costs nothing, virtually nothing in a blockchain to settle these contracts.
00:09:38.194 - 00:10:08.750, Speaker A: Makes sense. All right, so basically, opium is a protocol where anyone can come, press a couple of buttons, create their own derivative and trade it. But on top of that, you guys are also working with a token, right? So could you please give us kind of like a brief outline on what the token is about? What are the kind of core problems that the token should be solving or helping to address, et cetera.
00:10:10.050 - 00:10:58.830, Speaker B: Sure. So first of all, it's ideal situation where you need to press a couple of buttons to create derivative. And it's a little bit of spoiler, but we want to present it this summer, opium 2.0, where literally everyone will be able to create derivatives, just as difficult as creating uniswap pool. So press a couple of buttons is done for now it's possible, but you need to be able to write at least three, five lines of very simple code. I mean most of the people who are technical, they can do it, but we want to put the entry bar to zero, like literally zero. With ui you go create stuff and that's going to be value for the community because we are building community.
00:10:58.830 - 00:11:53.802, Speaker B: I think communities are the key actually. You ask about token, you ask about derivatives, but what is in the center? It is a community, and this is the real value of the protocol of the system, because without the community you don't have a value, you don't have users, you don't have owners, you don't have developers, there is no value. And with the community, if the community is strong, then even simple things that strong community does can become valuable. Think of NFT tokens if there is a strong community and they do just an NFT token, which in my opinion is just funny, like painting behind me, behind me. It's a cool one from Wall street, by the way, 1987 classical movie about markets.
00:11:53.866 - 00:11:57.410, Speaker A: Oh nice. Do you have like an NFT version of it?
00:11:57.480 - 00:12:37.840, Speaker B: I have an NFT version of it, yes, called founder Opium NFT collection. But what I'm saying that the strong community, they can create the value out of very simple things and we community cannot create value even of strong things. And this is the basis, and I already forgot your question, I was coming a long way. But basically token is only the way instrument for community to affect the protocol and to take different part of ownership, management and so on.
00:12:39.010 - 00:12:49.010, Speaker A: Okay, so currently the way you're thinking about the token is that it should be centered around governance, right? That's the main function of the token.
00:12:49.670 - 00:13:28.062, Speaker B: That's absolutely the function, number one, as I see it, because I see that community is most important than everything else. And then of course you can make all kind of features for this token. You can make some utilities, you can make some value accrual, so on and so on. But this is all nice to have features and all the features which protocols introduce nowadays to bootstrap. Can you hear me? Yes, my video is frozen let's see.
00:13:28.116 - 00:13:33.026, Speaker A: Okay, my video seems to be what I can see you move.
00:13:33.128 - 00:14:02.662, Speaker B: I don't hear you, but let's hope that going right. So I think that nice to have features on the token is just a way to bootstrap to keep development busy. And ultimate goal is still ownership, still owning the protocol and being part of the community ownership of the protocol.
00:14:02.806 - 00:14:47.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting. So essentially you're saying that the functionality of your token revolves around governance and everything else is just nice to have feature. But I was wondering, I'm not too familiar with how the protocol works on the kind of technical level, but is there kind of zero settlement risk? Because for example, the way you could use the token is to kind of, people could stake it somewhere and if something went wrong that would be kind of remedied from the token using the value locked in the smart contract in the form of the token. So I was wondering, what do you think about this sort of mechanisms that could be implemented?
00:14:48.570 - 00:15:22.626, Speaker B: I take it very simple. It's a very good question. Thanks. But I take it very simple. So what is the chicken and egg here? First of all, the token is valuable. I'm not talking about money, but I'm talking about any value because it allows to be part of the protocol and connect the protocol to the community. And that's the value transferring to the money, how much it costs, probably you can transfer anything to money.
00:15:22.626 - 00:15:57.918, Speaker B: But first of all, it's not like financial instrument and this is very important, of course to make a disclaimer and so on. It does not guarantee you or give you a cash flow, it's not a bond, it's not a financial instrument, it's just a way to connect, again, something on a blockchain with the community. And of course it is valuable. That's the first point. That's my first point. And then of course you say, yeah, how we can measure this value. You can measure it in dollars probably yes.
00:15:57.918 - 00:16:34.902, Speaker B: You can measure it in something else probably yes. And what a lot of protocols do. They say we measure it in dollars. So there is a dollar value for token and let's develop this idea and give some features to the token, or let's utilize this idea. So let's borrow against the token, let token to be a guarantee of a certain insurance, use it as a collateral, so on and so on. But this is already the second layer. The first layer is real value, and it only has a value if it does connect a good community with good protocol.
00:16:34.902 - 00:17:28.406, Speaker B: And there is the future of the protocol if not then you can do all kind of schemes, you can do all kind of ponzenomics around your token and it may work for the short term. And even without the community you can make stupid coin and start to make panzenomics. It's going to be short term working and long term is no go. So what we are trying to do, what I believe everybody should be doing is first of all, you fix a long term setup, you understand what is the long term usage value of your token. Not talking about monetary, but about as part of the new world. So what it can be. And then you can do some tricks.
00:17:28.406 - 00:18:00.390, Speaker B: Again, people do price tricks because everybody understands the price because it's big speculative markets, especially in certain parts of the world. And it's very easy to bootstrap it. It's a free marketing if it costs something, if it let you farm something. I see even as a marketing for your protocol, it's not a financial instrument and it should not be in my opinion.
00:18:01.450 - 00:18:42.260, Speaker A: That's really interesting. Okay. You're talking about some kind of like, I don't know, it's difficult for me to define it like a token design purity, where it should be first and foremost about connecting community with the protocol and governance and the community having a say and all the other stuff that comes later or that's just features and gimmicks. Do you think that apart from governance and about connecting the protocol with the community kind of functionality, are there any other functionalities which you would view as this pure? Does that make sense? Does the question make sense?
00:18:42.790 - 00:18:49.986, Speaker B: If you rephrase it, maybe to make sure that I understand and maybe our audience understand it 100%. How do you ask it differently?
00:18:50.018 - 00:19:23.870, Speaker A: Can you? Yeah. So apart from the token being a governance token, are there any kind of baseline functionalities any other than that that you would define as baseline and not just features like the safety fund that we, or insurance that we talked about, which in your opinion are just features and governance is the main functionality. So I was just wondering if there are any other things governance.
00:19:25.110 - 00:20:01.694, Speaker B: I'm going to be very radical. I would say that. No, I think the governance to be really black and white because whatever we say, people will think about monetary value anyway. They will try to use this as a collateral, they will try to do something with it that's natural. Right? But I'm quite black and white. I say that this is the government, this is the way to be part of the community and we're going to take it as a first place always. Will it have some other functions? Can you borrow against it? Yes, sure.
00:20:01.694 - 00:20:56.718, Speaker B: But I'm trying to say maybe I'm not very good in explanation of this idea, but I really feel it strongly myself. It's kind of. You have a group of friends that's a value for you, right? Your friends. Do you want to take a us dollar measurement of it? Probably somebody can. But is it a really good idea? Can be, I don't know. But is it primary goal of your friendship to think about money and some monetary value of it? You can say, yeah, because my life is really beautiful and interesting because of all my friends and this is the value for me. And you can end up with some dollars and say, if I had no friends, I would pay a million dollars or $100 or whatever to have them.
00:20:56.718 - 00:21:39.180, Speaker B: But this is all not natural. The natural thing is really what is number first here? I think number first is this friendship is most important and the rest is just details. So with tokens is the same. I think that being part of the community, being able to connect this new type of ownership, new type of governance, which was never here before in the history of the humanity, this is real value and this is really cool. And all the use cases, I think it's second layer. I'm not saying that we don't need it. Probably it's really good when your token is a liquid, when you can also put it as a collateral and all these things.
00:21:39.180 - 00:21:48.320, Speaker B: This is probably good. But what I'm trying to say that this is first things first and all. Nice to have features second.
00:21:48.930 - 00:22:04.100, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe like one more follow up question on that. I was wondering how do you, do you think stocks are similar to governance tokens or do you think there is some kind of inherent difference between the two?
00:22:05.510 - 00:22:49.234, Speaker B: Very good question. There is no right answer. Again, my feeling that it's not because if you look at the idea like what is the stock? It's probably kind of the same. YoU have a government, you make government so and so on. But how it works right now, in reality, not in theory, not in the books, but in reality that YoU have a management board, you have directors, you have whole company with all the bureaucracy and good and bad things included. And buying Tesla stock, I'm basically not really affecting. And Tesla is very progressive company.
00:22:49.234 - 00:23:23.680, Speaker B: So buying some old school company, I'm probably just relying what it says in the regulation, relying on the effort of others and just holding it. And with government tokens is different. I truly believe it's different because we have a lot of example where individuals with very few tokens with no tokens. They still part of the community and they have great impact for the community and for the protocols products. So I hope that it's going to be different.
00:23:24.610 - 00:23:38.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a VeRY good point. Yeah, I agree with that. All right, I'm afraid we'vE RUn out of time, but yeah, that's it for today. Thank you so much Andre, for coming in and yeah, we hope to have you here again soon.
00:23:39.670 - 00:23:46.260, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Very good questions. Nobody knows the answers, but it's really interesting to figure out together.
