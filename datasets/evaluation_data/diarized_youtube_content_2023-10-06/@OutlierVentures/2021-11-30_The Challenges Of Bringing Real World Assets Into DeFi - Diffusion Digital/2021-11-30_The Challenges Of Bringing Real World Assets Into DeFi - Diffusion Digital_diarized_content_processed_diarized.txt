00:00:14.810 - 00:00:33.446, Speaker A: What has kept real world assets from coming into DeFi? Like, if we're all saying this is a thing that needs to happen, and I know that generally we can speak about it, but I was think if people can specifically pinpoint what are the problem areas that have kept these assets from being integrated into DeFi as we.
00:00:33.468 - 00:01:33.306, Speaker B: Know it today, there's a few conditions that are necessary in order to bring real world assets into DeFi. I mean, first and foremost, you just have to have the basic conditions where you have sufficient liquidity in order to provide capital to fund these assets, as well as the ubiquity of stablecoins. So I think probably up until late last year, there just wasn't the volume of stablecoins that would have been available to provide this debt that was required, nor the interest to actually lend it out through DFI. I mean, looking back to 2019, you really only had compound and maker that were doing facilitating lending, and then you had Ave come in at the start of last year. And then I'd say probably the second element is the actual framework and structuring mechanism. So you didn't have the ability to put loans on chain, and then that tokenization of loans, and also the connection and tethering it back to some kind of real world registered security. One final element would have been a viable industry to actually fund.
00:01:33.306 - 00:01:49.386, Speaker B: So you didn't have wrapped bitcoin, and again, you probably only had miners, whereas now you have other networks like Filecoin, helium, which are also sort of viable enterprises to fund generally.
00:01:49.418 - 00:02:36.314, Speaker C: The whole DeFi space is still very young. We went last year through the DeFi summer, where this whole hype around DeFi started kicking in and yields. Markets have been emerging. And since then we have been seeing continuous innovation. Protocols have been becoming more safe. TVL was growing, so did the trust in protocols, but also what we are seeing now, onboarding solutions, allowing institutional liquidity to come in either directly through DeFi protocols, like we're seeing now with some movements at Compound Avi, but also maple finance. We had been building actually the frameworks to bring actually now first institutions in and looking into real world assets.
00:02:36.314 - 00:03:25.770, Speaker C: Actually the right frameworks need still to be built in the right way in order to onboard them. I mean, Defi today, how it's working, it's more trustless, and therefore you need to provide over collateral in order to borrow funds. And in case of real world assets, your collateral is actually off chain. So you will need intervention with human beings, and that's becoming important. So you will need these frameworks like, how do you connect to off chain contracts, auditing those assets, having liquidity providers that can assess the credit worthness and establish legal frameworks. So we need first to build actually those open and transparent processes, and especially trust building frameworks in order to support the integration of real world assets.
00:03:25.850 - 00:03:28.718, Speaker A: Christy, did you have anything that you'd like to add here?
00:03:28.884 - 00:03:51.506, Speaker D: No, I agree. It's just time. I mean, we're so new in this space. Normally, a new venture in crypto has about a two to three year launch period, so it's not like we've just started. I would say that March was really when d five went mainstream. It started to leak into all of the news. It really went global.
00:03:51.506 - 00:04:42.198, Speaker D: And now we're at the point where a lot of your traditional liquidity external to crypto can't come in for, number one, education. Everyone's still learning about the space. Number two, there is a lack of regulatory framework which makes the traditional bankers, traditional infrastructure, traditional capital markets, a little skittish. And that goes hand in hand with the regulation as well, learning about what this is. And then just three, general time. People need to understand why this is a better situation or a better alternative to traditional financing, why it is superior, why it's a much more efficient kind of market. So just time, give it another year, and I think we'll be in a completely different place, certainly.
00:04:42.284 - 00:05:19.860, Speaker A: But you raised an important point about regulation, and I'm sure we'll get into that, too. For those, I know this was discussed in the prior fireside chat, but for those who saw Goldman Sachs's Defi statement yesterday and noting that a lot of the companies were not know, or you're not traditionally thought of that way, but there is seemingly now a bridge, right? People seem to want a bridge between or towards decentralized finance and these larger institutions. Lewis, would you say that bridging is important, or how much does DeFi need that traditional world to come along here?
00:05:20.710 - 00:05:56.670, Speaker E: I think the bridge is important to connect the two. Kind of following up on the previous comments. It's really where we are is just due to technology immaturity and access. Many of the technologies we use today have taken 50, 25 years to get where we are, and now we're expecting the same sort of sophistication with DFI, and it's just not possible. But I think, like Christy said, give us a year, we'll be fine. But access really is super important. I think DeFi has to become like a utility so that you take your plug, you plug it in the wall, and it just works.
00:05:56.670 - 00:06:13.090, Speaker E: We're not quite there yet. We're going to get there. But as we get there, and I think we then will establish this dramatic connection, I think, between traditional finance and the DeFi space and really allow both to benefit in amazing ways.
00:06:13.240 - 00:06:39.434, Speaker A: A question that I also have another jump ball, if any brave soul wants to take it first, is around the process of actually doing this. We're here saying that it's important to have real world assets on chain, but what are some of the technical, regulatory, business ideas, problems, obstacles that you need to go through to actually make this happen?
00:06:39.552 - 00:07:21.814, Speaker C: There are some approaches that can be conducted. The way talking fabric uses is putting actually, first on a technical level, the underlying investment deal or loan contract on the chain, staking it in the protocol through smart contracts. And this contract or document represents actually the value of the investment to finance the equipment. But mostly actually, the deal for now is happening off chain and peer to peer. So in the contract you write in, who are your investors? And the wallets are whitelisted, who are eligible actually to invest into those deals as described and set up the terms and conditions in the off chain contract.
00:07:21.942 - 00:07:41.886, Speaker A: So, Christy, as you hear all this and you think about crypto native assets, how much pain is there, real pain involved? Is it a real thing or what is the ease of which you think that these ideas, everything that these guys are working on can happen?
00:07:42.068 - 00:08:38.466, Speaker D: I mean, like I said, I think in six months the landscape will be entirely different. To Lewis's point, the mining space is already starting to consume this in the form of real world assets, financing mining equipment and financing the infrastructure and the build out. We're talking easily $20 to $30 million, sometimes for an initial loan. And the traditional process to get a loan for anything to do with crypto is very complex and it's painful. And one of the advantages that DeFi is bringing is just that frictionless loan. The other end doesn't necessarily care what you're using the money for, as long as you can commit to pay it back on a specific time. And that scares people quite a lot.
00:08:38.466 - 00:09:55.060, Speaker D: What if they use it for something horrible or something evil? But that kind of frictionless access to capital has enabled the landscape to dramatically double, actually triple in size in the last year and a half. I mean, we've seen the growth with all of the infrastructure laid out. So if we start directing that towards things like we're already seeing it in the NFT space where folks are starting to rent out nfts or experiment with nfts as representations of other physical goods or even representing different kinds of media. So what happens if we start unleashing that on other industries as well? Just access to frictionless capital to quickly and dramatically scale up businesses without the complex paperwork, without the complex frameworks that we have today, which are designed to punish and restrict? And I think that has always been the mission of crypto right, like financial freedom at a global scale. So I think, give it six months and it will be in a much better place, which.
