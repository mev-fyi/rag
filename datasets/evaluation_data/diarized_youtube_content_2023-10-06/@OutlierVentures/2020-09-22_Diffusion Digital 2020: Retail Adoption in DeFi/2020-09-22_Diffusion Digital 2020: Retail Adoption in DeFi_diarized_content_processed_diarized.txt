00:00:10.570 - 00:00:43.350, Speaker A: Great. So welcome, everyone. This is a panel on retail adoption in Defi. I'm the moderator, Camilla Russo. I'm the author of the infinite machine, the first book on the history of Ethereum, and the founder of the Defiant, a content platform focusing on decentralized finance. We have here today our wonderful panelist, Felix Feng. He's co founder and CEO of Set Protocol, a non custodial platform which automates crypto trading strategies.
00:00:43.350 - 00:01:29.610, Speaker A: Dan Dene, he's CEO of Kitango, a broker helping retail investors access Defi army Ross, chief blockchain scientist at etoro, a crypto trading platform. And Simon Taylor, co founder and head of ventures at eleven FS, which builds digital financial services. So welcome, everyone, to start. I want to start with Felix and Dan. If you can just kind of ground us all and put us in the same page and talk about the status right now in DeFi, who are actually the users. Felix, do you want to start?
00:01:29.760 - 00:02:09.158, Speaker B: Sure. That's a really good question. If you really look at DeFi today, you have to think about the industry landscape and also technology and what enables. So DeFi, on the most part, is on Ethereum today. And if you want to use Ethereum, you need to have metamask, you need to have a number of pretty sophisticated tools to deal with private keys and also the pay gas. So in recent times, in the beginning of the year, Ethereum was pretty cheap to use, and we have an explosion of new financial services that people are interested in. But recently, gas prices have gone up a lot, so it started pricing a.
00:02:09.164 - 00:02:09.734, Speaker C: Lot of people out.
00:02:09.772 - 00:03:03.990, Speaker B: So essentially, Ethereum is currently used by, I guess, a number of insiders. It can range from 5000 to 50,000 users, depending on what types of metrics that you want to include. And with Ethereum gas prices going up a lot, it may cost up to $10 to complete a transaction. So I think that Ethereum is starting and usage of Defi is expanding as it starts to be offered. On crypto trading platforms such as exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase and ETor are listing some of these new assets that people are interested in. There are new trends that are very interesting that people want to get into, such as yield farming, which are offering apys that can't be rivaled anywhere else in the traditional financial world. So I think that a lot of things have changed since then, and we're pretty excited to help offer products that make it a lot easier for users.
00:03:03.990 - 00:03:24.438, Speaker B: One thing that we did launch yesterday was a DFI index, which is a single token that tracks the top ten DFI tokens by market cap. And we're hoping that this is something that can enable a lot more retail, outside of the 5000 that exist today, to start participating and getting exposure to the upside.
00:03:24.614 - 00:03:52.134, Speaker A: Right. And just on the DFI index, you'll be happy to hear. My brother had been looking to invest in DeFi for the first time, and I told him about the index and he finally did it and took the first step into getting into. Yeah, Dan, do you want to kind of compliment that? What are you seeing for sure?
00:03:52.172 - 00:04:50.810, Speaker D: Yes, I think that DeFI is really supposed to be inclusive and it was supposed to be about financial freedom. Those are some of the things you mentioned in your book, which I love. But unfortunately, in its current state, it's only like, beyond very basic products, the discovery and investment products in DFI are just way too complicated for retail investors. And that's the reason the industry is completely dominated by professional traders. If you look at the data, you can see that, like, less than 500 wallets sold, more than 90% of all DeFi tokens together. So it's really exclusive, which I feel like is kind of a paradox. And we're trying to change this, specifically focusing on the discovery process and the education.
00:04:50.810 - 00:05:09.390, Speaker D: So if somebody is looking for a good way to enter deep DeFi and learn about things like liquidity pools or yield farming, we want to be a platform that introduce this kind of products to retail investors to make it a bit more inclusive.
00:05:09.890 - 00:05:36.038, Speaker A: Great. And this question is for everyone, and Dan and Felix kind of touched on this already. But to you, what are some of the main barriers for retail and mainstream users to start using Defi? What's preventing more mainstream adoption? Maybe. Omri, do you want to start with this one?
00:05:36.124 - 00:06:26.246, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. I think one of the nice things, just also to mention in terms of what you said before about eToro, we have more than 30 million registered users, and while we do crypto, we actually do much more than that. Actually, a minor part of our platform is offering that. But the experience of dollar to dollar, or your local currency to your local currency, I think is missing because I don't believe personally that everybody want to deal with their private keys. Now, I know that may be controversial, especially in early adopters, and I can sometimes contradict myself on a personal level with my holding, but at the same time, it would make a lot of sense to get really adoption. To allow people to just transfer on normal Fias and get exposure to these things is one of the things we can offer in platforms like etoro and alike. Because you can actually deposit dollars and get exposure to things.
00:06:26.246 - 00:07:19.754, Speaker E: But then on the other side is, how do you work with the regulations? Because we are sort of regulated entity and we want to offer a lot of these exciting products to our clients. And as was actually mentioned by both FedEx and Dan, I fully agree that offering high returns on dollars today is a killer product. I mean, live aside, all of the funky sushi, sashimi, whatever, there is stuff happening that you can still deal and create double digit percent on dollars. I'm not speaking about the highest sort of complex product. And I think this is a really necessary product to offer to everybody. And then the question one is KYC, can we actually offer KYC on this product and make sure that we are integrated to the rules and regulation in the world? And the second one is, how can we explain it to regulators? How can we tell the regulators we build a product that is based like this and like that? And these are the risks. And I think we're actually working hard on that.
00:07:19.754 - 00:07:22.860, Speaker E: But I think this is kind of some of the challenges on our side.
00:07:24.030 - 00:07:35.390, Speaker A: Yeah, KYC regulation, making sure you're goes, it doesn't really jibe with all of the DeFi platforms. So I can see how that's complicated.
00:07:35.970 - 00:07:44.142, Speaker E: I think it has a lot of potential because I think it can be done. We can work on new kinds of identity and I think I would love to see more of.
00:07:44.196 - 00:07:44.800, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:07:45.170 - 00:07:50.974, Speaker A: Yeah, no, for sure. Yes. Simon, what do you think about the barriers to get to DeFi?
00:07:51.102 - 00:08:41.410, Speaker C: Yes, I think the biggest barrier is most people have never heard of it. As was being said, I think by Dan, it's niche, and it might not be to this audience, but to most of the people you see walking on the street, they've never heard of the thing. So there's an awareness problem number one. Number two is what problem does it solve for people? 5% to 12% APY? That sounds great, but do they actually have enough understanding? And again, as I think Dan said, and everybody's echoed here, to really know what that means, you can make the most slick experience in the world so that somebody could trip up and fall and end up in DFI, but they just don't understand it. And I think from, to take a regulator's perspective, the risks haven't really been through a cycle yet. The smart contract risks, some of the underlying risks around these, I know a lot of those apys that are quoted have balanced their risk. They're insuring, they're doing lots of clever things.
00:08:41.410 - 00:09:20.590, Speaker C: But at the same time, when a consumer buys an investment product, there's an element of risk, and yet consumers still don't buy them and we don't quote them in APY. So a fund that returns market 7% year on year or even after fees 5% year on year, is a great place for consumers to be diversified into. And most retail doesn't do it. They just go for a bank account because it's safe and it's the equivalent of money under the mattress. So there's a consumer psychology thing that we miss. And actually I don't think for 80% of the market even having DFI is going to be something that they're going to get into. For the 20% that think about their savings and investments differently, that's the space where you might have more of an opportunity.
00:09:20.590 - 00:10:03.210, Speaker C: And I find it interesting that fidelity are probably one of the organizations that are coming in from incumbents down. And then you got folks like etoro and others coming from the challenger space up and making that something that makes sense to a retail customer. And it's that retail customer that's probably more likely to get adoption on one side. But then there's the adoption nobody talks about, which is why does the consumer even need to see anything? If your pension fund is holding bitcoin, you don't know that you're holding bitcoin. It's just part of an asset diversification strategy. And for most people that's fine. And I think it was said earlier that around private keys and be your own bank is kind of the kind of originating view of a lot of the crypto space.
00:10:03.210 - 00:10:18.820, Speaker C: Most retail customers don't want to be their own bank. They don't want to deal with the Opsec overhead. And you've got a fundamental trade off between OPSeC and ease of use. And I don't know that we necessarily have to make it just purely easy to use. I think there are abstractions that we can learn from that work. Well.
00:10:22.070 - 00:11:05.594, Speaker A: Really interesting points of view. Do people even want this? Most people don't even know that DeFi exists. And then those who maybe will learn about it. Will the main value propositions of DeFi be attractive enough? Felix, I'm interested in kind of your view on this, and kind of set has some of these elements. It's noncustodial. People are holding their own keys, I guess, of the company. Sierra, yours is kind of the most directly in DeFi.
00:11:05.594 - 00:11:07.470, Speaker A: So what are your thoughts?
00:11:08.610 - 00:12:13.618, Speaker B: Yeah, at the end of the day, people in retail want to use DeFi because of the value proposition that it offers and the ease of being able to get into the product. And DeFi in general has a really great value proposition at the moment, which is you're able to get outsized returns, maybe double or even triple digit returns on the US dollar or some sort of more volatile asset. And I think that's something that you can't really get elsewhere. It also enables people to invest in new technologies, which is traditionally gated by venture capitalists or certain high net worth individuals. This has really started to democratize things for people, which is why there was so much activity in 2017, 2018 regarding kind of icos. The whole world was going crazy about it, and I think that for two years, we had a bear market where that activity went away, a large part due to regulations and securities laws. But today, there's a new way for kind of new ecosystem to be built and a lot of people to start investing.
00:12:13.618 - 00:13:00.818, Speaker B: So I think that people are really excited about this, and I think we've seen a lot of people get quite wealthy recently with the Wifi and yearn related kind of episode, and a lot of people are really excited about the opportunity to do that. For example, I'd heard anecdotes that in, like, there's nothing really to in South Korea, that is, half of the white collared workers actually owned crypto, and that's because there are just no alternative asset classes to get into. Real estate is way too expensive. Kind of. The stock market wasn't really going anywhere. So crypto was really kind of that one area where you can kind of put capital into and hope that it would generate significant return. So in the context of set, I think that a lot of people are really interested in Defi.
00:13:00.818 - 00:13:29.982, Speaker B: It's just that it's a really complicated world. There's so many different assets, and some of them are called foods, some of them are called serious names. You don't know the difference between those that are safe and those are not. And I think that diversification is a nice way for someone who doesn't want to do the research to get exposure. They've maybe heard of Defi before. They heard about it in news, they heard about it from a friend, but they don't know anything else, but they've heard good things and they kind of want exposure to it. And I think that an index product is the first path there.
00:13:29.982 - 00:14:20.334, Speaker B: But if people want to go a bit deeper, they can research individual assets and buy them an exchange like binance or a Dex, like uniswap. Or they can actually, or there's other kind of products that make yield farming or other things a lot easier, which we're pretty excited about too. So I think that it really is about starting somewhere and making it that as easy as possible because the value proposition is there and then users eventually graduating and leveling up into offering using more sophisticated products. To summarize, I think that the yield opportunities that you can get are quite differentiated. I think that because people don't understand the risks involved, or people outside of crypto, outside Defi who don't understand that there is asymmetric kind of opportunity there for people who do want to dig in.
00:14:20.532 - 00:15:15.874, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. I agree that there's interest in this more open financial system. I think Simon mentioned bitcoin in pension funds and people don't need to see it, but in maybe places outside of the developed world, people just don't have that much access to financial services and trusted firms to handle their money. So I think it is exciting to have a more open financial system. And I guess the challenge is how to get people to actually start interacting with it, because just getting there is hard. But once you're in there, the experience is much easier than most fintechs, I think. Yeah.
00:15:15.874 - 00:15:19.970, Speaker A: Dan, what are your thoughts on some of the barriers?
00:15:20.950 - 00:16:49.710, Speaker D: So I agree with all of the comments, but I think I like the perspective of looking outside of the blockchain crypto world. How do we attract users into that world? But honestly, I think there's a bigger problem that is way closer to us in DeFi. That's like, how do we get crypto people into DFI? And if you look at the entire market cap of crypto assets, you can see that almost 95% of all crypto assets are still ideal, generating zero interest. And that's kind of crazy. Like, if you compare it to the fiat world, 93% of all Americans have a saving account that bears interest. So I think really the immediate question is, how do we get crypto people to invest in defi? I feel like from my personal experience, and I'm sure everybody here on the panel get the same, we all have this friend who already holds some bitcoin or some stellar or whatever, and they're interested, how do I learn about these crazy new tools? How do I learn about amms, about till farming, about tools like set protocol and the indexes? And I feel like the discovery process and the UX for the retail investor could be greatly improved. I feel like that's a major barrier.
00:16:50.450 - 00:17:21.050, Speaker A: And I wanted to ask you then about this discovery process and within this process, this spectrum of decentralization within defi itself. You have the fully kind of more decentralized protocols and the more centralized platforms. How do you kind of think retail and outsiders can go about finding the right product in this spectrum?
00:17:27.150 - 00:18:21.562, Speaker C: Yeah, I was just going to say very quickly, again, I'm going to reiterate, I don't think most retail cares, like how decentralized something is or isn't. And actually, to Felix's point, there are a bunch of people who care about the yield. And to Dan's point, how do you attract the crypto people to. That is a much bigger question, and I think a much more interesting one. If you look at the ven diagram of the amount of users, coinbase or a kraken or somebody along those lines has in the west, or a binance has, how come they're using that, but they're not in this space yet? And that's a really good question that I think needs to be addressed, which is, what are your concentric circles of adoption? Because if you can go beyond super enthusiasts, I would put it to you that a lot of the yield you're seeing is because it's so small, and you saw that in the ridiculously early days of crypto as well. As this thing gets bigger, that superpower goes away. So what problem does it solve? You're getting this yield right now because very few people are doing it.
00:18:21.562 - 00:18:24.730, Speaker C: Then what? And I think that question needs to be answered.
00:18:26.450 - 00:18:29.470, Speaker A: Yeah, amri, do you want to try answering that?
00:18:29.540 - 00:19:04.114, Speaker E: Yeah, not answering it, but I want to say that I think something that I would like to hear more, actually, in the crypto community is about sustainability of these models, because I'm way more excited about protocols and I'm a geek as hell, even though I'm working for a different company. Right. I work as a professor in university, teaching the infrastructure. Right. But what get me excited is stuff that I consider is sustainable and going to build a better future. Offering more to retail clients, but to everybody, opening the markets that are today are closed and not stuff that just create three digit returns. So I would actually be controversial.
00:19:04.114 - 00:19:39.460, Speaker E: Say and say could set protocol, offer us a portfolio of stuff. It does simplify things, but it doesn't solve the immediate and most important problems. I'm excited. When I first learned about Dai and I work about it with Runa, I thought, this is amazing product. It's creating something that I can see its value. With compound and avid that offer us some platform to lending, I can also see its value, but I would like to see much more work on sustainable growing of finance rather than farming some vegetables. I think I would love to see more movement in our community towards the discussion because it has much more value.
00:19:42.790 - 00:20:02.570, Speaker A: And why do you think we were talking about getting crypto people more interested in defi? Do you think the more kind of non defi crypto investment firms and platforms like Ethero have a role there? Maybe that can serve as a bridge.
00:20:03.470 - 00:20:55.322, Speaker E: I hope so. I mean, I think we can offer product, again, it's more difficult for regulation just to be very open about it because how do you actually explain this product? But I think that it is, and this is what we're trying to do. It also goes back to many of the points that Simon did trying to simplify product. If it's following some investment, sort of popular investment, is it to offer something like set protocol, but in a way more Lehman terms and simple terms, and maybe not go for the triple digit or second digit sort of high second digit, but something lower that is still more sustainable. Because in the end it's risk return. And if you say I hold a lot of it in cash and some portion of it in a very risky asset, but that can create a high return, that you can suggest a product with some reasonable return and some reasonable risk. And I think if you get this product, it actually require a lot of risk management into it.
00:20:55.322 - 00:21:06.270, Speaker E: But you place it as a vanilla, simple product. For someone to say high returning yield dollars based on Defi, that will be cool. And I think this is sustainable also. But it's longer discussion.
00:21:06.870 - 00:21:22.690, Speaker A: Simon, do you see traditional financial firms offering this product at some point, like some sort of vanilla product to get retail into defi, define traditional.
00:21:22.770 - 00:21:57.342, Speaker C: Right. Because there are companies that are approaching 15 years old, 20 years old, that might be incumbents now. I mean, etoro has been around for a few years and it's one of the OG fintechs, but it's heading towards that PayPal sort of space where it's fairly well established. So does that count? Is that established? Well, yeah, they're regulated. They've been around for a long time. I think what you mean by that is will a bank do it? And the answer is they'll be the last to do it. You might find some very small banks do it in the US because there are just so many of them.
00:21:57.342 - 00:22:17.590, Speaker C: And actually that could be interesting. I know, in fact, of a few that are starting to do interesting things. Bitcoin jib with a capital p is seen by regulators now as like old hat. Yeah, we understand how to regulate that. It kind of makes sense to us. There's foldap and there's a few others that are looking at bitcoin rewards and that sort of stuff. For the enthusiast, there is a niche market for that sort of thing.
00:22:17.590 - 00:23:00.260, Speaker C: But again, I would point at your fidelity and that sort of space as being an area where it comes down, your e trades and your schwabs as being another space to look at. And then what's fintech going to do that comes up from it. But I think there's so much more value that fintech space can bring. If I look at Robinhood and if I look at Revolut and those sorts of guys, that's your perfect sweet spot for middle ground. Those people have a brand that extends beyond the crypto space and they have trust for doing more. If they start doing Defi, I think you've really got something. And I know there's a lot of smart people in those organizations that would love to, but there's a lot of regulatory questions that we have to answer first, which is what actually are the underlying risks here.
00:23:00.260 - 00:23:34.654, Speaker C: I think if you go down the rabbit hole far enough, you might find six people that really can explain all of the risks in Defi. And I think most people go, I kind of get this bit. So I'm trading and then all of this is just all new and it's all happening so fast. So that's going to be hard to get to that point. So to the point that I think Ombre made, you might be able to, by de risking it significantly, get it into some mainstream fintech apps. You might get some bigger, older brands that have been out there, start to dabble in that after a little while. But I'd look to Robinhood, Revolut, and those guys as being the people most likely to do it first.
00:23:34.772 - 00:24:23.840, Speaker A: From a mainstream consumer side, really interesting points. Yeah, I agree that that kind of fintech pocket is kind of in the sweet spot to start innovating in this space. If they can get over that regulatory minefield, I guess I think we need to start wrapping up. But just to finish off, if you can, each name kind of one solution you'd like to see in the next year, which would enable greater retail adoption to Defi, or if you even think it's necessary to have more retail adoption in Defi. Who wants to start? Dan? I'll pick on.
00:24:24.610 - 00:24:44.120, Speaker D: Okay. Okay. My take is about discovery. I think discovery and education are key, and I'm going to cheat and add another one. I think aggregate, those have a big room to play in. Order to combat the high gas prices. I think those two are super important.
00:24:46.330 - 00:24:49.058, Speaker A: Amri, do you want to say your solution?
00:24:49.154 - 00:25:06.350, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll bore everybody and say KYC. I would really love to see a decentralized KYC solution that can get sort of the decentralized finance in line with the normal finance and offering this product without being exposed to following against some regulations. Sorry for being blind.
00:25:07.570 - 00:25:11.150, Speaker A: No, I agree. Felix?
00:25:15.410 - 00:25:58.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with the on ramps is definitely something that could be helpful and also some way to reduce gas costs, whether it's l two that everybody moves to or something where you can batch transactions and have each individual user pay less. So I think that gas costs are oftentimes a barrier to entry right now, especially if guay is 300 to 400 or higher, it can cost even $20 or $30 to do a transaction on uniswap. And that's even greater than what traditional brokerages are charging, and let alone Robin Hood, where all trades are free. So I think that's kind of where we need to get to, is getting back to very low transaction fee.
00:25:58.930 - 00:26:00.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:26:00.388 - 00:26:25.954, Speaker C: I think we just need ten years, 2008 to 2018. It took a while, right? And I think part of what got you there is people being willing to compromise on the regulation side. And I think it's broader than KYC. It's risk. And sometimes managing risk doesn't feel very gung ho. But you know what? If you really believe in creating a better financial system, then recognize that you're not going to remove risk. You haven't reinvented the laws of the universe.
00:26:25.954 - 00:26:59.178, Speaker C: You haven't reinvented physics. Money will still work in certain ways. You've reinvented how it can move, but not the psychological concepts and construct of it. So really, let's get mature about risk. Let's think about how the great engineers and the brilliant minds in this space can bake in some of those solutions beyond KYC, into transaction monitoring, into all the things that we want to prevent and helping people understand that. That, I think, is going to be what gets really exciting. I think what Coinbase did is start that journey, and then other people picked up on the baton with the original crypto space.
00:26:59.178 - 00:27:06.530, Speaker C: And I know people like Felix and others are trying to now do that in Defi, so I think it's just a natural evolution. So let's give it a decade.
00:27:07.930 - 00:27:17.000, Speaker A: I love it. All right, well, thanks, everyone. This was such an interesting discussion. Great chatting and thanks for everyone watching.
00:27:18.490 - 00:27:19.830, Speaker C: Thank you, Camilla. Great job.
00:27:19.900 - 00:27:20.978, Speaker E: Thank you, Kanye.
00:27:21.154 - 00:27:22.130, Speaker D: Thank you, Camilla.
