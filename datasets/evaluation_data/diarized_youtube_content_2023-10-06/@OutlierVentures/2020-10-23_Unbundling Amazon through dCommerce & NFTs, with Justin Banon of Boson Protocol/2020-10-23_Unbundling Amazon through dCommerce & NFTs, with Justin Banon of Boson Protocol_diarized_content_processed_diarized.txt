00:00:47.790 - 00:00:48.202, Speaker B: Today.
00:00:48.256 - 00:00:52.842, Speaker A: I'm really happy to welcome co founder of Bosom Protocol, Justin Bannon. Welcome Justin.
00:00:52.906 - 00:00:55.726, Speaker B: Thanks Jamie. And it's a privilege to be here.
00:00:55.828 - 00:01:39.158, Speaker A: So you describe yourself as working on bridging the virtual to the physical world, in particular for web three. Boson Protocol is a web three primitive. It solves the physical asset oracle problem using stateful nfts based on a dynamic game, which obviously is a mouthful. So we're going to unpack exactly what we mean by that a little bit later. A more simple way of describing it is you're connecting smart contracts to real world commerce and its data. So I actually got to know you pretty well through base camp, the Outlier Ventures accelerator. You were in the winter 2019 cohort.
00:01:39.158 - 00:02:29.850, Speaker A: So there's some reasons why I think it's timely to get you on the show. So nfts are hot now. Non fungible tokens are hot now. As Rohan, the founder of Dapper Lab said, you realize the full or true potential of nfts when you consider that almost everything in your life is non fungible rather than fungible. So some of the few things that are fungible include currency, money and some commodities, but pretty much everything else is non fungible. It's not interchangeable at a kind of atomic level. So boson solves the fundamental problem that I think everybody first asks when they begin to wrestle with the concept of NFTs in the context of digital to physical transactions.
00:02:29.850 - 00:04:03.210, Speaker A: So just the other day I was talking to a friend and he was kind of getting his head around nfts in a purely digital sense. But the minute that he kind of stumbled across this question of, well, how could I use an NFT to redeem a physical good or service he just couldn't buy, how that could be solved. Now, at boson, you kind of solved that problem, and we're going to get into this journey about how you've got there. At least you found a viable workaround, and I think it's informative for people to understand why somebody like you and your co founder might be the people to kind of have solved this. So you're quite a unique beast in that you're an ex physicist, you're not a coder, but you're a hardcore math guy, quite academic, you're used to solving complex theoretical problems. But unusually, you've also really earned your stripes in the business world previously, blitzcaling the priority pass group into a billion dollar per annum digital platform and transforming that industry, which was a loyalty points business in a traditional sense. So to give some context to your background, as I said, you've got a physics degree from Peel College, actually two masters that you've managed to somehow do in your evenings, one from UCL in digital business and innovation, kind of really focusing on platform and network effects, and the other which is an integral part of your kind of founder story.
00:04:03.210 - 00:05:32.070, Speaker A: With Boson, a digital currency masters from the University of Nicosia, you've also founded a couple of startups in your early 20s, including a video production company. But I guess most relevant to what we're going to talk about today was when you joined Priority Pass group in 2006 as operations director, but quickly grew to become divisional MD for that group. And you were there for over twelve years, until relatively recently, 2018. So for the listeners to understand, Priority Pass was a company which enabled access to airport lounges via paper and plastic vouchers at the time when you joined. But as I said, you blitzcaled that from 50 million to a billion dollar company per annum in revenue, but also helped it undergo a digital transformation. So working with large brands and partners like Mastercard, Visa, Amex, Diners, as well as 1400 banks and credit cards worldwide, and it was there that you, I guess, first began to explore how you could effectively digitize a process, as you describe it, find a digitally native form factor for that industry, which of course was digital and mobile vouchers. And that really not just transformed priority pass, but also the wider industry.
00:05:32.070 - 00:05:59.534, Speaker A: Then in 2019, you co founded Boson. And I believe that the genesis story of that is that you met Gregor Barosa, your co founder, who was a lecturer, one of the lecturers at the masters where you were doing the digital currency initiative. Could you tell us a little bit about that meeting and then how that evolved into what boson is today?
00:05:59.652 - 00:06:34.780, Speaker B: Well, as you've highlighted, yeah, I'm not a coder, but I took a couple of technical modules a to kind of COVID that area, but also to find a tech co founder for this idea that I had. And yeah, Gregor and I would stay on after class and just discuss not just his lectures, but also what blockchain means, what it enables. And very quickly we discussed my idea and just joined up together and been working on it ever since. Yeah.
00:06:37.710 - 00:06:43.066, Speaker A: So what was the idea, what was the insight that led to Boson protocol?
00:06:43.178 - 00:07:25.722, Speaker B: The insight was in the same way as when I was at priority pass. I recognized that with the advent of mobile and digital, people would still want to access the same products and services as they were accessing currently via paper and plastic vouchers, but in a form factor that was native to this new kind of digital and mobile channel. And so with crypto, you can see exactly the same sort of situation. As crypto emerges as this new form factor, then crypto businesses and their customers are going to want to access real world products and services, but do that in a crypto native way.
00:07:25.856 - 00:07:32.014, Speaker A: And so this is what you describe as solving the physical asset oracle problem.
00:07:32.132 - 00:08:21.646, Speaker B: Yeah. The description of the problem as a physical asset oracle problem comes from a post from Jimmy Song, where he highlights the problem as an example of why only bitcoin is a kind of valid sort of cryptocurrency. But actually the problem is if I wanted to buy your car, Jamie, and you tokenized that car and you represented it as a token, and I went and I brought that token from you, that's great, but how can I guarantee or have any insurances that once I'm in possession of that token that I will actually receive the car as well? And that is the problem that we address and have a solution, at least a very effective workaround for.
00:08:21.828 - 00:08:44.386, Speaker A: So I believe after you met Gregor during the course, you actually went off and began doing some consulting both together and kind of alongside one another. And it was in these engagements where you really began to refine different approaches to how you might solve for this problem. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?
00:08:44.488 - 00:09:36.466, Speaker B: Yeah, Gregor and I, we worked for a company called Dexfrait, which is a decentralized logistics platform. So we're doing some really interesting things. So we were tokenizing freight invoices and using centrifuge Tin lake, and then using those nfts then to be collateral within multicolateral Dai. We were also working on early ocean protocol, data marketplaces integrations. But the other project which is most relevant for boson is that we were looking to, well, Dex freight rewards its users. So if you think about truckers on the platform, they arrive on time, they deliver to quality, et cetera. And it was looking to reward the users with tokens.
00:09:36.466 - 00:11:11.314, Speaker B: Now, tokens don't mean a lot to truckers. What they would like are kind of like real world things. And so we had an early version of Boson protocol, which enabled truck drivers to take the tokens that they obtained from Dex freight and swap those tokens for blockchain vouchers that could then be redeemed for real world products and services. Initially, we were using the Dharma protocol architecture, which involves some trusted keepers, or arbitrators, if you like, so that in the event of any disputes or reversals, you would have to revert to an arbitrator, which is a pretty standard set up with protocols and projects such as open bazaar. But what we quickly realized is if you're plugging in a decentralized network into a protocol like boson that requires arbitration, well, the cost and the friction of that really kind of breaks that process. You just can't afford to do it. So I kind of put my physics hat on and said, okay, well, can we eliminate arbitration? Is it kind of theoretically impossible? And to what degree? If we can't eliminate it, to what degree could we minimize arbitration? That's the problem that we really started to look at.
00:11:11.314 - 00:12:02.180, Speaker B: And by the time we got accepted to base camp, I had a very strong intuition that we had something quite significant in terms of being able to remove this cost and friction and have what we were kind of referring to as this decentralized autonomous commerce. And I think probably day one, Jamie mentioned that to you, and you immediately said, well, that's a very bold claim, we need to establish it. And so I was introduced to Dr. Zanet Gertrudge, who is a researcher in behavioral economics and game theory at Imperial College. And I know, and as part of the outlier team as well. And Zanep is very, very smart and one of the best in the industry there. And her initial thoughts were, I don't think that's possible.
00:12:02.180 - 00:13:03.286, Speaker B: So we sat down, and after about 2 hours, Zanep said, well, I think you may have something, but I'm going to need to work on it. And we worked on it over the coming weeks, and within a month or so, Zanep joined as an advisor and has been working with us to develop that ever since. A similar story with Trent McConaughey. I sort of acquainted with Trent previously, but at diffusion in 2019 in Berlin, we sat down and went through, I sort of took Trent through my deck, and Trent said, I don't want to see the marketing, show me the mechanism. Typically Trent. And we went through, and he ah, okay, so you're not trying to tokenize the thing, know, it's a kind of futures contract. And that's exactly the approach that we've know, just to kind of complete that.
00:13:03.286 - 00:13:42.930, Speaker B: Similarly, we presented at London earlier this year in February, and Zargam, who had worked on a couple of projects with kind of consulting also, you know, I think you've got this issue, this issue he then joined as an advisor. And so now we've refined the protocol to where we feel it's probably got to a point where you get diminishing returns and there's not that much incentive to evolve it any further. That said, it is an evolving, complex system, and we're due to launch a prototype of that core mechanism within the next couple of weeks.
00:13:43.080 - 00:14:25.602, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean, that's an interesting journey, almost a year long period of r d to kind of maybe just add some color to some of the people that you mentioned there. So Trent McConaughey of ocean protocol, Michael Zargam of block science. Block science is a big crypto economics design consultancy, and you referenced diffusion. Diffusions. Actually, the kind of virtual conference was now virtual conference. It used to be a physical conference that we would do each year with the various portfolios. So it's a great advert, I guess, to see how a lot of that stuff's come together now if we go into this physical asset problem.
00:14:25.602 - 00:15:30.370, Speaker A: So, as you said, jimmy Song almost used it as a dismissive, and it's kind of dismissive towards things like nfts or just the idea of alternative cryptocurrencies. And this is a theme, actually, that's come up again just in the last week with people like Peter McCormack of what bitcoin did next. I love Peter. I actually think he's largely just being on brand by being dismissive of nfts than necessarily being totally convinced of it himself. But that said, it is used as a dismissive by bitcoin maximalists towards nfts. And in the sense that they know it's a problem that is impossible to completely solve for. But I think what's interesting here is that you believe there is a workaround to significantly reduce the requirement for arbitration.
00:15:30.370 - 00:16:27.250, Speaker A: And effectively that's, I guess, where boson focuses. Right. If you think about decentralized commerce, e commerce in the context of e commerce, and how that then connects to the physical world, this is something that fundamentally has to be solved for, and you want to be able to solve for arbitration of disputes, but also reversals. I know reversals is another key part. It's not just disputes, but it's presumably the reversal of the transaction itself, should it not be properly fulfilled. And so really, this is, how do you fulfill, what does fulfillment look like in the context of ecommerce? So could you tell us a little bit about this workaround? I believe you kind of describe it as a novel game. How does this solve for the problem?
00:16:27.420 - 00:17:36.346, Speaker B: So, as I mentioned, yeah, it's a type of futures contract, or a promise, if you like, where essentially the buyer and seller make deposits as commitments to proceed with an exchange transaction to an agreed upon quality. And in addition, the buyer's payment amount is also locked up. So let's deal with those two things separately. I guess a good starting point would be this problem is partially solved. If you want to book an expensive restaurant, it's normal to have to put a deposit on your credit card. And if you don't turn up that you lose that it's non refundable. So in a very kind of narrow way, that is the type of concept upon which boson builds, except that we take these two sided deposits and then those deposits are in a game which is complex enough to handle the disputes and provide incentives for both parties to be incentivized to go through with equality, redemption.
00:17:36.346 - 00:18:21.418, Speaker B: But on the other hand, it's simple enough to be kind of operationalized. Now, it's a complex system, and as Zargam described it, it's going to have boundaries where it's going to bounce around within a zone and it might hit a boundary. And initially we may have arbitration and we will push it back into that zone and we may add some algorithmic triage and extend the algorithm. And over time, then it evolves further and further and further. Now, this is what it's done anyway during our r and d process. So that's sort of the core algorithm. Then we have.
00:18:21.418 - 00:18:58.440, Speaker B: The other one is the notion of sort of practical atomicity, which is one of these kind of fundamental arguments that you can't have this hard link between the physical and digital. Well, that's solved practically. If you go into Starbucks and you ask for a coffee, the barrister could take your money and not give you a coffee. I mean, that's entirely possible. But you accept that level of atomicity, and that kind of cash level of practical atomicity is again the threshold that we hold boson to.
00:18:58.750 - 00:19:02.906, Speaker A: So that's a theory. Can you walk us through practically how that works?
00:19:03.088 - 00:20:10.126, Speaker B: Sure. So Boson itself is a modular component, but within boson are a number of nested modular components, if you like, so firstly, we represent these promises as stateful. Sure, you know, NFT, non fungible token, but with us they're stateful in that they move from state to state. So you have a state where firstly they're offered, then there is a commitment that is made, then they can be redeemed, a complaint can be made, a complaint can be admitted, et cetera. So these nfts then flow around a dynamic game. And this dynamic game within Boson's core exchange mechanism is a delicate balance with it being sufficiently complex to manage the exchange dispute mediations and reversals, but simple enough to be governed by a game. We then have a token model which we borrowed from ocean protocol for a curated proofs market.
00:20:10.126 - 00:20:59.854, Speaker B: And this model curates vouchers or inventory, which has high quality and quantity. So vouchers, which people use and are popular and which people like they're at high quality, are also curated using that token model. But again, that's modular. We could, and we constantly look and review that. There could be a separate module there. And then in addition, we integrate with a web three data marketplace and our chosen provider, of course, is ocean protocol. And I think we can come on to those two components of boson protocol in terms of coordinating transactions and commerce data.
00:20:59.854 - 00:21:00.206, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:00.228 - 00:21:28.070, Speaker A: So you've used this term ecommerce, decentralized commerce, maybe before we go into its stack, because again, I've heard you talk about a ecommerce stack. Why is ecommerce important? Why is it important? We have a distinction between commerce as it is today and ecommerce. And what is the role of boson protocol within it? What's its kind of mission?
00:21:28.510 - 00:22:31.550, Speaker B: Okay, sure. I'll address that question at two levels, if you like. There's a sort of operational level which is free, low trust, low cost, low friction is different. We've seen that whether it's email or when you implement a solution that is free and low cost, it's different. And so enabling commerce over the Internet without intermediaries, but with this minimized arbitration, low cost and friction is fundamentally different and is going to enable new use cases and a proliferation of commerce that has previously been blocked, if you like, by cost and friction. So that's kind of the operational argument. Also, if you want to take on a beast like Amazon, which is super vertically integrated, a lot of people think, look, it's impossible for a protocol to take on Amazon.
00:22:31.550 - 00:23:13.020, Speaker B: I'm actually of the view, which many share, that by having a stack and an ecosystem of composable specialist protocols, each of these optimizing for efficiencies and attacking different parts of the value chain, but in combination or aggregate, then these can be a real challenger, first slowly, but then all at once. And I think for a large kind of whale, if you like, like Amazon, it's very difficult to compete against a sort of a swarm of specialist protocols, each attacking a point in your value chain, but also working together in a composable way.
00:23:13.390 - 00:23:18.810, Speaker A: So is this disruptive or transformative or something in the middle?
00:23:18.880 - 00:24:21.658, Speaker B: It's super disruptive. Previously, I transformed priority pass digitally, but the underlying business logic, the logic of centralized extraction, if you like, remained the same, whereas decentralized protocols remove this logic of extraction and replace it with a more fair and equitable logic and a design to prevent capture by a centralized entity. So it would be very difficult to conceive of a centralized entity making that move, although I know people such as Trent have written on this. So I would say it's very disruptive. I mean, we do two things which e commerce and Amazon does. So we're similar in that way, but we do it in a decentralized way. So those two things are, sure, we execute real world commerce transactions and we receive secure web three customer data, which we monetize.
00:24:21.658 - 00:25:00.042, Speaker B: But again, we do this in a way that's fair and equitable. It's a protocol that everyone can trust and anyone can use. And so this brings the potential to own two massive value pools. So as the global decentralized network for coordinating commerce, and then secondary as a planetary level web three data marketplace for commerce data. Again, the difference being that boson token coordinates the commercial exchange and then captures and redistributes this value from the data monetization in a fair and equitable way.
00:25:00.176 - 00:26:04.066, Speaker A: Okay, so let's unpack this ecommerce stack, because I guess the idea here is that in the same way we've seen this bottom up stack emerge in DeFi, it's highly composable. You can move things in and out in aggregate. It increasingly looks like a capital market, albeit a very simplistic one. But the thesis is, over time, it will grow in complexity, and as you say, because each protocol is a specialist primarily looking to optimize for efficiency, but then also to deliver yield to its end user. So I guess what you're saying with the ecommerce stack is there's going to be an equivalent to the defi stack. Maybe it's also built on components of the DeFi stack. So could you talk us through the different layers of the ecommerce stack, the things that will need to happen for ecommerce at scale and then maybe where boson is placed within it.
00:26:04.168 - 00:27:29.980, Speaker B: Sure. So the way I view it is if you take the current centralized commerce, you have multiple value types that all knit together to provide differentiated and highly competitive propositions. So if you take sort of a premium credit card, for example, that combines a method of payment, it combines credit, it often combines loyalty rewards. You can buy products and services and there's a huge amount of data there. So brands will build a differentiating and value adding proposition from those components in order to be commoditized and in order to compete on fees. And so with boson, we tie together, we're designed to integrate, whether it's with a DeFi protocol that wants to reward their users with real world products and services, so wants to be able to kind of airdrop real world products and services, we would enable that. Whether it's a decentralized platform that wants to understand the preferences of its users, we can enable that.
00:27:29.980 - 00:27:57.746, Speaker B: Or whether it's a crypto exchange that wants to, in a crypto native way, instead of competing on fees, which is a race to the bottom, reward users, or enable users to buy products and services direct from an exchange without ever touching fear, all of those elements, we are a building block where you can plug in each of those elements to create these kind of decentralized commerce applications.
00:27:57.858 - 00:28:30.858, Speaker A: So it sounds like your boson is most valuable when used in a highly commoditized industry. So as you said, if we look at in the crypto world, it's wallets, exchanges, stuff like that. Is the go to market that you will be initially targeting these kind of crypto native businesses, or are you looking to kind of bring in non web three classic digital, ecommerce web two businesses.
00:28:31.034 - 00:30:22.958, Speaker B: So initially we will be targeting these sort of high propensity crypto businesses where there's a strong demand. So for example, crypto exchanges and crypto credit cards, it's no coincidence that rewarding and providing loyalty propositions on top of these products, it's no coincidence that so many of these products require loyalty and rewards, the reason being that they are otherwise commoditized. So we will be targeting crypto exchanges and crypto credit cards to offer a crypto native solution for differentiating those products in order that they don't have to compete on fees and race to the bottom. We're also in conversation with a number of DeFi protocols as well. Again, a lot of the yield, farming and what we've seen recently, it's a reward mechanic. However, it's a short term reward mechanic where you're distributing your silverware for a more sustainable reward mechanic, we can borrow from what's been developed over the last 20 or 30 years and with Boson protocol, enable that in a crypto native way. So that would be our initial launch market, which is crypto, and then we would move to more mainstream across a raft of different industries, from gaming to standard credit cards, and also just enabling marketplaces as a substrate for commerce itself in quite a generic format.
00:30:23.134 - 00:31:06.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the idea of both nfts as useful to close the loyalty loop in the context of DeFi as it stands today, as kind of highly promiscuous environment of yield hunting, and also nfts as forms of digital loyalty for existing e commerce and stuff like that. So I think it's interesting to look at it from both angles. But if we zoom out, why is e commerce important? I mean, I hate Amazon, yet I use it probably more than any other merchant supermarket website combined.
00:31:06.350 - 00:32:03.166, Speaker B: Well, we don't want to live in a world where commerce and data are captured and owned by monopolies. I'm exactly the same as you. Amazon is like a utility for me. But what happens if titans like Amazon continue to tighten their stranglehold on the supply chain and the market? They will end up controlling the market, the supply chain and us. Boson is about laying down the infrastructure to enable a new type of economy, so to enable applications to be built where people are not separated from their data and the value that it creates. And so instead having an economy where value is fairly distributed amongst stakeholders. And so that's the infrastructure that we're building with Boson protocol.
00:32:03.278 - 00:32:35.262, Speaker A: Yes. I mean, I'm super excited about boson. I've watched your development over the last 18 months or so, and I think the timing of this is very relevant now if nfts are looking to kind of cross over, but also, as I said, to address some fundamental design problems that we see in Defi today. So good luck with everything, Justin, it's been great having you on. Looking forward to seeing how you progress from here.
00:32:35.396 - 00:32:41.310, Speaker B: Thanks, Jamie. Thanks for having me on the show, and thanks for your continued support for Boson and the whole industry.
