00:00:05.130 - 00:00:11.626, Speaker A: As you can see, we have a very special guest with us today, Justin Bannon of Bosom protocol.
00:00:11.818 - 00:00:13.290, Speaker B: Welcome, Justin.
00:00:13.450 - 00:00:15.360, Speaker C: Thanks, Jamie. Good to be here.
00:00:16.130 - 00:00:30.854, Speaker A: So, obviously, it's a great privilege to have you here because you are in the middle of quite an important moment in. In what's going on with boson and its history, its long journey. We've been working with you for.
00:00:30.972 - 00:00:31.686, Speaker B: God, I don't know.
00:00:31.708 - 00:00:33.480, Speaker A: How long have we been working with you for now?
00:00:35.290 - 00:00:41.690, Speaker C: Must be 18 months, right? Yeah. 2019, right.
00:00:41.760 - 00:00:45.430, Speaker A: So from the very depths of crypto winter.
00:00:45.590 - 00:00:51.354, Speaker B: And you guys have shown real grit, to be honest with you, to even.
00:00:51.392 - 00:01:03.422, Speaker A: Be where you are today. Right. I remember back then you were walking around talking about this kind of crazy mechanism, and everyone was like, what the hell are you talking about? And if we look at the last.
00:01:03.476 - 00:01:06.846, Speaker B: Few months, people have effectively been throwing.
00:01:06.878 - 00:01:09.102, Speaker A: Money at you, I think, from summertime.
00:01:09.166 - 00:01:09.780, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:10.470 - 00:01:36.234, Speaker A: So maybe just before we go into it. So you're in the middle of your tg at the moment over on gnosis. I have to be quite careful about what we talk about, because this can't be a financial promotion. And that's a disclaimer. This is not a financial promotion. But what I'd like to do is two things. I'd like to just talk about your journey to where you are here today, in abbreviated form, and the kind of fundraising activities you've done to date.
00:01:36.234 - 00:02:18.360, Speaker A: And then just some of the higher level numbers on some of the demand going into this sale in terms of the whitelisting and stuff. And then really, I want to spend most of their time going into the ecommerce stack, because I think that ecommerce is just not on people's radar at the moment. Despite all the hype and attention you've been getting, you're pretty much one project that's talking about the stuff at the moment beyond me and outlier. And I think it is the next step of what's going to be happening in the context of NFTs, DFI, and, of course, the metaverse. So maybe just give us an abbreviated last 18 months and where you are as of today.
00:02:18.810 - 00:03:56.086, Speaker C: Sure. We were on the inaugural cohort for outlier ventures base camp, and we had an idea, which was boson protocol, which was a way to automate digital to physical redemption in a game theoretic way, and also to disrupt platforms using the tokenized ecosystem business model. And we were on that program, got a lot of help from outlier, a lot of introductions to a lot of key people, got some really great interest from people like Trent McConaughey, Michael Zargam, et cetera, early on. But it was crypto winter and even crypto vcs were telling us pivot to a SaaS business model, you remember that, which was just something that we refused to do because we're here to demonopolize and kind of create a commerce infrastructure that is kind of free from extraction. And we kept the faith, we kept building the project, doing our research in the hope and the faith that eventually that crypto winter would break. And for us, last August we published our white paper and finally revealed this kind of mechanism got a lot of scrutiny and also a huge amount of interest and support. And really from that moment we just started raising, we did a couple of rounds, we raised about $350,000.
00:03:56.086 - 00:04:52.022, Speaker C: And then things just started to snowball from around August till March we raised in about five or six rounds, about $10 million in presales. Our last two presales, well, the first one was like six times oversubscribed and closed before it opened. But the last one was like a $1 million round. We had about 50, $60 million trying to get into that round. And I think the demand for the project is just coming from everywhere now. We've seen demand from the number of partners we've signed, we've had to scale the team to kind of build parallel teams for all of these different verticals from NFT art to crypto rewards to full on ecommerce. And we just see demand everywhere.
00:04:52.022 - 00:05:36.440, Speaker C: And coming then into this public sale, well, the Mailchimp server went down when we opened up the whitelist. Then we enabled registrations and we took down one of our KYC suppliers. They just couldn't handle the demand. So we had to kind of go offline for three days and then bring on two KYC providers. And even then they struggled. So we've had about 36,000 applications for the whitelist. I think our highest estimate is about 9000 we thought we might get.
00:05:36.440 - 00:06:00.126, Speaker C: And so, yeah, we've just seen this incredible demand and the public sale is open at the moment. It's a 48 hours sale and we've got about 12 hours to go. So this is now the kind of the business end of the sale. It's a bit like in musical chairs when the music stops. So it might be a late night for us tonight, like election night, almost.
00:06:00.308 - 00:06:12.354, Speaker B: Just talk about how that mechanism works. So how gnosis works. As you say, you've been open for what, like 1012 hours. Obviously, I don't want to go into too much of the specifics, but just the process itself and how things kind of ramp up towards the end.
00:06:12.392 - 00:07:01.426, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's a 48 hours sale. The first 24 hours people could remove bids, but after 24 hours, bids are then permanent. And so the mechanism basically works that for the 6 million tokens that we are selling, it takes the top 6 million tokens by price, but then charges the lowest price there. So it's a fair mechanism, but in the sort of latter stages, people who want to ensure they get boson tokens, that's when more kind of competitive bidding happens and that's what we're seeing. And, yeah, it's going to be an exciting night, I think. Yeah.
00:07:01.448 - 00:07:09.798, Speaker B: Well, good luck. And I'm looking forward to having a drink with you, probably outside, because lockdown's being eased in the UK and you're going to be a neighbor to me soon, so we're even going to be.
00:07:09.804 - 00:07:11.318, Speaker C: Able to potentially go to a local.
00:07:11.484 - 00:07:40.750, Speaker B: Pub and get a pint in. But anyway, let's get to the business end of things. The business end of things. I just realized I didn't have my mic anywhere near me, so sorry if I was coming across faint when we started. So let's just give a high level reminder of what boson is. I can see a few people in the chat have no clue, I don't know where they've been hiding under a rock, but nevertheless, let's ease them in. So you've got this kind of fundamental mechanism.
00:07:40.750 - 00:08:26.938, Speaker B: By background, you're a physicist, but you've also built out billion dollar loyalty businesses. So you're actually quite a rare beast, which is why we really liked you when you joined the program. But you kind of solved a very complex problem mathematically, in effect through game theory, working, as you mentioned, with some world leading specialists in game theory from including Imperial College. Can you just talk us through that as a primitive? And then I know you've got. And somebody said, explain it to him like he's five, so good luck with that. And then I think it would be good to talk about thing tokens and data tokens and why in combination they allow for ecommerce.
00:08:27.114 - 00:09:16.906, Speaker C: Sure. So the simple explanation, I think there's two pretty fundamental innovations with boson. One is this kind of a mechanism, and the other is more of a design pattern business model. So yeah, the mechanism, if you have a buyer and a seller and they want to transact online, then you need a means by which to coordinate the transaction and a means by which to handle things like disputes or disagreements and the new normal for that is to have a platform, a digital platform in the middle, to regulate those transactions. The promise of digital platforms was lower cost, more value. But of course, that's not what's been delivered. What's been delivered is kind of extraction.
00:09:16.906 - 00:09:50.454, Speaker C: But so that mechanism of having a sort of centralized platform, we replace by a piece of game theory. So it's a mechanism by which buyer and seller will place deposits and they're both incentivized to behave fairly. And this enables us to remove that intermediary and while still coordinating those transactions, but in a way that removes that extractionary intermediary and reduces friction, cost and trust.
00:09:50.652 - 00:10:07.054, Speaker B: And the point is there, by the way, that that sounds very complex, but as far as the user is concerned, they don't really experience that. The complexity is abstracted away. That's just what happens within the smart contract layer, which then governs that commitment. And then that takes us into commitment tokens, right?
00:10:07.172 - 00:10:51.290, Speaker C: Exactly. So that game, which know my background, as you mentioned, is like loyalty and rewards programs, a lot of loyalty and rewards programs, like the British Airways executive Club, it's got really complex rules. But of course, the trick is to make the rules appear simple to the users, that they know what they need to do. And so likewise for a buyer, you just need to, basically you have a commitment which is for you to turn up or for you to go through with the transaction. A bit like booking a restaurant. If you don't turn up, you lose your deposit. And for the seller, they have a slightly more, it's more like an SLA for the seller, if they don't deliver or they don't deliver to quality, then they can lose their deposits.
00:10:51.290 - 00:11:40.250, Speaker C: And so it's actually quite simple for both buyer and seller. And that game is encoded within an NFT. So you can think of that NFT as like a paper voucher to go and use a service. It's actually like a futures contract, right? But it's a paper voucher to go and use a service. But because it's a digital object and it's an NFT, it can actually be encoded with these. So that is what we call a commitment token. So if I, Jamie, committed to buy your bike or committed to buy something from you, then I would lock up a deposit, you would lock up a deposit and that would then be a commitment, like a futures contract between us to perform this transaction at a later date.
00:11:40.250 - 00:11:44.810, Speaker C: And that's what we tokenize and encode within an NFT.
00:11:45.630 - 00:11:58.702, Speaker B: And so, as you know, effectively, you have the commitment is an NFT. And then the thing is an NFT. And the idea is these can be stateful, right? Could you just talk through the idea of stateful nfTs? Because I think that's a huge innovation.
00:11:58.846 - 00:12:39.520, Speaker C: Yeah. Hitherto, NFTs have been these unique digital objects, whether it be they art, be they just these items, skins, whatever. But much like the real world, you can have static objects, but you also have objects that have state. Right? And a good example is you get those little labyrinth wooden mazes that you get on coffee tables with a ball that rolls around. You have to try and get it through a maze. That's kind of what our NFT is like. It's like a little maze, and the ball can be in a certain position, and depending which position it is in, it has state.
00:12:39.520 - 00:13:07.430, Speaker C: These objects have like structure and state, and can be encoded and programmed. And so that's what we mean by stateful. So our NFTs can be in the redeemed state, they can be in the kind of refunded state, they can be in the complaint state, they could be in the. And so this structure can then in an actual kind of smart way manage the incentives between buyer and sellers and encourage them to behave fairly.
00:13:07.930 - 00:14:03.990, Speaker B: Yes, we've got a question here, which it was going to be my follow up question anyway. So this doesn't totally remove risk, but it reduces the need for arbitration. But what in the case of escalation. So I think what's important to express is when we're talking about this initial mechanism, things, tokens, commitment tokens, these are kind of like the primitives. These primitives are going to form effectively a decommerce stack, in the same way that Defi has a stack, highly composable, highly modular. And we'll talk about how the dcommerce stack can actually directly and indirectly build upon and leverage existing Defi infrastructure. But let's kind of put that to side for 1 second so this primitive doesn't remove all risk, and there will be a requirement for escalation and potentially arbitration.
00:14:03.990 - 00:14:08.890, Speaker B: Can you talk us through how other elements of the stack can then solve for that escalation?
00:14:09.310 - 00:15:26.838, Speaker C: Sure. No, I mean, it's impossible to completely reduce all need for human arbitration or for, let's not say human arbitration, but like kind of intelligent arbitration, because you can have AI arbitration, for example, but the boson core mechanism significantly reduces the need for that. But what happens in the event of a dispute is both parties, the mechanism handles the first stage of the buyer complaining. The seller can either accept that complaint or not, if they can't resolve it, the buyer can choose to request a refund, and then the mechanism would reverse if the seller accepts it. But if after all of that, the, the buyer and seller can't resolve it, then the case can be escalated to an escalated arbitrator. And so in that case, this escalated arbitrator would then resolve the issue. Now the major difference between say an ecommerce solution to that is that this escalated arbitrator, I mean, that is an abstracted function.
00:15:26.838 - 00:16:42.800, Speaker C: They're not in this privileged position of controlling transactions and therefore being able to extract outside profits or anything. In fact, there's a competitive market for this arbitration. And then we use sort of like DeFi algorithms to kind of mutualize the cost of arbitration, assessing the risk of different types of buyers and sellers and that transaction, and then kind of for a fee, insuring your transaction against the need for it to go to arbitration. So for example, if you or your address had a good history of selling things and resolving disputes, then the cost for me to insure against escalated arbitration when I buy from you would be low. Therefore there's a market incentive for you to behave fairly, otherwise the cost for people to insure against you goes high. Again, these are kind of pretty standard these days, kind of algorithmic mechanisms that can be employed. Of course, if you have the mechanism designers to design these things, which we're very fortunate to have.
00:16:43.570 - 00:18:02.920, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think you alluded to this point that if you look at DeFI compared to the existing financial system, there is no to little incentive to innovate in the existing financial system. In CFI generally, right? They're insulated from having to innovate because they're insulated from market forces. They're effectively monopolies because of the barrier to entry, the regulatory barrier to entry. Whilst if you compare that to DeFi, it's competition, Max, right? The idea is that because of its composable nature, if something is too expensive, it'll just be removed, replaced and optimized. I think bringing about that competition, Max, in the context of commerce, is going to be incredibly powerful. So I just want to come back to this idea of if everything is an NFT, a thing is an NFT, a futures agreement like a commitment or a futures agreement for a thing is an NFT, and they all exist in this kind of fluid, then what happens from that? I know you've referenced, this is similar to commodities markets, for example, where people will speculate on the price or the cost and yield of an oil field or a particular kind of commodity line.
00:18:02.920 - 00:18:08.940, Speaker B: Can you talk us through what fluid markets mean and how they're now possible?
00:18:12.990 - 00:19:17.146, Speaker C: Platform business model. Platform business models was something that I kind of studied academically and then built, as you mentioned, this kind of big billion dollar revenue platform. And they were super disruptive to the previous paradigm. However, a platform is essentially a closed, it's like a closed market economy, right? A centralized economy. And tokenized ecosystems are like an open free market economy. And so instead of like with an Amazon or an eBay, et cetera, putting buyers and sellers in a closed market and then having the products, again only transacting on a centralized database. What boson enables is for things to be represented as tokens and then for these to flow over, just like flow as actually ERC 20s all across DFI infrastructure.
00:19:17.146 - 00:20:54.480, Speaker C: And also be. And this we leverage, we borrow directly from ocean protocols infrastructure with, as you know, Trent being one of actually our first angel investor and an advisor for first advisor as well. But we leverage the ocean architecture which enables us to represent real world items as things that flow over DFI. So for example, if you wanted to buy, let's say the bicycle, you could buy a special ERC 20 that represents a particular bicycle or a particular item or a particular service, and you could go and buy that from, for example, a balancer pool. And you could have a bonding curve to give you this kind of dynamic price discovery. And you could use those thing tokens as collateral for loans or to integrate with all of these different dapps and protocols. But to give you an example of some of the power of leveraging DFI, if you and I, Jamie, were to decide that we've got an idea for this kind of antigravity hoverboard, and we've got this concept and we want to raise some money for it, we could actually go and create thing tokens, ERc 20 tokens for this hoverboard, and we could sell those on a balancer pool today and basically create like an initial product offering, right, where people go like a decentralized Kickstarter, people can go and buy those tokens now and then redeem them at a later date.
00:20:55.330 - 00:21:36.774, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's kind of come back to the ecommerce stack. So obviously you're building out elements of it, but it's not going to be just dependent on you. You have an ecosystem proposition, which is why you're raising the level of capital that you are in order to not just build out some of the primitives, but then also help fund other kind of modules within the ecommerce stack. Can you talk us through the ecosystem approach, some of the known areas or modules that you think are going to be critical to effectively help e commerce create an equivalent to Amazon?
00:21:36.822 - 00:21:36.986, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:37.008 - 00:21:55.540, Speaker B: I mean, that's a long term goal. And I think there's a lot of promise that's been seen in things like Shopify, where Shopify have effectively turned Amazon into modules for kind of self service for this long tail of retailer. Effectively, you're taking that one step further and you're decentralizing those.
00:21:58.630 - 00:22:43.326, Speaker C: You know, I like your analogy of boson being like a stablecoin. Boson is to decommerce what stablecoins are to defi. We are the foundational primitive that enables this core exchange, but that's not enough. And so there are kind of what we call kind of core modules as well that we will be building and open sourcing. So one example is, for example, dispatch. So extending the core mechanism so that a buyer, instead of collecting directly, can delegate their signing to, for example, a courier. So integrating with DHL, et cetera.
00:22:43.326 - 00:23:53.638, Speaker C: So that's one module. But there are a whole host of these other sort of core modules, whether it's integrating with Shopify or whether it's a variety of those there. So some of those we're building ourselves and we'll open source the code. So for example, with the dispatch module, we will build one, integrate with key global couriers. But if you were in, for example, India and you wanted to integrate with a local indian courier, you could take that code and you could build your own, but then there is a whole ecosystem of functionality. So beyond that, what we are doing is we're partnering with, for example, the token engineering community and Gitcoin to bring together ecommerce devs and technologists with web three token engineers and web three devs to discover what are the challenges, what are the components, what do we need, and then solve some of these problems. And we'll provide funding and sort of working groups for that.
00:23:53.638 - 00:24:09.980, Speaker C: And then for the projects that are sort of eligible, we provide further funding. And as we've discussed, Jamie, fund a track on the outlier ventures base camp program. A track.
00:24:10.610 - 00:25:30.870, Speaker B: Cool. So we've got five minutes left. Let's get weird. So obviously, we've primarily been talking about ecommerce in the sense of ecommerce that most people are familiar with, right? So solving for this digital to physical redemption problem that you would have to do were you to be able to create a decentralized Amazon or Shopify or whatever it might be, but of course, it doesn't stop there, right? So if we look at the metaverse and we think about this happening in a purely kind of virtual context, there are obviously a lot of gaming platforms at the moment where a huge billions of dollars of digital wealth is locked because those platforms effectively are a closed economy. Often you can't transfer them off those platforms. Sometimes you can't even transact them internally, and certainly you can't even sell them for fiat, let alone for things like bitcoin or ETH or USDT. Now, the cool thing with boson is it could allow in some games for players to be able to exchange trustfully exchange in world items without the explicit permission of the platform itself.
00:25:30.870 - 00:25:33.720, Speaker B: So could you just talk us through how that works?
00:25:35.050 - 00:26:22.230, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. In fact, we've just recruited and I haven't announced, so I might get in trouble for do it. Do it. One of the Ethereum 2.0 core mechanism designers who'd previously written a paper on a dual escrow for digital and on chain goods. So we will be releasing a v two of the core mechanism, where boson is a single kind of mechanism for unlocking any physical, digital, or on chain item. So I could exchange a boson or a bundle of bosons with you, and it could be for an NFT, it could be for a digital item, it could have a physical counterpart.
00:26:22.230 - 00:26:37.610, Speaker C: And we just see just having the abstraction of anything physical, digital or on chain thing, there shouldn't be different form factors. And that's, again, that blurring between physical and digital worlds.
00:26:37.950 - 00:27:01.122, Speaker B: Cool. So we got two minutes left, 1 minute for each one, right? If possible. So could you tell us about the metamol, and could you tell us about the form of kind of metaverse loyalty card that you're working on? 1 minute on each. And again, I know I'm forcing you to talk about things you probably don't want to talk about, but what's the point in coming on diffusion live if we don't do that?
00:27:01.176 - 00:27:01.730, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:01.880 - 00:27:02.434, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:02.552 - 00:28:02.466, Speaker C: So the metamol concept is we're building out basically like the seers of in game and in world, where brands can come and sell and we can sell items where you buy an NFT, which is redeemable in store on chain or elsewhere, as we said, using the boson mechanism. And that's something we're going to be launching in the next couple of months, and it's going to be crazy and amazing. Then, for the loyalty program, we're basically taking a lot of the kind of science of loyalty and rewards from offline and enabling a loyalty program for NFT and art, et cetera, aficionados, which will be giving benefits and unlocking access to special drops, et cetera, and merging a lot of that loyalty science with this emerging world of NFTs.
00:28:02.658 - 00:28:33.300, Speaker B: And it's worth saying that you built a billion dollar company doing specifically that with Mastercard, Visa, Amex. So I'm really looking forward to seeing how you both bring all of those players into the metaverse, but then equally enable metaverse native. So I'm being told I've got to wrap up one final thing. Just so people understand this is not conceptual stuff, right? Tell us about the team very quickly, how many people you've got, some of the skills and disciplines, and what your plan is for the next three months.
00:28:33.910 - 00:29:13.390, Speaker C: Well, we've just got demand, demand, demand from partners, from customers, from everyone. So we've built one of the best sort of token design protocol, design mechanism, design tech teams, and we're just building out now and parallelizing about four separate product teams to build for protocol, web two, web three, and ecommerce tracks, because we just see the need to kind of hyper blitzcale because we've got so much demand and we basically have got this ambition to be the TCP IP of commerce.
00:29:13.730 - 00:29:37.618, Speaker B: There you go. Boom. Justin, thanks so much for joining us. I know this is probably a fun, yet stressful moment in your life. It means a lot to us that you dropped in. I think it's a real great testament to what we can do at base camp and the quality of projects that we work with. Many of the earlier projects that have spoken the last two days of the conference are aspiring bosons.
00:29:37.618 - 00:29:53.606, Speaker B: You've really done everybody proud surviving the winter, and not just surviving, but thriving. Justin, good luck with the next. Whatever it is. 14 hours. Looking forward to a jar with you in a pub garden soon.
00:29:53.788 - 00:30:01.420, Speaker C: And just to say thanks, Jamie and everyone at outlier. You guys have been like the third founder to us, and we really have been in this place without you guys.
