So today I'm really happy to welcome Brian Kerr, co founder of Carver.
00:00:51.978 - 00:00:54.622, Speaker B: Welcome, Brian. Thanks for having me, Jamie. Happy to be here.
00:00:54.756 - 00:02:09.670, Speaker A: So we describe Carver as a Defi hub for cross chain dapps, and we'll obviously unpack that a little bit later. The reason why I've got you on the show, there are several, obviously. Defi is hot, Defi ux even hotter. How do we make all this good stuff usable? Usable for not just entirely newbies into the crypto space, but for crypto first, I guess, given it's still a very relatively small percentage of the global crypto population that's even using this stuff. Some high level stats just going on the website recently. So we're at the beginning of December 2020, coastal asset value is 52 and a half million USD, made up of finance, coin finance, USD, bitcoin, XRP. I'm sure that number has gone up or down, probably even within the hour, hopefully up total value borrowed 28 million, just under 29 million in USDX, $3 million worth of total rewards distributed.
00:02:09.670 - 00:02:58.326, Speaker A: And you kind of reference community built apps a lot. And so it's going to be interesting to understand what you mean by that. And I guess as a founder, as a founder in Web Three, a founder of something like a DFI hub, how much of it do you do centrally as a team and how involved are as a wider community and who does that extend to? And then almost like a bonus reason, and we'll see if we have time to get into it. You are were a big gamer working in esports, and I definitely want to understand the correlation between gaming, crypto, defi. Could gaming become a gateway into crypto and then subsequently defi? So hopefully all of those things are stuff that you want to talk about.
00:02:58.428 - 00:03:32.522, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there. Maybe before we get started, because you mentioned kind of the stats and community apps. The other one I'll call out is the first application that launched on Kava called hard protocol. You can visit it at hard Kava IO. But it's a money market for cross chain assets, and there's currently $38 million in that application as well. And that is a lending and borrowing market for digital assets. And there's assets like USDX, the native stablecoin on kava.
00:03:32.522 - 00:03:38.818, Speaker B: Of course, Kava's token can be lent and borrowed there as well as well as all the other assets you mentioned.
00:03:38.904 - 00:03:39.490, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:03:39.560 - 00:03:48.418, Speaker B: So I'm pretty pleased with where that's gotten because we've only launched it about a month ago, so the traction has been really nice, and I expected to.
00:03:48.424 - 00:04:35.186, Speaker A: Grow a lot from and look overall some great numbers there. So maybe by way of origin story to give a bit of context. I can see early on 2012 to 14, you're working within marketing, marketing agencies, presumably with a digital bent. And then there was this period of involvement in the gaming industry from similar period, 214 to 216 in a mixture of different things, right? So from kind of hardware, from what I could see all the way through to, well, I guess that's also hardware in an esports context. So was that just business for you, or were you like a hardcore gamer yourself?
00:04:35.368 - 00:05:41.260, Speaker B: I grew up playing a lot of competitive games from the early days of counterstrike and StarCraft, and kind of anything I could play online in the early days of the Internet and compete with someone on I loved. And it was in no way a reality for me earlier in my life to think I could ever make that into my job. I thought I was going to be an engineer and do other the normal white collar activities. And it was actually through the marketing agency that I was working with called Kenwood, and they worked with a bunch of global brands, many of them gaming. So one of my clients was Nvidia, and we helped them with a lot of their larger gaming focused launches. It was through that avenue that I got introduced, actually at a conference to one of the leading esports stars named Patrick Satraman, who was one of the early members of Fanatic. And they just really needed help at that time getting any type of business.
00:05:41.260 - 00:06:48.318, Speaker B: Esports organizations were like mom and pop shops that had no revenue. It was literally a passion that people loved playing games and they loved to compete, and there wasn't good prize money, there wasn't a lot of advertisers in the space. And because I was at a marketing agency dealing with kind of the very few companies that could actually sponsor gaming because they were endemic brands like Nvidia, I said, hey, I'll help you guys out. I'm talking to the cmos of these large orgs that might have some budget for you, and then you can use that money and send your teams to compete around the world. And I just did it out of a love and a passion. And that's kind of how I got started getting involved in gaming and on the esports side of things. And what was really magical was over a short, I would say, three year span, esports just took off, largely because of the advent of Twitch becoming the live streaming platform for gamers where people could watch them play.
00:06:48.318 - 00:07:58.126, Speaker B: Nobody knew that was even a marketplace, but what that did was it made this really hard to reach demographic of 20 to, let's say it's 15 to 25 year olds that don't like watching tv, and they're very resistant to advertising now they're watching these live streams and you can segment them by their interest and what games they play, and you kind of can put them together as a package for advertisers. And that kind of the growth of Twitch, bringing in marketing dollars into that, was followed by a bunch of family office money. And kind of in that wave, I also decided to make the jump, kind of seeing the writing on the wall that esports was going to really take off. And I left the marketing agency I was at joined. Well, it was Patrick, Sam, and Sam's mom running the company. And it was a company where people really weren't even paid salaries at that time. So I use the words company loosely, and it kind of went from a three person team in the office in shortage in London, and that grew kind of over that three year span.
00:07:58.126 - 00:08:16.780, Speaker B: And, well, now fast forward to today. It's a $175,000,000 company and one of the largest esports organizations in the world. So I think it's, needless to say, I watched a hurricane of activity happen in that space. It was very interesting and very informative as a.
00:08:18.590 - 00:08:30.010, Speaker A: Saw. You know, you were CEO of Funk Inc. And then that was acquired by Fanatic. Fanatic was the company you were just talking about now, right? This was a separate entity.
00:08:30.170 - 00:09:30.498, Speaker B: Yeah, my LinkedIn. Slightly confusing because I was at fanatic first working with them and helping them kind of turn into a real business. And then as part of that, one of the conditions I had of leaving my marketing agency job was I didn't want to just go and work with a bunch of teenagers who were running around traveling and competing in games. I thought that there was a huge business opportunity in the gaming sector. Coming from my marketing background, working with brands and how to position them, and what I saw was there was a huge opportunity for what I called like a beats by Dre play, but for gamers and gaming gear. So using the professionals, the influencers of the space, have them design things that they want to use and then market it authentically. And it was that as well as an energy drink brand, I had those two concepts coming into the space, and I said, I want to help you create fanatic and turn into a real business 50% of the time.
00:09:30.498 - 00:10:30.786, Speaker B: But I also want to spend the other 50% of my time trying to build a very different business, either hardware or this energy drink company. And let's turn that into a real company that has sales around the world that isn't reliant on just a handful of. Well, at least at that time, what was like ten advertisers or ten companies that would sponsor esports and gaming. And what ultimately happened there was I didn't do the esports gaming drink, and I focused all my time on hardware. And me joining Funk, which is on my LinkedIn, was actually part of an acquisition where fanatic was going to acquire funk. I had to go in, really learn the business. I had to, of course, orchestrate the deal, but I had to learn the business, how distributors work, how to manufacture things in China, how the industrial design and everything works within gaming hardware.
00:10:30.786 - 00:10:40.598, Speaker B: And then once I got a good feel for that business, I integrate it into the overall fanatic holding company, and we rebranded it and called it Fanatic Gear.
00:10:40.694 - 00:11:02.906, Speaker A: Wow. And so you exited then, as I said. And the role around fanatic and stuff ended around 2016. 2017. You founded Carver. But I can see in between then. I don't know if this was in parallel to Carver or prior to it, but you're an advisor to at least two projects.
00:11:02.906 - 00:11:30.810, Speaker A: I can see listed snowball and d market. And I can see an obvious link with Dmarket. Right. There's this blockchain based, decentralized digital asset marketplace for publishers to create purchasable inventory, including skins, gaming items, et cetera. Was that prior to Carver, or tell us how you went from fanatic into Carver.
00:11:33.070 - 00:12:12.310, Speaker B: You're sniffing the trail. And that's exactly right. Dmarket was kind of my first foray because I was there leading fanatic, which was the largest esports team in Europe. And actually, of course, I'm good friends with everyone else that was running the other large esports teams in other jurisdictions. And Navi natives, Vinceri was run by this guy named Alex, and he was doing a killer job in sort of the russian speaking markets with his esports organization. He actually was one of the leaders in terms of fundraising. He raised about 100 million from Alishar Usmanov.
00:12:12.310 - 00:12:51.554, Speaker B: He was sort of one of the first movers to kind of grow his company to a very large size. And he was in San Francisco, where I was living at the time, and it was for a crypto conference. And he said, hey, Brian, I'm thinking about doing these things. I want you to meet my co founder, Vlad. And they talked to me, and this was basically nfts and gaming in blockchain before it was cool. And they pitched me the idea of dmarket, and it just made so much sense to me. But that was really one of my first deep engagements within crypto, and I had no blockchain experience whatsoever at that time.
00:12:51.554 - 00:13:48.130, Speaker B: I just really wanted to help them take their product to market and make sure that they were positioning themselves for success. And they actually did a great job getting out the gates in 2017 and raising money when people should have been raising money in the hot market. And they were able to raise about $20 million with not much more at that time than a PowerPoint presentation and a nice website. But now the product has developed quite a bit further and they've actually sort of been finding different product market fit. And I know Vlad and the whole team there has now since moved to Santa Monica. They were in Ukraine, and $20 million, by the way, is a huge amount for someone who's living in Ukraine with a team in Ukraine. And now they're going on to raise subsequent venture rounds, doing very interesting things with their company.
00:13:48.130 - 00:14:03.900, Speaker B: So that was my first chance, but I actually got to learn a lot in that advisory role as well. I got to help them with marketing and positioning, but I got to learn all these things about sort of what's happening in the crypto space. I'm very thankful for that.
00:14:04.430 - 00:14:46.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting, the role of fortune in founders evolution and serendipity. So you co founded Carver Labs in 2017. So that would imply somebody else was involved in that decision. So how did it happen? How did you go from D Market, presumably seeing the value of crypto generally to Carver, which is at least now a DFI project? 2017 was very early for DFI or DFI related projects.
00:14:47.290 - 00:15:47.894, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to connect all the dots, at the end of 2016, I officially stepped down as CEO over at fanatic. And the reason was because I'm a builder, I like creating things that didn't exist before, and the company grew to over 100 people. So it was just a very different beast at that point, I'm just not the type of person who likes to manage other people and squeeze the most out of their time. I like to build things that just didn't exist before that I want or I feel the world needs. And fanatic was definitely in a different place at that point. So I said, okay, what's the next thing I can do? That was my first founder experience, but it was a traumatic, dramatic evolution for me, doing kind of learning all the things of a hardware business, learning the wild, wild west of esports.
00:15:47.894 - 00:16:42.990, Speaker B: I never held an executive role prior to that, so there was just so many different muscles I was able to flex in that journey. And I saw many, many other founders that the people I liked, but they were struggling to get their businesses off the ground in the gaming sector. So I actually got some successful entrepreneurs together, actually raised a decent amount of money from them. And I was starting a seed fund for esports and gaming specific companies. And I thought that's what was going to be the next phase of my life. I was going to help other entrepreneurs do what I had done over there, and hopefully I can make their journey slightly less painful than mine. But kind of push comes to shove after dmarket, and I just got very obsessive with blockchain.
00:16:42.990 - 00:17:20.278, Speaker B: The technology fascinated me, and I'm a very obsessive person just generally when it comes to knowledge and particular passions. Tennis being another one and chess being another one. I got very obsessive about blockchain. I kind of stopped everything that I was doing, and I knew I needed to commit the next five years. I just had this feeling, at least the next five years of my life entirely to blockchain. And I gave all the lps their money back, shut down the fund. I actually had a business partner there, and he was sort of very disheartened that I made this decision, but he was understanding, so I thanked him for that.
00:17:20.278 - 00:18:22.506, Speaker B: And after that, I just tried to network with as many people high up in crypto at that time as I could. So if I have one superpower, it's getting in front of people. And I think within the first few weeks of me making this decision, I was able to sit down with Joseph Lubin over at consensus. I was able to speak to kind of the leaders over at ripple, and I really just kind of networked my butt off and tried to learn from the people that knew the most in the space at the time. And you're going to laugh, but as a typical founder story, I didn't actually have a great view on the market at that time. So when we made Kava, it was actually as like a software development and research company to work on payments, and it was cross chain payments. However, turned out crypto payments didn't take off at all from 2017 to 2019, and they still really haven't taken off to any large degree.
00:18:22.506 - 00:19:08.634, Speaker B: The volumes there are still very low to support any type of business. So after struggling to raise money over, everyone was raising $20 million there, $30 million here. I couldn't even get a million dollars for almost two years because my view of the world didn't quite match up with investors. And I don't think that necessarily meant that I was wrong. I just think that what the market of crypto investors wanted didn't match necessarily how I saw the world. And we had to pivot because I put in a bunch of money, my co founder put in a bunch of money and we were paying people's salaries, which I know isn't the start of every company where people don't have that luxury to sort of bootstrap on your own. But thankfully, we were able to do that for a good amount of time.
00:19:08.634 - 00:20:20.830, Speaker B: But after two years of that, we had to kind of come to terms and come to grips with things say, all right, this isn't working. The market doesn't want what we're building, and it's probably still not going to want what we're building, at least for another two years. So let's look at what the market wants. And at that time, at the sort of start of 2019, it was just very clear to us, after seeing the success of maker being one of the only dapps that had real usage, that DFI was the thing that the world really wanted. And it's because it allows traders to speculate better. And that's definitely what's happening in crypto, is there's just a lot of traders, a lot of financial markets, a lot of speculators, so if you build products for them, they're going to get used. And we took our knowledge that we built up in that time of researching and developing, and we had worked with Ripple and Makerdao and a bunch of others on kind of non custodial cross chain solutions, and we took that expertise and we said, ok, well, let's make now a platform that can use what we've learned working across different blockchains and apply that into a DeFi solution.
00:20:20.830 - 00:21:06.340, Speaker B: And that's really sort of how the birth of the kava blockchain or the kava Defi hub got started. We said, if people want to do this with their Ethereum, use it as collateral to get a loan and die on maker. People definitely want to do that with bitcoin, and they definitely want to do that with XRP and all the other assets that don't live on the Ethereum ecosystem. And you know what? Sure enough, within one week of announcing this new kava blockchain, investors lined up. Before we even decided to fundraise, they lined up, emailed me and fought to just get in front of me and they threw $5 million at us within two weeks and we were off to the races and we haven't looked back since.
00:21:07.030 - 00:22:07.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really great to hear, because as an accelerator we work with over 30 startups a year. And the easiest way I can describe it is sometimes as an entrepreneur, it feels like you're swimming upstream and sometimes it feels like you're swimming downstream. And unless you've experienced both, it's very difficult to know the difference. Right. Are you swimming against the tide or is this just how it feels to be an entrepreneur? I think it's only when you're lucky enough to kind of go downstream do you really appreciate what it feels like to get fit. So I'm really glad that you managed to make it through that journey. And when we were talking off air before we came on, I always ask a founder when I try to do the intro, is this the correct description? Because startups pivot, they change, especially language.
00:22:07.634 - 00:22:42.986, Speaker A: They change language a lot. And obviously at this top end we said the defi hub for Dapps. But you said even then there was some kind of evolution. I don't know if you would class it as a pivot or as an evolution of the offering from what was kind of. How did I describe it previously? Multi chain defi lending platform with stablecoin loans and chain link oracle data. Was that just because some of the technical components are different, or was it something more substantial in the evolution of the offering?
00:22:43.178 - 00:24:03.020, Speaker B: So something that I think is really important for everyone to always have as sort of context when they talk about a product is there's the actuality of what the product is and then how you talk about it to the rest of the world. A great example of this is sort of the Amazon. It was a bookstore company, it was online bookstore first, but that was just the tip of the iceberg, and there was so much underneath it that was part of the grander business plan and strategy and similar here, or at least actually first, let me just clarify, and with that sort of grander strategy, you show the tip of the iceberg to the world, and that's your positioning for a specific point in time. But then everything that you're working on underneath, when it finally comes up out of the water, that's when you slightly tweak your positioning or you slightly change your target market or you change the narrative. You're not changing the product that you're building or how you're functioning necessarily, but what you're doing is you're emphasizing different parts of it to the world differently. And that's exactly how we started with Kava. When we first announced what we were doing, it was makerdao, but for BTC, it was just a very straight, tweetable thing.
00:24:03.020 - 00:24:32.850, Speaker B: And importantly, the price was very cheap compared to Makerdao as a comparable. So investors really wanted that. It was just like a very quick, no brainer, no real explanation needed, which I also learned in my journey is don't explain things. That's immediately when people don't want to give you money. When you can say something in a tweet and they're like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Of course, then it's just your job not to mess up the interaction. They've already decided they want it.
00:24:32.850 - 00:24:53.302, Speaker B: But we did that really well. When we created this kava blockchain product, we just distilled it down. We didn't say it's going to be the defi hub for everything. We didn't talk about all the new apps that are going to be built on top. We just said, it's Makerdao for BTC. It's built on the Cosmos SDK. It's going to interoperate with a bunch of other chains and use them as collateral.
00:24:53.302 - 00:25:49.642, Speaker B: It was a very quick and succinct story that people could grok and understand, but that was our tip of the iceberg at that moment. What we had under the hood was, well, we worked across 20 different blockchains using different technologies. We understood the trade offs blockchains have to make when they focus on privacy. They use proof of work, they use proof of stake, they use proof of authority. We understood that deeply because of our kind of, you can call it wasted time of two years. So when we made or designed the kava blockchain, we saw all the issues that were looming with Ethereum, whether it's scaling gas fees, Oracle's not able to post prices, a number of attack vectors from flash loans and everything else. It was very obvious to us.
00:25:49.642 - 00:26:22.278, Speaker B: It wasn't obvious to the world, but it was obvious to us. Because we had got in there and we built payment channels for Dai and we did all this cross chain stuff, trying to work with different blockchains. And so when we designed kava, we kind of had this all in mind. So the product itself, the blockchain itself, is really the same as what we started with. But now we're finally just showing like, hey, it's not just makerdao for BTC. It's actually a bunch of infrastructure that we've been building over the past year. It's taken us millions of dollars and almost a year of our lives to build.
00:26:22.278 - 00:27:17.638, Speaker B: But now that it's all here, we have bridges to other blockchains, we have oracle infrastructure, we have a very secure, robust validator set, one of the best in the world. And anyone who builds an application now can build it and they get all that stuff for free. So anybody can kind of build and deploy a cross chain application without needing to build all that foundation that we've spent the time to do. And that's what we're showing to the world right now is, hey, look, Kava is really a Defi hub. It's meant to enable a new world of crosschain applications, and not just in the IBC kind of web three interoperable sense. It's like we've done a lot of the hard work to build bridges, to kind of like the fundamental blockchains that nobody else has. I think it's a service for the world.
00:27:17.638 - 00:27:38.650, Speaker B: And we think that what Kava has done in terms of the trade offs that we've made, every blockchain has to make trade offs, is that we've pulled all the levers, so we will be the strongest at providing security, reliability and quality in terms of Defi applications or financial services and applications.
00:27:38.810 - 00:28:14.246, Speaker A: And I guess we'll get into a little bit about what applications, and I guess a distinction between the applications that you build and perhaps this reference to community applications. But before we go into that, I just want to ask you a slightly higher level question, which is you're sat in the US, you are building enabling things in DeFi. How do you navigate that? Because obviously the US is probably one of the more challenging environments to be a Defi entrepreneur.
00:28:14.278 - 00:28:45.842, Speaker B: A. I mean, we can say that as a general statement, but at the same time it's like, where's compound? Well, they're sitting in where is, you know, Coinbase and the regulated exchanges. Many of them are in the US. I think that there are extra burdens that you just inherit with being A-U-S. Citizen. Outside of just globally taxed, no matter where you go, you have to pay the US government lots of money. You also have to deal with SEC and everything else.
00:28:45.842 - 00:30:01.994, Speaker B: And in 2017, it was much harder to deal with and navigate. We ended up working with the most prominent and expensive law firm in the world on our first token sale. Wasted lots of money, and they weren't even that helpful, where now people just sort of copy paste a token sale agreement and use that and it's considered kosher and fine. So there's a lot of different kind of learnings that have happened over the years, but our approach is we work with the best firms that lead the space in terms of law firms, accounting firms, and we make sure that everything that we do is not going to get us thrown in jail or even raise, really a strong eyebrow. We want to be seen as kind of the best intentioned actor, both in our actions as well as in terms of like, we hire the best experts that we can and work with them regardless if their answers are right or wrong. Our intentions as kind of people is to just take the best approach that we can. And what that ends up resulting in is just really large legal bills and other things that if you're not in crypto, you definitely couldn't afford those.
00:30:01.994 - 00:30:38.470, Speaker B: But thankfully, there's a lot of money and things are well funded here. So a lot of that can just go right over into the law firm's hands. And we actually work with specialist law firms. We have about five on our roster for different things. We have one for tax planning, we have one for just token issuance. We have one for some of the regulations around our different jurisdictions. So we operate in the US and Cayman, and we have some overseas offices now that we have to take into consideration.
00:30:38.470 - 00:31:44.270, Speaker B: But, yeah, generally we just try to be as buttoned up as we can, knowing that we live and swim in the Defi landscape, which is inherently a gray zone that our business is in. So we just have to kind of be as good as we can everywhere else. And if the world, or if the US says, sorry, I don't like defi anymore, and they do everything in their power to stop it, there's not a lot that we can do in that situation, but I don't think they will. I think it's just going to slowly become more of a clear framework or like a frame that as a company operator, you can operate within and meet all their requirements. And unfortunately, that usually means you're spending money on compliance and legal and other things to do that. But if you know the rules of the game and you have money, you should be able to play it and evaluate. Does it make sense to do that? Is that a positive expected value for your company? Yes or no? And some companies have just chosen not to operate in the US at all like exchanges, because it's just too costly.
00:31:44.270 - 00:32:43.790, Speaker B: Anyway, my final note on just your question is that DFI, at least from my conception and my understanding, is that 90% of it's actually happening in Asia. So when I think about our user base, I think much more about our korean and our chinese communities. The folks in Hong Kong and Singapore, they are the primary users of what we're building, and we should optimize most of our business around that. Whereas the US is less than 15%, I would say maximum 20% at a given point in time. It's probably more realistically around 10% in terms of DFI users. And people often, I think, overestimate how much impact the US has when it comes to the user base of crypto. For us, we just try to be as data oriented as we can.
00:32:43.790 - 00:32:53.700, Speaker B: And we know all of our users are in China and overseas in the other parts of Asia, so we just optimize for that wherever we look.
00:32:54.230 - 00:33:05.602, Speaker A: You seem very calm, so you must have comfort that you're navigating it well and you're still here, right? You're not in an orange jumpsuit, but I think it's promising.
00:33:05.746 - 00:33:07.720, Speaker B: No bag over my head yet.
00:33:08.430 - 00:33:27.998, Speaker A: I think it's promising to hear people with that attitude innovating in the US. As you say, it's not just you guys, but on the whole, certainly outside of the US, and large part inside it is perceived slightly differently. So let's get into karma, let's get into the application market.
00:33:28.084 - 00:34:17.614, Speaker B: I would love to do that, but I want to share one story first because I think it's really relevant. A point I would like to make is that no matter what roadblocks are there, regulatory, financial, whatever, there is always a way, and there is always something that can be done, people to be contacted, rules that could be bent. There's always something where you can find a path to your goal. And I learned that the hard way. When I was in university. I had this idea for a secondary market for equity, and I put together a plan. I shared it with my professor at the time and he looked at it and he was sort of a big shot who had worked at Microsoft and had his own startup and did all these other things.
00:34:17.614 - 00:34:52.186, Speaker B: So I really respected his opinion. And he said, oh no, the regulation you'll never be able to do that. There's no way you can kind of open up a secondary market to everyone. But then, you know what? Anyway, I packaged up that idea, threw it away and know, okay, that's probably not a good idea. I got to move on and try to find my next business idea. But two years later, this company called shares Post came out and they've been doing wonderful. You can buy Facebook equity, you can buy a bunch of stuff before it ever went public.
00:34:52.186 - 00:35:34.646, Speaker B: And that company is doing great. And now there's a bunch of me too companies copying it. And it's because they were able to see past the current regulation, see what could be in the future, and then started working towards that. And I think far too often people just kind of do what I did hear a no from someone, whether it's an investor, a close friend or whatever, and not have enough conviction themselves, pack it up and throw it away, where kind of the world is just full of possibilities and you can do whatever you want. And if you have a good idea, it is a good idea and it can exist in the world if you work hard enough. So just one of the learnings I've had.
00:35:34.828 - 00:36:13.998, Speaker A: Yeah, and look, I think never ask an expert for an opinion on the future. They know too much about the past. And equally, I think this is where it helps sometimes being a younger entrepreneur is that you find ways to do the impossible. But let's get into Carver. So you mentioned you've got all these applications. There's this reference to community applications. So how much of these are you building vertically and in house, and how much of them are, I'm guessing, this community application component.
00:36:14.174 - 00:37:02.978, Speaker B: Yeah. So the developers of the kava protocol to date have largely been kava labs. So in terms of the kava blockchain, how it's designed, the modules that exist within it, that's been largely like, we've led that initiative and we led with the first application as well. Hard to showcase kind of the capabilities and to show people, show other developers, hey, look, this is all here. It's super easy. Took very little code to do since we built all the hard stuff. Now you can do all this on kava very quickly and deploy apps that are much higher quality apps than what you could do on, say, Ethereum in a much shorter period of time.
00:37:02.978 - 00:38:18.042, Speaker B: And kind of going forward, many more third party developers will get involved and be pushing forward applications of their own. There is one caveat, though, that's a very important distinction of kava compared to other blockchains where most blockchains are open permissionless networks that anybody can write some code or smart contract and deploy it on the blockchain. The kava blockchain actually works as more of like an Apple store model where there's a vetting process for code and it's the kava holders which are, I would say, if I was to try to qualify them. They're like the technical teams at Binance Huabi, bunch of the staking infrastructure companies like Figment, chorus one. They hold all the voting power of kava and they review kind of any submissions or governance proposals for upgrades or new applications or new code to be deployed on the kava blockchain. And what this does is it gatekeeps while it limits sort of the speed of iteration, what you see on Ethereum, people are just forking things, deploying it. Code is running kind of all over the place.
00:38:18.042 - 00:39:21.738, Speaker B: You have great things happening, but you also have great explosions happening with a lot of the fork projects just losing a lot of money. Deforce being one of the more interesting examples where they copied compounds code, didn't really understand it, deployed it, and then had $25 million drained from the contract overnight. That stuff won't happen on kava because we have this very stringent process to get code live, but once it's there, the end user actually has a much better experience. They know any app on kava is like in the Apple Store, a very high quality app that's been reviewed by over 100 different businesses. It's gone through auditing process, it's gone through a deep internal testing process with the teams and it's run on a testnet. And you can't say the same of kind of applications that are launched elsewhere. So it's a view that we've taken with this blockchain that I think makes us very unique and it does make iterating a bit slower.
00:39:21.738 - 00:39:28.770, Speaker B: But what it means is what does get developed is going to be of much higher quality and the end users can kind of trust it for reliability.
00:39:29.110 - 00:39:50.738, Speaker A: Understood. So is that to be able to serve a newbie or is that to be able to serve a more sophisticated user? Who do you think is going to appreciate that offering? Or is it not that specific? It's just because you think this is more of a kind of platformed approach, the right thing to do long term?
00:39:50.834 - 00:40:29.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. That's a great question. So there's a few reasons. The first is we're taking this curated approach. One, because we want to make sure that we know how all the code on kava interacts with each other and be very confident of that. So on the Ethereum ecosystem, because it's just an open, smart contracting platform, you have all these weird attack vectors like flash loans and circular transactions and all sorts of stuff happening there, and we can catch that all before it goes live. And that is something that I think is very important.
00:40:29.550 - 00:41:26.630, Speaker B: There's not going to be any sort of eyebrow raising code that lives on the blockchain that could be used for malicious purposes. On Kava, everything is just very purpose specific, and it's been tested to interact with all the other pieces that live there. So that's actually a big reason why we've taken this approach, just because it gives more safety to both the blockchain and the applications that live on it. And that ultimately is just a much better and safer user experience for people who are putting a lot of money at stake when it comes to financial applications like these. The second thing that we focus on is actually integrations. So you mentioned earlier, kind of DFI is very limited to who's using it. Today I saw a Kraken report that said out of all their top traders, 93% still haven't used DFI at all, which is that was both surprising and not surprising.
00:41:26.630 - 00:42:43.498, Speaker B: We see the future is really making things accessible to first retail and crypto, but then the broader retail sector of just people who invest in things, people who spend money, and how we see that evolution is today. We need to have a very high quality application and a high quality experience. So when a developer at a centralized platform wants to offer it up and make it more accessible, not just to the technical audience who can custody their own funds, or the diehard cryptos that 7%, but they want to open it up to the other 93% of crypto traders that they know that if their neck is not going to be on the line, they're actually going to be giving their users value if they integrate a kava product. And that's why we've seen, kind of despite us not being on the blockchain, that people know Ethereum and that they know how to work with. They're going above and beyond at binance and places like Bitmax, they're directly integrating kava and now hard the money market thing and giving that to their users in like a simple, seamless one click. I can put my money in in one click. They don't ever have to take their funds off an exchange.
00:42:43.498 - 00:43:42.180, Speaker B: It's a much nicer user experience. So when we have optimized everything that we've done here at kava in terms of quality, what that really means, as well as we're focused on enterprise folks like that, we want to have these integrations, and ideally we want to have them in even more broader fintech apps, like your Robin Hoods or whatever else, so that a user can just say, oh yeah, I want to earn 1015 20% on my stablecoin, click one button and it's just sort of done within the app. And it's a much more risky proposition for these centralized parties to do something with an unproven DFI app. On Ethereum or even some of the larger ones, there's still just a lot of risks, given the nature of solidity and all the attack vectors where with kava they can be quite certain kind of what's going on on the blockchain, and they're kind of in control, they're still in the driver's seat, despite working with a DeFi platform.
00:43:42.550 - 00:44:36.550, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it's smart in that I'm a big believer that fintech, classic fintech, if we can call it that, will serve as distribution channels for DeFi and therefore having. I don't want to use an intermediary as a term, but like a bridge that allows for the removal of risk and I guess the testing of product in a controlled environment rather than just out in the wild. I can see why that might appeal more to a typical fintech startup. So, specifically, what kind of attack vectors do you remove from this process? Is it oracle attacks, is it flash loans? And what can be done with flash loans? Is it just rug pulls?
00:44:38.730 - 00:45:27.540, Speaker B: We've really addressed most of those things. Of course, there's always going to be that 1% attack that's just so hard to foresee, despite what audits and precautions you've taken. But just to put some things into context, on kava, you don't have to hold the kava token to send other coins that exist on kava, like our stablecoin. On Ethereum, you need to hold ETH, and you need to pay some gas fees if you're going to send and receive Dai, for example. That's actually a horrible user experience for anyone outside of crypto, but they might want to hold a stablecoin. It's not just dai, it's USDC, it's USDT. And on kava, because we've designed as a proof of stake system, we've actually been able to have.
00:45:27.540 - 00:46:15.406, Speaker B: Well, we have something called feeless transactions, where people don't have to pay fees and they get put into a queue. And if you want priority to get transactions through faster, it normally gets processed very quickly. But there are occasions where people write bots and sort of spam the chain to do a particular activity. If you just put a very small fee, that transaction kind of goes to the top of the line. A validator takes it and processes it for you within a few seconds. But what's important on kava is because we've designed it this way, you actually can pay your fee in any token you hold. So if it's USDX or if it's kava, if it's hard, if it's BNB, you can pay within the currency that you hold, which makes the user experience so much nicer.
00:46:15.406 - 00:47:37.582, Speaker B: You don't have to worry about calculating or managing your portfolio risk across multiple assets, particularly maybe assets that you don't even want exposure to. I think for stablecoins and payments, just as a use case, that's particularly important, it makes it much more akin to a PayPal transfer, Venmo or Zelle. If you don't have to think about holding some weird speculative crypto asset, you could just hold a stablecoin and transact with that. And then the last point, there's many here, but in terms of attack vectors with flash loans and kind of batching transactions and doing that, because we didn't design everything in solidity, we've designed everything in Golang, which is a much more verifiable language. We can actually have very discrete modules that only accept very specific inputs from users. And we can kind of test and be quite certain that the outputs from those contracts do exactly what we intend them to do, and nothing else, which includes interact with other contracts or other modules or other applications that live on our blockchain. So one of the things that, like I said, that we were protecting against is, while I think flash loans have a great use in terms of making markets efficient, it's very important to be able to understand kind of the scope of where they can impact things.
00:47:37.582 - 00:47:48.690, Speaker B: And on cava, we can do exactly that. So we can introduce them in the right places and only those places. And that's really something that you only can do if you've built an environment kind of with these things in mind.
00:47:48.840 - 00:48:11.270, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, one shameless plug. You should definitely speak to Agorick if you haven't. We had Marcus Miller on the show a while back, and they're doing interesting things with Cosmos and IBC, and I know there's that linkage there with Cosmos to allow for greater complexity at the contracting layer.
00:48:12.250 - 00:48:19.638, Speaker B: Yeah, Mark's brilliant. I have a lot of friends over there and they're definitely building some very interesting things for cosmos.
00:48:19.734 - 00:48:56.760, Speaker A: So I guess a big question is, directionally, I think the approach makes a lot of sense, certainly as an alternative. Right. I know some people, some purists just won't like it, but the reality is you need a universe of options if we're to onboard not just more people in crypto, but beyond the existing crypto, holder, user, trader, speculator, whatever it is. And I think this makes total sense. Do you have a house view currently on compliance and KyC and AmL yet?
00:48:57.790 - 00:49:44.680, Speaker B: Well, as a DeFi platform. Well, actually as our company, all we really do is we run some Twitter handles for our different projects and we ship code to GitHub and what goes live on the blockchain. So unlike other companies, we actually run no nodes on our own network. We have no control over our own network. We do hold a lot of kava and we can influence votes to some degree, but everything has to get voted on by the greater group of kava holders into a network upgrade. So in terms of compliance, because we don't have control there, we don't really have to comply with much. It's not even in our hands, and we can't really be held responsible for it because of that.
00:49:44.680 - 00:50:21.890, Speaker B: There are things like, we do run some of the apps on our website, there's other options. There's third party developers like Cosmo Station and Frontier. And of course, the centralized exchanges I mentioned that offer up direct integrations to our products as well. But because we do operate interfaces, we don't really collect kind of any data. We make sure that we're compliant in kind of anything that our website is doing and what people might be doing within the applications. But that's kind of where the buck stops. We just make sure that we're kind of buttoned up in terms of GDPR and all those things.
00:50:21.890 - 00:50:40.890, Speaker B: But there isn't really a whole lot in terms of KYC and AML because those aren't really our customers. We're not actually in control of their funds. They're in the driver's seat the whole time. So we can't take the view that we need to be responsible for KYC and AML. Interesting.
00:50:40.960 - 00:50:55.598, Speaker A: So it's non custodial and then also you're not active in the node infrastructure, especially in the US context. That removes a lot of the burden, as you say.
00:50:55.764 - 00:51:25.670, Speaker B: Yeah, and as I was saying, with any type of code that we even suggest the network to adopt. It's the nodes that ultimately say, like, yes or no, and then they run it on their servers. We don't have control over what they run. I wouldn't say we necessarily had the very specific foresight to operate in this way, but in terms of regulation within the US, it is very beneficial. It turns out that we've designed a system in this way and kind of have taken these stances.
00:51:28.250 - 00:51:32.746, Speaker A: Yeah, well, let's put it down to genius, right? I mean, I hate to just put.
00:51:32.768 - 00:51:34.230, Speaker B: Things down to or luck.
00:51:34.390 - 00:52:13.010, Speaker A: Yeah, no, let's just say it's genius. That's the easiest way. Look, Brian, it's great to talk to you. As I said, I think it's a really interesting, novel alternative. I can see it definitely has a place in the ecosystem, and I can see it also onboarding more people into the space, enabling the onboarding of more people into the space. So I'm looking forward to watching how the space evolves. Is there anything specifically that you would like to mention to listeners about how they can get involved in various things, or how can they follow you? How can they get involved in the project somehow?
00:52:13.090 - 00:52:59.262, Speaker B: So I would highly recommend anyone who is currently hodling some BTC to earn a yield off of that. You should plop it into the hard money market. It's currently offering about 20% APY in a noncustodial fashion. So if you are so inclined to put something on a trust wallet or ledger and use a DFI app, I would highly recommend doing that. Or with stablecoins, currently BUSD is getting about 28% on our application. So if you're trying to earn more money, just put any assets that you're holding into a money market and you'll earn more. So that would be the first.
00:52:59.262 - 00:53:21.418, Speaker B: And then if you find what we're doing interesting and you want to develop on kava, or you just want to get in touch, or you want to speak about anything in particular, like an integration of some sort, please feel free to reach out.
