00:00:23.130 - 00:01:10.740, Speaker A: So welcome to Diffusion Live. This is a new format that we're trialing on LinkedIn, where we invite an analyst from crypto that we like to come and deep dive into a recent thesis of theirs. So today we've got Matty, aka DCL blogger, and he'll be talking about his 25 industries being disrupted by NFTS tweet storm, mega tweet storm that was made back on September the 11th. Of all days, it's got close to 100 likes, 50 retweets. It's really done the rounds within crypto. I think it's introduced a huge portion of that population into what's going on in nfts and driven a lot of interest. So before we do, quick intro to nfts for those that are new to the space.
00:01:10.740 - 00:02:15.110, Speaker A: So by NFT, I mean a non fungible token based on the Ethereum ERC seven two one and ERC one one five. Ethereum standards. A non fungible token, also known as an IFD, is a special type of cryptographic token which, unlike a fungible token, represents something unique. Non fungible tokens are therefore not mutually interchangeable by their individual specification, like a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin or ethereum. These two standards allow for all kinds of unique programmable digital goods of multiple token types and characteristics, including social currencies, rewards, collectibles, access tokens, digital art, loyalty points, and digital to physical good kind of redemption. So as suggested, Matty believes there are at least 25 types and growing of instances of nfts. And if you look at the data behind it again, something he's going to talk about today, you can see that we're definitely moving in the direction of exponential growth.
00:02:15.110 - 00:02:50.714, Speaker A: So some background on our guest. Firstly, welcome Matty. So I've been following you for a while on Twitter. I know you as DCL blogger. At DCL Blogger, I believe a reference to Decentraland, which was the thing that brought you into the NFT space. You've got a similarly named YouTube channel with a pretty decent number of subscribers now, I think it's well over 2000. You are based out in Melbourne, Australia, and you describe yourself as a virtual land and NFT investor.
00:02:50.714 - 00:02:52.494, Speaker A: Did I miss anything out there?
00:02:52.612 - 00:02:53.930, Speaker B: It's pretty accurate.
00:02:54.090 - 00:03:14.520, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So what we're going to do is we're going to hand over to you now. You're going to walk us through that mega thread and give us some of your thinking that informed it. I'm sure a lot of the numbers have already changed since September 11. So I don't know if you've got any updates to those. And then hopefully we can have a discussion about that as we go.
00:03:16.330 - 00:03:48.670, Speaker B: Yeah. So thanks, Jamie and Roland and the team at Outlier ventures for having me. It's my pleasure. It's my honor. I kind of got into the NFT space about three years from now, three years before, and it was kind of my world, right? I found this whole world on blockchain where people were trading digital assets and each one of them had an arbitrary value. It wasn't defined because each one was unique. So it was just like this hotbed of people trying to sell assets, and one day they'd value it at $1,000, the next day they'd value it at $3,000.
00:03:48.670 - 00:05:00.626, Speaker B: So anyway, there's this whole interest that was just kind of overwhelming and really got me into the space. So I'm going to quickly just skim through this thread. But I think the best thing to do is go through some examples to kind of show you guys visually exactly how they relate. I probably don't have the time, and it probably bore you guys for me to go through each 25. So the NFTs, as Jamie defined, are kind of like a digital receipt, right? So it's kind of like when blockchain was kind of realized and people kind of started to hit them and people were like, wait a second, with this blockchain and this open public ledger, we can just do so much. And then over the years, people found Ethereum was born and multiple projects were born utilizing blockchain technology. And NFTs are kind of the same, buz where people are realizing, wait a second, we can attach a receipt to a digital asset and suddenly things like art, things like virtual land, things like avatars, wearables, game assets, game items, even boss characters, and everything digital can now have some sort of an ownership timestamped quality attached to it where the whole world can verify on blockchain.
00:05:00.626 - 00:05:34.686, Speaker B: So it was an idea and it was kind of put into, and I might start with these guys before we go there, we'll just kind of quickly skim through some of the big industries that are forming art. Seems to be a really big one. We've seen some pieces go for $50,000. We've seen some artists drop multiple pieces and then sell out $100,000 worth each. Art is connected to an NFT. So technically you're buying this non fungible token that lives on your metamask wallet or whichever wallet you're using at the time. And that represents your ownership.
00:05:34.686 - 00:06:10.510, Speaker B: And people can verify that ownership on blockchain and make sure it came from the artist's account. And therefore, there's that sort of connection that gives it that value, right? That you can't fake, that you can't make a new account that's similar to the artist that's verified and replicate that. Well, you can, but there's a way to authenticate the original piece with this NFT. So there's that. There's virtual land. So if you've kind of been into Decentraland, you know that you can buy this virtual land, which is just like this piece of virtual space in this big map. And you can see here, we were kind of running a conference and we built a conference center.
00:06:10.510 - 00:06:43.270, Speaker B: A GDA capital came through and they brought across some leaders in the industry. We jumped in and you can see some of the stuff that we're wearing. This guy's wearing a hat, a barbarian hat. That is one out of ten items. It's a mythic item in Decentraland, which is extremely rare. So you can imagine once this space has millions of people, there's only one out of ten. So that scarcity you verified by blockchain, it's going to give people the value, right? So these hats sell for about 5000 mana, which is about 350 to 500 usd.
00:06:43.270 - 00:07:05.438, Speaker B: Some of these items, these masks are quite rare. They were one of the first masks ever to be introduced in Decentraland. So people in the decentraland world, they understand the quality. And when you jump in the world and you see people with these helmets and these masks, you're like, oh, holy crap. You were one of the ogs that were part of this world one year ago. So virtual land, you can see somnium space here. VR focus.
00:07:05.438 - 00:07:54.894, Speaker B: They had the burning man contest, burning man event, crypto voxel, similar type of thing, and axie infinity, which also have virtual land and are building an axie, kind of a Pokemon type tamagotchi world. And each of these assets are ownable by the nfTs. As I mentioned previously, you got games. So game assets like items, skins, they're pretty, quite no brainers, right? And traditionally, when you buy skins and stuff in Warcraft or games like that, they've kind of lived in that ecosystem. You can't really pull it out and take it to another game. That's not possible with blockchain, because it's an NFT and it kind of lives in your wallet and verifiable. Whether the game exists or not, you're going to have that NFT, right? So someone can make another game and recognize that NFT and give it value in the other game.
00:07:54.894 - 00:08:24.558, Speaker B: So it could be a wearable in one game, it could be a sword in another, it could be a pet in another. And that's something the engine community does really well, trading card games. So cards, for example, gods unchained, some of the mythics sold for like $60,000. Crypto punks. We'll get into this later. Collectibles. So crypto collectibles is synonymous to NFTs because that was kind of the first industry that blew up before what we see now, even domain names and wallet names.
00:08:24.558 - 00:09:05.830, Speaker B: So things like eth, these are nfTs. So you own them, you own the NFT. And the good thing about that is it creates a secondary marketplace because suddenly you own the asset, right? So you can sell that asset. So as the game appreciates and the ecosystem grows with the user base, then your asset will become more valuable. And traditionally, like in Runescape, it's not encouraged to sell your name if you claim a name, it's rare to have that name because each name is unique, but you don't own that name. In Decentraland, for example, you can own a name which is an NFT which you can sell. So if you have an early name that someone wants, it's encouraged to sell it because most marketplaces and companies make their money through fees.
00:09:05.830 - 00:09:44.450, Speaker B: Anyway, like I said, we'll go through some examples, but the thread is 25 posts long. So I do encourage people to go through it. It got a ton of shares and likes and hopefully introduce everyone to the NFT space. Like I said, I've been immersed into this in last two or three years, so I'm pretty deep into surrounding myself with this sort of. So NFTs, on a macro basis is kind of like represents things like digital art, digital land, digital cards. And my entry to the NFT world was stumbling upon a project called Decentraland, where you could buy pixels of land. So this is the Decentraland map.
00:09:44.450 - 00:10:21.626, Speaker B: So, for example, this purple area here is called the Crypto Valley district. The crypto Valley district. Each land, or each pixel is 16 x 16 meters in the virtual world. And the crypto valley has finance. Us have a headquarters there, GDA Capital, Maddox. We've got like 15 to 20 headquarters jumping in there and building some sort of a virtual base because it's smart contract enabled. Technically, you can trade in finance on the virtual world, you can tip people, you can integrate smart contract operations, and basically everything you can do on websites, you can technically do it in a visual way in Decentraland.
00:10:21.626 - 00:10:52.166, Speaker B: So this was kind of my entry. And I was realizing, wait a second, people are buying and selling these pieces of land for like a few thousand mana each. I think it was like 2000, 3000 mana each. Back then it was like $100, $200. And each value, each land had a coordinate attached to it. So for example, if I were to click this land here, it's parcel number 40, 216. And once I buy that, I get an NFT that represents that parcel, right? And then I get the ability to build whatever I want on there.
00:10:52.166 - 00:11:40.918, Speaker B: So anyone in Decentraland, as they're traversing through the world, they stumble upon my content, they can see it, I can market stuff, I can build conferences, build games, galleries, blah, blah, blah, et cetera. So that was my entry. And I was realizing, wait a second, people, I can negotiate prices here. So I would go and find someone that's selling ten pieces of land, maybe some of them connected to roads, maybe some of them connected to really popular districts, and I would negotiate with them, buy them at a bulk price and sell them over the course of a week for a profit. And for me, coming from a cryptocurrency background, this is like this whole industry, that each item had its own value. And some items I'd buy for like a few hundred dollars and sell them for like $5,000 because people didn't really know the value of things, right? The people that traded often, they understood the value and realized what things could go for. And over time, as now the industry is developing, people are realizing some sort of a base level value.
00:11:40.918 - 00:12:18.590, Speaker B: But that was kind of my entry. And like I said, in Decentralland, you can do all kinds of things. You can run conferences, people have galleries, so you can interact with the wall and buy items and art straight off the wall, run games, et cetera. And art is just blowing up. I'm thinking art is kind of becoming its own industry by itself, because suddenly you can attach an artist's digital piece to blockchain and a sense of ownership, and traditionally you couldn't do that. What do you do with a digital piece? You download it, you give it to someone. Maybe you go to an exhibition as an artist and you sell usbs.
00:12:18.590 - 00:13:07.700, Speaker B: What do you actually do? And even if you sell the usbs, maybe you sign it, that's your receipt. But there's no way to look back and publicly verify that me, Maddie, bought this USB, this digital piece, that's a one of a kind from this artist, there's no way to tie that in. So blockchain has allowed that to happen. And suddenly these digital artists that were maybe really popular on Sketchfab or deviant art and multiple platforms and marketplaces, they can monetize their work. They can sell a one of one. So, for example, this piece here, Picasso's bull, this artist came in and sold one version of the main Picasso's bull, then three versions of a gold, ten versions of a silver, 25 versions of a bronze. The main one sold for 55,000 usd, and I think it holds the record for a single piece.
00:13:07.700 - 00:13:26.890, Speaker B: No, I think that was recently broken, actually. We'll go through that. And he sold three pieces of this Picasso's bull, and I think each one sold for like 1000 or something. But the bronze one is quite interesting. It sold for $200 apiece. Maybe I have to click into it. So we go through the silver one.
00:13:26.890 - 00:13:55.762, Speaker B: So nifty. Gateway is a kind of a art platform where popular artists come and do weekly drops. So every week the parent company is Gemini. So run by the winkle boss twins. They've got this arm run by the cock foster brothers, and they drop art, like every week. They collaborate with an artist, and the artist comes and drops digital art. So everyone rushes here and picks this art up.
00:13:55.762 - 00:14:36.346, Speaker B: They bought a Fiat gateway and bought this piece for $750. And you can see that. I think it's been like, what, July 23? Is that a couple of months? July, August, September. So, yeah, it's been a couple of months since then. And although people picked up them at a flat rate of 750, the recent sale, the highest recent sale was $3,500. And if you go to the bronze, it's quite rare to get this, because Trevor Jones, who's the artist for this, is quite popular in the crypto space, and he's doing collaborations with Jose Delbo, who's a Marvel comic artist who's 87 years old, and he's done a lot of work with earlier comics like Superman and Batman, et cetera. So they're doing a collaboration.
00:14:36.346 - 00:15:15.482, Speaker B: So this one sold for $200 each, 25 of them, and it was last sold for $4,200. So you can see that people, there's a big appetite for the secondary market. In fact, there's a big appetite for buying art, and the traditional art world is quite big, and we'll kind of jump into that a little bit. Super air, another art platform marked to that. They had just passed the $2 million milestone for money earned by artists. $675,000 was money earned by collectors. So I guess people that flipped art bought it at a price and sold it at a price.
00:15:15.482 - 00:15:41.006, Speaker B: That's the difference of the profit. The collective or cumulative profit that was earned. The last million dollars came in the last four months. Previous to that, I think Superair were active for two years. So you can see that they're starting to reach a momentum now that's increasing at quite a high level. Superair is unique in the sense that each asset that's released there is a one of one. So if you buy the art there, it's only a single piece, but nifty.
00:15:41.006 - 00:16:20.962, Speaker B: Gateway and some other platforms, you can make a piece and you can have 25 versions of it. And if you're one of the 25 owners and you own one of the 25 pieces, token angels who recently purchased this bitcoin piece, which changes if you can see it changing with the price of bitcoin, right. It sold for $100,000. 262 ethereum so a pretty big piece there. I don't know if it was made by a single person. Looks like it has Matt Kane artist and it was mentioned in multiple websites. So investing.com,
00:16:20.962 - 00:17:07.838, Speaker B: Yahoo Finance Market Watch picked it up. And this is not a freak buy. It's not like there's never been a piece that sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is $100,000 buy and previously there was $50,000. In fact, there's been pieces that have sold for 1015, $20,000. So people have an appetite for digital art represented as nfts. And slowly with the whole NFT space growing and a bunch of artists jumping in and realizing what this can do for them, and a lot of collectors that I guess have become rich from holding cryptocurrency and want to diversify their assets, maybe want to protect the volatility of their assets and want to park it in something that appreciates in time, then digital art seems to be the play.
00:17:07.838 - 00:17:48.414, Speaker B: This article just came out recently from Coindesk and Christie's to auction bitcoin inspired artwork associated with a non fungible token. How cool is that? This was, I think, 24 hours old, this piece of news. So 40 paintings. I think each painting is going to be represented as an NFT and they have a price here, prices ranging between $12,000 to $18,000. So suddenly there are some large, I guess, organizations paying attention, getting the attention that it needs. And art is just one line or one of the 25 things that I covered on my thread. So again, it's kind of like that realization where when blockchain tech came out, you were like, wait a second, this can do a lot.
00:17:48.414 - 00:18:25.642, Speaker B: And it hit developers, it hit investors in different ways, and people experimented with it, branched off into different areas. It's kind of happening with NFTs as well as people are understanding what can be done with it. We have pomp, Anthony Pompliano, I believe his name is his full name, but obviously a very popular, prolific figure in the crypto space. His next bet. And he made a post about it and thesis. His next bet is digital art. And he commissioned an artist called Ferocious, who surprisingly, I bought four pieces of ferocious art literally two weeks ago.
00:18:25.642 - 00:18:54.738, Speaker B: So I got extremely lucky. And it was weird because I saw a tweet on one of the videos and there was like a comment from Pomp saying, hey, you're my favorite artist. So I was like, oh, wait a second. Maybe pomp might be getting into NFT art. So I purchased like four pieces and then pomp like two weeks later posted this saying he's going really big on NFT art and one of the artists is ferocious. And you can see his thesis over here. And he says that the digital art market cap is less than $10 million at the moment.
00:18:54.738 - 00:19:50.660, Speaker B: Traditional art market is more than $60 billion. So he believes that it's going to reach that or flip that or attract that. I believe it will, just because at the end of the day, cryptocurrency industry is insane, right? There's so much money tied into the crypto space. Bitcoin people have become rich from holding bitcoin for a couple of, it's a very kind of investment friendly area space. People like to throw money at things, and art, as the awareness for holding onto them increases, then this art space should increase. I know a lot of the information and feedback that I'm getting and questions that I'm getting from that Twitter thread. And just my positioning as an NFT guy has been what do I look for in an artist to invest? Or how do I invest in artists and art? And what is this thing? So I think the art market might have this sudden kind of awareness spike, whether it be the traditional digital market.
00:19:50.660 - 00:20:15.230, Speaker B: So again, let's just kind of move past the art. I know I've kind of stuck on that for a bit, but you can see that the potential is there. But NFTs can do a lot of things. They can be game assets. So you can see axie Infinity, kind of like a Tamagotchi Pokemon inspired game, and download the app. There's about quite a lot of people that play the game. What's interesting is if you check out the secondary market, it's quite buzzing.
00:20:15.230 - 00:20:58.762, Speaker B: In the last 30 days, there's been almost half a million dollars worth of sales of these items. You can buy digital land, which they're releasing the feature for. You can buy items that give you boosts based on where your axe is. People are bundling things like ten lands, et cetera. These axes, they all have different variations of items or features that have different strengths and moves. And it's kind of like a strategy game, right? And I mean, it sounds cool, and maybe some people don't get it because they're not into games, but at the end of the day, the money speaks for itself. Half a million dollars worth of transaction volume on a secondary marketplace from people buying and selling assets to each other.
00:20:58.762 - 00:21:22.034, Speaker B: Maybe some are rarer than the others, stronger than the others. Maybe some land is located closer than other places. This is axie. Infinity is one of many, many games I'm sure we will see in the NFT space. But in terms of gaming, it seems like it's got a very healthy position. Defi, we're all familiar with Defi. Probably way more familiar than me.
00:21:22.034 - 00:22:00.282, Speaker B: I kind of understand from a face value what it is, what it does. But NFT and Defi crossing over has got me to look into it a lot more. Obviously, being a protocol where you can lock your funds up. Technically, most people, they lock their funds up to earn some revenue, right? Get some yield, whether it be locking it up into a liquidity pool or lending it out to people on Ave. But traditionally what's happened is products like Uniswap, you park your money in there, they pay you a bit of the fees that they get from people swapping their currencies. Now, what projects are experimenting with, and this don't buyme.com with the meme ticker.
00:22:00.282 - 00:22:26.870, Speaker B: You got to look past the meme ticker. I know it's funny, but it's so interesting what's happening here, because what they're doing is they've released the meme coin, which is currently sitting at like $800. It's gone bonkers, up like 1000% since 30 days. It was airdropped for free to like 73 people. So 73 people got about 350 meme each for free. And no one really thought anything was going to happen of it. But they ended up making a product.
00:22:26.870 - 00:23:08.050, Speaker B: The product being that if you provide liquidity for the meme e pair, you take your lp tokens, you take your lp tokens, and you can stake that into their website, the meme protocol. You take your lp tokens and you manage your stake and you stake it. You can see I got 17 meme coins and I can stake it, and then I can earn something called pineapples. Pineapples, I guess, are points, right? And those points, you can actually cash them in for rare nfTs. So this NFT, where we go, of Vitalik, you got Sergey. So two minted of eight left, you need 75 pineapples. I think like five.
00:23:08.050 - 00:23:44.558, Speaker B: You get like five a day. I know it's kind of meme and funny, but it kind of opens up this thing of the reward portal, the reward part of things, of an ecosystem where you stake your money or you provide value to the ecosystem is moving beyond just ERC 20 distribution. You can reward people with nfts. In this case, it's just a digital collectible. But in the future, it could be an NFT that gives you access to a virtual world or vip room, an NFT that gives you airdrop capabilities. If you have that NFT, you'll get airdrop things along the way. Suddenly, with this NFT, so many things become possible.
00:23:44.558 - 00:24:08.774, Speaker B: So this kind of intersect between Defi and crypto and nfTs. And subsequently, people really wanted to collect these things. I had openc. Yeah. So here we go. The legendary cards that were minted. You can see the last purchase price was 77 Ethereum 47 Ethereum for this one, one of ten.
00:24:08.774 - 00:24:52.866, Speaker B: The Andre Cronier legendary. People love collecting things like collectibles was the trajectory that NFTs took at the start. We'll cover that right at the end. But suddenly, while staking, not only are you getting the fees or the yield part of the fees on Uniswap, but you're also getting a chance of getting an NFT that's rare and that can appreciate over time. So that's why the meme token has gone nuts, because people are buying more of it and they're staking it, trying to get more nfTs. And what don't buy meme is doing is they're dropping artists, they're doing artist collaborations, and you can stake even more meme. And obviously it's beneficial to them because it locks up the meme token, removes it from supply.
00:24:52.866 - 00:25:39.138, Speaker B: And the people that are trying to farm these, they can get special artist collaboration pieces. And Sven is an artist that has sold pieces for six to seven Ethereum. So you're getting something that's quite special, connected to an artist that has history and they're looking to do collaborations in the future that kind of gives you an idea of how DFI and NFTs can intersect. We have metazone that provide digital assets. So kind of like buildings, 3d models, avatars, games, you can even get like a whole arcade game. And basically you can buy these and deploy them on your scene in Decentraland. So when you're buying them at the moment you're just buying I guess the rights to the game, but they're going tokenize these or have some sort of a token that identifies your ownership with these.
00:25:39.138 - 00:26:17.742, Speaker B: And if you click on them that they have scarcity, right? So if you click on this game, this is a collaboration with a popular project called Ethermon. And Ethermon have this thing where you can get eggs and these eggs hatch on these lands. So if you deploy them there's only like 100 of them. So you'll get like this special ethermon on your land. So these are kind of like, it's kind of like an App Store with each app or item being an NFT, or at least that's the plan. So you can see the use case suddenly is so much bigger than what we used to see. So I think what are we at? 845.
00:26:17.742 - 00:26:49.286, Speaker B: Okay, so I think I'll end with this. So the collectibles, like I said, it kind of started the industry, right? So what we started with, and I'm kind of going backwards here, I should have started with this, but I'll end with it now that you guys have an idea. But crypto punks, if you guys remember, were like these 10,000 unique collectible characters. They don't really do much at all. They're just 10,000 unique pieces. You buy a crypto punk, you own one of the 10,000. But the special thing about crypto punks is that it was the first, I guess, crypto collectible or NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
00:26:49.286 - 00:27:12.462, Speaker B: In fact it was pre ERC 721 standard. It kind of inspired the ERC 721 standard, but it was a proof of concept. And I believe the way they released this into the wild was they just released 9000 punks. The creators just held onto 1000. They released 9000 punks in the wild. They got covered by Mashable and suddenly people rushed to collect the rest of them. And within like a day or two they were all collected.
00:27:12.462 - 00:27:34.074, Speaker B: And each crypto punk has different assets. You can see some are smoking, some have yellow hair, glasses, blah, blah, blah. And each one has kind of a unique trait. So I'm going to see if I can open one. So I'll just click on this guy over here. And you can see only 289 punks have this trait of a normal beard. Black.
00:27:34.074 - 00:27:52.426, Speaker B: So this black one, Mohawk, thin. Only 441 punks have this specific mohawk. So there's some punks that have extremely rare traits. And you can see here this one was sold. It's an ape punk. There's only 24 of these, I believe, out of the 10,000. So pretty damn rare.
00:27:52.426 - 00:28:40.990, Speaker B: This was recently sold for 54,000 usd on September 18, up from 6300. Crazy in eight months that happened. So crypto collectibles, you all probably know cryptokitties, but as a collectible use case of a collectible or just an asset that sits in your wallet that is special because the community deems it to be special, has a big use case. NBA topshots, they've released this sort of a collectible card project where you can collect moments so you can actually collect gifs and short videos that live in this. I'm waiting for it to show the. But like it goes through a gameplay moment video of that particular play. So it's got, um.
00:28:40.990 - 00:29:07.746, Speaker B: Here you go. So this play, I'm not that big into NBA, so I don't really understand the players. But you own that play. So this is an official partnership with NBA. They've come on and released this on the flow blockchain, which is a product by Dapper Labs. I believe the guys behind cryptokitties and some of these moments have gone for like $4,000 because the NBA crowd has come in and they're big on this. So they're collecting from popular players and popular plays, and some items are legendary, et cetera, et cetera.
00:29:07.746 - 00:29:55.394, Speaker B: So this whole collectible card thing in the real world, Tamagotchi's token. In the real world, you had cars, you had like Beyblades. In my world, we had like, what do they call Tarzos and all this kind of stuff, right? So now in the digital world, because it could be connected to an NFT, they've got things like this. So we got also metafactory. So if I go back to my Twitter thread, I've probably gone through about only five or six of these. Again, there's just so much happening. We have wearables, right? So I mentioned how those wearables in Decentraland, so you can see metafactory here, which sell the real world hoodie, but that's connected to a wearable that you can wear in projects like Decentraland or crypto voxels.
00:29:55.394 - 00:30:23.034, Speaker B: And the funny thing is that sometimes the digital version of this has more value than the real version of this as people want to kind of flaunt it and kind of walk through the virtual worlds with it. It's rare. It has a limit supply cap. So there's two positions of value you're getting here with these two. So that's about the main ones. Multiple things happening. Like Niftex is coming out with some sort of trying to unlock more liquidity to nfts.
00:30:23.034 - 00:30:51.202, Speaker B: Traditionally they're hard to sell. So kind of you can shard your NFT. And maybe I have a digital land that's worth like $50,000. I can break that into ERC 20 tokens. By breaking, you're technically just locking it up and releasing a new set of tokens that have 10,000 or 20,000 worth that people can buy and sell and own a piece of that NFT. So that's happening there. You have Gabby here who sold insurance as nfts.
00:30:51.202 - 00:31:31.522, Speaker B: So I think it's yield finance. Yield insurance. Something where, oh well, Nexus, I forgot the name, the underwriter, I think it's nexus digital or something. But you can get insurance on your liquidity pool when you're doing stuff with DFI, right? So those are getting wrapped as nfts and being sold on the marketplaces. So there's a time where 5000 e worth of nfts of insurance was sold on the secondary marketplace as nfts. So cars, gold backed trophies. So in Decentraland we held a cup, that soccer game that you saw over here.
00:31:31.522 - 00:32:04.750, Speaker B: So the winner of this, this was 24 projects that came together to play a five verse five soccer game. Pretty simple game, kind of just testing the technology and the capability of what decentraland can do. The winner got an Nft and that NFt was minted using DGX. And if you guys know DGX, each coin is backed by 1 gram of gold. So this was minted using one DGX. So the base value of this gold cup NFT was 1 gram of gold. So it's pretty cool because you're technically getting a gold trophy as an NFT.
00:32:04.750 - 00:32:37.142, Speaker B: So so many things happening. And you go into Decentraland you can get these proof of attendance protocol tokens that you were there for the super air launch event. And with that token, it's kind of like a badge that you get for going to a real event, in this case a digital event. Tickets. So if you buy tickets again in Decentraland, you can have something like a door that only opens if you have this NFT in your wallet. I think we're ending it going to the end of here. So we got people selling audio tapes.
00:32:37.142 - 00:33:30.374, Speaker B: Audio industry is massive. This is really just being played with at the moment. We have more wearables names, and I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with the whale project. So whale Shark, one of the biggest investors, has like a million dollars worth of nfts, probably a couple of million dollars worth of nfts locked in a vault, technically his wallet, and he's released a token called whale that represents the assets in that vault. So that's happening, and I'm pretty confident there's so many more use cases, but this is really, in my opinion, just 1% of what we're going to see nfts. No one really knows what's going on in nfts, apart from those that have been involved in the last two, three years. Once the broader community comes on and the space starts to get accelerated with funding and the minds that's necessary to take this further, I have no doubt this is going to blow up to something beyond what we can imagine.
00:33:30.374 - 00:33:38.510, Speaker B: So I'm pretty bullish on nfts. I'm pretty into it, very immersed, and yeah, that's about it from me, guys. Back to you, Jamie.
00:33:39.890 - 00:34:32.814, Speaker A: Yes, that's fascinating. And I think almost limitless in possibility. So you did a great job to kind of summarize a lot of that. And ultimately you can tell it's because you are native to this world, if you want to call it the metaverse, or wherever, where these kind of nfts are being really brought to life. And I think one of the things that's really interesting about nfts is probably for the first time, for the large majority of people, they are use cases that most people can get their head around. They're fairly familiar concepts, and I'm really excited about the potential of nfts to really be this gateway for mass adoption of crypto without people necessarily having to understand what they're doing. I think what's also interesting is everybody that's kind of already in the space to various degrees have found different ways into it.
00:34:32.814 - 00:35:06.540, Speaker A: So as you said, you come through from the virtual world perspective and kind of virtual real estate. I speak to other people who have come in it purely from the kind of digital art perspective. But you've been in this space for quite a while now. I guess the benefit of you having come through that, the virtual worlds angle, is that really, or increasingly these are the environments where a lot of this is brought together, a lot of the functionalities of NFTs are being brought to life. How have you seen the community evolve over the time that you've been in this space?
00:35:09.870 - 00:35:43.394, Speaker B: It's funny. Just before I jump to that question, Jamie, I'll just quickly on your point of multiple communities coming into this ferocious. One of the artists, that mainstream artist and kind of didn't really know what cryptocurrencies were, but there was a piece that sold for like $600 and there was a video made about her being very excited about it. And now there's more drops coming. And if you can see, I'm not going to pull out the video, actually, there's too much lag. But the recent.
00:35:43.442 - 00:35:45.640, Speaker A: This was the one that pump invested in, right?
00:35:46.490 - 00:36:15.534, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the artist that pump invested in. The recent piece that was dropped with literally like less than 24 hours ago. You can see there was a bidding war and currently it's sitting at ten Ethereum. And the exciting thing is that the amount of Twitter followers that are here, connected to that account are all just artists. They're all just 17 year old artists, 20 year old artists, and they're all getting excited and trying to jump onto super air and tokenize their work and sell their digital pieces, and people are buying those pieces. So completely mainstream. Completely.
00:36:15.534 - 00:36:24.626, Speaker B: No idea what cryptocurrencies are, just want to use Ethereum for its technology. So, again, on your point on being that gateway, just to build on that.
00:36:24.648 - 00:37:19.330, Speaker A: Point, actually, because I think that's a really interesting thing, the idea that currently, if we could call it web three, which everything like crypto and NFT sits in, it's really a distinct, separate community and it's very kind of introverted. Right. And it has all of these debates of things that are only really relevant and important to us. And on the whole, it's failed to capture the attention of the wider population. But the interesting thing here is, because a lot of these nfts that you're highlighting, such as digital art, because they have visual appeal, they're very viral in nature as assets. They're kind of crossing over into environments like Instagram, of course, Twitter, I'm sure TikTok eventually, is probably already happening, right? And so this is where there's a whole generation of people that are going to be introduced to crypto as a consequence of the visual appeal of nfts.
00:37:20.230 - 00:37:52.746, Speaker B: Totally agree. I totally agree. The reason why I invest in nfts is because I know they've got that viral appeal. I mean, you can only be so sexy on social media when you're saying, oh, so and so has a partnership with this company, right. It's only got like a pump appeal to it. But when you're showing art and virtual land and games, and that's the crypto or the technology is blockchain, you can visually see that that's the sort of stuff that goes viral on social media. So my investment thesis is getting onto things that both have a viral aspect to it and longevity just because of the trend of the industry.
00:37:52.746 - 00:37:58.130, Speaker B: So when I combine those two, that was the reason why I'm big on Decentraland and now art, et cetera.
00:37:58.870 - 00:38:50.930, Speaker A: Yeah. So to kind of circle back to your journey and how the communities evolved a year ago, what's the difference between the community that were interested in this stuff a year ago and now? Because certainly, as I said to you, I think at the beginning, before we came on air, I've been in crypto for several years. Of course, I was aware of nfts. I only personally kind of got back into it to have a look at what was going on a couple of months ago. And I was, like, blown away by how rich the community was, the kind of range of applications, of course, which you've illustrated. But it also just seemed like a part of the community that I was not connected to. And I had to follow hundreds of new people on crypto Twitter just to kind of be connected to this universe.
00:38:51.830 - 00:39:42.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to pull you back from the history of what happened. So obviously, cryptokitties came out and suddenly small amount of people jumped in and understood what that was, threw money at it. And there was that 2017 bull phase, late 2017, early 2018, where people were kind of coming off the bull market and trying to find assets to put their money in. And nfTs, for a small amount of people, they found nfts to do that, a way to diversify their assets. And what happened was, I guess cryptocurrencies continued their downtrend and a lot of people left the space, sold their nfts, and the community ended up being the handful of people that had this belief within themselves that these projects are going to blow up, that there is going to be a demand for nfts. They had this belief, and for, like, in 2018 and 2019, especially 2019, it was a pretty dull period because bitcoin was kind of going down.
00:39:42.834 - 00:40:20.874, Speaker B: I think it reached like $3,000. There wasn't much momentum. A lot of projects that were trying to find funding weren't being funded much went out of funding, actually, because it's been like two years since they were coming off the hype of things and just not being able to be funded throughout that one or two year development journey. So the community became quite small, but they continued to develop. So projects like the art market super matured, projects like Decentraland Matured, crypto, voxels matured, and Axie Infinity had an alpha game. So all of these projects for one or two years had their heads down building. The ones that were well funded, came out with a good product, and the community there were all quite excited.
00:40:20.874 - 00:41:03.830, Speaker B: They were gobling up pieces and nfts and assets that they think were going to do big, going to do good. But I think what happened, and we can see this with DFI, is one of the biggest problems we had with the NFT space previously, was that to engage with the web three on these projects, you had to have metamask. And a lot of people don't really know how to use metamask. They keep their money in exchanges. But what happened with DFI is people got introduced with owning your own tokens, engaging with uniswap, et cetera. And you can see since April, it's gone quite exponential, having like $10 billion almost being locked within d five protocols. Basically thousands, tens of thousands of people understanding how to use metamask.
00:41:03.830 - 00:42:05.946, Speaker B: So suddenly there's all these people that are potential onboarding, very easy to onboard, and with a project like the meme token, the meme project, and suddenly with the NFT awareness, they get it. They understand what token ownership is like now, and ownership of that with the metamask and engaging with websites that enable web three now initially just being d five protocols, but now being different projects like Decentraland and Axio Infinity, blah blah blah. And I think just the intersection between d five blowing up and nfts maturing to an extent to there's something to do there beyond just waiting for a product to release. That's what's created this next buzz. So suddenly we've seen so many people interested, and not just interested, but engaging, jumping in decentralized, jumping in axio infinity, playing the game, investing, being like, wait a second, there's a product here, not just a plan to collaborate and release a product one year down the line. So that's how the community has matured. For between 2018 2019, most were kind of just jumping between presales holding onto their asset portfolio.
00:42:05.946 - 00:42:24.920, Speaker B: Nfts are traditionally a lot more illiquid than cryptocurrencies, just because there's no real base value, and if the volume dries up, it's very difficult to sell your tokens. So, yeah, I think that's how it's all kind of come together and now it's all just reaching this boiling point where everything's ready to go.
00:42:25.610 - 00:43:22.102, Speaker A: Yeah, and I definitely want to jump into, because you can look at the NFT space in a number of different ways. As you say, you can look at it as a tool. And with this increasing level of programmability and functionality, you highlighted this idea about making these kind of living artworks that can take data feeds from oracles and adapt. You can look at it as an asset, just a purely speculative asset. And as you mentioned, the fact that these are inherently illiquid markets because they're non fungible people like Whale, who actually had on the founders of web three podcast, I think we released it just yesterday, has effectively collateralized his own token whale. Whale token. And the way that he thinks about it is it kind of has greater levels of stability because it's linked to something of value, but it also has the ability to appreciate.
00:43:22.102 - 00:44:03.398, Speaker A: And so as an asset that sits outside of the incredibly volatile world of tokens associated to protocols or whatever, it seems like an interesting hedge. I think watching the flows between nfts and then the wider cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, is going to be interesting. But then, as you also say, there's the community component. It's not really one community, it's lots of, I perceive it currently separate communities. The art community is separate to, the gaming community is separate to people perhaps looking at wearables and fashion. There's so many different angles to kind of unravel. It's all very fast moving.
00:44:03.398 - 00:44:33.630, Speaker A: But one of the things I wanted to ask you was, are we starting to see the same old debates around CFI and Defi emerge in these NFT marketplaces? So marketplaces that are perhaps more centralized versus those that decentralized, so those that have a fiat on and off ramp, like Nifty Gateway versus, say, superair, where as far as I'm aware, you can only purchase through metamask.
00:44:34.050 - 00:45:07.258, Speaker B: Yeah, nifty Gateway does have a fiat on ramp, but they're not really centralized. I think that's just a feature. They have to get people to pay with the credit card if they want to, but you can take your NFT and sell it on OpenSea. So a lot of these projects have nfts that you can just pull out of the platform you purchase it on and sell it on another platform. I haven't seen much of CFI versus DeFi in the NFT space. None of them really have an NFT that's native to their project. That's only tradable within their platform.
00:45:07.258 - 00:45:44.214, Speaker B: A lot of them actually monetize by getting trading fees between the platforms. So they charge like 2.5% of the trade volume of the nfTs. But I think it's a very dangerous model because of the decentralized aspect of this. Anyone that comes up with a great marketplace like rarible, suddenly people just flock there and list and sell their nfts there. So I haven't really seen much of an issue with CFI. I know Defi's had like binance are trying to jump on it, list them, and have some sort of a CDFI component or something, but I haven't seen that sort of a fight or struggle in the NFT space.
00:45:44.214 - 00:46:30.950, Speaker B: I think everyone in the NFT space value interoperability, because the whole concept of owning that token is more about using it in multiple places. So if you own a ticket that you bought from Opensea, you want to go use it in another project like Decentraland. So key to having that NFT is continuing to develop utility, which isn't much with fungible token. It's more about finding places where you can spend that token in most cases, but with nfTs, it's more about like, all right, well, you bought this ticket a year ago for our event. Well, this event, you're going to get a special prize, airdrop to your, you can use it in our event that we're hosting in Decentraland or crypto voxels, et cetera. So I've seen more of an interoperability so far. I've seen more of an interoperability mindset.
00:46:30.950 - 00:46:31.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:31.932 - 00:47:38.842, Speaker A: I mean, it's interesting if you think of these mean, that sounds like, hence this concept that a lot of people are saying NFTs are part of Defi. They're like a subset of Defi in many ways. And certainly that characteristic of the ability for assets to freely flow across these different platforms is interesting. And one of the things that I've been thinking through is could you consider an NFT marketplace as an equivalent to binance, both in terms of its investment potential, being able to invest in something like that, where binance has BNB, or is it something different? Because it certainly feels to me that marketplaces are functioning in a similar way to, say, a binance to bring in retail users, retail investors effectively and actually have greater potential than a binance because of the fact that these assets are much more understandable. Is that something that forms in your.
00:47:38.896 - 00:48:30.838, Speaker B: Thesis as well to somewhat are. I think they're going to be bigger than anything we've seen before just because of how big each industry they can appeal to. But you have the problem of illiquidity, and when you have a problem of illiquidity, then you have a secondary market that doesn't move as easily as the primary market, or just doesn't move as much as I guess tokens would or stock would as on exchanges. Right. I have thought about what a project like binance would do with the NFT space. How would they capitalize off the trading fees or the trading volume that happens in these markets? And it's hard to actually do it because what do you do? You have an order book with people selling multiple pieces. Each asset is unique, so it's not like you have multiple orders that are all similar in the nature of what they're selling.
00:48:30.838 - 00:49:00.690, Speaker B: So you can easily buy and sell them whichever one you want. But each asset is unique. So if you want a land that's connected, that has coordinate 43, 64 in Decentraland, well, you got to jump in that land and see what's built around you. You got to see what people have previously built. Does it come with something in it? Is it near a district? So there's so much investigation. And when you buy an axio infinity, you want to know what parts does it have? What's the mint number, who owned it previously? There's just so much to it. So it's very difficult.
00:49:00.690 - 00:49:47.902, Speaker B: And I think even binance are kind of struggling with how, and how do we capitalize on this kind of a thing. I know projects like Decentraland, engine wax, they all have a token that represents their project. Decentraland have a governance token called mana, which they use to buy and sell land, buy and sell items. You can stake it, you can govern with it, et cetera. So for a long time, they were like one of the very few projects that represented the NFT project with ERC 20. What I'm seeing now is that especially with what wearable did with just airdropped everyone these tokens, and everyone went nuts and just started using know mana, obviously doing well. Sandbox also just released their sand token.
00:49:47.902 - 00:50:07.370, Speaker B: So people are realizing, especially in the NFT space, that, wait a second, maybe because. Maybe why things didn't move as much, or maybe why we struggle with funding is because we didn't speak the language of the broader crypto community. And so we're seeing a lot of people release some sort of an ERC 20 equivalent. Even axe came out saying they may release some sort of a governance representative token.
00:50:08.670 - 00:51:15.230, Speaker A: I think it's interesting for people to also understand, as you say, it's like a very high engagement asset. You're going to better understand it. You're going to value it more greatly if it's relevant to the context in which you're kind of navigating the metaverse, which again, is different to perhaps low engagement assets in a fungible sense. I think one of the other interesting things would be good to understand is so we've already said the kind of subsets of communities around NFTs. So I know that there are some kind of generalized NFT platforms, and then increasingly there are specialized ones. And we had John Crane on the podcast recently of superair, and he described superair as a social network around digital art rather than an NFT, like a general NFT community. So given there's this kind of high liquidity, as you say, it is the moat, effectively the community, and therefore the natural consequences, you're going to move away from generalizable NFT platforms to more specialist platforms and communities.
00:51:15.230 - 00:51:48.650, Speaker A: And as you say, with things like Rari. So some of these platforms releasing, I don't know if Rari has any governance abilities, but I know other platforms are looking at this ability to rights to effectively curate and participate in the decisions of the network. So is that how these platforms are going to lock people in? On the one hand it's building niches, niche communities, and on the other hand, it's kind of increasingly devolving governance and what have you through tokens, their own tokens.
00:51:49.310 - 00:52:20.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what's going to happen is you're going to find projects and I think communities are going to be key to this community and people that you've worked with, and you believe in your friends, where they lie, where they hang out. That's probably going to be the key to where you spend your time. Right? So rarible has just did something amazing. They just airdropped everyone in the NFT community, free money. Basically, everyone woke up to like a their account. So suddenly people are all very rarible or rari loving. Like they talk about it on Twitter.
00:52:20.674 - 00:52:36.860, Speaker B: They're always buying art. They support artists with rarible. People have moved their art from launching on other places to the rarible marketplace because there is no application process. You just basically rip something off Google if you want to, and they have an issue with that.
00:52:37.630 - 00:53:26.054, Speaker A: There's a whole trash meme wasn't there speaking to the artists involved. There's a whole meme around trash art, which evolved into trash pill art. It's a fascinating little meme where somebody effectively just took a bit of art off. Google ran it through a very simple program and tried to then sell it on superair, and they removed that piece of art and the artist. But then it spurred this whole debate around what is art? And I actually heard the artist involved. I've forgotten his name now, which is a real shame. I was talking to him last night, but he was saying that he felt that this kind of elitism towards NFT art was the same way people looked at punk, three chord punk, punk rock, just because it was using very simple tools.
00:53:26.054 - 00:53:35.354, Speaker A: The output was very simple art. Did that make it any less art? So this idea of censorship is interesting in a platform context as well.
00:53:35.472 - 00:54:02.662, Speaker B: It is extremely. And that's why rarible has kind of found its own, I guess, niche. That was the basis of it, where people just wanted to make. A lot of people wanted to make trash art and they just took someone's picture and made fun of it, or took someone's art and did their own little spin off of it, and something like superair would look at that and be like, no, that's not allowed. You're using someone else's art. But art is whatever people want it to be. Like, what is art? At the end of the day, it could even be a red square.
00:54:02.662 - 00:54:39.594, Speaker B: It could be something ripped off the Internet and squiggled on. It is whatever people express it to be. So it is an interesting thing because rareable is on completely one side and super rare is completely on the other, and finding a balance between the two. Some people don't like their art being stolen and drawed on and sold again. So that happened on super rare, and super rare had to do something about it because it affected the collectors and the artists of those pieces. So there's so much happening and the evolution and seeing the direction of this and who capitalizes on it. Wearable just did really well because they just opened the doors for everyone to get involved.
00:54:39.594 - 00:54:49.494, Speaker B: And it went from, like, this place that no one really used to, this place that pretty much everyone uses now because it's just so open. But again, there's issues involved. Yeah.
00:54:49.532 - 00:56:00.250, Speaker A: And I've heard whenever I've spoken to people in the space, whether that's from whaleshark through to, you know, they generally speak very positively about the space. But, for example, the reason why shark is anonymous or pseudo anonymous is because of toxicity in the said. You know, crypto art is even more crazy than just generic, normal crypto Twitter, which feels almost impossible to believe. But there you go. I could talk about this for hours, really. There's so much to explore that the kind of final thing I want to talk about is the loyalty component, because an increasing part of my thesis within NFTs is looking at how the role NFTs can play in encouraging behaviors such as loyalty, not just in the context of a digital art platform, but in DeFi generally. So obviously, the best example of this so far, at least, that I'm aware of, was Ave Gotche, which is effectively an NFT game built on top of Ave, which is a deFi protocol.
00:56:00.250 - 00:56:06.750, Speaker A: Could you talk us through that and how you see nfts in the context of loyalty?
00:56:07.970 - 00:57:41.126, Speaker B: Avogatchi I've looked at it very briefly, but I believe how it works is as you have your money staked in the Avagatchi protocol, with the yield or the benefits or the fees share or whatever reward you get in terms of the fungible aspect of things, you also get an NFT that evolves in time, like the features that it has, it evolves the more interest you earn. And that NFT, I guess, becomes more and more stronger, or more and more developed and established, grows bigger and better. And I guess because it's another token that can be sold, right? It's another universe they can explore suddenly, if they have this whole virtual world where you can go walk around with your tamagotchi equivalent and feed it and kind of gamify this defi space more than just parking your money somewhere, then there's this whole reward thing that you're part of this whole game just because you're doing this activity that builds value to the platform. So the rewards part of it, like you mentioned, is extremely interesting. It isn't very mature. Don't buy meme the meme project, what you are about to release even just rewards in general. Even with Defi, it's quite new, right? It has existed for a while, but only in the last three to four months are people realizing that, wait a second, why am I parking my money in binance when I can park it in uniswap and get a decent amount of income and it works out for everyone involved, so it's definitely something being explored.
00:57:41.126 - 00:58:55.970, Speaker B: I know there was a proposal in Decentraland where instead of burning the fees, which is what they do traditionally, they burn the fees 2.5% of all land sale volume. So if it sells a million mana worth of land, I think it's like 25,000 mana gets burnt, effectively, slowly, slowly increasing the value of mana in terms of fiat because it reduces the supply. But there was a proposal where instead of burning the fees, why don't we distribute the fees to people that stake their land or hold a bag of mana, or stake their mana or provide some sort of value to the ecosystem? Maybe they build stuff on their land and have more traffic to the land. So distributing the fees, which comes on on a daily basis to these people, suddenly there's value in holding the land, suddenly there's value in holding that manor. Maybe there's this incentivizing people with the fees that the project earns to the people and everyone collectively, especially the project benefits from their token going up, which is what happened with meme and which is what happened with Wi Fi and all these other projects where everyone kind of benefits or the core founders benefit from the token going up and there's ways to incentivize everyone in doing so. So I think the future of incentivizing and rewarding is huge.
00:58:55.970 - 00:59:43.074, Speaker B: I know game credits are also doing something extremely interesting. They were a project that were dormant for a while, but they were recently reacquired by a pretty capable team. I know them quite well because they work with me in Decentraland, but they're going to gamify the game token in the sense that you can stake your game token towards different influencers or different gamers, even different teams that play esports and different things, and you're going to get NFTs as rewards for that. And you can claim that in the rewards portal. So they were going to do something similar to what the meme project does, but instead of cards, they were going to give different rewards as nfTs. This has been in the plan for the last six months to a year. I've been talking to them quite regularly, so there is projects that are moving in that direction and I think we'll see a lot more of it.
00:59:43.272 - 00:59:59.560, Speaker A: Matty, look, thanks so much for coming on. Really fascinating stuff. I'm sure the community have really benefited from hearing you. They can follow you directly at DCL, blogger on Twitter, similar channel on YouTube. Thanks so much for coming on.
01:00:00.090 - 01:00:07.818, Speaker B: My pleasure. I'm so happy to be here and let people know what I've been kind of obsessed with for the last two years and happy to do it any other day.
01:00:07.984 - 01:00:59.290, Speaker A: Great, thanks so much, Matty. So before we go, just quickly to explain what we're up to in the NFT space at Outlive ventures. So we're now actively recruiting for our next winter cohort for base camp, which is our dedicated web three accelerator. It's a five month program, three month intense program, with another two months after that for things like token launches, token launch support nfts are going to be a fundamental part of that. We already have several very exciting NFT projects in previous cohorts that are now going to be coming online. We've actually just developed, about to launch today our new thesis, DFI 2.0, a subset of which is DFI plus nfts.
01:00:59.290 - 01:01:48.250, Speaker A: A big part of that is what I was alluding to around loyalty. I really believe that if you look at the innovations that have been happening in DFI, such as yield and governance and governance tokens are great to acquire users, but it creates very promiscuous behavior. If you add nfts from a loyalty perspective, that closes the loop and you can start to get some very intense communities and presumably associated token value that comes off. I'm actually going to be soft launching that thesis on a panel later today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time at the open world Summit, on a panel with Roham of Dapple Labs and Sergey of Chainlink. So please do make sure you join us for that. I hope you've enjoyed the format.
01:01:48.250 - 01:02:07.840, Speaker A: It's the first time I've tried this with regards to speaking to analysts. If you've got any feedback, do let us know. I don't believe we were able to actually get this one to be a live stream, so this is going to be a live recording that goes out immediately afterwards, but hopefully next time it will be live. So thanks for joining and do make sure you dial in later.
