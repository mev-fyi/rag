00:00:09.880 - 00:00:16.713, Speaker A: When we started outlier in 2014, it was a very different time from today, surely in the Web3 arena.
00:00:16.809 - 00:00:22.537, Speaker B: Jamie Burke Jamie Burke CEO CEO and founder Outlier Outlier Outlier Ventures We've been.
00:00:22.561 - 00:00:24.273, Speaker C: Around for about a decade now.
00:00:24.369 - 00:00:49.421, Speaker D: Outlier started out as an incubator of projects that we incubated and founded in house. When I came to Outlier Ventures, it was a two people company. There were Jamie and there were Aaron. And Jamie said, let's get together, let's meet up and I'll tell you about this business that I'm building. I have this vision of this huge portfolio and it's going to be really big and you know, it's called Outlier Ventures. We should discuss.
00:00:49.533 - 00:00:57.959, Speaker A: Around 2017, the portfolio grew to about 16 teams. We worked with the likes of Fetch, Iota and sovereignty.
00:00:58.037 - 00:01:13.395, Speaker D: In 2019, we turned to the already proven business model of an accelerator. And then over those years we were able to work with 77 teams, which is a multiple of the teams we had previously collected in over the same number of years.
00:01:13.475 - 00:01:28.381, Speaker A: In 2021, we expanded that even more by starting to run cohorts in parallel. So not just one cohort at a time, but maybe two or three cohorts of 6, 7, 8 startups in every quarter, which brought us to over 200 teams.
00:01:28.463 - 00:01:47.743, Speaker D: That made us during 2022 and 23 the leading global accelerator for Web3 projects, but also the most active overall investor by number of deals in the web3 space. And with those functions, we managed then to scale the business to now a portfolio of more than 300 projects.
00:01:47.799 - 00:01:53.975, Speaker E: One of the great things about Outlaw that's been fairly consistent throughout the years is that we have had a great network.
00:01:54.055 - 00:02:05.367, Speaker C: We do pride ourselves on providing the best support to founders and that's why it's so important that we hire the best people for the job and look not just at what the industry looks like today, but also how it will look tomorrow.
00:02:05.431 - 00:02:19.205, Speaker E: This has been such a foundational 10 years for the whole industry and I think in 10 years time, who knows where we're going to be. But I think if we sort of maintain our long term vision and sort of be pragmatic about how we deliver that vision, I think we're going to be in a great position.
00:02:19.335 - 00:02:19.505, Speaker F: It.
