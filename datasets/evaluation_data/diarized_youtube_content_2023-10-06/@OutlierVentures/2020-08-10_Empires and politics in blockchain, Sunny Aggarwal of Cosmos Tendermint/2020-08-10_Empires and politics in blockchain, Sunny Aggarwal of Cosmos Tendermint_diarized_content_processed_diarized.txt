00:00:09.450 - 00:00:36.680, Speaker A: Welcome to the founders of web3 series by Outlive Ventures and me, your host, Jamie Burke. Together, we're going to meet the entrepreneurs, their backers, and the leading policymakers that are shaping Web three. Together, we're going to try to define what is Web three, explore its nuances, and understand the mission and purpose that drive its founders. If you enjoy what you hear, please do subscribe, rate, and share your feedback to help us reach as many people as possible with the important mission that is Web three.
00:00:45.150 - 00:00:58.894, Speaker B: I'm really happy to welcome Sonny Ugawal, lead researcher at Tendermint, or was the lead researcher at Tendermint, contributor to Cosmos Cosmos Hub and now founder of Seeker. Welcome to the show.
00:00:59.092 - 00:01:00.974, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me on.
00:01:01.172 - 00:01:38.970, Speaker B: So, to give some context, the Cosmos Network is a decentralized network of independent, scalable and interoperable blockchains. The Cosmos network is also built around Tendermint core, which is the kind of linkage to tendermint, the company. And effectively that is a solution that packages the networking consensus layers of a blockchain. You've then got Tendermint Inc. Which is the software development company, which is your previous employer, and that is contracted by the Interchain foundation to develop the Cosmos network, in particular, the Cosmos software development kit, SDK. Did I get that right as a summary?
00:01:39.550 - 00:01:50.734, Speaker C: Yeah. So many names, and some of them tend to be reused in some, you know, Tenderman is this consensus protocol, but it's also the software, and it's a so. But, yeah, you nailed it right on the head.
00:01:50.852 - 00:02:10.662, Speaker B: All right, great. Now, obviously, we'll kind of go into a little bit about how all of these various organizations comprise the ecosystem and how they're evolving a little bit later. But you're also a co host of Epicenter. So I'm a little bit nervous, to be honest with you. You're kind of a pro. I'm just starting out at this, so maybe you can help me along.
00:02:10.796 - 00:02:14.822, Speaker C: I listened to a couple of your episodes already, and they're just great. All right. Okay.
00:02:14.876 - 00:03:08.002, Speaker B: Thank you. I appreciate that. You kind of got to say that, right? So the reasons why I want you on the show, a number of, you know, you're not technically a founder at Tendermint or Cosmos Cosmos Network. That was obviously Jay and Ethan, but you were one of the kind of first hires, almost the kind of initial core team, and you've been heavily involved in most of the network's developments. And I think if you look at Cosmos as representative of the wider blockchain movement and how these protocols have formed and then evolve or devolve to the community. I think that is a really interesting perspective that from a founder's perspective, it hasn't really been that well covered. And I guess in many ways, you are the community guy, right? You're at the core of the community and provide that kind of interface.
00:03:08.002 - 00:03:54.790, Speaker B: And I also think when I kind of listen to your stuff, whether it's panels that you've done or the podcast, you're very good at simplifying complexities and helping people understand blockchains through useful, sometimes kind of historical analogies. So I'm sure we're going to get a few of those really great sound bites throughout the podcast. You've also run a number of initiatives, both at consensus for Ethereum and then Berkeley, about onboarding developers. And again, I think that's a really big theme for where we are as an industry right now. So I really want to pick your brains about how we onboard the 99% of developers into blockchain. So if I kind of just quickly try to summarize your background. You did an undergraduate in electrical engineering computer science at Berkeley 2015.
00:03:54.790 - 00:05:15.962, Speaker B: As I said, you spent some time at consensus as an Ethereum developer intern 2017, and you helped kind of train enrollees of the consensus academy, and you did a number of fixes around ontology. You then were a course design and lecturer back at Berkeley, or I guess that was kind of during that same period where you co designed and taught the cryptocurrency cacao to over 200 students now I think since fall 2016, and did a number of other things there. And then, of course, you've kind of contributed a lot by way of blockchain at Berkeley and the circulation of various white papers and helping students develop proof of concept so very hands on, right at the edge of onboarding people into this new space, some of which maybe are new to development more generally. You then joined tenement in June 2017 as a research scientist, and you worked on everything from crypto economics through to the technicalities, fault tolerance, system design and the Cosmos SDK. And I believe we try to keep these podcasts quite timeless. But you have left literally yesterday or last week, Tendermint, and have got on to film seeker, which is a blockchain infrastructure company. I think it does a number of things, but in particular for Cosmos Hub, your top five validator.
00:05:15.962 - 00:05:25.246, Speaker B: So again, I think that's a really representative, this evolution of how teams kind of work together and then start to spin out. Did I miss anything in that? I tried to keep it as tight.
00:05:25.278 - 00:06:07.074, Speaker C: As possible yeah, no, that was really great. I was an intern at consensus, so I was there only for, know, two or three months, and I kind of dropped off halfway through my internship just because while I was at consensus back then, they were really much more focused on application layer stuff, and I just really wanted to learn do more protocol layer stuff. But while I was at consensus, I just got super into proof of stake. And so I just kind of slacked off on my job at consensus, but instead spent the entire time reading every proof of stake white paper I could find. And that's sort of how I found out about tendermint. I'm like, oh, I want to go work on this. This sounds really cool.
00:06:07.074 - 00:06:22.360, Speaker C: So I was doing my internship at consensus after my sophomore year, and then I dropped out of my internship at consensus, start working on tendermint, and then come September, I was just so into it that I dropped out of Berkeley as well to keep working on.
00:06:22.890 - 00:06:36.940, Speaker B: Right. So, okay, so that's is, I guess, was that driven by an urgency in you that you kind of felt that you couldn't waste more time, if that's the right word, in kind of going through academia, you just wanted to get straight into the space?
00:06:37.390 - 00:07:02.706, Speaker C: Yeah, basically. I mean, I tried to do both. And then literally the day before classes, the syllabus for one of my courses came out. I don't know if you know Nicholas Weaver. He's like a professor at Berkeley who. Yeah, he has some weird hot takes on crypto. But for his course, the syllabus came out and one of the midterms conflicted with Devcon three, I think it was at the time.
00:07:02.706 - 00:07:22.826, Speaker C: And I wrote an email to him being like, hey, I'm giving a talk here at Devcon. Can I move this midterm around? And I don't know if it was because it was a crypto event or not, but he's like, no. And I'm like, fine, I'm just going to drop your course. And then I'm like, wait a second. This is going to keep happening. Let me just drop all my courses. Let me just focus what I'm doing.
00:07:23.008 - 00:07:33.082, Speaker B: But then you went back to Berkeley, right. And kind of helped them develop their course around blockchain. So what was it that you kind of took you back there? Why did you think that was an important thing to do? Yeah.
00:07:33.136 - 00:08:06.614, Speaker C: So I was one of the co founders of this organization called Blockchain at Berkeley, and I did that while I was still a student there. So what Berkeley does is they have this really cool program where anyone can sort of teach. Any students can teach a class. You just have to go find a faculty member to sponsor back your class. But you're teaching four credit classes. Me and two friends. So Max Fang and Philip Hayes, we sort of went to Don Song, who, she runs the Oasis protocol now, and we asked her to back this.
00:08:06.614 - 00:08:20.634, Speaker C: And we started this class at Berkeley just to teach people about bitcoin and to be quite honest, mostly to teach ourselves about bitcoin. Because for me, the way I learn is by teaching. Because if you got a lecture on something next week, you better learn it this week.
00:08:20.832 - 00:08:24.954, Speaker B: That's why I do the podcast, by the way. It forces me to learn the discipline.
00:08:25.002 - 00:09:04.630, Speaker C: Yeah, same here. Epicenter. It's like once a week, got to learn something new, and it's like, just across the space, not just, like, so pigeonholed on one field or one topic. Yeah. So we started that course, and a lot of people took it, really liked it, and we're like, hey, let's do something bigger with this, instead of just having people take this course and then go on and go take the next AI or machine learning course next, let's see how we can retain these people. And so we created this organization called Blockchain at Berkeley, where we started to do a couple of things. One, the organization kind of took over that course, and then we had the education department, and then we had R D and consulting.
00:09:04.630 - 00:09:31.602, Speaker C: A lot of college students are really trying to build up their resumes. We're like, hey, at that time. But this is like peak 2016, 2017, all these companies were out there wanting to get their hands on blockchain. And so we're like, well, we know a thing or two. How can we help them? And so we started that helping, and that organization grew pretty big. And then even after I dropped out, I still continue to live in the city of Berkeley. Like I said, I dropped out the day before classes started.
00:09:31.602 - 00:09:47.670, Speaker C: So I already was living in my frat house and stuff at the time. So I continued doing that, and I was still really involved with blockchain up Berkeley, even up till today. I still help out with mentoring and stuff for any students who are interested in talking about stuff.
00:09:47.820 - 00:10:27.650, Speaker B: Very cool. And so it's an interesting topic in terms of how do you win Mindshare? So, obviously, without all the price action that was happening in 2017, maybe that won't happen again. Maybe with everything that's going on in TikTok right now, there's going to be a whole new wave. But how do you win Mindshare? Because obviously, you got a lot of very bright, technical people. They could be applying that to any number of different domains, I guess, whether it's quantum, whether it's machine learning. How do you win Mindshare? What is it that seems to cut through with developers that are looking for where to kind of develop their career and apply their brains?
00:10:28.070 - 00:11:09.458, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely a hard challenge, especially at such a large school at Berkeley, where there's so many things people could be doing to be know the price action definitely brought a lot of people along back in those days. Another thing that I think was kind of really important at Berkeley, where this student organization at Berkeley was probably like one of the came up much earlier. It actually started back in 2014. And I think maybe Berkeley and MIT are sort of the only two that were doing sort of crypto stuff this early on. MIT, I feel, was doing it a lot, like they were really into the technology side. But I think what's interesting about Berkeley is Berkeley. As you might know, it's a very political school.
00:11:09.458 - 00:11:59.202, Speaker C: Right. The students at Berkeley tend to have a lot of political ideology and stuff that they're really passionate about. And so that was actually, I think a lot of the early members of blockchain Berkeley were actually driven more so by that side of things. And if you remember back in 2016, along with the US presidential election, there was a lot of political stuff actually happening on the Berkeley campus at the time, especially with regards to things like free speech and stuff like that. And so I think that just sort of definitely helped instigate that. And so we kind of really did try to focus on that early on. And then when we wanted to expand beyond that, then we started kind of figuring out what are students looking to do, where a lot of students were looking for the opportunity to do sort of consulting style work.
00:11:59.202 - 00:12:22.380, Speaker C: And so we were able to build out something where they can do consulting but still learn about a new technology at the same time, where it was like, there's other consulting clubs on campus where they would go do web design for these companies, and we're like, well, you could do that or you could get some consulting work under your belt, but also be learning something much cooler alongside that.
00:12:23.070 - 00:12:44.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because again, that kind of political origin, or perhaps the hook is the political possibilities or looking at blockchains as political systems. And again, I know you've used a lot of analogies where you say, compare Ethereum to an empire and what you're doing with cosmos. Actually, I forget the direct comparison.
00:12:44.170 - 00:12:46.338, Speaker C: I call it the world of nation states.
00:12:46.504 - 00:13:22.320, Speaker B: Yes. There you go. That's it. I know you've talked about things like shared security in the context of being like NATO. So from your perspective, the thing that kind of motivates you, is it in that context, if you look at the mission of, say, interchange, I mean, just quoted it, it says, we believe that open source, cryptographic, consensus driven economic networks hold the key to an antifragile global economic system and equal opportunity for all. I'm sure that's not necessarily exactly representative of your perspective, but can you work in blockchain and not have a political ideology? Can you look at it purely as a technology? Is that possible?
00:13:24.770 - 00:14:00.570, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. I actually am in the middle of. I just finished writing up a blog post, sort of, I'll publish it pretty soon. But I kind of talk about sort of the three or maybe four narratives of the blockchain space. The three main ones are what I would say sound money, web3, and open finance, or DFI. And then I think there might be a fourth one called open law, which is sort of still in its very infancy right now. And I think the sound money one might be the one where you have.
00:14:00.570 - 00:14:37.590, Speaker C: Maybe it's the most political of the all, but I think all of them do at least have some notion of decentralization. Web three is not necessarily about political decentralization, but it's about decentralizing the control of the large Internet giants, or DeFI is about decentralizing control of large financial institutions. So it's not necessarily always having to be decentralizing government, but there usually does have to be some form of decentralizing, some large, entrenched actor.
00:14:38.090 - 00:15:31.186, Speaker B: Yeah. Now, I mean, I guess one of the beauties of something like cosmos is that it does allow you to cater to a spectrum of sovereignties. So, on the one hand, I know you talk about there being zones more linked to this cypherpunk type mentality and others that could be specific for China and fully functional and integrated into what they're trying to do with the government backed currency. So compared to if it was one protocol with one set of belief systems, one set of governance, then I guess it gets a bit more binary to just kind of untangle the cosmos ecosystem a little bit more. So, as we mentioned, there's kind of all in bits, Inc. Which is effectively tendermint, Inc. You have Cosmos hub, you have tendermint core.
00:15:31.186 - 00:15:50.170, Speaker B: Could you just talk about the constituent parts, how they interact, and, I guess how they've evolved so kind of from the genesis to what they're becoming now. And of course, in that context, in general terms, the role of a founder that creates that and how things might devolve outwards.
00:15:50.670 - 00:16:23.686, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. By the way, just to the point you mentioned earlier. Yeah, I guess I never thought of it in that term. But I think one interesting way to think of Cosmos is it's trying to decentralize Ethereum. Ethereum is a larger entrenched actor, which is maybe know it's been a good actor up until now, but you don't want the entire blockchain ecosystem to be reliant on this one system, and you want to decentralize that as well and give smaller communities more power. Maybe we can come back to that.
00:16:23.708 - 00:16:23.846, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:23.868 - 00:17:26.694, Speaker C: Let me answer your question about the ecosystem itself. So it started back in 2014, where JQuan was interested in consensus protocols. And a lot of people were talking about proof of stake at the time, or not a lot of people, but a few people were. But most of them were kind of putting it, trying to adapt it to the Nakamoto consensus of bitcoin. What Jay's really big insight was, he went back and read all these old consensus protocols from the, realized that, hey, maybe there's a way we can actually use them today with proof of stake. So the problem is that these old consensus protocols were usually only meant to work in a permissioned setting. But what he realized is you can combine the proof of stake system with these old BFT consensus protocols in order to create a permissionless BFT protocol rather than a Nakamoto consensus protocol.
00:17:26.694 - 00:18:21.610, Speaker C: And so this insight turned out to be really valuable. And so the other thing, what was wrong with the old consensus protocols was that they were considered to be not very performant. You can maybe get like ten machines talking on a local network, and that's about it. But quite honestly, all of those reference implementations then were written by PhD students for their thesis in Python or something. So what Jay did was he worked with Ethan Buckman, who was. He was working at Monax at the time, or back then it was called Monax, now it's called Hyperledger Burrow. But they started basically collaborating to build a reference implementation in go using modern concurrency and generally just good engineering practices.
00:18:21.610 - 00:19:24.778, Speaker C: And it turns out they were able to build a consensus protocol consensus engine, tendermint core, which is the software that can scale to hundreds, to thousands of validators globally distributed, and we can actually get some real scale there. And so that's sort of how, when they decided to form this company called Tendermint and now that they had this consensus protocol, they have this hammer. Now they're in search of a nail. And they were trying to figure out, we have a consensus protocol, what can we use it for? And that's sort of when the cosmos vision sort of came about, sort of in late 2016 or so, where they kind of had this idea of what the cosmos vision is today, of many chains that are all able to talk to each other. And this BFT consensus protocol will be really useful because you have the fast finality. You have finality in one to 2 seconds. And Blockstream wrote their side chains protocol as well, back in similar time period.
00:19:24.778 - 00:19:58.282, Speaker C: I don't remember exactly when, maybe 2015 or so, but bitcoin blockheaders will take 60 minutes before you can consider them pseudo finalized. And this just doesn't work. And so they realize, hey, we can use this great finality engine we did to make this side chain vision. That sort of blockchain kind of really originated it, but we can actually make this a reality using this. And so that's sort of where the cosmos vision came about. And we realized to make that Cosmos vision come about, there were sort of three main tools that we needed. The first was tenement core, which we had already done.
00:19:58.282 - 00:21:05.074, Speaker C: Obviously, we've been developing it and making it way and way better over the years. But then the other two tools were the Cosmos SDK and IBC. So if we want a world where all these chains can sort of more and more chains are coming about and they're all talking to each other. Well, we need two things, which is, one, a toolkit to make it very easy for developers to build these new chains. And two is a protocol to allow all these chains to send tokens and data and contract calls amongst each other, a sort of TCP IP for blockchains, a standard protocol to allow any two chains to talk to each other. And so that's sort of what we've been working on since then, where we basically spent most of 2017 and 2018 building the Cosmos SDK and making this toolkit. And then we built our own chain called the Cosmos Hub, partially as a sort of dog fooding to like, while we're building the Cosmos SDK, we're building the Cosmos hub and making it better and better.
00:21:05.074 - 00:21:56.034, Speaker C: And then we spent basically most of 2019 and 2020 so far developing IBC. And hopefully that should be releasing pretty soon and hopefully on the scale of a few months. But that's sort of the roadmap where we are of one organization I forgot to mention was when they sort of did the Cosmos idea. They did a public fundraiser, or ICO, in order to raise funds for the atom token, which is a staking token for the Cosmos hub. And they created a new organization called the Interchain foundation, which is a swiss foundation. ICF is sort of technically, maybe you could call them the steward of the ecosystem. And then the ICF would contract tendermint to do a lot of the core development up until now.
00:21:56.034 - 00:22:03.650, Speaker C: So now ICF is sort of decentralizing a lot more of its core development to more teams than just tendermint.
00:22:03.990 - 00:22:22.630, Speaker B: Got you that kind of evolution now of is that being kind of run through grants programs, then, primarily. Right. So rather than it just being a contract with Tendermint Inc. It's now grants being given out to multiple.
00:22:25.230 - 00:23:13.146, Speaker C: You know, earlier on, it used to be sort of more of a blank check sort of thing, where tendermint would go off and do whatever it needs and then send a bill for it at the end of the year. But now it's much more sort of objective based, where it's like, okay, these are the things that we're going to do. And there's more competition for these grants from the ICF as well, because there are many more development companies within the cosmos ecosystem now, some that were foreign by sort of companies that splintered off of Henderman, but also some that are just from brand new projects altogether. Like, for example, region. That's a team that sort of started using the Cosmos SDK because they wanted to build their own project with it. But then they've just started contributing a lot more and more to the Cosmos core development as well. So they've been doing a lot of really good work.
00:23:13.146 - 00:23:52.310, Speaker C: And then also what's also cool is now there's also some funding coming from the Cosmos hub governance itself, because what happens is a percentage of all inflation gets put into what's called the community pool, and the governance of the Cosmos hub can use the community pool to make payouts to do sort of different things. And so two of the things that have already been approved was one figment network, which is the name of a validator. They were approved to do a lot of great governance documentation. And then there's another company called Confio. They were approved continued development on Cosmwasm, which is a smart contracting system that they're developing.
00:23:53.130 - 00:24:28.354, Speaker B: Yeah. So really, it's kind of introducing a bit of a market economy around the protocol, and we all know the benefits of competition. So with hindsight retrospectively, if you're kind of sat in front of a founder now, and they're rolling out a new protocol, likely not going to be a layer one, given where we're at, but some kind of primitive. What lessons are there in the cosmos journey, it sounds like. I know there's been drama, but where hasn't there been drama? I would say in the blockchain space.
00:24:28.392 - 00:24:30.398, Speaker C: The marks of a mature ecosystem.
00:24:30.574 - 00:24:42.486, Speaker B: Yeah, right, exactly. But the place that you find yourself in today looks pretty good. But is there anything with hindsight you would recommend to be done differently to.
00:24:42.508 - 00:25:30.562, Speaker C: A founder if they were starting out? Sort of a recommendation I would have to many founders, based on some of the experiences at Tenderman, I think Zaki put it really well. Zaki mania. And he had this tweet where he said, for all, I don't want this to come across as if I'm attacking. Know, I've talked to Jay about a lot of these things, and he agrees that some of these were issues. And so we're on pretty good terms about this. But the way Zaki phrased it was for all of Jay's brilliance in designing decentralized protocols, he failed to sufficiently decentralize tendermint as a company. And it got into this position where sort of, Jay was the CEO and the largest shareholder and the only board member.
00:25:30.562 - 00:26:22.694, Speaker C: And I think this sort of led to some problems where when he becomes a byzantine node, I think maybe back in January, maybe he was having some issues with certain things, and he kind of started acting a bit bizarrely. And that kind of concerned a lot of people, especially given the amount of control he has in the company. And so one thing I would recommend to founders would be, is to really make sure that you don't build yourself into this central point of failure. And so this is something that's great now, which is happening where Jay has actually, he switched to a CTO role. We have a new CEO, and we actually just expanded the board as well. So these are sort of. Tenderman is also sort of learning from its mistakes and improving as well.
00:26:22.892 - 00:26:36.566, Speaker B: This isn't unique to blockchain. Right. You could make equal arguments about Facebook and the power that Zuckerberg has over that through preferential shares and any other open source communities which are largely benevolent dictatorships.
00:26:36.598 - 00:26:36.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:36.768 - 00:27:22.886, Speaker B: They have lots of contributors, but there's still ultimately somebody whose voice swings the community. And clearly, there is a requirement for there to be a strong voice that the community can rally around. But, of course, as projects evolve, and I think people sometimes forget that entrepreneurs are also people. Right. And they're kind of evolving and maturing and learning as they go, as well as the organization. So I definitely don't think this is anything specific to cosmos or even blockchain more generally. So when we look at your kind of main competitor, and I don't know if you see it in those terms with Polkadot.
00:27:22.918 - 00:27:23.162, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:23.216 - 00:27:50.660, Speaker B: I don't know if you see this as a zero sum winner takes all or these different networks can coexist, but you've kind of taken different approaches to rolling out. Cosmos came off the ramps much quicker than Polkadot. Was that intentional? Was that kind of a design choice compared to, say, Polkadot? And what do you think the advantages of that approach of rolling out?
00:27:51.110 - 00:28:56.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say one of the differences between the Cosmos team's mindset from the Polkadot team's mindset early on, I think it's changed since then. But early on, Cosmos took a much more iterative approach. We were like, okay, first we're building tendermint, and we released that and had people using tendermin core, then we're going to build the Cosmos SDK and just release that and have people start building on the Cosmos SDK, then now we're building IDC, then we'll release that and have people start using that. The Polkadot team sort of wanted to go for sort of a more finished product as their initial product, where they wanted to have the full fledged system with shared security and cross chain and everything all at once, and that's what they wanted to launch with. And so I think that was sort of one of the main differences. Cosmos, we also want to go towards shared security. That's also a goal of ours, but that's the next step after IBC.
00:28:56.434 - 00:29:58.554, Speaker C: And so this iterative versus all out approach has been one of the main differences. But I think since then, the Polkadot team actually has realized that maybe this iterative approach does also make sense, because if you look at the Polkadot chain that's launching today, it doesn't actually have parachains or anything like that right now. So I think they've also realized that sort of this iterative approach is the correct one. And I guess the other main difference is we really try to see Cosmos and the Cosmos hub as two somewhat distinct projects. The Polkadot relay chain is the Polkadot ecosystem. And so what that means is, in Cosmos, we take a sovereign first approach where, know, you want to build a blockchain using the, you know, go use the Cosmos SDK, and you can have your own validator set. And then if you don't want to find your own validator set.
00:29:58.554 - 00:30:50.342, Speaker C: The Cosmos hub will eventually be able to have sort of shared security where if you want to, you can opt in to having that. Well, Polkadot sort of by default assumes everyone wants to use Polkadot security, and you can go use their toolkit like substrate to go build a separate chain. But it's not really their core focus per se. And so that, I would say, is one of the main differences. And from a collaboration versus competitive point of view, I would say that the Cosmos vision is pretty collaborative with the Polkadot One, where the vision of Cosmos is just get as many chains being built and connect them all together using a standard protocol. So there's a company in the Cosmos ecosystem called Chorus one. They're actually in the process of developing an IBC module for substrate.
00:30:50.342 - 00:31:29.746, Speaker C: So that way you can have Cosmos SDK based chains talking to parity. Substrate based chains. For me, I love substrate as well. I've developed chains using substrate. And so whether people want to use Cosmos SDK or substrate, I'm happy with both. As long as they're all using IBC and talking to each other, I would say, eventually, down the road, I think the Cosmos hub and Polkadot are maybe more competitive because they're basically going to be offering similar features, which is this shared security. And so I think those two will start to maybe compete more going down the road, but both of them aren't even at the point yet where they're offering those shared security features.
00:31:29.938 - 00:32:03.460, Speaker B: Yeah, and I was going to say you can't really talk about market share at the moment because there isn't really a market. Right. It's who's going to help grow the industry most effectively. And again, I think that's why it's really interesting to speak to you because of your experience in onboarding developers, maybe to stay at the high level for the purpose of founders on here, that might not be so technical, that might not necessarily fully understand how cosmos works. Could you just give, like, a very high level on hubs and zones and how that works?
00:32:03.830 - 00:32:50.606, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So the idea of cosmos is sort of build your own chain. So if you have an application you want to build, instead of building it as a smart contract on another chain, like Ethereum, as you mentioned, I call it the empire model. We recommend you go off and build it on your own chain, where your community sort of owns this chain, you're never subject to weird governance stuff that happens on the other chain. If your code has a bug, your community can decide whether to revert it or not. You don't have to go off and try to convince this massive Ethereum community to do it. And quite honestly, I would say many projects don't actually benefit much from being on Ethereum.
00:32:50.606 - 00:33:35.406, Speaker C: Like, I can give an example, which is Makerdao. Makerdao doesn't get any security from being on Ethereum, because realistically, what happens is in Makerdao, you get your security either from the security of the MKR token controls governance, or the security of ETH, which controls the operation layer. If you wanted to break maker, you wouldn't attack ETH, you would attack MKR. What this means is that if you're using Dai, you're actually only getting the security of MKR, but you're paying for the security of ETH in the form of on chain fees. And, you know, this is also why I call it the empire model. You have to pay your fees in someone else's currency.
00:33:35.518 - 00:33:43.620, Speaker B: So the difference is, for example, that you have this wide scale economic integration, but you have the political diversity. And I really like that.
00:33:44.310 - 00:34:20.698, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So empires basically try to get economic integration. You allow people in Italy to trade with Persia because you put them all in one political sphere. The idea of Cosmos and know the modern world order is that we can get large scale economic integration without the large scale political integration. We get this through. A lot of technologies made this possible. One is like free trade zones, institutions like the UN and the World bank.
00:34:20.698 - 00:35:10.270, Speaker C: And I think one of the most important is containerization. Containerization is this idea, like, basically in the 70s, if you ever go to the docks, you see all those shipping containers. It's like every shipping container in the world follows the same standards and dimensions. Any ship can pick up this box full of any good in any port in the world and transport it to any other port in the world, and they know it will be able to be unloaded properly. And so this containerization of shipping crates is sort of how we see IBC is like, the goal is to build this standard protocol of like, okay, all messages that are outgoing between chains, they have to at least follow these common standards. So that way we can get all these chains talking to each other. Yeah.
00:35:10.270 - 00:35:53.162, Speaker C: So the idea was build maker on your own chain, build auger on your own chain, build Xerox on your own chain. And then we can connect all these chains and have them start talking to each other using IBC. Where the cosmos hub comes in is it kind of offers two things. One is, let's say, two chains. Let's say my chain is built using the Cosmos SDK and it knows tendermint consensus. And your chain is built using parity substrate and, you know, the whole grandpa babe consensus system. If I want to talk to your chain, I would have to add, we call these ICSs interchange standards.
00:35:53.162 - 00:36:28.950, Speaker C: So I'd have to upgrade my chain to support the interchange standard to talk to your chain. But now, let's say a third chain comes along. It's built using agorics like system with a different consensus protocol. Well, now both these chains have to upgrade to support that. And so you don't want to constantly be upgrading your chain to be up to date with, so you can connect to everyone else. The idea is the cosmos hub can act as this sort of universal translator where you just have to be able to talk to the hub and the hub can talk to everyone else. Sort of like what ISPs do today.
00:36:28.950 - 00:36:55.140, Speaker C: Right? Like you don't connect to everyone over the Internet. You have these sort of ISPs that do this sort of hub and spoke sort of connecting. And then the other feature it will add, the main thing it offers is those sort of shared security like features where it's a highly secure chain and it can sort of lease out its security to other new chains that want to borrow it and be able to bootstrap their security.
00:36:56.150 - 00:37:43.550, Speaker B: Yeah, and we're seeing huge traction. I mean, you mentioned agoric. They're one of our portfolio. But I know of several others who have started out building what might be considered a layer one and are very quickly migrating over into, say, cosmos. And the kind of reasoning that I've heard beyond even interoperability, actually, is that for them to achieve the same level of security and network hardening, it would just take too much money and too much time and distract them from applying it to the use case. And what I found is a lot of infrastructure was built because somebody just wanted to execute on an application and they couldn't. The infrastructure wasn't there, and they ended up kind of moving down the stack.
00:37:46.290 - 00:37:58.790, Speaker C: When I was at consensus, there was a lot of stuff I wanted to build, and I was just not happy with solidity development, which is one of the reasons I switched. I started working on Cosmos, where I want this development process to be much easier.
00:37:59.530 - 00:38:42.690, Speaker B: Yeah. And so if we look at some of the stats in terms of the traction with tenement and Cosmos, I think it's 6 billion plus dollars in digital assets secured on the cosmos blockchain. Just under 9000 GitHub stars on telemit projects, 100 plus projects in the ecosystem now actively working. So as the interface to the community. And as we said, I think success isn't market share now, but growing, effectively growing the ecosystem. How are you seeing that success? And I guess in your day to day, when you're at Tenderman actively, what does that involve?
00:38:43.990 - 00:40:07.866, Speaker C: Yeah, so some of the main things that we're looking for is we look at the number of chains, like people that are starting to build new Cosmos SDK based chains. That was sort of one of our primary metrics, as well as one of the things that we try to focus on is cross collaboration and communication between teams using the Cosmos SDK. So one of the whole premises of the Cosmos SDK is it's built using this very modular architecture. So if, let's say, the Kava team, they go ahead for their use case, they built an auctions module because for their CDP system, well, you have your own chain that's doing something else, but you happen to also need an auction system. And so you want to be able to sort of borrow that auctions module that Kavar has written and reuse it in your own chain. And so this sort of cross collaboration is also another sort of important piece that we look towards. And so one of the shining examples of this is that cosmosm project I mentioned, where it was originally started at a hackathon, like last year, but now more and more chains in the Cosmos community are starting to use cosmosm.
00:40:07.866 - 00:40:33.160, Speaker C: So terra Enigma is, for sort of example, they are using cosmosm, but then they're adding their own whole privacy stuff to it. And so it's turning out to be this really cool piece of completely community originated infrastructure that is becoming this very key piece throughout the cosmos ecosystem. So I guess that's another piece that we look towards.
00:40:33.610 - 00:41:11.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess, as you say, in the instance of enigma, and I know several others who believe that in their instance of cosmos, they will have some specialist functionality. But one of the benefits is that that can then be leveraged by the wider cosmos ecosystem rather than just in their own instance. So obviously, that promises for some really great rate of innovation to be coming out from across that ecosystem as a whole. So your next thing is. So is this your first founder initiative?
00:41:12.030 - 00:41:58.386, Speaker C: I founded Sika about close to two years ago now. So while I was at tendermint, what happened? Know, so tendermint is like a for profit company. And so we were considering running validators, but we kind of decided that, you know what? Maybe if Tendermint runs validators, it would become too centralized and we would just get too much delegation. And so instead, what we did was, we know any employee that wants to go run their own validator, you can go ahead and do so. And what this kind of does is it distributes the reputation that Tendermint would get and kind of distributes it over a couple of different validators. And so a couple of validators came out of this such know, occlusion, cryptium labs, umbrella, a couple others. And so sicko was one of them.
00:41:58.386 - 00:42:48.274, Speaker C: So I started it with one of my coworkers at Tenderman and also my friend from blockchain at Berkeley. And so we started sicka and we started running it. To be honest, I started it as a way to improve my core development work, where it's like, if I'm developing infrastructure for the core Internet, I want to also run an ISP company just so I can be a user of my own tools. And so that's sort of how, and then going through it, it just started doing better and better. And we quickly became one of the largest validators on Cosmos Hub, and then we started running on some more chains. So we joined Kaba, and we are also now the second largest validator on Kaba as well. So excel just became a larger and larger thing, and so excited to see where it goes next.
00:42:48.274 - 00:42:50.270, Speaker C: But, yeah, that's sort of the story of seca.
00:42:50.430 - 00:43:02.866, Speaker B: And how do you see that space evolving? How do you avoid commodification, and how do you maintain margins? How do you see that market forming?
00:43:03.058 - 00:44:09.622, Speaker C: It's going to be a tough one, to be honest. I think it's a really tough market. I think validators really are going to become heavily commoditized. I think what's going to happen is we're going to see a larger rise of exchange validators. But really just what's going to have to happen is validators have to differentiate themselves and they have to provide other services or just use validation as a loss leader towards other services. So there's this big movement of staking is defi, but running a validator without providing some proprietary or some advantages, like integration with the defi ecosystem, I think that has to be the future where people can stake with you, but then they can also go use your tokens, and when they stake with you, they get some other benefits on some other protocol. Here, an example I've seen is like, initial delegation offerings.
00:44:09.622 - 00:44:52.460, Speaker C: This is like an idea I had a little while ago, which is a lot of the people running validators are building other chains as well. So like, for example, four ball is one that they're building their own chain called Desmos, but they're also a major validator and so they could do something where it's like, hey, instead of doing an ICO, but instead put their commission rate as to something maybe higher than usual, let's say 20 30%. But say like, hey, the longer people delegate to us, you get tokens on this new chain as well. So that's like an interesting example where you do have to have something where it's like you want to make it. So delegators are not just going to the highest want, you want them to have something else they're going to.
00:44:53.070 - 00:45:12.158, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a really interesting idea about how you kind of create stickiness around that. Look, Sonny, it's been great having you on, conscious of your time. I really appreciate your candidness and I think it's going to be really interesting for people to understand how the ecosystem is evolving there. I wish you the best luck with Seeker and thanks for coming on today.
