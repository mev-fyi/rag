00:00:00.240 - 00:00:59.144, Speaker A: We really think of intents as a primitive that enable a lot of more advanced on chain and even off chain actions. But ultimately intents are just a user express constraint on the state of the chain. That's to say effectively as a user, when you express an intent, you're saying, I want this next state update to reflect a specific change for me. Yeah, I'm happy to sort of expand on that. Fundamentally I see intense more basically like a mediated pattern. Right. So in the context of interactions then intent to just use their output, carry something for them and then in the context of protocol design, the protocol developer in building the protocol assume there are going to be off chain agents available to help them achieve what they want.
00:00:59.144 - 00:01:19.804, Speaker A: I think from user point of view they intend just introduce off chain agent. So from users point of view they no longer interact blockchains directly. They interact first with the agent. Like travel booking agent. Right. Interact with them instead of the airlines. We see that pattern is intense centric.
