00:00:00.520 - 00:00:34.770, Speaker A: Kalani is the platform for solvers to build solvers in networks. And the way we talk about it is we want to make solvers like app or Dapp, because today they're not. We want to provide a platform solvers very similar as dapps. Right. So you can just focus on writing software and then people like to planning. You can collaborate with other solvers to co propose solutions and delegate operations to specialists. Well, just here.
00:00:34.770 - 00:00:51.554, Speaker A: And for example, most people just delegate operation of your infrastructure to ensure provider. But basically with Kalani, solvers become application. Right. So you deploy modules to Kalani and then you just run Kalani node that you're solver. So that's all right.
