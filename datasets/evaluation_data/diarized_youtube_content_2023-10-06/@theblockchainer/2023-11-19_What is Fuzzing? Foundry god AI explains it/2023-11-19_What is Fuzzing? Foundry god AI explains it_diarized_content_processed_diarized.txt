00:00:00.250 - 00:00:54.986, Speaker A: What is fuzzing? Get ready for some alphaboys. Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is a technique where invalid, unexpected, or random data is passed into a system to discover coding errors and security loopholes. When applied to web applications, fuzzing targets common web vulnerabilities by determining data injection points to identify which entry points might be susceptible to such or abilities. What's the idea of fuzzing? Let's give an example so we can clearly understand the idea of fuzzing. Let's say you have a program that asks for your age and you're supposed to type in a number. Fuzzing would be like having a disobedient robot that instead of typing in a number like 30 types in all sorts of weird stuff like banana, a really long number like 999-9999 or even nothing at all to see how the program reacts.
