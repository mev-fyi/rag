00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.862, Speaker A: You.
00:00:00.996 - 00:00:34.662, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Today we're here with 33 audits and we're actually going to be about, we're going to be speaking about a nice topic. It's about private audits and stuff related to how 33 audits is getting his private, private clients. How does the process look like? What do you do when all developers run away and don't contact you for a few weeks? Right. And all different stuff that it might be useful. Maybe you can start telling us about the process of getting private audits. Maybe.
00:00:34.662 - 00:00:35.526, Speaker B: How do you handle it?
00:00:35.548 - 00:01:06.642, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I'll do a quick intro as well. My name is 33 audits. I've been auditing for almost a year now. Started auditing at the beginning of this year. I was a solidity developer at consensus software for about three years prior to this. And my journey in private audits was a bit weird because when I left consensus, I still had some connections with folks there.
00:01:06.642 - 00:02:10.680, Speaker A: And so my first private audit that I ever got was actually through a friend of a friend. And so that was obviously a privilege because a lot of private auditors, people who are auditing, they don't have those easy connections. But it was also really important for me to establish kind of my business acumen and my business skills. And I feel like that helped as well for me to get a ton of private audits in the future because it gave me a ton of skills, like how to deal with the client, how to make sure the client is happy, how to address any of the concerns, how to help them manage their risk, because they don't really know who I am. And so I have to present myself in a way that actually sells the services that I have, but also sells the skills that I have and legitimizes them, validates them. Right? I'm not just some person online that's saying I can do these things that I actually can't do. So that process was really interesting.
00:02:10.680 - 00:03:14.650, Speaker A: My first private auto client was earlier this year, maybe in April. I was able to find one high, one medium, and then from there, things kind of slowed down significantly. Yeah, well, and that's when I was like, okay, I need to actually find work in a way that is consistent, that isn't 100% reliant on old connections that I have, and that is reliant on the work that I'm producing now, and also reliant on some type of structure that is repeatable for all the future clients. And that's when I started, maybe in July, I started going crazy in contests. Like, I started participating in contests July alone, I participated in five different contests, and I was able to find a ton of vulnerabilities, like three highs, I think, maybe like eight mediums. I made it to the top 100 in code hawks. I made it to the top 200 on code arena.
00:03:14.650 - 00:03:57.510, Speaker A: And I think the thing that I did that was a bit different from a lot of other folks is I turned every single issue, every single thing that I did into a marketing post. So every single bug that I found, every single bug that I didn't find as well, but that I read from the report, after the report came out, I turned all of that into threads, all of that into blog posts. I think I have four or five blog posts right now. One's on ERC 20 issues, another one is on account abstraction issues. Another one's on layer zero issues. All of those are basically just bugs that I found. And I took those bugs and turned them into articles.
00:03:57.510 - 00:04:00.780, Speaker A: And those articles. Then I.
00:04:01.150 - 00:04:21.600, Speaker B: Good approach. Yeah. I'm actually wondering, what do you think it will get you or anyone more private audits, participating in more contests or working on your actual brand or marketing, as you're saying?
00:04:22.130 - 00:04:33.714, Speaker A: That's a great question. So you need to have stuff to market. That's what's extremely important. And that's what happened with me. Right. I had this first private audit that came to a friend, but then nothing happened for me. And I was like, well, it makes sense.
00:04:33.714 - 00:04:50.162, Speaker A: I have nothing to market. I have no content. I have nothing that I can show to the world. Like, hey, here's proof that I can actually do this task. I can do this thing that I'm selling. I can provide value to you. And so that's why I went very deep in contest for the month of July, August, September.
00:04:50.162 - 00:05:18.690, Speaker A: I was just grinding in contests and trying to find as many bugs as I can. And what you notice as well is if you're an auditor right now and you feel, I don't know what to write about on Twitter, I don't know how people come up with content. I look at whatever bytes, 32 page off some of these bigger accounts, and they always have stuff to talk about. It's because they're actually auditing. And as you audit, things will just naturally come to you. Like, oh, I just learned this new thing. I didn't know this before.
00:05:18.690 - 00:05:49.740, Speaker A: I should make a Twitter thread and write about this and put it out there. And so, turning everything that you find, and I tell people this when they ask me about marketing help. Everything can turn into a Twitter thread. Everything can turn into a blog. Post. Everything can turn into marketing material if you just think of it properly. I have conversations with people sometimes when they ask me questions in discord and I answer their questions and I'm like, oh, man, I could actually turn this answer into a whole Twitter thread and turn it into a post.
00:05:49.740 - 00:06:17.400, Speaker A: And I think a lot of, uh, they either don't feel comfortable doing that or they feel caught up. They get too caught up on what should I market? When in reality, everything that you're doing every day is marketable, it's just how you kind of spin it. I think. Yeah, if you're in a position where you don't know what to do or you don't have anything to market, grind in contests and you'll have more than enough content to put out there.
00:06:18.170 - 00:06:59.300, Speaker B: From my side, it was like even from day one, I started, I decided that, well, first of all, I didn't have whom to share with what I was learning. It was a lot of information and very complex stuff, especially when you're starting and overwhelming. So I decided, obviously, I didn't have any followers or anything on Twitter. I opened a brand new account and I said, I am just going to write about it. I need to learn it. And as I learn it, I will write it. First it was only on Twitter, then I started, as you're saying, write posts or blogs about it.
00:06:59.300 - 00:07:38.074, Speaker B: And I think it's this, it's just what you do every day. It counts because at least you're showing that you have been learning about it or that you're able to write about it. And if you're able to write about it, most likely you understand it. Because if you help anyone else to understand, then definitely you kind of, or you should understand it at least to some extent. So, yeah, I can totally agree with that. And I am actually wondering, I don't know if it was one of the first times we spoke. I think I asked you because I was starting with the first private audits I had, and I think I asked you about the quote.
00:07:38.074 - 00:07:48.340, Speaker B: So how do you quote the client? Do you have a system that you decide depending on the lines of code or complexity, or you have a fixed amount or how do you handle that?
00:07:49.030 - 00:08:31.642, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's a great question because that has changed and it should change, right. The more private audits you get, you should be changing your pitch, you should be changing how you're price scoping. You should be changing until it gets to a point to where it's consistent. You want it to be consistent. Obviously, I'm not saying like, it should change for every client. But if you're learning and you're just getting private audits, and you're just getting private audits, you're going to quote over quote some clients and you're going to underquote some clients, and that's just part of the learning process. But as you do it more and more and more, you'll realize what your sweet spot is in order to actually quote clients properly, and it'll be a little bit more consistent.
00:08:31.642 - 00:09:26.258, Speaker A: What I noticed is the first thing that I try to do is I try to ask what a client's budget is. Client comes to me, hey, how much do you charge? First question I'll ask them back is, well, what is your budget for security? So I could just get a bit of an idea of what their range is because it's really hard to just quote based on just like a first glance at the code, right. You kind of need to sit with the code. You need to understand the complexity, what interfaces it's using, what other protocols it's interacting with, how complex is the math. A lot of these things go into play, but the first thing I do is obviously source lines of code. I'll run it through solidity code metrics, get the source line of code so I can get an idea how big the code base is. From there, I can more or less tell a little bit like what my baseline amount of hours is going to be.
00:09:26.258 - 00:10:14.574, Speaker A: I do everything mostly based hourly, and then based on the complexity of the code, I start to pad it with more hours or even double the amount of hours. And I always add some extra time at the end for report generation, fixed reviews, and just you need to pad your time. If you think that something's going to take you 30 hours, add 10 hours to it, because there's always those unexpected gotchas, nuances, obstacles that you were not used to that are going to show up. And from there, I'll pad the time a little bit. And I kind of base the hourly on the client's budget. Like, I have a range of what I like to make, but if the client's budget is a little bit lower. But I think they're really cool.
00:10:14.574 - 00:10:41.474, Speaker A: Like, I'm working with a client right now where they're a smaller project. It's only two devs, and they did have a bit of a smaller budget. But I really like the project. It's like a subscription based project where you can basically sign up for subscriptions, monthly subscriptions. And I really thought it was a different, innovative project. That I haven't seen yet. And they use, I don't know if people have heard of, like superfluid, but they use superfluid that does payment streams.
00:10:41.474 - 00:11:18.154, Speaker A: So you could stream payments like micro payments. So I thought it was really cool use case as well. And so I quoted them a little bit under what I normally quoted just because I really like the team and I really wanted to work with them, to continue to work with them. But the process of quoting, the process of price scoping, even with traditional firms, is so based on, obviously, it's based on number of lines of code complexity, but it's also based on market demand. It's based on what's going on in the market. There's been times this year where the market's been a bit slower, so I've been willing to take a little bit less. There's times like now where things are getting extremely busy.
00:11:18.154 - 00:12:15.174, Speaker A: So I'm kind of quoting clients more and they're actually willing to pay more because they understand that the demand is a bit higher, so prices should be higher. But overall, this process of price scoping comes through just trying and failing and trying and failing, and then finding a pricing formula that really works for you and works for your clients. You want to be able to obviously work for what you think is worth your time, but also be able to provide value for your clients for a price that is affordable and reasonable to them. And so, yeah, my process is, I have it a little solidified now. It's kind of what I describe. It's getting the number of lines of code, getting the complexity, asking what the client's budget is, seeing, what the project is seeing. If it's also the amount of research that I'll have to do in order to understand this project.
00:12:15.174 - 00:12:58.818, Speaker A: Is it something that's simple? Like, is it a defi project, staking project? I've audited a ton of those before, so I know it's going to be easy for me. Or is it something brand new? They're using like layer zero omnichan cross chain swaps, and I'm going to have to learn all about layer zero. So I'm going to price that into the quote. That's going to be priced into the quote. And don't undersell yourself. I think a lot of auditors are giving these low prices because they really want to get work. But I would say that you want to charge an amount that you actually think is going to make you put in the effort to find all the bugs possible and to spend as much time finding the amount of bugs.
00:12:58.818 - 00:13:43.746, Speaker A: Our goal is to find as many bugs as possible. And so you want to be able to be well compensated for that. And as well, as we've seen recently, protocols get hacked because $100,000 because of they were using Zero slippage. Very basic things these clients would. If you position yourself well, you could position in a way of just like, hey, yeah, you're going to pay me $10,000 for this audit, but I'm going to save you future. And you have to remember that that is your pitch, right? That's the type of value that you're providing. I don't know if that fully answered, but absolutely.
00:13:43.746 - 00:13:45.090, Speaker A: It's a bit flex.
00:13:45.750 - 00:14:23.842, Speaker B: It answered even to the point that I think I am going to take your advice. And to be fair, I say that because it came back to my mind. Like when I am in an interview for a new job and they ask you about the salary range, I found a way to never actually say an amount, but to bring back the question to them. I always have them telling me the range of the salary that they expect to give and that then I am winning there. Right. Because I could give an amount, it could be much more, and then they discard me, or a little and they accept and I lose. Right.
00:14:23.842 - 00:14:31.442, Speaker B: So I think exactly. I should be taking that approach also on quoting. So thanks for that. Absolutely. That's so cool.
00:14:31.496 - 00:15:03.934, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, just to add to that too, I think it also displays to you and to your client how important security is to them. If you ask them what their budget for security is and they tell you zero, or they tell you 10,000, then you can take a step back and you're like, okay, these people aren't even thinking about security. Or these people take security seriously and they're willing to spend some money in order to get that quality review, security review, whatever we want to call.
00:15:03.972 - 00:15:19.780, Speaker B: That's cool. So you mentioned lately you're getting more frequently clients. So are you handling all of those on your own or you're collaborating with anyone or how do you handle that big amount of work?
00:15:20.470 - 00:15:41.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it depends. I have a couple of clients. I have two clients right now that are on retainer. Those are kind of my core clients. Most of those I'm doing solo. Any client that is having me do development, I'll do development for them. But I'll always get another auditor to come in and take a look at it because you need to.
00:15:41.114 - 00:16:37.530, Speaker A: You obviously have a bias for your own code, so it's not safe to audit your own code. That's at least my belief. So for situations like that, I'll bring in another auditor, either somebody that I've worked with in the past, or I'm working also with Opensense. And we're basically building out essentially what is like a firm that will sit under opensense. And it's basically like a catalog of auditors that we have of people that misentropic has either worked with before or you've interviewed, and they all have different skill sets, all have different specialties. And anytime that either I get overloaded or any clients that come directly to opensense as well, we've been kind of like building teams for these clients based on their needs. So that's been really cool.
00:16:37.530 - 00:17:32.762, Speaker A: And we have a couple of announcements coming out next year to kind of explain that a little bit more. But that was one of the recent audits that we did, which was for a liquid staking derivative, was a team that was put together by me and misintrophic. He brought in two senior researchers and I brought in two junior researchers, and we kind of built a team. And this has been a way for us to be able to have a lot of flexibility around hiring. Also, there are some clients, whether it be complexity or the size of the code, that just needs more auditors. One person can't do it by themselves. And so it's a way that we can easily pull people for specific engagements or specific lengths of time without them needing to work for the auditing firm or be full time working for us.
00:17:32.762 - 00:18:06.018, Speaker A: Right. It's almost like a catalog of independent auditors that we can reach out to and bring in. So that is part of what I'm doing. And then me as well, I just have two or three go to people who I can trust, who I've worked with before that when I'm like, hey, I need some extra help this week, I can just kind of call on them. And I think that's going to become big in the next year as we see the market grow. Because one thing that I realized very early is my time isn't scalable. I have at most 80 hours a week that I can dedicate to auditing.
00:18:06.018 - 00:18:54.374, Speaker A: And I don't know, maybe that could be one audit a week, two audits a week, and there's going to be more clients than there is time that I have a week. And so what I can do is I can guarantee that these clients can get the work that they need at quality that they need while also scaling the business. Right. And so I can bring in an auditor and I can get them work and I'll take 20% for being the one that recommend that handled the business deal or recommended them to these auditors. And I'll also do kind of like a review of that person's work, like quality control in the work. Right. To make sure that it's up to par and it doesn't tarnish my brand or my name as well because I'm co signing on that.
00:18:54.374 - 00:19:19.646, Speaker A: So that's been very popular. It's kind of co signing other auditors and saying like, hey, I don't have the time to do it this week, but I've worked with this person. They're amazing. I'm going to hand you off to them. And I'll also double check the work that they did to make sure it's up to quality with work that I would do anyway. So that's becoming more and more popular as we go into what I believe is a bull run. Other people skeptical of what I believe.
00:19:19.668 - 00:20:20.130, Speaker B: Is, yeah, I think it's a solid approach because at some point I also thought about it also maybe some projects or some clients might have some simple project. And also you can give opportunity to some more junior auditor that could benefit from the experience. And at the same time, you focus on other of the million things you have to do and. Yeah, that's cool. So maybe you can tell us how do you handle more or less from beginning to end? I mean, I don't want to focus that much on approach or if you analyze it or so on, but I'm wondering if you're more going through entry points of the project or if you actually. Something else I wanted to ask is about how much testing do you do? How do you focus more or less your audits? What's your go to approach?
00:20:21.670 - 00:21:19.186, Speaker A: So, like coming into an audit, let's say I'm auditor. Yeah, it's kind of like a mixed bag of things. When I start a new audit, obviously it's the things that everyone says, right. You want to understand a documentation, you want to read through the documentation, understand at a high level what this system is trying to do, what it's intended to do, and get a very high level idea of how all the different parts work together, how all the different parts connect. And then also you start coming up with interesting ways that you can potentially break it. At that point, I'll probably start to look into the code and I do a bit of a few different things when I look into the code, because I come from solidity, developer background. It's kind of easy to, not easy, but I can kind of look at code and get an idea for this person's development style.
00:21:19.186 - 00:22:28.406, Speaker A: And you can also get an idea of, does this person take security seriously? Do they take gas optimization seriously? Just through a quick glance at the code, you can start to analyze. And then I sit with the code and I maybe study it for a day or two. And I genuinely believe on taking space, like going outside for the walk, going whatever, first swim, going to do something, and taking some space from the code. And that's when you start to come up with some of the more unique, innovative ways to break things. And outside of those easy to spot bugs that you just see during your first couple of days of looking at code, you start to think of more the creative bugs and more of the bugs that are unique to the code base and to the implementation. From there, I found that actually writing my report throughout the process is really helpful, because when you write the report, you have to create proof of concepts. As you create those proof of concepts, you obviously have to deal with the tests.
00:22:28.406 - 00:22:35.218, Speaker A: And as you start digging into tests, you start finding other things and you start to uncover.
00:22:35.414 - 00:22:58.360, Speaker B: What testing approaches do you use? Are you based on foundry with fussing environment tests? Because lately I'm learning a lot about testing different, I mean, the thousand approaches, different techniques that there are, and I'm curious if you make a lot of use of them or you find issues in a different way.
00:22:59.530 - 00:23:37.698, Speaker A: Yeah, so I myself don't. I'm still getting better, like writing fuzz tests and variant tests and all this. But I do think one approach that helped, one of the projects that I'm working on now is all their tests are written in hard hat. I think a great approach is rewrite those tests in foundry and also write your own tests for things that may not have been tested, like they had maybe 67% test coverage. So as I started testing some of the functions that were untested, I started to find issues also testing for. I noticed a lot of devs don't test for unhappy paths. So they don't test that.
00:23:37.698 - 00:24:40.040, Speaker A: Things should revert when they're supposed to revert. They don't test that. Whatever a function that you're only supposed to be able to call once, you're not able to call more than multiple times. And so when you start doing that as well, you start to uncover a bunch of different bugs or a bunch of different gotchas, things that you didn't expect to happen. And so I believe that even if you don't, yourself don't want to rewrite the tests or write your own fuzz tests. It's super helpful to look through the tests to try to just like, I don't know, write tests, run happy, pass, like I was saying, or try different, try to make certain functions revert because you just start to uncover so much about the code and you also understand what the devs were trying to do versus what the code actually does. The testers are extremely important as an auditor because it shows you so much about what the code actually does.
00:24:40.040 - 00:25:14.158, Speaker A: So those are a few different paths. There's now, like tons of tools, obviously, that you can use outside of fuzz testings. There's one called Naria AI and audit wizard as well, that'll kind of write, they kind of write tests for you in a, like, they give you a few test cases already to start with. And those are really helpful too, because they have visualizations where you can kind of follow using like a flowchart, what the functions are intended to do.
00:25:14.244 - 00:25:27.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in three days, if I'm not mistaken. As of today, twelveth of December, there is a new thing coming from the guys. And actually, I'm going to speak about that on my YouTube channel.
00:25:27.910 - 00:25:50.070, Speaker A: Nice. Yes, this is perfect. I promise this wasn't a paid shill. It's just something that I've seen before. I've used naria, naria nar y AI. It's very similar to what audit wizard is building. You kind of put your code base in there and they give you very simple basic test cases for you to start from and then build from those.
00:25:50.070 - 00:26:18.630, Speaker A: But they have visualizations as well. So this function is calling this function on this other contract, blah blah blah. And it's very useful for you to get high level overview. And that's another thing too, with more complex code bases. I think I do this more in contest than I do in private audits. But diagrams have been super helpful to my understanding, drawing them the, I don't know how to pronounce it, excalier draw.
00:26:18.700 - 00:26:20.040, Speaker B: Or something like that.
00:26:20.410 - 00:26:54.078, Speaker A: Excalibur draw. Yeah. And I have an iPad with the Apple pencil, so it's very easy to kind of draw things out. So I usually have my iPad on one side, code base on the other. And with foundry, if you use like verbose mode, you can actually see which functions are being called when you kind of the execution flow. So I'll try to draw out that execution flow also in a diagram. And once you put things in diagram, you start to see weird situations where you can exploit or take advantage of certain scenarios.
00:26:54.078 - 00:26:55.902, Speaker A: So that's also very helpful.
00:26:56.046 - 00:27:05.460, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, I bought some time ago, a whiteboard actually, but then I discovered Calidra and I think it's less work with Excalidro and it's still nice.
00:27:05.910 - 00:27:08.230, Speaker A: Yeah, less mess for sure.
00:27:08.380 - 00:27:53.060, Speaker B: Exactly. And leaving a bit the process aside. So I'm also interested to know, how do you handle the client's expectations? And I gave you an example because, for instance, in one of the private audits I made, the client came back to me and say, hey, but you didn't say anything about this part of the code, about this function. You didn't tell me if there is a bug here or not and they had other requests or something. But I say it's interesting. What's their understanding? So how do you handle their expectations? What's the collaboration you have with them?
00:27:53.590 - 00:28:30.430, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good question. I think in any business relationship, setting the proper expectations up front is extremely important. And I also think under promising and over delivering is extremely important as well with any client. So what I mean about that is if you think something is going to take you 40 hours, tell the client that it's going to take you. And maybe not in this exact scenario, because if you're getting paid hourly, it'll obviously make a difference. But if you think you get something done in two days, tell the client that it's going to take you three days. And if you get it done quicker, great, they're going to be super happy because you got it done quicker than you thought.
00:28:30.430 - 00:29:15.322, Speaker A: But if not, you gave yourself that extra room. Right? And what I do with a lot of my clients, I'm like, hey, I'm here to help you, but I'm not going to find all the bugs. If you want to actually have proper security, you need to get multiple audits by multiple different auditors and potentially in multiple different styles as well. So I make it very clear that I'm going to do my best to find as many bugs as possible. But as we've seen with Kyberswap, as we've seen with multiple different protocols, you could get as many audits as you can. You could have a really good bug bounty program. Two hundred k, million dollars, highest max bounty.
00:29:15.322 - 00:29:51.690, Speaker A: You could even have paid out a ton of bounties. And there still could exist a bug in your code. Right? And I think Patrick Collins recently tweeted about this. He was like, no matter how many audits you get, there's always going to exist a bug. So having an incident response plan is also extremely important. And so you could also set that up with your clients. You could let them know, hey, in case there is a bug, here's what we're going to do in order to try to decrease the amount of risk or decrease the amount of loss.
00:29:51.690 - 00:30:40.380, Speaker A: And this just goes back to just good business practice anyway, just setting expectations up front with your clients is extremely important. Not leaving them waiting, not leaving them guessing. Having that excellent customer service will cause less issues for you. Even when something does come up, even when a client's like, hey, you didn't look at this function, or you didn't tell me about this function, at least you set the expectations up front, like, well, in 40 hours, that's what we agreed on. That time is limited. I can only get to so much of the code. If you want me to have 100% certainty that I covered every function, then I need 80 hours or I need 100 hours.
00:30:40.910 - 00:31:13.140, Speaker B: The thing is that the question was more in general, in the report, we add the issues, right? Like we add, if something is wrong, then we mention it. So when I analyzed that, when I reviewed that function, I think it was, it was okay. It was fine. I didn't find, at least I didn't find any issue. And they asked me, why didn't you add anything about it? So maybe their expectation was, I want to know that this part is correct, that there is no bug there.
00:31:13.830 - 00:31:14.862, Speaker A: Got you.
00:31:15.016 - 00:32:14.166, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe they should also, it's not like they didn't give much documentation, to be fair. So I think the expectations, actually the invariant, are very necessary for it to order. There is also, I think, in some contests I've seen that the protocols add their potential risks, I think they call it or something. So you can look into that as their fears or their insecurities of their code, and then you need to analyze it and try to break it. So then, yes, then that's their expectation. They want you to check that. I think you mentioned some time ago how to deal with the unexpected curveballs, like with devs disappearing for conferences or things like that.
00:32:14.166 - 00:32:15.990, Speaker B: How do you handle delays?
00:32:16.970 - 00:33:27.166, Speaker A: Yeah, delays are so delays happen on both ends, I think being clear, as when they happen on your end, and you are the auditor, you want to be extremely clear why they happened. And you also want to reassure your customer that in the future you're going to use this as an opportunity to in the future, be a little bit clearer or try to give a more accurate timeline on how long something would take. And when the opposite happens, sometimes the devs disappear or devs get busy for me, throughout that experience, when it happened recently on an audit, I just had to be really clear with my auditors. I had to be really clear. They were kind of like, hey, what's going on? We haven't heard from the client. When's the second half of the payment going to come? And I just had to be really clear on what was going on, be fully transparent, and I think consistent updates, it comes back to really good business acumen. Right? It's kind of like when your plane is delayed, you're sitting on the plane and you have no idea how long you're going to take off.
00:33:27.166 - 00:33:52.182, Speaker A: You're like, I don't know if I'm going to take off in an hour or take off in 20 minutes. And then when the captain comes on and says, hey, something wrong in the engine? We're working on it. I'll give you an update as soon as I can. And then the pilot comes back again in 20 minutes, is like, hey, we're almost done. It's going to be another 20 minutes and then we'll take off. Those updates actually make the people on the plane feel a lot calmer, feel a lot more engaged. They feel like they know what's going on.
00:33:52.182 - 00:34:24.800, Speaker A: Granted, it's not going to make the situation better, but it'll make everybody feel like they actually know what's going on. So I think communication is super important. More transparent now, more transparency and have as much transparency and you don't have to lie. You could just be clear. You could be like, hey, client ended up, whatever, having an issue at home. They're off this week and so we're just waiting for them to get back that transparency. And people just want to know what's going on a lot of times.
00:34:24.800 - 00:35:08.800, Speaker A: And you'll notice that people tend to be a lot more calm and okay when they know what's going on versus when they're just like, I have no idea what's going on, when I'm going to hear back. So I think a lot of that is just part of probably managing, again, managing people's expectations and people keeping people updated on what the situation is both on the client side and the other side. If you're delayed on something, on turning something in, I always side with honesty. I'm like, just be as honest you can with the client. Like, hey, this took way longer than we expected, but I'm pretty sure I could have it back to you within the next 24 hours, which is a little later than what we expected, but that's what we're dealing with now.
00:35:10.610 - 00:35:35.240, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely helpful and changing a bit the topic. So how do you see the future of auditing? To be more specific, is it going to be more common in the future, more huge firms auditing or it is going rather more for private audits? What do you think about it?
00:35:35.930 - 00:36:12.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this debate has been going on for a while now. I think traditional firms hold their place. Right. They've built some of the tools that we use today. They obviously laid the foundation for us. But I do think that independent auditors are going to be the future and the market is going to like demand for them is going to grow as we get better at marketing, as we get better at branding, and as we get better at teaming up. I do see teams of independent auditors being huge over the next few years.
00:36:12.258 - 00:36:57.890, Speaker A: I think that people would prefer to work independently. First off, if you market yourself well and if you are good at what you do, you can make more money than you would at a firm. And we've kind of talked about this, but you go to a firm to get an audit, they charge you in a bull run. I know of traditional firms that were charging between 30 to auditor per week. They charge you 30 auditor per week. Takes them three weeks to do your engagement and they staff you with a junior auditor and a senior auditor. So you really have like one person that really has a lot of experience looking at your code and another person who kind of has experience but is learning on the gig.
00:36:57.890 - 00:37:33.626, Speaker A: And you're paying the same price for both of them, right. You're paying the same amount for the junior auditor that you are for the senior auditor. So you're paying eighty k a week, let's say, in this example, whereas you can just go to code arena and get some of the best auditors out of the top 100. Majority of them are senior auditors. You know exactly who's auditing your code, you know exactly what they specialize in. You know exactly how many bugs they found previously. If you're a lending protocol, you can go to any lending protocol that has done a contest on code arena and get all the top auditors from all the lending protocols.
00:37:33.626 - 00:38:08.182, Speaker A: And you know that they specialize in lending like they're good in lending and you contact them, you get them to come audit your protocol. It usually ends up being cheaper and it's more specific, more specialized. And on top of that, like I said, you don't have a junior person and a senior person. You can get three senior people for less than what you would at a firm getting a junior and a senior. The problem with that is I think companies don't like projects. Don't know this yet. This whole idea of independent researcher is still fairly new.
00:38:08.182 - 00:38:59.570, Speaker A: It's only been like this year and a little bit of last year that this has been kind of growing and developing and the market's been growing for this. And so we ourselves need to get better, like branding, marketing and selling our product or our services, which is auditing. And I think you're starting to see a lot more posts about this, obviously, paz off bytes 32. They've done a great job. Like Milo truck has just put out a really good blog post as well on a lot of these things that I think that post alone is going to help bring in a ton of new auditors next year, but at least now they'll have better framework of how to kind of build themselves up. I think independent auditors are the future, but I still think we got a little bit of work to do on the marketing.
00:38:59.730 - 00:39:30.658, Speaker B: It feels like it's been here, maybe not forever, but for very long. But to be fair, I don't want to say a year because probably more than there were before, obviously, it's just that way less people. But yeah, I think in this 2023 it's been getting more popular, I guess, unless I'mistaken. But I think so. Especially people like Pashov. Right. He started, I think, at the beginning of the year.
00:39:30.658 - 00:39:51.046, Speaker B: I still remember his tweets of him saying that he's reviewing every single report from trust, I think it was. And what, a few months after he's telling how much money he's going to invest in buying stuff anyways.
00:39:51.158 - 00:40:16.606, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's a good point. There was trust that came before, and I think trust did a great job of setting up a private auditing business. Right. They have trust security, which kind of like a spearbit, and obviously we have spirit bit. But I think Pajov also kind of pushed a lot of this forward for us because he kind of gave us a roadmap as well as C Michael. Right. C.
00:40:16.606 - 00:40:49.606, Speaker A: Michael also gave us a roadmap of how to do like, this is how I did it and this is how you could do it. And now there's tons of other private auditors like know bytes and they're also giving us their roadmap. Yeah, exactly. Me as well, giving us the roadmap. And then from there you'll start to see, I think it solidify a bit more. I'm really bullish on independent auditors. But I do think this conversation that we're having as well, there is a piece missing.
00:40:49.606 - 00:41:23.302, Speaker A: Like how do I market myself? How do I make it known to these projects? But the opposite is also true. In the bull run, some of these traditional firms were charging, like what I was saying, 30 auditor per week and they had a backlog of six months worth of audit. They were booked out for the next six months and projects are going to want to release. They're going to want to come out as quick as possible, and they know they need that audit. And when they're going to go to a traditional firm, traditional firm is going to be like, I can't get you for another six months. So they're going to be like, well, what's next?
00:41:23.436 - 00:41:32.650, Speaker B: Yeah. So how do you think we can bring more awareness of security to those new protocols, new projects, all those developers?
00:41:34.910 - 00:42:01.362, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the marketing is key. Right? I think there's so many people in the top 100 who are amazing auditors. When I say top 100, I mean on the leaderboard, in code arena who are amazing auditors. And a lot of people don't know they exist. A lot of people don't know that they can find bugs. A lot of people don't know what these people specialize in. A lot of people don't know their past history.
00:42:01.362 - 00:42:27.942, Speaker A: So it's really what I was telling you at the beginning of the conversation is like every bug you find should, in my opinion, but could turn into a tweet, a Twitter thread, could turn into a blog post, could turn into a video. And that content is extremely important. I think cypherin is doing a great job of that. They've moved to education. Right. And they're using education as a way to market their auditing firm.
00:42:28.006 - 00:43:12.330, Speaker B: Yeah. But something I'm thinking about, how many of those people that read our tweets are actually developers and not auditors? What's the reach of our sharings, actually? Because. Yeah, that's a way of giving awareness. Right. To the people. But is it our community on Twitter mainly auditors are trying to get better, or are those, well, let's say solidity rust developers actually also in our community and they are getting absorbing this knowledge. What do you think about it? Do you think it's common to.
00:43:12.330 - 00:43:23.270, Speaker B: It's a mix or it's more auditors and not many developers that are actually. What do you mean? What we post got you.
00:43:23.360 - 00:44:04.074, Speaker A: Yeah. So you're saying, like, who's actually, I had a recent tweet about this and I think there's a lot of auditors that also need to work on their target audience. So they post things and they kind of post it for other auditors to read. They make blog posts, they make content. They just post Twitter threads. And really, whether it be you're trying to get more private audits or you're just trying to bring awareness around auditing in general, security in general, like smart contract security in general, your target audience should actually be developers, ceos, ctos, projects themselves. Right.
00:44:04.074 - 00:44:59.450, Speaker A: And so if your post is super deep in the technical about security and you're talking about like fuzz testing and you're talking about how you found all these bugs to, I don't know, all these different methods that you chose. While that's great for other auditors, and we really love that and we absorb that, if your goal is to try to get more clients, if your goal is just try to spread more security knowledge, you almost have to know you kind of change the story that you're telling, the narrator that you're telling to cater to the people that you're trying to target. And I think a lot of us as auditors, we're just kind of bad at that. We put things on Twitter, and it's true. It's mostly for other auditors. Yeah. Like a CEO is going to look at that and be like, I have no idea what this says, and just keep scrolling through Twitter.
00:44:59.450 - 00:45:54.762, Speaker A: And there's a lot of big. If you abstract even more what we're doing, a lot of us aren't auditors who know, well, we are. We're auditors who tweet. But the way that I abstracted myself, I'm like, I'm actually a Twitter marketer. That's what I do. And the service that I'm selling is auditing versus being like, I'm an auditor who tweets. And so if I start to study Twitter marketing, if I start to study how the fitness bro sells fitness on Twitter and how whatever the yoga teacher uses Twitter to find her clients, there's things that all these people understand that I could actually use in order for me to better find clients, in order for me to better spread my knowledge, and in order for me to reach a wider audience that isn't just for auditors.
00:45:54.762 - 00:46:01.898, Speaker A: Because we can kind of get stuck in our echo chamber of just like, auditor, auditor, auditor, and we're actually never leaving our niche.
00:46:02.074 - 00:46:09.060, Speaker B: What I was afraid. Do you follow NFT God, by the way?
00:46:09.670 - 00:46:10.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I do.
00:46:11.990 - 00:46:52.430, Speaker B: Because he's all the time sharing about actually how to grow your reach. Actually and I must say I have applied, especially the way I write my tweets and some of the things that related to the algorithm, Twitter algorithm, and I think he's writing many things. So it's because it's worked. I say he's right because I have tried this way and the way he says it, and he's not paying for naming his name. I don't think he's going to hear this, but actually useful.
00:46:53.010 - 00:47:23.258, Speaker A: And he's like, I mean, people have certain opinions about him, controversial, but I do agree with you. There's certain marketing, specific to marketing stuff that he has shared that is very alpha. I think another one is JK Molina. He's a little douchey, whatever. People have certain opinions of him. But again, if you abstract from the personal what your opinion of what you think about this person and actually listen to what they're saying when it comes to marketing, they actually know what they're talking about. And that's why they've been able to grow these.
00:47:23.258 - 00:47:54.494, Speaker A: If you think the biggest account in our space probably has like 25,000 followers, right? Totally. But that's crypto in general. There's crypto traders who have hundreds of thousands of followers. And so if we abstract a little bit more and we zoom out a little bit more, we can target audiences that are outside of just the super technical auditors. And those are actually the people that need our services. Those are the people who are launching protocols without getting audits. Those are the people that actually need help with their projects.
00:47:54.494 - 00:48:50.098, Speaker A: And they don't even really know we exist because we're targeting a lot of our content to people that are just like us. And I said this, hey, if you want to make friends and become popular in the auditing space, then keep targeting auditors. But if your goal is to grow your business, if your goal is to make more money, then you need to think about who your target audience is and how you're targeting them. I did a post, I think, a couple of months ago just to try something different. I did like an analysis on this Defi protocol that I myself was invested in, and I would look through all of their previous audits and spotted anything that I thought was worthy of talking about. But I also did it in a similar way where these DeFi researchers would. And so it was a bit of a technical post, but it could cater to anybody who's just investing in Defi.
00:48:50.098 - 00:49:14.110, Speaker A: And that was an attempt to just do something different. But that's kind of what I'm talking about, is try to target an audience and look at other people too, right? Like look at maybe Defi researchers who are doing Twitter threads about products that they're using and see how they're creating their tweets and then do one that's similar thing, but from a security perspective.
00:49:14.450 - 00:50:00.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it makes a big difference. To be fair, I try to apply it all the. Also, I'm sometimes a bit confused with sharing external links like YouTube links or the medium ones. That's why usually when I post a new video, I usually don't add the YouTube link because I heard that it's not too good for the algorithm for reach. That's why I say the link to my YouTube channel is in my profile. That way two things happen. First, it's that I don't have an external link, so that helps.
00:50:00.530 - 00:50:30.950, Speaker B: Second, interested people will go to my profile and that's engagement. So that counts. And they are interested in my profile. Then they may either enter on my YouTube channel or stay in my profile. And second thing or a third thing, it's also that tweet. Usually it's long form tweet, so they first need to extend it. So that way you get people interacting with the tweet and that's what counts.
00:50:31.450 - 00:50:32.200, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:50:33.610 - 00:51:13.570, Speaker B: And that I got that information from studying other accounts, as you're saying, from following different people. And it's not only about learning, auditing and solidity and so on. Actually, this is what I wanted to ask about, but we're already speaking about it. How to build your brand, like how to put your name out there. And it's not only about saying, okay, yes, I need to be the best, or study reports or whatever. It's just you need to figure out also how to write, actually how to write especially.
00:51:13.720 - 00:51:15.140, Speaker A: Exactly, because.
00:51:18.570 - 00:51:22.962, Speaker B: We'Re already speaking about it. But any advice to build your brand.
00:51:23.026 - 00:51:49.466, Speaker A: For people to build their brand, it's 100%. All this stuff that we're talking about, I think first, obviously, is having a consistent brand across all platforms, like Discord, everything. Name should be the same, pictures should be the same. Right. There's an idea on Twitter about conversions, like how many people went to your profile and how many people actually followed you. Right. And you can get analytics on all this, like how many people visited your profile.
00:51:49.466 - 00:52:22.762, Speaker A: Reason people are probably not converting to followers is because there's a mismatch between your bio and your picture and your pin tweet and then your first, most recent tweets. And so it's things that you don't think about, but all of that matters, right? Because it's the same thing that you do when you go to somebody else's page. If you tweet something that goes viral and I go to your page, I'm going to read your bio, see what your page is about, look at your picture, and then probably read your pin tweet. And within 5 seconds I'm going to decide whether I want to follow you or not.
00:52:22.816 - 00:52:27.386, Speaker B: It's a very quick, the bill is an important thing.
00:52:27.568 - 00:53:19.946, Speaker A: It's huge. And all of this stuff that I'm talking about, I didn't just learn on my own, I just went on YouTube and searched Twitter marketing. And obviously there's very clickbait YouTube videos like make as a Twitter marketer. But move past the clickbaitness and actually study these videos and watch these videos and do research on this, and you'll learn so much alpha, you'll learn so much about how to set up your Twitter in a way to where you'll get conversions. Like I told JK Molina, he has a whole step by step guide on how to turn a lead into how to close a lead, how to get somebody in your Twitter dms like, hey, curious about your services to actually getting them to send you money online. And he has this entire guide that he wrote of how to get from there. And it's not just him.
00:53:19.946 - 00:53:49.686, Speaker A: You can find all of this online, but there's tons of this alpha out there. And it's what I was saying before is we need to step outside of ourselves and realize that again. And this is just if your goal is to build a business and make money. But that's my goal. I realize I am a Twitter marketer and what I am selling is auditing services and development services. I am not an auditor or developer tweeting about my developer experience and auditing experience. Those are two completely different things.
00:53:49.686 - 00:54:18.800, Speaker A: And so if I study Twitter marketing, I can get better at selling my service the same way. If the service that I was selling, the example that I used earlier was fitness coaching, doesn't matter. I'm still using social media to sell this service and that process is going to be the same. And so I think just studying this and I give people these tips all the time, go on YouTube. I don't know if they really follow them though, because it's all there. All the information is there and it's all free.
00:54:19.170 - 00:55:08.622, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, besides Twitter, I'm obviously this video. I'm on YouTube and you can't imagine how many hours I have spent on those videos that are recommending how to get more viewers, how to get more engagement, how to retain the viewer, how to improve your thumbnail, how to make clickbait like not only thumbnail but title. I mean the amount of work. Jesus Christ. Yeah, it is very important. It is a mean, I know because obviously in the first videos I didn't have as many subscribers as now, but.
00:55:08.622 - 00:55:49.658, Speaker B: Well, it makes a difference, I think, from also obviously the way the content is built. But there is a moment where I actually had a little break, I think in summer. And then during that time I was watching a lot for at least a few of those videos. And when I went back to the next video, I already was using some of those techniques of title thumbnail. And the first few seconds of the video count a lot like those 1st 30 seconds are incredibly important. But yeah, the same on Twitter. It's like the hook, you need a hook there.
00:55:49.658 - 00:56:24.840, Speaker B: It doesn't matter what it is about. If it's about auditing, you can start with something that catches the attention and it will catch the attention of an auditor. It will catch the attention of someone looking for auditors. It will catch the attention for anyone that is interested about the topic or even the right words. So that someone using the search on Twitter, which maybe is not the most used, or maybe I'm just assuming there, but I think it's not. At least I don't use it much. But if you use the right words, then it can appear for anyone interested.
00:56:25.690 - 00:56:58.020, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's such a good point. I encourage people to do experiments with their own tweets. Right. I did an experiment where I tweeted something and I was like, I think it was about count abstraction. It was like count abstraction will lead to this bug probably like, I don't know, 2000 engagements, views, whatever you want to call them. And then I put another one. Are you a brand new smart contract auditor that wants to learn about the newest trend coming out? Well, let's talk about it.
00:56:58.020 - 00:57:39.134, Speaker A: Ten x what the other one did. Ten x what the other one did. And the content was the same thing. And it just goes to show that it's not really even about the content. The content matters for sure, but it plays a smaller part in the way you're marketing it. Your hook, all these things that you're saying, how you're bringing in the readers, how you're keeping people engaged, you're telling a story every time you market yourself. And so the same way you don't start a book in the middle of the deep technical content, you're going to get readers engaged, and chapter one is going to be an intro, and you're bringing them in and getting them used to it, and then you give them the deep stuff.
00:57:39.134 - 00:58:16.554, Speaker A: It's similar here, just obviously more condensed. And one thing that you said about the videos that I think is just true for all social media content. It doesn't matter if it's like Instagram, Twitter. Mr. Beast has this really good kind of quote and he's like, oh, if you put out a hundred videos on YouTube and you prove to me that you've put in out those 100 videos, I'll answer any question that you want after that about making YouTube videos. And then what he says after. He's like, only 2% of people who actually put out 100 videos have questions to ask me.
00:58:16.554 - 00:58:43.394, Speaker A: He's like, the other 98% already answered all the questions that they have by putting out those 100 videos. And so you have to try, you have to write articles, you have to put out videos, you have to tweet, because the more you do it, the more you see what sticks, the more you see what doesn't work. And it's just the same way we audit. We do shadow audits to get a feedback loop. Marketing is the same thing. Create that quick feedback loop. This work, this didn't work.
00:58:43.394 - 00:58:52.054, Speaker A: This worked. This didn't work. This led to a client. This didn't. And just do the things that work. But you have to try. Trying is like the most important thing.
00:58:52.172 - 00:59:20.000, Speaker B: Absolutely. Sometimes you will not be able to sleep, but you will like this tweet. Or this blog for me was a game changer. What did go wrong? Can't believe it. It's very good. It is very good content. Why didn't reach or why people don't preach it or I don't then something that you.
00:59:20.000 - 00:59:50.540, Speaker B: I don't know if the time. Exactly. Also, I'm a bit paranoid with the time I post either on Twitter or YouTube. But yeah, I don't know. There are a lot of things. But anyways, yeah, and I am curious about something because you mentioned to me offline, let's say that you recently have been hired by a protocol. Can you tell us more about this? How did it happen?
00:59:51.630 - 01:00:43.306, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So maybe about a month ago, I was just like looking through some contracts specifically, I think it was after the banana gun telegram bot got exploited. And I was looking at other bot projects and I found a bot project and I found some interesting stuff in their contract that I thought looked a little off. And so I reached out to them and started to discuss the issue that I found or what I believed to be an issue and created a proof of concept for it. Lo and behold, it ended up actually not being exploitable bug. And so there was like no bounty that was paid out, even though they had a bounty rewards program, but it actually led to me being hired by them. They were like, hey, we like your thinking.
01:00:43.306 - 01:01:46.154, Speaker A: We like the way that you approach this. We liked your write up, and we would love to kind of bring you on to build out our future contracts because we want somebody who thinks the way that you do and has the skills that you do. So it led to basically not fully monthly, but like a more consistent contracting, part time based engagement with them. And they brought me on as their lead solidity dev and architect to build out their new contracts. And I think it's just a really good example of providing value before you even get hired. So going to different contracts that you see, seeing how maybe you can optimize them, seeing better ways that you would architect them and design them, writing all that up and going into the discord and Twitter and being, you know, I saw your contracts. I think if you did it the way it would save you gas or you did it this way, it could avoid bugs.
01:01:46.154 - 01:02:22.940, Speaker A: And a lot of those situations may or may not, but in many cases, they can lead to work for you. Or if those teams in the future are looking to build out something, they now know, okay, there's this person that's an expert. They looked at my contracts. They know what my contracts look like, and I know that they can provide value. I know a lot of people just kind of hop in telegrams and discords like, hey, hire me. I'm an auditor. But it's a way better pitch if you actually find a way that you could provide value to a project and then say, here's something that I found that I thought would be of interest to you.
01:02:22.940 - 01:03:00.454, Speaker A: Hire me as an auditor. And I won't say this always works, but just kind of looking for ways that you could provide value to people instead of just pinging them. Like, hire me. I get this a lot in my dms, too. People are like, teach me smart contract auditing. And I think it would be a lot cooler if someone's like, hey, man, I saw you didn't have, and this is just a random example because I'm working on a website right now, but I saw you didn't have a website, and I built this quick website for you in react. You can use it.
01:03:00.454 - 01:03:07.990, Speaker A: Here's the code. And if you're ever looking for a mentee, I'm down to work with you. I would on site, I wish someone.
01:03:08.060 - 01:03:25.370, Speaker B: Would suggest to help me with my website because I have it there and I have many things I keep collecting to update and so on. I wish someone will help me to improve it. Yeah, that would be much helpful than just hey, or help me to become an auditor.
01:03:26.530 - 01:03:58.150, Speaker A: Exactly. If I wanted to work with you, I would look through all of your articles and I would write three Twitter threads based on all your articles. Be like, I wrote these three Twitter threads based on all your articles. Would you like to use them? Or I would go to your website and be like, hey, I made some design updates to your website. Saw that it's open source, made some design updates. Here's a pr, by the way, if you're ever looking for somebody to bring on to your team, I'm available. Way better than sir, please teach me auditing.
01:03:58.730 - 01:04:03.340, Speaker B: My website is open source. You can create a pr and prove it much more.
01:04:04.910 - 01:04:24.594, Speaker A: Right. And so it's just a matter if you scale out. It's just again, back to marketing. It's a way to market to yourself to say, I can provide value to you. Here's me showing and now that you become unforgettable to that person, I promise that person is not going to forget you next time they need that thing that you just did for them.
01:04:24.712 - 01:05:08.638, Speaker B: Yeah. To be fair, I've had a similar situation with Chirag. It's not like he was trying to learn or did that from web three sec news. When I was building the website, I think he reached out to say he could help me if I need any. And ever since we're actually meeting kind of regularly and same way as he helped me then obviously I was extremely grateful. So we have been in contact and anytime I could help in any way, I obviously was very happy to. It's about helping without actually wanting anything in return.
01:05:08.638 - 01:05:48.454, Speaker B: But that help, it actually brings, well, it brings you more opportunities. Not always right? But it can. So yeah, it's about trying. I mean, in a way it's also what we do by sharing knowledge auditors, because you are sharing, trying to help others and not expecting anything. Right. But if someone can support you, not with money, but I mean, with viewing your videos or reading your articles or sharing your tweets or something, then it's obviously extremely. Well, I'm grateful for that anyways.
01:05:48.454 - 01:06:14.258, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it has been super and interesting talk. So thank you a lot for sharing your journey, for sharing all your knowledge about private audits and what you have done so far. So thanks a lot, because it's also helped me, and I am going to take into account some of those advices that you share. So, yeah, thanks for having me.
01:06:14.264 - 01:06:33.846, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, man. This has been great. And I totally appreciate your content. I think we need way more video audio content in the space. So it's cool that you and a few others are really taking charge of that and kicking ass. And sorry, I don't know if I could curse, but doing a great job. Doing a great job in that space.
01:06:33.846 - 01:06:34.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:36.650 - 01:06:46.602, Speaker B: I'll try little by little with the time I have. Yeah. Okay. So thanks a lot and thanks, everyone, for watching. Bye.
01:06:46.746 - 01:06:48.730, Speaker A: Thanks, y'all. Bye.
