00:00:00.250 - 00:00:51.758, Speaker A: Hey guys, in a moment we're going to chat with one of the founders of the popular site web3 SEC News. People from web3 security community like Patrick Collins and Owen Thorn are supporting them from the beginning and you know, a lot of people have given fantastic feedback. Since everyone finds it useful and up to date, we will chat about his journey to date and how he has managed to have such a successful outcome. After the short chat, he will be showing us everything about the site and all its features such as latest hacks, smart contract auditing reports, the pod shorts and the job board. Also showcasing his newsletter. So let's start. Hey everyone, welcome to my channel today we are here with Chirag from Wealth Resec News.
00:00:51.758 - 00:00:57.200, Speaker A: Hi and welcome. So let's start, why don't you tell us a bit about yourself.
00:00:58.770 - 00:01:35.290, Speaker B: Hi Blockal, thank you for inviting me. Hello everyone, I'm Chiragrawal, the passionate mind behind Vectorsec news with my mentor and co founder Lucas Martin, CEO of Pen Testify. So with a background of Btech in computer science and information security specialization, I have been leading all things security at a stock group like it is a fintech startup based out of India and around close to two years now. And with their support and empowerment, I've dedicated my journey to explore web3 security and sharing valuable insights within the community. So yeah, that's my intro.
00:01:35.440 - 00:01:42.000, Speaker A: Thank you. So tell us, how did you get into web3 and web3 security and why?
00:01:43.250 - 00:02:26.758, Speaker B: Yeah, so my interest started in web3 security 1.5 years ago when I became aware of this evolving web3 space and the FOMo caused by NFT bubble into late 2021. So it cost my interest in this field and later I attended besides MDBAd, it's like a conference in India. So where I learned about web3 security from immunify and credential speakers. Like there were speakers that came and they were explaining about web3 security. They had some top ten bugs and they were showing about reentrancy and all those kind of bugs and it got me very fascinated. And then later I started beginning studying blockchain fundamentals and security concepts.
00:02:26.758 - 00:03:51.810, Speaker B: So while I'm still doing that, I'm learning, but early this year, so I competed in Code Farina contest and I even got some small bounties and later I competed in securium races and winning the race 14 because luckily my submission was in the top 32. During this time I witnessed the enormous potential and increasing risk in the web3 space like many hacks were going on. And I was very inspired by the potential of web3 technology. And I thought it will be great if I can be contributing to this community more actively from my security web to security experience and gaining myself and also not only informing community about what's going on and what's happening, but also nurture a collaborative community. Let's say people can come collaborate, learn and share their basically learnings in web3 and building a great future kind of in web3. So yeah, then later on I was fortunate enough for a few opportunities that I got regarding learning web3 security, writing blogs and all those things. So they have shaped me in web3 security journey and to date I have written around 100 plus high postmortems for various web3 security companies that you might have been familiar with and help them grow their business exponentially.
00:03:51.810 - 00:03:54.742, Speaker B: So yeah, that's how my journey actually started.
00:03:54.876 - 00:04:02.170, Speaker A: It's interesting, you started with or you first got into blockchain with immunify.
00:04:03.710 - 00:04:29.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I got to know from the conference, like their speakers, they came there and they were explaining. So the unified speaker came and I got introduced because I was in the conference. So there were many other topics going on and they were like very exclusive thing, kind blockchain security. And I was not aware, I was like in web two security. But I think why not explore something which is upcoming and it's a big tech that has immense potential. So yeah, that's the reason.
00:04:29.240 - 00:04:40.280, Speaker A: That's so cool. That's a fantastic way. Fantastic story actually. That's so cool. What's your experience today? Building web3 SEC for the community.
00:04:41.690 - 00:05:43.930, Speaker B: So yeah, in this eight months since its inception, web3 SEC has grown like being the largest news aggregator in web3 security news, ranking in Google search in the top. And our mission have been to empower the community by curating latest news, facilitating discussions around the community and fostering a space where people share knowledge and collaborate together. So thankfully we have got overwhelming support from the community and due to that it has led us to go to resource for industrial professionals and enthusiasts or students alike who are trying to upscale themselves in this particular community. But it's not like we are done yet. And our goal is to catalyze the growth of dynamic and inclusive community that we have. We want them to grow and that's the better vision apart from the largest news aggregator. So that's how it's going.
00:05:44.080 - 00:06:12.420, Speaker A: Okay, so you're going to show us in a moment the web3 SEC news and the site and show us how it looks so we can see all the possibilities that we have there, which is a lot of alpha a lot of nice resources. But how did you come up with the idea which day, one day woke up and say I'm going to create this, or you were inspired by someone or how did you come up with this?
00:06:13.110 - 00:07:09.426, Speaker B: Okay, when I was writing act postmortem, as I mentioned before, so I faced difficulties in finding appropriate resource. Let's say we have rec news, but rec news and all those big companies or web news website, but I didn't find it much useful for small hacks or they only cater, let's say big hacks or some big attacks. And it takes some time for them to write a blog or something so that I can consume that knowledge and write a blog. Because my task was to write a blog as soon as possible. So what I used to do was I have 2030 accounts like in Twitter, let's say biosin alert or this kind of alerts account and some Zack XBT officer CI all those accounts, I used to have my notification turned on and I used to just read and learn, understand what they share. So what happened? Sometimes people, not always people will post about something very informative. Sometimes people retweet something which is not useful.
00:07:09.426 - 00:08:02.214, Speaker B: And that used to bump in my notification in my laptop and I'm seeing what happened is something hacking but it was like some promotion or he's just saying something. So I was like, I think I can make it more productive, what I can do. Then the idea came up like when I can create kind of a script which can actually scrape some data that I want. So what I did initially, what I did is I made a dictionary, kind of like 2030 top accounts that I feel like share good, more active and share good insights. So what I did, I make a dictionary and then I made my own corpus, let's say hacks, postmortems, alerts, this kind of keywords incident, security incident, like something like that. So I made the corpus and then I wrote this script for Twitter to scrape those data and those particular tweet. So from there I did that.
00:08:02.214 - 00:08:45.086, Speaker B: And then after I wrote my script and I thought why not I share this with the community because it is helping me a lot, but there are many others who can get help. So I thought I just need to build a UI small website because I had the backend already. So I just did that. And then later on, community loved it a lot. And luckily Patrick from Siphon audits, he got interested and I connected with him and he was the first sponsor of our project. And later on audit wizard was our sponsor. And currently we have guardian audits and then we have cybers, then we have fantastifiers as sponsor and it's growing day by day.
00:08:45.086 - 00:08:46.806, Speaker B: So yeah, that's how it's going.
00:08:46.908 - 00:09:11.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the way the best things get burned, let's say because you are trying to do it for yourself, like to collect, to improve your everyday and make it easier. So that's so cool. So how about you show us, you show us how it looks and what can we find there.
00:09:12.670 - 00:09:35.602, Speaker B: So yeah, like this webtoosec news and the homepage, there are many key features that we have. And first thing that I built was latest hacks, which I was talking about, and let it load once it's loading. So yeah, this is the latest hack section.
00:09:35.666 - 00:09:50.120, Speaker A: It's a live demo. We can see that it works perfectly because otherwise sometimes in live demos, as I experience, something can go bad. But yeah, that's good. Sorry, go ahead.
00:09:50.890 - 00:10:37.334, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is kind of a timeline of some good incidents or the hags going on in the community. And we have built useful features so that you can basically search and filters like newly web3 hacks and exploits, let's say. Or if you wish. There are few keywords that are mostly people uses like discord hacks, tornado attacks, like flash vulnerabilities. These are few things that actually happens more oftenly like phishing attacks and oracle manipulation and ft rated vulnerabilities. And this kind of keywords that we have and then this kind of, let's say you are only interested to learn about what's going on in Pexell alert and you have to understand more things. So you just filter it out.
00:10:37.334 - 00:11:17.000, Speaker B: And let's say you are interested to go deep dive. You can just click on learn more and it will direct you to the exact particular tweet. And you can just scroll and understand, you can see there are a few writers and what they're explaining about in this particular image. And yeah, similarly, let's say you are someone who is just very much interested in particular, let's say NFT. You can even search it like in the search box and you will see NFD is always like all those tweets or attacks that were related to NFD. So we have this database from around 2013. So we have around ten years of data related to hacks and they can definitely go and play around.
00:11:17.000 - 00:11:20.950, Speaker B: So that's like latest hacks.
00:11:22.970 - 00:11:27.160, Speaker A: Filtered by the latest. Right on top.
00:11:28.350 - 00:12:09.982, Speaker B: Yeah, you can see like 1st December was like the latest, it was updated. So it updates like every three days. Then what happened? Like people in the community used to ask if we can have some say audit section or something which they can help us in their journey of auditing. So recently we have Community checklist where people can just write their own twitter and share their own checklist and we will actually get it live for the community. Like here. This is what community checklist look like. We have few bugs, let's say, that are mostly found in an audit.
00:12:09.982 - 00:12:42.094, Speaker B: Then if, let's say you are interested to have a proper checklist, you can even scroll this. And let's say you are not someone you want more resources. So we have collated more than like 30 plus checklists like here. You might have seen few from Burio and I also wrote a checklist before, like a smart contract audit checklist. And then bureau also wrote a great checklist. It's very comprehensive, something like that. So if you are willing to audit and to refer some checklist, you can even do that.
00:12:42.094 - 00:13:21.606, Speaker B: And this section is really creative. Let's say this mostly have almost all audit reports from code Farina. And let's say you are willing to, you can see like 15 December was the latest report that was published in Code Forina. So you can even just scroll and let's say you are interested in reading this. So you can just click on that and it will redirect you to the particular report section. As you can see it was something related to contract that have same and symbol, same name and symbol, some kind of a vulnerability that was low finding. So yeah, now let's say you are only interested to read about low risk.
00:13:21.606 - 00:13:40.158, Speaker B: You can just click on low risk and you will get all those reports. If you keep scrolling, you will see and you can even load more and all those report will come which are low severity. And if, let's say you are willing to tweet about, let's say you can just click on this and write a Twitter link and it will create a small tweet for you directly.
00:13:40.254 - 00:13:43.700, Speaker A: That's okay. That's very nice actually.
00:13:47.050 - 00:14:40.866, Speaker B: What happened? The security researcher, I asked him for some feedback so he shared me if we can integrate some kind of AI based prompt search, so what we do recently we have integrated AI. So you can just search anything. Let's say if you're not knowing something you want to search, you can just scroll and you can click, let's say modifiers. So it will search for all those bugs in codefrienda that are related to modifier. As you can see, you can even see use a modifier for access control, use modifier for better readability, this kind of thing. But let's say in future or you read about something to oracle manipulation, let's search oracle manipulation work kind of and you forgot that. Like what was the report? You can just search that and it will fetch all those reports from code Farina.
00:14:40.866 - 00:14:59.020, Speaker B: And you can even have a few filters, let's say only high severity. You want to read about oracle manipulation, you can do that like anything that comes to mind. Maybe block if you have any question or any kind of thing we can try and prompt and maybe we can check if you are getting some results for that particular thing. Do you have something.
00:15:01.470 - 00:15:10.510, Speaker A: That comes to your mind? Diamond pattern, the amount pattern. No, diamond.
00:15:11.570 - 00:15:41.706, Speaker B: Oh, diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond pattern. So let's search. If there are some reports you can see, like there are a few reports that were related to diamond pattern. In this report internally you can see it was something added to diamond. It's based on AI, so it has like 90% of what we have said. It's close to 90% of the findings that it will get. So yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:15:41.706 - 00:15:43.334, Speaker B: About this audit section.
00:15:43.462 - 00:15:56.142, Speaker A: Okay. I think it's useful to have a different kind of search there instead of just getting only by keyword. So. Yeah, good one.
00:15:56.196 - 00:16:24.950, Speaker B: Yeah, you can even search a report related to denial or something like you want, like anything or let's say ERC 20. Let's search for ERC 20, maybe. So you're just searching in English, like report related to ERC 20. C you can see the IRC 20, get ERC 20 reports and all those bugs and you can just simply click and read about them and learn about them from code for enum, you can see total supply and it was, I think high finding.
00:16:26.890 - 00:16:27.640, Speaker A: Nice.
00:16:30.030 - 00:17:19.162, Speaker B: So yeah, then the next feature that we have is like potshots, like decrypting web3 security podcasts like in five minutes. So we have exclusive partnership with proof of podcast and all those podcast summaries come into web3 SeC and you can easily come and let's say you are walking and you don't have that much time to read or basically listen to the entire video because usually podcasts are 53 minutes or one plus hours and you just want to get a glimpse and you can just read about what happened. And if you're more interested, you can then find out time and just click on, let's say this particular link and it will redirect you to the latest podcast or like the top podcast. You can see like the latest one was about Miguel Diva Vega and this is the summary of that.
00:17:19.216 - 00:17:33.520, Speaker A: Actually that's super cool. Actually I didn't check this part myself. I know you were doing this collaboration but I was not aware of this. So that's good. As an overview of what was.
00:17:35.330 - 00:17:50.226, Speaker B: And even, it's like you can even share it with the community. Let's say you are reading this and you just want, you can see like check out website and you will share that particular link with the community directly. And you can even ask people if you like it. They can even read that.
00:17:50.408 - 00:17:55.990, Speaker A: It's cool. You even created the branding of this. A pod.
00:17:58.170 - 00:18:36.418, Speaker B: Yeah. Short like podcast. In short, Lucas like co founder like he suggested let's have a podshot and I found it really great and sounds cool. So we did it. I like, like we have Patrick calling Zach all those summaries. In short like what happened and it has a good summary. You can even scroll or when you are walking, you're in the bus or you are not feeling good and you are like what's happening? And let's say you're having a fomo from proof of podcast, like what is new? I can just come and you can basically learn about it in five minutes.
00:18:36.584 - 00:18:37.620, Speaker A: That's good.
00:18:39.990 - 00:19:19.310, Speaker B: Apart from it, we have web3 security job board very specific to all security openings that comes in the industry. We have this like a job board from which caters web3 and security blockchain jobs. So you can see like I think privy and Ledger, then stockware. These are all companies had their openings. Some also mentioned about how much they are paying. You can see it's around two hundred and thirty k dollars and it's like simply you just need to click and you can go and simply apply. We also have search.
00:19:19.310 - 00:19:47.302, Speaker B: So you are like someone who was not interested in security but who is like marketing, something like that. You can even search about that. Let's say marketing has no job, nobody. So you can search about development or something. So you can get all those business development. Let's say if you're interested in rust, you can even write rust and you might get some. These are all like crust, this kind of things.
00:19:47.302 - 00:19:49.302, Speaker B: Like all openings related to rust or.
00:19:49.356 - 00:19:52.374, Speaker A: Not only web3 specific, but in.
00:19:52.412 - 00:20:38.790, Speaker B: General, yeah, it has general thing, but more specifically by default we show about web3 security, but we have many other features and all those things you can definitely explore and search all those things. That's about jobs. And let's say if you are some company who's willing to have your job so you can even click on this poster job, we have our partners like job Stash and safer and recently we did an hiring for them as well and it went really great. They were very happy about the researchers and the application. So we can even share our information and we will get your job live for the community. That's these three main features.
00:20:39.370 - 00:20:51.600, Speaker A: There's so much value there, to be fair. So that's so cool. But that's not it, right? You have an newsletter as well, right?
00:20:52.850 - 00:21:43.118, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me show you our newsletter. So this is our newsletter. And recently yesterday itself, I think today itself like 17 December we published a newsletter. So the idea is like a newsletter serves as a curated digest for the most critical updates like in web3 security. If you subscribe you will receive regular insights like ensuring you stay ahead in the fast pace this industry. You can explore latest news and this news is kind of like some exclusive news you can see like recently RBTM phase an outage or sometimes people think like crypto friendly is like crypto easy.
00:21:43.118 - 00:22:08.242, Speaker B: Sometimes people feel like if I have better user experience that actually leads to an exploit later on. So sometimes it's not the case. Like crypto friendly is like crypto easy. It's like different case. We have upcoming events. Let's say you're interested and to attend some conference or events. You can come and just learn about it and visit the nearest conference.
00:22:08.242 - 00:22:42.254, Speaker B: Then we have trending hacks. Like all those hacks that were happened the last week. We cater that and we even have, let's say official announcement about what happened. And if you want to read about what was the hack and then this is something that we make us proud. It's like community resources. We like to nurture and promote community. So we do have all those updates or tweets that you might have missed in your daily or full time job.
00:22:42.254 - 00:23:23.470, Speaker B: They can just come and understand. Let's say Dashien was recently he wrote about Medusa and I think echidna and foundry comparison and I think Medusa is winning this, that kind of thing. Like Pasha and all those researchers, I think yours as well. You are almost on all our newsletter like Local, you can see the blockchain. I think you have video about all about private audits from 33 audits. I think it was the latest one. I think you have a permanent place in our newsletter.
00:23:25.170 - 00:23:26.720, Speaker A: I was checking that today.
00:23:31.810 - 00:24:08.074, Speaker B: Let's say if you are somebody who's like to keep upscaling your skills in CTF, we actually update this every time. Let's say when there's a new CTF challenge or something. I think onlyponer has really great CTF from low to high difficulties. And yeah definitely if you are the one you can use it. And we have, let's say community. We have seen many companies like calipers. Then I think anon and all those researchers shared about what's happening and let's say find a work kind of a challenge where they share a smart contract and people can learn.
00:24:08.074 - 00:24:25.650, Speaker B: So we also try to get those and for you in that particular place so that you can upscale yourself. As of now we have like 1300 plus subscribers like almost security searchers, developers in web3. That's about it.
00:24:25.720 - 00:24:31.780, Speaker A: And how about partnerships or sponsorships, is there any possibility for that?
00:24:33.110 - 00:25:09.710, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So as I mentioned, we have really great people and companies sponsoring us. And from Joe from audit Wizard, Owen from Guardian audits and Lucas Martin, daddy Levitt from Cybers and Patrick Collins from Cypherin audits. So yeah, we believe in the strength of collaboration and web3. SEC News is open to partnership and sponsorship that align with our vision. And if you share our commitment to enhancing web3 security, let's explore how we can work together and create a safer digital environment.
00:25:12.050 - 00:25:20.420, Speaker A: A nice UI as well. So how about any new features or what plans do you have for the site?
00:25:22.310 - 00:25:57.194, Speaker B: Like looking ahead, we have exciting plans for Websec News. We are working on collaboration and academy features that aim to provide an even richer and more immersive experience to upscale your security game for our community. Additionally, we are envising expanding our reach from strategic partnerships, events and educational initiative. Like we are trying to dive more in this educational initiatives and events. So yeah I think that we have currently in our future plan and upcoming features.
00:25:57.322 - 00:26:10.850, Speaker A: That's good. I know you have lots of plans, lots of things. You're also writing articles, lots of things to maintain to medium.
00:26:12.470 - 00:27:03.902, Speaker B: Yeah. Recently in collaboration with Fuzzy wrote very deep dive about strategy, what strategy you should use for fuzzing as a solidity developer. It's like a very comprehensive digest. I think you will love to read it. And it's like have very great examples and you can see from installing to different techniques, unit testing, manual testing, fully automated and semi automated is what we use in echidna and its conclusion some example of approaches like property based and assertion based. And then we have some examples as well. And then we concluded exactly what happened, why the test case failed.
00:27:03.902 - 00:27:15.686, Speaker B: And you can see the observation was like it had an overflow vulnerability, something like that. So I'm working more on this and I'm trying to upscale myself here so definitely many more blocks to come.
00:27:15.868 - 00:27:44.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm well aware of that. Okay, so thanks a lot. I think it was nice to know more about you also to see the amazing side that you provide for resources and value for everyone for even every day. I think it would be virtually impossible to consume all the material you've got there because it keeps updating every three days. So thanks a lot for presenting that.
00:27:46.230 - 00:28:13.890, Speaker B: Thank you for being part of thank you for being part of Websec new journey and you have been integral part of in our initial date. You have been supporting us as well from the blockchainer hub and you definitely try to always give me a helping hand and we are very excited about what future holds for us and thanks again for having me on your channel and I look forward for more such sessions. Cheers.
00:28:13.970 - 00:28:19.590, Speaker A: Big plans. Thank you Chiragan thanks everyone for watching. Take care guys. Bye.
