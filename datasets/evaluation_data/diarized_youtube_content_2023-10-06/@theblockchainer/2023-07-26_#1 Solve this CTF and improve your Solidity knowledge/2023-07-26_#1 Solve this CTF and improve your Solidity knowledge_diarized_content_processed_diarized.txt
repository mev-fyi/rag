00:00:01.130 - 00:00:38.390, Speaker A: Hey guys, let's tackle a CTF provided by calyptos. Let's go. This contract is intended to allow the deployer to load some eth into the contract during deployment and later call the send ether function to send one eth from the contract to any specified address. However, there is an error in the code. Find the error. Feel free, guys, to pause the video now and try to find the error. All right guys, if you realize here in the send ether function, we have specified the amount as one, and this amount is passed to the transfer function.
00:00:38.390 - 00:00:58.330, Speaker A: The problem is that specifying one we will be sending one way, and if we want to send one ether, and as specified in the instructions, we will need to add here one ether in letters. That's all for now. If you want to take more ctfs, make sure to go to the blockchain hub.
