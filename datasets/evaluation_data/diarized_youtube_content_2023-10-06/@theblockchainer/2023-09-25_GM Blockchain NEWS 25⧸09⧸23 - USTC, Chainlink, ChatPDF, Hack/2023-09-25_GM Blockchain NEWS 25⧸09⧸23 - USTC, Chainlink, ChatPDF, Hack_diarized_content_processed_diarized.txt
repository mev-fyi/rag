00:00:00.490 - 00:00:45.882, Speaker A: Hey there, blockchain enthusiasts. Welcome to GM Blockchain News, where I bring you today's five top updates and a brain teasing riddle. Let's get started. Mixing network suffered a significant hike, losing almost 200 million as a confirmed by blockchain security consultancy slow mist. The platform, aiming to address scalability issues, relies on a centralized database presenting a single point of failure. Despite its goal facilitating efficient crosschain transfers, the bridge raises concerns about security in centralized systems. Let's go to next in the week of September 17 to 23rd, Slowmas reported seven cryptosecurity incidents with an estimated financial loss of around $380,600.
00:00:45.882 - 00:01:42.174, Speaker A: The notable trends were a surge in phishing attacks and Rockpool tactics. New attack methods included DNS hijacking, contract vulnerability, and phishing attempts. Various platforms like Unimevbot, Coinbase wallet, linear finance, BNP, pay and YR and balancer were targeted, resulting in losses. Slow Mist emphasizes the rising complexity of crypto attacks, urging users to enhance their security measures. Next chat PDF is a platform leveraging chat GPT to process PDFs. It summarizes content, answers user questions, and supports multiple languages. Unique features include source citation and a focus on security.
00:01:42.174 - 00:02:55.562, Speaker A: Target users are students, researchers and professionals, aiding exam bread research and quick comprehension of various materials. It plans to integrate GPT four, possibly with restrictions on the free plan due to costs. Chain Link faced criticism for reducing multisig signers from four of nine to four of eight, filling concerns about centralization. Critics, including researcher Chris Black, raised alarms, suggesting potential risks to the DeFi ecosystem. ChainLink defended the change, stating it was a routine signer rotation process for improved service reliability. Despite the criticism, Chain Link's native token link has seen a significant 20% gain over the last month, remaining strong in the crypto market. The terra classic community voted to cease minting and reminting of Terra Classic USD, or also known USTC tokens, with 59% in favor of protecting the community and investors.
00:02:55.562 - 00:03:41.102, Speaker A: The decision follows the collapse of Terra USD stablecoin more than a year ago, causing significant market upheaval. Terra Classic emerged from this, allowing Luna staking on its blockchain and received support from binance for upgrades aimed at eliminating token remaining. The move is seen as a step to prevent any future attempts of burning USTC by institutions. Time for a crypto reader, guys. I'm a digital code encrypted and tight, used for Transactions day and night, blocks and chains. That's my game. What's my name that brings fame? Where am I? Answer in the comments, guys.
00:03:41.102 - 00:03:42.090, Speaker A: Take care. Bye.
