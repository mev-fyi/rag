00:00:09.780 - 00:00:24.184, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. How's everyone doing today? All good. Wrapped up the whole week. You know, this is a nice, relaxing Sunday. I'm really glad to be here. We really like rocket pool. You guys are super decentralized, and we think it's a great offering that you guys have this product.
00:00:24.184 - 00:00:45.984, Speaker A: The value of gateway is especially relevant to you all. We like that you guys are decentralized. We want to keep you guys decentralized. There's a growing trend in the relay market right now where they're encouraging validators to move to them. We're bringing the relay to the validators with this product. So the tool is called the Validator Gateway. It's two products in one.
00:00:45.984 - 00:01:09.224, Speaker A: It's our BTN gateway, which is Blockshroute's bread and butter blockchain distribution network. So we're transferring data through our P to P network in very high speed, very low latency. We're the fastest mempool provider right now. We also have beacon chain data as well. That's what this is working with for the validators. So we're working on more accurate head out of stations. You guys can't even see that that's going on.
00:01:09.224 - 00:01:33.760, Speaker A: More accurate head out of stations, higher sync committee performance. Those are all considered player rewards to my knowledge. There's not a lot of well known products in the market right now that are prioritizing consensus layer rewards alongside MEV rewards. So we have two products in one with us, consensus layer with the BDN gateway and our relay proxy. Like I said, we're moving the relay to you guys. This allows for an increased block value. We're at 6.4%
00:01:33.760 - 00:02:02.392, Speaker A: right now and the lowest latency with relays anywhere in the world. So this is what it looks like. Right now we have an option for a self hosted relay proxy, but right now what we're running this year is the blockchrout node. That's nearby validators. We have one available in Singapore, Frankfurt, US, South America, Africa. Pretty much anyone, anywhere someone wants it. It's very easy for us to spin up a new one, get it right next to a validator to minimize the latency.
00:02:02.392 - 00:02:38.580, Speaker A: As you guys can see, the max profit relay is super far away from MVP boost, where the relay proxy is a lot closer. Some of the functionality here is we're streaming bids from the relay proxy or from the max profit relay to the relay proxy. So the relay proxy is effectively acting as its own relay and it's easy to integrate with the validator client. All you do is add it as an extra relay to MeV boost or vouch you're connected to a local relay. XTU. So every time I've presented this to any validator, they only care about the data. No one cares about the product, the marketing, anything like that.
00:02:38.580 - 00:03:03.090, Speaker A: People only care about the data. We've been live since January 1. We have more than 22,000 validators on there. More than 5000 blocks have been delivered to the relay proxy. There's a 6.4 average increase in block value over the next competitive relay, which is generally ultrasound and then 270% max block increase in the last 14 days and then a 0.4 east max increase in the last 14 days as well.
00:03:03.090 - 00:03:21.824, Speaker A: And the relay proxy is winning 78% of the time. So everyone understands mev block value. It's super easy to understand. 6.4% equates to more money when you're frozen a block, which doesn't happen very often. So that's why we're also working on the consensus layer rewards. Right now our initial target is head attestations.
00:03:21.824 - 00:03:38.792, Speaker A: I actually put these together out of order, so I wanted to talk through some head attestations right here. If anyone's ever queried their validators duty performance, this is what you would see. When you're looking for attestations. There's three different things. Well, there's four. There's an activity. If you're inactive, you can get slash for that.
00:03:38.792 - 00:04:10.500, Speaker A: But there's also head target source. You can see a clear example of two validators for the same epic. One got zero value for their head annotation, one got their full reward. And so this is the data that we had from some of the validators that were connected to our relay. We looked at 1000 validators, we looked at the thousand epics before the connection to the VDN with an average of 32.30 value head attestations, then 1000 epics afterwards, that average went down to 23.1. So it's about a 30% improvement on head attestations.
00:04:10.500 - 00:04:44.336, Speaker A: So for those thousand validators, it actually equates to 3.2 e per year, which those numbers add up depending on the scale of validators. So we already talked about this as the lowest global latency. We're moving the relay to you guys. We're not asking you guys to relocate with anyone. We actually had a large validator provider who operates out of APAC. Their stakeholders asked them to move to the US or EU and they're actually staying in APAC because of this solution, which I know rocket pool is very focused on.
00:04:44.336 - 00:05:13.092, Speaker A: APAC, right. So yeah, we have streamlined relay operations. Payloads are streamed directly to the relay proxy, cutting the round trip time in half for fetching a bit. So like a gither request, payloads are also streamed to the relay proxy following Githeader. So after we know that we've provided a header to the validator, we have that payload locked and loaded, ready to be published. So we're having that even faster publishing time. And the other thing that we offer with this is we offer optimized delays.
00:05:13.092 - 00:05:35.692, Speaker A: And everyone knows the hot topic right now is timing games. It's the new four letter word. But we want to talk more about what timing games are. So everyone knows timing games. People are saying they're bad. People used to say the MVP relays are bad because we're working with front runners, working with sandwich attacks, but now 99 or 95% of the blocks go through an MVV relay. No one even cares anymore.
00:05:35.692 - 00:05:56.452, Speaker A: I think timing games is the new thing to be upset about. That's my personal take. We can talk more about that afterwards if you want to. But the two main reasons it's bad, it's slower block propagation and it's also a centralization vector. So let's talk about why people do diamond games really quick. This is from PDP. They published some information about this.
00:05:56.452 - 00:06:25.120, Speaker A: Everyone knows P to P is a partaker of diamond games. They also did a lot of research about how this impacts the bid value. So as you see later into the slot, bid value goes up earlier on those values pretty well. So everyone says delays are bad though. But we're going to look at some of the timing between the two top relays right now. Block, shroud and ultrasound, both relays added delay. What we found is the more we optimize, the worse performance our relay got.
00:06:25.120 - 00:07:23.090, Speaker A: We got our githeader time down to one millisecond, which is great performance, right? But if you're returning a bid one millisecond, someone else has a slower relay waiting 100 milliseconds longer. They're going to return a later bid. So because of that, the ultrasound relay and the blockshot relay, we both add a delay during the get header request. It responds a little bit later. I tried to put some emphasis on these lines being slanted with a higher degree angle because when we look at the relay proxy, since there's lower latency, we have a longer delay that's in control of the validator with really low network latency providing that back. And then what about centralization? We are one of the I feel like we're one of the leaders in the relay space to bring the relay to the validator. We don't want to have validators co locate with relays, we don't want builders to coocate with relays, we want everyone to operate where they want to operate and we'll bring the data to them.
00:07:23.090 - 00:07:48.984, Speaker A: So like we said, we have the local blockshot node. There's also the option for self hosting the relay proxy as well. So here's our pricing scheme. Right now it's a flat fee for six months, six months or twelve months with a little bit discount for the twelve months. It's based on the number of pub keys. What this equates to though, here's the actual earnings from a validator that is connected today with 5000 validators. Their annual earnings are 74.4
00:07:48.984 - 00:08:22.610, Speaker A: E, just from MV value alone. From attestations, they're going to average about 16 e extra from the performance with the BBN, and the annual cost is only going to be 41.65 E. So yeah, in summary, the total value of the validator gateway increased earnings with consensus layer and execution layer. The timing games are in your control, or you take away the uncertainty of network latency, you stay in the region of your choice and maximize the performance of your network. And that's all I got for you.
00:08:50.020 - 00:08:51.088, Speaker B: Is quite a bit lower.
00:08:51.174 - 00:09:14.660, Speaker A: So is there room for discount? Yeah, we've been working with liquid staking providers or people that have similar billing models, or I guess revenue sharing models, as rocket pool does, withdrawing pools. We're working on a discounted solution on as high level as we can, so the node operators don't have to eat the cost more so we can have a business relationship with the provider.
00:09:17.900 - 00:09:20.612, Speaker B: Hi. So are there any additional trust assumptions.
00:09:20.676 - 00:09:22.536, Speaker A: For using the gateway versus just using.
00:09:22.558 - 00:09:24.600, Speaker B: The traditional blocks relay?
00:09:25.660 - 00:09:51.308, Speaker A: There's not. We actually ask that you use that in conjunction with multiple relays. We never ask for just exclusivity with these things. The only time we ask for exclusivity is if there's a specific compliance feature associated with that. So if you're paying for compliance, you're using everyone that can match that compliance. In terms of trust, we do offer a trusted solution to validators. So similar to how optimistic relaying works where you're trusting builders.
00:09:51.308 - 00:10:04.980, Speaker A: We trust validators not to online bundles and we publish blocks to those validators faster. So those equivocation checks and all of the signature checks that happen with those, we bypass those and give it back to the validator immediately.
00:10:07.560 - 00:10:18.120, Speaker B: One last question before we go, just a quick question. I wasn't able to do the math real fast. In the one to 100 category, where is it become profitable?
00:10:18.940 - 00:10:20.052, Speaker A: Where is it profitable?
00:10:20.116 - 00:10:24.030, Speaker B: Yeah. How many validators you need to make?
00:10:26.000 - 00:11:01.320, Speaker A: So if you add up the additional consistency rewards and the additional assumption of two blocks a year for a single validator, you will see about a four profit. We are working on a better billing model for the lower number of validators because we see the most earnings that we can grow for. This is an MEV. So the more block girls you have, the more earnings you see that year. So we are working on a better billing model for the one to 100 model. Yeah. One would be profitable.
00:11:01.320 - 00:11:04.730, Speaker A: It'd be like $4.
00:11:08.380 - 00:11:13.830, Speaker B: Section. Thanks to our guest, Ben. Thank you, guys.
