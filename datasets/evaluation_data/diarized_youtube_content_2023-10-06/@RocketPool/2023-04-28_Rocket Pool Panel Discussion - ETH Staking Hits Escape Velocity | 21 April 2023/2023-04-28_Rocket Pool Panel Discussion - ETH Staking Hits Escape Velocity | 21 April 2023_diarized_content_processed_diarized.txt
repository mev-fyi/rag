00:00:01.130 - 00:00:40.940, Speaker A: We should get Robert up soon. In the meantime, maybe we can quickly get underway. So it's been a few weeks since we had a panel like this back in the midst of time. Pre Chappella feels like a very long time ago, and now we're in an entirely new world of post withdrawals liquid staking. So I see Roberts on stage there from or nodes. We've got Benaswell from blocksrat, and of course I am Mav from Rocketpool. But we've got Langers, the general manager, who will be doing most of the talking from the rocket pool side today.
00:00:40.940 - 00:01:31.814, Speaker A: And the topic of the space is e staking hitting escape velocity. So I have to say that is a little bit of a play on rocketry terminology. But while we can and do see some staked eth escaping, as in being withdrawn at the same time there is a lot being deposited or redeposited. Obviously people who staked a long time ago may have had different options or different protocols that they have now, and they're looking to change how they're helping to secure Ethereum. We've got a little bit of an agenda to chat through today, but happy to take any questions at any time as well. You can drop them in the comments of this space's tweet. And for the rocketball community listening, I'll also try to keep an eye out in trading.
00:01:31.814 - 00:01:43.710, Speaker A: Feel free to tag me, but with that covered off, let's do a quick round of introductions. Start with Langers and then we can go through the rest of our speakers up here on stage.
00:01:47.040 - 00:02:26.650, Speaker B: Hello everybody, I'm Langers. I'm from Rocketpool, obviously, so my kind of title is general manager, general manager of the core team. But I'm obviously heavily involved in the rocket pool community generally. Rocket pool is kind of made up of the core team and then this massive community of node operators and kind of Hori holders and that sort of thing. So we've kind of got a big community there. Yeah, so it's really great to be here, obviously, and I'm looking forward to chatting to everybody else.
00:02:32.660 - 00:03:04.270, Speaker C: Cool. I'm Benjamin from blocksroute. I've been recently titled Ben the Block builder by a couple of coworkers. I am a software developer working on our builders, our mev services, and our relays as well. Definitely going to be an interesting topic today. A couple of topics today. So I'm excited to share some updates with the relays from everyone's side of relays, along with some updates to our own relay as well.
00:03:08.000 - 00:03:28.096, Speaker D: Hey. Hi everyone. This is Robert from all nodes. I'm the head of growth at all nodes. Been working in staking for a few years. Know we span a lot of protocols at all nodes, Ethereum and rocket pool being one of the key ones. And sort of happy to report that we just passed 17,000 validators yesterday.
00:03:28.096 - 00:03:38.500, Speaker D: So I guess we could talk about that a little bit further as sort of the effect of the Chappella upgrade. So I'll pass it back to you, Rockpool.
00:03:47.250 - 00:04:21.350, Speaker A: Okay, so let's start off with obviously the big topic, which is the Chapella upgrade. We've got three different protocols here who may have had different experiences, different priorities as we've gone through what is arguably the biggest change to Ethereum since the merge, and maybe we can run through one at a time again if we'd all like to share kind of our experiences, what happened the way we expected, what was maybe a little bit different. Over to you, links.
00:04:24.350 - 00:05:23.920, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think everyone here can probably attest to the fact that hard forks are always a testing time. But to be honest, Chappella went extremely well. I think the network participation rate dropped very slightly, but then bounced back up again pretty quickly over kind of a course of a couple of days. Yeah, I think I saw tweets from Danny and a few others saying that they expected 80% to be the kind of base participation rate during a hard fork. But we're actually getting at like 95 is disappointing and then it's going back up to like 98, 99. So it's a great kind of performance for that. From our side.
00:05:23.920 - 00:06:03.100, Speaker B: It's interesting because we got over 2000 node operators, so it's kind of helping them through the hard fork is very important. And I should say that it's not necessarily the core team doing that. It's actually a lot of our community volunteers that kind of help node operators get through that. And so I'm kind of clapping and I'm very grateful for them for doing that. To be honest, we didn't see a huge amount of problems. We'll probably come into this. There was a couple of.
00:06:03.100 - 00:06:15.930, Speaker B: Couple of problems which we'll kind of touch on, I think, during the questions in this agenda. But overall it was pretty successful from our perspective.
00:06:18.910 - 00:07:06.922, Speaker D: Yeah, I would sort of mirror what Darren is saying on all note sides, since we run a lot of nodes with both rocket pool, I guess, mini pools, but also EtH nodes, obviously it's kind of stressful when you're running all this infra and you have to do a pretty consequential update I would call it affecting a lot of users. But the good news is it ran very smoothly from a technical standpoint. Right. Quite different than the ETH merge, which was sort of this incredible update that took years to culminate and that went relatively smoothly. It was kind of OD because sort of the day after the merge it was like, oh, well, that's it, nothing went wrong. Right. So that was really smooth.
00:07:06.922 - 00:07:50.300, Speaker D: I'd say the withdrawal from a technical standpoint, Chappella was also incredibly smooth. From a technical standpoint. It was also sort of like, oh, everything's kind of working. Obviously there was a couple of little kinks here and there depending on the client. But the one thing I would say that was quite different, comparing those two sizable updates was more from the consumer approach or more from the user approach. The merge really required nothing on part of the end user or the staker, whereas the withdrawals, you had a lot of people doing a lot of things right. Maybe they wanted to see how their rewards work, maybe they didn't understand how the rewards worked and they thought they had to do something.
00:07:50.300 - 00:08:39.130, Speaker D: Obviously some people wanted to exit, some people wanted to enter. And so on our side of the fence we dealt with a pretty overwhelming amount of user questions and customer support. So that was really interesting to work through. And I guess sort of the technical part of that, that made that I guess, a bit challenging was any older addresses on the updating to the new address, because of course we couldn't really be involved in that process. Right. So we had to educate users using something like Yiftu or that was a typical go to on how to update their addresses, which is withdrawal address, which is of course a one time thing and it's irreversible. So stressful for customer support, but really smooth for the technicals.
00:08:42.610 - 00:09:44.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I could definitely mirror the sentiment that this upgrade seemed very smooth. It was a lot less exciting overall than the big merge that happened back in September. But yeah, there were a few issues that came up, but definitely got to give a shout out to the Ethereum foundation. They were on call and ready and helping all relay operators, notifying builders about different issues. And I think that the issues were pretty consolidated to specific services, but they were also resolved very quickly, which is a good testament to the people that were working on them. Plus I did appreciate that this network upgrade was during the day hours for my time zone, but I definitely felt the pain of the european and asian time zones, probably australian time zones as well. With that upgrade.
00:09:54.240 - 00:11:12.004, Speaker D: I could jump in here and give you guys, a little side note, if that's cool, something I'd like to shine more light on, which was just this really cool side story that I don't think got any press at all. So there was this really cool EIP called 47 36. It didn't make it into the consensus client, but it was still a proposal that was worked on for over a year. And what this proposal was, was to allow for basically withdrawal protections for people who had compromised wallets before the withdrawal. So, meaning like, imagine two years ago you got hacked or were compromised, your keys, your mnemonic or your key, and imagine you've been sitting there for, waiting for this day with dread because you know that a hacker was going know, exit your eth and steal it all. And so a guy named Benjamin Chaudroff and also the guys over at Attestant worked on this EIP to safeguard any compromised mnemonics and keys all the way up until the date of the withdrawals. I won't get into the technicals of this.
00:11:12.004 - 00:11:44.530, Speaker D: So all nodes participated by basically helping them along the process and allowing them to use our nodes during this process. And sort of the end result of this is I ran the numbers, I think about $128,000,000 worth of Ethereum was, I wouldn't say saved, I would say like more safeguarded from people who knew they were compromised or people who suspected they were compromised and sort of went off without a hitch. So I just wanted to tell that story. It's kind of cool.
00:11:46.340 - 00:12:14.010, Speaker C: That's awesome. Yeah. I was on a space a couple of weeks ago or a week before the merge. One of the topics they brought up was seeing any fallout from people who had compromised wallets that didn't realize it, compromised withdrawals that didn't realize it. But that's not something I usually am aware of. I was wondering if you guys had seen any of that happen on any nodes there or any other staking services.
00:12:15.420 - 00:13:00.608, Speaker D: Well, this was years in the making to be so. This was on the Ethereum Foundation's website as sort of a call out in the community. There was a Twitter feed, even a standalone web page, basically, if you thought your validator was compromised, I think about a year and a half to submit it. And then that date was cut off about a month ago because they needed time to prepare everything, basically for the Chappella upgrade. So again, without getting into the details, I hope the word got out enough. I found it out about it personally late in the process, even though all notes was involved in it for quite some time. But I don't know the exact number of validators.
00:13:00.608 - 00:13:13.500, Speaker D: It was a lot though. The equivalent in us dollars was about $128,000,000. So divide that by 32 is the amount of validators that participated in the protection.
00:13:17.600 - 00:13:18.590, Speaker C: That's great.
00:13:19.280 - 00:13:44.180, Speaker D: Just to note, it's like a one time thing though, right? I don't know if it gets. I didn't want to get into technicals, but it's a one time thing. And if you google eip 47 36, you'll see all the websites related to this. But it was a one time thing basically when you set your withdrawal address. And so they basically are unwinding all the Twitter accounts and websites because obviously it's over with Chapella being upgraded.
00:13:46.280 - 00:13:54.970, Speaker A: We've got one question coming in from the Twitter comments. Maybe this is one for you langers. It's pretty straightforward. How do I generate re?
00:13:59.440 - 00:14:25.700, Speaker B: Okay, you simply swap eth for re and then you are staking. We can touch on liquid staking, but that's essentially liquid staking. Liquid staking is a token swap. You just swap eth for the liquid staking token. In our case re and then you are staking. It's super simple. It's the simplest way of staking your eth.
00:14:28.620 - 00:15:11.430, Speaker A: Well, there we go. Simple question, simple answer. In fact, if you go to stake rocketpool. Net, the website has a very clever router which can direct your transaction to swap either on secondary markets or interact with the protocol directly to make sure that you get the best deal. As we know, in the past some liquid staking tokens have deviated away from their peg, some more than others. I should put peg in air quotes because it's not exactly a peg. But in this post withdrawal worlds, especially with rocket pool, there are some interesting mechanics that can help to keep the price closer to where we might expect it.
00:15:12.200 - 00:15:12.564, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:15:12.602 - 00:15:20.680, Speaker A: Do you want to touch on that a little bit, Langas, how we expect to see deposits and withdrawals affecting that relationship going forwards?
00:15:23.180 - 00:16:44.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, in a post kind of Chappella world, maintaining the peg becomes a little bit easier in the sense that there's kind of like an arbitrage opportunity on the way in and on the way out for node operators. So if the LST is trading at a premium, then there's actually like an Arb opportunity on the way in for depositing, which essentially means that a node operator can get an extra little reward, a little bump for depositing into the protocol. If it's trading at a discount, there's also an opportunity for people to exit and Arb on the way out as well. That mechanism is still kind of like playing out at the moment. It's quite stable, but that mechanism will kind of be in place. And so there's definitely that now there's these two opportunities to bring the LST back to peg, and also there's kind of greater liquidity. There's greater liquidity generally, and so that also helps with kind of maintaining that position as well.
00:16:52.390 - 00:18:16.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I can bring up some of the issues that we saw during the chapella upgrade that were impacting proposers and then see how that was impacting anyone at rocket pool and kind of what the upgrade process was to fix that. So everyone knows Chapella upgrade happened on Thursday. All of the validators, every beacon node, every geth node, everything had to successfully roll over to start supporting the new block format that included those withdrawals and operations. What we saw initially was that most relays were providing blocks correctly. During the first epic, we did notice a pretty steep increase in the amount of missed slots due to all kinds of reasons. After the first epic from the upgraded happened and the second epic came around, the number of missed slots went back down to somewhat normal but still high. All of the relay operators from Flashbotch, ultrasound block, native block, shroud, all of us were in a group chat and actively monitoring the status of these different blocks, and we quickly noticed that there was a theme of missed slots caused by an invalid signature.
00:18:16.090 - 00:19:00.170, Speaker C: So the signature that needed to be used for capella blocks had to change compared to Bellatrix blocks. There's a post mortem from PriSm with this, but the issue was isolated to prism clients specifically using mev relays through mev boost. So that was quickly resolved by the Prism team. I think they had an update ready to go within 2 hours. All of the relay operators were able to block any githeader requests. Well, not block but return an empty header for Githeader requests which would keep them from using any external blocks. That was done almost immediately after the announcement to all the different relay operators.
00:19:00.170 - 00:19:24.450, Speaker C: Let me think what else was there? So yeah, everyone who was running validators using Prism V four had to upgrade to their hot fix 4.0.1. And that was a very quick upgrade process for the Prism team. Yeah, it was an interesting issue that was quickly resolved, caught and resolved by the different communities.
00:19:27.030 - 00:19:39.670, Speaker D: I read it briefly. We don't run prism, so it didn't affect all nodes. But did anyone see in the post mortem why it wasn't caught during the test phase?
00:19:43.730 - 00:20:06.120, Speaker C: That was one of the questions I had as well, we just talked about it today briefly on a relay operator community call. I think they mentioned it on there, but I think I was also replying to a user during the mention. But I can also follow up after this with a tweet that clarifies more of the post mortem and give a TLDR on it.
00:20:08.570 - 00:20:50.200, Speaker B: Yeah, a shout out to the prison team for being so responsive in that getting a release out in 2 hours is pretty impressive. So that's definitely great that they're that responsive. I mean, from our perspective, obviously we need to kind of get our node operators through. Prism is probably our least, maybe it is least used client. It might be, might be second least or something like that. And so it's not as bad for us, but we certainly do need to kind of coach people through that from our perspective. I think we heard about it quite quickly.
00:20:50.200 - 00:21:24.320, Speaker B: As soon as the release was ready, we put out the new release. So people can actually upgrade manually. They don't have to wait for like a smart node release, they can just change the docker container that they use so they can do that. And that got them back on track, which is really great. It's great to get some insight into what was happening under the hood. It must have been an interesting time for you guys.
00:21:25.330 - 00:22:22.420, Speaker C: Yeah, everyone was confused. We were trying to figure out what was going on. Our first instinct is always that it's probably our fault that things weren't working. And so I think all relays were seeing those issues and investigating internally, then sharing that information together and realizing that there was a common trend for the network requests. So we were actually able to identify what client it was because the user agent was the same for all of those issues, which was also very helpful for us to be able to turn those off for all the relays. I think in total, the post mortem by PriSm mentions there were about 50 blocks, though the relay operators have a list that's 129 blocks that were missed due to an invalid signature from that user agent. So there might be a little bit discrepancy, but Prism might not have access to all the information for those requests that the relay operators have to back that up.
00:22:22.420 - 00:22:32.200, Speaker C: So overall it was pretty rough, but it was a quick fix and a quick resolution on there.
00:22:34.570 - 00:23:34.650, Speaker B: This kind of speaks to why we have diversity. Client diversity is very important if one client has a bug. So this was like 150 blocks, but the network just kept ticking along perfectly fine. Obviously that means just a missed slot and then a block will be created in the next slot or next couple of slots. So the system itself recovers very well to this sort of thing. But also the fact that we have diversity, and the fact that over the last maybe 18 months, two years or something like that, we've prioritized diversity means that when we do get pugs like this, it's hopefully just a blip. And there's not much to speak of in terms of the impact.
00:23:34.650 - 00:23:42.700, Speaker B: So that's kind of important. That's why the drum has been being drummed for such a long time.
00:23:44.510 - 00:24:16.950, Speaker D: I think, too, it sort of says a lot about the community because there's multiple clients, and when this sort of happened and the alarm bells ring, you have so many different teams working on different sort of platforms or layers or whatever you want to call them. It could be a validator, someone not necessarily on the client dev team, but sort of everyone just comes together, tries to figure it out and uses, whether it's telegram or slack or whatever, to sort of just problem solve really quickly. So that's pretty incredible.
00:24:20.810 - 00:24:36.320, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually a very connected kind of community in very. That's very good. I think we're all on the same team. So it's good to see.
00:24:39.890 - 00:25:26.910, Speaker A: The blockchain has been pretty busy lately. I know there's been a few comments in the rocket pool discord, probably more than a few about the gas situation, which certainly pros and cons there, right. Maybe we should have a bit of a chat about that and how it affects. Well, I suppose I'm more plugged into the rocket pool side of things. On the one hand, there's potentially a little bit higher reward for the validators, the mini pools for our node operators, and of course RS holders. But also with our recent Atlas upgrade, there's some interesting considerations there. Lange, do you want to share a little bit about Atlas and then also the impact of the recent, relatively high gas prices?
00:25:29.170 - 00:26:10.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd definitely be interested to hear what the other guys think of the kind of increased activity, particularly around MDV and that sort of thing. I'll kind of touch on Atlas a little bit here. So we released Atlas not long after Chappella. So Chappella happened, and then I think it was a few days afterwards we released atlas. Atlas provides support for withdrawals. So now our node operators can access their rewards in real time. So their consensus layer rewards, they can actually access the rewards that they've generated over the last however many months they've been staking.
00:26:10.102 - 00:26:55.238, Speaker B: And then kind of ongoing, as their rewards have skimmed, they can also withdraw completely if they want to and access their original bond. That's really great. It means that we've kind of closed the loop as Ethereum has closed the loop on proof of stake. Rocket pool has done the same, which is fantastic. It also brought, I guess, an innovation in the sense that you can now become a node operator with just eight ETH plus 2.4 ETh of RPL. And so we've kind of lowering that barrier to entry in terms of becoming a node operator.
00:26:55.238 - 00:27:33.190, Speaker B: So that's fantastic. And that's actually increased our capacity for liquid staking by. Well, technically it kind of does it by three x, but we hope over the next couple of while it'll be a lot more than that. And now we're back in the situation. So it's quite funny. Previously, re demand was outstripping our node operator supply post atlas, and this is by design, we now have an abundance of supply, and so we have loads of capacity for re. So that's amazing.
00:27:33.190 - 00:28:46.510, Speaker B: And that's exactly what Atlas was designed to do. And so over the next kind of like days, weeks, we're going to kind of see hopefully a lot of that kind of inflow from re demand. We've already seen quite a lot of that latent demand coming in, that re demand will come in, and we've got a few things lined up in terms of incentives and that sort of thing to kind of drive some of that as well. So it's fantastic to kind of be in that position again, where we now have a load of capacity to take on more liquid staking and kind of deposits coming back to kind of like their recent activity. We've certainly seen an uptick in, obviously the gas prices, the most obvious sign of increased activity, which then translates into decent returns for validators and node operators. There's been certainly a few kind of large mev blocks coming through we're kind of seeing as well. So I'll kind of pass it back to you guys in terms of how that's going for you guys in terms of the activity.
00:28:46.510 - 00:28:51.710, Speaker B: Alice, if you got anything to do with Alice as well, that people could certainly from the activity perspective.
00:28:54.690 - 00:29:43.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just looking into this now. To look at the recent movie uptick, looks like there are a couple of new meme coins that got released recently. And I saw an article that said that there's one account that's responsible for 7% of the total gas on Ethereum network in 24 hours. So it looks like there's been a lot of either arbitrage or front running going on, probably just due to more people getting into these new coins and just different liquidity balances. But high mev is good for us overall. That helps us produce big blocks and that helps produce more rewards for validators. So it's always nice to see that.
00:29:47.190 - 00:30:16.400, Speaker B: Yeah. What you kind of hope for is some sort of sustainable activity rather than meme coins. But I'm sure those coins have some sort of intrinsic value that's driving their value. But no, it'd be very good to kind of see a bit more of that sustainable activity. But these bursts are fun. They certainly bring in those big blocks, so it's kind of good to see that as well.
00:30:18.370 - 00:30:30.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm looking right now at the top blocks on beacon chain. It looks like there's been some 600 east blocks recently. Those are huge paydays for those proposals.
00:30:42.430 - 00:31:28.140, Speaker D: There's a lot more velocity with Chappella upgrade. Now, I haven't really seen any stats on where the movements are, whether it's rewards being returned and people what are they doing with it versus full exits. I think the elephant in the room, of course, would be Kraken having to be forced to exit via regulatory concerns. They're shutting that down. I've seen those stats in rated, for example. I think it was showing around 93% of the exit queue was cracking over the last day or two. But do you guys see any like, or even if it's possible, is anyone even tracking where those outflows are going?
00:31:31.150 - 00:31:56.642, Speaker B: I think it's going to take a little while for it to kind of happen. We're definitely seeing. There's definitely some inflows and we've kind of looked at some of the transactions and some of them do come from Kraken accounts. But it's difficult to tell whether it's from staking. It may well be, but it's also. You don't know. You can't kind of nail it down.
00:31:56.642 - 00:32:53.778, Speaker B: But we're definitely seeing some from Kraken coming through. Atlas has kind of fudged us a little bit because I think in the last 72 hours we've spun up, I think, 1700 new validators. So we've kind of staked about 56,000 Eth in the last 72 hours. And so it's kind of fudged us a little bit. We can't really separate atlas and the Chappella increase, but there's definitely a lot of pending. So obviously we're seeing a lot of exits, which, as you said, rated is a good place to kind of see those but we're also seeing the pending queue getting bigger and bigger. So that's a good sign in terms of onboarding new stake into Ethereum staking.
00:32:53.778 - 00:33:42.710, Speaker B: So we're definitely seeing the pending queue getting bigger, and we're obviously kind of contributing quite heavily to that. We've also kind of onboarded about 50 new node operators as well. So that's again a good sign in terms of the inflow for Ethereum staking. So yeah, I think everything's kind of going in the right direction. As you said, kraken is confusing the net amount, but we're certainly seeing a strong inflow, and we will probably see it once that stake is accessible, which I don't know whether it is or not, but once that stake is accessible, then we'll kind of see that being restaked elsewhere.
00:33:44.970 - 00:34:15.022, Speaker D: Yeah, we see a similar pattern. And that's the interesting thing about blockchain, you can't really track things accurately. You still have to use some intuition. You can't really see on chain what goes where and from where, at least accurately. But it's certain that in the short term the results are pretty skewed by Kraken. I don't think that's the norm. I think we'll probably hit a normal stride, actually.
00:34:15.022 - 00:35:07.810, Speaker D: I don't know when, but probably pretty soon as that queue changes. I think looking at the markets in more of a holistic view is that most people who are staking eth are going to continue to stake Eth. They're looking at it from a long term standpoint, not just from a reward perspective, but just in terms of wanting to be involved in Ethereum and seeing the successes it's probably going to bring. So just staying in it, in other words. So they're probably just going to move elsewhere. And rocket pool is a great example of lowering that barrier of entry. A lot of retail stakers who are using centralized exchanges, a fair amount of them were doing that because they simply a didn't have 32 e and B didn't have the technical ability to do it anyways.
00:35:07.810 - 00:35:30.040, Speaker D: So this is a huge opportunity to get people into the space with less amount of ETH and also making it easier for them to do so. Run their own nodes, whichever. If that's home staking, or using a cloud provider or someone who runs their own bare metal, or however that looks right. So really interesting.
00:35:32.350 - 00:36:05.966, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll let you go in a second. I think the market has also matured quite considerably in the time that probably a lot of people staked with decentralized providers. There's a lot more kind of option out there in terms of how you stake your ETh as well. So that helps with kind of the diversification. There's a lot more places where you can do it and a few different ways you can do it. So that's really great to see. Sorry, Benjamin.
00:36:05.966 - 00:36:06.580, Speaker B: Go.
00:36:07.030 - 00:36:33.340, Speaker C: Oh, you're fine. Yeah, I was going to bring up that the amount of validators joining the network right now shot up recently, most likely. I'm not a financial researcher, but I would say I would attribute it to the Chappelle upgrade recently, where you're not locked in for an unforeseeable future knowing that you could get your 32 e out. There's a process to do it now.
00:36:34.510 - 00:36:34.826, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:34.848 - 00:37:19.290, Speaker C: And I would imagine that if we were able to track all the ETH that was coming out through these withdrawals right now, we'd probably see some of the earlier stakers who had already exited probably go back into staking, either through traditional staking themselves or through a liquidity pool or liquid staking provider. I was actually going to bring up, though, a couple of people have reached out to me, asking me about staking on Coinbase right now. I don't want to throw any shade at Coinbase, but I did tell them that they should look into maybe some more of the liquid staking options. Would you like to kind of compare or explain what the differences are really quick, Darren?
00:37:21.150 - 00:38:18.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the main obvious difference is the validator set. So with Coinbase, Coinbase are running those validators and with a lot of other providers, and you have to kind of do your own research. But a lot of other providers, in particular rocket pool, we are a permissionless, decentralized validator set, which is much more healthy for Ethereum overall. It's much better to have it from a resiliency perspective, it's better to have a decentralized validator set, but also from a risk perspective, it's much better. And also just a general Ethereum health perspective, it's better. So that's kind of like the main difference, I think there's also like a commission difference as well. I think they take.
00:38:18.160 - 00:39:02.060, Speaker B: Now I'm going to get it wrong. I won't say it just in case I'm getting wrong, but I think they take quite a large commission for doing that, whereas other providers take a smaller commission. So definitely look into those aspects of it as well. The other aspect of it, they have CBE, but being a liquid staking token, you can use it in Defi. And so you can kind of choose your own adventure in terms of that. You can just hold the token by itself, or you can put it into a defi protocol and get some extra sort of rewards and yield depending on what your kind of risk appetite is.
00:39:06.850 - 00:39:13.360, Speaker D: I think I could say something in Coinbase's defense. Good idea.
00:39:13.810 - 00:39:14.560, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:16.610 - 00:40:06.350, Speaker D: I think they just have so many users, right? So they think about user adoption. And if you think about it from a technical perspective, if you have hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of users who want to stake and they're in your UI, it's extremely difficult to spin up a node for them. It's custodial to begin with. So that's a very heavy lift for them. So it's a lot easier for them to do liquid staking for multiple reasons. The benefit there, of course, is if they're liquid staking at the end of the day, they're still running nodes, they still need to run east nodes. And the liquid staking just makes it a lot easier for their users to be involved, whether that's clicking a button basically, to stake and unstake.
00:40:09.170 - 00:40:30.600, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. I think if you're already in a centralized exchange like Coinbase and you don't want to do anything complicated, I think that it's a great option for that because Coinbase is definitely geared towards a different market than other DeFi or even just other liquid staking options out there.
00:40:31.370 - 00:41:05.970, Speaker D: It'll be really interesting to see. Obviously they're going to war with this sec, so they're definitely differentiate themselves on how they do pool staking versus a know. I won't get into the weeds on that. I don't really want to speak for them, but they were certainly managed differently and Coinbase is probably going to fight the good fight. They want to make sure that protocol rewards staking. Rewards go directly from the protocol to the end user. And so that'll be an interesting battleground.
00:41:05.970 - 00:41:07.570, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:07.640 - 00:42:30.160, Speaker B: The custodial versus a lot of liquid staking protocols are designed for self custody. So that is definitely a thing that for people who kind of want to do self custody, which there are obviously a lot of great reasons for you to do that with custodials solutions, it's not your keys, even though Coinbase is a good player in this space, but if you want to kind of have full control over it, then self custody is the way to go. I definitely echo your point in terms of Coinbase fighting the good fight. I think they're actually fighting it on multiple levels, which is really nice to see. Obviously there's the legal stuff that's kind of going on, and that's fantastic that they're fighting, that they have kind of the resources to kind of do that, which is fantastic. But also, they're also working for hearts and minds, which I think is very clever and something that crypto in general need to do more of. And that is the whole kind of, like, media campaign around changing the system is very good.
00:42:30.160 - 00:43:35.620, Speaker B: And I think, to be honest, I think that hearts and minds piece is as important and maybe even slightly more important than the legal battle. The legal battle obviously puts us in a good position, but the hearts and minds really, I think crypto is losing the hearts and mind battle into a certain degree. And so that's definitely needed to make sure that people see the value proposition that everyone working in this space really sees. We're here because we think it's a better system, it's a better model, it's much more efficient, it's safer from a lot of centralization risks and that sort of thing. So they're a big proponent of Defi protocols, which is great, but they're also pushing this, changing people's hearts and minds about what crypto is and the value proposition behind it. So, yeah, I really kind of applaud them for all the work that they're doing.
00:43:40.340 - 00:44:00.032, Speaker D: Yeah, that's really insightful, Darren. That's, like, a really strong point. I think that probably needs to be said more. Yeah, that's incredible. You have sort of these leaders in the space that are able to win hearts and minds over, because that's really the battlefield at the end of the day. I don't know. I'm sort of bringing this on a tangent.
00:44:00.032 - 00:44:15.930, Speaker D: I don't know if you guys care, but if anyone saw Gary Gensler in front of the house committee, I think that was a few days ago. Maybe it was end of last week. It sort of warmed my heart to see him getting grilled. I don't know if you guys saw it.
00:44:17.740 - 00:45:34.112, Speaker B: It was quite delicious. I think, on the serious point, it is also heartening that there are a lot of politicians on outside, I guess, on the crypto side, and that's because what it seems to be is the politicians that understand the kind of innovation are pro, and they really drive it forward. Politicians on the other side, there's definitely a lot of fear, and I think that's, again, where that hearts and minds thing comes in. There's a lot of fear on the other side, and crypto doesn't help itself. We've already spoken about the kind of like meme coin stuff that's going on, it doesn't help itself necessarily. And so we need to somehow elevate the great projects and diminish the not so great projects so that we can have this front. Not the front, but actually project the benefits that we're hoping to deliver.
00:45:34.112 - 00:45:41.690, Speaker B: Rather than just focusing on the speculation aspects of kind of crypto, which is, I guess, important.
00:45:48.090 - 00:46:30.978, Speaker D: I feel like in a way, there's sort of momentum building that this, I mean, we all know, right, most of us who've worked in the industry are a part of it, know it's not going anywhere. Like, we're invested in this. We get it. There's no stopping technology, right. And especially the crypto related technology, because there's just so many amazing things going on at so many levels. But the general public might not be aware of that and they get rugged on some strange shitcoin, or they just want to dive in and dive out of the market, or they're completely oblivious to how it works. And so they don't really understand that this is not going anywhere.
00:46:30.978 - 00:47:24.854, Speaker D: This is not a flash in the pan or a so, like, I think from a more regulatory government perspective, you're seeing that resonate, like, oh, you know, the White House came out with a paper, I don't know, a month ago saying, yeah, they realize crypto is here to stay. And so then it comes a question of, well, how do we cultivate that? How do we encourage it instead of just beating it on the head as they've been doing? And I think a lot of people are sort of apprehensive now because there's so much uncertainty. Uncertainty is never good for anything. And the cloud of uncertainty around what's happened over the last year on both sides of the fence. Right. Crypto is to blame as well. Some actors in the space who've been really doing a poor job, and then you have the regulatory actors who are doing practically nothing.
00:47:24.854 - 00:47:35.770, Speaker D: So this uncertainty is sort of, I don't know, maybe reaching a culmination, and it's sort of like, hey, this is real. Let's start taking it a little more seriously.
00:47:39.070 - 00:47:39.820, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:42.670 - 00:48:36.270, Speaker C: I was going to say, I think that that's where tools and services that are like coinbase out there, that provide a easier on ramp, easier experience, and being custodial for those users that might not hide their keys or their passphrases as well, provides a great service to get people into the network, which is, I think that's how we're going to grow overall, because not everyone's going to be a djen who investigates and reads every article that's going on with ethereum or bitcoin or any of the new meme coins. They're just going to see that there's volatility in the market and be upset that one transaction that they used one day would cost thirty cents and the next day was $3. So I think it's a good fight that they're fighting.
00:48:39.010 - 00:49:41.860, Speaker B: I've been in, obviously, crypto since 2017, and back then it was all talk about, talk about intrinsic value and crypto kind of going to zero, it won't last and all of this sort of thing. It's probably more like mid 2018, actually. But the times are very different now. They're worlds apart, both from attitude and technology. So the attitude now is not that crypto won't exist, particularly the main kind of blue chip, I guess, crypto, but it's now a lot more about how far it will go. That's the attitude. And so we're seeing a lot bigger players in the space.
00:49:41.860 - 00:50:36.530, Speaker B: The attitude is completely different and the demographics are very different from back then. But the technology has moved on so much. We've now got loads of l two s that are providing cheap transactions, proof of stake, and staking advances. A lot of the ZK exciting stuff coming through. So we're so much further along, but we've got so much more to go, and we certainly have a long kind of trek ahead of us. I think the fact that regulators are speaking about things now is really heartening. Although it creates a lot of uncertainty, it's actually very heartening because it does mean that it's being treated seriously.
00:50:36.530 - 00:51:00.220, Speaker B: Once we kind of get over this kind of uncertainty bubble, we're only going to see things improve. So I think it's definitely heartening. I think for the future, it's going to be awesome for this space. And I'm really looking forward to kind of seeing what the next kind of months and years, how they kind of play out.
00:51:02.350 - 00:51:14.800, Speaker D: What are you guys looking forward to? Maybe specific to ethereum and rocket pool, obviously, but in sort of the medium term, like six months, year out, what sort of excites you?
00:51:18.610 - 00:52:03.200, Speaker C: Yeah, I think more related to my day to day is the enshrined PBS kind of the discovery process of how that's going to work. There's been a lot of talks this week around some relay behavior with block cancellation and actually how that would work in a enshrined PBS workflow. So there's going to be a lot of research, a lot of discovery over the coming months to get that to take place, which I'm hoping will be a smooth transition as well as good as the Chappella went. So hopefully that makes a lot of progress in the coming months.
00:52:06.050 - 00:52:59.586, Speaker B: For me. There's a couple of things I'm interested a there's a few eips and that are kind of looking to get into Cancun. One is accessing the beacon state route and another is potentially kind of one initiated exits. So those two things I'm really looking at in terms of they'll be very interesting if we can kind of land those in the Ethereum roadmap. The other thing I'm quite interested in is a lot of the ZK technology in terms of kind of moving to more trustless kind of oracles and that sort of thing. That's going to be very interesting over the next little while. So those are probably the two things I'm mainly looking at, obviously.
00:52:59.586 - 00:53:07.940, Speaker B: And also new players in the liquid staking market is going to be interesting as well. And so, yeah, all of those things really.
00:53:10.310 - 00:53:54.370, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say liquid staking is on the launch pad right now and going to be really interesting to see the space. We see it on our end of the woods as validators. There's a lot of people getting to mainnet in Testnet, having new ideas, I guess sort of answer my own question. DVT is sort of interesting. Working with various DVT sort of infrastructure or even protocols, trying to figure out how that's going to fit in the space is something I spend my time on a little bit, I think too, coming out of ETh Denver. And this is more of a high level thing. I don't know when it's going to land would be account abstraction.
00:53:54.370 - 00:54:28.560, Speaker D: I think the ideas surrounding that is really going to push a lot of innovation into the space. And there's sort of this final realization, or maybe it's just a realization that there's not enough people in the space. And why is that? And it's simply due to a lot of complexity, technical complexity and overhead, and the general public just doesn't want to deal with that. So account abstraction is going to sort of open the doors to being able to onboard a lot more people.
00:54:30.370 - 00:55:21.070, Speaker B: The other thing that account abstraction potentially does is with liquid staking tokens. It could actually increase the amount of staked eth kind of by proxy. And the reason why is that. So account abstraction could potentially lead to you being able to pay for gas in another token because at the moment, one of the main reasons why you have ETH is to be able to pay gas. But with the account abstraction, you might not necessarily need to do that. Somebody is still paying the gas, but as a user, you can pay for the gas in another token. So that opens up a lot of room for everyday users not actually necessarily needing as much eth.
00:55:21.070 - 00:55:30.400, Speaker B: They could have staked ETH, for example, or other kind of stable coins and that sort of thing. So that's an interesting kind of development as well.
00:55:30.790 - 00:56:20.350, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that will be huge where you'll have different providers. Well, the end user might not even be paying gas at all. Or that's sort of behind the scenes. They don't interact with it. Gaming is probably the best example that you build a game that's built on the block and however the functionality of that game works, we're trading items, or however their monetization or game works, that gamer doesn't even have to deal with gas doesn't have to do, because the game has figured out another way to monetize and they're subsidizing it or just paying it outright. And so making things a lot easier for people to engage with as well. Because right now we engage with a lot of protocols.
00:56:20.350 - 00:56:40.120, Speaker D: We're on a protocol right now on Twitter and it's behind the scenes. We're not really involved with it whatsoever. I'm not saying we should do that. We want people to be involved with the protocols at all levels and have some ownership. But I think some abstraction would help.
00:56:44.110 - 00:57:16.574, Speaker A: On the topic of big blocks, as we've been talking, the rocket pool smoothing pool just got quite a large amount. Let me check. 11.745 eth. Not bad. So that's one of the benefits of node operators coming over to rocket pool is being able to participate in the sharing of these lottery blocks if they opt into the smoothing pool. So you don't have to hold out hope that you're lucky.
00:57:16.574 - 00:57:24.040, Speaker A: It's converted into a more consistent and predictable stream of rewards. So that was interesting to see just about ten minutes ago.
00:57:27.090 - 00:57:45.570, Speaker D: That's awesome. We actually deal with that at the customer service level where people are like, hey, why am I not lucky? What's going on here? And so we often tell them about rocket pool smoothing pool as a solution.
00:57:49.080 - 00:58:03.950, Speaker C: Yeah, that's actually one of the selling points I told my friend about rocket pool was that the smoothing pool will help them earn more rewards overall and they'll get more of the lottery blocks that way. But yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:58:10.380 - 00:58:24.110, Speaker A: All right, well, we've gone past the hour. It was a great chat. I don't see any more questions coming in. So if there are any topics that we've missed, anything else anyone wants to bring up, maybe we can start wrapping up this Twitter space.
00:58:28.570 - 00:58:41.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to bring up some of the relay vulnerabilities that happened just before the week before the Shanghai upgrade, if that's okay, if you guys, we can talk about it some other time.
00:58:41.490 - 00:58:46.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd like to know about that. Yeah, go for it. Yeah.
00:58:46.292 - 00:59:27.270, Speaker C: So it was a very interesting attack against relay providers by malicious proposers in the network. What was happening was, I guess, a little bit of backstory for people who are unaware. Mev occurs in a couple different ways. One of the most common ways is a bundle, which is a set of transactions that need to exist together. They need to be executed in order, and if they aren't, they can cause a lot of issues for people. And if you can get access to a bundle, a malicious actor could make a lot of money from that. And it's called bundle unwinding.
00:59:27.270 - 01:00:39.950, Speaker C: When you have access to someone else's bundle and you take apart the transactions and you put them in a different order, that benefits you. So what was happening with these node operators, or not node operators, but these proposers is they were signing multiple bids from relays and getting access to those bundles and causing a missed slot because of that, because multiple blocks were broadcasted. So they were taking the slashing penalty, but they had access to tons of bundles that they were able to unwind and then maliciously steal funds from searchers. This accounted for over $14 million worth of loss over the course of a few days. And it was pretty quickly brought to the attention of all the different relay, the relays to get that resolved immediately. Some of the fallout from those resolutions resulted in more orphan blocks. So some of the protections that were added to the relays to do that was to delay returning blocks or returning those signed bids back to the validators.
01:00:39.950 - 01:01:41.160, Speaker C: So we would wait a number of seconds before return that to them so they could broadcast it, while we would broadcast it internally, so they could propagate through the network a little bit more to prevent those losses. So this accounted for a lot of missed and orphan blocks. And from those orphan blocks, we saw invalid parents where some part of the network believed that the block had landed on chain, some part of the network had marked it as a missed slot. So we'd see multiple, a lot of fallout from sequential blocks from this issue. So there were a lot of changes being made to relays on the fly to get that addressed. And I think internally the consensus among the relays was there was not enough communication with node operators about the current issues and the solutions were definitely rushed. So there was a lot of missed slots caused by those changes.
01:01:41.160 - 01:02:54.270, Speaker C: And then some subsequent changes that were made to beacon nodes resulted in valid signatures, invalid blocks being marked as invalid before they could be published, causing more missed slots that didn't mean to be missed, and marking validators as invalid validators are not invalid validators, but malicious actors in the space as well. So there were a lot of culmination of factors causing missed slots that I think it took almost two days for all relay operators to fully resolve these issues. And also we were able to get some good support from Lighthouse and prism to provide some block validation before propagating blocks. That way all the validators signatures and all the validators behavior was ensured to be honest and correct before any blocks were returned back to the validator, which was another good collaboration across relay operators and beacon nodes and consensus clients.
01:02:56.690 - 01:03:32.700, Speaker B: So with the kind of like delaying of the, is that kind of like a short term fix? Obviously, from our perspective, we've got node operators all over the world. And so some of the, I guess not latency, but definitely getting their blocks out is slower than people necessarily all bunch together in the US. So is that a kind of like a short term thing or is there medium fixes that are going in now? And what is the kind of like the long term fix?
01:03:33.710 - 01:04:52.930, Speaker C: Great question. So the delay was to ensure that the signature and the propagation could happen prior to being returned to the validator, to also begin its broadcasting of that block. So for anyone that was behaving correctly, it shouldn't have impacted them in a negative way, as long as the signature was valid, as long as everything was appropriate with the requests they were making, the requests that they were making to the relay, the blocks would be propagated to a network of beacon nodes that each of the relays are connected to. The initial fallout of that delay was that relays were broadcasting blocks sequentially to beacon nodes, which isn't necessarily a fast process. And so they were waiting for all the beacon nodes to return a successful response before returning that block back to the validator, which caused issues with propagation. So one of the changes that was made through that was to return after the first successful beacon node broadcast.
01:04:55.030 - 01:05:16.620, Speaker B: Right, got you. So there's some efficiency improvements there that kind of speed that up. Okay, is that basically kind of done there's no problem there or is resolved now.
01:05:16.990 - 01:06:00.170, Speaker C: Yeah, we've seen that the number of orphan blocks definitely dropped after a few days into those changes and those changes being carried out by all the different relays. I think there's still some propagation issues where we see beacon nodes or validators requesting blocks for parent hashes that are not the current parent. So we do see some more reorgs still, but I think there's still some improvements that can be made with that. We're also, I think, internally investigating how we can use our BDN to distribute and publish those blocks even faster across more beacon nodes to get consensus earlier on in a slot.
01:06:01.390 - 01:06:02.620, Speaker B: Cool. Awesome.
01:06:04.190 - 01:06:18.430, Speaker D: Is there a post mortem on this, especially in terms of. It seems like it was basically, I don't know, it was someone in the space who was doing this at the validator level, right? I don't know. You mentioned did they get slashed?
01:06:20.690 - 01:06:57.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they got slashed relays started also doing a block list where they would not allow certain operators or just by the index of the validator, not allow them to register or make any requests so that they can protect themselves from the situation in the future. And then those validators can obviously still produce a block locally, but I do believe they've been exited already. I'll have to double check because I remember seeing a message about that, but those are some late nights with a lot of communication back and forth. And in terms of a post mortem.
01:06:58.030 - 01:07:19.940, Speaker D: I'm just curious because, as you mentioned, I'm aware of this. I don't know the details, but they basically siphoned off 14 million or so. I'm just curious what the slashing penalty was, because it was obviously worth it to do it. And I'm wondering how the slashing mechanism worked in that case, because clearly it didn't deter them.
01:07:21.270 - 01:07:32.680, Speaker C: Right? Yeah, I'll find the post mortem, but I agree, the slashing penalties did not cover the losses that were made.
01:07:41.340 - 01:07:56.670, Speaker D: In the future. You guys created sort of a block list, I'm assuming, in the short or in any term. Is that what you think will be done at the relayer level as well, to sort of, if this happens again?
01:07:57.920 - 01:08:22.550, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sure that there's going to be more interrelay communication in the future when they notice that there's a bad actor in the space. Obviously, it's kind of hard to determine who is a bad actor quickly in these scenarios, but I think moving forward, that block list will be used more and more as more vulnerabilities are found through the current PBS system.
01:08:37.320 - 01:08:58.028, Speaker B: Cool. Awesome. I think we can start wrapping up if you're there. But I'd like to say thank you very much, guys, for coming on board. It's been a fantastic chat. I think we've got, like, 15 minutes over. I think it's just because we getting into the chat, but it's fantastic to have you guys here.
01:08:58.028 - 01:09:03.516, Speaker B: I really enjoyed the chat. Yeah.
01:09:03.538 - 01:09:06.030, Speaker C: I appreciate getting the chance to talk with you guys again.
01:09:09.200 - 01:09:21.910, Speaker A: We know how quickly this space moves. So we can probably do this again in a few more weeks and we'll have some more exciting news. Talk about. Thanks for everyone, for listening in from the audience, and we'll catch you on the next one.
01:09:25.660 - 01:09:27.370, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.
01:09:31.460 - 01:09:32.450, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:09:34.740 - 01:09:38.140, Speaker D: Thanks, everyone. Really appreciate it. Bye.
