00:00:00.410 - 00:00:23.022, Speaker A: Okay, well, we're three minutes past, so we might as well start. There's a little bit of housekeeping. Get out the way first. I'll try run through that pretty quickly and then hand it over to Ken and the blockstroke guys. So, yeah, welcome along, everyone. This is a special edition to our weekly rocket pool community call. So obviously, since you're all listening, you made it to the right place.
00:00:23.022 - 00:00:52.490, Speaker A: You know that we're running this from the rocketpool out rather than Ken or Jasper's Twitter account. So that's one change. And then, of course, we are again at the earlier euro friendly time, back to back. So great to have Ken with us. He's kindly agreed to host two spaces. And not to worry, Jasper will be on back on very soon. If you can't tell from my accent, your friendly talking rocket today is Mav.
00:00:52.490 - 00:01:43.398, Speaker A: So for those of you who don't know, I'm Rocket pool's community and marketing manager. And we're joined by two special guests from Blocksroot Labs. We've got Ben up here from business development and then Dan, who is the lead senior developer. So we'll be chatting with them about Mevboost and block. I would expect that to take up quite a bit of time. And usually on this call, we would also go through the biweekly update, which, if you've had a read, is also likely to take up quite a bit of time. So we'll use the time remaining to go through maybe some of the highlights, some of the topics that without my australian colleagues, we can cover off, and then anything remaining from the biweekly.
00:01:43.398 - 00:02:26.890, Speaker A: We'll leave that to the chitchat in a couple of days time, which is in the rocket pool discord. And we'll kind of carve out a little bit of that and run it similar to the community call. We'll have Jasper hosting, we'll have Langas answering the questions, and we'll record that segment and get that up on YouTube so nobody misses out. Obviously, we've got some pretty smart people up here. And to be honest, I've kind of done my bit, which was to get all this up and running. So without further ado, I will pass over to the blocks root guys to give a brief introduction about themselves. And then Ken will take us through the next hour or so.
00:02:26.890 - 00:02:36.800, Speaker A: And, yeah, lots of exciting topics to cover off. So glad you could join. And, yeah, Ben and Dan, over to you guys.
00:02:39.250 - 00:03:03.160, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you for having us. Really appreciate it. Rocket pool. So, one correction. I'm not the leader developers. I'm actually the senior product manager, but I will try my best to answer any technical related question as well, if we have enough time.
00:03:03.160 - 00:03:31.070, Speaker B: So, at blocks route, I'm handling from product design to implementation, development, and some of the operation here. I'm glad to be here to tell you a little bit more about what blocks are outdoo in the MeV community, and talking about the MeV relay services we provide. And Ben.
00:03:33.030 - 00:03:35.220, Speaker C: Yeah, pleasure to be here with you guys.
00:03:36.950 - 00:03:48.840, Speaker B: I work on the business and development end of things, and I'll be here to answer any additional questions that Daniel passes off to me.
00:03:51.130 - 00:04:25.620, Speaker C: Well, excellent. Ben and Daniel, it's very nice to meet you. My name is Ken, and I'm a first and foremost a rocket pool node operator, as well as a community member that gets to kind of host these calls. And one of the things that I thought would be very helpful on today's call is many of our node operators are just now really exploring or engaging in meV, and understanding what it means to be the block proposer. But can you just take a step back and explain us, like we're five, what MEV is, and in particular what block's roots role is in the process?
00:04:27.750 - 00:05:22.270, Speaker B: Sure, absolutely. So, mav, initially, everybody calls it miners extractable value, due to the fact that during the pow period, this function can be only done by those miners. Nowadays it's called maximum extract value. Demonstrate how much east profit can be. Not necessarily east profit, but like the cryptocurrency, profit can be generated through the block proposing process. So if you are interested in. I know there's a lot of mystery about this stuff, and it's pretty niche market, I would say there is a lot of a good resource out there, especially from one of our best partner, flashbots.
00:05:22.270 - 00:06:17.714, Speaker B: There is a lot of articles, scholar contents over there. So you can find. Just go to Flashbots website, you can find those contents. Not today. We are mainly talking about the new supply chain of the MEV post emerge. So I think one particular thing, what we want to talk about is the MEV relay, why we are doing this, and what is the purpose of having the MEV relay in this supply chain. So, if you think about the MEV first start with a user submitted a transaction, right? So there is a lot of opportunities to extract MEV.
00:06:17.714 - 00:08:02.040, Speaker B: It could be something like bad front running, but also could be some arbitrage opportunity back running, which is actually pretty good to the community. So there is a bunch of people called searcher or builders in this field, and they have their specialty in their algorithm to find those extractable opportunities. Then they will need to submit this to whoever the next block proposer in order to extract those values. However, in today's POS ecosystem, the proposals are highly distributed or decentralized, even though there is a lot of criticism that there are some big players in this field, but they are distributed. So how to build the trust between the builders and the proposer is something blockthrough and Flashbox are trying to do it to creating a relay which is trusted by the both parties. Otherwise, there's a lot of other potential issue, like MeV stealing or those kind of situation could be happens between if the builders and the validator proposer communicated directly. So that's why initially flashbots and blocks introduced this MEV relay in order to help the community to generate MEV and to distribute the revenue, the profit in a fair lay matter.
00:08:02.040 - 00:08:12.166, Speaker B: I don't know if that helped you to get a general idea about the supply chain. Yeah, go ahead, Kev.
00:08:12.278 - 00:08:23.680, Speaker C: Yeah, no, very good. And so, with blocks route, what role do you play? Are you just the relay? Are you also a builder? Are you a searcher? Are you all three?
00:08:25.250 - 00:08:50.950, Speaker B: Yes. That's a good question. I will say we are doing pretty much everything. So we do have our builder, we have our MeV relay. So that the quick answer to that is yes, we are doing both rows.
00:08:51.770 - 00:09:16.480, Speaker C: Okay. And can you help maybe explain something you may not know, but in our rocket pool software, we can actually just check a box, right. To join any one of three blocks route relays. And they're named the ethical relay, the maximum profit relay, and the regulated relay. Can you explain the differences on each of those names and what do they mean?
00:09:16.850 - 00:09:59.206, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's a fabulous question, because we have been asked a lot about what are the difference between three different relays. So there are three relays we provide. The first one is called Max profit. By the way, you can also find our three relays payers account by doing blocksroute Maxprofit ETH. We have set up the ENS so it's easier to see. And the other two are the similar, like blocksroute east.
00:09:59.206 - 00:11:00.094, Speaker B: And the third one, blocksroute regulated ETH. So the difference for Max profit, the reason of Max profit is basically we don't do any filtering. What that says is it includes every transaction. Either it's front running or it's ofacle their address. We don't care. This is in order to demonstrate that it is because some people in the community, especially in the blockchain community, are for the fully decentralization and the non governments. So we do want to provide these options for whoever willing to do that.
00:11:00.094 - 00:11:48.014, Speaker B: And the second one is called ethical. This relay provides block that have no front running bundles. And we try our best to filtering out name bundles that execute strategy like front running and the sandwich attack. So this one is censored front running, but it's not censored OFAC. The third one is regulated. Regulated is because nowadays there is a lot of companies operated under the regulation from their local government. So we provided a relay that filtering out all the OFAC censored address.
00:11:48.014 - 00:12:04.980, Speaker B: So there is no transaction will be allowed. You won't see any transaction from that relay, but that will not censoring the front running or other behaviors. So those are the.
00:12:07.610 - 00:12:43.634, Speaker C: Oh, excellent. Thank you very much for that kind of explanation there. One thing you may not know is that rocket pool is right now kind of engaging in some community discussion among our membership about whether or not we should be requiring Mevboost to be turned on on our nodes. Right. As a pooled or liquid staking protocol. We are staking on behalf of individuals that purchase the re token and we want to remain competitive and earn as much returns on their investment as possible. Right.
00:12:43.634 - 00:13:11.210, Speaker C: And so we're kind of debating the pros and cons of requiring mev extraction to be turned on on our node operators nodes. Can you maybe share your perspective about a couple of questions here that might help us evaluate what we want to do? And the first question is, do these relays, do they pose a centralizing risk by using a relay? Are we starting to decentralize Ethereum or centralize Ethereum?
00:13:12.670 - 00:14:15.020, Speaker B: Okay, that's a good question. All right, so Vitalik proposed what we call the builder and proposer separation. One of the reason why we talk about that is because the argument of centralization, we all know that we encourage or we want the ethereum to be a decentralized. Right. However, the fact is, during meV, it's a very specialized job. So there is a potential that MEV relay will become relatively centralized. And the fact is, most of the mev block being proposed these days are coming from flashbar and blocks route, which accumulate totally, roughly about like, I would say 90 plus plus percent.
00:14:15.020 - 00:15:56.906, Speaker B: So if that means it's a centralization, it's actually no, because we encourage the exist of really is simply to build the trust between two decentralized party, which are the builders and the proposer. So basically we just trying to bridge the gap between these two parties where they are fully decentralized. We encourage this builder to be more decentralized, and the proposers on the other side are also very decentralized. So if we look, this supply chain in general is still decentralized, we won't be able to control what our builders are building and what the proposers are going to choose from. So I won't say it will be centralized. And both flashbots and the blocks route are encouraging any other parties or new entities to enter in this field to provide other MEV relays as well. Because when we talk to customers, we always told them, connect to as many relays as possible, if you can, in order to get the best result and the best yield for yourself and also for the decentralization.
00:15:56.906 - 00:16:04.530, Speaker B: So in summary, I won't say it's a centralization concern.
00:16:06.470 - 00:16:28.802, Speaker C: Okay, so the argument is that the relays are basically neutral, right. As long as there's a set of relays to choose from, you have options. And the builders are independent and decentralized, and the proposers are independent and decentralized. And so all things taken together, it's still a very decentralized method, it doesn't pose a centralizing risk.
00:16:28.946 - 00:16:29.640, Speaker B: Correct.
00:16:30.650 - 00:17:00.100, Speaker C: Okay, what about the reliabilityness of these relays? Right? I mean, if we're thinking about making it mandatory that we enroll in them. I've noticed many of us have struggled a little bit, especially the Bezu users among us have noticed a little bit about reliability post merge, and then the relays are adding another complexity of sometimes they respond, sometimes they don't. What are your thoughts about reliability and the relays and what are kind of your goals with that?
00:17:01.110 - 00:18:19.846, Speaker B: That's also a very good question, because first thing first, we only post the merge for like two weeks. There is a lot of things are undergoing a lot of bugs are fixing under the hood at blocks route. We do notice like there is one small accident, like I think one week after the merge, and leader to a couple of hours of downtime. So what is our approach is we take the responsibility, we respond timely to fixing that bug, which was, we probably won't be able to dig into too much details, but it was a bug that only identified it on the main net instead of the testnet. So we fixed the bugs within a few hours after the accident. And we noticed there is our trusted user who misproposed their blocks, I think it's roughly about like 80 to 100 blocks. And we actually compensated them from our pocket because they are our trusted users.
00:18:19.846 - 00:19:39.590, Speaker B: And by using our services they missed the two proposed couple of blocks. And so we decided to compensate out of our pocket. So that's the responsiveness I want to demonstrate here from our end, but talking about reliability. So one thing we always encourage our users to do is again, connect you to many relays if possible, because it's inevitable our server might down, flash bots might down from time to time. So if you have other relays to choose from, you always have a backup plan. And, and I'm pretty sure everybody, especially blocks route and are trying our best to provide the strong infrastructure, as strong as that we can, to eliminate any potential downtime. And we are learning from the past people saying the entire blockchain industry is new and the post merge stuff is even newer.
00:19:39.590 - 00:20:36.150, Speaker B: Like a lot of things, even though we went through the roster net merge, like other shadow folks, we tested it again and again, but there is always something unexpected could happen. So you should expect some downtime. But one, if you connect to multiple relay, there is very minimum impact to a validator. Second, use trusted relay provider like flashbar blockshrout. We take the responsibility if there is accident caused by our company. So I hope this help you help answer the question.
00:20:36.220 - 00:21:09.250, Speaker C: Yeah, very much so. And I was very, I suppose, pleased, but also surprised to see that you were reimbursing folks for the relay down. And I know it kind of created a little bit of, kind of discussion on crypto Twitter about if that was even the responsibility of the relay to reimburse the amount. So I very much commend you for your position on there and think it will start kind of a precedence in that area, which kind of begs the question, how do the relays make money? Do you make any cut or commission on the MEV through the relay?
00:21:10.950 - 00:21:56.474, Speaker B: So one thing I want to add a little bit to your last question is why we're making compensation, right. How much those proposals are losing. So being a proposer, you have the responsibility to propose a block, and using a relay, you only receive the header of the block. And if you committed to that header and you will receive the rest of the transaction or the detail of the block. And in order for you to propose. But in the last accident, when the proposer committed to the header, but they didn't receive the block. So in that case, what that means is they committed to block.
00:21:56.474 - 00:22:47.122, Speaker B: Throughout block, however, we failed to deliver. That's why we said we should take the responsibility to compensate them. Like you said, why do we do that? Right. I think just because we want to demonstrate our, we don't want to jeopardize our reputation in this industry. We have been in the Ethereum or EVM blockchain infrastructure industry for many years, since 2017. We have lots of trusted users, so we definitely want a good reputation for that. All right, move along to the next question.
00:22:47.122 - 00:24:13.806, Speaker B: How to make money, right. At Flashbot, definitely our traditional business is the BDN services. So we provide the best performance infrastructure pretty much on the market for traders, for miners, or nowadays, validators to use, which end up for you with faster access to the blockchain data and faster propagation. So it is very important for lots of our trader users, defi algo trader users, and we do charge subscription fee based on the tiers they subscribe. That's one Venice revenues we have. And as to the relays, there is a fee could be collected, but we are not trying to do that, or attended to do that at this moment, because we want more validators to participate in our network. Yes.
00:24:13.806 - 00:24:17.102, Speaker B: So I don't know if this helped you.
00:24:17.236 - 00:24:52.538, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think those answered the questions really well. And I think your distinction that the reason you reimbursed in this case is that the proposers already signed the headers and they've committed to your block, and it was a failure to deliver the block. That is ultimately what caused them to submit empty blocks. Right. Because they can't submit anything else without fear of slashing. But if your relay just goes down and somebody hasn't signed the header, then the fact that you're down is really not a reimbursable event. They should be getting blocks from other relays or building.
00:24:52.624 - 00:24:54.954, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, that's right.
00:24:55.072 - 00:25:16.420, Speaker C: Yeah. Makes perfect sense. And thank you for kind of explaining some of the economics behind the relays. It was always kind of a mystery of me, but it's kind of the ancillary services and the reputation that are of most value. And so it sounds like, at least initially here, your relays are a service provided to add value, and you're not really extracting the value out of it.
00:25:17.910 - 00:25:21.060, Speaker B: Yeah, we definitely value our reputation, for sure.
00:25:21.990 - 00:25:59.040, Speaker C: Excellent. So I mentioned before that the rocket pool community now has kind of a governance discussion going on about when and where to enable MaV. Right. We have something called the smoothing pool, which many of our node operators, the majority of our node operators, and many of our mini pools subscribe to. That kind of distribute the Mev right down. We've turned it on since the relay started activating about two weeks ago, and we've already earned about 81 eth collectively in the smoothing pool, and are looking forward to that first distribution here in a couple of days. Yeah, really nice.
00:25:59.040 - 00:26:42.320, Speaker C: We're having discussions about how do we provide the maximum value to our ETh holders. These are our liquid staking token holders that aren't running nodes, but are participating in the liquid staking. And there's a strong argument that in order to remain competitive with other services, both centralized and decentralized services, we have to provide a very good or competitive return on the APR. And of course that means activating meV, because it plays such a significant amount of the post merge returns on a validator. What do you think of that? Do you see any challenges in us mandating that our nodes turn on one or more of these Mev relays? What do you see as the pros and cons to that?
00:26:42.850 - 00:27:23.900, Speaker B: That's a good question. A lot of people always think about the MEV as a bad thing. But I have to say it's not necessarily the case. Just think about those backgrounding transactions. It actually helped the entire defi market to be more efficient. It doesn't mean Mev always a bad thing. That's why we have this ethical mev relay which we filtering out all those bad Mev, which are pretty famous like front running, sandwich attack.
00:27:23.900 - 00:28:19.830, Speaker B: These things are we trying to avoid. And this relay can be used by entities Dow or whatever communities like yours. Because one, to be competitive, you definitely want to hire yield to enable MeV. Definitely help your yield. Second being using the ethical relay, demonstrate that all the revenue you generated are actually good for the community. And you will be easily to find out. Just go to blocksroute ease, you can tell what are the receivers like getting those ethical meV.
00:28:19.830 - 00:29:10.358, Speaker B: So that's also a good way to demonstrate you are being trying to be the good guys in the east community. I think that will help you guys to make the decision, like to turn on the MEV. So again, I just want to emphasize that not every MEV are necessarily bad. Sometimes it just help the entire ecosystem to be more efficient. Just think about in the Wall street, why there are the market makers. Are they always bad people always thinking like Wall street or the Wolf of the Wall street? They are bad guys. But it's because the existency of all those traditional financial institution over there.
00:29:10.358 - 00:29:20.190, Speaker B: They make nowadays this huge financial system to running efficiently.
00:29:24.050 - 00:29:53.814, Speaker C: Yeah, well, thank you very much for kind of that reasoning and justification. I mean it's one of those things where I think we're trying to debate and understand. And so any perspective you share I think is very helpful to our community. There was actually one request that came in our community channel, it's called trading. The trading channel in Rocketpool that came in. We have one of our Rocket scientists that just runs an excellent kind of analytical website on everything rocketpool. The website is called rocket Scan.
00:29:53.814 - 00:30:19.730, Speaker C: And I guess he was saying that he uses it to kind of track whenever we get proposals as to what relay it went through and some stats about the tips, the MeV, the top bidder, what relay it went through. But I guess that IP is banned from blocks route. Maybe you thought it was a bot or somebody probing the network, but we wondered if you might be able to get that IP unblocked.
00:30:20.470 - 00:30:25.718, Speaker B: Really? I didn't know that. I'm just looking at the rocket scan IO, right?
00:30:25.804 - 00:30:26.150, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:26.220 - 00:30:34.550, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah, definitely mark that down. Let's talk to the team and make sure it's not banded by block threat.
00:30:34.970 - 00:31:42.634, Speaker C: Okay. And I've got one last prepared question, and I'd like to kind of open it up to any members that are on the call here in trading to either post a question or ask it. But a couple of last questions from my list here is one of the reasons that I think we're needing relays is we don't have a way to ascertain whether or not somebody is stealing their own MEV and not sending it to the smart contract fee recipient addresses we have that share it equally with our liquid staking partners. But by using a relay. Right. And the analytics that they provide, we can actually see that indeed their bid payment, what I call the proposer payment value PPV, was indeed sent to one of our smart contracts that distributed fairly among the rocket pool folks that earn a share of that. But we've always kind of debated about the ethicalness of MeV, and I do like your thought about if we run the ethical relay, all we're doing is rebalancing the markets, right.
00:31:42.634 - 00:31:52.320, Speaker C: We're actually providing a service. But is there any interest in blocks route in running a no MEV relay? Kind of a fair ordering relay, if there could even be such a thing.
00:31:53.570 - 00:31:55.870, Speaker B: Fair ordering relay?
00:31:58.470 - 00:32:18.140, Speaker C: Yeah. One that's just based upon a tip price, right. They're in the exact order that either they see chronologically, that some relay node sees chronologically, or they're just based upon exactly by the inclusion fee price on the transaction itself, that.
00:32:21.710 - 00:32:46.820, Speaker B: If just based on the transaction fee, you pretty much can do that just using the client you have. But that's a good question. It's definitely durable, but right now, we don't have a plan for that yet. Just be honest. With you.
00:32:47.350 - 00:33:26.118, Speaker C: Yeah. And I don't know if that really. To be honest, I don't even know if that really solves our problem. The issue is that if we trust each individual node to just do a fair ordering based upon inclusion fee, if they're inserting their own searches, their own bundles into it, but if there was a trusted relay that was doing it, then there might be a way. And again, we don't know, because obviously, if we don't extract the MEV, even the ethical Mav, then we are not as competitive. And are we doing a disservice to our Eth holders or not? That's kind of the question the community as a whole needs to be. Me.
00:33:26.118 - 00:33:42.980, Speaker C: Let me. Let me open it up to questions among our community members. But before we do that, Daniel or Ben, are there any other things that we didn't cover in these questions that you feel is important for our node operators or our liquid staking holders to know that we haven't talked about yet?
00:33:43.750 - 00:34:29.938, Speaker B: Sure. So, you kind of mentioned quite a lot about the debate your community have on how to being more competitive. But there's always some pushback on turning on the MEV relay. Right. So, I just want to demonstrate how much potential it could bring to you guys if you do use MEV relay. We have been monitoring the entire performance after the post merge, and we do see that there is a lot of good potential. There are some blocks includes over, like, ten or at the peak time.
00:34:29.938 - 00:35:20.420, Speaker B: We do saw, like, there's one time, there's a 30 e's in one single block. That's how much revenue you potentially can extract by using the mevs. And I don't. And again, I want to emphasize this. Try to use both mev from blockchrod and flashbots. We do see from time to time, the validator only connected to flashbots, and lose some potential MeV opportunity up to ten ease. We just saw those a couple of days ago.
00:35:20.420 - 00:36:16.740, Speaker B: A couple of times. You probably will see one or two times, at least from a day, roughly about, like, ten ease opportunity. That's how much revenue, potentially, you guys can generate by doing that. And right now, flashbots and the blockstrout contribute are definitely d two service provider on the market. We contribute, like I said, combined, over 90 ish percent of all the mev booster block. Just let you know, just are the facts. You guys have to decide eventually if you want to do or not.
00:36:17.830 - 00:37:03.570, Speaker C: Yeah, no, thank you for sharing those facts with us. And I think that's indeed the point where we're kind of at is we're trying to understand as much as we can, so hopefully we choose the best decision for the protocol as a whole. But yeah, we are very knowledgeable about. We've been calling them the lottery blocks, those very rare but very lucrative blocks. And in fact, that's one of the things I think many of the folks have been very much enjoying the past couple of weeks with the smoothing pool, because although we forego winning the lottery, we benefit from the collective win of the smoothing pool. And that's been fun. I think the biggest block it's got so far is just a little over six e, I believe it was, that we hit within a couple of days after the merge.
00:37:05.030 - 00:37:15.560, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a lot. Awesome. Yeah. Ben, do you have anything else to add on? No, nothing that comes to mind at the.
00:37:17.450 - 00:37:26.620, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm on this call here. I don't know, I might have to ask Mav if he sees anybody with their hands up. I didn't see any. Oh, wait a minute. There is a question here. Coming through and trading here. Yeah, perfect.
00:37:26.620 - 00:37:36.480, Speaker C: Is there any research on how Mev will impact or cross over in multi L2s in a multi oracle world?
00:37:42.870 - 00:38:22.140, Speaker B: I'm not quite aware about that, actually. You might find some articles, maybe from flashbots. I do remember during one of the event hosted by flashbots, they're talking about like cross median or cross platform mev opportunities. So there are for sure. But I personally didn't got too much opportunity to dig in in that field, particular field. Sorry about that.
00:38:23.330 - 00:39:08.780, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's the interesting thing is I think we're kind of, as they say, at the frontier of so many things, at the edge of knowledge is known, right. I don't know what cross L2 mev looks like. Does it have to route through layer one? What happens between cross chain Mev and who gets the value out of it? There's just so many things in this ecosystem that are new and opportunities that are opening that I think it's going to be a brave new world to explore. So I don't think I see any other questions unless there's anybody with their hand up. I'm just a speaker, not a co host, so I can't see who else is asking. But maybe Mav can chime in.
00:39:09.390 - 00:39:12.720, Speaker A: No, I don't see anyone else can.
00:39:13.730 - 00:39:36.100, Speaker B: By the way, I do remember one thing I probably want to mention is we did talk about like blocksroute does charge subscription fee for our users, but mainly for the traders, and we actually won't going to charge fees for validators who want to connect it to us. Just for the record.
00:39:36.490 - 00:39:56.680, Speaker C: Yeah. Perfect. Oh, excellent. Thank you very much. Yeah. Well, Danielle, Ben, it has been an absolute pleasure to have you on the call here to explain blocks route and help us be educated a little bit more about Mev and all that's there. So I really appreciate you guys taking the time out of your very busy schedule to come join our community call today.
00:39:57.690 - 00:40:01.834, Speaker B: We are so glad to be here. Yeah. Really been a pleasure.
00:40:01.882 - 00:40:02.460, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
