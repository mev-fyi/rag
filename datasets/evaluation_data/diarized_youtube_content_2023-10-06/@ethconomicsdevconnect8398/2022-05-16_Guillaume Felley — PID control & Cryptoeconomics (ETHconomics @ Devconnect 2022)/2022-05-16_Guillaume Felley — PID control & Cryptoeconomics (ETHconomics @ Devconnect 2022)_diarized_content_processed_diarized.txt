00:00:11.050 - 00:00:55.230, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. My name is Guillaume from reflex Labs. And today I want to speak to you about control theory and how consoled theory can be used in the context of crypto economics. And quickly, at reflex lab, we are building the rice stablecoin. And, yeah, I'll show how we leverage consort theory in the rice stablecoin. So, first, very briefly, what consort theory is. It's a well known field of engineering that exists long before crypto, and it's very basically like the science of maintaining stability.
00:00:55.230 - 00:02:11.800, Speaker A: So, like algorithmic controls of dynamical systems, and it's used everywhere in the real world, like, obviously a lot in industrial systems, probably in the heating system of this room, and so on and so on. A good example is like the cruise control of cars, right? So the car wants to go at a targeted speed, and the computer automatically increase the gas or decrease the gas to keep the car going at a constant speed. So more formally, you have a system with which you have some kind of levers to pull, and the controller pulled those levers. And on the other hand, you have a sensor that measure the state of the system and that feeds that back into the controller as an error regarding to the target. And the controller does its math to pull properly the levers to change the state of the system and to make it converge toward the target. So pid stands for proportional integral derivative. It consists of these three terms.
00:02:11.800 - 00:03:37.010, Speaker A: I'll briefly explain what they are. So proportional is just proportional to the error or the difference between our target state and the current state, and it's just a constant integral is like the cumulative error over time. So if your system is off your target for a longer period of time, you accumulate some error and it pulls the lever stronger the longer you stay off that target. And the last term is the derivative term, and this is based on the rate of change of the air, right? So with the derivative terms, you can kind of anticipate what you should do and capture sort of the inertia of your system that you are doing. So this is some well known theory about very basic consort theory and what this PID controllers are. This is typical example of real life, how it looks. So you have these sticks that target like a 45 degree angles, and the sticks is mounted on a motor, an electrical motor, and someone comes with a stick, perturbate the systems and quickly the motor shifts left and right to get back to 45 degrees.
00:03:37.010 - 00:04:37.650, Speaker A: And yeah, you can already get an idea of, by looking at the chart there, how this can be levered, used for a stable current. So a very key thing with a pad controller is that you have to tune it. And what this means is like calculating and choosing those PID constants that I mentioned before. So, before we're speaking about stablecoin, I want to mention some financial application of PID controllers. And this is a paper from some academics that showed that some monetary policy rules set by central bankers follows actually PID control. So that means that these central bankers are sort of like, implementating. They are using PID controller without knowing it indirectly.
00:04:37.650 - 00:05:35.590, Speaker A: So this is like the Taylor rule, which is like a famous policy rule, which speaks about what the central bank interest rate should be, depending on the inflation gap and the GDP. And this author goes on and shows that many of those policy rules follow some form of PID control. In theory, you could replace those central bankers by algorithm, but obviously, it's not that simple. First, moving to rye. So, very briefly, rye is a fork of Makerdao's MCD. So what we know as DAi, and there is one very key important difference, is that it's free floating, so its peg isn't $1. There is a floating peg where there is like this whole mechanism with the PID controller that decides the peg somehow.
00:05:35.590 - 00:05:59.022, Speaker A: And last but not least, it's ether only collateral. I'll go a bit in the detail of how it works. So, first, three important definitions. First, redemption price, or aka the moving peg. So that's the target value of rye and its internal value within the system.
00:05:59.076 - 00:05:59.294, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:59.332 - 00:06:39.500, Speaker A: So rye is a system similar to maker. You have vault or cdps, that you mint rye against. So, like, the redemption price is the target price, the price at which you mint, at which you repay your debt, at which you're liquidated, and so on and so on. And at equilibrium, the market price is equal to this redemption price, and it starts at an arbitrary value. We started rye at PI, so 314 something. It doesn't matter where you start. Like, we didn't want to pick one to avoid biasing people thinking that it should stay at 1.
00:06:39.500 - 00:06:52.430, Speaker A: Second term is like the redemption rate, which is the rate of change of the redemption price. So it's the direction and the magnitude of which this peg is moving.
00:06:52.500 - 00:06:52.782, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:52.836 - 00:07:55.022, Speaker A: So it comes in the form of an interest. So, for example, like, 10% a year would mean, like, the peg going up 10% a year, the target price. And last, you have the redemption rate feedback mechanism. So this is this whole system that sets the rate that is then setting the price with the PID controller. So how does that work? Write trades on the secondary market on some dexes on uniswap or whatever, and you have an oracle that check the price of rye, and that measure the difference between the blue curve, which is the target price, and the green one, which is the current market price. So this will be the input to the controller. The controller will do its math and output a redemption rate.
00:07:55.022 - 00:08:32.170, Speaker A: And here in that example, so the price is slightly above the market at the red arrow. And this will make the PID controller to output like a negative rate. So here we have, for example, like -11% .1 per year. So it means that if the system stay like that over a year, the target price will go down 11%. So this rate is then applied to the price, and the price will slightly go down. So as you can see, the blue lines trends slowly downward.
00:08:32.170 - 00:09:14.302, Speaker A: And this process repeats itself again and over and again and again, all the time. The intuition that you should have here is that this rate moving should oppose the market. If rye is above its target for too long, we will start to move the target down. And it's this PID algorithm that calculates how strong you should move down. The redemption price is affecting the right market this way. And let's look at how it affects the right market and its price.
00:09:14.356 - 00:09:14.622, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:14.676 - 00:09:17.982, Speaker A: So there are two sides of this.
00:09:18.036 - 00:09:18.254, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:18.292 - 00:10:06.062, Speaker A: They are the right holders and that hold the coin. And they are the CDP owners, or safe owners, as we call them, or vault, as maker calls them. So first, the rye holders. If the peg is going down, so negative redemption rate, like before, it means that if I'm holding on my rye, if it works as expected, I'm losing value in dollar terms, right? And this is bad. So some of them might sell because you don't want to take on that loss. So, yes, selling will lead the price to go down. And inversely, if the rate is positive, my stable coin is worth slightly more, a bit more of a time.
00:10:06.062 - 00:11:05.810, Speaker A: So I might just buy some more to take advantage of that rate. And on the other side, on the side of the minters of rye, and if the redemption price is going down, it actually means that my collateralization ratio is going up. So for them, their position is getting safer and safer, like further away from liquidations. So in theory, they could mint more rye without taking additional risk, which expands the supply, which put through supply and demand, like price pressure on rye, because there is now more supply, and inversely, the price going up. My position is getting more and more risky over time. I might either need to add collateral or repay a bit of my debt, which might lead to the price of rye going up. So this is the two most important mechanisms through why the redemption price is affecting the rye market.
00:11:05.810 - 00:12:04.882, Speaker A: And that's why it makes sense to oppose that market, make them converge. So the market price and the redemption price, there are secondary mechanism to consider, right? Just like arbitragers that expect the price will go back to its target, so they buy above the target and they sell above the target and buy below, and also those that are doing rate arbitrage. So if I see the rate, I could just take advantage of that rate on either buying rye or opening a position and benefit from the rate as a yield. So quickly. Rye was launched in February 2021. It had 317 million TvL, as it speaks, 3000 user position. In practice, the rate moved plus or minus, like 10% of the redemption price.
00:12:04.882 - 00:12:37.870, Speaker A: And the rate is over, like less than 5%, more or less in practice. And yeah, there was a bunch of liquidation, and it's working as expected so far. This is how the price looks like. So the market price is the purple one, the noisy one, and the red one is the target price. So I mentioned before that we started at PI. We can see that at the beginning, it's close to 314. And then in the early on, we had a lot of volatility, and people didn't really understand the system.
00:12:37.870 - 00:13:27.806, Speaker A: So the renovation price went down due to demand. And nowadays, we are like more stables, slightly trending downward. And that's the rate, how the rate has been looking like since the start. So we can see the high rate from the early days and the more stable, smaller rate that we have nowadays. And right now, for example, the rate is negative. You could ask long term, what does that mean? Right. It's kind of weird that you have like a dollar stablecoin and that change in target price in dollars, and what is it going to be in one year, five years, 100 years? A key factor with this pad control is like a sustain and balance between supply and demand for the stablecoin, right.
00:13:27.806 - 00:14:53.494, Speaker A: Because that's ultimately what this thing does. It's like rebalancing between supply and demand. And yes, the peg, the target is going to move, but it's going to move slow and in a predictable way because it's an algorithm. Why? So this is all about matching supply and demand, right? So your supply is like rye Minters, and your demand is like rye holders. And these two things, like, if you think about maker, how it worked, and how it works in rye as well, is that it relies on different phenomenon that are kind of independent to each other, right? The supply of rye depends on kind of the appetite for leverage for people that want to long eth and that are willing to mint rye, while the demand side, like the rye holder, it depends simply the demand for a stablecoin, right. If you have like a wide set of usage for your coin and, I don't know, you buy your groceries and so on, there will be more people that need the rye, while if you're not, well, you have less demand. And this phenomenon are, we observed that phenomenon are in practice rather independent and rather inversely correlated due to the nature of the volatility of the crypto.
00:14:53.494 - 00:15:21.022, Speaker A: I mean, the crypto price cycles. So there appears where the price is going up, there is a lot of leverage in the market, and nobody wants to hold on to stables. And when the price is going down, you have, of course, much less leverage. People would rather hold on to stable. So you need to match supply and demand in this context. So that's why the redemption price exists.
00:15:21.086 - 00:15:21.700, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:27.130 - 00:16:18.802, Speaker A: Another way to see that, if you have traded before on those perpetual swap contracts, on centralized exchanges, you probably heard somewhere that long pay short or short pay longs, right? And this is exactly the same with rye. So, like, either rye minters pay rye holders or older pays rye minter. And this is like to balance market forces, and it's something you need. And why do you need that? So an example is what happened to maker and how they solved that problem. This mismatch between supply and demand. This is the ratio of stablecoin backing die in Makerdao, USDC, USDT, et cetera. And we can see that it was first introduced on Black Thursday.
00:16:18.802 - 00:17:39.582, Speaker A: So in March 2020, when there was like this huge market crash. And as a response to that, this market crash caused a massive deleveraging, which now there was a bunch of, I mean, there was much more demand for Dai than there was supply because people were not holding onto their maker vault. So in response, they introduced for the first time, USDC on Black Thursday. And then you can map on this chart, like every crypto price cycles, for example, that was the pretty violent May 2021 market crash. And you can see that, you can see the price here, but as the price of east went down, the ratio of stablecoin in maker is shooting up. And yeah, you can also see on the recent market cycles, the takeaway from that is that in maker, when there is a mismatch between supply and demand, it's going to be USDC absorbing that lack of supply that's going to absorb expansion and contraction in supply. You might wonder about this huge increase here.
00:17:39.582 - 00:18:12.086, Speaker A: It was like a policy change on the maker side where they lowered collar chain ratio from 120 to 101. And they did that because die was trading slightly above peg for quite extended period of time. And they did that and that fixed the problem. Now you could ask, isn't $1 a better user experience for a dollar stablecoin? So probably, but yeah, it's hard to do without introducing construal risk.
00:18:12.118 - 00:18:12.362, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:12.416 - 00:18:52.124, Speaker A: So you don't want to onboard this type of collateral. It's different set of trade offs. Like a flexible pegs allows you to balance market forces and therefore to slowly back by eth your cover collateralized stable coin and still manage to stabilize yourself. So that's it. Thank you very much. And yeah, bit of time for questions. Yeah, questions.
00:18:52.242 - 00:18:57.810, Speaker B: Is there any questions on the left? Can you.
00:19:01.060 - 00:19:28.236, Speaker C: Hi, if I just want to use rye as a stable coin by my shopping with, how should I like the question you asked earlier about what should I think about the value of it in one year or five years? Or if I'm a shop owner and I want to price my goods in rye, how can I expect the level of future volatility? Or do you think the design is such that it will tend eventually to a kind of tiny bound of value?
00:19:28.338 - 00:20:28.076, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, crazy thing can happen in the market, right? And within reasonable market, the rate is going to be tiny, fairly small of course. What's your definition of reasonable and so on? It's a fair question. Right. But the PID is tuned and designed in a way that the rates cannot exceed certain values. So it's also bounded in the worst case. And as I've before, it depends on some factors such as supply and demand for a coin and so on and so on. But yeah, I agree that it can be scary because if you want to hold on to some dollars and that it's actually moving regarding to that value.
00:20:28.178 - 00:20:29.420, Speaker B: It'S kind of strange.
00:20:30.400 - 00:20:40.832, Speaker C: So it's just track record. Eventually someone will say, oh, it's been within x percent of this price for the last year, so I'm willing to accept the risk that it's not going to move too much.
00:20:40.886 - 00:20:56.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the mechanism is very similar to these perpetual swap contracts. And what we have observed there in practice is that as long as the market is liquid, it trades pretty close to the underlying.
00:20:57.820 - 00:21:02.650, Speaker B: Thanks. Thank you. We have a question there.
00:21:10.400 - 00:21:55.208, Speaker D: Can you talk a bit about the relation of rye and the US dollar in regards to using the US dollar for the oracle price? You could say it is still kind of like bound to the inflation rate of the US dollar, for instance. But then you could say, okay, it has a floating pack so it can trend up against the US dollar. But what about taking something like a mean of the oracle price could be fed from the rye price against US dollar against euro, against a basket of different currencies where these considerations that are being made.
00:21:55.294 - 00:22:43.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's true that there is no reason to stick to the US dollar rate. And ideally we would have liked to use a basket of currency or something like that, but it was just much more practical on ethereum to have a resilient and trustworthy us dollar feed. So we just went for that right now. But, yeah, it's possible to switch the oracle of the denomination over time because we have a strong thesis that there should be as little governance as possible and the system should be as medical as possible. But oracle is not part of those things because something can go wrong with what we're currently using. And so.
00:22:43.130 - 00:22:49.900, Speaker A: Yeah, but US dollar was for practical reasons that we picked.
00:22:53.120 - 00:22:54.670, Speaker B: Question on the left.
00:23:01.590 - 00:23:13.350, Speaker E: Hi, I just wanted to ask about FLX and how it's going so far, the whole ungovernance and removing different parameters from the control mechanisms.
00:23:14.090 - 00:23:54.600, Speaker A: Yeah. So briefly, there will be like a set of parameters that you can still change, such as oracles, as I already mentioned, but also some more minor, ideally, for example, the PID controller parameter, we want to freeze them as well, but since it's like a more novel technology and we don't, it's fairly new, we will take a bit more time before we lock this parameter down. And regarding to effect, it's still like the governance tokens for these remaining parameters and also like the depth and surplus token, similar to the maker model.
00:23:55.290 - 00:24:08.506, Speaker E: So I think there was in the earliest announcement, it was supposed to be sometime around this week when the first phase of removal of governance was going to happen. Just checking if there's an update on that.
00:24:08.608 - 00:24:53.910, Speaker A: Yeah, so just to explain, we really believe that crypto systems should be, we call it ungoverned or immutable as much as possible, and that's, in our opinion, what crypto protocol should aim at. And so we've stricted around like an ungovernance worldmap that we call, that is most two, three big milestones. A week ago was the first big milestone where access control of many functions and contracts were burned. And they're going to be the next one in August.
00:24:59.080 - 00:25:01.830, Speaker B: Okay, let's thank Guillaume one more time.
00:25:03.240 - 00:25:04.180, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:25:04.250 - 00:25:17.530, Speaker B: Thank you. You think our.
