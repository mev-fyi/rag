00:00:10.730 - 00:00:55.118, Speaker A: Let's begin. So the first thing is like, yeah, I gotta tell you this, because we're gonna talk a little bit spicy things here. So since I work for the company, I just don't want to say like anything that I'm saying here is any kind of financial advice or anything. Also a little bit about why I want to say this. Sorry about that. So myself, my name is Matt, I'm just an Ethereum fan, a developer who's more of obsessed with proof of stake of Ethereum design. Oathman left.
00:00:55.118 - 00:01:49.482, Speaker A: Why that is important, why we are bringing complexity. It's not really complex, by the way, but it's simple and it's open and it's permissionless and it's verifiable. So a lot of things are we saying why ETH proof of stake matters? And it's a road towards much more public verifiability and reusable data and reusable application level. What ETH is today from the proof of work concept and what it would be tomorrow when the merge comes, when the execution layer and the consensus layer just join together. And what we're going to see, so it's more about ETH today is proof of work. Miners gets a lot of ETH. There is no accounting like, apart from what you burn, like EIP 1559, this is not going to users.
00:01:49.482 - 00:02:35.354, Speaker A: So it's printed money, it's going to the miners and it's coming back, but it's not really deflationary. But that's going to change when the proof of stake comes, because it's going to be going to be directly to the user's hand, who are the validators. So that's the flip here, how ETH, ETH as an asset is a community held asset, which is keeping the network uptime all the time. We have settled more than a trillion dollar asset in the last year. So bitcoin has a lot of value, but it's not settling as much as ETH is settling. So from that perspective, it's a community held asset, it's much more powerful. So from proof of work, all this community network revenue is going back to its users.
00:02:35.354 - 00:03:52.162, Speaker A: So it is going to be extremely important to see that how this amplification of the growth will happen at the application level, because it is maintained by self interest of people who want to deliver value to end users through their innovative product, not because of holding an asset per se. So we have better context here. Right. So this is just a bit of a thing. What we're going to talk, we're going to take the ETH and we're going to apply this ETH staked in proof of stake in the rollups world. And what's that going to bring it to us? Is that just the data availability or the security, or is that going to bring something else that can make rollups successful and they can bring real value to the world? Right? So my take is like a staked asset as a safe assets. So everything that we're going to talk from, not from a technical like the node, we can talk about later, we can talk about that, but from the economic impact of the asset transfer and the network.
00:03:52.162 - 00:04:42.582, Speaker A: So a staked asset belongs to a 32 e validator. Because anyone can run a node with a 32, you don't really have to have a bunch of that. So you can have thousands and thousands of servers syncing the network at the same time. And it is securing the network. So staked assets is like, what take is, my take is like two class, it's like staked assets as a safe asset from an economic perspective is as a debt. Why? Because it has been held as a debt for a long term viability of ethereum. And we can do that into two way, we have consensus rewards, that is paid by doing a validation job today that's 4.5,
00:04:42.582 - 00:05:26.354, Speaker A: whatever it is. And then we have at an individual level, the stakers will get that reward, that's they're happy, but at a social level, that's the nodes that have a collection of validators, they have the revenues that can collect later tomorrow from the fee and from other constructive syndication. I wouldn't say Mev, I would love to say that MeV, but that's a very misleading word, because when you have a programmability, you can basically inject any kind of logic and you can bring constructive markets on top of it as long as it is open. So that is very important. Let's say that. Oh, let's keep it simple. What the hell is simplicity? All right, you come to me, I will prove it.
00:05:26.354 - 00:05:56.074, Speaker A: How these provers work. Token, token, token, token, right. Nothing else. So you want to pay for tokens or you want to go and say that Ethereum network, you can just get this data from a node and you can do different things with the smart contract architecture. The good thing there, Ethereum deposit contract, go there, you burned the eth. You can basically get a deterministic state route. No one can tamper that, it's on Ethereum.
00:05:56.074 - 00:06:27.714, Speaker A: Proof of work is that simple? It is. So we can bring simplicity in different way. So two different factors here. People should be able to retrade the value the network is creating. That's very important, right. And it should be tokenized. So how does this work? Because we are creating this very large network of loosely connected interdependent independent players.
00:06:27.714 - 00:06:58.066, Speaker A: There are interdependency, so we have this kind of common interest to keep things going, but also we have the controlling interest. Let's say if I don't validate, I get leaked. My validator, right? If I misbehave, my controlling interest in the network will just go down. I can get slashed. If I have more than n number of validators in the network, the slashing quotations goes up. So it's a nice balance. There's a lot of things going into it.
00:06:58.066 - 00:07:48.142, Speaker A: So you have this kind of common interest and control interest, and also you have a certain level of risk freeness in terms of what you get. You don't really have to worry about if you run a dap node or any kind of the packages and you keep your machine open, and if you have a stable Internet connection, you're not going to do any malicious behavior. You can get the inflation rewards very free. It's like kind of a very risk averse, but if you're a very active player, very dynamic, you want to get more and more. You want to get like, I don't know, some kind of a private memble strategy, transaction, ordering, you can optimize that. That's like if you have validator today on Ethereum. Ethereum will not say that after two years, come here and run an auction.
00:07:48.142 - 00:08:17.798, Speaker A: You give me this much eth, I'm going to give you another validator. No, once you have validators, have forever. So it's a perpetual yield. As long as you can keep that up. It's permissionless world, man can make it, you can lose it, you protect yourself. Right? But the thing it is, this is getting interesting. If we can connect this layer with redeemability, the asset at stake on a consensus layer can be redeemable on execution layer.
00:08:17.798 - 00:08:50.818, Speaker A: We need to connect this. How do we do this? The redemption guarantees. Redemption guarantees bring the dynamic trading strategies much more better at application level. So if you have a wrapped ether, you can send it to uniswap and then you have that redemption guarantee at a deterministic way. You're not trading WBTC for shap because the smart contracts knows that. So you need to have that kind of a very direct connection and a trustless accounting. So trustless accounting means you don't need anyone to prove that you don't need any fancy proofs.
00:08:50.818 - 00:09:14.430, Speaker A: I'm not against any CK. I worked in a lot of that. Allow it. But we shouldn't bring an intermediary between a public network. People should be able to publicly verifiable data. And now we have another guy in between. We have validators, we have all this roll ups coming.
00:09:14.430 - 00:09:31.330, Speaker A: But they all have to deal with a fee market. We have a priority gas options. We have variable block size and we're going to have 12 seconds. 12 seconds. 12 seconds. Blocks. No more uncles.
00:09:31.330 - 00:10:04.380, Speaker A: They are gone. It's only one block. So what's going to happen? You have a lot of strategies, you have all this kind of abstractions, display all this 12 seconds. The last 2 seconds or 3 seconds will be extremely valuable because you need to be in the block to get that value out. So the gas auction will see that amplification. Right. So EIP fee market, we believe that will actually get better and better if you have this kind of tooling and applications built, truly exploring this capabilities that we build.
00:10:04.380 - 00:10:37.170, Speaker A: We're not at there, we're just barely starting. So this is from the Block native. They were just showing the shard incomes. Forget about the green thing, this is a graph. But what I'm saying is when we have kind of more roll ups, things like that, the transaction volume will increase on outside layers. But these outside layers, are they dependent on ETh? That's a question here, right. If they are dependent on ETH then they are having more common interest that I explained to you to keep the ETH at the bay.
00:10:37.170 - 00:10:54.190, Speaker A: Right. That's the key thing. Common interest and controlling interest. So people don't want to pay a lot of gas. We understand that it's dollar you don't want to pay like $50 for to buy a coffee or something. So they will definitely goes into cheaper paths. But those cheaper paths also need to be safer.
00:10:54.190 - 00:11:16.020, Speaker A: Just look at this, the two second scene that I mentioned. You can see that again from block native. NFT drop, right? Today's NFT drop, but tomorrow it could be anything, right. So you have like about 30 minutes. It's about four epochs. That's the thing. How many? 32 slots each.
00:11:16.020 - 00:12:10.790, Speaker A: You know who is going to make a block? A proposer and a tester. That's how it's getting rewarded. But if you want to be in there, you have to go and get this guy and negotiate with them and get your things inside. And how do we make this all this in programmable? So that's what we trying to do for the last two years we've been working on this and we've done some work. We presented some of the things on 19th, sorry, with our partners that will be open online so you can watch it later. So our take is like tokenize it, make it available on Ethereum, tokenize the consensus rewards so that can have, that's going to deep liquidity and then the dynamic data trading strategies tokenize the validator revenues that I just mentioned. So that is basically going on the service flow based.
00:12:10.790 - 00:12:55.170, Speaker A: So that creates a different kind of markets and keep this optimal level of Ethereum validators. This is very important because we are going towards very high performance network. We'll get into that in a second. So the stakehouse, we say it's a name, it's a house of stakers, it's a clubhouse for stakers, whatever you call it, just a smart contract, it's nothing else. Right? It's a smart contract suit. We say that 24 at the effective balance of ETH, 24 just goes into this kind of inflation. Consensus rewards and eight will give to this kind of service players who are more active but who want to get these revenues, they will get all the revenue, but they will also become the first line of defense.
00:12:55.170 - 00:13:33.170, Speaker A: So the one key thing here to remember is the inventory of the consensus layer. That is a 3232-3232 that could be 31, there could be 30, there could be 28. That should reflect automatically on a smart contract or available off chain. So what we did, there's another thing, he left, man, you should have stayed here. Uth so. Right, uth, yes, I agree with that. Uth is very simple and you get the deterministic states, because proof of stakes are very contextual state machines.
00:13:33.170 - 00:14:24.126, Speaker A: So we bring up with a registry contract structure. Registry contracts are, we build optimistic utxs on top of account model, so you can have this kind of issuance and tighter issuance model. Once you have that, you have an a tokens and you can get the data from a node, you don't really need to prove it if you can get it from a node. If there's an information in a node that is derived from a consensus that is kind of certified data, and you can get network propagation much more faster than going through a block. So the registry contracts will allow you to have the asset value locked in, but its live value will be available off chain. So now we're talking about the high frequency trading. All this kind of scenario can be done in a naive way.
00:14:24.126 - 00:15:11.200, Speaker A: To think about this is like cowswap does this in a way that the trading, right, you have the solvers like you have this locked up capital in a smart contract, but they're not using registry contracts in any way. What I'm saying is the approach, but you can get it if you can agree it. But now all these guarantees are coming from the registry contracts. But you only take certain kind of data into the registry that have a deterministic guarantees, right. That has been approved and synced and kept by the nodes in the consensus layer. So let's look at the roll up. Roll ups need base layer, they need eight to put that data proof time to time less data.
00:15:11.200 - 00:15:43.302, Speaker A: So roll ups obviously need a lot of ETH at their disposal. They rely that for the security. Let it be ck, let it be optimistic. Any kind of roll ups, maybe sometimes the side chains can also do that for vanity purpose. We are dependent on Ethereum, but we can also not to be dependent on Ethereum someday when we become bigger, right? So upon all that we big, we are Ethereum fanboys. Good. So this would be the IP five five nine market and the roll ups.
00:15:43.302 - 00:16:35.434, Speaker A: But the validators are there same and they will be like watching. So in general, what's going to happen is when all these things are tokenized, the values are tokenized, it's tradable, and it's available, then these kind of metamarkets can emerge off chain, right. How do you basically negotiate in between the block times where you can go, you can have a slow tokens at the service, low tokens that we just discussed. And if they can represent the fee revenues that actually going into the execution layer. We have some talks about PBS, which is not there. I'm not really following that latest proposal, but you can basically create that kind of like proposal builder separations and everything here. And people who invested, or I would say put the ETH don't really have to worry about.
00:16:35.434 - 00:17:28.954, Speaker A: They can lease that the validator rights to people who want to play with it and they can take a piece of revenue. But end of the day, it's all more and more and more ETH will get injected, it will create an endogenous market. So if you have, we're sucking a lot of ETH into crypto, right? So it should create about six to $7 worth of value. So here what we're trying to do is playing this inelastic market hypothesis at the macro level, you can see this kind of microelasticity or the validator level. But if you take a shared validator, it's like at a macro level, it is inelastic in a long term, right. Because you can substitute that. Not every blocks are same, not every epochs are same, not every validator balance are same.
00:17:28.954 - 00:17:58.786, Speaker A: So it gets amortized. But if you can reuse that, then you can expand it. So we're going from a security thing to a base yield, right? Look at the l two s today it's about five, 6 billion. It's going to be exponentially large. But this 6 billion is nothing. Because if you look at all the roll ups, same dabs, mostly likely all the roll ups have it. Multichain strategy.
00:17:58.786 - 00:18:17.338, Speaker A: It's good to bootstrap, but we would love to see roll ups more impactful, more purpose driven, more focused. If they want to get that, they want to bootstrap it. So at the know, we have money market too. You have money market? Yes. I have an NFT market too. Yes, the same thing in a plug and play. But this is how we begin.
00:18:17.338 - 00:19:06.806, Speaker A: But going forward, what could be, we should bring a network that can provide real, just a use case, right? So I'm not saying this is any kind of thesis here, but let's look at what the best impactful way that we can do it is like. If we can bring the financial inclusion, the roll ups would be a very good way because they're cheaper, they're faster. If they have some base yield, what they're going to do is they can bring a lot of people, they can have this kind of last mile user onboarding on ramp. The toolings will come, but the yield should be there. So if you look at the fintech, you say that the largest operation of the 73%, I think it will be different. The current data is a little bit about a year back, but 73% is account opening. People want to get into digital because it's easier.
00:19:06.806 - 00:19:33.650, Speaker A: So the question here is everyone says it's going to be ramping up. Why do we need a physical ledger in a digital world where people want to come in a digital world could be fair and open, but are we good enough to beat them at their own game? That's a question here. Right? So what if we can. So this is just a representation. Don't take it for granted. We're just exploring. We're just exploring here.
00:19:33.650 - 00:20:12.398, Speaker A: So if we have like about 7% on a dollar rate can stem from this kind of two variants of, I said, consensus rewards and the service flow. Roll ups need the block space. They want the ETH, they can incentivize it. We already seeing it how the people are incentivizing to more liquidity into it. They can reuse that, they can repackage it. So you can actually have this kind of, in a real world that we have the balance fund mechanism, but here it is like risk free, like a de, that's just going up because it's a consensus reward. As long as it's there, it happens.
00:20:12.398 - 00:21:08.174, Speaker A: But the other one is dynamic, it's more risk proven. So you can have this kind of bundle, but the other unit of account is like you can basically keep a debt tracked so that you have this kind of indexes in today's world, but this will be available for anyone. And you're basically tracking the proof of stake validator rates, and you can verify it on the fly from the nodes, and you can get all this information, it's there, you can keep that going. So with the registry contracts, you can basically use this and just use a hash for account opening, and then you can connect it to an account not going in details into how you can do it, but you can definitely do it. I'll show you. So we ran some simulation. If we kind of do like in a 7% target rate, in a dollar, people can just put that money and that will be reused to put into staking, and that stake though will be tokenized, will get used to into all the roll ups.
00:21:08.174 - 00:21:41.702, Speaker A: So this is like a strategy, right? The dynamic trading strategy explained, roll ups want to have this kind of longer block lease, so box spaces, so they want to have people to be engaged and keep there there, and they reuse it for their application. So you can see that very unmaintained nothing dump. Keep that money and just keep it going. No one is incentivized to keep that up. Still it is up. You can see the red thing is going down. It's barely like in a huge hit, so less than ten, but you can track it, the liquidation will be much lesser.
00:21:41.702 - 00:22:18.102, Speaker A: And you can also kind of have a drip based liquidation, like the leakage that we have in validators. But what if someone incentivize it to keep that, right? So if there someone is incentivized to get this ETH bundled over there, because it's a very scarce asset, you don't get more than either 120,000,000. So ETH is one of the second largest trading pair. So obviously people want it. And as we grow as more application using it, they want to do it if it has been incentivized to keep it, if people are interested in it. That's what we are saying. Obviously they're interested.
00:22:18.102 - 00:22:53.490, Speaker A: So we can keep it about 150% collateralized. So we are talking about a savings account which is open for universally on everyone have an Internet connection without going through any ponzies. But that is getting reused. The money is getting reused. So someone is actually doing it. So what he can do today, that's a question, right? All these things, what he said, fantasy or ecstasy? I don't know. He's saying fantasy, you cannot do it today, we can do it in long term.
00:22:53.490 - 00:23:16.302, Speaker A: ETH just works today, that's why it matters in the long term. You want to do it, we are all dead. I didn't say that. Milton Keane said that. So let's work on something. What you can do today. We've been doing something around in this line, so we have shipped registry contracts integrally.
00:23:16.302 - 00:23:57.990, Speaker A: You can go and play with it, there are sdks, you can create money markets and things, everything just playing around with the stake deal, that's all what I'm saying. What are the primitives that you want to do? You can do it. We've been open sourcing the code, it is available, but we're waiting for more and more formal verification to come out on the formal modeling how this is working without oracle. This is the mechanism design how we can correlate the data in a public verifiability from the node and we can do this in a better way, we can build a better world together. So go there, you can have all this information, but catch us, we'll be happy to help you. Yeah, so you can do it today. You don't really have to fantasize anything for tomorrow.
00:23:57.990 - 00:24:26.854, Speaker A: These are the papers. I have to say that because people done an amazing job. That's all I have. If you're ready for sound money, ultrasound money, let's fucking go. That's it. Any questions? Sounds everyone understood? Yeah, go ahead.
00:24:27.052 - 00:24:53.200, Speaker B: I'm curious how you view there was a talk earlier, there was a talk earlier about minimum viable issuance around pos. And I'm curious how you see the risk of the tokenized state ETH, the returns of that versus the risk that that gives you when the idea is under minimum viable issuance the deflation is actually still giving a value up, right?
00:24:53.570 - 00:25:39.414, Speaker A: Yeah. So it is very important. So this is the last point, the countercyclical, right? So the point of the eth mechanism is you can see how the eth consensus rewards are going from more and more each stake it gets lesser and lesser, right? So you have this kind of consensus rewards coming. That's what I said, you have two kind of revenue streams. When the proof of stake comes in the service flow, that you can optimize it, you can play with the transaction ordering. Some of the times the liquidation has to go, any kind of big protocols can plug into some RPC endpoint and say like these are the slow token holders, I want to get through the safe path, I'm ready to give incentivize when my token. So these are outside of it, right? So there is a lot of other elements come into play for the ETH issuance.
00:25:39.414 - 00:26:22.074, Speaker A: It's very important because it is already countercyclical, right. The behavior comes in when someone actually misbehave to certain more than threshold. The slashing quotient goes up. So it is intervening, but it is programmable. So all the thing that you see in the interventions are there, right? So it's not really like in proof of work, you're not paying anything, the burn fee is there, but in proof of stake, it's deflationary by default because the rewards are going back to the users. With a simple computer you can basically do that, right? It can be an auto operator. So it's paying to its users, it's getting to more and more and more hands.
00:26:22.074 - 00:27:03.314, Speaker A: We're doing that. We're basically going that from, I don't know, maybe million holders by ETH to 200 million holders of ETH, it is better. And also whatever the staked asset having this kind of leakage, if your uptime is lesser leakage, and also when we go for supermajority, that's very interesting, because when we will have a block deterministic guarantees, everyone want to have 32 eth, because the proposer, the builder need that. The priority is there. If you have 32, that's you have the priority, right? You know who is going to block you. So there's lot of things that's been baked into. We got to read the specification.
00:27:03.314 - 00:27:24.640, Speaker A: It's amazing. Proof of stake. The beacon chain specification is going to be the new Bible man. It's amazing. It's a really good question. Issuance is very programmable and it's very resilient in my opinion compared to any other proof of stake design. Any other question? Yes.
00:27:27.730 - 00:27:47.026, Speaker C: I saw you were talking a lot about having tokenized staked teeth, and then you want to tokenize the yield, and not just tokenize the yield of staked teeth, but you want to split the tokenization into one part is just like the validator set rewards, right? And then the other part is, was it like MeV or the tips.
00:27:47.218 - 00:28:31.474, Speaker A: So I will just simplify that when I say tokenization is like, and I said consensus rewards and the service flow, that's what we see, right? Consensus rewards are the one that has been paid by the chain, right. After the validation should give to a certain large portion of users and small portion of users are where the dynamic players. If you look at the synthetic entity model in the economics, right, you take a sampling model, right? It's a group and group, right? So the nodes are the one who is running. Not everyone is going to run a node. So you have like ten or 100 validators in that. So nodes are the one who is actively participating in this kind of proposing blocks and things like that, right. You have always this entry point, right? So the service flow is more driven by them.
00:28:31.474 - 00:28:46.230, Speaker A: So what we think is the yield, the staked ETH yield is not only the consensus rewards, it also includes the transaction order and optimization. I wouldn't call as an Mee, it's not extraction, it's like more of a resource allocation.
00:28:48.250 - 00:28:58.666, Speaker C: Mean you're talking about having tokenized staked. So obviously there are competitors, right? There's like lido and rocket pool and they already have staked ETH and liquidity for that. Yeah, where this all fits into the.
00:28:58.688 - 00:29:24.546, Speaker A: No, I want to draw a line there. So we are not a liquid staking provider. We are not anything related to that. We just only deploy the smart contract so you can have a registry of the staked ETH that is not available today. So the consensus layer data to be propagated for the execution layer. So everything. So we just basically expand the same specification in the smart contracts and build a new smart contract architecture so anyone can do it.
00:29:24.546 - 00:29:32.054, Speaker A: So it's not a synthetic, by the way. So basically just keep that dual factory registry, who owns what at any given point.
00:29:32.092 - 00:29:39.686, Speaker C: If I want to participate in this, I still need to have my own node with 32 ETH and then I set, you don't really need, I'm going to use this smart contract to sort of tokenize that.
00:29:39.788 - 00:30:08.066, Speaker A: Yeah, so you don't really need a node. You can basically go to joinstakehouse.com, you have gorely ETH and it just give you faucet things like you can just play with it 60 seconds. You can get stake if you have 32 ETH as a first layer in a player. And if you don't really have 32 Eth, if you don't really have 32 ETh, you just get a de from Uniswap or elsewhere. But your de has a direct atomic dependency to a validator and a BLS key. And you can see it, I'm not sure.
00:30:08.066 - 00:30:33.980, Speaker A: Yeah, see here, so this is basically, right, this is basically graph, right. This is execution layer. Yeah. Can you see here? Okay, see number of register validity. I'm just pulling the data from the consensus layer. Pratter to Gorilli, by the way. Right.
00:30:33.980 - 00:31:10.294, Speaker A: So you can see that how many validators been registered is 141. They put the money into, they have the validators going on. But not everyone has minted this d and slow tokens securely, can see 111. Right. It's all fetching the data from a node. Right. But we have a lot of problems because not many toolings out there.
00:31:10.294 - 00:31:39.742, Speaker A: The nodes are not providing all this kind of testnet and things like that. So we have to do a lot of heavy lifting. You can also see how many groups of validators has been formed called steakhouses. And they all represent as a tickers. Now they can have tokenized tickets. This is like a grouping and grouping and grouping, but end of the day, all the details aggregate, fungible, it's just like cash, but the registry keeps in between, which is the validator has been issued and coming back. So that's the key thing.
00:31:39.742 - 00:31:43.178, Speaker A: So it's just in propagation of the data from the consensus layer.
00:31:43.274 - 00:31:51.982, Speaker C: So does that mean the staked teeth from one node is not fungible with stake teeth from another node? Like you couldn't just put it all in like a liquidity pool.
00:31:52.046 - 00:32:03.240, Speaker A: You can with this, you can, that's what we did. So we implemented this economic protocol on top of the logic to make sure the fungibility is there. So the reusability is there. You can also take a de from.
00:32:04.490 - 00:32:08.120, Speaker C: There must be a bunch of rules for like, oh, if there's some slashing going on, like who?
00:32:09.770 - 00:32:26.046, Speaker A: That's what we were like testing. That's why there's a very huge tooling database and formal verification is happening. All these equations are playing very well. The mechanism designs are very good. It's like uniswap, but it's for staked benefit. It's a public benefit infrastructure. So anyone can do anything with that.
00:32:26.046 - 00:32:55.122, Speaker A: But remember, this is stake. The asset in consensus layer today is available in execution. So you can have the same token, the same weather. Okay, Alpha lake, sorry guys, the gateways are coming in two months. That's also going to be in sandbox. You can basically take the yield from Ethereum to roll ups and nosis in, and you can have this kind of. So by default ETH is 25% extra yield because it's 24 e, right? Getting 32 eth worth of yield.
00:32:55.122 - 00:33:19.920, Speaker A: So it's better so you can have ETH deliver with yield to roll ups. So that's a base yield. If you want to do any kind of applications, you want to give a kit to make a money market, you don't really need to go and lending and borrowing, you have that kind of base yield delivered to you on a platter. So this is why we are saying that's a reusability. You want to get this reusability. That's the flywheel kicking in. So we want to reuse ETH at work.
00:33:19.920 - 00:33:24.722, Speaker A: Makes sense. It's just smart contracts, nothing else. We're not doing anything else.
00:33:24.856 - 00:33:28.190, Speaker C: This is all done natively instead of relying on a liquidity pool.
00:33:28.270 - 00:33:35.040, Speaker A: Yeah, nothing there. Cool. Awesome. Thank you, Matt. Thank you for having me.
