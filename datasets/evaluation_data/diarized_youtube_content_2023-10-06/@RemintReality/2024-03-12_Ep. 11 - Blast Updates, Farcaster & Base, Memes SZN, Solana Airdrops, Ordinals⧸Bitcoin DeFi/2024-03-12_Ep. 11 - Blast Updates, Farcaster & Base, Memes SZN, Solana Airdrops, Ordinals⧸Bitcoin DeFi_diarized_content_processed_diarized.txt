00:00:06.120 - 00:00:07.566, Speaker A: Does this work for elevator music?
00:00:07.630 - 00:00:10.262, Speaker B: Dalton, so much better.
00:00:10.398 - 00:00:22.874, Speaker A: So much better than the spaces music. Oh, my God. Okay. Retweeting this. Drop it in some chat.
00:00:39.794 - 00:00:42.770, Speaker B: Dude, where are the nails at? I can't find the nails.
00:00:42.962 - 00:00:57.222, Speaker A: The emoji. In case you guys are wondering what we're doing, we're waiting for Dalton to get his nail emoji out. Dalton, does this mean the next time we hang out in person, I get to, like, paint your nails or something?
00:00:57.358 - 00:00:58.974, Speaker B: Go ahead. That's fine by me.
00:00:59.054 - 00:01:00.314, Speaker A: Let's fucking go.
00:01:00.654 - 00:01:03.302, Speaker B: Ali braided my hair the other night. She's like, oh, my God.
00:01:03.358 - 00:01:06.510, Speaker A: And you're all like, I'll take it.
00:01:06.622 - 00:01:09.914, Speaker B: Honestly, I would love to braid my hair, but I just don't know how to do it.
00:01:10.494 - 00:01:19.742, Speaker A: No, she'll teach you. You'll need to learn. All right. Shall we kick it off?
00:01:19.878 - 00:01:20.942, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:01:21.118 - 00:01:33.302, Speaker A: Let's do it. All right. There it is. Hey, guys. Welcome to episode eleven of Remit reality. I'm Jen.
00:01:33.438 - 00:01:34.594, Speaker B: And I'm Dalton.
00:01:35.334 - 00:01:42.510, Speaker A: Good to see you guys. I know last week we missed because Dalton wasn't feeling too well. Dalton, are you feeling a little bit better today, bro?
00:01:42.542 - 00:02:17.350, Speaker B: I feel so much better. I feel so much better. I live in Mexico City, and I got hit with the worst food sickness I think I ever have had in my life. So it was probably good timing because I was pushing myself so much, like, with the blast stuff, and I was just putting on so much content, and it's the only thing I could think about for multiple days on end. And then I got smacked by food sickness, and then I had, like, the flu right after it. So I don't know if it was, like, a neurovirus and then I got sick or if it was just. I don't know.
00:02:17.350 - 00:02:18.554, Speaker B: Dude. It was atrocious.
00:02:19.894 - 00:02:28.646, Speaker A: I know. I'm glad you're feeling better. It was, like, a little weird, like, going throughout last week and not, like, dming you, like, the entire day, but.
00:02:28.750 - 00:02:41.154, Speaker B: I literally couldn't even get out of my bed. I wasn't checking my phone. I was, like, so detached from crypto. So my advice for this week is going to be, like, very unhinged. And I haven't been paying attention to crypto Twitter, so, actually, probably a good thing.
00:02:42.044 - 00:02:59.660, Speaker A: Dalton's like, go touch grass. Don't get food poisoning, and we'll go from there. Well, you. You missed some stuff. I think we'll kick it off with market news. The big one is bored. Apes floors continues to go down.
00:02:59.660 - 00:03:04.252, Speaker A: I think I was looking at blur it's at like 15 e right now.
00:03:04.348 - 00:03:05.464, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:06.324 - 00:03:22.528, Speaker A: How so? Obviously, board apes have been declining for a minute. We've talked about this on the show before. You know, lenders are pulling support. Blair farmers are also pulling bids. Like, what are your hot takes, if you have any around? What we're seeing, dude.
00:03:22.576 - 00:03:45.670, Speaker B: So I think this kind of comes back to the thing that we've consistently talked about on the show. Gas prices suck. I know Sam NfT stats and I kind of go back and forth on this stuff and he's like, dude, gas prices have nothing to do with the decline of nfts. And I'm like, maybe not, but like, also maybe. I think, like, you touched on blur farmers kind of taking their bids out. I saw earlier it was like at 14.14 for bids.
00:03:45.670 - 00:03:50.470, Speaker B: And that's just like, ooh, dude, it's getting. It's getting to the point where you're just like, okay.
00:03:50.502 - 00:03:54.446, Speaker A: Like, I mean, the top bid is 14.86 now.
00:03:54.470 - 00:03:55.134, Speaker B: It is.
00:03:55.294 - 00:03:56.070, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:56.142 - 00:04:04.464, Speaker B: Like, like, how does that. Okay. How do you feel about blue chip nfts at this point? On ETH? On ETH?
00:04:07.164 - 00:04:48.774, Speaker A: It's tough because I feel like attention is elsewhere for so many things. And if your collection isn't kind of like starting to integrate with some defi protocols or offering something more beyond just being, like, a community member, it's really hard. And I think one of the things that I've always struggled with bored apes is like, I don't see the clear vision. We've talked about this quite a bit. Like, when there's a clear vision for a project, it's very easy for me to be like, yeah, like fudgy penguins, I think will remain blue chip, will continue to get even bluer. Same thing with Azuki. I think they're starting to be like, oh, blast integrations.
00:04:48.774 - 00:05:04.278, Speaker A: Oh, how can we, like, do more with our community and holders while we build out this anime IP, I think is really interesting. But I think the blue chips that were blue chips last cycle may not be blue chips this cycle. And I think that's for a majority of them.
00:05:04.406 - 00:05:39.540, Speaker B: So you remember the show that your wifi kept going in and out. I touched on this and it was one of the things where I was just, like, riffing by myself and I'm like, so. But it kind of reminds me nfts remind me of, like, the old days within crypto. So if you look at, like the. You have like the top ten, right? And so then you have the top ten of crypto was like, bitcoin and nine other, like, shit projects. And then two years later, it was like, bitcoin and ETH, and then a whole bunch of shit projects, and then it was like, bitcoin, ETH, and ripple, and then, like, a whole bunch and ripple. Like, okay, whatever it is as well.
00:05:39.540 - 00:06:38.462, Speaker B: But, like, every, every year, like, the top ten would change. And I think, like, what we saw was like, okay, punks and then punks and squiggs and punks and squigs and apes, then punk squids, apes and azuki. And now, like, we're going to start seeing these things kind of start getting taken away and, like, things that are going to come in next cycle that are going to be more interesting, whether that be, like, deep in, like, decentralized physical stuff, or we're talking about AI or, like, layer two blockchains, or what does the layer three blockchain look like? Or what does bitcoin defi look like? So I think, like, that it's getting more and more competitive and it's getting harder to stay in, like, the top ten nfts, and that kind of leads to, like, boring apes in the decline recently. I think that there's going to be a lot of. They've shown their cards, they pulled out stuff, and they're like, okay, like, here we got ape token, and we got mutants and board, ape kennel club. And now they're like, we bought proof. And it's like, that, ain't it, bro?
00:06:38.638 - 00:07:04.452, Speaker A: I think it's like, the big thing is like, oh, we have other side gaming and this metaverse. And I think they're kind of funneling, from what I saw, even with the proof acquisition, they're funneling a lot of that into other side of like, oh, having, I think, grails and oddities now available on other side. I don't know, it's just like, I think you guys turning into a big gaming project. Like, beyond that. Like, I don't really know how else to describe it.
00:07:04.548 - 00:07:19.154, Speaker B: No, my question for you, I wrote this in the show notes because it's like, okay, so I'm like an anarchist at heart, right? I'm just like, let's see it, bro. Let's see this shit go down. When do apes flip node monkeys or no, when no monkeys flip apes.
00:07:19.814 - 00:07:36.726, Speaker A: I think we will see ordinal nfts, probably like node monkeys, quantum cats. I could see that. Flipping apes by quarter two, quarter three of this year after happening. Damn, you're right. Do you think lion?
00:07:36.830 - 00:07:42.154, Speaker B: No, no, I. So you're saying node monkeys flip apes.
00:07:42.474 - 00:08:09.908, Speaker A: I think most, because, like, the way I'm thinking about it is as people make money, they're going to cycle into bitcoin, whether that's ordinals, bitcoin, defi BRC, twenties, et cetera. And I think bitcoin just continues to pump. And I think if apes continue to, like, go down and we see a sub ten ETH floor, I think it'll be very easy for leading ordinal collections to flip apes.
00:08:10.036 - 00:08:11.584, Speaker B: Do puppets flip apes?
00:08:13.804 - 00:08:19.604, Speaker A: This is where I'm not as, like, ingrained into the ordinals. You are.
00:08:19.644 - 00:08:20.388, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:08:20.556 - 00:08:22.052, Speaker A: Do you think puppets flip apes?
00:08:22.108 - 00:08:35.284, Speaker B: If puppets. If puppets flip apes, I. Dude, I would be on my timeline, I'd be losing shit. I think that'd be hilarious because, like, all the apes are like. And I'm just like, dude, they're such boomers, dude. I'm like, this is not. I would love to see it.
00:08:35.284 - 00:08:36.524, Speaker B: I think it'd be hilarious.
00:08:36.684 - 00:08:49.344, Speaker A: When you, when we were talking about the, like, top ten blue chip Nft collections, how much of that do you see being ETH nfts versus ordinals versus sol nfts?
00:08:50.284 - 00:09:31.316, Speaker B: I think omni chain future is here, right? Like, I think that that's, that's going to continue to push. Like, you're seeing mad lads, mad labs for right now is like twenty six k. I think tentorians will bounce back. Then on bitcoin, you have all the ordinals collections that are doing well. I think the only saving grace for ETH nfts would be if they bridge to blast, they need, they need to get off ETH mainnet to, like, induce more trading, or at least be exciting. But then that, then that question becomes like, do you have blast native collections that do well, like blast opiens? And like, I'm not saying blastopians flip apes. Like, I'm not saying that by any means.
00:09:31.316 - 00:09:55.354, Speaker B: Yeah, but I'm saying, like, it's. If there was more trading going on, or if there was like, incentivized trading going on, on blast for ETH, like raft ETH nfts, I think that would be interesting and that might be able to save prices. I think the only, the only collection that I could see kind of really leaning into that would be like something like d gods, you know, like somebody that really doesn't give a fuck. And they're like, oh, fuck it.
00:09:55.774 - 00:10:07.880, Speaker A: I. So I think any collection that's big on being like, royalty enforced, I think we might not necessarily see come to blast. I think they're gonna.
00:10:07.912 - 00:10:13.496, Speaker B: You get. Yuga's already fucked, bro. Like, yuga's fucked. They've, like, shot themselves in the foot.
00:10:13.640 - 00:10:20.328, Speaker A: Okay. But we do know that blur is coming to blast in April. So next month we see that.
00:10:20.496 - 00:10:24.400, Speaker B: I think when. When ethnft is on blast, I think.
00:10:24.432 - 00:10:47.012, Speaker A: Before April, I think. I think I might have talked to a team or two here and there that might be working on porting some of it over again. 100%. 100%. Okay, well, speaking of blast. And I guess we can use blast nfts to segue into this. Beyond blastopians.
00:10:47.012 - 00:10:50.624, Speaker A: Are there any other blast nfts that you've seen that excite you?
00:10:52.904 - 00:11:05.392, Speaker B: Like, noob, newblast city is one of those that, like, they're. They're like, a second contender. Right. But I think this space is just so small. Like, I use mintify today, which is, like, a decent platform. Right. But, like, this is not.
00:11:05.392 - 00:11:22.104, Speaker B: I don't really get excited to use it. I think the most exciting part of all of blast is, like, the hyper financialization, and that will come with time. Right? Like, hardcore nft fi. NfT perps lending and things like that. Like, and we're just not there yet. So what about yourself?
00:11:22.764 - 00:12:01.224, Speaker A: I have two blastopians that I'm staking. I think I'm like you, though. Like, if I were to divide up my attention, like, 75% of my attention time effort and, like, just capital is going more into, like, the DeFi platforms. I think there's just greater, like, ev there in terms of blast points getting airdropped. Blast gold getting airdropped. But it's interesting because I think, like, you know, weeks ago, we were saying that we were anticipating seeing more meme activity as well as NFT activity leading up to May. But I feel like that's been slowed down.
00:12:01.224 - 00:12:29.542, Speaker A: And obviously I see, like, bearish takes or mid curve takes on blast across the timeline. But I just feel like people are forgetting that, you know, we're, like, a little over a week into blast being live and, like, yeah, teams are. I keep tweeting this, but it's like, dude, teams are literally still deploying. They're still deploying features. They're still deploying, like, cross integrations with each other. Like, it's not even. The ecosystem is, like, literally being birthed still.
00:12:29.678 - 00:13:09.422, Speaker B: Right, right. Well, and that's something I wanted to double click on. So blast points and blast gold, I think, are really interesting, and I want you to break those both down. That said, like, I also want to double click on the fact that, like, you said we're a week into this, so first things first, we're going to be going into blast and like a blast update and like, really giving you, like, the things that we're looking at and all of that kind of stuff, whether it be meme coins, nfts, whatever the case, but to anybody that says, ah, there's nothing going on on blast, dude, block them, don't, like, unfollow them, don't pay attention to them. Like, it's just one of the things that if you were paying attention to base six months ago, there's nothing. There's, there's nothing like, yeah, there were tokens. It was completely dead.
00:13:09.422 - 00:13:40.106, Speaker B: Warpcast was like, like, you know, like, there was no traction across the entire ecosystem. And so if you ask somebody, oh, what's on base? They're like, well, fuck base. Like, look at Coinbase NFt. And I'm like, dude, Coinbase, what a frickin mid, like, mid curve take, right? Same, same is going to happen. So, like, make sure you're paying attention to the meme coins. Make sure you're following the videos and the content that we're putting out with that kind of stuff. Because, like, for the next couple months until May comes around, this is the only thing I'm really focused on with ordinals as well.
00:13:40.106 - 00:14:16.906, Speaker B: I think ordinals is interesting. It's a lot of nfts and things like that, but like, 80% of my mind share is going towards making sure I don't have leaky exposure towards blast, like, meme coins. Make sure you're scooping at least a little bit. Like, having an allocation of your portfolio being like, all right, you think pac man's going to fuck this up? You think the best teams in ETH NFT fight are going to fuck this up? They're like, everybody's porting shit over and like, you're going to tell me that the smartest people in the space are not getting this right? Like, don't mid curve it. Just make sure that you take some time, learn some shit and port over some money.
00:14:17.050 - 00:14:39.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, well, to, you know, stay on your soapbox for a second because this is what I think of, remember, like, what was it, November, December of last year? So literally, just a few months ago, the judo drop you if you staked one soul, literally one soul at that time, like, soul was still like, what, $20?
00:14:40.574 - 00:14:41.614, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:41.654 - 00:15:37.662, Speaker A: If you had just staked one, you got a $10,000 airdrop. And I think, like, that just goes to show that like, being early in an ecosystem is not a bad thing. And when others are saying, oh, it's dead, it's awful. It's the time to actually, like, lean in and pay attention 100%. You know, the way I'm thinking about this is okay, that's fine if majority of my timeline wants to, like, you know, have mid takes or bad takes on blast, whatever. But I know in the next six months, once that first blast airdrop comes in May, people are going to be rushing in being like, oh my God, wait, jen, you got like a $10,000 airdrop with how much initial capital? And it's like less competition for you to have to compete against in terms of, like, you know, how much TvL you're deploying. So I think with that said, I'll break down blast gold versus blast points real quick.
00:15:37.758 - 00:15:38.078, Speaker B: Cool.
00:15:38.126 - 00:16:29.876, Speaker A: So everyone on blast users and apps are receiving blast points. Blast points is directly correlated to your TVL. So how much money you deposit in, whether it's just sitting in your wallet or whether it's like sitting in a liquidity pool on a protocol. And then majority of blast developers, I don't think I've come across one dev team on Blast that hasn't committed to basically allocating their entire dev allocation from blast of both points and gold to their users. So, like, that's where blast points comes in. It's the easiest thing to earn. You just get it from having capital on the layer two where I think this gets really interesting and where it's really going to come down to, like, what kind of protocol are you, you know, interacting with is blast gold.
00:16:29.876 - 00:16:59.568, Speaker A: So blast gold is basically the way the blast l two team is rewarding dev teams based off of traction and on chain metrics. So I start to think about what matters more. Is it the number of transactions that I'm pushing through? Is it my total volume that I end up pushing through? Like, how frequently am I interacting with the DAP? Like, just like, I'm starting to think of like, vanity metrics that I was.
00:16:59.576 - 00:17:01.616, Speaker B: Gonna say, yeah, vanity metrics, yeah.
00:17:01.680 - 00:17:34.932, Speaker A: And you have to start thinking about the vanity metrics for every different type of platform. Like, I feel like for spot dexs, it's going to be number of transactions, total volume. I think for lending, it's going to be, you know, TVL and things like that. I think, like, TVL, but I also think, like, how much debt is open on the platform. Like, I think, like, when we look at NFT finance on ETH, for example, like, we're the TVL is a little irrelevant when we're looking at those platforms. It's like, what is your total outstanding debt?
00:17:35.028 - 00:17:43.552, Speaker B: Or the amount of loans? Maybe it's the amount of loans that you've taken out and successfully repaid. I know that's something, like, on Sharky fi, that over on Seoul, that's something that was very important.
00:17:43.708 - 00:18:06.896, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, these are the things that I'm starting to think about, because, like, as I've talked to more dev teams, one thing has become really clear. I think even they're not totally sure how blast gold is going to be distributed. So, um, I'm hoping to get some clarity on the blast AMA on Wednesday. We'll see. And then I think I will, uh, hopefully have some updates for you guys in the form of a video.
00:18:07.080 - 00:18:29.644, Speaker B: Well, and so I. I think kind of playing along with this is, like, the idea of the vanity metrics, right? So this is something that we've chatted on so many times, is before blast was even live, blast was a multiseg. Right. There's nothing, nothing special. There's no l two. There's no dapps built on top of it. There's, like, this big bang competition that was really important.
00:18:29.644 - 00:19:00.446, Speaker B: And now we're at this phase where it's like, okay, blast is competing with arbitrum. Arbitrum, optimism, ZK sync, polygon. Like those kind of, like, plays, right? Like they're battling with the big boys. They're not battling with Opensea that doesn't even know how to put out a token. You know, like, it's. These teams are gonna go, like, PvP. And I think that as that continues to get more, like, magnified, it's gonna become interesting how.
00:19:00.446 - 00:19:42.354, Speaker B: How you can kind of integrate with multiple platforms. And we've talked about this. There's so many different loops that exist. Like meta street, wasabi mangrove, this, that the other, like, juice, this loop, and then that loop, and then this. Like, it's just gonna be a thing, right? And I think that as. As it continues to evolve and like Jen said, like, you're going to see the first big airdrop, and it's going to be like a cheeto, like, airdrop, because nobody was fucking paying attention because everybody's over here saying, like, there's nothing going on on blast, don't listen, because there is. And there's a bunch of different teams that are putting a bunch of stuff out, and now there is a lot of locked liquidity, and they will use this as a segue to get into, like, the USD announcement and stuff.
00:19:42.354 - 00:19:53.758, Speaker B: But there's a lot of people that are just sitting on their hands and not doing anything and just collecting the percentage APR that they can. Because blast is super hyper financialized. Right?
00:19:53.926 - 00:20:32.024, Speaker A: Yeah. But I also think, like, this is where it's like, if you just want to sit and collect the APR, like, I would look at some lending protocols. Like, I think right now Wasabi has 20% apy on USDB. So that's 15% on top of like 6% Wasabi yield for depositing. I want to talk about the USDB yield increase, but I did want to just like, bring up this comment that is, sorry, ESL moment. Is it chunk? It's chunk, right? I was going to say shock. And I was like, that's not.
00:20:32.024 - 00:21:11.564, Speaker A: Not okay. So Chuck brings up this really good point. The thing about blast gold is it is weighed heavier than blast points. And so if you have a little bit of capital, I'm sorry, but if you have a little bit of capital, like me, I'm very capitally constrained. So I am thinking it goes back to, like, the vanity metrics of each app. Like, how can I push the most transactions and the most volume? This isn't the best example, but I thought this was really fascinating. So yolo games, which is a gamble fi project, I went on to Yolo games with, I think, like 0.2
00:21:11.564 - 00:21:35.306, Speaker A: ETH, and I was just fucking around on all of the games. Within a night, Dalton, I pushed maybe five ETH worth of volume, and I didn't lose any money. I won some, and then I lost everything that I won. But it was just like, it was like, I was like, holy shit, this is crazy. I've been on here for like, maybe 2 hours, and I've like, pushed five ETH worth of volume from like .2.
00:21:35.410 - 00:21:37.594, Speaker B: E. And that was on yolo games.
00:21:37.714 - 00:21:40.562, Speaker A: It was on yolo games playing moon or doom.
00:21:40.658 - 00:21:42.034, Speaker B: Bro, why are you like this?
00:21:42.154 - 00:21:42.626, Speaker A: Why would.
00:21:42.650 - 00:21:45.890, Speaker B: You're such a dj? And it freaking kills me.
00:21:45.922 - 00:21:49.202, Speaker A: You're like, yeah, I gotta keep up with you.
00:21:49.258 - 00:22:07.680, Speaker B: So Dalton, I found out about leverage trading and I'm like, oh, fuck. And you're like, so I put a 20 x lev long on Jup at $0.49. Shit's gonna go up only. And then you close it. And then I was just like, oh, my God, now she's in gamble by. Now she's in gamble by.
00:22:07.792 - 00:22:13.440, Speaker A: I do. I do have a five x leverage long open on ETH on Wasabi right now.
00:22:13.512 - 00:22:17.884, Speaker B: And that this, this right here, this is exactly what I'm talking about, bro.
00:22:18.224 - 00:23:08.530, Speaker A: It isn't. I was just finding out, okay? Like, let's let me live my life go off, okay, so let's. This is actually really fascinating to me. And if there's anyone that's watching that knows Makerdao maybe a little bit more intimately than I do and wants to chime in, feel free to chime in. So basically, before we knew that if we had USD be blasting the blast stable coin, we were earning 5% in yield passively through makerdao and, like, their t bills. And basically that little nice little integration that they have here. Well, this morning, Makerdao basically changed their, I think it's their DSR and their stability rate.
00:23:08.530 - 00:23:58.444, Speaker A: And their stability rate is basically your borrow interest to borrow, Daisy. So the way maker works is like, you go, you deposit ETH, you deposit wrapped bitcoin, you deposit all these cryptocurrencies, and then you're able to borrow up to 60%, 66% of that crypto's value in Dai, in stablecoin. And Dai is backed by the collateral that you put in, as well as like, some experimentation around rwas and things like tokenized t bills. And so basically, makerdao increases this rate to protect against bullish sentiment and supply demand. Like, they're worried about a supply demand shock basically happening. Dalton, are you following me so far?
00:23:59.464 - 00:24:00.320, Speaker B: Yes.
00:24:00.512 - 00:24:38.758, Speaker A: You're like, kind of. Well, so it's like, it's basically a precautionary measure that maker Dow did, because they're all like, fuck people. People are borrowing a lot. We need to incentivize people to start paying back, and we need to start seeing, like, the borrowing of Dai go down. And it's because everyone's bullish and everyone's like, basically trying to leverage long all these fucking cryptocurrencies. And so that's about how far I am into understanding it. I'm talking to a few folks who are smarter than me to help me break it down, because my question was, is this sustainable? Do we see a revert back to five, 5% yield in the next month or two? Like, how.
00:24:38.758 - 00:24:45.398, Speaker A: How long can we expect to passively earn 15% yield? And then I was talking to David from meta.
00:24:45.446 - 00:24:48.086, Speaker B: I was going to say it had to have been David from Meta street, bro.
00:24:48.150 - 00:25:27.822, Speaker A: Well, talking to David from Meta Street, I hit up smack too, from compound vc. But David was telling me, he was like, credit markets are dead for crypto. Like, all of the institutions, if they want to borrow to leverage, they're going to have to go through makerdao to do this? And so he's like, we can probably expect to see these rates for a while. Yeah. But now it's like, it's a two. It's a double edged sword, because on one hand it's like, great, I'm a depositor and I'm depositing into a lending pool. I'm going to earn a ridiculous amount of apy on stable coins.
00:25:27.822 - 00:25:54.614, Speaker A: But now the part that I'm trying to wrap my head around is, if I'm a borrower and, and I'm borrowing USDB, am I technically incurring, like, debt at the 15% native yield on top of whatever my borrow interest is? And I think that might be something that's platform by platform. But do you. But now that this number is so big, I'm like, how does this exactly work so well?
00:25:54.774 - 00:26:31.364, Speaker B: I feel like to kind of touch on some of the stuff that we've seen in nfts and stuff like that, right? We have seen mass liquidations happen. And, like, when people continuously borrow stuff, like, if this is your first cycle, even your second cycle, like, you will see 60% drawbacks. And that's just normal. Like, like, you're gonna, like, right now we're in up only times, and people are like, fuck, yeah, we're going straight up. I'm like, dude, watch a meme coin chart for fucking five minutes, dude. Like, it is not for the faint of heart. And so, like, be careful when you're borrowing, because, like, it.
00:26:31.364 - 00:26:42.884, Speaker B: The game is incentivized to play the game, right, but the game is also incentivized to, like, make wipe you out, and then somebody takes your money. So, like, that's just my point.
00:26:44.104 - 00:27:31.920, Speaker A: And be careful. Again, like, literally, I think be careful is one. But also, if you are looking at these lending platforms to do, like, leveraged longs or even like, these perp Dex platforms, like, really make sure you understand. One, if you're borrowing from a pool, at what rate are you borrowing? Two, what is your liquidation point? Like, Guice is, I think, one of the more popular lending platforms right now on blast, and you could basically deposit one ETH and borrow up to 300% LTV in USDB. But it's kind of like, if you were going about de jetting responsibly, it's like, why would you borrow up to 300% LTV? Because if the price of ETH drops, you're fucked.
00:27:31.992 - 00:27:55.840, Speaker B: Like, because I'm right, bro. Yeah. In terms of, like, this stuff being, like, peer to peer slash peer to pool and like, what are the payment structure? Like, the repayment structures? Are you repaying? Like, is there a time based repayment or does it just depend platform by platform?
00:27:55.952 - 00:28:04.312, Speaker A: I think it depends platform by platform. Like, juice is repay whenever, basically don't get liquidated as long as you repay your debt.
00:28:04.368 - 00:28:07.496, Speaker B: So here's 300% LTV. And just don't lose it.
00:28:07.600 - 00:28:35.384, Speaker A: Yeah, just don't lose it. And you're fine. I did. I opened that long on Wasabi and I think that's also open and I can repay that whatever. Like, I'll just pay it whenever I actually close the position is how it works, and I think they take it out of either your profit or your down payment. So it depends platform by platform. I think the TLDR here is just like, Degen responsibly, leverage responsibly.
00:28:35.384 - 00:28:41.224, Speaker A: And nothing that Dalton and I say is financial advice, so do not take it as financial advice.
00:28:41.764 - 00:29:01.580, Speaker B: Well, to get into more fun stuff that you will not lose your leverage on. I'm just kidding. Like, don't buy meme coins. But I do want to talk about other projects that are building on blast and, like, other things that we're paying attention to. Have you gotten the chance to mess with fantasy yet? I know. I've been, like, talking to you about you about it.
00:29:01.612 - 00:29:01.996, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:02.100 - 00:29:15.456, Speaker B: But let me pull this up. Would like to record. Yes. I don't know how to do that. I just got a new computer, guys, and I'm, like, extremely excited about it, but now I'm, like, trying to figure.
00:29:15.480 - 00:29:19.696, Speaker A: Out how to share my screen, y'all, did you enable permissions? There it is.
00:29:19.720 - 00:29:35.768, Speaker B: There we go. Okay, so this is fantasy. Fantasy is a social fi platform. There's mainnet has not been announced. We don't know when it's coming. As you can see. Like, this is, like, something that I've been actively shilling because, like, I think it's.
00:29:35.768 - 00:30:05.182, Speaker B: It's probably one of my favorite platforms and projects that is being built on blast right now. Basic overview is, like, Twitter analytics, and then these people end up getting, like, a fan score. And then the fan score basically gives you, like, you have your five by five team or your five by five team right here. Look at that. I got CBB, bro, and bold. Leonidas and Alex, Tom Schmidt and zoo, bro. I was like, yeah, this is, this is like a dream team.
00:30:05.182 - 00:30:31.286, Speaker B: Five decide. Um, so basically, you get all these different cards, right? And I've just been buying, like, as you can see up top, I have, like, almost three ETH worth of stuff. And this is test net ETH. This is not real ETH. Um, but, yeah, like, you can buy packs and, like, marketplace tournament, and then, like, you just kind of go ham here and just, like, see who has the best five aside team that has the highest performing analytics on. On Twitter. I'm obsessed with it.
00:30:31.430 - 00:30:41.814, Speaker A: I love this because you get to, like, speculate on something kind of fun, but I think it also forces you to pay attention to, like, who are people paying attention to? And I think that's, like, a read into culture.
00:30:41.934 - 00:31:03.762, Speaker B: Well, and that's. I think that's the most kind of interesting part of all of this is, like, this is not like you're speculating on who the cabal is. Like, oh, is the cabal going to buy this coin or that coin? It's not that. It's like, is this dude gonna. This dude is really heavily invested in this and that. I think that thing goes up, and if that thing goes up, then that means people are gonna be paying attention to it or something like that. Like.
00:31:03.762 - 00:31:38.222, Speaker B: Or, for instance, like, sammy, for instance, who's, like, an influencer, right? Like, sammy always hits timely news on things. Like, what if Sammy has, like, a huge thread that comes out and then Elon musk tweets about it? Like, then all of a sudden, you get what I'm saying? Like, it's speculation, but it's, like, speculation that we all spending so much time on Twitter. Like, I think it's just so interesting. And, like, imagine telling your friends, you're like, bro, I'm gonna buy this. This legendary card for, like, tennis. And they're like, why? And it's like, yeah, because I think this guy's gonna talk about this thing that's gonna be really popular next week, and he's got. He's gonna leave my five side team.
00:31:38.222 - 00:31:45.166, Speaker B: I'm like, bro, that's so cool. Like, that's such a crypto niche thing, and I don't know. I think it's fucking cool.
00:31:45.230 - 00:31:49.250, Speaker A: So did you ever play, like, fantasy football and, like, all of that stuff?
00:31:49.382 - 00:31:52.506, Speaker B: No, I played actually, like, okay, okay.
00:31:52.570 - 00:31:59.574, Speaker A: All right. Mister athlete over there. For those of you guys who don't know, Dalton actually does come from, like, a pro athletics background.
00:32:01.194 - 00:32:25.448, Speaker B: I played so fantasy footy, like, soccer. I did, because, like, that was always, like, fun, but I could never really pay attention to it because I was always just more interested in, like, myself training and stuff. What else? I. Yeah. But I do think this is, like, something fun for us to speculate on in a way that's like. And I don't know. It's very crypto niche, so it's pretty cool.
00:32:25.616 - 00:32:43.432, Speaker A: I. I'm excited to see what happens once they go on to mainnet. And if we're going to see a little bit of, like, a rush that we did with front tech keys in terms of, like, trying to buy cards and because, like, my biggest thing with fantasy is, like, how fast am I going to be priced out of, like, being able to competitively do this?
00:32:43.568 - 00:32:57.616, Speaker B: I'm probably gonna throw, like, ten ETH over there. That's like, that's my plan. That's your plan? I think I'm gonna buy, like, the best cards that I can with my first ten e. Or I'm just gonna, like, spin the wheel and, like, buy packs. And I see if I get some, like, legendary shit.
00:32:57.800 - 00:32:58.848, Speaker A: Rip some packs.
00:32:58.936 - 00:33:17.532, Speaker B: I'm gonna rip some packs. But, like, that, even that, I think is cool. It's like, because I did. I was never into, like, pokemon or anything like that. Like, I just, it was not for me, but like, that, that rush, like, the nostalgia of, like, again, I never did it, but, like, it sounded cool. Like pack opening and shit. I'm like, I think it could be a thing.
00:33:17.532 - 00:33:45.564, Speaker B: So outside of fantasy, like I said earlier, like, pay attention to what's been going on. Let me show you. Also, anybody that was showing this also unfollow them because everybody knew, oh, God, dude, 36% supply was going to influencers. So, like, anybody that was showing this, like, you should probably unfollow too. But that's besides the point.
00:33:45.724 - 00:34:34.225, Speaker A: This is where. So before blast went live, I made a little video because I knew people would be degenering, including myself. I got fucked on some meme coins, not only on blast, but on ethnic ansel. Like, I've had a rough week trading. It's just been bad. But it was like one of those things that, like, part of your diligence should be, did the team do a pre sale? If they did do a pre sale, how much? Like, how much was set away? And the moment that, you know, you and I talked about this quite a bit in DM's, like, the moment that we saw 36% pre sale, it was like, we knew it was going to be pump, pump, pump, and then just like immediately dump. Because all pre salers are going to want out of that capital to go somewhere.
00:34:34.329 - 00:34:36.585, Speaker B: Can you explain to people what a presale is?
00:34:36.769 - 00:34:53.777, Speaker A: Yeah. So there are different forms and levels of pre sales, but generally it's going to be, hey, you send me one ETH and you're going to get this token that I'm launching at 1.5 million market cap.
00:34:53.865 - 00:35:00.153, Speaker B: You heard it here first. This is 100% free sale.
00:35:01.213 - 00:35:37.228, Speaker A: Yeah. One ETH per for an allocation. But basically you are doing the pre sale because your ETH usually ends up seeding the liquidity and you get paid a good chunk of tokens. Like, typically the people that win the most on meme coins are going to be either the pre sellers or the people who are able to snap, snipe, and basically buy in on that first candle on the way up. So it's something to look out for. And I think this is why I'm excited for coins like Pac Moon. Pacmoon, I think is another big meme coin.
00:35:37.228 - 00:35:57.318, Speaker A: And they're doing their first airdrop on Wednesday. So I think the chart trading should also be live on Wednesday. But I actually, I have. I really like the Pacmoon team. Like, I really am excited about Pacmoon. I love how it doesn't seem like they're really doing any pre sale of any sort. And it's kind of going to be all community driven.
00:35:57.318 - 00:36:33.038, Speaker A: But I now also, I don't know if this is a mid curve take, but it's like, I've seen hype meme coin launches before. Like, I was here last cycle, and it is a 50 50 gamble. It either does really, really well and, like, just skyrockets and everyone's, like, in absolute awe or something happens. And if even one thing gets, like, kind of fucked up upon, like, launch or delivery, it just takes the chart because there's so much hype around it. It wasn't able to live up to the hype. Like, how are you feeling about that?
00:36:33.166 - 00:37:03.396, Speaker B: So I would say that for me right now, the main things that I'm paying attention to are, like I said, meme coins and those kind of things, like, real project tokens haven't really launched yet. So, like, there's nothing really to speculate on there. That being said, if you're paying attention to, like, some of these other meme coins, like, this is Mia right here. Mia is sitting at, like 12 million market cap. Looks healthy. Like, it doesn't look like I'm scared of this thing. Like, definitely could tank because nobody's really buying anything over here.
00:37:03.396 - 00:37:21.388, Speaker B: Like, volume has just, like, disappeared. What's volume daily? 500,000. So, like, it's not too bad. And then I'm also looking at Baja with, which is, like, another proven team over there. So, like, again, sitting at 3.29 million. So, like, those two plays.
00:37:21.388 - 00:37:57.126, Speaker B: Basically, I'm in both of those and I'm like, yo, if. If blast gets momentum, these two teams are going to see action because there's just no other projects over there, right? Like, there's also. Yes. Which I'm sure you could speak on a little bit more than I can, but, like, those three tokens are, like, the really only Djenny ones that are kind of over there with. With solid teams. That being said, like, I think we are going to see. We are going to see Pacman launch, right? And, like, you touched on, bro, hyped.
00:37:57.126 - 00:38:29.328, Speaker B: Hyped mints, hype meme coins. Like, it's hard to hype something that, like, why does it exist? Like, there? And this is kind of very unique to blast because, like, people were coming out with meme coins before blast even existed. Is this funny? No. Is it supposed to be the community coin? Yes, but, like, unlike bonk, when, like, the community, like, the bonk community kind of rallied around that. That came out at $8 when nobody, like, everybody's like, fuck, solana, it's going to zero. Everybody get out while you can. And then bonk came out.
00:38:29.328 - 00:38:42.524, Speaker B: So, like, this isn't saving us and it's not necessarily making people a bunch of money. Like, it's. It's going to be a community airdrop. But I'll be interested to see how big that community airdrop is. And I believe if the tokenomics came.
00:38:42.564 - 00:38:45.984, Speaker A: Out right, it's like, I don't think so, actually.
00:38:46.604 - 00:39:16.314, Speaker B: I think they did. But, like, there is a big chunk of token that's going to the community airdrop. And so, like, if you think about that, the main takeaways for me are going to be like, how much liquidity is there? How many. How many people are selling this? Like, because over on blasters? No, there's no gas fees and people can sell whatever the fuck they want. Like, if they have $5, like, how much is it? I'm looking doesn't say treasury.
00:39:18.494 - 00:39:19.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:20.174 - 00:39:46.690, Speaker B: So say it's like 50% or whatever the case may be. Right? Like, bro, that's a lot of sell pressure. It's a lot of sell pressure that people are going to have to swallow up. So I don't know. Will I be buying it? Yes. Will it be with money that I care about? Probably not. Like, I'm going to hope to ape it and be early, like Jen was saying, and if you aren't early, don't fomo the first candle.
00:39:46.690 - 00:39:52.414, Speaker B: Like, it will come back. Everybody's going to sell it. Just buy the first major dip and then go from there.
00:39:53.034 - 00:39:57.986, Speaker A: Dcan on, like, anything that's super duper hyped.
00:39:58.010 - 00:39:58.199, Speaker B: If you.
00:39:58.199 - 00:40:03.048, Speaker A: If you're not able to snipe or buy early, you just DCA in.
00:40:03.216 - 00:40:06.404, Speaker B: What. What would be your top price to buy at you personally?
00:40:06.704 - 00:40:08.524, Speaker A: Pack if it came out?
00:40:09.784 - 00:40:12.444, Speaker B: Are you buying? Are you a buyer under 10 million work?
00:40:13.704 - 00:40:45.892, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I would ideally be more inclined to, like, aggressively pick up anything under 5 million market cap. Cap fair. Like, I think the ecosystem is still so new that, you know, it's not like a coin is launching every day and we're seeing it run to 100 million. So you have to, like, start to think about, like, what is the risk to reward ratio? And it's like, I hate. I'm not gonna lie, I hate buying meme coins over a million dollar market cap 100%.
00:40:45.948 - 00:40:54.876, Speaker B: Bro. This girl. This girl bought pie. Like, 800,000. Market cap might have been even lower than that. She's like, I like the meme. And then I fucking slept on it.
00:40:54.876 - 00:40:55.844, Speaker B: But it is what it is.
00:40:55.884 - 00:41:14.540, Speaker A: Yeah. I thank God I kept my moon bag. Made me feel a little bit better because Popcat pumped to over 200 million and I'm not gonna. There was an episode, guys, that was like, episode three or four, and Dalton was like, hey, jen, how's your pop cat doing? Because it had, like, pumped and then it dumped, and then it, like, okay.
00:41:14.572 - 00:41:22.368, Speaker B: To be fair, I told her to take profit at 40 million market cap. I was like, dude, you did good. Like, you did good, champ. Like, yeah, sell it.
00:41:22.536 - 00:41:23.328, Speaker A: And I did it.
00:41:23.376 - 00:41:25.152, Speaker B: No. And then she decides to sell it.
00:41:25.168 - 00:41:56.184, Speaker A: At the bottom because I was like, jup. Jup's going up. This is just, like, one of those things where if you have conviction in something, keep a bag in there. I'm really glad I kept a little bit of my popcat in there because I'm not gonna lie, I probably would have been buried very depressed if it ran, but geez. Okay, so I am also in Baja. Pac Moon comes out on Wednesday. We'll probably throw some in there.
00:41:56.184 - 00:42:51.106, Speaker A: In terms, like, I know a lot of folks are, like, asking me what I'm farming and how I'm farming. And, like, I know I keep saying this, and it's not to, like, delay videos, but it's just, like, fact that a lot of these apps, again, are still deploying features and they're still deploying integrations. And for me, I'm not a big whale in this space. I have, like, very limited capital that I'm like deploying into these farms. So I'm looking at ways that I can maximize that capital that I am going to deploy. So for some of these things, I am waiting to basically, I'm waiting for them to announce when certain integrations are coming or that certain integrations are live before I deploy my capital there. Because my whole plan is to basically have like three to four core farms and then stack farms on top of that where like, everything is connected to everything and it's all earning points.
00:42:51.106 - 00:43:35.604, Speaker A: So as of right now, I have exposure on all three NFT finance apps on Blast. So that is Wasabi meta street and NFT perp. Metastreet's a Little DIffeReNt BeCaUse you're having to be on ETH main net depositing into their towers and then bridging that over. So that's like one of those that, like, I've set it up, I've bridged them over, but it's going to be a thing where it's like, we need to wait and let the team cook. But for Wasabi, they have been like, on a fucking role, dude. In terms of just like, deploying features out. Let me see if I can just show you guys real quick, BeCause this has been actually pretty fascinating to me.
00:43:35.604 - 00:44:22.290, Speaker A: So Wasabi has vaults that you can deposit, like meta street lcts into, and you can earn yield on that as well as Wasabi points and Wasabi Gold you can deposit in ETH. And it's like this says you're earning lp points, blast points, and then they also have this USDB volt. So I've deposited into all three of these. I've gone ahead and opened up a five x long on ETH and we'll see how that does. But, like, this is really exciting. Like, this is, I'm pretty sure the only app that I've seen that actually has this. And, like, the relief that you feel when you're looking at, like, your blast points.
00:44:22.290 - 00:44:41.124, Speaker A: Like, this is like, definitely a dopamine hit for me every time I, like, come to the app and refresh and there's more stuff there. So, like, it's pretty much where I am with blast. I've explored a little bit more with guice finance and then obviously my d gen things are like Yolo Games and Cambria.
00:44:43.864 - 00:45:31.764, Speaker B: The only other thing I'll add to that in terms of, like, getting involved right now would be this. In terms of, like, nFt exposure, Jen was breaking down what blast gold is. And I think that Blastopians is one of the winners of the Big Bang and they're going to be receiving some of that kickback. There's only 5000 total supply and I definitely swept these early. I was like, okay, I didn't even know there was going to be staking but that's definitely something to stake and just kind of sit back and kind of watch grow. Um, if you go to there, I guess I could connect my wallet, I could do it later. But like if you can see like the amount of points that you're getting and it's just like, dude, points just go up.
00:45:31.764 - 00:45:43.724, Speaker B: Um, so it's one of those things that I think is going to be if and when blast season does come, that's going to be one of the teams to pay attention to. Um, so yeah, definitely.
00:45:43.884 - 00:45:51.094, Speaker A: It's also just an easy way to get blast gold and blast points because we know it's coming because they won big bang.
00:45:52.194 - 00:45:54.094, Speaker B: The excitement's real chunk.
00:45:57.194 - 00:46:08.770, Speaker A: What about Blitz? So I've taken a look at Blitz. This goes back to where I have limited capital that I'm actually able to deploy on Mainnet. Like when I was on testnet, I was on all of it. It was super fun.
00:46:08.922 - 00:46:11.282, Speaker B: Yeah, when I was on Testnet, when.
00:46:11.298 - 00:46:28.646, Speaker A: I was monopoly money messing around with my monopoly money, it was like incredibly fun. But I think I'm gonna see how my leverage longs do on Wasabi and if I'm able to generate more capital then I'll expand to other perps platforms.
00:46:28.710 - 00:46:33.314, Speaker B: But I'm not just keep yellow gaming it.
00:46:33.614 - 00:46:52.754, Speaker A: I know, I'm like, oh, I'm like, I got wrecked with perps off chain and I'm like not totally trying to get. Jesus Christ. At least I'm like really honest about it. Like I am not a great.
00:46:53.414 - 00:46:57.114, Speaker B: I love it so much. You're so honest about it. It cracks me up.
00:46:57.574 - 00:47:01.358, Speaker A: All right, well, okay. I think that's enough of blast.
00:47:01.446 - 00:47:06.946, Speaker B: I know we riffed on it. So anything else you want to touch on before we pivot?
00:47:07.130 - 00:47:09.786, Speaker A: No, no, I think let's take it away to base.
00:47:09.930 - 00:47:31.294, Speaker B: Yeah, so base is definitely something I have been paying more attention to. Um, let me pop up this guy. Oh shit. I got, dude, I got a new computer and it's a latin american keyboard and I keep like dude, that enter button small. There's like an na in there. I'm just like, dude, I don't know what the fuck's going on. So first things first.
00:47:31.294 - 00:47:48.194, Speaker B: Warpcast is something that I think everybody that is listening to this should just get exposure to. It takes a while to really start building. I don't really have very many followers over here at all, I don't think. Yeah, 126. That's something.
00:47:48.654 - 00:48:08.354, Speaker A: Warpcast, for those of you guys who don't know, it's literally if Twitter and Reddit came together and had a decentralized baby, it is actually like even if you abstract all the crypto stuff away from it, it has been a social media platform that I've been really enjoying just like consuming the content on.
00:48:09.614 - 00:48:25.414, Speaker B: I love this. So like, I really like, I really enjoy Warpcast. I think it's a solid platform. And there was actually a massive, massive airdrop that the Djen farmers received. So I just kind of wanted to touch base on Djen.
00:48:25.454 - 00:48:25.910, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:26.022 - 00:48:55.344, Speaker B: So Degen is this guy right here. So Warpcast does not have a token. So this dgen was a community token. And as you can see, like, dude, it was like nothing down here. It was very, very small and then it pumped like 100, I think it was 150 million market cap. Then there was like VC's that were buying deed and token off the open market which was this wick right here. And everybody is super excited.
00:48:55.344 - 00:49:18.260, Speaker B: We had since crashed back down to about 30 million market cap. And then there was this dgen airdrop. So I'll share this tab. So Degen was similar to portal and like block. And basically what you would do is you would interact on the warpcast. Let's see, oops. On the warpcast platform.
00:49:18.260 - 00:49:31.396, Speaker B: And then you would go down to any of these kind of channels, right? And then if you clicked on one of these, there is more often than not something that would say like Degen token getting, like somebody was giving Djen token to this, this person.
00:49:31.460 - 00:49:37.900, Speaker A: You literally like in Warpcaster, you just write Djen. And then like the amount of tokens.
00:49:38.012 - 00:50:12.244, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, here's a Djen channel. But so then, yeah, like cash djen Djen site back up, fresh allocation to tip. And then, so anybody that comments here, this person is going to give a tip to. So basically the reason I bring this up, nobody was paying attention to it. And dude, if you got tipped, like my girlfriend got tipped like 40,000 degen from Ben Roy of all people. And that 40,000 Djen was like, that was one tip and I think she made like $200 on it. I was like, sorry guys, my camera's like, oh, whatever, there it is.
00:50:12.244 - 00:50:28.414, Speaker B: Maybe no, it's not gonna work. So decent. But like, dude, that was one tip and it was like $200 that she got from that. And so I think like paying attention to some of these things. And, like, dude, it's just social interaction. Like, it's. It's what we, we would normally do anyways.
00:50:28.414 - 00:50:46.068, Speaker B: I think that that's something that we're kind of sleeping on. And this kind of comes down to the question of, like, what is base and what is blast? And, like, are these the two main, like, retail l two s? This is bothering me. Come on, baby.
00:50:46.236 - 00:50:48.884, Speaker A: Hi. That's, like, weird that it's not.
00:50:48.924 - 00:51:18.778, Speaker B: There we go. But, yeah, so I think, like, the two retail chains or their two retail l two s. Like, how many people do you know that fucking use arbitram or optimism? Like, it's not like I'm like, oh, hey, I'm going to go to arbitrum to go use my ethereum over there. Like, that's not a thing. But I do think that blast and base are going to be the winners of that. And so, like, that being said, we have seen some of these huge blow ups happen. So, like, yeah, I should do the djen chain, the degen token.
00:51:18.778 - 00:51:25.898, Speaker B: This is not the right Toshi. So this is Mochi from, like, you can see this is November 13.
00:51:26.066 - 00:51:27.394, Speaker A: You're still on Toshi.
00:51:27.474 - 00:51:46.682, Speaker B: Oh, right on. So this is 43 million market cap right here. Then this is. Thank you, base God. Which is now sitting at around 48 million market cap. And then last one here is Brett. So Brett came out on February 27.
00:51:46.682 - 00:52:09.554, Speaker B: Okay, February 27. Bro, look at this chart. This is not just like, oh, yeah. Like, it kind of pumped. Dude, this thing is at 337 million. 337 million. I'm like, what the fuck is this? Like, we haven't seen anything like this in terms of, like, absolute scale growth.
00:52:09.894 - 00:52:17.206, Speaker A: And since, like, last cycle, like, literally since, like, the first meme season of 2021.
00:52:17.270 - 00:52:32.998, Speaker B: Well, yeah, like, you. You would see this with, like, Marshall Rogan. Inu was one, GM was another one that just, like, absolutely ripped. But it's pretty insane to see, like, how much volume is coming into this. Yeah, like 5.3 million in volume. I don't know.
00:52:32.998 - 00:52:52.336, Speaker B: Like, I think what we're seeing on base right now is going to be something similar to what we see on blast. And blast is hyper financialized. It's going to happen at some point. We just need to be aware of the thing. And that's what I was saying. Like, with, like, leaky exposure. Like, don't just buy one thing and just be like, oh, I have exposure to blast.
00:52:52.336 - 00:53:12.776, Speaker B: Like, dude, I would diversify in as many good projects as you can, whether that be like, the meme coins and making sure that you have Mia and Baja and like pac loon and something like that. Like you never know what one's going to win. And to see Brett go from nothing to 337 million market cap in like twelve days, that's pretty fucked up. It's pretty fucked up in a good way.
00:53:12.960 - 00:53:33.796, Speaker A: It's fucked up in a good way. And, like, I think this also goes because it's like, it's not just base memes that are taking off right now. Solana memes have been ripping too. Like, what? There's Joe Bowden and like Trump tremp. I don't, I don't even know. It's like all these political memes, bro.
00:53:33.860 - 00:53:46.816, Speaker B: Elizabeth Warren sent me, bro. That shit fucking says, like, I gotta buy it. I gotta buy it. Like, just. Just to be part of it. And I was like, I haven't felt disconnected to a fucking shit coin since like, nfts.
00:53:46.960 - 00:53:56.792, Speaker A: Honestly, I saw swifties way too late. I saw swifties at like 5 million market cap and I'm like one. How come no one called me? Like, how dare I didn't see it?
00:53:56.808 - 00:53:57.120, Speaker B: I'm sorry.
00:53:57.152 - 00:54:28.288, Speaker A: How dare web three do this to me? But, like, I was like, I have to buy it. And then I bought it and then it went down and then I saw another one that was like swift. It was like swifties but, like, completely misspelled. And I was like, fuck. Should have bought that one. And I don't know, I. I need like a week of, like, focusing back on farms and, like, recovering from my sheer wreckage that I experienced last week of running around, trying to jump into all of these.
00:54:28.336 - 00:54:57.578, Speaker B: Oh, dude. I think that, like, just trying to get in on top of everything and, like, all the information. Like, when I got sick, I was just like, fuck, man. Like, we run so, so hard. So hard just to, like, make sure that we get all the information together. Then we make sure that we, like, we. This hasn't been publicly stated, but we hired my little brother to come edit some videos because I was just like, bro, we can't do all this, right? Like, this is just getting too much to, like, be able to, like, kind of put out so much content.
00:54:57.578 - 00:55:19.314, Speaker B: And I think that that's a part of the space that we don't necessarily talk about. It's like the people that work in this, like, it doesn't stop. And then the people that do this for fun and they actually have, like, like, normal job that they used. That they go to, like, we both used to do, right? Like, then you just come here and, like, this is like, your hobby. But you guys all know this, like, it just doesn't frickin stop.
00:55:19.394 - 00:55:52.464, Speaker A: So, I mean that the week that you got sick was the week that I put out more content in, like, a five day period of time than I've ever, ever put out before. And, like, I'm used to doing, like, much shorter format videos, and these were, like, much more long and in depth, and, like, I was exhausted. Yeah. Staying up till three or four in the morning, editing, like, every other night, it was crazy. But. So that covers bass. That covers warpcast.
00:55:52.464 - 00:56:05.672, Speaker A: Definitely find us on Warpcast, by the way, guys, if you do go there, it is super fun. You'll find me in the Taylor Swift cast channel if you need me. I just, I have to say, look at your.
00:56:05.728 - 00:56:07.084, Speaker B: I'm not even going to respond.
00:56:08.344 - 00:56:31.654, Speaker A: Before we hop off, I want to talk about ordinals real quick. Like, we touched on this at the beginning of, like, our ordinals going to flipboard ape. And I think our guess is, like, yes, probably, very likely. Are there any ordinals you're accumulating? Are there any mints that, that you're looking forward to? Like, kind of. How are you? What's your strategy on ordinals as of right now?
00:56:33.314 - 00:57:03.294, Speaker B: I think that, like, for me personally, I have decent ordinal exposure. Like, definitely bullish on puppets, but I'm not as bullish puppets as I am quantum cats. So, like, I. Quantum cats is going to be something that I definitely kind of want to be kind of paying attention to. Like, that team has a. They have deep connects. That's the taproot wizards team.
00:57:03.294 - 00:57:26.926, Speaker B: So I think that if there were to be, like, bitcoin defi airdrops or something like that, like, I'm speculating here, but I would expect that to go to, like, quantum cats, and there's only 3333 of them, so I definitely think that that's a play. Bitcoin puppets. Like I said, node monkeys. Like, node monkeys took a massive dip, dude. They were at, like, 0.83, and they came down to 0.4 this morning, so that was pretty huge.
00:57:26.926 - 00:57:50.408, Speaker B: So, like, but this is what we were talking about, right? I think these 50, 60% cutbacks that you're going to see, so make sure you're steadfast with the things that you're buying, that you're not levered up and things like that, because, like, dude, we could see 60, 70% pullbacks and then, like, resume the up only market. So just make sure you remain in spot unless you're buying on the dip. And even then, like, just be careful.
00:57:50.496 - 00:58:08.544, Speaker A: So what. What about the newer collections there? I feel like, because the two that I'm watching, because I don't have. I have bitcoin burials. That is my only ordinals. Unacceptable. So I'm looking at the ink. Ink on bt cement.
00:58:08.544 - 00:58:16.842, Speaker A: I know. Uniforce or oni force, however you want to say it, is coming to bitcoin on one force. I don't think it's on one.
00:58:16.938 - 00:58:18.374, Speaker B: That's how I've always said it.
00:58:20.074 - 00:58:31.402, Speaker A: But, like, these newer collections, what would you say to someone like me who is just getting into ordinals for the first time? Like, is there any culture things that you think are worth calling out?
00:58:31.458 - 00:58:45.814, Speaker B: Like, I had a post that I could. I'm gonna have to find it. But basically it was like, talking about, like, my cross chain wish list, and I started adding some new, like, kind of lower tier. Like, lower tier.
00:58:46.754 - 00:58:48.934, Speaker A: Lower tier. $5,000.
00:58:49.674 - 00:59:10.110, Speaker B: I was like, lower tier. Like, OCM Genesis. It's at 0.1 BTC, but, like, it's a hard game to play, right? Because you don't know what's going to stick and how it's going to work. And it's very competitive. And so, like, I have stayed away from art at this point because, like, art is a total crap shoot. It's similar to buying art on Solana.
00:59:10.110 - 00:59:26.094, Speaker B: Like, there is the one collection that, like, popped off that kind of look, like, screens by Thomas Lynn Peterson. But I was like, I'm not. It's called rubber. And then they. On BTC, it was just like, if the cabal likes it, then all of a sudden the cabal likes it and they pump it. And I don't like playing that game. Like, that's.
00:59:26.094 - 00:59:47.874, Speaker B: It's too much for me. Like, because you just never know if you're gonna hit it, and it's a total gamble. That said, like, I would pay attention to Bitcoin art house. It's one that's coming up that I'm really excited about. Yeah, that's probably it. I would. I would say either save and buy something blue chip or at least, like, a solid, solid team, like OCM or something like that.
00:59:47.874 - 00:59:57.334, Speaker B: Or just not play at all. That's how I play at this point. Unless you're total Djen, you're just, like, flipping shit. And if you're flipping shit, like, godspeed, like, I wish you the best.
00:59:57.494 - 01:00:18.012, Speaker A: Got it. Well, I will. I'll let you know how the mints go. And I do see a comment if I can get someone whitelist. Unfortunately, I can't. I was barely able to get myself whitelist, so. But in the future, I imagine if more of those come our way, you guys know that we will be giving them out to our listeners.
01:00:18.012 - 01:00:25.288, Speaker A: I think that is one of the, that should be like a 2024 goal for us, is to be able to give, like, whitelist out to tune into our show.
01:00:25.316 - 01:00:25.504, Speaker B: Show.
01:00:25.544 - 01:00:26.604, Speaker A: That'd be pretty sick.
01:00:27.344 - 01:00:28.784, Speaker B: I'm gonna be thinking about it.
01:00:28.904 - 01:00:54.950, Speaker A: Well, on that note, guys, I think that's it for today. Expect a video from me later this week, probably on how to farm Wasabi because again, they have way more features out than most folks. So I think I'm ready to actually put something together there. And I do plan on doing just like a general blast all around update video, probably Thursday this week after the Wednesday Ama dope.
01:00:55.062 - 01:00:55.902, Speaker B: Let's get it.
01:00:55.998 - 01:01:00.470, Speaker A: Let's get it. All right, guys, thank you so much for tuning in. We'll catch you guys next time.
01:01:00.582 - 01:01:05.054, Speaker B: See y'all. Bye. And.
