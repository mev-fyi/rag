00:00:00.360 - 00:00:02.174, Speaker B: Hey, guys, it's Jen and it's Dalton.
00:00:02.262 - 00:00:34.786, Speaker A: And we are so excited to be bringing remint reality to IRL in partnership with Shiller. So today we actually have a pretty fun conversation. I think there has been one brand that I have seen everywhere, not only here at NFT NYC, but also on the timeline. So without further ado, I'm really excited to introduce Zed, one of the co founders of Magic Eden. How are you?
00:00:34.858 - 00:00:35.794, Speaker C: Good. How are you guys?
00:00:35.882 - 00:00:36.962, Speaker B: Good, bro. Nice to see you.
00:00:36.986 - 00:00:38.698, Speaker C: Yeah, likewise. Thank you so much for having me.
00:00:38.754 - 00:00:42.210, Speaker A: Of course. Are you surviving after all of the lovely magic Eden?
00:00:42.250 - 00:00:48.570, Speaker C: I feel like my voice is, like, wrecked right now. Like, all raspy after the last couple of days screaming on a yacht.
00:00:48.650 - 00:00:51.546, Speaker B: Bro, I'm so sad that I missed the yacht party. I really am.
00:00:51.618 - 00:00:57.162, Speaker C: You kind of just missed a very shaky, dangerous boat experience.
00:00:57.346 - 00:01:03.482, Speaker B: Okay. I actually did see a video on Twitter. Was that the actual, like, getting on the boat, or was it. Did anybody see that?
00:01:03.506 - 00:01:04.090, Speaker C: No, I didn't see.
00:01:04.170 - 00:01:05.306, Speaker B: Okay, well, we'll have to check.
00:01:05.338 - 00:01:06.018, Speaker C: Maybe. It was probably.
00:01:06.074 - 00:01:27.106, Speaker B: It's probably true. That's epic. Take us back to September 2021. So you guys launch ethnfts at this point were like. We were talking about these different verticals, right? So Eth NFTs were having a season. People were paying attention. People were paying crazy amounts of money for cartoon jpegs and things like that.
00:01:27.106 - 00:01:29.070, Speaker B: You guys decide to launch on Solana?
00:01:29.170 - 00:01:29.494, Speaker C: Yep.
00:01:29.542 - 00:01:41.862, Speaker B: Now take us back to the early Solana days. Like, obviously, people, the early Solana degens. Remember degenerate ape Academy, the paper handed bitch tax for d gods, things like that? Like those kind of, like, we're getting.
00:01:41.886 - 00:01:42.998, Speaker C: Like, waves of nostalgia.
00:01:43.054 - 00:01:54.674, Speaker B: Yeah, bro. It was like the. It was fun back then. It was just, like, on, like, it was like the anti eth NfT kind of movement. Can you take us back to the early days and kind of what you saw? Why did you launch on Solana?
00:01:54.782 - 00:01:56.970, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so this goes all way back to.
