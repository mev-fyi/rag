00:00:00.280 - 00:00:28.966, Speaker A: Let's unpack the idea of using NFTs as collateral. Collateral is what the lender gets to take from you if you don't pay back the loan. Think of this like going to a pawnshop. Imagine you have a diamond ring and you're looking to get some cash, but you don't want to sell it. You can put the diamond ring up as collateral to get money, but if you don't pay it back, the pawn shop gets to keep your collateral. When it comes to NFT lending, this is basically exactly what happens, except it's all done permissionlessly and using blockchain technology.
00:00:29.150 - 00:00:31.638, Speaker B: Now to the latest trend that's sweeping the Internet.
00:00:31.806 - 00:00:39.874, Speaker C: Nfts are not a scam. Nfts are not a fad. In fact, NFTs are the building blocks of the future.
00:00:40.894 - 00:00:43.754, Speaker D: That's why I'm here. I'm here for a rebellion.
00:00:45.654 - 00:00:50.434, Speaker B: The consumer blockchain is going to be a profound change for everybody watching.
00:00:52.774 - 00:01:05.514, Speaker D: But isn't it interesting for being permissionless has been so novel and so difficult to achieve? Isn't it interesting that in the realm of money, before crypto, all movement of funds required someone's permission?
00:01:09.174 - 00:01:56.538, Speaker A: Now, which NFTs you can use as collateral largely depends on the lending platform or protocol you choose. Generally speaking, across most platforms, PFP collections and on chain generative art are commonly supported. We're also seeing a rise in platforms accepting more unique NFT types, like financial nfts and those linked to real world assets. So why does collateral matter? Well, it's the most important thing when it comes to lending and borrowing. With nfts. If a borrower doesn't repay their loan, the collateral is all the lender gets, and it's going to be a key factor when determining how much a lender or a liquidity pool will give you in relation to the value of your NFT. This is also known as the loan to value ratio, or LTV.
00:01:56.538 - 00:02:32.954, Speaker A: Let's just say I wanted to use this little pudgy as collateral for a loan. The bid price on little pudgy is one ETH. If I borrow 0.5 ETH against my little pudgy, then my loan to value ratio is 50%. Valuing an NFT typically involves looking at the average price across various marketplaces. However, if you want the most accurate valuation, you should be looking at what the top bids are on that particular asset. But this isn't a one size fits all solution, since with certain nfts and collections, things like rarity or certain traits can play a factor in how it's valued.
00:02:33.294 - 00:02:34.102, Speaker B: Wow.
00:02:34.278 - 00:03:23.618, Speaker A: The type of collateral used in NFT lending also significantly affects interest rates, especially in peer to peer lending. Lenders providing loans against more volatile or speculative NFTs typically will only lend at higher interest rates due to the increased risk for the lender. That is, the borrower doesn't pay back the loan, the lender could end up with a completely worthless JPEG at the end of the day. If I were to create tiers of NFT collateral, here's how I would break it down. In tier one, you have your NFT finance blue chips. This tier includes established high value collections like cryptopunks, squiggles, and autoglyphs, all of which have a track record of retaining value even in market downturns. These assets also have some of the lowest interest rates, as well as longer loan durations.
00:03:23.618 - 00:04:15.516, Speaker A: I would also include real world assets in tier one, specifically luxury goods and physical collectibles that have established price histories that make these assets much less speculative. Then in tier two, you have your established players. Tier two encompasses well known PFP collections along with established generative art projects, unique one of ones, and emerging financial nfts for the PFP collections. These nfts hold value, but they can still heavily be influenced by the market and are more volatile compared to tier one as it relates to one of ones. I'm putting these in tier two as more often than not, the secondary market for these assets is much smaller, so it can be harder to liquidate. In tier three, you have rising contenders. They might not have the market presence that the top tiers have, but they show potential.
00:04:15.516 - 00:04:57.794, Speaker A: And then you have tier four with the wild cards. The most speculative assets fall into this category. For me, these are often new or unproven projects and are considered wild cards due to their high volatility and uncertainty. Certainty and of course, there will be times when collateral conversations can get even more nuanced, but this should start to give you a solid foundation to wrap your head around the concept of using NFTs as collateral. In the next episode, we're going to be diving into breaking down peer to peer and peer to pull NFT lending models.
