00:00:00.280 - 00:00:01.630, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm Jen.
00:00:01.822 - 00:00:03.062, Speaker B: And I'm Dalton.
00:00:03.238 - 00:00:13.634, Speaker A: And this is remit reality, where we're going to talk about all things JPEGs, NFT fi, real world assets and basically anything that's happening across the web3 ecosystem.
00:00:14.254 - 00:00:27.436, Speaker B: I have thoroughly enjoyed doing this with you. Like we said last week, we're getting to riff every week and it has been just so much fun getting to know you. And now we're back for. For our second round.
00:00:27.550 - 00:00:36.936, Speaker A: Yeah, our second round. And I think this one's actually going to go live. We're going to put this one up in its full entirety. So I'm excited to see what people think.
00:00:37.080 - 00:00:48.872, Speaker B: I know last week we were like, so branding this and that, and no, now we. Now we got it dialed. Thanks to you, Jen, for. For creating this beautiful logo. And we have a Twitter page and everything, so I'm pumped.
00:00:49.008 - 00:00:54.084, Speaker A: Hell yeah, dude. Before we dig in, I have to ask, how is your weekend?
00:00:54.714 - 00:01:11.054, Speaker B: Well, this weekend was thanksgiving, but I live in Mexico City, so, yeah, I didn't really celebrate Thanksgiving, but I did have some barbacoa. I did have some friends over at the house, so it was fun. What about you? What did you get up to?
00:01:11.594 - 00:02:08.588, Speaker A: I did leverage trading for the first time like a crazy person. It was Wednesday night and I was like, oh, well, yeah, I think I started on Wednesday and it was like one of those things we were talking about perps before. And I think, like, sometimes I have a really hard time wrapping my brain around some of, like, the NFT five protocols. Like, I'll sit on a call, they'll explain it, and I get it in principle, but I'm like, how? How does this actually work? And so I figured, um, let me, like, do some, like, perps and leverage trading on blur for funsies. Cause blur was pumping and being super volatile and I figured, hey, if I can, like, kind of get the hang of it on, like, this crazy chart that's moving up and down all the time. Like, we'll check it out. So I tried that for the first time, went really well for the first 24 hours, and then lost it all, like, throughout the jump this week, I.
00:02:08.596 - 00:02:29.416, Speaker B: Was gonna say Jen's entering her day trader arc and I'm like, yes, this is what? Dude, that's. Honestly, I feel like everybody has to go through it at some point. You're like, leverage. This is. So you're telling me if there's a 10% move and I don't get liquidated and I time the bottom perfectly, I make that much and you're like, dude, yeah, I.
00:02:29.560 - 00:02:50.090, Speaker A: To be fair, like, I just threw in, like, $200. But next thing you know, I found myself depositing another $200. Cause I'm like, oh, I get it. Takeaways is don't do manual triggers. That's kind of crazy. Like, just, like, set the price, watch the chart, and if it, like, triggers your shit, great, you're good to go. Um, but it was funny.
00:02:50.090 - 00:03:08.066, Speaker A: I was, like, in some discord groups sending my p and ls because I was like, oh, I just made a $100. But it was like, with 50 x leverage or 75 x leverage. Cause, like, I was just like, oh, look at this little leverage bar. Like, I'm just sliding it fucking around and finding out. Um, but so, wait, you.
00:03:08.090 - 00:03:10.042, Speaker B: You did 75 x leverage?
00:03:10.178 - 00:03:12.490, Speaker A: Yeah, the last day where. When I lost it all.
00:03:12.522 - 00:03:14.134, Speaker B: When you lost it all? Of course.
00:03:14.874 - 00:03:36.776, Speaker A: Well, it was like, I was like, fuck yeah. Like, $50 just made me $200. Like, I have an account balance of $400. And then next thing you know, I. I got kind of emotional watching the chart. And this is when I was like, I need to use, like, just triggers where you set in the price and it's like, it activates. Because then I was like, I would open a short and then it would pump, and I'd be like, fuck, this is a bad entry point.
00:03:36.776 - 00:03:47.960, Speaker A: And then I'd, like, close the short at a loss, and then I'd open up another short. It was just a mess. I don't. I don't know if I could ever, like, do this, seriously. This was more for educational purposes.
00:03:48.072 - 00:03:50.160, Speaker B: So what. What platform did you use?
00:03:50.272 - 00:03:51.792, Speaker A: I used mexe.
00:03:51.968 - 00:03:52.800, Speaker B: Wow.
00:03:52.992 - 00:04:02.184, Speaker A: Dude. Blur. Oh, my God. It was crazy. Like, people were giving me shit because they were like, jen, this is beginner's luck. Like, literally the first day, I was.
00:04:02.224 - 00:04:14.484, Speaker B: Like, up like a queen, and I know exactly what I'm doing. And I was like, you texted me. And I was just like, she's leverage trading on Thanksgiving. And I was just like, whatever.
00:04:17.144 - 00:04:37.504, Speaker A: I got. I got my head around it a little bit more, and then I spent time with family, so that was, like, super chill. And then, you know, I know we're gonna dig into it, but just, like, ended up being glued to fucking crypto Twitter and discords, like, talking about blast and talking about blur and trying to figure out what the fuck is going on there, but.
00:04:37.624 - 00:05:11.142, Speaker B: Well, to be fair, it's a fun time in the market. You're getting, like, it's better to. To wrap your head around it now before we really start seeing things pop off and, like, having those things, whether it be like rollbit or whatever, like, just having those platforms to go to. Like, for instance, we saw what happened when there was like a fake ETH, uh, ETF announcement, right? Like, ETH just went crazy. Having the ability to send something over to a wallet. And that is when you would deploy, like, hundred x leverage, right? Like, okay, ETH ETF just got announced. Shit's gonna pump super hard out of the gate.
00:05:11.142 - 00:05:18.174, Speaker B: You go 100 x live long, and then you just let that go, close it out so that you're in profit.
00:05:18.214 - 00:05:24.694, Speaker A: But you close your eyes and just go, okay, it's gonna fly. What's my p and l now?
00:05:24.854 - 00:05:28.958, Speaker B: But no, it's cool that you got to experience it. So thanks.
00:05:29.046 - 00:06:02.642, Speaker A: And I mean, to your point, dude, the market sentiment right now, it's so refreshing coming out of the last couple of months just to see people kind of excited about the space again, whether we're excited for the, about the space for the right reasons. I think it's like another conversation, but I think everyone's just generally happier and not as depressed. And I was looking at coinmarketcap and I'm like, wow, that, like, greed fear index is like, comfortably sitting in greed. And it's been like that for a few weeks. And, like, I haven't seen that in so long. So that's dope.
00:06:02.818 - 00:06:32.868, Speaker B: I saw a tweet the other day that said at 35,000 or, no, it was at, it was at 25,000. Nobody said that it could go to 35,000. Now where we're at now, people are like, oh, there's no way it goes back to 25,000. And I think that that kind of attitude kind of scares me because there's so many people bull posting now. People are coming back in the mix. We're seeing, like, ETH NFT volume spike. Like, people are getting excited again, whether that be on the back of blast and blur season three farming, which I know we're going to get into.
00:06:32.868 - 00:07:08.830, Speaker B: But, like, I don't, I don't necessarily know if it's just because of that. Like, people are just actually excited again in the market. But then again, I think that we could see some type of reversal here and people would get absolutely wrecked. And, like, one of the, one of the things I always ask myself is like, okay, what is Max Payne in this situation? Is Max Payne to see price Spike because nobody's involved or, and now I think people like price has been hanging out in this general vicinity for the last, what couple weeks. And people are starting to say, like, oh, yeah, no. People are starting to, to long again. They're starting to start buying things, and they're like, okay, like, I'm prepared.
00:07:08.830 - 00:07:14.354, Speaker B: I'm in the Solana ecosystem now. Now what happens? And I'm like, that kind of scares me.
00:07:15.414 - 00:07:52.970, Speaker A: I think you're spot on. I mean, we, we touched upon this in the last episode of, like, everyone thinking that they had more time, everyone thinking that, you know, we were going to be in a bear for at least another year. Like, I don't know if the bull posts that we're seeing are just a result of, like, the slight uptick in price, because, like, let's, let's be honest, like, the moves have been great, like, on Ethereum to go from, like, that 17 1800 range to $2,000. But it's like, I can also see it going back down. Like, I'm just excited that sentiment is generally better. But do I think we're in a full blown bull market yet? Like, absolutely not.
00:07:53.082 - 00:08:27.874, Speaker B: Yeah, no. And you see it in the Solana ecosystem, too, right? Where, how Solana was at $8, what? Like, after the whole SPF thing in November last year, and we see this just atrocious downtrend that has slowly kind of come back around. And now Solana is sitting in the $60 range and people are super excited. NFT collections are selling out again. People are just pumped, right? Like, they're starting to see their bags absolutely rip. Mad lads hit 115 sold today, which is crazy. They were worth 40 sold just a week and a half ago, two weeks ago.
00:08:27.874 - 00:08:53.134, Speaker B: And there's just, like, this excitement in the market, right? But then again, like we said, max Payne, like, I feel like people are starting to long their longs and they're like, yeah, no, okay. Like, I didn't, I don't, I didn't think I had this much time. And now I'm in this situation where prices kind of been hanging out for the last week. We haven't seen any real fireworks. And so people are starting to layer in again and they're like, okay, cool, now I'm ready. And now I'm just like, to.
00:08:53.474 - 00:08:59.034, Speaker A: Dude, I think it's, uh. I think obviously, neither of us knows what's going to happen in this market.
00:08:59.074 - 00:09:03.034, Speaker B: Of course, nobody, the market doesn't know what it's going to do tomorrow.
00:09:03.194 - 00:09:40.810, Speaker A: Like, literally, like that blur pump that I saw, like, from the day before, even before, a little bit before thanksgiving. Like, what? Went from, like, fifty five cents and then shot up to like, almost $0.70. That was insane. But I think, like, we are entering the season of DCA. I think, you know, that initial pump that we saw in the last couple of weeks kind of just. It was like a wake up call for me of like, hey, you know how you've been saying you're gonna, like, prep your bags and pack your bags? You better actually start fucking doing it? And so I think, like, mixed. A little bit mixed overall, but, dude, I think it's just DCA all the way.
00:09:40.962 - 00:10:12.506, Speaker B: Yeah, no, we'll see what happens. Right? Like, I'm excited to at least people are paying attention again. And if we are lucky enough to see a pullback, that is when we need to start going all in again. Because I think we talked about Gordon Gonner last week, and, like, the Gordon gonna sweeps. Gordon Gonner, founder, ByC, comes in and starts buying a bunch of shit after being inactive for a while, right? And then, like, people are like, oh, my God. NFts actually have value. And he wasn't just buying floors, right? Which floors are floors, right? And we have seen with blur bidding and everything like that.
00:10:12.506 - 00:10:37.642, Speaker B: Like, the way that people interact with floors now versus how they interacted with them before and even, like, mid rares and things like that, like, there just wasn't a market, right? Gordon Garner comes in, he starts buying these grails, and people are like, oh, man. Rare traits actually matter again. And I'm like, so if we are lucky to see. Lucky enough to see a pullback go in on the things that you have high conviction on, right. I think that's. That's what we learned. So.
00:10:37.818 - 00:10:49.328, Speaker A: And hold. Hold for dear life. Like, that's literally all you have. We have to do is, like, start DCA. DCA, pay attention to the things that we have high conviction with and then just hold.
00:10:49.496 - 00:10:50.104, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:50.224 - 00:10:52.368, Speaker A: Like, knock on wood.
00:10:52.496 - 00:10:56.204, Speaker B: All right, well, then Jen's gonna start leverage trading, and then everybody's gonna get wrecked.
00:10:58.784 - 00:11:21.878, Speaker A: Don't tempt me. I was like, oh, do I put another hundred dollars in this account just to, like, see what happens? Okay. To leverage trading. I just want to call this out. Um, here it is. So this past Saturday, Ethan, fts had the most volume that they've had in any single day since early July. So I think that just goes back to the point that we were talking about, like, sentiment is coming back.
00:11:21.878 - 00:11:42.450, Speaker A: People are starting to buy things again. Nice to see some volume in the market, which I know we were a little bit hesitant on post blur season two ending, but I know we're going to dig into that before we do. Dude, I was checking out flooring protocol. It seems like they had a couple of updates over the weekend. Do you want to dig into some of those?
00:11:42.602 - 00:12:14.294, Speaker B: Yeah. So first things first, we're talking about having, like, high conviction in some of these platforms, right? I think. I think flooring protocol is starting to become one of those plays for me. Um, I'm not invested in it at all at this point. Like, I've just been watching it from the side. But FLC free lunch capital came out last week and said that flooring protocols mission is to own ten to 30% supply of every single NFT collection. That's pretty insane.
00:12:14.834 - 00:12:29.194, Speaker A: Okay, for a point of clarity, do they mean that flooring protocol itself, that is, you know, free lunch capital wants to put ten to 30% or they want to attract enough users to have at least ten to 30%.
00:12:29.314 - 00:13:18.930, Speaker B: Right, well, and see, this is kind of where it's confusing, right? Because I think he swept like 26 de gods or something like that, like last week, and he pushed price up to three. Three ETH. So when it was like, this is d gods were trending downwards, right? And I bought and then they kept trending downwards and I was like, God fucking damn it, like, I did it again. Um, and then he came in and he bought like 26 or 36 d gods push price back up. And then we see an uptick in NFT volume. Right. Um, it'll be interesting to see kind of how they attract those plays, whether, like you said, whether it be people depositing those, those NFTs into the pool and then kind of saying like, okay, flooring protocol has ten to 30% of every collection, which is at this point, like, there is like a shit ton of TVL over there.
00:13:18.930 - 00:13:36.594, Speaker B: Like, there's a lot of people that are playing that game. Um, and I think that if, if they are short on something, well, then freelance capital and flowing protocol can go in and say, you know what? Okay, we're going to buy a bunch of these, right? Um, and it becomes, they're becoming a very notable marketplace within the NFT ecosystem. Right.
00:13:36.714 - 00:13:39.054, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's absolutely fair to say.
00:13:39.754 - 00:13:58.298, Speaker B: With that being said, I know that we broke down some of it and we're going to have Eddie on it at some point to go deeper into the floor. And protocol, he's too busy on blast. But whatever. Free lunch capital came out this week and came out with three updates. We'll go into each of them. First one was new marketplace mechanics. Second one was a rev share feature.
00:13:58.298 - 00:14:29.820, Speaker B: And then the third one was this IP sharing framework. First things first. New marketplace mechanics. Exactly. He showed this tweet that has a trippy for ape and it basically just says you'll be able to buy a trippie for ape with 6 million new BAYC tokens. We kind of riffed on this before the show. We said that trippy for apes tend to be six x the floor of BAYC.
00:14:29.820 - 00:14:30.740, Speaker B: Now.
00:14:30.932 - 00:14:39.420, Speaker A: Well, we just threw that number out there, to be clear. But it is fair to say that trippie for apes are 100% more valuable than the floor.
00:14:39.492 - 00:14:40.164, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:14:40.244 - 00:14:41.404, Speaker A: Of historical traits.
00:14:41.484 - 00:15:20.634, Speaker B: Yeah. And so this is kind of where I think about, are you familiar with JPEG? They're like a NFT lending protocol. Yeah, yeah. So they do like these trait boosts, right? And so originally I was just like when I saw this tweet, I was like, okay, so they're doing like a trait boost where you could buy a trippy fur ape for 6 million u b a Y C. Right. But then wouldn't that require somebody to put a trippy for ape into the protocol? Well, now they're saying like this is going to be a new marketplace. So the way that I'm kind of seeing it is if there is a listed trippy for Apex, then you will be able to buy it for 6 million mub AYC.
00:15:21.094 - 00:16:02.844, Speaker A: Yeah. I think, you know, right now on OpenSea Blur X two, Y two. And a lot of the other NFT marketplaces that are being utilized, a lot of, actually, I think across all of them, all NFTs are listed in ETH. And so I think the whole point of this marketplace, because the whole idea is you deposit one NFT, you get 100 Mew tokens of that NFTs collection. I think the whole point here is like, oh, we're coming out with a marketplace where everything can be transacted with Mew tokens as the currency. So it's like if I had a trippie for Ape, I know that it's worth at least six board apes. So I might set the sell price to be 6 million Mew tokens.
00:16:02.844 - 00:16:23.196, Speaker A: I actually think now that we're chatting about it a little bit more, that could be interesting for those who are in flooring protocol and making their capital more efficient because now they can just transact with Mew tokens directly instead of like, oh, let me swap to ETH, go to this marketplace and like pay an ETH when they can just do it directly on flooring.
00:16:23.340 - 00:16:56.412, Speaker B: Well, and even for say grail holders having the liquidity to say, okay, like, I'm going to have 6 million mew tokens, mu b a Y c tokens if I want to sell my trippy for eight. Because this is something that, like, we're just talking about Gordon Gonner, Gordon Garner came in and he said, I'm buying all these grails. Grail NFT holders are in a really tough position because, like, there isn't very much liquidity. We see it across art blocks collections. We see it like, art blocks collections will go weeks without a single buy. Right? Yeah. And then somebody says, ah, meridian.
00:16:56.412 - 00:17:13.285, Speaker B: Meridian. Meridian. Meridian. Meridian. Meridian. They just, like, buys are flying off the shelf because it's like an attention economy play, right? Same thing with grails, right? Spirit Azuki's go through seasons where there's just, like, spirit Azuki's just start flying off the shelf because somebody said it's cool. And then, like, people are like, oh, I want one.
00:17:13.285 - 00:17:39.833, Speaker B: Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And then there's like, seven sales, and then we go a month without another sale. Right. So I think this, this new marketplace mechanic where these grail holders can say they might not get top dollar for it, but then if they're long azuki and they want to sell their spirit Azuki, then they could say, like, I don't know how many million new Azuki tokens you would have to hold, right? Like that. That isn't what the tweet was talking about, but it would be a lot.
00:17:40.164 - 00:18:09.244, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, and it also depends on, like, what are, to your point, what are these valued at? I think, like, where I get a little tripped up with using mew tokens as currency is like, mew tokens have their own pricing based off of volume. It's not concrete. Whereas you, you can't necessarily always say, like, a million Mew tokens is going to be one to one equivalent of whatever the open sea floor or blur floor for bored apes is at that time.
00:18:09.364 - 00:18:37.996, Speaker B: Right, right. Um, yeah, no, and then next net, the next one here is the second announcement where they're going to be, um, kind of integrating this revenue share feature. There's going to be income from the vaults that are going to be shared with mew token holders of that collection, I'm assuming. And then there's going to be income from the marketplace that is going to go to FLC holders. FLC, you can also stake. So I'm assuming that there's going to be, like, staked FLC holders that are going to be receiving this. This rev share.
00:18:37.996 - 00:19:02.654, Speaker B: This is. We're going to go into it a little bit more here, but blast comes in and blur. So there's blur, there's blend, and there's blast. Blur is the marketplace blend is the NfT lending, and then blast is this new l two. That isn't an l two yet, but it's going to be an l two. Okay. Blur comes out and says, anybody that is going to another platform is going to lose loyalty points.
00:19:02.654 - 00:19:29.358, Speaker B: Right. And this is a direct response to flowing protocol because flowing protocol was starting to gain some momentum. Um, they had, like, a. Some pretty huge days come out, and they're like, okay, now blur is coming out and saying, if you use flowing protocol, you're going to lose loyalty points. Great. Now free lunch capital kind of responds to this and says, we're going to start this rev share thing. Is this enough to keep flooring protocol in the mix? Like, I.
00:19:29.358 - 00:19:34.678, Speaker B: I don't know. Unless. I don't know. How do you feel about it, dude?
00:19:34.726 - 00:20:21.804, Speaker A: So I don't. In all honesty, I don't know if it's enough. I don't know. Number one, that announcement had no percentages on what the rev share was going to be. So you have to, like, we actually have to, like, do a little bit of, like, mental math in our head of, like, is this going to tally up to be whatever it is we're going to get from blast? And I think the other thing to consider is, you know, right now, I think it's over $500 million has been deposited and is currently farming for the blast token. So, like, there's obviously going to be some dilution to what people get, but that just means that the token, I imagine the token valuation and the market cap when it drops is going to be a fucking bag.
00:20:21.964 - 00:20:22.348, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:22.396 - 00:20:59.754, Speaker A: And, like, does rev share from, like, marketplace volume? Is it going to make up for the bag that you're going to get if you max out your loyalty? And I think one of the things that I noticed with season two is loyalty played a really big role in what people actually got. And so I think, number one, retail. Seeing how much some of the farmers made and how much some of their friends just made from casually being on blur, I have a feeling that people are going to stick to Pac Man's made me money before, and he's going to make me money again.
00:20:59.874 - 00:21:18.408, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I agree with that. And I also. This is something that Sam and I were talking about. Like, just have another wallet. Like, I have, like, at least 15 wallets that I use consistently. So I'm just like, just have one wallet that is that wallet and then this wallet that's that wallet. Like, it's, it's not that big of a deal.
00:21:18.408 - 00:21:18.616, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:18.640 - 00:21:21.376, Speaker A: So it's super easy to circumvent if you want.
00:21:21.520 - 00:21:49.782, Speaker B: I think that there's going to be ways for people to get around this. Um, and it not necessarily be a big deal. Right. So last but not least, this is the final announcement of these quick little three announcements. They implemented an IP sharing framework. We talked about this before the show last week. We chatted on like liquid delegate and having some of these utility tokens.
00:21:49.782 - 00:22:29.604, Speaker B: Utility NFTs, like we use proof as an example. Proof has grails. And during Grail season, you would be able to delegate your proof, proof pass utility to somebody else and they would be able to buy it for say, an ETH or 1.5 ETH or whatever. Originally, this is kind of how I felt about this announcement here. Right? So you have these safe box holders that have Grail NFTs, and obviously Grail NFTs are going to be worth more in terms of IP and overall value, right. And so people can now sell their ip to their safe box grail NFT.
00:22:29.764 - 00:22:31.068, Speaker A: That'S in the safe box.
00:22:31.156 - 00:23:00.320, Speaker B: Right, right. So like, you don't lose your NFT. Your NFT is there, but you can delegate basically this IP to somebody else that wants to use it. Right. And it says there for, for six to 24. Six to 24 months. I really don't know if this is a big, outside of, say, pudgy penguins that they just hit a million, a million followers on Instagram board apes.
00:23:00.320 - 00:23:05.684, Speaker B: We talked about like the dispensaries and some of these restaurants that have like bored apes as the logo.
00:23:08.384 - 00:23:09.604, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:23:10.764 - 00:23:36.572, Speaker B: Outside of that, I really don't see the, like kleinosaurs over on Seoul, but like, kleinosaurs are worth like $1,500. Like, they would just go buy one. They're, they're not gonna, you know, you get, get what I'm saying? Like maybe, maybe I'm like mid curving this completely and I'm like, okay, this is a big deal in twelve months and I'm completely mid curving this. But I don't see how this is really adding much. I don't know.
00:23:36.748 - 00:24:24.992, Speaker A: I don't think you're mid curbing it because, like, IP rights is one thing. Like, actual utility of the NFT is another. Right? Like, it's not. This announcement isn't coming out and saying like, hey, you will be able to specify and delegate in the same way that liquid delegate is doing, you will be able to like give away your airdrop claim rights or your token gated experience rights to someone. The IP play. I agree with you because it's like outside of certain communities, I really don't see people doing a whole lot with their NFT IP. Like if we're just being realistic, like, you know, Azuki's, like the big thing in the garden is to do commissions of your, of your azuki or your elemental or your beans.
00:24:24.992 - 00:24:39.714, Speaker A: But like I could have my elemental in my safe box and I'm still gonna do commissions on it. I don't think anyone's going to specifically buy my elemental or by the exclusive IP rights to it for twelve months. So they can go do whatever the fuck they want.
00:24:39.834 - 00:24:42.374, Speaker B: Right, right, yeah.
00:24:44.594 - 00:24:57.254, Speaker A: Yeah. Outside of pudgy, like, honestly, outside of pudgy and like the Yuga ecosystem. Like, I don't really see a big use case for this. And like, specifically when I say yuga ecosystem, I do mean bored apes.
00:24:57.994 - 00:25:26.026, Speaker B: People are using ip rights to other side. Yeah, no, I agree with that. Right. And so, so my, my next little point here, and we've riffed on it a little bit, what is the staying power of flowing protocol? I think that they have found. We said this last week, right. Fractionalization has been attempted by multiple projects that it just has never had any staying power. Fluorine protocol comes in and they're having a huge month.
00:25:26.026 - 00:25:42.200, Speaker B: Right? Like they're, they're all time high for 24 hours. Volume is like over 6 million. Um, they. What is it here in my notes, I have, uh, this is from Saturday. Blur did $25 million worth of NFT volume. Opensea did $5.4 million worth of volume.
00:25:42.200 - 00:26:01.784, Speaker B: And then flooring pro protocol did $4.2 million worth of volume. That's pretty impressive. Like this. This platform has only been around for a month and now we're seeing, obviously Blur is dominating the volume game. But this also came out right after the blur announcement. Right? So blur season three is kicking off.
00:26:01.784 - 00:26:21.064, Speaker B: It's very difficult to differentiate in between what is actual authentic NFT volume. Like somebody saying, I want that NFT versus people saying, oh, no, I'm going to take advantage of Pac man and blur and all of the incentivizations that are coming out of the blur ecosystem. Right.
00:26:21.764 - 00:27:26.620, Speaker A: I mean, I think this is a perfect time to just like, pull this up because it's not only across like NFT volume, we're also seeing this across lending volume. How much of this is actual organic. Like people actually wanting to borrow. And like, I think it boils down to this is all incentive driven. I think this is fascinating that majority of people who buy, you know, NFTs on Opensea, generally they go and they pick one, they select it, they buy it, and then they hold it for more than 30 days. Whereas on blur, we're just seeing the same nfts on the floor being, you know, rinse, repeat. Oh, when we think about the staying power of something like flooring protocol, I think it's going to be something where the people who actually have use case and like, want to fractionalize or fragment their nfts, they'll still utilize it, you know, make a separate wallet, clean it up.
00:27:26.620 - 00:28:06.994, Speaker A: But I think, like, majority of folks, it's going to be a product that's probably a bit too complicated. Like, if you think about it, like, if, if we were to say NFT fi in general at the very top, the thing that everyone understands is buying and selling nfts, great. And then the layer below that, borrowing and lending, great. Like that, I feel like is already having like some hard time picking up organic traction. And then you take it a step further and you go to fragmentation and it's like, I think the actual audience for folks that are like, how can I take advantage of this? It's. It's kind of limited outside of a bull run right now.
00:28:07.114 - 00:28:47.952, Speaker B: Well, and see, that's. I think that's kind of the main point right here is like, what happens when we see a bull run, right? Like, I think that people that want to get some exposure to these blue chip nfts that don't have 30 ETH laying around and they're like, yo, I believe in bored apes, but I don't have 30 ETH. But I do have four ETH. They could buy four ETH worth of mew BAYC. And I think that becomes like a very, that's a, that's a great use case. And I'm very bullish on that. Like, I think even maybe not necessarily in pfps because, like, I think bored apes, well, yuga and like, other people would have to kind of cater to that, but more so in like, generative art, right? Like, I'm a big time believer in chromie squiggles.
00:28:47.952 - 00:29:19.852, Speaker B: So, like, if they do crummy squiggles, fractionalization, like, that becomes a very interesting, like, opportunity for people. But this is where we'll get into this in a little bit. But ETH ETH gas fees are just ridiculous. Like, I freaking hate ETH gas fees. And I just don't. That's where I just, like, why is this being built on, on ETH? Like if we're doing fractionalization, you aren't even actually transacting, like the actual NFT. You're just buying mew tokens.
00:29:19.852 - 00:29:35.740, Speaker B: Like, why, why couldn't you do this on an ethel too, and then use like mew tokens like a wrapper to, you get me? Like this is a wrapped version of that. But it, like, it all goes back to main net. But like, I just don't, I don't understand that.
00:29:35.772 - 00:30:15.322, Speaker A: So do you. So when it comes to like l two s and really just like the multi chain universe because there's so many different blockchains, if you think about it, I kind of wonder if people are hesitant to go to l two s because it's hard to onboard folks to l two s. I think, like, literally the only reason why folks are onboarding, I'm going to put this in quotes. Onboarding to blast is because of this airdrop that we know is coming and that we know is going to print some money. How much, we have no idea. But like if, can you imagine if like flooring protocol launched on arbitrum first?
00:30:15.378 - 00:30:15.874, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:30:15.954 - 00:30:32.108, Speaker A: Instead of ETH? Like there's no nfts over there or. Yeah, not, not to my knowledge. But it's like the NFT community is on ETH. I feel like builders have to start with ETH and then they can always expand to multiple EVM chains pretty easily.
00:30:32.276 - 00:30:55.268, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, and see, this is kind of what we've seen with NFT fi native protocols, right? Like NFT perps. Right. NfT perp and tribe three both exist on ethel two s. Why? Well, because gas fees on ethel twos are way cheaper. So you're not wasting money in transactions and you're not trading the NFT. Right? Like, you're not, like, there is no provenance of holding, like a fractionalized piece of something.
00:30:55.268 - 00:31:21.478, Speaker B: Like, you're not, you're not betting on provenance, right? Like this is not an authentic chrome squiggle that you're holding your old, you're holding four ETH worth of mute chromie squiggles. Like, I just don't, I, that's where I kind of think it. The provenance thing at this point. Like, will the blue chip nft stay on ETH Mainet? Sure. Yeah. Like, I do agree with that. But why we're seeing this with blast, right? Like prior to blast.
00:31:21.478 - 00:31:33.928, Speaker B: Like pre. Yeah, pre blast. Before blast bb, like pre blast, we didn't have a lot of people onboarding to Ethel twos, to your point, right?
00:31:34.056 - 00:31:34.576, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:34.680 - 00:32:06.118, Speaker B: On, on base, we've seen like some uptick, like people were interested in front tech and friendpet and like all these other like niche kind of projects over on base. So I think base is, it has like a community over there. And to be fair, like it's probably the best ETH l two I've used like in terms of like usability and ux and stuff like that. Like, I've had a really easy time dealing with all of those. Um, but yeah, outside of blast, like, there really hasn't been a huge, huge, huge pull for people to start depositing over into ethel two s. Yeah.
00:32:06.166 - 00:32:58.444, Speaker A: Unless you're a defi guy or gal, you know, like that's literally when I look at the communities on other l two s specifically, it's usually like defi opportunities that exist. They're not necessarily nFt opportunities. And I think, like you mentioned that, you know, if I had some Chromie squiggle mew tokens, like, it's not necessarily on an l two, it's not necessarily the provenance I'm betting on. I think, like the whole point of being able to have exposure to the collection is because of the provenance. It wouldn't matter if it was like mew tokens on, you know, blast. If they end up launching on blast or mew tokens on polygon or arbitrum, whatever. It's like, as long as I have exposure to the actual thing at the end of the day, even if it is a derivative on a different chain, I don't think that necessarily matters.
00:32:58.444 - 00:33:11.188, Speaker A: I think it's more about who right now in the NFT community would be like, oh yeah, let me go set up this whole new network just so I can buy some fragmented tokens.
00:33:11.316 - 00:33:28.884, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely a chicken and egg problem, right? Are we going to see liquidity? Are we going to see users? And it's like, well, the users aren't over there, so there's no liquidity, but then there's going to be liquidity. Somebody has to take the, take the step and I think that's what blast has done, so I guess we can finally talk about it.
00:33:29.004 - 00:34:05.314, Speaker A: Oh God. Where, where shall we start? Well, let's start with blur and season two and a little bit of what happened there. So basically on the 20th November 20, blur season two ended and we saw a ton of folks get airdropped. I think the biggest airdrop for the top farmer was like $7 million, something obscene like that. And then we also saw blur token pump. And then along with season two ending, of course, season three was announced. So blur season three is completely powered by blast.
00:34:05.314 - 00:34:39.386, Speaker A: So instead of earning blur tokens, you're going to be earning, we don't know if they're called blast tokens, but we're just going to call them blast tokens. They keep referring it to as redacted from blast. So season three powered by blast, it's going to end in May of next year. So it's six months. And the way the airdrop is working is it's actually a 50 50 split for blurry users. Half of the airdrop is going to go to blur holders, people who are just holding the token and staking it. And then the other half will go to what they're calling the quote unquote traders.
00:34:39.386 - 00:35:25.794, Speaker A: So people who have been bidding, listing, lending, doing all the things to earn all the blur. I think this is pretty funny because last week we talked about this. It's like, one is the price pumping on blur market manipulation. Two is the price going to absolutely tank after everyone gets airdropped because they're going to be like, I have losses that I need to realize and I need to sell this token and get the fuck out. I don't know what Pac man did, but he like, found some magic hat and like, pull the rabbit out of it and was like, yo, if you hold your blur tokens, you're going to get airdropped. Another token for this l two called blast. And it worked.
00:35:25.794 - 00:35:37.202, Speaker A: It worked. I am. All my blur tokens are staked right now. And I just hit my like, first million holder points. Like, he is gamified the crap out of this.
00:35:37.338 - 00:36:14.492, Speaker B: See, this is, I just posted the chart for screen sharing here that I last week said, I think this tanks and this is a perfect use case for 100 x short. This is where you go heavy. I was completely fucking wrong. Like, and I think something that they did really well here is saying, like, okay, we have blur holders. Because like, there was no incentive to hold blur right before this. Blur holders were kind of left out in the wind. So then, like, for me, for instance, I had blur tokens, but I wasn't doing anything with it.
00:36:14.492 - 00:36:36.638, Speaker B: I wasn't bidding on nfts, I wasn't giving out loans. So, like, I was completely left out of the airdrop. I think I made like 300 blur tokens and I was like, well, thanks. Like, what the fuck am I going to do with this, right? And then I can't even claim them because fucking ETH, gas prices. Gas prices are so freaking expensive. And my 330 blur tokens are, like, spread out across five fucking wallets. Oh.
00:36:36.638 - 00:36:58.046, Speaker B: And I was just like, yeah, this isn't even worth it. Like, it's not even worth it. So what they did a very good job of, I think, is saying, like, okay, now we're going to split this 50 50. We're still going to get the action of farmers because, like, there's going to be less farmers than there were before, I think, in that. In that sphere. Because, like, I don't know, like, you could just buy steak and hold blur. Like, there.
00:36:58.046 - 00:37:22.512, Speaker B: There's no reason to take on additional risk. There's still going to be people that do it. So, like, those people are going to probably print, but then it's also giving people the opportunity to hold blur. And then now people don't want to sell because they're going to stake their blur. So they, they hit this sweet spot here of saying, like, all we're going to have to do is tell you to buy something and then hold it and don't sell it. And what's going to happen? Well, price went up, so.
00:37:22.688 - 00:37:41.172, Speaker A: Yeah, because there's no longer a fuck ton of selling pressure and there is a reason to hold now apart from, uh, what do they call it, the Blur foundation governance. Because I don't know about you, but I hold blur and I have not checked out the governance form once because I'm like, what is this? You know what I mean?
00:37:41.308 - 00:37:44.264, Speaker B: Huge governance guy. I'm just kidding. I'm not.
00:37:45.524 - 00:37:53.836, Speaker A: And, okay, so blur season two ends, blast. This l two gets announced. Let me, let me throw this.
00:37:53.940 - 00:37:55.396, Speaker B: It's not an l two yet.
00:37:55.580 - 00:38:17.380, Speaker A: Not. Yes, this is correct. Blast is not live yet. So you can see I have a few points. I have very, very baby amount of points compared to a lot of folks on the platform. But the whole idea around blast, at least from Pac Man's announcement, was to pretty much solve, like, two problems. Number 1, da, you've been saying this all day.
00:38:17.380 - 00:39:08.386, Speaker A: Gas fees on ETH are outrageous. Like, we lose so much money just paying to transact. So that was one of his first grievances. The second one was he felt that he could not create an institutional grade NFT platform on top of ETH for this reason. And then the third thing, which I actually thought was interesting, was just all about increasing capital efficiency, where the native token of this blockchain is going to be earning yield. So how it works is right now you could bridge Ethan to blast, and if you bridge ETH to blast, that ETH is actually earning yield. Because what blast is doing, or I guess I should say the blast multisig is doing, is they're taking that ETH, depositing it into Lido, which is an ETH staking platform.
00:39:08.386 - 00:39:35.394, Speaker A: And so you earn 4% on the ETH that you bridge over. And then if you bridge over stable coins that's getting deposited into makerdao and earning about 5% yield. So this whole idea that natively, if you have assets on this l two, you're earning yield, I actually think is pretty ingenious, and I'm surprised it actually hasn't been done before. So it's cool to see that aspect and element of it.
00:39:36.374 - 00:40:08.100, Speaker B: No, look, I posted about this last week. Like, as soon as we, I can add this here. This was my tweet from last week. Like, as soon as it came out, little to no ability for institutions to get involved with nfts at this point. Gas on ETH is fucking stupid, which I've said multiple times on this podcast already, but it's provenance, bro. I sincerely don't care, especially if we're talking about whether it be fractionalization or anything else. Like, I think, like I said, Gennar and like, the heavy hitters are going to stay on ETH mainnet, but interacting with these things can be delegated to Ethel twos at this point.
00:40:08.100 - 00:40:32.976, Speaker B: Like, I just think that it's a much smarter way to go about it. And then using basic ETH to denominate everything that we're doing on ETH, or even soul for that matter. Like, I just don't really understand ETH went to proof of stake when it's been a long time, right? And like, we have not been using staked ETH for anything right now.
00:40:33.040 - 00:40:53.632, Speaker A: There are, well, there, I will say there are money markets that allow you to, to deposit staked ETH. Um, and then you can actually borrow staked ETH sometimes at a lower, like borrow Apy than ETH in certain money markets. So, like, yeah, but it should, it.
00:40:53.648 - 00:41:33.972, Speaker B: Should be the normal. It should be the normal. Like, why are we sitting here when we could be sitting on 4% when we're not? Because, no reason. I just, it's not integrated, right? And like, even say NFT lending, why aren't we doing this in NFT lending? Like, it's just, it's a, it's a very easy reach. Now, I think that the reason is, and I've talked to NFT lending platforms about this. The reason that they aren't offering loans in Steve is because the. The borrower who is like, these are borrower centric markets, right? The borrower is then going to have to take their steth, switch it to ETH, and pay that gas fee, and then go to use it however they want to use it right now.
00:41:33.972 - 00:42:01.974, Speaker B: This wouldn't be a problem if Steve was the base asset for trading NFTs right now. I'm sure there's a whole nother list of problems that would come from using Steve as, like, the base asset, but I just think it just makes so much more sense and then that with gas fees, I just think that blast knocked this one out of the park in terms of the announcement. So let's see what happens.
00:42:02.914 - 00:42:37.720, Speaker A: I think there's a lot to dig into here. So for those of you guys who don't know, there's, like, basically two ways to farm the blast airdrop. One, you bridge your assets and you deposit it onto blast, which, like Dalton said, does not exist right now. So you're sending money to this multi sig that's held by the blast team, and then they're manually taking your ETH and your stable coins and depositing it into yield opportunities via Lido and makerdao. Second way to farm it is via blur. And I think, dalton, you are spot on. Like, I was thinking about this.
00:42:37.720 - 00:43:16.374, Speaker A: Like, if I were to onboard anyone into crypto, like, how cool would it be if I was able to onboard someone to blast? And it's like, yeah, oh, you put a $100 here. That hundred dollars is, like, natively earning 4% yield because you're on this blockchain, and that's just how it works. I think, like, that is smart and appealing, but I think there's been a lot of, like, fud, more or less that has come out in the last couple of days since this has been announced. And I'd love to chat with you about some of it. Curious as to your thoughts. What do you think about a multi sig having, like, $500 million of assets in it?
00:43:17.074 - 00:43:43.798, Speaker B: I. Dude, I'm definitely not middle curving this because I'm just like, yeah, whatever, it's Pac man. Like, I sent money over there, right? Like, I just think that there are certain people that I trust and there's certain people that I don't right now. I think Pac man has done enough to show that, hey, like, he's completely. He's ready for that challenge. It's backed by some heavy hitters. I trust it enough.
00:43:43.798 - 00:44:18.886, Speaker B: Right? Like, now, that's not me saying I'm putting 100% of my portfolio in there. There is this massive lockup period. Like, lockup period. I don't know where that northeastern accent came from. I'm from California, but there's this massive lockup period that you can't withdraw funds until February. So that, that the fact that they got 500 million plus to get sent to a multisig, I think it just goes to show, hey, we trusted Pac man. The dude has built a shit ton of stuff that, and he has, like, this mercenary type attitude where you just know that he's going to, like, look at the.
00:44:18.886 - 00:44:34.386, Speaker B: The opportunities that exist in whatever ecosystem, whether it be nfts defi l two s, and then it goes at them. And I think it is attractive. And it also, like, it. This is going to be a multi billion dollar token when it drops, right?
00:44:34.410 - 00:44:35.746, Speaker A: Like, easily.
00:44:35.890 - 00:44:36.842, Speaker B: Yeah, easily.
00:44:36.978 - 00:45:08.264, Speaker A: It's the day the token drops. It will be immediately competitive with the other l two s that exist and already have, like, this massive user base day one. I mean, I agree with you. I really could care less about the multi seg. I understand, like, it's a security risk and consideration, but I'm like, yeah, I'm not fucking mid curbing this. Like, I think bags will be made. Even if they're baby bags, those baby bags will be worth something.
00:45:08.264 - 00:45:48.518, Speaker A: But you mentioned something about, like, his mercenary attitude. And I think this is actually a pretty interesting conversation to have. Like, closed source versus open source. Like, how do we feel about the vampirism that we're seeing? Because I remember when I was at the NFT lending protocol that I worked for for a bit, we wanted to very much integrate with blur, but we were just kind of met with, like, roadblock after roadblock. The team wasn't really interested. I've heard other NFT lending builders in the space basically be like, yeah, Blur told us that if they're interested in something, they're going to build it themselves and build it in house. So I'm trying to.
00:45:48.518 - 00:46:06.646, Speaker A: I have, like, mixed feelings on this about, like, where does that leave the space? Like, who is actually even going to be able to build on top of blast? Because there is an airdrop for developers too. But it's like, that is gated. It's not open. You have to apply to build there. Like, what are. What are we actually going to see?
00:46:06.830 - 00:47:11.102, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and it's kind of counter, counter crypto culture. Like, everything is open source here, right? And I think that it's this weird catch 22 where people are like, fuck Pac man, but I love Pac man, and I just don't really know, like, I understand where he's coming from, right? Like they've, they've shown that, like, okay, we're going to go at people, we're going to have these loyalty points. We're going to say, like, don't use foreign protocol, don't use Opensea. And now he's building an l two. And this is what I was saying in the notes, right? Like, what happens when the token drops? And then they're going to come up with some other incentive and they're going to be like, if you fucking bridge to arbitram, you're not getting anything. Then what happens? Like arbitrum TVL drops and then blast tvl like they're robbing, they're robbing TVL from other l two s. And then you have these other dapps that exist on arbitrum and optimism that, like I said, it's almost like an opportunity cost not to be on blast because you get this native 4% yield and they're taking advantage of it, right? And no other Ethel two is going to be able to compete with that.
00:47:11.102 - 00:47:51.864, Speaker B: So then other people are going to be like, well, fuck. Like, I need to build on blast because I need to. Because it's an opportunity cost that I'm missing out on. What, what gives here? Like, I just, I really, really, really don't know because the Ethel two ecosystem is going to get absolutely shattered, I think. Because, like, blast is just going to be extremely, like, mercantistic about, like, what they're doing and they're going to tear down whatever they can. And then on top of that, like we saw within NFT lending, NFT lending, NFT marketplaces, what happens when they go at, like, the LST platforms, like Lido, right? Like they're going to build it themselves. They're just going to launch their own LST.
00:47:52.404 - 00:48:25.260, Speaker A: But I do, I feel like to your point, yes, there's a lot of volume. Yes, they've taken up a lot of market share. But, like, how much of that is farming versus organic? And I, like, let me see if I can find it. Like, right here. Like, if we look at blur versus opensea, like, you can see here that, like, yes, blur has the volume, but look, Opensea is still dominating with more daily active, unique users than blur.
00:48:25.452 - 00:48:30.660, Speaker B: And so that is a very interesting chart, dude.
00:48:30.692 - 00:49:04.584, Speaker A: And even if we look at NFT lending, like, yes. Have they dominated the NFT lending space 100%. But like, how much of that loan volume is actually organic versus people just being like, I'm trying to max out my points. Yeah. Because like, the way blend is designed, which is their NFT, their NFT lending feature, it's like you can get out of those loans after 30 hours as a lender. So it's like very easy to take that capital and like just keep recycling it to like farm points. But it pumps the numbers.
00:49:05.604 - 00:49:31.412, Speaker B: I think that was because there wasn't any real product market fit. Like, there was product market fit in the fact that they built like a trader, a pro trader NFT marketplace. But like, blur existed before. They like, absolutely annihilated opensea via, like, hey, we're going to zero marketplace fees, we're going to zero royalties. Like it existed before and there was not very much traction. Right. And so then they said, all right, fuck it.
00:49:31.412 - 00:49:44.344, Speaker B: We got to ramp up the incentives. And then incentives went up and then all of a sudden blur usage went up. Right. And then blend came out. And like, how many people were nft lending before blend? Like, like not a whole load.
00:49:44.764 - 00:49:47.468, Speaker A: Literally like 8000 wallets.
00:49:47.636 - 00:50:23.022, Speaker B: Yeah. And that, that was how many of those people, like myself, that have 15 wallets that were taking part in like multiple protocols. Yeah. And so then the difference here, I think, is that blast is like, I think blast could potentially have some hardcore product market fit where people look at it and say like, fuck, dude, I'm not making 4% because I'm not making 4%. And then the Dapps and developers and builders are all going to go over there because they want to take advantage of that. Right? I don't know that that's just kind of like my hunch, but I don't.
00:50:23.038 - 00:50:25.198, Speaker A: Think it's the worst thing. I don't.
00:50:25.246 - 00:50:26.998, Speaker B: No, I don't either. Yeah.
00:50:27.046 - 00:51:32.774, Speaker A: Like, and I, when I look at like, the arbitrum foundation and, like, optimism and even like, polygon, like, they have their own reward system and grant system for incentivizing builders to come over there. Maybe it's like more of a, we need to change the way we market and we need to, like, really ramp up on dev relations to make sure, like, our builders stay here and they feel taken care of. Because I think on the flip side, while Blast will be incredibly disruptive to the l two space, it goes back to my question, like, who is actually going to be able to build on blast? Because like I said, right now, you have to apply. Like, do you think Blast is going to let an NFT perp protocol build on top of it when it is pretty much spelled out and laid out that they will be launching their own NFT per protocol on blast be a blur. Like I think that gatekeeping, like I think that's going to be more damaging than anything else. Like be mercenary. Like try to grab the market share, pump your numbers.
00:51:32.774 - 00:52:07.862, Speaker A: So when you go to raise your next round or raise again from VC's you have like really pretty numbers to point at. But at the same time it's like I don't know who's actually going to go and build on blast because I don't know who's going to be allowed to. I think out of the entire NFT and web3 ecosystem, or at least I'll say the NFT ecosystem that I've seen, like everything that Pac man has done has probably been like the most black box, most convoluted, most centralized way. But I don't think people care right now because again, the incentive is there.
00:52:08.038 - 00:52:55.034, Speaker B: Yeah. And like this exists throughout life, right. This isn't just crypto specific, but like your greatest strength is your greatest weakness and your greatest weakness is your greatest strength, right? Like I just think that that like at some point blur blast blend is going to shoot itself in the foot with being so anti community or something's going to have to give at some point, right? Like, yeah, they're going to get too big and they're going to try to build too many things and then there's going to be a security risk or something. Right. They're just going to have their hands in too many, too many baskets and not be focused on and they'll make, miss something, right. Something, something will fuck up. And we haven't seen them be put in a position to course correct that much yet, but we'll see.
00:52:55.034 - 00:53:33.450, Speaker B: We've been talking about a bull run. What happens in a bull run? Does blur stay as competitive as they are right now? And if they're trying to be this massive net that's catching every single opportunity, how many investors do you know that try to do this right where they're just like, oh, fuck, that's pumping, I'm going to sell this and go to that. Oh, this is good. And like they, they go to so many different things and then they don't do anything, right. They, they end up shooting themselves in the foot. Yeah, I wonder, yeah, I wonder if that kind of happens to, to blur at some point. Like that's speculating on months and months and months from now, but, uh, it is, it's it's an interesting kind of debacle that they've created.
00:53:33.642 - 00:53:56.774, Speaker A: Totally. And, I mean, one other thing. On the topic of Pac man and everything that he's doing, I do think it's worth showing Dan Robinson. So this is the lawyer guy. Lawyer in research. A lawyer guy. Well, look, coder slash lawyer research at Paradigm.
00:53:56.774 - 00:54:28.804, Speaker A: So the TLDR here I went through and I read it. Basically, it's like, oh, at paradigm, you know, when we saw the marketing, we felt like it crossed a line. And we definitely have concerns and we're talking to the team about it. But ultimately, at the end of the day, we invest in founders that we believe in. And, you know, they're independent. We trust them to build what they're going to build. I feel like this became a pretty big, like, talking point of a lot of the fudge.
00:54:28.804 - 00:55:02.250, Speaker A: Honestly, my thoughts are, it doesn't really matter. I kind of feel like that kind of announcement coming out from paradigm is one to cover them from a legal basis. Because, dude, the amount of memes, if I had, like, a dollar for every time I saw a meme on my timeline, that was just like, ponzi scheme. And then, like, someone slapping a sticker on it and being like, backed by paradigm. Or, like, tell me this, pants ten. And it's like, oh, it's backed by paradigm. I almost feel like I'm putting my marketing hat on.
00:55:02.250 - 00:55:23.628, Speaker A: It's just, it's a, it's a response to make sure folks know. It's like, oh, we don't necessarily condone this, but at the end of the day, like, they do what you want. Yeah, like, do what you want. So our legal bases are covered. Like, yeah, I think it's just noise, but I did want to bring it up because it has, like, over a million views and people have been talking about it.
00:55:23.746 - 00:55:50.182, Speaker B: Dude, it is kind of interesting, right? Like how they, they had to say something and, like, blur. Blur dumped after everything. And I think it's just, like you said, I think it's just the. They're trying to save, like, the PR side of them saying, like, hey, like, we. We don't agree with this, but, like, do what you want. And then, like, legally they're like, hey, we didn't. We didn't think it would go this far, right? But, like, at the end of the.
00:55:50.198 - 00:55:52.438, Speaker A: Day, does it make them money?
00:55:52.566 - 00:55:58.502, Speaker B: No. Exactly. Like, their hands are in the bucket. They're like, hey, don't look at us. And I'm like, come on, bro.
00:55:58.638 - 00:56:23.224, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, like, people just need to remember that, like, VC's are great. I love reading VC research. I think there are some really, really smart VC's out there, at least on the research side of things. And I learn a lot. But ultimately, at the end of the day, they need to make money for their investors who have given them money to invest. And so, you know, Pac Man's printed for them before.
00:56:23.224 - 00:56:25.872, Speaker A: He's probably going to print for them again.
00:56:26.008 - 00:56:42.200, Speaker B: Yeah, no, exactly. No. So. Well, kind of going in line with that, we said Ponzi. Right, Ponzi. Yesterday there was an NFT five spaces hosted by one of our friends, Eddie. I think they had like 600 concurrent listeners at one point.
00:56:42.200 - 00:56:55.034, Speaker B: Like the dude just absolutely crushed it. He crushed it with marketing. Like, he just did a really, really good job of getting people over there. Um, one of the big themes was like people calling it a Ponzi and like a lot of mid curving going on and people are just.
00:56:55.074 - 00:56:56.194, Speaker A: Versus. Pyramid.
00:56:56.314 - 00:57:10.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Like they're like, this is a pyramid scheme they're trying to get. And he's like, dude, this is a referral program. This, these exist in other places. Like, you refer us somebody and we give you money and it's like, whatever. Right? Like, I just don't think it's that big of a deal. Like the multi sig part of it.
00:57:10.834 - 00:57:14.038, Speaker B: Yes. Like that's kind of, I guess there's five.
00:57:14.166 - 00:57:28.894, Speaker A: It's a little bit of like a security concern, but it's also like a little, a tiny bit. But it's honestly, it's in a multi seg, at least. It's not like a. You only need two confirmations out of five. Multi say.
00:57:28.934 - 00:57:42.628, Speaker B: Well, and, and people sent. What's that guy's name? Brian Armstrong. Yeah, people sent him. Boy. Yeah, dude, people send him millions and millions of dollars and that's just straight to his wallet. Like so not.
00:57:42.756 - 00:57:44.156, Speaker A: And then ETH too.
00:57:44.220 - 00:57:45.924, Speaker B: Yeah, Ben ETH another one.
00:57:46.084 - 00:57:49.724, Speaker A: Slew of them where it's like millions and millions just got sent.
00:57:49.844 - 00:58:03.540, Speaker B: Send me money. And then people are like, all right, I'm going to do it. Whatever. Yeah, exactly. So I think going into this NFT finance spaces, 600 concurrent listeners. Yes. There are some big dogs over there.
00:58:03.540 - 00:58:20.808, Speaker B: Stats is over there. Gabriel Layden. Um, there was some, some heavy hitters that were kind of talking about it. I know FUBAR had some, some comments on it and they were kind of negative comments. So, like, I think that also made people interested as well. Um. Did you actually spoke on it as well? I was listening, but I was also on a date.
00:58:20.808 - 00:58:21.400, Speaker B: So.
00:58:21.552 - 00:58:23.296, Speaker A: Oh, my God. You were listening.
00:58:23.400 - 00:58:33.354, Speaker B: No, I was. I was on a date. I was on a date, and I looked at it, and I was like, fuck. I. I was supposed to, like, Eddie told me, yo, come speak on this. And I was like, ah, fuck, I'm on a date. Like, I'm not gonna do this.
00:58:33.354 - 00:58:37.074, Speaker B: So then I cut the date, and then I came back home.
00:58:37.154 - 00:58:40.494, Speaker A: And then you cut a date for a Twitter.
00:58:40.794 - 00:58:57.622, Speaker B: We went to dinner. Like, it wasn't like. It wasn't like I left her hanging and I was just like, hey. Like, I got work, and she's like, oh, like, are you speaking on a podcast? I'm like, basically. Exactly. So I came running home, and then, like, I missed, like, an hour and a half of it. It.
00:58:57.622 - 00:58:58.998, Speaker B: So. But you were on there.
00:58:59.126 - 00:59:37.146, Speaker A: I was on there, um, for the beginning when we were just more or less, like, talking about blast. Same thing, ponzi stuff. Uh, there was a point where not Ed, sorry, David from Meta street was on there, and I've spoken to David before. He is so smart. Like, such a gigabrained guy. But, like, I can only follow him, like, 30 or 40% of the time because it gets, like, very, very, like, what I would consider technical from a finance perspective. And I'm like, I just jot down notes of, like, I need to go look this up later to make sure I understand what he's talking about.
00:59:37.146 - 00:59:56.784, Speaker A: So it was. I actually really enjoyed the space. I thought it was great. I think it's awesome to see anytime there's something where we are seeing a bunch of people take interest in NFT fi. I think it's fucking bullish. Like, we're in the NFT fi illuminati chat. There's, like, only, like, 400 of us in there.
00:59:56.784 - 01:00:10.532, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a super small community. Like, I would say maybe only, like, 80 active users. Like, messaging in the telegram a day. And so it's nice to see this be the center stage of conversation.
01:00:10.708 - 01:00:37.912, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I had a post earlier today where I was like, okay, this is, like, my one main takeaway here is we had 600 concurrent listeners. I am deep, deep in the space. Like, I've been. I've been researching NFT five for over 15 months now. Like, I am extremely deep in the NFT fi ecosystem. And I was confused. I was like, dude, what the fuck are they talking about? I'm like, this is way too over my head.
01:00:37.912 - 01:01:33.776, Speaker B: And I'm like, this is crazy for somebody that has spent the last 15 months researching this. And this has been, like, one of my main areas of research. And I was still like, dude, dude, I'm not tracking. Um, and so we talked about this a little bit earlier, right, with, like, ETH NFT holders and the way that people kind of interact with the blockchain to go from ETH NFTs and being like, a holder of Azuki or pudgy penguins or d gods or whatever, and then to take the massive leap over to NFT fight, that's a huge jump, right? And I think that just my main takeaway is we need to dumb this down. And I think that we, we said this on the first podcast. Like, neither of us come from a traditional finance background, which I think is helpful because both of us are extremely curious and we like to learn and we like going in on these things, but we, we have to approach it from a non finance background because I'm not going to sit here and be like, apr this and that. Like, some people don't even know what APR is.
01:01:33.776 - 01:01:52.272, Speaker B: So, like, me saying something like, you, you have to be able to break it down. And I think that that's something that we're missing also, like Gabriel said, like, uh, a bunch of this shit is illegal in the real world. And I think we're just protected because it's, like, digital. Nobody knows what the fuck's going on. So, um, it is kind of crazy.
01:01:52.448 - 01:02:36.704, Speaker A: I mean, one, I think that's a huge reason why you and I connected of, like, let's like, talk about this. Let's break this down, like, separately outside of our podcast. Like, I do try to do videos where I'm like, okay, I learned about real world world assets. What were the key takeaways that I have? And it's like, how can I boil this down into very, very simple language that people understand? So I think we're starting to see it. Like, you know, hopefully people will find some of the content that we put out helpful. But the other thing, too is, it is I don't think people realize how early NFT fi is. And then, you know, if you're like me and you're like, everything is coming on chain.
01:02:36.704 - 01:03:09.800, Speaker A: Like, we live in a digital age. Money is going to be digital. Everything that we own will be digital. Like, NFT fi is going to be a massive part of the rails of what actually makes this new economy work. And so I know, like, some people have feelings about NFT lending, and honestly, a lot of what I get is, like, they're like, it just leverage sounds scary, and I don't want to touch it. Like, that's what I'm seeing a lot from retail. Um, and then I think it's going to come down to education and marketing.
01:03:09.800 - 01:03:35.766, Speaker A: And also, instead of being like, yeah, we're going to give you triple yield because x, y z. It's like I tell protocols this all the time. Like, you need to boil it down to a sentence. It needs to be feature slash benefit marketing. You need to constantly market your benefits, not necessarily your features, if that makes sense. Yeah, it's like, get cash instantly. And people are like, okay, like, that makes sense to me.
01:03:35.766 - 01:03:45.314, Speaker A: Like, how does this work? And then it's like, well, we have a feature that does this. And that seems to have resonated very well in, in my experience in history.
01:03:45.654 - 01:04:21.210, Speaker B: No, dude, this is like, I worked with Sam at proof. Sam, NFT statistics, right? And, and when I first started there, like, one of my big hang ups was like, I would try to explain this, and I'm like, this is crazy because this and that and this and that and this and that. And he's like, dude, you're like, throwing a bunch of, like, abbreviations at me. This is like an acronym. I don't even know what the fuck that means. And it really stuck with me because stats has grown immensely since he started at proof, and it's something that I really respect. And yesterday as I was listening to the Twitter spaces, I was like, brother is too much.
01:04:21.210 - 01:04:24.050, Speaker B: This is too much and we need to. Good.
01:04:24.162 - 01:04:33.994, Speaker A: Well, where did you get lost? I'm curious because I, like, missed. I had to jump like 2 hours and to go make dinner. But like, where, where do you feel like your hangups were?
01:04:34.154 - 01:04:54.806, Speaker B: Well, when we were talking about infrastructure, like blockchain infrastructure in general, I think that there's like, very, very techy people and then there's like, normal people. Right? Okay. Like, yeah, exactly. So it's like them talking about like, okay, well, this is the blockchain. This is actually how it works. And this isn't how it works. And like, people were tweeting about it like, fubar half the time.
01:04:54.806 - 01:05:25.376, Speaker B: Fubar tweets, anything. I'm just like, I don't know what the fuck that means. Right? And so I'm like, when, when we're talking about that or we're trying to describe where yield comes from or drawing that. Like, David drawing comparisons to, like, the 2008 market crash and things like that. Like, I was like, okay, I'm following this. How does this have anything to do with nfts and easy to access yield? Yeah, like, we're throwing out a bunch of numbers here, and I don't know where we're at on the timeline anymore. Right.
01:05:25.376 - 01:05:38.564, Speaker B: Like that, that is very confusing. And I think if you go to a protocol or you go to NFT holders and you say, hey, you could stake your, your NFT and you can make 4.8%.
01:05:39.184 - 01:05:39.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:39.624 - 01:05:57.444, Speaker B: Like even that, which is a very, very simple sentence for people that are, like, in the NFT ecosystem, stake. Like, there's a lot of people that have staking and now 4.8%, they don't necessarily need to know where it comes from. Right. They, they don't care. They just see stake and make 4.8%. Right.
01:05:57.484 - 01:05:57.988, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:58.116 - 01:06:40.576, Speaker B: Now what? Like, how do we kind of invite in normies? How do we invite in NFT holders? Like, for somebody to buy a digital picture on the Internet, it is extremely, extremely. We are like early adopters times five. Right? Like, we're so early to that space. So then when we talk about NFT finance or real world assets on chain and any of this other stuff, like, dude, that is like the early adopters of the early adopters. Right? Like, you're pushing some very, very curious folks into this place because they think that they can make money now. We see the infrastructure, we see how this is all going to kind of develop over the next, say, year, two years. Right.
01:06:40.576 - 01:06:48.968, Speaker B: But we need to make it more inviting because, like the, the 18 paragraph breakdowns of, like, the white papers.
01:06:49.016 - 01:06:51.128, Speaker A: Yeah, I might do the GitHub docs.
01:06:51.176 - 01:06:54.256, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm like, bro, too much. Too much.
01:06:54.400 - 01:08:05.284, Speaker A: So this is where, you know, you know, I'm an advisor to kettle, which is like, they're building an RWA peer to peer lending marketplace, but specifically for rwas. I, too, have been in the space for a while, and it wasn't until I told my partner about, like, hey, imagine, you know, you had a luxury handbag that was gifted to you from your great grandmother, and you inherited it, and it's like, worth $200,000. Like, instead of selling that luxury handbag or going to a pawn shop trying to get a loan, we could actually send this to a vault, make an NFT out of it, and then you can go and use that NFT to get a loan and treat it like a line of credit. And for the first time since I've entered web3, I just saw it kind of click for her. And I think that's what gets me really, really excited about not necessarily the traditional finance, real world assets. That's definitely something you have to pay attention to. Um, because that's where I think a bulk of the money is going to be in terms of, like, capital actually being deployed.
01:08:05.284 - 01:08:44.628, Speaker A: But for us everyday people, it's this idea of, like, what exists in our day to day life that can come on chain and then, like, how can we benefit or leverage it being on chain, right? And like, that, explaining that is so much easier than me going and being like, well, this PFP gives me, like, utility to community events. It's worth this. And like, I might get an airdrop and there's speculative value and I can borrow against it, because then it's just like, dude, magic Internet money is doing magic Internet money stuff. But like, am I making sense?
01:08:44.716 - 01:09:34.426, Speaker B: No, yeah, of course, of course. Well, that's, that's what I was saying. Like, that we are the early adopters of, like, if you've bought a JPEG and you thought there was any value to it, like, you are leaps and bounds ahead of other people. Yeah, that's just buying a JPeg right now. There's this entire fucking ecosystem of, like, what is staking and what are blockchains and what are, like, why can't you bridge from soul to ETH and ETH to soul? Like, why are these nfts over there but they're not over here? And like, that, they're different. And I'm like, explaining a bridge and like, those kind of things, people are like, dude, what? So I do, I do have one last question and then we could wrap it up because I know that we're going long here, but what is the catalyst for NFT fi and the NFT fi explosion? Because both of us exist in this ecosystem. Both of us work in that ecosystem.
01:09:34.426 - 01:10:04.750, Speaker B: We have, we are obviously very bullish on NFT five. Yeah. One of the areas that I have kind of always looked to, it's like NFT perps. I'm bullish on, uh, NFT amms and the way that we trade nfts, that's why I'm, like, very interested in flooring protocol, um, caviar, those kind of teams like that. We, I'm working on a research paper right now. The more I dig into ETH, the more bearish. I am not bearish in saying that the value of ETH is going to go down.
01:10:04.750 - 01:10:55.514, Speaker B: I'm not saying that, but I do think the competition is starting to get way more intense. And like, I am in love with, like, using the Solana ecosystem and Solana blockchain and stuff like that. Right. I just think that the infrastructure on ETH, ETH, NFTs is amazing. Like, it is by far the most advanced out of any of the ecosystems at this point. If we're talking ordinals, Solana, whatever equies, but ETH, gas fees, NfT amms, supplying liquidity, all this shit is so expensive that I just think you're kind of like, trying to fight a fight with two hands tied behind your back, right? If you look at NFT, NfT amm volume, I'll share it right here. This is from a platform called tie down here.
01:10:55.514 - 01:11:45.704, Speaker B: You see this? Right out of the last 24 hours, NFT amm volume on Solana NFTs is sitting at about 18%, more or less 18% of NFT volume on a whole chain was NFT amms. Right. If you look at ETH, that doesn't exist. Like, we, we don't have that. Um, so my question to you, what is the catalyst here? Like, how do we start getting more traction? Does NFT fi, NFT amms, that entire ecosystem, just kind of pivot to ethel two s and, like, his blast and everything going on with these bridging assets going that direction. Like, is that bullish for NFT fi?
01:11:46.044 - 01:12:13.862, Speaker A: I mean, I think it is. I think ultimately our entire ecosystem is going to be omnichain. There's going to be more folks, like layer zero, which is like an. I can't say the word, inner interoperable. This is my ESL kicking it. But you know what I'm trying to say, where it's like, through layer zero, you can go anywhere, is kind of like their whole idea. And it's like trying to simplify the idea of bridging.
01:12:13.862 - 01:12:50.074, Speaker A: And I think the other thing too is Ethereum is an EVM blockchain. Quite frankly, I don't know what that means. But what I do know is other l two s, like polygon, optimism, arbitrum, Zksync are also EVM based and compatible. And so for the ETH protocols to be able to deploy on these other chains, I don't think it's actually that hard. From my understanding, it's basically taking the contracts that they have and then redeploying it. It's more of like, is the liquidity. There are the users there.
01:12:50.074 - 01:13:13.682, Speaker A: And so depending on how blast goes, if blast ends up being open source, maybe it's just closed source for right now. But if anyone can build on doesn't exist because it doesn't exist. Yes, this is true, but, um, if eventually the floodgates open for anyone to come and be able to build on blast. I could see, like, very easy deployment for the existing NFT fi infrastructure.
01:13:13.738 - 01:13:14.098, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:13:14.186 - 01:13:30.708, Speaker A: But I think when you're asking, like, what is going to be the catalyst for, like, explosive growth of NFT fi, I don't think it's, you know, the shit that we're doing on our speculative PFP is. I really don't. I really think it's going to come down to real world assets.
01:13:30.836 - 01:13:31.504, Speaker B: Really?
01:13:31.924 - 01:14:10.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Dude, if everything that exists today, like, if you think about your day to day life, like, so much of what's in our day to day life is non fungible in nature. And so all of that shit becomes tokenized. And, like, people are going to start transacting with the blockchain, potentially without even realizing they're transacting with the blockchain. Especially if, like, banks and other institutions start to move towards web3. And I know, like, I have a few friends in finance and they're all like, yeah, the technology is kind of at a point where we can't ignore it. Like, in terms of, like, how it lowers our overhead and, like, how efficient it can be to just operate.
01:14:10.530 - 01:14:59.960, Speaker A: So, like, when we think about, like, that hockey stick adoption cycle, like, we, the existing community here in web3, we make up such a tiny fucking fraction of that. And it's like, how do we onboard the next, you know, not one or 2 billion people, but, like, how do we onboard the next, like, hundred billion people, 200 billion people into Defi. And it's not going to be speculative PFP and having NFT finance tooling on top of that. It's going to be real world assets. It's going to be traditional finance coming into this space. And then it's going to be everyday folks like you and I whom are like, oh, I have a valuable collectible, I need a loan. Or like, once, like, imagine if the entire luxury watch market was tokenized.
01:14:59.960 - 01:15:27.628, Speaker A: So if you were going on to, like, an online retailer and trying to buy a watch, like, you're actually getting an NFT and you have to, like, redeem it. But like, if that was all tokenized, then it's like, then you could short the luxury watch market utilizing NFT fi. You can, like, start to do all of these other things. But I think, like, ultimately, if we're talking about, like, what is actually going to take this to the mainstream and have, like, mainstream adoption, I think it's going to be within real world assets.
01:15:27.796 - 01:15:56.504, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting. When I talk to teams, I always say build for the people that are here. And at some point you have to build for the people that aren't here. Right? Like, and we've talked about this a little bit, just like the NFT lending marketplaces, like the NFT loan wars and shit like that. Like people going like PvP, trying to steal from other people instead of focusing on growing the pie. And that's kind of what they're doing at kettle, right? Like they're, they're looking elsewhere and that's super bullish for the space.
01:15:56.504 - 01:16:23.404, Speaker B: Like, I think as they grow that pie, that is just something that we need to do as a space. And I think that goes back to the open source culture that we have here. Right? Like, people are so much more, like, people can just fork things and they're like, all right, cool. Now we're doing it and I think I could do a better job of marketing or whatever. Yeah. So it is, it is interesting. Like, main takeaway is like, yes, Bill, for the people that are here, but also at some point we have to build for the people that are coming.
01:16:23.404 - 01:16:35.332, Speaker B: So hopefully we, we are here and we're still talking about it as that intersection happens because I think it is going to be quite explosive and we're going to see some pretty badass, like, up only action.
01:16:35.508 - 01:16:45.956, Speaker A: Oh, hell yeah. Like, like, the only, the last thing that I'll say is, like, right now, even with blast and like 5 million plus dollars being in this multi seg.
01:16:45.980 - 01:16:48.172, Speaker B: For this l two, that's 500 million.
01:16:48.228 - 01:16:50.984, Speaker A: Sorry, 500 million. Thank you for the correction.
01:16:51.924 - 01:16:52.500, Speaker B: 5 million.
01:16:52.532 - 01:16:59.914, Speaker A: $5 million is like, how much of that is actually new money entering into our ecosystem?
01:17:00.814 - 01:17:02.790, Speaker B: Did I, did I freeze on your end?
01:17:02.982 - 01:17:05.934, Speaker A: You like, disappeared it, then you came back. That was crazy.
01:17:06.014 - 01:17:06.710, Speaker B: There we go.
01:17:06.822 - 01:17:28.660, Speaker A: But I was just going to say, of that 500 million, how much of that is new money entering into this ecosystem? And I don't think any of its new money. And so it's like, if we want explosive growth, if we want to hit mass adoption. You nailed it on the head. We do have to start building for people who aren't here yet, you know?
01:17:28.812 - 01:17:40.584, Speaker B: No, I agree. Well, hey, thank you for another week. We had some technical problems, but we adapted, we overcame, and here we are at the end of the show.
01:17:41.004 - 01:18:04.630, Speaker A: Yep. And if you guys liked this, since this is actually getting published, make sure to, like, comment, retweet, give us feedback. If there's things that you're interested in us talking about, let us know. You know, we're out here deep in research reports, scouring crypto, Twitter all the time. But it's, I think it's important that, like, we have conversations about things that people are actually interested in learning into at the same time.
01:18:04.742 - 01:18:11.646, Speaker B: 100%. 100%. No, I'm excited. Thank you for doing this. It's been fun chatting with you. So we will be back next week.
01:18:11.790 - 01:18:13.478, Speaker A: Let's go. Thanks, everyone.
01:18:13.606 - 01:18:14.654, Speaker B: See ya. Bye.
