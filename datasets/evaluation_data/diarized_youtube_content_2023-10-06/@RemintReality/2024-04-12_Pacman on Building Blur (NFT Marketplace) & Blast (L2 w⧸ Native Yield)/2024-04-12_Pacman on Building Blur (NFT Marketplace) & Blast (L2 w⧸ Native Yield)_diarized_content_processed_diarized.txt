00:00:00.720 - 00:00:01.806, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm Jen.
00:00:01.910 - 00:00:02.790, Speaker B: And I'm Dalton.
00:00:02.902 - 00:00:11.598, Speaker A: And this is remit reality IRl. We are so excited to be partnering with Schiller to bring you guys this series. I think we have a really exciting one today.
00:00:11.686 - 00:00:12.062, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:12.118 - 00:00:14.102, Speaker B: Today we're actually gonna be interviewing one.
00:00:14.118 - 00:00:19.314, Speaker A: Of the most controversial or influential founders, depending on where you sit in the space.
00:00:29.774 - 00:00:32.776, Speaker B: So, pac man, how you doing? Very nice to meet you.
00:00:32.840 - 00:00:34.848, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having me, guys. Love the space.
00:00:34.976 - 00:00:41.736, Speaker A: Thank you for coming. It is such an honor to be doing this. I think this is your first irl interview like this.
00:00:41.920 - 00:00:43.440, Speaker B: Oh, man, I'm so excited.
00:00:43.512 - 00:00:43.920, Speaker A: I just got.
00:00:43.952 - 00:00:44.964, Speaker B: I am so excited.
00:00:46.144 - 00:01:15.374, Speaker A: So I just want to dig in. You have a particularly interesting background. You dropped out of high school at 16, which I think is insane, incredibly awesome. And then a year later, you found yourself at y combinator, and I believe you built a company there, and then you went to MIT afterwards. Right. Can you take us back to maybe right around the time that you were deciding to go back to MIT? Like, what was going through your mind? What were you working on, and what did you want to work on?
00:01:16.074 - 00:01:47.910, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Let's see. So, basically, as you did your research, which is awesome. So I left high school, went to Silicon Valley. I was originally in Boston, so I was going to school there, moved to Silicon Valley, started working at a company called Teespring. And it was always my dream to basically go to Silicon Valley and go through y combinator. So I was fortunate enough to, after spending a year as a software engineer at Teespring, go and start a company and go through y combinator.
00:01:47.910 - 00:02:07.896, Speaker C: And during that process, something that I also just realized is, I was, like, a 17 year old kid at the time. I was like, I really wanted to go to school and have the. The college experience, basically. So that was really the motivation. I actually really just, like, wanted to, like, get socialized in a way. MIT was kind of, like, a weird.
00:02:07.920 - 00:02:14.352, Speaker B: School to do it. Once he wants college experience, he's like, yeah, I'm gonna go to MIT. That's epic.
00:02:14.488 - 00:02:48.152, Speaker C: Actually, it was kind of an interesting thing because, you know, most schools are. It's kind of difficult to get in as, like, a dropout. MIT is more, like, merit based. So, you know, I was able to, like, do all the tests and everything like that, and I was fortunate that they, like, accepted, like, a high school dropout effectively. But, yeah, I went there, and, you know, it was cool because I got to go at the same time as all my peers, so I would have gone when I was, like, 18 normally. And I was able to go when I was 18 to school. But, yeah, the motivation was really just, I really wanted to have the college experience.
00:02:48.152 - 00:03:13.810, Speaker C: And then the second thing, which is actually, sorry, I haven't really shared as much, but one of the nice things about college is that it's a really dense network of similar people and is a really good place to find co founders. So I explicitly really wanted to find, like, a good co founder. And MIT has an incredibly dense network of engineers. So that is actually how I ended up finding my co founder was, like, through my MIT network, and that was like a secondary goal.
00:03:13.922 - 00:03:21.898, Speaker A: Wow. Did you know going into MIT, what exactly you wanted to build? You're like, I need a technical co founder so I could build x.
00:03:22.066 - 00:03:40.346, Speaker C: No, I just knew that I wanted a technical co founder. Just like, in general, I was like an engineer myself. So it wasn't more, it wasn't necessarily like technical co founder, but I wanted a co founder. And I just had this inclination that there would be a lot of potentials at MIT.
00:03:40.490 - 00:03:41.450, Speaker A: And you were right.
00:03:41.562 - 00:03:42.050, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:42.162 - 00:04:00.662, Speaker B: And so where along that road did crypto come in and what was like kind of early start there? Because obviously everything that you have done to this point, you have iterated very fast. You're like, okay, I get my one year in and then I'm out. I learned what I needed to learn. Now I'm going to the next thing. Was it similar with crypto and, like, where did that start and how did the early journey look?
00:04:00.798 - 00:04:29.508, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say it was. It was not similar with crypto. It's not like I necessarily, like prior to crypto, like, wanted to pivot, like or alter course like that quickly. It was more so just once I felt like there was a different direction that was optimal. It was just like, okay, that's the only thing that makes sense to do for crypto. It was my second year at school. I had really, really wanted to go and start a company again.
00:04:29.508 - 00:05:01.638, Speaker C: I knew my first semester at MIT, I was like, there's no way I'm finishing school because I was very inclined to go and start something again. But I was in my second year and I was starting to explore. And that was also when I met my co founder, Anthony. Basically, the story there is I had a friend, Efe, who was like this really brilliant engineer. He was like an IMO champion from Turkey. And just like a little tidbit at MIT, it's like, if you're an international student, it's like really, really hard to get in. So if you're like an international student at MIT.
00:05:01.638 - 00:05:26.170, Speaker C: It's like you have to basically be like one of the top math people of your country. So he was like this Imo champion from Turkey. And basically as like a side gig in school, he also kind of ran this recruiting agency. So he was basically just connected with all the engineers at school. And we were good friends. So I basically just asked him. I was like, who are the best builders that, you know at school? And then he introduced me to Anthony.
00:05:26.170 - 00:06:17.804, Speaker C: And Anthony is like, hands down, even amongst my MIT curators, he's like the best builder I've ever met. So as soon as we met, we basically kind of like immediately hit it off, started working on various side projects and we eventually started looking into crypto and we discovered this protocol called handshake, which is kind of extremely niche now, kind of like forgotten. But at the time it was this, like, really hot protocol. And for us as engineers, it was very attractive because it was solving like a technical problem using crypto in a very concrete way, basically, which is like decentralizing. The domain name system, which is mostly decentralized, but actually at its core has these centralized elements. So for us as engineers, we're like, wait. This protocol actually could improve the security of the Internet in a way that's very, very concrete.
00:06:17.804 - 00:07:04.600, Speaker C: So we were attracted to it and we're like, okay, what can we build to basically accelerate its adoption? I think that that kind of ended up becoming a theme in terms of what we built is just kind of focusing on market acceleration. But basically we were building on that protocol for around three years and we stuck with it for three years. And eventually we basically realized that it probably is something that the world will adopt, but on an extremely long time horizon and that we weren't necessarily the best positioned to go and steward it. So we ended up selling it to namecheap, which is the business that we built. We sold it to Namecheap, which is the second largest domain registrar in the world. But we stuck with that for three years before we pivoted.
00:07:04.752 - 00:07:09.792, Speaker A: And was it right after you sold that to namecheap that you worked on blur?
00:07:09.928 - 00:07:11.984, Speaker C: Yeah, it was basically immediately afterwards.
00:07:12.104 - 00:07:19.728, Speaker A: So where do we go from web3 domains to Bloomberg trading terminal for nfts?
00:07:19.856 - 00:07:47.338, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's a great question, actually. The funny thing is the experiences at namebase ended up being extremely, extremely influential for blur. So what namebase was, which was the first business was. It was two things. It was a domain registrar for handshake. So it was like similar to GoDaddy or Namecheap, you can buy and sell domain names on it. It was also a crypto exchange for handshake.
00:07:47.338 - 00:08:18.584, Speaker C: Because there was no infrastructure for HNS, which was the protocol. There was no infrastructure for it. We had to build everything from scratch. So we ended up building not only this application layer, domain name marketplace, but we also built the infrastructure layer. We built a fiat on ramp so you can buy and sell it with your actual dollars. We built a BTC Hns token exchange, spot exchange. So it was very similar to Coinbase Pro or binance, that sort of spot exchange.
00:08:18.584 - 00:08:53.760, Speaker C: So we built all this infrastructure and we had to basically learn those skills and learn how to build a real time exchange. And also on the marketplace, or on the domain name side, we also built a marketplace as well. So the transition to blur was actually very, very natural, because when I first got into nfts, the thing that I realized was I was like, oh, this is basically the same thing as a domain name marketplace. It's just for more assets. The domain names are non fungible as well. So I already had a lot of experience with that. It felt very natural to get into it.
00:08:53.760 - 00:08:59.680, Speaker C: And yeah, the story there is also kind of interesting. Happy to get into that. But I know I've been speaking for a lot, so I'll just pause.
00:08:59.712 - 00:09:01.736, Speaker A: I mean, that's what you're here for.
00:09:01.920 - 00:09:50.332, Speaker B: The market acceleration is actually the thing that I'm most interested in because as we have seen, obviously we were chatting a little bit before the show about Twitter and stuff like that and how blur is a very polarizing platform, right? Like, people have said that on one hand they're like, okay, added market efficiency. It's added things to the space that we didn't have before. You obviously had the OSF and Mando trade that was like massive and iconic in and of itself, them dumping on machi and stuff like that. But then that became a whole nother layer to the space where on the other side, we've seen this market acceleration of things going to zero that we never thought would go to zero. Right? Bored apes are now trading at 1011 ETH. And when blur came out, they were trading around 70 ETH, right? So, like, these blue chip holders are now down bad. And on their side they're like, dude, blur ruined ETH nfts.
00:09:50.332 - 00:10:11.384, Speaker B: But then on the other side, people are like, actually it just sped up the process of what was going to inevitably happen, of whales not being able to exit out of positions because this thing was non fungible. Opensea bids at that point were basically non existent. Right. And like, how do you kind of see that process of the early days, like really shaping the ethnft ecosystem that we see today?
00:10:11.724 - 00:10:42.476, Speaker C: Yeah, very, very happy to get into this. You know, first of all, I think it's probably helpful to just like share the origin of like how I got into nfts because it's, it's all related. Actually, you know, what ended up happening was in 2021. I had an acquaintance, I think he goes in 103 by worm emoji, but he, I knew him as I'm not gonna dox. I don't know if he's doxed, but he's pretty doxed. But I knew him personally because he had gone through YC as like a teenager as well. So we knew each other through that.
00:10:42.476 - 00:11:05.312, Speaker C: And we were in a group chat and he pinged in this group chat and he was like, hey, I'm working on this project if you guys want, check it out. And it was a blitmaps. So this was like March 2021 at the time. And I basically checked it out and I was like, you know what, I'll throw a few hundred bucks at it and mint the blip map. It's like $300. And then I basically held it up until its 8th and I sold it around like 25 ETH. 25, 30 ETH.
00:11:05.312 - 00:11:08.400, Speaker C: And after that I was just like totally hooked and I was like, what.
00:11:08.432 - 00:11:10.344, Speaker A: Is, how do I do this?
00:11:10.424 - 00:11:12.360, Speaker B: I hit an ADX and now I'm good to go.
00:11:12.432 - 00:11:23.158, Speaker C: Yeah, so it was, it was crazy to me. And then I was like started digging into it and then I was like, oh wow, these are basically like, you know, domain names, but other assets.
00:11:23.206 - 00:11:30.190, Speaker A: I love that. That's how your brain processed it. Instead of being like, oh, these are nfts. You're all like, oh, this is just like domain names. I've been doing this shit for like three years.
00:11:30.222 - 00:11:57.386, Speaker C: Yeah, it's crazy. It was very, very familiar, actually, a lot of like domainers. It's like a weird industry, but a lot of domainers are also into nfts. It's overlap is, it makes sense. But basically I started digging into it and I really fell in love with the trading side of it. I started flipping nfts back in the day. Reveals used to take a really long time, so I did some scripting stuff to kind of scrape the reveals and kind of programmatically figure out which were the best ones.
00:11:57.450 - 00:11:58.434, Speaker B: The good old days, bro.
00:11:58.474 - 00:12:25.358, Speaker C: Yeah, it was really, really crazy times. And as I was doing all this, I couldn't help but but noticed that all the infrastructure was extremely bad. It was just slow, it was clunky, and it was just wasting time. And basically, at the time, you would basically be using ten different tools. Opensea was really slow. It took 30 clicks to do something. It was very, very painful.
00:12:25.358 - 00:13:04.100, Speaker C: And I knew that for myself as a user, I wanted something better. I also just knew that in terms of the market development, typically any sort of like, financialized market, it professionalizes over time. Like every single financialized market, whether it's eBay sellers, kind of first started off as this online flea market. Now, the top eBay sellers are like professional businesses. Same thing with Etsy, right? The initial sellers, they were moms that were selling something on the side. Now they're real legit businesses that are selling things on etsy. And that's just for a non financialized market in crypto, which is way more kind of like hyper financialized.
00:13:04.100 - 00:13:38.894, Speaker C: It's even more so if you think about the progression of exchanges. The first exchanges were kind of these normie friendly retail exchanges like Coinbase. That's where everything was initially. And then over time, what we've seen is there's a progression towards more professionalization and financialization. So it's like then you had finance, OKX, Bitmax, perks were invented. All of this additional advancement on top, this trajectory is basically how any sort of financialized market develops. So I knew that, again, both as a user, I wanted something better.
00:13:38.894 - 00:13:44.734, Speaker C: And then just from a market level perspective, it was always going to professionalize.
00:13:44.774 - 00:14:30.792, Speaker A: More from there, from your builder's perspective. Got it. I think one of the things that also kind of came out of blur is obviously incentives. And it's my understanding that from the moment you guys kind of started to conceive blur, you knew incentives were going to be a massive part of the platform and your user acquisition strategy. And I think the word you, or the phrase you tend to use is user alignment. I want to double tap on Dalton's question of on one half of the spectrum of web, three people, you have people saying blur killed ETH nfts, which I don't agree with personally. But on the other hand, there are actual tangible impacts that we're seeing on a lot of these collections.
00:14:30.792 - 00:14:45.888, Speaker A: Like, how are you, like, what are the discussions internally when you see a blue chip, like bored ape have multiple lending death spirals, a massive floor fall, and, like, talking about how that works with user alignment, does that question make sense?
00:14:45.936 - 00:15:36.734, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So I think for this question, there's the general commentary on incentives as a general construct. And then there's also, we can double click on blur incentives specifically and their impact. And happy to talk about both. I think maybe I'll talk about the general stuff first and then the blur. So, yeah, the reason why we thought about it this way from the beginning, for context, actually pretty much every exchange, I'm not talking about NFT marketplaces specifically, but a token exchange, because if you look at the shape of these protocols or businesses, they're all quite similar. They all bring on market makers of some form.
00:15:36.734 - 00:16:33.784, Speaker C: Usually the traditional way was you go to a market maker and you basically sign some sort of agreement with them and you're usually either paying them a fee or you're doing fee plus profit share. This is something that is very, very common. Many of the exchanges also had their own internal market making operations, which is somewhat controversial. But that was basically the practice. And the way we thought about it was more so along the lines of we believed that we could create more efficient market structure in terms of just like a better marketplace. And in order to get there, we needed the users in the community to basically rally behind it and contribute to it. And if the community were to basically just switch over 100% over to blur immediately, it would create a lot of value.
00:16:34.544 - 00:16:36.664, Speaker A: And so value in terms of like.
00:16:36.704 - 00:17:55.038, Speaker C: Liquidity, value in terms of liquidity. But there's also like inherent value, like at the, you know, at the time when, you know, blur launch, like Opensea was valued at like 10 billion, right? So you can basically think of it like that market structure in terms of like a NFT marketplace, whichever NFT marketplace it is, that's like leading is basically, you know, worth like 10 billion, right? And it happens to be worth 10 billion in a structure that is rewarding the equity holders of Opensea. But if it was actually inhabited, if that market structure was inhabited by a decentralized protocol, that 10 billion could actually be realized by the contributors to that protocol, by the holders of that protocol, by the users of it. And so the goal was basically, can we make blur that market structure? And in order to do that, we wanted the community to basically contribute to it. And so the whole idea behind the point system was, can we basically define a system that allows users to contribute to that outcome? It's not like the value is coming out of nowhere. We know there's value in this market structure if it's achievable. That's why we had confidence in being able to deploy this point system and having there be something to back it at the end of the day.
00:17:55.086 - 00:17:58.030, Speaker A: It's kind of like your users are your market makers.
00:17:58.142 - 00:18:33.574, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. It's like the users, every user is inherently kind of like a market maker. Like, whether you are kind of doing it professionally or not. Exactly. It's like if you list or you bid, you're doing the job of the market maker. So from that perspective, it was like, okay, if you're a user and you're contributing that way, can we actually calculate your, your contribution and basically come up with a formula for it and actually show you, hey, here's how much value your contribution is producing. And then in that way, we can actually kind of distribute the value of that market structure to the users in a fair way, effectively.
00:18:33.574 - 00:18:36.194, Speaker C: So that was a lot of the thinking behind it.
00:18:36.354 - 00:18:54.172, Speaker B: It's so interesting to hear this from your perspective because there's also blur. Prior to blur, we had opensea, then looksra tried to come in, and that was unsuccessful. And then you had x two, y two come in, also unsuccessful. And that was in that Christmas time where it was just like, you had the so's airdrop.
00:18:54.228 - 00:18:54.676, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:18:54.700 - 00:19:03.636, Speaker B: And everybody was like, super, like, yeah, like, nfts are going. And then, like, nfts went, and then, like, everything died. But, like, we're not gonna talk about that. But it was very like, og, I'm.
00:19:03.660 - 00:19:05.424, Speaker C: Impressed that you remember all that history.
00:19:05.804 - 00:19:06.852, Speaker B: That was good times.
00:19:06.908 - 00:19:07.332, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:07.428 - 00:19:30.110, Speaker B: But what I think happened there was, this is pre nft finance, right? Like, when blur came in, there was like, NFT perks were starting, and, like, NFT perp was gaining a lot of traction. I think their biggest volume day was like 12 million. Right? And like, all of this was still kind of hinged on, like, oracles that were feeding off of looksrare, x two, y two, blur and opensea.
00:19:30.142 - 00:19:30.310, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:30.342 - 00:20:07.350, Speaker B: And now if you're paying attention to nft finance, you still see the same oracles. But, like, looks where floor is like 22 ETH. Like, we were talking about bendao death spirals and stuff like that, right? Like UC looks were at 22 ETH and Bendao is still taking the feed, that floor. And I'm like, this is not the floor. Right. How do you kind of see the incentivization of these market makers impacting NFT finance tools? And, like, how? Because obviously blur and the blur API is pretty, like closed source. There's not a lot of sharing going on here.
00:20:07.350 - 00:20:40.824, Speaker B: But blur is such a big part of the ecosystem. How do you see this kind of playing out? Especially you have blast, you have blend and blur. It's like a huge ecosystem that you have, but it's also incentivized. And there are bad people that are taking, they're not bad people, but they have ill intent behind this because they're just farming. So do you see this incentivize liquidity as people actually wanting things? We see farmers all the time. They get dumped on and then they dump on the next farmer and then they manipulate the floors. So yes, they're market making, but it's with ill intent.
00:20:40.824 - 00:20:46.800, Speaker B: So like, how do you kind of see blur, blast blend all kind of flowing into the NFT finance ecosystem?
00:20:46.912 - 00:21:33.230, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's a great question. There's like a number of topics that you touched on there. One is just in terms of the API, actually one of the emergent just like properties is that we noticed a lot of third party APIs actually just like popping up that were very good. Actually, I forget the names of specific ones, but basically we noticed that those APIs were just popping up and were really good. So when it comes to individual implementations, like Bendao for example, not indexing the floor for whatever reason, I think that's more idiosyncratic. It's not like a systemic outcome, it's more so implementation specifically. Right.
00:21:33.230 - 00:22:00.882, Speaker C: Like it is like very, very possible for bend out or like a player like bend out to actually like accurately track the floor. It's like, it's actually like pretty trivial. So I think that it's hard, and there's, the thing about like NFT finance is that there's so few players, it's really hard to, you know, derive whether an outcome is like systemic versus just like idiosyncratic. Right.
00:22:01.038 - 00:22:37.174, Speaker A: Well, can we double click on that real quick? Because it's like, let's look at blend, for example. You have a peer to peer perpetual lending model with basically 30 hours recallable loans. I think so many of the lending death spirals that we've seen more or less in the last year have kind of come from this like incentivized lending that we see on blend. In addition to the fact that these loans can be recalled like that, versus fixed term or other peer to peer places where maybe the loan term is a little bit longer. Is that, to you, systemic or idiosyncratic?
00:22:37.254 - 00:23:30.370, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's a great question. So now, now it's like clicking into specific incentivization programs. So happy to comment on both, like the general blur incentivization program and then, you know, blend as well. We were originally talking about the blur one, but let me do the blend one first, since that's like the most recent. So basically at a high level, the way to think about blend is actually, let me just provide some general context first, in terms of getting the ability to borrow against your assets. That's something that already exists prolifically on centralized exchanges. Whether you're on binance or OKX or any of these other exchanges, if you hold ETH, you can borrow a stablecoin against your ethnic, and you have a flexible amount that you can borrow, and it's not like it has a fixed duration.
00:23:30.370 - 00:24:16.766, Speaker C: I can borrow against my ETH and keep that position open basically indefinitely. And it basically just gets automatically closed if the collateral value versus how much I borrowed ends up getting too close. That's how it works on exchanges. And when you borrow against is, I say, if I have ethnic and I borrow like $1,000 against my ETH, when I'm borrowing on an exchange, what ends up happening is I'm actually paying interest on that borrow position, and that interest is actually dynamic. It's going to be dynamic based on the market conditions. So as the liquidity dries up, my interest rate is going to shoot up, and as there's ample liquidity, my interest rate will go down. And then if the price of ETH crashes, then I'm basically going to get auto liquidated.
00:24:16.766 - 00:25:12.760, Speaker C: And so this is like the system that powers all these exchanges, and you can talk about the merits of it, but basically that system works extremely well. It does lead to situations like even on centralized exchanges where we're all familiar with liquidation spirals, that's just an inherent aspect of the system. But basically that general system, while that is liquidation spiral, is a negative property of the system. The positive property is that in the general course of things, it actually allows for liquidity to be freed up, because instead of just being stuck in my one ETH, I can actually borrow against it and do other stuff with that 1000 USDT that just borrowed against. That's the system. And the design of blend is basically to go and replicate that system as much as possible for nfts. And it's actually quite, quite similar.
00:25:12.760 - 00:25:53.196, Speaker C: So when you borrow on on blend, you have a loan that you're paying interest on, and basically that loan is by default. Like let's say I have a bored ape and I borrow, just to keep it simple, I borrow one ETH, so it's worth eleven ETH and I borrow one ETH on it. The lender can call that loan and it triggers a 30 hours auction. And because the market is mostly efficient. It is almost like definite that that loan is going to get refinanced by another lender, right. So it's like, it'll be like a very low interest loan. It'll trigger into an auction and then some other lender will step in and take it over.
00:25:53.196 - 00:26:21.392, Speaker C: And so I can basically keep that loan open indefinitely. Then the question is like oh, when does it get like liquidated? Right. When does the lender trigger an auction and then it doesn't get refinanced. Well it doesn't get refinanced when like the credit conditions of the market change. So like let's say bored apex went from eleven ETH to like two ETH. Right? Now this like 10% LtV loan is now actually a 50% LTV loan. At that point there might actually be less lenders willing to loan against this, right.
00:26:21.392 - 00:27:04.678, Speaker C: Or the lender might be willing to loan but they're going to require a higher interest rate. And so this mechanism basically mirrors the sex, the centralized exchange in a way in which the loan is indefinite. It'll uh, it'll have a flexible interest rate based on like the credit conditions of the market. And then if the um, the market, you know, turns to south then you're going to get like liquidated effectively. Uh, just like it would happen on, on a centralized exchange. So that's like the system design of lend. It basically kind of like mirrors that experience on, on a sex just with like a decentralized lending protocol which uh, like lend to me is actually like one of the coolest things that the contributors have like ever created I think is like really, really neat.
00:27:04.678 - 00:27:52.702, Speaker C: Now the incentivized lending portion of that, basically the entire purpose of the entire premise of blend is that as long as the market is like relatively efficient then it's going to basically mirror that sex like experience and things will be processed like properly. Where it falls is like let's say I'm a lender on a board ape and you're borrowing like one ETH against your board ape and it's like at eleven ETH and I call that loan. And let's say I'm like the only lender that exists in the market. So even though anyone else could step in and they should step in because like when that, yeah, it's a great deal. I'm going to get like ten ETH on that. So I'm going to. Was that like 1100% return? Like that's incredible.
00:27:52.702 - 00:28:21.234, Speaker C: I should not be able to get that. But like let's say I'm the only lender in the market that is looking at this, in that case. Now, this system is not working as intended because the market's just like inefficient. And it's not, it's not working because the system like, doesn't, doesn't work where it's broken. It's just working because there's not enough attention on that market specifically. And so these like, inefficiencies, you know, like if you put dollar 100 on the ground, for the most part, it's going to get picked up in New York City. If you put dollar 100 on the ground in like a forest, maybe it's never going to get picked up.
00:28:21.234 - 00:29:12.168, Speaker C: The whole purpose of the blend incentive is to basically provide a reason for lenders to basically be observing these markets. And so giving them an incentive to participate in the market means that when there's a $100 bill on the ground, someone's going to pick it up eventually. So all of that basically goes to say that I think that the incentives generally work as intended because there's enough eyes watching these on chain auctions that if there were a large arbitrage that was possible, someone would come in and pick it up. If someone's not coming in and picking up, it's probably because the credit conditions did worsen to such an extent that it's perceived as too risky to go and pick it up and then it's going to get liquidated, which is what should happen in that market condition.
00:29:12.296 - 00:29:46.034, Speaker B: Right. Well, and that's something that if paying attention to the space, obviously, both of us are researchers and we spend all our time, especially nowadays, this is like 15 hours, don't leave your computer season. But you see certain marketplaces and lending platforms and things like that that do have incentives that aren't catching bids on certain things. And it's actually really impressive. I think what you've done is you've really captured the attention via incentives or whatever you like. I've always liked using blur as a, as a marketplace and things like that, and I prefer that to other marketplaces. Right.
00:29:46.034 - 00:29:52.630, Speaker B: But it's pretty cool to see these incentives actually working, whereas other platforms are kind of failing with this.
00:29:52.702 - 00:30:38.716, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the reasons why the incentives get like a bad rep is just because it's quite challenging to implement correctly. It's very, very technical, so it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with incentives. And we also see not just poorly implemented incentives now that it's more popular to do these point programs, um, but not just like poorly implemented incentives, but also just, uh, almost like adversarial incentives, where it's like the. The team is kind of like farming the farmers in a way. So there's like all these, um, ways in which the incentives get implemented in, like, a sub optimal way. And I think that that kind of, uh, it just skews the perspective on it when it's, like, not the. The tool.
00:30:38.716 - 00:30:45.580, Speaker C: That's the issue. It's like, not like fire. That's the issue. It's like whether you're using the fire to build, like, a combustion engine or to, like, burn stuff down. Right.
00:30:45.612 - 00:30:53.876, Speaker A: So that makes sense. I mean, high level, what do good incentives look like to you versus bad incentives?
00:30:54.020 - 00:31:40.620, Speaker C: Yeah, there is a number of things. I guess one of the easiest things to control from a builder perspective is just whether it's adversarial or not. Something that I see a lot now is you have some teams that are, like I mentioned, just farming the farmers. And what that looks like is maybe it's like an exchange that's incentivizing volume, and the exchange is also taking a fee at the same time. So basically, it's just like a value transfer from the farmers to the exchange, the team. And it's like a very especially malicious thing, because sometimes they'll also not specify how long the trademark, the period is. So it's this indefinite thing, and you're just giving them your fees, and they're collecting fees at the same time.
00:31:40.620 - 00:32:35.650, Speaker C: And it's actually like super misaligned incentives because the users are basically transferring value, like losing money in the short term and giving that money to the team. The team is actually making money in a short time horizon, and the users are maybe going to make that money back in a long time horizon, but it doesn't really matter to the team at that point because they already collected all the fees. So that's a very adversarial situation because the team is earning on a much shorter time horizon than the users, and they're also directly earning from the users with those different time horizons. So that is adversarial. And you kind of see various instances of this across the board on every chain. It's just always going to be co opted by these. I don't know if they're necessarily bad actors, necessarily malicious, but it kind of has this malicious outcome.
00:32:35.650 - 00:32:38.098, Speaker C: That's one of the most common issues that I see.
00:32:38.266 - 00:32:40.894, Speaker B: Do you see this on blast?
00:32:41.714 - 00:33:13.120, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that I haven't seen as much of it on blast, but what I have seen is incentives. Now this is the second issue which is incentives that I think are implemented suboptimally. The thing that we always recommend to teams building a blast is like incentivize liquidity. Don't incentivize volume. It is like the number one most common thing for people to think to do is to incentivize volume. It's been tried so many times before in the NFT world. Like Luxray tried it.
00:33:13.120 - 00:33:47.796, Speaker C: X two, y two tried it. In the token world, fcoin tried it. It was like an exchange back in the day. There are so many protocols that I see just incentivizing volume and it's just like. I guess it's just one of those things that people are just going to keep on doing for whatever reason. I think it should because it sounds like it's the right thing to incentivize, but it's not. The reason why it's not is because basically all that does is it incentivizes MEV people to basically come in and arbitrage the incentive program in a very non constructive way.
00:33:47.796 - 00:34:18.504, Speaker C: So sometimes we see teams gearing towards that and then we try to basically step in and say, hey, this is kind of like a suboptimal incentive scheme and you should probably tweak it. And sometimes we'll recommend ways to tweak it. It's up to the team whether they want to listen to that or not. But I would say it's probably happening on Blasto and exam. But I don't think it's happening in a malicious way. But it's definitely way, way, way less than where I see on other ecosystems.
00:34:18.804 - 00:34:57.608, Speaker B: I think double clicking on that right there because this is something that we're obviously seeing quite a bit right now is like people are farming blasts, right? Like it's just part of the game. Especially right now. Ethn FT is trending down. Like people are trying to find the next place to park money. And people like congrats on how much tvl you guys locked up at such a rapid rate. Like you guys have have really pushed that front. Right? But one question I do want to ask is how do you view incentivizing whales versus retail? And like, I think historically speaking, you guys have done an amazing job of democratizing that and saying, okay, if you're doing the right things and you're playing the game, we're going to reward you.
00:34:57.696 - 00:34:58.328, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:58.496 - 00:35:12.364, Speaker B: That being said, I also want to ask about Sybil attacking and wallet spreading. And how do you view that? We've seen other projects that have done rewarding that kind of behavior for vanity metrics and stuff like that. How do you view that?
00:35:15.724 - 00:36:02.856, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's, you know, if a project's incentivizing, like, sibling for, like, vanity metrics, there's kind of nothing you can do about it. Like, they're just like, there's just like, an improperly implemented system, but it's like a very easy to think that that's, like, helpful. It's helpful maybe short term, but, like, long term, it's not helpful. When it comes to, like, whales versus retail, I think in an optimal world, there is always some sort of, you know, boost that you can provide to retail to, like, the smaller players. Like that. That is kind of like a desirable outcome, right? Like, even if you provide, like, a minor boost, it's like. It is kind of, like, desirable.
00:36:02.856 - 00:37:03.754, Speaker C: The issue is that there isn't really a way to do that on chain because it's not like, you know, if an address belongs to retail or if it's just like a citibl account from a whale. Like, there's no information that you have on that. And because you don't have that information, you can't actually design a system to reward those retail, basically. So when I've, you know, whenever I've been able to contribute to any sort of incentive design, I typically try to not think about well, versus retail and more so just thinking about how can you. Perfectly, to the extent that you can capture in a numerical way, the contribution that someone provides in the case of blast, as an example, is you get points every block for your balance. If you deposit one ETH and you hold that for a bit, you're earning a certain amount of points. If you deposit 1000 ETH, you're also getting points, and it's like, perfectly proportional.
00:37:03.754 - 00:37:31.268, Speaker C: So that is actually kind of like a, like, that sort of system is kind of just like, perfectly fair in a way. It does mean, like, the whales are going to get more, but, like, they're also putting in a thousand x more, right. So it's like, it's. It's perfectly proportional. Something that I see a lot of is people try to, like, curve down the rewards. So they're like, oh, if you deposit like, 1000 ETH, you're not. And you got like, 1000 x the points, we're actually going to curve that at the very end.
00:37:31.268 - 00:37:48.532, Speaker C: And that's pretty suboptimal because basically all that does, it just means the whales are actually just going to split their deposits across a lot of different accounts. And then the only thing you think you're interacting with 100,000 users, but you're actually only interacting with 1000 users.
00:37:48.668 - 00:37:49.372, Speaker A: Maybe even less.
00:37:49.428 - 00:38:05.904, Speaker C: Yeah, probably even less. Some of these ecosystems is almost definitely less. Oh, yeah. But then they have, like, the craziest metrics. Right. And those metrics, maybe for some of the projects, like, maybe it is like a beneficial thing, like short term, it gives them the attention. So it's like, it is kind of a trade off.
00:38:05.904 - 00:38:37.406, Speaker C: Whenever I've thought about it, though, I've. I guess maybe it's just more like a personal inclination thing. It just seems like a waste and almost like a grift to kind of, like, chase those, like, vanity metrics. Those vanity metrics, if they're real, are great. If you're actually getting 100,000 users and they're all doing this and generating real activity, that's awesome. But if it's just inorganic and faked, I think it just doesn't feel good to have that sort of system. And it's also just, again, long term, not beneficial.
00:38:37.406 - 00:38:41.022, Speaker C: So hopefully that kind of gives you a sense of how I think about it.
00:38:41.118 - 00:39:27.200, Speaker A: It's so interesting actually hearing you say this, because I think within the NFT lending space, I remember when blend came out and all of the builders were talking about it, it was very much like, it's really hard for us to count what's real volume versus incentivized volume. And you hear that a lot. And, like, even looking at blast and how you're distributing blast gold to these apps, I kind of feel like vanity metrics is a dirty word now. But when we were talking about it and breaking it down, it was kind of like, okay, gold is being distributed to Dapps based off of the KPI's. That would be the most important to them. And we immediately were like, okay, it's the vanity metrics. It's like, number of transactions, it's your user retention, your user count, your volume.
00:39:27.200 - 00:39:39.584, Speaker A: And so I think in my head, I'm having a little bit of, like, a hard time. Like, I hear what you're saying, and I totally agree, but I'm having, like, a little bit of a hard time reconciling that because I think I do see hints of it.
00:39:39.664 - 00:40:04.900, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's a great question. One is these incentive systems are very, very hard to design. So sometimes there are emergent outcomes where it's like, oh, there might be some inflation going on of some sort. And it's never a spectrum. It's never 100% vanity or 100% real. It's somewhere in the middle.
00:40:04.900 - 00:40:41.224, Speaker C: And the question is, can you get it more to the real side of the spectrum than the not real? So it's always more of an ideal. Um, we've a lot, we've talked a lot about like the blur incentives specifically, which I, uh, which are like a very specific instance for blast. That one is, um, it's, it's a more complex, uh, problem because on the, uh, on the point side, which is for, uh, TVL, that's like 100% not vanity, because it's just based on, it's literally just like based on the TVL. So it's just like, you can't fake the TVL, like, you can't fake liquidity. It's not like I can copy paste my ETH.
00:40:41.804 - 00:40:43.144, Speaker B: That would be a big problem.
00:40:44.124 - 00:41:44.946, Speaker C: Liquidity is one of those things that's very, very hard to fake. Volume is one of those things that is very easy to fake in many regards. It's really just a matter of then for the gold, it's really just a matter of looking at each specific DAP and trying to think through what are the KPI's that can be authentic and what are the KPI's that can be easily faked? But maybe you can get some other signals to try to get a sense of authenticity. So when it comes to a Dex, for example, yeah, maybe they can fake their volume, maybe they can fake the number of users, but they can't fake liquidity. That's just, and they can't fake the tightness of the liquidity. So if you have a DeX and you have a lot of liquidity for ETH, USD, like around the mark price, right? So if like, if USDB is like 3500 and there's like a million dollars of liquidity within like the plus, you know, plus or -2% range, like, you can't fake that. So those things are like 100%, like not vanity metrics.
00:41:44.970 - 00:41:49.282, Speaker A: Like, those are more of your like concrete signals of like, there is clearly on chain traction here, right?
00:41:49.338 - 00:42:19.992, Speaker C: Those are very concrete signals. The other things like the, you know, volume or the users, those are like very easy to fake basically. So those you probably, you can still like, look at, but you kind of have to. And this is why, like, in all of the official communication, it's always been specified. It's a combination for the goal. Specifically, it's combination of, you know, objective and subjective metrics. Because like some of the stuff, like TVL, very reasonable to be like objective about, but some of the other stuff, it's like hard.
00:42:19.992 - 00:43:10.582, Speaker C: So it's like, you know, when it comes to looking at those metrics, then we start to look at, like, oh, like, are we seeing usage from, like, on crypto Twitter? Right. Like, when we're in discords, do we see people talking about it and using it? When we just, like, talk to some users ourselves and they say, hey, these are, like, the dexs that we're using, or these are the protocols that we're using. Are they mentioning, you know, that protocol? And if there's, like, a protocol that's just, like, not mentioned at all and has these, like, crazy metrics. Yeah, it's like, okay, that clearly that's like, yeah, we just, like, don't look at that. Um, and then the other thing you'll notice is that for the gold distribution, this system, uh, might change, but I think the general, like, process is probably gonna stay pretty similar. But basically, you know, for each dap, we give it, like, a score. And it's not, like, a precise score, right? It's like one, three or six, I think, was for this first distribution, or maybe like one, three, five.
00:43:10.582 - 00:43:40.074, Speaker C: But basically, like, these are, like, really, like, rough buckets. And the reason why they're, like, rough buckets versus being, like, exactly precise is because it's very hard to have, like, a precise measure of these things. But we felt pretty comfortable. We felt that we could be fairly accurate if we had these, like, rough buckets. Right. So if we were precise, we'd probably be inaccurate. But by being kind of more, like, rough about it in terms of, like, high level scores, we felt like we could have, like, a higher degree of confidence that the score was accurate.
00:43:40.154 - 00:43:42.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Cause it's a range. It's not so black and white.
00:43:42.922 - 00:43:43.578, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:43:43.666 - 00:43:47.948, Speaker B: I have so many questions about that, but I feel like you want to touch on USDB.
00:43:48.116 - 00:43:52.532, Speaker A: Yeah, I will. I want to take a quick break from points. I'm sure we're going to come back.
00:43:52.588 - 00:43:55.264, Speaker B: I was going to say, we definitely are, because I have questions.
00:43:55.644 - 00:44:36.726, Speaker A: When you first announced blast, I think there were a few things that caught my eye. Number one was, I remember you making some sort of statement that was along the lines of, like, I want to create institution level perps. And in order to create that environment, we need something like blast. And now we all of a sudden have, like, this insane native yield l two, which. It's kind of funny, because when you zoom out anyways, you're kind of like, why wasn't this just, like, baked in? Like, I think the mid curve take is like, oh, well, you can go to Lido and deposit. And I'm just like, why would I do that when I can just have it already doing that for me, which I love. But a lot of what you talk about is like, I want to create the highest yield environment possible.
00:44:36.726 - 00:44:41.584, Speaker A: Like, what does that look like to you? Like, tangibly beyond what we're currently seeing on blast?
00:44:41.744 - 00:45:26.180, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a number of things. There's a few aspects that are direct, obvious things. And then I think there's more long term developments. In terms of the short term developments, one is just the baseline interest rate on blast is just higher than any other l. Two, it's like you're saying if you keep your ethical or USCB on blast, you're automatically earning 3% to 4% on your ETH and ten to 15% on your USB. And you don't have to think about it, you're just getting that. And those users, maybe in a world, maybe without blast, maybe they would be putting it into Lido and Makerdao, but odds are they probably wouldn't be.
00:45:26.180 - 00:46:01.758, Speaker C: And so now those users just are by default earning around like 100 to 150 million in yield that annually that they weren't earning before. Like that's like a lot of money, just like, just like baseline. But then the second thing is now the users also don't need to make a choice between earning that yield and using the Dapps. Because, you know, normally it's like, oh, if I am holding this ETH, I'm not earning the yield. If I put it into like lido, maybe I'm earning the yield. But then if I want to start using it in a dap, I now need to like convert it. And so it's like odds are you're probably going to keep some like pool of ETH just like in your hot wallet, like all the time.
00:46:01.758 - 00:46:47.266, Speaker C: That's like not earning yield just to go between the Dapps. So now you're just like, your baseline is like you're not going to be earning that yield versus on blast again, it's just like it's the default for everyone. Like you can't avoid it and so you're just like automatically just like earning more than anywhere else. But then when it comes to the Dapps themselves, it is also, now because of this native yield, it is also, and the funny thing is also like the term native yield has been like co opted by other protocols, but they're like, it's not actually native yield, which is a funny separate thing to talk about. But basically now that these apps have this native yield, they can actually build new types of applications that take advantage of it that weren't possible before. Now that's just a higher yield environment because you have these apps utilizing the yield that didn't exist before. I can give examples of that.
00:46:47.266 - 00:47:51.260, Speaker C: The third aspect is I think that there's likely emergent outcomes here where because once the entire, once yield is just pervasive throughout the entire system, you probably just have new opportunities and metas that develop that are extremely rewarding for both the users and the developers. That just weren't possible at all before. I think a good intuition for this is when you think about one example, something that's possible on blast is it basically enables new business models. If you're a perp Dex and you have 100 million TVL, normally the way you monetize that is you charge trading fees to your users. That's a tried and true business model. But the other way you can do that on blast is you can actually just monetize the yield at that 100 million TVL. If it's USD, if it's a stablecoin, which is probably the default for perfectex, you're going to be earning around ten to 15 million in yield annually.
00:47:51.260 - 00:48:12.852, Speaker C: And that's basically totally invisible to the users. And so now you're earning all this revenue, and your users, you can actually charge your users zero trading fees. So it's like a zero trading fee. Like Perp Dex, where have we seen zero trading fee trading apps before? Robinhood. Robinhood, they came out and they launched the first zero trading fee app for stocks. And that had profound impacts on the market. Right.
00:48:12.988 - 00:48:13.876, Speaker A: Especially retail?
00:48:13.980 - 00:48:48.270, Speaker C: Especially retail. It enabled the entire, like, Wall street bets meta. And just like retail participation just completely changed and it basically just forever altered the stock market landscape. Similarly, I think for blast, it's like the direct effect is, oh yeah, maybe you have some dapps that the users earn the yield and the dapps maybe incorporate the yield, but I think the secondary emerging effects are actually, it could have as significant of an impact on the broader market as Robin Hood did on the stock market.
00:48:48.422 - 00:49:38.640, Speaker A: I love that. Like long term vision, there is one thing I want to go back and tap on, which is where the native yield comes from. Obviously, native yield on blast doesn't come from nowhere. We know for ETH it comes from Lido, and for USDB, right now it's coming from Makerdao. Recently, Makerdao had to change its DSR to 15%, which is why we are now earning 15% on USD beyond blast. But I feel like in the last few days, we've kind of seen, I think, I don't know if I want to call it irresponsible behavior, but we've seen some, like, odd stuff that hasn't really been characteristic of, like, how conservative maker Dow is usually with, like, the decisions that they make and the proposals that they do. But, like, I'm seeing conversations on, you know, from Aave leadership about, like, do we need to lower this LTV? Like, what they're doing is really reckless.
00:49:38.640 - 00:49:56.314, Speaker A: Like, how are you thinking about that from the perspective of blast? Because, like, God forbid, die goes into death spiral. Like, that would heavily affect the entire blast ecosystem. Is this something that you would actually look to build out yourself so you're not having to rely on third parties?
00:49:56.394 - 00:50:58.608, Speaker C: Like, yeah, it's a great, great question. Let me start off by talking about the system design for this, and then I will talk about makerdao specifically, which is the current implementation of the system. The high level system design is that the blast bridge is able to implement different strategies for earning yield. To start with, it's Lido and microdao. But in the future, once, uh, you know, like, further community governance is enabled, the, uh, community will basically be able to diversify, uh, away from those strategies. And it could either, um, you know, have multiple strategies or it could just, like, fully replace the strategies. And basically what this system design allows for is that, you know, if maker was determined to be, like, a sub optimal strategy or even just like, for, like, general diversification, it's healthy to have, you know, multiple different providers of yield.
00:50:58.608 - 00:52:09.670, Speaker C: And each individual provider, you want to make sure that they are earning the yield in a relatively safe manner. So on chain t bill protocols are good candidates, and then, of course, just other LST protocols are good candidates. And of course, the community, it's important for the community and for us as we try to support and steward the community, to basically assess the risk and the stability of each individual strategy. But in the limit, what is possible is you effectively have yield coming from multiple, diversified strategies that are independently fairly low risk, and then collectively are very low risk because you have these multiple strategies and it's diversified. So that's the high level system design, which is sound, then it's basically as good as you're going to get it. The system also has basically this insurance pool that builds up over time as well. So then it allows for, if there were ever some sort of catastrophic systemic event across, like, all of those strategies at once, for whatever reason, I don't know, maybe ethereum just goes down something like crazy, like some crazy black swan events.
00:52:09.742 - 00:52:10.622, Speaker A: I've seen it before.
00:52:10.758 - 00:52:58.996, Speaker C: It can happen in a technical sense or theoretical sense, but basically in that world, then it's like you still provide multiple buffers. The current world that we live in is that the primary strategies are lido and makerdao. And on the maker Dao side, they've been around for a very, very long time. And it's been a protocol that when we first chose the initial strategies, we set the initial parameters, and then the community is able to set it from there. But we set the initial parameters on the lido side, we felt that Lido was the safest because it's got over $20 billion locked up in it. It's been around for a while. So that's basically like a $20 billion bug bounty that's been live for, like, years at this point.
00:52:58.996 - 00:53:53.744, Speaker C: So that's like a fairly good strategy to bet on. And then similarly, Makerdao, they have billions in TVL, it's been around for multiple years as well. And that community has effectively stewarded Makerdao through crazy market conditions, like, way crazier than we see now, and they've come out on the other side of it. So Makerdao also seemed like a pretty reasonable strategy when it comes to the recent controversy, which is like them and Athena. I think it is a bit of a mixed bag, I would say. The bright side, regardless, is that it's not that they're using Athena for, like, 100% of the yield. I think it's like 20% of the, like, makerdao collateral is like, in Athena or something like that.
00:53:53.744 - 00:55:04.242, Speaker C: Those numbers are like, just, like vaguely remembering. It would have to dig into specifics to find the exact ones, but basically, it's a smaller portion of the total portfolio. So makerdao kind of like, similar to the bridge system design that I share. They have multiple different strategies and they have multiple different sources of yield. So Makerdao's entire system design is also basically to, you know, diversify its sources of yield, and that's what enables it to basically survive these, like, you know, adverse events. So I feel pretty confident in Makerdao overall just because they have such a history of navigating it also, you know, but, you know, it's not just a matter of, you know, trusting their judgment and just, like, completely excluding our own for this recent specific instance. You know, we also dug into ourselves and we also talked to a number of very, very deep technical on chain, just like MeV players that are what I've, in my experience, basically the best adversarial thinkers in the space, I have not found a better adversarial thinker than some of the people that we've been able to work with.
00:55:04.242 - 00:55:53.516, Speaker C: And these people, they basically made all their wealth by breaking protocols. So they're very, very good at it, and they just have, like, a mind for it. They are very, very deep into that ecosystem. And when we asked them for their additional perspective, they felt at the current levels that they felt it was fine, basically. So there's a number of signals here, but across both the general trust and Makerdao, both the third party perspectives, from experts that we trust, and then also from our own evaluation, we still feel comfortable utilizing microdao as a strategy. With that said, though, in the future, in the near future, if the community were ever to feel that a more diversified strategy would make sense, or even to replace Makerdao entirely, that is something that the community will be able to do, and that's going to be a program that we put into place.
00:55:53.620 - 00:55:59.972, Speaker A: Got it. I know we're running a little short, so what do you want to dig into?
00:56:00.068 - 00:56:14.350, Speaker B: Cool. Yes, let's go. We could do these kind of more rapid fire, if that's cool by you. One of the things that you were touching on. Oh, God, I have so many questions. One of the things I really wanted to ask you about is loyalty. So this is something.
00:56:14.350 - 00:56:41.972, Speaker B: So points program we've talked about quite a bit, right? Loyalty is something that you brought into the space, and you're like, look, you use opensea. Sorry, bro. That's just how it works. When you guys announced blast, one of my first thoughts was like, fuck, what's going to happen to people that are using other l two s? Right? Like, are you going to take a similar approach to saying, like, all right, it's not opensea anymore. We've, like, gone up to the big leagues. Like, if you're using arbitrum, like, hate to break it to you. Sorry.
00:56:41.972 - 00:56:50.860, Speaker B: And we've seen this now with Dapps, right? Like, you. You put them into the one, three and six bucket. You're like, if you have a platform or you're serving on another blockchain, like.
00:56:51.012 - 00:56:51.696, Speaker A: One and a half.
00:56:51.750 - 00:56:52.300, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:52.452 - 00:57:08.664, Speaker B: You're not going to get the same kickbacks. Is that something that you guys have thought about? Like, how are you thinking about, like, are you looking for people to be more blast native? And we're already seeing a flourishing ecosystem that has happened in what, a month? Like, it's insane. So it's working.
00:57:09.084 - 00:57:53.730, Speaker C: Yeah. I would say the, the core driver for any, like, decision we make is not, it's not like, oh, like winning market share or having loyalty. Those are not the outputs that we care about. It's more so about how can we define contributions to the ecosystem? And if loyalty is something that contributes significantly to the ecosystem, then we want to define that. And if it's not, then we're not going to define it. And it's more so about how do we fairly evaluate the contributions to the ecosystem. So that's like the core driver.
00:57:53.730 - 00:58:15.786, Speaker C: Loyalty is one of those factors. But when it comes to loyalty for users in general, I'm not a fan of retroactive surprises. I think that's a bit of a rug. If at the end we were just like, oh, by the way, all of these users who use these other l two s are, we're wrecking you. That's just unfair.
00:58:15.850 - 00:58:17.454, Speaker A: It would be war on the timeline.
00:58:17.994 - 00:58:19.586, Speaker B: It would be insane.
00:58:19.770 - 00:58:49.496, Speaker C: It would be, it'd be a very eventful day. But I think that that would just be a betrayal of trust. So I really don't like that. Which is also why it's like with any sort of incentive system, we try to be very explicit about how it works, what's allowed, what's not allowed. It's sometimes very, very hard. But in general, that's our ideal because we want to make it very clear to the user, hey, this is what's being rewarded. And if we need to make changes, we try to make it like in a fair way.
00:58:49.496 - 00:59:27.048, Speaker C: Right. So we basically, we kind of have like a commitment to the community to stay along, like certain guidelines of behavior. We don't have, we don't, we don't have like infinite flexibility. And then with, within those guidelines, then we kind of have our design space. So when it comes to like loyalty, to the extent that it is like beneficial to the community, you know, it's like basically we're always going to be thinking about how do we better define contributions to the ecosystem. But regardless of what we do, we would always try to do it in a fair way. That's not necessarily like retroactively punishing surprise.
00:59:27.096 - 00:59:27.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:27.352 - 00:59:55.670, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. Another just like rapid fire question. Like, we have not seen a robust NFT ecosystem on any l two. I know this is something you mentioned in the developer AMA. I would love if you could just paint to the vision of like what a robust NFT ecosystem looks like to you specifically on blast. And like, if there's anything you're seeing from NFT projects or that you want to see NFT projects, explore more?
00:59:55.822 - 01:00:35.664, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that in general, these ecosystems develop. If you think about like every market cycle, it's not like randomness, like people talk about like market cycles, but the reason why they operate in cycles is not necessarily like the rule of law of the market. It's actually more so due to the underlying market developments and improvements that enable these boom cycles. So for example, in 2013, it was like Coinbase, enabling retail to buy bitcoin. That's a huge catalyst, and then that enables that movement. 2017, it was Ethereum launching and enabling smart contracts and icos, which is new capital formation. And that enabled another huge wave.
01:00:35.664 - 01:01:08.624, Speaker C: 2020, it was like DeFi, again, another. Now you can actually trade on chain and do other stuff. That's another huge wave. So pretty much every single cycle is driven by fundamental developments and improvements in the infrastructure. When it comes to l two s, what I've noticed is that we haven't had that sort of cycle. And I think it's due to the underlying developments and the market infrastructure just not being there. One aspect of it is having very fleshed out, like NFT marketplaces, right? You just need NFT marketplaces for these things to just like function.
01:01:08.624 - 01:01:57.704, Speaker C: That's an example of one, it's a great one, but basically you need that. But then also, when it comes to l two s, I think it's really only interesting if you can do new things on the l two s. So it's like, what are new things that you can do? Well, one aspect of l two s is like, sure, as a baseline, they're all faster, cheaper, so you can probably do larger collections or do more novel things there. But then another aspect is what I noticed as a builder from the builder perspective, one of the largest impetuses for blast was when I was contributing to blur. In the process of contributing to blur, we looked at a bunch of different l two s and we dug into them technically. We also talked with their teams or CEO's, and what we found was none of them were providing anything that particularly resonated with us as builders. And the reason why is because they didn't really enable anything new.
01:01:57.704 - 01:02:41.186, Speaker C: The reason why we felt blast was meaning my co founder and I, they're different orgs contributing to the different projects, but my co founder and I, the reason why we felt it was necessary to create blast was because we realized that it was possible to build an l two that actually enabled new types of applications. And that's not just for the Dapps, but even just for the assets. And a great example is actually, and it's very regrettable because the hack. But Munchables was actually a very interesting new implementation for NFTs. The way it worked was that you could basically lock your funds for a 30 day period and then you get to mint the NFT in return for free. Yeah, for free. And this was like, it was a very popular mechanism.
01:02:41.186 - 01:03:09.970, Speaker C: It went from zero to 100 million tvl instantly. Instantly, I want to say, within two days. It was so, so fast. It was shockingly fast. I think one of the reasons why it happens so fast was like, one, of course, there's just a lot of monetary velocity on blasts in general. But then the second thing is it is this novel mechanism that is a new way of minting nfTs, and it's not without precedent. So actually, a random fun fact is, in South Korea, you don't rent houses by paying a monthly rent.
01:03:09.970 - 01:03:20.444, Speaker C: You actually rent houses by depositing a large amount of money with the owner. And then they actually just earn the yield on those deposits. And then when you leave, you get to get your money back.
01:03:20.524 - 01:03:21.164, Speaker A: That's cool.
01:03:21.244 - 01:03:22.052, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like a really weird, it's.
01:03:22.068 - 01:03:23.412, Speaker A: Like really cool, right.
01:03:23.508 - 01:04:04.780, Speaker C: But that's basically like what munchables was, but like, for nfts. And it works really well in South Korea. So, like, this is like a new type of model that just like, doesn't exist anywhere else. And so these types of things are what enable new metas to develop because it's like they're, they're the underlying market developments that basically enable, like, you know, new creativity, new types of applications, new value for users that was previously basically locked away. So that is what I mean when I talk about an l two NFT ecosystem is like, there has to be not just the underlying activity, which is the output, but also the input is that there's basically new types of experiences, products that you can create that aren't possible. On ethel one today, were you at.
01:04:04.812 - 01:04:22.360, Speaker B: Any point in the Munchables hack? There was a lot of chat on the chain about you guys running back the chain and things like that, and the centralization versus decentralization conversation. What was going through your mind during that time? And, like, was that a realistic possibility? And what would be the ramifications in your mind?
01:04:22.432 - 01:05:14.422, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. We were very fortunate in that it never got to that point where we even were deep into that discussion because all of our focus was on how can we support the Munchables team to basically try to navigate the situation as effectively as possible to maximize the likelihood of recovering the funds when it comes to. And so, like, I wouldn't be able to give a specific answer because like, we never even got to the point of like, really, really debating it. But I think the, you know, something that I noticed on like crypto Twitter, and this is like a level of nuance that I think was missed, is that it's not just like a binary thing, it's, it's actually a question of time as well. You really need to look at that, right? So like today, ethereum, like hard forking, because like adapt, gets hacked. You know, Dapps get hacked all the time on Ethereum. You know, Ethereum doesn't hard fork and it's a decentralized and robust ecosystem such that like, you know, it can withstand those hacks.
01:05:14.422 - 01:05:51.022, Speaker C: But that's, that's today, you know, if you revert back time back to like 2016, when Ethereum was in its infancy, they actually went through a very similar situation, actually like similar amounts of capital as well. And, um, what Ethereum did in that situation when the DAO got hacked was they, they hard forked and it was so controversial, it created, etc. Etc. So super, super controversial. But that move, we'll never know what would have happened if they didn't do this. But I think it's fair to say that that move is what saved Ethereum. It allowed the community to recover its funds to continue building out the ecosystem and now create this robust, super decentralized ecosystem.
01:05:51.022 - 01:06:15.404, Speaker C: So I think when evaluating that decision, you really need to think about the time component and like, at what stage is this chain in its development cycle? So I think for blast, that's something that we definitely would have looked at very heavily. But in terms of what the answer would have been, I can't say just because we haven't done enough, we never got to that point.
01:06:15.524 - 01:06:59.492, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I have one more question. I don't know you very well, Pac man. Like, obviously been covering your work, farming on blasts. We have dmed a little bit here and there, but I think, you know, and you tell me if I'm wrong, but when I look at you, I see someone who is very young, very driven, has clearly, you know, you push yourself. And I feel like in order to do that, because not everyone can do it, you're probably highly critical and very reflective of the things that you do. I would love to know, like looking back at the past few projects and specifically blast, like, where do you feel like the areas of improvement are. And then like, what's your north Star that you're building towards?
01:06:59.668 - 01:07:34.466, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's a great question. I really like that question because I feel like you're a very highly critical person. Like, that was so apparent, like, as soon as I walked in and you're adjusting the camera, so that was like, awesome. Actually, what I've noticed is, like, typically people that execute you at a high level are typically very, very critical. So I like that question. When it comes to blasts and execution, I think there's some general things that were kind of unavoidable. One of the things about blast that's very interesting is just building out an ecosystem and supporting the teams.
01:07:34.466 - 01:08:03.854, Speaker C: Building on the ecosystem. I would like to spend all of my time just with the teams building. You just need manpower for that. You need hands on deck. And so just scaling up that operation to support the teams, that's just something that we're running into and we're going to need to do, and that's going to be a learning experience. There's that as one aspect of it. But I think something that's a little bit less controllable because it's just inevitable to a certain extent.
01:08:03.854 - 01:09:14.801, Speaker C: Something that was a little bit more controllable that I think that we're now rectifying is if you look at blast today, there's actually a headwind that's holding back the ecosystem artificially. And the headwind is you earn points for holding your ETH and your USDB. You can earn gold by using Dapps, but you don't earn anything for holding tokens or native assets on blast. So it's like as soon as you move out of your ETH, you're basically incentivized to sell as quickly as you can or unless you really, really believing in it, because there's a large incentive to hold those other assets or to deploy into Dapps. And basically that is this artificial headwind that is holding back people from deploying into different things in the ecosystem that we've actually heard from users. Hey, we really want to buy these assets, whatever they be, whether they're nfts or tokens, but we're just, as soon as we do it, we're no longer earning the points or gold. And that's a huge disincentive, um, that is an emergent outcome from like the current, like, system design, which is like, you know, it's, it's a very incentivizing, uh, creating an incentive system for like a layer.
01:09:14.801 - 01:10:02.032, Speaker C: It's just like much more complicated and complex than for like an individual application. So, you know, I'm not necessarily like beating ourselves too much on that, but I think that like, that is like a very solvable problem. So some, one of the things that I'm like, most excited about is actually solving that incentive issue. We have a number of designs that we think will do it effectively and I'm really excited for that because right now you just kind of have, it's like you have this ecosystem where there's two and a half billion dollars on it and you have a user base that's basically the most active base of on chain users in the entire space. But they're basically just artificially restricted and shackled due to this current system design. I think just with a few tweaks it can actually unlock, basically just free them to do what they would normally want to do. That's something that I'm really excited about and I think we can improve that.
01:10:02.032 - 01:10:02.704, Speaker C: I love that.
01:10:02.784 - 01:10:04.752, Speaker A: I think that's like a great note to end on.
01:10:04.808 - 01:10:09.192, Speaker B: I was like, dude, this is because I'm one of those people. I'm just like, fuck, I know.
01:10:09.208 - 01:10:11.080, Speaker A: I'm like, buy this, buy this.
01:10:11.192 - 01:10:23.604, Speaker B: I can't. As we wrap up last minute, alpha, anything that you want to share, floor is yours. Anything that you feel like is important to share. This is your time.
01:10:25.724 - 01:11:41.748, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that this is like touching on to my previous point, but something that I really want to see less of the most is when you see daps. And this is across the, I'm not talking about blast specifically, but I mostly noticed on other chains. But when you see basically like, like Dapps farming the users, that's a really, really negative outcome because the users are the lifeblood of the ecosystem and it's just this adversary environment. I think that for users, it's very hard to put the onus on them, to basically study these things in depth. And then also for a lot of these DApps is if they have opaque systems and they can change them and rug at will. So it's very, very hard to put that onto the users. But I think something that I would stress the most is that if the user can kind of try to think about for each DAP, if they have an incentive system or if they have any sort of incentive system or no incentive system, if you just look at the DAP and you can try to just evaluate are they aligned with the user on the same time horizon? So is the DAP only getting rewarded when the user gets rewarded, is the DAP only succeeding over a long time horizon, because that's how the user is going to get rewarded as well.
01:11:41.748 - 01:12:12.534, Speaker C: Is the DAPP transparent in their communications? I think if the users paid attention to those signals more and kind of diverted attention away from the teams that are not really playing fair, I think that ends up creating a better systemic outcome, because now the Dapps that should get the attention get the attention, and the dapps that shouldn't get the attention don't get the attention. So if there's one thing, I think it's just for the users, basically just really, really try to pay attention to that and try to lean into the Dapps that are, uh, you know, being fair and transparent.
01:12:12.954 - 01:12:14.374, Speaker A: Sounds like another video.
01:12:14.794 - 01:12:17.654, Speaker C: I was gonna say more video content coming.
01:12:19.274 - 01:12:21.334, Speaker A: Um. Thank you so much.
01:12:21.714 - 01:12:23.066, Speaker B: This was awesome.
01:12:23.130 - 01:12:26.002, Speaker A: Like, we'll have to do, like, a part two sometime.
01:12:26.138 - 01:12:27.274, Speaker C: Yeah, we'd love to ask you now.
01:12:27.354 - 01:12:41.494, Speaker A: Yeah. But, guys, we hope you enjoyed that. Uh, this is. I I don't have words. I don't have words, but I think that's it. Wrapping up bearish or bullish until the next one. Thanks for tuning in.
