00:00:02.200 - 00:00:44.124, Speaker A: All right, the tweets out. Let's see. There it is. What up, everyone? Okay. You look so serious.
00:00:46.104 - 00:00:51.604, Speaker B: Oh, bro. People have said they're like, bro, you got rusty bitch face. I'm like, I don't got rusty bitch face, bro.
00:00:52.914 - 00:01:06.690, Speaker A: Just, like, a tiny bit. All right. I went ahead and just threw up a retweet. My Internet's, like, acting a little sus. I'm not trying to stay on that page for too long.
00:01:06.842 - 00:01:07.898, Speaker B: Oh, God.
00:01:08.066 - 00:01:11.786, Speaker A: Oh, God. I know. You might be all alone again. You might have to.
00:01:11.930 - 00:01:13.034, Speaker B: Don't do that to me.
00:01:13.114 - 00:01:24.638, Speaker A: Rip it alone. I did reset, like, right before. Ooh, war daddy looking like a snack. Yeah. Dalton even hitting the gym. Look at that.
00:01:24.686 - 00:01:33.834, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually one of my best buddies. We played soccer together a long time, so.
00:01:34.454 - 00:01:39.542, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Amazing. All right, you ready to dig into it?
00:01:39.678 - 00:01:41.914, Speaker B: I can't believe you said I had resting bitch face.
00:01:42.294 - 00:01:46.154, Speaker A: I just said, you're so serious. You don't put words in my mouth.
00:01:47.254 - 00:01:48.946, Speaker B: All right, let's get into it.
00:01:49.070 - 00:02:05.930, Speaker A: Let's do it. Oh, man. Um. Dude, what a. What a week. Like, I'm feeling exhausted. So I was out in Joshua Tree, like, Friday through Monday, like, midday, and I.
00:02:05.930 - 00:02:37.714, Speaker A: During the weekend, like, I straight up lost a week. Like, Monday. I had, like, tweeted, like, blast points multipliers, right? Goes live today, and everyone was like, um, jen, are you, like, living in the future? Was this, like, a failed, scheduled tweet? And I didn't see it until I got home, so I didn't see it until, like, 4 hours later, and I was like, it's April 1. Like, wow, I can't believe it's April. Completely forgetting that. That would be absolutely awful, considering we are going to New York, and I would have not been ready for the New York trip at all.
00:02:38.614 - 00:02:57.806, Speaker B: Well, yeah, no, I feel like this week has just been. Well, the past few weeks in general have been pretty. Just a lot. Like, there's so many moving parts between blast, farming, base, meme coins. A lot of meme coins. I feel like we have just been going nonstop. I actually fly out tomorrow.
00:02:57.806 - 00:03:05.142, Speaker B: Um, so I'm taking Friday and Monday off, which is feeling very nice. Do you know?
00:03:05.158 - 00:03:06.654, Speaker A: Well, it's Easter, I guess.
00:03:06.694 - 00:03:08.262, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't. I didn't even realize.
00:03:08.358 - 00:03:09.510, Speaker A: Yeah, me neither.
00:03:09.702 - 00:03:23.570, Speaker B: I was just, like, I knew we were going to NYC, so that was just like, going back to. I lived in New York for seven years, so, like, that's, like, a homecoming in and of itself, but I'm going to go home see the family in Los Angeles before I head out, so that'll be good.
00:03:23.602 - 00:03:51.214, Speaker A: Yeah. If you guys are in New York, let us know. Maybe we'll see you at some events. But I'm not sure if you saw. We're actually going to be doing, you know, the first round of IRL, like, video podcast in New York, which I am just like, so stoked by. We're partnering with Schiller for that. So shout out to fungi and team for, like, seeing the vision that Dalton and I had for this and just like, coming together and helping us make it happen.
00:03:51.294 - 00:03:56.834, Speaker B: So. No, I feel like, dude, it's. Have you been to nft NYC before?
00:03:57.254 - 00:03:58.514, Speaker A: Just last year.
00:03:58.934 - 00:04:00.806, Speaker B: And how did you like it?
00:04:00.990 - 00:04:15.674, Speaker A: I mean, it was cool. I think it was just. It was fine, you know, like, I don't think there was anything that, like, totally stood out to me. But I also brought my partner, Hannah, so I. We had fun either way, you know.
00:04:17.134 - 00:04:38.930, Speaker B: I feel like last year it was cool getting to meet people. We're obviously like, peak bear market. Like, people were down in and out. They're just like, dude, I don't think this is ever coming back. And the relationships that I got to make at NFT NYC were actually really cool. And I think that that kind of shaped the past year. So, that being said, I'm pretty excited to get back there and kind of, kind of see what's going on, so.
00:04:39.002 - 00:04:44.930, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and also, I think this will be the longest sprint of time you and I get to spend together.
00:04:45.082 - 00:04:50.754, Speaker B: I know. We've seen each other. We got dinner one time. Is that it?
00:04:50.794 - 00:04:51.530, Speaker A: One time?
00:04:51.682 - 00:04:52.794, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:04:52.914 - 00:04:53.774, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:04:54.074 - 00:04:55.034, Speaker B: All the time.
00:04:55.194 - 00:05:15.616, Speaker A: Yeah. So Dalton and I like video call pretty much. I don't know, every other day, I would say. And I'm so used to seeing Dalton from like, here up. And we got dinner and he. I get there before him and my partner's there and he's bringing, you know, his partner. And I'm like waiting, looking around and I'm like, I know what he looks like.
00:05:15.616 - 00:05:33.904, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden I just see like, this towering seven foot man, like, walking down the. Okay, basically 7ft. Actually, I'm sorry, a ten foot giant, like, walk over. And I had a moment of like, just absolute shell shock because I'm like, this is just. It was weird.
00:05:33.984 - 00:05:50.080, Speaker B: But you know who also is pretty tall is Ben Roy. And the first time I saw him, I was like, also Greg from collab currency. Speaking of cloud currency. Um, yeah, that I was shook. It was like all three of us were, like, over six three. I was like, and same thing. I'm, like, used to seeing everybody from here up.
00:05:50.080 - 00:06:11.608, Speaker B: I was like, all right. That being said, actually, I don't like it. It makes me feel very inferior, besides the point. So, um, for those that are going to nft NYC, are there any go to events, must go events that you're going to be paying attention to, dropping in on? Anything like that?
00:06:11.776 - 00:06:30.996, Speaker A: Mm hmm. So magic Eden has a pretty big presence this year. I think they're, like, headline sponsoring, like, seven different events. So I know there's, like, the magic Eden yacht party. They're also doing the after hours party, and they're co hosting the pudgy Penguin party Friday night. So I got. I got you some tickets.
00:06:31.100 - 00:06:31.796, Speaker B: Oh, you did?
00:06:31.900 - 00:06:46.464, Speaker A: I did, I did. I've been working on it. But then I think, you know, you were talking about cloud currency earlier. They have, like, a little cocktail mixer. Wasabi has a cocktail hour. Meta street has a cocktail hour. So those are kind of, like, the main events that I'm looking at.
00:06:46.464 - 00:06:50.538, Speaker A: What about you? Is there anything on your radar that you're excited about?
00:06:50.676 - 00:07:21.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say collab currency last year, that was a really fun one. Just getting to hang out with a bunch of founders and people that we get to chat with day in, day out that, like, you see posting on Twitter and stuff like that. So that was a really fun one for me last year also BRV. And BRV is border adventures. They're like, one of the advisor groups in the Twitter space and the crypto space. I met them actually at proof, and they were always one of my favorite teams. So they have an event, and then also I'm gonna be making an appearance at the proof event.
00:07:21.094 - 00:07:44.124, Speaker B: I feel very excited about it, actually. I feel like the one thing that proof did a really good job of was events, and that was just always a consistent. And Maggie is like, the events woman over there, and she absolutely fucking crushes it. So there's gonna be a moonbirds event and a proof event. So I'm probably gonna drop both of those.
00:07:44.154 - 00:07:46.000, Speaker A: Those both, bro.
00:07:46.032 - 00:07:57.512, Speaker B: I just get to go see the homies. And I'm like. I kind of feel like I'm. It's like I just get to, like. I don't know. I feel like I've blown up a little bit since I left, so hell yeah, dude. Go say hi to the home and.
00:07:57.528 - 00:08:00.004, Speaker A: Fucking crushing it, so that'll be fun.
00:08:00.504 - 00:08:01.248, Speaker B: So that's it.
00:08:01.296 - 00:08:03.720, Speaker A: Um, can you get me some tickets?
00:08:03.912 - 00:08:07.648, Speaker B: Of course. I'm gonna have vip tickets, bruh. We'll be good.
00:08:07.776 - 00:08:11.216, Speaker A: Yeah. Then I for sure want some tickets. Get me there.
00:08:11.320 - 00:08:12.248, Speaker B: We'll do it.
00:08:12.416 - 00:08:13.364, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:08:13.864 - 00:08:16.704, Speaker B: Well, let's hop into market stuff.
00:08:16.744 - 00:08:18.952, Speaker A: The market. Let's do it.
00:08:19.048 - 00:08:20.364, Speaker B: Go ahead. Kick it off.
00:08:21.184 - 00:08:30.728, Speaker A: Well, you know, I'm a garden member. I don't know if you see. Oh, God. This. Do you see it? Hold on. I just have to show this. Yeah.
00:08:30.728 - 00:09:13.930, Speaker A: So some pretty exciting news dropped from Azuki and arbitrum. Yes. I have 13 brain cells, guys. So I might have some misinformation here, but basically they're launching an l three called anime chain, and Izuki is, like, the first official collaborator. And I think this is also the token drop that everyone's been speculating about. The rollout was sick. In all honesty, I don't know too much about l three s from a non technical perspective in terms of why have a super app chain? But I'm starting to see more of that narrative pop up on the timeline, so I'm gonna try to do some deep research into that.
00:09:13.930 - 00:09:20.338, Speaker A: But yo, Suzuki's coming back. It feels good to be in the garden. Like, I'm stoked.
00:09:20.506 - 00:09:28.374, Speaker B: I don't know how back. Oops, wrong one. I don't know how back I would say they are.
00:09:28.994 - 00:09:31.202, Speaker A: Okay, well, maybe sentiment is coming back.
00:09:31.258 - 00:09:49.084, Speaker B: All I'm going to say is. So just to give people some background here. Yesterday, at, like, 07:00 a.m. Pacific time, they announced that anime coin is coming out, or anime chain. And this is, like, the long awaited airdrop. This is something that, like, this is what bolstered, like, the pudgy penguins as well. It's like Token Airdrop.
00:09:49.084 - 00:10:16.174, Speaker B: Token airdrop. Token Airdrop. And then they announce it, and Azuki was sitting at about five ETH. And they also had a run up from about four ETH or sub four ETH in the past week. And they get up to five ETH. The announcement comes out, they run instantly up to six ETH, and now they're back under sub four five. So I'm actually kind of interested to hear your opinion on what this means for Azuki.
00:10:16.174 - 00:10:32.844, Speaker B: Is this a good buy right here? Like, I kind of feel like it must be, but, like, do you know much about the tokenomics? Do you know much about the airdrop? Obviously, Azuki has. Azuki's a ten K collection. And then they also have elementals, which is a 20K collection. It's similar to bored apes and mutants, right? Yeah.
00:10:33.344 - 00:10:43.728, Speaker A: Of the elementals, I believe only 15,000 have been revealed, and the other 15,000 are still elemental beings. I'll show you.
00:10:43.776 - 00:10:44.144, Speaker B: Let me.
00:10:44.184 - 00:10:46.764, Speaker A: Let me show something real quick. I'm going to throw.
00:10:48.104 - 00:10:56.504, Speaker B: Because you have elementals, then you also have beans. So, like, bro, like, I can't imagine this being like a massive, massive airdrop.
00:10:57.364 - 00:11:29.454, Speaker A: So basically, um, our understanding, like, we don't really know much about tokenomics. And this is also a speculating on a point system, but there is, like, a point system based off of what tokens you hold. And I think, like, one of the things that has always set Azuki aside is their collector profile. Like, they've kind of gamified collecting. And you actually really feel that within the collection. So there are different badges that have different points that you can earn across all three collections. And so I think I'm.
00:11:29.454 - 00:12:11.378, Speaker A: I would be shocked if I was wrong on this, but I think your collector profile will probably play a role in your allocation for the anime token. So most people that are in the garden that are already trying to get more exposure, the way that they're going about whether it's purchasing an azuki, an elemental, or beans is just like, straight up looking at how many points they get per asset. And there's, like, some standard pricing, uh, for that. Like, I have an azuki that is, like, an Azuki that I've personally been wanting. I know who holds it. I've been watching it. Uh, and about seven months ago, it was sold for nine ETH.
00:12:11.378 - 00:12:19.484, Speaker A: But now with this new point system, like, it would be valued maybe around ten to twelve based off of how many points that it gets. So, like, you can.
00:12:19.524 - 00:12:30.732, Speaker B: So can. Yeah. Can you kind of break this down here? So you have esteemed grand legend in the order. And, like, what. What all does this mean? And, like, how is that? So you're saying that basically the order is like the highest tier, right?
00:12:30.788 - 00:12:31.236, Speaker A: Yes.
00:12:31.340 - 00:12:33.964, Speaker B: So would that be like, spirit azukis and shit like that?
00:12:34.084 - 00:13:01.320, Speaker A: That would be people who have, like, I don't. I forget the exact point breakdowns, but, like, typically they hold spirits or they hold incredibly rare azukis. Like, let me see if I can find it. Like, you can go, like, right here. If you own one Azuki that has one gold trait, that's 1000 points, there are some azuki's that have two gold traits. So that's 4000 points. So, like, the way this is built is really.
00:13:01.320 - 00:13:15.744, Speaker A: Instead of just like, I'm going to buy, buy, buy and hoard, it's really designed to actually have rare traits mean something, right? And I. I love this model. I think it's really nice. Where's the.
00:13:16.284 - 00:13:40.710, Speaker B: When? I think that it also offers something to, like, mid rares and stuff like that. Like, it actually does kind of contribute to people collecting things. My only question here is, like, I'm like, a total flipper, right? I'm like, so if I were to sell my zuki and then buy another one that had different traits, does that mean that I would get both of, like, if I were to, like, literally just flip and flip and flip and flip and flip? Nope, nope.
00:13:40.782 - 00:13:42.954, Speaker A: You got based off of your holdings? Yeah.
00:13:43.614 - 00:13:44.394, Speaker B: Wow.
00:13:44.934 - 00:14:05.914, Speaker A: So check this out. So these. These are emblems based off of, like, one individual NFT, right. But then they have, like, multi token emblems. So there's one called. Is this the family? Let's see. Like, if you have twelve beans, you get a hoarder emblem.
00:14:05.914 - 00:14:21.570, Speaker A: There's one. Okay. So it's, like, own one Izuki of each animal trait. So if you hit all three traits, you get 500 for each set. And then you also get this emblem. So I think more collector mentality than flipper mentality with this.
00:14:21.602 - 00:14:45.324, Speaker B: Right, right. So now. So now with that being said, if somebody was to go in with, say, like, 2025 ETH and sweep Suzuki here, if they did it the right way, like, they could jump higher up on the leaderboard just by their collecting. Totally profile and, like, really think it out and be like, okay, I could get 4000 points from doing these four Azuki's or whatever.
00:14:45.484 - 00:14:52.652, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, let me. I'm trying to remember if this is.
00:14:52.668 - 00:15:03.944, Speaker B: The first time I've ever wanted to talk about Azuki. But I think. I think I was just like, yeah, kind of pissed about missing them. I missed the boat completely. So where.
00:15:04.104 - 00:15:21.824, Speaker A: Hold on. Where the fuck. Oh, here's the gallery. So what you could do, if you are interested in getting an Azuki, is come to the gallery. You'll see all the different collections right there. And then you could obviously filter. But clicking on each one of these right here.
00:15:21.824 - 00:15:40.604, Speaker A: There it is. You can see how many points that NFT would yield you. So it's like, if you're actually trying to collect and get decent exposure, like you. This is probably your source of truth that you want to look at before you just, like, you know, buy something that's on the floor.
00:15:41.304 - 00:15:42.216, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:15:42.360 - 00:15:43.136, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:43.320 - 00:15:48.244, Speaker B: All right. Well, there you go. That was the Azuki portion of our show. Thank you.
00:15:48.944 - 00:16:06.312, Speaker A: Oh, I got more. Okay. I mean, listen, I saw you put in this show notes. If I think this is a good buy here and, like, being having an unbiased take. Like, the thing is, and I always say this, I am not a trader. I tend to buy nfts that I.
00:16:06.328 - 00:16:10.364, Speaker B: Just, I am not a trader from the person that trades more than anybody else I know.
00:16:11.064 - 00:16:17.840, Speaker A: Okay. Because I'm not good at it. So I feel like until, like, my p and l is like seven figures. Like, you can't really say I'm a trader.
00:16:17.912 - 00:16:18.256, Speaker B: Got it.
00:16:18.280 - 00:16:57.054, Speaker A: Got it. But, like, the way I look at it is, I think of all of the teams, I feel like Azuki has moved slower in terms of, like, delivery and execution. But with that, every single time that they have dropped something, it's been pretty fucking cool. And so I think if you're looking for, like, a quick exit within the year, Zuki is probably not for you. But if you actually have an interest in anime and you, like, want to see this IP be built out, it's just, I think it's going to take a lot longer for people to realize massive profits on Azuki's. And that's just me.
00:16:57.214 - 00:16:57.630, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:57.702 - 00:17:00.526, Speaker A: But, um, yeah, no, so when garden.
00:17:00.630 - 00:17:16.661, Speaker B: I definitely think that they're probably goodbye them and doodles are probably the two teams that were blue chip that I think still can reclaim that. Obviously, pudgy penguins are over ten e. So, like, they, in my opinion at this point, are blue chip. Like, we, we all.
00:17:16.717 - 00:17:22.861, Speaker A: Is that the threshold for you, like, collections need to kind of maintain ten ETH and above to be blue chip right now?
00:17:22.957 - 00:17:45.134, Speaker B: Like, I think that we all have kind of the feeling or the sentiment that I would say pudgy penguins, Azuki, bored apes, barely. And, well, and like, that's just historically speaking, then you have punks. Right? And then who else would you throw into that? Like, d gods had it. They lost it.
00:17:47.674 - 00:17:51.890, Speaker A: Only for meme land captains and potatoes.
00:17:51.922 - 00:17:53.562, Speaker B: Captains. Yeah, captains, potatoes.
00:17:53.618 - 00:17:54.186, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:54.330 - 00:18:23.822, Speaker B: But like, that, they're not really, like, I don't see them as a PFP project that's fair. So I don't know. So, like, that's. And this is where I think that we're kind of getting into this. We've chatted on this before where we have, like, ETH l one ETH mainnet gas fees going through the roof. What's going to happen when incentivization comes to kind of pivot or bridge NFT collections over to blast right to. And I've chatted on this quite a bit with, like, the incentivization of, like, farming blast right? Like, I think we're going to see Blur 2.0
00:18:23.822 - 00:18:44.058, Speaker B: on blast and then it's just going to be a whole nother thing. But I don't think that all collections are going to go from ETH mainnet to blast, rightfully so. Right? Like, I think that there's people that have, like, too. They could lose too much. Right? Like, I think pudgy penguins will stay on ethnic. I think bored apes will stay on ETH. Like, I think those kind of collections will stay over there.
00:18:44.058 - 00:18:47.530, Speaker B: But then some. Some of these young cats are going to come over. I don't know.
00:18:47.682 - 00:19:17.454, Speaker A: I so little pudgies is already a multi. It's technically like a multi chain. So I can see, like, Azuki to me. If they're gonna go anywhere, I have a feeling they're going to arbitrage anime chain. Like, they're going to go to their own chain. But I could see maybe for, like, secondary collections, um, across the board, it becoming a new norm for those to be following. Like, the little pudgy model where you can bridge from chain to chain.
00:19:17.454 - 00:19:23.230, Speaker A: I just think, like, you're going to fragment your holders, you're going to fragment your liquidity, like, 100%, right?
00:19:23.262 - 00:19:54.432, Speaker B: And I don't understand why people would do that. And I think, like, going multi chain is a conversation that I don't. I don't understand it. Right? Like, just like you said, fragmenting liquidity, that is not a pro for anybody, right? And like this, you mentioned, uh, Uzuki going to anime chain. If people want to buy an Azuki, Azuki have already established themselves as, like, a top tier collection. If they move to arbitrum and people wanted to buy an Azuki to, a, get the token b, be part of the garden or whatever. Like, people will do it because it's Azuki.
00:19:54.432 - 00:19:57.024, Speaker B: Just like, I think pudgy Penguin wouldn't be the same, right?
00:19:57.064 - 00:19:57.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:57.272 - 00:20:08.036, Speaker B: Or even bored ape. Like, I don't care about buying a bored ape. And they're on ETH. I just don't care. But, like, eight people will buy eight nfts. It's just the way it is. So.
00:20:08.180 - 00:20:21.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. You know what? Collections have actually been kind of surprising me. There's one in particular. It's like one of the new 404 collections. Have you been, like, keeping tabs on that slightly?
00:20:21.772 - 00:20:22.584, Speaker B: Not really.
00:20:23.164 - 00:21:00.234, Speaker A: Like, more or less same. Like, I watch it because again, I think the token standard is really interesting with, like, that native fractionalization. But Pandora has the floor price on. Pandora has, like, kind of just gone down. And I think it's stabilized around four ETH. But if you look at Asterix, which is the DN 404 standard, like, they've pretty much maintained like a one eight floor, like they pumped earlier this month, and they've just kind of like been more or less stable. And I'm like, this is interesting.
00:21:01.414 - 00:21:03.222, Speaker B: Okay, who is asterisk?
00:21:03.358 - 00:21:16.214, Speaker A: Asterisk, vectorize. And I think, like, the folks that worked on the contract were like, ox quit, Saigar got it. That whole, like, I think they Avenger devs.
00:21:16.294 - 00:21:23.834, Speaker B: Right, right. So there was like ERC 404 and then there was DN 404 that came out right after it. And then wasn't there another one?
00:21:24.414 - 00:21:28.158, Speaker A: No, but there's a new one coming, which is BT 404.
00:21:28.286 - 00:21:29.694, Speaker B: That's what I was thinking of.
00:21:29.854 - 00:21:54.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, that's with underworld. So this one, I'm, I'm interested in this one too because, like, this is powered by floor. Like, this FLC's, like first time, like in terms of launching a collection. And as you know, the builder who actually made fractionalization, like, take off within the ETH NFT community, I think, like, there's definitely something interesting here.
00:21:55.314 - 00:22:00.746, Speaker B: I feel like this is going to be a conversation that we really need to dive into. When is the launch date? 404. Oh, shit.
00:22:00.770 - 00:22:03.074, Speaker A: So it's April 4 while we're in New York.
00:22:03.154 - 00:22:15.706, Speaker B: Happen when we're in New York. Wow. Dude. I think that this is going to be one of the, one of the things that we can really dive in on because I think erc. Four hundred four s and then Dn. Four hundred four s and DT 404. BT 404s.
00:22:15.706 - 00:22:35.474, Speaker B: Jesus Christ. This is like blur blast blend. But, like, I think that's something that people would probably be pretty interested in. And also like hybrid defi and all of the use cases that we're going to see that are NFT finance related are probably going to be big unlocks that we haven't really seen before.
00:22:36.294 - 00:23:20.958, Speaker A: Well, and then, like, imagine bt four launches takes off and you're talking about like, at what point do we see incentivization for these NFT collections to move over somewhere? Like, blast, like, if we see main net nfts moving over somewhere, someone's going to have to create a wrapper contract. Are they going to create a rapper contract using the 404 standard to, like, kind of fit? Because, like, I think blast, you say it all the time. It's like, so it's hyper financialized and we're already seeing, like, so many defi products on there. And I think it's kind of only natural that we see the main nfts on blast have some sort of financialization aspect.
00:23:21.086 - 00:23:22.070, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:23:22.222 - 00:23:41.302, Speaker A: So, like, that's something I'm really hyped about. And then if you remember, do you remember the builder spaces we did with wasabi? Yeah. And Aaron, like, just casually dropped that bomb of, like, yeah, we're looking at, like, building 404s over on blast and, like, incubating some projects when that's kind.
00:23:41.318 - 00:24:03.760, Speaker B: Of what I was thinking. I was like, I think NFT perps are probably going to be one of the biggest winners of blast. And, like, I'm positioning myself that way, like, we're going to touch on it a little bit later, like, what we have been farming. But I think NFT perps are one of those things that I'm just like, this just makes sense. And this has been, like, a long term thesis. You could go back through my tweets and nft perps, nft perps, nft perps. Like, it just makes sense to me because I think that if.
00:24:03.760 - 00:24:47.340, Speaker B: Whether you want $5 of. Of exposure or $50,000 or $500,000, obviously we're not there yet in terms of liquidity, but I do think that we get there, right? And it's so much easier and so much more efficient if we can get that down. Especially once you start integrating floor protocol, right? Like, if you integrate fractionalization on ETH mainnet, but it's on blast and you're paying literally less than a cent for gas fees. Dude, I think people start churning that out, but nobody wants to do it yet. And, like, also trading with leverage, like, leveraged trading on, like, fungible tokens is. I don't even need to talk to you about it. Like, you do it all the time, so tell me more.
00:24:47.340 - 00:25:12.968, Speaker B: I'm just like, leverage trading on NFts just makes so much sense to me. And I'm just like, why does nobody talk about this? I don't know. I think. I think we're just wicked early to that. And this will be one of the things that gets incentivized hardcore. And, like, also, something funny is, like, wasabi hasn't mentioned their blast gold kind of distribution or anything like that. And I'm just like, I'm.
00:25:12.968 - 00:25:19.040, Speaker B: I honestly hope that they keep doing that because I'm like, just keep your mouth shut. Like, that's, like, my number one farm right now.
00:25:19.072 - 00:25:21.752, Speaker A: I'm like, I know.
00:25:21.888 - 00:25:22.564, Speaker B: So.
00:25:24.344 - 00:25:35.192, Speaker A: Oh, God. Oh, what's this mintify does? I can't wait. I. Wait. I already established that. I don't know. That's how tired I am.
00:25:35.328 - 00:26:09.934, Speaker B: Jesus. Um, well, yeah, before we get into blast, I did want to shout out ordinals real quick. Um, this week has, they've pretty much trended sideways. Um, I still feel like there's hype there and kind of like we said with base last week, like, are we early? Are we not early? Are we like earlier than everybody else? And just like, you know, I feel like there have been some outliers. One that I want to show is obviously bitcoin puppets because I'm a puppet holder and I just like it. So show your bags. Thank you.
00:26:09.934 - 00:26:31.574, Speaker B: So they ripped up to like 0.33, which is epic. Like, they broke their all time high, so they were trending up and now they're retracing here a little bit. I do think that this is one of the projects to pay attention to over there, obviously. But aside from that, like, you can kind of see Runestone had a pretty tough week. Node monkeys down to 0.54. Ombudsman down sub .4
00:26:31.574 - 00:27:02.594, Speaker B: arcic down sub 0.04. Quantum cats, dude. Quantum cats at 0.25. That's fucking ridiculous. Like, I feel like these are the kind of times where you're just like, I feel like quantum cats at 0.25 is going to be one of those things where you look back and you're just like, damn, that was, that was a wicked buy. Um, but other than that, the other thing that I would say, I know I was just showing bitcoin puppets, but I think runes is going to be another one of those plays that, um, at this point nobody really understands what runes are.
00:27:02.594 - 00:27:05.574, Speaker B: And I don't know. Have you ever tried to buy a fungible token on bitcoin?
00:27:05.874 - 00:27:12.290, Speaker A: No. I was looking at the Unisats market and I was like, yeah, okay, so.
00:27:12.442 - 00:27:29.724, Speaker B: Let me just tell you, Unisat market. And it's not Unisat's fault. Like, I think BRC twenties are just pieces of shit. But like, I. You can't fill like partially fill orders. So, like, if you were to go here and press buy, you would have to like connect your wallet and everything like that. But you would have to buy.
00:27:29.724 - 00:27:48.740, Speaker B: Oh God, no, don't make me do that. But like you would have to buy all 1505 and $0.04. Like, you couldn't just buy like $5. You couldn't just buy $50. You have to buy that entire order. This order, same thing. This order, same thing.
00:27:48.740 - 00:28:30.952, Speaker B: So if somebody comes in and has like a $28,000 order, that's obviously going to, like, somebody has to fill that right. Which is like, it's super inefficient and I don't think that that's going to be the way that we go for like long term scaling. Like that's worked for, for Ord. It's worked for a couple other like SATS was another one. Pups is like currently sitting at like 20 million market cap, which is ridiculous. And I think once they go from pre runes and BRC twenties to runes, this is going to be one of those plays again that you're looking at like holy shit, like pop sitting at 20 million market cap just makes sense. And I just think the risk to reward here is like deeply in your favor.
00:28:30.952 - 00:28:51.018, Speaker B: And these are the kind of things that I try to pay attention to. Right. Like be early to a narrative. We know that runes is going to be a narrative. So just to kind of give some insight here, like runes are going to go live after the 840,000th block of bitcoin. So that's the happening block. So when that goes live, these marketplaces are going to get launched.
00:28:51.018 - 00:29:10.630, Speaker B: When the marketplaces get launched, they're supposed to be fungible tokens that you can trade naturally. Like we would see on like ERC 20s, right? And so I think as that happens, we're going to see meme coins get launched on. On bitcoin and things like that. And that's just going to be like a really. I think it's just going to be a really easy play if you're early to that.
00:29:10.742 - 00:30:02.842, Speaker A: Um, yeah, well I. I haven't looked too much into this, but I've noticed that like Bitcoin L two s is also a narrative that's taking off. I'm seeing a lot more on like the VC side of my timeline. So I think attention is there. I think it was really interesting at the beginning of the year, I was like, I feel like it's going to take us such a long time to really see the impacts of the ETF inflows because, you know, people are just adding it to their 401 ks, et cetera. But like the reality is, is that we saw kind of like an unprecedented move up towards all time high and now what? Bitcoins at like 71,000. And I think, you know, I know it sounds cliche and again, guys, not financial advice, but like this idea of hire for longer is.
00:30:02.842 - 00:30:29.334, Speaker A: I think it's there. And so I've been saying this, it's like, I think the idea is like quarter one, quarter two, you know, heavily, heavily farmed blast. I think blast will always be a core farm for me until, like, the air trap stops. But then, like, I want to cycle profits into bitcoin. Like, I have exposure on ETH. I have exposure on soul. Like, the place that I think is going to have the most reward is bitcoin.
00:30:29.334 - 00:30:36.864, Speaker A: And it's like you said, I would love to have capital there to try to be early to runes and get in there because I think it's going to be an obviously long run.
00:30:36.974 - 00:30:57.700, Speaker B: So, like you said, higher for longer, right? Like, I think that this is something that we're going to see. And like, dude, if the way that I look at ordinals and runes in general is just like, leverage the exposure to bitcoin, right? And so, like, I don't think bitcoin is going down. And if it does go down, one BTC is one BTC. Just like one ETH is one ETH. Like, I don't care. Like, I can't. I will hold that as much as I can.
00:30:57.700 - 00:30:59.148, Speaker B: Oh, what is this?
00:30:59.316 - 00:31:39.114, Speaker A: So this is defi llama and this is just like an overview on the Defi TVL across all chains. Like, and right now I'm just comparing, comparing TVL versus volume. Like, we're finally seeing an uptick in volume, but that TVL has, like, not moved to anywhere near what it was in 2022. Like, so it's like, it's like we're here almost. You know what I mean? And so I just, I saw, I was looking at this the other night and that's when, like, it really just cemented in my head. Like, yeah, higher for longer, for sure.
00:31:39.574 - 00:31:51.566, Speaker B: Well, no, dude, it makes sense. And I think. I think getting leveraged exposure to the things that you are most bullish on, like, I say this all the time to my buddies, is like, the end of the cycle for me is punks and squiggles.
00:31:51.710 - 00:31:52.486, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:31:52.630 - 00:32:18.582, Speaker B: Easy as that. Like I did. That's just how we end the cycle. And I think that going. I'm very, I have a very similar thought process with q one, q two, farm the shit out of blast, rotate into runes, into ordinals, maybe into Solana. Again, just depending upon how that looks. Like if we're looking at, um, like, this is by far one of my new favorite charts that I check almost every day.
00:32:18.582 - 00:32:57.140, Speaker B: Like, the inflows into Solana have just been consistent. If you look at the last 30 days, consistent like head and shoulders above other people. If you look at the last three months, I'd be interested to see this again. Like, it's just one of those places where I think you can park money nfts over there have been absolutely crushed. So I think that that's another place that you can probably safely park your money in terms of getting leveraged exposure to Solana, right? Just like ordinals, you could get leverage exposure to bitcoin. And just like punks and squiggles are leveraged exposure, in my opinion, to ethanol. Right? Like, I think ETH nfts will have a bounce back season at some point.
00:32:57.140 - 00:33:16.508, Speaker B: I think. I don't see it happening soon. I just don't, like, unless. Unless they bridge to blast or something like that. Like, I just don't see, like, a catalyst that really excites me. And going deeper into the bull market. People are not going to pay 400, 500, $600 to fucking do an ETH NFT.
00:33:16.508 - 00:33:18.476, Speaker B: I just don't. I just don't think it happens.
00:33:18.580 - 00:33:27.804, Speaker A: No, but they will pay for four to five to $600 to push through a transaction on uniswap because I know, because I did this last cycle.
00:33:28.264 - 00:33:53.130, Speaker B: But, dude, don't. Don't you think we've gotten past that? Like, don't you think that, like, dude, that, like, Solana is going to be the home of shitcoining, even, like, base is another one. And blast. So you have base, blast, and Solana, and then you're going to have fucking bitcoin meme coins. I broke bitcoin meme coins. Like, those are like two buzzwords for fucking normies. Like, especially if they have a good marketplace.
00:33:53.130 - 00:34:12.774, Speaker B: And right now, for the people that are wondering, the only two, like, maroon marketplaces that I know of are ord IO and LFG. There might be more. If there are more, put it in the comments. But if people start flipping fucking bitcoin meme coins, dude, think of, like, I just. That gets me so excited.
00:34:15.473 - 00:34:30.233, Speaker A: Look, like I do very, very minimum transactions on ETH mainnet right now, I haven't really done. If I'm doing anything, I'm either wrapping ETH to staked ETH or wrap staked ETH or unwrapping that shit.
00:34:30.273 - 00:34:31.345, Speaker B: And then I'm bridging.
00:34:31.489 - 00:35:12.122, Speaker A: Yeah, and then I'm bridging out either mostly been bridging to blast and then obviously starting to, like, bridge a little bit more over to base. But, you know, you have to remember, like, we've been in this space for years, Dalton. Like, we kind of know where to go. But I'm thinking people who are coming in for the first time, like, I could see, like, would be awesome if their first, like, defi exposure was to something like base. But also, like, I could see it being something like Ethereum, because you have a lot of, like, very bullish ethereum maxis out there that are going to be like, buy this, you know, supply liquidity on this defi platform. Supply on.
00:35:12.178 - 00:35:19.082, Speaker B: I just. I just don't think it happens. I just can't see it happening. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I have too much faith in the normies.
00:35:19.218 - 00:35:25.014, Speaker A: But I think you have too much faith in the normies. Dude, Djen's on, like, crypto Twitter. Don't read.
00:35:28.154 - 00:35:36.510, Speaker B: Okay, well, today is a big day because Jen minted her second ordinal. Her first real ordinal.
00:35:36.662 - 00:35:45.054, Speaker A: Well, I. This is the first one I minted because burials did I mint that. I think I bought it on secondary, so, um.
00:35:45.094 - 00:35:46.862, Speaker B: Well, congrats. How did it go?
00:35:46.998 - 00:36:25.714, Speaker A: It went well. Uh, I was five minutes late to the start time, and it was really nerve wracking, uh, just watching the transaction pending. I was like, oh, my God, is this what people do? And then my friend Duke, who came over to, like, hang out and, like, grab lunch, and he's like, yeah, I pushed through my transaction before I got out in the car to come over here. I have no idea if it went through. He gets here, opens up his laptop, and he's like, it's still pending. And I'm like, how is it still pending? Like, I think I put mine in, like, around the same time as you, and it finished in six minutes. Longest six minutes of my life.
00:36:25.714 - 00:36:30.998, Speaker A: But, uh, yeah. Does that experience get better? Like, is there any way to fix that?
00:36:31.086 - 00:36:36.942, Speaker B: So I'm just going to walk people through this real quick. So this right here is the mempool.
00:36:37.118 - 00:36:39.390, Speaker A: Uh, switch your tab.
00:36:39.422 - 00:36:50.054, Speaker B: Hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up. I'm not there yet. Ah, there we go. Okay, so this right here is the mempool. So these are blocks. Okay, so this is the next block. 20 minutes.
00:36:50.054 - 00:37:12.810, Speaker B: 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 51 minutes. Okay, these are the blocks that just passed. So when you push through a transaction, you're going to be paying, like, nine satoshis, right? Like, that is not going to. That's not going to work. Like, people are going to bid in front of you. So then, like, people front run you, and then you get pushed back, and then you get pushed back again. And then you get pushed back again because people keep front running you.
00:37:12.810 - 00:37:53.102, Speaker B: So, basically, when you push through a transaction, you have to make sure that you're paying, like, here, like, nine if you push through, like, twelve satoshis, you'd be completely fine, which is due the difference of, like, it's minimal, right? But like, if you look up here, this is ten Satoshi's, twelve Satoshi, nine satoshis. So, like, if you did twelve satoshis for a bid, like our priority fee or whatever, you'd be completely fine. Now, if you fucked up and you already pushed through the transaction, you can't go back and fix it. Here is a tool. It's called CPFP. I think it stands for child pays for parent. So it's like the second transaction pays for the first transaction, and it's a transaction speed up.
00:37:53.102 - 00:38:13.754, Speaker B: Now, this site right here has saved me so many freaking times, but it literally looks like windows, like 1992. And the first time somebody sent it to me, I was like, they're definitely hacking my shit. They are definitely hacking my shit. But I use it literally every time I push through a transaction now. So.
00:38:14.254 - 00:38:41.484, Speaker A: Okay, this is actually really interesting because, um, Inc. Has the last round of mints here in like, little less than 2 hours. And right now you're only able to, like, mint on magic Eden. So, like, you pull up magic Eden and you'll see a button that says mint. So you're saying I could hit that? Take my transaction hash, go to that site that you just showed me, stick it in there and speed it up.
00:38:43.044 - 00:39:01.464, Speaker B: People are going to, like, front run the fuck out of you. So, like, they will get their bids filled before you. Um, but, yeah, like, if you got your bid in, then it would be fine. So this is the launchpad right now. Oh, dude, so there's actually 800 left?
00:39:02.244 - 00:39:11.652, Speaker A: Yeah. No way do 800 slots. Front run me. I feel like this is going to be like a crazy grab to try to get.
00:39:11.828 - 00:39:13.828, Speaker B: Okay, wait a second. Point.
00:39:13.876 - 00:39:18.544, Speaker A: So basically, yeah, everybody watching right now.
00:39:18.884 - 00:39:20.504, Speaker B: You did not see that.
00:39:20.884 - 00:39:22.344, Speaker A: This is some alpha.
00:39:23.084 - 00:39:26.664, Speaker B: Yeah, so, like, that's actually what I'm gonna do right now.
00:39:27.284 - 00:39:29.388, Speaker A: Do you, are you eligible? I can't see.
00:39:29.516 - 00:39:31.464, Speaker B: Well, first come, first serve. No, I'm not.
00:39:33.644 - 00:39:34.424, Speaker A: Wow.
00:39:36.244 - 00:39:36.716, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:39:36.740 - 00:39:41.344, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna need you to send me that link afterwards.
00:39:42.444 - 00:39:44.064, Speaker B: If you say please.
00:39:44.644 - 00:39:46.504, Speaker A: Please, sir.
00:39:47.404 - 00:39:53.316, Speaker B: Dope. Well, cool. We'll figure that out. We got a, we got 15 minutes here, and I'm gonna send over some bitcoin.
00:39:53.500 - 00:39:56.388, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, cool.
00:39:56.516 - 00:40:00.548, Speaker B: I didn't realize that there was that many left in the, in the public sale.
00:40:00.716 - 00:40:02.596, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty exciting.
00:40:02.740 - 00:40:03.424, Speaker B: Cool.
00:40:04.394 - 00:40:36.366, Speaker A: Okay, moving over to blast quick highlights. Sss, which I think is super samurai sushi. When I was trying to record my fucking video. Do you know how many times I fucked up saying that? I was just like, this is hard tldr there. About a week ago, there was a white hat hack, and we just saw the token. Absolutely tank looked like the dev brugged. But the team was actually able to recover all the funds, and they've restored the project, so I think there's some recovery there.
00:40:36.366 - 00:41:24.500, Speaker A: And then obviously, the big, big one that caught everyone's attention and that kind of just, like, kept everyone glued to the timeline was munchables. Um, high level. Basically, to mint a munchable, you had to lock ETH or USDB. And for every one ethanol or equivalent that you locked into, this lock drop contract gave you one free munchable mint. And so this actually opened on February 27, and people had been depositing, depositing, but then all of a sudden, like, everyone is rushing over to blast because the first blast gold distribution happened. Munchables was a big bang winner, and they had a pretty sizable allocation. So we just saw people ape in that contract.
00:41:24.500 - 00:42:04.176, Speaker A: TPL grew, like, literally 25 million, 45 million, 80 million, 97 million day after day. Long story here. The dev was outsourced. It's speculated that he was from North Korea and that the contract was actually malicious from, like, deployment. There was, like, code in there that it was like, hey, I, as the dev, could say that my balance is a million ETH, and so I'll be able to withdraw a million ETH from the contracts. So that was wild. We saw 62 and a half million dollars get drained.
00:42:04.176 - 00:42:25.032, Speaker A: We saw all bridges on and off of blast get halted, and then insane heated debates on the timeline. But then basically late in the evening, Pac Man's like, yeah, we've secured all the funds. We. We're not rolling back the blockchain, and we're going to coordinate, you know, the distribution of this. So.
00:42:25.208 - 00:42:27.684, Speaker B: Dude, that was insanity.
00:42:27.984 - 00:42:53.664, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I I. So I'm actually curious about your opinion, because, you know, I'm sure you saw it, but all over my timeline was, like, ct arguing whether or not Pac man should have rolled back the chain. And, like, concepts of decentralization versus, like, user security. I don't fucking know, but what are. What are your thoughts on that?
00:42:54.804 - 00:43:40.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think we live in a bubble, and I think we like to think that everything is decentralized. And this is something that we've seen multiple times, right? We've seen massive hacks before. Like, and, like, if it is completely decentralized, like, you're fucked now because blast was relatively new and still is relatively new. It's only been a month old. Like, these things are going to happen now. I think the deeper question here is why the fuck do these keep happening? And why is this going to be a systemic problem? The reason why so many projects are having this issue, a, they couldn't find auditors.
00:43:40.538 - 00:43:59.258, Speaker B: B, they were rushed because that, and this is what I've heard from teams. Like, dude, we had a hard time finding auditors. What I've heard it from three teams now. And they're like, we legitimate teams swear I'm not going to put them on air. But like, yeah. And I was just like, how do.
00:43:59.266 - 00:44:01.898, Speaker A: You have a hard time finding an auditor, bro?
00:44:01.986 - 00:44:16.348, Speaker B: Dude, we have a brand new ecosystem that is incentivized to fuck again for to like, push things out super quick. And how, how long did they have? How long did they have to make all this stuff?
00:44:16.516 - 00:44:33.308, Speaker A: A couple months. You, you have to remember blast is EVM. So, like, true. So, but like, wasabi, for example, they're on ETH mainnet. They literally use the exact same contracts on ETH mainnet on block.
00:44:33.356 - 00:45:11.284, Speaker B: Wasabi. Wasabi is an ETH project. We're talking new projects. And now not only that, Pac man is coming out and saying like, yeah, actually, if you have projects on other, on other chains, go fuck yourself. So now you're putting people in this position where they're like, okay, cool, like, now we have to be like, and we can touch on multipliers. But like, I think the systemic issue here was that we put a timeline on people that are incentivized now to push out product before they're ready because they want blast gold. The one of the projects that I'm actually really proud of is fantasy.
00:45:11.284 - 00:45:32.824, Speaker B: Right? Fantasy was a winner of the, of the big bang. And they have so much usage. They have like 10,000 people using their platform every day. Now they're on testnet. They haven't gone live. They aren't trying to get a bunch of TVL and they could like, dude, I would put my funds over there, but they aren't ready. And so this is something that I think we're going to continue to see.
00:45:33.684 - 00:45:39.852, Speaker A: But, but I don't think you can blame that on the incentives. Like, bro, if you have, if you.
00:45:39.868 - 00:45:46.664, Speaker B: Have a billion dollars that's going to get unlocked, what are these people going to do? They're like, yeah, no, fuck it. Like, we'll risk it.
00:45:47.244 - 00:45:50.420, Speaker A: But I just feel like you don't bet on teams like that.
00:45:50.532 - 00:46:21.104, Speaker B: You know what I mean, of course, of course. But like, look, so when you go about your. Your due diligence and you're looking at how many people are shilling something, now look, look at CBB. CBB was on the Munchables team, or that had at least like given to the seed round. There was like five or six people that I trust not to be shilling a piece of shit. Fair, right? And we never saw that coming. Sss.
00:46:21.104 - 00:46:48.006, Speaker B: Another one that just like. And I was just like, what the fuck? Crypto valleys. If this happened to crypto valleys, how many people would be screwed? So many people. And it's because somebody shilled something to somebody that's. And it's like, this is the CT game and we're all trying to play the exact same game on a playing field that has fucking potholes all over the place because they were incentivized to produce this product, go live as fast as we can. And. But that's just what we're seeing.
00:46:48.006 - 00:46:52.022, Speaker B: Because if they're in testnet, they're not getting blast gold, right?
00:46:52.118 - 00:47:32.862, Speaker A: But it's not like the only airdrop that's happening on blast is in May. I think, like, you calling, I agree, is like a really good call out. Like, I've enjoyed continuing to use fantasy testnet today even while I'm still on Mainnet. I think the problem is, I don't, I'm sorry, I don't buy the excuse that it's like we can't find an auditorium. Like, there are so many reputable auditors in this space that have either audited, like apecoin contracts, like blur contracts, blast contracts, and to find these, you just go to their docs. You can literally go and see who the hell audited blur. Let me get in touch.
00:47:32.862 - 00:48:17.198, Speaker A: I think the real constraint is getting good auditors. Having active bug bounty programs is expensive. Expensive. And so for these teams that are bootstrapping, I understand that that could be harder. It could be really cool to see maybe some ecosystem support from blast come up to kind of like prop up the security side of things. But I listen, like, I'm honestly glad I was in the desert around the munchables craze because I think if you're spot on, if I would have saw it and especially seeing the names that we're posting about it, like dingling, CBB and so many others, I definitely probably would have tried to throw something like, something in there. And so, like, that was a bullet dodged.
00:48:17.198 - 00:48:54.044, Speaker A: But I also think that for anyone that's paying attention, this is like a huge wake up call on, like, we really should be doing our due diligence. We really should be checking to make sure contracts are audited and audited by who. And like, I think there are things that we as users can better do to protect ourselves. And I think there's definitely more that blast can do to support builders by like, providing some security support. But I don't necessarily agree that, like, the, how incentivized blast is, is the thing that's causing all of these builders to rush and ship shitty projects.
00:48:54.344 - 00:49:12.914, Speaker B: I don't know. I disagree with you there. But I do see, I do see quality projects, like, hanging back. That being said, like, I also see people seeing the opportunity. And this is where scammers come in. And I'm not saying that these are quality projects. All they have to do is fool one person.
00:49:12.914 - 00:49:47.502, Speaker B: If they fool one person, then this person's like, oh, okay, cool, I'll go in. Yeah, right? And now this is something that I see, like, working for the, the company that I work for. When you go into rounds right now, if you go to influencers and say one month lock and then the tokens are yours, dude, they'll sign it. Because, like, right now, how many times have teams approached you and said like six month, twelve month lock? I'm like, twelve month lock, bro. I don't, I don't even know if we're going to be here in 2025. So then I'm just like, maybe. I don't know.
00:49:47.502 - 00:49:53.360, Speaker B: But then if a team comes up and says one month lock, then I'd be like, hmm, pretty interesting, right?
00:49:53.472 - 00:49:53.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:53.984 - 00:50:29.406, Speaker B: And then it fills, especially if it says base or blast on it. And that's just the case, like that. And this is where I think you and I are very passionate about sharing this information. And we're privy to conversations that people watching this necessary, not, aren't necessarily privy to those conversations. And that's where I think you and I need to do a really good job of doing the due diligence, which I think we do, and like, saying no to quick money to trust teams that are actually building something legit. And that's why I call, that's why I call out fantasy, right? I'm like super proud of that team. If we're talking about other farms that I'm farming right now, I'm farming NFT perp.
00:50:29.406 - 00:51:02.454, Speaker B: I'm farming wasabi, meta Street LCt. Like, that's one that I need to get access to or get exposure to. Like, those are teams that I trust and, like, we've known them from the ETH, NFT fi space in the NFT, like, ecosystem. I think blastopians is, like, a. A reputable team with esk and creed alpha and stuff like that. But outside of that, I think blast snipers is the only one that I really, at this point, know and would rep, or at least feel decent repping. And I don't know that team very, very well.
00:51:02.454 - 00:51:20.566, Speaker B: But outside of that, I'm just kind of staying back and trying to do my due diligence. Right. And then also in gamefly, I think, district one, doing, like, this friend tech style thing again. Haven't talked to the team. I think it's interesting. I'm not putting more money over there than I'd be willing to lose, because I just don't know. But, like, look, hold on.
00:51:20.590 - 00:51:21.222, Speaker A: Look who it is.
00:51:21.278 - 00:51:24.334, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go, bro. See? Look. That's what I'm saying.
00:51:24.454 - 00:51:25.422, Speaker A: Let's fucking go.
00:51:25.518 - 00:51:41.954, Speaker B: But, like, this is. This is the type of founder that I want to be around. This is the kind of founder that I would bet on. Somebody that's paying attention to the space, somebody that's not incentivized to do. Like, they're not giving into the incentivization bullshit. So, um, definitely here for it. Travis, keep doing your thing, brother.
00:51:41.954 - 00:51:44.306, Speaker B: That's. I'm total fan, so we.
00:51:44.370 - 00:51:46.322, Speaker A: We love fantasy, if you can't tell.
00:51:46.418 - 00:51:51.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I shill it every day. I got a million fan points, baby.
00:51:51.266 - 00:51:58.170, Speaker A: You're. It's funny. It's like we're kind of split. Like, I'm top of the leaderboard for Pac Moon, and then you're top of the leaderboard for fantasy.
00:51:58.242 - 00:52:03.090, Speaker B: I know. I got. I just got 30 more ref links. I might travis up those numbers, baby. I'm coming for more.
00:52:03.202 - 00:52:50.144, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I fucking love it. Yeah. So I think you're spot on. Look, I think one of the things that will be really interesting, especially when we're in New York, is you guys are going to get to kind of see how we talk to founders, how we talk to projects, how we get to dig in. But I think key things to look for, in case you're curious, it's like, one, are the contracts audited? Like, I cannot stress this enough, and if it's a smaller team, I think one audit is generally acceptable. But if it's a contract that has a large amount of TVL or a platform that's going to somehow garner a large amount of TVL, whether that's perps, they have vaults, et cetera there should be multiple auditors on that shit.
00:52:50.144 - 00:53:39.992, Speaker A: We, you need to also keep an eye out on whether or not projects have active bounty programs. We want to see founders who are proactive about their security. And then, you know, there's obviously stuff around contract verification, whether the contracts are immutable or not, or whether the contracts are upgradable. And if they're upgradable by proxy, you know, as someone who was at a platform that experienced an exploit, like, there are going to be times where we may see hacks and things happen. Even if a team and protocol has like all of these t's, all of these t's crossed and I's dotted, it just happens. Like this space is the Wild west. So I think that's just something to keep in mind, but at least cover your baseline minimum.
00:53:39.992 - 00:54:04.868, Speaker A: And if you want, not to show my own content, but I did go through and basically summarized and recompiled and talked to a lot of the teams that I have capital on and saw summarize like some of these main security points. So like, check that out. And I think, Dalton, if we are making breakdown videos about projects, making threads about projects, that's just info we can be start making sure we include, you know.
00:54:04.916 - 00:54:32.324, Speaker B: Right, right. No, I 100% agree. I think that this is, and like you, you can, you can take as much risk as you want, but at the end, like, you can do as much due diligence as you want as well. Right? Like, I think that this is one of the things that, like, like Jen said, like you could do everything right and you can still get fucked. And that's just, that's just the nature of the beast. It's the nature of the space. But that being said, like, I think that doing due diligence you can, you can sleep a little bit easier.
00:54:32.404 - 00:55:35.150, Speaker A: But like, look, I know the whole idea of crypto and web three is obviously decentralization and permissionless finance and this idea of like trustless contracts where you're not having to trust anyone and you can just like trust the smart contract code, but the reality is we are in a space where we still have to trust the developers and the teams behind these projects and protocols and, you know, if they're not giving you as a community member, as a user time of day, whether that's through like, community, Ama's constantly having updates, constantly having comms, that's a red flag to me. Like, I like teams that are proactive. So, yeah, I. Okay, I know we're almost out of time, but I do, I did want to share one screen. So obviously, with the munchables hack, we saw mass panic until they halted the bridges. People are bridging off of blast. Like, you can kind of see that here.
00:55:35.150 - 00:55:44.954, Speaker A: Like, the TVL drops, like, a tiny bit. But I don't know if you see this. Do you notice, like, the uptick in new wallets that are coming?
00:55:45.294 - 00:56:00.274, Speaker B: Shut up. Shut up. This is alpha. I'm like, I'm over here in my farmer era, and Jen's like, everybody, the wallets are coming. I'm like, God fucking damn it.
00:56:01.134 - 00:56:08.144, Speaker A: Okay, well, so that concludes today's episode of remarriage.
00:56:09.444 - 00:56:15.196, Speaker B: But it is crazy to see. And, like, dude, you see it all over the timeline, right? Like, it is all over the timeline.
00:56:15.300 - 00:56:34.088, Speaker A: I honestly think how the munchables hack or exploit was handled was just bullish. Like, I think any participant on any other chain watching that, like, you don't have to, like, blast, but you have to respect it. I do. I did see, like, quite a few folks say, like, I'm bridging more over.
00:56:34.216 - 00:56:46.884, Speaker B: Yeah. Um, no, I definitely agree. Definitely agree. Um, do we want to do a rapid fire on. Actually, you know, what do we talk about district one?
00:56:47.944 - 00:56:49.624, Speaker A: Not yet, no.
00:56:49.784 - 00:57:14.390, Speaker B: Um, quick little. This is one of the other ones that I'm paying attention to. Um, I think it's pretty interesting seeing some of these share prices. I'm still learning my day to day right here. $245 for Creed Alpha. That sounds like a buy to me, especially because top spaces are going for, like, 1500. It's kind of all over the place.
00:57:14.390 - 00:57:24.954, Speaker B: Like, this is pretty intimidating. That being said, it's definitely something I'm going to be paying attention to, and I'm pretty excited for remnant reality to get involved.
00:57:25.474 - 00:57:40.394, Speaker A: That's Amalfa. You're yelling at me. You shut up, Dalton. You shut up. No, I'm super stoked that you're digging into district one. Like, it's not that I don't like the platform. I definitely love the idea of the platform.
00:57:40.394 - 00:57:51.210, Speaker A: But you know how you told me you went on to Yolo games and you're like. And your anxiety just went through the roof? When I look at district one, that's exactly what happens, bro.
00:57:51.242 - 00:58:07.414, Speaker B: It is so loud. The UI is, like, fucking insane. I'm like, guys, it's true. I don't know if you guys are, like, trying to get zoomers in here and, like, trying to keep them entertained or something, but, like, I'm 29 and I'm like, this is a lot. I don't.
00:58:07.494 - 00:58:14.654, Speaker A: I feel like, I need to be on, like, Adderall and, like, have a fuck ton of soda and, like, coffee and caffeine energy drinks to be on there.
00:58:14.694 - 00:58:16.994, Speaker B: Like, hundred percent, 100%.
00:58:17.374 - 00:58:50.874, Speaker A: But, yeah, keep an eye out. So I think just a heads up, everyone. Next week, we'll probably be skipping the podcast because we have a couple of IRL podcasts that we're going to be filming in New York. We have. I'm trying to figure out what I want to say, and I think what I want to say is, dalton one, I am so glad that we connected and that we just clicked and we knew that. It's like, dude, we can do this together. It's been so nice having what feels like a team and someone that I can, like, talk to every single day, because I think.
00:58:50.874 - 00:58:54.934, Speaker A: I think it's going to be a really big week for us next week, so.
00:58:55.014 - 00:58:57.674, Speaker B: Yeah. Got some special guests?
00:58:58.894 - 00:59:12.534, Speaker A: Yeah, we do. All righty, guys. Well, you know how it goes. We won't catch you next week, but we'll catch you the week after. As always, all 443 of you. Thanks for tuning in.
00:59:12.694 - 00:59:13.654, Speaker B: Ciao, guys. Bye.
