00:00:00.160 - 00:00:20.502, Speaker A: Honestly, like, and this is, bro, this is tuition, right? Like, I think tuition is part of the game. And, like, you need to be paying attention to, like, how. How you find your edge. And I, like, you're touching on Cielo a little bit. And, like, I got to speak with Matt today, who is the founder over there. And, like, there are so many public tools that you can use that they give you so much edge. So much edge.
00:00:20.502 - 00:00:30.954, Speaker A: And I was just like, dude, what the fuck? Like, he was like, yo, so you could check this. And this is a public list. And this is this, and this is that. And I was like, this is free. Like, yeah. Why is this free?
00:00:32.854 - 00:00:54.934, Speaker B: Well, if you think about it, like, this is the beauty of this space is that everything is literally public. It's just a matter of knowing where to look. And I think for me, it's like, how can I generate my own alpha? Instead of waiting for it to get sent into a group chat or waiting for myself to see it on a timeline? I would love to just be one of the first people to see it on chain.
