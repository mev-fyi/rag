00:00:00.160 - 00:00:01.158, Speaker A: Hey, guys, it's Jen.
00:00:01.246 - 00:00:02.182, Speaker B: Hi, it's Dalton.
00:00:02.278 - 00:00:16.694, Speaker A: And this is episode three of remit reality. It's, um. This one's an exciting one, partially because one, it's the end of the year, and so we brought on some really awesome guests. But, dude, Dalton, how are you doing?
00:00:16.814 - 00:00:27.010, Speaker B: I'm doing fantastic. Tomorrow I go on vacation. Um, I'm excited to go see the family. I'm going to get to go. Oh, my mom's going to be watching. My mom doesn't know I'm going home yet. That's fine.
00:00:27.010 - 00:00:36.226, Speaker B: She won't know. I just, like, fucking ruined that, but that's fine. Front pets pumping. Everything's good. I'm happy. No, it's good. Life is good.
00:00:36.226 - 00:00:40.658, Speaker B: I'm super pumped on the show, and. Yeah, that's it, dude.
00:00:40.746 - 00:01:01.264, Speaker A: I just want to say, it's like, this year has been wild. We had the Ethereum merge. We had SPF trials. We had NFTs being dead according to mainstream media like Pac man entering into the lending space. So it's been jam packed. And who better to break it down with us than our friend Tang and our friend Ben. Hey, guys.
00:01:01.264 - 00:01:08.172, Speaker A: Welcome to the stage, Tang, Ben, if you want to give a little bit of an introduction, and we'll get started.
00:01:08.308 - 00:01:23.980, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks for having me here. Really excited to be part of this show and talk about nfts and stuff. So I'm Tang. I lead our NFT research at Delphi Digital. So basically, fully immersed in the space. Very excited about the future.
00:01:23.980 - 00:01:30.508, Speaker C: I truly believe that NFTs are going to transform the world. It's going to be a very big part of everything that we do, and I'm here for it.
00:01:30.556 - 00:01:31.384, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:01:32.724 - 00:01:56.864, Speaker D: Let's go, man. My name's Ben. I'm super stoked to chat NFts with you guys. I feel like we do this privately anyway, so it's fun just to get on a recording and talk shop and talk through the year. I guess the one line thing for me is I'm primarily an angel investor in crypto, mostly companies that work with nfTs. Kind of this crypto and culture intersection have been into NFT finance since 2020. So, like, let's go.
00:01:56.864 - 00:01:58.616, Speaker D: It's almost four years at this point.
00:01:58.760 - 00:02:00.032, Speaker A: Ben, you're an OG.
00:02:00.168 - 00:02:00.924, Speaker D: Excited.
00:02:02.024 - 00:02:15.364, Speaker A: Absolute Og. Okay, before we, like, dig in, the first question I want to ask you guys, what is the biggest win you've had this year, and then what's the biggest l you've seen or experienced?
00:02:16.334 - 00:02:39.674, Speaker B: I don't think I could say my biggest l biggest, biggest w would be Solana. Like I said before the show, I was just kind of, every single paycheck this over the past year, I was just throwing. I was allocating as much as I could over there, just waiting for that blow up to happen. And it happened. So I'm definitely pumped on that. Biggest L. Moonbirds.
00:02:39.674 - 00:02:47.184, Speaker B: Sorry, guys, but, yeah, moonbirds is definitely my biggest sell. So moving on.
00:02:49.884 - 00:03:29.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually am pretty similar to Dalton. I think my biggest win was really being in Solana, just both the Solana token as well as the Solana NFt ecosystem. We've actually been covering Solana NFTs since the later part of last year and quite well acquainted with the tensor team and, you know, just seeing what they were doing in the space, how they were, you know, eating away at measured Eden's, like, market share, like, every single day made me bullish on, like, what was going on. Um, yeah, so I think that was, that was definitely the biggest win of the year. Things still will continue to do well. Um, I think the biggest l. I don't know, man.
00:03:29.590 - 00:03:48.994, Speaker C: I think, unfortunately probably was the Azuki stuff. You know, I still use an Azuki as my PFP is still part of my identity intention to change that. But, um, yeah, it's unfortunate that, um. Yeah, that it's falling quite a bit this year. Like 50, 60%. So, um, I'm still holding it.
00:03:49.294 - 00:03:56.394, Speaker A: Yeah, you and me both. Bag holding a suki. That's my biggest l two. Ben, what's your biggest win?
00:03:57.454 - 00:04:24.826, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like. Excuse me. Um, Solana and that whole ecosystem is probably also my biggest win. I had a couple like Memeland did well, unibot did well. Maybe the only, like, original one that I did well on was prime. So I was into parallel. I've been into that whole scene for a lot of the last two years, so had a good entry, and then it's always fun to look good when the price goes up and it's like, see, I told you so.
00:04:24.826 - 00:04:53.390, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I feel like those are some of the wins, for sure. Biggest loss, mostly just having conviction in certain things and not acting on them. So I was in some shitcoin. I forget which, what it was. I think it was actually DMT on, on arbitrum. And instead of being in that or instead of being in prime, like, in way bigger size, I was in that and it, like, got wrecked. And then you sit there and think, wow, I could have just, you know, bought the good coins and done nothing and had a holiday and been up so much bigger.
00:04:53.390 - 00:04:59.764, Speaker D: So it's always humbling. Right? I feel like no matter how long you're around, you just. Yeah, have to keep it tight.
00:05:00.184 - 00:05:13.600, Speaker B: I told you. I told you season is my favorite season. Like, I'm not petty. I'm petty. No, I'm definitely petty. But, like, I told you, season is definitely my favorite. I'm just like, that's right, bro.
00:05:13.600 - 00:05:18.656, Speaker B: I fucking told you. And that it. That it just feels so good. I don't know, Jen.
00:05:18.760 - 00:05:42.004, Speaker A: Biggest w. My little pudgy, pudgy penguins. My biggest win and then biggest l is actually, like, definitely a combination of what Tang and Ben said. Like, Azuki elementals wrecked my portfolio because I sold out of everything. Like, I full on FOMo'd into that mint. I was like, I'm gonna mint this elemental beans. Like, I was ready.
00:05:42.004 - 00:06:03.494, Speaker A: I was refreshing the page. So that was fun for the 30 seconds that it was. And then it was just like a reality shock afterwards. And then to Ben's point, I think, like, you know, I had met with a few soul founders, and I thought what they were doing was really cool. I thought they were really smart guys. And I kept being like, oh, I need to look into soul. I need to look into soul.
00:06:03.494 - 00:06:15.862, Speaker A: And, like, kept pushing it off. And then, Dalton, I met you, and you're like, solana, bro. And I was like, I need to look into soul. That's right. And then by the time I looked into soul, it is, like, soaring. And it's like, that's on me, though.
00:06:15.918 - 00:06:16.086, Speaker B: That.
00:06:16.110 - 00:06:21.544, Speaker A: That was a huge learning lesson of, like, if you keep pushing off the research, you're never going to make the plays.
00:06:22.124 - 00:06:40.580, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's. That's honestly the space, right? And, like, this is my third cycle, and, like, we're going into my third cycle. And I. I think those are lessons that you have to learn. And so for anybody listening that hasn't been around, and maybe nfts were their introduction to the space. Like, getting wrecked is your tuition, and it sucks, dude. Like, I.
00:06:40.732 - 00:06:41.212, Speaker C: That's.
00:06:41.268 - 00:06:58.044, Speaker B: It's the name of the game. And how many times have I lost? Made six figures off of three or four figures and then lost six figures. Like, it's just what happens, dude. And it's an unfortunate part of the game, but we're lucky to be here. And now we get to look at the past year where we all lost money.
00:06:58.944 - 00:07:35.964, Speaker A: Yes, we do. Speaking of that, you guys can see here, you know, so this was a dune that I found that basically just covers trading volume on ETH over 2023. And Dalton, I know we're going to cover. Cover Solana a little bit as well. But I was just looking at this, and it's like, what, 12 billion in volume traded? But, like, you could just see here, like, throughout the year, we just see this, like, steady decline in volume. Like, any thoughts on this? Like, tang, I'm sure you look at this every single day, and Ben, as someone who's trading in the space, you probably felt this, especially when it really started to dry up.
00:07:36.124 - 00:08:03.500, Speaker D: Yeah, it was, like, apocalyptic for a lot of the year, honestly. Um, no real liquidity. Everything just kind of down, um, or sideways. People were trying to figure out when it would turn right. Like, is it the summer? Is that the bottom? Is it Labor Day? Is that the bottom? Um. But the uptick at the end of the year is a nice validation of, like, okay, I think we're kind of turning the corner here. Uh, it's just, you know, most people wouldn't have predicted that out front.
00:08:03.500 - 00:08:21.744, Speaker D: Um, and so I think it took a lot of people by surprise just to see, okay, stuff's going up. And the way these things trade, too, is because there's such little liquidity. Any surge of excitement makes the price go up a lot. And it's super reflexive, right. That draws everyone in, and it's like, wow, a pudgy penguin is up this much already. How is this possible? But there's just. Because it's.
00:08:21.744 - 00:08:27.304, Speaker D: There's not that many listed ultimately. Right. And then, you know, stuff just spirals from there.
00:08:27.464 - 00:08:28.584, Speaker C: Something that.
00:08:28.744 - 00:08:29.768, Speaker B: Oh, go ahead, tang.
00:08:29.896 - 00:08:54.073, Speaker C: Oh, sorry. I was just going to add to, like, what Ben said. I think one of the things that led to, like, this year to be pretty much sideways to download. I think we just haven't seen any new people enter the space. It's the same people who's trading nfTs, rotating between different projects and stuff. But even up to the day, I think there is still very limited new interest in NFTs yet. I think that would change.
00:08:54.073 - 00:08:57.773, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think that's one of the big factors.
00:08:57.813 - 00:09:44.584, Speaker B: I think something that Sam says all the time. Sam, NFT stats, he talks about nfts being a momentum based asset, right? And that's something that we saw in the space, that as they go up, they go up hard. Like, day over day. Like, those things can pump like nothing we've ever really seen. But the same is to be said for going down, right? Like, it goes down, it goes down hard. One of the questions that I have here is about the post blur era. So blur comes in earlier this year, they introduced what we thought was going to be like limit orders, right? Like these, these bid offers that, that people are going to like buy nfts at this price and they're going to wait for price to drop and then they're going to get their order filled and then it's going to pump again.
00:09:44.584 - 00:10:16.956, Speaker B: Like, that's kind of how we thought about these, these bids in the beginning. And people were like, the market's so much more efficient. Yeah, that didn't work right. And then they had to incentivize people with points and blur bid points and all of that kind of stuff. And we really haven't seen any projects pump post blur except for captains and potatoes and pudgy penguins. And the reason captains and potatoes pump are kind of like unaffected by this is because they're royalty enabled. Um, so people are paying royalties on that.
00:10:16.956 - 00:10:56.878, Speaker B: Therefore, blurb farmers don't really want to mess with them. And then the pudgy side, they are really the only outlier here. Um, so we've seen this recent pump pudgies have gone from what, like they were at three to like twelve ETH in the span of a month and a half, two months. Uh, might be my time, my time frame might be off a little bit. But, um, do you think that this pump kind of stays in how? Like they, they have maintained a double digit floor to this point, but do you think that they're going to kind of get like this, this bloodbathy farmers kind of playing hot potato with these unwanted nfts? Or are pudgies different?
00:10:56.966 - 00:11:31.134, Speaker C: I think, like, two things come to mind. Like, one is that like, nfts are very much an attention game. It's about like, which project can generate the greatest mind share among people. And definitely, I think pudgies have been doing that very well. Right? With their recent, like, Walmart announcements, their toys, like, going, you know, very everywhere and on Instagram, they're getting a lot of attention. Even my girlfriend, who isn't a crypto person at all, she follows the pudgy penguins Instagram page and she loves them so much. Yeah, it's amazing.
00:11:31.134 - 00:11:34.814, Speaker C: So I had to buy one of those plushies for her.
00:11:36.314 - 00:11:38.974, Speaker B: What a good boyfriend. What a good. Let's go, man.
00:11:39.314 - 00:11:41.010, Speaker A: The plushies are cute.
00:11:41.202 - 00:12:06.214, Speaker C: They're very cute, though, I must say, they are pretty cute. I have one of them right here, so it's pretty nice. Yeah. So I think there's one thing that's the attention game. Like, can you continue to sustain attention and if the pudgies can continue to do that in 2024 with new announcements, partnerships, I think you'll continue to do well. Yeah, I kind of forgot my second point, so I lost a little bit my train of thought there, but yeah.
00:12:07.114 - 00:12:46.294, Speaker D: I can pick up there. I feel like it's interesting when you look at the NFT, I'm just on blur scrolling around, trying to catch up a bit about what's kind of been going on over the last little while. When you look at what's done well, all of the projects that, that stick out, like the ones that you've mentioned, Memeland and pudgies, but also stuff like parallel avatars or Pixelmon has done well, they've kind of been able to shoot their own shot and create attention around themselves in a way that's independent of just nfts. Right. Pudgies like, to Tang's point, like, the memes have proliferated very effectively to normal people. Memeland has nine gag, and you're just gathering so much attention from that that you're able to, you know, they dropped a token. There's kind of a reason why those things are pumping.
00:12:46.294 - 00:13:10.034, Speaker D: Parallel has had a big run. So, yeah, when I look at kind of what the outliers are, it's mostly because, or these things have performed well, mostly because they're able to collect attention from elsewhere, not from the NFT. Little bit of capital that's sloshing around because for the most part, stuff's still kind of flat. Of course, we're up a little bit off the bottom. But, you know, what's a clone? A clone is 1.39 ETH. It's not like it's up huge amount or something.
00:13:10.034 - 00:13:20.210, Speaker D: Right. That's, that's still pretty close to the floor, and I think most stuff is there. So, yeah, I think it's just what projects have been able to collect attention from elsewhere.
00:13:20.402 - 00:13:25.354, Speaker B: Yeah, the, the token drop is something that pudgies do have going for them for sure.
00:13:25.474 - 00:13:26.882, Speaker A: I mean, they haven't even announced a.
00:13:26.898 - 00:13:30.254, Speaker B: Token drop yet, but, like, the rumors are like, like.
00:13:30.674 - 00:13:59.788, Speaker A: But that's. But there it is. Like, they have our attention. And I do just have to say, say, like, I feel like this pump for Pudgy was not out of nowhere, you know, like, even after the Walmart announcement, I think the floor at the time was only like six or seven ETH or sitting around there. It hadn't even hit double digits. And it's just like, I think pudgy, in my opinion. Well, Pudgy and Pixelmon I feel like are two of the collections that I've just seen, like, steadily rise over the year.
00:13:59.788 - 00:14:15.032, Speaker A: And it wasn't necessarily one big event or one big announcement or one massive catalyst that, like, really pushed it over. So I don't see it going anywhere. I think pudgies might be flipping some of people's favorite blue chips in 2024. It's already flipped quite a few.
00:14:15.128 - 00:14:29.896, Speaker B: Yeah, no, definitely agree with that. I think that they, like you said, they've maintained the tension. I wouldn't be surprised if farmers play hot potato. And I also think something else that is going for pudgies is, like, they only have 55. 55. Right. And that's the total supply.
00:14:29.896 - 00:14:32.308, Speaker B: I think they're not ten k. I.
00:14:32.316 - 00:14:33.316, Speaker D: Think pudgies are eight.
00:14:33.340 - 00:14:33.500, Speaker B: Eight?
00:14:33.532 - 00:14:34.012, Speaker D: Eight.
00:14:34.148 - 00:14:34.516, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:34.580 - 00:14:34.900, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:34.932 - 00:14:40.620, Speaker D: If I remember correctly, yeah, they're under ten k. So there's a little bit there.
00:14:40.772 - 00:15:02.676, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought they were 55, but that's besides the point. Like, they. They have done a very good job of maintaining attention. Now little pudgy's having, like, 20,000. That's a whole nother ballgame. But, like, I think this, the permeation of token plus the fact that they were at, like, 0.4 ETH for months and months, and then Luca came in and they've done such a good job.
00:15:02.676 - 00:15:09.676, Speaker B: And going to tanks point, I talking about, like, the little gifts that they produce and things like that. I think they've done, like, a billion impressions or something like that.
00:15:09.780 - 00:15:14.156, Speaker A: Or a billion across, like, giphy TikTok. Yeah, mass.
00:15:14.220 - 00:15:32.088, Speaker B: That's. That's huge. And that's something that, like, nobody has really taken a stab at that. And, like, we've, we've talked about this before, how there's, like, this IP. Like, people talk about NfT ip all the time, and I'm like, dude, who gives a fucking, like, no, nobody wants to rock that anyways. You know what I'm saying? Like, that. It doesn't make sense to me, but with pudgies, it does.
00:15:32.088 - 00:15:44.984, Speaker B: And they're kind of an outlier in that because, like, if they get into mainstream culture, they are going to be, like, something that people look at and they're going to be like, damn, you have, like, an actual pudgy penguin. You get me?
00:15:45.144 - 00:16:08.992, Speaker A: Totally. Well, so speaking of that, I feel like every major collection kind of had its moment this year. Like, at the beginning of the year, there was. You go with Dookie Dash. Can you guys believe that that was earlier this year? It feels like decade ago, but, like, no, that was just a couple of months ago when we zoom out, um, obviously Uzuki with elementals. D God season three plus, I guess. D God season three, part two.
00:16:08.992 - 00:16:31.372, Speaker A: Whatever we want to call their clarify. Um, period. Like we said, pudgy with Walmart. Is there anything that any one of the major collections did that really stood out to you guys or that you were kind of like, oh, that's interesting. This is something that people are either, you know, mid curving or. And should be paying attention to.
00:16:31.548 - 00:16:52.474, Speaker B: I'll throw one more in there. Uh, on chain monkeys doing the bridge to ordinals, I think, was pretty, pretty badass. Like, I I mid curve the fuck out of. Out of BRC twenties, ordinals, everything like that. I was tweeting about BRC twenties and they ripped, um, and anshe monkeys was one of those people that said, like, no, we're going to. We're going to push this. So, like, good on them.
00:16:52.474 - 00:17:01.690, Speaker B: Like, they've. They've definitely proved to their community that they know what they're doing. Um, yeah, I think that would probably be my. The big one for me.
00:17:01.762 - 00:17:30.464, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think one that also came to mind, like, this year was the. My ladies. Like, um, honestly, it's been one community I've never really understood, but they had a lot of, like, they had a lot of stuff just going on. Like, um, I think, like, one of the founders was, like, suing the other co founders, you know, about, like, misappropriating some of the funds. And then later it turned out like, this was just a marketing campaign, and they actually were just doing it to generate attention. So it's very weird.
00:17:30.464 - 00:17:42.408, Speaker C: It's a little bit. I don't understand it, but a lot of people I know are, like, really into it. Like, they love their melodies, and some of them are not even nft people. They're like, defi folks, but they just love their my lady PFD.
00:17:42.456 - 00:17:46.970, Speaker A: So is it the culture? Because I don't get what's going on over there either.
00:17:47.122 - 00:17:50.682, Speaker B: I don't get it either, but I love it, dude. I'm so here for it.
00:17:50.698 - 00:17:51.874, Speaker C: Like, I'll talk to defi people.
00:17:51.914 - 00:18:07.194, Speaker B: I'm like, they'll rock a milady Pfp. And I'm just like, bro, you don't even like pfps. You don't like nfts? He's like, yeah, this is stupid, but fucking miladis are badass. I'm like, wow, okay, I want one because everybody else has one, so fuck it.
00:18:07.314 - 00:18:30.988, Speaker D: Okay, I'll jump in. I feel like initially, anyway, it was like the counterculture PFP. Like this is the anti NFT, NFt club situation. And eventually it becomes a bit normalized where the average defi person might be more drawn to that. Whatever. They're very financialized. Like, they made a pretty good bd effort to become the first NFT that, you know, maybe not the first, but an early community in a lot of the amms.
00:18:30.988 - 00:18:49.704, Speaker D: Like for NFT perps, like you could trade maladies pretty effectively. They just made inroads into all these sort of initially more niche communities. And it's done. They've done super well. But it's also like, yeah, the chaos is. It's divisive and that's, I think, a good thing because it gets people to care or not care in a really intense way. And that's how you build a brand.
00:18:49.704 - 00:18:59.520, Speaker D: Right. So they've, they've done pretty well. I feel like I was going to say two, two other different examples. The pandas, campai pandas, ice bags has done super well with that over there.
00:18:59.672 - 00:19:01.312, Speaker B: That's another one I don't understand.
00:19:01.488 - 00:19:03.192, Speaker D: Yeah, this is worth looking at.
00:19:03.288 - 00:19:03.536, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:03.560 - 00:19:04.536, Speaker B: I don't get it.
00:19:04.680 - 00:19:05.880, Speaker D: Okay, what's the alpha?
00:19:05.912 - 00:19:06.416, Speaker A: Then?
00:19:06.560 - 00:19:38.884, Speaker D: I had a chance to interview ice bags with fungible on our kind of weekly Twitter spaces series. And it's just interesting. Like he essentially acquired this project, these funny little pandas, and he's building a media company around like fighting and sort of all degeneracy related things is going to be like a gambling piece. They have an overdogs podcast, which is like super high quality media. They're just really taking the one business model that makes sense around pfbs, which is like, we're a media company and running it professionally, right? Like they actually can execute. They have past business experience. Whatever.
00:19:38.884 - 00:20:02.414, Speaker D: Pudgies obviously are doing their own thing. So I guess there are more than one way of playing an NFT project. But it's always made the most sense to me to explore, like, what could you do with NFTs as a layer in a media company? And so I think pandas will be, I mean, we're already ones to watch. They're up quite big. But I think over the next year, I mean, we'll save some time for predictions later, but I think they will do well.
00:20:03.434 - 00:20:07.834, Speaker A: Oh boy. All right, more research after the podcast that's going to be coming.
00:20:08.454 - 00:20:16.590, Speaker B: I literally just saw a tweet that was like, what the fuck is a compai panda? And I was like, dude, they're at. They're on sold too.
00:20:16.622 - 00:20:37.254, Speaker D: No, they're on all these chains. I think. Yeah, he minted it. They minted it across chains. It was interesting. I mean, part of why these projects do well is people just like see them on the timeline or see them in the charts and ignore them for a long period of time until price goes up significantly. Yeah, I mean, same thing with even like opepins is another one that comes to mind.
00:20:37.254 - 00:20:52.574, Speaker D: So many people were like, what the hell is an opein? This doesn't make any sense. Like, Jack just changed the metadata. I don't understand. And yet actually, like, that turned into one of my favorite projects this year. Effectively you're building like a public art museum. And I don't know that that was very cool and still is very cool.
00:20:52.734 - 00:21:12.206, Speaker B: Definitely agree with opebins. That's one that we left out. Like, opeins. Amanda, aka Stevie and I covered opebins quite a bit in the early going. And like, when they started changing metadatas, that was, that was the meta at that point. Like people started copying things and like bats do is one of the artists that kind of put stuff out. And then there was another one.
00:21:12.206 - 00:21:21.766, Speaker B: Was it VVD? Vincent Van Doe put one out. Um, and then Jack was just changing the metadata like every couple days. And then every time he changed it, the fucking price went.
00:21:21.830 - 00:21:22.574, Speaker A: It's like.
00:21:22.734 - 00:22:00.952, Speaker B: And then it would go down. And then he changed metadata and people were like super excited. And then all of a sudden they put the white paper out and it was like, yeah, we're going to kind of be like a time series or a time lapse of NFT culture. And we're going to use these geometric shapes to kind of represent the collection. So, like, you'll know that they're opebins, but we'll be able to timestamp the culture between like over the time of everything going on. And I think yesterday they did drop 27 out of like 180 or 250. It was like the fourth highest floor price out of all of them.
00:22:00.952 - 00:22:25.348, Speaker B: So they are still maintaining, I think, something interesting that's going to happen with them. I think there's 180 or 200 drops. I don't quite remember. But as they get to the end, because there's a mechanic where you have to have over 20 x the amount. So there's 80 per drop. So you have to have 20 x the amount of demand to say that the art is good enough that people actually want to. To rock that.
00:22:25.348 - 00:22:50.260, Speaker B: And that's like the approval mechanism. And then once they get approved, then whatever happens, happens. But I think as they get to, like, number 100 and things like that. The mechanics is going to start to change because people are going to, going to want the last opein edition, right? Like, people wanted the first of Pepin edition. People are going to want, like, the last couple. So we'll see kind of what happens. But Jack Jeff definitely did knocked that one out of the park.
00:22:50.452 - 00:23:28.292, Speaker A: Kind of changed. I feel like the art scene for NFTs, I haven't really been big into art. I started looking at Chromie Squiggles as trying to understand why are people taking out so many loan against chromie squiggles? What is it? And then it was like, okay, provenance. You can't really talk about generative art with NFTs without referencing chromie squiggles. I was like, okay, I can see the value that's going to come to that over time. But I feel like Jack made it, like, degenerate. Like, he just tapped, like, every single ape that I knew was, like, fucking around with opebins.
00:23:28.292 - 00:23:38.900, Speaker A: And, like, I was kind of just was very overwhelmed and didn't understand. And I was like, oh, that's cool. And then, you know, checks came out later and it was like, what the fuck? Like, it's just taking over the timeline.
00:23:38.972 - 00:24:04.644, Speaker B: Check checks blew up opinions. Like, that whole ecosystem is cool. Something interesting that I think will happen is visualize value has, I think, 27, 28 collections over the span of time. Like, I minted a Jack Butcher in 2021. And, like, they aren't all on one platform yet, and they're all sporadic. They're on, like, mirror editions on OpenSea. And, like, there's no even, like, search function.
00:24:04.644 - 00:24:41.454, Speaker B: Like, you literally have to type in the exact, like, collection name to even let it pop up. So it'll be interesting to see if they can kind of wrap some of these things and put them into, like, a singular platform so that Jack Butcher, Max, you just can kind of see what's going on. But we'll see, um, pivoting a little bit. Tang, you brought up Solana earlier. Um, well, we both did. And I think that we're safe to say that we're the probably two of the biggest Solana maxis on this show right now. Um, Solana NFT volume is starting to, to take on ETH NFT volume if especially with kind of blur and all of that kind of stuff.
00:24:41.454 - 00:25:10.532, Speaker B: Like, there is incentivized volume, but if incentivized volume did not exist, Solana would definitely flip ETH NFT volume at this point. How do you feel about this and as for blue chips, I've seen this a couple of times where people have said, like, mad lads are going to flip apes and we're going to start to see some, like, ETH 2021 NFT price action over on Solana. How do you feel about that? Where are the standouts here? And kind of how are you playing this game at this point?
00:25:10.668 - 00:26:04.332, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Solana is really interesting. If you look at what's happening today, I think in terms of transaction volumes, Eve probably takes up like 66%. Solana takes up maybe ten to 12% of NFT transaction volumes throughout most of the year until the last couple of weeks. And if you look at the market cap of nfts on ETH versus nfts on Solana, Solana is probably just about five 5% of that on ETH. So today the situation is that most of the high value nfts, the crypto punk fidanzas, are all still on ETH. But I think what's going to happen in the next year or so is that we're going to start to see this gap narrow a lot. And the reason is because I think it's starting to make less and less sense for people to launch new collections on eco.
00:26:04.332 - 00:26:43.174, Speaker C: So gas prices are high. It's going to be really expensive to mint, especially if we think that ETH prices are going to go up. And then on Solana, basically, you can mint nfts very cheap. They even have these compressed nfts where you can mint a million of these nfts at just. I think you can mint a million of these nfts for just 100 or $200 or so, which is pretty amazing. And that unlocks a lot of very new use cases. So my take on Solana nfts overall is that one is that most of the Solana NFT projects, to be honest, they aren't particularly innovative.
00:26:43.174 - 00:27:28.878, Speaker C: Most of them are like PFP communities and basically more of just vibes and having fun. A few have started to rise, like the Matlabs tensorians. And I think these two are interesting because they are tied to something beyond just a PFE community like the Matlabs. The founders are building a decent. They're building an exchange that they hope to be like the next version of FBX with verifiable proof of reserve. So I think that's what's driving a lot of interest, that people think that maybe you'll get a token airdrop or they get some incentive to be part of this platform as well. Same thing for tensorians that people are thinking that these would also get them an airdrop through tensor, which is essentially the birth of Solana.
00:27:28.878 - 00:27:55.724, Speaker C: So I think to me, there are going to be a few of these standout projects that will continue to do well. Majority may probably still stay as very niche communities. But what I'm really looking out for are the new projects they'll be launching in Solana in the next couple of months. Because there's been a lot of interest in these last couple of weeks. I think a lot of people are building and developing on Solana now, and we start to see the fruits of your efforts in next couple of months. So I think that's something I'll definitely be paying attention to.
00:27:56.184 - 00:29:01.080, Speaker B: Yeah, you touched on something there that I kind of want to double click on, and that's in gas fees. Like, I speak to a lot of ETH NFT fi teams, and, like, we're going to sit here and we're going to chat on real world assets and stuff like that, right? I, the more I do research and I am putting out a paper, a report on this right now where I was just kind of looking at, like, how is the NFT fi explosion going to happen? What is the future of ETH nfts? And how is ETH NFTFi going to kind of combat some of these big time problems? And then you go to talk to real world asset teams that are building, and they have to, like, mint nfts on this stuff. And, like, unless you're talking about a $50,000 watch, and then, like, the minting price is like, $160, then that's fine. But, like, I was talking to a team today that somebody minted 25, $25 pair of glasses for $160. Like, that doesn't make sense anymore. And so that, I think, is the major bull case here for Solana is like, compression nfts drip house. Drip house has done I don't even know how many nfts at this point.
00:29:01.080 - 00:29:32.868, Speaker B: Like, they've produced millions and millions and millions of nfts and just do free airdrops for people. And I'm like, that literally couldn't exist on ethanol. Like, it couldn't. And so I think as we start to get deeper into the space and see real world assets come on chain and see all of this kind of stuff, the sentiment that I get from people right now is that, oh, well, real world assets need to be on ETH. And I'm like, you're just a boomer. Like, you don't like that. That's the only reason, the only reason you say that is because that is what we have been told for years.
00:29:32.868 - 00:29:48.442, Speaker B: Right? And so I think as we start to see compression NFT or compressed nfts and things like that, come on, chain, it's going to produce a very interesting conversation for real world assets to start pivoting over to Solana. All I'm going to say, and I'm done.
00:29:48.618 - 00:30:36.488, Speaker A: Yeah, get off your Solana soapbox. Well, okay, you definitely have a point about gas fees. Like, we should not be having to pay hundreds of dollars just to, like, sign a transaction and to submit it. And, dude, gas fees hurt even worse when your transaction fails and you still, like, have to eat the gas. Crazy. Where I think Solana ultimately actually kind of proves itself as the superior chain, it's, like, not only, like, their local fee market, but I think it's the fact that, at least from the research I've done, it's the only blockchain right now that can actually handle a significant amount of transactions per second. Like, I was reading on their visa partnership, and, like, even visa commented being like, you know, we.
00:30:36.488 - 00:30:57.364, Speaker A: I think they, visa needs to, at any given point in time, need to be able to transform, transact about 65,000 transactions per second. And they were like, Solana is the only chain that's, like, capable of doing this right now. And I think that's where it gets really bullish in terms of, like, technical capacity and capability.
00:30:57.704 - 00:31:00.152, Speaker B: I can't really speak to that, but go ahead.
00:31:00.328 - 00:31:42.114, Speaker D: Let me just chime in, because the Solana folks did a good job at art Basel, and I think it's just interesting to watch some of the culture around nfts shift there. I think we're going to see a lot more art activity in 2024 on Solana. And it's just one of these things where previously, or up until this point, it's just been pfps and, like, degen activity around that. There's all this compressed stuff, compressed nft stuff that you guys have talked about that I think is net new. And that's why it's interesting. And drawing people in, you know, metaplex is kind of the underlay for that and drip, making it accessible to most people effectively. But, yeah, I think there's a lot of artists and art activity as well, like exchange art.
00:31:42.114 - 00:32:10.948, Speaker D: I think there's just. There's going to be some. It's going to surprise some people who think that Ethereum has a monopoly on culture and crypto, where you're already starting to see that shift, like, something like mad labs is fun to watch, right? Because it's a rallying point for that community, and then it starts to transcend and go bigger than the Solana world. But yeah, I know a bunch of artists who are like, either in process or, you know, have something formally in the books who are like, doing stuff on Solana soon. So TBD, we'll see.
00:32:11.116 - 00:32:14.428, Speaker A: Oh, I think that was a little alpha drop there.
00:32:14.516 - 00:32:41.580, Speaker B: That was massive alpha drop. Like, my two questions were, one for tang about fire dancer, and what that. What fire dancer is going to do for, like, infrastructurally speaking about Solana. I can't speak to that very much. Like, I've done research, but I know that that is going to increase transactions exponentially. And then my other question for Ben is like, okay, you just dropped, like, some hot alpha, like, now you need to tell us where to look, because, like, you can't just, like, say that. And then he's like, exchange art.
00:32:41.580 - 00:32:44.828, Speaker B: Haha. Like, I want to hear a little bit more. So those are my two questions.
00:32:44.916 - 00:33:24.984, Speaker C: Okay. I'm probably not the best person to speak on fire dancer by a very high level. Fire dancer is going to be a new Solana client right now. I think Solana has just one main client right now and is built by the team that, by the jump team, and they are basically high frequency traders. They are very good at doing what they do, and they are actually building this to really increase the throughput of Solana as a blockchain. I think it's planned to be released sometime towards the middle part of next year. And if it does, I think it will increase the scalability of Solana as a chain very significantly.
00:33:24.984 - 00:34:28.806, Speaker C: I think that's very important, because as much as I'm super excited about Solana, I think I'm also very cognizant that today. I think Solana works very well just because I think crypto hasn't really achieved a lot of mainstream adoption. But because Solana is also a monolithic chain, basically every application of Solana will have to fight with other applications on Solana as well in terms of getting the transactions included into the blockchain as well. If we start to get a situation where we have a couple of games on Solana, they are seeing like millions of transactions on a very regular basis. I think we're going to see some congestion and problems that you start to emerge. And that's why I think there is that scalability aspect of Solana still needs to be tackled, because if we think some of these use cases for NFTs are going to really go huge and really going to go mainstream, then I think we are still not yet prepared for that kind of future. And I think today, some of the gaming teams I talk to, you know, while they're building Solana, they actually see Solana as maybe sort of like an initial ground for them to build their game on.
00:34:28.806 - 00:34:41.594, Speaker C: But at one point, when they start to achieve, like, very large scale, they are thinking about, like, starting their own blockchain and moving to their own sort of app specific kind of chain as well. So I think that's what I'm seeing interesting.
00:34:42.254 - 00:35:17.205, Speaker D: On more the culture side, I think artists kind of have two modes of, like, relationship with economic activity, if you will. On the one hand, you have artists that pioneer things, right? And it's like the artists who move into a new neighborhood and they revitalize it, and they bring attention and energy there. On the other hand, it's like, okay, when there's something popular, they adapt that into their work and kind of participate in bigger trends. And so you're kind of more pulling on the economic flows, if you will, than contributing to them. And I think initially, that's how a lot of stuff starts. Like, Solana has grown, right? Obviously, we're up whatever amount of x off the bottom. Like eight.
00:35:17.205 - 00:36:07.064, Speaker D: Eight x off the bottom. People have some money. There are going to be some folks, like Djen poet is an interesting example of an artist who's been there for the whole Solana time period, right? So there's going to be people like that who catch some upside and, you know, are representative of the culture there. But more than that, I think you, if you're an artist and you look at all this new money in Solana land, it's kind of like this chain is a little bit de risked. You see people who, you know, other artists doing activity there, like, why not? Why don't I roll out a collection? Or why don't I do something experimental at least, like, on the edge over on Solana? And that's how things start, right? And then it gets more validated and other people tell their friends, and then you start to see stuff really rolling out there. And ultimately, it lands back on Tang's point earlier, which is to say, solana is just easier to use on so many fronts. Like, I've had so many chats with artists where it's like, man, I don't want to mint something for $50.
00:36:07.064 - 00:36:35.178, Speaker D: That's not how I'm going to enter into this, let alone a collection. And all that's involved there. Some of the people who maybe understand provenance or have different ways of thinking about the value of, like, ethereum being where their art is, are going to continue to mint on ETH. Most people don't think about this in binary terms, right. It's like, hey, I'm going to also probably explore minting on Solana. And so I think, yeah, to wrap it up, it's. It's mostly like, you see a huge inflow of money and attention onto Solana.
00:36:35.178 - 00:36:54.664, Speaker D: The secondary effect is artists will start to pull. Pull on that and try and do things there, and experimental stuff will show up. People will buy that. Hopefully some things go well. Some artists have breakouts, you see some validation for the actual og Solana art people. And then it just becomes a secondary domain where artists do stuff on chain.
00:36:55.564 - 00:37:33.460, Speaker B: That right there, I think, is pure alpha, because if we talk about Ethereum art, the first time that we really saw art pop off on Ethereum was like, when the market was bored, right? And I think we're going to see something similar happen when people make a ton of money on Solana and, like, they don't know where to put their money. And, like, if you go to exchange art right now, I know that there are, there are ogs that have produced a bunch of pieces. Like, I own a rupture piece that I love. Rupture. Like, rupture has been putting out a bunch of art for. For years now on Solana. And I bought his second piece and I was like, dude, that's dope.
00:37:33.460 - 00:37:53.308, Speaker B: Like, I'm going to hold that because I think it's like a timestamp, right? We're talking about Jack Butcher and timestamps, like, very similar. But then you have Degen poet, you have some of these other soul scum is another one. Like, there's a huge kind of list of artists that we can talk about here. But Ben, I think you nailed that one on the head, brother.
00:37:53.476 - 00:38:21.388, Speaker C: Actually, I have a question for Ben. Like, since you were talking about artists, I know you're like super deep into the art world. Do you think the artist that are going Solana and releasing collections to Solana, are these like a new breed of artists that are just like, getting into the space, or do you see a lot of it, like, coming from, like, the OG artists were like, releasing collections on Eve and then moving, experimenting on these new chains? Just curious. Like, your take is.
00:38:21.436 - 00:38:50.612, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. Good question. I guess I want to say I'm not, like, the canonical opinion here. I feel like there's going to be a lot of different takes or maybe people will disagree with, with what I've said already, but I think it's a mix. I think you see some of the, like, old school Solana people finally seeing some validation. Like, there are teams, like exchange art that have been building for a couple years, and now all of a sudden that there's interest, you know, they're there to service that. There's definitely some people who will do art stuff on both Ethan Solana.
00:38:50.612 - 00:39:30.730, Speaker D: So folks who have built careers minting stuff on Ethereum and being able to sell into that collector base, I think we'll explore. I know of a few people, I think that number, that list will grow who will do things in 2024 on Solana. So, yeah, it's kind of a both thing where I think there are original Solana people who are doing stuff there. There's ETH people who are shifting over to some degree or doing both. And then there's net new people, too, who are able to come in and say, hey, you know, if you look at exchange art and go to that website and think about it, super rare in 2018 or 2019 or something, the flow is pretty slick. Like, it makes sense. You understand what, what a digital object is or an NFT or whatever you want to call it.
00:39:30.730 - 00:39:38.010, Speaker D: I can mint, I can do this stuff. It's going to be an onboarding point as well. So all three, I think, are valid here.
00:39:38.202 - 00:40:38.128, Speaker A: I just. I have a question that kind of came up as you were riffing off of that, Ben. Like, ultimately, for nfTs, I feel like, especially as we move more towards rwas and protocols and builders work to abstract the crypto part away from their platforms as much as possible, to the point where some folks don't even really realize they're interacting with crypto or trying to minimize that realization. When it comes to art, does it matter what chain this all gets minted on? Obviously, I know if it's like, ordinals, like, that's something completely different. But if we're thinking in, like, the next 1015 years, will people specifically try to seek out, like, oh, well, this was an OG piece on the Ethereum blockchain. This was an OG piece on the solana blockchain. Or will it all kind of just be like, this is really valuable art that's just increased in price? Does that make sense? Like, I'm trying to figure out.
00:40:38.316 - 00:41:11.256, Speaker B: Yeah, and to piggyback on that, as Ben answers this, like, this was kind of the thing with FX hash, right? I know there's a lot of like, big time Daos and VC's that were buying ETH art, but that did not touch FX hash art, right? And FX hash had like a huge retail thing. And everybody's like, tezos, we love the art. And now I would be interested to kind of see how that thesis has played out and if, like, kind of going along with that, right? Like, does provenance exist? Is it. Is it blockchain specific or, like, does it matter?
00:41:11.400 - 00:41:41.620, Speaker D: Yeah, all really good questions. I think Ethereum has a premium when it comes to provenance. It's kind of this perfect middle ground of bitcoins, like security and the expressiveness of a smart contract platform. So when you think about some of the old school art blocks collections or, I don't know, just early generative work, early super rare work, there's a reason why a marginal art buyer would, like, value that very highly. Five years from now, right? Like, you know, Ethereum is going to be around. You know, it has the history. Like, there's a lot of validity to that.
00:41:41.620 - 00:42:09.884, Speaker D: And a lot of the skepticism around Tezos was pretty valid, or remains pretty valid in my mind. I think there's a lot of. There was a lot of artist interest for a season. I'm less plugged in there now. There probably still is, frankly, in part because of it being cheap and at the time, you know, the narrative around Ethereum having proof of work and Tezos being proof of stake and so being environmentally clean, NFTs pushed that a little bit. My sense is, I guess, like, TLDR provenance matters. I don't think it's chain specific.
00:42:09.884 - 00:42:55.698, Speaker D: I think we'll actually see some interesting stuff on bitcoin for the same reason. Because, you know, like, there are just people who value culture on these different chains and people who have money because they've all done very well that will kind of patron artists in those ecosystems. And so that, I think, is essentially universal. But also, people push value to their work based on who they are, not just like the provenance of the chain that they're working on. You know what I mean? So if I'm an artist today and I start on Solana and I'm able to tell a really interesting story about myself and my art and build a community around that, people will want to participate in that. In the same way that other people looked at Tezos initially with skepticism and said, why not let's dig into some of this FX hash stuff or whatever. So, yeah, I think, like, it matters.
00:42:55.698 - 00:43:15.538, Speaker D: It matters, especially at the high, high, high level you know, stuff that's like five or six or seven figure art is going to have a better, like a better time on ether, bitcoin. But I don't know that anything is fully, like, let me rephrase. I think I am very open about seeing interesting art activity across the stack.
00:43:15.626 - 00:43:21.938, Speaker A: Makes sense. Gosh, I'm going to be entering into my art, my art NFT era in 2024. Just wait.
00:43:21.986 - 00:43:22.794, Speaker D: Let's go.
00:43:22.954 - 00:44:12.904, Speaker A: I'm ready for it. So pivoting a little bit. You know, I think something that's been really exciting, and then we've mentioned it a few times already, has been seeing rwas on chain, specifically things like, you know, trading cards via Pokemon cards that we're seeing from like, courtyard and I know, colonies tackling that. And there's also, like 4k, but we're also starting to see, like, luxury goods come on chain. And obviously there's, like, financial activity around that. It's still incredibly early, in my opinion, in this space. But how are you guys feeling about it so far? Like, have you had conversations with your friends outside of the space around rwas? Does it click for them? Or is it something that it's like maybe in about a year, once more traction picks up, it'll be something I pay more attention to.
00:44:12.904 - 00:44:18.294, Speaker A: Where, where are you guys in terms of what your thinking is?
00:44:19.794 - 00:45:37.692, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, at least in my own sort of, like, personal conversations, like with friends, I think there is a lot of, like, hesitation. Like, I know a couple of friends who are really into, like, watches and they wouldn't put it on chain. And the reason is because there is still that centralization risk. You have to send it to someone to vault it, tokenize it, and, and you have to trust that provider actually does what he does. So I think from a mainstream perspective, there is still a little bit of that mental barrier and mindset to overcome. But for me personally, I do think rwas, especially for collectibles, this is going to be one of these sectors within this whole possible realm of asset classes that's going to come on chain faster, maybe even faster than some of the more traditional financial instruments like debt equity and so on. And I think the reason is because that the financial system for collectibles, like rare sneakers, luxury watches and stuff today is very underdeveloped, right? If I want to, if, let's say I have a hundred thousand dollar, like, Pokemon card collection, I can go to a bank and say, hey, can you give me a loan for this collection? I have to go to maybe a pawn shop and he's going to cut me quite tight.
00:45:37.692 - 00:46:06.574, Speaker C: He's going to take like 20% fees and stuff for all of that. Right. So I think we're going to see one of that really driving the use of, like, collectibles, like, to come on chain. I also think there's also going to be. There is quite a bit of demand, like, for people who want to trade some of these collectibles, but don't actually want to own the physical version of this. And when you have it tokenized and have it come on chain, you can actually trade these things around without actually having to deal with, like, the physical.
00:46:06.654 - 00:46:09.302, Speaker A: Item itself, like storing it somewhere in your house.
00:46:09.398 - 00:46:28.726, Speaker C: Exactly right. Like, maybe. I think this Pokemon card is going to be very valuable in the future, but I don't want to keep it and have the risk of, like, maybe a spilling water on it and it just like, you know, disappearing. And I feel like there is going to be the appetite for these, like, sort of alternative assets to be traded. Yeah. So I'm pretty bullish on it, to be honest.
00:46:28.910 - 00:46:30.124, Speaker A: Let's fucking go.
00:46:30.254 - 00:47:13.232, Speaker B: I agree with that, dude. Like, and I think what you said there about that happening slowly at first and then all at once is spot on. Like, I. We had a conversation today with one of those companies that's in the RWA space and doing storage and insurance and stuff like that. And they were like, basically TLDR on that would be infrastructure isn't quite there yet. We need to onboard more people. How do we onboard more people and convince them that paying the $160 gas fee is worth it and that's it going to be like a main problem, right? Like, if somebody has a $300 charizard card that they think number go up in a year, like, they're not going to pay 160 on that, right? So I think that that is a headache.
00:47:13.232 - 00:47:47.676, Speaker B: And then on top of that, like, being able to trade that thing, it becomes interesting. But how do they get instant liquidity for that? And I think that that will be another one because like, basically how it works right now is like, somebody sends this in, they appraise it, and like, there's an appraisal value there. And then they take the NFT and they're like, okay, with the appraisal value, I'm going to now put that on a peer to peer lending marketplace, right? I'm going to go to nifty fi. I'm going to go to arcade. I'm going to go to kettle. I'm going to go to one of these places and then I'm going to have to approve the transaction there. And then I'm going to have to go through that whole mumbo jumbo, and then somebody's going to offer me liquidity.
00:47:47.676 - 00:48:05.212, Speaker B: Right now that works for luxury goods, right? If we're talking 50 grand, 100 grand, 300 grand, whatever, the supreme thing that went down with 4k, like, those are big time deals, right? So then it doesn't necessarily matter or if we're talking about wine or whatever, whatever's going to come on chain.
00:48:05.268 - 00:48:16.334, Speaker A: But Dalton, I feel like for the trading cards, it's different. Cause we're already seeing those, like, models emerge, right? Like, I think this is why, like, courtyard and colony are building on polygons. Granted.
00:48:16.334 - 00:48:16.872, Speaker B: That's right.
00:48:16.968 - 00:48:53.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Granted, like, polygon itself as a chain, and interacting on the chain can be kind of confusing. Like, you connect your wallet and you're all of a sudden connected to their Zk roll up instead of, like, polygon, main net, and, like, little things like that. But, like, from what I've seen, like, courtyard's going to be, or courtyard, it's like mail for free, vault for free. At brinks, they have, like, a legacy name. Um, the colony team, I think, is working on something really interesting in terms of, like, instant liquidity, though, when it comes to trading this stuff. And I think we'll start to see that emerge in, like, quarter one of next year.
00:48:53.952 - 00:49:15.450, Speaker B: That'll be cool to see NFT. And this is something that I think we need to see that we. 2023 2020. That's this year, 2023, 2023. We saw an explosion of Nft lending, right? Like, peer to peer, peer to pool. Like, all these different models that came out and, like, all that was cool. All of that happened on ETH Mainet, like Solana, NfT lending cool is doing its thing.
00:49:15.450 - 00:49:41.852, Speaker B: And, like, that's mainly peer to peer with, like, predetermined terms by the marketplace. Sharkify. Like, that's all that is really happening there at this point. Citrus has a little bit that's peer to peer as well. Um, but it'll be interesting if RWAs are the catalyst for some of these, like, og NFT lending platforms to say, okay, now we're going to offer support for polygons because, like, yeah, we need, you know, and, like, we haven't had that push yet.
00:49:42.028 - 00:50:27.482, Speaker A: But also, I think you have to, like, I don't really see anyone taking a loan out on, like, a card that's worth $500. I think they're going to be bundles of cards. Have to at least be like 10,000, $15,000 because it's like, what the fuck are you doing taking loan, a $200 loan against like a card that's maybe only worth like five or 600. It's kind of wild to me. But speaking of NFT lending and NFT fi wanted to take a little bit of time to just look at what's happening in this space because it's been a crazy year. So this is the map of all the builders. And I think this is all ETH that was just recently put together.
00:50:27.482 - 00:50:55.688, Speaker A: Like, the amount of borrowing and lending protocols that have come on chain is insane. I think lending volumes right now. Let's see here. I think we're sitting at like 3.8 billion in cumulative, like, borrow volume since NFT five launched. And I think that was 2021 with Nifty Fi. You know, it's interesting because you're going to notice something about this chart.
00:50:55.688 - 00:51:46.160, Speaker A: It's like, okay, a few colors here, a few colors here, and then all of a sudden this bright green comes out and just starts dominating it. And surprise, surprise, it is blend. We need to talk a little bit about blend entering into the NFT five scene one. So cool to see so much borrow volume done on peer to peer loans. But I think there were a lot of consequences and fallouts that fell onto some of these NFT collections. Like the Zuki death spiral from blend is very notable and burned into my brain because that was like kind of traumatizing to experience as a garden member. But Tang, Ben, what stood out to you guys in those moments? Did you kind of like, see this crash was going to come from the time, like, blend launched? Because it was, they didn't really launch with a whole lot.
00:51:46.160 - 00:51:51.204, Speaker A: They were just like, and lending is now enabled and you guys get points for it, like go crazy.
00:51:51.864 - 00:52:41.536, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, honestly, I think when it first launched, I was very excited about it. But then, I mean, we think about what people are using these loans for. And the good thing about blend is that because of the incentives, you can actually take out a loan at a very high loan value and at very low interest rates. And what that does is that it really encourages people to leverage up and you start to buy more with your nfts and then you take out a loan and you buy even more nfts and stuff. And that's what leads to volatility prices, right? So we've seen some of these NFT projects, like people will take out a lot of loans and then prices can go up a lot and then basically when prices drop, people quickly sell. They might lose some money, and then it goes down a little bit as well. So I think it's created some of this volatility, but I think overall it's a good thing.
00:52:41.536 - 00:53:12.284, Speaker C: I think it unlocks greater capital efficiency. Like, people can finally take value from the nfts and maybe use that capital to do something else. So I think it's interesting. I mean, I do have some reservations about the interest rate mechanism on Belan because for a retail user, and I'm saying this because I've been bitten by it myself, is that because the interest rates, if you don't monitor it, it can actually go up very high because auto refinance. Correct. The auto refinancing thing. Yeah.
00:53:12.284 - 00:53:25.784, Speaker C: You might end up with a very high interest rate that if you could, if you just refinance it a little bit, it will drop a lot. So I feel like it's probably not the most retail friendly mechanism, but I think they're all just experimenting in the space. That's my take.
00:53:26.444 - 00:53:31.064, Speaker A: Ben, what's your blend blur take?
00:53:32.324 - 00:53:56.434, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's a big, big conversation, right. I think lending is, like, one of the few verticals that has some product market fit in NFT finance. Um, there's a lot of interest. I mean, the peer to peer, some of the peer to peer teams have been around for a long time. I think blend fits vaguely in the sort of more peer to pool category where you're just able to get liquidity faster. And so it ends up being a tool for leverage. Right.
00:53:56.434 - 00:54:23.416, Speaker D: As a lot of those initial collections came out. Speaking of the milady kind of financialization of milady's thing, like, they were early in that process. D gods. It was the same chart pattern, actually. I think, Dalton, we talked about this earlier in the year. Um, and seeing, you know, people lever up to try and get some points and then get washed out, it's effectively the same pattern every time. So, yeah, I mean, it's, like, very bullish that people are thoughtfully trying to create different ways to facilitate lending.
00:54:23.416 - 00:54:44.854, Speaker D: I think in Blur's case, it's probably also trying to explore what, you know, a perps product could look like on top of something like that. But, yeah, I mean, blur itself and, like, the entirety of that organization and what it's trying to do is probably a longer rabbit betrayal. So I'll. I'll stop there, but I think, yeah. Cautiously optimistic on good teams building good tech in a proven vertical.
00:54:45.014 - 00:55:04.074, Speaker A: So this is, like, pretty related to this. And this was actually a question that came in from dude lips. Do you guys foresee a super NFT finance app emerging? Is it blend, slash, blur, slash, blast, slash, whatever next bl name that Pac man comes up with?
00:55:04.254 - 00:55:05.054, Speaker B: Blam.
00:55:08.474 - 00:55:10.194, Speaker D: Oh, man. Tang, you want to go first?
00:55:10.274 - 00:56:08.644, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, I guess that some thoughts about this, like, I feel like it's very in trend right now to want to build a super app. Everybody wants to get that. It feels like, you know, that's something that can get a very high valuation. You get a lot of people on board, but I feel like the way you get to becoming a super app is, is you have to start from a niche and you have to own that niche and you have to have a lot of users. And I think the products and apps and platforms and teams that can potentially become like a super app are those that are able to already have a large number of users on board. And what they do is that with this large number of users using their very specific product, they start to expand to other verticals and other niches and eventually they become some kind super of app that basically dominates all the different verticals because there's a lot of synergies between the users on one vertical versus another as well. I think blur seems to be wanting to do that.
00:56:08.644 - 00:56:53.652, Speaker C: They do seem like they have both the ambition and, I guess early product market fit in order to sort of get to that. So I think among the teams in the NFT space right now, potentially they could get there. I also do think that we are in such early days in the NFT space. If you look at the number of users, number of people who are actually buying and trading nfts, or even the number of people who are, say, using NFT finance products, I think I last checked is probably maybe ten to 12,000 users so far in total. It's still very small and what it means is that it's still very wide open for someone to come in and be able to capture all users and mind share in the future. So pretty much keeping an open mind on this.
00:56:53.828 - 00:57:24.156, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I'll jump in and say blur is going to become a super app, but I don't know if it's going to become the super app. Like, if you just look at how most of crypto works, there are multiple places where people trade perps. Like, there's multiple places where you can get loans. It's not super monolithic. Of course. If you are the blur team, that's the outcome that you want to engineer for yourself because you want to, you know, be able to capitalize on all the trading fees and all the perps and all the lending all under one umbrella. And I don't know, maybe to zoom out even further.
00:57:24.156 - 00:58:00.884, Speaker D: I remember reading a thing, I think it was Dan Ellitzer wrote in Defi summer. So this is like 2020. And his comment was, if I'm remembering correctly, it was like Uniswap, which is a decentralized exchange, and compound, which is a money market, would end up competing with each other to become prime brokerages or basically super apps for like, finance teams, right, where you could go to one brand and get all sorts of services. And so it's just interesting to see that that didn't happen. Like, those teams sort of stayed in their lanes. But here we are with blur actually maybe being the first ever, like, attempt at becoming a super app with multiple services, something that's at least not like a formal, centralized exchange. Right.
00:58:00.884 - 00:58:27.784, Speaker D: Something like Coinbase is a super app already, right. But if you think about blur as, okay, well, it's an exchange. And, you know, with blur blend, they have lending and with blast, they're going to have a full, like, environment where they can facilitate all of these different things. That's definitely, it seems like anyway, from, from an outsider perspective, the player they're gunning for, I'm just not convinced that that is somehow, like, going to clear the field. Like, you can still make an incredibly interesting perps experience independent of that. And people will show up. Right.
00:58:27.784 - 00:58:30.764, Speaker D: It's just, you know, there are different ways to play the game.
00:58:31.184 - 00:59:01.156, Speaker B: Totally am interested in this. We're talking about blur, then we're talking about blast and kind of everything they've created to this point. I'm gonna jump ahead a little bit. But as for blast, creating an l two and seeing kind of this mercenary tactic that they've taken on the market. Right? Like, literally, it's like the Spider man meme where everybody's just like, you know what? Like, everybody's like super tense and like, no, I'm gonna. I'm gonna take your liquidity PvP. We're seeing it all over the place, right? And it worked for blur.
00:59:01.156 - 00:59:30.456, Speaker B: Like, they, they came in, they said, like, dude, we're going to take all the liquidity, and if you use Opensea, you're not going to get rewarded. And this is that. And now Opensea is. Opensea still does volume. Not the volume that blur does, but also incentivize volume is a thing. Right? But do you think that this is going to happen when they do create blast? So four, one, one on this blast at this point is a multi sig, right? A multi sig with $800 million in it. And they don't even have an l two yet, but they're building the l two.
00:59:30.456 - 01:00:11.514, Speaker B: And l two will eventually get here. And we're trusting the fact that blur has built multiple things. Like, they. We trust them to a point, right? Do you think that this absolutely destroys the ETH l two ecosystem? If blast comes in and says, you know what, like, if you bridge to arbitrum, if you bridge to optimism, if you bridge to any of these other chains, you're not going to get any of these blast tokens. And what does that mean for the ETH ecosystem? Because, like, my personal take on this is that it's going backwards, right? Like, we're making the ecosystem more immature because we can't progress, right? Like, we're not. They don't have this open source mindset. They're like, no, fuck you guys, we're gonna win.
01:00:11.514 - 01:00:19.950, Speaker B: We're gonna be the super app, and we're gonna kind of take, take charge in this. Don't go to our arbitrary optimism. And that's that. So how do you guys kind of feel about that?
01:00:20.082 - 01:01:01.314, Speaker C: Um, yeah, it's very big conversation that I think is happening right now. And. And it's probably one of the things that makes me feel that there is still a lot to be figured out within the eve ecosystem because, like, you know, exactly what you said. Like, um, over the last, like, six months, we've seen so many of these, like, new l tools and roll ups, like, come to market and, you know, next year is going to be a lot more. Partly is because of valuations and people can see that, hey, if I spin up at l two, I can immediately get, like, ten figures of evaluation pretty easily versus building a consumer app. And that's why these things are coming market. But what it also means is that I think it does two things.
01:01:01.314 - 01:01:33.368, Speaker C: One is that it means that there's a very heavy competition among l two s. Everyone's going to fight for the same user today. They're going to do it through incentives, grants and whatever. And the one that can execute best on this and bring the best talented, most talented developers are going to win on this. But I think one thing that worries me also is that it does fragment the liquidity a lot. So basically, you have people who have to split their funds among all these different chains. And it's not as easy right now to bridge funds.
01:01:33.368 - 01:02:07.664, Speaker C: It does take effort, does take cash as well to do all of that. And that makes it a very complex path for both developers in terms of thinking, if I want to build a product, which l two should I build on? Which one is most interesting for me? And also as a user, where should I be putting my capital in? So I feel like these are some complexities that we haven't yet sort of figured out. And maybe that's also a reason why Solana is interesting, because it's a lot simpler. There's just one ecosystem, and you don't have to think about which l two is going to be the one that wins.
01:02:08.044 - 01:02:09.660, Speaker B: 100% agree with that.
01:02:09.772 - 01:02:59.052, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a good take, man. I don't know that I have too, too much to add. I think when I think about blast, I think about it like, mercenary is a word that a lot of people have used, but it's also just sort of peeling back the curtains and saying, this is how crypto incentives can work. We're going to push this out to the nth degree and see if we can win. Right? It's just like full on the violence of startups where you're just sort of calling people's assumptions and saying, well, what if we did this? Like, if you were going to start an l two and try and compete with everybody, that's the way that you would do that. And so it's just interesting to wrestle with, like, to what extent does this team have ambition? Like, what are they really trying to accomplish here? Because are they going to also fork Lido and just be like, cool, we're going to run there? Like, it's, it's interesting. But, you know, yeah.
01:02:59.052 - 01:03:44.244, Speaker D: The way I look at them is highly competent team. You know, clearly Ponzi engineers like, to the, to the nth degree, like, they're very effective at that. They have a core, like, flywheel in that people use blur, like the actual, the core product. So there's still a lot of interest. And they are, you know, the team to watch ultimately in the space, like everyone else is taking their cues off of them. But I do think at a point, people, like, there still are alternate approaches to building any of the products that they offer for NFT finance, but also l two s, right? You know, I have some friends who work at these different l two s. And of course they're thinking about this in terms of competition, but it's also like, dude, we've been thinking about this for five years, right? It's like, we're not scared.
01:03:44.244 - 01:03:56.326, Speaker D: Sorry. Like, we're ready to go to the map. And so I don't know. I think it's going to be interesting. I'm always pro competition, and I think it'll be a funny shitcoin season whenever that chain launches. So I'm looking forward to that, too.
01:03:56.510 - 01:04:47.390, Speaker A: Well, so speaking of competition, like, not only are we seeing this on the ecosystem side, but we're also seeing it in just like the lending side. Like, Dalton and I joke about this all the time. It's like, dude, what is going on with the NFT five lending wars? Like, it's gone. So PvP, like, if you're a peer to peer platform, we are seeing vampirism attacks on other peer to peer platforms where, you know, I used to work for a platform where we did a vampirism attack on the only other peer to pool platform that was available. And so it's one of those things that it's like, in retrospect for me, it's like, well, we did what we thought was necessary to try to, like, get more users, to get, you know, more unique wallet addresses. And we knew our app was stickier. So once we converted, it was just like one of the easiest lifts.
01:04:47.390 - 01:04:57.594, Speaker A: But ultimately, like, is this going to be, is this net negative on the space? Is the pie too small right. Is the pie too small right now to be fighting over?
01:04:57.894 - 01:05:00.734, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I formulating his thoughts.
01:05:00.774 - 01:05:01.182, Speaker B: It's hard.
01:05:01.238 - 01:05:27.134, Speaker D: It's hard. I'll riff. I'll riff a little bit. I mean, there's some of the original P two p marketplaces, some of the original peer to pool marketplaces. You have people who are building stuff that's kind of like in between. I mean, something like, if you have niftify, that is the first example of this peer to peer concept, and then you have bendao or something. As an early peer to pool concept, you have people iterating on those two underlying concepts.
01:05:27.134 - 01:06:11.152, Speaker D: So something like meta street comes along and it's just building a different version of peer to pool that people seem to like. And there's a lot of innovation around, even something like arcade or whatever. There are different people in the p two p space too. But really, when you zoom out, at the end of the day, there's only so many people who are going to take out loans against nfts, right? And so it does become a bit of a war, you know, everyone's points and tokens and essentially like, how do I ponzify this entire exercise so that I can win market share? And that works well when you're growing as like a segment. But it seems like either stagnant or slightly growing now. And so it ends up feeling very combative in my mind, where, yeah, a lot of these things are zero sum. And it's tough because, I mean, like, we know most of the time teams, right.
01:06:11.152 - 01:06:37.144, Speaker D: It's a small industry. I hung out with a lot of them in Miami at our basel. There's a lot of good people building interesting stuff. But, yeah, I feel like the way I try and think about it is more positive some, which is to say, like, this whole category should grow massively if what we believe is true. And so there's probably a lane for multiple players. And that's at least the hope, though, for sure. I mean, you just, if you're honest with yourself, like, these things are competing against each other without question.
01:06:37.444 - 01:07:04.988, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and it's even like, look at this. This is volume by platform type. It's like it was all peer to peer. And then, you know, what, what is this? Like, 2022? We see peer to pool start to come out and then, like, blend just comes and crushes all of the peer to pool protocols. Like, peer to pool doesn't even feel like it's on the map right now. Like, Ben, I think you did it. Good job.
01:07:04.988 - 01:07:23.180, Speaker A: You called out Bendao meta Street. I know there's cyan, but, like, which one of these models is going to win? I. I don't know, because I think they're all so different and have such different feature sets. But, Tang, we're going to put you back in the hot, hot seat.
01:07:23.332 - 01:08:07.806, Speaker C: Um, yeah, I think just, like, general thoughts on, like, here, the pool. Um, yeah, you're right. I think it looks like, um, most people are pursuing the sort of peer to peer model. And it makes sense today, because if you look at these peer to peer, peer to pool protocols, they actually have a lot more additional risk compared to the peer to peer protocols. You have things like, you have to make sure that you have to trust that the mechanism of the protocol is designed in a way that is robust. And during periods of volatility, or let's say we have a black swan event where NFT prices, like, drop 40, 50% in a day, you know, the protocol is not going to incur a lot of bad debt. And we've seen a lot of these cases happen with the typical stuff like DeFi protocols outside of nfTs.
01:08:07.830 - 01:08:07.942, Speaker D: Right.
01:08:07.958 - 01:09:04.494, Speaker C: So we know that these are situations that can happen. And I think on the peer to pool protocol, there is also a possibility for you as a user to kind of, like, be liquidated and people don't like that feeling. So I feel like there is a little bit of a UX issue with the peer to pool protocols where one is that you have to be a little bit more careful and you can never have that full safety or certainty as compared to the peer to peer lending protocols where, you know, you're only dealing with a single other party. I think the other thing is that because of these additional risks, like a lot of these peer to pull protocols have to have a lower LTV values in order to be a little bit more conservative. And you know, degens being degens, they want to really max out the value of that, the loan they can take off the NFT. And basically right now is the peer to peer protocols like blend, that actually offer you the highest LTV at the lowest interest rates.
01:09:04.954 - 01:09:50.599, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that 100%, dude. Like I think that peer to pool, the peer to pool mechanism is going to slowly disappear unless like meta street I think is really interesting. Like that's a really cool one to me. Uh, but outside of that, like I don't, I don't really see a future. Um, I do have one last question before we wrap up. Um, going back to this ETH l two kind of ecosystem landscape that we see at this point, I'm wondering if base is going to be a safe haven for the ETH L two ecosystem. I think that eventually blend blast blast goes and like guns up at everybody.
01:09:50.599 - 01:10:25.328, Speaker B: And I don't think that that's going to be a very fun experience for arbitrum and optimism and stuff like that. But I'm wondering if like the Gamefi social fi scene on base that we're starting to see explode is so retail oriented that like if we do see an onslaught of retail, are they going to just absolutely what the base is prime for that, right. Coinbase is the debt or the centralized exchange for normies. They've done a really good job positioning themselves. They have a lot of good publicity. They are very good at marketing. This recent marketing campaign was fucking epic.
01:10:25.328 - 01:10:33.604, Speaker B: I'm wondering if the Gamefi social fi ecosystem is going to kind of just trend towards base and if they're the safe haven.
01:10:33.934 - 01:11:30.800, Speaker C: Okay, I guess just some quick thoughts, like it's something that my colleagues and I actually have been discussing a fair bit like these last couple of weeks. And I think what the general consensus is that if you look at the different l one s and l two s that are out there at the end of the day, I think they are not going to be competing very much on the technology on which one can actually do better. A lot of the competition and the ones that are going to emerge as the winners are the ones with the best distribution. And I think base has that for it, right, because it has that very strong linkage with Coinbase. I think Coinbase is going to push a lot of its like hundreds of millions of users to be using like base as a platform for its product. So, you know, that already has something for it versus say, some of the other alternatives. I say aptos and sui that doesn't have that inherent ecosystem and they actually build and find users organically and from the grounds up, which makes it a much longer and more difficult path for them.
01:11:30.800 - 01:11:42.896, Speaker C: So I mean, overall I'm just, I guess that in short, I'm pretty bullish on like what's going to happen on base. And I personally want to keep a very close eye on products, projects, NFTs that actually launching on base.
01:11:43.040 - 01:11:44.644, Speaker B: Fred Pet, let's go, baby.
01:11:46.344 - 01:11:51.640, Speaker A: Yo, I'm going to take credit for turning you on to Fred Pet a hundred percent, 100%.
01:11:51.712 - 01:11:57.316, Speaker B: I will not claim blame that at all. But hey, I stuck around, I kept buying and now we're up only, bro.
01:11:57.500 - 01:11:58.356, Speaker A: Let's go.
01:11:58.460 - 01:11:58.940, Speaker B: I'm done.
01:11:59.012 - 01:12:32.554, Speaker D: I think the one thing I would just double, like underline from what tank said is the word distribution. I think that's kind of the big differentiator for base. They just, I mean, Coinbase has 100 million users. People talk about this all the time. Like if there's going to be an onboarding portal essentially to being on chain, there's automatically sort of a level of legitimacy with base that other l two s don't necessarily have because their brands are newer. Coinbase been around for a long time and so I think we'll probably see a lot of activity there. I don't know.
01:12:32.554 - 01:12:57.936, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll see in terms of NFT finance, what exactly plays out there because in so many ways it really just depends on where does the underlying culture activity happen because then that's going to be where NFT finance also happens. Right. You can't really just have like a lending market up there when there's no NFts that are that consequential yet. So we'll see. But I think it's. That's more of like a independent of NFT finance. Probably just a general take that.
01:12:57.936 - 01:13:03.312, Speaker D: I think base will do very well when Ethereum land continues to, you know, be in the spotlight.
01:13:03.408 - 01:13:29.060, Speaker A: So obviously we've thrown out a lot of thoughts, a lot of takes, a lot of alpha on, you know, specific lending platforms, specific marketplaces, collections, et cetera. Zooming out in general, 2024 and beyond, what do you guys see? Like, if you could have three top predictions that you want to see unfold over the next year and maybe a little bit beyond that, what would they be?
01:13:29.212 - 01:14:18.294, Speaker C: Um, yeah, maybe I can just throw out some quick thoughts. Um, I think one is that we could see some of these NFT character brands, like pudgies or doodles, really start to surprise everyone and either go viral or sort of break out. Because I do know a lot of people who basically think NFTs are just like jpegs. They just picture as zero value to any of these things. But I think they don't really see that there actually are teams behind this that actually are trying to build iP, they're actually trying to build business and they're kind of like writing them off a little bit early. And I feel like, you know, already we're seeing the early maybe glimpse of this. With pudgies starting to get a lot of attention, I feel like some of these brands are going to stop by breakout next year.
01:14:18.294 - 01:14:55.608, Speaker C: So maybe there's one. Yeah, I think Solana catching up to Yves in terms of NFT volumes and all that, or at least narrowing the gap a little bit. I can see. Dalton, you're really into this too. Yeah, I think that's definitely also going to be one thing and maybe one more I'll just show up, is that I think, um, I think a lot of people are going to be trying some of these like newer NFT token standards, like the ERC, six thousand five hundred fifty one s and stuff. Because, you know, the more I look into these things, I feel like it really gives NFts like superpowers, it gives them the ability to do new things. Like with 6551, like your NFT can actually have its own wallet.
01:14:55.608 - 01:15:09.244, Speaker C: And what that means, it can do anything on the blockchain that you can do yourself as well, which opens up a lot of very creative use cases. And I think NFTs existing as just like static pictures are probably going to be a thing of pass soon.
01:15:09.704 - 01:15:50.380, Speaker B: 6551 is one to watch. That's definitely interesting. I'll share my three one, I think NFT perps or the NFT perp volume flip spot volume. I think Solana flips ETH on all main metrics, maybe besides market cap, but I wouldn't even be surprised if it did just because from like usability, I, I think it's better. So I think that there's going to be like a hardcore Solana season. Um, last one between ordinals and ordinals and NFT AmM volume. I think NFT Amm volume continues to grow.
01:15:50.380 - 01:16:17.502, Speaker B: Um, as. As. I don't know if we're quite there yet, but 20% of NFT volume on Solana is NFT Amm on ETH. That's not happening. So I think that we might see 50 50 in 2024, and then the ordinals ecosystem, I think, is massively, massively, massively undervalued. Still to this point, I think that we're going to see some ridiculous fucking numbers. There you go.
01:16:17.518 - 01:16:19.206, Speaker D: Pump the bags. Pump the bags.
01:16:19.270 - 01:16:25.034, Speaker B: I don't own anything yet. I don't own anything yet, but I will be going in soon.
01:16:26.294 - 01:16:28.314, Speaker A: Ben, your three?
01:16:29.574 - 01:17:12.958, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's definitely a pro Solana point. More on the arts and culture side, I guess. And I've already explored that a bit, but I just think what happens in terms of art and culture on Solana in 2024 will surprise people. People have, up to this point, thought of Solana as, like, a particular kind of chain, but I think there will be more art activity there than. Than people expect. I think parallel will explode and be the first major game that actually gets, quote unquote, mainstream adoption, which is interesting because I just think, yeah, on multiple fronts, like, the trading card game is already aligned super well for an existing audience of trading card players. Trading card game players, but also this AI agent game that they're building called colony.
01:17:12.958 - 01:17:46.116, Speaker D: I think that idea, this idea of, you know, you have a passive person that you're playing a game with is sort of like the candy crush for millennials and zoomers. It's like this passive gaming state that I think they will pioneer an entire category around that stuff. It's one of the few teams that really just actually knows how to execute and can go fast. And so I think parallel will be a massive breakout ecosystem. I have no idea what happens to you, Price. I would assume NGU number go up goes along with that, but I just think it's cool. Like, it's fun that I actually have something to shill to my friends to be like, yo, play this.
01:17:46.116 - 01:18:16.854, Speaker D: And it actually holds up, right, versus some of the janky stuff that we've seen in crypto land. I guess the final third one is, I think we'll see a mobile app explode that also people weren't expecting something like a gallery for collecting and being able to talk about and add extra social context to entities. And that that whole set of things could happen. Floor is another example. Just something that is adjacent to crypto that is specifically mobile will explode. Um, and I feel like I'm waiting to see what that one is.
01:18:17.634 - 01:19:05.564, Speaker A: Let's go. Um, my three are a little bit different. I think we're going to see an explosion of supply for luxury goods and collectibles coming on chain as NFTs and then building on top of that. Like, not only do I think the NFT lending volume is going to go up significantly, but I think we're going to see a lot of really cool use cases, particularly around games built on top of the card collections that are coming on chain. Like, the fact that, you know, you now have all of thousands and thousands of Pokemon cards tokenized and vaulted. Like, I can see people just building actual D gen card games where you're betting actual cards that are, like, locked up. And I can see that getting a lot of, like, mainstream traction.
01:19:05.564 - 01:19:13.764, Speaker A: And then the third is, I think Taylor Swift will be entering web three in some capacity. Keep rolling your eyes.
01:19:14.424 - 01:19:18.744, Speaker B: I was like, dude, I literally was sitting here. I was like, she's gonna bring up Taylor Swift.
01:19:18.824 - 01:19:22.056, Speaker D: I know I'm in the Taylor chat. So I'm.
01:19:22.200 - 01:19:24.648, Speaker B: I knew it was, ah, God damn.
01:19:24.696 - 01:19:25.208, Speaker D: I was like.
01:19:25.256 - 01:19:27.554, Speaker B: I was, like, taking side bets with myself.
01:19:27.744 - 01:19:50.694, Speaker A: No, there. I think the music, like, music in web three is something that I just feel like I haven't seen talked about a lot, but I think there's going to be something that gets built on an infrastructure level, whether that's ticketing or a way to, like, connect with your top super fans that is going to come out. And I totally see, like, Taylor and her camp spearheading that.
01:19:50.814 - 01:19:55.314, Speaker B: Yeah, social. Some social fi. Something with, like, music.
01:19:55.614 - 01:19:56.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:19:56.374 - 01:20:15.178, Speaker B: Integrating. Integrating influencers, celebrities, like, friend tech was very interesting and we didn't get to touch on it, but, like, that was. That showed that there was product market fit for us. Like, dude, crypto Cobain, his fucking keys went to, like, ten e. Like, just to chat with them. Right. But, like, if I.
01:20:15.178 - 01:20:19.626, Speaker B: I see where. Where you're going with that pro Taylor Swift entering web three.
01:20:19.730 - 01:20:40.954, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. That's all I asked for. And Ben Tang, thank you guys for your time. I know we ran a little over and we had some technical difficulties getting started, but it really means a lot that you would take, like, basically 2 hours out of your day just to sit here and riff with us on crazy things.
01:20:41.254 - 01:20:53.568, Speaker B: Thank you. That was, that was super sick. Just getting to hear y'all's takes and did Ben with the art and culture stuff tanked. You just know the space so well. Like, this is. It was a pleasure, you know, I.
01:20:53.576 - 01:21:05.124, Speaker C: Mean, thanks for having me here. I mean, it was really fun. Like, you know, it's not often that you get to have these, like, very in depth, like, conversations about NFTs with people and really appreciate, like, this so much. So I had a great time.
01:21:06.064 - 01:21:10.164, Speaker D: Yeah, likewise, guys. Thanks so much. This has been so fun.
01:21:10.864 - 01:21:17.784, Speaker A: Let's go. All right, guys, you know the drill. We'll be back. Actually, are we filming next week, Dalton? I don't know.
01:21:17.864 - 01:21:19.022, Speaker B: Maybe irl.
01:21:19.168 - 01:21:27.946, Speaker A: We might be filming an IRL episode next week, so make sure to tune in and be sure to follow Tang and Ben, and we'll catch you guys later. Thanks.
01:21:28.130 - 01:21:28.634, Speaker B: See you guys.
