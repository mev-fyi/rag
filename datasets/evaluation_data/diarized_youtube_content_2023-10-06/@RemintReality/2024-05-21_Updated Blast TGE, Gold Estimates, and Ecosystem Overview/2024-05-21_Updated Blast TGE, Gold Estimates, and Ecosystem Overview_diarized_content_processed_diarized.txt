00:00:00.600 - 00:01:03.654, Speaker A: By the time blast has its tge, I think I will have zero of my 13 brain cells left. For those of you who don't know, Blast is the first native yield l two from the same builders that created blur the NFT marketplace. The thing that makes blast fairly revolutionary is the simple fact that you are earning native yield on your ETH and USDB that sits in your wallet from Lido, staked ETH and Makerdao, respectively. That and Blast arguably has the most attractive environment for builders looking to get exposure to a new user base through the Blast gold incentive programs. Blast has been on Mainnet since February 29 and was slated to have its token generation event, or TGE, later this month. However, Blast announced on May 15 that it would actually be delaying its TGE until June 26. Additionally, it announced that the allocation of redacted going to users would increase, and that we will see two more blast gold distributions from now until June 26.
00:01:03.654 - 00:02:22.260, Speaker A: Now, everyone has feelings about this, but let's take a closer look at what's actually happening in the ecosystem and what it means for those who are currently active on Blast, and for those who might be on the fence about jumping in now. Personally, for me, I'm bullish. I acknowledge the fact that, you know, I may have some bag bias as someone who has pretty much spent every waking moment since late February in the blast trenches, but at the end of the day, I just fundamentally think that blast will be a more efficient chain for most DeFi experiences, and that the native yield actually just opens up so many new revenue streams for builders and ultimately will usher in new metas. So zooming out. Yes, there will be dilution, as there is more gold that's being distributed than anyone in initially anticipated, but the actual allocation amount of the blast token going to users is being increased to make up for that. Pac man also announced that the delay for the blast TGE was basically caused by a need for more time on the engineering front. This, to me, signals that we should expect something either day one or shortly after TGE, potentially some sort of product or ecosystem announcement.
00:02:22.260 - 00:03:33.654, Speaker A: At least that's what I have up in my brain, whether that's staking or a new dapp that gives this token that's launching some sort of new utility, like, who knows? Could Pac man potentially be launching the institution grade perps platform he's been teasing about since November 2023? I don't know. It's all up for us to wildly speculate on, but for me, a few things became clear. One, you're really only going to feel the effects of dilution if you stopped being engaged with the ecosystem. Two, gold is going to feel like it's much easier to get versus how it's been historically because we know we have more gold coming in future rounds as well as the blast jackpots. I've also chatted with a few of the builders on Blast, and the Blast team is meeting with various teams on mainnet to basically discuss and provide feedback on their incentive systems. So I think we're going to also start to see basically more platforms really start to drill in on how exactly they're going to reward gold. And number three, while it may seem like blast is oversaturated on the timeline, again, to me on chain data continues to paint a different story.
00:03:33.654 - 00:04:18.823, Speaker A: And now with all of that said, here is part one of the study assignment for this video. I want you guys to give me your honest take on blast and or share how your experience on blast has been thus far. So, moving on, NFT stats prediction for blast gold has gone down from $10.68 per gold bar to $6. Obviously, as we're seeing this stuff come out on the timeline, people are not thrilled. But I think as we continue to speculate wildly for the next month, it's important for us to separate social signaling versus what's actually happening on chain and what the data says. And I figured no better person to break this down with and look at stats with than NFT stats himself.
00:04:18.823 - 00:04:25.923, Speaker A: Well, Sam, thank you for joining me on a Saturday. Appreciate you making the time away from the kiddos. How are you?
00:04:26.083 - 00:04:33.379, Speaker B: What is up, Jen? Always good to talk to you. You're killing it. So I'm honored to be on this in this moment.
00:04:33.571 - 00:04:49.143, Speaker A: Well, I'm excited to have you here. So obviously in the last couple of days, there was some pretty big news from blast, mainly this tge being delayed by a month. I wanted to get your read on it and get your take on it. How are you feeling overall?
00:04:49.323 - 00:05:15.888, Speaker B: I've been very vocal about my blast gold prices. Like that's kind of something I've sort of randomly stumbled into, like people looking at me for. So, you know, when they did this, I was like, damn, everything I said is wrong. That was my biggest issue. You know, I think my farming was a little bit more aggressive that in the beginning than it is now. And I think that, you know, I think that early people tend to get deluded a little bit, and this is not new for stuff that Pac man has done. I think there's a little bit, a little bit of this with blur as well.
00:05:15.888 - 00:05:34.384, Speaker B: One thing that was really surprising to me, though, is I did talk to him about this and he said, look, like, we know we have to put an end date. And so we started saying, like, day one, they're like, this will be over in May. So I know that this was something they took seriously and they really wanted to get it done. So I was a little bit surprised because I am sure this was not what they wanted.
00:05:34.504 - 00:06:05.170, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so it's interesting because you were talking about how you were quote unquote wrong, but I think had there not been a delay and had there not been another blast gold distribution, I think you were right on the money. Correct me if I'm wrong, the estimate basically is based off of, like, what the FDV is going to be at launch, how much allocation of whatever this redacted token is, is going to gold, and then how much gold there is in terms of total supply. Like, those are the three factors, right?
00:06:05.202 - 00:06:24.074, Speaker B: Yeah. And because they publish a doc every time they release gold, you know exactly how much is out there. So it's a little bit easier to do. And for people listening who don't know what FTV means, that is valuation. So it's basically, what's the valuation of the token when it launches, how much of that token is go to gold holders and how much gold is there, and from there you can back into, like, a price.
00:06:24.234 - 00:06:35.694, Speaker A: Yeah. So you came out with this new estimate from, I think, $10.68 down to six. Can you, like, quickly walk us through, like, the math to get here for the folks who aren't fully aware?
00:06:36.114 - 00:06:56.610, Speaker B: Sure. And it's confusing, you know, so. But I'll do my best. So the biggest thing is how much gold is out there. And this is the part that, you know, they said they're going to give more token to holders as a result. What do they mean by that? So there's 100% is the total token. And the way that they generally do this is that first bit that gets released when the token launches.
00:06:56.610 - 00:07:15.774, Speaker B: They just. With blur, they only gave 12% in that first month. Only 12% of the total token outstanding was given to blur farmers. That was my prediction for blast, that they'd get 12% of the total token not outstanding. The total token that existed, I thought they give 12% to blast farmers. I think now they're probably gonna get 15%. How do I know? I don't.
00:07:15.774 - 00:07:34.166, Speaker B: I have no idea. No one knows anything. But that is my guess. So they're giving more to people as a percentage of all that will be outstanding. So that's like the good thing that would make the gold price go higher. The problem is that they're creating a ton more gold. Why are they creating a ton more gold? Well, there's just much more gold inflation now than there was in the beginning.
00:07:34.166 - 00:08:06.624, Speaker B: In the beginning, like in March, they did a drop that had like 10 million gold. Then five weeks later they did another one that had 10 million gold. Well, now the drops have 15 million gold and they say they're doing two over four weeks. And then the second piece is jackpot. Jackpot didn't exist in the beginning and now it exists. And that's probably emitting, I don't know, that one's hard to say, but maybe six to 8 million gold. So between the jackpot and the two more drops that they've committed to, that just means that all the gold that they created earlier, it has a much smaller piece of the pie.
00:08:06.624 - 00:08:33.959, Speaker B: So that was what really brought, you know, that number from like ten to six. And then the other piece of it is, you know, l two s have been a little bit weak. I said that my guess for the valuation for this was 12 billion and I changed my guess to 10 billion, just a little bit lower. Because if you look at optimism, token price, if you look at Arbitrum's token price, like, they've just gone down. They're down like 50% in the past three months. I think those are the easiest comparables. I'd say that this variable is the single hardest one to know.
00:08:33.959 - 00:08:44.287, Speaker B: But I think that might like, if I had to guess, you know, and obviously, again, I'm putting this all in the I have no idea what I'm talking about category. But if I had to guess, I would say that I think ten is a little bit conservative.
00:08:44.455 - 00:09:17.128, Speaker A: Well, and I think here in a little bit we're going to look into some of like the blast stats versus other l two stats. But before we get there, you put out this pretty interesting tweet that I wanted to just quickly take a look at as it related to points because I think I remember when blast first came out, it was like one blast gold is 36,000 points and now like one blast gold is 107,000 points. But then there's like point multipliers factored in. And this I was a little lost on. Could you break this down?
00:09:17.296 - 00:09:38.602, Speaker B: I am entirely lost on this, too. The biggest problem was that 36,000 number meant no one to anyone. So people came out and, you know, I responded. People were like, oh, they just downgraded gold to points. I was like, you can't downgrade gold to points from something that made no sense in the first place. Not a single person, there isn't a single person in the world who knew what that 36,000 meant. And here's my basic take.
00:09:38.602 - 00:09:51.082, Speaker B: That 36,000 was released the day that gold was launched. And I think their goal with creating that was to be like, guys, you've got all these points. Well, gold's worth more. Go farm the shit out of me. Go do these things.
00:09:51.258 - 00:09:59.846, Speaker A: That was like, the big messaging was like, gold is infinitely harder to earn. It's infinitely more valuable than points. That was like, all the marketing messaging around it.
00:09:59.930 - 00:10:40.980, Speaker B: You're spot on. So they put that number in there to convey that to people, but then they never change that number as multipliers came in. They never changed that number as inflation came in. So I think what they had to do is they had to update that number in a way that, like, made it make some degree of sense. And I think what that new number is, is basically they're saying, if you get to the 24 x multiplier, if you get to that multiplier, how much will each gold be worth then? If you have a twelve x multiplier, which I'd say most people probably have a million points, according to my estimates, would be worth $112. If you have a 14 x multiplier, that means you have more points. So those wall points are going to be worth less per points because you got more points.
00:10:40.980 - 00:11:02.504, Speaker B: Now, that doesn't mean you made a mistake. I had some people be like, oh, I should have never done the multiplier. Like, no, because now you have more points, so they have to be worth less. Because it's not like money just appears out of thin air. Although sometimes people think that, I mean, I mean, I know, exactly, but, yeah, so if you have a 14 x multiplier, then you're. Then a million points would be worth 90, would be worth $96. So that was kind of.
00:11:02.504 - 00:11:06.412, Speaker B: I'm self conscious that no one listening has any idea what I'm talking about.
00:11:06.468 - 00:11:24.852, Speaker A: But, I mean, I don't think anyone listening has any idea what anything is happening. You know what I mean? Like, that's kind of why I was like, I just felt like I needed to get on the phone with you because I was reading this and I was like, I like to think I'm smart, but I am so fucking lost. So I know I can't be the only one who's, like, lost.
00:11:24.948 - 00:11:46.548, Speaker B: Like, I was literally going crazy reading my comments that morning. I don't know why I let this up get to me. I don't know why I let it get to me. You know, like, I was, like, I was reading comes, I was like, God, you guys have no idea what you're talking about. And also, just like, if you're going to leave that ratio, you got to say what you're. And you also have these multipliers that are changing for everyone, and your ratio doesn't change as those multipliers go higher. You've got to put a little bit of an explanation in there.
00:11:46.548 - 00:12:00.604, Speaker B: Like, as I was listening to Pacman, I was like, I'm not even sure he knows what he's talking about because he still is not really tying these knots together. Like, I think his assumption here is that that's what you're. That that's what your gold will be worth per points once you get to 24 x.
00:12:01.664 - 00:12:57.738, Speaker A: Okay, so, like, with that said, like, obviously there's been some reactions to the. To this tge delay to the dilution to, like, these new estimates coming out around gold. But I do want to take a minute and, like, zoom out and actually look at some stats with you about, like, where we are right now in the blast ecosystem because I think as high as the emotions are on the timeline, I still think people aren't actually fully comprehending what's happening by looking on chain. And so some of the things that I just thought was interesting, and I mentioned this in my state of blast video, but it's like, we're so worried about dilution. And yes, obviously it's coming, but it's not like you're being diluted by new capital. Like, I'm looking at the total eth volume and, like, what the daily volume is, and it just feels really steady to me. Like, we haven't really seen any massive, like, capital influx.
00:12:57.738 - 00:13:06.170, Speaker A: Like, are these things that you're looking at as you kind of, like, create your thesis around blast? Like, are you feeling bullish? Bearish? Where are you at?
00:13:06.362 - 00:13:30.738, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's like when people say things like, oh, our points are getting diluted by multipliers. I'm like, the only, like, so here's the thing about points, and we'll get to this. This is a separate thing. Half the airdrop is going to gold, and gold has very weird supply dynamics. Half the airdrop is going to points, and the only thing that dilutes points. And it's really hard to get points diluted that much because six sevenths of it's already finished. But the only thing that would dilute points is someone bridging, like, a billion dollars.
00:13:30.738 - 00:13:53.154, Speaker B: Okay, so. And as you show here, there's not a ton of eth coming on. And I think. I think that's the world we live in right now, is one where, like, some people love blast. Some people just kind of believe in it. Some people, reluctantly, are like, damn, I'll just go, because pac man makes people money. But those people have already made up their minds, and I don't think we're getting a ton of more capital into blast right now.
00:13:53.154 - 00:14:20.650, Speaker B: And I think that the inflows and these numbers would show it. Farmers are bridging a little bit more, but you're not getting tons of capital inflow into blast anymore. This is why I think the TG is important. I think you need to shift the narrative away from invisible points to, okay, they have a real token that's trading on binance or coinbase or whatever is trading that's liquid. I can convert that into money that I can use to, you know, to pay my dog's vet bill, whatever. Like, I need to get to that stage.
00:14:20.762 - 00:15:09.706, Speaker A: Well, and so this is what's also interesting. It's like, the Defi TVL, which is, like, all of the money that's actually locked up in protocols and smart contracts, has, like, really just stabilized. And then I asked Riza. Riza, I hope I said that, right, to put together this, like, l two landscape, because I think, like, that's the other thing too, like, you were talking about for your blast gold estimates. Kind of using arbitrum and optimism as, like, your baseline for FDV, I thought it'd be really interesting if we could actually look at, like, where we actually are. Obviously, a lot of, like, the daily active wallets are on arbitrum, but if you look, it's kind of crazy. Like, blast is slowly, slowly getting there.
00:15:09.706 - 00:15:37.864, Speaker A: When it comes to optimism. I just thought this was interesting because it's, like, blast is clearly the fastest growing chain. We see blast having pretty high user retention in comparison to arbitrum and bass. Blast users were pushing, on average, more transactions than any other ecosystem. Even though the volume isn't here, it just feels like the activity and attention is here, and it's just hard for me not to be bullish on something like this.
00:15:38.214 - 00:16:14.822, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll take the other side of this one. If we're talking about how blast should be getting the same fully diluted valuation as arbitrum and optimism, but there's just nowhere near the amount of volume. I'm not volume. There's nowhere near the amount of money bridged over. If you look at some of these charts, user retention is not as good as optimism, I think, because there's so much less capital on blast. Like, for you to make the argument that blast should be, like, getting the same valuation multiple as arbitrum, and optimism, like, everything else, has to be blowing out of the park. Like, growth has to be blowing them out of the water.
00:16:14.822 - 00:16:20.950, Speaker B: User attention has to be blowing out of the water because the amount of cap money on there, I think from the chart you're showing, is much, much.
00:16:20.982 - 00:16:53.654, Speaker A: Lower, but the time to reach 500,000 users was much faster. I agree with you. We're not quite seeing the exact same stats, but I'm also just, like, blast has been on mainnet for two months, and, like, how long have these other networks been up? And to see how rapidly it's growing in terms of, like, catching up, I would say from an activity perspective, not a volume perspective. Like, if we take out arbitrum, like, this is the blast volume compared to optimism.
00:16:54.114 - 00:17:10.130, Speaker B: Yeah, but go to arbitrum. Okay. All right. So I try to answer it with this. Okay. So if you're looking at this chart, like, arbitrum only has a $10 billion, fully dilutive valuation. So if you're going to say that blast has to have the same valuation, like, here, you can see that there's a lot more going on.
00:17:10.130 - 00:17:39.896, Speaker B: I think, like, Xi and a bunch of other chains are on arbitrum, you know? So right now, blast, like, is way behind at least arbitrum in terms of volume, but we're saying it should get the same valuation. And in order to say that, you just have to say that the growth is just out of blowing it out of the water. And I'm not even convinced that that's totally true. Like, blast was very quick to get to a lot of users, but that was all very front heavy, and the growth is really declining pretty sharply right now. Like I said, like, I think people either in or they're out at this point. There's not tons of growth. Like, yes, there's a lot more.
00:17:39.896 - 00:18:16.576, Speaker B: Like, people are clicking a lot more on blast because, like, there's a ton of farming going on. So I don't like these numbers. To me, don't get me too excited about, like, a $20 billion valuation relative to what's out there. What does is the fact that, like, one, this is a narrative game. And I think that the narrative and the attention economics of this situation are, like, hugely positive on blast. It's not like these aren't like, dividend paying assets like Google or Facebook, right? Like, there's a weird kind of logic people use for what creates valuation in l two s. And I'm not fully sure what it is, but broadly speaking, I don't think the numbers really get you there.
00:18:16.576 - 00:18:51.010, Speaker B: I think the things that get you there are attention, economics, narrative, and the fact that only 15% of the fully diluted valuation is going to be floating. And I think, so you're going to have, like, so the market cap. If you actually look at the market cap on a $10 billion valuation, it's like 1.5 billion, which is like, what flow is like. If you actually go and see what are the market cap coins on Coingecko, you're gonna see a lot of stuff that, like, you haven't even heard of. And here we're talking about the biggest story of the year, arguably one of the most controversial stories of the year. One of the founders who is one of the biggest names of the year.
00:18:51.010 - 00:19:03.370, Speaker B: I just think at the end of the day, like, liquidity dynamics make this. Make this more valuable. But look, I'm. Look, I'm a blast bull. I got almost all my money on blast, but I'm also. I also come from the equity research world. You know, it's a huge.
00:19:03.370 - 00:19:20.994, Speaker B: One of the. One of my absolute favorite tweets ever was from D Farmer. And he said the reason that people from the traditional world can never compete with us is because they first have to unlearn everything they've ever learned before, ever. And I. Sometimes I run into that as someone talking about the space.
00:19:21.154 - 00:19:27.314, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I mean, this is why we call you our web3 boomer dad. I mean, like, case in point.
00:19:27.474 - 00:19:28.454, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:29.204 - 00:19:48.424, Speaker A: I mean, so it's obvious that, like, we're both very bullish. I don't know if I. I think I stand by my interpretation of the stats of, like, I think there's a lot of room to grow. And I think, like, to your point, the narrative does need this magic Internet money to turn into something tangible. And I think that's just gonna be like rocket fuel for the ecosystem.
00:19:48.764 - 00:20:14.700, Speaker B: I feel like the world of blast is divided into two types of people. Like, I was doing a daily news show about blur throughout their entire ride. So you have people like me who. And you who really followed blur closely, and we know what the playbook looks like, or at least look like. In that case, it could be different here, and we know, at least in that case, it was season two. That was really what brought the fuel to the fire. You know, it was like, this is not going to let up.
00:20:14.700 - 00:20:21.460, Speaker B: The minute this event happens, it's actually going to get even bigger, and you're going to get more news stories about it because of the token launch.
00:20:21.532 - 00:20:50.264, Speaker A: But, like, speaking of which, like, okay, taking another step back and, you know, we've, we've seen how this playbook goes before. I've said it multiple times. I don't think pac man has, like, revealed all of the cards up the sleeve yet. And I feel like we got a hint of it a couple of days ago when he was like, basically the reason why we delayed TGE is because of an engineering lift that's required for something that we want to do. I don't know if this is staking. I don't know if this is institution. Great perps.
00:20:50.264 - 00:20:54.986, Speaker A: Like, do you have any fun speculations on, like, what this could possibly be?
00:20:55.090 - 00:21:21.622, Speaker B: I mean, I think, look, I think look at all the. Look at what they've built now. They built this crazy ecosystem with gold and points, and everyone distributes it in their own way. And you have this jackpot thing now, and they've created this kind of incredible ecosystem that somehow all works together. Yeah, there's a lot of tech left there. So even just doing what they're doing, if they want to come out with something new for season two, that's a lot of tech. You know, they just launched point.
00:21:21.622 - 00:21:41.510, Speaker B: They just launched jackpot, like a week and change ago. They just launched blur. Like, they've got a lot of stuff they're working on, and I'm sure just more of the same could be coming with season two. And that takes tech, like launching your token takes tech. I mean, we know over at Memeland that you got to negotiate market makers, you got to negotiate with exchanges. You got to get your investors on board. There's a lot to line up.
00:21:41.510 - 00:22:13.598, Speaker B: And I just think, like, adding 26 days to this, to me, to me, it's. I was making a big deal of it because all my estimates became wrong. But, like, existentially, I don't think this is like, holy cow, they're going to do something crazy. How? I just think, I mean, even blur, they tweeted March 15 coming in April just to launch an exchange they already had on blur on Eth on the blast, and it ended up taking them to the very last day of April to do it. So I think here they're just like, damn, we're just not even. We're just not ready yet. And let's give ourselves 26 days.
00:22:13.598 - 00:22:33.534, Speaker B: It was interesting. Like, they gave themselves a hard date. You know, they had already done that with May, but they're like, June 26, we're not fucking around this time. So I'm not reading as deep into it. I don't think. I don't know. It makes sense to me that even in the absence of some existential change, that they needed more time to get their tech lined up.
00:22:33.914 - 00:22:58.336, Speaker A: I think that's fair. I think, you know, I'm just going to be over here in my little, like, degen head speculating wildly because I just, they've set this date and I feel like there's no way that they weren't working on stuff leading up to this date. And to your point, I also feel like it has to be close. It's probably undergoing audits. Like, audits can take weeks. Like, who knows?
00:22:58.480 - 00:23:11.726, Speaker B: I mean, if there's a. Yeah, you know, I mean, maker Da. I think that. I think that they need to get rid of maker Dow. I think they need their own yielding token. I shouldn't say to get rid of them. I think ultimately doesn't make sense to be funneling a billion dollars into maker dab.
00:23:11.726 - 00:23:33.508, Speaker B: You know, like, so I think there's other stuff within the infrastructure that they want to do. But I mean, that's another example. Like he told you on your podcast at nftnyc. When was that? Like March or April? He told you the beginning of April. Yeah. He told you then that that jackpot was coming. He's like, I mean, he didn't say it so much, but he's like, look, we need something to reward assets.
00:23:33.508 - 00:23:57.056, Speaker B: It took him six weeks to crank it up. It took six weeks to make jackpot. It was just literally something that, it's a slot machine that gives a product. Like, that's a big lift. But that took six weeks. Like, you know, I mean, the fact that they added 26 days, I don't think is like a sign that the world's about to change. I just think everything they do, and you're right, like, I mean, talk about what would destroy this platform.
00:23:57.056 - 00:24:04.134, Speaker B: Like a security breach. So, like, all the audits, they have to do it just, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not reading too deep here.
00:24:04.594 - 00:24:13.530, Speaker A: All right, well, I think you brought us back down to earth. Thanks again, Sam, for taking the time on a Saturday. And yeah, I hope this thank you.
00:24:13.562 - 00:24:30.242, Speaker B: For all you're doing ecosystem. You know, I think I think this, this ecosystem benefits so much from you. And like I've said this time and time again, like the game that you are in in content is about finding a way to ride and then just riding it to all the way through and you're crushing it. So I appreciate it.
00:24:30.378 - 00:25:28.528, Speaker A: Thank you. I appreciate that. So for me, obviously really cool to get to have stats on to go through some of that stuff on chain together. I think if anything, that conversation just reaffirmed the feeling that blast is going to take people by surprise after TGE again, as of right now, we haven't seen any massive influxes of new capital on blast yet. So you have to ask yourself, especially with the extra month, to get exposure before TGE, like, do I think that this is a good opportunity to get exposure to this new ecosystem? Does this ecosystem have staying power even after incentives? And for me, the answer to that is yes. So with that said, let's go over the last part of the study assignment for this video. Lastly, I want to know a bit about why you're here, not necessarily on blast, but why you're in crypto or in web3, or why you chose to be a participant in this space.
00:25:28.528 - 00:25:59.252, Speaker A: I've gone ahead and set aside 0.5 ETH and a few blast native nfts, including a blastopian, a blasthood, and a metistry Apollo NFT for this study assignment. I'm excited to see what you guys come up with. Don't forget, there are two parts to this assignment, and this will run for one week and end on May 27 at 03:00 p.m. pT. If you are participating from YouTube, please do me a favor and find this video on my ex profile and comment from there. And that's a wrap for this 1.
00:25:59.252 - 00:26:08.364, Speaker A: June 26. You know what to do. It's time to lock the fuck in. Bearish or bullish? Keep building, keep farming, keep learning until the next one, guys.
