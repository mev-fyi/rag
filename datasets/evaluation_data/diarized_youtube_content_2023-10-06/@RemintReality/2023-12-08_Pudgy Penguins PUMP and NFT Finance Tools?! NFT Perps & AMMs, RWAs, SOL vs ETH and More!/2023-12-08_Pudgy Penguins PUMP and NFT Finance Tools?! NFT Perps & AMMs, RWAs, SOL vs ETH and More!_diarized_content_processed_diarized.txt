00:00:00.160 - 00:00:24.806, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm Jen. I'm Dalton and this is our second episode of Remit reality. Really exciting show we have for you guys today. We actually have a special guest and we're going to be doing all the same things, but really excited to actually get his opinion on what's happening in the market and some of the awesome building news that is going on. So without further ado, Titan, welcome to the stage. How are you?
00:00:24.910 - 00:00:33.604, Speaker B: I'm very good. Thank you for having me. I'm a big fan of the show. I know it's relatively new, but I'm a big fan of you guys as well. So, boom, we're here.
00:00:34.184 - 00:00:50.400, Speaker C: I'm actually. I'm actually really excited. This is the first time we've ever met in person, so this is going to be fun. We have a lot to cover and I'm excited to get your takes on some of this stuff. I know we've been in each other's DM's, but this is definitely more IRL feel, right?
00:00:50.472 - 00:00:54.002, Speaker B: Yeah. And we have a call scheduled after this, too. But, you know, this is a great.
00:00:54.018 - 00:00:56.242, Speaker C: Way to kick it off.
00:00:56.418 - 00:01:07.530, Speaker A: Hell yeah. Titan. Before we start going into some of the market highlights, you want to just give a quick background on who you are and what you're doing and how you've basically been all over NFT lending.
00:01:07.642 - 00:01:33.150, Speaker B: Sure. Quick background. I've been in the space since 2017, started building products in 2020. I spent nine months in Asia in 2019 and went to a lot of the conferences and met a lot of people. Kind of built my network early on in Asia. So I feel like, you know, Asia is kind of like my second home, oddly enough. Weird way to start, but that's how I did.
00:01:33.150 - 00:02:13.836, Speaker B: And then, yeah, we started out with our first product, social pass. We've been partnered with Pudgy Penguins for about a year now, so we've been doing all their main events and so pretty cool on that end. And then more recently started building a protocol last year, nifty Finance and getting more involved in the NFT fi scene. Mostly been on, you know, like, sort of education, awareness. Realizing that the reason for the lack of, like, participants in the market isn't because people don't want to use these different protocols, it's because people just don't know that they can. And so, yeah, just like, focusing on my great raising awareness, like, hey, you can do this stuff. Here's why.
00:02:13.836 - 00:02:38.364, Speaker B: It's not a bad thing. And so, yeah, and then I helped to create the pudgy lending desk, which is essentially a telegram group, where we facilitate, you know, lending, borrowing, you know, buy now, pay later, different NFT fi strategies around, like, pudgy penguins collections. And so that's been really fun to kind of see, like, people get more involved and start using all these protocols.
00:02:38.404 - 00:03:07.930, Speaker A: So that's dope. And, like, on the education front, Dalton and I talk about this a lot. Like, why aren't more people interested in NFT finance tools? Is it because they don't know? Or, like, is it too intimidating? And I think you kind of hit the nail right on the head. Majority of them don't know. So really awesome that you have the pudgy lending desk. And speaking of pudgy penguins and the broader market. Holy crap, guys, are we back? Like, Dalton, I know last week we're like, I don't know how I feel about all the bull posting, but oh.
00:03:08.002 - 00:03:39.520, Speaker C: My goodness, to see, to see some of these NFTs really flex and just like, start getting legs and actually get some, get some liquidity. I know that we're going to be talking about, like, ETH and soul and kind of the differences that we've seen over the past, say, two months. Right? We had this massive explosion of Solana NFTs and Solana in general, but now we're starting to see some of this, some of this action come back over to ETH, the ethnicity main mainland. Right. And I'd kind of like to hear your take on, on what pudgies are doing different and, and where this kind of came from.
00:03:39.672 - 00:03:56.364, Speaker B: So I was on a space maybe two days ago or so, or maybe yesterday. I can't remember. I don't know. Time flies. But it was, it was dancing at a space. Great guy, by the way. He's doing something similar now to kind of like raise awareness for a lot of the NFT five stuff that's going on.
00:03:56.364 - 00:05:05.076, Speaker B: But we were talking about, you know, all the different factors for pudgy penguins specifically. And what we realized is, so I've talked to the team and had different conversations around, like, NFT fi and like, different sort of liquidity incentives and things like that. And usually the conversation was that they don't really want to be involved, at least from a sort of team perspective. And so that's kind of like left the community to their own devices to kind of like, yeah, figure out, like, how to add liquidity or raise awareness ourselves, which I think is kind of like a good and bad thing. But what it's done is it's definitely kind of like made things more organic. And then obviously on the other end, like, what they're doing is they're just driving growth from a team perspective, from, like, you know, sort of executing as a collection, as a company, which is all that's really required to be able to really drive speculative growth. And then on top of that, people want more exposure, whether directly or indirectly.
00:05:05.076 - 00:05:59.232, Speaker B: And that's where I'm trying to come in and try to teach people that, hey, if you do want more exposure because you like what the pudgy penguins are doing, here's how you can do it. And so one of the things that came up for little pudgy specifically is people realizing that there's a sort of arbitrage gap between, you know, pudgy penguins and the little pudgies based on sort of, like, ratios people are using from, like, bored apes and mutant apes, for example. And so a lot of the little pudgy whales, you know, we're doing whatever they could to sort of get more little pudgies. And so that drove a lot of growth, a lot of volume. And then people want to get forever paints, you know, the bigs, because, you know, it's. There's actually a very small supply available, even for, like, wizards. Specifically, the floor now is 20 e for wizards because it's sort of like just a sought after trait, and there's only, like, 180 or so in the collection.
00:05:59.232 - 00:06:16.068, Speaker B: So just different, a lot of different factors. But I guess, in general, like, the collections, you know, driving growth, and then everybody else just wants exposure. So there's a lot of different ways to do that now, and people are aware of it now, so they're starting to leverage it. So. Yeah, so I think that's main things.
00:06:16.156 - 00:06:46.980, Speaker A: Do you think that, like, you know, Art Basel is this week? There are a ton of people flying out. I know that inner igloo was just last weekend, but is this at all, this pump similar to kind of like, the same pump we saw with Azuki prior to the Vegas event? Does it feel like that for you as someone who's, like, really deep in the community, or is this more like an accumulation of everything, like, Luca and team has done and it's finally being recognized and realized?
00:06:47.172 - 00:07:18.910, Speaker B: I think it's a little bit of both. Right. It's a couple of different factors. So coming from, like, a social pass angle, you know, we've done a lot of these events for pudgy penguins, and we have seen, like, especially during ticketing windows for, like, little pudgies. You know, people would buy little pudgies to be able to use as tickets. So they've been, like, buying, you know, before it wasn't, you know, so expensive, but, you know, buying these little pudgies for, like, 0.5 ETH, for example, as, like, tickets to these events, because they're.
00:07:18.910 - 00:07:35.590, Speaker B: They're really nice events. I mean, they're. They're some of the best events in the space. And so that's, you know, sort of one angle. Right? I'm sure people are doing that. And I think we actually have data to show that they are for this as well. But it's not enough to really, like, you know, sort of, you know, be the only factor.
00:07:35.590 - 00:08:18.146, Speaker B: You know, if that was it, then I don't think we would see, like, the growth that we're having right now. I think it's just more so, like, I don't know, like Lucas been talking about, hey, like, at the end of the year, like, this is some. Some cool stuff that we're doing. And then, like, throughout, like, without even having any sort of, like, pre announcement, just, like, dropping things, like, hot topic, you know, like, that was on the radar. Like, nobody knew about that. And so it's like, all these different events that are sort of just, like, adding to what, you know, Luke is already pointing to before, which is like, hey, end of the year is gonna be pretty big. We have a big announcement, which I think, of course, will be, like, dropped at the event.
00:08:18.146 - 00:08:37.496, Speaker B: Whereas, like, I guess, Azuki, the announcement was. And you guys, maybe you guys, you're more zooky than me, Jen, I don't have one. So you can kind of comment on this better than I could, but I guess the announcement was hit, like, kind of like, hey, we're launching another collection. You know, I don't know.
00:08:37.560 - 00:08:39.364, Speaker C: I don't know if I lose all of this.
00:08:43.424 - 00:08:44.624, Speaker A: What'd you say, dalton?
00:08:44.744 - 00:08:47.904, Speaker C: I said, we're about to dilute the fuck out of this collection.
00:08:48.024 - 00:09:33.414, Speaker A: Oh, honestly, like, as someone who mint and participated in the elemental mint, like, I don't think it was necessarily that, oh, we're dropping another collection. That kind of led to the cascading downfall. I think it was the one. The fact that the mint never made it to public, to the fact that, as with the reveal mechanism that they had, these elemental beings were revealing one by one. And it became very clear after the first, like, few revealed that it's like, dude, this looks just like the OG collection, if not better. And then that caused FUD. And then that caused the liquidity spiral on blend, and next thing you know it, everyone was down real fucking bad.
00:09:33.414 - 00:10:06.170, Speaker A: But I want to talk about pudgies and NFT lending real quick because I saw this pretty cool announcement from the arcade team who I know they launched their token. It's not tradable, it's not transferable yet, but they still have point season happening on their platform. And so now it looks like, you know, if you're basically lending or borrowing against a pudgy on arcade, you get a 2.5 x multiplier on that. And I think that's pretty cool for trying to onboard a new collection into the NFT fi space.
00:10:06.322 - 00:10:13.756, Speaker B: I agree, and I'm a big fan of Castro and arcade team general, so I love it.
00:10:13.820 - 00:10:56.540, Speaker C: This is, this is one of those areas in the, in the NFT lending space. I know Jen and I have spoken on this quite a bit before, but it feels very pvP. It feels very like us versus them and we're not really focused on growing the pie. There are a couple teams that are kind of going outward and growing it, but, and I also understand that within the NFT ecosystem, there is only so far that you can go, right. There's only so many PFP collections that are over five ETH, right? Like maybe four or five right there. There's not very many collections that you could go to and be like, ah, okay, they have a shit ton of value. So there is this kind of PvP kind of aspect to NFT lending marketplaces.
00:10:56.540 - 00:11:21.584, Speaker C: Right. How do you feel like that is going to progress over the coming twelve months, especially as we kind of get into bull season? There's going to be more collections, more NFT collections that start pumping? There's going to be, there's going to be a little bit of a diversification here. Do we see collections, say, a la pudgy's going to arcade more than say some other NFT lending platform? Do you think that we start seeing kind of collaborations and partnerships between, between these NFT collections?
00:11:22.924 - 00:12:27.418, Speaker B: That's a great question. I know historically, like pudgy penguins, the team has been really, like I said, standoffish on NFT Fi in general. I remember there was some scenarios like maybe 2020 or something where people were getting liquidated and I think that the team or the community helped to, I guess, I don't know, make them whole again. And they just didn't want to take a stance or even educate because of that. And I'm sure other collections actually, they're starting to get interested because they see this as an opportunity, whereas some might see it as like, you know, maybe not an opportunity, but something that could be detrimental to their community inflection. Like, sappy seals, for example, like, wob. He actually has a defi background, and he is looking at all the different options, you know, like, finding ways to, like, increase liquidity for the collection, whether it's like.
00:12:27.418 - 00:13:06.642, Speaker B: I mean, I'm sure he's looking at all options, you know, including, like, perps and other things that, you know, will come online soon. So I think, you know, there's some collections that are going to say, okay, like, I understand this. I understand that, like, more liquidity is not a bad thing. So I'm going to do what I can to, like, understand this and, you know, be able to contribute or, like, work with these protocols to get a better understanding of, like, how it could benefit the community. But, yeah, I mean, it's more. It's like, more utility, you know, being able to take your asset and use it for or more of, you know, what you can use the asset for, like, financially speaking. I don't see it as a bad thing, and some people do.
00:13:06.642 - 00:13:47.454, Speaker B: Right. So it's difference of opinion. But I think as time goes on for these protocols specifically, especially, like, the peer to peer stuff, I think this is, like, a lot of these things are just kind of, like, the first layer. And I see, like, other sort of apps and platforms being built on top of this. Like, for example, you know, why can't we have an app that lets you take a loan out against your NFT to be able to, like, fund travel, for example, or, for example, I don't know, like, this crazy idea, but, you know, expensive Taylor Swift ticket. Why can't you use your NFT to finance that Taylor Swift effect? I know you're gonna love that.
00:13:50.874 - 00:13:55.546, Speaker A: Dalton just found out that I'm, like, a die Hardsworth swifty. Like, last.
00:13:55.650 - 00:13:56.934, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:13:57.754 - 00:14:00.106, Speaker A: Hey, just how you red pilled me on Solana.
00:14:00.170 - 00:14:29.520, Speaker C: I'm gonna. Okay. I'm so excited. No, like, I think what you're talking about here is it is a very crucial and pivotal point for NFT finance. I think we were on a spaces the other day, the Benroy spaces, and that was. I was a very interesting talk that kind of led us to this point where it was like, normies. Normies are already going to have a difficult time paying $200 gas fees.
00:14:29.520 - 00:14:37.336, Speaker C: Right. Like, I don't think that that is sustainable at all. And we're seeing, like, today I had to pay $78 for gas, dude. I was just like, what?
00:14:37.440 - 00:14:38.000, Speaker B: That's crazy.
00:14:38.032 - 00:14:59.504, Speaker C: This is. This is not cool. Like, I don't like this right. So I think that that's going to be a problem that we face. Right? And then on top of that, if we're talking about NFT finance primitives, like, it's expensive, dude. And, like, you're going to have to pay $78, and then you're going to have to approve the transaction, and then you're hopefully going to be making more than whatever. You're like, whatever kind of scraps you're fighting over.
00:14:59.504 - 00:15:26.524, Speaker C: I don't think it's going to happen the way that we've always thought it was going to happen. And it's going to. It's going to be an education problem. Like, it is an education problem at this point. And I think that people opting in to NFT finance is going to be a very big hurdle. I think if it's built the way that, I don't know, like, you don't necessarily know that you're using NFT finance. And then it's just so, such easy to access yield that, like, people are like, oh, fuck.
00:15:26.524 - 00:15:43.924, Speaker C: Like, I. I could take a loan for 11% and I'm going to be making 18% a la come at, like, this m. Steeth pool over at Meta Street. I think that that is very interesting. Right. Because then it's worth it to take out the loan, and then you instantly get routed somewhere. And liquidity routers are going to be extremely important in this.
00:15:43.924 - 00:15:46.020, Speaker C: But, like, to have some Joe schmo.
00:15:46.092 - 00:15:46.348, Speaker B: Yep.
00:15:46.396 - 00:15:57.704, Speaker C: It's like, I've never taken a loan out on something. Why would I do that? And I don't trust myself because I'm gonna. I'm gonna fuck this up. Like, yeah, I understand. Like, that people would be scared, right?
00:15:59.084 - 00:16:30.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a super valid point. But, you know, we talked about this on the Ben Roy spaces. I think, like, consumer lending is ripe for disruption. Like, we saw arcade lead with the first couple of RWA loans. Now we're seeing, you know, a platform like kettle, which we'll get into a little bit later, that just launched their beta that's solely focused on RWA loans. And so I definitely think there's a place for that. And speaking of Rwas Titan, I know you've been traveling, like, all over Asia.
00:16:30.440 - 00:16:42.818, Speaker A: I think you're in Singapore right now, and you've been uploading these really awesome, like, video recaps about some of the conversations you're having over there. But what's the alpha? Like, what's the TLDR? What do we need to know?
00:16:42.946 - 00:17:57.816, Speaker B: I mean, the alpha is like, there's a lot of, like, assets out here that could be collateralized and tokenized and brought on chain and then obviously introduced to global liquidity, you know, in the western world, us, Europe, et cetera. And then in terms of, like, kind of how governments feel about this stuff, like, obviously, I mean, I think we're gonna get into it. But Singapore, they launched the project Guardian through the Mas, you know, the monetary authority service here in Singapore. And they're obviously, like, you know, innovating with, like, onyx, Blackrock, JPMorgan, already trying to find different ways to sort of utilize rwas both, like, fungible and non fungible to be able to, yeah, like settle on chain or transfer or, you know, obviously, like, beyond that is like borrowing and lending and things like that. Yeah, I guess the TLDR is, I think, you know, if we're talking about, like, kind of like how the RWA and, like, borrowing and lending space evolves, the, the PFP market is just sort of like the first layer. It's. It's a digitally, you know, on chain native asset that we can kind of experiment with.
00:17:57.816 - 00:19:02.040, Speaker B: But, you know, we're going to be bringing all these, you know, real world assets, you know, as it's called on chain, you know, in the next maybe, I don't know, one to three years or so. I don't think it's going to take that long. And so, like, Asia is kind of ripe for it because a lot of the governments are looking for, like, other opportunities to be able to, like, get global liquidity for stale assets, like real estate markets in Vietnam and Malaysia specifically. Like, nobody can move them because there's just like, a lack of liquidity in, like, the local region. But what if you could, you know, sort of reach outside of that, you know, to, like, western markets to be able to, like, provide liquidity, you know, and, like, you know, Dalton was saying, like, route liquidity automatically, you know, through, you know, different, like, layer two applications, you know, things like that, through, like, apps and things like that. That's really popular out here. So, yeah, I think Asia is just, like, more free and flowing in terms of, like, regulations, and they'll probably produce a lot of the new collateral types.
00:19:02.072 - 00:19:47.816, Speaker A: So I. It's so, so it's funny that you say that because I was looking at what mass and JP Morgan and, like, Abax was doing, and basically what I got from that announcement was, okay, Singapore, Onyx from JP Morgan, and I think it's like, Apollo Global, I think, is the name of the fund. We're just exploring and experimenting with proof of concepts for smart contracts. And I had no idea that it was also non fungible. I kind of just assumed it was all fungible. But it's really awesome to definitely see, you know, to see traction there, like you said, because quite frankly, there haven't been that many countries that have come out and been like, hey, we're open to exploring this. We're going to check it out.
00:19:47.816 - 00:19:50.072, Speaker A: Been a pretty slow moving needle.
00:19:50.208 - 00:20:27.958, Speaker C: Okay, this is, this is going to be my, I don't mean to be a Debbie downer, and I know that we cover rwas on this show all the time, but I think one of the areas that I, that I'm a little worried about is similar to Gamefi. Like, gamefi has been a thing for so long, they're like, gamefi. This is the cycle for Gamefi, bro. And I'm like, okay, yeah, like, this is a cycle for gamefi. And then axie infinity blows up, right? And then, like, everybody's like, gamefi is gonna be it. And then, like, nothing else popped off, right? Like, I think atlas popped off, right? So then those two go and they're gonna be like, everybody's like, rwas this time. It's, it's here, bro.
00:20:27.958 - 00:20:56.930, Speaker C: And I'm like, I don't know if it's here yet. Like, I think that we're getting there and there's going to be some excitement, but, like, there are so many legal hurdles that we have to go through. And I speak to teams and that are working on rwas all the time. Like, I spoke with parcel today. We're going to get into them later. Like, I think real estate perks on chain is pretty badass. Like, that's, that's a, that's an easy way to kind of like Trojan Horse the rest of the, or red pill the rest of the, the crypto community and be like, all right, cool, like, RWAs are here.
00:20:56.930 - 00:21:09.386, Speaker C: But I don't think that we really are going to see the scale at which we're talking about these things. We're like, yeah, this is a trillion dollar market. I'm like, yeah, it's a trillion dollar market, just not yet. And it's going to take a long time to get there.
00:21:09.530 - 00:21:48.472, Speaker A: I think if the Boston Global Research group is right, we got, like another seven years, almost six years now that we're entering into 2024 here in a few weeks. Like, adult. And I think. I think you do bring up, like, a really valid point of, like, rwas natively on chain. Like, do not necessarily yield more than what the US treasury is currently yielding at. And I think, like, those are the two stats that I see compared all the time. But I think as it matures and as regulatory like, or regulations across various jurisdictions become clear, I think there is a clear path forward.
00:21:48.472 - 00:22:00.884, Speaker A: But I agree with you. I don't necessarily think it's going to be the next one to three years. Sorry, Titan, I know that that was the number you threw out there, but I think we got a while to go, but it's going to be a freaking fun ride to watch.
00:22:01.304 - 00:22:46.082, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I do agree with all that. I guess what I would say is there's a couple of key points that are interesting, I guess, is there's maybe two main factors that might speed up the process. One is access, sort of making this yield that's in the real world more accessible and also composable. What I mean by that is like, we're seeing different protocols, sort of leverage, stake ETH, for example, like blast. They're doing it. They're saying, hey, we're going to take people's TVL on our chain and we're going to give you tokens in addition to getting yield from, like, stake ETH that already exists. Right.
00:22:46.082 - 00:23:14.296, Speaker B: And then sort of taking the yields from like, these real world assets. And then once you just tokenize them, you can kind of, like, you can build on top of that, right? Sort of building on top of the yield. And then. Yeah, the other end is like the access to, like, global liquidity. Right? So, like, if. If Southeast Asia wants to participate, you know, with treasury bills, I don't know where to start either. But if it's on chain, that's.
00:23:14.296 - 00:23:18.964, Speaker B: So I think that's just two things. But I totally agree. The timelines, maybe it's longer.
00:23:20.184 - 00:23:32.320, Speaker A: I mean, there's the, there's the alpha I was looking for from Asia right there. Like, nice little bomb drop. So with that said, let's move on to the builder news of the week.
00:23:32.432 - 00:23:33.304, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:23:33.424 - 00:23:56.382, Speaker A: Let's do it. All right, guys, you know me, I'm an advisor for kettle. I'm bullish on kettle. Anyone that wants to talk to me about consumer crypto, I'm probably going to mention kettle, because I think what they're doing is just so incredible. But really exciting news today. They launched their beta after being in a closed alpha for two months. So I think to come on to mainnet with like 1.75
00:23:56.382 - 00:24:13.694, Speaker A: million in TVL and over $700,000 in active loans is pretty insane. So definitely keep an eye out here, especially if you're one of those folks that's super interested in like watch loans, loans on like trading cards, comics, jewelry, all that fun.
00:24:13.734 - 00:25:22.616, Speaker C: Well see this is, this is one of those areas that I think, yes, I was being negative about saying like, okay, it's gonna take a long fucking time to get here. This is one of those areas that is here. Right? Like, I think that this is going to be similar to how friend tech is like starting to show the, it's, it's justifiable to build a socialfly protocol. Now after friend tech and after a couple of these kind of popped off, I think that the watches and kind of bringing in normies, like similar to how Frontech and social flight will be able to onboard normies. I think this kind of pawn shopping movement that we're seeing out of some of these NFT lending platforms and in 4k, like we definitely have to shout those guys out like for, for all they're doing to push that space forward. But I think that we're going to see some really cool loans and we're talking about composability and we're about to talk about the pseudoswap loan from, from Nifty five. But I think that like the composability that we see with rwas and how these NFT lending marketplaces and how 4K protocol, how they kind of start integrating normies into like saying, hey, like you have some junk in your, in your garage and you can send it to us and yeah, there you go.
00:25:22.616 - 00:25:27.136, Speaker C: Like, I think that it's, it's going to be catchy and it's going to be newsworthy, right?
00:25:27.200 - 00:26:19.742, Speaker A: Well, and I think the other thing too, on the tokenization front, like love the 4k team. Obviously, I have chatted them with them a lot, just given, you know, the work that they do with kettle. But I also think like just tokenization as a service probably has a huge place in this space. I imagine that there are going to be like, I didn't realize this until like two months ago, but apparently if you have a lot of like physical assets that are worth something, it is totally normal to vault those assets and not hold them in your home. And so I can definitely see like a tokenization as a service play to people who are vaulting today of like, hey, your invoicing system is super fucking out of date. We can digitize this, you, we can make it immutable, et cetera. And then that easily integrates into lending platforms and I think that's going to be like a massive b two b play.
00:26:19.742 - 00:26:26.574, Speaker A: Now, dalton, you mentioned nifty fi and the pseudo swap loan. Let's talk about it.
00:26:26.694 - 00:26:55.860, Speaker C: Yeah, this is. I think this is interesting because we're talking about composability. And what made this interesting to me was like taking a yield generating asset and then let it continue to generate yield as you're having like this, the capital efficiency to take the underlying capital and then go to use it elsewhere. I think that it's a small loan. It was like, what, 1.1.141, .2 something like that? Yeah, like, it's a small loan.
00:26:55.860 - 00:27:17.360, Speaker C: It's only 30 days, 20% APR. But I think it's the principle of the thing here. Like, it's a first. We're starting to see yield generating assets on chain. Yield generating assets have the composability to be like, it's a 721. It's a wrapped 721. So I think that this is the start of something interesting.
00:27:17.360 - 00:27:26.924, Speaker C: It's not quite interesting yet, but I think from where we go from here becomes an interesting conversation titan, do you have any take on that?
00:27:27.904 - 00:27:44.094, Speaker B: I'll be totally honest. That is actually news to me. I think it's really cool. I may not have much commentary on that, though. I think you guys might be better experts on that particular scenario. I probably should have done some research on that, but I didn't offer much.
00:27:44.714 - 00:27:46.098, Speaker C: I love that. Dude.
00:27:46.266 - 00:28:06.288, Speaker A: You're all good. That's the whole point of the show. We're breaking news. We're breaking news in NFT five. I think what was interesting for me on the pseudo swap loan is this rise and emergence of, like, financial nfts. I think, like uniswap v. Three liquidity positions are one example of it.
00:28:06.288 - 00:28:26.870, Speaker A: But now having these pseudo swap pools that can get wrapped into nfts and then, like, further composed is another, like, I'm thinking like digitally, or I guess I should say, like web three native financial assets. And that's like exactly what that pseudoswap pool is. And so to see some lending against that is pretty insane.
00:28:26.902 - 00:28:56.942, Speaker C: Let's see. And this is, we talked about this last week. Talked. Talking about NFT amms and on ETH, it's not a thing yet, right? Like, NFT amms are so, like such a tiny, tiny percentage of day to day ETH NFT transactions on Solana. That's not the case. Like, I bought a Solana NFT on an NFT amm today because it's so well integrated into tensor and magic Eden, for that matter, that, like, it just shows up, it looks the exact same. Like it says expand pool.
00:28:56.942 - 00:29:34.010, Speaker C: And that's the only difference, right? So, like, I bought from an NFT amm, and it was super easy. And so I think, like, if we're talking about amms and we're talking about composability and being able to wrap that and then take a loan out on that, like, imagine having a mad lads pool that's going to be sitting there generating, you yield, and then you being able to take a loan out on that mad lads pool. That's pretty badass, dude. Like, so right now, like I said, on ETH, that's not a thing. It's, it's a very small part of the market at this point. But on Solana in the last month, 20% of Solana NFT volume has gone through Solana NFTs.
00:29:34.082 - 00:29:49.394, Speaker A: So I know, I know we're going to compare, like, Solana lending versus ETH lending in a bit, because I'm just a bit curious to see, like, what those total numbers are in comparison to Ethan. I just, I wonder what the gaps are and why, you know?
00:29:49.854 - 00:29:52.998, Speaker C: I'll drop some knowledge later. Okay.
00:29:53.046 - 00:30:11.870, Speaker A: Speaking of composability, another really cool thing coming from an NFT lending platform. So meta street just integrated anchor staking into their platform. So similar to their wrapped, staked ETH crypto punks pool, they now have a. What is the, what is the thing? Anchor ETH.
00:30:11.982 - 00:30:12.750, Speaker C: Oh, there you go.
00:30:12.822 - 00:30:20.082, Speaker A: Yeah, anchor Ethan. They now have an anchor ETH pool. I swear to God, these, uh, these freaking acronyms.
00:30:20.218 - 00:30:23.654, Speaker C: Well, David's too smart. That's. David's too smart, bro.
00:30:24.314 - 00:30:52.916, Speaker A: Seriously. So this is pretty cool. If the, if you, there are folks who are curious how this works, you can basically just go over to meta street. You'll see these different pools in their earn tab, and you can kind of see what happens when you do enable additional yield on top of yield bearing tokens. Like, if I toggle this on, it goes from 13%, 17%, which is pretty crazy. So this is the effective APy for what you're actually earning.
00:30:53.060 - 00:31:25.340, Speaker C: And so this is what I was talking about earlier, right? Like, this is very NFT finance driven. This is very NFT finance native. But if they could bake this into a marketplace and have a button that says take a loan out and make 6%, like, then all of a sudden punk holders would be like, oh, fuck, I'll take, I'll make 6%. And the 6% is in staked ETH like that. That is where it becomes interesting. And would like to see that for all collections, not just punks. But then at the same time, like, it's tough, right? Because the volatility.
00:31:25.492 - 00:31:28.184, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say, like, we have to talk about the collateral.
00:31:30.804 - 00:31:35.868, Speaker C: Different class. Different class, for sure. 100%. But it is cool that those guys are building that.
00:31:36.036 - 00:31:59.984, Speaker A: Absolutely. Titan, you mentioned this a little bit, and then I think we might have mentioned it at the top of the show, but NFT perps guys are heating the fuck up. Like, I feel like just in, like, the last week and a half alone, I've seen, like, seven different announcements related to NFT perks. So I don't. Have you guys heard of hyper liquid before?
00:32:01.084 - 00:32:08.344, Speaker B: I have, but I. I can't say that I know too much about them, but I've seen them around.
00:32:08.644 - 00:32:09.044, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:09.084 - 00:32:33.074, Speaker A: Because I just learned about them, like, last week when we were chatting about this in the NFT Illuminati chat. So basically, hyper liquid. Perpetual Dex. Sorry? Perpetual futures Dex. And they have their own blockchain where all of this transacting is going on. And I was actually looking at the protocol, and there's, like, a lot of volume on it. When did this happen? Like, a week ago.
00:32:33.074 - 00:33:16.556, Speaker A: They create this index for NFT perps, and the index is made up of, like, board apes, mun apes, Azuki D gods, pudgy penguins and miladys. You know, I don't know if I would necessarily consider all of those blue chips. And, like, quite frankly, I would probably. If I were to rank the collateral quality, like, I kind of put a lot of those collections in, like, a tier two collateral quality, whereas, like, tier one is like, squiggles, autoglyphs, punks, things that, you know, have a little bit more of a proven track record. But I thought that this was interesting. In addition to that, on the perps front. You know, Wasabi just launched perps on Testnet, and they're integrating with flooring protocol.
00:33:16.556 - 00:33:19.788, Speaker A: Dalton, do you have thoughts on this? I know you're pretty big on flooring.
00:33:19.916 - 00:33:23.664, Speaker C: First off, I'm going to ignore the fact that you were talking shit on d gods, so.
00:33:24.244 - 00:33:25.396, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that's.
00:33:25.580 - 00:33:27.024, Speaker C: I'm like, you know, what.
00:33:30.244 - 00:33:30.950, Speaker A: Matters?
00:33:31.052 - 00:33:49.002, Speaker C: But that's besides the point. But, um, no, I. I'm super bullish on NFT perps. I think we. I've had multiple conversations in this. In this kind of area of the space, right, where we've had options. We have, uh, fractionalization and fungible tokens, like, flowing protocol, and then we have straight perps.
00:33:49.002 - 00:34:02.926, Speaker C: Like, I think that there this is such an easy area of the space for people to understand. If we're talking about NFT finance across the board, perps are easy. Long number go up, you make money. Short number go down, you make money. Right?
00:34:02.950 - 00:34:17.942, Speaker A: Like, I had to do some leverage trading on blur to figure that out. But I think to your point, it was because before to like, short an NFT or too long an NFT, you had to use options and puts and like, that just went right over my head.
00:34:18.038 - 00:35:00.230, Speaker C: It's too much right now. The, the problem for NFT perps in general, and we saw this happen with NFT perp in July. July, I believe. Um, they, the funding rate, this is going to get a little techy, but you have like the index price and then you have the mark price. Okay? And like, as those two get further and further away from each other, the, the percentage in which you were going to pay, like, as basically a penalty for like, taking that gap. And if the gap is this far, and I say I'm going to long it with ten x leverage, and that makes the gap even further, I'm going to have to pay an additional percentage. Right? So that's called the funding rate.
00:35:00.230 - 00:35:25.882, Speaker C: So that funding rate started getting so far away because like, it was like, Azuki news, the Azuki news broke and it was bad news. And then everybody's like, short the fuck out of Azuki. And so everybody's going ten x short and that funding rate is getting further and further away. And like, the actual floor price is like 17. And then the index price on the platform was like twelve. And so it's like, holy shit. So people were taking the twelve ETH and shorting it even more.
00:35:25.882 - 00:35:41.854, Speaker C: And it's like, yo, this is crazy. So the incentives were, you're thinking, okay, so if it's twelve ETH, then you're hoping that somebody says, all right, I'm along with ten x leverage to kind of get that, that index price and mark price to be closer to each other. Right?
00:35:42.314 - 00:35:49.202, Speaker A: It wasn't happening different because everyone was just like, I want to short and no one wanted too long, basically.
00:35:49.258 - 00:36:42.018, Speaker C: Exactly. Because there was, there was risk there, right? And so you're basically going PvP player versus player and saying like, all right, I think that the next person that's going to buy or that's going to transact in this pool is going to short as well. And then I can take advantage of that person, right? And so because NFTs are non fungible in nature, it makes it very, very difficult to have an appraisal value and have like a price that everybody agrees upon, right. So we use the floor price, but are the floor price, the floor price of pudgies? Right now we'll use over the last, what, two weeks? It's just gone absolutely parabolic. So technically the floor price is here, but maybe people think that pudgies are actually worth nine ETH instead of ten ETH. So then there's going to be this little funding rate here. So the floors on the, on the platform is going to be lower than the actual floor, right.
00:36:42.018 - 00:36:59.222, Speaker C: Because people are scared that the price is going to dump. So then there's like an arbitrage opportunity there. But still it's like this. NFT perps, I'm bullish on, but they have some mechanics that they have to get right and we haven't seen them get it right yet. Yeah.
00:36:59.318 - 00:37:02.790, Speaker A: Titan, have you been playing around with NFT perps? Any thoughts?
00:37:02.942 - 00:37:45.734, Speaker B: Actually? So, yeah, I think NFT perps is going to be one of the best ways to bring new participants into the market. In particular like Vietnam, Thailand, a lot of these places in Southeast Asia, they love like money games. So the easier it is to long, short collection and the speculative value, the more participants that you can bring into the market. And we haven't really been able to bring in a lot of these like emerging markets because, you know, barrier to entry. Right. A lot of ways you have to sort of own the asset directly. But yeah, a lot of these new options for indirect exposure is just going to bring more users, more market participants.
00:37:45.734 - 00:37:56.444, Speaker B: Maybe not so much in terms of like volume size, like transactions size, but it doesn't really matter. I mean, you know, more transactions, more movement, you know, more liquidity. It's always better.
00:37:57.144 - 00:37:57.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:57.992 - 00:38:04.832, Speaker C: So this is, I have a little bit of a segue here that is not in the notes, but we were just talking about this.
00:38:04.968 - 00:38:24.070, Speaker A: So wait, before you do, I also, there was one more perp news that I want to call out. Get it, called it all out. NFT perp, the actual protocol is also in their season two for paper trading. So if any of you guys want to fuck around and find out, uh, either check there or check on Wasabi on testnet. It should be a good time.
00:38:24.142 - 00:38:45.210, Speaker C: And it's, it's good to play around with these things because like, you need to learn how to do it. Jen was just doing this and I think that that's a, that's a huge skill to have. Like, if you do hear news, like say, Azuki drops the ball again, because that's what they do. Um, I think that going. Knowing. Knowing where to go and. And how to take advantage of that is.
00:38:45.210 - 00:38:45.714, Speaker C: Is a.
00:38:45.754 - 00:38:47.514, Speaker B: Is a solid play for any trader.
00:38:47.634 - 00:39:11.100, Speaker C: But I do have a question for Titan. So we. You just brought up gas. You brought up, um, that the transaction value might not be very big on perps. And the reason that is, is because traditionally speaking, the only way to take advantage of nfts was to buy and hold and hope number goes up. That was the only way to get it, get any exposure to nfts. Right.
00:39:11.100 - 00:39:47.874, Speaker C: That is changing. You said indirect exposure. Right. So if somebody wants to put $50 short at five x leverage against pudgy penguins right now because they've just pumped, like, they can do that. Right? Do you think that the NfT perp scene is going to exist on ETH l two s, or do you think we're going to start seeing NFT perps really take off on Solana? The only reason I say that is because there is a cross chain oracle and cross chain perps that exists on Solana. And my hunch is that they're going to get integrated into tensor. So.
00:39:49.774 - 00:39:52.114, Speaker A: All right, all right. Get out of here, Dalton.
00:39:54.334 - 00:40:08.974, Speaker B: That's a good assumption, actually. Yeah, I think it's going to be really difficult. Like, for example, a lot of the users that, that trade, like, the markets in Vietnam. And I know this specifically because I've just.
00:40:09.014 - 00:40:09.302, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:40:09.318 - 00:40:27.194, Speaker B: I've just been involved in, like, the vietnamese, like, trading community. You've seen. Yeah, they small. They trade small size. You know, like, we're talking, like you said, $50 on some scenarios, like, you know, BNB chain fees or, like, you know, $0.00.01, you know, us, you know, Penny. Right.
00:40:27.194 - 00:40:43.116, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I mean, without, like, these layer twos or, like, Solana, for example, it's going to be really difficult to bring those new market participants in because they're not going to trade, you know, $30 gas fee or $70 gas fee on ETH, it's just not going to happen.
00:40:43.260 - 00:41:00.056, Speaker C: Well, and I paid. I paid $7 gas fees on arbitram, and I was like, dude, what the fuck? Like, I don't want to pay $7, dude. Like, that. It was. It was ridiculous. And I was like, okay, this is, this is stupid now. Like, yes, $7 is what we should be paying on ETH mainnet, but that's not the case.
00:41:00.056 - 00:41:32.834, Speaker C: Right? And so this is the only. And blast the blast news saying, like, okay, institutional level liquidity for nfts. How are institutions going to get institutional level liquidity through perps. That's going to be how they do it. Right? And now if we're talking perps, like, maybe institutions don't care about paying gas fees, but for retail, we do. And so this is where I think that there is an opportunity to see cross chain perps actually be a thing that people use, because gas fees on Solana are not even pennies. Right? Like, I think that that.
00:41:32.834 - 00:41:54.982, Speaker C: And we're starting to see this infrastructure. We lacked infrastructure before. We are starting to see that infrastructure happen. Like phantom wallet, instant cross chain swaps. I just use it for the first time today, and I was like, holy shit, that was easy, right? And so to take advantage of some of these infrastructural plays, plays that are starting to happen, I think it's. I don't know. I.
00:41:54.982 - 00:42:07.474, Speaker C: I'm a soul, maxi, and I'm bullish on it, so that's why I'm. I'm saying this. But I can also see that, like, like you said, somebody doesn't want to pay $7 gas fees to put through a dollar 50 transaction.
00:42:07.894 - 00:42:21.144, Speaker A: Are there any changes? Oh, go ahead. I was going to ask you, are there any chains in particular that you see the asian community, like, transacting on a ton? Is it bsc or are they also.
00:42:21.184 - 00:42:48.586, Speaker B: Yeah, it still is. Like, arbitrarium is still not that popular here. Like, I know, vietnamese, Vietnam specifically. It's, like, big on BNB chain. Maybe because finance came in, you know, early on, you know, through the exchange, and. And it was the cheapest chain, you know, to transact on, and it relatively reliable, actually. So I think BNB chain, a lot of times, it's kind of slept on, but, like, a lot of these Southeast Asia communities, like, they use it.
00:42:48.586 - 00:43:20.824, Speaker B: And so I think, you know, maybe nfts started blowing up on there, maybe especially with, like, sort of, like, the new regime change of finance. That's going to be interesting. But I think, you know, if Solana begin, you know, becomes more prominent here and there, by the way, there's. There's some Solana hacker houses here in Singapore, so they're trying to, like, make moves here, then it's possible they could kind of, like, take the top spot there. So, yeah, I mean, it's sort of, like, up for the taking. You know, whoever's got the cheapest chain, the best, easiest to use. But Solana, yeah, definitely.
00:43:20.824 - 00:43:22.772, Speaker B: I like it a lot. So I'm.
00:43:22.828 - 00:43:36.262, Speaker A: Dude, you're. You're singing music into Dalton's ears right now. Look, at that grin, ear to ear grin. Like, it's so. It's funny. I actually. My first, like, defi trade was on BNB chain.
00:43:36.262 - 00:43:52.626, Speaker A: And I kind of always viewed BNB chain. No offense to the builders over there. It's been a while since I've checked any, like, actual protocols out. But like, dude, shitcoin season in like, 2021, 2022 was popping on BNB chain.
00:43:52.770 - 00:43:56.014, Speaker C: I've never put. I've never put through a transaction on BNB.
00:43:56.434 - 00:44:17.944, Speaker A: It's like, it's so chilly. Insanely. Yeah, it was like, definitely eye opening. When I started transacting on Ethan, I was like, I'm paying how much? And then I found myself just pushing through like 200 $300 gas fees because I was trying to trade on some fucking token.
00:44:18.104 - 00:44:33.432, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's the name of the game. So we'll pivot here a little bit. We were talking about real world assets earlier, and then I brought this up. I said, real estate perps. Right, right. Parcel is a team. They just so happen to build on Solana.
00:44:33.432 - 00:44:51.448, Speaker C: I don't know why. I'm just kidding. But they, they build on Solana. They've been around for about two years now. Um, and they recently, I believe, three weeks ago, put out their v three. Um, I do have some, um. Let me see, share this tab instead.
00:44:51.448 - 00:45:35.552, Speaker C: So this is actually, um, stats from their recent v three. So as you can see, 542 users, there's been 21.5k transactions. And if you look at their v two, their v two, they had almost 2500 cumulative trailer traders over there. So basically what this is, is a remove this. So basically what this is, is real estate perps. They take the median, I don't know if it's the median square foot square footage price per market that they have.
00:45:35.552 - 00:46:03.220, Speaker C: I think they have six markets open right now. They're going to have 13 by the. I think by Q two of next year. And so they're going to start pushing markets and their international markets as well. Um, and I think it, it becomes a really interesting conversation because normally we are sitting here trading jpegs and we're like, NFT perps. And like, that makes sense to us because we're all wanting to short or long pudgy penguins or Azuki or D gods or whatever. Like, that makes sense to us.
00:46:03.220 - 00:47:05.790, Speaker C: Right? But if we're talking about the real world and real world assets to be able to have spot or like, long or short exposure to certain real estate markets. Now think about this. In the real world, right? So say you are new York apartment, right? And you're renting your New York apartment, right? And you are naturally short apartments in New York because you don't want price to go up. Like if price goes up, you're fucked, right? And they're, they're going to have to pay more. Now what if you went to parcel and you said, I'm going to take a leveraged long on New York real estate and if it does go up, I'm going to make money and then I can close out my long. And then when my landlord comes in like, hey, by the way, we're raising your rent and you're like, fuck you. I've been long for twelve months and here's my leverage long on my real estate perks and you can take that and shove it and I'm like, damn, that's pretty badass, dude.
00:47:05.790 - 00:47:14.044, Speaker C: Like, I just think that such a unique use case that we have never seen in blockchain. Right?
00:47:15.384 - 00:47:17.712, Speaker A: Yeah. So I was actually thinking about.
00:47:17.768 - 00:47:18.608, Speaker B: I love it.
00:47:18.776 - 00:47:20.124, Speaker C: Yeah, it's cool.
00:47:20.504 - 00:47:32.600, Speaker A: Like, do you guys remember the big short, the movie, and obviously the zero eight crash when it actually happened? Yeah. My mom was a real estate agent, so my household was heavily affected by that, that crash.
00:47:32.712 - 00:47:35.004, Speaker C: I was like, I was twelve, but.
00:47:35.344 - 00:48:04.282, Speaker A: I just remember it was like, and we're going to be eating at home every single day. But it was one of those things. I'm like, how could I, Jen, as like a retail person that's not an accredited investor, like have exposure to things like this? And now it sounds like with like parcel, it's like if I wanted to go short the real estate market, I totally could. And just that barrier to entry is kind of wild to think about that that exists.
00:48:04.468 - 00:48:08.954, Speaker C: Yeah. Titan, how you feel about it?
00:48:11.214 - 00:48:40.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, essentially it's, it's kind of going back to what I was saying about rwas in general, which is like access. Right. You know, we're just lowering the barrier to entry for people to be able to like participate in these markets. So like parcel, like what they're doing is saying, hey, like, you can, you have access now. You can long short and trade markets, whereas like before, like you couldn't, you didn't have the ability to hedge. So now we can. So I think it's cool.
00:48:40.354 - 00:48:52.394, Speaker B: I think it's much needed. And then on top of that, I'm sure like people will find ways to, you know, build on top of the yield and build protocols on top of that and, you know, kind of keep going. So I like it a lot.
00:48:52.514 - 00:49:07.874, Speaker C: Yeah. No, I think it's cool. And the fact that they have 1.1 million in TVL and they have 100 hundred over 150k in open interest, I might do. That's badass, dude. Like that. That's actual volume going through something that is not NFT related at all.
00:49:07.874 - 00:49:09.982, Speaker C: If you wanted to get good.
00:49:10.118 - 00:49:11.994, Speaker A: Where does the TVL come from?
00:49:13.694 - 00:49:14.714, Speaker C: Give me a second.
00:49:15.374 - 00:49:19.794, Speaker A: Is that based off of, like, the open assets that they have currently?
00:49:21.054 - 00:49:42.554, Speaker C: I know that they have an NFt. I don't know if, like, there's like, staked nFts to have, like, leverage or something like that. Like, maybe that could be it. I'll have to look into it again. I'm going to have another conversation with the team because those guys were. Dude, I had a great time chatting with them and I know that they have their NFT. It's called Parcel Homeowners association.
00:49:42.554 - 00:50:05.858, Speaker C: And they're like little houses of, like, there's like, New York houses, La houses and Miami houses. So I don't know. Look, we've seen other perfect platforms do airdrops. I don't know. Like, I think it's worth kind of messing around with this, especially if you want some exposure to RWAs. The. The NFts are super cheap.
00:50:05.858 - 00:50:23.494, Speaker C: They're at like 1.8 or two or two soul. So it's like, might as well like snag a few of them. I don't know this. I don't have any. I minted three of them, like 18 months ago, and I sold them for a soul each and that was that. So just something.
00:50:23.494 - 00:50:26.510, Speaker C: Some war daddy alpha. Okay, just take it.
00:50:26.622 - 00:50:33.518, Speaker A: Yes, but none of this is financial advice. We are just talking about what's happening in the market. This is all educational.
00:50:33.646 - 00:50:36.514, Speaker C: It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
00:50:37.774 - 00:50:38.830, Speaker A: Look at Titan.
00:50:38.942 - 00:50:39.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:40.174 - 00:51:01.774, Speaker A: All right. I mean, we're just about to approach the end, but Titan, yeah, it's a meme. But before we do Titan, I know you and Chris from Snow Genesis put together this awesome landscape, I think. How often do you guys do this? Like quarterly? I feel like this gets updated pretty frequently.
00:51:03.434 - 00:51:19.862, Speaker B: I'd say probably every, I don't know, three to five months or so. Maybe like every three months or so. Actually, we're dropping the three within the next few days here before art basel. So stay tuned.
00:51:19.998 - 00:51:56.522, Speaker A: Let's go. I'm looking forward to it. I particularly love these landscapes on the NFT five side of things because I think one, the NFT finance vertical, does not have nearly as much attention or traction as it should, considering how powerful it is. And two, it's incredible how much money has been transacted across NFT finance protocols. And when you kind of look at it in, like, that 30,000 foot view, there's only a handful of builders here. It's not a massive, massive category or vertical, which is kind of crazy to me.
00:51:56.658 - 00:52:12.818, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think that that is spot on. Like, we have so many different builders that are. That are attacking different problems that we're seeing in the space now. If only they could deal with gas prices. But that's besides the point. But I think it is. It's a huge headache for these guys.
00:52:12.818 - 00:52:57.294, Speaker C: Right? Like, it's hard to say. Like, hey, you can make 4%, but you're going to have to pay $35 gas fee. Now, I hope that we can see some type of composability or even if it's wrapped, NFTs going to blast or something like that. And I know I have spoke with a few builders that have spoken with blast and they said that the conversations have all been positive. I haven't heard of any builder been turned away at this point. So, like, obviously we're talking about blast being a multisig and they don't even have an l two yet. So, like, we'll see what happens, like, when the l two is actually here, but it seems like they're being pretty inviting towards builders that are on ETH mainnet or within the NFT five space going over to blast.
00:52:57.294 - 00:52:58.962, Speaker C: So we'll see what happens there.
00:52:59.078 - 00:53:22.214, Speaker A: I mean, that's so good to hear because I think, like, when we all saw blast come out and saw that, obviously, you know, the next product that's coming is NFT perps on blast. I think there was a lot of hesitation of, like, you know, blur traditionally and historically has been a black box for builders. And it's like, are we going to see that same type of approach with blast? But good to know. Titan, have you spoken with the blast team?
00:53:22.874 - 00:53:58.564, Speaker B: No, actually, blur and blast teams are a bit difficult to get a hold of. I guess it's weird because they don't really build around, like, any of the other NFT five protocols. I think it's because they have these sort of, like, you know, in a sense, walled gardens. Their. Their focus, I guess, is just on, like, what they build. And I've gotten the same feedback from other people as well, saying, like, they don't necessarily kind of build or let other people build on top of what they have. Maybe that's just what they're doing.
00:53:58.564 - 00:54:05.156, Speaker B: For right now. Well, maybe we'll see a change with blast. But, yeah, I haven't really spoke to them, to be honest.
00:54:05.340 - 00:54:31.764, Speaker C: It seems like the kind of feedback I was getting from teams. So I've spoken with three or four teams that have spoken with the blur and blast teams, and the general consensus is that blast is building an ethel two. And there's so much money to be had within the ETH l two space that they aren't worried about these tiny, tiny little gains. Right? They're. They're. They're trying to. To build an actual ETH l two here.
00:54:31.764 - 00:54:43.558, Speaker C: They don't care if somebody takes a small win. Right? They're like, all right, cool, we're go. We're gonna. We're gonna have bigger fist to fry at this point. We'll see what happens. So, hopefully, because I have the same fear, right. Like, they.
00:54:43.558 - 00:54:55.774, Speaker C: They're probably going to point guns at arbitrum and optimism. They're going to be like, hey, no, we. We are the new guy in town and we're going to. We're going to rob everybody of liquidity. Um, but we'll see what happens.
00:54:56.194 - 00:55:19.210, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, one, again, really glad that you were able to get that little bit of insight from some of the builders. And two, really excited to see what folks end up doing. Um, I think blast is going to be the Degen chain. Like, I'm starting now that, like, I've been red pilled on Solana, I'm starting to kind of see it, like, next, I need to, like, look into a backs a little bit more because I'm starting.
00:55:19.362 - 00:55:20.294, Speaker C: I do, too.
00:55:20.674 - 00:55:42.662, Speaker A: Yeah. Because there's a lot of, like, tradfi going on to Avax. And so I think it's like, if a vaccine is for tradfi and Solana is a little bit more for a consumer, and then ETH is more, I don't know, the. The OGd gen chain and then all the l two s built on top of it. Like, I think every chain is going to have its place and then we end up in that multi chain world.
00:55:42.838 - 00:55:54.894, Speaker C: Yeah, well, yeah, we're getting right here to the end of the show. Titan, thank you so much for hopping on today. Like, that was so much fun getting to chat with you and. And I think that this is the first time of many that we're going to have you on the show.
00:55:54.934 - 00:55:55.994, Speaker B: So thank you.
00:55:57.134 - 00:56:00.434, Speaker A: Yeah, man. Oh, does he see us?
00:56:00.814 - 00:56:01.970, Speaker C: I don't think so.
00:56:02.142 - 00:56:23.730, Speaker A: Oh, no. All right, well, we'll have to. We'll get them in the DM's. But, guys, thanks for tuning in this week. Next week, we have a really, really exciting show for you. We have three special guests joining us to basically look at NFTs all across 2023, all of the NFT five stuff that's also happened in 2023.
00:56:23.802 - 00:56:27.986, Speaker C: So are you going to force us to stay to an hour or can we riff on that one?
00:56:28.090 - 00:56:29.266, Speaker A: No, we can riff on that.
00:56:29.330 - 00:56:35.474, Speaker C: There we go. Cool. All right. I'm happy with that answer.
00:56:35.594 - 00:56:49.894, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is a. It's going to be a stacked episode, I think. I'm really excited. Like, we're starting to prep show notes early. Don't want to fuck this one up. We're not trying to fuck around and find out on this. On this next episode.
00:56:50.234 - 00:56:55.998, Speaker C: Perfect. Well, thank you again. You've done so much to have the show notes ready and stuff like that, so I appreciate it.
00:56:56.106 - 00:57:01.654, Speaker A: Of course, homie. All right, guys, well, you have a good rest of your week, and we'll see you next week.
00:57:01.814 - 00:57:03.094, Speaker C: See ya. Bye.
