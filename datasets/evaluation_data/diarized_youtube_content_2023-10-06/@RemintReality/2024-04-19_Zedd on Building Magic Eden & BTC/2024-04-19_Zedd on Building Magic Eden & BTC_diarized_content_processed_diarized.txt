00:00:00.320 - 00:00:34.726, Speaker A: Hey, guys, it's Jen and it's Dalton. And we are so excited to be bringing remint reality to IRL in partnership with Shiller. So today we actually have a pretty fun conversation. I think there has been one brand that I have seen everywhere, not only here at NFT NYC, but also on the timeline. So, without further ado, I'm really excited to introduce Zed, one of the co founders of Magic Eden. How are you?
00:00:34.790 - 00:00:35.038, Speaker B: Good.
00:00:35.086 - 00:00:35.758, Speaker C: How are you guys?
00:00:35.846 - 00:00:36.254, Speaker B: Good, bro.
00:00:36.294 - 00:00:36.910, Speaker D: Nice to see you.
00:00:36.942 - 00:00:38.622, Speaker C: Yeah, likewise. Thank you so much for having me.
00:00:38.678 - 00:00:42.150, Speaker A: Of course. Are you surviving after all of the lovely magic Eden?
00:00:42.182 - 00:00:48.510, Speaker C: I feel like my voice is, like, wrecked right now. Like, all raspy after the last couple of days screaming on a yacht.
00:00:48.582 - 00:00:51.486, Speaker D: Bro, I'm so sad that I missed the yacht party. I really am.
00:00:51.550 - 00:00:57.102, Speaker C: You kind of just missed a very shaky, dangerous boat experience.
00:00:57.278 - 00:01:03.416, Speaker D: Okay. I actually did see a video on Twitter. Was that the actual, like, getting on the boat, or was it. Did anybody see that?
00:01:03.440 - 00:01:04.136, Speaker C: No, I didn't see that.
00:01:04.160 - 00:01:05.240, Speaker D: Okay, well, we'll have to check.
00:01:05.272 - 00:01:05.416, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:01:05.440 - 00:01:07.004, Speaker C: It was probably. It's probably true.
00:01:09.144 - 00:01:10.016, Speaker D: That's epic.
00:01:10.120 - 00:01:19.296, Speaker A: Well, Zed, before we, like, dig in, I would love it if you could give us some of your background and just your history in the space, and then we'll dig into magic Eden.
00:01:19.360 - 00:01:43.048, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good. So I got into crypto in 2017. Everyone kind of comes in at some cycle, right? Over the years. Mine was the Ico 2017 cycle. I had a friend who was working at Coinbase, and he was telling me all about bitcoin, and I was like, oh, my God, this shit's crazy. I need to do something about this. So started buying crypto in 2017, and then a couple of years later, felt like I just really wanted to work in the space.
00:01:43.048 - 00:02:06.636, Speaker C: Just got so interested in it. And I studied finance. I always looked at it from a finance perspective, and I thought, man, if you could have a bunch of these assets on chain, that's unbelievable. So I ended up joining DYDX. That was my first experience into crypto, and I joined them back in. This was beginning of 2018. So let me just set the scene.
00:02:06.636 - 00:02:30.768, Speaker C: Imagine the world where there was Defi was not a term, right? It was sort of post icos. People were trying to figure out what to do with these tokens. And then there was probably about five teams building, like, protocol, like, financial protocols. It was like makerdao, dydX, compound, aave. Oh, you know what it was like, Eos.
00:02:30.856 - 00:02:33.744, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:33.864 - 00:02:35.368, Speaker C: I even had some eos back then.
00:02:35.456 - 00:02:36.480, Speaker A: Even ripple.
00:02:36.632 - 00:02:39.640, Speaker C: Ripple, amise. Go, that was like a weird era, you know?
00:02:39.672 - 00:02:40.168, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:40.296 - 00:03:14.148, Speaker C: And I joined them because the founder, Antonio, he was looking for like a right hand to run, like, a lot of the business stuff because he was an engineer and I was like, I could do that. My background, I was at Bain and company doing consulting. So I can do something here. Hopefully I can contribute something. So I joined them, spent three years there, built a lot of the early, a lot of the infrastructure, which now is a big perpetual trading product. But back then we did all kinds of things. We did like margin tokens, margin trading.
00:03:14.196 - 00:03:16.468, Speaker A: We did all the Djen stuff.
00:03:16.516 - 00:03:17.548, Speaker C: Yeah, all this stuff.
00:03:17.596 - 00:03:18.184, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:18.604 - 00:03:25.104, Speaker C: So it's crazy to see how far Defi has come since then, because back then we used to celebrate, you know, 30 users or something.
00:03:25.644 - 00:03:28.436, Speaker A: You're like, we have 30,000 active users today.
00:03:28.500 - 00:03:56.904, Speaker C: $30,000 is trading on the platform. This is insane. Like, who would do this, right? And so anyway, that was like three years and amazing journey because I learned a lot, met a lot of the ogs who were building a defi, all this kind of stuff. And then after that, I wanted to just experience something at scale and also work closer to product. So I had an opportunity to join the product team at Coinbase. So I spent about a year, year and a half building out the institutional trading experience.
00:03:57.284 - 00:03:58.820, Speaker D: So is this like Coinbase pro?
00:03:58.972 - 00:04:01.804, Speaker C: This is a coinbase. What's called Coinbase prime today?
00:04:01.884 - 00:04:02.268, Speaker D: Okay.
00:04:02.316 - 00:04:06.600, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. So it's like, they're like four institutional product.
00:04:06.672 - 00:04:07.112, Speaker B: Was it.
00:04:07.168 - 00:04:09.160, Speaker D: What was the one? It used to be called? Gdax.
00:04:09.192 - 00:04:18.296, Speaker C: Gdax, yeah. So basically, Coinbase had this GDAX thing and then it became Coinbase pro. Then they were like, oh, we need to serve these other, like, higher.
00:04:18.400 - 00:04:19.144, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:04:19.304 - 00:04:21.520, Speaker A: I haven't even seen Coinbase prime.
00:04:21.592 - 00:04:37.922, Speaker C: No, it's for, like, hedge funds and asset managers and like, tradfi, basically. And, yeah, I joined them because I was like, I like building trading stuff and if I can do it at scale. And back then, it was kind of like the first institutional wave, right?
00:04:37.978 - 00:04:38.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:38.306 - 00:05:09.074, Speaker C: It was like Elon was buying bitcoin and like Saylor. Michael Saylor was buying bitcoin. And that was all insane to see. Sort of pretty firsthand. And so anyway, I was building the trading products there and then that was around the time that me and my co founders were basically degenerating on a bunch of things on the outside, as we all do. And I can go into that story, too, but that's sort of how we got together and eventually became magic eden. But we were kind of just like users ourselves.
00:05:09.194 - 00:05:23.394, Speaker D: Right, bro, that's insane to kind of hear even just going back to those days. Right. I also got in in 2017, early 2017, and just seeing kind of these verticals that exist now that didn't exist back then.
00:05:23.434 - 00:05:25.058, Speaker C: I mean, stable coins didn't exist back then.
00:05:25.106 - 00:05:25.802, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:05:25.938 - 00:05:26.594, Speaker C: Yeah, it was crazy.
00:05:26.634 - 00:05:53.270, Speaker D: Well, and it's the way that I kind of try to explain it nowadays is like, we have all these different verticals, right? So you have, like, crypto, like the big daddies. You have, like, bitcoin, solana ETH, and then you have, like, the ETH l two s and all of that, like, fragmentation that's going on there. But then on top of that, you have nfts. You have nft fi. You have defi. Like, you have all these different verticals that all pump at different times, which, back in the day, we didn't have that. It was like you had the big daddy season, then you had all season.
00:05:53.342 - 00:05:53.966, Speaker C: Yeah, all season.
00:05:54.030 - 00:05:55.382, Speaker A: And that was crashes.
00:05:55.478 - 00:06:09.902, Speaker D: And then. And then nothing would happen for two years. Yeah, and then, like, all defy summer. Yeah, and then the wave came and then the Nft wave came and then the Nft five wave came. And now I'm just like, you have so many, like, rotator season is actually. It's not a meme.
00:06:09.958 - 00:06:16.726, Speaker C: Like, it's actually very right now where. Yeah, probably. I don't know if you guys feel it, too, but it's like, it cannot focus on everything that's going on.
00:06:16.870 - 00:06:17.222, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:17.278 - 00:06:18.126, Speaker D: We talk about it all the time.
00:06:18.150 - 00:06:42.454, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like base season, sole, meme, coins, ordinals, last. Yeah, it's just like back then there was none of that. Right, exactly. It's bitcoin or alt season, and that's it. And now it's an amazing problem to have right. In the industry because it was hard to see it back then. When we were building sort of that first initial wave of defi protocols, we didn't know what it would become.
00:06:42.454 - 00:06:55.142, Speaker C: And it's funny now, it's like, you know, die, make a dow, die wasn't around. Like, it was just really, really different. So you couldn't really do much. But now it's actually amazing to see the flourishing of all these little, like, small pockets of activity.
00:06:55.238 - 00:06:55.686, Speaker D: Right.
00:06:55.790 - 00:07:13.546, Speaker A: We one of the. In one of, like, the panels that we did, someone had mentioned, like, we finally. That they finally feel like crypto is at a point where we're going to have a massive shift because all of this infrastructure that wasn't there in 2018 is now in place. Do you feel like, do you have the same sentiment?
00:07:13.630 - 00:07:50.076, Speaker C: I think so. I think so. I still think it'll continue to go in waves and cycles and things, and we feel pretty strongly, like, with high conviction around this, obviously, because we're building an NFT marketplace. But we still think that NFTs are kind of a consumer moment for crypto. And it'll take some time to manifest in a bunch of different ways. Like, it may not manifest in just the pure PFP way that everyone thought, but we have high conviction around it because nfts as a standard can birth a lot of different types of assets. And we just want to be that discovery layer, marketplace transaction layer for all of that.
00:07:50.076 - 00:07:54.660, Speaker C: So we have high conviction about that. But how it's going to play out, it's very, very hard to say, of course.
00:07:54.852 - 00:08:13.782, Speaker D: Take us back to September 2021. So you guys launch ethnfts at this point. Like, we were talking about these different verticals, right? So ETH nfTs, we're having a season. People are paying attention. People are playing crazy amounts of money for cartoon jpegs and things like that. You guys decide to launch on Solana?
00:08:13.878 - 00:08:14.238, Speaker B: Yep.
00:08:14.286 - 00:08:26.606, Speaker D: Now take us back to the early Solana days. Like, obviously people, the early Solana Degens, remember degenerate ape Academy, the paper handed bitch tax for d gods, things like that? Like those kind of, like, we get.
00:08:26.630 - 00:08:27.742, Speaker C: Like, waves of nostalgia.
00:08:27.798 - 00:08:39.440, Speaker D: Yeah, bro. It was fun back then. It was just like, on, like, it was like the anti ETH NFt kind of movement. Can you take us back to the early days and kind of what you saw? Why did you launch on Solana?
00:08:39.542 - 00:08:39.820, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:39.852 - 00:09:31.628, Speaker C: Okay, so this goes way back to, I think, 2019, when I was at DYDX, and I got to know one of the folks on the Solana team, dom, he's no longer at Solana, but back. He was instrumental, I think, in a lot of the growth of the ecosystem. And we got to know each other at one of the conferences, and he was like, hey, Solana's having one of their first events in San Francisco. Do you want to come talk on a panel about Defi? So that was my first sort of introduction to the ecosystem. Met Anatoly and met some of the early team, and I was like, oh, it's interesting because these guys seem really legit. It's not like some of these altcoin teams from back in 2017 where you were like, what are you doing? But these guys seemed really legit. And I always kind of felt, like, cool if they could pull off this technically.
00:09:31.628 - 00:09:35.404, Speaker C: Like, it would be very, very interesting to build on that. And I was thinking from a DYDX.
00:09:35.444 - 00:09:36.980, Speaker D: Perspective, I was like, right, of course.
00:09:37.052 - 00:09:40.124, Speaker C: Performant pro trading, perpetuals trading, all this kind of stuff.
00:09:40.164 - 00:09:40.796, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:40.980 - 00:10:11.934, Speaker C: So then fast forward to 2021. You know, ETH entities were ripping. Defi was kind of just getting started on Solana. A lot of teams were getting funded, right? And one of the big catalysts that I saw was that some of the early teams that I got to know building on DeFi, on Ethereum, a couple of them had moved and started building on Solana. And these were people I trusted and, like, knew well. And I was like, yo, why? Like, why are you guys doing that? Like, what's going on here? Yeah, this is not just like a fad.
00:10:12.014 - 00:10:13.474, Speaker A: You're like, this is a signal.
00:10:13.774 - 00:10:25.542, Speaker C: Exactly. It's like you guys are, like, actually moving and building a company here, and. Which is very contrarian at the time because it was like, back then. Yeah, EVM was, you know, major. It was the only.
00:10:25.598 - 00:10:26.334, Speaker D: Yeah, it was their thing.
00:10:26.374 - 00:10:26.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:27.062 - 00:10:48.702, Speaker C: So then, okay, so that was happening. That was the background. And then myself and my co founders, we. We started like, we were like, yield farming and trading and all these different things on Solana on a bunch of different chains. And it was just fun. Like the. I think a lot of what people are experiencing, or have been experiencing the last six months with meme coins, like, oh, you can do this.
00:10:48.702 - 00:10:50.760, Speaker C: And it's just really fast. And it's like, really?
00:10:50.832 - 00:10:51.528, Speaker D: No gas fees.
00:10:51.576 - 00:11:05.536, Speaker C: Yeah, no gas fees. It's cheap. It's like, whoa. I really felt that at the time, you know, because trading ethnfts was pretty brutal back then, and still brutal. Still. Still brutal. And being able to do that on Solana was like, wow, this is crazy.
00:11:05.536 - 00:11:34.854, Speaker C: There's something here. So then we weren't setting out to just start a Solana company. That was not actually what we were trying to do at the time. It was kind of just like, hey, we really like nfts as a. As a space and a category. What can we do? Is there something we can do here that's different? And that led us down the path of, like, okay, if there's something technically different we can build on Solana that has different properties just because the chain is different, that there's enough legs there that maybe we can make that. Make something out of that.
00:11:34.934 - 00:11:35.534, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:35.694 - 00:12:06.478, Speaker C: And we thought we were actually too late because Solana. Yeah, because it sounds crazy to say that, but because ethnicities had the, you know, was already like, in the midst of the run Solana nfTs, there were some really crazy mints. Like, DJ and Ape Academy had already happened. Solana monkey business had already happened. SMB was SMBs. All these pretty good collections had already gone out, and there was already three or four established, quote, unquote, established marketplaces on Solana. So we thought, maybe we're too late.
00:12:06.478 - 00:12:34.560, Speaker C: But in the end, we decided to go for it, which I'm really glad we did. And we got a little, like, group on discord together. It's like a little beta group of, like, 20 people, of people we'd met in the community who were, like, degenering alongside us, and we were like, hey, we're building this thing. Can you guys, like, test it out? The four of us got together over, like, two weeks, just, like, hacking nights, weekends, just any spare time that we had, and we put it out there and then. Yeah, the rest is kind of history.
00:12:34.672 - 00:12:35.120, Speaker D: Insane.
00:12:35.192 - 00:12:42.104, Speaker C: But it was insane, chaotic time. I mean, if you were there. Yeah, it was mental.
00:12:42.184 - 00:13:12.960, Speaker D: Well, and so my question here, because this is obviously a trend that you guys have kind of followed throughout the through line of magic Eden, building on ecosystems with very little infrastructure. This is something that we're seeing right now with ordinals, and we're obviously going to get into that pivot. But I want to kind of ask, what were the early experiences over there of building on Solana with very little infrastructure? And are there similarities now that you're seeing to the early Solana NFT ecosystem system, to the ordinals ecosystem that you guys are building in today?
00:13:13.032 - 00:13:16.704, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely a massive, massive challenge.
00:13:16.744 - 00:13:16.896, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:16.920 - 00:13:44.104, Speaker C: On Solana back then, there was not a way to denote a collection on chain, which seems crazy. So, like, I'll give you a tangible example of what that means. If, like, SMBs, for example, for us, as a marketplace, to list the collection, we had to go ask SMBs to give us a. A list of hashes, right. Which would then upload and then display it. There was no way to say, like, these 10,000 things belong to this collection.
00:13:44.224 - 00:13:45.800, Speaker A: You couldn't just put in a contract.
00:13:45.952 - 00:13:46.376, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:46.440 - 00:13:52.232, Speaker C: You can't, like, index it like you normally can now, like, on chain. It just wasn't built yet.
00:13:52.328 - 00:13:52.584, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:52.624 - 00:13:55.824, Speaker C: It was crazy minting. There was no minting infrastructure.
00:13:55.864 - 00:13:58.136, Speaker D: It was Metaplex came out, and that was like, the big.
00:13:58.240 - 00:13:59.284, Speaker C: That was a huge.
00:13:59.904 - 00:14:01.576, Speaker D: And Ape Academy was the first minute.
00:14:01.600 - 00:14:01.760, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:01.792 - 00:14:06.584, Speaker C: But before that, it was just dudes in discord saying, like, yo, yo, I'll be your dev.
00:14:08.764 - 00:14:09.864, Speaker D: I'll be your dev.
00:14:10.444 - 00:14:12.180, Speaker C: You never want to talk to that guy.
00:14:12.252 - 00:14:14.544, Speaker A: I think I just grew, like, three gray hairs.
00:14:14.964 - 00:14:15.820, Speaker C: Look at my gray hair.
00:14:15.852 - 00:14:16.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:16.372 - 00:14:52.970, Speaker C: It's like me talking to people who are asking me to be their dev. And, yeah, it was that kind of time. So that was actually one of the. One of the rationales for us building a launch pad, because so many creators we talked to were like, yo, yo, like, we want to launch something. We don't exactly know how to use this metaplex stuff, even though it was good technology, but they couldn't actually productize it, and they didn't want to use a random dev on discord. So we were like, okay, cool. We can build, like, this thing that connects the smart contracts to actual minting experience that you can give to your users.
00:14:52.970 - 00:14:56.186, Speaker C: So we were trying to solve that problem for creator. That's how launchpad came about.
00:14:56.250 - 00:14:56.838, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:14:56.946 - 00:14:59.214, Speaker C: It was birthed because there was just a lack of.
00:14:59.334 - 00:15:00.134, Speaker A: There's a need.
00:15:00.254 - 00:15:00.766, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:00.870 - 00:15:01.278, Speaker B: Tooling.
00:15:01.326 - 00:15:06.594, Speaker C: And that ended up being an amazing, huge product for us alongside the marketplace.
00:15:07.374 - 00:15:17.078, Speaker D: Insane, dude. And, like, the early. I remember this, like, I was such a big user, and I was just, like, I was consistently using y'all's marketplace, and, like, I was an everyday user.
00:15:17.166 - 00:15:17.438, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:17.486 - 00:15:29.904, Speaker D: And, like, I want to touch on a. The opportunity to go cross chain presented itself. We're in, like, the. The depths of the bear market, and you guys decide to go over to ETH.
00:15:29.984 - 00:15:30.176, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:30.200 - 00:16:09.908, Speaker D: And, like, this was a very difficult decision, I'm sure, internally, because, like, you guys had such a sparkling reputation within the Solana community, and you kind of dampened that with going over to ETH, and people were like, dude, like, frank leaves magic, Eden leaves. Like, how does that kind of sit with you? And, like, I'm more so interested in, like, obviously, you had tensor come in as well, and, like, that's. That's a great team that has, like, has proven track record. Now, like, was the move because you saw more potential on ETH, or was this also a move that you're like, fuck, we're losing some market share from. From tensor. Like, I kind of want to hear the story on why ETH nfts?
00:16:09.996 - 00:16:41.544, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's a really good question. And, like, yeah, I haven't really been asked it this way, so we can definitely, like, we can, like, unpack it. It's like, there's a lot in there, right? I think so fundamentally, I think the first thing is that we always felt like nfts would not just nfts, actually, crypto would just be multi chain. We always felt that way. And from the very, very early days, when maybe three or four months into magic Eden, we always said to ourselves, like, hey, the earliest opportunity we can get to ETH, we got to go do that. That's the home. That's the cultural home of nfts.
00:16:41.544 - 00:17:26.751, Speaker C: There weren't really any other chains, really, with active ecosystems. So we always thought, like, we got to go to ETH as well at some point. So we always believed that. And with the whole, one thing I do regret about, like, how we actually went multichain, and this is like a, yeah, hindsight's 2020, you know, it's, like, easy to say now, but I really regret sort of the comms of how we communicated it to the community, because we were. Yeah, at the time, we were definitely sort of like the. The rising star of Solana, all this kind of stuff, which, you know, we were very, like, humbled to be in that position. And us moving multichain was not actually about abandoning Sol, but it really came off like that because I think we did not create the intentional comms that.
00:17:26.767 - 00:17:30.927, Speaker A: Were necessary of, like, multi chain is always a part of our grand vision.
00:17:30.975 - 00:17:47.800, Speaker C: Exactly. Me as a founder, or us as co founders, communicating that, actively laying that out, like, why that's in our vision, why that's actually beneficial for the Solana ecosystem, too, because we'll go out, pull in a bunch of users who then will come and use all our multichain suite, which obviously includes Solana.
00:17:47.872 - 00:17:48.152, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:48.208 - 00:18:08.472, Speaker C: Yeah, we want to grow everything, but that we did not communicate that. And I think that's a really big lesson for me now, as a leader in the company, in the space, it's like, you need to actually really over articulate a lot of these things internally in the company, so the company gets it, but also to the community. So the community gets it and understands.
00:18:08.528 - 00:18:09.124, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:10.264 - 00:18:52.162, Speaker C: And that, I think, coupled with the fact that all of this happened post FTX, which that timing was not at all related, we were building a lot of this EVM stuff even before the FTX stuff happened. But when it came out like that with bad comms, everyone was kind of just like, yo, you guys are just abandoning shit at the worst possible time. And that's something I do really, really regret quite a lot, because we, as a team, are not the kind of team that is like that. You know, we're like, really long term people. Right? Like people. Over the years of Magic Eden, we could have sold the company a couple of times because people were interested, so we could have, like, gone away and made a bag. But, like, that's not what we're about.
00:18:52.162 - 00:18:56.778, Speaker C: We're here because we want to grind and we want. We really believe in making this really big.
00:18:56.866 - 00:18:57.494, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:57.804 - 00:19:21.596, Speaker C: But that was like something we didn't know how to communicate at the time. And I really regret that, actually, because then it sort of took probably about a twelve month period of maybe even longer for us to rebuild that reputation. Yeah, I think we're kind of. It's getting better now, and people are starting to see that. Yo, these like, mag Heaton is. They're like hardcore builders, you know, like, they'll go out there and like, do some really hard, crazy stuff. That's what I want to be known for.
00:19:21.596 - 00:19:26.234, Speaker C: That's what I want the team to be known for, because that's. That's who we are, actually. We're not shying away from things that are hard.
00:19:26.354 - 00:19:57.506, Speaker A: It's interesting because, like, it's funny, I was red pilled into Solana much later, thanks to this one. I also was red pilled into nfts way after, like, that initial nft wave. I was more on, like, the meme coin shit coin side of, like, thriving, living my best life, losing money. It was great. But one of the things that is really apparent now is, like, there are a lot of EVM builders that are hesitant to go over to Solana because they're like, it's rust. It's a completely new. Like, we don't have the infrastructure internally.
00:19:57.506 - 00:20:25.466, Speaker A: And to see you guys go from Solana to EVM and now bitcoin, like, that takes a lot of technical talent within the team. And I think that in itself speaks like, it speaks volumes. And I think it's really cool that you're as reflective on what happened post FTX and this transition over as you are, because I think there are a lot of founders that would have just tried to brush it under the rug. And it's nice to hear it from your perspective.
00:20:25.530 - 00:20:50.562, Speaker C: No, for sure. Like, over the. Yeah, almost three years now, we've been building this company. There's so many of these examples where it's like, wow, we could have done things a lot better. And the important thing, I think, for us is what we try to do, at least amongst the founders, is like, not only reflect on what those things were, but what are the lessons to draw from it, which then ultimately become kind of like values in the company.
00:20:50.738 - 00:20:51.362, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:51.498 - 00:21:01.336, Speaker C: There's, like, so many I can name. Like, I know you probably remember this as an early Solana person, the balloonsville situation. There was a huge hyped bro, and.
00:21:01.360 - 00:21:06.096, Speaker D: I love seeing in the comments, they all just post a balloon and everybody's like, ah, yeah, yeah.
00:21:06.160 - 00:21:18.216, Speaker C: It was like huge hyped mint. And everyone was excited about it. And it was like an immediate rug and atrocious. It was terrible. And this was two months into the company.
00:21:18.320 - 00:21:18.804, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:18.904 - 00:21:29.060, Speaker C: You know, I thought we were done as a company and we ended up, like, refunding everyone the money, all this kind of stuff. And it was a very hard decision, but ultimately the right one.
00:21:29.132 - 00:21:29.436, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:29.500 - 00:21:50.032, Speaker C: And really we codified that as a cultural value, which is like, if you have to choose between users and something else, you stick to the users. And that's a manifestation of that, of, like, us doing a very hard thing when we also did not have any money back then, but we did that because it was the right thing to do and that set us up for, yeah, growth, dude.
00:21:50.048 - 00:22:23.474, Speaker D: I think this is something. Even as a trader, I'm very active in the space and across ecosystems, right? Like Evm, Solana, bitcoin. Like, I think, like, you find these opportunities that always exist. And, like, on the flight here, I've told you this story already, but, like, I got texted about depe the Djen Pepe, and it ran 100 x, and then I also, in the same flight that I didn't have wifi on, I missed 1000 x, and that was MFR that came out and I was like, mfo, dude. Like, I was on the floor the same flight. I'm like, dude, are you serious?
00:22:23.894 - 00:22:25.446, Speaker A: But you need to fly more.
00:22:25.510 - 00:22:33.182, Speaker D: I know. I'm going to send somebody a message, like, yo, here's five ETH. Like, I'm flying. Like, whatever you buy, just do it.
00:22:33.238 - 00:22:34.274, Speaker C: I can be that guy.
00:22:34.934 - 00:23:33.022, Speaker D: But I think one of the crazy parts about this is just like, there is such an abundance of opportunity that exists in the space. Now, that being said, there are also a lot of bad actors. But navigating that as a launch pad, as a marketplace, as a cross chain marketplace, like, I think you guys have done a very good job of maintaining reputation amongst your users, right? Like, yes, you've taken some hard lessons, took them on the chin, refunded money, done those things. But this, this pivot to bitcoin, I want to kind of double click on this because like we said, you guys have made you have a reputation for building infrastructure for new ecosystems, right? Ordinals come out and this is what, a year, 15 months ago? Yeah, more or less 15 months ago, ordinals come out. This is like a huge new wave. People are buying things like free mints and there's no infrastructure, and there really wasn't much of anything over there. And you guys decide to build a marketplace.
00:23:33.022 - 00:23:40.110, Speaker D: Can you kind of go into what was the beginning of ordinals? What did you see and how did that go about? How quick was that turnover?
00:23:40.182 - 00:23:41.034, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:41.574 - 00:24:06.720, Speaker C: I'll answer this a couple of ways. One with, like, the actual, like, storyline of everything, of like, the timeline. But I also want to talk a bit about, like, what is the ethos internally for us as founders and as the company that even drives us to do something like that. Right, I'll start with that one, because I think it's interesting. One of the things we really believe is that. Because. Because crypto is like the way it is, what you just described.
00:24:06.720 - 00:24:12.908, Speaker C: It's greenfield everywhere. Always, always greenfield everywhere. Even in a bear market. It's like that.
00:24:12.996 - 00:24:13.628, Speaker B: Right?
00:24:13.796 - 00:24:29.980, Speaker C: Because, yeah, last year, ordinals, it was a huge bear market in nfts. And we always feel that it's very. You cannot make good intuitive decisions about what to build, what not to build, unless you are deeply, deeply in the ecosystem.
00:24:30.012 - 00:24:30.524, Speaker D: 100%.
00:24:30.604 - 00:24:30.988, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:31.076 - 00:24:38.124, Speaker C: So we have this saying in the company that we tell all of the leaders in the company, you cannot make decisions from an ivory tower.
00:24:38.424 - 00:24:38.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:38.824 - 00:24:48.216, Speaker C: Which is basically saying that if you are up in the clouds somewhere thinking about, like, strategy or something, but you're not actually using the products that are.
00:24:48.240 - 00:24:50.040, Speaker A: Out there and you're not in the trenches.
00:24:50.112 - 00:24:50.272, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:50.288 - 00:24:57.164, Speaker C: You're not on Farcaster doing a bunch of stuff there with Degen. You're not, like, on ordinals with ombs. You're not.
00:24:58.344 - 00:25:05.328, Speaker D: No, my girlfriend. My girlfriend got onboarded to crypto via degen. But what you're saying points to onboarding.
00:25:05.416 - 00:25:06.280, Speaker C: People that aren't here.
00:25:06.312 - 00:25:06.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:06.480 - 00:25:07.448, Speaker D: Like being in the trenches.
00:25:07.496 - 00:25:11.208, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. And you have to just experience it, use it.
00:25:11.296 - 00:25:11.760, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:11.872 - 00:25:45.564, Speaker C: That's what gives you the intuition and then also. Then the conviction to make very hard bets like this. Yeah, because you cannot as a, you know, I was a consultant where everything we did was so meticulously analyzed. Like, every decision was like, here's the 30 page deck of all the analysis about why we should do X or Y. Cannot do that in crypto. Like, it just moves so fast that two weeks from now, it could be totally something different. So the only way to actually internalize and make good decisions is it starts with having good foundations of intuition.
00:25:45.564 - 00:26:04.684, Speaker C: So that's close to the users. So then I'll sort of explain why I told that story. Because for ordinals. We had two people in the company that were like, hey, guys, we should look into this. You would. And this is, like, very unexpected who they were. It was a general counsel.
00:26:05.744 - 00:26:06.484, Speaker B: Right?
00:26:08.144 - 00:26:09.312, Speaker C: And our head of security.
00:26:09.448 - 00:26:10.200, Speaker D: No way.
00:26:10.272 - 00:26:10.616, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:10.680 - 00:26:12.008, Speaker A: Like, not the product guy.
00:26:12.056 - 00:26:15.704, Speaker C: Not the product guy. Not me. It was our general counsel and head of security.
00:26:15.824 - 00:26:16.408, Speaker D: No way.
00:26:16.456 - 00:26:24.776, Speaker C: And that. I just want to tell that story because that should give you and everyone a picture of the types of people we hire in the company.
00:26:24.880 - 00:26:25.144, Speaker B: Right?
00:26:25.184 - 00:26:36.874, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't. You can't just hire, like. Yeah, really, like, credentialed people or something. Obviously, you want credentialed people as well, but they have to be credentialed, and they have to be in it. They have to love it.
00:26:36.954 - 00:26:37.410, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:37.522 - 00:26:45.854, Speaker C: Because you'll go through ups and downs. You have to love this. So our general counsel, Joe, you know, came from Fenwick. Extremely credentialed lawyer.
00:26:46.354 - 00:26:50.362, Speaker D: Dude, I'm so shook. This is such a crazy happening.
00:26:50.418 - 00:27:05.774, Speaker C: He was like, he lives in New York. He's an OG bitcoin guy. Like, just, you know, goes to bitcoin, has been going to bitcoin meetups for ages. And he was like, hey, guys, I'm in this thing called an ordinals discord. There's, like, 30 people in here. It seems really interesting. We should take a look.
00:27:05.774 - 00:27:21.630, Speaker C: And we were like, what is this? And then, like, we were like, okay, cool. And then two days later, he was like, hey, guys, I, like, gave someone, like, three ETH for a jpeg that they might send me later, because back then, there was no way to buy.
00:27:21.702 - 00:27:24.806, Speaker D: No, this is the discord thing. Like spreadsheets and shit.
00:27:24.870 - 00:27:58.002, Speaker C: Literally. This is pre spreadsheets. He was just, like, giving someone money, and then. Because, yeah, it was interesting, right? And then a couple of days go by, we look into a more chart free monkey on our team. He's like, big community guy is, like, in it, and he's, like, talking to everyone, meeting people. There's, like, a lot of excitement, right? Because this is the first time that you could see a dapp or ecosystem or use cases forming on bitcoin. But any kind of analysis that you wanted to do, you would never make the decision to build it.
00:27:58.002 - 00:28:11.944, Speaker C: Because we were like, Solana was pretty tough. We had launched on EVM. It was pretty tough polygon. The gaming stuff was not taking off. Maggedgen had just done a layoff at the beginning of 2023.
00:28:12.114 - 00:28:12.564, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:12.644 - 00:28:51.804, Speaker C: So as a company, we were, like, kind of in a tough spot. We're trying to, like, refocus reprioritize everything, just stick to the core. So any rational actor would probably not do it, but deep down we kind of just thought, it's bitcoin. How can you fade bitcoin? And if this technically works, that we could actually build infrastructure that enables a marketplace. If we could actually pull that off, then this could be really big. So we should make that bet. And that was about ten days after Joe, our GC, had first told us about ordinals.
00:28:52.304 - 00:29:26.908, Speaker A: I absolutely love this story because I remember last year, ordinals came about and I was trying to buy an ordinal. I was looking at threads, I was looking at all these posts that people are making, and quite frankly, I was like, this is too fucking hard. It's too complicated. Like, I'm slammed at my day job right now. I was working in NFT lending and I was like, yeah, whatever. It is what it is. And actually, just recently, I used magic Eden to mint ink on BTC, and I used magic Eden to like, do some flips and do some trades and buy some overpriced inks, because I buy for art.
00:29:26.908 - 00:29:31.060, Speaker A: And that's why my. Why my bags are down very bad. It's okay.
00:29:31.092 - 00:29:32.224, Speaker C: I'm proud of it.
00:29:33.034 - 00:30:03.354, Speaker A: But, like, between the infrastructure that you guys had for just like, the marketplace and also the magic Eden wallet, like, the magic Eden wallet is now my BTC wallet. It's incredible. And like, for someone like me, who's like, I would say I'm fairly fluent in the space. I use defi platforms. I do all the farming stuff I could. I just think, like, this is what's going to onboard people into like, BTC ordinals and Defi. So it was a great bet that you guys made.
00:30:03.434 - 00:30:04.650, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it was crazy.
00:30:04.682 - 00:30:04.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:04.954 - 00:30:17.946, Speaker C: Like, uh, yeah, we didn't talk about the spreadsheet trading as well. There was a whole, like, dude, that few weeks there, people were just trading on spreadsheets. This is when we were building our marketplace and we were like, oh, God, but this can't come out sooner. Yeah, soon enough.
00:30:18.010 - 00:30:21.026, Speaker D: Oh, and like, ordinal punks and everything too. That was insane.
00:30:21.050 - 00:30:22.082, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:30:22.178 - 00:30:22.626, Speaker D: Insane.
00:30:22.690 - 00:30:23.082, Speaker B: Insane.
00:30:23.138 - 00:30:35.284, Speaker C: So, um, no, it was a. Yeah, it was an amazing bet that we made and really proud of the team who pulled it off as well, because it wasn't obvious at the time.
00:30:35.364 - 00:30:36.220, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:30:36.372 - 00:30:40.572, Speaker A: How long did it take you guys to build out all of that? Like, and then.
00:30:40.708 - 00:30:41.092, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:41.148 - 00:30:45.212, Speaker A: Was magic Eden wallet always a part of, like, that roadmap or.
00:30:45.348 - 00:30:52.712, Speaker C: Yeah, good question, actually. So all the bitcoin stuff we built, like, just the marketplace. We probably built that over three weeks. Three, four weeks.
00:30:52.768 - 00:30:53.440, Speaker D: No way.
00:30:53.552 - 00:31:26.674, Speaker C: We basically got Rex, who's one of my co founders, and he's our, like, he's like absolute 1000 x engineer. Like, he's the best, best, like, protocol guy that we have. And he built most of the back end, like, all of the stuff that touches the chain. And then we had another one of our engineers build the front end, and we had a little squad, like four or five people just working on it. Two guys in the community. Two guys, two engineers. Then that was like maybe two weeks of work.
00:31:26.674 - 00:31:29.294, Speaker C: They got maybe 60, 70% of the way.
00:31:29.714 - 00:31:30.050, Speaker B: Then.
00:31:30.082 - 00:31:33.762, Speaker C: The last 30% is always the hardest, right? The last 10% is always the hardest.
00:31:33.938 - 00:31:34.786, Speaker D: Dotting the t's.
00:31:34.810 - 00:31:38.426, Speaker C: And so what we did, I hope.
00:31:38.450 - 00:31:39.474, Speaker A: You'Re not dotting teas.
00:31:39.594 - 00:31:41.082, Speaker D: It's 3 hours of sleep. I'm sorry.
00:31:41.138 - 00:31:41.466, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:41.530 - 00:32:00.516, Speaker C: And then what we did to kind of just get that last mile was we said to the company, like, hey, guys, we're making this bet and these guys have been working on it. And we're going to host a hackathon internally, which any engineer in the company can come to if you want to, but we're going to work on ordinals to get this thing out the door.
00:32:00.620 - 00:32:00.996, Speaker B: No way.
00:32:01.020 - 00:32:01.884, Speaker A: Oh, that's cool.
00:32:01.964 - 00:32:11.314, Speaker C: So we rented an Airbnb in California and got, we had like maybe twelve engineers fly in for it who wanted to come.
00:32:11.354 - 00:32:12.226, Speaker D: No way, dude.
00:32:12.250 - 00:32:17.554, Speaker A: I'm getting, like, early Facebook vibes. Like that scene from social network. The hacker house.
00:32:17.674 - 00:32:17.970, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:18.002 - 00:32:23.730, Speaker C: They came in, they hacked on it for a week in this house, and then the next Tuesday we launched.
00:32:23.882 - 00:32:45.124, Speaker D: Incredible. What was that first? Because, like, take us back to early ordinals. Like, I was there. And props to you for taking the bet. Like, I was working for. For proof at the time. And I remember having a conversation and I was like, brc twenties had just come out and I was like, dude, what the fuck? Like, the shitcoin market we never knew we needed.
00:32:45.124 - 00:32:58.252, Speaker D: And I posted that tweet when Orty was minting, and I didn't mint, dude, if I would have put $100 in, that would be like $5.3 million or something like that. And I tweeted about it instead of actually buying it.
00:32:58.268 - 00:32:59.620, Speaker C: This guy's like an anti signal dude.
00:32:59.692 - 00:33:01.464, Speaker D: No, literally, I'm like, well, tweets.
00:33:01.804 - 00:33:07.744, Speaker A: See, that's why it's like, he makes fun of me for buying things. Cause I like the art. And I'm like, at least you buy it.
00:33:08.284 - 00:33:39.898, Speaker D: But, like, take us back to that. The early moments, like, the first few launches that you guys had, like, can you. Can you kind of. Because a lot of these collections were minting for free, or they were holding off for infrastructure because, like, they took, like, they inscribed on the BTC blockchain, but then they didn't do anything with the collections. And, like, similar to what you're talking about with on the Solana early days, like, you couldn't index collections and stuff like that. Like, doing research on early ordinals was a total shit show. And because, like, the first ten k, like, you had a few different.
00:33:39.898 - 00:33:54.218, Speaker D: You have bitcoin, shrooms. You had different kind of collections that existed. But, like, the early days, it was like, if you were inscription, like sub ten k, that's like a kind of a different thing.
00:33:54.346 - 00:33:55.850, Speaker C: The metas were almost different.
00:33:55.962 - 00:33:57.442, Speaker D: Completely different to now.
00:33:57.498 - 00:34:00.580, Speaker C: Like, to now. Yeah, because back then, actually, it was. It was.
00:34:00.612 - 00:34:00.796, Speaker B: It's.
00:34:00.820 - 00:34:09.924, Speaker C: You're right. It's like forced. Forced upon us because we could not do certain things right. You could not create a collection back then, it was impossible to create, like a ten k collection.
00:34:10.004 - 00:34:10.196, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:10.220 - 00:34:33.351, Speaker C: So what people were doing, they were just like, inscribing stuff as early as possible, and then they wanted to just buy stuff that were low inscription numbers. So back then, the one of the first things we actually shipped was not like collection pages. It was sub one k. Yes, sub five k. Yeah. Ten k inscription. And people would browse those as the collection pages, and we still have them.
00:34:33.351 - 00:34:59.464, Speaker C: So if you look on the page today, it's just like a bunch of random stuff. It's like you cannot comprehend it. It's not coherent at all. It's just random people inscribing random things. But people really valued that for a while. And then I think then we built the launchpad also for ordinals. And that made it a lot easier for creators to basically then do some pre inscription and then launch it using our launchpad.
00:34:59.464 - 00:35:25.600, Speaker C: So that started sort of people getting onto more of a traditional collection, but now we have the whole gamut. It's kind of like some people drop, like, you know, art thing. Like ten item art things. Some people drop large collections, some people drop really, really low. Inscription number one of ones. We also launched this thing called rare sats to. We've gone so deep on bitcoin, it's kind of crazy.
00:35:25.600 - 00:35:27.764, Speaker C: It's like, sometimes I think back, I'm like, whoa.
00:35:28.984 - 00:35:31.344, Speaker A: All because of Joe in those ten days.
00:35:31.424 - 00:35:31.888, Speaker C: Crazy.
00:35:31.936 - 00:35:32.160, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:32.192 - 00:35:44.312, Speaker C: We've all these rare sats now which is for people that may not be familiar, it's like different properties that are linked to the individual satoshis. They were involved in certain, like, famous transactions.
00:35:44.408 - 00:35:44.688, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:44.736 - 00:36:13.794, Speaker C: Like pizza sats. Pizza sats. It was Satoshi's first transaction, stuff like that. So we have a marketplace where you can trade those satoshis as well. And the really interesting thing that we have going on at the moment is that creators who want to launch on ordinals, they will go on magic Eden. They will acquire and buy the rare sats that they want. Then they will inscribe their stuff onto those rare sats and then launch those collections.
00:36:13.794 - 00:36:18.042, Speaker C: So it's really cool. Like, the properties here are really interesting. It's very different to what we see on Ethansol.
00:36:18.138 - 00:36:18.370, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:18.402 - 00:36:52.646, Speaker D: Well, incomeoners was one of those, right? That they were one of the first ones that was. It was a ten k collection that was minted on all uncommon sats, which was like a big thing like that. I think that's something that is very attractive to the ordinal ecosystem. And now I kind of want to get your take on what you're seeing as a builder of ordinals. How do you see this developing? Like, if we go back to early ETH days, ETH Nfts blew up, right? And there was a lot of lending volume. Like, people were like, this is like nifty five comes in and then there's like, nifty five. Bendao came in and that was a huge unlock.
00:36:52.646 - 00:37:09.096, Speaker D: And then you had arcade, and like, people are just leveraging up and then pushing up higher prices. Now, the. The thing that's really interesting about bitcoin is you have these bitcoin whales that are ancient. And we just saw one the other day. It was yesterday, actually. Somebody swept $1.3 million worth of, uh, bitcoin puppets and node monkeys.
00:37:09.096 - 00:37:18.264, Speaker D: And I was like, holy shit. Like, this dude's next level. Next level. He hasn't been active in five years. And then he comes in and just. Or he, or they. She, I don't know.
00:37:18.264 - 00:37:53.854, Speaker D: Um, they, they come in and I wanted to be. I wanted to be proper here. They came in and they swept $1.3 million worth of nfts, right? How do you kind of see this happening? And also, what angle does NFT finance play in this? Like, we've seen liquidium come in and now they've done over 700 bitcoin and volume since inception. They've done 50 btc of volume just this week. So, like, we're starting to see people leverage up right. And like, liquidity is kind of similar to sharkify over on Solana.
00:37:53.854 - 00:38:17.214, Speaker D: So it's just like a week or 16 day loan that you can take. So you can't really take long leveraged up loans, but there is an opportunity there for somebody to come in. There's obviously an appetite there. So I guess my question would be like, how do you see ordinals developing? Are we going to see a similar kind of PFP run that we saw on ETH back in the day? And also, what angle do you think NFT finance plays in this?
00:38:17.254 - 00:38:38.306, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. My broad macro perspective is that I'm very excited for bitcoin to have like, a full on ecosystem. Yeah, that's what we actually are really excited about. Ordinals was the first inclination that that could be possible. It's like a generation of fees outside of, you know, for miners.
00:38:38.370 - 00:38:38.594, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:38.634 - 00:39:19.514, Speaker C: Like, and that as a possibility would be insane. And that's why I think a lot of the big, there's a big, been a big, really big theme recently, the last couple months of like, building bitcoin l two s. So there's a bunch of teams that are trying to do that now. We've met them all, like, excited about that space, too. And then when you go into, like, nfts in particular. Yeah, there is basically the trend now, I think, is a lot of artists and creators are coming in from the other ecosystems to basically try it out now that you can do pretty much everything that you've wanted to do. And we're starting to see sort of like, yeah, all these, all the normal things you would expect around an NFT ecosystem also build.
00:39:19.514 - 00:39:28.094, Speaker C: And we are honestly pretty pumped for all of that because that shows that it just adds more maturity into the market.
00:39:29.314 - 00:39:31.754, Speaker A: Like BTC Defi is becoming a thing.
00:39:31.794 - 00:39:40.554, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And the reason that gets me really excited is because you've always wanted that in bitcoin.
00:39:40.674 - 00:39:41.122, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:41.218 - 00:39:59.750, Speaker C: That's always been the dream because you have the most decentralized chain, all the properties that, that make it amazing, but you've never really been able to build anything on it. So when you think about the possibility of, like, merging those two worlds together, that's insane to me. Like, blows my mind.
00:39:59.942 - 00:40:05.446, Speaker A: I mean, that's the only reason why Ethereum came about with, like, programmable smart contracts and all of that.
00:40:05.510 - 00:40:39.644, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. And I was talking, I was at an event last night with one of our investors, electric capital, and I was talking to one of the guys there and he framed it in a really good way. Which I'm going to steal from him. He's like, he's a gigabrain. And he said that it's almost like a changing of the guard in terms of bitcoin development, because previously the prior generation has been very like. Yeah, they've been kind of pretty against just like building things on top.
00:40:39.724 - 00:40:40.108, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:40.196 - 00:40:42.028, Speaker C: And it's been kind of very stodgy almost.
00:40:42.116 - 00:40:42.428, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:42.476 - 00:41:25.154, Speaker C: But you have this new wave of people who've been coming in the last twelve months or so, they're like very passionate about trying to build an ecosystem on top and trying all these different things, ordinals, all these l two s, all kinds of stuff. And if that can be pulled off, that actually is insane. So we are. Yeah, we're just happy to be a part of it, to be honest. You know, we are really, really active trying to help anyone who's trying to build on bitcoin at the moment because we've done a lot of the really hard yards at the beginning of bootstrapping something that was pretty hard. So if anyone is now doing it, we want to be part of that ecosystem. We want to help them.
00:41:25.154 - 00:41:32.878, Speaker C: I don't know how it's going to play out, but I think now it's really accelerating. Number of developers on bitcoin, dude, it's insane.
00:41:32.966 - 00:41:52.260, Speaker D: And just to see how unit bias plays a huge role on bitcoin, you'll mint something for zero three bitcoin. You're like, oh, 0.03 bitcoin. And then you're like, holy shit. It's like, that's a lot of money. Right? There's this unit bias that you don't necessarily understand. And I guess we see it on ETH compared to soul and stuff like that.
00:41:52.260 - 00:41:53.652, Speaker D: But bitcoin is a whole nother.
00:41:53.748 - 00:42:28.422, Speaker C: The other thing I would say as well is that the cost of it all, it is obviously really expensive to do do stuff on bitcoin, relatively. And the cost of all is actually like a feature because you don't get like, if you are like a. I'll give you the just the most extreme example. If you are trying to scam and you want to create a scam collection or like a scam meme coin, you're just not going to do it on bitcoin. Yeah, right. It's like, yeah, it's like too expensive, it's too hard. So there's almost this natural barrier to prevent, like really, really egregious bad stuff.
00:42:28.422 - 00:42:47.318, Speaker C: But it's easier to do that on some, on other chains, which is fine. It's like just trade offs, but on bitcoin, it's less likely. And we actually see that because our teams are out there talking to creators, talking to people. And it's just true. You don't get as much scammy behavior because it's prohibitive, naturally prohibitive.
00:42:47.406 - 00:42:53.510, Speaker A: And bitcoin, transacting on bitcoin right now is kind of painful, very slow.
00:42:53.662 - 00:43:35.754, Speaker D: Well, and what role does centralization play in some of this stuff? Like I said, been trading ornamentals quite a bit. And something I've noticed is like, it's like, there are bids, like, you guys do have bids that you can dump into bids if you want to do that. Um, and there's, there's different ways that you can go about transacting and building on bitcoin or building a portfolio or whatever the case may be. Right now, I think something I'm pretty interested in hearing your, your kind of take on is like, what role does centralization play on bitcoin? Reason I asked that is like, transaction speeds are atrocious. It takes 30 minutes for anything to go through. Now if I sell something, I end up getting BTC in my wallet.
00:43:35.834 - 00:43:36.098, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:36.146 - 00:43:42.514, Speaker D: Like, that is something on the front end that I see. But how does that actually work on the back end?
00:43:42.594 - 00:43:43.362, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:43:43.378 - 00:43:46.266, Speaker C: I mean, transactions take like forever, 20 minutes or something.
00:43:46.370 - 00:43:46.586, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:46.610 - 00:43:56.036, Speaker D: Well, and then, like, you have the CPFP child pays for parent kind of transaction that you can push through. And like, that's like, after you push through a transaction, it's taking 40 minutes. You're like, well, fuck it.
00:43:56.060 - 00:43:57.356, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, yeah.
00:43:57.500 - 00:44:06.708, Speaker C: I think it's hard to say if centralization is gonna play a part. It will probably play a part in some, for some things. Like even some of these bitcoin l two s, they're not true roll ups.
00:44:06.876 - 00:44:07.276, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:07.340 - 00:44:29.382, Speaker C: It's not like optimism or something on bitcoin, right. It's more like people are trying to connect EVM solidity into. Yeah, into bitcoin. Or like, maybe some of the guys are doing like a, like a multi sig, basically. So it's not true. True roll ups. So we'll see how that all plays out.
00:44:29.382 - 00:44:35.870, Speaker C: So there's definitely a degree of centralization as you, as if you want to do something on an l two.
00:44:35.942 - 00:44:36.554, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:37.214 - 00:44:41.182, Speaker C: There are other people who are exploring things on using lightning to make transactions faster.
00:44:41.278 - 00:44:42.114, Speaker D: Got it.
00:44:42.654 - 00:45:19.236, Speaker C: I don't, I'm not, like, deep enough in that to really talk about it, but I do think that it just won't be the chain that you do everything on that's kind of my thesis just at more like a macro level. It's like if you want to be doing something like launching a bunch of meme coins and like, trading really quickly, trading perpetuals, you're probably just not going to do that on bitcoin. It just doesn't really make sense to do it. And eventually, maybe in two years you could do it, but it. You will be taking more centralization, relatively, than say, doing it on ethereum or an l two on optimism or whatever.
00:45:19.340 - 00:45:19.940, Speaker B: Right?
00:45:20.092 - 00:46:02.904, Speaker C: So I always think about it as like, you pick the right base level infrastructure for the use case that you have. And that's why I'm excited that we are building some stuff that's multi chain, because it doesn't, you know, for us, it doesn't matter what the use cases are, you just kind of want to be able to support it right. From a pure, like, user level. So if a user wants to do something that's like extremely high provenance, expensive thing, and they're happy to do on bitcoin, great, like, come and do that. If you want to like, flip a 200,000 item collection on Solana, you'll come and do that. It's all good, you know?
00:46:02.984 - 00:46:12.756, Speaker A: Okay, but what about and Dalton, you can dig into this. What about meme coins on bitcoin? Like, I think we're seeing, like, it's coming. It's coming.
00:46:12.900 - 00:46:14.300, Speaker D: We don't think it's coming. It is coming.
00:46:14.332 - 00:46:14.932, Speaker C: It's coming.
00:46:15.068 - 00:46:15.644, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:15.764 - 00:46:18.104, Speaker A: All I know is I need more exposure to pups.
00:46:19.644 - 00:46:20.704, Speaker D: There we go.
00:46:21.124 - 00:46:49.096, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that I'm still trying to wrap my head around as I'm starting to explore ordinals, BTC, DeFi and all of that stuff is like, obviously there's BRC twenties, which is, you know, the meme coin equivalent. But then I think it was a couple of months ago, the guy who made ordinals created that ordinal thing that got dropped. And now people are mining runes and, like, runes is like, comparative to BRC 20.
00:46:49.280 - 00:47:03.864, Speaker D: Like, so BRC twenties are atrocious to use. Like, I just. If we're just going to be completely honest, like, BRC twenties are horrible to use. Like, there's no partial fit. Like, if somebody puts up a cell wall on.
00:47:04.024 - 00:47:08.256, Speaker C: I have some BRC twenties in my wallet now that I'm like, I'm scared to, like, I don't know what to do with it.
00:47:08.280 - 00:47:46.080, Speaker D: Well, no, well, you can't sell them. They're very difficult to use. Like, there's no partial fills. Like if somebody puts up a cell wall, like, and we're talking about pups, right? Pups has like 77% of the collection is BRC 20 and then the other 23% of the collection is pre rune nfts. They're basically ERC 404s, basically that represent a specific amount of fungible tokens. As an NFT, well, somebody the other day put a $42,000 sell on pops and it was like, yo, somebody has to buy $42,000 worth or the price will not pass. That.
00:47:46.080 - 00:48:12.490, Speaker D: This is something that it's atrocious. Now runes are coming in and this launches on block 840,000, which is going to be the happening. Yep. What are you feeling about runes? Fungible tokens? How is this going to work out for you? Like, what are you guys thinking at Magic Eden? Like, how are you kind of positioning yourself? Because they're coming. It's coming and volume is coming.
00:48:12.562 - 00:48:13.026, Speaker B: Yep.
00:48:13.130 - 00:48:21.214, Speaker C: We are excited about runes and we're building runes. So we're building support for trading of runes for day one.
00:48:21.554 - 00:48:22.402, Speaker D: For day one.
00:48:22.458 - 00:48:23.114, Speaker C: Day one.
00:48:23.234 - 00:48:24.334, Speaker D: No way.
00:48:24.954 - 00:48:29.098, Speaker C: That's how bullish we are. And you know what? Like that story I told you about an Airbnb.
00:48:29.186 - 00:48:29.594, Speaker B: Uh huh.
00:48:29.634 - 00:48:38.698, Speaker C: We're running it back for roots. So after NFT NYC, literally, I'm gonna get on a plane on Monday morning and we're gonna go to California and I'm gonna sit with Aaron.
00:48:38.746 - 00:48:41.018, Speaker D: Run it back, run it back. No way.
00:48:41.106 - 00:48:43.434, Speaker A: Oh my God. Do you need like that to be captured?
00:48:43.514 - 00:48:48.514, Speaker D: I was gonna say, like, if you want some Irl documentation, that would be super cool.
00:48:48.634 - 00:48:49.702, Speaker C: Yeah, that could be really cool.
00:48:49.778 - 00:48:52.190, Speaker A: Are you doing northern California?
00:48:52.302 - 00:48:53.514, Speaker C: No, in the Bay area.
00:48:54.814 - 00:48:55.726, Speaker A: I'll fly up.
00:48:55.830 - 00:48:57.526, Speaker D: I was gonna say, hey, I wish.
00:48:57.550 - 00:48:58.078, Speaker C: We make it happen.
00:48:58.126 - 00:49:18.198, Speaker D: Yeah, that could definitely be a thing. Do that. So runes, to me, make a lot of sense in terms of, like, ordinals we're seeing. Like we talked about liquidium, you have all this ordinal lending that's coming in, adding functionality and efficiency to a meme coin market. And they don't have to be meme coins. It's just fungible tokens in general.
00:49:18.246 - 00:49:18.406, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:18.430 - 00:49:27.022, Speaker D: Like, you're talking about these BTc l two s that are, that are like in the wings right now. We're waiting for that to happen. Runes just make sense.
00:49:27.118 - 00:49:27.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:27.646 - 00:49:36.314, Speaker C: I mean, if you think about it. So there's definitely the meme coin stuff. There's one category, but if you actually just take a step back and look at the evolution of even Ethereum.
00:49:38.094 - 00:49:38.382, Speaker B: We.
00:49:38.398 - 00:50:00.482, Speaker C: Always laugh about the old coins and 2017 icos and stuff. But what actually was that thing? That thing was basically teams can get funded, build a bunch of stuff, right? And then teams that were building natively on Ethereum could then get funded which then made the ecosystem bigger, which then led to more developers. So it creates that flywheel.
00:50:00.578 - 00:50:00.898, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:00.946 - 00:50:37.582, Speaker C: And to me that actually is one of the maybe like underappreciated things that I think could happen with runes. Obviously a lot of people are excited about meme coins because it's like whoa, fundables and bitcoin. That's crazy. I'm like sweating thinking about it too. But like, but if you just take a step back, it's also teams like liquidium, like BTC machine, these TGE events, a bunch of these teams now that have been grinding, building random things on bitcoin over the years. Or it's maybe like developers who have been considering it but you know maybe they're like, nah, it's better for me to go build on whatever l two instead.
00:50:37.678 - 00:50:37.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:37.974 - 00:50:47.110, Speaker C: They'll be like, nah, you know what, I might go try build on bitcoin and then they can launch a runes token if they want to, right.
00:50:47.222 - 00:50:48.662, Speaker A: They have that opportunity.
00:50:48.718 - 00:51:02.034, Speaker C: There's an optionality that didn't exist before. So I think that this could also catalyze the developer ecosystem in a way that we didn't. Yeah, that's actually like what makes me really, really bullish actually.
00:51:02.494 - 00:51:57.216, Speaker D: That's insane. Yeah, well just even thinking about the opportunities that are going to exist for builders, like you're saying like these TgE events for people across the ecosystem, whether it be on ETH or solar wherever, like that's how they make their money. And like the Ben Roy put it the best. I think like teams use TgE events as their nitrous oxide boost in fast and the Furious, like you have one of them can't fuck it up and you launch it at the right time and it's just this massive boost of liquidity, this massive boost of like financial backing that you can get to kind of continue developing there, right. And that's going to attract way more builders to the space because as of right now, what can you do on bitcoin aside from launching an ordinal project that's going to cost you a shit ton of money to inscribe, right? Like I think there's, there's a few big collections and they're saying like it's into the millions of dollars for you to mint or to inscribe 10,000 pieces.
00:51:57.280 - 00:51:57.432, Speaker B: Right.
00:51:57.448 - 00:51:59.960, Speaker D: Like it's a huge hassle for these teams.
00:51:59.992 - 00:52:01.016, Speaker B: So. Yeah. Yeah.
00:52:01.080 - 00:52:11.362, Speaker C: It's really interesting. Yeah. Like we talk to a lot of the ETH creators pretty often and who are wanting to do something on ordinals for the first time. And they have like a. I don't know. Each image is like two megabytes or something.
00:52:11.418 - 00:52:12.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:12.594 - 00:52:16.938, Speaker C: Then that's gonna cost like $5,000 individually to inscribe. Which is just untenable.
00:52:17.026 - 00:52:17.650, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
00:52:17.762 - 00:52:18.414, Speaker C: So.
00:52:19.234 - 00:52:19.658, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:19.706 - 00:52:20.690, Speaker C: We'll see. We'll see what happens.
00:52:20.722 - 00:52:21.242, Speaker B: But yeah.
00:52:21.298 - 00:52:46.406, Speaker C: We are pretty excited. We think that this can be a huge catalyst. It may not all happen on day one of runes. Like I think it just takes some time for this thing to form and people to play around with it and see what they can do with it. Obviously the first rune has been announced. Uncommon goods Casey. Which is like a mint every day for the next four years.
00:52:46.406 - 00:52:46.934, Speaker C: I think it is.
00:52:46.974 - 00:52:47.714, Speaker B: Right. Right.
00:52:53.214 - 00:52:53.822, Speaker A: Wild.
00:52:53.918 - 00:52:54.174, Speaker B: Bro.
00:52:54.214 - 00:52:55.646, Speaker D: That might not be good.
00:52:55.830 - 00:52:58.594, Speaker A: Well. Let's close this out.
00:53:00.374 - 00:53:01.270, Speaker C: On that note.
00:53:01.382 - 00:53:21.112, Speaker A: On that note. Runes. Runes. Bitcoin habiting bitcoin ETF's absolutely insane. Like I think you are spot on when you're basically saying like, this is a huge catalyst. I think we're going to see things that weren't able to be done before get done. And I just have chills.
00:53:21.112 - 00:53:52.568, Speaker A: Like I think like I said I got red pilled into nfts a little bit later than everyone and obviously like figuring out what marketplaces to use. Like magic Eden again has become my go to for all things bitcoin. But I don't think I've ever been more bullish on a marketplace. You know what I mean? Like obviously blur has blur farming. Opensea is doing whatever the fuck opensea is doing. And then you now have like magic Eden. That's touching so many different ecosystems in such meaningful ways.
00:53:52.568 - 00:53:58.952, Speaker A: Especially with things like the wallet like I mentioned earlier. So I'm really glad you took the time to sit down and chat with us.
00:53:59.008 - 00:53:59.472, Speaker C: Thanks so much.
00:53:59.488 - 00:53:59.616, Speaker B: Guys.
00:53:59.640 - 00:54:00.280, Speaker C: This is really fun.
00:54:00.352 - 00:54:01.462, Speaker B: Yeah. Between.
00:54:01.518 - 00:54:05.686, Speaker D: Between the earthquake ordinals, runes. This has been an entertaining one.
00:54:05.710 - 00:54:08.394, Speaker C: The earthquake was just a sign of how bullish the world was.
00:54:10.214 - 00:54:17.318, Speaker A: Like. We will have support for runes day r1.
00:54:17.366 - 00:54:28.832, Speaker D: Bro. Well, thank you so much for taking the time. Like, this is so much fun for us to get to riff. And it was nice getting to know you and this conversation has made me bullish on magic eat. To be honest. That's awesome.
00:54:28.888 - 00:54:29.360, Speaker B: Cool.
00:54:29.472 - 00:54:29.816, Speaker C: All right.
00:54:29.840 - 00:54:41.736, Speaker A: Guys. Well, we hope you enjoyed this one as much as we have because it's been literally quite thrilling on multiple different levels. But until the next one. Catch you guys later.
