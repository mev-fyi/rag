00:00:00.360 - 00:00:48.880, Speaker A: Okay, before we get started, I just want to say that none of this is financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just here farming this points meta because, you know, your girl is in her farmer era and I'm going to be breaking down and sharing with you guys how I'm doing that. All right, now that we kind of know what 404s are, I want to talk you guys through my play for the meta street governance token MST, which will be a 404 token. I am particularly excited about this because NFT finance is literally one of the most overlooked narratives. And I think as the market starts to pick up, a lot of eyes are finally going to be turning their heads to this vertical of defi. And look, my bullishness for NFT finance is rooted in a really simple thought process.
00:00:48.880 - 00:01:34.060, Speaker A: The majority of assets that exist in our day to day lives are non fungible in nature. So it only makes sense that when these assets come on chain, they're going to come on chain as nfts. And with the innovation and push we're seeing around the 404 standard, it just makes me even more bullish. So for those of you who don't know, Metastreet is one of the OG NFT lending platforms. They've been around since 2021 and they position themselves as a debt capital market for digital assets. High level Meta Street NFT lending platform that utilizes a peer to pool tranche lending model. Meta street to date has over 87 million in total lending volume, with their current TVL sitting around 20 million, including nfts.
00:01:34.060 - 00:02:26.586, Speaker A: What's really cool about Metastreet launching their governance token as an ERC 404 is that they're actually going to be able to leverage their own platform for borrowing and lending, and they're basically taking their governance token and turning it into an NFT. And that actually opens up a whole world of new dynamic possibilities for how on chain protocol governance can work. So let's actually talk about their Ascend campaign that just came out today. Ascend is Metastreet's points program that's going to run until May. These points, or XP as Metastreet calls it, will translate into direct exposure for the Metastreet token. And being early matters because Metastreet is announcing various points point boost. For example, on day one, that is, today, you can get a 50% point boost that's going to decrease by 5% daily over the next ten days.
00:02:26.586 - 00:03:19.824, Speaker A: And they're going to have these additional campaigns with a few of the apps on Blast where I believe that's coming in March when they open up the bridge. So you'll actually be able to do a triple farm, which is exposure to Meta street, exposure to blast, and exposure to the app on blast. But they haven't necessarily announced the specific details. We just know that we'll be able to participate in this triple farm as long as we have their liquid credit token, also known as lcts, which is what you get when you deposit wrap stake to ETH to Meta Street's pools. So ascend is a weighted points program and there are two ways you can get points. One is through reserved actions, which is actually interacting with the protocol and depositing into the lending towers for 80% of the points to distribution. And then there are prestige actions, which is doing things like inviting friends and posting about meta street on social media.
00:03:19.824 - 00:03:54.778, Speaker A: In terms of reserve actions, I'm actually going to be doing two things. I'm going to be setting up a defi loop to earn points, and then I'm going to sit on some of my lsts in preparation for the blast integrations coming in March. To get started, you're going to need two things. You're going to need ETH for gas and you're going to need wrap staked ETH for depositing. If you don't have any wrap staked ETH, all good. You can actually swap for it utilizing any decentralized exchange. I highly recommend using llama swap since it's an aggregator and you're more likely to get the best rates on gas as well as exchange ratio.
00:03:54.778 - 00:04:24.834, Speaker A: So let's walk through this defi loop I'm setting up. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my wrapstick to ETH and I'm going to put it into one of Meta Street's lending towers. This first tower is Meta Street's lending pool for cryptopunks. You can see here my points that I'm going to receive and this 0.15 m, this is the Metastreep wrapped staked ETH token that's tethered to wrapped cryptopunks. 20 is the LCT that I'm going to receive. So you can see that right here.
00:04:24.834 - 00:05:01.184, Speaker A: We're going to go ahead and mint this. So now that I'm depositing, I'm getting meta streets LCT. There are two lcts that you can get depending on the price per NfT that you are lending on. So now that I have my meta street LCT, what I'm actually going to do to set up the Defi loop is I'm going to press pro. And here under the Defi loop category, you're going to see borrow or lend on summer five. If you hit borrow, this is going to open up the link that's going to let you borrow against your metistry LCT. So here I'm going to go ahead and deposit 0.3,
00:05:01.184 - 00:05:23.844, Speaker A: and then I can see that my max borrow is 0.2, but if I put 0.2, it's probably going to be way too close to liquidation. Yep. So too close on the LTV. I'm going to go ahead and do like 0.175, give myself a little bit of wiggle room there.
00:05:23.844 - 00:06:04.300, Speaker A: So using Summerfi, you can borrow up to 75% of the value of your liquid credit token, which is pretty cool. Gas fees are rough. We hate that, but that's fine. We're going to do it. So now that I have wrapstaked ETH from summerfi, I'm going to go back and I'm going to deposit more wrapped staked ETH. And my plan is to basically supply Lp afterwards. And to supply LP, you need equal amounts of of the LCT and wrap staked ETH.
00:06:04.300 - 00:06:48.648, Speaker A: So I'm only going to mint so I'm only going to deposit half of my wrapped steak to ETH this time around. So here we go. All right, now that that's deposited, I should be able to supply equal parts. So I'll do 1.4 and then 1.4, and you can see here that's going to give me a nice little chunk of points. All right, let's go.
00:06:48.648 - 00:07:30.784, Speaker A: All set up on this front. So what I did here was I took my rap, staked ETH. I deposited that into Metastreet's lending tower. Metast lending tower gave me my LCT, which is my liquid credit token. I took my Lct to Summerfi, I borrowed against it to get more wrap staked ETH, and then from there deposited that wrap staked ETH back into the lending tower and got another chunk of LCT tokens. And what I did, instead of keeping the loop going, because theoretically you could keep the loop going, you would just have multiple leverage positions. And for me, I don't really want to manage more than one leverage position for a farm.
00:07:30.784 - 00:08:08.128, Speaker A: So what I did was I went ahead and I supplied to the curve lp pool for additional points, and now I'm earning points. I'm pretty much prepped for stage two. When they open up the bridge to blast, I'll probably continue to try to stack my lcts in preparation for that bridge opening. Hopefully you guys found this guide helpful. And you know, if you're farming Meta street, or if you're interested in farming Meta Street, I do have a referral link. Help me out with some of those prestige points, if you will. And that's it for this one, guys.
00:08:08.128 - 00:08:27.554, Speaker A: I'll probably do a follow up video once the bridge to blast opens because I'm actually really curious how that mechanism is going to work. And until then, bearish or bullish, keep farming. See what I did there? All right, but really bearish or bullish? Keep building. Thanks guys, for tuning in.
