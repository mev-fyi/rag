00:00:04.366 - 00:00:15.262, Speaker A: What are the discussions internally when you see a blue chip have multiple lending death spirals, a massive floor fall and, like, talking about how that works with user alignment?
00:00:15.358 - 00:00:16.894, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question.
00:00:17.014 - 00:00:23.846, Speaker C: How do you kind of see that process of the early days, like, really shaping the ethnft ecosystem that we see today?

00:00:45.774 - 00:00:54.246, Speaker C: Last minute alpha. Anything that you wanna share, floor is yours. Anything that you feel like is important to share. This is your time.
00:00:54.310 - 00:01:07.094, Speaker B: It's something that, like, I really want to see less of, like, the most is our channel.
