00:00:00.480 - 00:00:57.086, Speaker A: Before we fully dig in, let's look at how traditional finance works versus decentralized finance, or DeFi. One of the biggest things that this boils down to when we're looking at the broader real world asset market is how DeFi ultimately provides transparency, reduce costs, and increases capital efficiency. It's kind of obvious that this is a pretty big win, and it's backed by research. Last year, the International Monetary Fund found that DeFi is more cost effective when looking at comparing price, cost margins, and marginal costs across DeFi and traditional finance institutions. Thanks to the nature of smart contracts and the blockchain, DeFi has the lowest marginal costs. According to Defi Llama, the TVL, or total value locked for RWAS, is about $2.1 billion, and it's up about 609% since June of 2023.
00:00:57.086 - 00:01:26.514, Speaker A: On top of that, tokenized financial products make up most of the current market share. So why is this a big deal? Well, RWAs are actually still trying to find product market fit, but experts like Boston consulting group are projecting that real world assets will grow into a $16 trillion opportunity by 2030. And right now, all of Defi's total value is still being measured in the double digit bill billions. That's how early this all is.
