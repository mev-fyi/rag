00:00:00.240 - 00:00:30.525, Speaker A: I feel like that meme where it's like, but it can go higher. I should probably take some initials out. Oh, my God, it's so late. It's past my bedtime. I just got out of the shower and I just. Excuse me. I just got out of the shower and I did it just in time to catch the new Eliza AI coin that's coming from Shaw and AI16Z Dao.
00:00:30.525 - 00:01:31.247, Speaker A: I literally, like, got off shower, ran out to my couch and, like, just checked my laptop and saw that he said he was going to be launching soon in the Discord. And then he ended up posting the pump fund link and that, like, very quickly got circulated because by the time I opened it, it was already like 10 million. But I was able to basically catch it around 6.4 million just by, like clipping it. I rammed like six and a half soul in there. I usually don't go into things with this much size, but when it seems like something really obvious, I've been like, basically building up the courage to just like ram the soul in there. But now, like, I'm kind of frozen and it's just like, oh, should I take profit? Probably, like, what would I feel more this going to zero or like seeing this double? All right.
00:01:31.247 - 00:02:10.209, Speaker A: I am not. I'm just thinking back to all the times that I was up pretty significant profit and didn't take any profit. I think I want to exit most of the bag and leave like, maybe 25% of the bag left to just be a moon bag. I took profit, so I think that's where I'm gonna end the night. I'm pretty stoked. This is my first win with like, some decent size in a long time. And I actually, that's how I wrecked my bag.
00:02:10.209 - 00:02:45.385, Speaker A: The first time was I went into too many things with like, you know, four soul, five Soul. And it adds up. And I just was. I basically over traded and like annihilated my bag bag down to nothing. So now the trading bag is up. How to deal with like the greed framework there in like real time for a second. But, you know, at the end of the day, profit is profit and part of this is to try to get more capital so I can go explore apps and have liquidity to deploy.
00:02:45.385 - 00:02:50.625, Speaker A: But, you know, here we are.
