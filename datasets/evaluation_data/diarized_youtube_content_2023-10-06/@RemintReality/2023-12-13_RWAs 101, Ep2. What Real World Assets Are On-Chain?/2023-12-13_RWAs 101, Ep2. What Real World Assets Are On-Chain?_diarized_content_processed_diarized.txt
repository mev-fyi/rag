00:00:00.280 - 00:01:08.512, Speaker A: So, real world assets, what are they? Well, from what I've seen, it's basically anything that exists in the real world that would benefit from representation and ownership on chain. Most of it is tangible things like bonds in real estate, all the way to commodities like gold and silver, and even collectibles like luxury watches, trading cards, comics, etcetera. So what exactly is coming on chain? Well, it's a wide variety of stuff, and you're actually already probably familiar with stable coins like USDC and USDT, which are backed with fiat currency as underlying assets. That is, their real world assets. In addition to that, we're also seeing things like real estate, security, tokens, agriculture, trade, finance, commodities, and fixed income assets like bonds and treasury notes. Come on chain. And then I think the side of it that's kind of for me personally, a little bit more exciting to see is things like luxury watches, designer apparel, and collectibles like trading cards and comics coming on chain, because I feel like more people have access to those items.
00:01:08.512 - 00:01:49.744, Speaker A: And if you're like me and you don't come from a traditional finance background, a lot of this seems kind of complicated because many RWAs that are on chain now are financial products, and a lot of them require you to be an accredited investor, to deploy capital, or. Or you just need to have a really good grasp on how traditional finance works today. As I start to reimagine the way we transact with the innovation and technology that is still being created and, like, literally battle tested today, it becomes easier to see how the world as we know it can change. How all of these assets are coming on chain varies across the board. We're seeing RWAs be tokenized as.
