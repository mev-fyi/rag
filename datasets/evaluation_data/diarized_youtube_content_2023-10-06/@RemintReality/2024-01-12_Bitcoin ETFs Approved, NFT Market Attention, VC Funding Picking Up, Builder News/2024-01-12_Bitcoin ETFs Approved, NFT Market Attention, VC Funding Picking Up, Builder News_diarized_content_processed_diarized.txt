00:00:01.240 - 00:00:04.834, Speaker A: All right, here we are. Hey, Dalton.
00:00:06.054 - 00:00:10.710, Speaker B: We are both sick today, but we are rallying, and that's all that matters.
00:00:10.862 - 00:00:28.734, Speaker A: Hell, yeah. It's our first show of 2024. Bitcoin ETF's just got approved today. Prior to the show, it took us, like, 30 minutes to get on here and hit the record button because I've just been staring at the charts like this. Like, what is happening? Like, guys, sea of green.
00:00:29.994 - 00:00:30.802, Speaker B: Wow.
00:00:30.978 - 00:00:35.666, Speaker A: My God. I know. We're going to talk about the bitcoin ETF in a bit, but just.
00:00:35.770 - 00:00:37.162, Speaker B: Dude, up only.
00:00:37.338 - 00:00:38.338, Speaker A: Up only, right?
00:00:38.386 - 00:00:43.914, Speaker B: Okay, now. Okay. The r1 token that everybody cares about here. How is Popcat doing?
00:00:44.034 - 00:00:57.590, Speaker A: Mmm, Dalton, we're looking good. Popcat is over $11 million market cap. Not to show my own bags, but first pop. First cat coin to a billion. I'm ready.
00:00:57.742 - 00:01:02.566, Speaker B: Okay, well, keep us posted on it. Halfway through the show, I'm going to ask you again just to see what's going on.
00:01:02.590 - 00:01:15.766, Speaker A: Okay. Be over here. Oh, yeah. Do it, do it. You know, disclaimer. Guys, nothing that we say is financial advice. And obviously, there's a lot to cover with the market and everything that's happening.
00:01:15.766 - 00:01:23.830, Speaker A: So I think. Dalton, do you. We just want to jump in and talk about where market attention right now is for nfts because there's some interesting stuff happening.
00:01:23.942 - 00:01:41.714, Speaker B: One, of course, we took a couple weeks off, just with the holidays and everything like that. And I think that one of the things that surprised me the most was, like, coming back here and just seeing how we have had, like, a continued downtrend on ETH nfts. We had a few pumps here, there. Like, I know d gods pumped, like, 3.6 or 3.7. They're back at three. ETH board apes.
00:01:41.714 - 00:02:25.344, Speaker B: Board apes have absolutely dumped. So mutants are down at their all time low, and ethan board apes have gone from, what, 30 ETH to, like, 22 something. So that is just, like, a continued downtrend. And it's pretty interesting to see this ETH NfT market just ETH in general. Now we have, like, the ETF news and ETH is starting to pump. But I'm wondering, is this where we start to see a reversal on ETH nfts? Like, as much as I shit on ETH for gas prices and stuff like that, like, I think that people are starting to dance on graves, like, myself included, where I'm just like, ooh, bored apes at 22. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a bottom here soon.
00:02:25.344 - 00:02:29.820, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's basically what I've been paying attention to over the past couple of weeks.
00:02:30.012 - 00:03:16.434, Speaker A: Yeah, the, the other thing too with like just regards to Yuga, I feel like we've definitely seen a lot of like yuga ogs come out on the timeline. I know otherside recently put out a trailer that was pixelated. Like people have a lot of grievances with what other side put out. But I think it's the big thing that I'm kind of thinking of is like will Yuga continue to remain dominant as ETH nfts specifically bored apes and mun apes? Because right now it's not looking like it. Like what is the future looking like for the collection? I also know there are blur farmers that are no longer providing like blend loans on board apes, which I think I don't have the NFT stats tweet.
00:03:16.474 - 00:04:10.616, Speaker B: But I saw like it was CBB. CBB was the, was the big lender that decided to pull his liquidity over there. I think that this is also interesting because I know that this week blur nerfed one of the top two blend farmers, or blur farmers in general because they were just dumping and pumping each other's bags. I think CBB actually posted something about like what if they, the blur farmers actually had to provide liquidity for projects that they wanted or that they thought were healthy enough to provide liquidity in. If blur were to make that move, it would make things a lot healthier in the ecosystem because basically just as this is going to NFT stats his point right through. Since blur farming started, there has been incentivized liquidity that did not want to own those things. So then if pudgy penguins pumped and they went to eleven e, then like the blur bids kind of trailed that, right? And then people that were like okay, cool, I'm going to take advantage of this.
00:04:10.616 - 00:04:51.546, Speaker B: This is at eleven ETH. I'm going to dump into blur bids here. Then those blur bid farmers are stuck holding something that they do not want. Um, so I think that that's just something that in the beginning when blur kind of announced their blur bid farming and everything like that incentivize liquidity, a lot of people came out and said oh, this is going to make the market so much more efficient. That hasn't happened because people with a lot of money have come in with like the incentivization of the blur token and it hasn't worked, right? Like NFT prices have been murdered pretty much across the board. So if blur somehow makes a pivot here and like does listen to some of these top blur bid farmers. It'd be pretty cool.
00:04:51.546 - 00:04:54.506, Speaker B: I think it would make the ETH NFT ecosystem a lot healthier.
00:04:54.690 - 00:05:07.818, Speaker A: For sure. For sure. And I think on top of that, um, I think a lot of folks are now starting to turn their attention towards Azuki and the couple of announcements and speculations that Azuki has had. And.
00:05:07.906 - 00:05:09.894, Speaker B: Give it to us. Give it to us.
00:05:10.234 - 00:05:49.866, Speaker A: You know, me, like, with my elemental. But like, as someone who is in the Azuki ecosystem, this is so exciting to finally see. So basically today, Azuki actually just announced they're going to be creating an anime anthology series. For those of you guys who don't know what anthology is, it just means that every single episode within the series is going to be a completely different story, different characters. With one of the most renowned anime directors now coming on board to Azuki as a creative producer. So this guy has worked on one piece film, the one piece film red. As well as like Code Geese and a bunch of other big name animes.
00:05:49.866 - 00:06:23.380, Speaker A: And then, so like, massive announcement coming out today. And I think this is like an announcement that everyone in the garden has been waiting for. And there's a lot of hype. But even prior to this, there was actually this tweet from this company called the web3 foundation that just says, towards an open anime universe powered by anime token. A lot of us are speculating, could this be Azuki's anime token? I think, you know, this font is like an Azuki font. This is an Azuki red. So there's been a lot of speculation.
00:06:23.380 - 00:06:37.994, Speaker A: So we've seen beans pump. We've seen Azuki start to show some life on the charts. So I think a lot of eyes are on here. I need to check the leverage on blur. Can you look at what the blend loans are on Azuki right now?
00:06:47.214 - 00:06:59.404, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I just see a lot of dots. I don't know how to read. This has been so confusing to me. I see a lot of dots, like, going up.
00:07:00.624 - 00:07:11.448, Speaker A: Let's see what the loans are. Okay, this is. Well, this is nice. So a lot of these loans are not for more than the floor, which is great.
00:07:11.496 - 00:07:14.544, Speaker B: Okay, so this. This line in the middle is the floor currently, yes.
00:07:14.664 - 00:07:14.984, Speaker A: Yep.
00:07:15.024 - 00:07:22.000, Speaker B: And then this is just LTV. We're basically just reading LTV here. So like, what is that? 5.75.8?
00:07:22.152 - 00:07:30.608, Speaker A: Yep. And then left is interest. And then like, this is apy the rising.
00:07:30.656 - 00:07:32.728, Speaker B: Like the dots at the top?
00:07:32.896 - 00:07:36.384, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, these loans look healthy. This is actually kind of.
00:07:36.504 - 00:08:00.570, Speaker B: So what is LTV on that? LTV would be like 70%. 70% to 80%. Loans are now starting to rise in liquidity or rise in interest rates. Yeah, yeah. Which I feel like that's about the same as, like, traditional peer to peer kind of platforms. Like, 70 to 80 is kind of like, all right, we're starting to get risky, so I guess that makes sense. Yeah, it's funny, dude.
00:08:00.570 - 00:08:19.098, Speaker B: This is something that I actually really enjoy about working in nfts and just crypto in general. I'm like, I spend every single day looking at charts, reading as much as I can. Whatever. Right? You asked me to look at the blur loans and I'm like, what? I don't even know how to reach.
00:08:19.146 - 00:08:35.304, Speaker A: This, in all fairness. Like, the way blur displays their blend loans is, like, weird. Yeah, it's, like, not great. It's pretty hard to get a good picture of what's going on from it. Something that Eddie and I would talk about a lot.
00:08:35.604 - 00:08:36.464, Speaker B: And then.
00:08:37.524 - 00:08:38.236, Speaker A: Oh, go ahead.
00:08:38.300 - 00:08:44.260, Speaker B: I do have a quick question about that anime token. What is that looking like? Has it launched? Do we have a contract address? Nothing.
00:08:44.372 - 00:08:54.784, Speaker A: Nothing, nothing. We literally just have an x account that a few, like, Azuki has retweeted and that's it. And this, like, one post, I'm like, dude.
00:08:54.824 - 00:09:06.352, Speaker B: I'm like, I'm about to go, like, Dex tools use the search for anime tokens. Well, because, like, that would be huge. Like, anime verse. Yeah, I'm not seeing.
00:09:06.408 - 00:09:36.494, Speaker A: I think I know there's a lot of folks in the garden that have been waiting for Azuki to drop a token of some sort of. Especially because what we've had ape coin, meme d gods dust. And so it's something that a lot of folks are demanding, and I kind of get it, but at the same time, it's like, I don't really know what the purpose of the token is going to be. But, hey, if it comes out, I'm fucking stoked. That's great.
00:09:36.954 - 00:09:43.122, Speaker B: Yeah, that's awesome. Well, thank you for your expertise on Azuki's because I don't have that.
00:09:43.298 - 00:10:13.244, Speaker A: I'm just. I'm really excited to see how the answer anime series goes. Cause I think to me, that's personally more interesting of, like, how will this ip be leveraged? Azuki's big thing is, like, how do we build a decentralized anime brand, like, alongside our community? And it's like, I have yet to see a project, maybe with the exception of pudgy penguins, that's, like, really allowed for their holders to facilitate the world building. If that makes sense.
00:10:13.354 - 00:10:53.676, Speaker B: So, no, I think what you're talking about there especially, we've talked about, we've talked about IP before on this pod. And it's like, IP is such an important part of certain collections. Right? Like with pudgy penguins, it makes sense now, if you're talking about like, malady or something like that. Like, I don't necessarily care about the ip of milady. Like, I think that's just way too degen, um, for that to really matter. I could be wrong there, but I think Azuki is one of those that it leans more towards pudgy penguins. And we've been kind of sitting here waiting, like, okay, so what does Suzuki actually do? Yeah, so if they, if they really hit this out of the park, they have like the anime, the animation series, that sounds, that sounds right up their alley, launching a token with that.
00:10:53.676 - 00:10:59.624, Speaker B: And also with pudgy penguins, speculatively kind of launching a token as well, like that. That could be really interesting.
00:10:59.924 - 00:11:04.944, Speaker A: It's going to be fun. See, I think that might bring some life back to ETH NFTs.
00:11:05.244 - 00:11:27.188, Speaker B: Oh, 100%. 100%. Cool. Well, let's pivot a little bit. Um, over the past, I would say three weeks, four weeks, um, I have started looking more and more intensely at ordinals. Um, I missed the boat on bitcoin puppets. I also missed the boat on node monkeys.
00:11:27.188 - 00:12:26.824, Speaker B: But I think as we're talking about ETH NFts and kind of the, this kind of situation that we have with ETH NFTs, like, it's just not moving, right? And people are like, okay, like that, that meme, like, come on, do something. Like, that's kind of how we feel about the ETH NFt world. Ordinals and Solana NFTs have kind of been the outliers here. Right? Yeah. This pat, this was nodemonkeys minted for 1200 bucks just a few weeks ago, I believe, two weeks ago, three weeks ago. Um, and what, what is really interesting here is like, node monkeys and bitcoin puppets have kind of taken this role of more mainstream bitcoin ordinal NFT collections, right? They are spreading out the ordinal maxi kind of niche, and these are now kind of getting into the ETH NfT people, the Solana NfT people. I see Twitter profiles that are mainly talking about Solana nfts that are now talking about bitcoin puppets.
00:12:26.824 - 00:12:42.624, Speaker B: The same thing was happening with node monkeys. So I think this is a very interesting topic that especially now with, like, bitcoin, ETF's and everything like that going on. How do you think ordinals kind of develop over the next couple months?
00:12:43.044 - 00:13:01.988, Speaker A: So I have not purchased an ordinal yet. And, Dalton, maybe let's zoom out a little bit, because my basic understanding of ordinals are inscriptions on the bitcoin blockchain. And there are stats that you could basically hunt for, so you can actually. Sats. How do you say it?
00:13:01.996 - 00:13:03.164, Speaker B: Satoshi. Satoshis.
00:13:03.244 - 00:13:08.628, Speaker A: Satoshis. Yeah, stats. Oh, no. Fuck. This is the ESL. This is, you know how I told you.
00:13:08.676 - 00:13:09.464, Speaker B: I'm sorry.
00:13:11.404 - 00:13:13.644, Speaker A: Yeah, sats. Yes, sats.
00:13:13.804 - 00:13:15.308, Speaker B: Like the sat with an s?
00:13:15.436 - 00:13:42.184, Speaker A: Yeah, but I keep adding an extra. Whatever. The sats. Basically, you can mint, or I guess, inscribe on specific blocks on the bitcoin blockchain. And certain sats are more rare than others because they have various cultural significance, whether it was like the bitcoin pizza sats, or the first block. Right.
00:13:42.224 - 00:13:44.832, Speaker B: Of the chain 69 or something like that.
00:13:44.888 - 00:14:17.190, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, I feel like I could see ordinals picking up more steam. I know there's a lot of folks that have also been chatting about, like, defi on bitcoin. I think, like, for me personally, beyond holding bitcoin and, like, in all honesty, exchange wallets, because that's where I first got exposure to it. I've always just felt a little intimidated by entering into the bitcoin ecosystem. It's like a completely different wallet system. Does that make sense?
00:14:17.302 - 00:14:45.670, Speaker B: Yeah, no, of course. So, like, this is the main topic right now, the topic of discussion within ordinals with these two collections. Specifically, node monkeys, minted for 1200 bucks. And I believe I have it in the notes here. Um, they, node monkeys are eighty three k to one hundred eleven k inscription numbers. So, like, they're relatively low, which is the reason why they have a much higher floor. So the floor on node monkeys is 8400.
00:14:45.670 - 00:15:11.594, Speaker B: The floor on bitcoin puppets is 1500. There's a lot of, like, heat being given to the node monkeys team about the fact that they minted for 1200 bucks. And then bitcoin puppets was like a $10 mint, and now they're at 1500. So there's a lot of people that are like, oh, bitcoin puppets did it. Right, this, that, and the other. Okay, first off, node monkeys are eighty three k to one hundred eleven k inscriptions. Right? Like that.
00:15:11.594 - 00:15:27.752, Speaker B: That's relatively early. Like, it is early. Right? Like, bitcoin puppets is 53 million. 53 million. So, like, that's a huge gap here. Now, I'm not taking anything away from bitcoin puppets. Like, I think they've been hilarious.
00:15:27.752 - 00:15:40.424, Speaker B: Like, they. They definitely, like, scratched this itch that people have. They're like, this is kind of funny now. You have, like, the ETF history kind of coming, like, integrating into this. So I think that that could be bullish for. For puppets and things like that, so. But they.
00:15:40.424 - 00:15:42.272, Speaker B: They are very different, right?
00:15:42.408 - 00:15:58.960, Speaker A: Yeah. Is the. Is it fair to say that, like, a huge part of, like, the value when it comes to ordinals is. Is really, for me, it sounds like it's kind of based on provenance. What block are you on? And, like, is that the main thing?
00:15:59.072 - 00:16:27.428, Speaker B: See, and this is where early on I was, I pulled the Derek Edwards, right? Derek Edwards talked about, like, writing about crypt or crummy squiggles and not buying any of them. I did the exact same thing with BRC twenties ordinals. I was, like, sitting there tweeting about it. I was like, oh, this is the shitcoin market we've always wanted. Didn't buy anything, right? Didn't mint anything. I just sat on my hands. So my initial thesis on this was just like, dude, I don't really understand what the value prop is here now for one, Satoshi.
00:16:27.428 - 00:16:46.162, Speaker B: Like, something being inscribed and all of that. Like, it does carry an inherent value on chain versus off chain. Like, there's no ipfs or anything like that. Like, this is on the bitcoin blockchain. But then bitcoin maxis were like, that's like graffiti on the blockchain. And I'm like, okay, well, graffiti is kind of cool. Like, I guess, like, like, there I.
00:16:46.178 - 00:16:48.090, Speaker A: Can if you do and damned if you don't.
00:16:48.122 - 00:17:12.073, Speaker B: Basically, exactly one. Like the. The altruist. Like, traditional bitcoin maxis are going to be like, dude, this is slowing down the chain. This, that, and the other. Whereas other people are like, I think that the social flex of owning ordinals is going to be really big. Like, if you have a collection that is, I don't know, like, you own a bitcoin ordinal that is worth, like, hundreds of it, thousands of dollars.
00:17:12.073 - 00:17:45.080, Speaker B: That's badass, right? Like, I can understand that's the same thing that happened to ETH, and ETH wasn't on chain. Like, they were like, ipfs, jpegs that you own something that got you more things, whether it be airdrops or whatever, getting into this community. So that said, I think that there are some massive hardships with ordinals. Like, building on bitcoin is super slow. Like, you see like this. 163 buys pending and shit like that. I'm like, this is not how it's supposed to be.
00:17:45.080 - 00:18:06.894, Speaker B: Like, you're buying something and you're just waiting. You're like, I hope I bought it. So, like, I think. I think that some of that is also really interesting, but does that add to the lore? And that therefore makes it more expensive because people are like, yeah, like, I'm trying to buy and sell this thing and I don't like you. How do you market make nfts on bitcoin? Like, it would be tremendously difficult. Right?
00:18:06.974 - 00:18:09.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you kind of don't.
00:18:11.014 - 00:18:26.434, Speaker B: Which is like. Which is a positive, I guess. Right? So then, I don't know. This is something I've been going back and forth with, and I'm super interested now that I'm, like, deep in. Deep in the game, and I'm just, like, sitting here researching everything. So actually, tomorrow I'm minting my first bitcoin ordinal.
00:18:27.534 - 00:18:31.074, Speaker A: Well, let's see if you actually get the transaction to go through.
00:18:32.784 - 00:18:52.056, Speaker B: I'm excited. Yeah, no, I think. I think it's a cool. Whether they be bitcoin ordinals or BRC twenties. Like, I do think that there is a. This is a leveraged bet on bitcoin, similar to how we flip nfts to make more ETH ordinals and BRC twenties are a way for us to make more bitcoin. Right.
00:18:52.056 - 00:19:00.484, Speaker B: And we'll see if it works. Like, I still think that things are pretty decently priced for, like, how big bitcoin is. I don't know.
00:19:01.064 - 00:19:06.336, Speaker A: We'll check in on you next week and see how your mint goes and you can give the whole rundown.
00:19:06.480 - 00:19:08.176, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm excited about it.
00:19:08.320 - 00:19:54.058, Speaker A: So switching gears a little bit of, like, the last show we did, we talked a lot about predictions, what, you know, Tang and Ben saw for 2024, what we saw for 2024, and kind of just recapping 2023. We are now in 2024. Um, before we, like, get into, like, what we feel like we can, you know, expect to see for the rest of the year, we need to talk about the shit show that happened yesterday with the SEC as well as ETF's finally being approved today, which was pretty awesome. Let me see if I can. It's just so good, guys. This is. It only feels appropriate that this happened literally right before bitcoin ETF got approved.
00:19:54.058 - 00:20:31.804, Speaker A: So in case you live under a rock and you missed it, the SEC's Twitter account yesterday basically put out a tweet being like, all bitcoin ETF's are approved and then went and started liking a bunch of degen tweets and engaging and interacting with it. And the TLDR here is the United States government got sim swapped where their Twitter account became completely compromised. Gary Gensler had to come in and provide a comment here. This was just hilarious. I feel like I live in a movie.
00:20:32.424 - 00:21:01.952, Speaker B: Zachary well, so this is where the verbiage here makes me think that this was, like, actually the tweet and somebody just sent it early. But then Gary comes out and he's like, yeah, no, no, no. Like, that's not what we did. And I'm like, so did we get Sim swapped or not? And like, the US government, that should not be a problem, right? And then, like, bitcoin, like, rips to, like 47, 48k. Then it, like, darth mauls all the way back down to 42. And then it, like, regulates back at 45. And I'm like, oh, my God.
00:21:01.952 - 00:21:05.440, Speaker B: And then the rest of us are just sitting here like, okay, so now what happens?
00:21:05.592 - 00:21:10.616, Speaker A: And now the ETF is approved and it's back at 47 with, like.
00:21:10.640 - 00:21:19.164, Speaker B: And this is like, was this planned? Like, I just. I feel like this is just a massive psyop and people are just like. Like the government's just laughing about this the entire time.
00:21:19.304 - 00:21:57.626, Speaker A: Well, it's funny because I know before we got on the show, and I would love for you to go a little bit more into this, like, a lot of what I was thinking about, especially because in December, we saw such a massive, like, influx of, like, shit pumping, especially on Solana. But it was like, our ETF's priced in because we've. Everyone's been talking about ETF's being approved for years now. Arguably, we can say, like, there were some news about it last month. And now that it's here, I mean, we're seeing price movement. What do you think, Dalton? Does it go higher than this? Do we see a drawback? A pullback?
00:21:57.810 - 00:22:16.562, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. So this is what we talked about on the last show, was basically saying how everybody was like, okay, ETF gets approved and then it's a sell the news event. And I'm like, I don't. Like, we all said the exact same thing. It's sell the news event. And I'm like, I don't know if it is anymore.
00:22:16.562 - 00:22:49.730, Speaker B: Right? Because we keep talking about it. And then if I know Sam had NFT stats had posted about this before, like, the gold ETF, like, when the gold ETF happened. Gold went up only. And so, like, yes, there was, like, a tiny sell off that day, but then it just got instantly bought up, and then it was up only. So I'm really interested to see kind of what happens to bitcoin now. We have the bitcoin happening coming up in two or three months, and, like, that is a huge catalyst, and that has traditionally been the catalyst for bull markets. So I'm like, we have a bitcoin ETF, then we have ETH.
00:22:49.730 - 00:23:17.860, Speaker B: ETF's coming out in, what, five months or something like that. There's, like, a deadline for that. Like the Vaneck Etf. Yeah. So I think that we're going to see, like, a lot, a lot, a lot of liquidity that was not, that was sidelined for a long time. Just end up being like, people are trying to get a good price here, but I don't think that that's going to happen. Like, I think a lot of us are sitting here, like, all right, like, the game's beginning, and now we're just going to see a massive influx of volume.
00:23:17.972 - 00:23:44.804, Speaker A: Well, I. It just goes to show, like, no one knows what's going to happen in this market. I mean, the first time that we met, I think we were talking about how we both shared the same sentiment, that it's like, oh, we got, like, another year in the bear. Like, it's going to be a minute. And now here we are in January, and it's like, oh, you know, I kept joking. Like, I'm wildly underexposed. Um, sorry, I lost my train of thought.
00:23:45.544 - 00:24:08.820, Speaker B: Oh, good. Um, no, I. I think that's something that we're going to continue to see now. What becomes interesting to me is, like, traditionally, we've seen bitcoin dominance absolutely soar, and then other platforms kind of tank during that time. Or maybe not necessarily tank tank, but, like, they don't move with bitcoin. Um, I'll be interested to see if that kind of happens again. Right.
00:24:08.820 - 00:24:48.924, Speaker B: Like, does bitcoin suck all the liquidity out of other tokens just so that people can go into, like, true bitcoin? Is there an influx of volume into bitcoin ordinals and BRC twenties? Like, kind of, what. What is the game plan here? And so, like, for me personally, I have a couple big mints coming up. I have a couple plays that I'm, like, trying to see through, and then I'm going over to ordinals. Like, I think that that just makes sense because that's a leveraged bet on, on BTC. And if BTC rips the six figures, I don't know, like, I think that becomes like a very big time conversation and we're going to see multiple billion dollar NFT collections and multiple billion dollar market caps and BRC twenties. Like that wouldn't surprise me. Right.
00:24:48.924 - 00:24:51.884, Speaker B: Because there's so much on chain value on bitcoin.
00:24:52.044 - 00:25:51.318, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. The other, the other big thing that we were talking about specifically within the NFT finance sector of like what we can expect to see this year is the rise of perps and the rise of like more complex products beyond lending and borrowing. While I still think to be clear, if the bull is back, lending and borrowing protocols are going to be absolutely like dominating in terms of TVL, in terms of like outstanding loans. I think we're just going to start seeing people cycle through, um, and really pump that volume. And so on the perps note though, it was actually pretty cool. What? Last week you and I were both on the phone with Wasabi and they casually just mentioned, yeah, we pushed our perps live to mainnet today, but we haven't tweeted about it yet. And so perps are now live on Wasabi, which is exciting to finally see something different than just like the call options.
00:25:51.318 - 00:26:01.352, Speaker A: I think I told you about this, like call options. A little confusing to me. Yeah, I can see long short, like how much leverage do you want to use? Is fantastic.
00:26:01.488 - 00:26:23.760, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and I think one of, I know Ben and I used to do weekly shows as well. And one of the things that we talked about was within twelve to 18 months, I think. And this was now like six months ago. So now we'll say six to twelve months. Six to twelve months from now. I still believe that nft perps flip spot nft volume. Like now it's going to be very difficult to kind of figure out that how that works.
00:26:23.760 - 00:27:02.780, Speaker B: And we're seeing people iterate on it right now. We have NfT perp coming out next week with their v two, which is going to be like a fusion vam. You have wasabi and so NfT perp is on arbitrum, which is an ETH L two. And then you have wasabi that's sitting on the actual main net. I think that that becomes like another interesting conversation because like how do other NFT five protocols integrate that? Like, and I don't necessarily, like, before I was like, ooh, like too many cooks in the kitchen kind of thing where like NFT perp wasabi. Yeah. Tribe three, which tribe three has pivoted a little bit to rwas.
00:27:02.780 - 00:27:45.834, Speaker B: Now Wasabi's going on ETH mainnet. Then you have NFT perp, then you have Tsujiku doing cross chain on Solana. Like, there's so many different ways to get exposure to NFTs now. It'll be really interesting to see how some of these other NFT five protocols kind of integrate all of these different protocols. And I don't know, like, I think it becomes an interesting conversation allowing people to get like exposure to nfts or blue chip nfts, whether they be chromie squiggles, crypto punks, board apes, whatever, they, they can get exposure for $5, you know, and if that's something that they want, especially with leverage, I think it becomes like a really, a really blooming or a possible blooming ecosystem. Yeah, I meant or mute mint.
00:27:47.534 - 00:28:11.368, Speaker A: Thank you. Do you think that? Well, obviously there's a lot of folks that have been building and working on perps quite a bit, but do you think that flooring protocol, them coming out like quarter four of last year, kind of like added some fuel to the fire with actually being able to have like, fully backed underlying assets through their mew tokens?
00:28:11.536 - 00:28:16.752, Speaker B: Yeah, well, when we were on that call with, with wasabi, they're basically integrating.
00:28:16.888 - 00:28:19.520, Speaker A: Um, that's how they're doing their perps, right?
00:28:19.552 - 00:29:09.452, Speaker B: Right, yeah, yeah. They're like buying and selling, like fractionalized positions in using flooring protocols, mew tokens. And that is how, like, because in the past we've seen huge sell offs and huge buy opportunities when the perps were just run off of an oracle. So basically, before it was PvP, right? Like, there was no actual movement on the market. So, like, if somebody came in and had a huge ten e buy on BYC, on NFT perp, that would shoot the platform price way higher because, like, there was actually no integration into the market at all. Right. And so then people would just be going back and forth on that and they did this thing with a funding rate where people were trying to, like, they're trying to incentivize people to take the other side of the trade, but at the end of the day, it was PvP, and if somebody had more money than you, then they can liquidate you.
00:29:09.452 - 00:29:48.594, Speaker B: And it was a game of chicken all the time. And so now theyre coming out with a fusion amm, which is going to be a little bit different. Im excited to see kind of how their v two comes out and like, im going to be playing with it as soon as it launches. And then you also have wasabi over here on ETH mainnet that is now going to actually have, like, these perks be backed up by something. Like, they're actually going to be backed up by positions on flooring protocol. Now, the big problem here to me is, again, fucking gas prices. I'm like, this is not going to be for somebody that wants to put $5 on a b, a yc, five x long, right? This is going to be treated as a settlement layer for NFT perps.
00:29:48.594 - 00:30:11.824, Speaker B: It becomes interesting. Does like NFT perp come out and say like, yes, we're going to partner with Wasabi and then they're also going to back up their thing. Via was like, it, it that becomes like a very, very interesting conversation. And then flooring protocol and FLC token and all of that is all going to get integrated and then you have this beautiful flywheel. But, like, it's going to take projects, like, really integrating with each other. I think that could be a big boom.
00:30:12.204 - 00:30:56.194, Speaker A: It all depends on, like, you know, I think everyone in the space says it when they're like, collaboration over competition, but everyone says that. But we all know everyone is also a very competitive builder in the space. So I think. I think you nailed it on the head there. I think another conversation that's definitely going to be coming back this year that we can expect a lot of back and forth on over the coming months are royalties. We talked about it earlier, Yuga dominance kind of waning, losing a little bit of it. But now they are working with magic Eden to try to make a royalty enforced market on ETH.
00:30:56.194 - 00:30:59.182, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts on this? Do you care for it?
00:30:59.238 - 00:31:39.106, Speaker B: Like, royalties are kind of a scam, but that's like, I'm not a builder in this space. Like, at the end of the day, royalties are the easiest way that collections can collect money. Right? Like you just, like you could literally with royalties, if there are enabled royalties, a collection can come out and put like a hype tweet and that's going to pump price and then there's going to be a dump in price because people are going to take advantage of the profit and then the collection is just collecting free royalties, basically. So they aren't really doing anything. And this kind of plays to the hype cycle and all of that kind of stuff. And I don't think that it makes. I don't think royalties protect, like, creators at all.
00:31:39.106 - 00:32:25.580, Speaker B: Like, I think creators take advantage of it and then that's that, right? And we're always going to speculate that that's what we do. But I think it would be really cool to see some of these NFT fight integrations kind of happen at, like, the collection level where they can, and the only ones that are really doing it right now, like sappy seals, pudgy penguins a little bit with collection on liquidity and then, um, malady. And those are the only three collections that are really kind of leaning into this financialization of nfTs. And I want to see more of that. Like, I hope that both of us are deep in this space. Like, I think that we should call out to collections and kind of show them the ropes on, like, how they can build, whether it be liquidity, provisioning, or taking advantage of flooring protocol. Um, there are ways that collections can make money.
00:32:25.580 - 00:32:58.800, Speaker B: They just need to get smarter. And I think that one thing that we have seen is, like, defi folks are way more, like, curious about getting deep in the weeds on things. We're going to talk about, like, some airdrop farming here in a little bit. Like, there are some different ways that people can take advantage of this and, like, be curious and turn over rocks, and that's how people make money. Now, if collection and collections and builders kind of took advantage of this and kind of took to heart kind of what Defi has done and like, oh, let's turn over rocks and not be lazy, I think collections could make more money that way. But at the end of the day, it's just not something we've seen.
00:32:58.952 - 00:34:04.680, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think you bring up a really interesting point of, like, what does it look like when collections start looking at other means for revenue streams and taking advantage of, like, the native tools that are here and, like, helping the infrastructure and builders that are here. Like, the thing with royalties, for me, I always kind of, like when, when I first started looking at nfTs, like, royalties were the big flag that everyone was waving. Like, artists can finally get paid. And you would, you know, you listen to the arguments for pro and against royalties, and the big one is always like, well, you know, if you're a well known artist and outside of web3, you sell your piece at a gallery, you never see a scent of that, right? But now we're taking like, this, this royalty argument and conversation and applying it to collections that have literally raised hundreds of millions of dollars, whether that was from mint, the royalty fees that they've collected thus far, or if they raised from VC's. And so I kind of agree with you. And ultimately, at the end of the day.
00:34:04.680 - 00:34:32.489, Speaker A: Like, I hope that art NFTs, if we can figure out a way to enforce royalties, that's a massive win for art NFTs. But these are ultimately financial tools for anything outside of that. Like, PFPs, to me, are like a battleground testing ground of, like, does can an NFT transact hold and be a store of value and be a financial instrument? You know what I mean?
00:34:32.561 - 00:35:00.563, Speaker B: Right. Well, and I think, to be fair, like, the infamous, the very famous tweet from Kobe, right? Like, NFTs are just shit coins with jPegs. Like, I think that that is spot on, right? And I think PFP should be traded like that. Like that. There are people that are good at maintaining, like, hype and things like that. Like Azuki. Now with this, like, animation series that's coming out, pudgy penguins, like, pushing Walmart sales and things like that, that becomes very interesting.
00:35:00.563 - 00:35:41.206, Speaker B: It's like, fuck yeah, I want to buy that because, like, the community's, like, badass and, like, people are building things and whatever. Now, I'm not going to say that, but there are companies that have not done that and they have not capitalized on it, right? And so I think that they're, they're. They should be treated like shitcoins. Um, that said, like, I think that there are some really interesting opportunities coming up. Like, have you heard of frame? Um, the new blockchain that's like, enable or royalty enabled? Um, that becomes an interesting conversation. Um, do a lot of projects wrap their nfts and then send them over there? Like, do they port their. Do they pull the d gods and, like, port over to frame? I don't know.
00:35:41.206 - 00:36:14.174, Speaker B: Like, we could see a mass exodus of ETH nfts over to frame and see kind of what happens there. But then the big argument this entire time has been provenance. It's like provenance to be on ETH, bro. And I'm like, yeah, no, like, because now we're wrapping and we're going to a different blockchain because royalties enablement, right? And I think that that becomes like, it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt. Like my grandma always used to tell me. And now collections are getting hurt because they're not collecting their free money. And then they're like, oh, well, providence doesn't matter.
00:36:14.174 - 00:36:23.712, Speaker B: Let's go over to. Let's go over to frame. And I don't. I don't think I'm bullish on that move, right? Like, I think people need to be better and, like, try to figure out different ways of making money.
00:36:23.898 - 00:36:31.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. Note to all the builders. Go. Go explore some liquidity opportunities with NFT fi.
00:36:31.708 - 00:36:48.444, Speaker B: Well, there, I will throw one other builder in there who's actually minting tomorrow on ordinals. Dada. He is in charge of forgotten runes as well. They do a very good job of pushing the liquidity provisioning and things like that. So shout out to Dada. He's building some really epic stuff. And good luck with your mint tomorrow.
00:36:48.444 - 00:37:11.458, Speaker B: That'll be pretty huge. That's actually a sub one K inscription. So like that, I think they're doing an ascending auction. So the low, the minimum bid is going to be a satoshi, like .001 bitcoin and then all the way up to .2 bitcoin. And if you do point to bitcoin, I think you're almost for sure to get one.
00:37:11.626 - 00:37:12.202, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:37:12.258 - 00:37:23.886, Speaker B: I think so. So like .2 is like what no monkeys are sitting at right now? Yeah, node monkeys were like 83k. This is sub one. So it becomes something to pay attention to. Right. Like, I think that they're.
00:37:23.886 - 00:37:27.470, Speaker B: That could be like a pretty explosive collection over on ordinals.
00:37:27.582 - 00:37:30.166, Speaker A: Is that the ordinal collection you're minting tomorrow?
00:37:30.350 - 00:37:57.784, Speaker B: No, I wish. Um, no. Well, not hating on rupture, but rupture is somebody that we talked about on the solana. Um, the Solana den art. Yeah. Um, I minted a solana or a rupture piece like 13 months ago and that actually got me a whitelist to his ordinal piece 210. It's a 210 unique one of ones that he's putting on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:37:57.784 - 00:38:12.384, Speaker B: They're minting for 0.025, which is like 1200 bucks more or less. So I'm really excited. That's like 210 one of ones. Good timing with the bitcoin ETF. Like push it to 10,000. That'll be kind of cool.
00:38:15.674 - 00:39:04.078, Speaker A: So love that. Should we jump into some builder news? Because there's been a few announcement from quite a few NFT protocols over the last week, so obviously we talked about it earlier. Wasabi has released Perps Arcade, which is one of the leading peer to peer lending platforms, has also started to tease out what we can expect from them in 2024. I'm actually really excited by quite a few of these things. Like v four sounds like it's going to be massive. And the thing that I already feel about the peer to peer lending protocols is like each one has its own feature sets and reasons why you would go there like Gandhi. Really easy auto financing, refinancing, I should say also, I think.
00:39:04.078 - 00:39:11.714, Speaker A: Dalton, you correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Gandhi also, interest rates based off of how long you have the loan, or.
00:39:11.754 - 00:39:13.178, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:13.226 - 00:39:28.534, Speaker A: Okay. Wanted to make sure, like, got that right. Um, looks like arcade will be adopting some of that as well, with their pro rated loans, partial repayments, which is cool. Looks like multi chain support. I wonder if they're coming to Solana or where they're going next.
00:39:28.954 - 00:39:33.334, Speaker B: Damn, that's actually. That's actually crazy. No, I haven't.
00:39:33.874 - 00:39:34.690, Speaker A: Yeah, dude.
00:39:34.762 - 00:39:46.570, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually crazy. I have to talk to Renato, bro. Renato. Hey. I'm gonna slide into them DM's real quick. We're in, like, multiple group chats, and this guy has not told me any of this. So next week.
00:39:46.570 - 00:39:49.138, Speaker B: Next week. I have a better idea. Yeah.
00:39:49.226 - 00:39:51.762, Speaker A: I should also hit up toast. The arcade team is.
00:39:51.898 - 00:39:52.814, Speaker B: They're awesome.
00:39:53.554 - 00:40:03.690, Speaker A: We do love them. I'm curious if it's gonna be Solana or another evM. Like, do they go to base? I feel like the top chains on everyone's mind are, like, soul base.
00:40:03.842 - 00:40:04.722, Speaker B: Avax, maybe.
00:40:04.818 - 00:40:05.974, Speaker A: Yeah, avax.
00:40:06.394 - 00:40:33.266, Speaker B: Avax. I actually talked to the Avax team this week, and they are pushing some really cool stuff, and they're also leaning into rwas. I know that they're, like, the main PFP over there is Dokyu, which has been pretty successful. So that I don't know very much about Avax. I think Eddie is somebody. We need to get Eddie on the show eventually, but I think he could give us the alpha. The hops on the plots over there.
00:40:33.370 - 00:40:41.810, Speaker A: Hell, yeah. So, basically, arcade, massive announcement. Speaking of rwas, enabling rwas at scale.
00:40:41.922 - 00:40:43.098, Speaker B: What does that mean?
00:40:43.266 - 00:40:47.402, Speaker A: I have no idea. I have no idea. Speculating.
00:40:47.458 - 00:41:19.216, Speaker B: I read that, and I'm like, okay, so what does that mean? Does this mean, like, pooled? I think one of the big unlocks for RWAs is going to be pooled liquidity. Like, if. If you could pull liquidity, that. To, like, incentivize people that have a Rolex at home, if they could go into a Rolex pool and be like, okay, I could pull 60% LTV on this. Like, yes, I'm going to do it right. And I believe that the watch market is, well, anything is more stable than bitcoin is, like, ETH and shitcoins, things like that. So I'm assuming it's way more stable than that.
00:41:19.216 - 00:41:25.068, Speaker B: So, like, a 60% LTV loan against a Rolex should be kind of easy to figure out.
00:41:25.116 - 00:41:57.466, Speaker A: I feel like, you know, I. I kind of was thinking the same thing, but I feel like the more I learn about the luxury watch space, the more I'm like, is that possible? Because how these watches are valued is so across the board. Like, there are no real oracles yet. I think there's this company called watches IO, which is, like, working on basically pulling together all of the pricing data around watches, but, you know, it's still fairly new. And granted, I love Jake. Love. I've, like, seen the platform.
00:41:57.466 - 00:42:03.978, Speaker A: I think it's great. But it's like, how battle tested is this? Are these all the right sources? So I don't know.
00:42:03.986 - 00:42:24.146, Speaker B: I'll be really interested to hear more about that because I think this is. This could be potentially a huge unlock, whether it be watches, sneakers, real estate, collectibles, comics. Exactly. Real estate. Like, if we can start figuring out web two oracles or web two items with web3 oracles, that would be really interesting. And there'd be a huge unlock of liquidity. Right.
00:42:24.146 - 00:42:37.666, Speaker B: Like, we do have lenders in the space that would definitely prefer lending against something that is stable. Right. Like, especially if the Aprs are nice. Um, that'd be cool. I I need to chat with watches IO. I haven't. I haven't spoken to that team at all.
00:42:37.850 - 00:42:41.362, Speaker A: Oh. I will happily connect you.
00:42:41.498 - 00:42:41.770, Speaker B: Cool.
00:42:41.802 - 00:43:19.534, Speaker A: If you haven't met Jake yet. Also, VC activity is finally picking up. It turns out that VC's still had some dry powder on the side and didn't completely run out of money last year. Because, as anyone knows, um, especially if you work on the protocol level in this space, VC funding dried the fuck up. Uh, no one was writing checks for anything. I think everyone was scared. Granted, we just had the FTX fall out, and just like, black swan event after Black swan swan event, but huge shout out and congratulations to the Gandhi team, who has just raised a new round.
00:43:19.534 - 00:43:27.052, Speaker A: I don't have the details of the round. It didn't look very hard, but I was like, oh, this is cool. There was also Gandhi.
00:43:27.148 - 00:43:41.076, Speaker B: One thing. One thing I wanted to talk about Gandhi is like, I think I don't have the stats on hand. I would have to pull up the dune dashboard. They, I believe, just crossed 10 million in outstanding debt, and I think they flipped.
00:43:41.140 - 00:43:41.644, Speaker A: Wow.
00:43:41.764 - 00:43:45.624, Speaker B: I think they flipped meta street on outstanding debt.
00:43:45.954 - 00:43:48.538, Speaker A: Um, that's a massive milestone.
00:43:48.626 - 00:44:08.346, Speaker B: No, I know. I just. I just talked to Berga this morning. He's a beast, bro. Gandhi, this is. This is another hot take for 2024. I think Gandhi is one of the leading, like, if not the leading NFP peer to peer NfT lending platform by the end of the year.
00:44:08.346 - 00:44:13.810, Speaker B: Those guys are, they're monsters. And what they have coming down the pipeline, I think is, is going to be big time.
00:44:13.922 - 00:44:22.866, Speaker A: I mean, this is pretty massive considering they just launched, what, a couple of months ago, like, right? This dune is 11 hours out of.
00:44:22.890 - 00:44:48.044, Speaker B: Date, but 9.5 million, they're at 9.5. I can't see it. I'm like, I'm down to the light. Yeah. So he, he said that they crossed, they crossed 10 million, which is crazy, right? Because Gandhi flipping Gandhi, flipping meta street and the stuff that they have coming down the pipeline. I just think that Gandhi is by far one of the platforms to pay attention to.
00:44:48.044 - 00:44:55.944, Speaker B: They are beasts. Like, they're continuously building. And. Yeah, I'm really bullish on that team.
00:44:57.084 - 00:44:58.544, Speaker A: We love to see it.
00:44:59.444 - 00:45:09.644, Speaker B: We should get, we should get Berg on here. He'll drop. Actually, what we need to do is an NFT lending marketplace wars. That's what we need to do. We need to get them all on here. Bring on arcade. Bring on nifty five.
00:45:09.644 - 00:45:15.124, Speaker B: Bring on Gandhi. Bring them all on. And I just want to go like toe to toe the hard questions.
00:45:16.264 - 00:45:24.296, Speaker A: We've been joking about this. We should make it happen. I'm sure. But I feel like we have to add like some sort of fun element and into it.
00:45:24.360 - 00:45:38.980, Speaker B: No, battle royale. I just, I want, I want to just, I say this all the time in my calls. I'm like, yo, I'm so sorry for being this honest, but I have to ask this question. And I think having an ambiance like that within a podcast would be really fun.
00:45:39.152 - 00:45:44.220, Speaker A: All right, let's call it the troops. We'll hit up the NFT Illuminati group.
00:45:44.292 - 00:45:44.980, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:45:45.052 - 00:45:50.024, Speaker A: You know, I just have a feeling if we get everyone, everyone's just going to be very polite to each other.
00:45:50.964 - 00:45:54.104, Speaker B: I'll pull it out of them. Trust me. I would love that.
00:45:56.044 - 00:46:34.122, Speaker A: Another NFT five platform, which, to be fair, well, actually, to be honest, I've looked at their platform, haven't actually played around too much with it, but Esee also raised around or just closed on around, just announced around, which is pretty cool. Might need to look into this more to see what they're actually doing on the financialization side. Because the last time I looked at the platform, it was like raffles, which is cool, like more gamified NFT acquisition. I don't know if that's the right phrase.
00:46:34.178 - 00:46:57.346, Speaker B: One stop, one stop liquidity solution for sellers. Yeah. Like, I spoke on a, I spoke on a Twitter spaces with them just a while ago. I don't know the team very well at all. I know Jose or Joe from NFT Perp was on there as well. It's something to pay attention to. Right? Like they, they reached out to me and they, they seem to be building a lot.
00:46:57.346 - 00:47:09.634, Speaker B: And if they're raising money for this Nft fi kind of vertical, I think that they're definitely somebody to pay attention to because the ecosystem is very small. So. Yeah. Interesting.
00:47:09.974 - 00:47:27.322, Speaker A: Yeah, well, but like, this is mostly raffles from what I'm seeing. Like testnet raffles. So I don't know. We'll have to get the alpha before they go on Mainnet and see what is up. Also, Sharky Phi on Solana is raising that.
00:47:27.378 - 00:47:31.778, Speaker B: That is one thing we should pull up here. Do you have the wolf capital tab?
00:47:31.946 - 00:47:32.694, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:33.954 - 00:48:26.504, Speaker B: So one thing that I find really interesting about Solana, Solana Nft lending versus ETH nft lending, if you take out blend, which blend is obviously like a huge player in the NFT lending space, but it is mostly gamified and incentivized liquidity. So if you were to take ETH NfT lending minus blend versus Solana Nft lending, Solana tops ETH nft lending, like, week over week over the past month and a half. And so I, I think Sharkey fi has around 65% to 75% of the share, the market share over there for the time being. And they've been like that for the last, like, year and a half. Like, they haven't, they've been relentless with kind of community building and things like that. Um, citrus is another one to pay attention to. And also, I believe, banks.
00:48:26.504 - 00:49:09.994, Speaker B: Um, that was like, I believe that's the same team as fracked. Um, and it's cool to see Solana NFT lending really kind of blow up. Now, that said, if arcade is porting over to Solana or any of these kind of top ETH NFT market or ETH NFT lending marketplaces, it would be really interesting to see if the Solana NFT holders kind of stuck to their guns or not. And that said, like, on sharky fight, dude, the aprs on sharky fight are ridiculous. They're like fixed rate seven day loans for 180% apr. It's actually wild. No, it's crazy.
00:49:09.994 - 00:49:16.314, Speaker B: Like, I have friends of mine that have just been printing lending against mad labs and tensor ants.
00:49:17.174 - 00:49:21.694, Speaker A: Wow. Wait, borrower or borrowers actually paying interest.
00:49:21.774 - 00:49:40.354, Speaker B: They've been do. Yes, they've been doing it the entire time. There is no such thing. I think citrus is the only one that has, like, longer loans. They're like 30% loans, but the interest rates are the same. It's like 100 8150, and people pay it. So that's where I'm like, I think if arcade or nifty fire, one of these teams did port over.
00:49:40.354 - 00:50:14.240, Speaker B: Maybe the reason the interest rates are so high over there is because, like, yo. Like, the volatility. The volatility on Solana nfts is pretty intense. Like, tensor ants have been ranging from 112 to 82 sol in the last week. So, like, there is reason why, like, ltvs are, like, 60, 70% and the interest rates are super high because the lender is taking on a bunch of risks. So I don't know. I think sharky fight does have, like, a pretty solid hold over there.
00:50:14.240 - 00:50:20.744, Speaker B: But it would be interesting to see, like, one of the ETH big dogs go over there and kind of throw their hat into the ring, mix it up.
00:50:20.784 - 00:50:29.280, Speaker A: Well, the other thing, too, is, like, I'm sure we'll see, quote unquote, blue chip nfts rise out of the Solana ecosystem.
00:50:29.312 - 00:50:29.872, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:50:29.968 - 00:50:36.284, Speaker A: Like, the lending landscape will probably completely change depending on how. How liquidity inflows into Solana.
00:50:36.704 - 00:51:15.174, Speaker B: Well, and it was, it was just today that tensor and mad lads announced a partnership. Um, we don't know anything about it. It literally was just posted 4 hours ago. It just says soon, and it's the two logos and then, um, them saying that they're collaborating. So I don't know if that is something to do with the token, something to do with the backpack wallet. Like, nobody knows anything at this point, but it is nice to see kind of, that would be the equivalent of bored apes and Azuki coming in at the peak and just saying, like, all right, yeah, we're going to collaborate on something like that would be huge. So it is kind of cool to see the Solana ecosystem and the big time NFT collections really kind of partner up together.
00:51:15.334 - 00:51:26.314, Speaker A: Yeah, we're almost at the hour, but I think to wrap it up, dalton, we want to switch gears and talk about some djenny airdrop farming opportunities.
00:51:27.814 - 00:51:31.140, Speaker B: You first. What are you, what are you. What are you looking at?
00:51:31.262 - 00:51:39.584, Speaker A: So there are a couple of things that I'm farming because I've entered into my farmer era. Air. Oh, God. Era.
00:51:39.704 - 00:51:40.644, Speaker B: I got you.
00:51:41.104 - 00:52:14.688, Speaker A: Yeah. Obviously, I have money bridged over to blast, which is sitting collecting points. I have blur tokens that are also sitting collecting points, which is great. But since you've red pilled me into Solana, I was like, yes, thank you. It's been really fun. I've been doing like a little loop between marginfi and Camino, which are lending platforms on Sol. Not NfT specific, but you provide liquidity you can borrow, think like the aave of soul, if you will.
00:52:14.688 - 00:52:27.898, Speaker A: So I have a little system going back and forth between margin, find Camino and then parcel. Ever since you were started talking to me about parcels, like, their app is so cool.
00:52:28.066 - 00:52:29.094, Speaker B: It's so good.
00:52:29.674 - 00:53:07.786, Speaker A: Yeah, ux UI is super clean. I think it's like fairly under farmed. And the fact that you can, like, I really love airdrop farming, specifically airdrop farms or airdrops that reward people that are interacting with the platform because you actually get to explore and play. And like, I think that's the best way to learn in this space is just get in there and like, see what happens. But like, I'm longing and shorting the housing market right now and I'm providing some liquidity and I'm getting some points for it. And there's definitely like this psychological thing where like every day I just like check it. Just to check it, you know what I mean?
00:53:07.810 - 00:53:44.596, Speaker B: That's cool. I think that parcel team is, they're bringing something on chain that we haven't really had exposure to. So I, I think that that could be big time. That being said, there's, I think the other day I checked, there's like 60K people that have been providing liquidity, liquidity over there so that I'm not super bullish on because like, how big could that airdrop really be? I don't know. Uh, that being said, like, I think if you're going to farm it, I would definitely recommend getting an HoA, uh, the parcel nft. Um, and then kind of like Jen is doing like trading the housing market, maybe get some, some leverage action in there.
00:53:44.660 - 00:53:51.824, Speaker A: Listen, sir, I am in like the top 6000 wallets, almost the top 5000 wallets.
00:53:51.904 - 00:53:53.484, Speaker B: Bump that up. Those are rookie.
00:53:53.984 - 00:53:59.608, Speaker A: I plan on being in like the top, like 500 there eventually. Top 100, you know.
00:53:59.656 - 00:54:00.520, Speaker B: There we go.
00:54:00.672 - 00:54:04.280, Speaker A: Slowly but surely after Popcat comes their pop cat.
00:54:04.312 - 00:54:23.296, Speaker B: What is Popcat out right now? I'm saying 9 million, 10,000,009.4. Okay, so here's, here's your drawback. Cool. Well, thank you for sharing. Um, it's also really nice having you over on Solana because like, even like Camino finance and marginfi. I haven't been playing around with that. I haven't been looping anything.
00:54:23.296 - 00:54:55.490, Speaker B: Um, I've been kind of focusing on other areas. I do. I will be receiving Jupiter at the end of the month, which I think is going to be a huge. A huge airdrop, um, that I do plan on buying. Um, just because, like, I think that if history repeats itself, like, jito was a massive airdrop and Jupiter is used by literally anybody and everybody that does trade on Solana. So I think that that could be a massive, massive, massive pump in terms of just, like, usage, new users coming over. Like, I think that that is going to be.
00:54:55.490 - 00:55:04.254, Speaker B: And that's. They have four rounds of airdrops, I believe. So, like, being able to farm the. The future airdrops is going to be big over there. So use the DCA tool and, like, the limit buys and stuff.
00:55:05.354 - 00:55:32.930, Speaker A: Speaking of Jupiter, I do just have to say that platform blew my mind away. As someone who has mostly used uniswap to do all of my swapping, to go somewhere and to be able to just, like, on chain set limit orders, do the DCA features. Like, it is just so feature rich. It's like, why isn't something like this on ETH? I don't know. Maybe because it's super expensive to transact.
00:55:33.082 - 00:55:45.106, Speaker B: There you go. I was going to say Solana's for the pores. Um, no. So I. I do think that paying attention to that drew bear drop is going to be big time like that if. If it launches. So right now, I think it's sitting between, like, 70 and $0.80
00:55:45.106 - 00:56:02.638, Speaker B: is, like, the pre. The pre drop market for Jupiter. That's a pretty high fdv. But that being said, like, geo was a pretty high fdv. And I don't think that there's going to be any token unlocks in 2024. So, like, I don't know. That's just what I'm doing.
00:56:02.638 - 00:56:23.726, Speaker B: Again, not financial advice, it's just how I'm playing it. Um, other things that I'm paying attention to, I have to say. Ox omnia from the protectorate team red pilled me on Tia Celestia, so I had zero. Zero exposure to cosmos. I don't understand cosmos. I didn't understand the wallet. I've never bridged.
00:56:23.726 - 00:56:45.886, Speaker B: I've never done anything with Cosmos. I've spent the entire fucking week bridging to Cosmos. Um, so it has been really cool to kind of see what's been going on over there. I don't know if you're familiar with the dimension airdrop. That just happened. So I received a bunch of dimension from actually owning and staking a tensorian and then also using wormhole and stuff. So that's been cool.
00:56:45.886 - 00:57:07.498, Speaker B: But that was kind of the. The first intro to, like, okay, what the hell is Tia? Because tia stakers, people that had one Tia staked. Tia is right now, like, 15, $16.01. T estaked, got 250. Dimension dimension was, like, priced at like $7.50, like, pre, the pre market drop kind of market value. So.
00:57:07.498 - 00:57:26.880, Speaker B: Wow, that's crazy for staking $13, and then all of a sudden, you're getting that drop, right. So that kind of, like, perks my ears up. And then you have the manta airdrop coming up, and the manta airdrop for Celestia stakers has not. The snapshot has not been taken. They've. They've publicly announced that yet, so. And this was just, like, six days ago.
00:57:26.880 - 00:58:09.844, Speaker B: Um, so that's something that I'm definitely paying attention to. I made a Kepler wallet, and I made multiple wallets. Um, so I'm going to be kind of trying to hit the minimum on some of this stuff and, like, really try to farm away on this with multiple accounts, because I know that there was one person, I believe NfT stats kind of pointed them out. They had one soul staked in 23 wallets for Jito, and they made, like, 600k or something like that. Um, so that was huge, right? Yeah. Um, something that I'm kind of paying attention to, and I'm bullish long term on celestia. So I think that it being at 15, $16 right now is, like, a very easy access point to get some tia staked in different wallets.
00:58:09.844 - 00:58:35.260, Speaker B: My game plan is I have Celestia that I'm staking natively, and then I also have their LST, which is like the cheeto of celestia, which is called Milky Way. So then they have milk tia. So I have steak tia, and then I have milk tia, which is, like, the liquid staking token for tia. Um, so I have, like, at least three of each in multiple wallets. Is that enough to hit the minimum? I have no fucking idea. So don't listen to me. This is just what I'm doing.
00:58:35.260 - 00:59:04.168, Speaker B: Like, I would put probably at least a minimum of ten tia and ten milk tia into things, but it's kind of interesting because, like, milk tia milk tia stakers have yet to receive these airdrops because they're. They're not natively staked. So, like, the milk tia stakers have missed the dimension airdrop. They've missed these other airdrops. But there is, like, rumors that there are at least 14 airdrops coming to celestia stakers, and that, dude, airdrops could be nothing, right? It could be like.
00:59:04.216 - 00:59:08.600, Speaker A: Yeah, that could also be, like, $600,000.
00:59:08.632 - 00:59:20.372, Speaker B: Yes. Well, exactly. If you. If you. If you hit something like a jito or something like that, that becomes, like, a big time opportunity. Um, so that said, do your own due diligence. Like, pay attention to it.
00:59:20.372 - 00:59:34.732, Speaker B: But, like, milk. Tia and Tia are two things that I am farming heavy heavily, because, like, I think this mana airdrop is really under farmed. Um, and they have announced that there, it is going to go to Tia stakers. So getting some of that action, I think, would be worth it.
00:59:34.868 - 00:59:38.732, Speaker A: Yeah. They manta closed their bridge, though, right? To do the bridge over.
00:59:38.868 - 00:59:46.474, Speaker B: Yeah. But they haven't taken the snapshot on Tia, and I don't know if they closed the bridge. I haven't bridged any ETH over there, so, like, I could completely miss this one.
00:59:47.534 - 00:59:52.310, Speaker A: I'll have to look at that. I have a. I have a link. I have a referral link if you want it.
00:59:52.382 - 00:59:52.590, Speaker B: Cool.
00:59:52.622 - 00:59:58.034, Speaker A: Because I thought they closed on the 31st, but you know me. I was too busy popping, popping, popping.
00:59:58.334 - 00:59:59.514, Speaker B: Oh, God.
01:00:00.814 - 01:00:05.174, Speaker A: I don't know. I need to rotate into some stuff with fundamentals and. Not me.
01:00:05.214 - 01:00:21.288, Speaker B: Yeah, well, no, look, at the end of the day, like, my entire thing that I'm thinking about is just like, okay, life. We have Celestia now and the cosmos ecosystem. I have Solana exposure. I have doge exposure. I have bitcoin ordinals exposure, and then I have ETH exposure. I'm, like, having exposure to all of these different ecosystems is. That's how you win.
01:00:21.288 - 01:00:41.364, Speaker B: And let me tell you, fucking starting a Kepler wallet and opening multiple wallets was a massive fucking pain in the ass. Like, a massive pain in the ass. And so, like, each wallet has different seed phrases, and I'm, like, writing all the shit down. I'm just like, dude, this is a pain in the fucking ass. Now, that is where you make that. That barrier to entry is where you make money, right?
01:00:41.404 - 01:00:45.744, Speaker A: So you do that. You do the little bit of, like, hard work required.
01:00:46.284 - 01:00:53.780, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. Well, Jen, thank you for. For pushing through. I know we're both not feeling very well, but I. It was nice to see you.
01:00:53.852 - 01:01:08.900, Speaker A: It's good seeing you, too, homie. Next week, I think my brain will be a little bit more clear. Hopefully, but I hope you feel better, too. And guys, thanks for tuning in. Hopefully you enjoyed the show. We're going to get back at it. You can expect to see us every week.
01:01:09.052 - 01:01:10.492, Speaker B: Next week. Let's do it again.
01:01:10.628 - 01:01:12.476, Speaker A: Let's go. All right. Thanks, guys.
01:01:12.580 - 01:01:13.644, Speaker B: See you. Bye.
