00:00:01.960 - 00:00:27.004, Speaker A: All right, I gotta show the links real quick. What?
00:00:30.624 - 00:00:35.164, Speaker B: My computer's so slow. I hate it so much.
00:00:39.184 - 00:01:14.364, Speaker A: All right, I'm good on my end. Dalton's gotta. Gotta get his. His socials out. We got daddy back with the blue light red glasses.
00:01:16.344 - 00:01:18.552, Speaker B: I feel pretty sexy in that, not gonna lie.
00:01:18.688 - 00:01:23.292, Speaker A: I mean, you're giving me, like, say it. You know?
00:01:23.348 - 00:01:24.144, Speaker B: Say it.
00:01:26.604 - 00:01:38.304, Speaker A: I don't know if I can say what I want to say, but I agreed. I'm getting. I'm getting that, like, old nineties, like, little swag from you.
00:01:40.564 - 00:01:47.024, Speaker B: Okay, cool. I'm good. That's all I can do.
00:01:49.204 - 00:01:50.780, Speaker A: All right, bro.
00:01:50.812 - 00:02:02.372, Speaker B: I desperately need to get a new computer. I think it's hitting that point. I have, like, 15 different wallets on my computer. I, like, I just. Sincerely, I can't do it anymore, and.
00:02:02.388 - 00:02:04.620, Speaker A: I think I can't handle it, bro.
00:02:04.652 - 00:02:14.864, Speaker B: It keeps shutting down on me. It keeps getting super slow. I, like, go from chart to this to that. I, like, just start bouncing around. I'm just like, dude, I just can't do it anymore. So, yeah.
00:02:14.984 - 00:02:17.360, Speaker A: Sounds like it's time to take some profits.
00:02:17.512 - 00:02:19.004, Speaker B: Yeah, it really is.
00:02:19.424 - 00:02:23.600, Speaker A: Take a little bit of profits, dude. How are you?
00:02:23.792 - 00:02:24.072, Speaker B: Good.
00:02:24.088 - 00:02:25.104, Speaker A: How are you feeling?
00:02:25.264 - 00:02:44.932, Speaker B: It's been a very hectic week. I think there's just so much going on. The spaces. Like, at this point, I feel like this is the first time we've ever had massive movement across chains. Like, where we've seen ordinals popping off. We have Solana popping off. You have these airdrops going to NFT holders.
00:02:44.932 - 00:02:57.324, Speaker B: You have bitcoin, l, two s, and things like that that are starting to happen. And people are just paying attention to different things at different levels. So, yeah, it's been a lot to kind of pay attention to, but we're getting there.
00:02:57.484 - 00:03:20.740, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. I mean, like, attention. Right now, I feel like I'm like, there's cool stuff happening on cosmos. There's blast, there's ETH, there's soul. Now it's like, I'm starting to get some ordinals exposure. Thank you for forcing me to finally do that last night. But it's nice to see, like, what's crazy to me is, like, bitcoin is nearing all time highs.
00:03:20.740 - 00:03:36.654, Speaker A: Like, we are pumping ETH is over $3,000, but I feel like retail still isn't fully here yet, at least not how it was in, like, 2021. I don't know if you're getting, like, a similar vibe or a similar read on the situation, too.
00:03:37.034 - 00:04:02.810, Speaker B: Yeah, dude. Like, I think it's something that I'm really trying to feel out because I'm like, okay. Like, I'm feeling like, this, like, euphoria a little bit where you're, like, getting these airdrops, you're getting these. This exposure to the collections that you really want, but then at the same time, nobody's really talking about it. I think that that's exciting. Like, it means that we're on the right track, right? Like, we're paying attention to the right things. We're in the right groups, we're talking to the right circles.
00:04:02.810 - 00:04:18.818, Speaker B: Um, but, yeah, we haven't even had the happening yet, right? So I think that's going to be a big. A big decider, too. Like, when the happening happens, what happens to the bitcoin prices? Do we see 100k or do we see a retracement? Or, like, I don't know, a lot.
00:04:18.826 - 00:04:55.068, Speaker A: Of little less than, like, two months out now. Now that we're basically at the end of February. Um, you know, I did want to take a second because you, like, sent me this really interesting link, and I was like, oh, I actually know that team to, like, kind of reset everything because, like, I'm starting to feel the euphoria too. And I feel like when we start to get the excitement and euphorias, when we start making, like, really dumb fucking mistakes, like, I don't know, clicking on drainer links, etc. Etc. And, like, really neglecting our wallet security. So for everyone listening, this is your, you know, friendly reminder.
00:04:55.068 - 00:05:15.284, Speaker A: Make sure you have a cold wallet. Make sure you have something like, there's this chrome extension called wallet guard that basically checks every transaction, being like, is this a drainer link? Before you click to sign anything, which I highly recommend. I've been using them for years at this point and haven't gotten drained yet. Fingers crossed.
00:05:16.224 - 00:05:18.084, Speaker B: Why did he say that?
00:05:19.864 - 00:05:37.582, Speaker A: Well, I think I'll be fine as long as I keep utilizing something like that. And then I utilize multiple hot wallets. Delta, and I know you're a big multi wallet guy, too. Killing your computer. Do you have any other, like, routines that you do for, like, your security, like, wallet hygiene?
00:05:37.678 - 00:06:04.794, Speaker B: Um, I've always. So, like, across multiple chains, so I have a soul flare, I have a phantom, and then now I have a magic eating wallet, and I got a backpack wallet. So I have, like, four different, like, those are just my Solana wallets, right? And within those, I have multiple wallets on each one. And, like, yes, like, you could say that you're doing it for, like, airdrop reasons. But at the end of the day, like, I think that having multiple wallets and spreading your wallets a little bit is. It's a good idea. Right? Like, you just.
00:06:04.794 - 00:06:40.058, Speaker B: I don't know, it's always just made me feel a little bit more comfortable. I actually just downloaded wallet guard for the first time. And then I also have, it's called web three antivirus. I had never used that one either, but it basically went through and it checked all my connections on all my wallets and just let me know what's good. So now anytime I push through a transaction, I have wallet guard and I have web three antivirus that is basically just giving me the what's what. And also, this is not sponsored at all. This is just us being stoked on paying attention to this.
00:06:40.058 - 00:06:54.778, Speaker B: It was really cool just being able to check out and say, like, okay, like, there are a couple connections that I had on basically dead websites, and they were like, yo, these are high risk connections. Revoking those cost me way too much money, so you gotta do it.
00:06:54.906 - 00:07:28.806, Speaker A: Like, I. I actually try to go through once a week and revoke all my open connections, and then if I'm, like, swapping, et cetera, I only allow, like, the max allowance is, like, what I'm actually trying to spend. I think we've just, you know, I feel like no one talks about security until, like, someone gets drained really bad. But I think, like, as we go into this cycle, it's just like, being conscientious of, like, yes, like, we're here, let's make our bags, but also, like, let's make sure we're making our bags in a way that is, I don't know, safe and where we're going to be able to keep our bags well.
00:07:28.830 - 00:07:52.270, Speaker B: And it's, I think every single time somebody gets drained or there's, like, a high profile drain, people start blaming the user, and it's like, dude, if you're using metamask still, like, you just don't know. Like, you don't know what you're finding. Right. Um, so I think having some redundancy there and just being able to say, like, okay, like, this is, this is. It's just good practice. And it was really shocking for me to, like, I've never used anything like that. I was like, oh, wow, this is what I'm signing.
00:07:52.270 - 00:07:54.194, Speaker B: Yeah, it was cool.
00:07:55.224 - 00:08:26.344, Speaker A: Okay, well, now that that is set and hopefully. Again, guys, reminder, please, please, please make sure you have some security measures in place. Let's dig in. It has been an interesting, like, two weeks. We didn't go live last week because we had the 404 spaces, but a lot of, like, news has come out. I think the biggest one in terms of NFTs was obviously the Yuga acquisition of proof. And Dalton, I, like, I want to hear your thoughts on this as someone who used to be there.
00:08:26.644 - 00:08:51.084, Speaker B: Yeah. So I wrote a little bit in the show notes, just talking about what it's like to work in a space, right? Like, I think just to give a little bit of background to people here. Like, before I started working in the space, I worked in restaurants, and I played soccer. Like, that's all I did. Right. And proof gave me an opportunity to go in, and it was like, a merit based interview. Like, it was write these reports and get down into the nitty gritty of whatever ecosystem we were talking about.
00:08:51.084 - 00:09:20.332, Speaker B: Solana music, nfts, fashion, nfts, whatever. The case was super merit based process. And for somebody that was trying to enter the space without technical skills, like, yes, I knew what I was talking about with nfTs, but, like, taking that jump to go from, like, okay, this is what I do for a hobby to this is what I do professionally. It was. It was scary, right? Like, it wasn't something that I was like, oh, yeah, I had a lot of belief in myself to do it, right? Like, I had imposter syndrome, and at times, I still have imposter syndrome. Like, this. This industry that we work in, none of us see each other eye to eye.
00:09:20.332 - 00:09:41.754, Speaker B: None of us see each other face to face. We're all working remote. It's like, it's kind of daunting at times, right? To be completely by yourself and stuff like that. And so, like, shout out to Kevin, shout out to Derek. Some of the people over there that gave me an opportunity and had, like, just, they looked at. Looked me eye to eye and said, like, okay, like, tell us what you know and what you believe in and stuff like that. And they gave me that opportunity, so that was really cool.
00:09:41.754 - 00:10:22.428, Speaker B: Seeing them get acquired by Yougo was something I never thought I would see. Like, honestly, like, we talked about it well, yeah, all the people that worked there, we were just like, okay, like, if somebody were to buy us out, like, who would it be? What would that process kind of look like? And I think towards the tail end of what we were experiencing, like, layoffs happen in October of 2023. You could feel it the last six months. It was just like, the morale of the team was just going down. Like, there were ideas and leadership just weren't sold on those ideas, and it just. We. There's no fluency, so it's exciting to see them get acquired.
00:10:22.428 - 00:10:48.660, Speaker B: I think the art space is better with proof. Like, I think that these guys have great connections with museums, with artists. They're great collaborators. They throw great events. Like, I think that's something that Yuga can learn a lot from. Like, obviously Yuga does ape fest and stuff like that, but I think Maggie, who's, like, the head of events over there, is just unbelievable. And so, like, to have a clubhouse or to have something like that and to have collaborations across the space would be really badass.
00:10:48.660 - 00:11:02.108, Speaker B: So congrats to them, to the people that are still there. I wish them the best of the luck. But at the end of the day, like, it's very pvP, very competitive, and we'll see. Everybody eats, but then, like, people, like, go at each other, right?
00:11:02.156 - 00:11:27.168, Speaker A: So, yeah, well, what I thought was interesting was the acquisition was all stock. Did you see that? Like, zero cash. And, you know, there's been a lot of different takes on the timeline, but I think what Yuga Labs is already, it's considered a unicorn in this space. I remember the first time they raised years ago, I was like, wait, Yuga raised how much money? I think it was like over 100 million. Like, that sounds about right.
00:11:27.216 - 00:11:27.448, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:27.496 - 00:12:15.270, Speaker A: Cause I just remember it was, like, some astronomical number that I was like, what? So for them to basically be able to acquire proof, not have to give up any equity over to, like, investors and not have to raise a down round, I actually think was super strategic. But what's been really interesting is, like, the shift in leadership, too. Like, did you see Garga has now stepped back in as CEO of Yuga Labs, and, like, they're splitting off apes into, like, a subsidiary. And so that makes me wonder if there were some operational hurdles that have not really allowed for the basie team to, like, build what they wanted to build, does that make sense? Because, like, who does a restructure like that? Unless. Unless there's something.
00:12:15.342 - 00:12:50.056, Speaker B: Dude, look, so I think. I think this is one of the things that we see in this space all the time, right? Like, if you talk about the most successful founders in this space, who do we go to? Lucanettes, Frank. The gods. Like, these guys that are young cats that are just, like, they're in the arena and they want to be in the arena. Like, caro, like, wasn't in the arena and he had already made his bag, right? Like, I think that that's something that you see with these founders, it's like web three is, is very intense. Like, it's 24/7 both of us wake up every single day to news on our telegram or somebody's doing something. Like, it's twenty four seven.
00:12:50.056 - 00:13:18.960, Speaker B: And I think the only founder that's probably an outlier in that is probably meme lamp, Ray chan. Like, I think Ray is like, they nine gag is huge, right? Yeah, I think he just loves what he does. So I don't know. I think this is an industry for the young bucks that kind of want to throw their weight around and not necessarily like, the Activision CEO. Like, I'm sure this guy came in and was like, dude, this is a lot. Yeah, that's just my take. I don't know the guy.
00:13:18.960 - 00:13:20.904, Speaker B: Like, I could be completely wrong, but.
00:13:20.944 - 00:14:15.734, Speaker A: I think, I think you're onto something. I think, like, Yuga, because I remember reading some of their announcements, you know, I don't have exposure to the Yuga ecosystem anymore, but it always, like, the last year has felt very corporate and very bummed up and, like, we're here to increase efficiency and, like, focus on some of these core goals. But I think, like, that is just not in line with the web three ethos. I think to your point, these younger teams, whether that's Luca, Frank or even, like, the Azuki founders. Zagavon 02:00 p.m. And all of them, like, they're younger and I think they're way more in touch with, like, the culture of web three. And I'm realizing more and more in, like, the last, I would say, couple of months as I've been immersing myself more in the space, how important culture actually is, because I think it drives a lot of, like, purchase behavior and, like, you know what I mean?
00:14:16.234 - 00:14:32.906, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, especially, especially in nfts, right? Like, NFT, dude, that is their culture. Coins like that. We talk about it all the time, getting people excited about buying something. We see the same movement with meme coins and stuff like that. But I think NFTs are a little bit deeper than we talked about this. Like, the lazy lion acquisition and things like that.
00:14:32.906 - 00:14:56.618, Speaker B: Like, not necessarily super bullish on that, but I could be wrong. Maybe these are, like, young founders that want to throw their weight around and really want to find their own niche and maybe that works, right? I think. Is it compai pandas? They're super deep in, like, the UFC Mma space. Like that. That's a very niche kind of project that has success. And I think. I think the last time I looked at them, they were over 60.
00:14:56.618 - 00:15:04.484, Speaker B: Soul floor. So that's huge, right? Like, these guys are kind of same thing as Luca and. Oh, my God. Fungi.
00:15:04.784 - 00:15:07.004, Speaker A: Oh, hey, there he is.
00:15:08.904 - 00:15:10.584, Speaker B: But, yeah. Yeah.
00:15:10.704 - 00:15:25.004, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting. We'll see how it goes this year for them. I'm excited. I feel like all my eight friends have been kind of, like, feeling a little down. And I think this kind of injected some life into them, which, you know, overdue.
00:15:25.304 - 00:15:37.764, Speaker B: I was like, bro, like, as soon as the news broke, I like, all the moon birds are like, yay. And, like, all the apes are like, dude, fuck this shit. But then, like, the news had gone and stuff. I think. I think they're rallying around it, so we'll see what happens.
00:15:38.864 - 00:15:49.704, Speaker A: Speaking of, just, like, other news market news on the timeline, did you ever do the portal coin farming? No, don't. Don't look at me like that. Like you're above it. Get out of here.
00:15:49.744 - 00:15:50.664, Speaker B: Did you do it?
00:15:50.784 - 00:15:51.696, Speaker A: Yeah, like a few.
00:15:51.760 - 00:15:53.684, Speaker B: This is. This was before we were friends.
00:15:54.704 - 00:15:57.524, Speaker A: You're all like, if I would have saw that, I never would have.
00:15:58.784 - 00:16:10.236, Speaker B: Dude, I don't know. How did you feel? I, like, I think similar to blur, how blur did points. I think portal kind of did something good here and, like, everybody muted it and, like, nobody wanted to hear about it anymore.
00:16:10.420 - 00:16:47.108, Speaker A: But did you see on the timeline, like, the people that got points, like, we're looking at pre trading markets, and people are like, they're up big from literally deploying no capital, just social engagement. I. So, you know, I'm a nerd. I like anime. I play video games here and there in my free time. Why are you looking at me like that? Dalton's always giving me these judgy eyes, just stabbing me in the face. But when I went through their website, I was like, this is actually pretty cool and interesting.
00:16:47.108 - 00:17:29.171, Speaker A: Like, to kind of have an aggregator for all web three games across chains in one spot and have it be like the steam of web three. I was like, that's pretty fucking bullish. So, yeah, I farmed it a little bit. But honestly, you know, web three gaming is really cool. I've fucked around and I found out. But I think where it gets really exciting for me is, like, the NFT assets within games. Like, what do these online, in game economies look like? What does the financialization of these assets look like? And, like, does that open up a whole new market? Like a legitimized, decentralized market around in game assets? That's kind of where, you know, probably going to be paying much more attention.
00:17:29.307 - 00:17:41.475, Speaker B: Dude, I don't know anything about web three gaming. I really like. That's just one thing that I. I know of Nifty island, because I feel like they're, like, the most mainstream. I'm like, okay, and there's, like, another one. It's like, star. Star something.
00:17:41.475 - 00:17:46.539, Speaker B: Star atlas on me. No, my web three.
00:17:46.651 - 00:18:00.562, Speaker A: Look at you. Well, I don't know. We're gonna have to do, like, a day where you and I just go and we play a bunch of games. When you get a new computer, just to feel it out, it's important that we know. We need to know, like, what's happening over there. You know, like, got it.
00:18:00.658 - 00:18:01.498, Speaker B: Got it. Uh huh.
00:18:01.546 - 00:18:02.458, Speaker A: I'm just saying.
00:18:02.626 - 00:18:03.802, Speaker B: I'll watch you play.
00:18:03.938 - 00:18:18.014, Speaker A: Okay, fine, whatever. But the airdrop is coming. Binance is confirmed to list. It's pumping. But I think there's also a couple of other airdrops that have happened. Do you want to dig into that?
00:18:18.384 - 00:18:58.230, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think kind of what we were just talking about right there, and, like, the most important takeaway for me is, like, we've talked about it before, and we're going to get into it a little bit later with. With blast and stuff like that. But I think what blur did with, like, kind of establishing this points meta, I think, was really big. And I think what portal did a really good job of is, like, this really hardcore social media push. And now kind of what we're seeing as, like, this next iteration of, like, who gets points and things like that is like, and look, you and I both are multiple wallet spreaders. Like, we talk about, like, strategy with these kind of things and, like, how to go about playing the game and whatever.
00:18:58.230 - 00:19:29.194, Speaker B: And I think that, like, as an anti civil kind of response, these platforms are trying to find, like, true hardcore holders that are not going to be multiple wallet spreading with $87 in their bank account. And, like. Like, you get what I'm saying? Like, yeah, we saw this happen on Cheeto. We saw this happen on TIA. We've seen this happen across the board. And I think these collections and these platforms are starting to get a little bit smarter about, like, airdropping to blue chip. Blue chip NFT collectors.
00:19:29.194 - 00:19:50.170, Speaker B: So this week, we saw a few of those come in. But, like, first things first, how do you feel about what we're seeing with these NFT, the airdrops to NFT holders? Do you think that this is, like, kind of game changing, or, like, do you think it's a waste of time? How do you think that the valuation of these NFTs is going to kind of evolve over time. What's your take on that?
00:19:50.242 - 00:20:48.906, Speaker A: Well, I like it because I feel like it adds a whole new level of, like, validation around the value of community. Like, it's not like any random NFT project is being airdropped, right? These are projects that have proven that anytime they put out a tweet, it's going to get sent to, like, the frickin Twitter or x stratosphere in terms of engagement. And I think tapping into that, just like, putting my marketing hat back on, like, it's actually really, really smart. You go for targeted communities, for user acquisition, and if your product is super sticky, like, generally they'll stay around. I think that was very much the go to market strategy that we, that I had when I was working at an NFT lending platform was like, how do we specifically target, like, the bored apes and the mutants to start? And then it was like, okay, how do we expand that into another collection? So I. I'm super into it. Wish I held more blue chips, right?
00:20:48.970 - 00:21:05.570, Speaker B: Well, and I think that that's kind of what we saw. And this is something that we learned from the last cycle. Right? It's like, sometimes it's hard to buy blue chips because you're just like, I don't really want to get. I don't want to put $60,000 into something that's illiquid. Right? That was last. And now we're starting to see liquidity come about. You have fractionalization.
00:21:05.570 - 00:21:47.022, Speaker B: You have all these different opportunities to get exposure, whether you're a small fish trying to get exposure to bored apes, or whether you're a massive fish that just wants liquidity. Right? Like, I think that that's really interesting. That being said, that there's still this priority of holding a whole NFT, right? Like, yeah, holding half of a bored ape does nothing for you. Holding a full bored ape now gets you airdrops, right? One of the most interesting things about this whole process is like, the fact that they're going cross chain. So to this point, let's talk about the first airdrop. This was dimension, I believe was the first one that kind of, that was like the first, like, notable one, right? So dimension, we've talked about on the show before. It's basically part of the modular blockchain ecosystem.
00:21:47.022 - 00:22:14.436, Speaker B: Like we talked about Celestia. This is dimension. And dimension is currently sitting at, let's see, $7.15. And this $715 per token was gifted to pudgy penguins. Pudgy penguins like that for the first kind of massive kind of. You're talking about like, the marketing campaign, right? Pudgy penguins are talking about this all the time. I think they were given 1315 tokens.
00:22:14.436 - 00:22:27.384, Speaker B: Something like that. Yeah. And right now that the 1315 allocation is just about ten k, which. Dude, that's massive. Like, these are. These are massive numbers just for holding a pudgy penguin.
00:22:28.164 - 00:22:37.196, Speaker A: And you have to keep in mind that most people that bought pudgies bought pudgies around two ETH when ETH was like, nothing like their pudgies are paid for.
00:22:37.380 - 00:22:47.316, Speaker B: Right. At this point, when it was like, over half of the collection hasn't been sold in over a year of punch. Yeah.
00:22:47.460 - 00:22:49.028, Speaker A: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.
00:22:49.116 - 00:22:53.668, Speaker B: I think it was like 60 something percent. Hasn't. Hasn't been traded in a year.
00:22:53.796 - 00:22:54.404, Speaker A: Wow.
00:22:54.524 - 00:22:55.356, Speaker B: Isn't that crazy?
00:22:55.420 - 00:22:58.428, Speaker A: Diamond hands? It really is community members.
00:22:58.556 - 00:23:16.360, Speaker B: But then there's this other collection. Give me 1 second. I'm trying to share my screen. So this is where I think it's interesting. So dimension is obviously within the cosmos ecosystem. Cosmos is not necessarily known for its NFT ecosystem by any means. But look at this chart.
00:23:16.360 - 00:23:40.432, Speaker B: So this is like, I guess, the bluest of blue chips for the cosmos ecosystem. It's called bad kids. Back on December 7, this was going for $368. This is just like two months ago, right? $368. Today's price, over eight k. They've been given the Tia airdrop. They've been given the dimension airdrop.
00:23:40.432 - 00:23:56.112, Speaker B: Now they're going to be given other airdrops that are on the ETH side of things. So it's just like this whole idea of what is a blue chip and why you hold things become. It's changing the game.
00:23:56.208 - 00:24:40.764, Speaker A: Honestly, you're just making me kind of think, like, it goes back to the culture comment we had earlier, but it's like, I think one for ecosystems, NFT culture takes way longer to develop than any of the Djenny meme coin, et cetera, et cetera plays. And it's so smart. Sorry, Dalton. Processing all the knowledge that you dropped it just really is smart because it, again, provides more value. And I think it helps actually foster the culture that exists on these chains. Like, that chart is insane. To go from $300 to over eight grand and have that be fueled by airdrops.
00:24:40.924 - 00:24:54.964, Speaker B: Well, and be given a $15,000 airdrop. They got the celestial airdrop. And I don't think it's stopping. Right. Because then it becomes like, you're saying part of the culture. And that's the reason why you hold. And, like, we're in one of the group chats and it was talking about, does.
00:24:54.964 - 00:25:40.206, Speaker B: Do you think that these airdrops kind of, how should I say this? Like, does it impact taking out loans against nfts? And I was like, wow, that's actually something I haven't really thought about, but I definitely think it could. Right? Because if you're not staking your tensorian, you're not getting that drop. If you're, if that, if you're doing something with your, like, if it's fractionalized, you're not getting that drop, right? So I think it really does kind of play to, like, the diamond hands mentality. And now that we have underlying liquidity on most blue chip nft collections, I think people are more. They're holding them easier, right. Because, like, they're expecting things. And like, let's touch on the next one.
00:25:40.206 - 00:26:10.904, Speaker B: Right? We have wormhole coming out this week, or at least the, like, the allocations and stuff like that are coming out this week. They've already mentioned that they're going to be giving airdrops to d gods and Ute's. They're also going to be going to mad lads and I think they're also going to be going to bad kids. D gods and ute's makes sense there because out of. So the snapshot was taken, I believe, just, just maybe a month ago. Yeah. And there was only 51,000 transactions on wormhole from Solana.
00:26:10.904 - 00:26:16.036, Speaker B: That's fucking insane. That was the only bridge out of Solana that I had ever used.
00:26:16.220 - 00:26:23.964, Speaker A: How many? How many d gods and ute's bridged using 23,000. Insane. I think it's going to be a gnome.
00:26:24.004 - 00:26:27.384, Speaker B: That's fucking crazy. That's crazy.
00:26:27.884 - 00:26:39.042, Speaker A: And I'm like, half of that. It's actually kind of really funny. It's like wormhole, this massive, like, infrastructure company that has like, a valuation over hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:26:39.178 - 00:26:44.010, Speaker B: 2.5 billion. 2.5 billion they raised last month.
00:26:44.162 - 00:26:56.834, Speaker A: Oh, my God. So massive company, massive unicorn. 50,000 transactions. Half of those were d gods and ute's bridges. That's crazy.
00:26:56.954 - 00:27:18.080, Speaker B: I was trying to, like, do the math and I was like, the math's not mapping. I don't understand how this is. And then I'm like, sitting there and I'm like, bro, I probably bridged 50 times. Like, I at least bridged 50 times. And like, base, I bridge out of base with wormhole. So I go base to ETH. And, like, I've.
00:27:18.080 - 00:27:32.034, Speaker B: I've just always used wormhole as, like, my go to bridge. And I'm like, when I saw that there's only 51,000 transactions out of Solana on wormhole, I was like, dude, this might be a massive, massive airdrop for, for people that actually use it.
00:27:32.534 - 00:27:47.966, Speaker A: Well, fingers crossed. I hope you get your bag when you say you, because I. I've never, like, stuck to dedicated bridge. It just depends on, like, what, um, platform I'm on. When you say wormhole bridge, are you using all bridge?
00:27:48.110 - 00:27:56.794, Speaker B: Because that's like, okay, so back in the day. Back in the day, wormhole. Wormhole was wormhole bridge, and then it became portal bridge.
00:27:57.374 - 00:28:03.902, Speaker A: Got it. I'm going to need to check that out because I'm using. I've been using all bridge. I used to use multi chain a lot.
00:28:04.078 - 00:28:20.030, Speaker B: I think all bridge is getting. I'll have to send you a tweet. There's a tweet somewhere. I would look it up right now, but my computer would crash. But I think all bridge might be getting. What? We'll check after the call. But if it is, like, you could be in for a surprise.
00:28:20.182 - 00:28:21.074, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:28:21.444 - 00:28:33.812, Speaker B: Yeah, but like, like you said, like, so wormhole, back in the day, this is like 2022. They got hacked for 300. It's like 320 million or $330 million.
00:28:33.908 - 00:28:35.332, Speaker A: I remember that hack.
00:28:35.468 - 00:28:53.094, Speaker B: Yeah. And then jump bailed them out and then now they just raised 225 million as of last month at $2.5 billion valuation. And I'm like this, it's, I don't know. Again, it pays to be curious. Right? Like, it pays to be curious. It pays to kind of go down the rabbit hole.
00:28:53.094 - 00:28:55.054, Speaker B: So we'll see what happens.
00:28:55.634 - 00:29:24.600, Speaker A: Fingers crossed. Ooh, speaking of more cross chain drops, the arcade drop, the clash of the claims situation that they had going on. So for those of you guys who don't know, arcade is a peer to peer lending platform. It's on ethereum, and they have basically announced their arcade token. They've had a point system in place for. Feels like a while now. Like they're slowly getting the distribution out there.
00:29:24.600 - 00:30:08.504, Speaker A: I don't think arcade is tradable or transferable yet, but people are starting to claim. Yeah, I think it needs a Dow vote, is what they said. Like, waiting for the Dow to vote on it. But basically what they just recently did in the last week was they held a raffle of 4000 wallets and you. And basically, if you won in this raffle, you would get a drop from arcade. I think it was like 750 arcade tokens per winner, something like that. And if you had a pudgy penguin, little pudgy sappy seal node monks, tensorian bitcoin puppets, mad lads, and I think, yeah, arc.
00:30:08.504 - 00:30:21.396, Speaker A: So basically, they're tapping into ordinals, Solana and other ETH collections. You could submit your wallet to basically qualify for the claim, which I thought was insane. Pretty cool. I didn't get it.
00:30:21.580 - 00:30:23.224, Speaker B: I got it on two wallets.
00:30:23.724 - 00:30:27.744, Speaker A: You got it on two wallets, and I didn't get it on my little pudgy.
00:30:28.124 - 00:30:54.648, Speaker B: Okay. But, hey, to put it into perspective here, I did one loan on my d God. Right? So it was 2.8. No, it was 4200 USDC for a d God. Um, it was, like, 40 days, and then I ended up paying it back, and that was that. Right? On my 1d God loan, I had 1150 points. And so, like, yes, it's going to be, like, a free stimmy.
00:30:54.648 - 00:31:05.410, Speaker B: I don't really expect it to be too big. Like, maybe $1,000, $2,000 maybe, which, like, that. That's epic, right? Like, I'm not saying that that's.
00:31:05.442 - 00:31:12.306, Speaker A: I mean, if you put that into, like, scale of, like, people who are lending there, who are borrowing constantly, it'll.
00:31:12.330 - 00:31:31.194, Speaker B: Be an exciting, like. It really. It really is. There's not really that many people taking part in NFT lending. Right? Like, if you think about it, these numbers, if we're talking about things that are under farmed, I would say tensor, 100% wormhole, obviously. But y'all missed that boat. But, like.
00:31:31.194 - 00:31:41.674, Speaker B: And then you have, like, these NFT lending platforms, but, like, in reality, like, how big could these things go? Like, I don't. Do you think these things trade at a billion dollar valuation? Like, I don't.
00:31:41.834 - 00:31:51.226, Speaker A: Hold on. You think tensor is under farmed? Why are you looking at me like, I don't know. I. I collect jpegs. I don't trade them.
00:31:51.330 - 00:31:58.208, Speaker B: We need to start. We need to start market making jpegs. And you'll be. You. You could get in the top 500 within two weeks.
00:31:58.376 - 00:32:17.524, Speaker A: Okay, you're gonna. We're gonna have to do a whole session on this separately. Um, what was your question? Oh, how do I think these things trade? Dude, I love that NFT lending is under farmed, specifically NFT finance. This is why I'm, like, pretty excited about arcade. My little pudgy is just literally on, like, a cycling loan. Like, I'm just.
00:32:17.944 - 00:32:19.444, Speaker B: So you do have.
00:32:19.944 - 00:32:56.202, Speaker A: I have exposure, arcade I have exposure to arcade. Okay. How do you think I financed my Solana degenering? That turned into what? I got a loan on arcade. I adult, and we say it all the time. It's like if we think NFT finance is going to be a massive narrative in this upcoming cycle, who's best positioned for it? It's going to be the ETH, Nft lending platforms. If there's not a lot of people farming it right now, that's fine to me because I think as the bull picks up, the lending activity is going to pick up. And I think that's true.
00:32:56.202 - 00:33:10.170, Speaker A: You know, attention goes there. So it's like, of the NFT finance platforms, it's like arcade. I'm farming meta street. Did you get your meta street stuff set up? We got a, we got a triple farm coming with blast too.
00:33:10.322 - 00:33:10.690, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:10.722 - 00:33:11.122, Speaker A: Yes.
00:33:11.218 - 00:33:22.864, Speaker B: We're going to be talking about blast here in a minute. So like we'll go into that. Actually, let's use that as the segue. Yeah, I want, I want to hear more about meta street and their ascend contract and then we'll get into blast.
00:33:23.024 - 00:34:17.878, Speaker A: I think that works. Um, so basically meta street, very, very cool peer to pool NfT lending platform that has like innovated around like this tranche lending model. So you can actually specify price ranges, uh, that you would want to lend at. And when you deposit into a meta street pool, you get a liquid credit token. And this is also I think, one of their like nifty little innovations that they figured out of like, ah, well, you're basically like your liquid credit token, like represents your deposit, right? So you should be able to take that liquid credit token and go transact with it. And so what you can do, and what's going to happen is they are partnered with, I think, three apps on blast right now. You're going to be able to bridge your liquid credit token over to blast and farm, continue farming meta street as well as farming those three different apps.
00:34:18.006 - 00:34:25.214, Speaker B: So do you meant that? Hold up, what is an LCT? Can you go into that liquid credit token? Right?
00:34:25.254 - 00:34:27.670, Speaker A: It's like your, your deposit receipt.
00:34:27.822 - 00:34:33.714, Speaker B: So like you basically you have ETH and then your ETH, you go to Meta street and you mint.
00:34:35.014 - 00:34:49.514, Speaker A: Yeah, you deposit, you basically, you need to take your ethanol, then you need a wrap it to wrap staked ETH, right? So now you have like the wrapped yield bearing ETH, which is what blast is going to be natively.
00:34:50.534 - 00:34:54.070, Speaker B: We can get that. That's about, that's about 4% a year, correct.
00:34:54.182 - 00:35:19.446, Speaker A: I think so is what Lido is giving? Yeah, yeah, like four to five. Depends. Okay, so you have your wrapped staked ETH. You go to Meta street, you deposit that into their lending pool, and then you get a liquid credit token. There's two different types of liquid credit tokens that they're issuing right now, depending on which crypto punk spool you deposit into. But it's hilarious.
00:35:19.590 - 00:35:21.430, Speaker B: There's a 15 and a 30, right?
00:35:21.542 - 00:35:22.798, Speaker A: It's a 20 and a 40.
00:35:22.926 - 00:35:23.798, Speaker B: 20 and a 40.
00:35:23.886 - 00:35:40.270, Speaker A: Cool. The abbreviation for it is hilarious. It's like m wrapped staked ETH wrapped punks. Colon, 20. Yeah, it's ridiculous. But the whole idea is this liquid credit token. It's exactly what it sounds like.
00:35:40.270 - 00:36:12.636, Speaker A: It's a token that represents your credit that you deposited. So once you have that LCT, like once you deposit and you get your LCT, you're earning points. And then you can go and do like crazy defi loops. I made a video on that if anyone's interested in seeing how to set that up. But let's just say you got your liquid credit token. They're going to bridge that liquid credit token to blast. So that means now on blast, you kind of still have exposure to ETH Nft lending, and you'll be able to create, I think it's like liquidity pools.
00:36:12.636 - 00:36:27.630, Speaker A: So pairing your LCT with like, you know, wrapstaked ETH on blast through one of these apps and then you're earning points. The triple farm. I don't know. I have to, like, look more into it when they announce more details, but you got to get into that.
00:36:27.692 - 00:37:10.972, Speaker B: And I think that just TlDR on this. What is really important here and whats really important to focus in on in terms of trading NFTs and NFT lending in general is like, what happens when you give a loan? What happens when you buy an NFT? That NFt is now denominated in ETH, right? And that ETH is just sitting there. And if you rewind two years ago, the only way to make money in NFTs was to buy an NFT and make that NFt go up and down, right? Like if the floor value went up, then you made money, and if not, then you were fucked. And now we have different areas of the space that are kind of iterating, right? You have NfT perp, so you can long and short. You have like even price lock over on tensor is really cool. Like they're getting a shit ton of volume over there. You have like these.
00:37:10.972 - 00:37:40.088, Speaker B: Now we have lending right. You can have a high profile NFT. You can take a loan out on that and then you can use it. But now this LCT is basically them saying, okay, you just lent against something that is making you yield. And now you can take that receipt and say, like, okay, I have this receipt, now I'm going to go deposit it elsewhere. And that receipt is making you twelve to 15% or something around that. And then you go into these other things, and then these other things are making you four or five, 8%, whatever.
00:37:40.088 - 00:38:04.254, Speaker B: So now instead of making 12%, you're making 20% to 25%. And it's a, it's a pretty big unlock. Now I am scared because what happens when all of this shit starts unraveling? I don't know. I don't want to be around. But we don't talk about that yet right now. It's innovative and it's really cool, but I would just say lend carefully and pay attention to what you're doing. If you don't know.
00:38:04.254 - 00:38:14.358, Speaker B: Jen has put out some really badass videos covering this stuff and also slide into our DM's. We are more than happy to riff on this stuff. You guys have questions?
00:38:14.526 - 00:38:45.954, Speaker A: Absolutely. So like, we'll segue this into blast basically. You know, meta street is a way to get exposure to NFT lending. They have some really, really cool like protocol designs. And then within their points program there's going to be a triple farm with blast. Blast. I feel like it's shocking to me because I thought everyone was bullish on blast, but the more time I spent on the timeline, I'm like, wait, people, have people forgotten about this? This, this is like a really big fucking deal.
00:38:45.954 - 00:39:21.928, Speaker A: Blast has $1.9 billion in Tvl currently, and it's still in testnet. Mainnet is not live. The cool thing about blast and what makes it unique is it's an l two that has native yield on ETH and stable coins. And that native yield on ETH is coming through ETH. Staking the native yield on stable coins is coming through things like tokenized t bills from makerdao. So the, basically the TLDR on blast is like, imagine you have a wallet on blast and you have ETH in that wallet.
00:39:21.928 - 00:39:34.884, Speaker A: That ETH is natively going to be earning yield while it sits idle in your wallet. Whether you're deploying it, not deploying it, you're earning yield, which I think is pretty cool. It's like, yeah, it's kind of like a high yield savings account that you can fuck around with.
00:39:36.024 - 00:39:41.550, Speaker B: You can degen as much as you want. You'll probably lose money, but that's fine. You're making 4%.
00:39:41.702 - 00:40:45.730, Speaker A: You are making 4% if it doesn't go to zero. But I just thought that that was a major unlock, because it's like, as I talk to my friends about this, I'm not gonna be like, okay, we're gonna set up your metamask on Ethereum or your whatever wallet on Ethereum, get you some ETH. All right, now let's go to Lido, and we're gonna stake that ETH for. For you. Like, oh, you want to buy stuff? Like, we gotta wrap that ETH, you know, to have it done natively, I think, is massive. And I think the big thing about blast, and it goes back to the culture point that we keep talking about, is, like, blast is building a culture that is literally designed for djens and point maxis and farmers. And so there's going to be a goldmine of opportunities for you to get in early on, so many different protocols, um, while earning points to one, get dropped, blast, earning points to get dropped, whatever protocol token, uh, you're working with.
00:40:45.730 - 00:40:50.242, Speaker A: And I don't know, I just think people are insufficiently bullish on it.
00:40:50.418 - 00:41:41.966, Speaker B: Yeah, I I think kind of to that point. We talk about Ponzi nomics a lot in this space, and I think it's something that is so different within crypto, right? Like, I've been learning so, so much, like, in the jobs that I do within this space, just, like, learning different ways that people trade, learning different ways that people pay attention to things and track things. At the end of the day, when you have $1.8 billion worth of money, liquidity tied up in an ecosystem that hasn't been able to move for four months, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? Like, these people haven't been able to touch anything. They're getting an airdrop. Then on top of that, you have a hyper financialized ecosystem with a founder that is, like, bullish on hyper financialization of fucking everything. I really, really, really think that this is going to be a massive unlock.
00:41:41.966 - 00:42:07.490, Speaker B: Just in general, I think across the board, whether it be nfTs, whether it be NFT finance, whether it be whatever, we're going to find loops on loops on loops that are going to, people are going to build on top of each other. Like, you're talking about this meta street to thruster, to this to that. Like, four projects deep. Like, I don't, I don't really know what is going to be built yet, but I think this is going to be like, don't leave your computer season.
00:42:07.682 - 00:42:36.638, Speaker A: I think so, too. I like, it's, it's interesting. So if you guys haven't checked it out, there is this idea doc that the blast team put out and it's like the big bang competition ideas. And if you go through it, they basically, they're like, we're looking for people to build perps, we're looking for people to build spot Dexs. We want lending platforms on here. We want some NFT gaming projects on here. I thought it was interesting that they grouped NFT finance under NFT gaming.
00:42:36.638 - 00:42:51.928, Speaker A: I was like, that's weird. Just weird to me. But then there's infrastructure, so think, like, telegram bots, bridges, et cetera, and then miscellaneous. There's like eight different categories, and social.
00:42:51.976 - 00:42:53.320, Speaker B: Fi is a big one over there, too. Right now.
00:42:53.352 - 00:43:29.774, Speaker A: Social fi is the other one. Social fi and gamble fi, those are the other two. Um, so there are these big eight categories that we know builders have submitted to every single category. And the winners of the competition are going to be announced on Friday. And the winners, it's interesting, blast basically split up their first community, airdrop, 50 50. Uh, 50% is for early adopters, so think people who deposited the other 50% is going to the developers and majority of the developer allocation goes to the winners. So we're literally going to see all of this money get unlocked.
00:43:29.774 - 00:43:51.062, Speaker A: Mainnet, go live. And I feel like this is obvious, but Mainnet is going to go live with apps. Like, the moment your money opens, there's going to be literally, like, I imagine, like 50 different opportunities for you to pursue across those eight different verticals. It's going to be fun. It's for sure. Don't leave your computer season. So you need to get a new one.
00:43:51.198 - 00:44:02.574, Speaker B: Yeah, no, literally, I. That's literally what I was thinking. I was like, do I just make it through? Don't leave your computer season with the computer that I have, or do I waste my liquidity on a computer and then find more liquid?
00:44:02.614 - 00:44:04.514, Speaker A: I'm like, we're going to find.
00:44:04.934 - 00:44:05.834, Speaker B: We'll find.
00:44:06.174 - 00:44:11.118, Speaker A: Yeah, you got some. Your wormhole liquidity that's coming to you. There you go.
00:44:11.206 - 00:44:31.514, Speaker B: No, that's buying. That's buying a mad lad. I'm sorry, guys. Well, yeah, so long story short, we're bullish on blast. I think that there's going to be some massive unlocks here. And like Jen said, this is going live with apps, right. There's going to be literally things that you can rush to buy out the gate.
00:44:31.514 - 00:44:46.326, Speaker B: So I think that we should probably do a spaces or something of that sort kind of breaking down like the who's who and get as many builders on as we can. And we should probably also throw together like an infographic or something like that just to kind of break down like the what's what.
00:44:46.430 - 00:44:48.270, Speaker A: I'm like, you already.
00:44:48.342 - 00:44:56.062, Speaker B: I was like, I was like, this is, this is Jen's territory. I'm just the guy with the glasses on right now. This is not, this is not for me.
00:44:56.158 - 00:45:41.472, Speaker A: No, definitely keep an eye out. When they do announce the winners. I do plan on doing like a pretty in depth breakdown as much as I can with that, and then we'll get an infographic out, but for sure on the spaces. Oh, the other thing that I want to say about blast that I thought was interesting, and this goes back to point Maxi's Ponzi nomics and culture, but there have been at least like five different teams that I have seen that said their entire developer allocation of blast is going to their users. And now you have people like CBB coming out saying that he is only deploying liquidity and capital to projects that have committed to giving their entire dev allocation to users. Have you seen that?
00:45:41.608 - 00:45:42.632, Speaker B: Oh, I haven't.
00:45:42.768 - 00:45:44.312, Speaker A: Oh my. I'll send you the tweet.
00:45:44.368 - 00:46:19.384, Speaker B: Um, dude, this week has been crazy. It's just been, I feel like one thing after another. Um, I do want to touch on this. I know we don't have it in the show notes, but like, what are you doing right now that people could get access to? And this is one of the things that, like, you and I talk about it all the time, working in the space, you get access and you're privileged to these conversations where it's like, it's easier for us to reach out to somebody and have these conversations because we're working and I know that we have the podcast and we can kind of translate the information to other people. What, what would you recommend to people? What is something that you're doing right now that other people could actually do as well? Like actionable Alpha?
00:46:20.244 - 00:46:56.694, Speaker A: Well, Meta street, obviously there's a link for that. I think if you're interested in getting exposure to like NFT lending, and you don't necessarily want to lend on speculative jpegs, you can go over to a platform like kettle finance and start lending against luxury watches to earn yield. I think that's it's effective and it's definitely a safer form of yield for those of you guys who aren't necessarily, like, trying to degen, like, Dalton and I. The other thing that I'm doing, too, is I'm actually. I'm staking Dalton, like, now. I like, I'm like, more so.
00:46:57.074 - 00:47:19.092, Speaker B: Like, more so. Like, what are you doing to get blast exposure on, like, testnet? Because, like, I think this is something that we have just started messing around with in the last 24 hours. And it's like, holy shit. Like, this is, if we're talking about things that are under farmed, like, this is getting into testnet and fucking around in there is actually free. Like, it's free.
00:47:19.148 - 00:47:24.756, Speaker A: Literally free. You should throw up the faucet link, or we'll tweet out the faucet link.
00:47:24.900 - 00:47:51.464, Speaker B: And I can. I can share this right now. So this is, this is the faucet. I can tweet this out later, but this is basically, once you go into blast, you're going to go into your metamask, you're going to go into your ravi wallet, whatever the case may be. Then you're going to connect your wallet. When you connect your wallet, it's just going to basically say the only requirement is that you've done one transaction on ETH mainnet. That's literally the only requirement.
00:47:51.464 - 00:48:07.024, Speaker B: So then you go down here, blast, bang, and then you put in your wallet address. Once you go from there, you just press continue. It gives you 0.01. It gives you 0.01 ETH. But this is blast sepolia, like, testnet ETH. So it's free.
00:48:07.024 - 00:48:23.464, Speaker B: It's monopoly money. And then from there, you can start going into different, uh, different arenas, different kind of projects. Um, and that's kind of what I wanted to talk about right now is like, are. Are there any projects that you are, are looking at something that you're interested in?
00:48:23.584 - 00:48:47.574, Speaker A: Yeah, um, on the Dexs, I am on thruster and blaster swap perps, I'm on particle. And then, in all honesty, you guys, I just got, like, a slew of invites in the last 24 hours. So there will be more. And I will definitely, we should both be sharing our links. So that way, if you guys want to fuck around and find out, you definitely can.
00:48:48.714 - 00:49:20.350, Speaker B: I'm like, so you're going to give me some of those links, right? Yeah, all the links. We'll do that after the show. But that I think. I think for you guys that are listening and that are interested in blast and getting access to testnet, just basically, like, like I said, actionable alpha, all my friends that have been interested in getting in the space, but have complained about not having enough money to get into the space or whatever because they think that they need to throw multiple thousands of dollars or whatever the case would be. This is gasless transactions. Like, yes, you're going to have to bridge over something. Like, it's going to cost you something.
00:49:20.350 - 00:49:42.834, Speaker B: If you don't have a metamask, you don't have a Ravi wallet. Like, if you don't have anything, you're going to have to push through a transaction on ETH mainnet just to get, like, gas and stuff like that over on blast testnet. But this is a very cheap way to get exposure to multiple airdrops. And you're doing devs a favor by doing, like, by going in here and testing shit and throwing shit at the wall. So definitely something to check out.
00:49:43.814 - 00:49:48.806, Speaker A: Yep. Ooh. Oh, my God. It's already been 15 minutes.
00:49:48.870 - 00:49:49.926, Speaker B: Okay, I know.
00:49:50.070 - 00:49:50.950, Speaker A: Solana.
00:49:51.142 - 00:50:10.004, Speaker B: Yes, let's do Solana. And then. Yeah, so basically this week, I don't really have much to talk about other than the fact that mad lads have kind of started to break out here. Um, I'll share this tab. Come on, computer, you can do it.
00:50:10.624 - 00:50:11.564, Speaker A: We believe.
00:50:11.864 - 00:50:20.364, Speaker B: And I'm like, come on. This is actually ridiculous. Okay, well, I'm. It's not happening, dude. They just, they just hit 200 soul.
00:50:20.944 - 00:50:22.524, Speaker A: Mad lads did well.
00:50:22.894 - 00:50:53.012, Speaker B: Oh, my God. So I was going to share the chart, but it's taking too long. So basically, Matlab came out this week and they, they kind of teased a second collection. That's been kind of big news. Nobody really knows what the collection is going to be, but there is a hunch that it's going to be on ordinals. But the main, the main takeaway here is the fact that Mad lads exchange is called backpack exchange. Backpack exchange came out this last week and they have already done a billion dollars in 24 hours volume.
00:50:53.012 - 00:51:18.298, Speaker B: I think that that is unreal. Okay, so if you think about this, you have Madlad sitting at a 200 soul floor. You have backpack exchange that's doing a billion dollars in 24 hours volume. You have backpack wallet that has more users than I think Phantom. And they are sitting. They have collaborations on collaborations. They're getting dimension airdrop, they're getting wormhole airdrop, they're getting airdrops on airdrops.
00:51:18.298 - 00:51:20.874, Speaker B: I'm like, why are these things sitting at 200 sold?
00:51:21.494 - 00:51:46.818, Speaker A: That's insane. A billion dollars in transaction volume. 24 hours mad lads pumping. Makes sense. I wonder, Dalton, if, like, the reason why it's not higher and this isn't like, to knock or question their centralized exchange volume, but, like, do you think most of that is organic, or do you think it's market makers coming in?
00:51:46.946 - 00:52:19.452, Speaker B: Armani put out a tweet about it because people were like, okay, that's obviously wash trading. So they have. They have a leaderboard and you can see, like, the ins and outs, and there's also, like, a 1% fee on all of this stuff. So, like, people that are taking size, they're like, okay, why would they be. Why would they be paying $60,000 in fees just to wash trade? Yeah, that would be really fucking stupid. But, like, if you think about it, math ads are tokenless. Backpack exchange that has a bunch of dapps being built on it, or backpack exchange has the billion dollars of volume.
00:52:19.452 - 00:52:26.144, Speaker B: Backpack wallet has a bunch of dapps that are being built on top of it. And then they have all of these, like, cross collaboration.
00:52:27.364 - 00:52:35.556, Speaker A: I mean, the values there, like, that dimension. Airdrop alone was probably like, oh, this paid for my mad lad and more.
00:52:35.740 - 00:53:02.596, Speaker B: Well, and they're getting wormhole. And I'm like, I. Yeah, I feel like board apes went to 400,000 and they didn't have anything. Like, they had heist when it came out. Yeah, they had hi. Like, what happens when they have hype and an exchange is doing a billion dollars a day and, like, some type of rev share and backpack wallet and all this kind of shit? I'm like, yo, I just think, yeah.
00:53:02.620 - 00:53:11.518, Speaker A: This is slept on, underexposed. How many mad lights are in your wallet right now?
00:53:11.606 - 00:53:15.142, Speaker B: Zero. I bought a D God. Instead of buying two mad lads, and.
00:53:15.158 - 00:53:17.742, Speaker A: I want to rope a little bit.
00:53:17.878 - 00:53:22.194, Speaker B: Yeah, but it is what it is.
00:53:22.734 - 00:53:42.316, Speaker A: I actually. I didn't think this was a teaser. I thought it was, like, kind of confirmed that their second collection is coming on ordinals. I saw ordinal or Ord underscore IO put up. Yeah. And it was like, all these bad lad pfps. Yeah, well, speaking of ordinals, it's been pretty interesting.
00:53:42.316 - 00:54:03.364, Speaker A: I actually bought my first ordinal last night. Thanks, Dalton, for pushing me. There was an alien node monk that sold for like $100,000. It was like 2.125 BTC, which I thought was pretty insane. Like, we're definitely seeing ordinal culture take off. And I am, again, heavily underexposed.
00:54:03.364 - 00:54:28.574, Speaker A: Liquidium, which is the lending platform. NfT lending platform on ordinals, just passed 4000 loans, which is exciting. And I think you've been digging into this a little bit more than I have. But it does make me wonder, like, with the bitcoin ETF's and obviously bitcoin, bitcoin kind of leading the charge, do you think we're going to see like a bitcoin defi summer this cycle?
00:54:29.474 - 00:54:52.810, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I think the more this is, this is kind of why I was putting this in the show notes. It's like, I feel like having exposure to ordinals. Like, dude, I was, I was a slow mover to this. Like, I tweeted about BRC twenties and I said the shitcoin market that we always wanted, and I didn't buy anything. And this was when already was at like 4 million market cap. Right. Like, I just didn't necessarily see the vision for it.
00:54:52.810 - 00:55:57.556, Speaker B: But then if you start thinking about, like, these are people that are actually using the bitcoin blockchain, like, actually pushing through transactions, actually kind of day in, day out kind of using it. So, like, I think holding an ordinal and getting access to these airdrops and getting access to, to using bitcoin boots on the ground, like, paying attention to what's going on within the ecosystem is pretty important. And that said, like, there is obviously a desire, there's a yearning for ordinal users, ordinal holders, to kind of be able to have an opportunity to use their ordinals in a way that we haven't ever seen on bitcoin. So I think that that type of, like some type of l two that you can be more nimble, you can kind of push through transactions at a faster speed. You don't see by pending bipending, bipending 30 minutes, like, uh, even just like having transactions that actually go through and you don't have to accelerate your, your, um, bitcoin transactions. I think that I would be super helpful. Um, so, yeah, I definitely do think that that's one of the reasons I'm like, I definitely need to get exposure to ordinals sooner rather than later.
00:55:57.740 - 00:56:02.564, Speaker A: Yeah, we gotta make our blast bags and then reallocate.
00:56:02.684 - 00:56:42.986, Speaker B: I'm like, okay, so wormhole to my mad lab and then blast to my ordinal. I think that that's, I think that's a plan. But speaking of this, I did have, I put this in the notes and I was like, I had one of my friends that's going to be coming over tomorrow to be setting up like his blast bag and all of that kind of stuff. He asked me last night, he was like, okay, what are your, like, top five nfts right now? Top five nfts that you don't own. How would you think about this stuff? If you're buying something right now, what would you buy? And I was like, damn. And so I list out my thing, and I actually just had a tweet the other day that was like, okay, here's my cross chain wish list. So put out my cross chain wish list.
00:56:42.986 - 00:56:47.810, Speaker B: And then he asked me, he's like, okay, would you rather have a quantum cat or a node monkey?
00:56:47.962 - 00:56:52.218, Speaker A: And I was like, you're like, I want both.
00:56:52.386 - 00:56:58.974, Speaker B: Yeah. So now I'm going to go down this list, and I'm going to ask you, would you rather have a quantum cat or a node monkey?
00:57:00.014 - 00:57:17.254, Speaker A: No, monkey, really? I know, like, quantum cats have, like, the whole, like, tap root wizard thing, but I I'm weird Dalton. I buy art that I like, and then I try to maybe flip it for money. So it's like, I would rather have a node monkey. I think they look cooler.
00:57:17.374 - 00:57:24.702, Speaker B: Okay, well, that's cool. So node monkeys are the first ten k collection on ordinals, I believe.
00:57:24.758 - 00:57:25.194, Speaker A: I think.
00:57:25.294 - 00:57:38.734, Speaker B: Pretty sure that they're the first ten k. Quantum cats are 3333. So in my opinion, I'd much rather have a quantum cat than a node monkey, but it is what it is. Node monkey or a mad lad?
00:57:40.314 - 00:57:41.374, Speaker A: Mad lad.
00:57:41.914 - 00:57:42.778, Speaker B: I agree.
00:57:42.946 - 00:57:44.194, Speaker A: I think Mad lad.
00:57:44.314 - 00:57:49.314, Speaker B: I want them both. But, like, definitely kind of for the reasons we just outlined, I definitely go mad lad.
00:57:49.434 - 00:57:55.668, Speaker A: Like, if I only had, like, capital to pick one, I would probably want that Solana exposure first.
00:57:55.796 - 00:57:56.148, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:56.196 - 00:58:14.028, Speaker A: Because I think, like, bitcoin, obviously, a lot of liquidity is going to go in there. We think. We think bitcoin happening is fairly bullish. Bitcoin going to go up, but I think in terms of returns, you'll probably see higher returns on an ecosystem like Seoul.
00:58:14.196 - 00:58:19.100, Speaker B: I agree. So then the next question would be Mad Lad or quantum cat, which are obviously. Is he going to say Mad lad?
00:58:19.132 - 00:58:21.084, Speaker A: Mad lad. What about you?
00:58:21.244 - 00:58:32.424, Speaker B: Mad lad? Okay, I want both, but I would go mad lad before I go quantum cat. And then lastly, mad lad, or two tensorians and a bitcoin puppet.
00:58:33.924 - 00:58:36.108, Speaker A: Two tensorians and a bitcoin puppet.
00:58:36.236 - 00:58:37.412, Speaker B: Really? Okay.
00:58:37.508 - 00:58:59.114, Speaker A: Because, like, I get that mad lad has, like, the exchange, but you just told me earlier, tensor is heavily under fire armed. Tensor is going to be the blur of Solana. And the way that team builds is pretty fucking bullish. And so, so if I get. If I could have that exposure on soul and then a bitcoin.
00:58:59.534 - 00:59:00.274, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:00.654 - 00:59:02.278, Speaker A: Were you going to say mad lads?
00:59:02.406 - 00:59:14.630, Speaker B: I. It's because I already have a tensor. So I'm just like. But I would like. In that situation, like, probably. But I also have. I have a tensorian and I have a bitcoin puppet.
00:59:14.630 - 00:59:29.074, Speaker B: So, like, for me personally, I would go. I would go mad lab in that situation, but if I didn't have anything, I'd probably go to tensors in a bitcoin puppet just for the exposure. And you're probably still going to get airdropped. I probably put my two tensor ants in two different wallets because I'm like that.
00:59:32.254 - 00:59:58.754, Speaker A: So I. This is the way I kind of see it. It's like on Sol and then ETH, EVM adjacent chains. Like, that's the sandbox we have to play to build the wealth. These are all emerging ecosystems. Obviously, ETH is more established than others, but, like, soul blast base, potentially avax. I've been looking at Avax a little bit more because of the RWA stuff.
00:59:58.754 - 01:00:02.374, Speaker A: Build your wealth there, and then you retire on bitcoin.
01:00:05.094 - 01:00:16.742, Speaker B: I think you're sleeping on how many x's you could see on ordinals this year, really, because of, like, this bitcoin defi, bitcoin l two, because, like, nobody's using it.
01:00:16.838 - 01:00:36.214, Speaker A: So do you think it's, like, injecting, like, because obviously bitcoin is, you know, the longest standing crypto, the first OG crypto. Do you feel like we're going to see, like, the energy that we see around things like soul and blast come to bitcoin defi as that becomes more solidified?
01:00:36.374 - 01:01:05.066, Speaker B: I don't know if it comes to bitcoin defi, but I think the valuations of bitcoin l two s and bitcoin defi are going to be much higher than anybody thinks simply because, like, okay, if you think about it, Solana's at. I don't even want to guess right now. It's like 30 billion, something like that, maybe. Yeah. Market cap and Jupiter comes out and Jupiter sitting at 7 billion. 7 billion fully diluted. Right now.
01:01:05.066 - 01:01:28.234, Speaker B: Think about bitcoin. Bitcoins at. I don't even fucking know, like 800 billion, something like that. 800 billion. And if they get any volume from that 800 billion, what would be the justification of that? You get what I'm saying? Yeah. Those defi platforms and those l two s would be like, instead.
01:01:29.534 - 01:01:54.794, Speaker A: Yeah. Actually, now that you. When you frame it like that, that makes a lot of sense to me because it's like, most people that I know that have bitcoin just buy bitcoin and hold it but now you're. You're spot on. It's like if we add in a l two to that and we add in defi apps, what are traction? That gets traction. It's like the same reason why we would never just leave Ethan our wallet sitting idle. It's like we're gonna go put it in polls.
01:01:54.794 - 01:02:05.054, Speaker A: Okay, you're spot on. I'm sorry, I'm just thinking. I'm all like, where can I make money?
01:02:07.314 - 01:02:20.298, Speaker B: No, but dude, that's exactly why I was thinking about. I was like, okay, like, bitcoin sitting at 800 billion. Bitcoin goes to hundred thousand. Then what happens? And I'm like, there's going to be traffic, but it's also heavily under farmed because nobody understands how the fuck it works. Yeah, you get me.
01:02:20.426 - 01:02:21.330, Speaker A: I get you.
01:02:21.482 - 01:02:22.534, Speaker B: Yeah, I.
01:02:23.834 - 01:02:50.510, Speaker A: Maybe runes are another thing. Well, Dalton, way to drop the mic. I think that is a great note to end this show on. Agree, guys. Hopefully you like this. Give it a, like comment and repost. And, and of course, one, I'm just going to reiterate something Dalton said earlier, but if you are interested in playing around with blast, drop us a comment and we'll share with you all the links that we have to get on there.
01:02:50.510 - 01:03:11.838, Speaker A: And then two, if you start playing around on blast and get confused, or even if you're playing around on ETH or soul and start to get confused, shoot us a DM. We would be more than happy to, like, chat with you and walk you guys through that. Hell yeah. All right, well, until the next one. We got some exciting stuff coming up in the next week. We'll see you guys.
01:03:12.006 - 01:03:13.294, Speaker B: Ciao. Bye.
