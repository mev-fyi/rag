00:00:00.600 - 00:00:39.886, Speaker A: Did you know the first NFT ever minted was a piece called Quantum? And it was minted in 2014 by a man named Kevin McCoy? That's where this all started. And over the last decade or so, the digital landscape has become forever changed. Nfts are no longer just a proof of concept for revolutionizing art and ownership on the Internet, but rather they've evolved into financial assets that are reshaping how we interact with the digital economy today. Seeing how far nfts have come in just the last few years has to make you wonder, how will nfts continue to shape both the financial and digital landscape for years to come?
00:00:39.990 - 00:00:42.142, Speaker B: Now to the latest trend that's sweeping the Internet.
00:00:42.238 - 00:00:50.594, Speaker C: Nfts are not a scam. Nfts are not a fad. In fact, nfts are the building blocks of the future.
00:00:51.654 - 00:00:54.474, Speaker D: That's why I'm here. I'm here for a rebellion.
00:00:56.374 - 00:01:01.194, Speaker B: The consumer blockchain is going to be a profound change for everybody watching.
00:01:03.774 - 00:01:16.234, Speaker D: Isn't it interesting? Being permissionless has been so novel and so difficult to achieve. Isn't it interesting that in the realm of money, before crypto, all movement of funds required someone's permission?
00:01:19.934 - 00:01:56.374, Speaker A: You may know NFTs as the five to six figure monkey JPegs that your friend's friend bought, or that it's an acronym for something called a non fungible token, which technically is what NFT stands for. But ultimately, the important thing to know is that nfts are a way to undisputably own items on the Internet. And that's all thanks to blockchain technology. This is important because while anyone can right click save an NFT, only the NFT holder can tap into its utility and value. This distinction is critical in understanding the financial value of nfts.
00:01:56.494 - 00:01:57.486, Speaker E: I jumped in.
00:01:57.590 - 00:01:57.974, Speaker B: I know.
00:01:58.014 - 00:01:58.438, Speaker A: I heard.
00:01:58.486 - 00:02:00.022, Speaker B: I'm so happy I taught you what they were.
00:02:00.078 - 00:02:02.750, Speaker E: You did. You taught me what's up? And then I bought an ape.
00:02:02.862 - 00:02:56.022, Speaker A: Now let's jump in with the big question. What is NFT finance at the highest level? Think of NFT finance as a way to financialize nfts. All financialization really means is the process of turning an asset type, in our case nfts, into dynamic tools for transacting and other financial activity. Basically, NFT finance is an additional utility layer for the nfts we know and love today. From speculative PFP projects to on chain generative art, all the way to nfts backed by real world assets, NFT finance is a broad category and a growing one with different sectors that make up its whole. The first that most are familiar with are marketplaces, exchanges like Opensea and Blur, where you can buy and sell nfts. Then you have lending and borrowing, which facilitates getting loan against nfts.
00:02:56.022 - 00:03:50.774, Speaker A: There are also derivatives, that is synthetic financial assets that use nfts as the underlying value to enable perps and options. And the last core sector is fractionalization, which basically enables shared ownership over nfts. There are also several emerging sectors in the broader NFT finance category, which includes things like liquidity, scaling, NFT rentals and others. If the hope for web three and decentralized finance is to replace the financial system as we know it today, it's clear that NFT finance is going to play a key role in building new rails for how we transact. In the next episode, we will start getting into NFT lending by breaking down the concept of nfts as collapse.
