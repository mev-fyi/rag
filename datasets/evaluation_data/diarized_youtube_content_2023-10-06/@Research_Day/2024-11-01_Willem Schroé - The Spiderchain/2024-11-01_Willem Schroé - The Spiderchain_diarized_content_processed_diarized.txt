00:00:00.840 - 00:00:19.725, Speaker A: Everyone, great to be here. First of all, before I begin, it's a very technical audience. The more questions you have, the better. It's quite a novel concept. There's a lot of different, yeah. Things that people think about spider chains. I'm gonna present spider chains, by the way.
00:00:19.725 - 00:00:54.779, Speaker A: And so if you have any questions, just throw it out there. Very happy to answer them. And yeah, welcome to Talk about spider Chains. So I work at Botanics Labs. We're building an EVM sidechain that has a different set of trade offs. Actually at the end we'll compare the different set of trade offs between roll ups, spider chains and lightning network and why each of these will play a massive role in the future. So first of all, I think why we are all here is because we share one big mission.
00:00:54.779 - 00:01:34.849, Speaker A: And I think often there's cannibalism in the world of crypto and bitcoin, but in the end we want the whole world actually to convert to a bitcoin standard. And that is very hard. We all know that bitcoin on the base layer cannot scaling that and so I want to put that out there. That's basically actually also the mission statement of Botanics itself, but I think in broader of all of us here. So. Yeah, where do I start? Also, do I need a mic or can you guys hear me? Well, what? Can you hear me? Okay, then I'll stay here. Oh, perfect.
00:01:34.849 - 00:02:25.671, Speaker A: That's better. All right, so the best way to think about spider chains, I will make a reference to the lightning network first and then we'll park that and then I'll explain what spider chains are. So when you think about the lightning network and you look at it from like a very high level, it is a network of two out of two multisigs. If you and I open a channel, that's a two out of two multisig. If you open a channel with someone else, that's a two out of two multisig, which is HTLCs, et cetera, et cetera. But from a very high level perspective, that is actually a global network consistent of 2 out of 2 multisig. Now imagine if all of those node operators come together in a proof of stake consensus and secure an evm that is from a very, very high level, plain level overview what spider chains is.
00:02:25.671 - 00:02:58.455, Speaker A: So park that idea network of 2 out of 2 multi 6. So we park that and then we make it bigger. So what you will do with spider chains is you can basically have 10,000 or 100,000 full nodes and you all come together in a proof of stake consensus. And you create this decentralized network of multisigs. And so for example, if we start with multisig one, you will randomly choose 100 participants out of all the nodes, out of 10,000 nodes, and they will secure multisig one. So that is here on the presentation. That's MS.1,
00:02:58.455 - 00:03:24.233, Speaker A: right? And then you do that again again you randomly choose 100 participants out of 10,000 different nodes and they will secure multisig two. And then you do that again, you create a third multisig, again you randomly choose 100 participants out of all different node operators and they will secure ms.3. And then you create ms.4, ms.5, ms.6, ms.7, and you keep creating new multisigs.
00:03:24.233 - 00:04:01.879, Speaker A: And so after a while you have this overall decentralized network where anyone can participate in of like these bigger multisig sizes. And there's a lot of very interesting benefits you can get from that. But that's the basis where the actual bitcoin resides in. That's where the bitcoin sits on the base layer in this network of multisigs. Then everyone, in order to participate in the network you will have to stake Bitcoin. So you stake Bitcoin, then you can participate, you can participate in the next multisigs that are being created. You can also exit and you all secure an EVM with that.
00:04:01.879 - 00:04:44.693, Speaker A: And so when a user sends bitcoin to then multisig, then basically it gets Bitcoin on the evm, that's a native currency on the evm and then it's a full EVM equivalent execution environment. So basically exactly like Ethereum, but the whole thing runs with bitcoin as a gas fees. That's a little bit how despite the chain looks like from a very high level perspective. Any basic questions on that? Okay, let me continue. So before we continue, a few aspects that immediately jump out when you hear this. We run a proof of stake consensus. Consensus comes with a lot of drawbacks.
00:04:44.693 - 00:05:25.795, Speaker A: Consensus means you need all these nodes across the world to gossip to each other, to talk to each other. And basically you end up with a blockchain trilemma. So that means slow consensus means slower block times. Unfortunately. Second is of course the bitcoin being staked. But that's the basic design of the spider chain by the way. If people wonder why it's called spider chains, it's basically because I was drawing this on a whiteboard and someone walked past and saw that multi signal is like why are you drawing a chain of spiders? That person had nothing to do with bitcoin or crypto, but that's how it ended up being called spider chains.
00:05:25.795 - 00:06:03.765, Speaker A: So yeah, very quick overview. Decentralized multisticks, that's how we call it. Basically capable to have 10,000 different operators, 100,000 different operators. You will stake bitcoin on bitcoin, come together in a proof of stake consensus, anyone can join and then you will basically generate a multitude of different multisigs. One different one big reason why we create a series of multisigs. You can of course consider the alternative. And we've seen a lot of different L2s basically having one big honeypot.
00:06:03.765 - 00:06:46.747, Speaker A: And you could ask yourself why would you create all these series of multisigs? Why don't you just create one big one? Right? It's actually because it gives you a lot of different security benefits. One of them is forward security. One often mentioned misconception is that an honest majority would be able to steal all the bitcoin in spider chains. That's not true because it's forward secure. So forward security is a concept that comes from cryptography, forward secrecy, typically from encryption. And so forward secrecy basically means if you would steal someone's key, they wouldn't be able to decrypt older messages. And so the same concept applies here.
00:06:46.747 - 00:07:32.719, Speaker A: And let me explain what it actually means. So while you are creating this series of multisigs, so multisig 1, 2, 3, 4, you have basically this series in time. And so at some point in time, let's say after MS.3 here, what if someone suddenly gains majority control over the whole staker set? So we run on a 2/3 multisig majority. So what if someone gains 2/3 majority of the whole staker set, let's say in North Korea or something, comes in with 2 to 200,000 bitcoin, slowly accumulates over time, hides it so that nobody knows it. It's unclear. Oh, it's all open, it's all open code, anyone can see what's happening.
00:07:32.719 - 00:07:59.707, Speaker A: But. But they have this weird sybil way that they can hide that they actually have 2/3 majority of the network. They can steal exactly zero Bitcoin. And the reason is when you think about MS.1, the security of MS.1 depends on at that point in time what the 2/3 majority is. Since the attacker only has 2/3 majority after this point in time, they won't be able to steal anything from MS.1,
00:07:59.707 - 00:08:21.784, Speaker A: they won't be able to steal anything from MS.2 and they won't be able to steal ANYTHING from MS.3. So at that point in time a 2/3 majority attacker cannot steal anything of the bitcoin only in the future. So basically from MS.4 they'll be able to steal the bitcoin. Yeah, usually that would rely on the people in MS.1 deleting the key.
00:08:21.784 - 00:08:59.345, Speaker A: No, no. So people in MS.1 are still there. But that 2/3 majority that has at this point at MS.4 in time, that has too much 2/3 majority control over MS.4 does not have 2/3 majority control over MS.1. Like if you would sell old keys then yeah, you would have to buy.
00:08:59.345 - 00:09:23.693, Speaker A: Yeah, now you're confusing two different attacks. So let's say indeed in MS.1 you would want to do an attack on purely MS.1, not the whole network, but MS.1 on its own. MS.1 has 100 signers.
00:09:23.693 - 00:09:49.895, Speaker A: You want 2/3 majority there. So 67, you basically make a deal to those 67, you send out a transaction, we will steal all the Bitcoin in MS.1. You will get a share, everyone gets their own 100 of the share. And that's basically where the stake comes in. So the total collateral for Ms. One is 100 times the stake. And so if there's not that much Bitcoin in MS.1,
00:09:49.895 - 00:10:24.483, Speaker A: you will never steal that. No, it never ends. So you basically get slashed. So the cool thing about the spider chain is that the collateral is basically like it's not a. You cannot compare the total collateral. Like the total collateral is actually the amount of multisigs times the amount of stake that is in one single multisig. So you don't have to be over collateralized because you spread it out in a multitude of multisigs.
00:10:24.483 - 00:11:09.135, Speaker A: So for example, if there's 100 bitcoin in ms.1 and the collateral is 500 bitcoin, then basically you slash all 100 signers and you can cover that hundred bitcoin with the 500 bitcoin that's in stake. Yes, that's a good point. I don't know how I am on time. Yes, that's a good point. Let me actually go to this slide which is this last line. So we talked a little bit about the design of the spider chain.
00:11:09.135 - 00:11:54.303, Speaker A: What does that mean for roll ups? What does that mean for the Lightning network? There is a whole set of tech trade offs basically roll ups. And I think personally they should double down on being more centralized and extremely high throughput. If you're centralized but trustless and you create proofs, then you can go massive high throughput because you don't need to gossip around different nodes. You don't need to come to consensus for spider chains. You do have a consensus, but you are more decentralized, which gives you a lot of different benefits like censorship resistance, like liveness, like upgradability. But it comes at the cost of being more slow. Lightning network, we know it's fast, free payments and trustless, doesn't have execution environments.
00:11:54.303 - 00:12:25.355, Speaker A: And so those are different tech trade offs between the different technologies. What does that mean in terms of the market, in terms of applications and this is my guess, but I think that will play out. Lightning network will be the last mile payments. So basically for merchants, peer to peer roll ups will have high throughput applications. Basically once you're very centralized, you can go extremely high throughput which is like yeah, 0.1 second block times. And there's a huge amount for demand for that.
00:12:25.355 - 00:13:12.051, Speaker A: What I think is applications for spider chains is a decentralized financial system. And the reason why is I think a financial system has to be decentralized. If you run centralized nodes, you don't want any country in the world to basically control the financial system, Even though it would be trustless. It basically gives a lot of power to a certain amount of countries. Basically ties into the censorship resistance of spider chains versus roll ups. And so each set of trade offs is a trade off between throughput, decentralization and cost. And that's a little bit how I see the world of yeah, different designs for L2s play out and that's we need all of them basically.
00:13:12.051 - 00:13:20.515, Speaker A: Like if you want to run the whole world on bitcoin with all different applications, you need all of them and that was it.
