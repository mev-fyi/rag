00:00:00.330 - 00:01:25.540, Speaker A: You. I think if you believe in decentralization as a security model, then transmitting large amounts of value over a single server doesn't seem very secure. So I think what we really need to think about is do we in our industry and do people outside our industry and do just people who know security believe that decentralization provides real security benefits that can secure the transmission of critical information and value both across chains and really across all systems? So does decentralization provide that security? I think it's pretty clear that it does based on the track record of blockchains that process private key signatures, token ledgers and state machines in the form of smart contracts pretty securely now for many years. And so now the real challenge is to apply decentralization to many types of computation, including crosschain. So if you believe in decentralization as a security mechanism, using a bridge that is based on a single server or on multiple servers secured by a single key is not really in line with the risk management and the security practices that people that believe in decentralization also believe in. Close.
