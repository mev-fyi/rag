00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.640, Speaker A: Live. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us here today on Chainlink's livestream with Bosagora. So I am Mike from the Chainlink community team, and I'm really excited to have with us here today Johan from Bosagora. So welcome, Johan. Nice to have you.
00:00:17.010 - 00:00:25.200, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me here. I'm very excited to show Bosagora's story.
00:00:26.570 - 00:01:03.374, Speaker A: Excellent. We're very excited as well. So I just want to give everyone a recap as to what to expect for this AmA before we begin. So the goal, really is for both the Chainlink community and the Bosco community to learn more about integration between our two projects. And we will really dive deep and explore what makes this integration unique and really beneficial for both our teams and our communities and the users of each product. So the agenda will be roughly 20 to 30 minutes or so. I will be asking questions to Johan, and he'll be sharing a little bit more about the project, about their vision and their product.
00:01:03.374 - 00:01:27.730, Speaker A: And at the end, we will share a lot of the links as well, and the information that Johan will have shared during this live stream, which you can access in the description below. So, yeah, without further ado, let's begin. And, yeah, so perhaps kind of the first question here, Johan, is perhaps you could give us an introduction, brief introduction of yourself and kind of your background and what your team is building.
00:01:27.900 - 00:01:59.620, Speaker B: All right, cool. Hi, guys. My name is Johan. I'm the director of marketing and business development at Bosagora. For the past 18 years, I've worked as a marketing specialist for advertising agencies, global gaming company, and share at Bosagora. I've always wanted to do something to help make the world a better place. And I met Bosagora in 2018, and I felt compelled to join the team.
00:01:59.620 - 00:02:32.400, Speaker B: I'm confident that I made the correct decision then, as we have already completed many important tasks over the last two years. The team's goal is to build a decentralized, censorship resistant blockchain platform that can contribute to the better world. And again, thank you for having me here today. And I'm very excited to tell you about our story.
00:02:34.370 - 00:02:45.806, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you for sharing that, Johan. And I guess the next question here is, could you tell us a little bit more about Bosagora and what is it that you are aiming to solve? What problems are you solving?
00:02:45.998 - 00:03:48.962, Speaker B: Yeah, as I have already stated, Bosagora is a public blockchain platform that aims to make better world. We are currently planning, building, and doing numerous activities to accomplish this mission. In addition we will be developing a grassroots environmental campaign to support uN sustainable development goals. I would also like to mention Bosagora's commands budget, a budget created automatically to fund meaningful activities or project well. All major decisions will be made deliberately and methodically by Congress. Bosagora will surely be a DAO decentralized, autonomous organization in which any node can participate. And what was the question? Yeah, what problem we want to solve.
00:03:48.962 - 00:04:38.710, Speaker B: Right. We wish to address several issues, including the problem of DeFi at present, the fact that it's risky, limited and challenging to comprehend. We propose a safer, broader and more convincing actual finance called DeFi, short for true finance. The DeFi is undoubtedly an innovative and thoughtful proposal. However, it is vulnerable to hacking and flesh loan attacks because it works solely on programmed algorithm. Right. Simultaneously, traditional economic sectors have totally been disabled from the application of DeFi.
00:04:38.710 - 00:05:06.720, Speaker B: Finally, the DeFi is complex and cumbersome, so these kind of issues can be solved by incorporating traditional economics into DeFi. The wide range of off chain traditional economies are more secure from trespassers and flesh ones, and the mechanism itself is easy for everyone to follow.
00:05:09.730 - 00:05:25.262, Speaker A: Great, thank you for sharing that. And it's quite interesting that you talked a little bit about TFI, and we'd like to learn a little bit more. Perhaps you can share with the audience. Can you tell us a little bit more about true finance and what does it entail? A little bit more information around that?
00:05:25.416 - 00:06:09.858, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. TFI also pursue a decentralized automated Defi protocol. However, it is totally different and new. Kind of defi merged with a traditional economy space, so it's clear, convincing and reliable. We offer a staking reward to the stakers of boa coins, the Bosagora's own currency. You can stake your boa coins and earn staking reward as other PoS blockchain platforms, but the compensation rate is quite different. You can earn about 37% for the first year, which is the minimum rate.
00:06:09.858 - 00:06:49.680, Speaker B: Not only that, TFI has a unique structure that allows users to earn additional fixed income by lending the stake bought coins as collateral. We generate additional profits from the traditional economic sectors and benefit the participant with a fixed interest. It's one source finance, but used in multiple ways. In other words, well, TFI allows cryptocurrency holders to generate revenue more freely based on cryptocurrency, staking and traditional economy at the same time.
00:06:51.730 - 00:06:57.890, Speaker A: Excellent. And when it comes to DeFi, could you also share a little bit more about your approach?
00:06:58.870 - 00:07:43.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm kind of big fan of defi and DeFi is a beautiful concept for finance history. It opened new possibility to the human life of economy. The ways we can get interest in DeFi is absolutely unprecedented. And we know that there's much more space we can discover farther from here. Right. So Posagora fully supports the DeFi concept, and we want to add better aspect on current DeFi. Basically, DeFi involves bringing cryptocurrency into the off chain traditional economy and generating revenue.
00:07:43.310 - 00:07:53.730, Speaker B: The transaction data that occurs in the off chain area will be linked with the Bosagora Trust contract through chainring's oracle solution.
00:07:55.750 - 00:08:14.730, Speaker A: That's great. Thanks for sharing that. That's certainly exciting. I think that aspect of connecting with Chainlink's decentralized oracle network is something we'll definitely get into. But before that, I'd like to learn also a little bit more, and I think the audience would love to hear a little bit more about the vision for Bosagora's approach, especially when it comes to governance.
00:08:15.150 - 00:09:12.110, Speaker B: Governance? Yes. Well, technically, we aim a full node PoS consensus protocol where all nodes can participate and benefit equally. There is no need to select nodes for speed like the other platforms. Thanks to our built in second layer solution, flash layer microtransactions can be handled in real time, and the block contains only the final result to maintain scalability without slowing down. At the same time, we also pursue deliberative democracy in the procedure. Bosagora has developed the governance tool called voltera, and it makes deliberative online democrats possible. All node operators will participate freely.
00:09:12.110 - 00:09:29.570, Speaker B: It prevents the distortion of public opinions. Free from bias. Everyone can maintain anonymity while discussing. And the vote result will be stored, of course, in the blockchain, transparently.
00:09:31.510 - 00:09:53.046, Speaker A: Excellent. So, as you alluded already earlier, Johan, you talked a little bit about how Chainlink, decentralized oracles will be playing a huge role in Bosagora's work and development. Could you perhaps share a little bit more about how you'll be integrating Chainlink and really, what are your use cases?
00:09:53.238 - 00:10:41.210, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Well, Chainlink is one of the essential factor in TFI, I guess, and I'm very happy to connect with it. TFI makes a profit by investing cash that was loaned from the cryptocurrency collateral. And with this profit, we purchase cryptocurrencies back and distribute them to the participants. The TFI model embraces on chain and off chain. So to maintain the process transparent and automated by the contract, we must gather the information of transactions occurring in the off chain area and embed them on the blockchain. Reliably.
00:10:41.210 - 00:11:18.630, Speaker B: Chainlink will provide all data from the off chain area in TFI structure. Those data include, well, how much fiat currency was laund and invested in the traditional economy area, what was the final interest rate of the investment, and at what price the interest was exchanged into cryptocurrency and so on. So Chainlink Oracle solution will help the entire process of TFI to be transparent, objective and automated.
00:11:20.410 - 00:11:45.134, Speaker A: The great overview, and we're very glad to be working alongside you and helping power this solution. Excellent. So I just want to change gears here and talk a little bit also about the community that supports and is truly behind the growth of Bosagora. So could you share your thoughts on how you view the role of the community and how it has been helping you grow?
00:11:45.332 - 00:12:21.580, Speaker B: Yeah, they're just amazing. And our community is wonderful. They are strongly support and trust us, and thanks to their passion and belief, Bosagora has generated meaningful achievements during the hard times. Currently there are korean, english, chinese, russian, spanish and turkish communities with about 20,000 members. I'm very proud of these people.
00:12:22.990 - 00:12:34.190, Speaker A: That's excellent. So you did talk about those countries. And in terms of growth, we're very curious to learn a little bit more. So where do you see the most growth for Bosagora?
00:12:34.530 - 00:13:06.070, Speaker B: Well, it's hard to select, but because Bosagora is totally a global project, we had participants from 95 countries at the time of the ICO. All countries are still important to Bosagora ecosystem, but when it comes to growth rate, the community is growing steeply in countries such as China, Russia, Spain, Indonesia and Turkey.
00:13:08.330 - 00:13:28.638, Speaker A: Excellent. And I think the question that perhaps many in the community would love to know and especially how the year has been very exciting in 2021. Could you tell us a little bit more perhaps about what could we expect or what can the community expect in terms of the product roadmap and what are you currently focusing on?
00:13:28.804 - 00:14:57.850, Speaker B: Yeah, currently we are focusing on the areas like developing coin net and trust contract and enhancing interoperability, and upgrading TFI structure and listing global top exchanges as well. We aim to launch the Coinet in third quarter this year and the main net in the first quarter next year. In March, we newly minted BP 20 based borcoins to build a linkage to the binance smart chain ecosystem. By this, the area of BoA will be expanded. We also have plans to continuously establish bridges with the other platforms so that BoA can increase its value. Tfi, our unique ecosystem model, especially in economic aspect, has already proved its huge possibility. The revenue is already exceeded three times more than we promised to the participant and TFI structure is now being elaborated so that more people can conveniently enjoy the benefits from the next participant period.
00:14:57.850 - 00:15:16.980, Speaker B: Currently, boy is listed in Bithum, Bitrex and Kucoin, Bithum Global and Coinbenne. We are also discussing new listing in the global topic exchanges to meet more traders right now.
00:15:18.950 - 00:15:34.120, Speaker A: Great. That's exciting to hear. And if the community would like to learn more, and then the audience that are tuned in today, if they would like to follow your progress and learn a little bit more about the project, where would be the best places for them to follow?
00:15:34.730 - 00:15:54.350, Speaker B: Yeah, we have very various channels to meet you guys and you can get the right answer there it is. So many. So I guess it is better we'll share the information right after this ama session.
00:15:55.090 - 00:16:22.680, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So we'll make sure. No worries. For those of you tuned in, we will make sure to drop the links to the Bosagora Twitter website and telegrams, of course, for you guys to join. So it'll be updated on the that, you know, really wraps up our video Q A for today. I want to thank you again, Johan, for joining us and spending time with us today with the Chainlink community and then also with the Mosakur community.
00:16:23.850 - 00:16:29.640, Speaker B: Thank you for having me here again. It was very nice chance to share our story.
