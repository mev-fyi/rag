00:00:00.890 - 00:00:08.362, Speaker A: YouTube real quick. And then we can let some people join. Yeah, if you want to also just stop presenting.
00:00:08.506 - 00:00:25.880, Speaker B: Oh, sure, yeah, definitely. I'm just testing the presenting. How do I stop, though? Sorry, can you stop me? Hold on. Stop video. Okay, you stop. Break. Great.
00:00:25.880 - 00:00:27.640, Speaker B: See, you have the power.
00:00:29.050 - 00:00:42.134, Speaker A: I got the power. Yeah. No, really excited for this. Thanks a lot, everyone who's joining in, we'll give it just a few minutes. Let some more people. Robert. Robert.
00:00:42.134 - 00:00:43.302, Speaker A: Robbie. What do you prefer?
00:00:43.366 - 00:00:45.402, Speaker C: Yeah, it's always really been Robbie. Really?
00:00:45.456 - 00:00:50.070, Speaker A: Yeah, Robbie. Cool. You should show the people. Join right now the back of your shirt.
00:00:50.150 - 00:00:51.482, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Okay. Of course.
00:00:51.616 - 00:00:59.280, Speaker A: Begging for these. Got the top notch swag going on.
00:01:00.530 - 00:01:19.860, Speaker C: Yeah, obviously. So if you can kind of see, I know my chair is sort of zooming in and out there. That's like our poster girl in many ways. Bitsy knacker, aptly named, obviously, as a kind of nod towards bitcoin as the daddy of the cryptocurrency world, if you like.
00:01:22.390 - 00:01:22.898, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:22.984 - 00:01:53.230, Speaker A: Yeah. So then, sweet. And, yeah, thanks a lot. Everyone who's joining us in from YouTube got a really exciting meetup that we'll be doing right now with Robbie, Idon and Emma from chain Guardian. So they got some exciting updates to their characters coming up for their new blockchain game and are looking for the chainlink community to help push the designs forward. So this should be really cool. We'll get started here in a few seconds.
00:01:53.230 - 00:01:59.090, Speaker A: Where's everyone? Robbie, you're in? Are you in Toronto?
00:01:59.670 - 00:02:01.794, Speaker B: Just north of Toronto, slightly, yeah.
00:02:01.832 - 00:02:05.590, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, cool. And then, Edon, where are you calling from?
00:02:05.740 - 00:02:08.150, Speaker D: I'm from currently in Edmonton.
00:02:08.650 - 00:02:11.410, Speaker B: Edmonton, Canada.
00:02:11.570 - 00:02:15.080, Speaker A: Nice. Is it snow in there yet?
00:02:17.210 - 00:02:30.362, Speaker D: A feet and a half. I can't even get out because I have like a 400 meters driveway. Well, I have an acreage, so it's like 400 meters of driveway, so it takes a while to get it cleaned up.
00:02:30.496 - 00:02:35.470, Speaker C: Idon's Internet still runs on dial up, so just in case he drops off, you're all aware.
00:02:38.530 - 00:02:43.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a little worried, especially with the snow. Right. It's like, oh, is his Internet going to be okay?
00:02:44.004 - 00:02:48.000, Speaker C: Yeah, if anybody hears that, might be.
00:02:48.370 - 00:02:57.122, Speaker B: Know, I really want Aidan to move maybe a little bit to the side so we can see Bipsie's face. She's blocked. He's like, no, she's much more prettier.
00:02:57.186 - 00:02:58.294, Speaker C: Perfect. Yeah.
00:02:58.412 - 00:03:00.600, Speaker B: Without him blocking, like, half of the face.
00:03:01.130 - 00:03:03.078, Speaker C: You make a good couple. I don.
00:03:03.244 - 00:03:05.350, Speaker B: Oh, with ipsy? I'm jealous.
00:03:06.730 - 00:03:07.142, Speaker C: Cool.
00:03:07.196 - 00:03:33.466, Speaker A: Well, yeah, we'll go ahead and get started here. Thanks a lot, everyone who's joining us in from YouTube. Really excited for this meetup with Chain Guardians. We got the co founders joining us today. They got some really exciting new character releases coming up and are really asking for the Chainlink community's help in pushing this forward. So definitely interact with the chat. Really want to make this interactive, even though it's on YouTube, so feel free to comment chat.
00:03:33.466 - 00:04:08.650, Speaker A: We also recently put a tweet out that you'll see on the smart contract Twitter as well as Chain Guardians Twitter. We can drop those links in down there in a moment, but to vote on these characters that we'll be kind of talking about. So a little bit about the agenda today. Robbie, Edon and Emma will be doing a quick presentation about kind of everything that's chain Guardians doing a little demo, and then we'll get into this design challenge that's going to be coming forward for their upcoming launch. And so, yeah, with that, maybe we can just go around and Emma, do you want to just maybe introduce yourself real quick?
00:04:08.800 - 00:04:23.610, Speaker B: Sure. I'm Emma. I'm actually based in Canada. I'm one of the co founder of Chain Guardians. Very excited to be here today, and thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to meet with the Chainlink community. So we're very excited.
00:04:23.770 - 00:04:32.766, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. And we're really excited to be working with you as well. And thank you for joining. Edon, you want to introduce and maybe your role, Guardian?
00:04:32.878 - 00:04:51.450, Speaker D: Certainly. So this is Aiden. So I'm based in Edmonton currently, but I travel quite a bit globally now. So I guess my role is mainly around the technical blockchain development portion of the project, but I also do part of the business development.
00:04:52.110 - 00:04:54.570, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks, Bob, for sharing. Yeah, Robbie.
00:04:55.390 - 00:05:24.030, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, just to reiterate what Emma said, thank you so much for having us on. All of our experience with yourself, Keenan, and Rory, so far, as well as the tech team with Chainlink, has been amazing. We're really excited for the different capabilities that the verifiable randomness functionality is going to bring to blockchain gaming as a whole, we feel, but obviously specifically to us at this moment in time. So just thank you very much for that. In terms of myself. Yeah, my name's Robbie.
00:05:24.030 - 00:05:42.380, Speaker C: I am one of the co founders alongside Idon and Emma. Mainly my role is centered upon community as well as partnerships. And also as a creative writer, I do a lot of the story law aspect of the design element of the game and such.
00:05:42.830 - 00:05:57.614, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. Thanks a lot, everyone, for sharing. Yeah. So really excited about blockchain gaming. Everyone's looking at like, okay, Defi is really cool. How do we combine these as well as what's the next thing? And Chainlink vrf being able to help this.
00:05:57.614 - 00:06:10.210, Speaker A: So it's really exciting working with you guys and really excited to hear your story right now. Yeah. So without further ado, Emma, I think you had a presentation that you wanted to get to, right?
00:06:10.280 - 00:06:36.780, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah, let me do it. So I'm going to share my screen so hopefully everybody can see it. Give me 1 second. I'm having some technical challenge earlier, so just see how this goes. Okay? Give me 1 second. Sorry, I'm the least tech person on the team so just bear with me and then I have to do the screen share.
00:06:36.780 - 00:06:39.082, Speaker B: Okay. Can you guys see my screen?
00:06:39.216 - 00:06:40.502, Speaker C: Yep, looks good, Emma.
00:06:40.566 - 00:07:07.650, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Great. Okay, so actually, I know I'm going to get started. Okay. So in front of you, it's our bitsy Kyoto. And then this one is actually a curator that we designed for our video, which some of us, if you're interested, can check it out on YouTube. So what's Chain guardian? Chain Guardian is the first blockchain superhero ecosystem that we build for players and also collector.
00:07:07.650 - 00:07:38.782, Speaker B: So we basically combine the traditional gaming concept with the latest blockchain technology. So we wanted to bring value to our end users. So in chain guardians we focused on. Let me go to the first slide maybe. And then in one of our slogans that we believe every chain needs a guardian. And so that's the idea that right now we're working with chain link to actually design a chain link guardian for the chainlink. And in here we kind of just wanted to.
00:07:38.782 - 00:07:42.874, Speaker B: Can everybody see the slide? I just don't know if there's a lag in loading.
00:07:43.002 - 00:07:43.854, Speaker C: No, we're good.
00:07:43.972 - 00:08:25.706, Speaker B: Okay, cool, great. So in here we just want to give a quick overview of what are some of our advantage and some of the things that we wanted to focus on. So basically, besides creating NFT, we see there are a lot of NFTs that's out on the market. But then what we wanted to focus is actually creating exceptional quality collectible NFT for our users. So I think that most of you probably know NFT stands for non fungible token. And then our goal is to create a unique collection of a superhero for the blockchain space. For example, on the screen right now with you, it's Bipsie.
00:08:25.706 - 00:09:06.570, Speaker B: So she is our poster girl and she is also our strongest guardian within the chain. Guardian crypto verse. And of course because bitcoin is the most real. So that's why we have to make the strongest character in our crypto world. And we're here today, of course we talked about earlier is that we wanted to invite a Chainlink community member to help us to design a superhero guardian to represent chainlink and which will go a little bit more details as we go along the slide deck. So why superhero? So because we want to create an NFT, not just NFT for no reason. We want an NFT that's actually connected to the blockchain space.
00:09:06.570 - 00:10:27.460, Speaker B: And the idea is that collecting a chain Guardian NFT is almost like you're collecting a piece of art that's representing part of the blockchain world. So that's why we have the whole idea of creating a chain for Guardian for different. Like owning our NFT is almost like you're owning a part of the blockchain history. Of course besides creating exceptional good quality value NFT, we also understand that nowadays people, users or we call them the collectors or player they wanted to have NFT of course to retain value and then also have different main use cases. That's another thing that we focus on is that we design an entire ecosystem not just with a good quality design nfts and then which will go a little bit more details on how we design those characters and then also that we create a whole ecosystem that our NFT players and collectors can have ways to use our NFT by participating in the game that we created. We have two type of game which Robbie will demo soon. One of them is mining game where our players can earn passive income and then another one is just like a role playing game where a player can just play and use the guardian theater to fight in game.
00:10:27.460 - 00:11:33.638, Speaker B: Lastly, one of the key things that we focus on is we wanted to build strong partnership with other blockchain projects within the space. So such as today that we're here with the chainlink because besides designing the Chainlink Guardian and then also is that we also integrating with Chainlink's verifiable renderance function with our smart contract. So the chainlink Guardian NFT will be the first NFT that we have where the collector can individualize the color based on the color that they like and then you will definitely add more realty to the chain link guardian that they own. Okay, and next one, just about the two games that we have. So one of them is that I talk about is the proof of stake mining game. So what this game is that the first project I have, this mining game basically is almost like a passive computer simulated mining game where players can actually earn passive income. So basically Robbie will show you the interface later by only the NFT.
00:11:33.638 - 00:12:10.742, Speaker B: You can participate in our NFT mining game and then earn passive income on the right hand side. And we actually partnered with a lot of a few major blockchain gaming projects as well, such as my crypto hero. They're the biggest japanese game, blockchain game and Eastamong is another. It's almost like a Pokemon Eastermong game. And then Cryptoskull, crypto, Murph and few other ones. So any of our users or any of other people that owns those NFT can come and participate in this NFT mining game. And on the right hand side we have this cross chain role playing game.
00:12:10.742 - 00:12:36.800, Speaker B: Basically it's a free to play where it's a term based role playing game where we partnered with other blockchain projects for the in game world. And of course the players can come and check out the storyline of the Guardians by participating the game. Ok, so now I'm going to actually pass along to Robbie and he will demo you both games just to show you quickly how they look like.
00:12:37.330 - 00:13:00.722, Speaker C: Yeah, perfect. Thanks, Emma. So I'm going to first of all make sure that I can share my screen for obvious reasons. Yeah, let me just see if I can share screen. It should be screen one. There we go. Can you see?
00:13:00.856 - 00:13:01.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:02.410 - 00:13:39.554, Speaker C: Okay, that's good. Looks good to me. Right. Okay, so first of all, this is our free to play roleplay game. Now one thing that Emma may not have touched upon in great detail is essentially the two different ways to play that we have right now are the free to play mining game and the free to play role playing game. And both are linked through our backend APIs. And we're in the process of, we do have a marketplace, but very shortly going in through the process of revamping that entire user interface so that it's more friendly and usable, so that the two are more seamless and interacting with one another.
00:13:39.554 - 00:14:34.482, Speaker C: But the free to play mining game that I will show you in the first instance is a really good. Well, essentially anybody can play as long as you own any of the NFTs that we're partnered with and the tokens that you can possibly kind of win. It's like a mining simulated game will also show up in the role playing game and you can then use those tokens. They've got multiple use cases such as upgrading your character, purchasing, let's say consumables, armor and all these different types of thing to assist you in the RPG. So the mining game, once you've logged in, will look something like this. And I own NFTs in one of my wallets from these different projects that we're partnered with. So when I click, so I've clicked obviously chain Guardians there you can see what's in my wallet for chain Guardians, which is obviously our project.
00:14:34.482 - 00:15:41.050, Speaker C: And then I can select those assets and it will tell me what hash rate they have and will populate on the right hand side here. We also added a sync assets buttons for if you get any new NFTs and you want them to show up quickly, you can click the sync assets button. We have a block history here which shows previously mined blocks as well as who won those particular blocks. So you can see there's quite a few participants here and the amount of CGC chain Guardians coins, which is a fungible like it is not an ERC 20. However, we do have some exciting revelations to share about that in the future to show the play, to earn mechanics, which will be at play and the ecosystem that we are building. If we click down here, we can see all of the different projects that we are potentially partnered with and also nice quick link to Opensea as a secondary marketplace here to buy those assets should you want to. So you can see the different projects that we're partnered with here at the moment in time.
00:15:41.050 - 00:16:17.734, Speaker C: And we're always looking to reach out to new partners and add more into our crypto verse alliance, as we call them, so that more users nfts will be usable in this way as like essentially NFT proof of stake. You have the NFT, you stake it to the mining game and as such you can earn the CGC. So I can go to participation here. It's just another little neat interface here which will show where I have participated. It's much similar to the block history, I have to be honest. Usually it loads up much quicker than this. But I think it's because I'm sort of streaming that it's not loading as quickly as I'd like.
00:16:17.734 - 00:16:49.530, Speaker C: So you can see who won out of the previous blocks I have participated in. And then we've got the balance here. It'll load up my balance here again, just taking a few more seconds than usual. Believe me, it's usually much more quick and slick than this. It is just because I am streaming and you can see here it's loaded up my balance and when I won those particular blocks. So just in terms of participating, it's very simple. You go to our website, which is chainguardians IO.
00:16:49.530 - 00:17:30.458, Speaker C: And along the top you will see a mining button. You click there and log in. If you haven't got a user to essentially log in, that's really simple too. When you log out, I will show you what screen you would see and you can sign up super quick and easy and start mining straight away if you want any of these NFTs. So I'm just going to show all with this filter here. Of all the different NFTs I've got in this wallet from my partners, I'm going to select just a bunch of them here. Usually go for the ish rate and I've got here nine out of nine, which is our current top amount.
00:17:30.458 - 00:17:55.350, Speaker C: Start mining, give it a second or two. And there we go. Currently mining and it will tell us when the next window opens to reparticipate. And it's a 24 hours thing. So daily you can log in and it's just an idle mining game and you slowly accrue CGC. So if I just log out of here very quickly, this is the screen that you'd see. If you've got no account, you've got a little sign up button there.
00:17:55.350 - 00:18:35.010, Speaker C: Nice and easy, simple as you like. Click that and follow the steps to sign up. You can link your wallet if you like, to our back end login stack. And we're also looking at adding more user friendly ways for logging in. Essentially like we're currently in talks with the likes of Arcane for their wallet stack and so on and so forth. Also on our website you can log into our RPG. Now our RPG does have some is obviously continuously being developed, so we have obviously released it, but we're consistently updating it.
00:18:35.010 - 00:18:58.070, Speaker C: Now I have turned down the volume, so hopefully that's not too overpowering. The music is something we want to also adapt. What I didn't show you there is. There is an option to change language here. We do currently support japanese and vietnamese. Obviously as part of our partnership with my crypto heroes, a lot of their users are japanese. So we're trying to be as language friendly as possible.
00:18:58.070 - 00:19:37.782, Speaker C: You can also see here that my CGC, my chain guardians coins have synced from the mining. The number might slightly be off because it obviously updates every so often. You can see here my team, so my NFTs I own, so the Mudra I have a clone and a few Celia in this particular wallet, which are all NFTs and I can drag and simply drop if I want to change these over. You can see the levels here as well, and also their skills level up and you've got a bunch of different stats there to get grips with. In terms of my inventory, all of these are currently not on chain. Some of them are, but not all of them. So they're not all nfts, but some are.
00:19:37.782 - 00:20:20.334, Speaker C: And again, obviously this is all part of the ecosystem that we're currently building. So these are nfts or can be minted as NFTs. And here are things that I can buy if I want using my CGC at the moment in time. In terms of right now, the Coliseum is where we're looking on our roadmap to implement PvP. So where you will battle other chain guardian teams and we can have tournaments. And obviously players will have opportunity to stake CGC as part of battle as another functionality for player to earn. We do believe that at this point, this is when the ecosystem will really start coming into place and there'll be more engagement with the RPG.
00:20:20.334 - 00:21:04.430, Speaker C: Because at this stage then players can battle one another as opposed to just playing through the play versus the environment section, which is the role playing game section. Users can also have a free daily summon or they can use CGC to get a different character depending on how much they want to spend. So there's my free daily. So I'm just going to take him and he will go into my inventory. Sorry. My team over here, as you can see, I've already minted a fair few of them. And also if I just go back to the summon, if you want a rare character, you can buy with more CGC.
00:21:04.430 - 00:21:40.798, Speaker C: These are all mintable to NFTs. They are not NFTs immediately, because once it becomes an NFT, we don't support the buying and selling of that NFT at the moment on our marketplace. You'd have to go through Opensea, but they are mintable as nfts. So essentially you've got that kind of play to earn dynamic there. The actual playvers and environment section here. Again, we're still in the process of adding all the worlds, but these are the worlds I've currently played through. And as you can see, this is my progress here.
00:21:40.798 - 00:22:31.514, Speaker C: And if I just click here, loot is yet to be added, so there will be drops. And obviously CGC and I can click begin here. And as you can see, we've got the RPG. There's quite a lot of intricacy that you won't even notice to this in the sense that depending on their stance, a different attack would be more efficient out of these different attacks below and also there's an internal timer which you don't see depending on the speed that you press. It will also determine how much damage you do as well. These combined make for a skill element as well as a strategic element, which we believe will come into play quite significantly when PvP is taking place. So just as a quick demo you can see here.
00:22:31.514 - 00:23:10.218, Speaker C: So my thrust didn't do loads of damage to this guy. Try my ranged and I get some more damage. Just to give you an indication, we've also can use some of our NFTs or some of our fungibles that are in game fungibles to have different effects. Depending on what I want to occur, special moves also take place. He has a special move because he's one of our guardians. As Chainlink would also have their own special move which also improves over time with that. That's more or less at this time, the shortest, most succinct demo I can give you.
00:23:10.218 - 00:23:39.970, Speaker C: There is a story element to the game as well, which hopefully you'll become immersed in. And this supplementary law which has also been added to our website, which you can read through, and comics in line with the kind of anime theme style that we are shooting for, which is also there for people to get immersed with, really. And with that, I will end my demonstration and I will pass back to you, Emma.
00:23:42.310 - 00:23:56.966, Speaker B: Ok, thank you, Robbie. Ok, can everybody see my screen? It's good.
00:23:57.068 - 00:24:12.750, Speaker C: Yeah. So good. One thing I would ask as well is if there is any questions, Keenan, that come through about any of this, because it's a lot to take on board. Please feel free to jump in and ask us any questions that you think that might be pressing from your community. Like you say, we want this to be kind of as interactive as possible for them.
00:24:12.900 - 00:24:31.282, Speaker A: Well, yeah, everyone that's in the chat, definitely drop any questions, just go through the demo. You guys'design is sleek. It's amazing how far blockchain gaming and just gaming in general has come over the years. And yeah, congratulations for this and excited to see it come more.
00:24:31.336 - 00:24:59.420, Speaker C: Thank you. Yeah, I was going to say, the other thing is, obviously we're looking to bring new ways to play all the time. We have got long term aims to turn our game into 3D, especially some 3D pvp scenarios. We're heavily involved and have great relationships with different metaverse projects and that is also definitely something that we're looking to do down the line.
00:24:59.870 - 00:25:16.366, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. And I was going to say we're excited to see the chain link Guardian going to be designed so people can start using the game. That will be exciting too. For us as well. Hopefully for your community member as well. Okay, so thank you, Robbie, can I.
00:25:16.388 - 00:25:53.338, Speaker D: Just add one thing? So I just want to bring up one of our very early merchandise because I happen to have it. It's a watch. It's a collector's edition made by a company called Undone, which some of you may be familiar with. The original company has a history of building watches or bracelets for Rolex. Not only are this the collector's edition, but you actually have a function with a near field communication chip, which you can actually, I guess, use it to launch a game. Recognize the wallet that's tied to your wallet so you can actually use it to activate features. So we do also want to making physical collectible merchandise as well.
00:25:53.338 - 00:26:01.120, Speaker D: It's just something to keep in mind that we're trying to cover the whole spectrum of not just blockchain digital, but kind of traditional marketplace as well.
00:26:01.490 - 00:26:20.414, Speaker B: Integrated additional physical collectible item basically. Right? Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Aiden and Robbie. Okay, so I'll just continue on with. So earlier Robbie showed you the demo of the two game that we currently build. So the mining game is more or less what we completed.
00:26:20.414 - 00:26:44.814, Speaker B: The RPG gain is still kind of in the beta stage. So we continue build on it. But right now with Bose game, as Robbie showed you, that you can earn something called CGC. So you can stake in the mining game for more. Like the passive player, let's say if you just want to go in once a day, kind of just select the NFT that you have and you can start earning CGC. And then of course for the role playing game, you just have to actively kind of fight and know relax. When you're trying to play a game for fun.
00:26:44.814 - 00:27:39.690, Speaker B: You can also a way to earn rewards. So what our community member has been doing with the CGC is that right now you can actually redeem for in game Kyotas. And then those Kyotas can actually mint it as NFT if they are a guardian or something that's eligible. So basically we do have a marketplace also, once you earn enough CGC, you have the choice to actually upgrade assets for Ingen for the role playing game, or actually mint those characters as NFT. And also we have community member has been actually minting them and trading on a secondary market such as Opensea. So I just wanted to share with that. And then of course on our future roadmap that we also going to release ERC 20 governance token, which will give more option for our end user to able to convert the CGC to our ERC 20 token.
00:27:39.690 - 00:27:44.340, Speaker B: So we're actually very excited about that. So this is like the first time we're sharing it with our community.
00:27:44.710 - 00:28:27.760, Speaker C: Yeah, you kind of just dropped that in there really casually, Emma. But this is a big revelation for our existing community members as well as obviously anybody else who follows us. That obviously we'll be looking to launch an ERC 20 called CGG, which will, like Emma says, you'll be able to redeem CGCs through play to earn mechanics such as playing through the RPG, staking in the NFT mining game. And obviously beyond essentially claiming of CGG, which Aidan will probably cover in later slides, there should be opportunity for cashing that out.
00:28:28.770 - 00:28:51.702, Speaker D: Yeah, and on top of. So I just want to mention something. I guess we'll be viewing little pieces at a time. The CGG element, the token itself will also have defi elements to it. So essentially do expect being able to stake it and to be able to redeem back to various different tokens or even NFTs by staking that. So I just want to add that.
00:28:51.756 - 00:29:16.442, Speaker B: I want to reveal a little. And then you guys are revealing more. I can show you. We didn't talk about it. No, it's okay. Okay. We actually wanted to spend a little bit more time on show the design of the Kita because that's what we're here for today, is to have the chillin community to help us to design the kit.
00:29:16.442 - 00:30:08.190, Speaker B: So one of the key things that we're very proud of is that we're very lucky to have an artist who's a veteran artist, he's very experienced and he has helped us to design our different guardian, which I show in the next slide. So for our guardians, it actually takes about two months, believe it or not, a concept to design. And then our artist, who's so experienced, he has done work for big corporations like DC Comics, Nintendo, Disney and more. And right now, for those that who knows. And we use Decentraland, our artists actually have an art gallery. It's the CG, which is a chain guardian art gallery that actually including some of his artist personal art and some of the CG chain Guardian art that he developed for us is showcased in the Decentralland location, 52 94. For those who has Decentraland account, you can go check it out.
00:30:08.190 - 00:30:48.140, Speaker B: So in addition to. Besides spending a lot of time designing the art, we also have a script writer who's accredited and he's helping us to develop exclusive lore to tell a story about our guardian, which is building to our Guillen and then also for Bipsi, we also on the right hand side you can see we actually start a first series of comic which is featuring Bipsi for bitcoin, which is available on website right now. So that's something that we do. So besides just designing a Kyoto, we also build a story behind it. And then in addition we also start a comic series for our Kyoto. So that's something we can looking for for older Kyoto. But let's start with Bipsie and see how it goes and see if people like.
00:30:48.140 - 00:31:20.802, Speaker B: Ok. Ok. So on this slide it's actually featuring some of our key guardians. We actually have also some of the lower rank characters that's not displayed on here. So what I wanted to bring to your attention is just to give you a little bit more details how we actually go about to designing them. So the first one in the middle of course, is our poster girl and her name is actually Bitsy Naka. So by listening to her last name, you kind of can guess that we actually, because we know as we believe who is the creator of bitcoin.
00:31:20.802 - 00:31:47.722, Speaker B: So we give her her last name of Naka. It's like Nakimoto. So because of a japanese heritage, you can also see that she has this japanese store called Kentana, if I pronounce it correctly. So that's how we kind of design her. Okay. And then beside her, we designed a staff for Ethereum. We actually kind of referenced to the founder of Ethereum.
00:31:47.722 - 00:32:15.714, Speaker B: So that's how we kind of developed him. Very smart, intelligent guy. That's how we developed Seth. Lolita for Litecoin is another character we developed because she has some connection with bitcoin which we cannot reveal too much about her story. And that's why we actually develop her as a she because there was some connection between them. And then I also wanted to point out another project that's interesting is mujra for Matic. So what we did is similar with Chinglink.
00:32:15.714 - 00:32:49.774, Speaker B: We actually worked closely with matic executive team to develop the matic for footen. And then it's based on they wanted somebody to represent symbolized fundamental characteristic of matic and also the indian methodology they wanted to building for their curator. So they actually want a curator who's like self actualized, mindful. And then, so that's when we develop the Kyoto. We work with them closely to see what are some of the aspirants, what some of the characters that you would like to see in the Guardian. That's how we develop it. But very similar with Chain Guardian with Matic.
00:32:49.774 - 00:33:14.970, Speaker B: We also want to adopt the technology to address the scalability issue in the crypto space. Just with Chainlink. We actually want to work with not just developing a character. We also wanted to integrate on the technical side, which we'll talk about more in the coming slide. And on the bottom, actually, we just released this character named hero for Decentraland today. And then I put this little guy here just on top of today. Nobody sings it yet.
00:33:14.970 - 00:33:49.010, Speaker B: This is our 3d little guy Kyoto we developed because Decentraland is a 3d virtual world. So we also develop a mini 3d guy so that we can start to seek for more use case for hero. And then we develop him, although he looks like a very tough guy because he's a builder, but then he also has a soft side of him that he's actually very considerate, very patient. So there's something very interesting that when we develop for the Chinglink character, we also want your input to see what type of personality or character you feel that is the most suitable to represent Chinglink.
00:33:50.490 - 00:34:53.042, Speaker C: Yeah, I think as well, it's just worth adding, obviously. I think that the more holistic approach is to obviously follow the Twitter kind of vote that we have set up over at the Chainguardians Twitter, which I believe has been retweeted and supported by the smart contract. Chainlink smart contract Twitter feed is probably the most easy approach to take so that everybody's voice is heard. But we do go into a lot of detail and thought with regards to how the character is designed. So if you feel that you've got something really passionate about how you feel that he or she may look, then please do jump onto our Discord channel and be sure to interact with mainly Emma, who is predominantly our artist liaison about what that may know. We tend to try our best to make sure that those voices are heard.
00:34:53.196 - 00:35:27.138, Speaker B: Yeah, we're talking about maybe we should create a dedicated channel for changling to talk about how they want to design their guardian. That's something we should do as well. Yeah, and just to also wanted to mention, since Robbie just mentioned, this is actually the first time we're actually working directly with the community, such as the great community, such as changling, to design the Guardian. So our artist, he's aware of this and he's actually very excited that he cannot wait to know the results of the vote and hear some of the feedback from the community so he can get started with the concept design for the kilter. So just wanted to point that out as well. Normally we work with the exact negative team. But this time we said with the chainlink.
00:35:27.138 - 00:35:45.898, Speaker B: Chainlink also suggests that, you know what, we have a strong community and then they will be excited. We want to get them involved. We say, oh, that's such a great idea to get the community involved. So let's design a kilter together so that it's something that will totally represent Chainlink. And before I go away, that's the last one. Just say, coming soon from Chainlink. We still don't know.
00:35:45.898 - 00:36:16.366, Speaker B: It's a shadow kilter. And then beside it, there's actually another Kyoto that has question mark, just in case. If you're wondering what it is, we actually design a kilter for binance and then it's going to be a charity sale and it will be released in the coming month. So that's something exciting as well. So before I go away and finish with this page, I just want to say lastly, for most of our guardian, we actually minted very little. So we minted between 15 to 200 copies to keep the rarity. So, for example, for bipsie, there's only 15 bipsie.
00:36:16.366 - 00:36:35.914, Speaker B: And then it's because she's rare, so there will be only 15 lucky collectors or players can own her. And then she's actually the most powerful guardian in our ecosystem. And then we have a little bit more. For SAP, we minted about 30. And then Muja, we have a little bit more, I think 75. And then hero, we actually have 200. So on.
00:36:35.914 - 00:36:44.560, Speaker B: Whoops. I jumped to the next slide. So. Okay, I guess that means enough talking for me. So, Robbie, you want to take over from here? The slide just jumped. Means that they want me to stop.
00:36:45.570 - 00:37:56.194, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So essentially, this is our roadmap over the course of Q four this year and into Q one next year. As you can see, we originally conceptualized and formed chain Guardians in 2019, so we're still a relatively new project. We also essentially built and have a fully customizable, upgradable smart contract for our NFTs. Obviously, that's centered upon the Ethereum blockchain. Then we produced the first iteration of the NFT proof of stake mining game, which I showed you a demonstration of a demo of. And we've since revamped that quite significantly to what it now exists, as per our feedback with our community and as the demand and the progress of it progressed, essentially, then we released our mobile and web RPG beta and produced the in game marketplace.
00:37:56.194 - 00:39:24.866, Speaker C: The marketplace is still in development and still needs work, but that's also something that we are looking to improve upon also in Q three of this year, we essentially produced some NFT art, again on the basis of feedback from our community, whom we're very fond of our artist work, not just the Guardians, but some of his personal work. So we managed to convince him that some of our community want to obtain some of his own work. So we managed to get him into the NFT art field and you can see some of his works in the Decentraland art gallery. As Emma's previously said, coming soon in terms of next steps for us, we're looking to build a headquarters in Decentraland as we feel that that's a pivotal place to look to kind of expand our virtual empire from, in line with some of the likes of Matic, who produced virtual headquarters there. And especially in these times where, as we all know, coronavirus is kind of making things very difficult for those kind of real life meetups. Binance have recently, or binance us, should I say, I believe have recently built a virtual headquarters there. Lots of really large projects, and obviously we want to be in and amongst them, and we feel Decentraland is a fantastic place to build from.
00:39:24.866 - 00:41:00.270, Speaker C: With that regards also in Q four, our aim is to integrate the chain link VRF verifiable randomness functionality with our smart contract specifically for the chain link Guardian, which will essentially give users an equal opportunity for obtaining a guardian of a specific color, and there will be varying degrees of rarity on those particular colors. Now, aesthetically speaking it is only a color, but from a collector's perspective, obviously there is always value in rarity. So if you are a keen collector of either NFTR or you want a really super cool looking guardian in game, then there's your opportunity to basically AC chainlink VRF with a use case in blockchain gaming, but also get your hands on either cool character. Also. Beyond that, there are aims for us to integrate with chainlink VRF in other ways. We think it's got lots of different use cases. True randomness in terms of schemas and a lot of the tech elements which I done will probably talk a little bit better about than I will has been very difficult to achieve for something that's completely mathematically provable or based upon the most sound mathematical principles ever, such as his blockchain obviously is a mammoth task which Chainlink have achieved, which is absolutely phenomenal.
00:41:00.270 - 00:42:29.450, Speaker C: As a result, we want to utilize that for things such as randomness within our character statistics, and also randomness with other elements within our game where it's possible to use VRF. So we're really excited about that. Also in quarter one 2021 and commence development with a complete revamp of our website, which we feel obviously needs some updating now specifically with regards to community feedback, user experience and also the user interface and in line with that, the marketplace. So that it really begins to ensure that our tokenomics and our back end APIs are really clean and that the user experience on the front end is much more enjoyable long term. Aims into quarter two, quarter three 2021, we were hoping, or we're aiming to produce some 3D PvP player versus player scenarios in a 3d game world. Principally, we are in the process of evaluating where that would be best fit, but we obviously have strong links with several projects to essentially enable that to happen. Obviously Decentraland is a strong possibility, but we don't want to rule out anything at this stage.
00:42:29.450 - 00:43:38.194, Speaker C: Thanks, Emma. So this is a slide just to kind of allow people to visualize the Chainlink verifiable randomness function and how it will be worked or how it will be utilized, should I say, to allow players, which Gemma has previously touched on, to individualize the color of their guardians in terms of helping us design the Guardian on what that will look like? You can vote for that on Twitter. As we've previously mentioned, it is the pin to the top of our Twitter feed kindly been shared through the chat on YouTube by the chainlink guys. As I've said previously, the aim is to have some colors more rare than others. Thanks, Emma. So here's just a slide by slide walkthrough of these five tweets. The last of the five shows these images which you're about to see.
00:43:38.194 - 00:44:23.714, Speaker C: The first four indicate the different votes. Twitter has some kind of constricting poll dynamics, so we had to do it across multiple tweets. Apologies for that. So obviously, essentially, would you prefer male or female? Which do you feel best represents? Chain link from a kind of conceptual perspective, from a visual perspective, and also from a character perspective. So we've got male or female as number one. Number two, would you like to see a more like Beastiel type character in line with hero from Decentraland? A futuristic one, as we can see, is exemplified in Mudra formatic. Next slide, please.
00:44:23.714 - 00:45:34.134, Speaker C: Emma, if anybody is from the UK, at risk of sounding exactly like one of our chief medical officers. Next slide please. Number three is option three for your vote is whether you think of the Chainlink character would be quite friendly or quite temperamental. And I don't mean that we're not trying to present that as in, oh, Chainlink as a project are really temperamental and their workers are temperamental, or how they do things, because we know that that's not true. What we mean by that is, are they kind of doing things a little bit more radically in their approach, maybe even a better sort of definition within aggressive and innovative or steady and in line with the developments of the blockchain world? Because we try and hinge everything we do within chain guardians on these blockchain kind of elements. Four, it's a similar sort of principle, good or bad. And again, it's not like, are they a good or a bad project? Do you think the best represented as somebody who's kind of quite a badass? Sorry if I'm not allowed to say ass.
00:45:34.134 - 00:46:21.110, Speaker C: I've said it twice now anyway. Or representative was one of the good guys and we've got kind of already, I've just been checking the Twitter feed. There's kind of an interesting battle going on, so your votes will have opportunity to have an impact at this moment in time. Lastly, choose a name for your chainlink Guardian. It's difficult to say vote for a name. We did think about asking, like Keenan and Rory to come up with a few names and let you vote, but I think that they decided that actually have it a bit as a free for all. And then some of the best ones that come out of that, we'll actually plan on maybe giving some swag away for maybe a chain link t shirt or something cool that Keenan might be able to sort out for you.
00:46:21.110 - 00:47:01.326, Speaker C: But also we're looking to for the name that's picked, I think that it's safe to say that we should give them one of the Chainlink Guardians as kind of one of the giveaways. Any other cool one names that we like. We can airdrop some NFTs for our in game proof of state mining purposes. Finally, the social media, as we've said, there's a Twitter at the top chain underscore guardians. If you want to search for us, please do join Discord. We do have a telegram channel. We have to be honest, we filtered all of our kind of community through discord in the first instance because that's really where most gamers go, is to use discord.
00:47:01.326 - 00:47:25.398, Speaker C: Telegram is fantastic for your crypto related chat and whatnot. And we do want to build that community out without a doubt. But definitely get yourself on Discord and website. Chainguardians IO. Thanks, Emma. Is it the next slide, please? Scenario. Thank you.
00:47:25.484 - 00:47:30.406, Speaker B: Thank you. No, I muted so that I don't disturb you. Thank you.
00:47:30.588 - 00:48:02.926, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you guys a lot for presenting. And so again, with community that's out there listening right now, you really got to say, I really appreciate every single one of you tuning in today and everything that we do. And this is why we really want you guys to make the voice. And I know that each of you have a very strong voice of the direction that you view the community yourself. So let your voice be heard in this. And a really cool initiative with one of the chainlink ecosystem projects. And go and vote.
00:48:02.926 - 00:48:35.500, Speaker A: I dropped the link in a few times, but make your voice heard. We're not stopping the count on this one. You can go and vote on this and make sure that your voice is heard. But I think this really highlights the diversity of our community and our ecosystem. We have VRF, a lot of different things that are being built by some really amazing teams and cool people. So show some support. Go retweet it, go vote and make your voice heard.
00:48:36.990 - 00:48:37.980, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:48:41.170 - 00:48:42.490, Speaker A: I think you're muted, Robbie.
00:48:42.570 - 00:49:09.066, Speaker C: Oh yeah. I just wanted to reiterate, thank you so much for having us on and thank you to all the chainlink community who have tuned in and watched. And yeah, we really hope that you do get involved and vote. I think you should definitely say a final word before we drop off, just to underline a little bit. Just maybe a couple of bits that were skirted over regards to kind of.
00:49:09.248 - 00:49:18.666, Speaker B: Maybe something about chain link, how chain guardian can benefit from chainlink community and also decentralized oracle.
00:49:18.858 - 00:49:34.290, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. I think it's very exciting that mainly because. Sorry, bear with me 1 second. I'm trying to handle the kids working for home kids noise.
00:49:36.630 - 00:49:42.018, Speaker B: He has two little young kids, so sometimes if you manage one, there's another one.
00:49:42.184 - 00:49:52.486, Speaker A: No. Yeah. And so again with everyone then that's listening in. Definitely join the discord. Know that there's a lot going on in there and make your voice heard.
00:49:52.588 - 00:50:43.626, Speaker D: That's all that kids are screaming in the back. I just want to say because I think VR is a very important function. It's going to be very important function for gaming in general because of there's two things, right? If you don't have true rendering factor, then a user can always hack, which means they know the next catch is going to have high probability of the desirable. So therefore they will try to reproduce and only do the catch when it's desirable. So then that kind of ruins the game for everyone else now, even now, because we know that's the case then what we did up till now is we had to use a pseudo random function in our back end. So which means we decide to be able to kind of hide it from the public. We decide how the renderance function is calculated and kind of try to leave it.
00:50:43.626 - 00:51:46.570, Speaker D: So when user come and try to catch something, it's truly rendered. However, you have the problem with the decentralized problem because we're in the decentralized blockchain, decentralized. So although we don't prefer, we think that's the best for the players in general, keeping it centralized. But then you have this problem of can they trust us? So I think for going forward, for gaming the Oracles is going to be very important and that will fundamentally change, like all the trustless matter, making games like truly decentralized, I think that's very important. Relating tokenomics, I think we pretty much cover everything. I think it'll be very exciting because finally we're tying all this, the elements of being able to do mining, that's what we started with, right? You're able to have your play to earn elements to get this CGC, which you can use it to play games. But now with the governance token, you can now actually be able to trade it for something of real value, right? Like trade it with other tokens.
00:51:46.570 - 00:52:02.420, Speaker D: So I think that will be very powerful. Especially now we're going to add another layers of defi. So able to stake it, able to kind of liquidity mine it. So I think that'll be very exciting once that gets rolled out. So looking forward for that.
00:52:03.430 - 00:52:14.360, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, thanks a lot for sharing that. It's really interesting. Cool. Is there anything else that Robbie, Emma that you want to add before we sign off here?
00:52:15.210 - 00:52:18.742, Speaker C: No, all good. Unless there's any really pressing questions from.
00:52:18.796 - 00:52:25.018, Speaker A: Anyone, how long is the vote open for. For people and when are you guys looking to make this final decision by?
00:52:25.104 - 00:52:27.466, Speaker B: I think Twitter limits seven days, right?
00:52:27.568 - 00:52:28.026, Speaker C: Correct.
00:52:28.128 - 00:52:29.740, Speaker B: Let's just leave it till maybe.
00:52:30.590 - 00:53:44.900, Speaker C: Yeah, so this time next week, basically because I opened about an hour prior to this time, is when the Twitter vote should end. Because like Emma says, that's what Twitter limited us to. So yeah, within the next week, drop on, cast your votes, obviously, then we'll tally them up in the interim. Keenan, obviously if there's any sort of support that we could put into place for perhaps people that might want to put forward a name suggestion for Chainlink, the Chainlink Guardian, and we can then work with you to essentially choose the top five options. We could then even potentially do a further vote for the name from there on Twitter for the favorite name out of those that were selected because essentially our artist will be able to begin his artistic process of creating the guardian. The name is not obviously as relevant to him in terms of his process. So we can crack on with that design element and we can obviously look to factor in people's voices once we've gone through that initial selection process of the.
00:53:47.110 - 00:54:09.500, Speaker A: So again, if you guys, your voice and your name for this character gets chosen, definitely happy to send you swag. And it sounds like you'll get a guardian out of this. Again, I really want to appreciate Emma, Robbie Idon for coming on here. Amazing work. The game looks sleek, the designs look amazing, the characters look really cool.
00:54:09.950 - 00:54:15.098, Speaker B: Congratulations. Thank you. We're actually looking forward to see how the chain link guardian is going to look like.
00:54:15.184 - 00:54:18.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I know some people have some ideas and they should be dropped from.
00:54:18.932 - 00:54:31.586, Speaker B: You know what, if they have any concept or if they happen to be artists and if they have something that artists are happy to see, anything that they want to move forward with. Yeah, share us with any ideas or.
00:54:31.688 - 00:54:33.250, Speaker A: They probably like animals.
00:54:33.830 - 00:54:45.894, Speaker B: Anything that they. No, no, seriously, I'm sure Chainlink has such a big community. Maybe you have an artist who's just as amazing. They want to say, you know what, I have some ideas I wanted to put forward. We're welcome to see that.
00:54:46.012 - 00:55:05.542, Speaker C: I'll create a channel on our discord specifically for that. And, Keenan, if yourself or are able to hop on there, if there's anything comes through through your channels and you want to just kind of copy and paste that across, that's also cool. And we can use that as a bit of a hub in our discord, that specific channel for the chainlink Guardian. That'd be awesome.
00:55:05.696 - 00:55:07.120, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you so much.
00:55:07.890 - 00:55:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, again, this really shows the diversity of our community, our ecosystem, and, yeah, I really want to thank the Chainlink community. Really grateful to be able to serve you guys and everything that we're able to do together and the ecosystem, it's amazing to see how far your game is coming and everything that you guys are building. So congratulations and we'll keep everyone updated. Definitely go and vote and join the discord and excited and maybe we can do this again at the beginning of the year and when everything gets launched.
00:55:38.642 - 00:55:39.494, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you.
00:55:39.532 - 00:55:54.590, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome. Thank you so much, guys. And I just want to say as well, thank you very much to Decentraland and Toonpunk for hosting this. I know that this was available or be streamed and viewed in the virtual world there, too. Thank you very much for them. Yeah, as well. Well, so thanks very much, guys.
00:55:54.660 - 00:55:57.966, Speaker B: Thank you, the chiling community, for participating today.
00:55:58.068 - 00:55:59.900, Speaker C: Yeah, please do get the votes in. Thanks.
