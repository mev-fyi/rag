00:00:05.370 - 00:00:48.086, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Hope everyone is having an awesome event. My name is Bret. I'm the grant program manager here, and today I'll do a little overview of the grant program. But the main portion of this is going to be conversation with some of our awesome grant recipients. So the grant program, in a nutshell is we deploy resources, right? We want to support the technology as well as the developer community we have. So we look to support the tech, the tools, the infrastructure, improving and expanding the chainlink network, along with education for our developer community, and ongoing resources to help developers along the developer journey.
00:00:48.086 - 00:01:36.998, Speaker A: Right? So today we have a few panelists that represent the different ways the grant program supports the growth and the development of the Chainlink community. It's also really interesting because we have teams at different stages of working with us. We have one team that's received multiple grants. We have a team that's been longtime, active, and supportive member of our community longer than I've been here, and one team that's recently received a grant. And we're kind of welcoming into the family, so to speak. So, with that being said, I will introduce the panelists as a brief overview. We have Margaret and Maury from protifier, a team that's been working with us through our integration grants.
00:01:36.998 - 00:02:12.342, Speaker A: We have Roger from Link river, who's researching and publishing solutions critical to the node operator community, and Tracy from this dot, who's essentially building an open source portal, sharing all the important resources available to the broader Chainlink community. So, with that being said, I'd love to have each panelist kind of introduce themselves and their organizations, and we can go from there. So, Margaret and Felipe from protifier, if you'd like to kick us off.
00:02:12.476 - 00:03:04.018, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to start. Thank you, Bret, for that introduction. So, my name is Margaret. I'm an operations lead at Protofire, and we are very thankful to the Chainlink team for having this great opportunity to talk more about us, and especially about work that we are doing around the chain link ecosystem. So, a few highlights about us. We are a team of more than 40 engineers, and since 2016, we've been contributing to some great projects in the blockchain space, including, of course, chain link, Gnosis, Kyber Network, synthetics, Makerdao, uniswap, Opin Aragon, and a few more, which we can't disclose. Unfortunately, we are continuously improving protofile to be a machine that attracts, builds, and retains engineering teams for protocols and DAOs.
00:03:04.018 - 00:04:12.422, Speaker B: And the way we function is that the team picks a Dow or project to work on. Then we start with the first small engagement, and then we move on to building a dedicated team. And I would say that our goal and unique specialty is to help layer one, L2, cross chain and Oracle networks and some selected DeFi protocols to bootstrap demand site to accelerate developer adoption. And with that in mind, we shape dapps protocol modules, develop smart contracts, work also on developer tooling and integrations. And besides, what I would like to share is as part of our hosting services, we are also running the second biggest indexer node in the graph network as far as the amount of delegations with a total value of GRT staked at around $11 million. And we have also developed more than 30 open source subgraphs for Ethereum projects. We are also participating as relayers and validators on XDai Avalanche meter and helping projects to further decentralize their infrastructures.
00:04:12.422 - 00:04:28.194, Speaker B: And we're also providing the main RPC endpoint for the Filecoin network, which is one of the core network endpoints. So this is a little bit about us and yeah, thank you, Brett. Hope this gives a good idea about who we are, what we do.
00:04:28.392 - 00:04:32.660, Speaker A: Very good overview. It sounds like you are involved in a lot of exciting things.
00:04:33.190 - 00:04:35.300, Speaker B: Trying to be, yeah, definitely.
00:04:35.990 - 00:04:37.860, Speaker C: There's a lot of places to be.
00:04:39.030 - 00:04:42.920, Speaker A: All right, cool. So Roger, you want to go next?
00:04:43.290 - 00:05:46.506, Speaker D: Sure. Hey everybody, I'm Roger, co founder of Linkbrovo. We are a community driven chain link node service provider, meaning that we are operating chain link nodes on various blockchains, side chains and L2 solutions, testnets and mainnets. We are, besides this, participating in the decentralized price feeds and heavily focusing on research and documentation all around chaining node operations and related services. And yeah, Rob and I, Rob, the other co founder, recently joined the developer expert program launched by Chainlink Labs, which focuses on supporting the Chainlink developer community. So we want to educate as many people as possible about decentralized Oracle networks, hybrid smart contracts, external adapters and everything related to it. And so, yeah, that's a brief overview of Link Row, and I'm happy to be here.
00:05:46.506 - 00:05:57.518, Speaker D: Thanks for having us. And yeah, we were recently awarded a chilling community grant, which we're really happy, grateful and honored about. And so, yeah, happy to join the conversation here with you guys.
00:05:57.684 - 00:06:07.118, Speaker A: Awesome. It's great to have you, Roger, and great to see you again. All right, and last but not least, Tracy, you want to give an overview of Bistot?
00:06:07.294 - 00:06:35.082, Speaker E: Sure. Hi, my name is Tracy. I am the CEO of a company called Bistot Labs. We are a consultancy of about 50 developers. We are 100% remote worldwide, but a lot of us are based in the US. I myself am an RXJs core team member and a Google developer expert, as well as a Microsoft MVP. Same with my co founder, who was previously Google and the team.
00:06:35.082 - 00:07:23.274, Speaker E: So you know, just kind of best in breed consultancy and we're so excited to get this grant and be working with Chainlink on some really exciting things. We work with some amazing other folks and we're kind of dipping our toes in and starting to spread the education about the amazing ecosystem. So I love was I was part of when the JavaScript ecosystem was developing and I love seeing this ecosystem starting to develop and be a part of that. So we get to work with some amazing customers like Twilio, Google, Roblox, Wikimedia, T Mobile, Cloudinary, PlayStation, et cetera, et cetera. And this is just going to be a really fun project and our entire team is really excited about it.
00:07:23.472 - 00:07:49.010, Speaker A: Awesome. So I think that was everyone did great introductions and I think maybe we'd like to dive into some of the Chainlink specific work as it relates to some of the grants we've handed out. So I guess we can start with Margaret and Maury from protifier, maybe talking a little bit about the projects and working with Chainlink.
00:07:50.150 - 00:08:45.560, Speaker C: Yeah, so what we've done, basically we've focused most of our work in actually making integrations into other blockchains. So the first integration that we did for the chaining stack into other blockchains was the XDI integration. We actually helped set up price fits on there, and from there we started going into other blockchains. So we helped the avalanche integration. We helped with plasm and with cello. Those were the first ones and we are expecting to get a lot more. Also, we actually worked on helping developer it.
00:08:45.560 - 00:09:50.540, Speaker C: There's the testnet link faucet that we worked on on a very short notice, but we are really happy with the way it turned out. It's basically a faucet that provides link tokens to developers all over the ecosystem. We support over six different testnets from different providers, so on Fuji, on POA networks, on coven. And the idea is to help developers all over the ecosystem, wherever they might be, whatever the technology they might prefer, be able to use the chain link infrastructure to power their applications. That's most of what we did. And we have received a couple of grants recently, mostly related to scalability. So scaling chain link outside of Ethereum One.
00:09:50.540 - 00:10:24.098, Speaker C: So doing some QA on integrations on other EVM networks, helping chainlink expand to other networks themselves which are not really EVM compliant. Like for example Polkadot based or maybe Solana one day and yeah, helping with bridges and analyzing stuff. There's a lot of things to do. We are excited for the future.
00:10:24.264 - 00:10:24.546, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:10:24.568 - 00:11:16.486, Speaker A: And I think you bring up a good point, and this is something that I bring up in conversations with potential grant recipients or new grant recipients. I think there's a couple of points there. But one I think is we really want to get to know the people that we're working with. And I think the goal of a lot of these grants and a lot of the projects is to get comfortable to the point where there could be another grant or another project. Right. So it's not necessarily that we want these to just be we're issuing a grant and you fix this and then it's C in a year or two. I think what protifier has really proved over time is that once you're in our community and you're working with us and you're doing a really good job, then we want to work more with you.
00:11:16.486 - 00:11:52.398, Speaker A: Right. I think that's interesting. From a different perspective with Roger and Link river, you guys are super active in our community. When you send in an application for a grant, everyone knew who you were and they were super excited to see that you were proposing new stuff to work on and work with us on. So I think that's a good segue to Roger if you want to talk a little bit more about your project. But then also how we got there, right?
00:11:52.564 - 00:12:21.770, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. It's interesting. Plus, to catch up on protofire, I want to send out a shout out because your work has been really beneficial for us as node operators as well. The token forces the new integrations on several networks. Yeah, we're really grateful for the work and we really value it a lot. So keep it up. And yeah, now to us, to our project, it's called Nodelocks link.
00:12:21.770 - 00:13:11.254, Speaker D: And maybe first how we got there. So yeah, as I already said, we're constantly researching the new advances about node operations and we've been busy spinning up our testnet nodes and various chain link nodes. We ran into all possible warn and error logs and sometimes you feel a bit left alone. So in general we thought about, okay, we should launch a website or provide some additional documentation besides the official chain link docs, which are awesome because spinning up chain link nodes is really limitless. You can always improve your setup. There are several setups and deployments for different use cases. And we thought about, okay, let's launch a website with different guides for different node setups, which was a pretty big scope.
00:13:11.254 - 00:14:33.262, Speaker D: And then we started conversations with you and we had some really nice chats with you and other team members and somehow we ended up saying wouldn't it be great to focus on the essentials and to initially launch website which focuses on displaying and categorizing all relevant or the most relevant and frequently occurring logs a chain of node produces. And now we're talking about warned error logs because that's mostly what you're interested in when you're trying to troubleshoot and debug. And so yeah, we came up with the idea to launch nodelocks link and it will focus on displaying, categorizing and explaining the origins of the node logs that are produced. And it will also provide debugging solutions so that the whole troubleshooting process for aspiring and established node operators can be facilitated. And we'll of course constantly update it. And this will be the initial, first version of the website. And what you mentioned earlier, Bret, the great thing is that it's not that we are building one product and then we're not working as a freelancer for the chaining ecosystem, but we are aiming at staying a long term member of this ecosystem and enjoying those virtual cycles.
00:14:33.262 - 00:15:07.760, Speaker D: We're already seeing here protofire launching critical infrastructure for node operators, for chaining services in general. And they've been receiving several grants. And yeah, we hope to do the same and build up a long term relationship with chaining ecosystem we're anyway really closely in contact with. And so it's been a great process. We're really grateful and we're enjoying every conversation. It's always really inspiring and great to work with like minded and open minded people.
00:15:08.530 - 00:15:55.306, Speaker A: Awesome. And it's great to hear that you guys are doing the new kind of developer expert program. Excited to see kind of all the different developer relations and education stuff that we can kind of grow out over the course of the next year. I think your application journey was pretty interesting in that the final project wasn't necessarily what the application was, and I think it was a very collaborative and iterative process. Right. So we hopped on the phone, we talked about the application. I kind of was like hey, to the rest of the team members, is this interesting? And then we just kind of hopped on the phone with Frank, who's, I believe he's the node operations community manager.
00:15:55.306 - 00:15:55.822, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:55.956 - 00:15:57.866, Speaker D: Big, big shout out to Frank.
00:15:57.978 - 00:15:59.280, Speaker A: Yeah, Frank's the man.
00:16:00.130 - 00:16:00.880, Speaker D: Definitely.
00:16:01.410 - 00:16:35.740, Speaker A: Yeah. If you ever get a chance to meet with, definitely take it. He's a really cool guy, but I think that's really important that we wanted to have the conversation. Right. How do we get to where this is something that we can, this is what we're going to build and this is how we get there and this is how it's going to be beneficial to the community. And we looked in Stephen Fluan, who's our head of developer relations. He's know, this is how I think, based on my past experience, is how we should go and build something.
00:16:35.740 - 00:17:01.780, Speaker A: So for those people who are watching that are saying, hey, I'd love a grant, I don't know what it is it would be for. Apply and talk about your experience, the problems that you're looking to solve, your expertise and how you'd be able to solve them. And if there's meat to the bone, we'll figure something out that's beneficial to everyone.
00:17:02.310 - 00:17:17.062, Speaker D: Yeah, I can totally agree. Just go for it. Don't hesitate. Even if you might think, oh yeah, if you're hesitating or anything, just go for it. Send your application, you will get an answer. Bret is really communicative. I can confirm this.
00:17:17.062 - 00:17:29.020, Speaker D: And the whole chaining team brings in a lot of expertise. I think there are some of the most talented people in the whole blockchain space, so go for it. If you have the chance, take it and enrich the whole ecosystem. It's just awesome.
00:17:29.550 - 00:18:15.900, Speaker A: Awesome. I think also this is a perfect segue to Tracy and this dot and your project because much like the process of Roger's application, right, to getting to a project, the project that we're going to be working on together through the grant is going to be a living, breathing project that's collaborative between us and again, Stephen and developer relations. So I'd love to learn maybe more about the project and then maybe you guys are certainly experts in this, building developer communities, educating developers. So maybe you can give us some insights into your experience there as well.
00:18:16.750 - 00:18:55.718, Speaker E: Sure. Yeah. Again, I think this is really awesome. And we really love being a part of this because one of the reasons why I even got into anything development is because I love building communities and our entire team feels the same way. Right. Like we have one of our pillars at our company is making the developer world a better place. And I love what I'm hearing from what Roger is doing because the project that we're actually going to be working on with this grant is creating this open source website that's going to host all the important ecosystem resources in any developer community.
00:18:55.718 - 00:19:46.374, Speaker E: You look at education and hey, where do I get started? Where do I go find. This is the biggest problem and there can never be enough education or information out there to provide people. So that's going to be really amazing. And I just love the idea of again, creating something. And so glad Chainlink is supporting this to make developing for this ecosystem a lot easier for everybody. And I think the amazing part of this as well is hopefully we're still kind of trying to figure out how much of the website content is curated, how much is curated by the community, et cetera, et cetera. But it is going to be a really great way for those who are producing content to have a place for people to find it.
00:19:46.374 - 00:20:22.420, Speaker E: So I think generally it's just going to really uplift that system. In all the communities that I've been a part of in building this again is always the same thing, right? You look at angular, you look at react, you look at all these things. Sure there's documentation, sure there's this place to go, but if we can create like the master place to go, I mean that's always the vision and that's always, I think, the goal and the hope of any community to be able to have something like that.
00:20:23.190 - 00:21:45.806, Speaker A: Awesome. And then again, Tracy, you have a lot of experience in terms of community building education training. This is something that's coming from a startup venture background. Moving to kind of early stage, early early stage open source startup and then joining Chainlink Labs a few months ago is I'm learning more and more about kind of the importance of documentation, but also the strategic value of that education. Right? So it's different to have a GitHub than it is to have a developer expert program or training courses or actual real world examples where it's not just lines of code and a readme where it's walking you through how you actually build a defi app using price feeds. Right? So I think there's a lot of nuances in there. I was wondering if maybe you can talk a little bit in terms of why is it important for us to focus on education, training, documentation and how that relates to the community.
00:21:45.806 - 00:22:00.658, Speaker A: And then I think that would also segue really well into maybe Roger commenting on that too, because he's been a part of that. How do we figure it out? Journey in terms of learning how to fix broken things and stuff like that too, right?
00:22:00.744 - 00:22:43.114, Speaker E: Absolutely. Well, I'll give you a few examples. One example is react documentation. And in JavaScript in react they went from class components to hooks and unfortunately the react docs and we're actually helping the team right now fix the react docs or update the react documentation. But right now if you go to the react documentation, it tells you to use class components. It doesn't really talk about hooks as first and that's actually not the case. In reality, most of the people who are learning react right now should be learning hooks and or are already learning hooks.
00:22:43.114 - 00:23:27.054, Speaker E: So it's kind of confusing, right? And I think anything that's confusing that makes it difficult for developers to get started is just not healthy because people give up. I'll give you a great example. I was trying to figure out a new way to deploy my website and I was exploring all the new different options, thinking hey, I should try something new, right? And I went to a bunch of the different sites and I was exploring Netlify. And Netlify was so funny because I literally went through probably three steps and had already deployed my site. I didn't even know I was deploying my site. It's just that everything was so well set up that all of a sudden it was just done for me. And that was really powerful because obviously I just use natalify because it was already done.
00:23:27.054 - 00:23:34.958, Speaker E: So I think as we build more education within communities, it just makes it so much easier for people to say.
00:23:35.044 - 00:23:36.142, Speaker B: Hey, I can do this too.
00:23:36.196 - 00:23:45.220, Speaker E: Hey, I can develop my first smart contract. Look how easy it was. And it really encourages people to start taking the next step into becoming more part of the community.
00:23:46.410 - 00:23:57.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's awesome. Roger, I'd be curious to hear maybe some of your comments or experiences around our community and the education process and.
00:23:57.324 - 00:24:40.678, Speaker D: Stuff like, I mean, obviously chaining developer community and community in general is awesome. It's unique and it's sharing community and economy. And when we first came up with our initial questions while spinning up chaining nodes, of course, the go to point is the Discord server, the official Discord server, and the node operator channel, which is great, super helpful. There are many, many great people around who will always support you, always respond to your questions. But we also recognized, okay, ironically, also in a call with you guys, Steven said, well, you have an example of an error log right here. Copy paste it on Google and see if something comes up. And there was no search result.
00:24:40.678 - 00:25:25.102, Speaker D: And this is something we really want to change. We want to make education accessible. We want to make all the knowledge and the experiences accessible through web browsers, of course. I mean, we have stack overflow, which is great, but we want to create the go to point for Chainlink node operators because seeing the need in the near future for hundreds and thousands of independently operating dance and Chainlink hybrid smart contracts. We will need more and more chain link node operators to contribute to those dance. And so we really want to lower the barrier of entry so that as many people as possible can just say, okay, I want to spin up chaining nodes. It sounds awesome.
00:25:25.102 - 00:26:24.130, Speaker D: I know it's a lot of stuff to learn, but yeah, I can easily look up the missing pieces or facilitate troubleshooting by having great resources. I think it's way easier to look it up on a search engine or go to the Discord channel node operators discord channel on Discord, ask a question, get linked to an existing website and then maybe even make a proposal. Hey look guys, maybe there's something missing. How can we edit? And yeah, I think it's the most important thing to spread the word, to just motivate as many people as possible to learn. We recently saw the chain link developer boot camp, which was a huge success with thousands of new people learning how to write smart contracts. And we want to achieve the same for node operators. We want to encourage everybody to spin up chaining nodes, although it might be a lot of stuff initially to learn, but it's not impossible.
00:26:24.130 - 00:26:34.026, Speaker D: Everybody can do it. And yeah, we are happy to just contribute to this whole process and to make this whole unique ecosystem awesome.
00:26:34.128 - 00:27:09.670, Speaker A: Awesome. We don't have a ton of time left, but Maury, any final thoughts around maybe kind of working with us? I know one of the things I hear about you guys is how awesome your documentation is, right? And I think what's interesting in terms of the work that you do is there's known unknowns for every project that you do, right? So a lot of the process that you go through in terms of this integration work, you're educating us, right? You're poking holes in the beast and seeing what fails and doesn't work so that we can fix it and integrate.
00:27:15.850 - 00:28:45.700, Speaker C: What we are trying to figure out is always how do we provide access to the technology and maybe some documentation to you so that you know, hey, let's see, this blockchain has this particular problem or this particular thing that you might be needing to be aware of. And also with every iteration we always produce kind of a document which educates both us and some other developers who might not really be into Chainlink or into what we do, but serves as sort of a summary of what they can expect when they integrate with that particular blockchain. So I think that's a really valuable tool. And what I think personally, that we really need to work on as a community is on documentation and making everything accessible. In that I agree with Roger and Tracy. Bringing more people in is a matter of giving them the tools and giving them the access to information that they need to start building their dreams and building what they can think of.
00:28:46.970 - 00:29:53.878, Speaker A: I think that's a perfect point. And I think to anyone watching, I think a lot of people think that they have to approach me in discord or apply for a grant because they have this solution already and they're proposing that solution. But I think it's really interesting if you just hey, there's this issue or this issue in documentation or I'm trying to learn about this feature and I can't find an answer anywhere that I want to know about because that we want to fix and that we want to find the right teams to fix that. So I think it's really important to note that if you have ideas around grants to reach out as well. Unfortunately, I believe our time is up. So I just wanted to give a final thank you to Margaret and Maury from protifier for joining and being an awesome integration partner. Roger from Link river, thank you for joining and being an awesome community member.
00:29:53.878 - 00:30:20.240, Speaker A: And Tracy from Nistot, thank you for joining. And I'm super excited to kick off our project and start building some kick ass resources for our developer community. So with that being said, if you want to apply for a grant, you can go to chain linkcommunity grants or join our official discord. And there is a grant channel in there that I am pretty active in. So feel free to reach out.
00:30:21.650 - 00:30:34.420, Speaker F: All you have to do is build it. I think that's a theme of the conference so far, as a quote from Sergey's keynote the first day, and we see that coming to fruition with many of our grant recipients and the other apps that we've seen.
