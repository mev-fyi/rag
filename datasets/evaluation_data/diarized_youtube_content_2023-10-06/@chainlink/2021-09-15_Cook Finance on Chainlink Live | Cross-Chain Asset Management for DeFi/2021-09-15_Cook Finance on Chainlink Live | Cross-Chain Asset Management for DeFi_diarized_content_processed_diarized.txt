00:00:01.210 - 00:00:20.080, Speaker A: The chatter around it chilled out a little bit, but TVL has increased like it's being used more than ever. So it may not be the biggest topic on Twitter, on crypto Twitter, but it's still very highly used, if not more so than a year ago. We're five times as big as the beginning of the year, if not more.
00:00:20.450 - 00:00:42.790, Speaker B: Yeah, it's true. I mean, I was just looking up some stats recently, and TVL, it's continued to increase. I mean, it went through a little bit of a low period just recently, but it's still going back up right now as we speak. And so I think it's only the beginning. And so there's so much potential in the space that don't need to worry about the small little dips that we have here and there. It's a long term future that we're all building out for.
00:00:42.860 - 00:00:47.190, Speaker A: Let's start this up. I want to learn a lot more about Cook finance. Are you ready to tell us all about it?
00:00:47.260 - 00:00:48.166, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:00:48.268 - 00:01:10.882, Speaker A: All right. It's Chainlink Live. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Nathan from Cook Finance. We're going to learn all about this DeFi platform and their indices and ux and all their products. I want to remind you, the audience viewing, we can see your questions.
00:01:10.882 - 00:01:20.166, Speaker A: So if you've got questions for Nathan, feel free to drop them here. We'll get to those when we can. But first, let's learn a little bit about cook. What is Cook finance? What makes it special?
00:01:20.348 - 00:01:55.794, Speaker B: Yeah, so just to tell you about Cook finance, basically it's a DFI asset management platform. And so Cook Finance was actually founded in 2020. Our CEO and CTO, Adrian and Cage worked in Silicon Valley for a number of years. They worked at companies like Google, Dropbox, C, three, AI, and in their spare time they were working on actually a centralized asset management platform. But during last year, and like the DFI summer, they saw huge potential in the DFI space. So they decided to basically create a new platform in the DeFi area. And so that's how the idea for Cook finance was started.
00:01:55.794 - 00:02:26.070, Speaker B: And then since then, they assembled the team, wrote up a white paper, and basically have been chugging along really well since then. This year, back in April, we launched RTGE. A month after that we launched Testnet. And then a month after that we launched Mainet. And since then, we're just kind of heads down releasing new product features for the platform. And it's really exciting in terms of what we're developing for this platform, and then to kind of go a little bit deeper into what the cook platform actually is and does. What we like to kind of use is an analogy to the cooking theme.
00:02:26.070 - 00:03:10.262, Speaker B: Her name is Cook. And so that's a really good way to kind of explain what we do to other people who are maybe not familiar with what the platform is or the cook finance does. And so basically, what cook finance is is it's basically like a two sided marketplace where we have individuals who we like to call our guests, who come to the restaurant to select from a different menu of different types of indexes. And then we also have chefs on the other side of the platform who are the ones who actually create and structure and strategize about how to create different strategies within the crypto space for all these different types of indexes on the platform. And so that's what we basically like to say, is that we have guests on one side, and then we have chefs on other coming together on the cook platform to create amazing opportunities in Defi. And so that's a little bit about.
00:03:10.396 - 00:03:28.718, Speaker A: I was going to ask, I noticed on your webpage you talk about your users as guests, and I thought that was a significant choice. So it was interesting to hear that come up right away. It looks like that there's a big emphasis on user experience and the UI. Is that something you guys focus on and have thought about a lot of?
00:03:28.804 - 00:03:57.094, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. We want to make it easy to use. Defi can be a complicated world, especially for people who are new to the area. And so we really kind of want to simplify and just make it really easy for anyone to kind of get started. In the world of Defi asset management, whether it be viewing different types of indexes on the platform or learning about the different assets or the descriptions or the strategies of the different indexes. And so we just want to make it really simple to use, and that's what we've done in terms of building.
00:03:57.132 - 00:04:24.846, Speaker A: Out the UI to be very mean indexes. When I was doing my research about cook, indexes really stood out as something that you guys are pushing as kind of a core product, a core feature. How do those play into the system? Is it that the cooks, or, sorry, the chefs, are creating indexes that may perform in different ways and that the guests can use them, but then there's yield farming elements along with that. Can you talk just a little bit.
00:04:24.868 - 00:05:04.170, Speaker B: About how that works? Yeah, for sure. I mean, that's the beauty of the platform, is that basically the sandbox where you can basically create any type of index on the platform. And we provide the tools to do that. Actually, just recently we launched a dow, and so we're enabling the community to come up with new ideas on coming up with new indexes for the platform. And also, too, we're actively looking for people within the finance industry to help come up with new strategies and indexes to put onto the platform for our guests, basically to select from. And so there are a lot of different things that we're doing. We're also working on a number of different partnerships with other protocols in the DeFi space to create different types of indexes.
00:05:04.170 - 00:05:14.734, Speaker B: So basically, there's tremendous opportunity on the platform. And that's what's really appealing about the platform, is that we're building the tools for people to create amazing opportunities in d five asset management.
00:05:14.862 - 00:05:51.478, Speaker A: So, like, for example, if I want to build a web three infrastructure index, I could choose tokens, right? Essentially crypto assets that represent the use of infrastructure. So I could choose the graph, I could choose Chainlink, I could choose Ethereum. That's kind of like a fundamental layer one, and those sorts of tokens, and I can bundle them into an index on my own. Is that the sort of idea? Or I could say, no, no, I'm just going to do straight money markets like defi savings protocols, base level, I'm going to do curve, I'm going to do aave, I'm going to do synthetic, some of these really core ones. Is that the idea? I can kind of build and mix.
00:05:51.494 - 00:06:28.150, Speaker B: And match my own exactly. I mean, if you just think about the Lego analogy, you can kind of put together different types of assets. You can put specific parameters around them, such as a rebalancing period, like monthly, every two months, even as short as one day if you really wanted to. And so there are all these different capabilities that you could do for the examples that you just stated, and that's what really makes it exciting. And so basically, yeah, there are going to be new indexes launching on the platform this year, some from the community, some that we work with through partners and stuff, like around the infrastructure. You said definitely, it's a really good idea. So I'm sure that we can share that with the community and get their involvement.
00:06:28.650 - 00:06:30.002, Speaker A: Yeah, make an index.
00:06:30.146 - 00:06:33.606, Speaker B: And so we definitely start a new thread discussion.
00:06:33.718 - 00:07:06.866, Speaker A: Oh, I'm a storyteller, so I don't know all the performance. I'm so terrible when it comes to the market stuff. But the story of infrastructure, I can tell a story about that, or the story of yield farming. So that's what excites me. That's what I kind of like about indices, is you could take a look and say like, oh, well, here's their thinking in this. And it kind of fits in, it kind of fits naturally in my brain, at least as to what this particular fund is aiming to achieve. And then this idea of there's a community that can decide, here's what those indices will be, and then you've got your users who can decide for that or not.
00:07:06.866 - 00:07:08.098, Speaker A: It's an interesting model.
00:07:08.184 - 00:07:44.526, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And that's kind of the benefit, is that we really try to involve the community and decision. So if there are changes that someone thinks would be a good change to help improve the performance of a specific index, they can do that. And then people can have a discussion about it. And then if it seems like a good idea, then we can put it to a vote and get that proposal enacted. And so that's kind of the beauty of really kind of involving the community, because there are a lot of different things and new ideas that kind of sprout out from the world of defi. And sometimes I'm sure there are some good ideas that the community has that could bring to life and help improve many different indexes on the platform when.
00:07:44.548 - 00:08:07.702, Speaker A: You'Re building an index. So there's like an index automation engine or something in there, in the cook platform. What are some of the things that you have to think about when you're creating an index? That normal user like me, I might just buy some assets and they're in my portfolio and I kind of call them an index, but that's not really what it is. So when it comes to actually building an index, what are some things that people or developers might have to think about that they might not know about?
00:08:07.836 - 00:08:53.606, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I think it's a quite complex process, but there are a number of things, some things you mentioned, right. Just picking different types of assets. So if you're looking for to create a specific index, let's say, about growth opportunities in the DeFi world, you're going to have to stay up to date on what the latest protocols are once they're getting massive traction, things like that. And so that takes a lot of work to make sure that you're up to date on the latest tokens. And then also, too, is kind of what I mentioned before too, is if you're going to do a rebalancing on a regular period, you want to know what's the right frequency to do that different metrics to involve. And also we have new features that we'll be launching too, on the platform that allow different things such as yield bearing opportunities and also looking to switch out different assets at different times automatically and things like that.
00:08:53.606 - 00:09:08.890, Speaker B: So basically those are kind of the things that you have to kind of build into the smart contract for each of the index. And that's a quite a complicated procedure to do. And so our team is quite well versed in that area. And so we can basically create any type of index you could imagine.
00:09:09.390 - 00:09:39.350, Speaker A: So let's take rebalancing as an example because I think this is actually easy. You can break this down to understand in indices a little bit more is if I make an index and it's Ethereum and Ave, the two tokens wrapped ETH and Ave, and that's it. It's just those two. It's still an index, right, exactly. And I want it to be 50 50. So half of it is ethereum and half of it is Ave. But then the price of Ave, let's say, just goes crazy and it goes way up.
00:09:39.350 - 00:09:45.830, Speaker A: Suddenly your index isn't 50 50 anymore, it's 75 25 because of the price change.
00:09:45.900 - 00:09:46.182, Speaker B: Sure.
00:09:46.236 - 00:09:56.060, Speaker A: And so when you rebalance, you're selling off some of that for profit or for stablecoins or for ETh or what happens in that situation.
00:09:56.590 - 00:10:38.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So then if, let's say, for example, you have two different assets in one index and you're basically selling off or one of them because the price have increased tremendously over a time period, then you basically would just sell that off and then basically rebalance the positions for those. And they kind of basically put into the other assets to make sure they're balanced and have equilibrium or whatever percentage split that you want for those two different assets. And basically that's how it works. And everything is just built into the smart contract. So that can happen on a regular basis. Let's say if you put a rebalancing period of once every month, then it will basically utilize the price fees from Chainlink to kind of find the prices at the current time period and rebalance those assets within that index.
00:10:39.042 - 00:10:47.386, Speaker A: So that's what you guys are using Chainlink for, is to find the prices within an index so that when you rebalance, you get accurate market prices. So when all that.
00:10:47.488 - 00:11:06.958, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly too. And then also when people are getting into the various different indexes on the platform, if they're issuing EtH, then they'll make sure to calculate the correct price, or ETH for the underlying assets. They're either getting the CK token for the same time. And so that's basically how we're integrating chain link to make sure that we're providing accurate price information.
00:11:07.044 - 00:11:27.814, Speaker A: Right. If you have an index with ten tokens in it, I'm not going to put in ten tokens, I'm going to buy that index with Eth or whatever the base asset is. Oh, okay, that makes sense. All right. That's how it's different than LP, for example, or other D five things is like you need to put in a bunch of the base asset so it's kind of a gas savings and then you still get exposure in this way.
00:11:27.932 - 00:12:06.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's a feature that we're building out as a single token issue. And then also currently you can do individual assets by issuing those individually. It's of course a much more complex and gas consuming process, but you can do that. But we also have another feature that I think is really good too. It's called batch issuing. And so that enables people to basically pool their orders together with others. And then whenever, let's say the gas price of EC is hopefully a little bit lower than normal, then they can actually execute that smart contract to acquire the CK tokens at the same time and help save on gas costs and kind of basically just distribute it out to all those individuals who are getting into those specific indexes.
00:12:06.670 - 00:12:22.842, Speaker A: And that makes sense. That's what we were talking about earlier with yield. Farming isn't just a weak flip. This isn't for like JPEG flippers and people who are in and out of markets fast. You have time to wait. And in crypto you may need to move fast still, but still you have time to wait until 04:00 a.m. Eastern or whenever that perfect time is.
00:12:22.896 - 00:12:26.266, Speaker B: Exactly until the smartphone can do that for you.
00:12:26.448 - 00:12:44.298, Speaker A: That's nice. I like that idea. Yeah. D five. Summer was crazy. You got to time those things out sometimes. I am learning a ton about indices and I'm actually getting some really just interesting ideas about the way you could use them in a lot of Defi protocols.
00:12:44.298 - 00:12:58.546, Speaker A: Just the way they rebalance in general is fascinating. And there's some interesting opportunities there, so I don't want to cut you off for anything. Oh, actually you were going to show us your UI. I want to see this platform too, and show this off. So please share that.
00:12:58.648 - 00:12:59.326, Speaker B: There we go.
00:12:59.368 - 00:13:00.870, Speaker A: So tell us what we're seeing here.
00:13:01.020 - 00:13:28.720, Speaker B: Yep, so basically this is the cook dap that you see here. And these are the two indexes that we currently have available. The first one is a crypto large cap index, and the second one is ETH DeFi index. And so it's a pretty simple platform to be able to track the price history of these specific indexes, shows underlying assets return, and then also information about the market cap, the price, the return, and the asset tier, too.
00:13:29.810 - 00:13:32.590, Speaker A: So what do you have in your Defi index? Can you.
00:13:32.740 - 00:13:34.660, Speaker B: Sure, we can go into that one.
00:13:36.150 - 00:13:56.310, Speaker A: Because there was a Defi index that somebody put out, a non crypto institution put out. That was definitely not a Defi index. So it's always interesting to see how people make these up. And you guys built these ones. This is like a cook said, this is like the starter pack. Like, here's DeFi. But then the community is coming in with other indexes in the future.
00:13:56.460 - 00:14:13.180, Speaker B: Exactly. So, yeah, we just wanted to get it started by providing these two first initial indexes just to show an example of what's capable of the platform. And then now that we have the dao, we're opening up to the community to come up with new ideas and new strategies to create and vote on adding new indexes to the platform.
00:14:13.710 - 00:14:19.114, Speaker A: So this is the ETH Defi index. EdI, it says up there. Is this a token? Is this a transferable.
00:14:19.242 - 00:14:20.318, Speaker B: Exactly, yes.
00:14:20.404 - 00:14:25.550, Speaker A: You can buy, I can go on uniswap and I can trade that for whatever. And it's just this defi. Oh, cool.
00:14:25.620 - 00:14:32.050, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So any new index that is created on the platform has a corresponding token that you can buy on an exchange.
00:14:33.350 - 00:14:40.630, Speaker A: Can you scroll down? Can we just see what you have? Because there's this portfolio allocation, too, so you can kind of see what makes it up there.
00:14:40.780 - 00:15:02.186, Speaker B: Exactly. You have the individual assets here, the portfolio allocation, the price, the value, the returns, and then information about the actual index itself. The objective methodology, basically kind of the strategy that the index creator utilizes for the specific index and any additional details like that.
00:15:02.288 - 00:15:16.734, Speaker A: This is stuff that I would be accustomed to seeing on a traditional finance sort of index as well. So that kind of shows to your guys experience and your background there. I like the look of this and the layout. The colors are beautiful as well. Props to your designer.
00:15:16.862 - 00:15:17.746, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:15:17.928 - 00:15:23.790, Speaker A: Do you have other elements live that you can show us, like staking or liquidity mining?
00:15:23.870 - 00:15:56.320, Speaker B: Yeah, we also have staking available here on the left side. Click on that. So we have a cook staking pool right now. And then we also have that available on the other chains that we have currently. And so we also have for OEC, BSE, and HEco and then for liquidity mining, we have one actually for our crypto large cap index currently, so that one's available on east and also KC. And then for buying cook, of course. And then that's pretty much it.
00:15:57.730 - 00:15:58.238, Speaker A: Cool.
00:15:58.324 - 00:16:16.130, Speaker B: This is like first kind of iteration that we have for the platform, but we're actively building out new features for it and a lot of exciting stuff in the pipeline. But, yeah, that's just kind of like a little bit of an overview of the various different aspects of the cook dap Ui.
00:16:17.510 - 00:16:41.050, Speaker A: Cool. We got a couple of questions from the audience for you. Will is giving us great questions, so I'm going to start feeding them to you. And let us take the discussion there. Just because we just looked at staking. I'm going to start at this staking question. Could you create, Will asks a staking asset index and be able to realize returns from the assets themselves as well as staking rewards.
00:16:42.290 - 00:17:02.946, Speaker B: So, yeah, we're actually going to be launching a yield bearing index very soon. And so that's a great opportunity to actually earn additional yield on top of the underlying assets. And so conceivably you could create any type of yield bearing index on the platform. And so that's definitely something that we're going to be billing out now.
00:17:02.968 - 00:17:08.070, Speaker A: Is that something that somebody would just take a distribution of weekly or monthly or annually or quarterly?
00:17:08.410 - 00:17:18.106, Speaker B: Yeah, that's how it can work with the smart contract. You can bring however you want. And so whatever frequency that you want to capture the rewards, you could do.
00:17:18.128 - 00:17:22.780, Speaker A: That, or you could auto compound. Could it just go back in and.
00:17:23.310 - 00:17:25.020, Speaker B: We just feed it right back in?
00:17:25.470 - 00:17:48.690, Speaker A: Cool. Good question. Yeah, we've talked a little bit about this one, but if users make their own index for community members to invest in, these users are the chefs in cook. Does that make the creator a portfolio manager? In a way. Do they manage it or is it managed up front when you build the smart contract? Right.
00:17:48.840 - 00:18:16.090, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so we're kind of exploring different opportunities in this space, and there kind of is a definition between, let's say, an index itself and also say, like, a portfolio manager. So we're kind of looking at different ways to offer both the opportunity to create an index or also kind of to manage a various different index strategy. And so they're both things that we're currently exploring right now. And so that's something that definitely we're considering.
00:18:17.950 - 00:18:56.322, Speaker A: Yeah, you're welcome, Will. Thank you for the great questions. We've covered a lot, actually, and I've had a really great, I've learned a ton about cooking. I've learned a ton about indexes. It seems like a really ripe opportunity space, too, for such a nascent industry. As we grow and we're starting to see NFT funds and NFT tokens just emerge as nfts get exciting. Are there something that people want to integrate into a portfolio? Do you want to get a broad based, super low cap index? Maybe that could perform well? Maybe there's a ton more risk there, really interesting opportunities to let people kind of specialize.
00:18:56.322 - 00:19:13.658, Speaker A: And that's one of the things that we've been seeing is there's so much going on in crypto now that it's hard to know about everything going on in nfts and everything going on in collectibles and everything going on in defi and everything going on on layer ones and blockchain. So indexes are a way to let somebody else specialize a little bit as well.
00:19:13.824 - 00:19:34.338, Speaker B: Exactly, and that's the beauty of the platform. So basically kind of creating an opportunity for anyone to come in with a good idea, get it approved to create an index, and then also have the community help make changes to the rebalancing period or different features of the index or the underlying assets themselves. And so that's really kind of the beauty of what the platform know.
00:19:34.424 - 00:20:01.982, Speaker A: I'm a marketing guy, so I love it when there's a great snapshot. That was a great snapshot. Nathan, you're going to have to go back. You're going to have to pull that one out because that's like a keeper quote for you. Really nicely summarized, Nathan, I want to learn, Will is asking, so I'm going to actually use this question for you as well. But Will is asking, are you hiring? That's question one. And so when we talk about where to find you, how to join your community and stuff like that, keep that in mind.
00:20:01.982 - 00:20:10.030, Speaker A: Right before we get to that, what's on the roadmap? Kind of. What are those next steps, like in the next couple of months that you guys are thinking about looking towards Q four at the end of this year?
00:20:10.100 - 00:20:48.038, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. There's a lot of stuff that we're working on, both from a product side and also a marketing side. And so one thing that we just recently launched was the Dow, as I mentioned earlier. And so we're going to do a lot of stuff around that. We're currently working with a number of different protocol partners to launch basically a Defi index on the platform that's in conjunction with all the different partners we're working with. So that's something that's really exciting coming up pretty soon. And then in terms of new tools for the actual platform itself, in terms of, for the chefs to create different types of strategies, we're going to be basically launching the capability to leverage or short assets.
00:20:48.038 - 00:21:17.010, Speaker B: And so that's a great opportunity for the chefs to kind of create different types of strategies. And then also, too, we're looking at various different types of scaling solutions. We know that liquidity and gas fees are really important for a good user experience on the platform. And so, as I mentioned before, we're building out the DAP on Polygon, also looking into other scaling solutions, such as arbitrum, and also optimize. And so those are things that are going to really help accelerate the performance of the platform and also add a lot of utility to the platform.
00:21:17.160 - 00:21:32.010, Speaker A: If you have questions that we didn't get to or that we weren't able to answer, please join communities. Nathan, where can people go? Like, where do you guys hang out? Are you mostly discord? Mostly telegram people have projects, have kind of different places where they live.
00:21:32.160 - 00:21:48.698, Speaker B: We're actively on telegram, and so they can go to cook underscore English, our telegram handle. If they want to track the latest announcements and developments, Twitter is the best place to go for that. So that's cook underscore finance, and of course, just our regular website, which you type in a URL. Cook finance.
00:21:48.794 - 00:22:07.234, Speaker A: Awesome. And those links are all down below in the description. So you guys can jump out, know, run a search for Nathan and try and ping him or other team members and community members. Sounds like you guys have an active community as well. Nathan, thank you so much for coming on. I appreciate you taking the time showing us around Cook and getting to know you a little bit as well. I appreciate that, man.

00:22:08.814 - 00:22:19.706, Speaker A: Yeah, let's catch up. I want to see kind of where cook goes, what your community comes up with, I'm really curious about. So maybe a couple of months, let's check back in again, and we'll see how you guys have grown. Does that sound good?
00:22:19.808 - 00:22:20.714, Speaker B: Yep, definitely.
00:22:20.832 - 00:22:22.090, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Peace, man.

00:22:23.790 - 00:22:39.806, Speaker A: I'm there. Join the Chainlink communities. Join the Cook finance communities. You can find me and chainlink on Twitter at chainlink, of course. And you can find at smart. Underscore contracts for a lot of content from Chainlink labs, including announcements to a bunch more of these. We're doing a ton of these next week.
00:22:39.806 - 00:23:08.290, Speaker A: We've got a bunch of different fun projects and data providers. We're trying to do more data providers so you can learn about the data providers that are getting on the Chainlink network and starting to provide data in some really interesting use cases. We just did one last week with Luxfi luxury goods data and all sorts of interesting new ones. So like and subscribe to this channel so we can make sure to keep growing YouTube content for you to be able to share with other people who are interested in the growing web three ecosystem. Hey, thanks for being with me. I'll see you guys next time. It's chain link live peace.
