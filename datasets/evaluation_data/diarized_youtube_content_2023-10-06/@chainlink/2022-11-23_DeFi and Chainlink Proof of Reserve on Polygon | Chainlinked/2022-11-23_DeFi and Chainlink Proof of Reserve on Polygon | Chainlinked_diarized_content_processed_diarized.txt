00:00:04.970 - 00:00:43.462, Speaker A: All right, gents, I think we can dive into today's episode. Super pumped to have you on this morning, and thanks for taking the time. And welcome, everyone, to the latest episode of Chainlink by Chainlink Labs. For those new to the show, this is a Twitter spaces series where you can learn all about the latest developments in Chainlink and the wider smart contract ecosystem. Today, we're diving into what's possible in the world of Defi and Polygon, alongside one of the innovators of the ecosystem and chainlink proof of reserve integrators, Cash gold. On stage. I'm joined by Francis Defi, business development at Polygon.
00:00:43.462 - 00:01:00.510, Speaker A: Brian, co founder of Cash Gold and Chainlink Labs very own proof of reserve go to market lead. Max, welcome to the show. Francis, Brian, and Max, I'm excited to have you both on the Twitter space. How's everyone doing? How's everyone feeling?
00:01:04.870 - 00:01:06.420, Speaker B: Excellent. Great to be here.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:09.140, Speaker C: Good. How are you guys doing?
00:01:10.870 - 00:01:27.030, Speaker A: Doing well. We'd love to start off this conversation with introductions for the listeners. Max, I think this is a good opportunity to start off with you. Could you give us a little bit of an overview about yourself and your role at Chainlink Labs?
00:01:28.250 - 00:01:47.738, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you, Bryce, and glad to be here. Guys. My name is Max Melcher. I'm the go to market lead for a solution called Proof of Reserve. It's something we at Chainlink Labs been working on for the last two years. I know a lot of people probably heard about it a lot more in the last two weeks, and what I do day to day is drive the direction of the solution.
00:01:47.738 - 00:02:01.970, Speaker B: So that involves working with token issuers who are looking to increase their transparency and security, working with Chainlink node operators to run these feeds. And finally, I get to work with the Defi protocols who are looking to secure their platforms by integrating these feeds.
00:02:04.470 - 00:02:30.960, Speaker A: Thanks, Max. Yes, vital role in today's world and excited to have you on the stage. And we'll dive into a little bit around proof of reserve a little bit later in today's episode. Francis, we'd now like to turn it over to you. We'd love to dive into your background as well. I'm curious, how did you get into the blockchain industry, and what led you to become the Defi BD lead at.
00:02:34.210 - 00:03:27.280, Speaker D: Thanks. Thanks for having me as a speaker. Yeah. So I'm from the Polygon Defi business development team, and at Polygon, we are always on the lookout for innovative and path breaking projects to launch on Polygon. In Polygon, we are currently seeing a lot of projects who are building on real world assets, bridging them on chain. And that's something which we are really bullish on Polygon we see that is where integrating with stable coins, getting feeds from real life, there is a big opportunity out there where projects can build and bring yields out there to people. And Chainlink is doing a very good job at integrating that.
00:03:27.280 - 00:04:05.340, Speaker D: I've been at Polygon for now around seven to eight months. I got into blockchain, of course. I think everyone gets in here through bitcoin. Yeah, that's how I got in here. But then, yeah, till 2020 on crypto, Twitter. That's pretty much how I got into blockchain and the entire defi space. And despite all what's know, I'm very optimistic, know what Defi brings and the opportunities which is there.
00:04:07.310 - 00:04:32.580, Speaker A: Thanks for that, Francis. Yes, I as well got into the space through bitcoin. I think it's a pretty common route. You did start to dive into a little bit about polygon as well. I'm sure we have a lot of folks in the audience who don't even know what polygon is, what it does for the ecosystem. Could you give us a high level overview of Polygon and the significance it has in the blockchain space?
00:04:35.210 - 00:05:34.150, Speaker D: Sure, yeah. But I do hope everyone kind of does know what Polygon does, because our number one objective is adoption at Polygon. So the thing which we all work relentlessly is towards getting more and more people involved in blockchain, even if they are not directly interacting with smart contracts. Now to give an overview of Polygon. Polygon's ethos is mainly aligned with the Ethereum communities decentralization, building smart contracts and polygons. The correct way to describe polygon is like an ethereum scaling solutions. So we have the POS chain, which is, I think it has more protocols.
00:05:34.150 - 00:06:13.922, Speaker D: After ethereum, it is probably the most vibrant ecosystem out there, both in DeFi and nfts. And currently the team has had major success, especially integration, creating with Reddit, nfts. Instagram's launching their nfts on Polygon. We got all major defi protocols and Polygon. Yeah, Polygon is. Polygon has lower transaction fees, and it's just a faster way to interact with all crypto protocols. Yeah.
00:06:13.922 - 00:06:17.670, Speaker D: So that's pretty much an overview of Polygon.
00:06:19.530 - 00:06:44.590, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, no, it's very impressive in terms of the amount of adoption you guys are seeing with real world. Like you mentioned with Reddit, that's extremely based. What do you view as the main unique aspect of polygon or the differentiator in the crypto space. Why do you think so many projects are jumping on board and using your solution?
00:06:47.890 - 00:07:56.502, Speaker D: I think the major reason for us adoption is actually the north star. Whenever we work backwards from that and we see that, what are the unique use cases which already exist out there where the blockchain things make a lot of sense. So that's how digital collectibles now has become the important way in which people interact. And if you would go back six to seven months, we also lived in a world where there was extremely high gas fees, fifty dollars to seventy dollars to interact for a swap. So I think this is the first way in which users get to interact with the multiple protocols without spending a lot of money. And even for developers, what we see, right, developers can actually test in production with Polygon. It's the same code, they can deploy it.
00:07:56.502 - 00:08:29.646, Speaker D: And every developer is now using Polygon as a GTM. Like go to market with polygon, easy to get user feedback. And there's very strong stablecoin liquidity on polygon, which enables off ramp, on ramp and interaction with multiple. So we also say, I'm from the BD team, and we say that the BD here stands for builder development. So that's typically our focus. So that all innovative, it's permissionless building. Anyone who is building, we all want them to build on Polygon first.
00:08:29.646 - 00:08:31.600, Speaker D: That's pretty much what drives us.
00:08:33.270 - 00:08:41.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious too. Do you guys see a lot of developers start with nfts and then gravitate towards defi?
00:08:44.630 - 00:09:31.780, Speaker D: Okay, so sure. What we see currently is that, for example, the young innovative teams, especially coming from hackathons, they are building on NFT projects. Polygon ID NFT finance, that's what I have seen. The younger, you know, the experienced teams with a background in traditional finance and asset securitization and tokenization, they are building the real world asset classes and bringing them on chain. So we see both. But if I were to see two distinct developer classes, might be anecdotal, but yeah, that's one pattern. If I were to see currently.
00:09:34.630 - 00:09:54.250, Speaker A: Oh, cool. That makes a lot of sense. I'm also curious. So you talked about how polygon is booming for nfts within the defi space. What do you think are some of the key differentiators in terms of supporting the growth of this marketplace with polygon?
00:09:56.350 - 00:09:59.180, Speaker D: Yeah. So you know, you know.
00:10:07.360 - 00:10:07.964, Speaker A: Still there.
00:10:08.002 - 00:10:44.648, Speaker D: Francis, if we see on polygon, we all have tier one protocols. For example, uniswap v three is very successful. On Polygon Ave and multiple other home native protocols. Polymarket for prediction markets. Quickswap is another Dexs V and options protocols, polysynth and simcode. So the entire suite of defi and gains, all protocols are available on polygon. And we have a vibrant defi community out there.
00:10:44.648 - 00:11:27.328, Speaker D: And what I would say that distinguishes polygon is that the sheer variety of projects. So if you would see our projects, the PVL, if you were to use as a measure, it is not concentrated on one or two projects. It is spread out on multiple projects. And we are always on the lookout for more options yield. Dex aggregators, Defi farming, all protocols is there on polygon. It's as a vibrant ecosystem itself. And to give an example, for example, the Uniswap V, three products which are built on top of the asset management.
00:11:27.328 - 00:11:46.110, Speaker D: It's very strong on Polygon, I think large variety of projects and distributed across. So that's what's happening in Polygon, Defi. And we are seeing more and more projects coming on Polygon as well.
00:11:49.040 - 00:12:16.950, Speaker A: Okay, so you guys are seeing a lot of diversity within the ecosystem. I'm also interested in your future roadmap and growth plans for Defi. Are there specific use cases that you guys are focused on right now? And I'm also curious, what are you personally most excited about that will be enabled by technology that you guys are working on?
00:12:19.320 - 00:13:18.328, Speaker D: Yeah, to be honest, me personally as well. Bullish on the real world assets, bringing them on chain. Recently we published an 80 page research document on real world assets. I think bringing on chain assets, off chain assets on chain is something which we are focused because that's sticky and brings more diversification and hopefully less correlated with the entire DeFi space. So that's what we are working on. I do think that every country out there can build a DeFi protocol which is concentrated on real world assets. So that's something which we are working actively at Polygon Defi and getting more and more projects on board.
00:13:18.328 - 00:13:31.740, Speaker D: That one. So, for example, teller is like a strong marketplace for RW assets, to give an example. And there are a lot of projects who are know in that direction all building on polygon.
00:13:34.000 - 00:13:55.030, Speaker A: Amazing. I look forward to seeing the new innovation that you guys are launching in the coming months. And in 2023, Max would love to kick it over to you as well. When talking about Polygon, how have you seen the integration between Chainlink and Polygon evolve? Kind of over?
00:13:58.680 - 00:14:40.740, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I think people may forget, but Polygon was Chainlink's first native integration after so you know, it's a massive step going from zero to one. Everyone talks about that, but I think it's also quite large going from one to two. And having worked with the Polygon team, I can confidently say it's difficult to find a better team to grow with and scale with than the Polygon team. The expertise, talent, support, it's all first know. Francis mentioned adoption. It's clear developers feel this way too. And as a result, Polygon has been one of the first chains that Chainlink integrates new solutions like automation, VRF on and yeah, now we're seeing the expansion in proof of reserve on Polygon.
00:14:43.800 - 00:15:01.960, Speaker A: That's amazing. And Francis, from your perspective, kind of looking at your product, roadmap and growth plans, what is the role of an oracle such as Chainlink in achieving them? And from your point of view, how does ChainLink help developers build on Polygon?
00:15:06.800 - 00:17:05.200, Speaker D: Yes, I think we are currently in the midst of a really important something, which we all knew before, but it's currently come into forefront, which is basically the ethos that don't trust but verify, I think, which is one of the first principles of crypto now being bought into the forefront. And Vitalik himself wrote an article, I think, a couple of days, about how proof of reserves is really important. So I think Chainlink plays a very important role, especially in bringing the information which is disparate, and then so that protocols can build on top of that. And especially I mentioned, we are in this discussion about cash, the protocol of how Chainlink is bringing that trust, especially for off chain, it's not very easy, right? Because off chain exists in a very different legal and very legal reality. And to bring that on chain to be trusted by participants and protocols, Chainlink is who is doing that. So that the integration between the offline and the online world. So I see that all real world assets, especially which require information aggregation from multiple sources, would be using Chainlink as their number one preferred oracle.
00:17:05.200 - 00:17:17.540, Speaker D: That way, anything which has to go to one cross protocol, cross chain, and also on chain to off chain chain links become very critical.
00:17:20.040 - 00:17:45.260, Speaker A: Thanks for the kind words, Francis. We appreciate you and just Polygon as a whole, as a team. And you mentioned proof of reserve, and I think that that's a great transition over to Brian. As a reminder, Brian is the co founder of Cash Gold and we'd love to hear more about Brian. Could you give us an overview of cash gold and why you decided to build on polygon?
00:17:47.540 - 00:18:36.292, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So we are a gold backed token and we strive to be the most transparent gold token with the best proof of reserve out there. We built that on a technology we developed called Gram chain, which collects the data in real time about the bars directly from the vaults. And for the on chain portion of it, we use Chainlink. We chose to build on Chainlink because they're just clearly the market leader in oracles and putting real world data on chain. They have an unparalleled reputation with that, and it's just the clear choice. Likewise, I think Francis covered most of the reasons we chose to build on polygon.
00:18:36.292 - 00:19:10.680, Speaker C: It has great adoption, it's EVM compatible, so it was easy to port our technology over. And also it has a permissionless bridge, which is important because of the nature of our token. We have fees to cover the custody costs of the gold, and it's not fully ERC 20 standard. Well, it is, but it has some non standard features around the fees, so we had to be able to build our own bridge and polygon allowed.
00:19:13.980 - 00:19:26.060, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks. Thanks for that, Brian and Max, I mean, from your perspective, what has it been like working with the cash gold team to integrate proof of reserve?
00:19:27.380 - 00:20:06.228, Speaker B: Yeah, they're an incredible team. Brian, he's here. Diaz, we've had the opportunity to work with a lot of their team members through this integration. One of the important components for any proof of reserve chainlink proof reserve integration we do is utility. And one of the things about cache is before we even spoken to them, they had the secure minting functionality in place and ready for an oracle. And when I say secure minting, maybe I should explain that, but it's the on chain functionality that requires in any mint or increase in total supply that that new total supply is less than or equal to their reserves. So that security Check can be done on chain transparently.
00:20:06.228 - 00:20:37.940, Speaker B: So it's clear that the steam was already thinking about this actual security. And technology wise, they're also very impressive, I think, talking a lot about tokenizing real world assets. In my mind, this is done on a scale of trust minimization. Their data partner, gram chain they use is able to deliver this data in a high quality, attesting to their reserves. Every bar is scanned, weighed, photographed and available in their online explorer. And I think they are really on the leading edge of transparency when it comes to asset issuance.
00:20:40.600 - 00:20:59.660, Speaker A: Wow, that's kind of crazy, being able to scan all the bars, photograph everything. Brian, I'm curious, from your perspective, what was it like to get this whole thing set up? What was going on behind the scenes? If you could give us some inside scoop.
00:21:01.280 - 00:21:43.636, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Well, I really have to give all the credit to the other founder of cash, Gregor. He's the one that brings all the knowledge and experience from the precious metals and vaulting industry. He actually built his own vault and his own vault management system, I guess, about eight years ago. And they really built their entire business and their vault around transparency. And so he was able to lend the knowledge and expertise to really just kind of port over what they're already doing to blockchain technology. And that's what we worked on first.
00:21:43.636 - 00:21:53.070, Speaker C: Instead of just trying to create a gold token, we had to build a way to track it transparently first and then put the token on top of that.
00:21:57.280 - 00:22:23.450, Speaker A: Yeah, no, 100%. And I mean, Brian, from your perspective, a lot of people say bitcoin is digital gold, and your team is literally bringing gold on chain. Do you have any plans to do this with any other assets, or just even hypothetically, where do you see the possibility of proof of reserve and kind of the base foundation that you guys have built expanding into the future?
00:22:25.100 - 00:23:07.780, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. We built it to really work for any type of asset. It's just kind of that. Gold is the most obvious one to start with, but we are already working on porting the technology over to work with non fungible assets so that we could tokenize things like art or watches or really anything you can imagine. And of course, it would work for other precious metals, for silver, platinum, and potentially other commodities. It really works with very little modification for anything that you can put in a vault or secure warehouse.
00:23:10.120 - 00:23:18.010, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So if someone had a watch collection, you would scan each one, take pictures, and then put it on chain, something like that?
00:23:18.540 - 00:23:32.350, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And then, of course from there you could do things like fractionalize the NFT and sell shares. If it's a very valuable piece of artwork or very valuable watch.
00:23:35.520 - 00:23:50.580, Speaker A: That'S extremely based. I'm curious, can other people approach you guys and you help them build out these solutions, or is it something that you guys are doing only in house, like kind of keeping these projects internally?
00:23:51.960 - 00:24:19.660, Speaker C: No, absolutely. We have decided earlier this year that we're going to make our technology available as a white label service to anybody else that wants to tokenize anything. Really? Kind of like chainlink provides infrastructure for blockchain projects. We want to provide infrastructure for anybody that wants to tokenize any type of real world asset.
00:24:22.320 - 00:24:36.050, Speaker A: That's awesome. You've covered a lot of stuff that you guys are working on in the future, but maybe for the listeners, what can they expect at a cash gold and say, like the next twelve months. Is there something that they should be looking out for?
00:24:37.300 - 00:25:21.756, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we should be able to get the NFTs live in 2023, hopefully toward the first half. That's kind of tied together with a new vault that Gregor is working on. He's building what is probably the largest vault in the world, or maybe close to it. It's 180,000. It's going to have a lot of specialty vaulting space for artwork, watches and other types of alternative assets. It's going to have office and event spaces. It's a bonded facility, so you can store things in there tax free as long as you don't remove it from the vault.
00:25:21.756 - 00:25:30.310, Speaker C: And it's going to have facilities for auctions, all kinds of stuff. So we hope to launch those two things together in 2023.
00:25:32.440 - 00:25:42.230, Speaker A: Wow, that's massive. Congrats to the team. I really look forward to seeing pictures or video, if there's anything available like that in the future.
00:25:43.000 - 00:26:02.190, Speaker C: Yeah, if you go to therereserve SG, you can see some videos and renderings of what the project is going to look like when it's complete. It's under construction right now, so if you go to the reserve SG, you can see all the details on it.
00:26:04.480 - 00:26:36.250, Speaker A: Definitely. I'll check it out for everyone. That's reserve SG, and we'd love to transition the conversation more to like a panel style for all three of you guys on stage. I have a few kind of general questions. As the web three industry continues to gain adoption. I'm curious how everyone here kind of envisions the role of DFI and secure Oracles evolving over time. Francis, would love to start with you.
00:26:36.250 - 00:26:43.690, Speaker A: What's your vision for how DeFi and Oracles will expand in the coming years or.
00:26:48.830 - 00:27:38.982, Speaker D: Sure. So what I see is that, for example, how cash gold has bought in gold, the representation of a physical thing on chain. Right. There is a lot of things which are going to be built on top of that. There is going to be people who are going to borrow against this and then distribute that thing to different applications. So the composable nature of DeFi, right. It enables so many permutations and combinations which we haven't imagined.
00:27:38.982 - 00:28:41.582, Speaker D: So the more amount of assets which we bring on chain, we're going to see lot of more use cases come here. Right? So, for example, even in Makerdao, and we have seen Dai me minted against real world assets. So as we go forward, what I would typically would like to see is that more dows, et cetera, adopt real world assets into their treasury and then build on top of that. So that's something which I think is possible with assets coming on chain. Right. Dows holding physical assets, they deploying their yield from DeFi into the real world. For example, financing renewable assets, renewable energy.
00:28:41.582 - 00:29:05.700, Speaker D: So all that kind of, to be honest, these are the kind of projects who are building on polygon also like building out of renewable energy sources in emerging markets, financing of trade, et cetera. So I think it's a great in that direction. And we will see more work coming from Polygon and multiple other projects who are building that way.
00:29:08.390 - 00:29:18.166, Speaker A: Yeah. Dows holding physical assets could be huge. Max, I see you unmuted your mic. Did you want to say mean?
00:29:18.188 - 00:30:21.450, Speaker B: I think, I think Francis is know I didn't say this, but I think it's true that without real world assets, DeFi will largely continue to be a circular economy. So I think there's benefits. On top of these real world assets being tokenized, you have fractionalization, programmability, extensibility, which is what we see with cash gold, minting on Ethereum, and bridging to new networks entirely like Polygon. But I think I'll go back to security, and what I think is a focus for us is that this term, proof of reserve, can be just proof, but it can actually be much more than that. So our focus has largely been security with that proof. So if we're providing this data on chain, this decentralized fashion, what security can be enabled on top of it? And almost every real world asset carries some trust. But how can we reduce that trust? What programmatic security mechanisms can we put in place? Circuit breakers, mint lock, to enable security that the users don't even have to see, but they're protected with? And I think it can do more than just provide confidence to the ecosystem.
00:30:21.450 - 00:30:56.550, Speaker B: And so I think we'll see more and more protocols as these real world assets come on chain create these feeds and these trust minimization tools, not just for themselves, but for the other protocols that choose to accept those. You know, Francis was mentioning all the DeFi protocols on Polygon. They will likely be engaged in taking in cash gold as a deposit asset. They can protect themselves and their users by leveraging these security tools, these feeds, to ensure appropriate collateralization at all time. I think that's the real strength and value of secure oracles evolving over time with these real world assets.
00:31:00.110 - 00:31:12.160, Speaker A: Yeah. And Brian, from your perspective, it seems that everyone is pretty pro bringing real world assets on chain. I imagine that you're thinking that that's the future as well.
00:31:14.050 - 00:31:28.660, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly. I mean, that's why we built the company. And I think that I don't really have much to add to what Max and Francis already said. I think they're absolutely right on that.
00:31:31.830 - 00:31:46.786, Speaker A: Right on. And before we close out the space, I did have one final question for this group in general. What steps do you think we need to take to continue to improve and build the web three industry?
00:31:46.978 - 00:31:47.382, Speaker D: Maybe.
00:31:47.436 - 00:31:49.580, Speaker A: Francis, we can start with you.
00:31:55.890 - 00:32:56.114, Speaker D: Yeah, I think on Defi, especially people who are working on. I think it's important for people to first go through the one, have the idea of self custody. I think it's already been discussed. That's one. And also to first, before going fully convinced on a project, probably sit over it, try it once. Then I personally use this, try to understand why this protocol works. What do you like it instead of Twitter? It's a place of big Fomo and it drives you quickly into narratives and also not think from the principle of that.
00:32:56.114 - 00:33:43.726, Speaker D: How to get rich fast, but maybe like how to get rich slow, maybe right. And first of all, let's all understand why we are here. We here one, in a way to bring financial freedom and the digital asset property rights to most of the people. I think that's the major, probably the ethical reason why we should all be in that space. I think we should all once in a while check ourselves on that fact. I think that's the one. And then also to try also to figure out that in this crypto, Twitter runs really fast.
00:33:43.726 - 00:34:27.120, Speaker D: Who are the people who are putting out a genuine point of view versus trying to quickly jump on a narrative and carry a lot of people and see who is engagement farming. So I think this is a great time in which to be equally engaged, but not to act really fast. Right. I think taking it slow and being more thoughtful is probably. I think it was a surprise question. Probably I rambled, but. Yeah, but that's basically my view on this.
00:34:29.810 - 00:34:48.790, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think taking it slow, having a focused approach is definitely the way to go. And Brian, what's your perspective on that? How can web three continue to prove and build as an industry?
00:34:49.850 - 00:35:38.310, Speaker C: Well, I think the topic of the discussion is the answer, proof of reserve. It applies not only to real world physical assets, it also applies to all these digital assets. This is the purpose of blockchain, for things to be transparent, public, trustless in real time. So I think that it needs to become a universal standard across the industry. There are some exchanges that are real leaders in that, for assets that are not necessarily real world like Kraken and Bitmex have pretty good technology in terms of their proof of reserve, and I think that really needs to become a universal standard across the industry.
00:35:42.410 - 00:36:27.906, Speaker B: I'll just chime in on that. I think Francis made a great point. Understanding how the protocols you're using work, that's one thing, but I'll also add on top of that is understanding how the assets you use work. So these real world assets that we're seeing on chain these wrapped assets from another chain, understanding how they operate, what their security principles are, what additional tools are available to ensure their security. We have real world assets where the reserves are only attested once a month. And this is in a space where I think the polygon block time is somewhere around like 2 seconds, somewhere around there. So I think we can do much better from a security standpoint on the asset side, but it really comes from users getting more educated on the assets they're using and demanding the same transparency across the board.
00:36:27.906 - 00:36:46.570, Speaker B: I said this before, but the way to get the next 100 million users to crypto isn't some new flashy feature. It's creating secure systems that prevent people from losing money. And so I'm optimistic that what we can do to improve and build web three industry is really enabling those secure systems.
00:36:50.160 - 00:37:22.490, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely seems like we are all on the same page that proof of reserve is needed to propel web three to the next level and just appreciate all of you guys taking the time to come out and speak with us and educate the audience around proof of reserve, around Polygon, around DFI. We'll start with Francis. Francis, where can people find you online? Where can people follow Polygon? I see the Polygon main account is in the Twitter space. I see the polygon defi account is on stage. Those are great places to start as.
00:37:26.780 - 00:37:59.620, Speaker D: The best. My dms are always open, so any team which is building out on polygon, just dm me. I'll try my best to give the fastest response. So, Polygon. Yes. The main channel has gone really popular, so that's why we started a subset for the Polygon DFi. Polygon DFi is specifically focused for people who are keen on DFI side of web three crypto.
00:37:59.620 - 00:38:18.360, Speaker D: And every week we have, in collaboration with block bytes, we have a summary which is like a short video on what's happening. That's pretty much the best way to keep in track with what's happening at Polygon.
00:38:20.460 - 00:38:38.290, Speaker A: Right on. For everyone that's block bytes, definitely check it out. It's pretty based and cash gold. Brian where can people follow you as well? Obviously you're up here with the main account. It's probably a great place to start. Is there any other places people should be paying attention to?
00:38:38.740 - 00:39:10.330, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Our website is cash gold, and we have a LinkedIn page you can find too, but we pretty much post everything relevant to Twitter. And again, the website for the vault is the reserve SG. I just got a couple messages that people can't open. Reserve SG. It's the reserve. So if people want to check that out and see what we're building, you can see it there.
00:39:12.540 - 00:39:13.000, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:39:13.070 - 00:39:25.310, Speaker A: And again, that's the reserve SG. And Max, we'd love to end it with you. Where can people learn more about proof of reserve and maybe follow your own personal journey here at?
00:39:28.000 - 00:39:52.360, Speaker B: I mean, I tend not to spend that much time on social media if I can help it. So if you're a token issuer protocol that accepts wrapped assets, we'd love to hear from you. We've had a number of incredible discussions over the last few weeks, and some very promising things are moving forward. But the best way to get in contact with us is through the official chainlink channels, and that's going to be chain link slash proofreserve.
00:39:54.700 - 00:39:55.304, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:39:55.422 - 00:40:09.130, Speaker A: And thank you guys so much again for coming on stage and for taking the time out. Appreciate it and hope you guys have a rest of your day, afternoon or evening, wherever you're at. We'll see you guys next time.
00:40:12.900 - 00:40:17.930, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. It was great being here and it's really nice questions? Yeah.
00:40:20.540 - 00:40:25.110, Speaker A: Appreciate that, Francis. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Max. See you guys.
