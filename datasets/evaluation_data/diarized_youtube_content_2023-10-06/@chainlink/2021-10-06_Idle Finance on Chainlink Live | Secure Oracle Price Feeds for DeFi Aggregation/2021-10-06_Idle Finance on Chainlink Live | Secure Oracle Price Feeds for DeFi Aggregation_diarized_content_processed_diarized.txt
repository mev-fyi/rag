00:00:00.090 - 00:00:16.014, Speaker A: We got a little GM from Kevin going on. GM, GM, Mateo, everyone. GM to everyone. And Mateo, what have you noticed in Defi lately? Anything that's really caught your eye, just industry wide that's interesting to you or.
00:00:16.052 - 00:01:15.386, Speaker B: Trends or anything like in the industry right now? There are different trends in my opinion. Of course, Defi has been the trend in the last year and a half and a lot of Bim building and different protocols popped out. A lot of different protocols. And the ecosystem entirely is growing a lot more like closer to the current present. Well, we have the NFT space, which is honestly my opinion is really fascinating to follow because it's venue to allow a lot of different segments to onboard in the crypto space because creators, writers, game designers can join the space now with nfts. And in the future, I really see more and more connection between DeFi and NFTs. Another trend, honestly that I'm really following closely.
00:01:15.386 - 00:01:55.170, Speaker B: Of course, I'm a little bit biased because I'm working on that, but the Dao trend is really important for the future in my opinion, also because if you see DeFi and nfTs, you can see Daos including them both. Dows can be used for nfts can be used for Defi applications. Now DAos are getting even more and more specialized. We have investment dows, we have protocol dows. So honestly, in terms of trends for the future, I really see dows being one of the central components of these kind of cycles.
00:01:55.750 - 00:02:12.738, Speaker A: Here's my hot take. Nfts are the killer use case for. So nfts kind of bring these dows together and make them happen. And then you've got a dow that needs to do something with its treasury and with its membership. There's Defi.
00:02:12.914 - 00:02:13.542, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:02:13.676 - 00:02:35.210, Speaker A: It's like the infrastructure for Daos. Like we're going to do something and then there was nothing to do except for vote on what we were going to do years ago. And now there's nfts so you can collect, so there's that common culture, and then there's Defi. So you can actually make those assets, productive assets in Defi. And those are really important decisions to make. Once you have those two. I am, you and me are mind.
00:02:35.360 - 00:02:53.006, Speaker B: It's so like coming together really in a good way with Defi first in order to create the financial layer, nfts to create another layer for onboarding new sectors, new industries, and then daos to wrap everything up. That's really fascinating.
00:02:53.118 - 00:03:13.462, Speaker A: We got to start the show. I got to find out how idle plays into all this, it's Chainlink live. Stick around. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here talking to Mateo from Idle Finance. We've been talking about nfts, daos, Defi and how they're interconnected.
00:03:13.462 - 00:03:25.150, Speaker A: But let's start with idle finance and just learn a little bit more about it. We'll tie back into all those topics I feel like, because I love rapping about this stuff as well. So Mateo, give us a little introduction. What is idle all about? What makes it special?
00:03:25.300 - 00:04:20.874, Speaker B: Absolutely. So idle is a Defi yield aggregator that interface with several of the larger lending platforms currently on the Ethereum blockchain, but small alpha leak. We are going to other blockchains right now, like Polygon for example. But Idle protocol itself goes behind the rebalancing user funds. To simplify and improve their Defi experience and savings, Idle offers a product suite designed with yield aggregation and automation in mind. It's basically a yield network that is compositional, permissional and extensible. What basically you can find in our product suite is optimized yield and lending interest rate yield farming for idle comp staked up and all the other governance tokens that will be available through our allocation strategies.
00:04:20.874 - 00:05:39.378, Speaker B: A risk management suite as well that started with the risk adjusted allocation strategy that we developed a couple of years ago and will be taken even further by the perpetual yield trenches that I would be happy to tell you more about later. A built in insurance service as well is within our product suite because we have been partnering up with Nexusmoto and also talking with other insurance services for a cover deal strategy, which is basically an insurance service where the user will be covered for the entire risk stack and dependencies automatically without any manual action to go by the insurance that will be within the entire allocation strategy. As I was saying, the trenches is one of the new products that we added in the suite. Basically, the trenches have two components, the senior and the junior trenches. Senior trenches have a deposit production and the unit trenches instead have a leverage deal. Lastly, something that is really important in this suite that we are creating is also the ownership experience that we want to give to our users and token holders because there is a component that is made by the protocol and the strategies. Another one is the DAO and governance component.
00:05:39.378 - 00:06:02.270, Speaker B: So with different modules like the staking module, with all the and also the other use cases that we're giving to the idle token itself and also with the league structure. Another point that I would like to tell you more later with the league structure. We are building out this suite of ownership experience for our users and idle token holders.
00:06:03.090 - 00:06:35.530, Speaker A: So I like the branding, right? This idea of a yield aggregator that's idle where the user can be idle. Can you talk a little bit about that? There's idle games, a very popular genre on mobile where you play the game but you don't do that much, right? You do basic input and then a lot of things happen and you kind of level up and do that sort of thing. What's the thinking? Is there a parallel there between that sort of activity and your product suite?
00:06:35.950 - 00:07:10.578, Speaker B: That's exactly the parallel. Idle games are games where the user don't have to do a lot of things. There is only an input at the beginning and then different checkpoints across the game. That's the same concept that we wanted to apply to our project suite. So our users, our token holders can just be idle and the protocol itself will manage the yield aggregation and automation on their behalf. So yeah, that's the thinking behind. Also it's a parallel within computer science and finance because we are targeting as a protocol idle funds.
00:07:10.578 - 00:07:35.654, Speaker B: Idle funds are funds that are not being used and not invested. So that's exactly the category of funds that should be deposited into the protocol. And it's coming also from computer science where like idle variables are variables that are not used. So in general, our users can stay idle and the idle funds that they have are the perfect funds that should be deposited into the protocol.
00:07:35.782 - 00:08:04.706, Speaker A: So I can see like super clear value proposition. If your funds are idle, if you're not doing anything with them, you can earn on them and you don't have to do a lot. That's a pretty core value proposition for a lot of deFi, a lot of yield aggregation or yield generating stuff. But what about those active users? Is there a benefit for a yield aggregator where I do less as compared to, I find the farms myself and I move funds from one place to another and find that. What are some of the differentiators there for idle?
00:08:04.818 - 00:08:58.490, Speaker B: Absolutely. So let's start with capital efficiency. So the capital within an idle allocation strategy for a given asset can be allocated into chunks across several protocols simultaneously to either maximize the return or minimize the risk exposure. For our depositors. However, simply looking at the interest rate prior to a rebalance often result in an inefficient allocation, basically as it fails to account for the impact of the reallocated capital. So these, if you're like a protocol or even a single user, and you're trying to manually moving all the funds from one protocol to another. In order to maximize your interest rate return, you might cause a so called.
00:08:58.490 - 00:09:33.890, Speaker B: We call that the ping pong effect. This ping pong effect is basically an infinite loop of rebalance. Without finding an optimal point of yield. Due to the fact that the interest rate influence that you are causing to the interest rate by the protocol rebalance. Or the user rebalance is not countered in. So that's really something that is heavy for a single user to compute, understand, what's the exact allocation that he needs to do on a certain protocol. And also time consuming and gas consuming.
00:09:36.070 - 00:10:00.826, Speaker A: So if I'm looking at a yield protocol, I can do some yield farming. And it says it's 10%. When I deposit in there, there's a chunk of funds that make that 10% reality. And so if you deposit in there, it changes from 10% APY. Now you're using up a portion of that funds and it drops it to 9.88% or whatever it happens to be that your allocation impacts that reduction. Right.
00:10:00.826 - 00:10:15.938, Speaker A: Because in yield farming there's a limited pool of funds that are going out and being distributed as rewards. And so this ping pong effect is like, oh well, if I switch from a 9% one to a 10% one, and then it drops it to a 9% one, and then I go back, you're just spending gas and doing nothing.
00:10:16.104 - 00:10:16.530, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:16.600 - 00:10:23.186, Speaker A: Okay, I get it. I've not heard of that. Explain. So. But yes, I'm sure I felt that in the past.
00:10:23.288 - 00:11:02.410, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. That's why one of the differentiator for idle finance is that we developed, we discovered this issue especially for yield aggregators that don't take account of this kind of ping pong effect. So we wanted to solve that. And we developed a dynamic rebalance mechanism. Which allowed to granularly split funds across protocols. To achieve the best aggregated interest rate, taking account the influence that the rebalanced capital has on the different rates. So we are computing the interest, the influence of this capital that is going on a specific yield.
00:11:02.410 - 00:11:39.180, Speaker B: So the interesting central idea is to allocate capital among multiple lending protocols. In whatever ratios result in the highest net interest rate. So as you were saying, imagine that you have deposited a significant amount of die into compound. You're happy with that, you're happy with the lending rate. And you go on with your daily defi life. But when you come back after a while, you discover that a lot of the capital has followed the compound interest rate dynamics. Dragging down your returns to the point where you'd better off using ave instead.
00:11:39.180 - 00:12:31.180, Speaker B: So you decide to move your capital. After you do so, though, you check the rates again, only to find out that Ave's return has decreased and compound has increased to the point where compound is once again the better place for your funds. The manual solution here would be to only move some funds to Ave some funds to compound in such a way as the average return of the returns from the two wire. Basically you are mediating your returns and that's exactly where the best deal strategy comes in. You don't have to mediate your returns across all protocols and you don't have to spend plenty of time on rebalancing funds gas fees in order to push you the best interest rate.
00:12:33.230 - 00:12:37.046, Speaker A: It's like APY arbitrage.
00:12:37.158 - 00:13:06.546, Speaker B: Almost correct, exactly. So either if you have your tokens in a cold storage, or even if you're like a builder that is building a new amazing yield generating savings account, and you want to focus only on the user experience, on the UI for your customers. If you use idle, you don't have to play around with moving your files basically, and you can just keep in them where they're stored and the protocol itself will take care of the optimization of the rates.
00:13:06.658 - 00:13:25.002, Speaker A: Interesting. So you talked about a couple of other products, some perpetual products as well. Are these all baked into one aggregator or if I go in as somebody with a treasury, my own treasury or whatever it is, I select different products. Sorry, I'm hitting stuff. I select different products. Or how does that work? I'm just curious.
00:13:25.146 - 00:14:14.074, Speaker B: So right now we have the best yield allocation strategy with different assets. So you can choose a specific asset deposit and then your deposit will be splitted across compound avid ydx in order to optimize the yield. That's the base layer of optimization and aggregation. Now with the perpetual yield trenches, it's an on top strategy. Right now it's on top, it's built on top of the best yield strategy. What the tranches do is basically to split the yield and the risk on different products. In this way, whether you are a deed that is fine with the risk of the underlying protocols, or you are new to Defi, you want to try the yields, but you're a little bit scared about the consequences.
00:14:14.074 - 00:14:36.870, Speaker B: You can find a product that is fitable for you. The senior trenches have an intrinsic lower yield, but they have a protection in case of any loss of funds or acts. And on the other side, the union trenches takes these kind of risk, but for an additional and increased yield.
00:14:37.850 - 00:14:46.230, Speaker A: Cool. Of course, you guys integrated Chainlink recently as well that's why we're here talking, hanging out. How does Chainlink come to play for idle?
00:14:46.570 - 00:16:04.430, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now we are leveraging the chainlink infrastructure to manage and take account of the yield distribution across our allocation strategies and also for more like governance purposes, like liquidity mining or staking. This of course helps us maintaining a reliable distribution of yield across all the strategies and governance components, making the idle protocol more resilient. Something that we want to unlock now with this partnership with Chainlink is this is the first layer of collaboration, let's say, because we are using the chainlink feeds to make the protocol more resilient. Now with the also listing of idle token in Chainlink would be really great because we would basically unlock different use cases for the token, like lending, like using it as a collateral in different lending protocols. So I think that we are still at the beginning with the awesome collaboration with Chainlink. We are definitely happy, we love the team, we really like you guys and your professionalism and also all the help that you're providing to the space itself. But yeah, I see a future collaborations and I'm really excited to see that.
00:16:04.500 - 00:16:36.234, Speaker A: I mean, the price feeds are no brainer when it comes to Defi. If you need a price for something, go get the market prices through Chainlink. It just makes sense. It's more secure, it's decentralized. But then when I think about yield aggregators, there's all of this harvesting and rebalancing and maintenance stuff. So Chainlink keepers is another product that just comes to mind for me as I understand that decentralize your maintenance tasks and become more of an independent protocol responsible to your dow instead of your users too. So hopefully that's something in the future as well.
00:16:36.234 - 00:17:03.554, Speaker A: I won't make you commit to that or timelines or anything, but when it comes to yield aggregators, it just makes a lot of sense to do that sort of stuff. Well, that's exciting. You mentioned also the DAO and governance. Can you talk a little bit about that? What are you governing? What is your dao doing? Is there like this other component to idle where people can kind of bring their own strategies and things like that? Or how does idle work?
00:17:03.752 - 00:18:18.726, Speaker B: So yeah, the DAO is really other great area of what we're building with idle because basically when we released the DAO, we started with a simple thesis that most of the token holders will tend to be passive in terms of contribution. But that's totally fine for us. That's not a problem for us. That's exactly what we could expect. So what we wanted to implement at the beginning with the DAO is an organizational structure for the DAO to allow active community members that wants to contribute on a daily basis to the protocol to self organize themselves and have a budget, have a work on mandates, and basically work for the protocol itself and for the DAO. Of course, the goal for the DAO is to make the protocol sustainable, improve it, enlarge the product suite, improve the product suite, and in general make it sustainable for the long term. In order to introduce and to give something to the community to self organize, we introduced the concept of leagues.
00:18:18.726 - 00:19:04.650, Speaker B: Basically, leagues are organizational units that are organized, that group people together on the same area of expertise. But those leagues works all for the same goal, which is making the protocol sustainable. We started out with a pilot league to set up everything, and it's been a great success because we saw a lot of community members stooding out and proposing themselves to work into this initial pilot league group. And now actually, we are at the third mandate with three different leagues, communication league, treasure league, and developer league, and with 15 people now that are working on a daily basis on the protocol. And Dow.
00:19:05.310 - 00:19:06.730, Speaker A: How big is a league?
00:19:07.070 - 00:19:24.126, Speaker B: A league? It depends. Because it depends. Like, for example, the treasury League right now has eight members. The developer league has three members. The communication leagues have three members as well. So there is no real like.
00:19:24.228 - 00:20:07.674, Speaker A: So the Dow is anybody with a token stake, whether it's active or passive, whether or not they're actively developing and contributing, or somebody who has a 10th of a token in their wallet, whatever that happens to be. It's absolutely anybody in the Dow. But then there's these leagues which actually kind of do the work of the Dow. And those are smaller units but flexible in size, depending on the needs of the product or whatever that is. And you can just spin up leagues whenever you have a need for something, like an apartment or an initiative. Like if there was a one off thing, you could be like, okay, we're just doing a league for this. Do you call it La Liga? Are you football fans over there? I know you're european, so that's why I hear leagues.
00:20:07.722 - 00:21:04.286, Speaker B: And I start thinking of, I like the name of leagues and having this group of people leagues, this kind of vibe of something challenging, something that, because they work on a mandate. So you have a league that work on an entire mandate. You have different goals, you do have different challenges, you have different initiatives. So leagues made a lot of sense that time on the token holder side. You can think about them as a sort of board of directors or board of Dow directors in this case, because every three months, basically the token holders are called to action, basically to elect new teams, new leagues. So there is still a role for the token holders, but they can be passive. They can stay idle within an entire year.
00:21:04.286 - 00:21:16.260, Speaker B: And they just have to be like the board of director of this Dow and just giving their votes, giving their preference regarding different teams that are working on the daily maintenance and growth of the project.
00:21:16.710 - 00:21:39.798, Speaker A: I know a lot of people thinking about dows and doing research on dows. I come from communication background where there's a lot of research on small groups and how they work together. And there's this really interesting dynamic of a small group. You get five to ten people. Ten is even large, but you get five, six, seven people. And you can make a lot happen with this area of expertise. And as soon as you blow that up to 30 people, it gets harder.
00:21:39.798 - 00:22:11.510, Speaker A: So what do you do when you get 3300, 3000, et cetera? There's these scaling challenges as well when it comes to making a decision. And dow, if it's supposed to be a decentralized decision, but all of a sudden it gets really difficult. That's the thing that a lot of people are dealing with right now. You got people who drop out and don't participate. You got people who say they're going to participate and then they don't. You got people who are doing twelve jobs at once and actively contributing, but doing too much, probably. These are some really interesting challenges that are happening right now in front of us.
00:22:11.580 - 00:22:53.534, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of still challenges that needs to be solved within the Dow space, like coordination of people. That's something that we are trying to solve with the leagues, but still there is a lot of improvements that can be done on the task management for the leagues. Also the leadership structure within a specific league. There is a lot of inspiration that you can take from other models. Something that comes to my mind now, for example, is I don't know if you ever heard about this potify model. They work with tribes and guilds, so it's kind of similar to the leagues. Indeed.
00:22:53.534 - 00:23:52.194, Speaker B: For example, with this mandate, within this mandate, we are testing a new structure, organizational structure, which is the labs. Basically, you can think about them as a sort of metrics structure, where the leagues are or the horizontal lines, and the labs are the columns of this metric structure. This is aimed, the goal of this new labs structure is to foster cross leagues communication, cross leagues collaboration, because something that we saw is that a group of five to ten people work really good together. They do a lot of things, they get things done, but there is not a lot of collaboration within different leagues. So we wanted to solve that with this kind of metric structure. We are now testing it. So there are definitely challenges that need to be solved, coordination and also participation of the token holders.
00:23:52.194 - 00:23:58.694, Speaker B: But that's also something that is really fascinating and that's how also the Dow space will grow in the future.
00:23:58.892 - 00:24:26.922, Speaker A: It's awesome to hear you talking about this stuff. I think there's a lot of other bright minds thinking about this at the same. So, you know, as I know you said you're headed to conferences this fall, so I'm sure you will link up with other like minded people and talk through these things. Maybe our paths will cross again. Mateo, maybe I'll get to interview you in another couple months, see how your labs and leagues are working out and we can talk dows sometime as well as idle. It's been awesome talking to you. Give us a snapshot.
00:24:26.922 - 00:24:31.362, Speaker A: What's coming up on the roadmap in the next couple of weeks and months for idle? What are we looking at here?
00:24:31.496 - 00:25:26.626, Speaker B: Yes, let me split the roadmap into two chunks because as we have been talking about, there is a big chunk of the protocol and product side and a big chunk of the governance and dow side on the product side. Right now the perpetual ill trenches are into a guarded lounge phase. They are in the first phase of the guarded launch with a capital deposit cap. Because we are collaborating with security auditors, we are also testing out these strategies. So the next step on the protocol side and product side would be to officially release the perpetual yield trenches without any deposit cap and going further. So right now the perpetual yield trenches are based on the best yield allocation strategy. We want to expand the spectrum of yield sources where we are trenching yield and risks.
00:25:26.626 - 00:26:19.330, Speaker B: We are thinking also about leading protocols like Wiren or convex to integrate within this kind of trenching product. That would be the main next step for the next couple, two, three months on the roadmap for the protocol and product side. On the Dao side. Instead, as I was saying, we are testing out the labs structure and what we want to do basically is now we have different working groups as well. Within the treasury league there is the business development team, DaO architecture, system development, economics. What we want to do is for this next mandate is to improve the onboarding management and also rewarding of these members. And on that side we would like to open up the leagues application to anybody.
00:26:19.330 - 00:26:30.722, Speaker B: So in December when this mandate will finish up, we will open up the application windows and we would like to double up the leagues members in order to go even faster.
00:26:30.866 - 00:26:39.942, Speaker A: So join daos. You can say to the people here, join discords, join telegrams. I do want to encourage people to do that. Where does your community mostly hang out? Mateo?
00:26:40.086 - 00:26:52.430, Speaker B: Yeah, so if the audience would like to follow the updates and the announcement that we do within both the protocol and Dao, I would suggest to follow us on Twitter. So idle finance, the one and only.
00:26:52.580 - 00:27:13.282, Speaker A: All the links are down below. We got everything down there. But please do follow idle. Mateo, I just found you on Twitter as well, Panteo, so I'll give you a follow and keep track of you as well and stay in touch that way, as you guys have. You know, I can track that as well. I'm very curious to see how that comes. Hey, man, it's been awesome getting to know you and talking idle.
00:27:13.282 - 00:27:22.794, Speaker A: Let's do it again sometime. Let's seriously, let's keep in touch, especially if you integrate anything else with Chainlink. We'll come on, talk about that, maybe keepers, maybe more price feeds. We'll see whatever comes next.
00:27:22.912 - 00:27:24.042, Speaker B: That sounds awesome.
00:27:24.176 - 00:27:26.122, Speaker A: All right, man, we'll talk to you later. Thanks for coming on.
00:27:26.176 - 00:27:27.420, Speaker B: Great, thank you.
