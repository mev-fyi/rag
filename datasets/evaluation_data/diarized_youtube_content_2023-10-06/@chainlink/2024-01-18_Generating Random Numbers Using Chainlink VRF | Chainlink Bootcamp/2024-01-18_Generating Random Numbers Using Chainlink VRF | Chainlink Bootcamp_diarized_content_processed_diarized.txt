00:00:00.330 - 00:00:27.640, Speaker A: You. Hello everyone. Welcome. Today is the session eight of our ten days boot camp. So we are almost done today. Two more days and we are done. I hope that you learned a lot until now and I miss you have a lot of things to teach you and it's my pleasure to share all my knowledgement with you.
00:00:27.640 - 00:01:17.634, Speaker A: And let's start. Thank you. Kisford. Yes. These lights start at page 149. If you don't have these lights, let's share my screen. So get these lights here or let's go to the pad because these lights are also in the pad and if you needed the link of these lights are here as well and you can claim here add your name.
00:01:17.634 - 00:01:54.000, Speaker A: Today I come back to the syrian country. We are good. I think today will be like a light session. But I'm exciting because I just updated this project that I did before. I think I started this project one year ago, one year and a half. And in some moments I have ideas and I decided to change it a bit and exactly today I have a new idea and change the project and I like it. I hope you like it as well.
00:01:54.000 - 00:02:43.740, Speaker A: It. Welcome. So let's start the presentation. Here we ask no session six, no session 148. Here we are. So today we are talking about chaining VRF to generate random numbers. And also, how can I use this in a gaming our project today, it's a small game doing this.
00:02:43.740 - 00:03:28.806, Speaker A: This is the pad. I think you are already over there. And let's talk about the chainlink VRf, the verifiable source of renderments. Why it's hard to get renderments with smart context. Remember that since the first class I told you that blockchain is deterministic. It's the perfect prediction. It means that if you define the rule to create to generate your random number inside ismat content, it can be predict.
00:03:28.806 - 00:04:08.280, Speaker A: This is the point. Think about this. Every blockchain node needs to reach the same result because of the consensus. So if you wet the rule to create your random number inside the smart context, any node when you are sending a transaction can try to use the random number before or predict this because it can understand the rule. Sometimes when they try to do this on chain, we use rules like oh, use the block number plus time spent plus surfing. But this can be predictable. This is the point.
00:04:08.280 - 00:05:04.438, Speaker A: And this is what I just told you. If you try to do the random numbers on chain the nodes that validate the transactions, the participants can control the interest, can manipulate this, and because of this, to solve this, we have the chain link VRF. So this is a random number generator for this much contest. It means that the random number will be generated off site, off chain and then you receive the number inside your ismatch content. It will be generated and saved for you in your ismatch content. And this is verifiable randomness. This is fair because this cannot be manipulated.
00:05:04.438 - 00:06:05.802, Speaker A: It's outside and this is a great way to ensure the randomness of your application where you can use this. For example, I have here some ideas. I can play with this or can I generate cards with different characteristics? Imagine that I can have a different background or a different image or a different hair color, eyes or weapon. I can generate NFTs with different characteristics. Generate by using the VRF using random numbers. And this is something. Another example, you can see that we are choosing the weapon of one of these guys and you are deciding who is winning.
00:06:05.802 - 00:06:55.002, Speaker A: This related with the randomness and I don't have too much to talk. The idea is to go to the hands on part. But I recommend for you, I write some resources for you. Before that, let's go to Dev chamber, link to VRF resources and edit this for you. Let's create a divider here. And here we are on VRs. I really like these quick stats.
00:06:55.002 - 00:07:33.820, Speaker A: If you need something like to create a mystery box or to create some kind of app or to discover how the costs can be paid by the indie users. For example, some guides to create this. Tutorials for beginners. A lot of videos, documentation and more explanation related to the VRF. Okay, this is including that we have curses. Other curses. Great.
00:07:33.820 - 00:08:04.254, Speaker A: So let's go forward. We are now ready to create our gaming. What we are doing? Let's come back here. This is our game. Our game is called runners and we have four different characters. Is this starting on zero as well? And you can create your NFT. So this is a gaming with NFTs.
00:08:04.254 - 00:08:38.400, Speaker A: It's an NFT collection. You can create your player on this NFT game, choosing one of these. And then the idea is that these players are running and we are discovering how much they are running using randomness. Like one guy can run more kilometers or miles than the other. So is this. Let's go. This.
00:08:38.400 - 00:09:13.180, Speaker A: First of all, let's see how is our faucet today we are on avalanche Fuji. Okay. Metamask. Metamask Fuji. And let's see how is our faucet now? Yes, probably need a bit. So let's add something for you. How many people do you have here now? Okay, we are good.
00:09:13.180 - 00:09:45.540, Speaker A: So let's go to the faucet and fund the faucet for you. And Maya vax is running out. Get this only if you really need it. If you already have it you don't need more. And I must send the link token. The link token is better. I can send 600.
00:09:45.540 - 00:10:41.320, Speaker A: 600 and is this guys I'm using to put the password in the pad and not here in the YouTube and the password is in the pad. It's in the beginning here line 22 or here. Okay so let's go forward probably now you have some tokens to get it. But guys if you get this yesterday you don't need more today. It's not possible that you use everything yesterday. It's only for the people that didn't get yet. It's okay.
00:10:41.320 - 00:11:38.202, Speaker A: Let's go to remix now let's prepare our remix like always. So we are going to remix and show injected provider I must do this whole SDGs here remix. So icon five environment injected provider here we are. This custom network is Fuji. Now let's create our smart concepts. I think I must create with you because I am in the wrong workspace and I don't have it. So let's get it.
00:11:38.202 - 00:12:19.960, Speaker A: If you need the quantities already here as well and the link of the exercises are in the beginning of the pad. At the beginning of the pad and we are creating the runners so let's copy and paste the code. Don't cut it. Oh I need to do it first. Wait renals. So let's copy and paste for you. Yes I know I can trust myself.
00:12:19.960 - 00:14:01.992, Speaker A: Let's do this for you as well and do it some minutes and yes our song we are on Fuji today I could do on Sepolia but Fuji is faster to generate the render numbers but if you try to do on Sepolia you must change a lot of things inside the content. Don't deploy yet okay we must do other things before let's explain the content and you can't deploy what we have here. So it's an NFT. So I'm using the same libraries from yesterday I'm generating the JSON on chain as well but I'm using the images off chain from ITFs and here I'm importing the VRF service so I must have the VRF coordination interface and the consumer base because my content must have some functions imported from the consumer base. We are using counters to manage the ID strings to generate the JSON here. This is some events that we create to manage to monitor the VRs when we send a request. When the request is full.
00:14:01.992 - 00:14:41.620, Speaker A: Fill it. And this is the request status. I structure for each request has a unique ID. So for each ID we have this to know when it is fulfilled, when already exists, it's supposed to not have both of the same. And what is the random numbers generated on this request. And then here I'm on Fuji. So if you try to do this on Sepolia, you must change this, you must update to Sepolia.
00:14:41.620 - 00:15:02.968, Speaker A: And let's see the supported networks. So here we are. You can use this on Sepolia, on Mumbai and I am on. Okay. And the link token is the same for our services that we are using. But I must feel this. I must have the VRF coordinator.
00:15:02.968 - 00:15:40.712, Speaker A: This is a smart contract that's sending the number or numbers for me. You can see that we have a hash here that we are using this laney hash. This is what we are paying to generate each number. When you receive the number, your function can do something with the number. So this is the gas limit to do whatever you like to do here. It means that I must get only one block confirmation to receive the number. And I can generate in the same time the maximum of 500 random numbers.
00:15:40.712 - 00:16:18.192, Speaker A: For example, if I go to Sepolia, the minimum confirmations are three. It means that I must wait three blocks to receive the numbers. Okay, only to understand, but we are on Fuji. I studied this here for you before. Where we are here on the references part, they have some questions here. Yes, exactly. Catch.
00:16:18.192 - 00:17:04.950, Speaker A: If you do this and they are not showing again, only mix, you have some options. If you add them in our pad, the collaborative pad, you have them. If not, you can try to go to remix, to remix node, to metamask and check your transactions. Like this is a contract deployment. So if I saw this on block Explorer, it's saying that I created this content. If I know the last content that I created, this is the content that you must have. And when you do this, like you have this content now, you will not deploy again.
00:17:04.950 - 00:17:42.370, Speaker A: You use using the at address and then you have the code here and the IP address here. I don't have it. I didn't copy it. And then you can interact with some as much content that you already deployed. Okay, so what is the VRF coordinator? It's a smart contest that receive the request that you are doing. Receive your request to get render numbers, receive the rendal number when this was generated and send it to your smart context. Okay.
00:17:42.370 - 00:18:20.090, Speaker A: And I saw another question here. The hash is related to how is the number generated? I will not explain this now because it's a bit complex to the beginners. But I really would like to. Have you seen here resources? Not the resources, but I have something here related to this. I'd like to highlight this. The security considerations related to this. Okay.
00:18:20.090 - 00:19:00.200, Speaker A: And the request. If I ask three numbers or if I ask not three numbers, if I ask three times, I'm doing three requests. I have three different requests ID and each of them you bring to me different numbers. And this is some important value like I'm using the hequest ID to understand. Think about the safety blockchain confirmation time. How many blocks would you like to wait in the workshops that you waited, the minimum. If you request again, you will get a new request ID.
00:19:00.200 - 00:19:29.940, Speaker A: So it's not the same number. Maybe this is not for us. Now be careful of this. Like the code that you are putting on fulfilling the words I'm explaining, this cannot heave. Okay. And this is the VRF consumer days that we are using now. And here we have some best practices like arranging.
00:19:29.940 - 00:19:53.992, Speaker A: We are doing something like this. This is useful for you as well. So let's add these two to highlight to you. Learn about this later. You must study a bit alone. Okay? So let's go forward. Here we are.
00:19:53.992 - 00:20:08.812, Speaker A: I'm explaining this for you. So this is the information related to Fuji, my coordinator. This is the smart contract. This is the key. Hash the cowback limit. I use the maximum. The request confirmation.
00:20:08.812 - 00:20:31.640, Speaker A: You saw that I could wait only one on Fuji, but I'm waiting three blocks. Yes, I asked it to not do this yet. You must wait. Sorry. And I'm asking one number here. Be careful because number of words is not exactly words. It's amount of numbers.
00:20:31.640 - 00:21:09.696, Speaker A: And I'm requesting one number. I could request two, three, four like I used to do. In some events I use VRF to generate, to giveaways, to do raffles. And I did the raffles for example to give you away tickets. Today's match con the chaining conference. So I did this like three months before the conference in different other conference that I was and give away two or three tickets per place that I was. All of this I'm doing using VRF.
00:21:09.696 - 00:22:06.980, Speaker A: And also in the last Smartcom in Barcelona in October of past year, I was leading the hacker house, ending the hacker house. We did some heffles as well using VRF here. Every time that I request some number, I'm adding here on this list the request is ID. I have this only to get the last and I have this with all the numbers that I got a list of numbers and why you could not do this. Because we must link our contact with a VRF subscription. That we must do now in the VRF service and we didn't yet. So we must wait this.
00:22:06.980 - 00:22:48.492, Speaker A: And after we create our subscription on VRF, we can come back here to deploy the content. So it's because of this error. Oh, did you got the chair? We will solve it for you, constantinos. But I'm not sure. And to understand what's happened in last smartcom, we give away some chairs, some chain link gaming chairs, and probably I know that we have some problems with logistics to send them. Let's see what happens. And here we are going forward to explain this.
00:22:48.492 - 00:23:17.310, Speaker A: First I'm managing the idea of the NFT. I have four images. So I have a list of images. The image zero. Remember that statue? Zero. They are restored on IPFs, the image one and all of them. This is our players today.
00:23:17.310 - 00:24:17.200, Speaker A: So I create a list with the image. I create another list with the names. I could do a structure with the name and image, but I decide to do it in this way. I create another structure here. Each time that you create a player inside the game, the player you have the image, the distance that he run it and the round, because you can ask to run many rounds. And if you run 100 km in two hounds, and we have another player that run 100 km in one hound, he is the winner. Okay, here I have the list of players, the list of runners.
00:24:17.200 - 00:24:59.004, Speaker A: And every time that a runner ask random number, ask how many kilometers he run it. We are managing this, adding the request and associating the request with that player. The token ID. Here is the constructor. So in order to deploy the content, you must have the subscription id. We didn't yet wait until the end of the content. And this is the NFG, the ERC 721.
00:24:59.004 - 00:25:44.510, Speaker A: We are using initializing the VRF coordinator, the subscription ID and our ad in the constructor. We are minting for you, for the owner, a player with the first image, the zero. Then we have the function safe mint. To create more players, to mint more nfts. When you are minting, you must choose like the receiver and the character zero. Between zero and three you will get the image. Initializing this with zero, distance is zero.
00:25:44.510 - 00:26:55.120, Speaker A: And here you can see that I'm equating the JSON inside here programmatically with the name, the character naming. It's the chaining key runner, the URL of the image and the attributes. Distance zero, round zero. Starting now, this is like we did yesterday, but now I'm changing more parameters here inside the concrete. And then we have the function run. This function is to request to the VRF how many kilometers you are running, your player are running. So here I'm requesting, so I must pass all the parameters related to the VRF coordinator and then you get the response, the request ID, saving the list of requests and also associate the request with the token ID with the player.
00:26:55.120 - 00:27:39.220, Speaker A: And then I have the fulfill random words. This is the function that the VRF you look for inside your content. Okay, so if you don't have this function, you will not receive the number. It's so important to have this like yesterday. Remember that the CCAP receiver must have the underscore CCP receive function. Now the VRF receiver must have the fulfill random words. Then when I receiving the random words, I'm receiving the request ID and the random numbers.
00:27:39.220 - 00:28:57.770, Speaker A: First of all, again I'm testing if I have an NFT, I'm checking if the request is valid, exists, then I update that is fulfilled, I update the number that was generated and here I'm manipulating the random number because the random number that I'm receiving, it's so huge and crazy and I must have a number between I'm dividing by ten and get the rest. So my number, it will be like between zero and 90 plus one. So between one and ten, multiplying by ten, so the distance will be between ten and 100. Okay, so for this token Id, I will get the request ID and I date on my runners my NFT. Are you updated? The distance and the route. Then if I update this, it means that I must update the JSON again. So in the JSon.
00:28:57.770 - 00:29:26.192, Speaker A: Oh, I got it. I just found an error. Wait a minute. That I'd like to fix this because I did this and could not understand what was happening. Now I know when I'm dating this I did the wrong. Yes. So what is the problem now? Wait, if I copy the same, it should be the same.
00:29:26.192 - 00:29:50.308, Speaker A: Let's copy this over there because my problem is over there. Talking ID, talking ID here again, what's my problem? Name me. Name me. Name me. Name me. Characters name me. Oh, this exists.
00:29:50.308 - 00:30:23.550, Speaker A: What's happened? So wait, I'd like to solve it live. 1 minute. Let's understand what's happened because here I have the character imaging. Let's see what's wrong here. Distance token imaging. Let's come back here. Let's come back here.
00:30:23.550 - 00:31:22.250, Speaker A: Yes, it's supposed to meet you to solve only this, the name it's here, it's here. Let's get this part. Yeah, supposed to be only this. The naming that I changed and the description, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Are you seeing something wrong here? The runner's token ID like this is like the order, the space, maybe not because I'm using the space here. This is not the problem here. Let's try to fix this.
00:31:22.250 - 00:31:52.330, Speaker A: Name me Runner, runners token image. Let's see here. Name me Runner, runner, token image and attributes. It's exactly the same. Yeah, and the problem with the name. Okay, let's try again. Copy everything from the others.
00:31:52.330 - 00:32:52.190, Speaker A: Did you understand? Wait, is this like here? I'm updating to runner NFT and the description, it's better. But I'd like to use the same that I created here. And I could not understand why it was changed, so must have been the way that is here. Token ID runners should be this. So why you try to do this again? Now? I'm copying out the URI from here. Let's see from here to here now. No.
00:32:52.190 - 00:33:48.254, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the point characters Id. No, this is inside. This is right because I need this inside. Lining 107 has after because should it be exactly the same? The runners, the distance are here, the image are here. I only changing this. The characteristic major is here, it's here. Maybe this makes sense because I'm not using the.
00:33:48.254 - 00:34:12.102, Speaker A: This is the talking ID, guys, here. No, I don't have the chat ID. I must use this. I must use exactly this. This is the point. I must use the aux over there because changing this, okay, I got it. It's not the talking ID.
00:34:12.102 - 00:34:56.476, Speaker A: Over there is the character of the talking. So how can I get this? Because I don't know when I came here, I can't change this again, this is the point. Okay, I got it. Because I don't know the character id when I'm creating here. So I maintain the way that it is and I will fix this later because it will be a bit more complicated probably I must add here not only the image, but what is the character id. Okay, let's maintain on this way. Sorry that I could not make.
00:34:56.476 - 00:35:58.768, Speaker A: It is better now. So what I did here, I'm updating the distance and the round and now I'm updating the path again my json again and finish. If I like to get the request status of each request with one request, it is here and this is the normal functions, okay? Yes guys, it's not this. The problem is that if you go here on my safe mint. I miss sending the character id but after I mint the character I don't know what is the character anymore. So when I try to fulfill and generate the JSon again I don't know who is this name again. So the only way to solve this is adding here in the structure I must add the character here.
00:35:58.768 - 00:36:43.180, Speaker A: It will be more complex. Maybe if you'd like I can have five minutes to do this but I think I prefer to do in this way now and fix it later and I let you know that I updated okay but for now let's do this work. If you have time I change it. So this is done now. But you know that you could not deploy remember here not deploy yet. Let's go to VRF. So vrf chain link not this because this is mine.
00:36:43.180 - 00:38:29.430, Speaker A: Let's go here and connect your wallet create description and are you asking here to add your naming and description id because we are using this in a few minutes and sorry guys but it's so funny here that the portuguese guys are here and talking portuguese in the chat and sometimes confuse my mind and hello Portuguese. Brazilian guys and okay here we are. So I am on the VRF series on chaining and when you connect your wallet be sure that you are on Fuji and sometimes you try to connect and the VRF you try to change to send you to sepolia don't go, you must be on Fuji. Okay. On Fuji it means exactly Joel be on Fuji then create description and you create a new one. Now you can see that you don't need to put nothing here. Not email, not project naming Create subscription is this creating ending in some minutes? It seems that it's confirmed.
00:38:29.430 - 00:39:47.938, Speaker A: If you'd like to see your subscription and if you'd like to not wait here you can close, go to home and you can see our subscription. I have a lot so I created this. Now this is the idea that I'm asking you okay it and I click it on my subscription ID and this is mine sub Description so copy this id and paste here you is mine. No, it changes to sepolia when you connect your wallet. So come back to metamask and come back to avalanche Fuji here. Then you update the VRF. Okay? Yes everyone created this subscription.
00:39:47.938 - 00:40:26.162, Speaker A: So great. Then this is my subscription. Next step I must add funds. So let's add go to actions in fact and let's try to get more space here. Go to actions. If you didn't close probably you have a dead function. Sorry that I closed it.
00:40:26.162 - 00:42:01.384, Speaker A: Actions fund description and let's send ten link I'm doing this now I close it. If I not close probably I have this automatically. So fund subscription ten link confirm approving this it so in a few minutes are you having my ten links? Let's see how are you? How good. Let's drink something. Still so hot here it where you can see the description here. After create go to home. If you go to home it's your subscription or here and then ours.
00:42:01.384 - 00:42:58.660, Speaker A: Like you must have you one here you can see that I have a lot and I have ten link now then click on your subscription. Here we are including that can be better if you add this here. If you'd like to add this here like some people are doing. Great idea. It's better now you are ready to deploy. So the parameter is your subscription id. And then let's deploy and add here the naming and the runner address.
00:42:58.660 - 00:43:57.500, Speaker A: Your naming and the venue address. So time to redeploy it. Let's wait 1 minute more for you. A lot of people are doing you are creating so I'm late. Let's do it. So here we are. What's my subscription ID? It's here 904 nine four go to remix deploy here the parameter in the right side of deploy is your subscription ID.
00:43:57.500 - 00:44:26.568, Speaker A: Deploy. Oh no, I didn't connect on my wallet. See I'm a remix so I'm a rock. Let's go to the injected provider. It was so fast now. Yes, deploy. Okay.
00:44:26.568 - 00:45:07.488, Speaker A: Copy and paste for you. And today we have a lot of go forward, come back, go to remix, go to the VRFC part. So it's hard. We have a lot of things to do. It's okay if you deploy now on Sepolia but I'd like to. You know that sepolia is lower than Fuji. So probably you must wait more to receive the rental numbers.
00:45:07.488 - 00:45:40.420, Speaker A: Okay, but it's okay. Yes, a lot of rentals are here. Ready. So great. Let's another divider here drink more. Something to have with you. With me.
00:45:40.420 - 00:46:37.490, Speaker A: Great question Kyo. Um, the point that it's preventing this is the next step that I'm doing now. So what is the next step? Okay, you have your subscription ID. You create your content. But if you try to do something now you will got an error because your content is not inside your subscription Id. So what I must do now, I must go to VRF again. Go to your VRF.
00:46:37.490 - 00:47:28.650, Speaker A: We have something here and you must add a consumer. This is your smart contract, your runner address. Okay, let's do this part now. So got mini copy my runner address. Go to the VRF and you have the add the consumer here. So now only after this. This is much content is authorized to using my account on VRF.
00:47:28.650 - 00:48:20.510, Speaker A: Okay, it seems that is done. I used to not wait. I will refresh this because it's done. Okay, you can see here that I have you one consumer now. No fulfillment, no requests until now. So now on remix on runners. Oh, before that.
00:48:20.510 - 00:49:02.554, Speaker A: Would you like to see your NFT? I think you can see before. So before that, go to open C. Like I have this. Let's go here and find my new collection. Renner. Here I have you one on Fujis here. And here we are.
00:49:02.554 - 00:49:32.284, Speaker A: I have the elf. Yes, the elf. But you know that when you change the name. Yeah, I will fix this later. You know that. So again, how to add a consumer here? Go to your VRF subscription on the VRF app. Go to add the consumer.
00:49:32.284 - 00:50:04.700, Speaker A: When you do this, the first time is in the middle of the screen. So add consumer and paste the address of your runners and confirm the transaction. I already did it. I cannot did it again. So here is my elf. If I open it, you can see the levels part. No distance, no round.
00:50:04.700 - 00:50:37.620, Speaker A: Okay, so what I'm doing now. Oh, so cute. Yes, I like this. Let's add the other collection. Here's so this is mine. Where is mine? Here you can add your collection. So on runners.
00:50:37.620 - 00:51:18.874, Speaker A: Let's run. Let's execute the run function. A lot of collections here. Sorry, Leon. Amazing. I'm so glad of you. Wait a minute.
00:51:18.874 - 00:52:01.080, Speaker A: For you to do this. Elias again, after you created the subscription. Here you have the home button. Go over there. And then if you are still connected, if you scroll down, you can see your subscription. So come back to remix. Expand the runners and execute run.
00:52:01.080 - 00:52:33.140, Speaker A: Let's do it. Parameter token ID zero. Why is zero? Because we have only one NfT in our collection. So zero. Go to runners. Parameter zero. Click on run.
00:52:33.140 - 00:53:22.810, Speaker A: So what I did now, I just colored this function. It means that I request a random number to the VRF coordinator. How can I see this? If I came here, for example, I can see the last request id. I can copy it. If I go to the request Ids, I can see that it's probably. Oh no, this is the ID. This is not this.
00:53:22.810 - 00:54:27.162, Speaker A: The request is here as hequest. I can see that is already fulfilled. So if I'd like to see what's happened with my token, I will go. Not here. Wait. So first what I did the last request id copy and use in sequest on sequests when you have this result, it's done. We are ready.
00:54:27.162 - 00:55:32.190, Speaker A: So I'd like to see the result of this. Where am I going now? I'd like to go to now go to runners parameter zero is the token id zero again. Let's go. So runners zero runners. And here I can see for example this is mine image of the elf distance 80 roundy one because we execute the one. So here a US Q two. Let's change challenger ourselves distance round.
00:55:32.190 - 00:55:58.940, Speaker A: So mining it's 80 for now is in one round. Let's put a roundy one. Where is the request ID? Banana. It's here. Go in the blue bottoms over there. You have here the last request ID. It's here.
00:55:58.940 - 00:56:54.100, Speaker A: Yoohoo. Amazing. If it's false yet Nicole, probably you only must wait a bit more because it was not fulfilled by the VRF services. So wait a bit more and try again. If yours are in Tim Vandena it's because you didn't execute the run function yet to ask a Rendell number. And let's see this also nice. We are almost going over there on Openc.
00:56:54.100 - 00:57:38.730, Speaker A: Open the player, the ID on the right top corner. Go to the three dots and refresh metadata. And now I answer your question. It's 50 of 50 because we only have one player, one NFT in our collection. And this nft has 50 for you. We are doing another. And this is changing some minutes.
00:57:38.730 - 00:58:15.680, Speaker A: Um. Let's see. How can I discover this for you? Elias, did you create your subscription? Maybe you didn't create or create again. Be sure that you are on metamask on avalanche Fuji. Be sure that here is avalanche Fuji. And create it again. Probably create on Sepolia.
00:58:15.680 - 00:58:52.160, Speaker A: And now if I refresh this including you can see that my consumer is here. I already use something because I have one fulfillment. But I was going to this part. So went to your collection. Right button. Open this image. And when I upload data you lost the Lf and it appear runners again.
00:58:52.160 - 00:59:30.540, Speaker A: So more refresh metadata. And you must wait a bit to refresh the page. You know that I have problems here. But here you can see that the distance is eight of eight. Because I only have you one Nft with eight and round one. Okay, let's create another NfT now. Wow.
00:59:30.540 - 01:00:32.200, Speaker A: Amazing. You run. Amazing. Yes, some are the same. The winners from this round. If you have your collection. If you find your collection, you click on the NfT in your collection.
01:00:32.200 - 01:01:36.750, Speaker A: So this is the mint your wallet and choose a new character. So remember that I have the character here, this is from zero to three. Oh, you don't have a link. Adding only link here now. Okay, I must save the footage to the other class as well because I only have a bit, but link I can send if you need more. Link. I'm adding on the faucet.
01:01:36.750 - 01:02:17.814, Speaker A: So get on the faucet in a few minutes and let's create the new one. Here I came safe mint. So it's not mint, it's safe mint for my wallet. And remember that. Imagine that you can use this with your friends with different wallets, different players. Create a front end for this. I'm so tired going front end guys.
01:02:17.814 - 01:02:59.568, Speaker A: But I love to see a front end for this. And I like to have the wish now. I love the wish. So if you go here, this is the elf and this is the wish. The arc you can see here the elf, the night, the orc and the wish. So I collect the wish now, confirming. Yes, you can watch the video later and complete it tomorrow.
01:02:59.568 - 01:03:26.190, Speaker A: In fact, you have some days after we finish the curse to complete this at least at end of January. Okay, three. I did it. Three. Because the tree is the witch 0123, you can do the orc if you'd like. It's up to you. It's your player now.
01:03:26.190 - 01:03:57.836, Speaker A: So it seems that is done. If I came into the collection now I have the witch. And this was updated to run an NFT because my ejo over there. Let's fix this later. And this is the witch. So now I like to compete between my players. So will the witch run more than the delf? I don't know.
01:03:57.836 - 01:04:24.388, Speaker A: Let's see. So after this, what am I doing? Run with the token iD. Remember that. Be careful, Agora. The token Id is the id of. This is the Token iD. One that has the character number three.
01:04:24.388 - 01:04:59.520, Speaker A: Okay, but the token Id is one. Let's do this now. Run now the second NfT in my collection. Run the character. This is not your image. This is your second NFT. Okay, confirming.
01:04:59.520 - 01:05:36.878, Speaker A: And then I ask you. So this is the naming player token id zero. Token id zero distance round, new one. After this we are running now the token ID one distance and roundy one as well. Okay, let's see this. I run it. I don't know what happened.
01:05:36.878 - 01:05:58.950, Speaker A: Let's see. I'd like to go to runners now. I'd like to see the one. Wow. I am the winner. Distance 100 like you guys. I am the winner now 100.
01:05:58.950 - 01:06:44.720, Speaker A: And I can see here as well. If I open that and he fresh the metadata, he fresh here you change the name to be a wrong name. Yes. Change it levels. Now you can see that the wish was 100 of 100 and the offi was eight. If I update this now, it's eight of 100. Okay.
01:06:44.720 - 01:07:19.280, Speaker A: Yes. This was the issue in the code that I tried to solve it live, but I decided to first do the workshop. Now at the end I do this, but it is a neighbor. I must confess this for you. So is this. Now we have two players and we can do the second round. And we are competing between us as well to see who is here.
01:07:19.280 - 01:07:40.690, Speaker A: Oh, we have a lot of winners here. Amazing. Let's get this for you. So I am the winner. Leon is the winner now, Joel. Great. A lot of winners.
01:07:40.690 - 01:08:48.190, Speaker A: Yes. So amazing. Let's go to the round two. So what is the round two? We must do the run. Execute the run function for with token Id zero and one. And then with token Zero after it, do the same with token Id one. Okay, so on round two I ask you the name.
01:08:48.190 - 01:09:38.290, Speaker A: Me, your name me. Your player, player one and your player two. Player one distance and player two distance. Let's do this. Now I am going to remix. First you execute the run function with the zero, the token zero. Then I'm doing the same with the token one.
01:09:38.290 - 01:10:10.760, Speaker A: And for each of them they have his own request. But I can check my request here. Like let's see the runners one, it is still on route one. Let's see the runner zero. It's on round two. Now my distance is 108 on my first. So this is mine.
01:10:10.760 - 01:11:05.080, Speaker A: Let's see, the round is supposed to be two for all of this. Runners one, this is now it's not so good. The other Passover now. Nicole, are you see your contact? Okay, where can I find you? Is your contact here? No, Nicole, if I can check your content. If you add here in the pet. Okay. Yes.
01:11:05.080 - 01:11:55.404, Speaker A: Dusamon has 200 into two rounds. Yes. Kiss for this is so fun. And remember that you are competing between you. You're both characters. And also we are competing between us because we have here one of the characters who is the winner here. You are from Atlanta, is this you check yours.
01:11:55.404 - 01:12:23.108, Speaker A: Okay. Also I will try to check your VRF subscription. Let's check your subscription first. I saw that it was the problem. Nicole, this is the problem with you. Your subscription didn't have any link here. So go here and fund subscription.
01:12:23.108 - 01:12:56.488, Speaker A: And exactly you have here three transactions pending. But this will not be fulfilled because you didn't have any balance here. Add ten links. Okay. And it's nice to solve some problems live because other people can learn with this as well. How we are now. Who 108 like me.
01:12:56.488 - 01:13:38.274, Speaker A: Summer, do you have something that is winner than us? Until now we are the winners here. Leon is the winner as well. Oh, here Vichy 190. So good. And let's create a third NFT. And you can play now in the way that you like to must. You know that my code has.
01:13:38.274 - 01:14:20.736, Speaker A: It's not really a neighborhood, but I'd like to improve my code. So I update the code now. And then I update in the pad as well. The virtue of the renews. And let's see, probably this is not updated because I must update the metadata. Come back here and repeat. Come back here and repeat the levels.
01:14:20.736 - 01:14:48.580, Speaker A: Now we have two rounds. 110 from 108. Oh, this is only the roundy one yet not updated. This is interesting. You can see the difference between the rounds and the distance. So you can play now in the way that you'd like to play. I must update my content and I have time.
01:14:48.580 - 01:15:30.646, Speaker A: So I do this live. You can learn what happened here. So I create the v two of the runners and create a new version. Learners v two. Then copy this paste here and let's solve the problems. First problem I'd like to have the naming of my character here I have two options. Or add the.
01:15:30.646 - 01:16:01.054, Speaker A: Get this again. Or add the name directly. I prefer to add the name. So now I have here the naming. So where I'm using the struct in the safe min. So here you have the character naming. Let's see if it's good.
01:16:01.054 - 01:16:31.790, Speaker A: Yes, the character naming the image. I can add some space here. It's not bad. The image and starting from zero. I'm initializing the runner here. So here I can use to be consistent with the others. I can use the runner Stoke and id name me.
01:16:31.790 - 01:17:00.550, Speaker A: Runner stoking ID name me. This is name me and the name is here. So if I go now, I'm not sure if this is working. Okay. If I go now on the full view as well. I only update this. Should it be this? No, I updated the description.
01:17:00.550 - 01:17:36.462, Speaker A: It seems that it's working. But I'm terrible with this. Okay, if not working, I must decode the bytecode and understand what I did wrong. So let's try. Sometimes when I must do this, I have another content that I do it locally test and come back for. Now let's see if this is working. Don't do this with me.
01:17:36.462 - 01:18:02.358, Speaker A: Wait. That I'm doing alone. If it's good, you can create another and runners v two. Not confused, everyone. When I finish, when I make sure that it's working, I can sharing the pad as well. Okay, but now I'm having fun. Live.
01:18:02.358 - 01:18:27.900, Speaker A: Deploying contacts live. Creating new things. Live. So this is the runners V two. My subscription is this deploy. Confirming. I will not add in the VRF page if it's not working.
01:18:27.900 - 01:18:51.940, Speaker A: So what you get here? Get the contact address of the second version. Check it here. Not appearing yet. We must wait a bit more. I have a tricky one. It's not appearing yet. I came into any that I did before.
01:18:51.940 - 01:19:15.580, Speaker A: And in the index zero that I missed that I minted. I changed the address directly here on the link. And this is this. It's the elf. Is runners working? So I created this. Now let's create a new one. Only to be sure that it's working.
01:19:15.580 - 01:19:53.090, Speaker A: I am on V two. Now I'd like to create a new player. And this will be the trigger. Now creating a new player. I'd like to create one more. How of them? I have you one painting. Second painting.
01:19:53.090 - 01:20:26.674, Speaker A: I should wait. Yes. Now I have you one unapproved because I send it twice. I come here and approve this. Okay. Line 83 is the naming. Because I changed the stretch.
01:20:26.674 - 01:20:46.910, Speaker A: So I must change the name here. I'm checking if it's good. Then I'm sharing with you. So I create three characters. Let's see if they are here. But you can challenge yourself doing yourself like you are doing. Amazing, Christopher.
01:20:46.910 - 01:21:08.760, Speaker A: Here we are. I have three now. Okay. This nft is good, but you know that I must test the run function. So let's add in my VRF description. Add consumer the new concept. Approving it.
01:21:08.760 - 01:21:51.204, Speaker A: Wait to be approved. Not approved yet. Yes, approve it now so I can update this manually. Okay. I have two concepts now. Let's run for the token. Remember that the token three.
01:21:51.204 - 01:22:14.750, Speaker A: I have three tokens. So the index is. So let's doing on the two. The last. Thank you. And now I must check you. When the two is updated.
01:22:14.750 - 01:22:24.446, Speaker A: Go to runners. Runners. Runners. Runners. Here. Let's see the two. Not updated yet.
01:22:24.446 - 01:22:41.970, Speaker A: Now you can see that is the night. Let's go again. Yes. Distance one round the one. If I come back here the night. This is the index two. You can see the URL.
01:22:41.970 - 01:23:06.640, Speaker A: Update this and let's see if the name will be night. This is the point that we are looking for. Let's do it. Levels up dated. The naming is right, so it's good. Let's share this a few. V two is done.
01:23:06.640 - 01:24:06.358, Speaker A: I just did it live. I'm not comfortable to do this live. Okay, if you'd like to have the V two, whenever V two begin, because in the other workshops I will use David. Okay, so probably I may updating on the GitHub David in a few minutes. Great question, arson. Can we add another attribute? Yes, come here. If you'd like to do this, and you must add it here when you are minting and also when you are updating.
01:24:06.358 - 01:24:51.100, Speaker A: Maybe I can do this in another function, a function that do both because it's hard to create this. If you'd like, it's here. The trayotype is the name of your new attribute and the value is the value. Let's do some fun with you now, guys. Let's go to here, share this with you. Understand the json online. How can I see this? For example, I get here the second version, you get the token Uri of any of this, like we are using the two, so get from the two.
01:24:51.100 - 01:26:13.136, Speaker A: This is mine, okay, token Uri. So if I use this, decode this, let's go over there. Oh, this is so is mouth for you. So let's decode this decode and here is the result copy. If I paste it here, this can be nice in a nice way, like this, and this is the JSON. But when I be doing this like programmatically inside the smash content, sometimes I forgot one comma, I forgot one of these. It's a mess.
01:26:13.136 - 01:27:16.050, Speaker A: Then I create everything, go chopping, zeppelin is not appearing and I must do again. So I used to do this, I came here, get what I encode decode and then try to understand what I missed it here. I was doing this before our class, and this is now you understand how to decode, how is the code and code the decoded data. Okay, I think we are good today. You have the second contact. I know that we didn't use it on this class, but you have it because I will upgrade on the GitHub soon, like now. But over there, I will not add the v two.
01:27:16.050 - 01:28:16.830, Speaker A: You'll be only runners because the other class can have it directly. Copy dating it now git add. Okay, so the GitHub has directly the new version, okay, and not v two, it's only this directly the new version that is working. Yeah, this is nice, I like this, I use this a lot. And I think you were good today. So if you have some question, you can write it now. And I'm doing like the marketing part as well.
01:28:16.830 - 01:29:43.484, Speaker A: If you didn't subscribe to our technique channel, don't forget to do it. Remember also that I know that the people have some dubs and you are doing an amazing job, amazing interaction on your discord. Go to the boot camp channel. Oh, really? That you are Bennett. I know that the discord has some bots over there. Are you asking someone to contact you? Could you share here your telegram ID? Like, are you putting this now? Problems with discord. Add here your handle, your naming handle.
01:29:43.484 - 01:30:17.288, Speaker A: Okay. And I will pass this to the discord administration. But it's better for me if you add it on the pad because I can't copy here. Being a dimingue, I cannot copy during the live stream. Okay. Said, let's check yours. Yes, the linking balance.
01:30:17.288 - 01:31:05.354, Speaker A: You be funded if you cancel this description. Okay, thank you. And sage, let's see yours. Did you refresh this? First of all, nice York. Here you are in the round one of four. Did you refresh the metadata? Let's see if it is updating. Issue one or four.
01:31:05.354 - 01:31:27.706, Speaker A: Let's see your concrete. Are you in the view one is this probably, yes. So are you. Add your content here for me. Runners. And not the interface, the runners address. This is yours.
01:31:27.706 - 01:31:45.740, Speaker A: So you are checking here. The one where I got yours. Where I put yours here. Okay. This is your collection. You have it too. Okay.
01:31:45.740 - 01:32:24.920, Speaker A: What has happened is Runners zero. You did four rounds with the runner zero with the runners one. You did only one round. So it's not updating because you didn't execute the run function with the runners one. So you must go here and execute it with the run to the character ID number one. Okay. This is you save.
01:32:24.920 - 01:33:17.838, Speaker A: It's not the refresh is this photo album. It means that here maybe the photo album with the code not updated. I recommend you to use the photo album from here. Try with this photo album. And I think we are good today. So thank you, everyone. Congrats.
01:33:17.838 - 01:33:49.818, Speaker A: Now, you know how to generate random numbers in a verifiable and secure way of chain. And what we are doing tomorrow, tomorrow we are learning about functions. And with functions we can interact with any external site, external API. So tomorrow we are doing this together. Thank you for being here and congrats. This is the session number way. 80 days here.
01:33:49.818 - 01:34:28.290, Speaker A: And I'm so proud of you. And if you'd like to share something in the social networks, use the hashtag chain link bootcamp 2024. Not this. No, I cannot put myself on time. Chain link, chain link boot camp. This is the hashtag that you can use it and bye, guys. See you tomorrow.
01:34:28.290 - 01:34:30.440, Speaker A: Bye. Like.
