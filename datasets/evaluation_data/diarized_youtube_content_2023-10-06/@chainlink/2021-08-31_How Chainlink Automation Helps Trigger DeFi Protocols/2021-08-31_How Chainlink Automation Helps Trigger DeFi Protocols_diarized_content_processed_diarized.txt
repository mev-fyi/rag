00:00:06.650 - 00:00:13.600, Speaker A: As a starting point, it might be useful for the audience to hear a bit about your project and the role of automation in your work. Kane would you like to kick us off with this?
00:00:14.930 - 00:00:15.630, Speaker B: Sure.
00:00:15.780 - 00:01:28.470, Speaker C: So for those of you who don't know, synthetix allows you to get exposure to a range of different assets on Ethereum. It's a fairly complex smart contract suite and we were lucky to work with Chainlink early to implement their oracles to support the network. But over the intervening two years, I think it's been now since we've been live, we've added a lot of new functionality and there's a lot of aspects of the system that require intervention. And so we have a number of aspects of the protocol that on a weekly basis some bot or some keeper needs to come in and make a transaction based on some information that's on the blockchain. And it's just not possible to kind of automate those things with simple payments. So we've been talking to chainlink about taking over a lot of that infrastructure, as they do with our oracles, because we want a streamlined and simple interface for all of these different aspects of the system that need to be maintained.
00:01:29.450 - 00:01:29.862, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:01:29.916 - 00:01:33.046, Speaker A: Thank you for that Kane Ernesta, would you like to cover Ave?
00:01:33.238 - 00:02:31.210, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. Hi everybody. For those who don't know what Abbey is, Abe is a liquidity protocol where people can supply assets to get deal on them or borrow them. And in general it's a pretty standalone running protocol, let's say in the sense that it doesn't need so, so much automation, at least in multiple points. But there are certain aspects, like for example the liquidations, where actually automation can improve the system by orders of magnitude. So another point is also like in certain parts where the computation are quite heavy and potentially it could be a rare architecture to introduce other parties that do some kind of automation to optimize the cost. Pretty excited to see how it's going to look the ecosystem like in the future with intervention of keepers.
00:02:32.830 - 00:02:34.670, Speaker D: Perfect. Thank you Peter.
00:02:36.210 - 00:02:53.346, Speaker F: Yeah, so for those who don't know, chainlayer is a node operator on the Chainlink network. We're also a staking service provider on a lot of networks. And I think Keeper for us enables us to do a whole lot of automation on things we now run in various crowns, various systems, and especially the.
00:02:53.368 - 00:02:56.180, Speaker G: Security aspect of it is amazing.
00:02:57.590 - 00:03:02.834, Speaker F: If you run a script that has to do something on chain, you basically need a private key somewhere.
00:03:02.882 - 00:03:11.750, Speaker G: You need to secure it with ledgers or difficult things. And with Keeper, that whole part of security is basically outsourced to the node operators.
00:03:12.490 - 00:03:19.334, Speaker F: We like to dog food chain link as node operators, and this is a perfect example of things we can do ourselves.
00:03:19.462 - 00:03:21.050, Speaker G: So, yeah, really excited.
00:03:22.670 - 00:03:23.750, Speaker D: Thank you, Peter.
00:03:23.910 - 00:03:25.600, Speaker A: Brenda, would you like to go next?
00:03:26.130 - 00:03:53.858, Speaker H: Yeah. Thanks, Anush. So I'm Brendan from pool together, and pool together is a prize savings game. So users deposit into a prize pool, interest accrues, and that interest is awarded as a prize. And so the prizes are awarded periodically. We use Chainlink for two things. One, the chainlink VRF to get a random number to select the winner or multiple winners.
00:03:53.858 - 00:04:23.040, Speaker H: And two, we need that reward triggered periodically. And in fact, it can be triggered by anyone. But as Peter said, we effectively need a cron job to run it. But what we can do now is have the protocol cover the cost of rewarding the transactions, because of course that needs to be paid for and have it managed all by Chainlink keepers. So it's a really effective system for us to be able to outsource that which we try to do as much as possible we don't want to run.
00:04:25.350 - 00:04:26.222, Speaker A: Understandable.
00:04:26.286 - 00:04:27.150, Speaker D: Understandable.
00:04:27.310 - 00:04:28.980, Speaker A: Max, would you like to go next?
00:04:29.750 - 00:04:30.500, Speaker G: Sure.
00:04:30.870 - 00:05:18.042, Speaker B: So Barnbridge is a risk tokenization protocol, meaning that we build applications that go after specific risks users in Defi are trying to alleviate or get more exposure to. We rely on chain link keepers primarily for our smart exposure application, which allows anyone to create a pool between any two assets, any ratio they'd like, that will constantly rebalance kind of around the parameters of that pool. So that might be 5% deviation from the ratio between the two assets on a daily basis. And when that deviation is triggered, a chain link keeper can actually trigger the swap necessary to bring things back to parity with the kind of established ratio.
00:05:18.106 - 00:05:18.890, Speaker G: Of the given pool.
