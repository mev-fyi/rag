00:00:06.890 - 00:00:16.526, Speaker A: Welcome to Chainlink Labs defi conversations on YouTube. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs, and I'm talking to Brandon Berguson from Moby. Brandon, how you doing, man?
00:00:16.628 - 00:00:20.634, Speaker B: Hey, I'm doing great, Andy. Glad to be here. Big fan of chainlink.
00:00:20.762 - 00:00:42.322, Speaker A: Awesome. Me too. I'm excited to talk to you. I used to work the fintech industry as well, and so I'm really excited to kind of connect this to payments and the wider ecosystem. And I think we've actually got a lot to talk about in terms of the connections between those two. So really excited and wanted to get into all of that over the next few minutes here. Tell us about Moby.
00:00:42.322 - 00:00:46.810, Speaker A: How does it work? What makes it special? What kind of sets it apart as a project in the crypto space?
00:00:46.960 - 00:01:37.530, Speaker B: Yeah, no, we started building Mobi a little over three years ago and really kind of set out for focusing on mainstream adoption. I saw the writing on the wall four years ago over when I started learning about crypto and blockchain, and I figured the biggest problem to solve was make it use for everyday purchases and easy to use. So that's kind of our core focus for Moby and Moby Labs. We're building mainstream products with blockchain technology, really around payments and rewards. So user adoption is a key component for us. So we're focused on that and essentially we put everything into one platform. So really kind of centralized, decentralized, custodial, noncustodial, and then a bridge to pass back and forth, really to kind of get people understand more about crypto in the long term.
00:01:37.870 - 00:02:04.900, Speaker A: So I think the lowest hanging fruit to put it in your brain with a payments platform is square or stripe. Square is an example where the business has square and they've got some unit where they can accept payments and they can do backend accounting and then it settles with their bank and that sort of stuff. Is that where Moby sits, or are you guys on the user side where I'm downloading, loading an app or both or somewhere in between all that?
00:02:05.270 - 00:02:23.914, Speaker B: Great question. We're actually both. We want to build an all inclusive system. So we have the front end user through the application, similar to Venmo cash app and PayPal. You can use it as a USD bank account. We're a partner with some banking partners here in the US. We're expanding globally here very soon.
00:02:23.914 - 00:03:09.894, Speaker B: So you can do all the same functionalities you can with those. You also. The big thing that we do on our mobile app is you can use cryptocurrency for everyday transactions, some of the biggest retailers. So we even have chainlink now integrated or link integrated into our platform and you can use at places like CVS. So that's great. We also, on the flip side, have a merchant platform for businesses so they can sign up for our business platform and then we have the payment gateway in between. So really, as opposed to some of the other platforms that are really crypto only, we're fiat and crypto, so mainstream and crypto users, grandmas, normal small, medium sized businesses all can utilize our platform on their front end application or mobile side.
00:03:09.894 - 00:03:15.862, Speaker B: Our web app for businesses and the gateway in between to facilitate the transactions.
00:03:16.006 - 00:03:47.906, Speaker A: Cool. A lot of the web, three natives, crypto folks who watch this stream, I don't know how deep they are in the fintech and payments ecosystem. And so something that was new to me a few years ago when I had joined is payments is its own industry. Like it's a full stack industry, top to bottom, hundreds of billions worth in company values and whatnot. Just in terms of how do businesses accept payments, how do customers enact and transact and send and verify payments? Who does that processing in between? And where does all the money go?
00:03:47.928 - 00:03:48.078, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:48.104 - 00:04:09.482, Speaker A: If you do a card transaction, that money gets split up into like 1000 different buckets. Everybody gets a percentage of a penny and all that. That's a really complex ecosystem. Crypto comes in. Right? Bitcoin is first. This peer to peer payment mechanism, I don't know if it's going to work like that. Maybe there's all these different payment options.
00:04:09.482 - 00:04:14.362, Speaker A: How does crypto fit into this wider payments industry and ecosystem?
00:04:14.506 - 00:04:44.678, Speaker B: Well, it streamlines it a lot easier and it really kind of takes all the middlemen out. Right. And that's the biggest thing is when we started building this, we need a more simple way to transact. We need to be instant and we need to eliminate all the middlemen. Right. So when talking about card processing, it's a huge business, but it's also archaic. And you have issuing banks and all these intermediaries, you have visa, Mastercard, so there's a lot of restrictions with that.
00:04:44.678 - 00:05:20.286, Speaker B: And what we did is we just built our own gateway, which we have instant payments. And that's really why we built initially on stellar, is because we wanted to settle transactions fast in both cash and crypto. And we want to do it in a way where people can get their money and they don't have chargebacks. And that's really kind of the key with crypto is you don't have a lot of the chargeback fraud. It's a massive thing that's plaguing not only the US, but everyone globally. And so how we built the system really streamlines the process for everyone, especially for the merchants. And at the end of the day, we reduce the processing fees dramatically.
00:05:20.286 - 00:05:48.634, Speaker B: Typically, we're about 1% for cash and crypto that we'll be launching, and that's about 70% less than the current card processors, which are, you said, 100 billion dollar companies that handle payments. So we believe we're in a great space moving forward for the cash and crypto. Like I said, Bitpay is just crypto only. Stripe is just kind of cash and car or just cards. We're both in between.
00:05:48.832 - 00:06:30.458, Speaker A: So I'm going to back up and cover some of the terms that you mentioned. So there's one here, it's processing fee. When you go to a merchant and you swipe your card to buy packed gum, the merchant has to pay however much it is, some percent of that transaction or some minimum transaction for that. And you'll go to some, like bodegas or whatever, and you'll see like, minimum transaction, $8, because they're not making any money unless it's over the count, because they got to pay for that. So a lot of that cost goes to the merchant. Now, the merchant's hands are tied because they have to have visa, Mastercard, or else they have such wide adoption. So that's sort of that processing fee there is like how the merchant deals with that.
00:06:30.544 - 00:06:48.430, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's typically around 3%, strives around 2.95, but there's also a percentage, and there's also a fixed fee as well, just depending on. There's so much. It's a very complicated system, and so we're trying to simplify that. And I think that we have.
00:06:48.580 - 00:07:01.538, Speaker A: Now, the other thing you said is chargebacks. This is something that merchants really have to do with, not just in terms of now they're losing a sale, the charge is going back, so they're losing the sale, but they've also got to do the accounting on this and they.
00:07:01.544 - 00:07:02.306, Speaker B: Got to manage it.
00:07:02.328 - 00:07:20.006, Speaker A: And just doing the books on stuff, on returns is a hassle. And at scale, you can do it because you can hire specific accountants that manage this sort of thing. But small businesses and one person shops, it's really hard for them to manage that charge. Max, can you talk a little bit about the industry and that problem? What does that look like?
00:07:20.108 - 00:07:51.794, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a 50 billion plus dollar a year problem. I think that was when we first wrote the white paper. It's significant. It's a lot of fraud. So people know that they can just buy stuff and then they can just charge it back. And merchants are required by a lot of these processing providers to keep their charge backs under 1%, which can be tough. And let's be honest, the merchants charging as being charged 3%, but the reason that they're charging 3% is because of bad actors, really.
00:07:51.794 - 00:08:28.814, Speaker B: It's probably like a 1% charge, but they have to build in all these extra percentage to cover the losses moving forward to be a profitable business. And that's really kind of where the inherent problem is, because visa and Mastercard require it in order to use it. They have reps and warrants, and basically they're in their contract saying that this is how this works, it's a problem. And that's what I love about crypto, is because it eliminates a lot of that, and really, it gets passed on to the end user. Right. These things happen. So they inflate their prices, they inflate their fees, and all that's kind of built in.
00:08:28.814 - 00:08:45.380, Speaker B: So we believe by reducing the processing fees because there is no middlemen, number one, we can get a lot more businesses to adopt our platform, but also we believe that'll be passed on to the consumer moving forward.
00:08:46.230 - 00:09:03.946, Speaker A: That's a huge. If you think something's free, it's not free, right? You're paying for it in some way. If you look at grocery, grocery is the super well known, thinnest margins in the world. They make very little profit because they can't. They got to stay competitive. Food's got to stay fresh. It's a really expensive business to be in.
00:09:03.946 - 00:09:26.350, Speaker A: And so if you can reduce fraud, if you can reduce chargebacks on something, it's really a great value proposition. And grocery will listen a lot of other industries as well. But that's just one highlighted as an example. We're talking to you because you've integrated Chainlink, you're using Chainlink. Talk about how are you using Chainlink besides the link token there? But on the technical side, how are you using Chainlink and Webby?
00:09:27.190 - 00:09:49.746, Speaker B: The initial and primary use case for us is the market data feeds. We have a payments application, a wallet. So we want to make sure our price data is top notch. And Chainlink is by far the industry leader there. So we utilize it across all of our different platforms. We have multiple different products in our ecosystem. We've been in building mode.
00:09:49.746 - 00:10:24.846, Speaker B: We're getting ready for launch mode right now. So the data feeds and the market feeds will be used in not only our wallet, but our bridge, our swap, and everything else in between. So really that's the core feature. We're also going to be utilizing the chain link into our bridge protocol that we're building as well. So interoperability for different blockchains and stuff is going to be a key component for our web three side of Moby labs. And so, yeah, we plan on using Chainlink, really in all of our products and services that we provide throughout the ecosystem.
00:10:25.038 - 00:10:49.114, Speaker A: Cool. The model you talked about how this works is. So I've got my Mobi account and I've got crypto on there, or dollars, whatever it is. And when I go to make a payment, I can choose, I want to use bitcoin for this payment. Then on the back end, are you guys selling the bitcoin, converting it into dollars and then depositing? How does that work? Because that conversion, that's where you're going to use chain link.
00:10:49.152 - 00:10:49.306, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:49.328 - 00:11:00.554, Speaker A: What's the price of bitcoin? Okay, make sure you get the right price so that it's worth this dollar amount. But what are the steps look like there? Is it a conversion on your end and then it goes through a bank or who's involved?
00:11:00.682 - 00:11:25.026, Speaker B: Yeah, you nailed it. That's exactly what we do. So the user will walk up to the store, they're like, great, I want to use, know, whatever bitcoin or link. Right? And they choose it, they'll actually accept the price, which will be obviously coming from you guys. And then we settle in US dollars in the background. And that's why our retail relationships that we have. No one really wants to accept cryptocurrency.
00:11:25.026 - 00:11:53.140, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of people will now with bitcoin, but it wasn't the case when we started building three years ago. Right. So we're like, well, how do we fix this problem? Well, we have a built in exchange, an app, so that settles in US dollars into our merchant's USD Moby bank account. So realistically, you know, we have a setting in the platform. If you want to just receive US dollars only, we convert it automatically for you, for the merchant, so they don't have to worry about it. So the front end user will determine what currency they want to use.
00:11:55.110 - 00:12:00.980, Speaker A: Why don't retailers want to just accept crypto natively? What are some of the barriers there?
00:12:02.710 - 00:12:38.794, Speaker B: The unknown. A lot of retailers live in fear, and these are major corporations that have boards and risk tolerances and things like that. But it really comes down to the volatility. As you said, these are companies that depend on their books to report to Wall street, and they're looking at their bottom line. And if they get payment for an asset, let's say, in bitcoin, and all of a sudden it tanks, they're not really in a position to hold because they're not mandated to do so. So that's really kind of the barrier of entry. But we see that changing with the more adoption.
00:12:38.794 - 00:12:54.690, Speaker B: We see Tesla, we see other companies paying their employees in bitcoin and stuff like that. So I think that we'll see that change. But for now, we don't really care how they get paid. They just want to be settled in US dollars because that's the gold standard, supposedly.
00:12:55.990 - 00:13:12.950, Speaker A: Again, I think about that back end, that accounting piece. If you're accepting crypto in 20 different cryptocurrencies, and at the end of the day, you got to balance your books on that, that's a nightmare. You got to hire a whole staff. And if you're actually scaling that up to look, it's just not feasible.
00:13:13.110 - 00:13:14.086, Speaker B: It's not feasible.
00:13:14.198 - 00:13:30.110, Speaker A: That's going to be worth the hassle. And now you got to go into regulatory because nobody's doing that. Instead to convert it and accepted dollars and be that way. Now maybe a company wants to, on their finance side, get into bitcoin or whatever they want to get into. That's a separate thing.
00:13:30.180 - 00:13:58.114, Speaker B: That's a separate thing for payments. Exactly. If it's a treasury thing, that's a totally different thing, because then they pay on the capital gains and whatnot. But for a payment protocol, it's like, hey. And that's really, really, for my opinion, the reason we built Moby and Moby coin and whatnot is really to facilitate payments. And we believe that that's what crypto and bitcoin was always intended to be used as a payment currency. Right now, it's more of an investable asset.
00:13:58.114 - 00:14:11.398, Speaker B: But we believe that if you can make it cheap and settle fast, people use it as a currency. And that's really what we're out to do, to democratize it as much as possible and make it use for everyday transactions. That's our primary objective.
00:14:11.494 - 00:14:24.430, Speaker A: I'm very much a middle grounder where maybe full decentralization and using some super decentralized dogecoin or whatever it happens to be as a currency is possible. But I don't know that we're there yet as a globally wide standard.
00:14:24.500 - 00:14:25.102, Speaker B: No, we're not.
00:14:25.156 - 00:15:02.990, Speaker A: And so we need some steps in the middle and part of that is meeting people where they're at. Letting people use banks and look at centralized exchanges. That's what they do is they let you use your bank and get in and get involved in that way so you don't have to go fully dex and decentralized right away. You can, you can do those options, but having a lot of those steps in the way, that's kind of where I see if people want to try and use it as a currency, as money, dogecoin or ether, bitcoin or whatever, people are welcome to do that. When you're engaging with these larger enterprises, you want to go buy curtains or whatever it happens to be. Kind of got to meet stores where they are, too, because they've got costs as well.
00:15:03.140 - 00:15:20.606, Speaker B: Yeah, just to touch on that. I think that's where we give people options. Right, cool. You want a custodial or you want noncustodial. You want centralized banking, or you want to go on chain off chain. I mean, really, it's just you have to give people two options. And for us, that's been our core objective.
00:15:20.606 - 00:15:42.010, Speaker B: And then you have to have a bridge to pass back and forth like, hey, cool, this is easy. Now I want to get into more decentralized stuff and activity. That's great. But if you're going to force people to go into one or another, they're going to just stick what they're used to. And that's where the barrier of mass adoption, I think, is. The primary barrier is. So for us, that's a key component.
00:15:42.590 - 00:16:02.394, Speaker A: One of the other major topics you brought up in your first explanation is it's also a rewards platform. I know rewards and loyalty points are a major part of fintech and how that works. Can you talk a little bit about how that works in Moby? How is it different from other rewards platforms, or how is it similar? Maybe in the spirit of the things we just talked about, what are some of the similarities, too?
00:16:02.532 - 00:16:50.554, Speaker B: Yeah. So for mean rewards is key, and making it simple rewards platform for American Express points is people are used to points. And so for know, when we kind of started to imagine, know, three plus years ago, it was, okay, well, great. These are kind of what they call closed loop reward systems. So American Express points only works at American Express places. So really when we created Moby Coin, it facilitates payments to the stellar network, but also as a rewards currency that they can use to do different type of incentives. So we just launched Moby Earn, which is our new kind of encompassing rewards ecosystem that has in app staking one off rewards for action based items we have on chain staking.
00:16:50.554 - 00:17:33.830, Speaker B: We have all these different things to really kind of teach people, okay, how to use the platform, what is cryptocurrency? And also reward them for shopping on the platform. So really, incentives is everything. But you have to be very, I would say, very intentional and understand the economics behind it because you have, I would say, a universal rewards token that can be used. That's okay. You're getting these points, or aka tokens, and then you can have them spendable. Where are they spendable at? How much is the value of that? And so there's a lot of thought that goes into it. But our business model, or core business outside the crypto is we reward people, giving them cash back on cash.
00:17:33.830 - 00:18:03.794, Speaker B: So what we do is, for instance, someone is not a crypto enthusiast. They download the Mobi app, they link their bank account or their debit card, they go to CVs, and they spend cash. Right? Just like they do in Venmo. We actually give them 2% cash back on cash right now. So people are getting cash back on cash. This is not cash back on a debit card or credit card that they're paying 9% an interest on. Someone's reaching back in the register, and we're giving out of our profitability, we're giving that as an incentive.
00:18:03.794 - 00:18:33.150, Speaker B: So that's kind of the core differentiator between us and everyone else is the user adoption strategy. And then if they want to accept Moby coin or other assets, then there'll be a multiple of that cash back, and they'll be incentivized to hold and utilize it within the ecosystem. So it's a big component because we just live in this day and age where people want discounts, people want rewards. That was a key component of building a mass adoption platform, is the rewards component.
00:18:33.570 - 00:19:04.342, Speaker A: Awesome. Now, every tech founder answers this question, wants to answer this question with the answer, everybody. So I'm going to ask you about your users. So, yes, everybody, of course. But as you start this rollout phase, you're really launching out who is that first core set of users? Where do you see you're going? Who's going to be the most interested in these projects? And then on the business side, on the merchant side, who are these? Are they smaller businesses? Are they these larger retailers, like vehicle size? What's sort of your range on both ends of that spectrum?
00:19:04.486 - 00:19:54.646, Speaker B: Yeah. So our core user base, out of the gaze, is like the millennial users. Young understands technology very well, I would say kind of gaming gamers that really understand virtual currencies really well. So that's kind of our target demographic is that area. On the user side, we have kind of a ten year plan, five year plan, and how we get there and the next one comes in is really the underbanked, as people have less access, so those cash back rewards will mean a lot to them, and they have easier access. And then we get to the unbanked later on down the line. People in developing countries that have access to a cell phone, but no access to banks, that's kind of our long term goal.
00:19:54.646 - 00:20:50.060, Speaker B: But we want to start with the core business, which is around millennials. And then for the business side, really small, medium sized businesses, we have a go to market strategy. Our first kind of target is direct sales companies, network marketing companies, other ones that we solve a big problem because of chargebacks. They're more high risk for merchants, which is huge, but they also bring users to our ecosystem, which is a big thing. So you can have a company that sells products, which they can sell in our app, because we have an inapp marketplace, they can sell their products, they can transact without chargebacks and without issues, and they also can do their payouts to their people monthly. So that kind of all encompasses is a big win for us. And just small, medium sized businesses, merchants, restaurants, moving forward, they're all going to want.
00:20:50.060 - 00:21:20.882, Speaker B: We did one event and we got 250 merchants signed up on the event, just on one talk, right? It's a no brainer for them. Like, wow, I can save money on my processing. I can actually accept bitcoin. I can get access to marketing and other in app functionality. I go, this is a no brainer. We don't replace their current car processors. We just provide another gateway.
00:21:20.882 - 00:21:26.520, Speaker B: So it's not like they're choosing one or another. We're just adding a service to them. So it's a win win.
00:21:27.610 - 00:21:37.500, Speaker A: That's compelling. That's a great story. So I want to wrap this up. I can talk payments and fintech all day, and you can too. We'll have to get together.
00:21:37.950 - 00:21:39.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that, man.
00:21:40.190 - 00:21:46.606, Speaker A: But what's next for Moby? You said you were in build mode. Now you're in rollout mode. What does the year look like for you?
00:21:46.788 - 00:22:36.414, Speaker B: Yeah, so just last year, we got our mobile app out on the App Store for both Android and Apple, which is something not easy to do. It took us a good amount of time to do. So we're still in beta testing. We're updating a lot of stuff on the mobile app side and we're gearing up for a primary public launch in Q two of this year. So we're just kind of in build mode right now, just kind of refinement product market fit, making sure we have all the core functionality that we need to. Right now our focus is international rollout. We're just testing in some US states right now, but we do plan on doing international rollout so in the next month or so.
00:22:36.414 - 00:22:58.502, Speaker B: So that's kind of where our focus is now. Q Two is going to be a big one for us. That's where we're kind of going full steam ahead on marketing initiatives, onboarding users, merchants. We already have 350 plus large retailer partners that you can utilize our app at point of sale. Not all of them rolled on the app yet.
00:22:58.636 - 00:23:01.350, Speaker A: What regions are most of those retailers?
00:23:02.570 - 00:23:27.886, Speaker B: Just in the US, but we will be expanding globally. But you're talking about some of the major brands. Landry's restaurant, CVS, Ulta. We have some cool stuff on YouTube. We have some great guys in the community that go out to DSW and use bitcoin to buy shoes with our app. And it's, see, we see it. It's working and that's the good part.
00:23:27.886 - 00:23:54.200, Speaker B: Now it's just kind of getting everything geared up to that final push and we have one chance to do this right and so we're extra cautious. Last year was a lot with compliance audits, making sure that we're good to do what we're doing and we're very excited about it. This year is going to be a great year and we're really excited about Q two.
00:23:54.570 - 00:24:11.978, Speaker A: Brandon, it's been awesome talking to you. Thanks for coming to chat with me. We're learning all about Moby. And for the users out there, go check it out, use the app, give them some data points so they can do that final setup before their big launch. I will talk to you another time, man. Let's do a follow up. All right?
00:24:12.064 - 00:24:13.546, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll do great, man.
00:24:13.568 - 00:24:14.126, Speaker A: Nice talking to you.
00:24:14.148 - 00:24:15.070, Speaker B: Thanks, Andy.
00:24:16.370 - 00:24:34.050, Speaker A: Well, he's going to hang out here while I talk to you for a sec. Thank you for watching. If you are interested in Moby, head down to the description.
