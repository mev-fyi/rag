00:00:00.410 - 00:00:07.760, Speaker A: Personal corner is for the athletes, body athletes, for the influencers. Body influencers is all ran by us.
00:00:11.170 - 00:00:31.746, Speaker B: Hi. Welcome to a special episode of Chainlink, NFTs and gaming. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs. Today I'm presenting a recent conversation I had with Des Bryant from Personal Corner. Des is a former wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys and other teams in the NFL. Well, and he created personal Corner to help athletes launch their own NFT projects and engage with fans. It's a great conversation.
00:00:31.746 - 00:00:59.760, Speaker B: We're also joined by Trayvon Diggs, a current cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys. Prepping for the playoffs, but taking time to come talk to you, the Chainlink community, along with Des, about the launch, about what he sees in the NFT community, about NFTs and the fan experience. This session starts with me talking with Trayvon about his experiences and understanding of NFTs. And then we get into personal corner with Des a little bit later in the session. It's a great session. Stick around for it. Thanks for tuning in.
00:00:59.760 - 00:01:06.346, Speaker B: Well, it's awesome to have you on, man. So you've got playoff games coming up, but you're taking a minute out to talk NFts.
00:01:06.458 - 00:01:10.530, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll take a little second know before I lock in fully.
00:01:11.430 - 00:01:14.610, Speaker B: That's awesome. I appreciate that. When did you get into NFTs?
00:01:15.190 - 00:01:17.538, Speaker C: Probably about six months ago.
00:01:17.704 - 00:01:19.300, Speaker B: What pulled you in, man?
00:01:19.610 - 00:01:41.562, Speaker C: Des had told me about it and was just like, you got to get into this space. So I just know looking at it, when I first started to start looking at YouTube, like, what is this? What is so confused? And I was just watching hours and stuff. Just keep watching. I was just asked if can't explain this to me, and he explained it to me. And ever since I just been locked in on it every day, I want to know about it.
00:01:41.696 - 00:01:56.500, Speaker B: How do you understand it? I think about it like, tickets, basically, they're digital tickets, but it's not a ticket to an event. It's a ticket to whatever you want. It could be absolutely anything. So is that kind of how you formulate it or you think about it more as collectibles or what's kind of in your brain, man?
00:01:57.750 - 00:02:21.034, Speaker C: I feel like it's more just ownership, and it's genuine, it's organic, it's from the source. So it's like you really get to interact with your fans. You get to interact with people that want to be involved with you. You get what I'm saying? You just create a dope little atmosphere, dope community. That's always good. Just to have love around you. Real support, genuine support.
00:02:21.034 - 00:02:30.250, Speaker C: So just people supporting each other and just giving back to them and just showing them I appreciate them for supporting me and we can interact.
00:02:30.750 - 00:02:55.490, Speaker B: One of the things I've noticed before, I really got any NFTs, I don't have a lot, but I got a couple is I didn't really get the community aspect of it. I didn't get that thought. Like, okay, it's a piece of art, it's a PFP, whatever it happens to be. But once it kind of unlocks this, it's like a club you're in. Anybody can join the club. But once it unlocks that club, because it has value, maybe, or perceived value, there's this different dynamic that goes on or something.
00:02:55.560 - 00:03:25.150, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%. Like the different communities, the different types of things you could be involved with. Whatever you're interested in, you definitely could find, and you definitely could be involved in it. So I feel like it's just organic and people just want to be involved with that. You get what I'm saying? So everybody's here for the same thing, everyone's here for the same goal, and it's just organic. And I feel like that's important because, no, I don't have no fake relationships, fake friendships. If this feels real and it feels, like, organic, that's dope.
00:03:26.850 - 00:03:50.200, Speaker B: I'm going to ask you a tough question, a broader question. Do you think with COVID in the past couple of years and people kind of locking in and being alone, do you think these kind of relationships are even more valuable now? Maybe this kind of kick started at where people are finding that these relationships are really important. Was that some tinder for the fire or was it just going to be amazing no matter what or somewhere in between?
00:03:50.730 - 00:04:09.350, Speaker C: 100%. I feel like that helped it because now you're getting into things that you're interested in. Obviously that person is interested into it. So you have similar qualities and things that you all like so that create a little friendship. And it's cool. It's cool. You do different things, like different metaverses.
00:04:09.350 - 00:04:15.182, Speaker C: You do whatever you want and it's just real and it's just organic. I feel like that's important.
00:04:15.316 - 00:04:18.462, Speaker B: What is metaverse to you? Metaverse means a lot of things to a lot of people.
00:04:18.516 - 00:04:26.000, Speaker C: I'm curious. To me, I feel like it's your own world. Whatever your world is, whatever you want it to be is your world.
00:04:26.530 - 00:04:51.402, Speaker B: I like that. I like that a lot, actually. I see des creeping around in the back. You can join us. We're just hanging out. We're just kind of getting loose. Trayvon, while I have you here and we're kind of going, what are your NFTs going to look like? What are they going to do? What do you envision for this experience as you start thinking about launching your own with personal corner? We've just had this announcement in the past couple days.
00:04:51.402 - 00:05:00.806, Speaker B: Congratulations. That's amazing launch. But Trayvon, what do you kind of envision this being for your fans, for your experience, for your legacy?
00:05:00.998 - 00:05:28.114, Speaker C: I feel like it's just like a gateway to interact with me and for me to really be able to have that genuine friendship, that genuine relationship with people that genuinely care about what I'm doing and how my career is. So it just gives me the opportunity to give back to them for supporting me and just being there for me. I feel like that's just know because you're getting it from the source. Anything that I'm doing is coming from me, not coming from nobody. Like, it's not fake, it's all real. So I feel like that's know.
00:05:28.232 - 00:05:48.460, Speaker B: Do you have a sense of who they are? Is it people who are just football fans? Just people? Are Dallas fans or Bama fans or is it just anybody who's followed you forever, your friends and family? Because it seems like it's this wide ranging thing, a lot like collectibles, but in this different area. Have you thought about who they are or found out who these folks are?
00:05:48.910 - 00:06:02.400, Speaker C: I'm curious to know. I'm curious to know who's been following me, who's been really supporting me. That's really going to show what it is. And I know for sure it's going to be special to them because it's special to me.
00:06:02.770 - 00:06:34.586, Speaker B: That's a really interesting response, actually. You basically said you want to find out who is deep, who's really deep into your legacy, into that experience, and it's a way to show right to really prove what that is. Are you thinking about. I know Des has had some events and some different sorts of perks for people who hold his collectibles. Are you thinking anything like that? You don't have to give specifics yet, but what excites you about being able to provide for a group in this way?
00:06:34.688 - 00:07:00.480, Speaker D: I'm so excited to see who I really can interact with and who I really can give, what I want to give to. And it just means something to me. And you get to have a piece of me because I'm sharing something that means so much to me with you. If that makes sense. So the things that, how Des has his setup, mine's going to be similar to that and just giving back. I'm going to give you all a part of me for supporting me, if that makes sense.
00:07:02.050 - 00:07:32.926, Speaker B: Are NFTs like locker room talk? Is it just a around the league everybody's talking NFTs because the stories came out a couple of years ago of some guy, I can't remember who it was, started taking a salary in bitcoin, and then a couple of people start getting ad deals and sponsorship deals and stuff like that. But now nFts are coming. Des, you've been talking about NFTs for a long time now on Twitter. I follow you as well. But is this well known and more understood? And athletes, maybe not just NFL, but athletes in general are really figuring out this is a way to connect the fans and do that.
00:07:33.028 - 00:08:03.000, Speaker D: I know in my locker room it's still sort of new, but everyone's interested, so everyone's trying to know what it is. And it's kind of like hard to explain unless you really take the time to really go out there and gather information to know. So it's like a little new, but I do my best just to try to explain as much as I know to them so they have an idea and then go from there. But it's definitely like a hot topic if you smart. That's you talking about NFTs for sure.
00:08:04.170 - 00:08:22.926, Speaker B: Des, what do you find now? You're a year and a out of the league, but now you got all these young guys blowing you up about NFTs. Are you finding the same thing? Is it just everybody trying to figure out what's the lay of the land? How do I deal with this and how do you explain it? This may be another question. How do you explain it to your former colleagues up and coming people?
00:08:23.108 - 00:08:51.474, Speaker A: Well, I look at it from a little deeper aspect because I'm on that side of ownership. I want these guys to own what they put out because you can get blind with the glitz and glamour, man. Everybody want an NFT. That's what's going on. Everybody want an NFT. I'm coming from the aspect, okay, you can want the NFT, but do you own that NFT? That's the side that I sit on. I want to educate.
00:08:51.474 - 00:09:19.230, Speaker A: I want to give examples. I want to go through it step by step. I got my team, I got my lady here to help me put these thoughts out, put them on paper and get them to these guys because I just think it's important for us to understand not only what we can do with an NFT, but how we own the intellectual property of the NFT. That's where I'm coming from.
00:09:19.380 - 00:09:57.286, Speaker B: I'm a former professor and I used to study sports communication as well, teach class and publish a little bit. So I love this topic. And one of the things that kind of comes up is, especially in conversations, athletes are historically really unprepared for ownership, for the responsibility of a huge paycheck, for the responsibility of, well, now you've got real estate, property, or whatever it happens to be, and then also unprepared for. Well, after you're done with sports, what do you do? How do you maintain a business in that way? Is personal corner trying to address this, like trying to provide these options for athletes both in and out of sports?
00:09:57.478 - 00:10:11.760, Speaker A: Yes, sir. Andy. That's exactly what's being created. Nfts, that's just one thing. That's just a hot topic right now. Personal corner can be anything. We want to create a sanctuary for us.
00:10:11.760 - 00:10:38.530, Speaker A: We want our own and we want fans. We want people who follow us to know exactly who we are. We want to provide what we need to provide to take care of ourselves while playing the game. And whenever we're done with the game, don't want to bring this up. It's important to bring this up because other athletes need to hear it. Sometimes. Athletes don't see it right now.
00:10:38.530 - 00:11:12.178, Speaker A: They don't see the end. They don't know that end will come. That end comes for everybody. And you need to be prepared for it. And I'm just thankful that God kept me, blessed me with some sense that I have left to be able to understand this space and just put something down here for these athletes, not only not myself, but us collectively build this group and just put our ideals in and just build this sanctuary for us.
00:11:12.264 - 00:11:26.114, Speaker B: Give me a 30,000 foot overview. What is personal corner? The news just dropped a couple of days ago. I've been reading a couple of these stories. I'm with chain link labs. And so, of course, you guys are using Chainlink data feeds to do dynamic NFTs. Amazing use case. I'm super excited.
00:11:26.114 - 00:11:44.960, Speaker B: Ready to geek out about that as well. And you're a chainlink fan as well. I know you got chainlink socks and everything. You helped refuse out. I got a cool little shirt today, but I love it. Tell us a little bit, what is the idea behind personal corner and this launch? What's the next couple of months looking like? As you guys really get moving?
00:11:45.410 - 00:12:20.970, Speaker A: Well, I would like to say this personal corner is for the athletes, by the athletes, for the influencers, by the influencers. It's all ran by us. And like I said, right now we in phase one, series one, we just putting out things that's related to the influencer. If that's football, we're going to start off with series one. Football, series two. Just give you a little example there. Just basically, series two will be something you might never knew about that athlete.
00:12:20.970 - 00:12:50.610, Speaker A: Like I said, it's more than just an NFT project. I want this to become our life. I want us guys to adopt a new way of handling business on and off the field. I just feel like everything belongs on the blockchain. It's transparent, it's organic, there's no line, there's no under the table shit going on. It's. Yeah.
00:12:50.760 - 00:13:14.438, Speaker B: Well, that's awesome. I'm really excited. So, dynamic NFTs powered by Chainlink, of course. That's one of the reasons we're talking to you is this idea that if you got stats on an NFT, like think like a baseball card or a football card. Actually, I'll get back to this question in a minute, but I'm going to ask you if you collected as kids, because I did a little bit. Not very good, but I did a little bit. But think about having that card as an athlete.
00:13:14.438 - 00:13:38.146, Speaker B: Gets a touchdown, gets an interception, gets some stat, those updating dynamically, and so you actually have an updated record. This dynamic NFT is a really cool idea. We're starting to see a lot of examples of that. You, Trayvon, let me start with you. Did you collect anything as a kid? Like, kind of look for things that maybe had value, things that excited you, maybe they didn't have value. Maybe you're just like, into rubber bands or whatever, anything like that.
00:13:38.328 - 00:13:39.742, Speaker C: I used to collect cards.
00:13:39.806 - 00:13:44.420, Speaker D: I used to collect yu gi oh cards and baseball cards, football cards, too.
00:13:45.350 - 00:13:46.760, Speaker B: You had anything good?
00:13:47.930 - 00:14:00.040, Speaker D: I just always, to get my favorite players, I open a pack, see what players in there that I like, got the card that I wanted. So whatever liked whoever was hot, that was the card that I wanted.
00:14:00.490 - 00:14:14.830, Speaker B: I never knew who was hot. I just opened him, and my dad would be like, oh, yeah, he's good. Okay, I keep that. I just looked up, it's been a long time. I'm a lot older than I look, and I just looked down, like, who is this? I don't know why. Anyways, Des, what about you? Did you collect?
00:14:15.330 - 00:14:26.758, Speaker A: Yeah, I collected football cards, a little bit of Pokemon cards, just a little bit more. So football cards.
00:14:26.874 - 00:15:05.774, Speaker B: Cool. I just came across this idea a couple months ago at Basil in Miami. I was talking to an NFT project, and he was talking about really making active collecting possible. And it's the idea that I can collect, right? I can hold something, but with NFTs and with these communities, Trayvon and I were talking earlier about how a rich and vibrant community really sets NFTs a lot of NFT projects apart. Is this active collecting where there's this gaming type element almost to it? You look for these rare ones. They give you rare attributes. You get to go to maybe an event or get a collectible or do all those other things.
00:15:05.774 - 00:15:16.500, Speaker B: Do you guys think about active collecting in that way? Like sports collectibles? That's a long time industry. But this active element, have you guys put thought into that, in how you've designed this?
00:15:17.030 - 00:15:53.790, Speaker A: Absolutely. These influencers, they can provide the best utilities, and I feel like we proved that with personal corner. This is just the guideline. It's the blueprint. And I had bought a cowboy suite at the beginning of the year, and I wanted to provide value to the NFTs. I wanted to give the holders value. So what I did was I'm buying a suite up probably through the rest of my life to give that to the fans.
00:15:53.790 - 00:16:23.318, Speaker A: Come watch the cowboy game with me. Come watch Trayvon break all these records in the suite, turn up talk about NFTs and different types of giveaways with a select group of people. Like I said, that was just a small example of what utilities can bring to NFTs. If you ask me, it's limitless. It can go as far as you want it to go. And this is just the beginning of something special.
00:16:23.484 - 00:16:54.354, Speaker B: One thing Treyvin and I were talking about is when it comes to fans getting your NFT, it's a different kind of relationship with you, right. It's a fan that, you know, has invested significantly emotionally, like effort. You got to work to get these right and hold them. Is that something you see, especially these sort of higher end, hyper rare ones? I see your discord is popping up. I'm in there. Kind of been keeping an eye on things the past couple of days as well. Is that something you're noticing and really looking forward to interacting with these different kind of levels of fans in a different way?
00:16:54.552 - 00:17:42.990, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. We want to provide the best services. We want to provide the best services for them. Not only that, it's almost like a form of, it's an asset, and that's what we want to provide for the people who love us. How do we create the best value for the fans who spent a hard earned working money and also have an asset? So one day, if they ever need the money or whatever the case may be, someone can come in and purchase it from them just due to the value that the fan and the influencer provided to that token. So, like I said, that stuff right there can be limitless.
00:17:42.990 - 00:17:51.038, Speaker A: It is limitless. And my mind, it just goes and goes and goes and goes when I'm talking about this shit.
00:17:51.054 - 00:18:01.720, Speaker B: Yeah, man, I know. I do it all day. I was talking to Trayvon about what got him into NFT space, and he said it was you. Are you like the godfather? You like pulling people?
00:18:02.890 - 00:18:39.826, Speaker A: Know? I wouldn't necessarily say know. I'm just trying to do my, know, I'm an athlete. I walk those, know, I talk those, you know, some things that I experienced that I wouldn't ever want Trayvon to experience. And if we can get him and a lot of other guys early and still include myself to adopt a new way of thinking, especially with the opportunity NFTs and a blockchain provide. Amen. The sky's the limit. We can create those things that can protect us for the rest of our lives.
00:18:39.826 - 00:18:56.120, Speaker A: We can create that generational wealth we can give to those fans who truly love us. That value can just continue to circulate amongst all of us. So why not keep that in house?
00:18:56.810 - 00:19:21.306, Speaker B: This idea of ownership off the field is really like. It keeps echoing in my head. I think that's such a compelling concept because like I said before, earlier, it's a challenge historically in sports for athletes to get a hold of their contracts, right. You don't always know what you're doing in your contract, but you can get a hold of this. Here's something that came up. This is a question that you don't have to answer if you haven't thought of this. I'm a college sports fan.
00:19:21.306 - 00:19:41.542, Speaker B: I was telling Trayvon, I love college sports. Michigan State, I'm a go green guy. But the name and image and likeness stuff the past year for college sports has just came out. Now, all of a sudden, for these really young guys, they've got opportunities they haven't thought of before. Have you thought about this? And interacting with college athletes in any way?
00:19:41.676 - 00:19:46.374, Speaker A: 1000%. Yeah, we already own it.
00:19:46.572 - 00:19:47.734, Speaker B: All right, cool.
00:19:47.932 - 00:20:10.542, Speaker A: All we did was Trayvon, myself, and a lot of other guys. I won't reveal their names. I'll let them do that whenever they're ready. But we got a lot of guys come and we got a lot of guys that we'll be announcing. This is our pioneer group. We just want to set the tempo for these young guys. We want to lay out that blueprint, that roadmap, and show these guys this is how you do it.
00:20:10.542 - 00:20:26.660, Speaker A: And we do this as a collective group and really just dominate this space and just be collaborative with everybody, with all of the good people inside of the NFT space. I feel like this space is meant to be collaborative, but you got to do it with the right people.
00:20:27.270 - 00:20:52.720, Speaker B: On that note, what are some of the projects that you guys have been inspired by? I know you've got a board ape. You're inspired by that community. What are some of these other projects you've seen you like? Whether it's art or the community or just, like, something weird about it, there's some that are just weird that I just like as well. But what about you guys? Trayvon, let me start with you. What are some of these other collections that kind of get your senses tingling, get your imagination going?
00:20:54.210 - 00:21:26.966, Speaker D: I see a couple that I like, but I haven't bought one just quite yet. But I have had a few sent to me, but I haven't bought one just yet because I'm still learning about everything. I still want to make the right choices and decisions. I just don't want to be doing anything. So I'm still reading about it. I'm watching them, just watching how their community is, the things that they like, because I just don't want to jump into something just because it's hot or just because I actually want it to mean something. I actually want to be a part of it and feel like I'm a part of it because that's how I'm going to have mine set up.
00:21:26.966 - 00:21:40.058, Speaker D: Like, you're really going to be a part of it. This is really going to feel like a community. So I like to see, wait and see. I don't want to do anything based off of this. Oh, this is hot. I'm going to go do it. I want to do it because I actually want to do it.
00:21:40.224 - 00:22:17.202, Speaker B: That brings me a lot of confidence, actually, because that's one of the fears I have, people jumping into the space, not knowing what they're doing, and they just go after a hot thing, and who knows what that is. So to hear that you're going through that, thinking thoughtfully as you then build your own, that means it's going to be an experience where people should be able to go through that and make a smart decision on their own. But let me ask you, because you're interested in some, you don't have to have bought any, but are you more interested in PFPs? Are you interested in games? Are you interested in original art? Where are you sort of pulled collectibles, athletes collectibles, things like that? Where does your heart sort of tend to take you? I'm just curious.
00:22:17.346 - 00:22:28.106, Speaker D: I like the art, the art side of it. Those are really dope, how people just so creative and coming up with all these different things, those are really cool. And that would probably be the first thing I'm going to buy a piece.
00:22:28.128 - 00:22:29.146, Speaker C: Of art for sure.
00:22:29.248 - 00:22:41.680, Speaker B: That's awesome. That's good to know. Des, what about you? What kind of collections have inspired you that you look at as you kind of build out personal quarter and think, oh, some element of this I got to do. What's kind of spoken to you?
00:22:42.450 - 00:23:28.398, Speaker A: I was in the board apes back midsummer and I had got a couple of board apes, so I would say board apes. And I like lazy lines too a little bit, but I'm like Trayvon. I've supported projects and then it got to a point to where a lot of projects were just rinse and repeat. And as I educated myself more and more and more and more and more about it, it gave me that confidence. And like I said, we was already wanting to provide this service for athletes, but just to see what was going on in the space, I was like, man, we got to go. We got to attack this thing because we know exactly what we're doing. We know what type of utilities that we can provide.
00:23:28.398 - 00:23:51.350, Speaker A: We know exactly what we want to give to the fans. And I just think it's real simple, it's a simple concept to grasp of what we're doing with personal corner. I had laid off of just, I won't say I laid off supporting projects, but I just laid off just purchasing.
00:23:52.010 - 00:23:53.880, Speaker B: Projects, just aping in, right.
00:23:55.530 - 00:24:24.606, Speaker A: And I actually understand what the board apes were doing. Like I said, I was in that game early and I took a little bit from those guys and added on to what we wanted to do for PC. That's about it. I love the community. I love all the communities who are here grinding and passionate about their projects, by the way.
00:24:24.788 - 00:25:09.182, Speaker B: Yeah, it's amazing to see. I love those communities come on as well. Some of the stuff that always kind of piques my attention is like you guys, it's almost like a ticket to experiences with athletes, with you personally and your public Persona and how you're going to interact with folks, but there's all sorts of different sort of versions of those tickets. So I've seen some where it's a group of people who are building software and if you own the NFT, it's a pass to that software. It's like having a pass to Adobe suite or whatever it is for this particular software. Other ones, G money and the punk comics and those sorts of things, right? There's all these sorts of different, really elements that are really interesting. Board apes with events, right? I've seen them, a lot of those in merch and all that sort of stuff happening.
00:25:09.182 - 00:25:12.800, Speaker B: And now TV shows, man, the list really is going on.
00:25:14.050 - 00:25:31.334, Speaker A: It's crazy, Andy, and I want you to notice, too, this is just series one. This is just series one. That's it. With the tickets, the utility. It gets deeper than that, you'll say. It gets way deeper than what we're doing for the athletes. I really do want to provide more info, but I feel like I can't right now.
00:25:31.334 - 00:25:49.798, Speaker A: We're going to have to save this for another session. But I'm telling you, when series two drop, we might need to get back on here and talk about that, too. I'll be giving you too much game if I jumped into what we're really trying to curate.
00:25:49.974 - 00:26:07.140, Speaker B: I always got too much game. It's all right, fellas. It's awesome to have you on. I don't want to keep you too long. We've had an amazing chat. I feel like I really have a sense of what personal corner is, what you guys are building. I'm excited to help, just be a part of telling that story.
00:26:07.140 - 00:26:11.698, Speaker B: Is there anything you kind of want to leave us with as you start thinking?
00:26:11.784 - 00:26:41.450, Speaker A: I would say this, when you see these projects, when the fans see these projects, they are owned by the athlete. All of the athletes that's on the personal corner is ours. We created that. You would know that. All the utilities that we bring, that's directly from the athlete, you would know that. And I will leave it there. I'm on some revolutionary, let's get it athlete type shit.
00:26:42.290 - 00:27:07.582, Speaker B: All right, we're going to get together offline and we're going to have it out and we'll do some revolutionary thinking together because I'm on the level with you, Trayvon. I expect what's coming up for you is the playoffs. You got some work to do, you got some film to run. I heard you just coming over to play some Madden and hang out before you have to lock yourself away. So that's really cool. And I so appreciate you guys coming on, taking the time and talking to me.
00:27:07.736 - 00:27:09.430, Speaker D: No problem. Thank you so much.
00:27:09.500 - 00:27:10.470, Speaker C: Appreciate this.
00:27:10.620 - 00:27:11.720, Speaker A: Appreciate that.
