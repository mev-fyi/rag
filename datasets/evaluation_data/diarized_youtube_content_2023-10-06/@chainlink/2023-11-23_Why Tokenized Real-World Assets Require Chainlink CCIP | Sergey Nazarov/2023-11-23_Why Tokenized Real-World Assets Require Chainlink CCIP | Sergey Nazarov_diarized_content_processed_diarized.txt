It's actually also keeping that asset updated, whether it's on chain B, C, D, E, F, whatever chain it's on, so that it can remain what in the capital markets is known as a golden record, or what we commonly refer to as a single source of truth, or what people are going to be calling real world assets. Basically, you need the superior tokenized asset to remain superior because it's connected back to the real world, regardless of what chain it happens to land on. And that's important because if I take it to another chain and it loses the ability to get that information, it's not such a real world asset anymore. It's some kind of, like, surrogate promise that I don't really know what's going on with that asset. And so this is something that right now, only the chainlink network can provide because of the ability to provide the data as the largest provider of proof of reserves and price and identity and so on, and the ability to move the asset to other places, as well as the information related to the asset.
