00:00:00.890 - 00:01:14.194, Speaker A: And today I will do a demonstration of NFT that if you was in the hacker house, you already did with me. This is the cross chain NFT that we are minting an NFT from one chain to another chain. But we are creating this totally live now, using remix in a so easy way. When we talk about cross chain NFTs, what can I do with this? For example, imagine that I can have the same collection in two different networks and I can decide where my NFT is active now. So when we talk about NFTs and a collection of NFTs, each item in this collection has a number like an index. So index one now is active in chain one and is not active anymore in chain number two. For example, imagine that I was preparing an order that it was not so good.
00:01:14.194 - 00:01:59.346, Speaker A: Maybe next time I have an order that I changed the color. It was an emoji that was changing the color using the chain that I am. So I was in Fuji, I had a background in red. Then I was in seporia, I had a background in blue, for example, coming back like to reward and talking about this. The same NFT can exist in more than one chain. You can even manipulate this or manage this in your application. You can now create an application using this.
00:01:59.346 - 00:03:11.180, Speaker A: So your application, when you sell the NFT in one chain, you must do a process, a batch job, maybe using automation to sell the same, to transfer the same in the other chains as well. Or what about an NFT that can exist the same NFT in different chains with different owners. And at the end, if you have the NFT that was minted, you have like so amazing and you can win some prize with this can be so interesting. I may try to talk everything that I can without my presentation. I think you can realize this. So everything that I told you until now I can do using CCIP. And this is so interesting because when I talk about CCIP, maybe you hear about tokens and the transfer of tokens, how this is so easy.
00:03:11.180 - 00:03:59.180, Speaker A: But in the same way, what for me is the most important part, what I really say. Yes, I love this is the message part. Because when we talk about messages, about sending messages, I can send any kind of message. Yes, can be, for example, only a message like welcome Barcelona, welcome to smartcom 23. But this message can be a function like calling a function in another chain. And this is the concept that we are using now. Let's come back here.
00:03:59.180 - 00:04:38.818, Speaker A: Okay, this is me, you know me. We are talking about NFTs for minting an NFT from one chain to another chain. Let's see if it is working. No. And before do the demonstration I will come back a bit to what I changing in NFT. When I doing this kind of managing NFTs in this way I'm changing the metadata. Basically we used to say that we are changing the attributes.
00:04:38.818 - 00:05:16.286, Speaker A: So this is any NFT. And when I change the metadata I can do this like off chain have some link to a new metadata. Or I can do this on chain and on chain I can really write inside my smatch content a new json file that this kind of file. This is a json file. I can write this in a different way with different attributes. And this is the main goal. And this is when I am updating the metadata.
00:05:16.286 - 00:05:46.790, Speaker A: I can update the link or only the image or everything. Now I'm here. So I was talking about this. I was talking about the messages part. So to do this, what I must do we are starting in the sender blockchain. Our sender blockchain, our Cersei blockchain will be fuji. So I create a contract.
00:05:46.790 - 00:06:13.730, Speaker A: Maybe I will use that. I create a few minutes before. I will not create it again. Okay. But I have a contract that is prepared to send the mint command to the other chain is this. And it will be sent to the person to the account who is sending the transaction. Is this part my contract is going to the outer of CCAP.
00:06:13.730 - 00:06:43.870, Speaker A: On the outer I must say what is the message mint. And the destination chain will be sepolia. Then let's go to this side of the world in the destination blockchain. I have another hauter that is receiving this message and it is already in the right blockchain. So the message is my contract. My destination minter. And I have the comment mint to the NFT.
00:06:43.870 - 00:07:06.486, Speaker A: So this message is going to my contract, my receiver. This is our goal. Now let's see if you can do this. Okay. Oh, this is the documentation of cCap. You can go later. And here we are.
00:07:06.486 - 00:07:28.582, Speaker A: And to understand what we have here is the NFT that I did some minutes ago. My collection of NFTs. You can see that I have four NFTs I can refresh again. Okay. Four items in my collection now. Good. I will use this collection.
00:07:28.582 - 00:07:56.130, Speaker A: Okay. And then who is minting this NFT? The destination minter. Here we are. Here is the destination minter. So this is a contract that is minting the NFT for myself. And you can see here that I have a default function from CCIP. If you are using CCIP to receive a message.
00:07:56.130 - 00:08:28.960, Speaker A: You must have this underscore CCIP receive function. And here I'm using the address of my NfT calling the message and the message is saying mint an NFT is this. Let's do it. But remember this is receiving the message. Who is sending the service minter. This is the minter. So I have another contract here prepared to send this message.
00:08:28.960 - 00:08:51.080, Speaker A: This is deployed on Fuji. I deployed five minutes ago. And then what you do now? Are you cow the mint on sepolia function on Fuji. And then we must wait some minutes to see this happen. The other side. Let's do this. First of all, I have no idea where I am.
00:08:51.080 - 00:09:26.062, Speaker A: I must be on Fuji. No, I am on Sepolia. Let's go to Fuji. Yes, now I am in Fuji. This is the surf cementer. Oh, by the way, how am paying the fees to do this? Imagine that I'm paying fees in the destination chain. How me doing this? I'm paying in the Cersei blockchain and I can calculate using the Cersei blockchain and I can pay use the nativity token or use link token.
00:09:26.062 - 00:09:54.890, Speaker A: For example, I use link now. But here for example, you can see that I'm getting the fee in the other site, in the other chain. Okay. Is this mint sepolia? So I'd like to be sure that I have a link in my contact. I have this link balance. Copy my address put here. Yes, I have three and something.
00:09:54.890 - 00:10:31.800, Speaker A: I'm good. So good. Mincho Sepalia. Is this what I just did? I create a transaction on Fuji using running calling the function mint on Sepolia in my contract that I deployed some minutes ago. And the CCIP network you get in my transaction in some minutes. Let's see, my transaction is confirmed. I can come here, copy the transaction ID.
00:10:31.800 - 00:10:58.682, Speaker A: And we have the CCIP explorer. This is the explorer. This is so amazing because if you add some transaction here, you can see this transaction wherever the chain. If it's a CCAP transaction, you can see this. Here we are. My transaction is here. You can see that the Cersei chain is avalanche Fuji.
00:10:58.682 - 00:11:58.270, Speaker A: The destination chain is sepolia and the surface finalized. What happened? Now I must wait because we are waiting that this is really confirmed. It's not enough to be on block but it must pass some amount of blocks after the block that you deploy it to be sure that the network doesn't have or nothing that can change this to be really permanent to the utengs now. And here you can see like the destination gas how much I may send into the other chain and some information. In a few minutes. I will have here the destination transaction hash as well. And it's committed.
00:11:58.270 - 00:12:13.090, Speaker A: Oh, at least it's changing the status. I'm happy. Let's come back here. Oh, I don't have more message. Let's come back here a bit. So here we are. I already single transaction.
00:12:13.090 - 00:12:55.330, Speaker A: In that point the outer found my transaction. And the outer now is managing this using including our security network, our Hisk network. So we are waiting out of these parts now until the outer send my message to my receiver. And let's see. Abs maybe not committed to committed coming back here in my contract. Let's see what I have to you here. I am in the service contract.
00:12:55.330 - 00:13:21.718, Speaker A: What's interesting for you? I'd like to go here. I forgot to show this part. This is the supported networks part. So if you are doing something. When we talk about CCAP, we talk about lanes. We must have a lane from one chain to another chain. For example, if we go here, you can say that from Fuji I can go to Sepolia, to Gurley on optimism.
00:13:21.718 - 00:13:52.246, Speaker A: To Sepolia Ethereum or to Polygon Mumbai. Each of this is Alani. If I am for example on Mumbai I can go to Sepolia or to Fuji. And you can see all the cross that we have here. For each lane or for each chain I have a selector, I have a number. That means that this is the chain that I'm using. So I had this.
00:13:52.246 - 00:14:09.946, Speaker A: When I was on Fuji. I defined that my destination chain selector was sepolia. Like this. I got all the information here. Let's come back. It's too committed. We must wait a bit more so I can talk more here.
00:14:09.946 - 00:14:32.210, Speaker A: Great. So for each of these, what can I do? First of all it's important to know that you have the different howter. So here is the outer on Fuji. In the same way this is the howter on Sepolia. Here. Here is the howter on Sepolia. Like I said before, we have different chain selectors.
00:14:32.210 - 00:14:51.430, Speaker A: I'm paying using the token link. But I'm paying the token link on Fuji. Not sepolia like in my destination chain. This is interesting to you to see. Because my destination chain doesn't have nothing. Let's see. Sepolia test iterisca.
00:14:51.430 - 00:15:22.206, Speaker A: Where is my contract? My contract is here. And if you go here on the iterisca sepolia. You can see that my contract has some transactions. But doesn't have any token nothing. Balance is totally zero. Because I may pay in the other chain. But I think this is not the last concept.
00:15:22.206 - 00:16:00.522, Speaker A: Let's see. It's too committed. Okay, I have some minutes. By the way, do you have any questions? I have time because you are waiting and I talked most apart before. Okay, I'll come back here a bit. I'd like to talk a bit more about this. So how can I change some information inside an NFG directly? Like I told you before, let's show you some examples.
00:16:00.522 - 00:16:29.942, Speaker A: And let's show you some different examples. I think I have some here. Cross meta here. Here for example, it's another option of this cross chain NFG where I have the chains. And also here you can see that I'm updating the information inside my concrete. I'm sending that. I'm changing the JSON exactly here.
00:16:29.942 - 00:17:14.870, Speaker A: Saying that it's active in one chain and the surface. Like I minted this from Fuji or I minted that from Mumbai. I'd like to sing the destination chain. Who was the chain that asked me to mint this? This is another option that I was working now I told you related to building SVG. SVG is a kind of image that we can have. Like it seems that it's a text but in the way it's an image. And here I was changing the back color of my image and created this related to the color of the surf or the destination chain.
00:17:14.870 - 00:17:40.480, Speaker A: So this is some examples that you can have it. Oh yes. Now I can see. Remember how many NFTs I had in my collection before? Do you remember? Four. We must have five now. Yes. Here, Vash, we have five now.
00:17:40.480 - 00:18:16.226, Speaker A: Wow. So good is this. So I just minted one Nft from one chain and the NFT appearing the other chain using CcAp. And this is what I'm really exciting about this. And for me this is the future. Because if you can mint NFTs, you can call any functions in any other contract and imagine how much you can have in value and unlock the future using this. This is my presentation.
00:18:16.226 - 00:18:17.060, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
