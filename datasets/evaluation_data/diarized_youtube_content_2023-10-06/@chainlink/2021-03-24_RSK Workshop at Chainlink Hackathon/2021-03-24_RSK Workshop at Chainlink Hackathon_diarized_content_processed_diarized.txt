00:00:01.770 - 00:00:47.694, Speaker A: Press the magic button. Press the magic button. Awesome. Welcome, everyone. Really excited to have you here on week two of the chain link hackathon. Really excited to have Solange Guillerros from the RSK team today telling us all about how RSK is able to connect different smart contracts to the bitcoin network. So if you have questions throughout this, definitely drop them into the YouTube chat, definitely join the RSK channel on the Chainlink discord server, and we'll be monitoring the chat.
00:00:47.694 - 00:00:56.520, Speaker A: So feel free to drop any questions that you have in there and then we'll be able to help those. Solange, thanks a lot for joining us. Really excited to have you.
00:00:56.970 - 00:01:06.650, Speaker B: Oh, thank you, Kenan. I'm very happy to be here. And today we are learning how to use the chain link with RSK.
00:01:07.630 - 00:01:11.660, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, really excited. And yeah, I'll let you take it away.
00:01:12.270 - 00:01:40.414, Speaker B: Okay, so here we are. A bit about me. I am from Sao Pablo, Brazil, and I am a developer for more than 20 years, won some hours in hackathons. I love the hackathons. ETH, New York, Berlin, Denver. I miss ETH Denver presidentially. And here in Brazil.
00:01:40.414 - 00:02:24.690, Speaker B: I'm so glad because I am in the list of top 50 persons, the coin, telegraph, and the most important. I am a developer advocate on RSK iovlabs, so it's not a long workshop. We are here to understand what is RSK and how to get the prices using chainlink, Oracle using remix. It should be very easy. You create a new smart contract to do this. So about RSK, I love RSK because for me, it's the best of bitcoin and Ethereum. I work with Ethereum since 2017.
00:02:24.690 - 00:03:23.790, Speaker B: I am a developer. I love to do smart context. And when I found RSK, I love with these two, because RSK is based on bitcoin. So I have, like I said, the best of the two words, because I have the power of the Ethereum with smart context, and in the same time I have the bitcoin hash power. So we have a lot of security in this environment. And what is RSK? RSK is based on bitcoin, but it's like a second layer from bitcoin where we have the smart context and we can do exactly the same things that we do with Ethereum, and we have the applications and the users like this. We have also infrastructure framework, the HIF.
00:03:23.790 - 00:04:20.020, Speaker B: And the chain link is linked with this part, with this layer of infrastructure. So like I said before, RSK, for me it's like Ethereum because we can use the same tools we use with Ethereum, like Ethereum developer. So remix, truffle, open Zeppelin Explorer, gas station wallets provider, web3 metamask. Today we are using Remix and metamask. It's so easy. But a bit more about this bitcoin measured mining. Think that more than 50% of the bitcoin miners in the same time validating the RSK blockchain.
00:04:20.020 - 00:05:19.370, Speaker B: And it's like this, they have a software, his nodes can do both. Another important information, it's about the two way Peg bridge, because to have RBCs, you can have bitcoins and lock your bitcoins to unlock the RBCs and use them in the RSK blockchain to work with the smart contracts. And you can do the other way too. So about Chainlink and RSK. Here I have an overview. What is the chainlink? The structure of the oracle. But in fact, today we are seeing only this part.
00:05:19.370 - 00:06:01.844, Speaker B: So we are creating a smart context to communicate, to request the job for the content, for the chain link oracle. It will be this not so complicated. So let's do it. I create this collaborative path to put some information for you. And this will be available during all the hackathon. I'm going out the presentation. And here we are.
00:06:01.844 - 00:06:30.136, Speaker B: I have just opened it here. Yes. So I put the information here for us. Okay, so like I said before, we are using remix. So go to remix and I'm putting all the links here. I am here in remix. Just now I need to connect to RSK.
00:06:30.136 - 00:06:55.104, Speaker B: So this is an important step for you. This connection is very important. Let me find it here to send to you. Wait a minute. Here we are. So I have this. No, this is the remix.
00:06:55.152 - 00:06:55.750, Speaker A: No.
00:06:58.280 - 00:07:34.360, Speaker B: Here, wait, here we are. We have the instructions to connect metamask to RSK network. I did this before, so I have this connection to the RSK testnet. Let me show you here. If I came here in the. I can do in another way here. So network name RSK Testnet.
00:07:34.360 - 00:08:02.510, Speaker B: This is the URL, chain id, the symbol tRBC. And the explorer is this. It's done. It's very easy to do this. And here we have the instructions. So it's here too. So why you put the remix down? Because in fact we need first to do this part.
00:08:02.510 - 00:08:43.528, Speaker B: So what we are doing is. Wait a minute. Yes, what you are doing, we go to if you don't have metamask. I think it's the persons have metamask now. But we can go here and have metamask too. So first we need to install metamask and then you will configure the metamask RSK testnet on metamask. So this part is done.
00:08:43.528 - 00:09:26.232, Speaker B: Then I came into remix. I am in remix and I will fetch my remix to do with you. So here we are. And I suggest you to came here and turn on the outcompile, it's very useful. And also came here in the deploying run transactions and connect the environment to your metamask. We are using the injected editory. So these are connecting to metamask.
00:09:26.232 - 00:09:51.110, Speaker B: You can check it now I have the custom 31 network. This is the RSK testnet. This is my account. You can check it here. The final, it's 79, seven nine, 1.41 TrBCs is the same. So I'm sure that I am connected in the right place.
00:09:51.110 - 00:10:25.920, Speaker B: So I come back here, and now since yesterday, remix have workspace. I create a workspace for chain link. You can use anyone, doesn't happen, doesn't matter. And I will create a new file for us. So it will be. No, not a workspace, a file. It will be the chainlink RSK.
00:10:25.920 - 00:11:09.950, Speaker B: So here we are. We have the file chainlinkrsk. So. And what I do here, I have this done before. So I will send the information for you. One important information is this, because I show you that I have arbitcs, but maybe you don't have to start the process. So copy your address, came here to the faucet and put your address.
00:11:09.950 - 00:11:49.900, Speaker B: He's over the captcha before this, you can go here and go to the faucet first. So I am the faucet. I don't know, here, I think this is easy. Yes, this is easy for me. So you get some albitcs from the testnet. Okay. In the faucet you can do this process once a day and a bit difference between Ethereum and RSK.
00:11:49.900 - 00:12:28.100, Speaker B: Ethereum, the time of the blocks in Ethereum it's about 15 seconds, but for SK it's about 30 seconds. It's not like bitcoin ten minutes, but it's not like ethereum with 15 seconds. So we have 30 seconds to have a transaction mined in RSK. Here we are. I have my first transaction. I can see here in the explorer, I receive 0.5 arbitcs on testnet.
00:12:28.100 - 00:13:02.920, Speaker B: Great, this part is done. Come here. And now we are good. So I have some examples here. Iu copy and paste in the new file and also how you copy and paste for you here, because you can do this alone. And Jesus, here we are. So I'm using the solidity 0.6.7
00:13:02.920 - 00:14:09.900, Speaker B: before I was importing the aggregator in V three interface but this is old implementation on testnet. So because of this I'm using the aggregator interface. Ode this is not the last interface, this is an old interface. Okay, I put this for here too. Yes, before this you put some heiferings here so I may base it on this code sample but I adapted it for us. And also you can check some context reference. RSK is not here until now but you can get the information about RSK in our own developers portal here.
00:14:09.900 - 00:14:38.244, Speaker B: It's about the chain link here. Okay. And this is the information about the testnet. This part is done. I come back here, I have my smart content and I like to explain a bit more for you about this. So this is the old aggregator interface. No problem.
00:14:38.244 - 00:15:31.760, Speaker B: This is my smart context. So my smart context is called price consumer. I'm using the aggregator interface to have a price feed. I'm using this interface in this address because this is the address of the riff BC oracle in the testnet. Okay, so in my constructor I may define in the price feed using the aggregator interface on this address. It's only this, it's very easy. Then I create my own function get lasted price where I'm returning the last response.
00:15:31.760 - 00:16:14.436, Speaker B: So this is the price that I'm looking for. So this much content is done. It's very easy. If we have some doubts I can look in the chat, I have two screens, I'm presenting one, I'm looking the other so I can answer for you in any time. Okay? And it's time to publish this. So I came here to the fourth item icon injected webbitories. Remember that you need to be connected in your metamask using the custom network 31.
00:16:14.436 - 00:17:12.110, Speaker B: Look here, this is the RSK testnet, okay? And here I need to select my price consumer content. It's not the aggregator interface, it's the price consumer. I deploy this on testnet just now. Here we are, I'm deploying my smart content and we need to wait about 30 seconds again and remember we are here. My smart contract is calling the chain link oracle using the aggregator interface. We are doing this part, okay, so I come back, we are situating a bit, no problem. And it's done.
00:17:12.110 - 00:18:10.050, Speaker B: My transaction is confirmed. I put my address here, you can use if you liked. So if you'd like to use my deployed address you can copy it and you can go here in a mix. Use the price consumer in the add address. If you put the address here you have another copy of the same instance deployed on the testnet. So the next step is to call the function. So I came here, you get the latest price and this is the price.
00:18:10.050 - 00:19:04.812, Speaker B: I don't think this is the real price, in fact, but it's not a problem because this is the testnet. We are only doing tests. And my goal is to show you how to do the same that we can do on coven, for example, this is done. And to be sure that you can do this in any network. I do this in covent too, only to show the difference. So I can create the chain link. Coven and I have here the same smart contact, almost the same, but in coven I'm using the aggregator V three interface.
00:19:04.812 - 00:19:49.964, Speaker B: This is newer, and this is the address of the coven. And it's almost the same. And if I come back here, change my metamask for coven here, it changes too. I can deploy it on coven also. So in a few minutes, we have this transaction on coven. I would like to show my transaction on Explorer too. I forgot to do this.
00:19:49.964 - 00:20:55.016, Speaker B: So this is my transaction on the RSK Explorer. We can go here. This is the smart context, okay. It's created on this transaction and I can put it here, here, deploy it on coven two to understand what I did in coven is exactly the same, not the same address, but the same process. And if I come back here, this is the last that I did on coven. So I put here to you to test. And for the coven, we have another smart content is the chainlink covenant.
00:20:55.016 - 00:21:50.896, Speaker B: And this is the Chainlink coven. So you can copy and paste this for your own computer and do everything alone by yourself. So this is the covenant. Get the last price. I have a very different price. And you can say that the Ethereum with USDC, it's costing $1,727 is this okay? And in the same way here we can have 586 satoshis for one reef. This is the meaning of this.
00:21:50.896 - 00:22:22.600, Speaker B: Okay, so I show you how to do the same process in RSK testnet and in Covent testnet. Because the process is the same. We are in networks that are very similar. And I think it's this. I will come back to my presentation. Where is this here? Come here. Presentation.
00:22:22.600 - 00:23:07.050, Speaker B: We did the hands on part. It's very easy. Do you have any questions? I can see the chat just now and how you can learn more about here. We have some useful links for you. Oh, not here, not here, not here. So you can learn more about the RSK. And in our slack we have a channel for this hackathon, we are over there, connected all time to his over to respond your questions.
00:23:07.050 - 00:23:42.550, Speaker B: Also I have some tutorials about RSK and this is the developer portal which I show you before. And also we have some tutorials on YouTube and on Twitter. Twitter. To have some information what I did here. Okay. And what more. So I talk about a bit about me and this is, I think we are done.
00:23:42.550 - 00:23:49.030, Speaker B: So if you have any questions, let me know.
00:23:51.980 - 00:24:06.780, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Solange. Really appreciate you coming on here. Let's see if there's any questions in the chat. Doesn't look like it. There's one in Spanish saying thank you and saw you do your talk with Polkadot.
00:24:08.640 - 00:24:10.300, Speaker B: Hello, Ronaldo.
00:24:11.200 - 00:24:36.752, Speaker A: Yeah, well, this was great. I really appreciate you walking through this. Anyone who's listening in, if you have questions, definitely hop into the Chainlink discord. Go to the RSK section. They got a whole wide variety of prizes. We'll also be doing an AMA together on Monday. So yeah, keep an eye out on different things that are happening between Chainlink and RSK.
00:24:36.752 - 00:24:45.400, Speaker A: Got a lot of exciting stuff coming out, including very soon being able to use this live in action.
00:24:46.460 - 00:25:10.290, Speaker B: Yes, it will be a great announcement. I'm so excited about it. And one comment, Ronaldo is saying in the chat that I talked about Polkadot a few days ago and Polkadot exploded. And he hoped that because I'm here talking about chain leak, chain leak go up too.
00:25:12.660 - 00:25:30.500, Speaker A: That's funny. Yeah, well, yeah, no, I'm really excited too. It's great working with your team. So really appreciate you taking the time to come share with us and yeah, I guess one question, how do we get more female developers like yourself being able to come and code? How did you get into coding?
00:25:32.520 - 00:25:36.970, Speaker B: Yes, sorry, like I didn't understand.
00:25:38.220 - 00:25:45.448, Speaker A: Do you have any advice or recommendations? How did you get into coding yourself and how do you think we can get more females coding?
00:25:45.544 - 00:26:24.490, Speaker B: Yes, well, it's important to study. You need to study a lot. We need to read a lot and participate on the events. I think hackathons is one of the best ways to learn because it's very intensive. We have always contact with different person from different places with different knowledgement. And for me, the hackathons make the difference. So this is a great hackathon and I hope that all persons that are here are enjoying it.
00:26:25.260 - 00:26:46.720, Speaker A: Yeah, I love hackathons for self too. And I think that brings up a great point. One question that just popped in from jer. Thanks for the info. What software did you use to create the smart contract. Is this in solidity? Is it in node Js or what's RSK built in? All EVM, right?
00:26:46.870 - 00:27:05.584, Speaker B: Yes. Two points here in the workshop. I only create a smart context on testnet using remix. It's only this. But RSK, we have the RVM. It's the RSK virtual machine. It's like the Ethereum virtual machine.
00:27:05.584 - 00:27:39.730, Speaker B: It's built in Java in the beginning. And I particularly use exactly the same things that I use on Ethereum. So I'm using truffle, I'm using Hadhat. It's not completely compatible just now, but it's useful too. I use node JS, react to do some front end. It's the same. It's exactly the same.
00:27:40.100 - 00:27:50.212, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, I think that's what's so exciting about RSK, using all the same tools that you know and love on ethereum, and you're being able to bring.
00:27:50.266 - 00:28:27.680, Speaker B: Yes, I remember something important to show because we know that we are suffering about the gas prices in Ethereum. And I put this here in the end because to understand why RSK can be useful and important, because the cost is very different. Like here we have that we need, wow, $4 to do a basic transfer in Ethereum, and we need seven cents to do it on RSK just now.
00:28:27.830 - 00:28:28.530, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:29.060 - 00:28:38.448, Speaker B: So this is very different. And you can have the same ecosystem in Ethereum under RSK. So it's amazing.
00:28:38.614 - 00:28:55.444, Speaker A: Yeah, that's absolutely incredible. I'm glad you showed this to put it in perspective. And now that's like a big hindrance for a lot of new people coming into the space. And as we get bigger and bigger, more people come in. Yeah, it's going to be a big deal. So awesome. Solange.
00:28:55.444 - 00:29:19.490, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for taking the time and really appreciate it. Again, if anyone has questions, definitely hop into the channel when you're working on your projects. Definitely tag chain link into your GitHub repos. We'll be having the midway checkpoint coming up, actually tomorrow. So you're halfway through. You're very close. I'm really excited to see everything that you all are working on.
00:29:19.490 - 00:29:37.350, Speaker A: Got one quick question that just came in from thoughto. Can we have an introductory to expert level on this with certifications? Is there like classes of RSK or anything out there also on the Internet, like different resources that you recommend?
00:29:37.880 - 00:30:18.100, Speaker B: In this week we launched the academy of RSK. Is this. I put this link in the chat too. This is our first class in academy. And here we have courses for developer, but this is for beginners. We have only about wallets and create your first match content. What's blockchain? But we are doing advanced modules too and in the end can have a certificate and this certificate will be on blockchain.
00:30:18.100 - 00:30:48.012, Speaker B: One thing about the RSK academy that I'm very proud of this is because all of the manage of this course is using smart context, so they shouldn't subscribe to a smart context. Then they shouldn't create your own smart content and submit to another master smart content. So it's all decentralized and in the end you have a certificate in the blockchain too.
00:30:48.146 - 00:30:48.830, Speaker A: Wow.
00:30:50.480 - 00:30:54.380, Speaker B: And I launched this on Monday so I'm very proud of this.
00:30:54.530 - 00:31:12.276, Speaker A: Congratulations. That's awesome. Cool. Well, yeah, there you go. There's a certification for you thought of if you want to, want to hop in. Great. Yeah, we'll drop all these links into the Discord channel that we've written down in this doc and then yeah, reach out if you have questions.
00:31:12.276 - 00:31:51.100, Speaker A: Otherwise, excited to see what you have built and we'll see you on the next stream. Also, one last final thing is that we put a few more workshops and different events on the calendar. Patrick has another one tomorrow with a bunch of different data providers showing you how to integrate those data providers. We'll be doing a workshop with Filecoin and IP Fs on Friday, so if you have more questions about how to use those, we'll be doing a workshop on Friday and then we got a couple of really cool amas with some of the data providers and some of the other teams coming up next week, including RSK. So definitely stay tuned for that one. Really excited and yeah, we'll see you on the next stream.
00:31:51.760 - 00:31:53.724, Speaker B: Yes, see you around, guys.
00:31:53.842 - 00:31:54.440, Speaker A: Thanks, Vlon.
