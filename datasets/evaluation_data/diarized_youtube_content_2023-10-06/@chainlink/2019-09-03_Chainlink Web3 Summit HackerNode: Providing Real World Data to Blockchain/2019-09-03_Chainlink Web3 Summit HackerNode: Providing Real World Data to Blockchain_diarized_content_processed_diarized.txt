00:00:09.820 - 00:00:10.608, Speaker A: So we are having.
00:00:10.694 - 00:00:11.136, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:11.158 - 00:00:13.120, Speaker C: We are having Geico, we are having wonder data.
00:00:13.190 - 00:00:14.690, Speaker A: We are having Jessica group.
00:00:20.580 - 00:00:27.296, Speaker C: I guess the best way to start this panel is for everyone. We can get started from there.
00:00:27.398 - 00:00:29.600, Speaker D: Yeah, very basic.
00:00:30.220 - 00:01:08.028, Speaker A: I wonder if the neighbors are. I think you'll be fine. All right. So, hey, I'm Henry, co founder and head of the Streamer project. So what is streamer? Streamer is a peer to peer network for real time data streams. So my favorite one liners to explain streamer to a technical audience, which I assume this audience is that it's a decentralized pub sub message program. You can also think of it as a global decentralized time series database.
00:01:08.028 - 00:01:59.540, Speaker A: Or if you will, it's a bit like pete torrent, but for real time data streams instead of static files. So basically a data source can publish messages to topics on the network and they will magically be delivered to all the subscribers listening to that topic. And these interacting parties could be like iot devices in a smart city. They could be web browsers using a Dap. They could be oracles seeking to deliver that data to an on chain smart contract. Also on the screen, right, goes to showing there's a marketplace which is a means to monetize the data that is being produced. So if you're producing something that's valuable to others, you can put it up for sale.
00:01:59.540 - 00:02:33.900, Speaker A: And we also have a toolkit called Streamer Core, which is actually being officially launched today. Yeah, thank you. Always good to ship things. Basically that's like a toolkit where you can easily create integration, you can build analytics, visualizations, you can get your hands dirty with data and manage little stuff in the same place. So that's pretty much the pitch reamer criteria.
00:02:34.640 - 00:02:52.576, Speaker B: Andrew from chain link for putting this together. Basically we are inviting everyone right now.
00:02:52.598 - 00:02:53.570, Speaker A: Our main product.
00:02:55.780 - 00:02:59.816, Speaker B: There. We are joining right now if they.
00:02:59.838 - 00:03:01.770, Speaker A: Want, if they want to join products.
00:03:03.900 - 00:03:24.930, Speaker B: There are five projects. And by leaving the weather data sitting here for some time. So that's functionality. Return.
00:03:27.540 - 00:03:37.490, Speaker A: Quickly, introduce five projects. You can see the project yourself. You can also.
00:03:40.180 - 00:03:42.400, Speaker B: Submit additional documents.
00:03:45.540 - 00:03:45.904, Speaker A: Once.
00:03:45.942 - 00:03:46.848, Speaker B: You'Re ready to get everything.
00:03:46.934 - 00:03:51.480, Speaker A: Production 24 name talk about Grace.
00:03:51.980 - 00:04:27.890, Speaker B: Free we can't for free we can't. But is that we've got many of these types of data depending on sports data provider. So the challenge, what they are proposing is like they want to track donations and they also mean.
00:04:33.400 - 00:04:40.644, Speaker A: Beforehand. I believe it's luxury for humanity, right? So this is the idea.
00:04:40.842 - 00:05:21.410, Speaker B: They also mentioned that. Okay, but what if it. So our ultimate goal is sort of available for each. And with the marketplace that's outstanding. We got rid of pain points that they're going to run into now. They don't have to go out and find native providers and find node operators that can provide the data and they don't have to deal with all the. We're hoping to do that for everybody else eventually too.
00:05:21.410 - 00:05:24.610, Speaker B: So again, thanks to Yolan, thanks to your team.
00:05:27.780 - 00:06:54.352, Speaker D: Hi everyone. My name is Robert and when I'm working with market data provider for financial market. So for several years now we have been collecting, creating and providing derived data for crypto, bringing market data to unchained smart contract. The first was with Chili. We're running our own node and also market data provider. Our whole query API with all our data is exposed micro payment transactions and get close eyes happening in the deFi space.
00:06:54.406 - 00:06:55.890, Speaker B: And that has been actually done.
00:06:58.580 - 00:07:04.060, Speaker A: If you say like visual.
00:07:04.140 - 00:08:11.208, Speaker E: Your name? I'm Trevor Clark. I'm with Amber data IO. We're actually a data provider that covers a couple different fronts. Similar to GeIco, we actually do cryptocurrency, market data as well as blockchain data. So we have a data pipeline that's fairly flexible, where developers can connect to our data pipeline and add all of the features that they're looking for for their application without having to run a full node or connect to multiple exchanges and verify those transactions and match them up with that market data. So if you look at how most people are building their applications, you at some point need to send a transaction. And so what we did is everything we build for you runs a node and you can sign your transactions, you can have your users not have to pay a fee or anything like that.
00:08:11.208 - 00:08:46.550, Speaker E: You can send that to our API and have the full context of market data. And then on the flip side, when you're serving your applications, it's much faster. So our access via RPC or websockets or rest services, all of that is just kind of one big package that streamlines your application. Similar to Keiko, we have full current and historical prices like VWAP, oh, TV order books, all of that available via websockets as well.
00:08:51.080 - 00:09:09.400, Speaker C: So I guess the question we could ask is, this industry is so new, right? There are a lot of horizons regulatory wise. So what kind of legal issues have you encountered by providing data blockchain? Want to go first? Legal ispanical framework.
00:09:10.220 - 00:09:10.970, Speaker A: Sure.
00:09:14.340 - 00:09:53.800, Speaker B: Want to be helping people build the contracts that enable all the DeFi applications, pool derivatives and insurance. But in many cases, the data providers themselves are often a little anxious. They come to us and say, we don't know who's going to be using, what they're going to be using. And of course, in the back of our heads we're saying that's one of the cool things. Got to get them on board. So then we'll work with them on these really onerous, know your customer requirements, or we're talking right now with a lot of authorized resellers. That gives legal protection, but it also increases.
00:09:53.800 - 00:10:37.176, Speaker B: And so all of these solutions have their own kind of problems right now. If you want to get a really top tier data provider on board, they need to know who the node operator is, they need to know who the developer is, they need to know who the end user is. And so now we have this wonderful, elegant system that can do all these cool new things. I think one of the things figure out from a regulatory standpoint is how to get sustainable, how to get some really tough, smart contracts, getting to the.
00:10:37.198 - 00:10:38.010, Speaker D: Level of.
00:10:41.740 - 00:10:52.860, Speaker B: Regulation that linked owner. So right now I'm a really organization working on industry wise.
00:10:56.640 - 00:10:57.390, Speaker D: Doing.
00:11:00.340 - 00:11:14.070, Speaker B: We should be thinking about that from a smart contract. Data providers wanted to work together. There's more information in the QR code. Again, more like.
00:11:18.360 - 00:11:19.072, Speaker F: Terms.
00:11:19.226 - 00:11:20.456, Speaker B: I think they would go hand in.
00:11:20.478 - 00:11:21.050, Speaker C: Hand.
00:11:30.780 - 00:11:44.670, Speaker F: Because in many ways the blockchain is transparent. Also, you could have these identity services and all that. You could implement all that with the blockchain. But of course, the question is.
00:11:48.260 - 00:11:48.576, Speaker B: I.
00:11:48.598 - 00:11:49.776, Speaker A: Think we're going to talk about sort.
00:11:49.798 - 00:11:52.544, Speaker B: Of privacy a little bit later.
00:11:52.582 - 00:11:58.116, Speaker A: But yeah, working in this case, I.
00:11:58.138 - 00:12:51.684, Speaker D: Could maybe add on to that a little bit. Just talking from the perspective of financial market, what we're dealing with, what we've seen is that there's not so much in terms of legal regulations, but there's a lot of self regulation from within the financial sector. Yeah. So when it comes to, we're like an engineer data provider, right? So we provide data from other data provider. When we're working with crypto exchanges, we don't have that much trouble there. It's usually very practical, collaborate with. But when we go to the older actors in the space, like index providers, companies like that suddenly have a lot of bureaucracy and rental things like that.
00:12:51.684 - 00:13:43.396, Speaker D: And I think there's a willingness from them to provide for people like our customers, but they're also having this internal framework, internal regulations that they have to comply with. So I think this will be solved both as talking to each other and trying to arrive at standards. I think a lot of this people aren't really aware of exactly how things work. So you have to kind of take the time to understand where they're coming from and talk to them about how can we align things that make sense. A lot of them will have control of how their data is disseminated. As soon as you put the data point on a public blockchain, it's out.
00:13:43.418 - 00:13:44.390, Speaker B: There in the public.
00:13:50.680 - 00:13:52.150, Speaker A: And developing that.
00:13:53.500 - 00:14:19.330, Speaker E: Yeah, just one tiny thing to add there. You said a lot of awesome stuff. Just to add on that from our integrations, a lot of their compliance is their side of the wall. So what we've done is made our APIs available to them. The way that they access that data is how that compliance, it has to be compliant with the access there. So we've just made that so that it fits their model as well. I'm sure you guys have done that as well.
00:14:22.020 - 00:14:38.144, Speaker A: From our point of view, the sort of legal hassles are a little bit different. And we're building a platform which is an open platform where anybody can put any kind of data on there. And we're sort of not a party.
00:14:38.192 - 00:14:41.252, Speaker B: In the transactions that happen in the ecosystem.
00:14:41.316 - 00:16:28.330, Speaker A: So if someone buys data, someone sells data, we're not a part of it in the same way as you guys are. So the considerations for us are more like how do we enable adoption, how do we prevent our users from stepping accidentally on some landmines in this jungle that is legal environment? And how to consider things like GDPR, for example, in the case of personally identifiable data. And what are our liabilities as creators of this technology, as opposed to those who put it there? Let's say someone publishes some illegal content, for example, on the streamer network. Are we somehow liable for that? Maybe in the current version, which is still partially centralized, there's still an element of us as the creators of this system, but especially when it goes towards decentralization, how can this work from a legal point of view? And this actually touches on all decentralized systems, and the current legal framework, such as GDPR doesn't consider decentralized systems at all. It's clearly aimed for the big giants who've several times been caught at abusing data and so on. So it's interesting to see what the future holds. Like, for example, if I post a transaction on Ethereum with, let's say, somebody's name and address and phone number, that's personally identifiable data.
00:16:28.330 - 00:16:41.230, Speaker A: I don't think all the Ethereum nodes are GDPR compliant. So does that make Ethereum illegal? Did I make Ethereum illegal by doing one transaction? Very interesting question.
00:16:42.080 - 00:17:07.060, Speaker C: Awesome answers. Okay, so I guess this question is more for CIC Group and streamers. So for API providers, we are more used to having monthly subscription, right? So you subscribe to an API for a monthly basis and you get the API price fees that you need, basically. So you guys went with a different pricing model. So maybe you could expand a bit on what kind of pricing model you're using right now and why you went this route.
00:17:09.660 - 00:17:33.404, Speaker A: Sure. So on the streamer marketplace, we do have time based subscriptions, but it's not bound to a specific period like a month or a year. Instead, you can subscribe for data for the period that you want. So the price of data is basically defined as price per tiny, like price.
00:17:33.442 - 00:17:34.444, Speaker D: Per second sort of thing.
00:17:34.482 - 00:18:24.556, Speaker A: So you can buy it for an hour or a week or a month, or a year or ten years or whatever you want. And this creates flexibility. Like in the old world, writing invoices, accepting credit card payments and settling everything is a hurdle. But on blockchain it's sort of trivial. So you can very easily create new kinds of patterns, even ones that are based on, let's say, data quantity instead of time, which is a very interesting prospect. But we went with the time based subscriptions for now for two reasons. One, it's familiar to people and data subscribers, and two, it leads to a fairly modest amount of on chain transactions that need to be made.
00:18:24.556 - 00:18:45.510, Speaker A: Like if you buy a product for a month, you will only do one transaction per month. Instead, if it was based on something else, that might result in a lot of transactions that would eventually be available in the current day blockchain. Yeah, I think one of the things.
00:18:48.520 - 00:19:46.650, Speaker B: APIs should be smart contract based world is that smart contracts are not currently and probably never will be particularly high volume or high call use cases where a sports market, whether thousands of thousands of calls a day, one or two calls from different nodes are completely unknown. To find out what X y at the end of the game, these are not the API trying to get as many ecological, that's how they make.
00:19:48.380 - 00:19:50.730, Speaker A: Financial data and they.
00:19:53.980 - 00:19:55.930, Speaker B: Organisms bring out people.
00:19:57.980 - 00:19:58.970, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:20:02.860 - 00:20:20.150, Speaker B: Through whatever percentage network charging, mineral mining and a relatively higher.
00:20:21.400 - 00:20:23.812, Speaker A: Surface coming into these indigenous people.
00:20:23.866 - 00:20:49.240, Speaker B: The standard that we've seen across premium providing that's the benchmark currently expensive system like a smart contract. So we're going to pay connection, give us greater.
00:20:51.340 - 00:20:56.592, Speaker A: Space. When they're not, we have no idea what they are. So I was in Korea last year.
00:20:56.646 - 00:21:01.628, Speaker B: And I started operator perspective.
00:21:01.724 - 00:21:09.040, Speaker A: They last photographer into the API operators.
00:21:14.740 - 00:21:22.410, Speaker B: Photographs of medicinal data sort of like that decision. This is how many points.
00:21:29.420 - 00:21:31.640, Speaker C: More data and GEICO.
00:21:33.900 - 00:21:34.924, Speaker B: If you had to guess.
00:21:34.962 - 00:21:46.110, Speaker C: Or maybe you have an how much of the current that are being brought to the RPI are used by smart contracts. Then how do you see this number changing in the near future?
00:21:50.720 - 00:21:51.710, Speaker A: And then.
00:21:53.780 - 00:22:01.572, Speaker E: So we actually look at several blockchains so we can see those analytics overall for us we get nice.
00:22:01.626 - 00:22:06.320, Speaker A: Breakdown network where we can see individual addresses plus contracts.
00:22:06.480 - 00:22:19.496, Speaker E: For us. If you went through our dashboards today it would show you actually like 54% worth contracts and the rest of the network was addresses itself. We're actually pretty new to the chain link setup but we're still watching the.
00:22:19.518 - 00:22:21.656, Speaker B: Chain link network analytics which is really.
00:22:21.678 - 00:22:25.720, Speaker E: Exciting to see that grow. From our perspective it's still pretty low.
00:22:25.870 - 00:22:27.844, Speaker A: Compared to all contracts.
00:22:27.972 - 00:22:37.760, Speaker E: It's roughly less than 1%. So that's something that we're like hey, let's see if we can encourage that growth there because we really like this interaction.
00:22:38.100 - 00:22:40.416, Speaker A: And the amount of data that you.
00:22:40.438 - 00:22:43.612, Speaker E: Can get from a chain link contract.
00:22:43.676 - 00:22:47.164, Speaker A: Is actually awesome because you can aggregate.
00:22:47.212 - 00:23:01.524, Speaker E: Those prices historically it now becomes something like an aggregator contract that people can look back historically, which is something that you can do and validate your logic over time. One of our use cases is people.
00:23:01.562 - 00:23:04.260, Speaker A: That are doing arbitrage bonds.
00:23:04.780 - 00:23:19.820, Speaker E: They actually like to run the historical data set and then test their assumptions and take that back on chain. You can actually do that now with the Oracle contract, create a marketplace for those aggregators.
00:23:21.920 - 00:23:25.310, Speaker A: They told me a story about when they went yeah, we have actually.
00:23:28.080 - 00:23:34.770, Speaker D: Usage of I think it may have.
00:23:39.300 - 00:23:48.240, Speaker A: This cautious will receive.
00:24:14.660 - 00:24:15.792, Speaker B: Because we didn't actually.
00:24:15.846 - 00:24:17.250, Speaker A: Know what.
00:24:19.300 - 00:24:20.176, Speaker B: We knew some of the.
00:24:20.198 - 00:24:30.050, Speaker D: Songs when it came to model. So for our services.
00:24:39.660 - 00:24:42.760, Speaker A: Once you're.
00:24:53.260 - 00:24:53.624, Speaker B: Because.
00:24:53.662 - 00:24:54.680, Speaker A: They realize.
00:24:58.220 - 00:25:04.896, Speaker D: Their souls that they will.
00:25:04.918 - 00:25:07.488, Speaker A: Be able to run their system.
00:25:07.654 - 00:25:09.216, Speaker C: All right, so maybe you could tell.
00:25:09.238 - 00:25:11.356, Speaker A: Us how does the reason of smart.
00:25:11.468 - 00:25:25.590, Speaker C: Developers differ from let's say web app developers or the more traditional developers use and how are you catering to this? How are you adapting your system to make sure that they're happy using it basically. So.
00:25:29.720 - 00:26:47.150, Speaker A: I guess yeah, the reason, the reason I came here sort of adding to what smart contracts are one of the, in addition to the stuff that we're doing with jlink, which is sort of the first step to bridge, also offer some tooling for working with the stuff that we're building ourselves, for example. Other than that in our use case smart contract developers on their own. In that sense we try to hold their hands and bring people into the ecosystem and sort of facilitate the discovery of how you can build data driven smart contract. But as we identified, it's like limited by certain factors, for example, scalability of blockchain, which should in the future boost adoption of using smart contracts as in a huge way. It's a slow progress, right?
00:26:48.400 - 00:27:12.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I think right now APIs are built for speed and proof. How quickly can we get you calls? How many calls can we get? This almost doesn't matter for smart contracts as much because they're a low call use case. That might change, but I still think the majority of really high value use.
00:27:12.302 - 00:27:14.196, Speaker A: Cases that we're all excited about, they're.
00:27:14.228 - 00:27:39.330, Speaker B: Never going to be high call and the speed doesn't matter because right now it's what smart contract developers need is something else they need dependent. One of the things we try to do, negotiate particular service agreements with the providers on behalf of the developers, basically to make sure that the dependency will be there and they have what they need.
00:27:43.940 - 00:28:03.400, Speaker D: As we mentioned before, I think right now smart contract the users of smart contracts have to be a bit more ephemeral than normal API users. It's more difficult to be able to impose restrictions on how data is going to be used and make commitment.
00:28:10.460 - 00:28:14.552, Speaker B: I think develop smart contract based system.
00:28:14.606 - 00:28:16.200, Speaker D: That they want to be able to marry.
00:28:16.560 - 00:28:19.004, Speaker B: So ideally they want like for example.
00:28:19.042 - 00:28:23.132, Speaker D: If they're consuming market data from us, they want us to sign the data.
00:28:23.186 - 00:28:24.430, Speaker B: And they also want.
00:28:26.660 - 00:28:47.030, Speaker D: Signature from the data sources. So they want to at least have the ability to verify everything as far back of the source. That also requires standards for talking to all the different upstream providers so that you can.
00:28:49.800 - 00:28:53.350, Speaker B: Engage every participant to be able to.
00:28:55.660 - 00:29:22.144, Speaker E: Actually, can I get a quick show of hands? How many of you guys are building applications on Ethereum or et cetera? So this question was about developers. For me, it's two things. One is we want to meet you where you're at, which is everything you normally use to interact with Ethereum, JSON, RPC, normal rest calls, websockets, or however else it is native to you.
00:29:22.182 - 00:29:23.328, Speaker B: We support that.
00:29:23.494 - 00:29:33.972, Speaker E: So that's just the base level, right? The second level is education. I think all of us kind of tasted at it, but it's really difficult to interact in these new ways and.
00:29:34.026 - 00:29:35.604, Speaker A: Learn about chain link and learn about.
00:29:35.642 - 00:29:55.470, Speaker E: How you interact with these sectors. So we focus a lot on the education of how to actually connect your contracts. If you look at our blog, you can see most of them are tutorials. How do you actually, or I just published one recently about all the things you can do with chain link, because there's a lot of awesome ways you can interact there.
00:29:58.320 - 00:30:15.360, Speaker A: Maybe a follow up question to you guys, if you will. You mentioned data sign. So do you have data providers that sign the data at the source? Or is it more like you guys are halfway on its way to the subscriber?
00:30:16.260 - 00:30:18.736, Speaker D: We're talking to our upstream providers about.
00:30:18.758 - 00:30:20.212, Speaker B: It, but we haven't been able to.
00:30:20.346 - 00:30:29.828, Speaker D: Make it happen yet. So right now it's only signatures from our side, which doesn't really mean that much. What you want to ensure is the.
00:30:29.834 - 00:30:32.790, Speaker B: Integrity of the actual information that you get.
00:30:34.700 - 00:30:39.290, Speaker E: We're just a proxy. You can send a transaction to NFC pre.
00:30:44.220 - 00:30:50.136, Speaker C: I feel like we're quite lucky. We have quite a lot of people, so we might just open up the floor for some questions from the audience.
00:30:50.328 - 00:30:55.388, Speaker A: If it works for you guys, you.
00:30:55.394 - 00:30:56.610, Speaker D: Can just ask a question.
00:31:03.620 - 00:31:07.650, Speaker C: All right, so the question is, do you guys see webassembly changing your operating model?
00:31:13.480 - 00:31:30.728, Speaker E: Webassembly, like everything else, we want to support because we are just a data provider that wraps around current languages. So if you write Webassembly and you compile down something, but ultimately we will add support for those things, we'll let.
00:31:30.734 - 00:31:32.330, Speaker B: You interact in the way that you.
00:31:34.380 - 00:31:36.010, Speaker D: I think it's kind of like asking.
00:31:38.140 - 00:31:43.930, Speaker B: Web developer for the web.
00:32:05.000 - 00:32:10.984, Speaker A: Companion change and not really much streamer itself, but.
00:32:11.022 - 00:32:12.090, Speaker D: I think also.
00:32:15.180 - 00:32:19.880, Speaker B: Go back and financial.
00:32:24.720 - 00:32:30.430, Speaker C: Is the financial data blockchain, is it encrypted or is it readable public for everyone to read?
00:32:31.440 - 00:32:36.512, Speaker D: So if you want a smart contract on the chain you are publishing it on. To be able to react to it.
00:32:36.566 - 00:32:37.596, Speaker B: Has to be on a crypto.
00:32:37.628 - 00:32:43.970, Speaker D: So that essentially means that if anybody requests this data, that is going to be, just becomes a common.
00:32:59.740 - 00:33:00.490, Speaker B: Company.
00:33:03.340 - 00:33:06.760, Speaker C: Are you being compensated to put this data onto the blockchain?
00:33:07.340 - 00:33:55.800, Speaker B: This thing is more. Are we compensating the provider? Right. Well, I mean, like, for example, like service. I think that's why there's not a lot of people streaming data. But in terms of data and becoming a public on the blockchain, my CTO once described it as certain data providers aren't selling data, they're selling secrets. They have data that is more up to date or more current. And so in selling it to us, they are, to a certain degree taking risk where we have other providers, ones we're in talks with right now, who, their data set is just updated once every two weeks or so.
00:33:55.800 - 00:34:12.076, Speaker B: And hypothetically, if the wrong user got its hands on it, they dump the data set. Suddenly they're not a business. So there are problems with that. We try to solve that by. Yeah, that's a good point.
00:34:12.098 - 00:34:37.510, Speaker D: And I think another element to that is going back to what you said before about dependencies and availability and reliability. So sure, if you observe somebody else who made a smart contract that publishes the data points you're interested in, you could piggyback off that. But can you be sure that that will be there tomorrow if you're building a production system that's relying on this? And can you be sure that they keep on serving the data that you think they're doing?
00:34:39.960 - 00:35:23.750, Speaker E: I think you're kind of inferring, what can I run as a business on top of if I was a data provider for us, we actually have it split, so we have a premium model for some of our API data. So a lot of that is just pay the regular chain link fee, which is likely one link token. But then if you configure your adapter with your API key, since we're a traditional SaaS model, the subscription fee gives you that API key. You can configure that and have all the extra crazy aggregation data that we provide as well. So it's kind of like, I don't know that there's a way today that Chainlink could streamline all of that, but you can actually do a couple different ways so that the provider is also getting paid as well as the network chain link.
00:35:28.120 - 00:35:31.096, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe better. Yeah.
00:35:31.198 - 00:35:39.850, Speaker F: Just like a side note that of course the data points that the smart contractors get have to be some sort of aggregate or they have to be.
00:35:43.820 - 00:35:45.790, Speaker D: Second anyway.
00:35:49.920 - 00:35:55.100, Speaker F: Streamer, the very premise of streamer was that you could build these.
00:35:55.170 - 00:35:58.620, Speaker B: Sort of aggregations with these streamer canvases.
00:35:58.780 - 00:36:05.840, Speaker F: In which case you don't even need the original data points. You just make a very coarse aggregate.
00:36:06.840 - 00:36:07.830, Speaker B: Such as.
00:36:10.200 - 00:36:12.624, Speaker E: Whoever wants to make further.
00:36:12.672 - 00:36:14.550, Speaker F: Use of that, they can try that.
00:36:15.800 - 00:36:17.396, Speaker B: So I don't know, how much in.
00:36:17.418 - 00:36:22.488, Speaker F: Your business models have you gone through, sort of like publishing aggregates kind of.
00:36:22.494 - 00:36:27.480, Speaker A: Thing, or do you actually publish raw data to smart?
00:36:31.900 - 00:36:33.256, Speaker C: The way we do it is that.
00:36:33.278 - 00:36:52.880, Speaker D: We actually expose all our RSI or core APIs available through our daily contract. But as part of the request, you can also include aggregation parameters so the raw data will never see the blockchain. You will get a single data point and you will specify from the raw.
00:36:54.980 - 00:37:07.300, Speaker F: With the producers being fidgetive about releasing the data. So it will never be actually public, it will be just a course aggregate, just a test with the negotiation.
00:37:09.400 - 00:37:11.444, Speaker D: If the data is free aggregate.
00:37:11.572 - 00:37:11.912, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:11.966 - 00:37:29.388, Speaker F: What I mean is that when the data producers are very jealous about their secrets, that if it's an argument, could you tell them, no, we are not actually going to spoil all your secrets, only like course aggregate or something. You're not really losing much.
00:37:29.474 - 00:37:29.836, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:37:29.858 - 00:37:32.508, Speaker F: I mean, it's the website, all our.
00:37:32.514 - 00:37:40.080, Speaker D: Data, we don't expose KING seven orders, for example, you can get more sensitive.
00:37:41.460 - 00:37:46.864, Speaker B: And even if you, it wouldn't really make sense to, like you were saying.
00:37:46.902 - 00:37:58.212, Speaker D: Like it would be wildly stupid to try to get all the ticket level traits or orders or something because that volume is just so huge, like number.
00:37:58.266 - 00:38:03.140, Speaker B: Of desires here that work and it's going to cost all the beginning.
00:38:03.980 - 00:38:56.004, Speaker F: It's more like probably like suppose there is some sort of logistic tracking system or whatever, and then somebody would just be interested in what one company, maybe a competitor does, right? So maybe that competitor has a legitimate Internet, but they don't want to tell us or whatever. I don't know. You could make it useful even with one data point by seeing how quick your competitor does their shipments or whatever. But I guess the whole thing is that there's always the level of how you give, how you market the data, right? How you package it and how somebody subscribes it, and then there's how they actually use it. And of course, they will never actually use it in the smarter, as you say, you cannot push everything there. They will only ever use some aggregate.
00:38:56.052 - 00:38:56.890, Speaker E: Of it.
00:39:00.220 - 00:39:10.590, Speaker F: Never be losing quite as much secrecy as the package product. I mean, that's just what I'm saying. Is that something that makes easier for you or it's like not really a talking point.
00:39:11.120 - 00:39:19.168, Speaker D: I can just add one thing. You have the different stakeholders from a.
00:39:19.174 - 00:39:21.248, Speaker B: Data provider's perspective, you kind of have.
00:39:21.254 - 00:39:24.204, Speaker D: To trust the node operator because they're doing the aggregation.
00:39:24.252 - 00:39:26.000, Speaker E: So you're effectively exposing their own data.
00:39:26.070 - 00:39:37.350, Speaker D: To the node operators. So there's kind of a balance actor, like which position do you take? What level of trust do you put in the other.
00:39:39.080 - 00:40:06.700, Speaker B: I think as you're pointing out, smart contracts are generally high power, right? So Bloomberg can charge $30,000 for a terminal because they are zone. They can get you the financial data fractions. But a smart contract, you're not dumping earnings report. You're not like putting all that data out there secret. You're probably gambling on the buzword, like how big was the profit?
00:40:07.460 - 00:40:17.810, Speaker F: And if you could buy, just like if you could sort of say, okay, you're giving me all that 30,000 walls or whatever, the only ever promise you this one line?
00:40:19.220 - 00:40:28.310, Speaker B: Yeah. And again, I think that they need to have a full understanding of how smart contracts work in order to take that step. But that is one possible way in sort of.
00:40:28.760 - 00:40:59.288, Speaker F: They would be probably much more willing to. Smart contract is something you can trust. It always works the same way. So perhaps the pricing should be done not for the data package that you're selling. So this smart contract wants to use your data. What is that contract price? Because you can inspect the contract and see, oh, it's only doing that thing, only consuming that thing, and then you could price it just for that contract.
00:40:59.384 - 00:41:37.370, Speaker B: Contemporarily, that sort of is one way to do it. I think the better one, though, and what we've had more success with is getting them on. They get that 2001 space Odyssey moment where they realize what a smart contract they're on. So we could approach them and sort of sell them job by job. But I think it's more effective to try and get them to that educational process, because if you can do that, navigating all these areas of friction becomes infinitely. I have a question too.
00:41:41.040 - 00:42:01.970, Speaker A: You mentioned earlier, like this educational challenge, we're also seeing sort of mind shift start, raise data economies that can become possible.
00:42:02.280 - 00:42:05.156, Speaker D: Could you also elaborate a little bit.
00:42:05.258 - 00:42:15.770, Speaker A: On what kind of changes, what are the things that organizations, both your data providers and your customers.
00:42:21.260 - 00:43:14.760, Speaker B: To go where in love with technology? There are two things that we are going to explore, but other providers, not necessarily like with some work, but there are, we don't.
00:43:21.500 - 00:43:36.400, Speaker D: So I think one technical component sandwich a lot of the concerns that data providers have about their raw data being exposed and collected and aggregated environment, because.
00:43:36.470 - 00:43:38.416, Speaker B: They can remove a bit part of.
00:43:38.438 - 00:43:56.120, Speaker D: The trust that depends on node operators, so they can do the aggregation that you were talking about without them being humans running the node, being able to. Special way that they make analytics.
00:43:59.020 - 00:44:08.652, Speaker E: Yes, a couple of ways. Going further on the education side, those that are working with staff have an onboarding problem, not just the data problem.
00:44:08.786 - 00:44:10.972, Speaker B: And then they stack everything in between.
00:44:11.106 - 00:45:08.400, Speaker E: So it's not just about we can provide you some data. It's also why do you want that data? How many are the smart contracts? And then how does the user actually interact with that? So that's the biggest thing that we're trying to address is if we want to actually use outside data in a execution of blockchain, why would I want to do this? I want to keep everything that I have in the blockchain and just do logic on that. So part of it is the education of, if I'm, let's say, a trade station, and I want to get my market data, I want to see all of the trades on chain, and I want to bring that into what traditional investors are looking at. But I also want to trust you on that. That's something that takes a lot of steps forward in talking with them or just allowing them to verify that information. And then also, how do they actually integrate it into the apps that they're doing?
00:45:08.550 - 00:45:33.270, Speaker B: That's what we're working on. Just to add to that, though, they get really excited. They want the developers there so they can help. Whatever they can help. They want to be about it, they want to help the developers get going, but you have to do that extra work.
00:45:35.880 - 00:46:43.372, Speaker A: For us. And the interesting phenomenon we're seeing is that when we talk to organizations, they're used to the business model where most value for them comes out of keeping the data in a silo, like closing it up, keeping it a secret. This new opportunity of opening up a little bit and looking for those data monetization opportunities, that's a scary new world that not everybody wants to enter into. While it could actually increase the value. I mean, this used to be like manufacturers making car manufacturers, or OEMs making parts or whatnot factory, everything, really. They could optimize their processes by exchanging data with each other, but it's not happening because they're locked down to this mindset like mind don't come close or.
00:46:43.426 - 00:46:45.184, Speaker D: Advice sort of thing.
00:46:45.302 - 00:46:54.480, Speaker A: And that's something that, using blockchain technology, these type of technologies could actually be disrupted to unlock some value from the HTML.
00:46:56.500 - 00:47:31.230, Speaker D: I think you're touching on a good point there. And one big mind shift that we had was back when Taiko started out. We treat the data as a commodity, basically, you pay us and we give you data, but realized that's not really the value that people want. They want the service of getting the data or the license to use the data. So until you start looking at data, not as a commodity, but you're looking at the service you're providing or the right to use the data. In certain ways, it's not any more scary to let some of the data become public, because.
00:47:39.700 - 00:47:55.808, Speaker E: Just to add to, let's play devil's advocate for a second. If I was going to destroy Everdata or Krako or whoever else, I actually built a little demo app just because I wanted to test this. If I went and took all the raw data from our chain link connection.
00:47:55.904 - 00:47:57.204, Speaker C: And I set that up and built.
00:47:57.242 - 00:48:38.130, Speaker E: An aggregator and I did aggregations for order books, or if I did that for OHC, or if I did that for some of my events, for my contracts, that actually was extremely expensive. And then I was know, okay, what if we sharded? What if we did a side channel? What if we did say channel? It really doesn't quite economically make sense because you're still missing out on the fact of the uptime. You're also missing out on that data recency. Like if I want to go collect from multiple exchanges or if I want to collect from multiple blockchains, it's always going to be the same lazy issue. So I think there's still the need, and there always will be the need of the data provider, and you need to be able to validate that, that data provider actually giving you accurate data.
00:48:42.020 - 00:48:49.110, Speaker C: I think that was really good as a panel to have discussions like this. I think we have time for one last question.
00:48:49.660 - 00:48:50.810, Speaker B: One last question.
00:48:52.860 - 00:49:03.212, Speaker C: All right, I guess maybe to end one last question from me, it would be really, what was the biggest challenge you faced, building your business and how.
00:49:03.266 - 00:49:04.700, Speaker E: Were you able to overcome?
00:49:07.520 - 00:50:02.616, Speaker A: I think we've touched on many of the challenges, and roughly they are divided to technical challenges, maybe legal challenges, and let's say educational challenges. I think there's major ones in each of these, and it takes time for sure. On the technical side, the biggest challenge is to build a robust, trustless system, for sure, that has to create algorithms and a network where basically anyone can participate but no one can harm building the incentive mechanism, which were only like early days on that part, and how to verify things. And if we have a network of thousands of nodes, how will that be paid? What about millions of nodes?
00:50:02.808 - 00:50:03.820, Speaker B: Where does it end?
00:50:03.890 - 00:51:11.284, Speaker A: Where does it break? On the legal side, for sure, one of the early issues was just getting the fundraising done, but that was like 2017, but perhaps could be mentioned as one of the biggest challenges. It was very unestablished still at the time. It still is, and it maybe hasn't even gotten easier in two years. At the moment, maybe on the legal side, it's more about considering GDPR, considering how users can use it safely. We're building tooling for creating data unions, basically, which means that a large group of people can come together, maybe they're owners of a particular device, like a facebook or Tesla or whatever, and they can pull data into a product and then sell that to people interested and get compensated for it. So basically, end users earn with the data that they're producing. But this is extremely complex from a legal point of view, because there's so many participants, it depends on what kind.
00:51:11.322 - 00:51:12.404, Speaker B: Of data it is.
00:51:12.522 - 00:52:07.670, Speaker A: Health data is more strictly regulated than machine data, like a sensor measuring temperature or humidity or whatever. So this is something we're trying to build a framework for. People developing the application can sort of get an out of the box template for the legal framework for their application and fill in the blanks and then go with that. And on the education side, as you guys mentioned as well, there's various mind shifts that need to happen on all levels. Also onboarding developers and making that part easy, but also in the big organization to start to change the way that they are used to operating and hoarding that value, versus participating in a more open ecosystem and making data more available.
00:52:09.160 - 00:52:18.436, Speaker B: I think for us, and maybe a lot of startups have faced a similar situation. We were trying to do all this business development, all this education, selling providers.
00:52:18.468 - 00:52:20.264, Speaker A: On receive model, and getting all this.
00:52:20.302 - 00:52:40.800, Speaker B: Done when it was just universal. It was all a hypothetical marketplace that we were discussing on behalf of. Now that the thing is actually up and running, now that we have this thing going to, now that developers can use, we've done the thing. Exciting.
00:52:43.220 - 00:53:41.452, Speaker D: Yes. If we just look on a very practical level, like what are the most difficult challenges for us on a day to day basis? I think it consists of the main problem that a lot of our customers use us for, and that is solving fragmentation. So what I mean by that is, if you look at how from the sources of crypto exchanges, there's no standard nomenclature you can have. For example, there's two tokens both on USD coin, and there are different stable coins around the same value of one US dollars, and different exchanges with different coins that they call USD coin. And some of them use the same code for different currencies. We also have undocumented differences in semantics and API and stuff like that. Fragmentization in a broader sense is the biggest challenge for the theorem community and the blockchain space in general.
00:53:41.452 - 00:54:44.180, Speaker D: If we look at L2 solutions, I think we have more L2 solutions than we have people who want to use L2 solutions today. I think we need to try to form theory to start to talk about forming standards. For example, like how do we talk about these things, how do we name them? And we agree on common protocols. Just look at things like Windows workout. You haven't agreed upon way of how we call consensus and all this, but how the clients talk to each other, like network protocol, that's something that they're only starting to look at now through just like the developers talking to each other. And I think this needs to be formalized a little bit. And I know that we like to hold like formalization stuff on a large length, but I think it's really necessary to be able to make something useful and give both liquidity and interoperability properly.
00:54:46.060 - 00:55:46.190, Speaker E: Yes, definitely difficult, I know, just to answer what you're saying, they're definitely headed down on that spec and they're still working on that, a lot of the chats with them. I think that the real issue is that the governance is not pushing funding forward and finding those folks that are talented to clear that spec. And there's no one really taking the charge to do that. But to go back to your original question, like what are the challenges for data? A lot of it is making sure that we have all the data available, easy to access, all the data that we do collect from different exchanges and from different blockchains, that it's all verifiable. Some of the challenges with exchanges and with the non decentralized providers is how do we validate all their actual volume and all that stuff. So for us it's a lot of that providing that context for all the developers and for the end users, making sure that it's good and sound data.
00:55:48.080 - 00:55:52.540, Speaker D: I'm just curious, what's your stance on verifying volume?
00:55:54.400 - 00:56:12.544, Speaker E: For us, we look at all of the order books and all the trades, and if we can marry those two blockchain transactions, that's something that we can actually validate for the things that are just reported. It's probably an awesome future idea, but maybe just signifying what the exchange reported.
00:56:12.592 - 00:56:14.692, Speaker D: Versus this is something that we can.
00:56:14.826 - 00:56:27.690, Speaker E: Nail back down to on chain. Since we provide both of those things, it's up to the apps and developers to make sure that they're actually reporting the real volume to their users. I'm sure that's something you guys have encountered as well.
00:56:28.940 - 00:56:49.250, Speaker D: But on central exchanges it's difficult. Like you could have one bitcoin being transferred and then that bitcoin being traded back and forth a million times. How do you know that all of those are not wash trades? It's a tricky question. You have like you have very research papers that are trying to solve this, but it.
00:56:58.020 - 00:56:58.480, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:56:58.550 - 00:57:10.330, Speaker C: I think that was the last question. So thank you everyone. Like this was an awesome discussion. Don't hesitate to stick around. We have some really nice events coming up also. And thanks again to the speaker. This was be a great deal.
00:57:10.860 - 00:57:13.320, Speaker A: Thanks for moderating and thanks for inviting us.
00:57:13.390 - 00:57:13.670, Speaker B: Thank you.
