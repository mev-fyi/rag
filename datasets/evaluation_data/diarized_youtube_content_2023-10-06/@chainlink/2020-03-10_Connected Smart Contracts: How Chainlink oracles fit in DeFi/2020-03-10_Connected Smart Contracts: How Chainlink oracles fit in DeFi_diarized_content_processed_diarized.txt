00:00:10.800 - 00:01:21.620, Speaker A: Now, the issue we have with smart contracts today, as of today, that they're not connected with the real world, right? Blockchain technology is a siloed technology, which means you have miners, you have validators which basically agree on the state of the network. They come to consensus on a certain state for Ethereum, for bitcoin, but they're not coming to consensus on the state of a data point, right? They won't be able to fetch you the price of gold, for instance, or the weather in Berlin today. That's not something that's accessible on the blockchain. Right now, all the blockchain does is keep an amount of transaction, keep a ledger about the amount of transactions, about the past state, basically. Now, what you're trying to do at Chenlink is we believe that smart contracts have tremendous potential, right? And we also believe that smart contracts, in order to feed this potential need to be connected to real world data. Now, real world data is, for instance, market data being able to connect Bloomberg to Reuters, it's payment processor data. Not everyone wants to be paid in crypto, actually, most people prefer to avoid the volatility.
00:01:21.620 - 00:02:03.144, Speaker A: So being able to access payment processors, just like PayPal, for instance, just like Swift, it's basically having inputs and outputs be accessible to smart contracts. So from a smart contract, I can get the price of gold and I can maybe trigger a payment using PayPal. That's the idea. And we believe that currently, without the inputs and outputs, the space is extremely restricted, right. Basically, before DeFi, all we had was crypto pieces. For instance, it was tokenizing stuff and exchanging it between peers. It's a great use case, but it's not really fulfilling the promise of blockchain, right? That's not what we signed up for.
00:02:03.144 - 00:02:43.780, Speaker A: We signed up for a bit more. So now, just to walk you into the kind of state and the evolution of the ecosystem in five years, when basically from having multi keys, where basically you have multiple signers, whenever you get a number of signature, you can trigger a transaction to having protocol smart contracts. So in order to have a smart contract being forced, and in order to add new capabilities to a blockchain, you had to change the underlying protocol, you had to code up your new changes to the protocol itself, which results the big risks that came with it, with changing the underlying protocol, it wasn't that great.
00:02:43.850 - 00:02:44.420, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:44.570 - 00:03:04.396, Speaker A: Now, what happened with Ethereum was that anyone could deploy a smart contract in five minutes without ever changing the underlying code on which the platform relies on, right? So if you wrote a good smart contract, a good platform that people want to use, then perfect. And if your smart contract was flowed, well, no one was forced to use it.
00:03:04.418 - 00:03:04.604, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:04.642 - 00:03:09.228, Speaker A: So it never threatened the protocol in itself.
00:03:09.394 - 00:03:09.676, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:09.698 - 00:03:15.772, Speaker A: So that was a ten x improvement compared to what existed before. And this allowed for a lot of stuff to happen.
00:03:15.826 - 00:03:16.056, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:16.098 - 00:04:29.084, Speaker A: That's when we saw, as we can do, 2017 craze, where people started tokenizing, creating tokens out of nowhere, and started trading them between each other. However, there was a big flow into this system, which is basically not being able to access real world data, right, and can you rebuild the financial system? Can you rebuild insurance? Can you rebuild supply chain, all of this stuff on blockchain without real world data? No, you can't, basically. So our building at chain link and the way we think the space is going to evolve is having smart contracts which can easily connect to API endpoints. And now to do this, for instance, is connecting to basically market data, as I said, connecting to payment processors and of course, connecting to other blockchains. So the way I would think of it is currently we are in extremely siloed ecosystem. It kind of resembles the days of the intranet, right, where you had a private network and you had multiple private networks which weren't communicating. Now, that was still useful, but it wasn't great, right? And where we see the value, where we see the ecosystem thriving is when you create bridges between all of these networks.
00:04:29.084 - 00:05:21.860, Speaker A: And what I would say more is when you create a bridge between the real world and blockchain technology, that's when you see the value really coming, basically. So now, there is a caveat to this. Whenever people start working with smart contracts, it's usually for a good reason, right? Maybe you want transparency, maybe you want more security. Maybe you want a system which doesn't have friction, like we can have in the real world. For instance, if you have DeFi, then you will be able, I mean, I'm sure you guys use it. If you go to compound, if you go to Aave, if you go to all of these platforms, you can already start earning interest on your crypto without having to do a KYC process. Talk to your banker, all that stuff, right? And to kind of allow for this, what we have is a decentralized network, right, where no one can stop you for doing what you need to do.
00:05:21.860 - 00:07:02.890, Speaker A: And we believe that if you are going to create a connected smart contract which basically can access real world data, which can access payment processors and all of this great stuff, right, you need to keep up the guarantees that smart contracts offer. Basically, it doesn't make sense for us to have a decentralized computation platform with nodes securing it from all over the world be fed data from a single oracle, right? It doesn't make sense. End to end reliability is extremely important. And if you go to a CIO or a CTO and you propose this kind of architecture where you have one centralized node feeding data to a decentralized network, then it's a very flawed architecture, right? So what you try to do at Chainlink is connect the real world with blockchain technology while still keeping out very important properties. The first property on which interspace relies on is decentralization, right? Today you trust bitcoin, you trust Ethereum, because you have multiple nodes across the world which are distributed across many geographies which come to agreement on the state of the blockchain, right? What you believe we should have to feed data and to feed reliable endpoints to these smart contracts, we should have multiple nodes from all over the world which come into consensus into agreement on the state of the data, right? So basically here you're just replacing coming into consensus on the state of the blockchain with coming to consensus on the state of the data, which you're going to feed to smart contracts. So I have ten nodes which are feeding the price of gold, for instance, or of silver, and they come to consensus on the state of the price. Basically.
00:07:02.890 - 00:07:57.240, Speaker A: Then we have binding service agreements where basically you have some kind of SLA, I'm sure you guys are all familiar with SLA, and you publish this SLA function the way it could be. Smart contract creator wants a certain data point, he wants to access a certain data, right? He's going to publish a contract which says, all right, I need this API endpoint. I need, we fed every five minutes some information. Basically another operator will commit to fulfilling this agreement, he will commit on chain. So here you're basically leveraging the properties of blockchain technologies, which is when someone agrees to do something on chain, then you have an onchain commitment, right? You can trace it, you can see what happened. You have a proof basically that this happens. So if the node operator for some reason goes down or doesn't really provide the data should be providing, then you'll have approval.
00:07:57.240 - 00:08:56.232, Speaker A: And of course through this you can have reliability because you can see the history after the operators, you can track the reputation, you can see when they went down, basically using the properties I mentioned. Then we apply defense in depth. Also, what defense in depth allows is running the chaining software into an enclave. Basically, I'm probably not going to go into the definition of ta just for the sake of time, but yeah, it's basically another guarantee which is more hardware based, while we can have properties which can be more kind of economic based, for instance, staking, which I'm going to get to a bit later on. And the last one is actually having a large open source community. So these network effects which can form, for instance for Ethereum, really come up from a community, right. A community which is dedicated, which is always researching, which is always kind of evangelizing the network.
00:08:56.232 - 00:09:41.224, Speaker A: I think as we get more and more people around the project, so more operators, more people who know how to node, for instance, which we have a great bunch here already, and we get more and more smart people we had committed into the project, we get better guarantees of its success. Basically a community can improve anything that's network effect related, that's security related. All of this great stuff. I probably won't go into this because I think I'm already running out of time. I have 116 sites, so if you want to talk later, I'm a great person for this. Yeah.
00:09:41.262 - 00:09:41.704, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:41.822 - 00:10:36.040, Speaker A: The stuff I wanted to go into now, which has really been exciting us a lot, and maybe the reason I sound tired, because this stuff takes a lot of time, but it's the stuff we've been doing really for the past few weeks, few months. I'm sure you've heard of. You've all heard of DeFi, right? So DeFi, I love to kind of define it as if you've been in crypto for two, three years. You are kind of like a man walking in the desert. And for me, Defi is the way, it's the stuff which is really getting usage which people started using today, and which has a lot of potential. I think a few months ago we had maybe 1015 million volume on D five platform, except Baker, of course. But you didn't have that much of a big movement there, right? And now I think if you go into D five votes, you might have a volume of $900 million being secured by DeFi platforms.
00:10:36.040 - 00:11:04.384, Speaker A: Not volume, but value secured by smart contracts. I think basically what DFI shows is that crypto already has a world changing potential, and we want to make sure that you are able to strengthen this movement and help it where it needs to be. Basically, I think DeFi and financial platforms intuitively need data, right? They need market data, they need IoT data. They need all of this stuff to can do succeed.
00:11:04.512 - 00:11:05.190, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:05.640 - 00:11:28.668, Speaker A: One of the most important use case we've seen DeFi recently is the need for reliable prices. And when I say reliable, it's also transparent, it's also decentralized. Some of these defi dapps can basically trigger liquidations, they can trigger margin calls, they can trigger a lot of stuff which whenever it happens, a user will want to know why it happens.
00:11:28.754 - 00:11:29.292, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:29.426 - 00:11:37.792, Speaker A: They don't want to have kind of a closed source oracle, which is running in the background of this DAP and which can liquidate your assets at any point.
00:11:37.846 - 00:11:38.064, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:38.102 - 00:12:09.764, Speaker A: You need transparency, you need security as a user in DeFi and of course as a DAP provider, because what happens if you're responsible for, like it happened for instance, for instance, which had an outage maybe six or seven months ago where one of their oracle went down, right? Not went down, but the value got corrupted basically, and it threatened the whole system. Right. Now, whenever it comes to Oracle and the underlying infrastructure behind it, I like to compare it to a blockchain.
00:12:09.812 - 00:12:10.216, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:10.318 - 00:12:33.856, Speaker A: Let's say you were a DAP developer and you wanted to create a new DAP. Would you spin up your new blockchain? Would you spin up from scratch a new smart contract platform on which to build up? Probably not, right? Because it needs a lot of security, it needs to build up the network, it needs to have a token economy behind this. Basically a lot of stuff you need to work on and which if you don't do it right, could pose a lot of problems.
00:12:33.958 - 00:12:34.512, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:34.646 - 00:13:06.204, Speaker A: Well, it's very similar to Oracle for me. Just like if you are a DAP developer and you want to create your own DAP, you're probably not going to spin up a new blockchain. You're going to use Ethereum, you're going to use cosmos, Polkadot, pezos, whichever fits your needs. Well for Oracle is the same thing. You're not going to spin up your own Oracle, you're going to use chain basically as a decentralized Oracle network. And that's what we've been seeing more and more recently. So we've just published a landing page today which you guys can check out.
00:13:06.204 - 00:14:13.808, Speaker A: It's feed chain link, and basically we now have 25 contracts on main net which feed the price of, let's say gold, silver, crypto prices and many different pairs. And currently that's what the reference contract looks like. It's basically multiple node operators which are distributed around the world. So for instance, we have many here, but we have others in China, we have others in the US. And basically these node operators are blockchain infrastructure companies, which means they have security background, they have DevOps backgrounds and they've been running blockchain software as a living for a long time already, right? And these people are accessing multiple endpoints and feeding the data to smart contracts like Ethereum. And that's how you get the price of EQSD right now, for instance, using Chainlink. Now these smart contracts are not just there and not being used, they're actually today securing more than $150,000,000 of value with four main users who are using it, who are using them today on main net.
00:14:13.808 - 00:14:55.180, Speaker A: The main one is really synthetics. Synthetics need the data for their FX and commodity prices. We are providing this data with one of the reference contracts I showed you earlier. And basically they're now going to move also to having all their price feeds being fed by chaining Oracle. So it's not going to be only FX and commodity, but it will go to all the price feeds they need being served by us. Same for loop ring, which needed basically to secure their staking for their relayers. Same for ampleforce, which needed a couple of important endpoints to basically determine the elastic supply of their token and same for Ave, which went live I think two weeks ago.
00:14:55.180 - 00:15:05.440, Speaker A: And actually Ave is very, it really shows what I was discussing about Defi. The thing was lived two weeks ago and it has $7 million under liquidity pool already.
00:15:05.510 - 00:15:05.936, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:06.038 - 00:15:32.116, Speaker A: I mean that's pretty crazy. Like a few months ago it takes maybe five months to get anything to handle $7 million. Now it went in two weeks. So you can see the growth there. And Ave is securing their 15 crypto prices using chaining for reference. So yeah, that's basically, I'm probably going to end the talk here because I think I already ran past my time, but that's what I wanted to kind of demonstrate.
00:15:32.148 - 00:15:32.296, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:32.318 - 00:16:27.544, Speaker A: Like a few months ago when I was talking about chain link, all I had was kind of a vision, right? But we didn't have really users using it today. And I think today after a lot of work from everyone, not only the team but also the community, a lot of node operators here are securing these feeds and are monitoring them day and night to make sure nothing goes down. Well, in five months we went from not securing that much to securing all of this value on chain. And I think it will only grow. And the reason I think it will only grow is because the Defi space and the kind of ecosystem as a whole for me is probably going to experience a massive upside in the coming months. I think more and more people are realizing the potential of defi it's kind of world changing impact. And I feel very grateful to be at chanting and kind of this occasion to support this huge movement, because I think in a few years we'll be looking at these times and kind of think this was historical.
00:16:27.544 - 00:16:36.890, Speaker A: This really changed a lot. So, yeah, anyway, sorry I was a bit weird for this presentation, don't like. But thank you very much for him hearing me out and if you have any questions.
