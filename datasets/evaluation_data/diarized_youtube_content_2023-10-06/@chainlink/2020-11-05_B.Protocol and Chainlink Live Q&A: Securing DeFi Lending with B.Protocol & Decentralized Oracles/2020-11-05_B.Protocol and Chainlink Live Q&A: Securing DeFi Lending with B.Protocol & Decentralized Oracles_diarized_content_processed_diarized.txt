00:00:00.170 - 00:00:48.940, Speaker A: Get started. Really want to thank the B protocol and the chainlink community for joining us today. In addition, really want to thank Yaren and Ayton, as well as Rory for all your help in getting this up and rolling. A little bit about the goal of the Q A is to allow the Chainlink community learn more about B protocol and learn more about the integration and what makes both this unique and more about their product. So the agenda will be for about 20, 30 minutes, a Q and a structure. Yarin also has a short presentation that he'll be going over to kind of go more in depth about the technical architecture of B protocol. Again, if you have questions, definitely drop them into the YouTube chat and we'll be able to get to them.
00:00:48.940 - 00:00:53.610, Speaker A: So, yeah, without further ado, thanks a lot, Yaron, for joining.
00:00:54.770 - 00:00:56.160, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:00:56.770 - 00:00:57.182, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:57.236 - 00:00:57.454, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:57.492 - 00:01:03.698, Speaker A: Do you want to maybe just give a brief introduction about yourself and a little bit about your background and what your team is currently building?
00:01:03.864 - 00:01:27.794, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So myself started with Ethereum and blockchain in general in 2016. Back then I was still doing my phd in computer science. So it all started kind of in an academic framework. I was initially investigating formal verification of smart contracts. Then I met Lois Lu. He's currently the CEO of Kyber.
00:01:27.794 - 00:01:59.154, Speaker B: And later we also did Kyber together. He was also a PhD student back then. And we started this semi academic project that was smart pool, which was like the first decentralized mining pool over Ethereum. So we had an actual mining pool that was governed by a smart contract. We even mined a few blocks. Was really fun, like semi academic project. Then when Kyber network started, so it took me to be CTO there.
00:01:59.154 - 00:02:48.020, Speaker B: I was CTO for two years. Kyber was at the time one of the biggest decentralized exchanges. Still is. We did a lot of interesting stuff there, to name few, is also the wrapped bitcoin initiative. So Kyber and Bitgo launched it together, where Kyber and me, as a CTO, were in charge of designing all the smart contract architecture and the Ethereum side of the wrap bitcoin. So I was there for two years. Then after Kyber, I was starting to work a bit on liquidation bots and on chain market making algorithms, and very quickly I realized that proper liquidations are missing in the world.
00:02:48.020 - 00:04:05.820, Speaker B: So this is when I started B protocol, which is a project which is actually backed and funded by the Kuiper network company. So in B protocol, our goal was to make lending platforms such as Makerdao compound Ave more stable. And this was by basically giving some of the profits of these platforms during liquidation to the users, and in return, these users will give priority to liquidation to our liquidators. So this actually gives win win situation where both the underlying lending platform benefits from having more committed liquidators, the user benefits because they get to share some of the profits of the liquidators, and also the liquidators profit because they get more certainty. So it's really win win all around. And now the team, in the last six months we built the platform over Makerdao, went live about a week ago. We already have something like over $3 million in deposits which are simply Makerdao users who decided to move their Makerdao vault to our platform.
00:04:07.790 - 00:04:08.314, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:04:08.352 - 00:04:08.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:08.720 - 00:04:18.670, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for sharing. It's really interesting how you came from building liquidation bots and now you've built an entire protocol around that idea and concept.
00:04:19.330 - 00:04:37.800, Speaker B: Yeah, basically when building it and while have the protocol background of working on Kyber and building DeFi and decentralized protocol. So, yeah, I mean, it's much easier to see the pitfalls and what is missing, what liquidators will want to do, how they want to act with that.
00:04:39.530 - 00:04:52.118, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. Thanks a lot for sharing. Specifically with B protocol, what would you say makes it unique compared to maybe other liquidation protocols?
00:04:52.214 - 00:05:28.120, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically it's kind of the only liquidation protocol maybe beside keeper dow. But the real issue here is that you have over $10 billion in DeFi platforms. They all rely on proper liquidation process. Basically, the platform themselves make very little effort in securing this aspect. So they do bring liquidators, but overall their approach is to really outsource everything to the retail user to give him sound discount. So people will liquidate in times of need.
00:05:28.120 - 00:06:07.170, Speaker B: But this will only work in the good situation. In the hard situation, when the market goes really crazy, no one has real incentive to be prepared for it because you have to compete on all the benefits with the other liquidators because a lot of it will go to the miners because it's like typically a first come, first served system. So basically there's no, to the best of our knowledge, like a real protocol that put it as a goal to be the backstop of all of Defi and then later to offer backstop services to such platforms.
00:06:07.750 - 00:06:18.454, Speaker A: Cool. Very cool. Yeah. So we'd love to learn more about kind of b protocol and yourselves approach to defi. And I think you have some slides, right?
00:06:18.572 - 00:06:57.870, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me share my screen. Yeah. Okay. So first for our audience, audience, maybe a bit of a recap on how lending platforms actually work. So in lending platforms, such as Makerdao compound ave each holds billions in dollars. So you have the lenders who deposit some funds there, which is kind of a collateral, and against this collateral, they can borrow different kind of assets.
00:06:57.870 - 00:08:18.954, Speaker B: So simple example. So you borrow, for example, east, and you deposit east as a collateral, and then you borrow die in return against this collateral, where typically what you want to do in such case will be to go long on ether and then go sell your dai on the market and open a position which is long on ether. Now, in order for all the users who deposited funds to actually be able to get their funds back at some point, you always have to make sure that the debt of a user is smaller than his collateral, and more than that in order to keep some safety margin. So the debt plus some safety margin always have to be bigger than the collateral, where in platforms like Makerdao, the debt has to be like x, one and a half bigger than the collateral. In compound, it's token specific, but typically around 1.3 more than the collateral average is also similar. Now, once this is not happening, then your debt is no longer safe, and then you will go through a liquidation process.
00:08:18.954 - 00:09:13.386, Speaker B: So in the liquidation process, someone which is not, you will pay the debt on your behalf, and in return will take some of your collateral. Now, in order to incentivize people to do it. So typically you get some premium as a liquidator on this collateral. So let's say if you are liquidated with 100 die, you will get east worth 108 die. So it is your interest to do it. What happens in practice is that every time it's happening, there's a huge competition on who will do it first, because only the first get it, and then there's a big incentive to pay high gas prices. So what is happening is that most of the profit goes to the miners instead of the liquidators.
00:09:13.386 - 00:10:00.670, Speaker B: Now, what will happen in a world without liquidators, in defi? So dai will no longer be one to one with us dollar, because it will not be well collateralized. Compound and ave depositors will lose their funds, they will not be able to withdraw it back. And basically all of Defi will be dysfunctional. Dysfunctional. And funds will actually get lost. Okay, it's not only it will stop working, people will lose billions. So this problem is not unique to defi, and obviously it started so compound avid, they all give rise to margin lending platform where you trade with some leverage.
00:10:00.670 - 00:10:57.520, Speaker B: So this exists for a long time in the traditional world, also in the centralized crypto world. And what is happening there is platforms such as bitmex Kraken FTX, they form a dedicated backstop of professional algo traders. The traders commit that once there is a need to liquidation, they will liquidate it. And technically they are not even liquidated themselves, but the exchange saw the position on them, so they actually lock their funds in the exchange. And the exchange, when there's a liquidation, use it to do the liquidation, and then it's their responsibility to close the position on the platform side. So bitmax, crack, and all commit on the liquidation discount. And typically in the centralized world, it's about 1%, where in defi it's three to 8%.
00:10:57.520 - 00:11:56.142, Speaker B: So centralized world give much lower discount, but it gives you the commitment that, okay, once there are liquidations, we will share it with the desktop instead of letting everyone compete with each other. And finally, so when liquidation is needed, the exchange can just dump the position on the backstop. So this is a traditional world now in defi world compound makerdao ave, so they don't onboard big algo traders. Instead they say, okay, we let everyone participate. Anyone can be a liquidator at any time, which is a good thing. But on the negative side, it means that no one is committed to do such liquidations. And if no one is committed, then you will get your liquidators when the conditions are okay, and basically when it's not urgent to liquidate.
00:11:56.142 - 00:13:10.730, Speaker B: But in extreme cases, like the black Thursday events on Makerdao, you will not have anyone because no one committed to you. They also give discounts, and the discounts are much bigger than in the centralized world. But the problem here is that big part of the discount goes to the miners, because now they say, okay, the first one who will liquidate will get 8% profit as opposed to 1% on Bitmax. But that means that, okay, if I get 8%, and let's put a number value on it, so if I want to liquidate $1 million, I get to profit $80,000. So I wouldn't mind paying half of it, even to $40,000 as a gas fee to the miners, which means that the miners sharing the profit with me, and eventually liquidators need to profit, otherwise, you don't have liquidators. And any dollar that goes to miners, disincentivize the liquidators to build a robust system and to secure the platform. So the outcome of all of it is that liquidators will only liquidate if it's convenient to them, because they don't need to commit.
00:13:10.730 - 00:14:10.910, Speaker B: They don't know what will happen if there will be a big liquidation they don't know they will get it, so why bother building super complex hedging system that could handle it. So this is defi before B protocol and with B protocol. So we offer the following approach. So we adopt the permissionless approach of Defi and conceptually we let everyone participate, but what will happen is that we don't let in any liquidation everyone participate, but instead doing some kind of auction or process or a selection process every few months. And then we choose the backstop. And the liquidators, once we choose them, they commit to share the profits and in the future they will commit on some fund blocking and even on some funds to purchase the franchise to be in the desktop. So now they are more committed.
00:14:10.910 - 00:15:00.358, Speaker B: Instead of letting the miners decide to get to liquidate, smart contact will do it. So now they don't need to share the discount with the user. And moreover, since we built on top of existing platforms, which has very big incentive and discount for liquidators, so we are able to share the discount with the users instead of with the miners. And finally given all that, so we get committed liquidators. So liquidators are happy. Okay, so by that we are moving the mev, the miners value to the users. Liquidators compete with some franchise and users get to share the proceeds.
00:15:00.358 - 00:15:32.342, Speaker B: Just one slide on some analysis, what we actually get. So liquidators are happy because they get certainty, platforms get more committed liquidators so they are also happy. And finally the users get more, so they are also happy. So it's really win win all around. Besides, the miners get to lose some of the fee. But overall, in general, it is important. Miners are very important in the ethereum ecosystem as a whole.
00:15:32.342 - 00:15:45.770, Speaker B: But for the lending platform, in the liquidation in particular, it's best to incentivize those who are really crucial for the system. And these are the liquidators. So yeah, this is the protocol approach.
00:15:46.910 - 00:16:13.490, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, thanks a lot for that presentation. I think that really helps make a lot more sense for everyone of kind of your approach and everything that you're working on. It's really interesting that you're really taking, really helping the liquidator over the miner. And it seems like that's like better approach to this whole problem for these lending protocols because who's providing the value the most?
00:16:13.560 - 00:16:27.640, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, and it helps both the liquidators who provide the value, but also we get to help the users because now they get to share instead of profits going to miners, these profits will go to the users. Yes. It's really win win.
00:16:28.330 - 00:16:41.120, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. And I would love to learn more about how maybe Chainlink is going to be planned to be used within B protocol and how decentralized oracles fit within this whole process.
00:16:42.610 - 00:17:43.540, Speaker B: So currently in all these lending platforms, so they have their own price feed, maybe beside Ave who is already using the chain link price feed. And this price feed decides when an account is becoming unsafe. Now we want to give the same guarantee to our users, so we have to use the same price feed. But the price feed has another role, which is to decide how much the liquidator will take when repaying the user debt. And in this scope, some of our liquidators raised their concerns that for them it's risky to rely on this price feed, which is centralized in some cases. In other cases it's not sure how well it will be updated, et cetera. So they really need some kind of grant tools to know if a liquidation really worthwhile for them to do.
00:17:43.540 - 00:19:10.700, Speaker B: This is where Chainlink steps in very naturally on top of it. So the liquidators has to commit and initially it's kind of soft commit to do the liquidations. But again, if the price feed is unreliable and it's really off the market by a lot, then the governance model should not hold them accountable for that. So having on chain price feed such as chainlink, which is very reputable and reliable, also decentralized, give us exactly the solution we need because now the governance can also on chain view, this price feed can say, okay, the lending platform price feed said this is very profitable. But look, this is way off because look at the chain link price feed and in such scenario, we should not hold the liquidators accountable because they did what one would expect them to do. So it's securing the liquidators on one hand because it's like a reliable price feed that's how to manipulate and will prevent them from actually liquidating it. And it helps the governance maker decisions because they have now this source of truth that tell them, okay, the liquidators are okay, they would lose a lot by liquidating because the underlying lending platform price feed was way off.
00:19:10.700 - 00:19:13.114, Speaker B: Cool.
00:19:13.152 - 00:19:33.922, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks a lot for sharing that. It's really interesting and really helps narrow focus the whole thing, even if some of these lending protocols are using their own sort of internal systems. Thanks a lot for that answer. Yeah, I would love to know what's next on the product roadmap and what are you currently focusing on?
00:19:34.056 - 00:20:53.322, Speaker B: Yeah, in the product roadmap. So we went live with Makerdao as I said a week ago. Actually in the first month user get x two on the profit sharing. So there's still time to join. Overall, the launch get very good responses with over $3 million in user deposits and still going up now with the maker Dow integration, after a period of six months, deposits will be shared what was accumulated in six months. And we also seeded the smart contract with $10,000 that will be shared with the users no matter what, no matter how many integration there will be, et cetera. After six months we will have a voting process that will decide how to continue with Makerdao and the profit sharing scheme, how much exactly user will get, how much liquidator will get, what kind of commitments do we have to commit? Other than that we go full speed ahead already before these six months are over with Ave and compound integrations.
00:20:53.322 - 00:22:26.330, Speaker B: So we could really cover all the lending platform, all the big lending platform. And these days lending platforms are very popular in the yield farming ecosystem because if you need Dai, if you need Dai, but you want to keep your loan position on ether, so these days you don't have to buy it, you just borrow it. So if you borrow it from Makerdao or know, might as well borrow it from B protocol, get exactly the same conditions you get from other platforms, plus get to share the profits and participate in the governance of B protocol. So by covering compound Aven Makerdao, the big lending platform hits would really cover most of this market. Now moving forward, after going live with Makerdao, we get numerous approaches from smaller tier platforms. And for them, having a strong and robust backstop already from day one is something very appealing because they don't have as big community as all the other ones as the big ones. For them, it's really essential to have operating backstop already from day one and there it gives rise to a more native integration.
00:22:26.330 - 00:23:24.720, Speaker B: So currently in Makerdao, compound, et cetera, if you're a user in Makerdao and you want to use B protocol, you have to go to our website, use our smart contract interface. But with the new one that now wants to integrate with us and they are starting from scratch, we could have native integration. Actually by default, a user that will use this platform will also use us. So yeah, we see that the native integration will help us to really secure much better the ecosystem. Because right now when we integrate with Makerdao, we can only secure the users who came to our interface, to our website. And in order to really secure all of Makerdao, we need to get a big chunk of the users. But with smaller platforms we can start with native integration and then already from day one we can secure this space.
00:23:24.720 - 00:23:31.454, Speaker B: So what will go next is, no.
00:23:31.492 - 00:24:13.102, Speaker A: I think that's good. I have one question, maybe just like some clarification for the audience as well. And I think you brought up a good analogy of how this is like a backstop for these lending platforms. And so from my perspective as a user, it's just like, okay, there's another bot liquidating myself or whoever it is, but what is the real value for these lending platforms? If you were to go talk to the Aave team or the ave community, now that it's completely decentralized, what is the value of integrating this? And how does that really maybe just the value that it provides for all?
00:24:13.156 - 00:25:02.970, Speaker B: Yeah, because it is not just another bot. So first of all, going like this, Makerda, we have three of the biggest defi algo traders. One of them is the Kyber network themselves, who are very active in defi market making. Another is one bit who is doing over $100 million on centralized exchanges. And we have SCP, which is very big in deFi, but other than them being good, they can approach them directly. No one stops them from approaching them directly, but the question is how they, for the long term, incentivize them to be a backstop there. And the real issue is that talking with all these market makers and potential liquidators, they just don't want to enter this niche, which is very profitable on the one hand, but very uncertain.
00:25:02.970 - 00:26:29.370, Speaker B: A lot of competition on the other hand, right? So like traditional players, you take a lamita research, we talked to free aero capital, they just don't want to go in because there's a huge gas war, a huge technical barrier, because you need to optimize, not on your trading algorithm, which all the algo traders know, but they need to optimize on gas, they need to optimize on network connectivity, they need to have some very complex stochastic models with a lot of uncertainty just simply because they let everyone liquidate. So here we give you like dedicated desktop, right? So now Ave does not need only to hope so maker that we're hoping that we give discount. So surely people will liquidate. And this failed on black Thursday, okay? Another reason the system there were complex, and they're doing very good work in making it simpler, but eventually just giving a blind discount and let anyone in will not give you a strong backstop. Now, projects like Ave maybe can do what we do himself, but once we do it for all the projects, it's become much more efficient. The liquidators will require smaller incentives because they don't do it only to ave. They do it to many projects so it becomes more efficient.
00:26:29.370 - 00:26:52.810, Speaker B: We don't not only give a bot and we don't give a bot at all, we give this protocol of properly incentivize these liquidators to participate. That's their motivation. And from the user side, the motivation is that it gets exactly the same as enough, only a bit extra because they get to share the profits.
00:26:52.970 - 00:27:05.090, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Yeah, thanks a lot for that explanation. I think that makes a lot of sense. If people want to follow B protocol's progress and join your community, where's the best place for them to go?
00:27:05.160 - 00:27:34.780, Speaker B: Yeah, so best place as usual is Twitter medium, and also Aitan is with us on the YouTube channel. Maybe you can drop the links there. But yeah, so join our discord for questions, for the announcement on Twitter, and for some more in depth analysis, visit the medium channel and if you want to try out the products, so go to bpotocol.org and you can try it over makerdao on.
00:27:36.130 - 00:27:36.830, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:27:36.900 - 00:27:37.134, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:27:37.172 - 00:28:02.438, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for sharing those and I'll make sure to drop them into the description after we get off here for everyone else that's listening in. And yeah, the video will be up in a few hours after YouTube loads it. And then yeah, yarin, really appreciate you taking the time and coming on and answering these questions and letting the community learn more about B protocol and your team and everything that you're working on.
00:28:02.604 - 00:28:12.710, Speaker B: Okay, thank you guys for having me and thank you for supporting all the way during the integration. Was very smooth process. Looking forward for further collaboration.
00:28:13.210 - 00:28:42.140, Speaker A: Likewise. Yeah, it's been great working with your team. And again, everyone that's listening, really appreciate you taking the time. And if you have questions, definitely join the B protocol or the chainlink telegram and we'd be happy to answer those looking to do more of these throughout the future. We also have a meetup later today with dolomite, so definitely stay tuned on the Chainlink YouTube and subscribe for when that goes live. And otherwise, have a good rest of your day. Thanks.
