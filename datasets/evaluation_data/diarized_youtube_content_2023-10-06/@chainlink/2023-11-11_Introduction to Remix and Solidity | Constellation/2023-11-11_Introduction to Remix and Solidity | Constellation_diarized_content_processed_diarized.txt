00:00:00.570 - 00:00:01.120, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.840 - 00:00:08.124, Speaker B: Hello everyone. Good to see you here we have.
00:00:08.162 - 00:00:11.548, Speaker C: A lot of people so good.
00:00:11.714 - 00:00:53.836, Speaker B: Sorry that we are a bit late but we are ready to start and I'm here to talk with you beginners, you that maybe it's your first hackathon you'd like to create. Your first smart conte. You'd like to understand how this works, how to create my wallet, how to get some funds on faucet. What's a faucet? So I'm here to talk a bit about how of this and let's get started. So I share my screen. Let's change my screen a bit to.
00:00:53.858 - 00:00:57.224, Speaker C: Be better for you, I think I'm.
00:00:57.272 - 00:00:57.870, Speaker B: Here.
00:01:00.480 - 00:01:07.710, Speaker C: And present share screen.
00:01:14.140 - 00:01:14.776, Speaker A: And I.
00:01:14.798 - 00:01:27.020, Speaker B: Need to tell that I don't have a lot of slides. So the idea is only to introduce myself and prepare your computer because this is a handsome session and I hope.
00:01:27.090 - 00:01:29.950, Speaker C: That you can do everything with me.
00:01:32.160 - 00:01:50.630, Speaker B: Here we are. So my name is Solenze Kiros. You can call me Saul. Like this. And I am a developer advocate at chainlinklabs. Here are my concretes. You can follow me on Twitter to discover where I'm going or what I did before.
00:01:50.630 - 00:02:27.596, Speaker B: I used to share the presentations, the slides, the videos of past workshops and also the next steps, what I'm doing. Like I'm here with you. But today I'm living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but today I am in Buenos Aires. I am in different conference Labitconf and it's like 01:00 p.m. Now and in 4 hours 05:00 p.m. Are you participating a panel discussing about blockchains, how to choose a blockchain and you talk about ethereum.
00:02:27.788 - 00:02:37.344, Speaker C: So maybe you can learn a bit more about other blockchains later as well.
00:02:37.542 - 00:03:07.070, Speaker B: So let's go. Like I said before, this is a hands on session and this is the place where I share with you all the information that you need on this session and all that you need to do. It's copy and paste like myself. So I will copy and paste the information for you in the pad and you can do the same in your own computer.
00:03:08.880 - 00:03:14.972, Speaker C: So let's go. Here is the pet and let's add.
00:03:15.026 - 00:03:17.024, Speaker B: Some information here for you.
00:03:17.062 - 00:03:18.352, Speaker C: So we are here.
00:03:18.406 - 00:03:28.996, Speaker B: This is the introduction to remix and solidity. And I used to say that this is the introduction to all the information.
00:03:29.098 - 00:03:30.310, Speaker C: That you need.
00:03:32.360 - 00:03:38.980, Speaker B: For the hackathon. And also this is the pad I know that I must share with you.
00:03:39.050 - 00:03:40.230, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:03:43.650 - 00:03:45.966, Speaker B: So probably you have the link of.
00:03:45.988 - 00:03:49.326, Speaker C: The pad now and I ask you.
00:03:49.348 - 00:04:00.590, Speaker B: To put here your name and your city, country. Where are you now? So I'm here from Brazil.
00:04:01.650 - 00:04:04.930, Speaker C: Hey, welcome Mick.
00:04:05.990 - 00:04:18.920, Speaker B: Good to see you. From Norman USA. Amazing. And let's retrieve for the people entry here.
00:04:22.350 - 00:04:23.340, Speaker C: Some minutes.
00:04:25.070 - 00:04:28.166, Speaker B: Wow, we have someone from Internet.
00:04:28.358 - 00:04:29.420, Speaker A: So good.
00:04:30.510 - 00:04:35.420, Speaker C: So you are not fiscal. We have a real person here.
00:04:37.150 - 00:05:01.842, Speaker B: And also Nico and Chris and Sebastian from Spain. Oh, I love Spain. Our smartcoin Barcelona. It was really amazing. I'm so proud of the event. So proud of the hacker house that I helped to organize. Yes, a lot of people from different places.
00:05:01.842 - 00:05:04.710, Speaker B: Wow, we have someone from Italy.
00:05:09.380 - 00:05:11.568, Speaker C: So good. Yes.
00:05:11.734 - 00:05:26.840, Speaker B: Let's start with you. Like I said before, we are starting from zero and we used to have. We need a wallet. I have one here, but I will ask you a minute because I will.
00:05:26.910 - 00:05:39.448, Speaker C: Uninstall my wallet to install with you again. So I'm removing my wallet in a hidden window here.
00:05:39.614 - 00:06:07.170, Speaker B: Hey, welcome Luis. From this I think I already removed it. And we are using here metamask. We are using a web wallet to develop and how can I use this Webby wallet? So let's install my wallet. This is metamask, the wallet that I'm using. So I'm sharing with you this.
00:06:08.260 - 00:06:12.220, Speaker C: And then I downloaded the wallet.
00:06:12.300 - 00:06:16.808, Speaker B: It means that I'm installing an extension in my browser.
00:06:17.004 - 00:06:21.700, Speaker C: I'm on chrome, so install metamask to chrome.
00:06:26.300 - 00:06:29.576, Speaker B: We have more people from Spain, from.
00:06:29.678 - 00:06:37.100, Speaker C: Texas and add extension.
00:06:39.120 - 00:06:44.720, Speaker B: Let's wait a minute. And also I'd like to see if.
00:06:44.790 - 00:06:48.050, Speaker C: The video is good for you.
00:07:17.640 - 00:07:22.024, Speaker B: Yes, it takes more time, but let's understand a bit more.
00:07:22.222 - 00:07:26.980, Speaker C: What is a wallet and why I need a wallet.
00:07:27.140 - 00:07:29.832, Speaker A: This is interesting for you.
00:07:29.966 - 00:07:34.540, Speaker C: So I need a wallet basically to.
00:07:34.690 - 00:08:29.340, Speaker B: Define what I'm doing or to interact with crypto. So we are creating smart contracts. And to create smart contracts we must have some funds and these funds will be started in a wallet. The wallet will be like the bridge to you to connect you with the blockchain. When you are creating smart contest like using remix, you must send transactions to the blockchain and you are doing this using the wallet. And the wallet is to manage your fund so you can receive funds over there, you can spend and you must spend a bit to create smart context, to interact with smart context. And you are authorizing these transactions using the wallet.
00:08:29.340 - 00:08:32.952, Speaker B: I know that's installed. Now where is my wallet?
00:08:33.016 - 00:08:44.210, Speaker C: First of all, go here to this puzzle and find the metamask and pin the metamask. Then we have the fox here. Perfect.
00:08:45.700 - 00:08:48.204, Speaker B: And I have the metamask in the other window.
00:08:48.252 - 00:08:54.820, Speaker C: Let's bring to you so this is met. Okay, let's agree and create a new wallet.
00:08:55.720 - 00:09:17.100, Speaker B: And I remind you that if you have a red heavier wallet with real funds, don't use it. Use a new wallet because it's important to not having the same wallet. Test funds and real funds because you are learning, you are doing tests. Maybe in some moment you share something.
00:09:17.170 - 00:09:19.468, Speaker C: That you could not do it.
00:09:19.554 - 00:09:25.184, Speaker B: And if you have a real fund in the semi wallet, someone can install it.
00:09:25.302 - 00:09:27.970, Speaker C: So be careful with this.
00:09:32.320 - 00:09:33.070, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:35.360 - 00:09:39.340, Speaker C: So here we are, let's create a new wallet.
00:09:43.070 - 00:10:01.438, Speaker B: Okay, I agree and I'm creating a password. It's a weak password for now, but this is a wallet that I'm creating here with you. But I'm not using this wallet later because I will share this wallet with you.
00:10:01.604 - 00:10:05.070, Speaker C: So it will be that wallet.
00:10:06.470 - 00:10:12.082, Speaker B: Okay, I don't need to see the video now, but I use secure my wallet here.
00:10:12.216 - 00:10:13.330, Speaker C: A wallet.
00:10:15.190 - 00:10:35.418, Speaker B: It used to be made by a set of words. Then it is a combination that you generate private keys, public keys and addresses in our case. So you have twelve rewards here that you can share to anyone.
00:10:35.584 - 00:10:43.306, Speaker C: If someone knows your words, your mnemonic, your backup phrase, how of this is.
00:10:43.328 - 00:10:53.006, Speaker B: The same, they can install your funds. In my case, I am sharing with you because I'd like to teach you.
00:10:53.108 - 00:11:01.490, Speaker C: So you are seeing my wallet, my twelve words. But after this, I am not using this anymore.
00:11:01.910 - 00:11:03.140, Speaker A: So review.
00:11:07.430 - 00:11:10.390, Speaker B: The twelve rewards from my wallet.
00:11:12.010 - 00:11:15.240, Speaker C: And next, which confirms some of this.
00:11:18.010 - 00:11:22.300, Speaker B: Like I said before, don't share yours with anyone.
00:11:30.490 - 00:11:32.230, Speaker C: And now I have a wallet.
00:11:34.490 - 00:11:55.854, Speaker B: What part of my wallet I can share, I can't share the twelve rewards, the minimal, the backup phrase. But yes, I can share my address because if I'd like to receive some funds, I need to share my address. So if you are doing this, maybe you'd like to put here your name.
00:11:56.052 - 00:12:00.720, Speaker C: And your address because this is public. We can share this.
00:12:01.410 - 00:12:02.670, Speaker A: This is mine.
00:12:04.790 - 00:12:07.842, Speaker B: Second point that I must go, I.
00:12:07.896 - 00:12:12.450, Speaker C: Must change my wallet, my network.
00:12:14.550 - 00:12:18.600, Speaker B: Hey Sebastian, congrats. You are creating a wallet now.
00:12:19.530 - 00:12:22.200, Speaker C: I'm so proud of you. Great.
00:12:23.850 - 00:12:31.734, Speaker B: When we talk about networks. So here we are. But like I said before, we are doing tests.
00:12:31.782 - 00:12:34.714, Speaker C: We are on testnet and you can.
00:12:34.752 - 00:12:42.650, Speaker B: See here that I don't have the testnet yet. So I enable the show. Test networks.
00:12:51.640 - 00:12:52.548, Speaker C: Wow, amazing.
00:12:52.634 - 00:12:54.048, Speaker B: Congrats Chris.
00:12:54.224 - 00:12:54.950, Speaker A: Yes.
00:12:57.500 - 00:13:01.720, Speaker C: Networks. And now I can choose Sepolia.
00:13:02.380 - 00:13:20.044, Speaker B: The testnets. We have new testnets. We have old testnets like curly. It's for now a testnet that is the oldest. Maybe in the future you not exist anymore. And now the testnet that we are.
00:13:20.082 - 00:13:24.930, Speaker C: Using more it's sepolia so choose.
00:13:32.000 - 00:13:33.630, Speaker A: And here we are.
00:13:36.400 - 00:14:05.352, Speaker B: That now I am on Sepolia don't any token. So I need to get some tokens and we used to use faucets to this. So faucets are websites that give you some crypto, some testnet. We have some options when I talk about faucet if I go to the chain link faucet this is the place.
00:14:05.406 - 00:14:07.240, Speaker C: To get the link token.
00:14:11.170 - 00:14:30.454, Speaker B: Hey Kim, congrats for your wallet. So here I can get for example the link token and a process with a lot of sites that are interacting with your wallet is connect the wallet first. So I'm here, I will connect the.
00:14:30.492 - 00:14:42.840, Speaker C: Wallet, accept it terms of service and connect. Here we are.
00:14:49.840 - 00:15:03.890, Speaker B: And you can see here that connecting on sepolia. And this is my address. I must verify that I am person. This is so hard.
00:15:04.820 - 00:15:08.800, Speaker C: Let's see what's an animal here?
00:15:08.950 - 00:15:12.130, Speaker B: A water animal. I think this is not.
00:15:14.600 - 00:15:17.924, Speaker A: Yes, maybe I'm right.
00:15:18.122 - 00:15:38.676, Speaker B: Yes, I'm human. So here I can get 20 testnet link. Good, now I have a link. Okay, how can I see the link in my wallet? Did I add this for you?
00:15:38.718 - 00:15:39.212, Speaker A: Yes.
00:15:39.346 - 00:15:56.050, Speaker B: Okay another point that let's do this first because the link token used to pay some chaining services. But also you must get the sepolia token that is the native token here.
00:16:00.820 - 00:16:07.300, Speaker C: On the network. Some faucets.
00:16:09.960 - 00:16:13.220, Speaker B: Like the faucet from Quicknote.
00:16:13.960 - 00:16:31.184, Speaker C: Will work well if you register with them. This is one faucet with your wallet. Another test that you can have and.
00:16:31.222 - 00:16:35.840, Speaker B: You need to create an account. If the sepalia faucet this is from.
00:16:35.910 - 00:16:37.040, Speaker C: Alchemy.
00:16:44.750 - 00:16:47.674, Speaker B: And another that can help you.
00:16:47.712 - 00:16:51.998, Speaker C: A bit is the proof of work.
00:16:52.084 - 00:16:57.374, Speaker B: Faucet that you don't need to create an account.
00:16:57.572 - 00:17:02.130, Speaker C: It is, but with this you must.
00:17:02.280 - 00:17:13.374, Speaker B: Have your computer sometime like mining is not exactly mining. So I copy my address paste here, let's tell that I'm not a robot.
00:17:13.422 - 00:17:51.100, Speaker A: Again and start mining. So here I wait and to 0.05.
00:18:06.750 - 00:18:23.696, Speaker B: Get the link, show you how to find the address to add the link token, your address, your wallet. So let's go to the colonization of Chainwick. Think Unixo.
00:18:23.828 - 00:18:25.950, Speaker C: Yes, we are here.
00:18:27.840 - 00:18:52.824, Speaker B: Unity. Yeah Greg, I'm stopping my mining faucet because probably the audio is not good with this. Here I am in the documentation of.
00:18:52.862 - 00:19:04.350, Speaker C: Chain link and for example I like to get some information related to link address.
00:19:07.600 - 00:19:25.788, Speaker B: In a few minutes. I will get the link address and then I can get this and add this in the documentation. Probably I need to see more contact address.
00:19:25.874 - 00:19:26.910, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:19:30.560 - 00:19:33.330, Speaker A: Would you like to review?
00:19:34.980 - 00:19:36.050, Speaker C: Oh great.
00:19:37.700 - 00:19:47.400, Speaker B: Why am it? Change some information here.
00:19:48.250 - 00:19:52.840, Speaker C: That's a bit hard to get everything now.
00:19:54.010 - 00:19:56.966, Speaker A: Congrats Latoya. Here we are.
00:19:57.068 - 00:20:03.610, Speaker B: I have the address of the link in different networks. So we are on Sepolia.
00:20:09.150 - 00:20:10.410, Speaker A: Sepolia.
00:20:12.690 - 00:20:18.298, Speaker C: And I can add this to my wallet.
00:20:18.394 - 00:20:24.430, Speaker B: So I need copying the link token here. Go to Metamask.
00:20:28.080 - 00:20:32.400, Speaker C: I don't need this port tokens.
00:20:34.100 - 00:20:43.620, Speaker B: I don't need this as well permissions. So I came into tokens, import tokens.
00:20:44.680 - 00:20:49.744, Speaker C: To the contact address and the IDs.
00:20:49.792 - 00:20:52.330, Speaker B: That I find here.
00:20:55.180 - 00:20:56.170, Speaker C: The information.
00:20:56.540 - 00:21:02.570, Speaker B: Let's understand why this is not working. So I know Sepalia this is right.
00:21:07.360 - 00:21:08.270, Speaker C: As well.
00:21:12.720 - 00:21:14.030, Speaker A: Let's do it again.
00:21:14.720 - 00:21:17.250, Speaker B: Maybe I copy another point in the middle.
00:21:20.400 - 00:21:22.030, Speaker C: Import focus.
00:21:24.240 - 00:21:37.440, Speaker B: Here is not working yet. Okay, I will come back in a few minutes probably I have something extra to define with metamask.
00:21:38.740 - 00:21:42.050, Speaker C: Let's refresh the list and see what's happened.
00:21:42.680 - 00:21:51.590, Speaker B: We are come back in here late because we already have 20 links. So I'd like to see my 20 links. How can I see this?
00:21:54.590 - 00:21:56.880, Speaker A: You see, for now.
00:22:01.270 - 00:22:02.690, Speaker B: Link balance.
00:22:05.110 - 00:22:05.570, Speaker A: Go.
00:22:05.640 - 00:22:10.422, Speaker C: To balance off with your address.
00:22:10.556 - 00:22:16.920, Speaker B: So this is my address. If I go here, read content.
00:22:18.330 - 00:22:21.094, Speaker C: Oh no, it's not exactly here.
00:22:21.292 - 00:22:45.338, Speaker B: Okay, I'll come back later to you to send exactly where we are. Okay, so next point you need, like I said before, you need tokens, at least not the link token now, but you need tokens to create your first match content. Let's go to remix.
00:22:45.514 - 00:22:47.440, Speaker C: Oh, I have a remix here.
00:22:49.190 - 00:22:49.698, Speaker A: And.
00:22:49.784 - 00:22:52.100, Speaker B: Understand our content first.
00:22:56.250 - 00:22:57.238, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:22:57.324 - 00:22:58.646, Speaker B: This is the link content.
00:22:58.748 - 00:23:01.666, Speaker C: You don't need this now, you need this.
00:23:01.788 - 00:23:05.114, Speaker A: Let's go to remix what I'm doing.
00:23:05.152 - 00:23:13.370, Speaker B: On remix I will configure my remix. First of all, I may go into the source icon solid compiler.
00:23:19.860 - 00:23:21.276, Speaker A: Icon source.
00:23:21.468 - 00:23:26.800, Speaker C: Solid compiler and enable autocompile.
00:23:28.040 - 00:23:30.532, Speaker B: This will be useful to you because.
00:23:30.586 - 00:23:34.440, Speaker C: If you do something wrong, this help you.
00:23:34.590 - 00:23:36.616, Speaker B: For example, I have a context here.
00:23:36.718 - 00:23:52.190, Speaker C: Let'S do something wrong. This doesn't exist. And now you can see that I have an error over there and this doesn't exist. I can ask here and I can fix the problem.
00:23:54.000 - 00:24:13.120, Speaker B: After this. Go to the icon five deploy and run transactions. And here we are connecting the remix with our wallet. So go to the environment.
00:24:13.860 - 00:24:26.304, Speaker C: Here we are. Invite and make you are choosing injected providers. And this will be metamask.
00:24:26.432 - 00:24:31.700, Speaker A: Let's do it. Here we are. I remix.
00:24:33.560 - 00:24:38.820, Speaker C: So remix environment injected provider.
00:24:39.160 - 00:25:12.530, Speaker B: Before that remix VM it means that I am in a simulator of blockchain in the memory of my browser. But I like to interact in a real network, a testnet but this is a real network. So here we have environment injected provider. In this moment I must authorize this on my wallet. Let's wait because this is going to my wallet to get the.
00:25:13.800 - 00:25:18.710, Speaker C: Not yet. Let's wait a bit more.
00:25:21.560 - 00:25:29.284, Speaker B: You can see I know what's happened because I have opened it before I installed the new wallet.
00:25:29.332 - 00:26:02.340, Speaker C: So my remix it's working and can't find my wallet. Let's refresh my remix and probably now it records. So I call five. Yes, you can see here I can authorize remix to connect with Metamask.
00:26:05.430 - 00:26:18.440, Speaker B: How good my remix is connected with my wallet. You can see here that I am on Sepolia network. So we are ready to create our first smart content.
00:26:18.890 - 00:26:22.854, Speaker C: Now let's go to icon two I.
00:26:22.892 - 00:26:34.620, Speaker B: O explorer and you are creating a file colored hashist.
00:26:34.960 - 00:26:38.616, Speaker A: Saw how can I do this file.
00:26:38.648 - 00:26:41.410, Speaker B: Explorer I have some workspace here that.
00:26:42.260 - 00:26:46.128, Speaker C: Probably you are on the forward space.
00:26:46.214 - 00:26:50.156, Speaker B: Don't worry about this. Let's go to create a new file.
00:26:50.268 - 00:26:53.860, Speaker C: This icon over there. Create a new file.
00:27:00.400 - 00:27:01.150, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:02.000 - 00:27:03.550, Speaker A: And here we are.
00:27:07.520 - 00:27:10.830, Speaker B: So I wrote has a high probably.
00:27:15.280 - 00:27:17.310, Speaker C: The author that's K.
00:27:19.840 - 00:27:23.110, Speaker B: And will be our first smart content.
00:27:25.080 - 00:27:27.110, Speaker C: And copying this for you.
00:27:27.560 - 00:27:31.920, Speaker B: And these two slashes are a comment.
00:27:32.080 - 00:27:42.788, Speaker C: So I will define here that this is a comment. You don't need to copy this comment. This is another comment.
00:27:42.964 - 00:27:47.710, Speaker B: You are copying what is between the beginning and end.
00:27:48.400 - 00:27:53.500, Speaker C: So you must copy from the license.
00:27:54.000 - 00:28:00.400, Speaker A: Until here, okay, from license.
00:28:03.060 - 00:28:11.810, Speaker C: Until one of the limiters. Here we are. Then we are pasting here.
00:28:12.500 - 00:28:13.440, Speaker A: Paste.
00:28:14.100 - 00:28:33.210, Speaker B: Yes, we are receiving this paste code alert and we are learning. So don't worry about this now. But if you don't understand, don't use this code. I may teach you. So you are understanding this code in a few minutes.
00:28:35.920 - 00:28:37.070, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:28:40.080 - 00:28:45.180, Speaker B: Let's understand what we have here. Like I said before, when we have.
00:28:45.250 - 00:28:49.324, Speaker C: Two slashes, this is a comment.
00:28:49.452 - 00:28:51.996, Speaker B: In our case it's a good practice.
00:28:52.188 - 00:28:56.050, Speaker C: On remix to have a comment with.
00:28:58.100 - 00:29:04.672, Speaker B: The license. So this is the license that you are using MIT.
00:29:04.816 - 00:29:06.900, Speaker C: It's an open search license.
00:29:07.240 - 00:29:56.172, Speaker B: After this we have the comment pragma, that is to define the version of the solidity compiler. We can have different versions. In our case we are using the language solidity in the version 0.8.90. Here I have the command concert and the name of my content is exactly after this. Inside the brackets I have my content. Everything that inside here is my content. So my content start with a variable colored info and is the type string I can add.
00:29:56.172 - 00:30:23.980, Speaker B: I can store any kind of information. So this is the storage part of Mysmat concept. It's private. It means that I can access this variable only inside my content. And another important point that we have here, we have functions. So I have two functions here. The function, it's like a naming that.
00:30:23.980 - 00:30:47.270, Speaker B: When we call this naming, everything that's inside the function will be executed. This can be a lot of information, a lot of comments and structures for us. Now I only have you one comment in each function, but this can be more complex. For example, I can show you.
00:30:50.200 - 00:30:50.756, Speaker A: And.
00:30:50.858 - 00:30:53.684, Speaker B: You can see for example that I.
00:30:53.722 - 00:31:12.204, Speaker C: Have something with moments or with marks. I can show you others more complex as well. Let's see the flower example. I have more comments here only to you.
00:31:12.402 - 00:31:21.200, Speaker B: Understand that I'm calling the name of my function and everything that it's inside ub executed.
00:31:22.580 - 00:31:23.632, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:31:23.766 - 00:31:36.790, Speaker B: So this function is called get info. It's public. Anyone can call this function. It's a view because I'm not changing nothing in the storage of my content.
00:31:37.160 - 00:31:43.896, Speaker C: I'm only getting some information and I may return.
00:31:43.998 - 00:31:52.884, Speaker B: This is the information that I'd like to get. It's a string as well. And I may return in the information that is stored here in our private.
00:31:52.932 - 00:31:58.380, Speaker C: Variable, have another function collect set info.
00:31:59.200 - 00:32:29.780, Speaker B: And this is the moment that I will save some information in my variable. So I have this, the underscore info. It's a parameter that I must send when I call the function set info. It's public as well. Anyone can call. And here I'm only saying that the underscore info will be stored in the info variable.
00:32:31.240 - 00:32:32.420, Speaker A: So is this.
00:32:32.570 - 00:32:46.940, Speaker B: This is all that I need to create my first smart context. This is my first smart content. Now to deploy the content I must come back to the deploy and run transactions.
00:32:50.680 - 00:32:54.112, Speaker C: So come back to the icon.
00:32:54.176 - 00:32:54.790, Speaker B: Five.
00:32:59.420 - 00:33:00.152, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:33:00.206 - 00:33:01.690, Speaker B: Let's come back here.
00:33:06.720 - 00:33:12.888, Speaker C: But before deploying, probably you need tokens.
00:33:13.064 - 00:33:15.020, Speaker B: Do you have tokens?
00:33:15.520 - 00:33:18.540, Speaker C: Actually I don't have wallet.
00:33:19.440 - 00:33:25.900, Speaker B: No, I don't have sepole yet. So I can't deploy my concept because I don't have the sepolia.
00:33:26.060 - 00:33:39.124, Speaker A: How is this for you? I will ask you so do you need sequolia? If you need it?
00:33:39.162 - 00:33:50.664, Speaker B: I know that I have some address over there. Please hear your name and address again and I can send to some of you now, maybe not now, but at.
00:33:50.702 - 00:33:53.390, Speaker C: Least some of you to do with me.
00:34:04.480 - 00:34:11.080, Speaker B: I know that I have another faucet. But I need to check the password of my faucet.
00:34:11.160 - 00:34:15.120, Speaker C: Wait a minute. Because I don't have tokens.
00:34:20.340 - 00:34:22.050, Speaker B: Okay, let's get.
00:34:24.520 - 00:34:25.270, Speaker A: It.
00:34:27.640 - 00:34:29.652, Speaker B: Sorry that it's a bit noisy here.
00:34:29.706 - 00:34:33.270, Speaker C: I don't know what's happening around.
00:34:40.330 - 00:34:44.330, Speaker B: Okay, let's see what's happening with my faucet.
00:34:46.110 - 00:34:47.114, Speaker C: Any red or.
00:34:47.152 - 00:34:47.740, Speaker A: No.
00:34:52.190 - 00:34:58.074, Speaker B: So I come back later here. Changing my wallet now probably you are mining.
00:34:58.122 - 00:34:58.862, Speaker C: I'm not.
00:34:58.996 - 00:35:30.254, Speaker B: So I'm changing my wallet to another wallet that I can. So I'm locking my wallet in this moment. And if I click on forgot password, I can add another set. Quartz another mnemonic that I have some funds here. Wait a minute.
00:35:30.302 - 00:35:31.620, Speaker C: Let me get it.
00:35:37.000 - 00:35:54.830, Speaker B: So let's see what happened now I need to. There we are. You are not seeing my words. This is another set.
00:36:01.780 - 00:36:02.240, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:02.310 - 00:36:03.552, Speaker B: Here I have something.
00:36:03.686 - 00:36:06.752, Speaker C: So if you don't have sepolia it.
00:36:06.806 - 00:36:11.252, Speaker B: You can't deploy your content. So be careful about this.
00:36:11.306 - 00:36:17.556, Speaker A: Okay, here we are.
00:36:17.578 - 00:36:22.870, Speaker B: Let's come back to remix. Let's see if someone needs. Okay, you are good.
00:36:23.320 - 00:36:27.290, Speaker C: So let's go directly here.
00:36:27.980 - 00:36:29.640, Speaker A: Click on deploy.
00:36:33.030 - 00:36:34.018, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:36:34.104 - 00:36:50.440, Speaker B: IML deployed transactions. This is my content. I only have this content. Be careful because sometimes you are importing libraries and this can be another name here. Be sure that here you have your contract. Okay.
00:36:50.890 - 00:36:52.650, Speaker A: And click on deploy.
00:36:57.240 - 00:37:00.788, Speaker C: And again what I have here, I.
00:37:00.794 - 00:37:26.074, Speaker B: Have a problem because I changed my wallet and the metamask and remix didn't recognize this. So let's refresh this one more time. What's happened?
00:37:26.212 - 00:37:27.140, Speaker C: Oh, yes.
00:37:44.290 - 00:37:57.426, Speaker B: Thank you, Shao. In this moment we don't have the testnet it. In the chaining faucet we have only the link token. Sometimes we have it.
00:37:57.448 - 00:37:58.114, Speaker C: I know.
00:37:58.232 - 00:38:04.450, Speaker B: So I did another options here. So we have a list of faucets.
00:38:04.790 - 00:38:11.370, Speaker C: Here to get it. Oh, and I didn't add the that I was.
00:38:11.520 - 00:38:12.220, Speaker B: Wait.
00:38:14.110 - 00:38:23.520, Speaker C: Let'S get this for you. I forgot to hear here.
00:38:25.330 - 00:38:27.406, Speaker B: So this is another option for you.
00:38:27.428 - 00:38:35.510, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, good.
00:38:37.400 - 00:38:40.264, Speaker B: So after you deploy, could you add.
00:38:40.302 - 00:38:44.810, Speaker C: Here your name and the register address.
00:38:48.220 - 00:38:49.864, Speaker B: I still doing it.
00:38:49.902 - 00:38:51.850, Speaker C: So let's go to.
00:38:52.480 - 00:39:05.570, Speaker A: First of all, open my contact here. Yes, go to the. Because I change it the wall.
00:39:10.090 - 00:39:11.320, Speaker B: Next connect.
00:39:13.610 - 00:39:15.990, Speaker C: And then I can click on deploy.
00:39:23.870 - 00:39:56.770, Speaker B: Confine. And in a few minutes, if you go to deploy it contacts you can find your contact here. You appear in a few minutes. Yes, this is my contact. If you'd like to add you yours as well. I'd like to interact with your content. So this is my content.
00:39:56.770 - 00:40:06.390, Speaker B: I will expand my content now and if I click on get info I don't have any information because I didn't before.
00:40:06.840 - 00:40:10.470, Speaker C: So let's add the hackathon here.
00:40:13.160 - 00:40:14.580, Speaker A: Set info.
00:40:17.820 - 00:40:18.840, Speaker C: Now I'm.
00:40:21.600 - 00:40:41.824, Speaker B: When I click on get info I didn't went to Metamask because I'm only doing a query. This is local connecting my wallet. But I'm not sending a transaction to the blockchain now. When I clicking on setting info, I'm changing the state of the blockchain, the state of my convert because I need.
00:40:41.862 - 00:40:45.020, Speaker C: Change the store the storage part.
00:40:45.190 - 00:40:50.004, Speaker B: So I'm sending a transaction to the blockchain that must be validated by the.
00:40:50.042 - 00:40:58.390, Speaker C: Network and I'm paying a bit of fee on Sepoli to do this.
00:40:59.000 - 00:41:00.100, Speaker A: Confirmed.
00:41:02.060 - 00:41:09.460, Speaker B: Let's wait the transaction be confirmed. Here we are.
00:41:09.550 - 00:41:15.372, Speaker C: It's confirmed now. So if I came here again with.
00:41:15.426 - 00:41:24.592, Speaker B: Get info now I have an information hackathon. What about to say that this is.
00:41:24.646 - 00:41:32.320, Speaker A: The constellation hackathon set info.
00:41:33.940 - 00:41:37.796, Speaker C: I'm changing the information again and this.
00:41:37.818 - 00:42:02.492, Speaker B: Is another interesting point. Can I change the smart content? No. After you publish a smart contract on the blockchain, you can't change the code anymore. But if your content has some function to update data. Update information? Yes, in this case you can change.
00:42:02.546 - 00:42:04.876, Speaker C: The information not the content.
00:42:05.058 - 00:42:18.432, Speaker B: In our case we have the setting for to change the information. If I go to get info now I have the constellation hacker code. What is interesting in this case I.
00:42:18.486 - 00:42:23.516, Speaker C: Can see all the updates in my info.
00:42:23.628 - 00:42:26.944, Speaker B: How can I see this? We are on blockchain.
00:42:27.072 - 00:42:30.052, Speaker C: We are in a public space so.
00:42:30.106 - 00:42:31.668, Speaker B: I can find this.
00:42:31.834 - 00:42:40.056, Speaker C: Let's go to the Sepolia Explorer. If I go here, get one of.
00:42:40.078 - 00:42:54.508, Speaker B: My transactions and view on block. This is the block explorer. Hey Sebastian, thank you. Are you interactive here content in a.
00:42:54.514 - 00:42:56.030, Speaker C: Few minutes as well.
00:42:59.150 - 00:43:10.670, Speaker B: Here we are. I am a water risk on Sepolia. This is the last transaction that I did. If I scroll down to more details.
00:43:11.970 - 00:43:14.654, Speaker C: And click to show more, I can.
00:43:14.692 - 00:43:31.350, Speaker B: See that the set info was valid and I can see here the decode input data. Now you can see that the parameter.
00:43:32.010 - 00:43:37.910, Speaker C: Underscore info has the information constellation hack.
00:43:38.410 - 00:43:42.070, Speaker B: Let's do the same with the previous transaction.
00:43:44.890 - 00:43:48.086, Speaker C: Before I create the concrete and I.
00:43:48.108 - 00:43:52.810, Speaker B: Had the set info this was the first time that I colored the setting.
00:43:53.330 - 00:44:03.086, Speaker A: So second time. First time if I go here, click to show more the code and here.
00:44:03.188 - 00:44:06.834, Speaker C: I only write the hacktor and you.
00:44:06.872 - 00:44:12.020, Speaker B: Can audit the information. You can have like a historical of this.
00:44:16.360 - 00:44:18.630, Speaker C: And this is the idea.
00:44:19.320 - 00:44:34.600, Speaker B: On blockchain, everything is much content is immutable, the information can change, can be updated. But we have like the hash still we have the history, we can audit.
00:44:34.760 - 00:44:38.940, Speaker A: All the updates, like I said before.
00:44:39.010 - 00:44:42.620, Speaker B: So this is my concept, and we are in a network.
00:44:43.120 - 00:44:48.168, Speaker C: And now I have Sebastian from Spain.
00:44:48.264 - 00:45:00.752, Speaker B: And Chris from New York. Both create their concepts here, Sebastian, Spain, New York, and I'm in Buenos Aires. So let's see, contacts in different parts of the world.
00:45:00.806 - 00:45:03.824, Speaker A: Now, how can I interact with a.
00:45:03.862 - 00:45:05.904, Speaker C: Contact that is already deployed?
00:45:06.032 - 00:45:18.312, Speaker B: First of all, I need the address of this content. Second, I need the ABI, the application binary interface. It means that the definition of the.
00:45:18.366 - 00:45:21.928, Speaker C: Functions that I have in our case.
00:45:22.014 - 00:45:29.932, Speaker B: For example, if I go to remix in the solid compiler, I can get.
00:45:29.986 - 00:45:38.130, Speaker C: The ABI, for example, and here, this is the ABI in our case, because.
00:45:38.580 - 00:45:47.248, Speaker B: We are using the same source code, we have the same API, and we can interact with any contact.
00:45:47.414 - 00:45:53.412, Speaker C: If you have the address and is using the same source code, in our.
00:45:53.466 - 00:46:05.160, Speaker B: Case, I'm coming back to deploying the transactions. I just copied the address of Sebastian. So this is the address of his.
00:46:05.230 - 00:46:07.800, Speaker C: Content, is this Sebastian?
00:46:10.700 - 00:46:42.950, Speaker B: And then I will not deploy a content again. I will use this other function here, this other feature, add address. I paste the address of Sebastian, content, click on add address. And now I have two instances of register. First is mine, second is from Sebastian. Let's see which information Sebastian saves in his content.
00:46:43.720 - 00:46:44.640, Speaker A: Hackathon.
00:46:44.720 - 00:46:50.230, Speaker B: Yes, I love this. Let's go. Amazing. Sebastian, I love this information.
00:46:52.600 - 00:46:53.380, Speaker A: But I.
00:46:53.450 - 00:46:58.330, Speaker C: Changed your information, so was here.
00:46:58.860 - 00:47:10.830, Speaker B: Sorry that I changed your information, Sebastian. Maybe we can put it back later, but I'm changing the information in your concept now.
00:47:19.560 - 00:47:22.904, Speaker C: Confirming, and this is the point, we.
00:47:22.942 - 00:47:29.236, Speaker B: Are in a network. We can interact with any Ismat concept that is deploying the network.
00:47:29.348 - 00:47:32.872, Speaker C: If you know this address, and it.
00:47:32.926 - 00:48:14.984, Speaker B: Seems that it's confirmed, yes, I changed his information. So this is to you to reflect about another point. Permissions, access. You must take care of this when you are deploying a smart contract. Be sure that when you are deploying a smart contract, only the people, only the address that are authorized can, for example, change information. This is so important, and I'm not teaching here how to do this, but I will share some information to you.
00:48:15.102 - 00:48:16.890, Speaker C: To understand this better.
00:48:18.380 - 00:48:20.472, Speaker B: Like I said before, I'd like to.
00:48:20.526 - 00:48:24.250, Speaker C: See the Chris content as well.
00:48:27.020 - 00:48:29.870, Speaker B: Again, a new address.
00:48:30.960 - 00:48:36.204, Speaker C: Paste the address of Chris content, click on ET address.
00:48:36.402 - 00:48:41.040, Speaker B: Now I have a three mining Sebastian Chris.
00:48:41.700 - 00:48:45.810, Speaker C: Let's see what Chris has.
00:48:46.980 - 00:48:57.652, Speaker B: Constellation hackathon Chris. Oh amazing. And IU change to the same.
00:48:57.786 - 00:49:00.390, Speaker A: So was here.
00:49:03.260 - 00:49:04.570, Speaker C: You can change.
00:49:12.150 - 00:49:12.562, Speaker A: And.
00:49:12.616 - 00:49:14.850, Speaker B: We are waiting this confirmation.
00:49:17.190 - 00:49:19.700, Speaker A: I place.
00:49:24.490 - 00:49:31.174, Speaker B: Of solidity. So here we have the register learn.
00:49:31.212 - 00:49:31.910, Speaker A: Switch.
00:49:37.500 - 00:49:44.332, Speaker B: Repo, a basic repo with this register. But I have the 15 versions of.
00:49:44.386 - 00:49:48.352, Speaker C: This to you learn in register one.
00:49:48.486 - 00:50:02.420, Speaker B: Is exactly this what we did now. But you can understand other types of variables, other concepts here, conditions, modifiers, events.
00:50:03.000 - 00:50:09.270, Speaker C: Arrays, structures, access control like allow list.
00:50:09.800 - 00:50:26.200, Speaker B: And maybe you can study this later to understand a bit more. For example, let's go to content eight, nine. Yes, let's go to eleven. If I go to eleven.
00:50:28.300 - 00:50:32.972, Speaker C: Yes, to.
00:50:33.026 - 00:50:37.310, Speaker B: Control who can write in my content, for example.
00:50:38.320 - 00:50:39.870, Speaker C: And you can have.
00:50:43.220 - 00:50:59.860, Speaker B: You can have the same value. So this is my goal for now to take the base of solidity how to use remix and smart context.
00:51:02.120 - 00:51:06.730, Speaker C: Let's go to Jiminy documentation as well.
00:51:09.900 - 00:51:20.670, Speaker B: Amazing information here related to data feed, ccap, data streams, functions, automation, VRF also.
00:51:21.200 - 00:51:24.504, Speaker C: If you go to the developer hub.
00:51:24.632 - 00:51:28.300, Speaker A: Let'S here developer.
00:51:31.040 - 00:51:32.130, Speaker B: Change link.
00:51:32.820 - 00:51:36.530, Speaker C: You have more information that can help you.
00:51:39.060 - 00:51:43.520, Speaker B: Understand. Learn how to build like a prediction.
00:51:43.600 - 00:52:01.144, Speaker C: App and you have more resources, not only the documentation you see that I'd like to know more about CCAP here I can see some guides, tutorials for.
00:52:01.182 - 00:52:17.790, Speaker B: Beginners, videos, different videos like workshops and concepts as well all the documentation, articles, ideas and this can help you a lot.
00:52:18.960 - 00:52:19.710, Speaker A: So.
00:52:22.980 - 00:52:26.400, Speaker C: For example, oh, now I can.
00:52:26.550 - 00:52:30.630, Speaker B: Create a batch of oh, this is interesting.
00:52:31.800 - 00:52:38.004, Speaker C: Let's see about data services now and.
00:52:38.042 - 00:53:00.796, Speaker B: Again like a lot of quick stats and guides and tutorials of data feeds and videos, documentations, blogs and I think this is the most important to you to understand what happened and how can we go forward.
00:53:00.898 - 00:53:05.996, Speaker C: Also remember that the hackathon itself we.
00:53:06.018 - 00:53:07.500, Speaker B: Are just in the beginning.

Today we are here tomorrow you can create crosschain NFTs, you can create crosschain applications. And also we have deep dive with functions. And you have different workshops for you to prepare you to create an amazing.
