00:00:09.770 - 00:00:40.394, Speaker A: Great. Welcome to this afternoon's, at least for me, at least I'm on the east coast. So this afternoon's webinar on tech talk on tokenizing real world assets on chain. We're going to let people get a few minutes to come on into the room here. So please make yourselves comfortable. You've got a minute to relax before we jump in and meet our guests and talk about this really exciting opportunity. All right, I think we're going to go ahead and introduce the folks, and we're going to move in as people are kind of trumbling into the room.
00:00:40.394 - 00:01:11.394, Speaker A: So thanks again for joining. My name is William Herkleroff. I'm an MD here at Chainlink Labs, focusing on a variety of different areas, but specifically trying to help us grow into new market areas. And so this is an exciting new market area that we're going to talk about today, the tokenization of real world assets on chain. My guests today are Patrick O'Meara, chairman and CEO of Invinium, and Brian Hinke, co founder of Cash Gold. Patrick, welcome. Thank you.
00:01:11.432 - 00:01:12.334, Speaker B: Good to be here, buddy.
00:01:12.382 - 00:01:30.934, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, awesome. Patrick was kind enough to invite me to this conference in Miami a few weeks back, and it was quite the show. I appreciated the opportunity to be there with the mayors of Miami and New York and everybody else. It was really a great gig. And welcome to you as well, Brian. Thank you for joining.
00:01:31.062 - 00:01:32.540, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:01:32.990 - 00:02:21.274, Speaker A: Great. So I think if we've got folks, enough folks on the panel, what we're going to do today here is we're going to do a quick presentation, just a few slides, to kind of set the scene for what tokenization is. I do suspect that most of the people listening in probably already know it. So I'm not going to try to be too basic, but I do want to make sure some basic rules and context of what we're talking about today are set. Talk a little bit about what some of the challenges are, particularly around validating and ensuring that things aren't being double spent, among other things. And then we're going to jump in, we're going to come back to these amazing gentlemen and talk a little bit more about their specific projects and learn how they are tackling exactly the challenges that we've laid out in those slides. So with the controller of the slides, please move us forward.
00:02:21.274 - 00:03:11.366, Speaker A: Thank you. Great. So, first and foremost, what is asset tokenization? And I think in its most basic way of thinking about it, it is simply a digital representation of any physical asset. And that might seem a little overly simplistic. But if I, for example, have, I don't know, 20 cubic yards of land that has a certain amount of ore in the ground that could potentially be tokenized, a home could potentially be tokenized. A stock or a collection of stocks could be one Apple stock or a collection of 20 apple stocks, or a collection of an entire tech portfolio. Any physical asset that exists in some other area can be tokenized, created as a token, and validated and verified on chain.
00:03:11.366 - 00:03:50.706, Speaker A: We're going to talk about several of those use cases today, but there are some benefits to this. There are some challenges, as we mentioned, to this as well. And the benefits in particular are liquidity, accessibility, transparency, and composability. So what do any of these things mean? First, I like to actually start with accessibility. Those of us who are fortunate enough, I think, to live in a place like New York, it's not difficult for me to go buy a stock of apple. It's not difficult for me to buy a gold fund. It's not difficult for me necessarily to access a variety of interesting investment opportunities.
00:03:50.706 - 00:04:40.018, Speaker A: But that's not the case for literally billions of people around the planet. It is not so easy for people just to say, oh, I want to have some exposure to apple stock, or I want to have some exposure to gold. I want to have some exposure to some of these really interesting and fascinating opportunities, because they simply don't have the kind of systems in place, the brokerage houses and the banks and everything they would need to actually participate. Whereas if there is a token that's sitting on chain that absolutely represents that physical asset one to one, or whatever the ratio, predetermined ratio was. You know that you can get involved in these assets and potential appreciation of these assets without necessarily having to have all that infrastructure in your place of origin. It's also incredibly transparent. Skipping over to zero three, you know exactly what it is, you have, you know exactly what it represents at all times.
00:04:40.018 - 00:05:13.502, Speaker A: You can even know exactly which wallet it's sitting in. And you can verify that it's not moving. If it's done right, you can verify that there's not been double counting, that this asset isn't owned by multiple parties. If it's done right, you can also be sure that the underlying asset hasn't in fact, moved, and it's still there physically representing the token that you would be in charge of. Sorry, if you could stay on that screen again. Liquidity is a huge advantage as well. Specifically, if you've got a token, let's say, of a house, but it's an incredibly expensive house.
00:05:13.502 - 00:06:47.498, Speaker A: If someone wants to invest, you could offer liquidity by having 1000 or 10,000 or even 100,000 different people invest and fractionalize it and split into different, into smaller chunks, so that we can participate in some really interesting type of opportunities that we would never be able to participate in individually. And lastly, on composability, you can build an interesting basket of options. If once something has been broken down into tokens, then someone can create a basket of art and cars and real estate or whatever else, and then you can participate in a multi variant strategy, rather than just being physically associated with one and only one asset. So there's a lot of fun things that can be done in this world that we're all excited to explore. Next slide, quick little plug on the chain link side of things. Where do we come in? As many people on listening in might know, we are a platform, an oracle platform, and specifically a network of node validators and operators, including the likes of Swisscom, of Deutsche Telecom, of LexisNexis Infira, and many, many others who can independently validate information on our network and ensure that tokens are correctly being both instantiated originally without those values, as well as monitored based on those values. So we're that link between the tokens themselves and the data that's coming and flowing from all of the different off chain resources.
00:06:47.498 - 00:08:05.858, Speaker A: So, for example, it could be whether or not trees in a forest still exist, and if they do, then a carbon asset that's been tokenized, or carbon capture, effectively asset that's been tokenized can continue paying dividends as long as the data is validates. Then in fact this exists, as we're going to learn about today. It can also be quite simply the fact that a bar of gold still exists and it's still physically sitting where it's supposed to be, or bill of lading, or whatever else that is, the underwriting asset for a given token that can be validated constantly and monitored by the chainlink network. If you want to give us one more slide, we'll wrap up right here. And this offers, I think, an important part of plays an important part in the ecosystem, specifically around that transparency. As we mentioned, it also helps to prevent systemic failures, chances of hacking, people getting in and saying, well, actually there's three times more of this asset, or there's six times more, or in fact, the asset doesn't exist. All of those attack vectors can be thwarted if you're using an oracle network which has multiple node networks, multiple node operators who are all independently validating that a certain item is either true or false.
00:08:05.858 - 00:09:14.314, Speaker A: And if they all confirm that an item is in fact true, the likelihood of them all being down at the same time is close to zero. And the chance of them all being hacked at the same time, of course, is close to zero. So ensuring that you get that absolute proof that in fact an asset is real, that it's properly in existence, and that it hasn't been changed since the initial minting, will allow you effectively to feel extremely secure that these tokens that you're trading with are in fact real and have genuine value. The last point we're going to make here, before we go off to our panel, is also the benefits of knowing that when you're working with this type of solution, you don't necessarily need to be on a particular blockchain. You can be future proofed in that decision. One of the huge advantages of using a network provider like a chainlink is that as long as our node providers and our node operators are on chain x, y, z, or whatever else, the information can be shared across those chains. Those tokens can both effectively be traded eventually across chains.
00:09:14.314 - 00:09:52.150, Speaker A: The information that's available can be traded across chains, and you can also pull data in from different data sources that are sitting on different chains. So it really helps people to not necessarily need to know what they need to build on today, knowing that it can build on whatever they'd like. Or maybe three years from now there'll be a new platform, but whatever they're doing today will easily work in that new environment. So enough about us, enough about the basic concepts. I really want to learn more about the gentlemen that are on the call today. So I'm just going to go through the notes that I have here in front of me, and apologies if I'm looking to my left. I'm going to start with Patrick.
00:09:52.150 - 00:10:05.200, Speaker A: Welcome again to the podcast. Really interesting to hear from you today. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, a little bit about, you know, what's it like to be CEO of a major company? Patrick, let us know.
00:10:06.050 - 00:10:51.094, Speaker B: Well, first off, thanks for having me. Pat O'mera. I'm the chairman and CEO of Invenium and I love that you describe us as a major company that's pretty know we view ourselves as a startup and a scrappy startup. Even though we're growing for this last six years and focused on tokenization and the data associated with the asset. And if the asset has no entropy, meaning bitcoin or Ethereum, there's no entropy in what that is. There might be entropy in the network, but not in bitcoin or ethereum. But if there's a physical asset for which entropy exists.
00:10:51.094 - 00:11:19.654, Speaker B: So think of an infrastructure asset, think of a private equity asset, think of a real estate asset. You need to be able to prove the state of that asset so you can value that asset, so you can price the capital stack, so you can trade the capital. So invenium is really focused on, right, the ability to provide real time surveillance by a digital instrument to an asset, so you can understand the condition of that asset, so you can value it.
00:11:19.852 - 00:11:33.100, Speaker A: That's great. And we're also going to welcome Brian Hinke. Great to have you on today. Brian, would you mind telling us a few minutes about yourself and cash gold and what brings you here today? Sure.
00:11:33.630 - 00:12:26.140, Speaker C: Well, I started off my career in corporate finance for big publicly traded companies. Then I did an MBA, and then I started my own software development company, which I was working on till late 2016. And I got really interested in blockchain. Then I kind of knew about it, knew about bitcoin. But when I started to learn about smart contracts, I was really fascinated by this technology and kind of the potential to maybe use it to make things more transparent, more universal. All of the things that you discussed in your introductory presentation there. And I had known the other founder of the company, Gregor, for many years because I used to invest in gold through his company.
00:12:26.140 - 00:12:50.994, Speaker C: And I kind of pitched the idea to him that we should create gold backed tokens. And he said, yeah, he had been thinking about doing that, too. And based on his background in having created a vault in Singapore and many years of experience in trading precious metals, it was really the right person to start the company with.
00:12:51.192 - 00:12:51.986, Speaker A: Great.
00:12:52.168 - 00:12:54.930, Speaker C: We started it in 2018.
00:12:57.110 - 00:13:13.900, Speaker A: I'm going to stick with that because you just mentioned something. Can you tell us a little bit more about. So what is that? What does that mean exactly? So you're going tokenize gold. What does that process actually look like in order for that to work on a blockchain? Why do that on a blockchain? I think both of those are interesting questions.
00:13:14.990 - 00:14:19.578, Speaker C: Well, I would say because of the transparency and the immutability of the transactions, but we started from kind of a different perspective, I think, than many other products out there, in that we wanted to begin by figuring out how do we track the assets and how do we prove that the data is reliable. So we started off and we actually created a company called Gramchain first, and we developed this asset tracking system that could be used to track assets for tokenization, but for also many other reasons like collateralization or doing swaps, trustless swaps, across distance. And once we had created that asset tracking platform, then we built a token on top of it. And the difference there is that it allowed us to provide real time tracking data secured by the blockchain on all of the gold that backs the token.
00:14:19.754 - 00:14:32.978, Speaker A: Great. So I'm just trying to try to guess. So you've got gold that's sitting in a. I guess someone somewhere is sitting in a vault that maybe has a barcode or something. You're scanning it and every time you scan it, it turns into a token. Something along those lines, yeah.
00:14:33.064 - 00:15:30.310, Speaker C: So we give the vaults that store the gold a scanner, which is basically an Android device, a lightly modified Android device that has an RFID scanner. And they attach an RFID tag to each bar. They put it in a tamper proof bag after they test it and weigh it. And they use the scanner to log this bar into the system and then assign the use case or the custodian for it. And then all of that data gets timestamped on the blockchain and it becomes public virtually in real time. So people can always see, where are the bars? What type of bars are they? What's the purity, what's the weight? When did they come in? When did they leave? If they were redeemed? And that's all provided by the vaults. We can't manipulate that data or change it or anything.
00:15:30.310 - 00:15:53.226, Speaker C: The only thing that we can do is once the vault has assigned the bar to us as a custodian, then we can set the use case. And in the case of the token, it's either locked or it's unlocked. If it's locked, it can be used to create tokens. If it's unlocked, it can be withdrawn. That's kind of how it works at a high level.
00:15:53.408 - 00:16:25.910, Speaker A: Okay, I've got a few more questions, but I'm going to try to mix it up and I'm going to switch back over to pat and we'll come back and get more into that story. So you used some terms that I'm not super familiar with when you talked earlier, specifically entropy. I feel like that's a term that I find in crossword puzzles and I think I know what it means, but can you just go a little more into detail again? So what's a good example of something that is being tokenized on NVM today? And whether that has entropy or not, you have to explain to me what that might mean. Yeah.
00:16:25.980 - 00:18:01.910, Speaker B: So entropy is a concept that systems break down, right? So it doesn't matter how perfectly made the boiler is, over time, steam engines will break down, and all systems and processes break down over time. So the dollar yen trade, even though it lasted forever, eventually entropy happened and that trade died, right? So they talk about entropy in an asset like a building. So if you don't maintain the building, it breaks down over time because of the elements, the mechanical systems break down. Does that make sense? And so entropy is the breaking down of a system of process or an asset. And so one bitcoin is always one bitcoin, but if you buy a building and you don't maintain it, it begins to degrade, right? And so you need to be able to, if you have a digital instrument that represents ownership, right? So think of the token. The token's rights to the asset have to be legally defined, right? And that legal definition, typically, when people say, what's the operating system in venium? We typically say, jokingly, the chance record of the state of Delaware, or english common law, meaning that token represents a legal contract, or right, or interest or share or note or bond or whatever it might be. So that represents that and that token, it's a new form of stock certification, but because it's digital, we can have it accessing data in real time.
00:18:01.910 - 00:19:15.806, Speaker B: So it used to be that you had a stack of documents and then you'd go send somebody to tell you how your asset is doing. Now, those documents are all attached to the token, and that token can real time look into the data systems of that asset itself. An office building, a port, an airport, a toll road, and you can see things like foot traffic, you can see rent payments, all of those types of things. And so what happens is you can see real time how that data is evidencing the performance of the asset, rent payments coming in, foot traffic in the mall, tolls being paid on a toll road. And so what happens is you don't necessarily want to put all that data on the blockchain, but what you want to do is you want to credential that data, because if all assets, all physical assets, are eventually going to be tokenized, you need one of two things, the world's largest database, or you need to be able to make data composable at the edge so that it can be read by smart contracts. And that's what invenium does. So you own a building, and rather than sending your data to a database that is pulled from, you're making like a LinkedIn page for your building.
00:19:15.806 - 00:19:25.890, Speaker B: Right. You're credentialing the data at its source and then inventing them to the mechanism by which that data can be understood and processed through a smart contract.
00:19:26.390 - 00:19:48.022, Speaker A: That sounds like probably a pretty important use case for independent validation, I'm guessing, right? Because otherwise, the flow of that data is absolutely critical to whether or not the asset is shown on chain of having value. Controlling that flow and ensuring that flow is secure, I'm guessing, is probably one of the single most important things you guys need to do. Yeah.
00:19:48.076 - 00:20:38.550, Speaker B: So, in accounting, that's called observability, right? The observability of the inputs. Because if you are a corporation and you have a bunch of assets on your balance sheet, if you're not able to prove to your auditors real time the source of the data and the provenance of it, they impair that asset from what's called level one, a liquid asset, to level two, a market alternative to all the way. Level three, an illiquid asset. And what that means is you discount the value on your balance sheet dramatically. But if we can have real time information about the performance of that asset, and the input is observable, and you have sophisticated model, and in your period comp, suddenly I'm a big corporation, I can carry that asset at full price. So it unlocks enormous value. So your ability to borrow against it goes up.
00:20:38.550 - 00:21:33.802, Speaker B: The ability to trade against it goes up. There's third party marks, and it just makes the market that much more efficient, because you have the ability to get real time data on the performance of that asset. And if there's not good data, one of the two things happen. Either there's a diminution of the price, a lack of data discount, or if people don't trust the data enough, they just leave the market altogether. And what we're doing is giving you good data to entice institutional investors to look at all sorts of assets that they haven't looked at historically on an atomic basis or individual basis. Instead of wrapped up in a big securitization and the discounts that happen, people can rely on them. If there's a discount on a real estate building in New York, because you don't trust the data in midtown Manhattan, on a skyscraper, you might discount at 5% or 7%.
00:21:33.802 - 00:21:50.202, Speaker B: But if it's in Malaysia, in Kuala Lumpur, all of a sudden, you might discount at 30% to 35%. Does that make sense? Because you're not sure about the macro market, and you're much more focused on the individual dress. So bad data has huge impact.
00:21:50.346 - 00:22:18.470, Speaker A: Okay. It's obviously an area for folks that are very well attuned to that market. I'm guessing that if I am a developer or if I am trying to get into that space, I can come to you to find clients or to find tool set, or to find opportunities to build in new areas. What's the first thing I'm going to find when I come out and interact with your team? Sure.
00:22:18.540 - 00:22:52.958, Speaker B: So typically we say that price discovery, we think is the killer app for blockchain on why enterprises are going to use it. Big corporations are all going to go to blockchain because they can prove the validity of the data, so they can price assets more effectively, so they can carry them on their balance sheet correctly. So usually we have large asset owners. And so a, we call this the pathway to liquidity. Number one, better accounting treatment. Number two, the regulators give you better regulatory capital release. Number three, you can borrow against it, better collateralization.
00:22:52.958 - 00:23:58.482, Speaker B: Then there'll be secondary trading, and then lastly new novel forms of distribution. But it all starts with accounting treatment, where you can prove the value of the asset. So a guy who's already got a great asset, but it's being held at a lower amount, he wants to prove, this is my great asset, right? And then people who are regulated, all of a sudden they can go to the regulator and say, hey, regulator, you always gave me a discount because you didn't trust my balance sheet. I can prove to you the value of this asset, right? And so this is where tokenization is unlocking value for large corporations, individuals who have assets tied up in illiquid things, real estate, right, that typically they could borrow at very depressed full value appraisals because they can only borrow 40, 50, 60% against the value of that asset. And why? Because the bank themselves has to haircut what that value is, because they need to make sure they're covered.
00:23:58.626 - 00:24:23.970, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that validation, it's obviously critical without an independent validation, without the validation layer, without the truth is bigger than trust, which is kind of one of our slogans here at chainlink. You actually can't function. The market literally cannot function because you can't under collateralize anything if in fact you can't prove that it's there. So it's critical for you. I'm kind of curious. I'm going to switch back over to Brian.
00:24:23.970 - 00:24:37.910, Speaker A: I think my biggest concern might be, I guess, double counting things of this nature. So how important is independent validation in your world? And is there something again that you guys are doing that sets you apart.
00:24:39.850 - 00:25:03.680, Speaker C: Well, that really goes back to the whole point of gram chain. The scanners, as I mentioned, they're operated only by the vaults. And we work with accredited vaults like Brinks and Loomis. And these companies, that's what they do. They store assets. They're insured to do it. They're independently audited as well.
00:25:03.680 - 00:25:45.514, Speaker C: So the fact that only they can add the data to log the bars in and out has a high level of. What am I trying to say here? It's very reliable data. And then, of course, there's no reason you can't also do another independent audit on top of that, which we did at the end of last year, just to validate the system. And we used bureau Veritas for that. So you can still do traditional audits. It's just basically another layer of data, and it's more detailed, there's more detail in it, and it's real time. So you can always do a periodic audit to validate this data.
00:25:45.514 - 00:25:52.060, Speaker C: But we think it's extremely reliable data that has good processes built in place.
00:25:52.590 - 00:25:53.462, Speaker A: That's excellent.
00:25:53.526 - 00:26:33.254, Speaker B: And can I piggyback off that, william? So I think that one of the things that you can do is when you're talking about, know, proof of a. Right, we can prove that this process happened, or proof of source. Right, an Iot sensor, et cetera. But when you're looking at data and the origin of data, one of the things that happens when you move data, it changes. So, invenium, what we do is we go to the system that creates the data. And the moment it's created, we run a shawl 256. We create a hash stick, that hash in the payload of a block with information about how it was created, who was the individual, who put the data in, et cetera.
00:26:33.254 - 00:27:08.262, Speaker B: And because it's contemporaneous with the data creation, if somebody changes it in the future and you pull that data up, those hashes won't match. Does that make sense? So you're literally going to be able to say, hey, this has been altered, we're going to be able to prove it. And so fraud can still happen, but it has to be pre planned way before the data goes into the system. Right. And what you're doing is you're creating an audit trail to catch the person when fraud gets identified. So what you're doing is you're creating a limited window for opportunity. Right.
00:27:08.262 - 00:28:00.120, Speaker B: There's no happenstances opportunities for fraud. It has to be planned years in advance. And if you can use tools like iot sensors, foot traffic sensors, motion activated sensors all the way to water meters with toilet flushes, the ability to fake data. They look at toilet flushes as a proxy for occupation of a building, right, how full it is. And if you can have iot sensors, motion sensors, and toilet flushes, as well as electricity usage, you can tell pretty much exactly how often that building is being used. Do you know what I mean? And you correlate those data elements, anchor them into the payload of a block, and you can paint a picture that it's really hard to spoof or fake. Does that make sense?
00:28:00.810 - 00:28:02.978, Speaker A: It does. You lost me at toilet flushes.
00:28:02.994 - 00:28:55.190, Speaker C: But other than generally speaking, I would add to that we do exactly the same thing, that there's this audit trail. So if a mistake or fraudulent transaction does happen, it's going to be detected, it's going to be known who did it, when they did it, where they did it. If there's too high a data error rate at a vault, then it's going to be addressed. And if it's a fraud, then that's going to be figured out very quickly. And the window of opportunity to catch them is unlimited, because this data is stored forever in the blockchain. But with commercial vaults that store gold, it's very unlikely for them to misappropriate the funds because their business is simply storage of assets. That's all they do.
00:28:55.190 - 00:29:17.182, Speaker C: They're not like a fund or kind of financial industry where they can take the assets and kind of gamble them or rehypothecate them. They really just keep the assets secure. So the rate of fraud in a commercial vault like Loomis is going to be exceedingly low if it happens at all.
00:29:17.316 - 00:29:34.900, Speaker A: Right? And I'm guessing that the chainlink proof of reserve solution is playing an important role in all of this. Right? It's keeping taps on exactly the amount that's in the vault, ensuring that you don't ever over mint things of that nature. Is that what intrigued you the most about it?
00:29:35.770 - 00:30:29.874, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, that just adds another layer of security and protection, because now you have 16 independent nodes that are validating this data and recording it and setting it in stone above and beyond, just simply embedding a hash in the blockchain. So it's basically impossible if an error or mistake or a fraud does happen, to sweep it under the rug, you just can't do it. And then, of course, there's the benefit that these nodes and the chain link technology can make the data available across multiple chains. So if we want to expand onto other blockchains. It's a good way to do it. But yeah, as you mentioned, the smart contracts don't allow the minting of tokens unless there's locked gold, which is more than the number of tokens outstanding.
00:30:29.874 - 00:30:43.526, Speaker C: So if there's 100,000 tokens and there's 110,000 grams of gold locked in the vault, then you can mint 10,000 tokens, but you cannot mint more. It's simply not allowed by the smart contract.
00:30:43.718 - 00:31:03.140, Speaker A: That's fantastic. I imagine the percentage of total gold that's tokenized today is probably very little, and so the market opportunity is huge. What are some bold predictions as far as your thoughts as to what you guys are going to see happen in the market in the next couple of years?
00:31:04.630 - 00:31:55.070, Speaker C: Well, I think tokenization will obviously be used a lot more, especially for gold and precious metals, because they really lend themselves to that use case. It's a lot easier than something like a building, but I think there'll also be a lot more growth in non fungible assets and the use of NFTs not just to represent digital goods, but to represent real goods of all kinds, whether that's buildings or cars or artworks. The vast majority of the NFTs out there are just, they're backed only by some kind of digital good or digital intellectual property or something. And there hasn't been a lot of usage yet of physical goods. But I think that's where there'll be a lot of growth.
00:31:55.730 - 00:32:43.360, Speaker A: And I'm guessing that the system that, I guess both Pat's system and your system and the proof of reserve system would play, I think, a critical role in all that growth as well. I mean, there's no reason why what you've done for vertical X couldn't necessarily apply to these other areas, if I'm correct. Yeah, that's great. Just quick aside, years ago I went to a conference and somebody talked about tokenizing gold already in the ground as a way of raising money, basically selling the gold already in the ground based on estimates at like X percent at a discount or something, so they could raise the money that they would need to then go and mine it or something like that. Is that a thing? Are people doing this? If you run into that? I know that's out of left field, but it seems it has an interesting potential derivation of what you're talking about.
00:32:44.930 - 00:33:37.618, Speaker C: I've heard it done and I've heard it discussed. I don't know a lot about specific cases. I think that would be something that would be a lot more for Patrick's company than ours. I do know there's a company called Tradewinds that has a permission blockchain that has a gold token which, if I remember and understand correctly, it's backed by above ground gold. But it could be gold that's in any kind of state, like a work in process. It could be on its way to being refined, or it could be not yet minted or cast into a final product. And I think they were cooperating with a canadian mint or maybe UK mint on that.
00:33:37.618 - 00:33:50.100, Speaker C: But I think it's coming. But it becomes more complicated because of all of the legal ramifications and how it's more difficult to prove what's actually backing it. And so.
00:33:50.570 - 00:34:08.140, Speaker A: So let's spend a couple of minutes on that then, and I'll switch back to you, Patrick. We talked about all the benefits. I think everyone's sold on the benefits. I'm sold on the benefits. Obviously, we all believe in the benefits. We wouldn't work where we work. What are the challenges that you're seeing on your side again? You had this amazing conference about a month back.
00:34:08.140 - 00:34:23.380, Speaker A: The room was packed. A lot of really big name companies there. I'm guessing they're not all 100% on board and tokenizing already, right? So they're going to see some challenges. What challenges do you see in your space that you are helping these companies through?
00:34:26.790 - 00:35:11.566, Speaker B: That's a broad question, and let me kind of narrow it down to a couple discrete answers. The first is most of our clients today, we, in our sales pitch, don't mention the word blockchain at all. Just like, because what we're doing is we're solving a pain point in their business. So Oracle does not go out selling SQL databases. They're selling enterprise systems that deliver outcomes for their clients. So what we're doing is when we come into our clients, we talk about better data, data provenance, the ability to prove observability, better balance sheet treatment. And when they go on to this, we say, great, they're doing that.
00:35:11.566 - 00:35:50.700, Speaker B: And then they realize they've begun a process of anchoring data to a chain that can then be linked to a digital instrument which represents the capital stack. Now, the devil and the Holy Spirit are in the details. And this is not just a technology problem, it's a legal problem where that technology represents an interest in an asset and it has to be able to be perfected in a manner where that data that's being processed either in legacy systems or smart contracts. Because if a smart contract is automating and cutting out middlemen while still performing middle function. You need to be able to prove that the data being processed is good data.
00:35:52.830 - 00:36:16.242, Speaker A: No, I'm just going to say, but I guess this already happens today. What I love about this thing is this is a process that already has to happen. It's not like you're inventing. You're just moving this into, and you're doing it in a more efficient way. Right. So today, how does that actually function? Today, they actually have to send someone out. What is the manual process that's happening today? That's going to be replaced by this system.
00:36:16.376 - 00:36:59.054, Speaker B: So we have one of the largest asset managers in the world as a client, right? And they come in and they are for their real estate funds that they manage on behalf of third parties. They send somebody, and they get an annual audit or valuation on their building. And literally, they manage many trillions of dollars, and they have gotten the price down to $16,000 a mark or valuation. What we do is, because we onboard that building, we use our software, we can feed that data real time. We hash it into the payload of a block. We use very basic robotic process automation. We push it into the valuation tools.
00:36:59.054 - 00:37:47.934, Speaker B: We get them out of data collection and data entry. Kutchman, JLL, CBRE, Hulahan, Loki. And they can now do a mark for $1,000. So instead of 16,000, where they're going collecting raw documents, bringing it and looking at it, they can not only see every previous quarter's mark, they're now giving a mark instead of 16,000 for 1000. And what happens is, for that company that used to get one mark a year, all of a sudden they're getting four marks. And every piece of data that is going into a unique cell, they can see the in period data. But not only that, the formula from which it was derived and the instrument from which they extracted that data element and prove that that was the correct data at the time of data extraction.
00:37:47.934 - 00:38:23.078, Speaker B: So what this does is it provides total provenance to the data elements going into the calculation. So this is keeping the asset ready for sale every day of the week. Right. Because the data is 100% auditable all the way through. And because we can automate this, they can get more frequent marks with total observability for less money. And so, literally, including this cost of our software, they get four marks a year for literally $6,000 less per building than they were getting previously, even though they were the biggest asset manager in the world.
00:38:23.264 - 00:38:53.942, Speaker A: Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. So whatever legal and regulatory hurdles already exist. The only thing that you're doing is you have to convince all those parties that the data coming through the system is just as good as the manual verification that they were getting. In fact, it's going to be better because you're going to have multiple sources, you're going to have the provenance, you're going to have the digital certificate, you're going to have it in proof that it hasn't changed. You can use the chain link node network if you need to have independent validation. So you're actually going to be above and beyond what, a manual? Correct.
00:38:53.996 - 00:39:26.542, Speaker B: So most of what we're replacing is an Excel spreadsheet driven system. Even though these are the largest system companies in the world, literally, Excel is 80% of the time. And what we're doing is automating where middleware is an accountant and a piece of paper. Right. And what we're doing is we're going directly to the data systems, hashing into the payload of the block and extracting the data element, pushing it into the calculation tool, and there's less chance of what's called fat fingering a calculation. Right. You hit the wrong key, et cetera.
00:39:26.606 - 00:39:26.882, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:26.936 - 00:40:11.018, Speaker B: And there's very famous examples of this, right? The chief investment officer for the pension plan, state pension plan for the state of Pennsylvania, was fired for misappropriating funds. And what they found is three years prior, there'd been a fat finger, and it took them a million man hours to find the error. A million man hours, right. That they were paying 300 hundred four, because it was a law firm doing it per hour. And they eventually uncovered it, they identified it. They spent literally two to $300 million identifying a manual data entry error. And what we do is we automate that, calculate it, and if there's a break in the calculation, it's immediately flagged.
00:40:11.018 - 00:40:30.438, Speaker B: This seems out of band. This seems a little bit wide for the system. So large banks who are looking at collateralization for their loans and looking the underlying asset, if there's a number that seems out of sequence, it immediately red flags a human being to come in and put a second set of eyes on it.
00:40:30.604 - 00:40:49.834, Speaker A: So we got some questions flowing in from the audience. We only have a few minutes left. I don't know if we advertise this as 45 minutes approximately for the viewers. We might run a few minutes over because this is really actually pretty great. And we've got a lot of questions. I want to switch back to Brian really quick. Some of the questions that are coming in are actually from the retail side, which I think is interesting.
00:40:49.834 - 00:41:19.800, Speaker A: And it's just kind of about the flow of. Okay, so I own this token. Can it be converted at some point to actual delivery of gold? What happens if, God forbid, you guys were to choose to stop operating or choose to change your business model and go do something else? What does tokenization offer when it comes to security for the end holder of the token in your. Was that was for Brian. Sorry.
00:41:20.490 - 00:42:09.126, Speaker C: Well, that's a lot to cover in one question, but I'll try. So yes, they're redeemable. They're designed to be redeemable and especially redeemable in practical amounts. So we have bars as small as 100 grams, which is about $6,000, which compares with like industry standard 400 ounce bars, which are now nearing 800 900,000. And you can redeem them from any of the vaults in the system, which we're trying to add more. So eventually it's going to be distributed all over the globe. But right now we have Dubai, Zurich, Singapore, Dallas, and we'll be adding Frankfurt soon.
00:42:09.126 - 00:42:37.070, Speaker C: So you can either pick up your bar from most of the vaults or you can have it shipped to your home address, or you can redeem it and then sell it for USD. So that's encouraged. I mean, that's available on demand. We also accept gold deposits if they're on the list of our accepted gold and then create tokens on that. I think the other part of the question was how the tokens get created.
00:42:37.650 - 00:42:54.290, Speaker A: No, it was just like, I guess, do you guys have to be involved? So if they've purchased gold tokens through you and they want to go to one of your partners in the vault and they want to get physical delivery, are you involved in that relationship or can they just prove.
00:42:56.330 - 00:43:24.118, Speaker C: Kind of. Because we have to instruct them to do that, but the process is all automated. It's kind of like online shopping. So they go on our website, they log in, the system detects how many tokens they have in their wallet, and then they can just kind of pick the bars they want and then they're purchasing that bar. And the checkout process, instead of paying with a credit card, they pay with the tokens.
00:43:24.294 - 00:43:24.838, Speaker A: Right.
00:43:24.944 - 00:43:33.346, Speaker C: Then they choose whether they want to pick it up in person or whether they want to ship it, or whether they just want to receive the USD value in their bank account.
00:43:33.448 - 00:43:38.002, Speaker A: And there's no lockup, right. They can come in and out, whatever.
00:43:38.136 - 00:44:00.490, Speaker C: Absolutely. It's available on demand anytime. The whole concept of the system is for it to be freely convertible to and from tokens. And then I think they also asked, what happens if the company gets into trouble or something? Well, the company doesn't own the gold. The token holder owns the gold.
00:44:00.910 - 00:44:01.660, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:03.870 - 00:44:34.580, Speaker C: And the chain link, proof of reserve. And our smart contracts ensure that we can never issue more tokens than we have gold. So if we held some tokens, we could withdraw that gold. But if we don't hold tokens, we cannot withdraw the gold. It would be very difficult because of the way all the checks and balances and the smart contracts are set up. And if we did manage to do it, know, it would be theft, it would be fraud, and it would be detected quite quickly.
00:44:35.430 - 00:44:51.900, Speaker A: So just really quickly, we're going to finish up with Brian and then we'll switch back to Patrick. Any kind of advice for anyone listening today, if they're trying to get into your space, some thoughts about how to get started or how to either get started with you directly or in the metals area?
00:44:53.710 - 00:45:42.458, Speaker C: Well, yeah, two things. I mean, you need to think about how you're going to track the asset and how you're going to prove it. And of course, Gram chain is available to other companies who want to use it, or of course, they can create their own solution, but they need to have a solid way to track the asset and prove its existence and prove that it's not encumbered. The other thing that I think is extremely important is you have to choose your jurisdiction and your regulation, because if you're not properly regulated and compliant, you're not going to get anywhere. You're not going to get a bank account, you're not going to get listed on exchanges. In the worst case, you'll get shut down. But if you operate outside of a regulated environment or in a gray area, you will find it very difficult to do business.
00:45:42.458 - 00:45:46.540, Speaker C: So you need to do your legal research first before you start building.
00:45:47.630 - 00:46:02.080, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you so much then, Pat. There's several questions I don't know if you're following the chat. I think about. There's too many questions here. So picking the one or two that might be the most interesting. I mean, I think what I'm seeing here.
00:46:03.250 - 00:46:05.578, Speaker B: Can I answer the why blockchain?
00:46:05.674 - 00:46:08.146, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that one. I'll let you choose your own question. Yeah.
00:46:08.168 - 00:46:47.310, Speaker B: Is that all right? Because I think that's a great question. Right. Why blockchain? Why aren't you doing this in a centralized database? Right. And the answer is, if you want to sell the building in the future or you're going to fractionalize this, or these tokens are going to exist in multiple jurisdictions, and we can imagine where they're listed on bulletin boards or alternative trading systems or exchanges, and they're trading back and forth. You have to be able to commute trust in the performance data of the asset. And what we're doing is we're giving a real time digital notarization. And that's not saying the data is true.
00:46:47.310 - 00:47:12.066, Speaker B: It's saying this is the data. Just like when you go into a bank and you notarize something. They're not saying what you're saying is true, that you're signing just that you signed it on this date. What we're doing is saying, this is the information on this date. You can look at this information real time. You can see the historical, you can prove it hasn't been altered since moment of creation. And what that does is if it's in a single database that can be manipulated.
00:47:12.066 - 00:47:59.366, Speaker B: Right. And what we're doing is we're commuting trust in the performance data of the asset so that that can be connected to a digital instrument which represents a piece of the capital stack. And so what that does is, right now, real estate, you have 120 day diligence from the time you strike a price because you need to do an asbestos, a structural engineering, mechanical engineering reports, et cetera. But here, if you can look at their performance data on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly basis, and a third party has been validating it all the way along, you'll literally be able to take a piece of that and shorten that diligence to three to five days. So you're using blockchain to commute trust in underlying asset performance data, not just the ledger of ownership itself, does that make sense?
00:47:59.468 - 00:48:28.670, Speaker A: Does there's actually one more question that I'm going to leave you with. Is your last one on here that I thought was interesting, which is specific to the business model. Are retail investors coming to you to effectively purchase these things, or are platform developers and people who want to tokenize their assets coming to you as a platform for that process? So, specifically, who is it you're targeting and who's going to be the most interested in speaking with you?
00:48:28.820 - 00:49:10.678, Speaker B: So the people who hire us are typically the general partners in limited partnerships, where instead of them setting a mark on the asset, they're getting a third party to, and they're automating it so that their limited partners have more trust in them. So if I'm Calpers or cowsters or canadian pension plan and I want to put more money into alternatives. As a fiduciary, I can't. If the GP is setting the mark right, it's got to be a de minimis amount. But if there's a third party setting a monthly or quarterly amount as a fiduciary, they can allocate more to it. So the GP says to the big institutional LP, I can take more of your money. These marks aren't being set by me, they're being set up by Hula and Loki or CBRE.
00:49:10.678 - 00:49:38.040, Speaker B: And so we get hired by the GPs for the benefit of the LPs who want to buy it. Now, these will be listed on ATSs and exchanges. So we're affiliated with about seven of those, three of whom we have investments in a tokenization platform. But there's an entire ecosystem, and we're just the data layer that informs the performance of the digital instrument. We're not the exchange, we're not the custodian, we're not the bulletin board.
00:49:39.930 - 00:49:40.306, Speaker A: We'Re.
00:49:40.338 - 00:49:49.474, Speaker B: Not the calculation engine, we're not the valuation engine. We're just stringing as the data flows through all those systems and is attached to the token.
00:49:49.602 - 00:50:15.374, Speaker A: Great. Listen, guys, thank you both so much. I think we are getting to the end of the time. We've probably lost a few of our viewers already. This is one of those spaces where, honestly, you guys have six different people on here. We could talk for about 17 different hours. Somebody said in this chat at some point that if you go to a world where everything might be digital, it's unbelievable to think how much activity that we are going to come through these pipes.
00:50:15.374 - 00:50:43.110, Speaker A: So congratulations to both of you on amazing progress so far. I do want to plug feedback survey. So for those of you who are listening, there's going to be a link to a feedback survey in the chat window. Let us know whether we're entertaining you, boring you, doing whatever else so we can get better next time, and then just, whoops. Do 10 seconds for each of you to say goodbye to the audience or anything you want to. Leave the last thoughts for the folks.
00:50:43.270 - 00:50:57.374, Speaker C: Brian, just thanks for having us. If you want to learn more about what we're doing, just check out our website. It's at cash gold and gramchain is@gramchain.com great.
00:50:57.412 - 00:51:01.198, Speaker A: And that's Graham as in the measure of unit. Gram gramchain.com. Correct.
00:51:01.284 - 00:51:02.160, Speaker C: That's it.
00:51:02.630 - 00:51:03.700, Speaker A: And pat.
00:51:04.870 - 00:52:00.640, Speaker B: Yeah, hey, thanks for having us. It's great to be connected to, chainlinked and to your entire ecosystem. And the one kind of last thought I'll give is that for us to move to a decentralized reality is going to take an ecosystem, not a single monolith. And we need lots of people plugging in, providing services all the way along for these things to trade. It's early days. We need a lot of development to be done for this to be functioning the way that it should be. Literally we're talking about tens and tens or hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets that are going to be tokenized and they're going to be traded and they're going to be listed and everything from surveillance of a rent payment all the way to iot sensors to green bonds and carbon credits and proving the savings of energy.
00:52:00.640 - 00:52:09.554, Speaker B: All of this is going to happen. It's all going to need oracles to power smart contracts. And that's why we're so excited to be affiliated with you guys at chainlink.
00:52:09.602 - 00:52:14.660, Speaker A: Thanks. Great. Thank you all. Thanks to our audience and best of luck to everyone.
