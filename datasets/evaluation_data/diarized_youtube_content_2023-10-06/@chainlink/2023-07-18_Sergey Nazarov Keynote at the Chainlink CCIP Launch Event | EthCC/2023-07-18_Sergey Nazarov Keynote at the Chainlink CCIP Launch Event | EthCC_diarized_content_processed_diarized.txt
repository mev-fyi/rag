00:00:05.290 - 00:00:39.530, Speaker A: Great. Thank you, Kamal. Yeah, before going on, you know, it's been many, many years that we've been working on this well over three years. And there's been a lot of really thoughtful people that have helped us do it. And I'm really, really grateful to all of them and to all the engineers who spent many, many late nights getting this out to meet the timeline to launch here at ECC. So before I even go on, I just want to say thank you to everybody and especially to our early adopters of the system and the people that have helped us build it with their feedback. Thank you very much.
00:00:39.530 - 00:01:17.350, Speaker A: I really appreciate it. Thank you. Wow, that's bright. I thought that was bright. So I think the thing that we're actually doing is creating an Internet of contracts. So this is a concept that has come up and down in the blockchain community for the past, let's say 8910 years. I think this is really what this could result in, if it's done correctly.
00:01:17.350 - 00:02:48.290, Speaker A: We basically have an opportunity to make sure that instead of everyone focusing on one single chain and just having to silo all their liquidity or all their technical work, people can launch applications across multiple chains just like you launch applications across multiple clouds. Because when you use a web two application, you're not sitting there thinking about, does Netflix use AWS or GCP or Azure? Or like, you don't know, right? You just want an efficient system that gets you the value of an application. And this is what is, I think one of the things missing from our industry is basically an Internet of contracts that allows liquidity to be globally accessible, not just within a siloed single chain, and for the value of an application to be globally accessible, regardless of what chain you're at. Basically, I think the thing that we're going to see pretty quickly, and we already see today, is two Internet of contracts. There is going to be a public blockchain, Defi Internet of contracts, which is the one that we're launching on mainnet today, together with Synthetix and Aave, and driving that forward. That one is very important because it pushes the limits of innovation and it creates the foundation on which the new world financial system will be built. The smart contracts being built by DeFi will define that.
00:02:48.290 - 00:02:52.642, Speaker A: Basically, there is another category of value.
00:02:52.776 - 00:02:55.218, Speaker B: That is the bank, basically.
00:02:55.384 - 00:02:57.094, Speaker A: So all the world's value up until.
00:02:57.132 - 00:03:02.242, Speaker B: This point has been aggregated in banks and asset managers held by custodians.
00:03:02.306 - 00:03:07.158, Speaker A: Basically, that's hundreds of trillions of dollars. We, as an industry, we're not going.
00:03:07.164 - 00:03:13.914, Speaker B: To get away from this fact. We need the value in these banks and asset managers to flow into our.
00:03:13.952 - 00:03:15.946, Speaker A: Industry in order for the industry to.
00:03:15.968 - 00:03:17.260, Speaker B: Go to the next level.
00:03:17.630 - 00:03:52.034, Speaker A: And next level doesn't mean like going from 1 trillion to 2 trillion, means going from 1 trillion to 2030, 50 trillion. That's what it means. That's what next level is. So that's what we're going to try to do. We're going to try to create these two Internet of contracts. They're relatively separate because they're run by different people with different goals and different requirements. But at the end of the day, both of these groups want to transact, and they actually are running very similar financial products with similar financial goals.
00:03:52.034 - 00:04:31.860, Speaker A: So they're going to want to transact. It's just obvious. At least I think it's pretty obvious. And what you want to do is you want to enable both of them to interact with each other, to create more value within their respective Internet of contracts, ecosystems. But then you want to connect them to the degree that there is no real difference. Like things almost become indistinguishable at a certain point where you could go to Citibank and you could put your money into ave and everyone benefits, right? Ave benefits because you just went to Citibank and put your money in, and Citibank benefits because they service your need or desire to use AAVE. Great.
00:04:31.860 - 00:05:26.660, Speaker A: Why doesn't the world work that way? Right. We think that it should. And realistically, CCIP can be a very important resource for that, because so far there has been no technical way to achieve that level of connection between these two worlds of value. And while I think there will be a lot of value created within each of those Internet of contracts, eventually connecting them will result in the leveling up of the whole industry, which is once again, what I think will have a very big impact on all of us. The fundamental goal is for our industry to be about more. We want to be about more. We want to grow, right? We want our industry and the way it works and the way we define things working to define how the world works.
00:05:26.660 - 00:06:20.374, Speaker A: That's why we're doing all this. So right now, if our industry powers one to one and a half trillion, this is one of the important steps in us going to a world where hundreds of trillions are secured, powered, transacted and managed on the technologies that we're all working on. So once again, very excited to be launching this. I think it's a big step. We decided not to wait any longer because the audits came through and everything came through, and we're very excited to just launch as quickly as we can with security in mind. I appreciate everyone's patience and once again, very grateful to everybody working with us and adopting the system. And I think based on all the security parameters that it has, I think it's very likely that it's going to continue to get adopted because of that security, which is fundamentally what our industry is about.
00:06:20.374 - 00:06:23.720, Speaker A: It's creating a new, more secure global financial system.
