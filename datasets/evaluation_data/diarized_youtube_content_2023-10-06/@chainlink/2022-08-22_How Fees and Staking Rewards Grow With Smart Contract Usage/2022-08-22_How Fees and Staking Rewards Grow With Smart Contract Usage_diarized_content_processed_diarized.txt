00:00:00.570 - 00:00:52.830, Speaker A: You. This leads us into the beginning of Chainlink Economics 2.0 which is going to be kicked off by staking this year. These two dynamics of continually more services providing continually more data and more value to a greater and greater breadth of smart contracts. As more DFI smart contracts, gaming smart contracts, this dynamic NFP smart contracts come to life. All of these additional contracts and all of these additional services continually generate more revenue while at the same time having the costs go down. This is why we think this year is an appropriate time to begin the transition to Chainlink Economics 20 with the launch of staking.
00:00:52.830 - 00:01:26.180, Speaker A: Because the economics of Chainlink Oracle networks are continuing to improve at a rapid rate both in the amount of revenue from the amount of apps and in the reduction of costs necessary to provide those services, which essentially means that a greater share of revenue will flow to node operators and the stakers that provide stake for the crypto economic security guarantees that will continue to improve the security of the system as well as the eventual loss protection guarantees of the system. Thank.
