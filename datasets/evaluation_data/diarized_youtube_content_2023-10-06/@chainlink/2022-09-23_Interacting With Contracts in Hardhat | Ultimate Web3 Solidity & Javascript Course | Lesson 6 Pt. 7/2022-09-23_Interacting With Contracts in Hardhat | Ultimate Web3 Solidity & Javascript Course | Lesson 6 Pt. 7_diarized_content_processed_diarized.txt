00:00:08.890 - 00:00:19.722, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So we've deployed our contract. We've automatically programmatically verified our contract. What's next? Well, what did we do last time we started interacting with the contract?
00:00:19.866 - 00:00:35.382, Speaker B: So let's do const current value equals await simplestorage retrieve to get the current value. Simplestorage Sol we have a retrieve function.
00:00:35.436 - 00:00:39.386, Speaker A: Which returns the favorite number. So let's get the current value, and.
00:00:39.408 - 00:00:41.980, Speaker B: We'Ll do console log.
00:00:44.190 - 00:00:46.380, Speaker A: Current value is.
00:00:46.750 - 00:01:20.658, Speaker B: And then some string interpolation current value, and then we'll go ahead and update the current value by doing const transaction response equals await simplestorage store. We'll store the number seven, and then we'll await transactionresponse. Wait, we'll wait one block for that transaction to go through, and we'll grab.
00:01:20.674 - 00:01:23.730, Speaker A: The updated value by saying const updated.
00:01:23.890 - 00:01:43.488, Speaker B: Value equals await simple storage retrieve. And then we'll do console log data value is updated value. Awesome.
00:01:43.574 - 00:01:48.436, Speaker A: And this is going to be our whole script. So if I can zoom out for a little bit, I know it'll be.
00:01:48.458 - 00:01:50.516, Speaker B: A little bit small here we've got.
00:01:50.538 - 00:02:03.864, Speaker A: This huge main function which does what? Well, it deploys our contract. If we're on a testnet, it then verifies our contract and then it updates the value to seven. And we have our verify function down.
00:02:03.902 - 00:02:06.536, Speaker B: Here, and we have a section of.
00:02:06.558 - 00:02:11.548, Speaker A: Our code that calls our main function. Now, if I run this on the hard hat network, what do you think will happen?
00:02:11.634 - 00:02:12.716, Speaker B: Well, let's try it.
00:02:12.818 - 00:02:16.860, Speaker A: Yarn hardhat run scripts, deploy js.
00:02:17.760 - 00:02:18.540, Speaker B: All right, awesome.
00:02:18.610 - 00:02:31.952, Speaker A: We get exactly what we saw before. We get deploying contract deployed. Contract two, current value is zero. Updated value seven. And there's nothing in here about verification. That's exactly what we want. Now, moment of truth.
00:02:31.952 - 00:02:40.820, Speaker A: Let's try this on rinkby. We'll do yarn hardhat, run scripts, deploy js network.
00:02:42.600 - 00:02:43.780, Speaker B: Rinkabee.
00:02:45.320 - 00:03:03.084, Speaker A: And it's going to go a lot slower because obviously now we're deploying to an actual testnet where the blocks actually need to be mined. And we see we have indeed deployed the contract. Now that our contract is deployed, we know that we're currently waiting six block confirmations for us to go ahead and verify. And actually, I should add console log.
00:03:03.282 - 00:03:08.028, Speaker B: Waiting for block TX's so that we.
00:03:08.034 - 00:03:10.410, Speaker A: Don'T get kind of this weird. Oh, wait, what are we doing now?
