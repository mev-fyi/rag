00:00:08.970 - 00:01:01.034, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm seb and I'm one of the founders of Hedge. Hedge is an interest free lending protocol on Solana, and our motto is never sell your soul. Because we allow our users to get interest free loans using Solana and other tokens as collateral. We offer a very low minimum collateral ratio, and we do this by issuing a stable coin for a one time minting fee. We use chainic price feeds to accurately calculate the collateral ratio of each service position, and we use a collateral ratio to instantly liquidate users when it becomes under the maintenance collateral ratio. This instant liquidation is what allows us to achieve a very low collateral ratio minimum, which makes us a very capital efficient protocol. And on top of that, we use chain price fees to calculate stablecoin redemptions, which is what ensures that our stablecoin, the ush, has a flow at $1.
00:01:01.034 - 00:01:50.700, Speaker A: So to do instant liquidations in a fair way, we needed an oracle solution that was battle tested in all market conditions, and Chainik provided such a guarantee. And that was why we chose Chainik to secure the hedge collateral and ensure that the protocol is solved at all times. So, since launching and integrating with Chainik, we've attracted a good amount of usage, and through that, we're confident that we're offering the most secure experience to our users. We're very excited about giving users the best UX possible, and we're doing that by giving users more collateral options, one click leverage options, as well as a better liquidation experience. It's been great working with a training team. They've given us a lot of technical support, and as hedge grows, we look forward to working with them. And so we definitely recommend other protocols to also work with training.
