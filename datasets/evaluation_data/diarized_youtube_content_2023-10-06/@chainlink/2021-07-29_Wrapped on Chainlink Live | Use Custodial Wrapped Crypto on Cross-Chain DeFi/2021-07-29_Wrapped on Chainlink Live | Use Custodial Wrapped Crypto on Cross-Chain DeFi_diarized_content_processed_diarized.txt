00:00:00.330 - 00:00:07.802, Speaker A: I feel like there's been a new meme, like every 3 hours. The last few days we had shadowy supercoders.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:09.278, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, solid one.
00:00:09.444 - 00:00:13.786, Speaker A: And then everything's rebranding to FTX. And so that's a meme.
00:00:13.818 - 00:00:44.570, Speaker B: Now there's also a good morning meme going around that's just GM, and I don't know what it is, but everyone's doing GM on crypto Twitter now, so. GM, everyone. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. And today we're talking about the wrapped project. I've got Mason Borda, the CEO of Tokensoft, here to talk about that. Mason, it's great to have you here.
00:00:44.570 - 00:00:50.346, Speaker B: Why don't you start off and tell us a little bit about wrapped, what it is, and what's the relationship to Tokensoft? How does that work?
00:00:50.448 - 00:01:20.294, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'll start with Tokensoft. So we started in 2017. There was a lot of tokens getting to market, and so we started a company to sort of help them do the token sales and to do that safely. And so we've worked with a bunch of projects. So tezos half graph avalanche the graph. So basically, we help people make tokens there. And at some point we're like, hey, it would be cool to make our own as well.
00:01:20.294 - 00:01:59.700, Speaker A: So what's sort of a lineup of tokens that we can sort of launch? So we're like, okay, maybe we'll do wrap tokens. And so through wrap, we launched a series of wrap tokens that basically connect your assets to defi no matter what blockchain you're on. And so the first assets we launched with were Rapzcash and rap Filecoin. And we brought those to the Ethereum network and started connecting them to the different defi applications that are out there. And more recently, we've been also bringing bitcoin and Ethereum to other blockchains, like stacks, cello, kadena. There will be a couple other major ones that we'll announce in the coming weeks as well.
00:02:00.070 - 00:02:12.262, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So you're wrapping off chain, bringing things on chain to a variety of networks there. So those are collateralized, right? These are all collateralized wrapped assets, yeah.
00:02:12.316 - 00:03:05.990, Speaker A: So simply put, we're a bridge, and there's different types of bridges that are out there. There's decentralized bridges, and there's things like keep network, there's door chain, there's Ren protocol. This is more of a custodial bridge. So it's more in the same vein of how Wrap BTC or USDC or tether work in that the assets are custody. And so basically the way this works is wrap is sort of the tokenization provider. And so for example, when one zcash comes into a wallet in custody, we go ahead and we create one wrap zcash and we send it back to the user. And so we're basically creating a bridge that's enabling one to one collateralized assets and the assets are custodied with a custodian.
00:03:06.490 - 00:03:12.330, Speaker B: Okay, so Anchorage, is this qualified custodian, are they a bank that holds crypto?
00:03:12.830 - 00:03:25.946, Speaker A: Yeah, so they recently got a license and I'm probably not going to get this 100% accurate, so forgive me, but as an OCC chartered federal bank, and so they're one of the first custodians to sort of get that license.
00:03:26.138 - 00:04:00.220, Speaker B: Awesome. Juan isn't my man in the chat. Go find an announcement that explains what Anchorage does, if you can, because that's a really interesting distinction here, is that a bank has the authority, or a crypto company has banking authority to manage crypto keys for somebody and then actually use those to create wrap tokens on chain. That's a really interesting use case and something that separates it. Can you talk a little bit about what is a qualified custodian? What differentiates them from me? I got a wallet, I can hold assets, but how is that different?
00:04:01.630 - 00:04:39.294, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a set of regulations out there that basically say, hey, if you're going to hold funds for other people, then you need a license. So we can all hold our own funds. That's okay, per the regulators. But the second we start holding funds for other people and we have the ability to lose them, let's say we put up a website that's a hosted wallet service and the server now has all those keys. Well, just by virtue of doing that, the server also has the ability to lose everyone's funds. And so anytime you're in that situation, you're holding other people's funds and you have the ability to lose them. You need a license.
00:04:39.294 - 00:05:06.222, Speaker A: And so there's different types of licenses. There's the money transmitter license, which is state by state. And if you get that, you can now hold other people's funds. And then the more higher caliber license you can get is this. Get set up as a federal bank and be a custodian. And I don't know the details of what it means to be a qualified custodian. So I don't want to sort of speculate on that.
00:05:06.222 - 00:05:14.254, Speaker A: But if you're a trust I believe, or your federal bank, then you're now like a qualified custodian, right.
00:05:14.452 - 00:05:43.322, Speaker B: There's some set of regulations that you've passed, some compliance things you've passed and had that stamp of approval. And I mean, this ties into the panel, the Senate panel. Angela Walsh was talking about fiduciary responsibility and about miners. And this is an open question in the space. Do developers have fiduciary responsibility? Some people, legislators want to think so, and many crypto people don't. And the answer, according to me, is probably somewhere in the middle. But that's an interesting question.
00:05:43.322 - 00:05:57.390, Speaker B: We certainly have these rails and these compliance regulations existing in the banking infrastructure. So to give people the option to choose that route or something else is really interesting. Is that the main differentiator between wrapped and like a decentralized.
00:05:59.890 - 00:06:36.438, Speaker A: You know, in the decentralized space? I think the technology is still fairly young and we're still figuring out all the details. I think Thorchain faced a few challenges the past few weeks that hopefully they'll overcome and come back stronger. And I think the main difference is that when you have a centralized solution that's using a custodian in the back, that technology is pretty well worn. Right? It's just wallet software. Obviously, Anchorage has some sophisticated technology. They've also layered on top of it. But we saw this as sort of the simplest and fastest way to get to market long term.
00:06:36.438 - 00:06:56.370, Speaker A: I personally believe that everything's going to be decentralized. So I have hope that that technology on the decentralized bridges is going to continue to mature. But on our end, this was sort of the fastest way we could help people get these assets connected with other blockchains and get to market faster. So that's why we launch rap.com.
00:06:56.520 - 00:07:22.650, Speaker B: It's interesting that speed is one of the reasons, because I think there's this idea in a lot of Defi, not all of it, but a lot of Defi, that we can do it faster ourselves rather than go through the compliance and go through the regs, maybe, right? That depends on the project. It depends on the route you choose to go. I think there's a lot of different options there. Well, we're talking to you because you guys integrated chainlink for the wrapped project. How are you using Chainlink?
00:07:24.110 - 00:08:14.554, Speaker A: Yeah, so one of the big things that we do is we get these wrapped assets integrated with different DeFi applications, and these might be applications that are doing different farming programs to help drive liquidity into their. So we have basically this pipeline of different apps we want to push our assets into, and one of them that we ran into was Aave. And Ave needs sort of on chain price oracles to be able to integrate different assets. And so at some point we were like, okay, we really need some sort of oracle service to partner with. And that's when sort of Chainlink came up. And so this is sort of our way of getting that integration done. We think a lot more folks are going to need on chain oracles as well.
00:08:14.554 - 00:08:38.962, Speaker A: And so now that we've integrated with Chainlink and we have this partnership, this infrastructure now exists. And so that opens up a lot more doors for these wrapped assets that we're rolling out there. And we're hoping to see this service on other blockchains as well. So we're excited to see if this can grow into a much larger operation and opportunity between us.
00:08:39.096 - 00:09:34.146, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just hearing about thinking about your wrapped assets and the variety of assets, and I know all the chainlink catalog of solutions, of course, and there's a lot of opportunity there to do some things that help towards progressive decentralization, if that's something in your future as well, or any extensions of those into other smart contract sort of uses. So I'm really glad to be working with you. And of course, once we have a little relationship going, then things happen and things bloom, as they say, and that's fantastic. So this is kind of a CFI ish, as they say, centralized ish solution, at least for custody. Is there room in the market like you guys have done the market analysis? Is there room in the market for both for that combination, or is Defi eventually going to eat CFI? And this is like a stopgap. What do you think about, you know.
00:09:34.168 - 00:10:42.010, Speaker A: And we might want to use binance terminology and call this, I think so this is definitely a centralized solution. The interesting thing about it is the one component is centralized, but then when it comes to the defi integrations we're doing, that's all sort of more decentralized. We have to get through governance processes and all that stuff to get integrated there. I think when it comes to the rollout, there are a lot of solutions where we partner with our decentralized counterparts. So we've done things with ren protocol and partnered in terms of getting assets out there jointly in products like curve or where you need multiple coins that are sort of pegged to the same underlying. And so we're fairly collaborative in the space and we sort of believe that to sort of just make this a much larger opportunity, much larger space, we do have to collaborate and work with folks that are out there to achieve larger goals. So I think at some point this is all going to go decentralized.
00:10:42.010 - 00:11:27.640, Speaker A: And we have done some sort of thinking to see where does our role sort of evolve into once we get there. So we'll probably announce that I think it'll probably happen in the next two to three years. So we'll get there. But I think in the short term, this is a CFI solution. It does plug into DeFi, and whichever solutions you're using, I think it's just about doing some research, getting comfortable with it, understanding exactly how it works, and then going from there. And then I think on the other side of it is like, what opportunities are out there? What sort of farming opportunities are out there? So that's something where we try to line up sort of a roadmap and make sure that there is sufficient demand for these wrapped assets and sufficient use cases to use them.
00:11:29.630 - 00:12:05.570, Speaker B: Okay. First, personally, I think that comparing a CFI and a DFI is not detailed enough. Really. CFI is a spectrum of how centralized and who is in charge and what responsibilities do they have. And the same with DFI. You could be decentralized and have three people, and that's less decentralized than 300, and how do you determine those mechanisms? So just bucketing them in CFI or DFI? I think I loaded the question, of course. So I'm critiquing my own question, but that's not an effective way to think about the space.
00:12:05.570 - 00:12:26.300, Speaker B: It really is a spectrum. So absolutely do that research and see what are you comfortable with. And plus now as the industry grows, there's so many different people that are comfortable with different levels of centralization. Some people are comfortable with a little bit more, some people are not. And they don't want anything with the full crypto anarchist. And there's a lot of people in the middle ground. So I think that gets at your answer as well.
00:12:26.300 - 00:12:39.920, Speaker B: When you talk about who you're willing to work with in the space, who are the sorts of projects and companies who are coming to you, who would do business with you in a way to help wrap these tokens, who are you looking to talk to?
00:12:42.770 - 00:13:38.130, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we sort of sit in between just the supply and the demand. And the supply is the market makers, liquidity providers, folks with a lot of capital. And then on the other side of it is the DeFi applications, and are there use cases to sort of drive the demand for wrapping and to bring the assets onto other blockchains and so the initial use case we're sort of like running towards was people have all these dormant assets, they're not doing anything. Let's try to make them yield generating. And so that's why Rapzcash wrapfalcoin came out was because we wanted to help provide that link and provide opportunities for people to figure out how to. Perhaps you want to take out loans and unlock some capital from your capital that's not doing anything. Maybe you want to start farming it and so generate return off those otherwise dormant assets.
00:13:38.130 - 00:14:29.570, Speaker A: And so that's sort of one class of folks is folks that are trying to put their capital to work on the other side. Just like people that want to take advantage of our opportunities. Anytime you have a single asset in multiple markets, in this case they're assets that are pegged to the same underlying in multiple markets, that's going to create revenue generating opportunities. Because markets are new, the prices are going to fluctuate more in these newer markets. The older markets are more mature, more liquid, and so they're a little bit more stable. And so when we go and create new markets, that also creates new opportunities for market makers that want to help stabilize the price and maintain, I guess just generate capital from those ARP opportunities. So that's sort of one side of it.
00:14:29.570 - 00:14:58.058, Speaker A: And then on the other side of it is just the Defi app. So we're always looking for just quality teams and quality projects to help connect these wrapped assets into. And so yeah, if there are any interesting projects out there that can help put these assets to work, we're definitely looking to speak with them. And so just reach out on our website and we can take a look. But yeah, that's sort of where we sit in the middle of.
00:14:58.144 - 00:15:31.590, Speaker B: That's super helpful and interesting to think about because that's a big question, like how do these things happen in the space? How does an asset get bridged over to another one? And if you look at things like yield rates on a newer blockchain or a newer DeFi platform, like just compare Ethereum rates to BSc rates or polygon rates or avalanche rates, the rates on these newer chains are way higher because there's less liquidity there. There's less people to jump into those pools. And so those are defi protocols that are looking for liquidity. Trying to call these people and that's where you guys sit in the middle is help bridge those assets.
00:15:32.330 - 00:15:47.578, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's really interesting seeing the other blockchains come about and the products on those blockchains and just seeing them be a little bit more aggressive with drawing capital in, it's definitely making for more exciting market, I think.
00:15:47.664 - 00:15:55.310, Speaker B: Yeah, some of those yields are astronomical. They at least let me link things to my friends and be like, you guys, seriously, pay attention to defi.
00:15:56.370 - 00:16:21.320, Speaker A: The biggest lesson I learned about how those yields work is when the pools are small, that percentage goes up a lot more than it's supposed to be. And then when the liquidity comes in, it stabilizes at the number it's supposed to. And so some of those numbers, they look really good. And then you just watch them, and they look really good for maybe a week. Then the liquidity comes in and it stabilizes. So I've been learning a lot.
00:16:21.770 - 00:16:48.542, Speaker B: Well, with the size of defi, it's still relatively small compared to any traditional markets. And the crypto market as a whole, it's still like a fraction of the total value available. And so when big market movers come in, that makes a serious impact on various Defi protocols, whether it's rates, network congestion, all sorts of things in there. So you can see it happen in real time, especially if you're farming and you see one rate, and then you check a couple of days later and it's way down.
00:16:48.596 - 00:16:48.766, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:48.788 - 00:16:55.700, Speaker B: That's what happened. More people came into the pool. It's really kind of a live space to watch the wild west happen.
00:16:56.790 - 00:17:17.480, Speaker A: Yeah. And the interesting dynamic there is more people come into the pool. So, like, the TVL skyrockets, which is good for the project, and it's good for the underlying coin that is being farmed. But then people complain about the rates. And the thing is, your token is probably worth a lot more now because the TVL is a lot higher.
00:17:20.170 - 00:17:58.662, Speaker B: It's the constant dealing with community. And what does community want, and how do you manage that and deliver a good product and doing all that at the same time? This is crypto landscape in general, and part of what we all do together. Hey, I appreciate everyone here watching. We're having a cool conversation about Defi and the Yelp farming landscape with Mason. Do you have a list of assets that are coming up that are publicly known? You can talk about, like, what else is going to be released on what chains or those kind of things anyways, actually, tell me what's next on the roadmap, and then you can tell me if there's token releases coming out on other chains, if that's part of it, yeah.
00:17:58.716 - 00:18:44.340, Speaker A: The best way to do it is to check out our website. And the thing about this is there's coins that we've officially wrapped and announced, and then there are coins that we've put out there that we're waiting to build demand for. And so the ones that are sort of officially announced are like rapfire coin, Rapzcash, and we're doing bitcoin and ETH on other blockchains as well. Rap Cello is another big one that has decent liquidity on ETH. And so you can check out our website. But if there's significant demand for other assets, especially on Ethereum, we'd love to hear about them because that's very interesting to us. We definitely want to work with assets where people are putting them to use and developing new use cases for them.
00:18:44.340 - 00:19:27.634, Speaker A: But the major items on the roadmap coming up are bitcoin and eth on different blockchains. So like I mentioned, we've announced stacks, Kadena Celo, and we're bringing bitcoin and either bitcoin and ETH, or just bitcoin to those blockchains. And then there's a couple other major blockchains that we'll be announcing in a couple of weeks, but it'll be bitcoin and eth on those as well. And so we're just really excited to sort of roll those out. And the demand has been really interesting. So, yeah, we're excited to work with these different foundations and liquidity providers to get these set up.
00:19:27.832 - 00:19:55.626, Speaker B: This is like a microcosm and economics experiment live that we're experiencing right now. What happens when you take. They're liquid. They're liquid assets now especially. You can take your bitcoin and Ethan, you can cash out in most places and get whatever fiat dollars you want. So what happens when you get these liquid assets and deposit them into a brand new economic system? We're watching that happen. So I'm really excited to see the economic research that comes out of all this as well.
00:19:55.626 - 00:20:26.242, Speaker B: Just to see the models as people do that, as people with whatever those holdings are, bitcoin, ether, whatever it is, they want to do something with it that can launch, like seed an entire ecosystem on whatever blockchain it is. And we're seeing more and more blockchains launching and getting their defi infrastructure ready as Chainlink goes out to blockchains. We just went live on avalanche last week with native wonderful price feeds as well. So hey, move it to avalanche. That's my pitch for you. I see that. We'd love to do that.
00:20:26.242 - 00:20:38.060, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, it sounds like that's what's on the roadmap this has been really great. Mason, nice to connect with you. Where can people follow you? Where's the best way to kind of get in touch with the team and the community?
