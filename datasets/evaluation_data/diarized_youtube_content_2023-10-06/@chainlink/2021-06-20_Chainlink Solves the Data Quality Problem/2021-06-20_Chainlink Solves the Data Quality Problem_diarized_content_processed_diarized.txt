00:00:00.570 - 00:00:56.906, Speaker A: You. The other dynamic that I've seen that's quite worrying is I've seen people ignore data, pricing data methodology. I've seen people suggest that a methodology that can be wrong in times of volatility is somehow safe. It is fundamentally not safe. You cannot say that I have a pricing methodology that on Black Thursday would have given back a price that had 20 or 30% deviation. And your pricing methodology gives back a price that is accurate to the minute or something like that with market coverage across all the places where price discovery happens, and tell people to rely on a price that in a time of volatility, which often happens rapidly, is off by 20 or 30%. A 20 or 30% difference because somebody chose the wrong data methodology for price, can create a situation where people can simply steal money from that platform to a massive degree.
00:00:56.906 - 00:01:27.480, Speaker A: And it's a very worrying dynamic. And I think people should seriously consider the data methodology that they're using to provide data to their application. Because once again, garbage in, garbage out. And it's once again a serious issue. Because if you have garbage in and you have other people's money at stake, you have a serious problem where that system can fail and people could lose money. And this can fail on the data source quality level, the data methodology level, and also on the Oracle data transport level. But once again, it's not an engineering problem, it's a data quality problem.
00:01:27.480 - 00:01:39.300, Speaker A: And if this is a problem you guys want to work through properly, I suggest contact somebody who has experience with that. We, in our case, have experience with both of those dynamics, and we're glad to help everybody build a good defi application.
