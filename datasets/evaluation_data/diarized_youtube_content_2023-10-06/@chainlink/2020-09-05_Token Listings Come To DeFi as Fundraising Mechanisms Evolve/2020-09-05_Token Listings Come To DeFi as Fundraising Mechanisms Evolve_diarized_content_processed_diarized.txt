00:00:06.730 - 00:00:23.230, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, welcome back. We are live back on Smartcon. We've got a fantastic panel here right now about Defi and token listings coming to Defi. Cammy Russo from the Defiant will be moderating and so I'm going to let her take it away and go for it. Cammy.
00:00:23.570 - 00:00:44.934, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks so much, Andy. Me? Yeah. So welcome to this panel. Token listings come to DeFi as fundraising mechanisms evolve. We have wonderful panelists today. Matthew Feinstone, director of business development at Loop Ring, an exchange and payment protocol using L2 scaling solution, PK Rollup.
00:00:44.934 - 00:01:06.740, Speaker B: Fernando Martinelli, the co founder and CEO of Balancer, a decentralized asset manager. And Dex and Kyle Kissner, co founder founder at VCX, a decentralized lending protocol. So before we dive into this discussion, Kyle from VCX has a quick announcement to make.
00:01:07.830 - 00:01:24.630, Speaker A: Yeah. So starting today, we are deploying the BZX contracts onto the main net. So it's starting. We anticipate the launch will begin on the 31st, but the deployment is starting now, so we're really excited.
00:01:25.770 - 00:01:55.780, Speaker B: Yay. Good luck with that. Awesome. Okay, so to start off, let's kind of level out the discussion and wanted to ask you what main mechanisms available are there for fundraising in DeFi right now? Like for startups looking to raise money, what's their best bet? Matt, maybe you can start.
00:01:56.870 - 00:02:29.306, Speaker C: Okay, sure. Thank you, Cammy. I don't know if I have. It's such a fast moving just field within DeFi is fundraising. I'm not sure if my taxonomy is so perfect, even. Maybe I should have stuff on sell. I think broadly, in the broadest of strokes, you could sell something to somebody, whether that's a private sale to a VC fund or to the public.
00:02:29.306 - 00:03:00.840, Speaker C: So you're selling something and they are giving you something back. And then there's all sorts of nuances, of course, public, private, and how you do it, or the big one we've seen recently is allow people to earn it, use a protocol and distribute it tied to something else. Not somebody's money, but somebody's work or activity or optimized behavior. Maybe I'm missing something and that's too broad. But it's either kind of selling something in some way or having them earn it and work for it another way.
00:03:01.290 - 00:03:19.660, Speaker B: Got it. I love that kind of simplified version. Know the different kinds of fundraising there are, and then maybe, Fernando, do you want to break it down further between selling and earning? What are the different options available?
00:03:21.710 - 00:03:57.510, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think the main option we saw in the early days of Ethereum and crypto in 2017 is the IcO craze. So that's the main side of selling tokens. That's kind of the old way of doing things. Maybe it's bad, maybe it's not. It's going to be repackaged into other ways, and we can talk about that. The other option that Matt just mentioned, I think the best example of it is liquidity mining or earning those tokens by participating in a protocol.
00:03:57.510 - 00:05:11.498, Speaker D: When we further break down the selling side, I think we all know the option to go to centralized exchanges and pay very high fees to binance and other exchanges, which I think has its days counted. So I don't think that's going to be the case for much longer. You can also think of ways to do auctions, like by gnosis allows. So you have one period where people put orders, and then you have an external proposer of how to settle all the most orders possible with a single price, which is a very nice and fair way to do it. And you also have idos or listing on decentralized exchanges, like many projects have been doing on balancer and on Uniswap. And we have something that's about to come, which is something that I'm very excited about, which are liquidity bootstrapping pools. These are smart pools that actually are being audited this week by Samsung with tray of bits.
00:05:11.498 - 00:05:56.042, Speaker D: And after we finalize that review and nothing has been kind of raised that is alarming or vulnerability, we'll be launching this and seeing lots of projects using the liquidity bootstrapping pool, which I can talk more about. It solves the problem of front running, like we saw on Uniswap for UmA and also for BZX. And our projects, like people buying, they know that the price is going to go up because you start at a very low price of the previous round. These projects are very nice or amazing. You know that price is going to go up. So you want to build a bot that buys, is the first one to buy and then sell some seconds later for more. So we have a solution for that with the liquidity bootstrapping pools.
00:05:56.042 - 00:05:58.430, Speaker D: But, yeah, let's talk about that later.
00:05:58.500 - 00:06:09.970, Speaker B: Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, let's definitely get into that. Kyle, do you want to provide greater context on maybe the different trade offs with these mechanisms?
00:06:12.150 - 00:07:13.990, Speaker A: I would say that there's two main ways to really fundraise in the ecosystem. One is from institutions and the other is from retail. I think kind of what we saw was in 2017 2018, the primary way of fundraising for different blockchain projects was basically getting it from retail. And there was a lot of enthusiasm around the democratizing of finance. How finally the little guy is able to share in what accredited investors had been able to have for so long. We saw a trend of fundraising moving away from that, moving towards more vetting, moving away from the US. Now, I would say the primary mechanism of fundraising for projects is institutional, either by applying to accelerators and giving away equity, or by selling seed stage rounds, either tokens or equity to institutions.
00:07:13.990 - 00:08:32.110, Speaker A: And I think we're also seeing another sort of fundraising mechanism start to emerge here. And I think it's going to develop quite a bit, which is basically we're going to give everything away for free in order to build the community, and then we're going to hope that the community, the Dow, votes to give us money on the back end. So this is like a really interesting approach that I think we're seeing. And I think it's very interesting because even getting to the point where you have a product that you can give away for free is actually pretty difficult. And so there's starting to be people who are trying to financially support that whole process of bootstrapping it up to give it away for free. But the understanding is there is still some cash flow that will come to the people who give it all away because the Dow is going to fund them. So now we're starting to see like a fundraising ecosystem even crop up among those people to help fund them and get them to the stage of building the website and building the product and giving it away for free.
00:08:32.110 - 00:08:46.820, Speaker A: So it's a very interesting trend where it's almost like people might start kind of investing in the developers themselves for the promise of like, okay, well, when the Dow pays you back, we get a little chunk of that for helping you or something.
00:08:47.130 - 00:09:01.802, Speaker B: That's interesting. But to be clear, when you say giving away the product for free, do you mean giving access to the different platforms, like the protocol without charging fees, or like giving away 100% of the token without taking a stake or both?
00:09:01.856 - 00:09:15.534, Speaker A: Right, like the wifi distribution or the yam distribution, things like that, where either with Wifi it was more like liquidity mining, and then with Wifi it was more like a proof of capital, I guess you could say.
00:09:15.732 - 00:09:40.920, Speaker B: Right? So each of your teams have had different token distributions and listings. I think it'd be interesting if each of you can go over how your own token was distributed or sold and how that experience was like. Fernando, do you want to start?
00:09:42.170 - 00:10:33.314, Speaker D: Sure. So we wanted to keep things simple from a legal perspective, and we didn't accept any retail investors. And yeah, we are very glad we partner up with the best. To us, among the best investors in the space, placeholder, accomplice, inflection and coin fund, they've been extremely helpful really working with us as part of the team. And that said, we started the liquidity mining process, which is a way to distribute more the protocol ownership, because we want to get to this final stage of being fully decentralized. We don't want to be like a company telling what the protocol should look like. We want to be like Ethereum or Linux, where people, you have a community building, the future of a protocol.
00:10:33.314 - 00:11:41.862, Speaker D: And we know that this is not possible if we are seen as a VC coin or as a protocol that's controlled by the founders and advisors, and people know that they can control the voting. And there's nothing I can do as a small bow holder because the founders can just do whatever they want. We know this is not something that can be achieved overnight. So it's going to probably be a few years until we get to that level of entropy, as I like to call it, the distribution of bow ownership across thousands and thousands of people. Over time, investors will reduce their positions in order for others to increase theirs and for balancer to be a more decentralized project. So that's the main idea of liquidity mining and the staking proposal that we have on balancer. This idea that people who provide liquidity on balancer with Bow and West, WBTC, USDC or DAi, those people get an extra boost for letting, because when they provide liquidity with bow, they are increasing, democratizing access to bow.
00:11:41.862 - 00:12:03.006, Speaker D: Because if you want to trade bow now, you're going to see that there's very little slippage because there's a pool with $60 million of bow and west, so anyone can enter and exit their position. So there's a lot of more flow. So we're getting to a more decentralized or healthier distribution faster with this staking proposal that we just approved.
00:12:03.198 - 00:12:08.470, Speaker B: Got you. Cool. Kyle, do you want to talk about VCX?
00:12:08.810 - 00:13:25.806, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So we started back in 2017 and kind of debuted in 2018. We had some accredited investors, mostly like small angels that bought our token in 2018, we had what was essentially an ICO and we sold to retail. This is pretty unusual, I guess, because it was like late 2018 and we're a us based company, so not many people were selling to retail back then. But we were pretty careful about the way we structured our token and the function of it and the promises we make, the specific fact and circumstances surrounding it. Fast forward to around just over a month ago, our token had basically been locked, had just been hanging out there, not really deployed much for governance yet, but we had gone ahead and we unlocked the token, and that allowed people to see liquidity on uniswap, on various other dexes. So ours was not really like an Ido, like many others.
00:13:25.806 - 00:14:38.850, Speaker A: So I think the one thing that distinguishes an Ido from what we did is we already had a pretty wide token distribution to start with. We had about 4000 holders. So one big pitfall with Idos is if the team puts tokens on an automatic market maker and then opens it up, and it's not like at the right price, or maybe it even is, it allows somebody, the first person to buy, they're guaranteed to get a price that's like the best price, and so they're guaranteed to make a profit. So that wasn't quite the case with ours, because there was actually like 140,000,000 tokens circulating and there was 5 million in the unitswap pool. So we had somebody come and they made a really great swing trade at the beginning of when the token was unlocked. Got quite a bit of press, people talked about it. Interestingly enough, we know people who actually were holding the tokens and sold directly onto this front runner bot the moment it bought up the tokens.
00:14:38.850 - 00:15:43.100, Speaker A: So they took actually a pretty risky swing trade. It was very interesting watching this happen, because even though there were so many tokens circulating, and even though the person who did that swing trade put themselves at pretty great financial risk, they actually did end up coming out quite a bit ahead in monetary terms. And to some extent, that was at the expense of other people who were trading. There was no free lunch there. And so I think in some ways that's desirable for us to kind of explore ways to mitigate. And definitely things like balancers, bootstrap, liquidity pools and whatnot, if price discovery was allowed to occur there before, say, the broader market, maybe something like that could have been stopped. Because that million dollars is basically like love that is taken out of your community.
00:15:43.100 - 00:15:51.760, Speaker A: Every person who could have had that dollar to themselves is another person who could have spent more time loving your company.
00:15:52.930 - 00:15:58.798, Speaker B: Right? Matthew, do you want to go over how loop rings token came about?
00:15:58.964 - 00:16:25.174, Speaker C: Sure, I guess we have a pretty good swath of different responses. Whoever created the panel was right on, but yeah. So loop ring is more of the old school, I guess. ICO in 2017, the kind of standard old way. It was a big one. It was a successful one. Some people like to quote how much e we raised, which was a lot.
00:16:25.174 - 00:17:26.762, Speaker C: It was 120,000 ether. But what's lesser known is that immediately upon the closing of the sale, I think exactly three years ago, basically because like August 2017 was when China Loop Ring is a predominantly Shanghai based company, a project the chinese government said no more icos because people were getting burned, consumer protection or whatever reasons they had. So we gave back like 80%, I'm not sure the exact number, but somewhere between 70 and 80% of our raise, we gave back willingly to any and all chinese investors in the ICO just to stay on the right side of the regulation. So there's a high top line number, but in the end it was less. So it's kind of interesting just to see the nuances of what could happen there. But yeah, for us it's been smooth sailing token distribution wise since then. We've now been in existence for three years.
00:17:26.762 - 00:18:06.502, Speaker C: It's had time to propagate. There's, I think, like 65,000 addresses that hold LRC. So it's out there. We want to do what Fernando alluded to with BAL and the liquidity mining. For us, it's not as easy, because as a ZK roll up, our thing is doing as much as possible off chain just in completely verifiable ways, and tying that to Ethereum. Of course, we have same Ethereum level self custodial security guarantees, but a lot of stuff is happening off chain. There's a lot of threads that run through this discussion that are relevant to that.
00:18:06.502 - 00:18:43.326, Speaker C: It's not simple for a liquidity provider to just passively provide liquidity to loop Ring's ZK roll up exchange and us to distribute to them. It's not as simple as I'm a liquidity provider on balancer. All it took me was one click, right? I'm jealous of that. In the loop rings case, I wish we could get liquidity provision that simply. But as an order book exchange and a ZK roll up exchange, we need active liquidity provision. We need somebody with some level of technical skill that runs a bot. Of course they could do it manually, you could place orders.
00:18:43.326 - 00:19:24.114, Speaker C: But realistically to be providing real liquidity on loop ring, it's like a centralized exchange. I like to sometimes describe loop ring as a centralized exchange in terms of no gas fees when you're trading, instant finality when you click a button. Except we cannot do evil, right? As long as ethereum exists, users could get their money back. That's how I like to do so. All that to say, we don't have it as easy to just allow liquidity providers and give LRC for that. But at the same time, it might be a bit of a blessing because we kind of have this dry powder now. I view it as to eventually do a more generalized liquidity mining, and indeed we are working on something like that.
00:19:24.114 - 00:20:30.210, Speaker C: I might have to pick Fernando's brain after this, to be honest. We could learn something about that. But the final thing I'll say, which is also very fitting with Kyle here, is even though we have that disadvantage of requiring a bit more of a technical user to run a bot, and it's not just a formula that they're providing assets to, they do their strategies. We could use that as a way to help other projects distribute tokens. And indeed we did that with BZX, and we'll probably renew the campaign as early as next week. Maybe you heard it here first, but with Kyle, if these users, this kind of grassroots, organic, very defi enthusiasts who run bots on loop ring, we could say, hey, provide liquidity on the BZRX Eth pair, deploy your strategy, deploy your bots there. And every hour we're actually snapshoting the order book and giving a BZRX reward to those users.
00:20:30.210 - 00:20:54.026, Speaker C: So it's a way for us to bootstrap liquidity, but not with LRC or our own incentives, with actually BZX incentives. And it benefits them, because now they have this cool L2 venue that's liquid, and they're getting the token in the hands of other people yet again in a kind of different little subcategory. So anyways, that's kind of a divergent thought, but just to bring it all full circle, it's a pretty cool mechanism.
00:20:54.138 - 00:21:01.662, Speaker B: But couldn't you do the same with LRC? Like provide a snapshot of the order book and who's providing liquidity for LRC as well.
00:21:01.796 - 00:21:37.418, Speaker C: You're absolutely right. We do do that. Kyle is an example of like a third party project that we do that program with. We have been doing it with LRC eth since a few months ago, but we're actually paying out rewards, usually in Dai or USDT. We do definitely want to get though to paying out those rewards in LRC. We're waiting, though, with that dry powder until we could generalize it more because we don't want still like a dozen or two dozen bot runners on our ZK roll up to reap all the rewards we want. To make sure that more people could get their hands in there.
00:21:37.584 - 00:22:15.080, Speaker B: Got it. Super interesting to hear all the different ways your tokens were listed and distributed. We have a good mix here. So now I want to dig into this new or newish mechanism that's becoming more and more common, which you all mentioned listing directly on decentralized exchanges. And why would blockchain startup choose to do this versus go to a centralized exchange? Kyle, do you want to go first?
00:22:16.330 - 00:22:59.106, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So this new ido phenomenon, it's pretty interesting because there was nothing really stopping it from happening before. I think perhaps one of the big tipping points was that people actually started using dexes, so they actually had the traction to start making sales on it. So we kind of started with this ICO trend, and the icos didn't really die. Icos changed in ways. They became very regulated in the US. They moved overseas.
00:22:59.106 - 00:23:49.458, Speaker A: We still had tens of millions of dollars of icos happening. We saw a trend where, besides the regulations, consumers became very skeptical of just icos as a general value proposition. In general, they became more highly curated. So one of the reasons they moved to these centralized exchanges in the form of the IEO was basically like consumers had been burned so many times, they wanted due diligence done. They wanted some kind of assurance. It's like, is this team even real? And the exchanges were willing to provide that. And I think as we're seeing now in this new IdO phase, it really is basically the ICO reborn.
00:23:49.458 - 00:24:31.874, Speaker A: And so we have to start asking questions about what made icos start being viable again. Yes, Dexes became viable, and that's one reason. But there's still this general renewed interest in ICO like instruments, maybe in a more mainstream way than had been happening before, where, yes, a lot of people thought the ICO was dead, but it was happening on the periphery, and now it's coming, and it's happening on the main stage on these Dex platforms. So it's very interesting.
00:24:32.072 - 00:24:51.500, Speaker B: Yeah. Fernando, do you want to talk more about that? And kind of like the trade offs between using a Dex and a centralized exchange, and maybe you can take this opportunity to explain more about this new mechanism you were describing before.
00:24:52.430 - 00:25:10.154, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah. So I think the legal issues are things that we cannot ignore. So, yeah, we're all regulated. We can't really hide. This is no anarchy here. So we have to abide to law, whether we go for a centralized exchange or a decentralized exchange.
00:25:10.154 - 00:26:29.730, Speaker D: I think the obvious advantage for decentralized exchanges is that you don't need to pay a very high fee listing fee, and there's no kind of gatekeeping, it's permissionless. Anyone can create a pool and balancer and start doing their ido or having their token liquid. Another thing that actually happens in our case specifically is not only you don't have to pay anything, but if your token is whitelisted, which is kind of all tokens that request to be whitelisted, as long as they're compatible in a technical way, we don't say like this is a scam or not, unless the token has provably done, like an exit scam or something like that, then we don't add that. But people can just get bow tokens for providing liquidity. So instead of not paying, they're actually receiving an incentive of ownership of the protocol that they're contributing to by providing liquidity in whatever token they want. So instead of you paying, you actually get paid in a way to participate. So the specific idea of liquidity bootstrapping pools and why they're a lot better than simply listing on a shared pool and balancer or a uniswap pool, is that, and that's a characteristic of smart pools.
00:26:29.730 - 00:27:02.782, Speaker D: The parameters can change. So for a shared pool and balancer to protect the liquidity providers, the creator of the pool loses all rights over that pool. They cannot add new tokens, they cannot change weights. So people know, okay, I invested in this pool that has 80 20 bow e trading fee is 0.3%. This is not going to change. No one will be able to add a new random token and withdraw or drain my money here. Liquidity bootstrapping pools are smart pools where, you know, people cannot, like, the owner of the pool cannot add a new token.
00:27:02.782 - 00:27:46.570, Speaker D: But you know, there's a schedule, and you can read that on the code of the smart pool that says the project token starts at weight 95 and eth or die or both. You can sell for both e and die. They start with weight five, and you start with a very high price. So, you know, there's not going to be front runners, there's not going to be this fomo. And then over time, you allow the weights to be poked by arbors, by buyers, and as time goes by, those weights start to the project weight starts to go down. Which means that if no one traded, if the balances are the same, the price of the token will go down, because the price is a consequence of the balance. The more balance there is, the lower the price and the weight.
00:27:46.570 - 00:28:31.406, Speaker D: The higher the weight, the higher the price. Because weight means how much value that takes off of the pool. So if your weight is going down and no one traded, it means that the price is going down. At some point, it will make sense for someone who says, well, this is the sweet spot for me, it's almost like a dutch auction, right? Over time, you can find your entry point. But the nice thing is that differently from a dutch auction, it is at the same time a balancer pool that allows people to sell and buy, sell and buy, sell and buy. So at any point, the weights are constant and people can trade like a uniswap pool or a balancer pool, shared pool. But they know that over time, if they want to buy, unless people buy a lot, the price will go down.
00:28:31.406 - 00:29:16.570, Speaker D: So it kind of matches those two sides, like the demand and the supply over time, in a beautiful way that avoids FOMo, it avoids front runners and lets everyone buy. So it could happen that the price is never reached because at some point people are starting to buy, and even though the weight is going down by people buying, the price keeps constant. Like the buy pressure compensates the weight going down. And so at the end, let's say this takes like two months. At the end, the project invested 95% of the value in project token and 5% in die. At the end, they actually have the opposite. They have 95% in ETH or die and only 5% in their project token.
00:29:16.570 - 00:29:35.140, Speaker D: Now they can withdraw a portion of that liquidity, and they now have more die or ETH to pay for their expenses. So it's just like an ICO, but at the same time, you have liquidity all along the way. So that's pretty innovative and interesting, and we're going to see that happening very soon for a lot of.
00:29:35.510 - 00:29:41.574, Speaker B: Do you have already projects kind of waiting to do that? Who's going to be the first project to do that?
00:29:41.772 - 00:30:10.010, Speaker D: We have perp Phi. They announced it that they're going to do like a 7.5 million liquidity bootstrap poll next Wednesday. But we told them, hey guys, maybe you're going to have to postpone that because we're finishing the audit this week. We still haven't found any bugs or vulnerabilities, but Samsung is still looking at it. And if we need to change something and do like a review, you might have to postpone that. But I think it will be the first one on Wednesday.
00:30:10.010 - 00:30:15.920, Speaker D: And there's lots of other projects waiting for this audit to be concluded for them to also do the same.
00:30:17.830 - 00:30:37.382, Speaker B: This has been great. We've gone over so many different ways of listing a token if I can have like 1 minute. The host chainlink asked to discuss how Chainlink plays a role in each of your projects. I don't know if we can take an extra minute to do that.
00:30:37.516 - 00:30:37.862, Speaker D: Sure.
00:30:37.916 - 00:30:41.114, Speaker A: We're going to break right after this, so let's do a great wrap up.
00:30:41.152 - 00:30:45.340, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah. So Matthew, do you want to start with that?
00:30:45.790 - 00:31:22.930, Speaker C: Sure. It's hard to actually express this very quickly because we use chainlink in a way that is not the typical defi, just like price feed way for some synthetic asset or advanced order type. Although we could do that, of course. We're an exchange and so we could use that. But we use it right now in a rather simple and cool way. A dex operator on loop ring, like anyone, not just loopring IO, but loop ring is an open protocol. They have to stake some amount of LRC as kind of like a good behavior bond.
00:31:22.930 - 00:32:18.490, Speaker C: It's not like a full security bond because our security is inherited from ethereum and zero knowledge cryptography, so that's where our security is from. But for good behavior or service level guarantees, you stake lRC as a dex owner, so you can't be slow, right? You can't refuse to publish a Zk roll up block for ten days or something like that. So you stake some LRC, but the value of that LRC is wildly swinging, most days or weeks. So we use the oracle to kind of pin an eth price and then a USD price, just so users have some sense of what service level guarantee, like what a Dex operator would be slashed with in dollar terms, if there's some misbehavior, which is kind of like an edge case, and it doesn't happen because nobody wants to misbehave because you have reputation and other deterrence. But yeah, that's how we use Chainlink, just to turn LRc amounts into human readable dollar.
00:32:19.390 - 00:32:22.650, Speaker B: Yeah, Kyle, yeah.
00:32:22.720 - 00:33:04.822, Speaker A: So we use chainlink in three different places. One is when you're opening a loan, we make sure that the loan is properly collateralized. The contracts aren't aware of what external prices are on their own. So we use Chainlink as an oracle to tell us that we use Chainlink again when positions need to be liquidated to make sure that the collateral really is under the margin maintenance amount. And the third place that we use Chainlink, this is kind of like a new use case in a way. Reminded me of loop ring in just that it's a different use of it. We're using it to secure our yield farming program.
00:33:04.822 - 00:33:37.038, Speaker A: So we're coming out with a yield farming program on debut this Monday. And there's two parts to it. One part is pretty simple. It's kind of done a little bit more like balancer, where there's snapshots, and then we're sending you the tokens. There's like a basket of tokens, and then we'll send people the tokens proportionally to the fees they generate. But the second part is where Chainlink is used. We're going to give people 50% of their trading fees back in the form of the BZRX token.
00:33:37.038 - 00:33:59.850, Speaker A: So this is like a longer term program. It's primarily based on what fees you pay in. So this is going to be mostly borrowers and traders. And we're trying to make these people sticky in the protocol by kind of, like, the more they use it, more deeply investing them in the protocol. So that's the third place that we use Chainlink.
00:34:01.230 - 00:34:31.182, Speaker D: And Fernando, it's just a phrase in smart pools. You can have that feed be used to do intelligent things, like, whenever there's a lot of volatility, Chainlink's prices are going up and down. You can increase the fee of your smart pool. And it's like Uber, it's like search pricing. You know, people are less sensitive to fees because there's a lot of volatility they want to sell. It doesn't matter if 0.5 or one, you increase the fees, you generate more profit for the pool.
00:34:31.182 - 00:34:51.266, Speaker D: And liquidity providers are attracted, which increases the liquidity and attracts more traders because there's less slippage now. So it's just like Uber, and that can come from Chainlink. So low volatility, low fees, high volatility, high fees, and your pool is more optimized and better suited to demand.
00:34:51.458 - 00:35:03.870, Speaker B: Got it. Awesome. Well, thank you so much to our amazing panelists. Thank you to Chainlink and smartcon for inviting us and having us here. It was such an interesting conversation.
00:35:04.210 - 00:35:05.178, Speaker D: Thanks, Tommy.
00:35:05.274 - 00:35:06.160, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:35:07.090 - 00:35:09.420, Speaker D: Thanks, Matt. Bye bye. Take care, everybody.
