00:00:00.250 - 00:00:33.160, Speaker A: So, I mean, the reason that we're talking is because we. The company that I run is a volatility centric business. I have been a Voltrader since 95. So this just goes to show how ancient I am, but it's something that I'm extremely passionate about. And so I really want to learn more about how we can maybe get into this particular space because it's so innovative and. And it just seems to leave, you know, legacy sort systems in the dust. And so we're very keen to share some of the knowledge that we have and put that into the d five space.
00:00:39.530 - 00:01:07.140, Speaker B: Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Simon Ho from T three. T three is a data provider, node operator, and data provider for the chain link network, providing a really interesting kind of data. You just gave a description about why you're excited about it, and I'm excited to learn about it. Now you got me excited. So let's just start off like, what is t three? What do you guys do? And then, if you can, what's volatility as an index? How is that different from sort of other things?
00:01:07.670 - 00:01:44.542, Speaker A: Sure. So t three index is a business that focuses almost entirely on the creation of volatility related things. So mostly indices. And the reason for this is that ever since I left university, the only thing that I wanted to do was to trade options, and I got into it deeply, and I worked for all of the major banks trading volatility as an asset class. And as I mentioned to some people, it's the only thing that I see myself doing until I don't do stuff anymore. So that's really what it is. Now, as we mentioned just a little earlier, the DeFi space is new to us, though.
00:01:44.542 - 00:02:06.980, Speaker A: So we are reaching out, trying to see how we can cross that over rather than just from the legacy world to take it into the DeFi space. Because we feel that we have been at this for so long, and I think we're pretty good at it. And so I certainly like to explore what we can do in this space.
00:02:08.410 - 00:02:38.960, Speaker B: From a DeFi perspective, it's awesome to have new, different data types in DeFi that people can create whatever they want with. Right? That's that creative space that's really exciting in Defi. For the sake of me, honestly, I was about to say for the audience, but for me and the audience, how is volatility different as an index? You're fascinated by it. Does it have mathematical properties? Does it have something special about it? So there's one is the philosophy, and then I'll do a follow up question. But first, what is it about volatility that's so interesting to you?
00:02:39.490 - 00:03:10.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess when I first started thinking about options trading and stuff, I used to go down to, there was a floor in Sydney, actually, and there was an options pit. And I was just so taken by this. They had the jackets, and there were people were screaming and yelling and so on. And I thought, oh, wow, I have to get involved in this. Little did I know it's obviously very mathematically complex. And so that I had to learn all of that, and it just fascinated me from the get go. So volatility is an asset class in its own right now.
00:03:10.042 - 00:04:04.058, Speaker A: I mean, really, the harbinger of all of this, really, was the advent or the launch of VIX, which happened in the early. And so from there, it just appeared to me that this is such a fantastic device for people to be able to either express a risk position or more importantly, to hedge themselves. Because if the SP were to collapse, like 2008, for example, and in other periods, having a volatility hedge, having a tool can really help you from losing a lot of money in those circumstances. So recently we developed two new indices in the crypto space. It was our first sort of foray into this area, and we created the Bitvol index and the Ethvol index. Of course, even I know those are the two most common and most actively traded coins. It made sense for those to be the ones that we would start with.
00:04:04.058 - 00:04:24.430, Speaker A: So, yeah, our idea here is to learn a little bit more about DeFi and see if we can bring this innovation into the same space, because we're the only ones at this point that have a tradable volatility index like these. And I certainly think that they play a very big role in how somebody could hedge or express a view.
00:04:24.580 - 00:04:45.320, Speaker B: When I think of volatility, I just understand it as a descriptive statistic. Right. Really, it just tells you something about the distribution of data over time, but you're using it as a tradable index. How is that different? How do you make that index different than just a descriptive? Is it just the way that it's tokenized and used and traded? Or are there other properties as you calculate that?
00:04:46.090 - 00:05:26.386, Speaker A: Well, the properties of the volatility itself is what is interesting, I think, for investors. So you can't hedge the way you can without using volatility. So if we wanted to hedge the S p, for example, we could buy far out of the money puts if you had a big portfolio in s P related stocks, whereas here, you don't need to do that, because if you are long volatility, the market will crash, but the volatility will go up. And so this is what's called an antifragile asset. And it's pretty difficult for investors to connect to an asset such as that. So it really does have a unique place, I think, in portfolio construction.
00:05:26.578 - 00:06:02.350, Speaker B: You're really starting to pique my interest now. Now I'm just starting to think about volatility compared to price based trading, directional trading, as that hedge, and I'm thinking about the state of the world the past two years that we've seen. And clearly there's been volatility, right, which doesn't matter whether it's gone up or down, but there's been a lot. And so now traders or whoever it is making a hedge can think about, like, well, what's next? We've had a lot of volatility. Does that bode for more or bode for less? You're starting to give me the bug here, Simon. Is that your goal is to really just get me curious? I love it.
00:06:02.500 - 00:06:39.962, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, look, this comes from my passion for it. It's genuine. For the last 20 years, I've just been so wrapped up in this, and I think it has things to offer that you just simply cannot get from another thing. Now, there's also a different thing here, which is that the behavior in the crypto space we've discovered is actually fairly different than that of s p volatility. If you compare the vix to Bitvol, they do not behave the same at all. So, for example, the distribution in equities is that the downside is far more expensive if you want to buy options there, than it is the upside, because that's the side that people need to protect.
00:06:39.962 - 00:07:05.810, Speaker A: When it comes to crypto volatility indices, we've discovered that it's far more symmetric, so it actually can blow up on either side. So in a way, it behaves more like a traditional dug out of the ground asset, like oil or natural gas, where it's sort of bimodal, you can go up and down, whereas in equities, typically it'll only go up if the market falls.
00:07:06.390 - 00:07:18.870, Speaker B: Do you think this is probably an opinion, but just in your experience, is that because of its youth as an asset class crypto, or is there less liquidity, or do you have any ideas why that might be? Because that's a really fascinating sort of finding.
00:07:19.290 - 00:07:41.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think so. I think it really is the underlying nature of the asset. Now, in natural gas and oil, for example, it's been that same way forever. Right. But in this, it may well evolve to be more equity like. I don't think that that's something that's out of the question for sure at the moment it doesn't, but it could well do that.
00:07:42.050 - 00:08:13.050, Speaker B: So let's move on to talking about use cases. So you've got these two major indices, Bitvol and Ethvall. The reason we're talking to you, by the way, for people who are joining us is these are data feeds that are available. T three is a node operator and data provider through the chain link network. And so you can import this data into your smart contracts and get it to trigger certain actions, whatever it may be, for you. D five developers, what are some of these use cases that you've thought of and that you've heard of for some of this potential smart contract developers?
00:08:14.190 - 00:08:17.482, Speaker A: Well, this is all kind of new to me. So this is.
00:08:17.536 - 00:08:20.798, Speaker B: We can speculate. This is right. This is creative brain space right here.
00:08:20.884 - 00:08:54.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. So being all new, I guess I'd say that, oh, boy. I think that the potential here is enormous because we're the first people, I think, to bring something, if not the first. We're an early adopter of this kind of stuff. But I think the benefit here for us is that most people know what the VIX is and they know what it does. So if we can say that this is a corollary of that, despite the fact that it has some behavioral differences, I think people will get it pretty quickly.
00:08:54.870 - 00:09:18.858, Speaker A: So another thing that we're thinking of doing is that we created a volatility index to compete with VIX. So VIX is the incumbent. A year and a half ago, we created and listed something called spikes. Now, our spikes contract uses spy as the underlying, not SPX. That's one differentiator. But otherwise, the correlation between the two is 99.9% correlated.
00:09:18.858 - 00:09:38.766, Speaker A: So we also want to push this into the d five space because that's more, I guess, more relevant and people understand the VIX a bit. And so they'll say, oh, well, maybe we could do one that is in a d five space. And given that it's 99.9% correlated, you're going to get the same kind of effect that you're looking for if you were to trade VIX in the legacy.
00:09:38.798 - 00:10:11.310, Speaker B: World, and you could do those on smart contracts along with other DeFi positions. So that's the idea here, is really bringing something that's very familiar in the finance arena, especially volatility traders. Volatility as a hedge, make it available in smart contracts. And then there's a ton of use cases when you start thinking about composability and insurance and all the different sort of layers of defi. If x happens, then y, then put a short on whatever it may be or long volatility. Long the spike, long bitvall or whatever it may be. That's the sort of stuff you're thinking about, right?
00:10:11.460 - 00:10:39.126, Speaker A: Absolutely, yes. I mean, look, as I said, we do not profess to know much about DeFi, but from what I've seen, there are a lot of things that are like a parallel universe to the other world. And I think that it's high time that we introduce these kinds of products. I mean, for folks that are in the weeds on this thing, to be able to have a mechanism to hedge, protect themselves, or to assume risk in this way would be very interesting, I think.
00:10:39.308 - 00:11:15.662, Speaker B: Yeah, defi, there's a ton from the traditional financial world, just in terms of, like, lending. It's basic. There's collateral and it's lent out and there's a return on it. There's not a lot of new mechanics in there. But when you start adding composability to it, then you can do really interesting things. Like all chemx has this one where it's self repaying loans and it's repaying loans. That's not the innovation, but the way that mechanism works for self repaying, because you're over collateralized and because things are secured with smart contracts and chain link price oracles, that allows this new kind of behavior and really interesting sort of model for collateralization and repayment.
00:11:15.662 - 00:11:35.318, Speaker B: So what could we do? If we can add this volatility index, which are we going to have volatility? Historically, we have volatility. Right. That's just a fact of markets. So that is. That's why it's absolutely exciting. It's like, here's a Lego block that has been on this side, now we can use it in here. And you've been wanting that special Lego block.
00:11:35.494 - 00:12:05.182, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. That's right. Something that appeals to us as well is the fact that not only is it not populated with some of these products, I know there are definitely some, but the technology that the blockchain employs is really fascinating to us. And things like real time margining that support things like perpetuals and so on, you just don't have that in the legacy world. And so that is also something that's allure for us to come and join this particular community.
00:12:05.336 - 00:12:12.120, Speaker B: Can you talk about that a little more? I'm less clear on those sorts of financial tools. How does that work?
00:12:13.130 - 00:13:01.430, Speaker A: Right. So with a perpetual contract, you have essentially got real time margining. And when it comes to something like a VIX contract, or if you buy a stock or a futures contract, it's done at a totally different speed. Everything is sort of light speed in the crypto world, but in the legacy world, it's really old and fuddy duddy. So they can't really support, they cannot support a perpetual contract because a perpetual contract, you need the ability to constantly adjust the funding or at least on certain hourly basis. You can't do that with the legacy exchange because someone like CME, they only margin once a day. So you can see that you couldn't really support a viable contract like that without it.
00:13:01.580 - 00:13:22.558, Speaker B: I did not know that. That's a really exciting use case because things are like blockchain syncs the state, right? That's what it is. It's a state machine. You can do that whenever there's a block time or whatever that happens to be. So that's a really interesting property. And then when you think about perpetuals and you add in volatility and all the different sort of elements, you can do a ton with that, right?
00:13:22.724 - 00:13:59.160, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. In fact, one of the things that we have been thinking about, which I think would be a big breakthrough between the cross areas there, is that we could have a spikes perpetual. So one of the issues with VIX is that it has what's called a very steep term structure. So if you buy the front futures contract each month, you're losing because you have to pay more. Because basically you're walking up the curve, as it were, with a perpetual, you could actually have a VIX which didn't have that, or a spikes as it happened. So it's something that I think would be extremely interesting for the community.
00:14:00.250 - 00:14:25.694, Speaker B: I am certain that some of the Defi developers who catch this will be curious. And now Defi developers, you know who to talk to. You can go talk to Simon and flush these ideas out right now, the ViX traders and spike traders, is it mainly that hedging position? What are some of the use cases? How do they go about sort of implementing that right now?
00:14:25.892 - 00:15:01.226, Speaker A: Right. So in Vix traditionally, well, you have two opposed folks. You get people who are the hedges and you get those who really want to be exposed to it. So I would say, look, on balance, I'm guessing that most people come in to trade VIX because they want to protect themselves against a calamity in the equity market. And that has proven itself time and time again whenever something has fallen, that's always worked out for us. So from that point of view. But there are also a lot of people who want to take advantage of the skewness, for example, of the VIX trade.
00:15:01.226 - 00:15:45.882, Speaker A: So in which case, it's not necessarily a directional one, but more a relative play between the surface of the Vol. But I would say, on balance, that a lot of people do like to sell volatility. And this happens maybe not so much in the futures themselves, but in their VIX ets. You'll find a lot of people, everyone from retail right through to very sophisticated people, use that very often as a proxy rather than using the futures. It's a very popular trade. The fact is that volatility decays. And so if you're short one of these etfs, for example, typically you make money until that one point where you don't make money and you've lost everything that you've ever made.
00:15:45.882 - 00:15:57.550, Speaker A: So obviously, there's a caveat there. You have to be very careful how you play. But yeah, it's a very mixed group of people in terms of the type of investor, but also how they affect their trading.
00:15:57.890 - 00:16:12.820, Speaker B: You mentioned people trade the skewness. Are you saying like, as they build their risk model, they look at different factors of volatility distribution? Not like you can trade sections of a volatility distribution. Right.
00:16:13.350 - 00:16:45.550, Speaker A: Well, actually, now that you mention it, we have created the first bitcoin SKU index, so that there strips it down just to the SKU part of the profile. So I think that is also very interesting because no one has one of those at this point, certainly not that we're aware of. And it's a thing that you can actually trade, and it has some utility. It's not just like it's there for the sake of making up the numbers. It has a genuine reason for being.
00:16:45.700 - 00:17:06.930, Speaker B: Well, you invented it. And then if I asked about it, then there's somebody that will want to put it in and trade it. So that's really interesting. Okay, let's see Simon again. Now we're getting deep into the weeds of statistical distributions and skewness and ketosis. This is exactly what my audience comes here for. So if anybody has questions, please drop them in.
00:17:06.930 - 00:17:41.486, Speaker B: We're kind of wrapping up on time, too. So for those of you who are just digging this conversation you're going to have to join t three communities, follow them on Twitter, join the website, go to the website, all that sort of thing. But before we go, I'm going to give people a chance to drop questions in there. Simon, for t three, we've covered a lot of ground here, but what are you looking at for the next couple of weeks, couple of months as you explore the DFI space? Is there more that you want to bring to smart contracts or is there other stuff you guys are building that is not ready for DeFi quite yet? Whatever you want to talk about. I'm just curious about what you're building.
00:17:41.668 - 00:18:08.920, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, on that point, we are actually building something. We're about to launch the first ever interest rate volatility index. So that to me is a bit of a holy grail simply because the biggest market in the world is interest rates. There is no interest rate volatility index for that right now. And so I've been working for the last four years on launching this thing and we are hopefully a couple of weeks away from doing that.
00:18:09.770 - 00:18:13.562, Speaker B: Is that central bank interest rates or. What kind of interest rates are you talking about?
00:18:13.696 - 00:18:54.434, Speaker A: Oh, so I'm just talking about the regular interest rates that everybody trades, us dollar interest rates and euro interest. So I think that product could be a gangbuster thing because given that it is so large and there isn't such a device at the moment there, I think it will be. Obviously, I am predisposed to wanting it to be that way. But I just think having done the work over the past four years and engaged with the, because I always spend a lot of time engaging with people who are in the industry so that I can make something that is fit for purpose. No point sort of coming out with something that nobody wants to use. So I'm very confident about the usability here and the interest in it. We have Bloomberg as our partner.
00:18:54.434 - 00:19:05.514, Speaker A: They're going to host the actual, you know, with that. I'm very excited about it. And of course the next thing, of course, is that we might want to put, I'm wanting to put it in the defi space.
00:19:05.632 - 00:19:31.890, Speaker B: Why not make it available? And if you make it available, then they will build with it. That's been the chain link philosophy for a long time, is people want price feeds. Here's a bunch of price feeds. And then they get used and defi gets built. You need safe, random numbers. Here's Chainlink, VRf, and suddenly we get amazing things built. So I love this philosophy and really learning a lot about volatility that I had not really considered as an asset class.
00:19:31.890 - 00:19:56.234, Speaker B: Thank you so much for telling me about this. Simon. And joining us, t three fascinating company, fascinating product. Bitvol and eth vault, now available through the chain link network. I have included down in the description a link to the market link site.
