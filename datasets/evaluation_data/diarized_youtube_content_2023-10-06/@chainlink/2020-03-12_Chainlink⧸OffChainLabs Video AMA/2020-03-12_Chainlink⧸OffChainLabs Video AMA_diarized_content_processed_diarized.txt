00:00:00.570 - 00:00:41.746, Speaker A: Well, I will go ahead and get started. So first off, I want to thank the arbitram off chain labs, Chainlink and blockchain community for joining us today. In addition, I wanted to especially thank Ed Filton here, who's the founder of Offchain Labs, which makes their product arbitram. Johan is not here currently. If he has an opportunity, he will be joining us a little bit later, and I'll give him a quick intro as soon as he does. So the first thing I wanted to explain was kind of the goal of this Q A, just to allow the community to learn more about integration between arbitram and chain link, exploring kind of what makes arbitram unique and beneficial to eventually the end users of these products. So for the agenda for the first 30 to kind of 40 minutes here, we're just going to have just kind of a typical AMA structure.
00:00:41.746 - 00:01:19.518, Speaker A: We have a couple of questions prepared for Ed that really gets into a little bit detail about kind of what they're building, why they're building it, what value that it brings. And then, of course, I'll pull a couple of questions here from our Q and a that are relevant. We'll ask those. And so we should be done here again in about 35 to 45 minutes. If you have any questions that weren't addressed, please feel free to obviously drop by our Reddit. I know Ed uses Twitter as well, so I'm sure if you have kind of a relevant question that pops up, he'll be more than happy to kind of answer that, or someone from that team will be happy to answer that. I'll also add any links, so I'll add any links to their social channels as well at the bottom of the description of the YouTube video.
00:01:19.518 - 00:01:33.478, Speaker A: So if you want to reach out, explore more kind of about what offchain Labs is creating, you can certainly do so. So kind of without further ado, Ed, would you mind just sort of explaining a little bit about yourself, maybe about your background and kind of how you got started in this industry?
00:01:33.654 - 00:02:08.630, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So I've been working for a long time in computer science and doing programming. I started programming as a teenager, which was quite some years ago. I've been a computer science academic, teaching at Princeton for about 25 years, taking a bunch of excursions from there to do different stuff to advise companies to. I've worked several times in the US government, most notably as a senior advisor to President Obama. And basically I've been in the blockchain space since about 2013 when I started doing research in the area.
00:02:08.630 - 00:03:00.326, Speaker B: This led to some teaching. And we created a textbook out of Princeton that is, as far as we know, the most used university textbook in cryptocurrencies, used at about 250 universities around the world. So I've been in this space for quite some time. The idea for arbitrum really came out of some of the university research, started looking back around 2014, started to look at this question of how to make smart contracts be more scalable. So we were really excited about smart contracts as a technology. They let you run any kind of computer program in a fully trustless way, so that anybody around the world can see what's happening, can trust what's happening, thanks to the beauty of doing it on a blockchain. So that's a tremendously powerful technology.
00:03:00.326 - 00:04:08.502, Speaker B: But there was this huge problem, which is that it only operated at small scale. So, like, as an example, Ethereum can run smart contracts. And so Ethereum basically gives you a sort of worldwide, shared, fully trusted computer that can operate in this trustless way, right? But that computer is really slow. It's maybe a 10th of a laptop in total capacity that has to be shared by everybody in the world, and that's not going to cut it if we're trying to build a worldwide ecosystem that can serve everybody's needs. Smart contracts are kind of in the space that I remember from my teenage years with like, the Commodore 64, a very early personal computer. It was cool enough that you could see the potential, but also you couldn't really do the things you wanted on it because the capacity just wasn't there. So what arbitrum is about, what our company is all about, is letting smart contracts scale up so that you can have a lot more performance, you can have a lot more users, you can have a lot more computation in a smart contract.
00:04:08.502 - 00:05:04.400, Speaker B: You can have a lot more storage in a smart contract, and so you can do the things that people want to do online in a smart contract. And you can get beyond what up to now have been mostly sort of toy applications. Even moderate size applications in areas like DeFi or gaming are really straining against the limits of what Ethereum can do. And so what our technology lets you do is it lets you get a lot more scale, it lets you lower the cost of operation of a smart contract a lot. And you can do that without having to sacrifice anything in terms of security, and also without developers having to completely rewrite their applications in some totally new way. So we want to make it really easy to take the stuff that already works or the methods that already work and just move them over and give them this huge turbo boost in speed. That's what arbitrum is about.
00:05:05.010 - 00:05:21.380, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you for your background of that kind of detailed description. I guess kind of playing off that you just mentioned. That's what arbitrum is about, really adding to scalability. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe the technology behind that or how it actually works?
00:05:21.990 - 00:06:19.506, Speaker B: Yeah. The key move is to get almost all of the computation and storage of a smart contract off the main ethereum chain, but to do that without giving up the security that the main chain does get you. So basically what we do is we take everything that happens inside a smart contract and it gets moved into validators, which are anybody in the world who wants to participate in making sure that a particular contract, or DAP, is running correctly can be a validator. And basically the validators do the heavy lifting. But there's a small on chain contract that makes sure that everything is correct. And the secret sauce is really in how you can move almost all the work off the main chain while still getting the security and the ease of programming that comes with the main chain application. So that's the main move that we make, just move everything off chain, or almost everything off chain.
00:06:19.506 - 00:06:24.710, Speaker B: There's just a little bit of the iceberg that sticks up above the water and is visible on the main chain.
00:06:25.130 - 00:06:30.086, Speaker A: Awesome. But you do still get kind of the finality that sort of that Ethereum block.
00:06:30.118 - 00:07:07.362, Speaker B: Exactly right. So it's still trustless. And what we mean by that is that anybody who's participating in a smart contract can force that contract to get the right result, even if everyone else in the world is against you. So even if every single other person is malicious or trying to stop you, you can force correct behavior all by yourself. And that's what you need. That's what it means for a system to be trustless is you know it's going to do the right thing. If you just are running a correct version of the software, you can be confident that the right thing will happen, and your contract is going to do what it's supposed to do.
00:07:07.362 - 00:07:32.638, Speaker B: It'll make the payments it's supposed to make to you. If you're supposed to win the game or whatever it is, whatever the rules are of your contract, they're going to get enforced correctly. Right. Even though almost all of the activity is moved off of the main chain. And that's why you get scalability. First of all, you can have separate chains for different dapps. So each DaP can sort of have its own can operate at full speed without others getting in the way.
00:07:32.638 - 00:07:49.330, Speaker B: And then because we move stuff off of this very cumbersome on chain system, we can also just go a lot faster on each chain. So each chain can have many times the performance of the whole Ethereum network.
00:07:50.230 - 00:08:19.260, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, that's very cool, very interesting. I'm sure you've been aware in this space, it's kind of, I think a lot of people think this is great, but scalability continues to be a main challenge a game developer wants to explore. And if they need something, they can do something. Lots of players doing things in a very short amount of time. Right now, it doesn't seem like Ethereum has the capability to handle something like that, but hopefully utilizing you guys or your technologies, that'll be something that in the near future can happen.
00:08:20.590 - 00:08:59.654, Speaker B: We're certainly working to get there. We have a beta version of our arbitrary roll up product that's available online now, and folks who are so inclined can go look and read the source code. It's all open source. They can read the developer docs. It's all there to try out on test chain now. And we have some even better things coming down the road, even better scalability, as well as things like different integrations, like the integration with Chainlink that make sure that you can do all the things that you want to do in a smart contract, including getting access to data feeds and interoperating with other systems that are out there.
00:08:59.852 - 00:09:00.406, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:09:00.508 - 00:09:01.046, Speaker B: Perfect. Yeah.
00:09:01.068 - 00:09:13.434, Speaker A: Well, thank you for explaining that. I know a lot of people kind of always wonder with these integrations, how does chainly come into play? And it seems like just similar just being able to grab those data feeds, feed it into the smart contracts.
00:09:13.482 - 00:09:59.622, Speaker B: Yeah, excellent. The way I think about this integration is there are sort of benefits on both sides. If you are a person who lives in the chain link world, you can take advantage of arbitram and you can get scalability and much higher performance, lower cost in smart contract computations. If you're a person who is living in arbitrum land and is really excited about what we're doing, you get the benefits of access to the Chainlink network. You get access to Chainlink data feeds in a way that's faster and more convenient, and you have the ability to use Chainlink nodes to help act as validators for your arbitrum computation. So whichever world you come from, basically you get the benefits of the other world through this integration.
00:09:59.766 - 00:10:22.050, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense, I guess, going into that, what were some of the challenges, I guess, either that sort of you faced in kind of building this, or just overall in the space obviously bringing scalability, I guess. Why did you choose this solution for scalability versus maybe some of the other stuff that's out there?
00:10:22.200 - 00:12:05.570, Speaker B: Sure. So we started out with the idea that we wanted scalability, like everyone wants scalability, right? The hard part is to get scalability without giving up trust, without giving up security, and without requiring people their applications all around or write their applications in some weird new language or sort of framework. And so in our original academic research, we figured out basically how to get scalability without giving up security, how to protect the security guarantee by basically through a model where you have these validators who are operating to make sure the chain operates correctly, and there's a kind of dispute resolution mechanism. So if the validators argue with each other, if two validators have put down stakes on different incompatible claims about what's going to happen in a contract, then we have this, I think, really clever and super efficient way of resolving the dispute and figuring out who's right on chain. So that was like what came out of our academic work then, when we wanted to make it into a product. The big challenge was how can we make this work seamlessly with the stuff that's already out there? How can we make it so that people can write their contracts in solidity? How can we make it so that you can pass tokens and ETH in and out of these arbitram chains smoothly? How can we make it easy to deploy, easy to debug? How can we make it more pluggable so that you can integrate stuff with it? That was all the stuff that turned it from an academic project where we said, cool, we can get security and scalability to the third piece, which is actually like having it work with the real ecosystem as it exists. And a lot of our product work has been there and also really pushing the envelope on performance.
00:12:05.570 - 00:13:01.014, Speaker B: We've understood, as we built this thing, we've come to understand a lot more about what are the barriers to very high performance in smart contracts. And we're doing a bunch of research which you're going to see rolling out into our product over the next six months or so, which lets us go really fast. Our goal is pretty ambitious, I think, but we want basically each chain to be able to run as fast as any normal computer. So we don't think there should be much penalty at all for running something as a smart contract, instead of just like running it on your own computer or running it on some corporate data center with all the drawbacks that come with that, where you just have to trust them to not shut down or take your data or tokens. Right. So we think you can have trust, we think you can have integration, and we think you can have it without a performance penalty much at all. We're not there yet, nobody's close to that.
00:13:01.014 - 00:13:14.060, Speaker B: But that's the target we're shooting for. And that's what I think is really necessary if this smart contract ecosystem is going to get as big as we think it's going to get.
00:13:14.590 - 00:13:32.560, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, perfect. I think that makes a lot of sense. I guess that kind of circles to a question that we got from a community member. I guess it has to do with at least as of now. How much more scalability are you seeing? I guess in terms of kind of what's out there currently, sure.
00:13:32.930 - 00:14:09.002, Speaker B: So there's lots of ways to measure scalability, and you need to be a little bit careful about it. I think you see some claims that are just like empty transactions per second. This is literally like, how many times can you tick a box per second? And that's interesting. We think we're about in terms of just like empty TPS. We think we're something like 20 times the performance of raw Ethereum for each arbitrum chain. So for each DAP. But there's other measures of scalability as well.
00:14:09.002 - 00:14:51.180, Speaker B: One of the scalability measures we care a lot about is storage. So storage in smart contracts on Ethereum is super expensive. Depending on how you count, it's 100,000 to a million times as expensive as storage on your local computer. And that's a huge barrier to doing interesting applications where there's a lot of state or a lot of users. So for us, we get the cost of storage down to basically the same cost as it is on a few times the cost on your local computer. So a huge improvement there. The other notion of scalability we care a lot about is how much computing can you do per second.
00:14:51.180 - 00:15:40.938, Speaker B: Ethereum has a global gas limit, which in Ethereum, gas is about a million gas per second, give or take. And we're seeing something like 100 million gas per second, roughly where we are right now with our open source product. And again, that's per chain. And so we're offering orders of magnitude improvement over basic Ethereum for each chain, basically on all of these measures. And this is where we are now, and we're expecting this to go up as our product develops further. So that's kind of the ballpark we're in, you can think more than ten times the performance of Ethereum for each chain and much more for some of these measures. A lot of it depends on what your application specifically does.
00:15:40.938 - 00:15:47.542, Speaker B: We speed up some things a lot more than others, but everything we speed up by a really substantial factor.
00:15:47.686 - 00:16:06.420, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. Yeah, well, that's definitely ticking the scalability box in a couple of different ways, for sure. You just spoke a little bit about Dapps and stuff. Are there any specific use cases kind of, that you're seeing sort of right out of the bat that kind of make the most sense, or what are your thoughts there?
00:16:07.590 - 00:17:11.146, Speaker B: I think two areas I would focus on are DeFi and gaming. In DeFi, especially as you get beyond the really basic initial DeFi applications that you saw, people are doing computations that are more complicated. You talk to people building more sophisticated DeFi apps, and they're talking about systems that have enough computation in them that they can do maybe one or a few transactions per second on Ethereum, and that would use up all of the power of Ethereum. So we think DeFi requires a lot of scalability as you start to move to more sophisticated applications. We've stood up on Testnet, a running example of Uniswap, as a sort of very simple defi demo. And this is one of the things, actually, we've done, which highlights the ease of porting applications across onto arbitrum. So we took a uniswap implementation of Uniswap that's written for Ethereum, that runs on Ethereum, and we ported it over to Arbitram.
00:17:11.146 - 00:17:47.970, Speaker B: We had to change about 20 lines of code total to do that port. So that was a matter of just a very short amount of time for one of our engineers. About 20 lines of code different. You just run it through our tool chain, and you can stand up a uniswap chain. But as you move on to DFI, applications that require a lot more computation, that have more complicated market structures, and more complicated derivatives, all the stuff people really want to do and are itching to do, but doesn't quite fit on Ethereum, we think that's a big area. Another big area, we think, is gaming applications of all kinds. So right now, again, if you look at something like Ethereum, you're really talking about casual games.
00:17:47.970 - 00:18:28.320, Speaker B: You can play tictactoe, but even something like chess is maybe a little bit too much. And I don't even mean like, the machine figures out what move to make in chess. I'm just talking about something that makes sure that where two players are playing and the machine makes sure you're not cheating. Even that sort of strains it. So as you go to more complex games with more players, with non player characters, with really more interesting game dynamics, you're going to have to have a lot more scalability. And so we think there's a lot in the gaming space as well. Those are two big areas that we think are going to be early in needing the kind of scalability that we're talking about.
00:18:30.370 - 00:18:51.640, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, very good. Yeah, I think those are exciting use cases. I know for our community. Obviously, Defi is a huge one, and I think a lot of people see this sort of gaming might be the next kind of big thing to hit. I just think there's got to be a couple of things being solved, maybe first, until it does. So it sounds like that's one of the things you guys are able to assist with.
00:18:51.640 - 00:19:13.440, Speaker A: Perfect. Just scrolling here through some of our questions here. Yeah, I guess so. That being said, is there anything you can share? You mentioned a little bit or maybe even if it's just where people can kind of follow your progress, but obviously you've got this beta version kind of what's sort of the next steps kind of in your team's progression here.
00:19:14.370 - 00:19:59.420, Speaker B: Yeah, we have a few irons in the fire. One is that our beta currently is of the arbitrum roll up product. So that lets you run an arbitrum chain for adapt that is open, meaning that anybody can be a validator and anybody can see what's happening inside the smart contract. We're going to roll out the sister product of that, which is arbitram channels, or side chains, basically, where you have a permission set of validators, and that can give you higher performance, and it also can give you privacy for your DaP. So that only the validators of your Dap need to know what's happening inside the. Inside your side chain. So you can expect that in a matter of weeks.
00:19:59.420 - 00:20:46.550, Speaker B: I never want to promise release dates, but we're estimating it in a number of weeks rather than months. We're moving the roll up beta toward main chain deployment. That's mainly a matter of security, due diligence. There's a little bit of feature addition we need to do, but nothing major there. And so we're going to be doing security audits and so on so that people can have the confidence in our code that people want in order to put a lot of real money on it. And then we're continuing to push performance. We have a bunch of new ideas to get potentially order of magnitude improvements in the performance of these side chains and smart contracts.
00:20:46.550 - 00:21:35.660, Speaker B: And that's the other big thing that we're pushing on. And then finally it's integrations. So we have this chainlink integration, and we're working to continue to build that out and to work with people who are interested in working across that integration developers and so on, and we're continuing to push on that. And then finally we're doing some more interesting demo applications right now, sort of the flagship demo dap that we're running is the uniswap, but we're working to run both really advanced and well known Defi Dapps on the system, as well as some, I think, really interesting gaming applications that we'll be standing up as demos. And I don't want to steal the thunder from those announcements, but I think they'll be pretty exciting when they do come.
00:21:36.110 - 00:21:52.958, Speaker A: Awesome. So I know you talked a little bit about off chain computation, and is there potential, at least in the future, for a chain link node to be able to run obviously some of this computation as well? Will that be possible?
00:21:53.044 - 00:22:54.180, Speaker B: Essentially, perhaps, exactly right. That's one of the big things that comes out of this integration, is that chain link nodes will be able to act as validators for arbitrary chains. What basically means, that means that chain link node is there, it's watching what happens on the chain, and it's making sure that it executes and executes correctly. So, I mean, this is a big thing for people who want to have the benefits of this model and don't necessarily want to have to run anything that is security critical for your chain on your own computer, or if you just want a kind of belt and suspenders approach. Yeah, I'll run my own chain, but I want somebody else who's watching over it and making sure that it is honest because of the security guarantees that our models give. You need only one validator to be present and honest in order for the right thing to happen. So if you want to hire a chainlink node or eight chainlink nodes to be validators of your chain, if you want to outsource that completely to chainlink nodes, if you're a DAP developer, that's great, and this integration will make that really easy.
00:22:54.180 - 00:23:21.900, Speaker B: And so we look forward to, and that's what the engineering teams from Chainlink and offchain labs have been doing in building out that integration. That's one of the sides where Chainlink people can take advantage of the arbitram technology at the same time, we're doing other stuff to make sure that chain link data feeds and so on are available and fast within arbitrum chain so that the integration works the other way as well.
00:23:22.590 - 00:23:43.538, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, well, yeah. Thank you for that. I know that was one of the things that really excited our community, was just saying that a lot of times it's traditional data feeds, which is obviously, which is very valuable, but I think it's that interesting part of how can this scale up, how can this community take part, potentially, in some of this scaling down the road? So that's. I know what definitely excites us.
00:23:43.704 - 00:23:58.882, Speaker B: Yeah, you're talking about something like Defi, for example. Right. The DeFi applications of the future, they're going to require off chain computation and scaling. They're also going to require really good and fast and reliable data feeds. So when you put that together, you've got something really powerful.
00:23:59.026 - 00:24:15.758, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, yeah. Thank you so much for that kind of description. Before we step away, I know a couple of people in the community had sort of expressed to me kind of how impressed they were by sort of your team and sort of who's working on that. Would you mind just sort of mentioning maybe some of the other key players kind of on your team?
00:24:15.844 - 00:24:54.390, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Let me start actually with my co founders. There are three of us who co founded the company, and as I said earlier, this all started out as an academic research project. And so the three leads on that, in addition to myself and one of the secrets, by the way, of academic research, is that the senior professor, which is what I was, is kind of the mentor and advisor. But the brains of the operation are usually the PhD students. And so the brains of this operation, while we were building it, were my two then PhD students and now co founders, Harry Kalodner and Stephen Goldfeder.
00:24:54.390 - 00:25:44.154, Speaker B: And they've done really groundbreaking work. In addition to this, Harry built Blocksi, which is one of the leading measurement and monitoring tools for monitoring the bitcoin blockchain, along with a bunch of other stuff. Stephen is, among other things, the co inventor of the threshold signature schemes that are now so hot in this community. He knows a lot about cryptography and is a computer science theory ninja, which has been super powerful. So I think we have a great team of founders and we really complement each other well. I think all three really have deep technical backgrounds, so I think that's been important for sure. We have a strong engineering team, and we have a strong engineering team as well.
00:25:44.154 - 00:26:12.180, Speaker B: Behind this. Our 9th person is going to start on Monday. Awesome. We're building up that capacity. I've been a big believer in maintaining a two pizza team. That is a team that's small enough that you can get everybody in a room and you have that kind of fluid communication, and there's no wasted effort when you have to be efficient with a small team. So we've really focused on having a small but very strong team as we built it out.
00:26:12.180 - 00:26:45.630, Speaker B: And we've been building a community, we've been building links within the community. We recognize that there's no one company that's going to build everything that's needed. And our strategy has been to plan for and build for integrations along the way. And I think that's really been working. So I think a lot of the success we've had and a lot of the success we plan to have is around working with other people in the community and helping to build an ecosystem that can really solve the problems that people need solved.
00:26:46.050 - 00:27:11.560, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, yeah. Thank you so much for sharing the background of your team. I know for me, one of the big thing was obviously yourself and as you mentioned, your other co founders. But academia, a lot of times what we've noticed, especially in this industry, is that there's people that write papers and then there's people that are basically building stuff. And this is a unique situation where you've got the research and you've actually got the building occurring at the same time.
00:27:12.250 - 00:28:18.794, Speaker B: Yeah. My attitude as an academic has always been I'm what academics call a builder, which means that I don't want to write about something unless I've actually built it. And I think there's a lot of benefits that come from that. And so we already started out toward the very practical, sort of engineering building side of the academic computer science space. But then we've really focused, since we started the company, on the stuff we need to do to make this work and to make it real and to make it integrate. And what we found is that there's a kind of sweet spot where you have the kind of level of expertise and the technical ninjas that come from that academic background, but you're really focusing on solving the problems that people need in order to make products work. And we kind of feel like we have done a good job so far at living in that sweet spot and that we really think that being able to do really deep computer science innovation has been one of the keys to what we're doing.
00:28:18.794 - 00:28:24.878, Speaker B: It's sort of our style of work. We're trying to make the most of the fact that we have that background awesome.
00:28:24.964 - 00:28:36.306, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Well, that appears to be the case. Perfect. So before we wrap it up, Ed, is there anything specifically else that you like to talk about or you'd like to touch on? Before we wrap this up, I just.
00:28:36.328 - 00:29:04.458, Speaker B: Want to invite people to reach out to talk to us if folks are interested. If you're a developer, you can look at our developer docs at developer offchainlabs.com. If you go to. All of our code is on arbitram. We have a discord offchainlabs. Follow us on Twitter offchainlabs or me, ed Felton on Twitter. Those are the places to get information.
00:29:04.458 - 00:29:31.140, Speaker B: We really love to talk to people and engage. If you're a developer and you want to use our stuff, please reach out to us. And yeah, that's basically it. As I said, this is all about building a community that solves problems for people and we are eager to engage in this community these days. We're going to do it by video and online for a little while, but we'll do it however it needs to be done.
00:29:31.510 - 00:29:53.158, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, we're definitely right there with you. At least we have the ability to do something like this these days and can share what we're building and can share some of the cool developments, even if it can't be in person right now. So first off, I just want to say hey, I thank you so much again, everyone. This is Ed Felton, co founder of Offchain Labs. Their product is arbitram. Very exciting stuff.
00:29:53.158 - 00:30:22.046, Speaker A: He mentioned just a bunch of links just a moment ago. What you'll do, if you'll give me a little bit of time, I'll get those updated here on the bottom of the description of the YouTube. That way you can do your own research or find anything more. Obviously, Twitter and things like that are great. They have a discord as well. They just mentioned if you have any questions and you're in our community and you don't know how to do that, by all means, you can certainly ask here and then I'll be more than happy to kind of redirect you to their channels and make sure you do it there. But again, Ed, thank you so much for joining us and taking a moment of your time to share with us.
00:30:22.046 - 00:30:40.230, Speaker A: We'll be sharing this video kind of throughout our community as well, probably sharing that with you so that you can share it. But it was excellent hearing you speak. Look forward to doing something again as we continue, as you guys continue rolling out things. Obviously, we'd love to get kind of updates from you and your team as you guys kind of take those next steps.
00:30:41.450 - 00:30:50.874, Speaker B: Thanks. I've enjoyed this. I'm always happy to talk about what we're doing. We're really excited about it, and we're really excited about what we're doing, and we're really excited about working with Chainlink.
00:30:51.002 - 00:31:02.780, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, again, thank you so much, Ed. Thank you so much, everybody who joined us in the blockchain kind of community, Chainlink arbitram community for joining us, and we look forward to doing this again soon. Thank you so much, Ed. Really appreciate it. Thanks.
