00:00:08.410 - 00:00:28.742, Speaker A: My name is andrew Bry. I am on the go to market team for Chainlink Labs. We help different protocols and teams integrate with the Chainlink open source protocol and then from time to time, also host community events like these. So once again, thank you guys so much for showing up. And I'd like to introduce our panel. We'll go from left to right. Mr.
00:00:28.742 - 00:00:51.414, Speaker A: Brad cam from unstoppable domains. Brad, please wave. That's brad. We'll get to you. And then we have michael Anderson from framework. Give it up for michael, founder. And then Brianna montgomery from faye protocol.
00:00:51.414 - 00:01:07.762, Speaker A: She's the founder and on the business development team over at faye. So please give it up. I'm going to stop sweating and start to sit down, so appreciate you guys for all your patience with me so far. How are we feeling tonight, guys?
00:01:07.896 - 00:01:09.346, Speaker B: Feeling good, doing well.
00:01:09.448 - 00:01:25.734, Speaker A: Good to hear. I think it might serve well to just give the crowd a bit of context of how you guys got here. Maybe started in crypto or web3 and where it's taking you guys to this point. Brianna, would you like to kick us off?
00:01:25.772 - 00:01:27.974, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, the microphone is working now.
00:01:28.012 - 00:01:28.518, Speaker B: All right, let's go.
00:01:28.524 - 00:01:30.454, Speaker C: You guys missed my joke earlier, but it's okay.
00:01:30.492 - 00:01:33.546, Speaker A: No rug pulls with the audio visual system. We're good to go.
00:01:33.648 - 00:01:56.910, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, I'm Brianna Montgomery. I'm on the founding team of Faye Protocol, which is a decentralized, scalable, algorithmic, reserve backed stablecoin. I know it's a mouthful. And my journey here started with traditional advancements in software for fintech, which led me to software, I'm sorry, security. And then I ended up managing the audit team at consensus diligence before Faye.
00:01:57.990 - 00:01:59.086, Speaker A: Thank you, Michael.
00:01:59.198 - 00:01:59.860, Speaker B: Cool.
00:02:00.230 - 00:02:34.110, Speaker D: So, Michael, one of the co founders of Framework Ventures. We're a web3 venture fund that builds alongside the investments that we make. Chain link is one of those investments. Really kind of got the start in. Well, previously I was a product manager working at Dropbox and Snapchat, so kind of have a tech background and got the start in web3 early on in the chain link ecosystem, and that kind of expanded into other protocols like synthetics and Ave. So feel like DFI was kind of the place that we got started. And it has since expanded into other categories.
00:02:34.850 - 00:02:59.078, Speaker B: Hi, everybody, I'm Brad. I'm one of the co founders at unstoppable domains. We build domains on blockchains. They are NFTs stored by you, so you own them forever, meant to be your decentralized identity. I got into crypto. I moved to San Francisco in December of 2012, I moved into a hacker house called 20 Mission. How many people were here at the last chain link event? Okay, wow.
00:02:59.078 - 00:03:19.130, Speaker B: It is worth retelling the story then. So when I moved to San Francisco, I moved into this hacker house. 40 person, 40 person building. A bunch of crypto founders were there. I think the second bitcoin exchange was launched in the basement of the building. There was an early bitcoin media channel there. In 2013, Vitalik gave a talk in the courtyard before Ethereum went live.
00:03:19.130 - 00:03:36.340, Speaker B: Pretty much everybody was in some way, shape, or form involved in crypto, and I went down the rabbit hole then and always knew I'd eventually get into the space. Finally did so in 2018, and somehow that building is still there. It hasn't been bulldozed yet, but they used to have parties until, like, 06:00 a.m. And they even shot a horror movie in there.
00:03:38.230 - 00:03:55.046, Speaker A: Lovely. Thank you. Thank you all for sharing your stories. The first question, and this is a panel of founders, just so you guys all know. And I'd like to ask what it means to be a founder. Teach you. I'd like to start with Brad, because I can retell a personal story between the two of us.
00:03:55.046 - 00:04:10.230, Speaker A: I was actually an intern. It was my first job in school at Talkable, which is a company that Brad had formerly founded before unstoppable domains. So I know he has the capacity to do this. I've seen him run many successful companies, so I think he'd be a good person to start with. Brad, what's it mean to be a founder?
00:04:10.310 - 00:04:10.554, Speaker E: Wow.
00:04:10.592 - 00:04:13.280, Speaker B: That was the best tee up for a question ever. Thank you.
00:04:14.850 - 00:04:15.694, Speaker A: I'm proud of you.
00:04:15.732 - 00:04:31.602, Speaker B: How awesome do you think you are? That's the question. I feel like I just got. So let's see. I think it's some combination of visionary and camp counselor, something like that.
00:04:31.656 - 00:05:09.946, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a good answer. Well, out of the three of us, I feel like I get the founder light badge, given that I started a venture fund, but I get to work with Founders day in and day out, and that's my favorite part of my job, and basically all I want to do with my time. I think what it means to be a founder, just from what I've seen from everybody else, is. I like your analogy. I think the other analogy is it's probably the hardest thing that most people will ever do in their professional careers. And so having empathy and understanding where people are coming from is kind of the perspective that we come from. And I really like the phrase that Mark Andreessen once said, starting a company is kind of like chewing glass and staring off into the abyss.
00:05:09.946 - 00:05:14.260, Speaker D: Eventually, you just start to light the taste of your own blood, and that's kind of what it's like.
00:05:14.790 - 00:05:24.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's just like being passionate to influence change and really take a risk to do something that you believe in.
00:05:24.550 - 00:05:43.050, Speaker A: Was there a point in your guys'careers where you knew you wanted to make that switch, where you didn't want to be in your individual contributor and wanted to take something on your own and really make your own stamp and not have maybe that safety net of someone else behind you, but you guys being out on the forefront.
00:05:44.670 - 00:06:15.780, Speaker C: Okay, I was going to say, I'll take that. So, like I said earlier, I was running the audit team at consensus diligence. So I had a very nice pipeline of being able to meet founders that just finished the code for their project that needed an audit that was going out. So I met again and again, like day and day, I'm on the phone with people that have their new projects. I'm hearing their ideas, what they're building, seeing if we can fit it into the audit pipeline. And for me, meeting Joey on one of those calls was that moment for me. He really stood out compared to everyone else and was exactly what I said earlier, super passionate about what he wanted to do.
00:06:19.430 - 00:06:44.960, Speaker B: So this one was easy for me because I was, like, the worst employee ever. And when I was 16, I had a bus boy job, and I remember just, like, hating my boss. And he was a perfectly fine person. He did nothing wrong. So it was pretty clear to me then that I would just be non functional in a normal job. So I didn't have a choice. So I just started companies starting in college, and that was just always what I did.
00:06:45.730 - 00:07:11.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for me, it was working from a couple of companies to other companies. As soon as your job becomes more than 50% political, it felt like I was banging my head against the wall every day, and you just have to kind of wake up one day and realize it's not worth it. But once you do go down that path, and once you realize there is light at the end of the tunnel, you're completely broken. You can never be an employee at a company ever again. So that's kind of how I feel about it right now.
00:07:12.490 - 00:07:24.634, Speaker A: And when you guys did cross the chasm eventually, what were some of the initial challenges that you guys faced, or getting used to that founder role? What do you think? You laughed immediately. Michael, I think we should go to you. There's something that came in your head.
00:07:24.672 - 00:07:26.620, Speaker D: Explaining to your parents what you do every day.
00:07:27.310 - 00:07:29.290, Speaker C: I still work at the bitcoin.
00:07:29.950 - 00:07:34.270, Speaker A: Yeah, my mom told me not to get a job at bitcoin when I made the jump.
00:07:34.690 - 00:07:53.406, Speaker B: I think not being sure whether you're failing or succeeding, and very difficult to tell for quite a while sometimes, and sometimes it changes in a given day. So, like, 1 hour you think you actually have something figured out, and then the next hour you think everything's terrible. So that's interesting psychologically.
00:07:53.598 - 00:08:20.780, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, things are always changing so quickly. Something that I realized early on was just the circle around you is extremely important. So making sure you have your allies aligned, and not only is it being a founder, you're also bringing in all the people closest to you. And that was extremely important to Seb, Joey and I when we went through some of the hard times for the company, is that we had this tribe of our allies and people that we could lean on to help us get through it, and it's really important.
00:08:21.310 - 00:08:41.300, Speaker D: Fully agree with both of those. I think the other one that I experienced and I think is relevant is just being able to turn it off. There are 24 hours in the day where you could be working. You have to sleep for eight of them eventually, and being able to not have work travel with you for the rest of the hours of the day is a difficult thing, but it's something that's important.
00:08:43.430 - 00:09:05.002, Speaker A: Thank you for those. And I think the challenges might be a little bit more easy to pick up on. Like, they kind of stare you in the face, but when did you guys think you hit that point of success? Or what some people call the inflection point? When did you guys think, hey, this is catching on. Hey, we might have something here. At what point did you maybe know, or has it happened? I think it has for all three of you?
00:09:05.056 - 00:09:33.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think we're just constantly into innovating and evolving and growing. So I'm not sure if we're there yet. It's probably there tomorrow. We're always going to keep going and changing, and I think with the merger with Arari Capital, we realized that we could do this with another team. We thought it was going to come organically within the community, but we're like, hey, we have this opportunity. We can actually move quicker and do the things that we want to do in this experimental, innovative way. So it's just being open to possibilities that change at a rapid pace.
00:09:37.350 - 00:10:00.106, Speaker D: A day. One mentality is sort of the only way to approach entrepreneurship. Frankly, and the second that you get complacent is the second that you start to die. And so you can't really kind of bring about this concept of, oh, we made it. Oh, we did it. I think the ways that you do start to feel happy or feel like you're scaling are when you start to have other people around the table with you and you actually have, it's not.
00:10:00.128 - 00:10:01.178, Speaker B: Just the two of you or the.
00:10:01.184 - 00:10:09.230, Speaker D: Three of you, but now you've got other people that are working on the same things that you are working on. And that feeling of amplification is a really great feeling.
00:10:10.450 - 00:10:53.754, Speaker B: I think we had a little glimpse somewhere. We went to market in January of 2019, and then I think in April of 2019, we went like miniviral on crypto YouTube, and then we saw this little bump. And then a couple of months later, it started going away. And then we had a technology issue, and then it completely went away. And then that went into a little trough of despair somewhere towards the end of 2019. And then in middle of 2020, we kind of crossed a threshold where we were pretty convinced that we had enough customers that this was going to be a sustainable company. Team was like 20 people or 15 people at that point, maybe 20.
00:10:53.754 - 00:11:20.440, Speaker B: And that was the point, middle of the summer where we said, okay, we should actually make a plan and act like a real company at some point. Like grow up, basically. And I don't actually think you should grow up before you get to that point. I think that's actually the right time to do it. You should not care at all because you're just trying to find something important in the world. And then once you have that, then I think that's when you try to do all the growing up, scaling, hiring HR, all that, all that good fun stuff.
00:11:22.010 - 00:11:30.474, Speaker A: And what makes you guys most proud of the projects that you guys are working on? What's the thing that you guys are, hey, I do this, and this is exactly why.
00:11:30.672 - 00:11:32.060, Speaker D: What's that for you?
00:11:32.910 - 00:11:57.970, Speaker C: So we brought protocol controlled value to the market, and not only did, we're being able to leverage that and utilize it through our merger with rarity capital, to be able to grow, but other teams have picked it up as well. But we're really setting ourselves up to use the PCV. And that was super innovative of us to bring to market to create this new platform for dows to be able to thrive from in the newly formed tribe Dow.
00:11:58.630 - 00:12:17.080, Speaker D: I mean, for us, it's quite different in that our success is our founder success. And so we have 87 portfolio companies and 87 founding teams and watching them flourish and do things like Ferrari and all the success that we've seen with the rest of the portfolio, that's the most exciting part for us.
00:12:18.750 - 00:12:41.840, Speaker B: I think my favorite part is the underlying ideology. I really love this idea of ownership, ownership of assets, ownership online, individual control, economic freedom. This is what gets me up every day. So I think that's my favorite part, my favorite part about crypto in general, but unstoppable in particular.
00:12:42.690 - 00:12:52.290, Speaker A: I was going to ask you guys, also the favorite part in general, but for Brad, it's ownership know, really taking hold. Michael, what for you makes you proud of this industry?
00:12:53.030 - 00:13:25.310, Speaker D: So I think what we kind of have an opportunity to do is reinvent not only just the architecture of how applications are built, but some of the core architectures of how systems work. Whether it's defi in relation to finance, whether it's Gamefi in relation to how games are built, whether it's infrastructure in terms of new computational or decentralized computational services. There is a better architecture for application development out there, and I think we get to build the base layers of that right now. And we're starting to see some of that actually develop into real apps with real scale.
00:13:26.690 - 00:13:35.620, Speaker C: And you, yeah, I think being able to scale to the mainstream will be awesome once we get there, and we're building for that right now. And I think that's extremely exciting as well.
00:13:37.190 - 00:13:51.080, Speaker A: And in hindsight, what do you think you guys wish you knew about starting a what? Another laugh. Michael, I want you to kick us off. There's something immediately that you're like, I wish I knew this.
00:13:51.690 - 00:14:19.466, Speaker C: You want a second? So I think just going back to the point that I made earlier, just if you're going to start a company, be really nice to all your close friends, your mentors, your family, because you're going to really need them through the good and the bad times as well. And also, if you're thinking about starting a company, talk to the tribe. Dow that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make it super easy for you to spin up a company. And we have a new product that's going to come out called a one click dow. Sorry, I needed a little bit of a shell.
00:14:19.578 - 00:14:22.640, Speaker A: One click dow oh, yeah.
00:14:23.010 - 00:14:56.860, Speaker D: I think generally the thing that I've experienced is it's way harder and way more fun than you would ever expect. And so as you start to dig in, you just be prepared for lower lows than you would have ever expected and also higher highs. And so it's a spectrum of emotions, and it'll fray people to the edges. And so that's why you need the support system, but it's really fun to do it with other people as well. And so finding the right team being to embrace the change is really. I thought I knew what I was talking about, but definitely didn't until I started it.
00:14:57.310 - 00:15:40.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I would say this seems kind of obvious, but I guess I would say people and recruiting. I think that there's like a theoretical version of a company where you're like building a product and getting users and doing all of this user testing, and it's almost like kind of mechanical. And then the reality is just people all day, all day, every day, even the engineers, it's all just people and trying to figure out how to get everybody to work together and all that stuff. So, yeah, that's why I said the camp counselor line. I think that's like the most surprising thing. And it's totally not the way that I think it feels on TV. It's not the way it feels on Silicon Valley, on like, it doesn't feel anything like that.
00:15:40.520 - 00:15:57.120, Speaker B: It feels mostly around. You're not just like sitting in a room building some product and then magically it gets noticed. It's just like all this grind of getting more and more people on your side slowly, employees, people in your network, customers, et cetera, et cetera. So, yeah, it's just people all the time.
00:15:58.050 - 00:16:15.990, Speaker A: And I was thinking about this earlier on my drive in. What lessons have you guys taken from the previous web two route as like ways to scale companies? There'll be a second part to that question, but from our predecessors, what do you guys think you learned?
00:16:16.730 - 00:16:20.166, Speaker C: I'm a bit distracted that you drive a car, so I'll let someone else go.
00:16:20.188 - 00:16:24.022, Speaker A: 1St 2 hours away Stockton, California way.
00:16:24.076 - 00:17:21.642, Speaker B: Over well, I think there's like, maybe not as many. Well, it kind of depends on what you're trying to do. So we're trying to be the coinbase of the decentralized web. So we are a company. We're not trying to build a new paradigm for governance and control. There's a lot of interesting stuff happening there in the Dow world, but that's maybe like a slightly different task or thing or problem to solve. So I think there's maybe fewer differences than are being painted, with the exception of, I would say, ownership as this key idea that you can leave the platform no matter if you don't like what they're doing, you don't have that power in a lot of web two, and then just like the superpower of community, although community is quite common in Web two, so most of the things that you hear being hyped up as unique to web3 or not, I would say, like 99% really just the ownership thing.
00:17:21.642 - 00:17:34.000, Speaker B: I think you can reduce a lot of crypto down to the ownership thing, candidly. So, yeah, I would say maybe slightly fewer differences than is currently popular on crypto Twitter right now.
00:17:35.010 - 00:18:00.390, Speaker C: I guess just to kind of take that a step further, I think with these dows that we're operating in, if we could translate over some of the accountability that comes from more of a structure of having a manager and having someone to report to, being able to have follow up deliverables after meetings, being able to know who is the point of contact for said thing that you want to happen. I think that's something I would like to see translated over in this flat organization that we're creating. It's the accountability aspect.
00:18:01.610 - 00:18:55.814, Speaker D: I was literally going to say in many cases with dows related to companies, and both are very much happening, and both are very much viable for the web3 world. In many cases, decentralization kind of equates to disorganization. And so having a more structured environment for what a Dow is doing, everybody's swimming in the same direction. But then the other element that I think is important is alignment of incentives. And maybe it's not talked about as often, but one of the strongest structures that I think Web two proliferated is just the concept of alignment through equity or whatever structure a company is kind of operating under, which didn't used to be the case for many, many decades of corporate America. And I think aligning incentives across a wide organization of people with different perspectives and different skills is really the superpower that we unlock with DAOs instead of companies. Companies versus dows are basically the same thing.
00:18:55.814 - 00:19:12.960, Speaker D: It's just that you have a global reach, of a global concept of an LLC, as opposed to a natural LLC that's based in the same area. And so that, I think, is the power of where we're going. And it looks kind of the same if you squint it to the future. But alignment of incentives and organization is really what it comes down to.
00:19:14.530 - 00:19:41.564, Speaker A: Thank you. And this question is a little bit more for the, I guess, what's on the bleeding edge, but what might you guys be most excited for? It's alpha time. One laugh. Not all at once, but if there's something really is exciting you, if you think we already answered that with what you're most proud of.
00:19:41.762 - 00:20:12.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like I kind of touched on a lot of it. I was talking earlier how before coming back to San Francisco to join the founding team of Fay, I was living in Mexico City with all creatives and artists and everyone that I met a year ago. If you flash forward one more year, we're like hacking on an NFT project together on our Friday nights, and they had no idea what crypto was before. So what's really exciting to me is new people coming in from every background, every walk of life, every interest, every skill set that's really getting into this field, and that's what really excites me.
00:20:13.500 - 00:20:57.720, Speaker D: Yeah. It is also kind of the same thing that I just said as well. But I do think that unlocking the potential of an organizational structure like a Dow, and this may be a crazy kind of prediction, but I think in the next 30 years, you're going to see about 25% of us GDP going through dows. And that is kind of in the same vein as what amount of GDP goes through LLCs currently. And when we can unlock that with a new capital structure, with a new organizational structure, the world is kind of limitless in terms of what you can do and how work looks, and everybody talks about the future of work and what that means for knowledge workers or people who can contribute in whatever way they can. And I think that's contributing through a Dow.
00:20:59.020 - 00:21:49.530, Speaker B: I think identity is a really big category that if we're talking about things that are, like, going to peak soon, I think identity is one of those categories that's potentially going to peak soon. And there's a couple of big problems. There's a problem with traditional Internet where you don't know if somebody is actually themselves or not. And there's all kinds of fake profiles on Facebook and other places like that. And then there's a problem in the crypto world where you know 100% that a particular wallet, the owner of a particular private key is taking certain actions, but you don't know who that person is or have any verified information about them. So there's like a problem in the old world and a problem in the new world, and blockchain based identity, I think, can potentially be a game changer for both. So, yeah, that's probably my pick.
00:21:49.900 - 00:22:08.476, Speaker A: Thank you. I've got one more question, then we're going to open it up to the floor for any of you guys that may have Q and A. I always like asking smart people this one. What books would you recommend to the audience? Out there or things that you might say, read this, whether that's being a founder crypto in general or this is.
00:22:08.498 - 00:22:41.208, Speaker B: A really easy one for me right now because I just recently fell down the Ray Dalio changing world order rabbit hole. So if you have talked to me in the past month, you've probably had to hear me talk about it. So, yeah, I'd have to pick that. Basically, it's basically like a mathematical view of history, and it's far better than what historians and political science experts have because it's based on math, so it's just a lot more useful. And it's a model. And, yeah, it'll change your view on history.
00:22:41.294 - 00:22:49.944, Speaker A: This is cringe, but I have his pinwheel of the five processes for the principles, like, taped on my desk, so I like that as an answer. Yeah.
00:22:49.982 - 00:23:08.770, Speaker B: Basically what happened is that this guy, who's a hedge fund manager and has this massive data set on the entire world, got super old old and got super worried about the world and decided to share it with us. Whereas a normal move for a hedge fund manager would just be keep it and invest. And I think he just got old enough that he decided to share it with us. So we should be very lucky for that.
00:23:09.780 - 00:23:39.390, Speaker D: Second, that. That's a great read. The one that I thought was most enjoyable kind of recently, but it's also super illuminating, is ten maps that change the world. And it's effectively the different maps of different eras of different nations. And it's kind of along the same lines of who was in power and why, based on the technology that they had and sort of the position that they had in the world. And it's just a fascinating study, basically through geography, of the history of kind of hegemony throughout different nation states throughout the world.
00:23:40.400 - 00:23:56.290, Speaker C: So mine is super cliche, and I'm almost embarrassed to say it, but I think the four hour work week really helped me a ton. Being able to learn how to delegate, especially in a founding position, and having so many things that you have to do is extremely important. So that one's always good for me.
00:23:56.660 - 00:24:14.310, Speaker A: Thank you guys so much for your patience, not only with me, but also sharing all the great insight for these folks. Please start raising some hands. Let's get some questions from the general audience. If there's anyone who has anything we like to ask these folks. You, sir.
00:24:14.680 - 00:24:22.008, Speaker F: So you mentioned at one point you went through, like, a period where the technology caused some problems. I just thought it'd be cool to.
00:24:22.014 - 00:24:24.010, Speaker E: Hear more about what that was like at the time.
00:24:25.900 - 00:24:35.550, Speaker B: Oh, technology caused some problems. Yeah, we broke the blockchain that we were on, and the entire blockchain went down, and then they had to repair it for, like, seven weeks. It's pretty bad.
00:24:38.160 - 00:24:39.250, Speaker A: That is bad.
00:24:39.860 - 00:24:55.780, Speaker B: Yeah. And we picked it, so it wasn't like we could just blame somebody else. So we looked bad, too, and it never got, I guess, fully fixed, and we wound up deploying most things on ethereum. So, yeah, not a glorious period.
00:24:57.560 - 00:25:01.824, Speaker A: Thank you, Royce.
00:25:01.952 - 00:25:11.716, Speaker E: Yeah. Quick question. I know you guys mentioned parents. The guy was old enough to be our grandparent in the White House, getting ready to make some regulations in the beginning of February.
00:25:11.908 - 00:25:14.890, Speaker F: Curious, what do you guys think is coming?
00:25:20.800 - 00:25:29.020, Speaker D: I think generally what's going to happen, especially with that, is going to be requests for research and less actual action.
00:25:30.800 - 00:25:35.890, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly what our GZ told us this morning, so I'm going to just plus one to that.
00:25:36.820 - 00:26:00.184, Speaker B: I think our lawyers are probably in some of the same clubs, but it does seem like there's potentially some DeFi regulation that's being contemplated. Feels to me like there's a war right now amongst the pro business versus the not as pro business democrats. So I think it's kind of hard to tell exactly which direction they're going to go because they're actively fighting with each other publicly right now.
00:26:00.302 - 00:26:03.592, Speaker C: Yeah, it's going to take a lot of time for anything to happen, is what I've been told.
00:26:03.646 - 00:26:04.730, Speaker B: That's always good.
00:26:07.920 - 00:26:25.200, Speaker F: So this is for the founders, mainly. How do you feel like the ideation and validation process for your startup at the beginning was different for a crypto application or adapt than it is for a web? Two SaaS.
00:26:29.680 - 00:27:02.250, Speaker B: Maybe I'll answer a slightly different question. I think there's a pretty big difference between a B to B and a B to C discovery process, potentially, because for a B to B, you should basically be able to get people to agree, like they would pay you even before you build it. In fact, I think you probably shouldn't start building until you at least have talked to some and they want to pay you for it. Whereas for A, B to C, like, you can't ask people because they have no idea and they won't know until they see it, and even then, a lot of people won't get it until it's better. So, yeah, tougher for B to C.
00:27:05.980 - 00:27:21.356, Speaker C: I don't really think there's a response on my end for this just because we're a stablecoin. Everyone knows that there's, like, a ton of stablecoins out there. Everyone's trying to be innovative, create an algorithmic stablecoin that's decentralized. There's been a lot of alternatives, so I don't really think there's a translation for that in the web.
00:27:21.378 - 00:27:21.950, Speaker G: Two.
00:27:26.420 - 00:27:29.024, Speaker A: Please. Back there.
00:27:29.222 - 00:27:39.670, Speaker F: Steve, you were an engineer before and you're now founder. What things would you focus on? What would you like? Focus on trying to absorb as much as possible.
00:27:44.520 - 00:28:12.110, Speaker C: I would suggest getting an executive coach early on in the process. I think it's really helpful as well just to learn, just to take your engineering skills aside and focus on more of the business side of things and have someone that's on your side and super supportive. That's not maybe as tied in as much like not drinking the same Koolaid as you every day. I think it's super important to get outside of your circles and try to get advice and mentorship from people that aren't in this space like we are every single day. It's really important to do that.
00:28:13.200 - 00:28:28.912, Speaker B: I would do the sales yourself early for the company. I would do that yourself. I think you'll learn a ton, and eventually you need to manage that part of the business too. So early on, especially, you'll be the best at it anyway. So that'd be my advice.
00:28:28.976 - 00:28:31.796, Speaker C: Maybe read a sales book too, if.
00:28:31.818 - 00:28:33.510, Speaker D: Not sales, customer support.
00:28:38.060 - 00:28:48.250, Speaker F: Question for Michael, actually. What's the most important factor for you? While pitching when startup raising, what's the most important factor for you?
00:28:50.080 - 00:29:20.150, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think in retrospect, looking back at all of the founders that we've spoken with and ones we've chosen to work with, I think the best heuristic of success, or at least success thus far, is the maniacally competitive spirit that they can showcase. And the more competitive they are, the better, frankly, because if they're more competitive with themselves and versus other people, they're going to be the best versions of themselves and they can figure it out.
00:29:20.680 - 00:29:25.190, Speaker B: Was that advice to get five term sheets in a deal? That's how I took that.
00:29:27.340 - 00:29:32.200, Speaker C: Isn't that like the Mackenzie kind of go to market strategy to hire all the college athletes?
00:29:33.660 - 00:29:59.730, Speaker D: I don't know about athletes, but I think generally. Here's an example. We invested in a company called Synthetix, started by a guy named Kane. Warwick got introduced to his three younger brothers, who started alluvium, which is a game, and we invested in that as well. Alluvium is now bigger than synthetics, even though it started about a year and a half afterwards. And Kane and his brothers are not on great speaking terms right now.
00:30:01.860 - 00:30:02.128, Speaker G: I.
00:30:02.134 - 00:30:05.750, Speaker A: Have a meme to share with you about the Alluvium Kane relationship.
00:30:06.760 - 00:30:19.430, Speaker E: You, sir, a lot of companies right now are witnessing sort of the bottlenecks of cross chain unwrapping solutions for consumer payments. I'm just wondering how much you feel like that's holding industry back and how.
00:30:22.450 - 00:30:25.678, Speaker D: Sorry, consumer payments bottleneck based on technology.
00:30:25.844 - 00:30:27.710, Speaker E: Well, cross chain on ranking.
00:30:31.130 - 00:30:43.398, Speaker C: So for us, our focus is to be really good at one thing. And right now we're focusing on Defi. So that's not something that I'm spending too much time thinking about right now. Someone else will solve it, but we're going to be really good and we're going to win Defi. That's kind of the goal for us.
00:30:43.564 - 00:31:16.242, Speaker B: I think I have an unpopular view on that. My favorite types of views. Yeah. Which is that I think the way that the competition is going to create competing layer ones is dramatically damaging the user experience by putting users on dozens and dozens of different blockchains. And the incentive is to keep going. Like the incentive is to disinteroperate, actually. Now there's a lot of great stuff and L2s and all kinds of other good things happening as well, but there's a massive financial incentive to not do that.
00:31:16.242 - 00:31:26.626, Speaker B: And I think unstoppable is suffering because of this. It's way, way harder to provide good apps for users because of this problem.
00:31:26.808 - 00:31:51.600, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really hard to be good at everything too. Just kind of like add back on to my point. So our focus is on layer one, ethereum right now. So for us, with our, we're all resource constrained. Right? So for us to put all of the effort into all of these other l two s and other multichain strategies, it's just not feasible for us. So we're focusing, putting all of our resources there and then we're going to partner to maybe build out. But right now we're thinking about l one and going to move to l two later.
00:31:52.850 - 00:32:19.186, Speaker D: Only thing I'd add to those other great points is I think consumer payments is actually going to be one of the last problems that we solve, mostly because the scale, and therefore transaction costs that are required to do it at scale are just so untenable at the way that blockchains are working right now that it's probably years away from being viable, at which point we'll figure out which blockchain won't.
00:32:19.298 - 00:32:38.240, Speaker E: So you are founders? Yes. And being founder is hard job, but I'm a sole founder. So what do you think about. Is any of you solo founders? Well, and what do we think about being solo founder? Is it really hard or it just.
00:32:41.970 - 00:32:51.140, Speaker B: I'm not personally a solo founder. I actually haven't tried it yet. I think there's benefits to both.
00:32:54.150 - 00:33:11.160, Speaker C: Yeah, not me either. I think I kind of alluded to this earlier. I think early on it was like sub Joey and I in the circles that we brought in to help us through tough times to get where we are today, which was extremely important. So I don't think we would be here today if it wasn't for all of us really grinding together.
00:33:12.170 - 00:33:26.010, Speaker D: Likewise for me. I think you can kind of figure out the ways to compensate for that by finding a great initial set of people to surround yourself with. And whether that's a co founder or whether that's an initial set of great people, it can be solved.
00:33:26.690 - 00:33:46.820, Speaker G: I have a question that kind of builds off that. What do you think makes a good set of co founders? Or is there any, I guess, recommendation or advice you have for finding a good co founder to work with and really establishing that relationship?
00:33:50.550 - 00:34:05.698, Speaker C: Just spend a lot of time with them before you commit to anything. I think you're going to be spending a lot of time together, so make sure that it's a really good fit and as much as you can, maybe even rent a place together for a week or try to spend a lot of close time together, I think it's.
00:34:05.714 - 00:34:16.710, Speaker B: Good if you have a technical leader and a business leader, and I've personally only done it with people that I was friends with for ten years before. I know there's other ways out there to do it, but that's what I've personally chosen.
00:34:16.870 - 00:34:29.890, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's cliche, but finding your co founder is kind of like getting married, and so you want to find someone who has complementary skill sets, whatever those may be, for whatever you're trying to solve, and someone you can just trust implicitly.
00:34:32.070 - 00:34:40.786, Speaker A: I think we'll take two more questions. I appreciate you guys time to this point. And then if you have two more, go crazy waving your hand right here.
00:34:40.888 - 00:34:56.810, Speaker E: Hi. How did you manage risk before starting the company? Were you like, I'm going to have this much savings before I jump into this, so that if it doesn't work, I have a fallback strategy, at least for a while, especially in your case as well. You were a product manager in Facebook and Snapchat.
00:35:01.150 - 00:35:21.470, Speaker B: I brought my spend to an absurdly low level. I didn't have a kitchen when I started the company. I just had, like, a room I was renting, so I just got my expenses really low. And then I had a few years, but didn't want to keep living like that. So glad. Didn't take longer than a couple of years to get somewhere.
00:35:22.210 - 00:35:26.500, Speaker D: Yeah, we started frameworking my parents basement, so same idea.
00:35:27.590 - 00:35:39.080, Speaker C: I mean, we're always very cognizant of our Runway and we don't have that many expenses, to be honest. It's just salaries in our office. And other than that, that's it. And we know what it is at all times.
00:35:40.090 - 00:35:49.510, Speaker A: No kitchen is. Most rooms have kitchen. That's crazy. And last question. Hey, right there. Very quick.
00:35:49.580 - 00:35:56.780, Speaker G: Hello. What would you suggest for postgraduate college student athletes getting into.
00:36:01.730 - 00:36:03.674, Speaker A: Good general? How to get into crypto.
00:36:03.722 - 00:36:22.020, Speaker B: I guess for those curious, go to stuff like this. Yeah. And meet people and start talking to companies. The biggest thing you got to figure out is what kind of job you want, like what part of an organization you want to work on. That's the thing that's going to prevent a company trying to give you a job from knowing which one to give you.
00:36:24.950 - 00:36:39.622, Speaker C: Just on top of that, going to events like this, but also in the online world as well. So go join the discords. Start contributing. Start being active. Say Gm to everybody. Just be involved, know what's going on. Start holding some tokens, maybe vote on proposals, just proposals.
00:36:39.622 - 00:36:42.410, Speaker C: Just start being part of different communities.
00:36:43.070 - 00:36:57.920, Speaker D: Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. I think anyone can contribute in whatever way they can. It could be even just like making memes, if that's something that you're into. And any contribution is usually widely appreciated within the communities. And so anyone can kind of start doing whatever they want to do.
00:37:00.980 - 00:37:07.440, Speaker A: Well, thank you guys so much. Really appreciate your time. Please, folks, give it up for these wonderful founders.
00:37:09.300 - 00:37:10.592, Speaker B: Thanks to the chain link group.
00:37:10.646 - 00:37:11.570, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:37:12.100 - 00:37:22.676, Speaker A: Absolutely. And we have this space until about 08:00 p.m. There is tons of golden Boy pizza. I hope you're hungry. I think I am. Get out there, please. Mingle, talk with amongst yourselves.
00:37:22.676 - 00:37:27.230, Speaker A: And once again, thank you, these wonderful founders, for being up here and sharing all their wisdom.
00:37:27.230 - 00:37:36.936, Speaker G: Channel you, our.
