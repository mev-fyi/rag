00:00:02.410 - 00:01:01.920, Speaker A: So you announced a new partnership with PwC. Tell me more about that. That's very exciting because we're seeing a lot of enterprise and capital markets interest in integrating with blockchains and integrating with cryptocurrency systems, which is what we specialize in, in our work on Chainlink. It's literally in the name Chainlink. We connect these systems to various blockchains very efficiently. So the partnership with PwC is one of many, one of the early ones, one of the ones that we're going to focus a lot on that is going to scale up that interaction with capital markets and enterprises by allowing PwC to basically help them implement this efficient way of interacting with blockchains, which is what Chainlink does. And I think you're going to be seeing more and more of that because I've been speaking with the capital markets ceos and various other folks for years, and I'm seeing a renewed level of interest that has less to do with speculation and much more to do with the value of the technology.
