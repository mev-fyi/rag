00:00:00.090 - 00:00:41.540, Speaker A: Think we'll start to see DeFi and tradfi converge. And I do firmly believe that banks, asset managers, and tradfi in general are the largest net customer of all DeFi protocols. We just haven't reached that place because they can't efficiently transact with each other either on a legal basis or a technical basis. And both of those problems are being solved. So the legal clarity is coming. And on a technical basis, you have some of the things that we built, like CCIP, which is now being used in web3 and in banking. And if both web3 uses CCIP to connect with each other, and banks use CCIP to connect their DLT solutions, then you can be on a single standard where banks and web3 applications can interact with each other.
