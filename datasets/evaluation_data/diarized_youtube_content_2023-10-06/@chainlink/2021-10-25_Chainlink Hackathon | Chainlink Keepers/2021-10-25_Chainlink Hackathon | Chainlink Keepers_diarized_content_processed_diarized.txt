00:00:40.630 - 00:01:16.978, Speaker A: Hello. Hello everybody. Yes, I'm very happy to be here and today I will talk about keepers. Well, I am Solenjigerus, but you can call me Saul and I am a new developer advocate here at Chainlink. Let's share my screen again. Okay, perfect. So how to use chain link keepers before, like I said before, my name is Solesh Garos.
00:01:16.978 - 00:02:13.046, Speaker A: So you can touch, you can be in contact with me. And this what we are doing today. So we need to see some requirements to use the chain link keepers, how it works, what we are doing then we are creating Ismat concept. This is a basic concept, only a counter and understand what is happening, how keepers can help our counter because it will update our counter. We are publishing verify, create the upkeep job in the Keepers app and follow the result. So let's go. First of all, I like to invite you to go to this link because I can interact with you.
00:02:13.046 - 00:02:57.560, Speaker A: So in this link I'm putting all the links that I'm using here and you can be with me. So let's put our name here. I'm putting my name, you can put yours and I will come back to the tutorial to understand our requirements. Okay. Because you need to do this and I will do some explanations and you can do the requirements in the meanwhile. So these are the requirements, okay. And let's do it.
00:02:57.560 - 00:03:37.158, Speaker A: So I hope you are trying to put these requirements, okay, you need to have the metamask installed. So you can install it now. Have some ethers on coven network. We are using the coven testnet, ethereum testnet. You need to have some link token on the coven network. It will be great if you use remix before, but if not you can just learn now. And we need to verify source code of our smart contract on atarisca.
00:03:37.158 - 00:04:41.110, Speaker A: Okay, so why we need keepers think that smart context, they cannot interact with the word out of the word out of the context. They are passive, they cannot trigger, they cannot initiate nothing itself. They need some external agent to interact with him. So Jesus keepers, the keep it is a job that will interact with our smart content. Well, the changes in the ismat content only occur when a transaction is initiated by another account, external account or another smart contract. So we are doing this just now. So this is the keepers.
00:04:41.110 - 00:05:31.794, Speaker A: We have a decentralized network of nodes. It's very important because everything here in chain links is to be decentralized. This is our core and we have these nodes, they are incentivized to perform the registered jobs. We call it the upkeeps. So you can use this to check some conditionals and send transactions for as much contents. Like this we have as much content that can interact with other as much contents. And in every block the keepers are checking the register for some upkeeps.
00:05:31.794 - 00:06:19.720, Speaker A: What can be run in this moment. And then we find some job that needs to be run that you need to run some transaction. You do it, the keepers will do it. It's important that the keepers are submitting a transaction with our data. And like I said before, let's do it in a practical way. Let me check the chat a faucet address. Hey guys, I can help you here.
00:06:19.720 - 00:06:56.734, Speaker A: Are you at in our. So I'm following this tutorial. This is in my GitHub just now and welcome Sam Frost, Vincey, Mohammed, Autumn and Wayne. Good to see you with me. And I'm checking. Like I said before, I'm using this tutorial and we can do this together. Okay, so it's important to have our match content must be compatible with keeper.
00:06:56.734 - 00:07:26.940, Speaker A: So we need to have some specific points. In fact, we need to use the compatible keeper interface with these two functions, the check upkeep and the perform upkeep. We only need this. So let's create our first match content. To do this I'm using remix. We know that remix is very easy to start something like this. So you can go with me.
00:07:26.940 - 00:08:04.630, Speaker A: Yes, I'm adding all the links and everything that you need here in the pad and you can do with me. I may follow you. I can help you. Okay, so let's do it. I am rearing himex our smart content. It's calling counter sol. And what I have in this smart content, I have it here.
00:08:04.630 - 00:08:50.046, Speaker A: I have a lot of things here but let's do it. You can copy and paste this smart contract to be easy from begin to end. Don't have any depths. I already have my smart contract here. Let's do this bigger for you. I think now is better. So what I have in my smart content, like I said before, I need to use this interface, the keeper compatible interface which has two functions, the check upkeep and the perform upkeep.
00:08:50.046 - 00:09:28.718, Speaker A: So Mysmart content is only a counter but it will be updated by the keeper. So I'm using the interface here. It's easy. I have a counter. The counter must be updated in some interval that I define when I am deploying this match content. So this is my interval and I'm also saving the last time that my counter was updated. So in the constructor I may only define the interval and set the variables, watch the interval.
00:09:28.718 - 00:09:59.954, Speaker A: The last time is when I was creating this and the counter start on zero. Okay. And we have only the functions that I defined here, the check upkeep and the perform upkeep. What I'm doing the check upkeep. I'm only checking if I need to update this. Like, are you defining interval here? And I check. It's time to do this update.
00:09:59.954 - 00:10:36.514, Speaker A: It's time to do something. Okay. And then if it is, I can use the perform that you run the function that it's defined. The function is defined in the perform upkeep. So here I update the last timestamp. IU increase my counter and it is done. In fact, for this, I'm not in use with the perform data because I don't need another parameters.
00:10:36.514 - 00:11:08.994, Speaker A: I don't need more information. Okay. It's very easy. So if you have some depth, I can check you here. Okay, let's do something together now. You put the counter counter. Let's publish it and put our name and address.
00:11:08.994 - 00:11:30.134, Speaker A: Okay, let's do it. I am here on remix. So this is my smart context, like we said before, I have another things that I need to. I don't need this. And this, it's supposed to. Don't have nothing of this here. Okay, here is the counter.
00:11:30.134 - 00:12:15.266, Speaker A: Let me check what's happened with my counter? Oh, it's okay. If your counter did not compile automatically, you can check this, the out compile or click on compile counter sol. And then let's deploy it. Important, when you are deploying, you need to define the interval for me. Now, I'd like to update this in 15 seconds because we need to be fast here in the workshop. So let's do it now. I'm doing on metamask config and in a few seconds I have mysmatch content published.
00:12:15.266 - 00:12:33.150, Speaker A: So it's done. Let me check here. This is the order. I did this now. So I put this. Let me check the question. Ah, wow.
00:12:33.150 - 00:13:06.898, Speaker A: Your question. It's a big complex for this moment, but I'm sure that you can ask in our discord later and we have more persons that can help you. Okay, the green guy. Who's the green guy? I don't know. So is this. Yes, I'm checking your messages, guys. I will come back here in a few minutes.
00:13:06.898 - 00:13:48.866, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Are you come back in a few minutes and I try to help you here. Okay. If you have some problems, remember that we have the tutorial and the tutorial can help you. Okay, here is the tutorial. Okay, so let me come back now. I have my counter published and in order to use the keepers I need to verify my contract on Atrisca.
00:13:48.866 - 00:14:32.818, Speaker A: So I copied the address and I came here on the ateriscan and I found my contract just now. So in order to. You. Okay, I think it's done now. So verifying, remember that we need to verify the contract. So I'm here, I'm going to the contract tab. You can see the bytecode but not the source code.
00:14:32.818 - 00:14:56.890, Speaker A: So I click on verify and publish. This is my smart context. The compiler, this is a single file because I put everything in the single file to be easy to use on remix, the compiler version. I didn't remember. Let me check it. 86. Okay, let's use the 86 and this is mat file.
00:14:56.890 - 00:15:20.394, Speaker A: And continue here. I need to paste my smart context search code. So let's come back to remix. Control A, to copy. Control C, select and copy control V. And here we are. This is my 15 seconds.
00:15:20.394 - 00:15:49.182, Speaker A: Do you remember? This is the argument here. The F is the 15 seconds. So I'm not a robot. Palmett, let me check the palmetries. I think it's this. And verify and publish. You can put your name and your as much content, your counter address published here.
00:15:49.182 - 00:16:21.686, Speaker A: Maybe we can do together. I can do something with your smart content. I can check it if you like it, I can check it live. Okay, so it's done. Perfect. Now I have my smart content published here and we can go to the next step. Let's check where we are now and where we need to go.
00:16:21.686 - 00:16:42.414, Speaker A: We compile it, we publish, we check it on remix. No we didn't. Let's do it now. So this is the remix and this is my smatch content. This is the performance keep. I'm not doing this or this. But the counter started on zero and we have the 15 seconds and date.
00:16:42.414 - 00:17:26.460, Speaker A: Much content was published on this time. Okay, you need now to have link on coven too. You need to go to the faucet. Okay, great. Nova and Vince, I can check your ismatch context. Nova, let me check it. For example, I can come here and this is the same as much content but you use the H address to use your address not mine.
00:17:26.460 - 00:17:55.524, Speaker A: And let me check. Okay, counter zero and interval zero. I think you have as much counter will be crazy because it will be updated every second. Wow, it's crazy. It's interesting. Over to publish it again using here. Put some interval here in the deploy.
00:17:55.524 - 00:18:28.210, Speaker A: Okay, let's continue now where I am, I need to go to the next step. The next step we verify in the territory. We have a link token. Oh, it's here. Now let's go to the keepers link. Okay, I am in the coven. No, we cannot use the keepers with phantom just now in the future.
00:18:28.210 - 00:18:58.350, Speaker A: Okay. Some guy can help this. If nobody helps you do it at the end. Okay, so this is the keepers. And what can I do here? First I need to connect my wallet. Probably my wallet is connected but you need here to connect your wallet with the chain link keepers. Okay.
00:18:58.350 - 00:19:23.076, Speaker A: And then I have some upkeepers like a lot of counters. But now I'm doing a register. New upkeep is this, this is very important because we have some important info to do this. Okay, the email address. It's your email address. You can do any mail. I use my personal.
00:19:23.076 - 00:19:57.550, Speaker A: No problem now. Okay, the counter, the name counter, the address. What's my last keeper? Where is the address? Here. It's now. Oh, great to see guys, you did a lot. But Matteo, I think here I'm asking the address of the counter that you publish, not yours. Okay? Think that this is your address, not of yours much content.
00:19:57.550 - 00:20:33.700, Speaker A: So this is a great question. Think that you need to define this in your smart context because we are checking the smart context. Okay, let's come back here. I was in the hashist new upkeep. So this is the address of my upkeep. The admin, it's me. Okay, the gas limit.
00:20:33.700 - 00:21:11.750, Speaker A: I have some information here defined. You need this, okay, check this counter or your name, the address, the adiming address. We need this. The guest limit is this. In some moment you can check the documentation to understand why I may use this. Okay. And I don't need any data, extra data, but the starting balance, I'd like to start with 20.
00:21:11.750 - 00:21:42.370, Speaker A: Okay. This will be spent every time my job is running. Okay, so has you set up kit. This is a new transaction on the blockchain. Yes, we have it. Wait, you can check the transaction if you like it. Okay.
00:21:42.370 - 00:22:09.156, Speaker A: And let me check just now what will happen with my smart content. Mine is the second. Okay, the counter didn't change yet. This is the same. This is the same. We need to wait like 15 minutes because it's not confirmed yet. Oh yes, it's confirmed.
00:22:09.156 - 00:22:36.690, Speaker A: Yes, maybe now here close. I can come back to Rome. My upkeeps, this is the counter four. It didn't perform any upkeep just now. But this is here now. Oh here perform upkeep. So I'm sure that now my counter is not zero.
00:22:36.690 - 00:23:10.300, Speaker A: Let me check it. Yes, my counter is one just now and I did nothing. The keeper, the job did the work for me. So this is amazing. Because we can finally have a way, a decentralized and a trust way that our smart contract can be updated by nodes. By a decentralized network of nodes. And I think it's this.
00:23:10.300 - 00:23:52.330, Speaker A: Let me check another. Remember that probably this will not working, but I can check one of you register it. Yes. If you put your name here, I can check some of you like. Are you check the mateo if he did something. Example. Are you like this? Yes, Mateo, it's working because the counter is one just now.
00:23:52.330 - 00:24:13.250, Speaker A: Congrats, Mateo. You are so fast. And let me check. Sam, are you okay? Sam? Let me check it. Wow, your content is true now. Great. You are great.
00:24:13.250 - 00:24:53.244, Speaker A: So I think. Let me put some information for you. It's working. We know that it's working. So what's important just now for you? This is the researches, the resources you can check. I didn't know the open zeppelin defender so much to do a comparison. Okay, so I cannot ask your question.
00:24:53.244 - 00:25:13.830, Speaker A: Sorry for this now. Yes, I checked the sum. So this is the documentation. It's very important for you. Probably I put something. I need to add something here. Here.
00:25:13.830 - 00:25:38.524, Speaker A: Okay, let me update the documentation here. We need great response. Thank you. I learned a few just now. And this is my tutorial in the GitHub to help you. It's exactly what I did here. And two points, very important.
00:25:38.524 - 00:26:18.792, Speaker A: You have all of this to help you, okay? You add this to get help. And please, I'd like to give your feedback. I'd like to know if you like it or know what I can do better. And I need to tell you that this is my first workshop with Chainlink. I work like a developer advocate for some years, more than two years. And I started on Chainlink. Now I'm very happy and I hope that it can help you.
00:26:18.792 - 00:27:00.470, Speaker A: And if you have some question, let us know or talk with us on the discord and wherever. And I think it's this. Do you have any question? Oh, thank you. I think you like the pad. I really love this. I started using this in my first workshop. And I know that it's like we can feel that we are together, we can be in any part of the world, but we are together here.
00:27:00.470 - 00:27:37.660, Speaker A: So with this, guys, please remember that we need your feedback. Let me add this link for you too. Hi. And this is I'm me stopping sharing my screen and see you around, guys. I'm so happy to be here with you. Bye.
