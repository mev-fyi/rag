00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.262, Speaker A: Yeah, we are good.
00:00:01.396 - 00:00:02.080, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:03.970 - 00:00:39.980, Speaker C: Thanks a lot everyone for joining us today. Really want to thank the Kyber network community as well as well as the Chainlink community and just the greater blockchain community for joining us today from all around the world. Really excited to have Sonny Jane, the head of product at Kyber Network, as well as Shane Hong, the marketing director at Kyber work joining us today. So a little bit about the rundown, how this is going to go. We got a list of preset questions that we're going to go about and asking. If you have questions, feel free to drop them into the chat. We'll try our best to get to them.
00:00:39.980 - 00:01:00.030, Speaker C: If we don't get to them, feel free to drop them into both of our telegrams and we'll do our best to get to them there. So without further ado, Shane and Sonny, do you want to maybe give a quick intro about yourselves, a little bit about your background and what you guys are working on at Kyber Network?
00:01:01.170 - 00:01:22.870, Speaker B: Okay, sure. Maybe I will start first. So first of all, thanks Keenan, for inviting us. So this is my first video ama. I've been mostly either on the live physical events or via the Telegram chat. So very excited about it. So I'm right now head of product at Kyber Network prior to this.
00:01:22.870 - 00:02:00.318, Speaker B: So most of my experience has been around product management and UI UX optimization and that's exactly what I do at Kyber network. Prior to Kyber Network, I was working with Apple and Lazada. So those people who are not aware Lazada is like Amazon of Southeast Asia. It was eventually acquired by Alibaba. So there I was working with Alipay to push their payments across Southeast Asia. So my experience has been out and out in fintech and product management, developing and launching products. Right now at Kyber Network we have a product called Kyberswap.
00:02:00.318 - 00:02:23.500, Speaker B: It's a decentralized exchange that is using Kyber network as a backend. So it's one of the most used decentralized chain in the world. So I'm heading the product there. So we have a big team based in Vietnam and I've been working on this since I joined Kyber network. I've been with Kyber Network for the last two years.
00:02:24.110 - 00:02:44.546, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for sharing. I was telling Shane earlier, I think Kyberswap is one of the first DeFi products you can say that I ever used. And I just love your UX and user experience and user interface and it's just so easy to use. So definitely big props to you and everything that you're working on, I hope.
00:02:44.568 - 00:03:06.360, Speaker B: You are still using it. Just to our viewers, if you are looking for a place to, let's say to put link token on your portfolio, Kyberswap is one of the best place to get the rates. One of the best rate. It is one of the top ready token on Kyberswap. Mainly on the buy side. People buy it lot.
00:03:07.770 - 00:03:15.274, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, we'll drop these links in after the video is finished. Shane, do you want to maybe introduce yourself a bit and what you're working on?
00:03:15.312 - 00:03:38.722, Speaker A: Yeah, just do a quick introduction. First of all, thank you again for inviting us here. So I'm Shane. I help with the marketing side of things at Kyber. So we are startup. All of us have to wear actually many hats at our office. And apart from marketing, I'm also helping with the communications and the community side of things.
00:03:38.722 - 00:04:41.622, Speaker A: So we have about close to 200,000 in total community members and developers working with Kyber in all different channels. And a lot of what I do is helping to manage the community, engaging with them and helping to kind of educate them about what's going on with Kyber. What are the new updates, what they should discuss with regards to our new governance proposals? So previously, before I joined Kyber, I was also working in marketing, but in a totally different industry. I was in a german company called Villarreal and Bok. And it's like a really old school company, right? It's a 270 plus year history. So it's very different from how it's like at a startup. But that experience has been very interesting in trying to kind of marry traditional, typical marketing techniques with how it's like in the crypto space.
00:04:41.622 - 00:05:09.630, Speaker A: Right, where there are a lot of memes, there are a lot of viral gifs and content that, yeah, it was something new for me when I joined Kyber, but I've gotten used to it, I think for the chainling community and Kyber community both know this kind of content. So I've been enjoying myself working in the crypto space and I work very closely with sunny on both Kyberswap and Kyber network.
00:05:10.130 - 00:05:35.000, Speaker C: Well, yeah, thanks for sharing. Yeah, I know taking startup experience from iPass has definitely helped with just everything in crypto. Man, it moves so fast. It's crazy cool. So yeah, maybe, Sonny, if you want to maybe just explain a little bit about how Kyberswap works and then maybe how you're utilizing Chainlink decentralized oracles into your platform.
00:05:35.930 - 00:05:58.362, Speaker B: Sure. So basically kyberswap available@kyberswap.com. We also have mobile apps available, Android and iOS, both official. So it's pretty simple. I would say there are like three steps that I normally say that you connect your wallet, choose your tokens and you click swap. That's it. Right? So there is nothing else required.
00:05:58.362 - 00:06:27.480, Speaker B: And we don't have any such limitation on how much you can trade as much as you want. We are decentralized. So there's no deposit, no withdrawal. There is no even, I would say like no KYC requirement as well. So you're totally free. One of the key. And if I want to talk about Kyberswap, right, so we have processed over half a billion worth of trading volume in this year.
00:06:27.480 - 00:06:51.246, Speaker B: On an average, we transact one swap per minute. And that's pretty high compared to, if you look at the crypto average. So that's how big we have become. The scale is very high. One of the things that then people swap, right. We show to the user the slippage. Those people who are familiar with decks would understand what slippage is.
00:06:51.246 - 00:07:22.618, Speaker B: For those who do not understand, let me explain. Slippage is basically if you are doing a swap, let's say 200 e, two link, because your size of the trade is so big, the average price you will get probably will not be the same as what we show to you. So there would be some slippage because of the trade size. So the impact on the price because of trade size. So if we show you like 200 e to link, the slippage would be 0.1%. That's very minimal. So user will go through.
00:07:22.618 - 00:08:06.886, Speaker B: But if we show you that if you do 200 e tooling and the slippage would be 10%, that's a very detriment factor to the user. And we think that we need to show it to the user, we can never be 100% accurate, but we try to be as accurate as possible. So as you can see, showing high slippage can actually be a detriment to the conversion of the user when he is swapping. We have seen, right, if we show high slippage, we were seeing customer drop off. They were not choosing to proceed with the swap. And one of the key thing, right, when we show slippage, what's the reference price we take? Right. So if we show you your net average price after the swap would be 100, but it's 100 is less than 10% of the average price.
00:08:06.886 - 00:08:50.710, Speaker B: So what should be the average price? So that reference price, that reference data was the critical for us. So when we were looking at different options, we wanted something like very reliable, very easy to integrate with and something that doesn't require so many resources. So we look at, actually it took almost a month to evaluate different situations. So we look at first like off chain data. So even though it is possible. Right, so we wanted, let's say we take the price feed from different exchanges, both centralized and decentralized, average the price and use that as a reference price to show the slippage. But even though this were technically possible, it has two or three issues.
00:08:50.710 - 00:09:23.642, Speaker B: One of them, it was resource heavy, technically very challenging to bring off chain data to onchain. And even if we do that, we still need some resources to take care of it. And because everything did depend on this one, the second we look at on chain, right, we were looking at if we can find a service that can give us that reference data. So it solves our problem. So we look at several options. Of course, Chainlink was our obvious choice because it's big, it's reliable. And to be honest, even though we took almost a month to decide on that, it took us almost like one or two days to integrate with Chainlink.
00:09:23.642 - 00:09:46.134, Speaker B: It was super simple. It has been working extremely, extremely reliable on that one. And the third is it has zero cost of maintenance. We just integrate once and we have completely forgotten about it. And even when I look at the impact on our business, I see the customer conversion has improved by almost 10%.
00:09:46.252 - 00:09:46.966, Speaker C: Wow.
00:09:47.148 - 00:10:07.982, Speaker B: That's the impact. So we use, at least on Kyber swap, we use chain link for a reference data and that we use that. And because it's so reliable and Kyber is known to give the best rate, so slippage is always very less. And the users are happy. We are happy. Zero cost. I think it's a win win situation.
00:10:07.982 - 00:10:10.266, Speaker B: We are very happy to use chainlink.
00:10:10.458 - 00:10:34.920, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, that's very interesting. And I know there's been a lot of questions about, you make this decision and there's a lot of technical debt that goes into either building your own or thinking about integrating something like Chainlink. And then how long does that integration actually take itself? And people don't realize it's like a little bit of work, but it's easy to get done and able to get started.
00:10:36.250 - 00:11:24.198, Speaker A: Before we jump deeper into Kyberswap, I just wanted to expound a little bit about Kyber network as well. So Kyber is actually an on chain liquidity protocol, which aggregates different liquidity sources in order to provide the best available rates among those sources. And this protocol is permissionless, meaning any other Dapps that need, like liquidity. They need token swaps within their platform. They can integrate Kyber for their needs. And Kyber swap is just one out of hundred over different dapps that are actually using Kyber at the moment. We don't have specific research on this, but we believe we are the most integrated DeFi protocol at the moment.
00:11:24.198 - 00:11:54.862, Speaker A: Last year, binance actually did a research on the most used protocols in Defi and Kybers actually came up top. And we hope to also educate more developers and depths in the space about what Kyber can offer for them in terms of their liquidity needs. So, yeah, sorry to cut in, Sonny just wanted to highlight the difference between Kyber network and Kyberswap because people tend to confuse 100%.
00:11:54.916 - 00:12:07.800, Speaker C: No, I think that brings up a really good point. And what are some of your favorite either hackathon projects that you've seen people built within Kyber network or just other integrations that have utilized Kyber network itself?
00:12:08.490 - 00:12:57.560, Speaker A: A very famous one in the space, actually two very famous ones recently are Paraswarp and one inch. Last year we did a hackathon, Defi Hackathon, and the winner, which was called Defi Zep, then now called Zepify, they were the champions for hackathon and they went on to get a grant from Metacartel as well. And now they are one of the very popular Dapps that are actually composing different Defi protocols together to make it easier for users. I think another DAP that won one of our bounties in our hackathon is called gelato finance. They were also a grantee from Metacartel. So I think Sunny has some examples like no and Instadap from India. Sunny, you want to.
00:12:58.570 - 00:13:39.460, Speaker B: I mean, we have two very famous success stories from India. So if you have today your viewers from India. So inside app was, I think they were the winner of the first ETH India hackathon, and they built a decentralized exchange using Kyban network at the back end, very much like Kyberswap. And then they eventually go on from there to build up Instadap. They use Kyban network specifically for liquidation. And I think a lot of big swaps from ETH to stable coins. They got funding from Coinbase and several other big vcs from us.
00:13:39.460 - 00:14:02.390, Speaker B: They got 2 million funding. And instadap, everybody knows about it. It's pretty hit. Now then, the second one is nuo network. They started as a margin trading platform. They also were using Kyber specifically for liquidation purpose. The reason is that Kyber can handle very big trades seamlessly from a decentralized exchange perspective.
00:14:02.390 - 00:14:31.186, Speaker B: So I can tell you in last to last month, the biggest trade that we handled was 1200 e in a single transaction and with like asleep is less than 1%. So that was one of the big thing that we did. So no network was using us. So no got funding from Sequoia to build a digibank specifically for us market. I think it's still in progress. So these are the two successful stories. Later on.
00:14:31.186 - 00:14:54.774, Speaker B: If you have developers who are looking to how to build with Kyvan network, I can guide them. We have a very systematic process in which we can guide them. If they're new to blockchain, we can tell them how to start getting into blockchain and ethereum and eventually go to the smart context is these are some of the success stories that we have with Kyber.
00:14:54.822 - 00:15:32.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a couple I want to add. Actually more than a couple. There are a lot of good examples actually, but I just wanted to highlight a few. So most people in crypto, they need like a wallet, crypto wallet to kind of store their funds or to trade. And some of the most popular crypto wallets out there like trust engine, argand.edu, pillar, they all have integrated Kyber natively. Recently there's an app called Digifox which was created by one of the biggest crypto youtubers called Data Dash, Nicholas Murdon.
00:15:32.514 - 00:16:22.760, Speaker A: So he has actually interviewed and reviewed countless of different blockchain projects and he decided to go with Kyber to integrate Kyber for his DaP, which is called Digifox, that he launched recently. So yeah, we are on it, right? There are so many different Defi dapps in the space that are using Kyber and I think this is testament to the fact that our protocol is really, truly permissionless. It's really easy to integrate. Developers that have integrated us have always commented that the documentation is very easy to follow and our developers are ready to help them as well. So yeah, it's nice to see us being right in the heart of Defi and being understood by a lot of these dev.
00:16:24.010 - 00:17:04.578, Speaker C: I mean, that's no joke. Those are all becoming very big household names between one inch paraswap, instadap, all these are climbing and it really shows you right at the core of all these. And it's great getting excited about the developer community around this and we'll drop the links to their discord so everyone can join as well after this conversation. But it's fun to sit there and kind of speculate on things. But none of this would be possible without the developers that are building this. Sonny, if someone's just getting into, maybe they're a web developer in the past, where do you recommend them kind of start if they're looking to just kind.
00:17:04.584 - 00:17:55.902, Speaker B: Of become a mean. I get this question almost in every event. So this is a perfect example. So let's say when I started, right, I was coming from a very payments and fintech background, but I did not have a blockchain experience, right, when I entered into Kyber two years ago. So I would say that don't jump straight into the smart contract. I would say you get into the school, then graduate, then you go for super high postgraduate level, right? So this is what I tell to everyone, right? You start with, let's say our API, right? These are the rest APIs. If you are a web developer, you are super familiar with this, right? So you can actually build an exchange or any application that require token exchange using Kyber APIs.
00:17:55.902 - 00:18:25.726, Speaker B: You do not need to write any smart contract. In fact you don't have to do anything with the blockchain. You actually total cut your off from the Ethereum blockchain, but you're still building an application for the blockchain. So that I would say is the starting point. And we have engine wallet, right? It has in ticket with Kyber network and they have been using only API, they've been using it. It works super successful, scalable. So it's not like a small thing.
00:18:25.726 - 00:19:28.050, Speaker B: You can build super successful, highly scalable application using our APIs. The second once, let's say you're comfortable with API and you want to go a level further, right? You can start use our any standard Javascript library and try to integrate. So what API does is that behind the scenes, use a JavaScript library to call a method directly on a blockchain or a smart contract. So you can bypass that API and you can start doing it by yourself. So even when you're using a JavaScript library, you're still not writing a smart contract, but you have gone a level further. You have built your better understanding of how the Ethereum blockchain work, how the function calling works, the mass around ways and ethereum, it can be really overwhelming at start, right? Whatever you have built using API, you can build the same thing using JavaScript libraries. But it's going to be like you have better understanding and probably you can add much more functionality that currently API is not offering.
00:19:28.050 - 00:20:17.346, Speaker B: So let's say you do that and you're super comfortable with that. Now I think you would be ready because you have solid understanding of how the transaction on a blockchain works, how everything works, where you would stuck up and all this thing. So then you can go and start writing smart contract that I would think like the highest line, that's the top of it. And then you can do whatever you want to do. But as far as I've seen, most of the things you can actually get done by APIs or a smart contract. And I think this is the same way you can also interact with Chainlink, right? If you want data from them you can probably using API or you can just use the JavaScript library. You don't have to write smart contract to use chain link, you can actually do it without that also.
00:20:17.346 - 00:20:37.634, Speaker B: So I think it has really helped to some people that I have told. I mean this is how I started and once you get familiar with it, then you start going to that cool. Writing smart contract at the very first can be very overwhelming and challenging to some people. I mean it was to so what.
00:20:37.692 - 00:20:48.460, Speaker C: What product developments and you mentioned a few just previously, are you most excited about in know that are both using Kyberswap and Chainlink themselves?
00:20:50.350 - 00:21:51.710, Speaker A: Yeah. Wait, before I go to that question, I'd like to add on to what Sunny said earlier. So even for non developers going to even high level, right, not even to the smart contract or to the coding level. If you are just a web developer or you just own a website and you want to be able to allow your users to swap tokens on your website or accept token payments for anything you're trying to sell, we have something called a Kyber widget. So you can just go to Kyber network, you can see a link there at the top. So with the Kyber widget we have a widget generator where you just key in certain parameters like which tokens you want to support, what token pair you want to accept for payments for whatever goods or services you're selling and you just press a button and they generate a HTML source code for you which you can just copy and paste onto your site. And right there, there's a button where you can actually just click on your site.
00:21:51.710 - 00:22:42.494, Speaker A: And people can trade tokens, they can pay using different ERC 20 tokens for whatever you're selling. So this can be done actually within a few minutes. Like some of the popular gaming sites, for example Boolean X where they have nfts which are backed by real gold made by I think Jesse and Dan. They use the Kyber widget recently. SnX link project created by I think Amiliano and Simone where they actually make it easier for you to actually claim your SNx rewards. They are also using the Kyber widget on their site. So they have told me that they really took a really fast time to actually integrate that.
00:22:42.494 - 00:23:06.840, Speaker A: But I mean they are developers but as I explained earlier, it's just a matter of keying in the parameters, generating the HTML code and just inputting it onto your website. That's it. And you can accept token payments. So this is one of the ways where we try to make it easier even for developers to get a sense of how Kyber works and really see it come into effect just within a few minutes.
00:23:08.650 - 00:23:24.270, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think you mentioned one there too with like Bolenex and NFTs and they're using Chainlink, VRF. Sonny, what are you most excited about in Defi features that are being used that are utilizing Chainlink and Kyber.
00:23:27.650 - 00:24:03.194, Speaker B: So some of my favorite projects, like one of them is Synthetix. They use mean. I give you a very practical example, right. So I am based in Singapore. So even though for me it's really easy to go and trade in us market, but the trading fees and all the hassle of different working hours and everything is such pain, right? So what synthetic says is that what they plan to have is synthetic assets. I want to trade like apple stocks on hana blockchain, right. And that really excites me.
00:24:03.194 - 00:24:45.094, Speaker B: I think that's a really amazing use case and that is in a way is the very best use case of chain link. Now you want to do something on chain, on a blockchain and you need data from off chain word, right. I think the whole synthetics, right. Apple is just an example, right. There are like more than 5000 symbols available on Nasdaq, right? And then you talk about, let's say India, right, another 7000, Singapore exchange another 4000. It's an ocean, right. Synthetics alone, I think that would be very challenging for them to go and integrate, as I said.
00:24:45.094 - 00:25:37.994, Speaker B: Right, they can do it, but why take such a pin when there is a simpler, much more reliable route available for you, right? So I think that's one of the things that really excites me and I closely follow synthetics in that way and I've been following them from day. I mean I can tell you, right, there was a time when synthetics actually I attended their launch party in Sydney last year, also in April, May. So there was a time when I could look at synthetics and I look at the BTC price there and I can see there is an arbitrage from the real price because they were not updating it that fast. And I think a lot of people took advantage of that also. But now when I see after they integrate with Chainlink, it's as live as it can be. Right? So it's pretty, that's. I think it, to me, the concept is nice.
00:25:37.994 - 00:25:47.980, Speaker B: A very good use case for Chainlink also. And a lot of freedom to people. Also, right now, anyone from the world can trade in any market.
00:25:49.070 - 00:26:10.260, Speaker C: Yeah, it's groundbreaking and it's really exciting. So we have a few minutes left, and I really wanted to get to this. So you launched Catalyst, which is the Kyber network Dao. I want to get into what really excites you about dows, and then maybe if you can explain a little bit about what Catalyst is and what the Kyber DaO is.
00:26:10.950 - 00:26:49.818, Speaker A: Sure. So catalyst is what we call our recent protocol upgrade. It was just a play on the word catalyst, changing the c to k just to fit the Kyber theme. And what this protocol entailed was we are now allowing depths to actually set their own business model. So previously, they only could get a fixed fee if they integrated Kyber. And this fee comes from part of the fees paid by the liquidity providers. But right now, they are able to set their own customized fee up to them on top of the integration.
00:26:49.818 - 00:27:23.130, Speaker A: And this gives them a lot of flexibility because debts, they need to be sustainable. Right. They need to run a business of their own. If they choose to, they can charge no fees, but there are certain debts which want to. And we want just to give everyone this option. So this is one of the major things that came with Catalyst. Another thing is, previously, our reserves, our liquidity providers on Kyber, they actually need to hold KNC as part of the fees that they have to pay every time a trade occurs through their reserve.
00:27:23.130 - 00:28:33.038, Speaker A: What we did with Catalyst was to just remove this entirely. So reserves when they want to provide liquidity on Kai, but they no longer actually need to hold any KNC, which removes a very major friction point for them. Apart from that, we also launched Kyber Dao, which is a decentralized governance platform. And all KNC holders now have the opportunity to actually stick their tokens on the DAO, and they're eligible to actually vote on certain proposals, on certain decisions that will affect kind of the direction, the development of the entire protocol. So this kind of like empowers every KNC holder to actually have an actual stake on Kyber, to actually have incentive to make sure Kyber does well. And in return for their efforts, in return for participating governance, KNC holders actually can get rewards in ETH in return. So recently we just concluded our first voting phase, what we call an epoch.
00:28:33.038 - 00:29:45.702, Speaker A: So epoch one, and we had our first proposal that went live as well. We had about 2580 voters and 57 million KNC staked so far, which is about 80 85 million USD on the blockchain. Smart contract staking smart contract. So I think at least within the Ethereum D five space so far, this is either one of the largest or even the largest participation rate that we have seen in the space. And yeah, it's really heartening to see that because a lot of the months of hard work that the whole team put in since last year, November, when we first announced catalyst finally come to fruition and we are seeing that on chain governance is actually doable. Voter participation, incentivizing increase in voter participation is something that a lot of Dow projects, a lot of people that are working on Dows, they're trying to solve and address. And Kyber, at least in our unique example for our community, we have shown that this is possible.
00:29:45.702 - 00:30:17.890, Speaker A: 2000 over, people have actually spent gas to vote on a proposal and to decide on the direction of how Kyber is going to go. So yeah, the Kyber Dao and catalyst came together. It was launched at the same time. But in general, these are the kind of the benefits that we have introduced to enhance the liquidity that we are able to provide to all the hundred over depths that are using Kyber.
00:30:18.390 - 00:30:19.234, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:30:19.432 - 00:30:51.230, Speaker B: Just to add on, right? So even in Kyber Dow, we are using chain link. So all the prices that Shane said, right, 57 million GNC is $87 million. So all the price conversion, all the reference prices we are taking from Chainlink, of course that has helped us to save weeks of work because we took our experience from Kyberswap. It took us like few days just to do all the mean. Just to let you know, even for Kyberswap and Kawadao, we are using Chainlink as our exclusive pricing source.
00:30:51.650 - 00:31:27.154, Speaker A: One more thing as well. So as part of the DAO proposals, when there are trading fees that are collected, part of it are actually burned. So the fees are collected in ETH. So these ETH would be used to purchase KNC and the KNC will be burned. So this is just one of the tokens utility, there's a deflationary element to it. So during this BurnIng process, we actually use chain link for this token pair price fee like SuNny mentioned. So yeah, forgot to add it earlier.
00:31:27.282 - 00:31:50.480, Speaker C: Yeah, THat's really exciting and super impressive about many people voting. I think that's like a big challenge with a lot of people that are creating dows and decentralized governance models. It's like, all right, how do I get people to actually vote on these things? People are maybe a little more speculative. Do you have one piece of advice for anyone that's starting a Dow, how to get this kind of involvement that you guys have seen this success?
00:31:51.490 - 00:33:13.210, Speaker A: I would say you have to kind of reconcile both the off chain and on chain elements of running a Dow, running a community in general. So on chain is great because of the benefits of the blockchain, right? Transparency, decentralization, censorship, resistance. So that's great. But on chain votes in and itself in the Dow is meaningless. If before that, prior to that, or even during the process, post voting process, there is debates, discussions going on around the proposals that are being made. So the kind of so called rough consensus that is derived from all these discussions, from all the engagement with the community, from the back and forth debates on Reddit, on the forums, all these play a part as well to kind of inform the final voting decision from each of these mean this is just very generic advice for anyone. Starting a Dow community is the key to a decentralized, autonomous organization.
00:33:13.210 - 00:33:35.380, Speaker A: The blockchain part and makes certain things much more efficient or much more transparent. But the heart of the dow is still the community, still the humans behind the machine. So, yeah, that's just one piece of advice that I can share based on our own experience.
00:33:36.390 - 00:34:09.866, Speaker B: I can give some points from the product perspective because I was guiding the product kyber.org, at which our Kyber Dao is available. So in my opinion, I've used several Dao before. They're very complicated to design from a product perspective, just to give you an example. Right. So as Shane talked about that, our voting period is considered, it's called as epoch. So if you stake KNC in epoch one, which is, let's say two weeks, then you can vote in epoch two, but you will get your reward in epoch three.
00:34:09.866 - 00:34:40.710, Speaker B: So there is a sequence now, you can deposit in epoch one, withdraw, then deposit more into, then withdraw. You can do as many things as you want. So this is one thing that we saw that we actually, before we start getting into the product, we map all the user journey. This is what the user want to do, what not to do, this and that. And this can be really confusing. So there are two things that we focus a lot when we were designing Kyber.org is I call it call to action.
00:34:40.710 - 00:35:15.110, Speaker B: So on every page we try to give only one button that you can click. So call to action is only one. So even if you are lost or you don't know, right, you know there is only one place to click, so you will click there. And then we use a very refined messaging to guide you. So this is the first step. You are staking, right when you stake, okay, now you have staked but you will be able to vote in the next epoch and you must vote to get your reward. So when you are voting right, then we say okay, now you have voted successfully, then you wait for the next epoch to claim your reward.
00:35:15.110 - 00:35:49.420, Speaker B: When you're claiming your reward, now you're claiming your reward. This much eth you will get. So these kind of messaging, we have focused a lot and no way we are perfect, we are still improving, but so far we have not seen any question. I have not seen any question when people are saying I don't know how to stake or I don't know how to vote, I don't know how to claim. So at least from like three basic operations on Dow, right, staking, voting and claiming your reward have been super smooth. No questions. To me, it's a big win.
00:35:50.110 - 00:36:16.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I think your design choices and user experience of just how you just go about creating all your products speak volumes for the amount of success that you have and excited to see it continue. So I think that wraps up our q a today. Sonny and Shane, I really want to thank you for joining us. I know it's getting late where you are and very grateful for your time. Is there any one last thing that we might have missed that you want to.
00:36:19.910 - 00:36:39.180, Speaker B: I mean I'm okay. I mean you have asked a really interesting question. I was super excited and do share me with the wallpaper that you have behind you. I would like to download it. Yeah, and this was my first video ama, I really enjoyed it and really nice questions that you have asked.
00:36:40.210 - 00:37:17.814, Speaker A: Yeah, same here. I really enjoyed this virtual fireside chat and glad to be able to share more about how Kyber is using Chainlink and Kyberswap and Kyber Dao and hope that there will be more updates about how we can work together in the mean. The training community knows Rory very well. I've spoken to Rory a couple of times on other avenues of collaboration and look forward to more of these updates in the future. And once again, thank you for having.
00:37:17.852 - 00:37:48.880, Speaker C: Us today Kenan yeah, thanks a lot.
