00:00:04.960 - 00:00:05.652, Speaker A: All right, awesome.
00:00:05.706 - 00:00:21.108, Speaker B: So I think we have everyone. So we're going to have another operator panel and people are going to explain us further background and how it has been like their experience operating chainlink nodes and how they see the future of the ecosystem going forward.
00:00:21.194 - 00:00:21.636, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:21.738 - 00:00:40.990, Speaker B: So we are lucky to have ETH events. We are lucky to have linkful Lakefish and 30. So it's probably going to be a very exciting panel and yeah, let's get started. So I think the first thing for this panel would be really for you guys to introduce yourselves, what you guys are doing and really tell us the history for your company.
00:00:43.280 - 00:01:28.700, Speaker D: I'm Henrik, I'm the founder of Sertisone. We are a validator company and we also provide security software for validator and oracle operators. And we just recently got into Chainlink and we actually started in the middle of last year, actually with the start of the Cosmos testnet. This is how we got into the whole validation space before. I've been doing security research and software development and my co founder CTO, has been doing security research and infrastructure development. So he's got really lot of insight into low level engineering of infrastructure and we try to apply that to build very secure validation and oracle infrastructure.
00:01:31.060 - 00:02:35.440, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Chris, I'm responsible for the infrastructure of steakfish. We started with Cosmos, we are validating blockchain. We started with Cosmos, then Eelson, Irisnet, Tezos. So on our company on proof of stake, we were interested in Chainlink operating in Oracle because we think that for sure is the future to solve the Oracle problem. I came from, let's say it, I work in it since now it's pretty much been a year. I was working with my past company in Switzerland in the cybersecurity and data protection. And I joined the steakfish in November.
00:02:35.440 - 00:02:48.680, Speaker C: And yeah, I'm here to bring, let's say, all the best practices for the enterprise cybersecurity to secure validator Oracle.
00:02:51.660 - 00:03:43.192, Speaker A: I'm joining from Winpole. Winpole is a company presentation Prime Mel as a chairman staking organization the first trustworth. In terms of my background, I come from a long background of operations software development like DevOps, gone from a mixture of role of purely software development to operations engineers and to engineers based roles. Very excited about Chainlink also Chainlink Engineering is a vital one for the blockchain like two minutes ago.
00:03:43.246 - 00:04:27.940, Speaker E: But I'm still Peter, founder and CEO of any blog. We are a team of four located in Michael, Germany. We are about the same veterans as you are, about 20 something years in it, 90 something we started. There's lots of banks in Frankfurt, so we have lots of projects in the bank with my co founder started working 1012 years ago in another company that's actually a home net. We are data service provider operator and we are very interested in blockchain technology. I think there will be many chains and they could be linked somehow. They need the access somehow.
00:04:27.940 - 00:04:31.610, Speaker E: Quite a good idea so far.
00:04:32.060 - 00:04:33.530, Speaker A: We just started.
00:04:38.540 - 00:05:16.490, Speaker B: It's really great to have all these different backgrounds. So for instance, Shui is on Cosmos and multiple proof of tech networks. Linkpool has really been focused since the beginning and you guys also come from a very different background, so we already have a large diversity and this kind of discussion. So I guess a question I would like to ask is maybe how do you see the node operator growing in the node operator ecosystem growing in the future? How do you see competition between different node operators shaping up? Basically your insights on what you predict the ecosystem will look like in the future?
00:05:19.660 - 00:05:25.064, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we'll see tremendous growth because I think what Chainlink provides us.
00:05:25.102 - 00:05:26.164, Speaker B: Is something really unique.
00:05:26.212 - 00:05:40.924, Speaker D: And this is one of the first times that we can actually have almost trustless data. Oracle as a data provider on chain and I see the tremendous growth potential for all of Defi products based on it.
00:05:41.042 - 00:05:41.936, Speaker A: We're going to talk a little bit.
00:05:41.958 - 00:06:09.880, Speaker D: More about that later, but I see that especially because currently we're just providing a little bit of data on ETH pricing. That's what we primarily do. We've been added to the aggregator contract, so we all contribute to this one price finding mechanism on the blockchain. But as we've seen, chaining has been moving great partnerships and I see us providing much more interesting data in the future. And for data there's no limits. So are there no other spots?
00:06:12.620 - 00:07:10.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that probably competition will exist all the other blockchain, and I think that the most aspect that probably all the chain operators we will try to push the effort will be to build secure things for sure, because we are talking about the oracle problem. That is a key factor to bring data in and out from blockchain for sure. Also there will be to building tools for people. I guess the most will be around building a lot of tools, useful tools and reliable for sure to help the channel leak to be more secure and trusted people.
00:07:15.100 - 00:07:43.750, Speaker A: Your question is an interesting one. I think in the future, especially when there's a lot more protocol developments with Chainlink, especially with threshold signatures and removing the linear increase in gas costs requested, and the development of tools like our marketplace for example, reputation services as well. So reputation services online.
00:07:45.960 - 00:07:46.852, Speaker B: Very interesting.
00:07:46.986 - 00:08:00.616, Speaker A: Especially like I think in the future we're one of the future. When more and more people get involved.
00:08:00.648 - 00:08:01.230, Speaker E: In.
00:08:03.040 - 00:08:09.840, Speaker A: Many, many output potentially in the future on there like being listed, you're going to get multiple.
00:08:15.700 - 00:08:19.360, Speaker E: Network to the people, millions.
00:08:22.200 - 00:09:17.460, Speaker A: The concept of paying for decentralization, paying for recognition, for example, if you're going into large organizations, you might not want a smaller amount than handling of KYC. Very high reputable contract, specialized. I think the concept of churning being a free market in the future, in the world, the providers themselves price random selection of the oracle. It's going to trigger a lot of competition.
00:09:20.760 - 00:09:27.892, Speaker E: I agree with you what you said about trust and staking. Definitely there will be growth.
00:09:27.956 - 00:09:29.336, Speaker B: I wonder how fast.
00:09:29.518 - 00:09:32.536, Speaker F: I think that depending on blockchain in.
00:09:32.558 - 00:10:23.588, Speaker E: General, we have overestimated the growth in the last half year. I think it'll go on for a while, say another half year at least. Not very steep, but I think it will grow, definitely. And it might accelerate. Actually pretty sure it will accelerate, but it will also diversify. For the question where are we use the data? Interesting. And where's the prime data in the premium space or high usage differentiate in the spectrum.
00:10:23.588 - 00:10:36.060, Speaker E: But I think we are small community. So I wonder how it will look like in five years or ten years. Awesome.
00:10:36.130 - 00:10:51.440, Speaker B: So you asked the question I wanted to ask actually, and enrich actually referred to the p five use cases. So I guess my next question will really be what kind of data and what kind of use cases are you the most excited to allow on chain?
00:10:53.800 - 00:11:46.100, Speaker D: I actually already mentioned it. I'm a huge bull on DeFi, and contracts and general implementations are a product in that space. For example, providing data about flights, about weather, and helping people build prediction markets and helping these oracles provide data. And you can build very exciting things on top of these that will allow much more complex financial products than the traditional finance market would allow. And data is required to in the end by the results of, for example a bank or any kind. So I think this is going to be one of the use cases which I personally think is most exciting. And we see a lot of data already coming in, working with the honeycomb market where a lot of APIs are now being added, and we'll provide that data.
00:11:46.100 - 00:11:49.990, Speaker D: So I'm really excited that we will already start to provide that as of now.
00:11:51.640 - 00:12:46.790, Speaker C: Yeah, I have the same opinion. Defi is the key. And if you think that, for example, Defi is starting to mimic traditional finance, I think that at some point we will need all these data points. That is part of normal life, for example. But we can also think about also building on top of wage things, all these kind of things. It's crazy to think there is a lot of things to import and why not? Also, I was just thinking now and building some data exchanging about betting. It's a huge mark.
00:12:51.800 - 00:13:35.960, Speaker A: I think a lot of people, when they talk about bitcoin and money, they often say like bank. I think like we've, we've talked about DeFi before, even insurance products. And I think one of the massive benefits of this is that suddenly you're going to have a lot of traditional and typical products available to people who've not traditionally had them available. For example, like farmers who are in third world countries, who suddenly have the ability to be able to purchase decentralized agricultural insurance, for example. Just being able to develop and offer products genuinely help communities in places not had the ability to be able to.
00:13:36.110 - 00:13:38.410, Speaker C: Reach or take out those products before.
00:13:39.660 - 00:13:51.004, Speaker A: Even the case of logistics. We was just talking about it a little bit ago before the panel. Being able to track and incorporate more.
00:13:51.042 - 00:13:52.270, Speaker E: IoT data.
00:13:54.640 - 00:14:22.340, Speaker A: Which is done on chain and data delivery should be done by settled by smart contracts. I think even we could sit on this panel now and talk about use cases. But then in two, three years time, I think we're going to be very surprised. I think it's always going to be the same time because the use cases, when you get external data on the contract is pretty much length.
00:14:24.940 - 00:14:25.704, Speaker F: I agree.
00:14:25.822 - 00:14:34.920, Speaker E: But also I think there will be much more enterprise data. So we are thinking about data, more specific data from private chains, from chains.
00:14:35.340 - 00:14:37.928, Speaker F: Our engagement with the Energy web foundation.
00:14:38.104 - 00:14:41.468, Speaker A: Doing things with carbon dioxide certificates, as an example.
00:14:41.634 - 00:15:07.444, Speaker E: You mentioned logistics, supply chain. Always there's many parties. We are talking to a very large company about cars and what you can do with renting cars, having accidental cars, getting tickets, and all sorts of things that happen with, especially lease and rented cars. So if you have objects and several parties, I think there will be many.
00:15:07.482 - 00:15:16.964, Speaker F: Business processes and they are very interested in the business, critical business processes. So once they mint their processes, I mean, they can use their process on.
00:15:17.002 - 00:15:20.952, Speaker E: Blockchain, but interacting with counterparties, I think.
00:15:21.006 - 00:15:25.240, Speaker F: Then there will be reporting, there will be cross chains, there will be oracle.
00:15:27.180 - 00:15:28.330, Speaker C: And there is.
00:15:31.500 - 00:16:39.200, Speaker B: I see that Shiola has some great ideas there. I think probably like if blockchain is to replicate what's happening on the traditional world, as you were saying, then we need all the data that's available in the traditional world and that's why the possibilities are limited. So I guess also a question I would have for you guys is if we look at the ecosystems like Cosmos, Tezos, no, operators are building tooling around the ecosystem, right? So they're building explorers, they're building wallets. While Chainlink had a great contribution from Linkpool, which is basically a marketplace where node operators can just leave themselves, put out the jobs and the adapters they're using, and smart contract creators can easily choose what kind of the best to basically service the know. So a question would be really, what kind of tools, if any, are you looking to provide or are you looking to see being built on Chainlink? And how do you feel like the ecosystem of tooling will be evolving in the future in our ecosystem?
00:16:40.980 - 00:17:26.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll focus on what our focus actually is, which is security tooling. And I already had to talk about it, but I'm going to say it again. For us, the security of the keys is extremely important because that's what we actually rely on when we want to securely respond to requests to our call. And the security of the key is one of the most essential parts of it, because that's the key used to actually sign the response. And that's the key that's potentially going to guard a lot of things that will lie in our notes and a lot of responsibility and liability as well. So what we will be contributing is a key management solution and potentially some security fixes and contributions to the chainlink node to make operations more secure, especially looking at the future staking.
00:17:30.020 - 00:18:30.484, Speaker C: On our side. I think that recently we are moving on the development side. Our team is growing and for sure we want to focus on create tools. We are already developing tool for other chains that we want to give to our customer user, let's call it customer. One thing that we are strong actually, is the community, because we are organizing meetup all around the world. We are organizing meetup in Bangkok, we are organizing events in Seoul about Defi. And I think that the community will be also a key because bringing people and make people know about Chainlink and this data that can be used is also a big project.
00:18:30.484 - 00:18:42.810, Speaker C: And yeah, pretty much we are trying to focus also on developing tools that will help people to understand, also to make things easy as possible.
00:18:46.780 - 00:20:13.504, Speaker A: A question which is posed to me, because with the marketplace, we've been trying to dedicate a lot of time into building tools for the ecosystem. For me personally, I think a lot of the advancements in terms of tooling will be due to protocol development at the minute, if you want to use Chainlink, you need to go on and manually find nodes, what can do like a certain type of job for you. And you need to make sure that you've got a certain amount of nodes that support it and they've all got the jobs listed and adapted. All the jobs are defined by the node operators themselves rather than requested by the user. So I think if like for example, the service agreement protocol is what it's formerly known as is the method where the power of what is requested is given to the end user rather than the node operator. So I think picturing our marketplace and especially like a prepayment protocol, if you can think, if you go on and you can just say, I want to create a new service agreement, and the service agreement will last twelve months long, and we will select a random list of 500 nodes, will all meet your criteria of what you want on that service agreement. And then you request, I want this API and I want it to be transformed in this way and then written back to this contract.
00:20:13.504 - 00:21:04.020, Speaker A: So rather than node operators defining what can be done, it's more the power is then given to the end users. And us guys as node operators could be in a twelve month long service agreement where we get prepaid, a certain amount of link tokens to facilitate a contract. And I think when that's the case, and then especially mixing now with threshold signatures where gas, as much as the gas doesn't scale, it's going to be extremely exciting because anyone can just go on and then suddenly create a request. And then you've got a thousand random nodes all meet your criteria, and you've told the node operators to fetch this API rather than the node operators advertising that they can fetch that API. So it turns, and for me that's where the protocol becomes a lot more mature and powerful.
00:21:05.400 - 00:21:34.320, Speaker F: Well, we want to support, for example, node operators with dashboards. So we have insights, we have all the data readily available, we can host the dashboard, we can create alarms and provide insight. For example, if you rent out a node, if you pool your node, if you're running nodes for customers, you need bidding at some point, generate some reports or paper, even, or at least PDF.
00:21:35.140 - 00:21:37.456, Speaker E: There might be taxes involved and there.
00:21:37.478 - 00:21:39.740, Speaker F: Might be even an auditor if you're doing enterprise.
00:21:39.820 - 00:21:42.708, Speaker A: So this is what we are interested.
00:21:42.794 - 00:21:44.710, Speaker F: In and hope to provide.
00:21:48.040 - 00:21:49.444, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense.
00:21:49.562 - 00:22:10.430, Speaker B: Well, I'm in a position where basically all the questions I wrote were answered already by you guys. I guess the best way to continue forward is like we have a red crowd. So maybe if you guys have any questions to ask, we can start a Q and A. Come on guys, it's an exciting talk.
00:22:11.520 - 00:22:12.350, Speaker A: All right.
00:22:17.120 - 00:22:17.948, Speaker G: No one else is going.
00:22:17.954 - 00:22:19.070, Speaker E: To ask this question?
00:22:19.920 - 00:22:20.896, Speaker A: No, I was just going to say.
00:22:20.918 - 00:22:54.520, Speaker G: What'S the biggest obstacle to decentralization in terms of the data feed that you're seeing? If you're thinking about enterprise, is it like for example insurance? Does that make sense as a question? So in the sense of if we're thinking about a decentralized data feed into a contract, we're all providing various forms of infrastructure to try and meet that demand. But from your perspective, what are the biggest obstacles to ensuring that decentralization continues?
00:23:00.400 - 00:23:04.520, Speaker D: I think one big obstacle is probably regulation and liability.
00:23:04.680 - 00:23:06.828, Speaker A: Because if we have threshold signatures and.
00:23:06.834 - 00:23:32.710, Speaker D: We have multiple people verifying some data, who is in the unliable? And that's the problem corporates will see and we won't be able to provide a simple solution at the moment because while you before had one counterparty which was this API, it's now potentially 1620 more nodes. Who are you going to sue? I think this is a major problem because that's what these corporates think about when they implement them.
00:23:34.520 - 00:24:12.070, Speaker F: Right, but it's actually starting ahead of time. Who's going to guarantee anything? That's why we are centralized company. And my basic pitch always is EV events bridges the new world which is decentralized to the old world which is centralized. So you need some single instance or something that promises features of a service, for example, reliability, speed, whatnot, and then actually pays or does something if they don't deliver. It's a complex thing. Also a mindset question.
00:24:13.880 - 00:24:14.630, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:16.360 - 00:25:20.600, Speaker A: So for decentralized data I think one of the biggest mistakes that could be made is even if you request 1000 nodes, for example, they all points to the same API because if that goes down, then it's game over, you've got 1000 on it. So I think a big hurdle will be finding a lot of reliable data sources that provide the data points that you need. Because when it gets to a point where end users request data, it's not like you're going to be getting 50 nodes all using different APIs individually. You're probably going to get 50 nodes who are calling five or six APIs concurrently. And then there's some form of aggregation done between those APIs and then aggregation between all of the different oracles as well. So at least in that scenario, the room for error I think is extremely minimal. And if you think about, like I mentioned, service agreements, one of the notations of a service agreement is incumbent parameters.
00:25:20.600 - 00:26:45.540, Speaker A: Those parameters are essentially like an SLA through that agreement, when you've got to respond by the allowed deviation of return data thrown out, for example. I think a lot of those hurdles might be tackled and done by the protocol changes in the future. But I think in terms of even what we do as developers and adapter support and identifying different APIs, we need to make sure that we use as many as we can. And the level of decentralization, especially for very important contracts, is extremely high to the point that it's nearly trustless. It's trust minimized rather than fully trustless. And I think at least in terms of liability, and if anything does go wrong, I think at least because this is all blockchain based, if you got to a point where a company, even potentially sued node operators, at least you have then got the visibility and the traceability of all the data, what was returned back. So the fault can be pointed to the part that fault, and I think at least what change is trying to, what they're aiming to achieve is get to a point where the middlemen, the oracles are never at fault.
00:26:50.440 - 00:27:30.770, Speaker C: I would just try to visualize this topic and I think that probably because if you are talking about insurance for example, would be something that would be dependent, not dependent, sorry, we change country per country. So I think that probably we realize kind of a node operator, not certified, but maybe recognized by the country, probably not the full solution, but probably can work.
00:27:33.800 - 00:27:54.570, Speaker B: Any other questions? I guess I would have a question like maybe what is your outlook on the event of the t? So basically when node operators we have the possibility to run software in process and execution environments, what do you think the repercussions will be both on a regulatory and maybe even technical point of view?
00:27:58.320 - 00:29:01.500, Speaker D: Actually we haven't explored too much when it comes to regulations in apart, but looking into tech will obviously require have different requirements to hardware. What you're doing is using Intel SGX and that will obviously limit the platforms that we can use, but we're seeing more and more adapt. So I think that's not going to be a blocking factor. I just see a lot of just exciting possibilities once you have a trusted execution environment built into the application. But yeah, it's obviously going to be a bit of a limiting factor, maybe even pushing some people towards using dedicated hardware compared to cloud, because SGX is not that widely available in cloud. It's coming, but it's going to take time. I'm looking forward to seeing traction of non trusted execution based oracles and data sources and aggregators before we get into that stage because the tech is sometimes just not defined.
00:29:06.740 - 00:30:22.724, Speaker C: We are working mostly behind the scene, I can say because as I started working for steakfish, I bring in the company all the best practices I was using before. So we are approaching all the framework we already started to apply to our company, the ASo 27,000 we are using. For example for the maturity model we use Isaka cobit and we are trying to push and push company wise also the NIST framework CIS. I mean we are mostly working on behind the scene for sure we are using the best practice also for security measure for key management, but we are mostly active behind the scenes. So that's why also we are not talking so much about security. But yeah, most of it is behind because process also important also treat model if you have the best HSM but then you get compromised on social hacking or your employees. This is Ssh.
00:30:22.724 - 00:30:23.530, Speaker C: Key.
00:30:28.940 - 00:31:50.896, Speaker A: Trusted execution environments and regulations I think is going to be an interesting one in the future because you only have to look at for example Zcash being removed from Coinbase in the UK as an example. You know, Coinbase got a new banking partnershash got removed because it didn't fit in line. So I think if you take that same example and then start thinking about trust execution environments and generalised computation with Waza in PES, you're going to get to a point where you've got contracts on chain where the logic of the contract and the actual outcome and what is being calculated and the inputs and the outputs are completely shielded to the point where only the people who built the contract know what the contract is doing. So you could get to a point where you're getting millions of dollars being paid out. But why and how and when is all completely shielded and no one other than the people involved in that contract know. So it's interesting, but I think it's going to have to be embraced because the reason this technology exists in the first place is to give power back to the people and the creators and make sure everyone has access to defi products. But yeah, definitely agree with what's been said around certifications and improving your integrity.
00:31:50.928 - 00:31:52.064, Speaker E: As a node operator.
00:31:52.192 - 00:32:20.400, Speaker A: I think we've seen some teams starting to span up to give formal verifications of people running nodes. So you get a stamp and say I've passed this test and going through certain certifications is something we're looking at doing now as well. I think that's going to be a big market and I think especially if we run in a marketplace, I think giving visibility of that information to all the end users and the contract creators is absolutely vital.
00:32:21.780 - 00:32:29.104, Speaker F: Yeah, I actually don't have anything to add. So it's the processes. I don't think the hardware is the thing. It'll come there.
00:32:29.142 - 00:32:33.584, Speaker C: It will be there. We are still in the early days, so we'll see.
00:32:33.622 - 00:32:42.710, Speaker F: I think it's always the people. So it will be politics, it will be regulation, governance, social contract, blah, blah, blah. There's like many things to come.
00:32:46.760 - 00:33:01.640, Speaker B: I think that's all for this not operator panel. So thanks again, guys. It was a great discussion and, yeah, awesome. Thank you very much for this session. And that closes it for the day for our oracle hacker. So we'll see you back tomorrow.
