00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.798, Speaker A: Whenever I go out to meetups, people always ask me, they're like, okay, so you chain link, price feeds. Okay, got it. What about blockchain and real estate? I get that question all the time. So I'm really glad to have you here, Joel. We're going to talk about that. Let's get started and we'll actually get learning about this really interesting product, Citadel recently integrated chain link. So we're going to talk to him about real estate and blockchain and web3.
00:00:22.798 - 00:00:50.234, Speaker A: Here we go. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Joel from Cetadao. Cetadao does real estate and blockchain recently integrated Chainlink to get some data in their app and move some real estate to blockchain and vice versa. So, really wanted to touch base with you and learn a little bit more about this. Welcome, everybody.
00:00:50.234 - 00:00:59.120, Speaker A: Oh, the comments are blowing up now. GM to everybody. But Joel, why don't you lead us off? What is Citadel? What is the real value proposition? What do you guys do that's special?
00:00:59.490 - 00:01:35.366, Speaker B: Hi, Jim, everyone, and thank you, Andy, for this opportunity to present Citadel. So, before I begin, I'd just like to get some simple, typical disclaimer out of the way. So, for legal reasons, this is not investment advice, not solstitation or investment, or asking anyone to buy an investment product. And for practical reasons, I'd like to disclaim that the Sudan token is not sold by the project. So, Dyo. Okay, so coming back to Sudan, very excited to present our project to bring real estate into the webtree universe. In fact, our project will leverage DeFi to drive demand and unlock capital efficiency in real estate.
00:01:35.366 - 00:02:30.506, Speaker B: We believe that today's real estate lets assess liquidity and composability, even though it is a 280,000,000,000,000 market, a whole bunch of that capital is kind of locked. That means money that's not doing anything, not earning interest, not being invested, not being used to drive the economy. And our plan is to use DeFi to unlock that capital. And we believe that this will drive demand for real estate on chain, increase capital efficiency and enhance the warfare value of the real estate universe. In fact, in our vision, we believe that in future there will be two sets of prices for real estate, the price of real estate on chain and the price of real estate off chain. And we believe that the real estate on chain will always have a higher value than real estate off chain because there will be more use cases for the real estate tokens on chain. Unlike the limited use cases for the real estate off chain today, that is constrained by the existing limitations on how we can unlock that capital in real estate.
00:02:30.506 - 00:02:43.730, Speaker B: So we are building a series of sustainable defi ufms powered by real estate globally. And I'll be very excited to share more about how this is done shortly.
00:02:44.310 - 00:02:50.126, Speaker A: So we're talking about physical real estate, right? We're talking about property, not metaverse real estate.
00:02:50.238 - 00:02:50.802, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:50.936 - 00:03:20.746, Speaker A: Okay. And so one of the things you said is it's not liquid, right? If I own property, I can't do much with it. It can be collateral, a second mortgage in some cases, but it's pretty locked. And so what you're saying is if it is tokenized basically, or represented on chain, not necessarily tokenized, but represented on chain, then it can be put in wherever, whatever collateral for Defi, which gives you a lot more options. Am I getting that right?
00:03:20.848 - 00:03:58.134, Speaker B: Yeah, precisely. I mean, the moment we can tokenize real estate, make it into a digital asset, make it into a token, there's no stopping us from actually treating it as any collateralized digital assets, where you just go into a lending protocol, go into a pool, and out comes the USDC in a matter of minutes. You do not have to fill out lengthy bank application forms, do a whole bunch of ridiculous questions about your source of income, your source of fund, where you're from, so on and so forth. How old are you? It's just a simple real estate token in funding token out. Yeah.
00:03:58.332 - 00:04:16.334, Speaker A: So real estate, as I understand, it's one of the largest markets for traditional markets. Any fund, any investment can just hold a whole bunch of real estate on the side. And part of the value of that is because it doesn't do anything. It's property. It sits there. It just slowly appreciates. You're talking about something else.
00:04:16.334 - 00:04:40.440, Speaker A: You're talking about this utility for it, which is a little bit different. Is there a mismatch? There are traditional markets so accustomed to real estate as this existing steady thing that's off chain, that maybe it doesn't fit as collateral? Or are you guys seeing demand where people are realizing, oh, I can do stuff with all my other collateral, why can't I do stuff with my real estate? What are you seeing more of?
00:04:41.210 - 00:06:08.466, Speaker B: We are seeing more of people saying that, hey, why can't I do something with the real estate tokens? Right? If you look at it in terms of complexity, the companies of today, all the companies listed on the stock market, are more complicated asset classes than real estate is out. If you could have so much liquidity in those companies because they are listed on stock exchange and so forth. Why can't we tokenize real estate, achieve that same amount of liquidity and capital efficiency? And to take things one steps further, we have been looking at stable coins that are backed by fiat currency, stable coins that are backed by all kinds of algorithms and stuff. Why can't we have a real estate backed stablecoin one day? And that could be very real, right? Because if you look at your USDC, your USDT, for example, they have to be backed by the fiat currency. And typically in these cases, because fiat currency, you can borrow and lend them, even if you do a constant audit all the time, you never know if the fault currency is sitting in the bank account at all point in time. Whereas for real estate, imagine real estate back kind of tokens, you know that you can't borrow and lend a tighter deed. Like, you can do it for us dollar, literally, right? So that means that if you have a real estate token that's backed by the under know, this real estate token is always backed by the real estate all the time.
00:06:08.466 - 00:06:55.646, Speaker B: Now, I guess one thing that is missing all along is the ability to redeem your real estate token for the underlying title deed. Just like how you can redeem your US dollar with your USDC. That has been one of the biggest issue. We have found a way to do that. And by doing that, not only does it legitimize the real estate token, because now you could actually redeem the title deed with your real estate token, it acts as a flaw to the on chain value of your real estate token. Because if ever the price of your valuation of your on chain value real estate token ever falls below the value of the real estate in real life, you could easily just buy out all the tokens, redeem the title, sell it in real life for profit. So now that's a backstop.
00:06:55.646 - 00:06:59.220, Speaker B: There's a real flaw to your actual token value.
00:07:00.150 - 00:07:18.722, Speaker A: Interesting. There's so many cool ideas here in these little nuances as well. We have a whole bunch of people who have joined us since then, so I want to make sure and say hello, everybody. Welcome to this YouTube ama with chain link on Chainlink. Official YouTube. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Joel from Citadel.
00:07:18.722 - 00:07:44.590, Speaker A: Citadel is doing real estate on blockchain, and really, they're pulling property rights from real estate, real world real estate into web3 to use as collateral. So you can do more with your real estate collateral as well. Hello, Frank. Hello, Nana. I see Echo. I see a whole bunch of people in there saying the gms. If you guys have questions, feel free, drop them in there, say hello and bring questions.
00:07:44.590 - 00:07:53.540, Speaker A: We're going to have a chat a little bit more about this. Now, of course, Citadel is on here because you've recently integrated Chainlink. What are you using Chainlink feeds for?
00:07:53.910 - 00:08:47.874, Speaker B: That's a very good question. So one of the utility we want to achieve for real estate on chain is the ability to actually collateralize the real estate, taking your mortgage on chain. So one of the key use cases we see for real estate tokens on chain especially, or rather real estate on chain, there's more capital efficient in the real world. Now imagine this. You probably have a coffee talk with, you probably have a gathering, and then you heard from some of your pals that there's this new coin or this new project that everybody should be aping into. But imagine what if your only asset class today is a piece of property that is fully paid up, no mortgage on it, and you need to access the equity that is locked in there. Now imagine doing this on a Sunday morning, 03:00 a.m.
00:08:47.874 - 00:09:03.514, Speaker B: In the morning, calling up your banker, telling banker, dude, I need a mortgage now. I need a cash in now. Because there's this really amazing project that's trending and I need to ape in before it moons, right? What do you think a banker will tell you? First of all, if he even answer a call you try to f of.
00:09:03.552 - 00:09:07.420, Speaker A: It doesn't need to be 03:00 a.m. On a Sunday. I know my banker is going to tell me.
00:09:10.910 - 00:10:17.742, Speaker B: So imagine, right, if you have the real estate instate in real estate token, you could easily deposit this real estate token into a lending protocol the likes of advocateable money, very capital cream finance, and out comes the funding token. You need to literally aid into whatever projects to realize the opportunity instantly. And after the token has moon, you could just convert it back to the funding token and redeem your real estate token from the lending pool. Easy. And the idea behind is that in order for these lending pools to be set up, we need the chain link link feedback. Because ultimately where we see the value is in the reserve price of the token, which is literally the real estate value in real life. Now how do we take that price, that value on chain? Now what we have done is one of our community projects, literally corporate market cap have came up with this idea of taking valuation in the real world on chain on a regular basis.
00:10:17.742 - 00:10:49.494, Speaker B: So what we're going to have is a bunch of valuers from the big valuation houses that we engage to do a monthly valuation of the property. One, to make sure the property is still there standing. Two, to make sure that we have sort of a reality check, what is the real price of the property at all point in time, the average price will be fed via the chain link, fee on chain for the lending protocol to develop their liquidation strategy, for them to develop their loan to value limits, for them to develop their interest rate, and so on and so forth.
00:10:49.542 - 00:10:49.994, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:50.112 - 00:11:10.366, Speaker B: And that is the critical component that we need to actually ensure that the real estate tokens we bring on chain ultimately can be collateralized, can be leveraged to give better efficiency to the locked capital in real estate. That is not something we can achieve in real life today. That's something we can achieve on chain with Chainlink.
00:11:10.558 - 00:11:35.130, Speaker A: So there's evaluators that are off chain, they're finding price and data. They're doing this valuation, they're doing this service. There's a lot of those sorts of providers for real estate valuation across the world, right? Different regions have all their different own, localities have their different own. But to get that data on chain, that's where Chainlink comes in. It's an adapter. It pulls it in so that you can get this essentially a price feed. It's like a price feed, but for this real estate.
00:11:35.130 - 00:11:58.862, Speaker A: Awesome. You know, I see these use cases for those developers who are interested. I'll try and find a link for this. Or actually, Jose, I think you're here moderating. Find a link to the docs for external adapters so people can find those. This is kind of that first level technology that people can use to get APIs and other kind of data on chain. We'll make sure and get a link to that in the chat as well.
00:11:58.862 - 00:12:19.820, Speaker A: So that's really cool. We're starting to get a whole bunch of questions as well, which is kind of exciting before we get to the questions. I see your questions and some of them are awesome. So I'm going to get to them. Joel, why don't we take a look at your website and your platform so you can kind of show us how does this work? And then after that, we'll start getting to some of these questions that people have. Does that work?
00:12:20.750 - 00:12:48.034, Speaker B: Yeah, for the website currently we have deployed on Testnet. The website is just a basic landing page right now. Okay. What we have over here is a presentation that will give more insights into the soda project. If I could just perhaps run through very quickly as well as our upcoming IO coming up. That will be very guess right.
00:12:48.072 - 00:13:09.206, Speaker A: Before you start, we have more people who have just joined, so I want to just introduce real quick and then we'll do it. Hey, everybody, welcome for new people. My name is Andy from Chainlink Labs. We're talking to Joel from Citadao. And Citadao is bringing real estate valuations on chain so that you can use them as collateral in composable defi protocols. If you didn't understand what any of that stuff means, go back to the beginning. But it's really, really cool.
00:13:09.206 - 00:13:29.310, Speaker A: And I get a lot of questions about real estate and blockchain. And so Joel's going to walk us through kind of some of the basics of Citadel and how it works, and then we're going to get to a bunch of your questions. I have a bunch more questions as well, but I have audience questions as well, but feel free to drop your questions in the chat if you have them. We'll try and get to as many as we can. Joel, go ahead and take us through this.
00:13:29.460 - 00:13:58.118, Speaker B: Sounds good. Yeah, so thank you very much, Andy. So just a quick introduction. Now, what we are doing, we are not just tokenizing real estate. We are actually building sustainable defi yield farms powered by real estate globally. The idea is to introduce productive assets on chain to supply the demand for high yields that we see today. In fact, we have seen the d five space exploded over the last couple of months.
00:13:58.118 - 00:15:08.240, Speaker B: Literally in 2021, it has gone from less than 25 billion to more than 200 billion today. The thing about is that we believe at the sedal team that these use are unsustainable and they will begun to decline, revert to mint as more and more money come on chain to chase increasingly sparse supply of quality, productive projects. And that's where we think real estate can play a part. We believe that real estate, with its own inherent u, driven by its own rental u, can meet the supply for you in the defi space. Let me just scroll down further. So the idea behind is we see the real estate tokens offering stronger stability and you than traditional stable coins, because one, we believe that real estate tokens are fully decentralized. Each SPV holds an individual real estate issuing its own real estate token distributed all over the world, not centralized, a bank account, which the US dollar is.
00:15:08.240 - 00:16:44.870, Speaker B: And I think something that's really interesting that have been trending in terms of the queries we're getting, is the idea of how real estate on chain can act as a tangible inflation resistant asset with low volatility because of its ability to generate real rental yield and capital gains. The idea being that today, if you look at typical crypto native portfolio, you have your native tokens, which are highly volatile, and then you have your stable coins which are inflationary in nature. Because if the government, central government decides to print more money, there goes your purchasing power. Stablecoin we think that real estate token asset asset class sitting right in the middle, offering low volatility and inflation hatch might be the way to go, especially in a world where inflation seems to be less transitory and more permanent. This is it. Having some issues and the idea behind the Suda project is to leverage Defi, as I mentioned earlier, to unlock capital efficiency. We believe today's real estate in the real world, let's assess liquidity and composability, and we will be able to introduce better accessibility, liquidity and composability with as mentioned earlier, we believe there'll be two sets of prices in the future, price of USD on chain and price of USD off chain.
00:16:44.870 - 00:17:28.010, Speaker B: Price of real estate on chain will have a higher value than the price of USD off chain. If you think about it today, imagine you have an iPhone, and the iPhone only have three functionality allows you to make a phone call, text a friend, via SMS, no less, and probably take a photo of yourself. But you can't share the photo with anyone without physically sharing the phone with anyone. Now, how much will you pay for the iPhone? Probably 200, $300. But now imagine what changes. You have the App Store coming in, and then on top of the App Store, you attract a whole bunch of developers to come in to build an ecosystem that increase the use cases for the iPhone. Today, iPhone costs 1000 plus dollars and nobody blink an eye.
00:17:28.010 - 00:18:10.126, Speaker B: This is exactly what we are doing. We are building the App Store for real estate and we are doing it on chain in the Webtree space. We believe by increasing the use case through the DeFi composability for the real estate token itself, it will drive demand for the real estate token, which will ultimately increase the value for the real estate on chain itself. In fact, we believe that in future, the value of real estate on chain will increasingly be driven by the use cases for the real estate token itself, with the underlying real estate contributing only a fraction of the actual value of the real estate token. So real estate today is a very traditional asset class. That's right. For disruption.
00:18:10.126 - 00:18:49.730, Speaker B: And we believe that the time for disruption is now. All assets will automatically be tokenized in the new world, just like how everything securitized today. Technologies available today, sufficient liquidity on chain, with many limitations to bridge. The real estate meet space with the blockchain is in the regulatory hurdle and the liquidity hurdle, both of which we have the solution to. And this is how the whole Silda platform works. We are a permissionless two way tokenization bridge for real estate. And by that I mean that Suda platform will allow landlords to independently list the real estate on chain on the platform after a simple KYC AML check and ownership verification.
00:18:49.730 - 00:19:34.814, Speaker B: So a bit like a zillow. The difference being that in this case, after being listed on chain, potential participants will be invited to commit their interest in factions of the real estate through a process called the IO, otherwise known as introducing real estate on chain. If this IO is successful, a bridge will be formed and the NFT representing the economic legal benefits to the real estate will be minted. You'll be custody into a smart contract, fraction of which the ERC 20 will be deposited into the buyer wallet. This ERC 20 is the real estate token and will be tradable on the Amm. In this case, we are looking at uniswap v three for the amm. Now, what makes us unique and different from other projects is the ability for anyone to actually detokenize the real estate.
00:19:34.814 - 00:20:08.080, Speaker B: As I mentioned earlier, this is a very important link, and I believe we are the first project to have established the link, the ability to take your real estate token and exchange it for the title date. And you do so by buying out all the remaining ERC 20 faction real estate token holders and redeeming the NFT, which give you access to the title date as well as the assets of the SPV that's holding onto the real estate. So not only does this legitimize. Sorry, go ahead.
00:20:08.610 - 00:20:19.218, Speaker A: Are there to economic models around how many ERC 20 per NFT? Do you have a sense of that model yet, how that will work?
00:20:19.384 - 00:21:00.960, Speaker B: That's a good question. So the model will work by way of every single IRO will be an independent project on its own. So now it's just a listing platform. Each IR project, let's say if it's a 20 million property, there will be 20 million ERC 20 tokens that will be minted. So they will establish a one to one ratio where initial I O price will be one dollars per one ERC 20 token. This helps to benchmark real estate across the board, because if you know that, if the price you subsequently see is about one point fifty cents, you know that effectively this real estate token is 50% up from the initial IO price.
00:21:01.650 - 00:21:12.914, Speaker A: Joel, we've got a ton of questions and I want to give the audience a chance because some of these are just so good. That's clearly a group of thoughtful people who are very interested in real estate on chain. So do you mind if we jump into some of these?
00:21:13.032 - 00:21:14.530, Speaker B: Definitely, just go ahead.
00:21:14.680 - 00:21:46.026, Speaker A: So for those who have just joined, we had another group of people just join. I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs. This is Joel from Citadel. Citadel has recently integrated Chainlink to pull price data on chain for real estate. So, Matt, your question, are you going to offer Oracle services for real estate and how do you estimate the value of properties? There are oracle services for real estate and you can find them at. Oh, what's the one? It's not reputation chain link, it's the network. Anyways, I'm blanking on it right now, but there's a list of all the different data providers and some of them are real estate valuation data providers.
00:21:46.026 - 00:22:15.990, Speaker A: And you can call that data like an API, but then it's an oracle call into a smart contract. So that is available now via Chainlink and that's what Citadel is doing. They're pulling that valuation data to be able to call prices for this. I'm going to go a little bit up to the top because I think this is a really interesting question about your go to market. What type of real estate are you focused on? If you think about commercial real estate versus residential real estate? Very different profiles, especially as you are launching.
00:22:16.330 - 00:22:43.920, Speaker B: That's a very good question. We are focusing on commercial real estate in Commonwealth countries. So far we are looking at version two that allow us to bridge into non commonwealth countries via SPV setup in Commonwealth countries, but currently it's commercial real estate in Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth countries are the likes of your United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. So these are all based on english law.
00:22:44.930 - 00:23:10.680, Speaker A: Bill's got a question that relates to another one down below. But how do we know the real estate is real? I see something tokenized on chain, I go to the seated out site and I click yes and I give you $20 million. Okay, good for me. But where's the verification? Or if there's something that's not verified, somebody asked down below in the comments, who do I go to? What's the sort of legal space? How have you tied that up?
00:23:12.170 - 00:23:53.350, Speaker B: That's a good question also. And that ties in with this slide here. Exactly. So between zero one and zero two, if there's sufficient commitment waste for the IO, a transaction will take place whereby the tighter deed for the real estate will be transferred into a brand new SPV that will hold the title date. Now, your real estate tokens, everything will give you access to the SPV and the underlying title date in SPV. And you can easily check the caveat for this transaction anytime. And that should give you kind of indication that rather verification that the real estate is real.
00:23:53.350 - 00:24:17.680, Speaker B: Obviously prior to that, there will be an ownership verification check prior to the IO starting and that will be signed off by a law firm. So the law firm's name is also there for you to think. I hope that answers your question. Yeah, cool.
00:24:18.210 - 00:24:39.240, Speaker A: Cameron has a really interesting question. I haven't seen this in your model yet, so maybe this is roadmap, or maybe once you hear it, you'll put it on your roadmap. When I have a token, an ownership token, does that represent claim to yields from like rent or payments if I've got renters as an owner? Or is that managed separately? Or how do you negotiate that?
00:24:41.050 - 00:25:25.650, Speaker B: It gives you claim to the underlying title itself. It does not give you claim to the rent for a simple reason. Our real estate tokens, we have structured such that we have received a legal opinion that it's not a security token, but by giving you right to actually claim the rent, that will have tip it into the category of security token. So obviously, being not a security token does unlock opportunities in terms of liquidity. Being able to list it on a lot more platforms than you would be allowed to if you had been a security token. That kind of brings me down to this illustration here. I guess that should explain what happens to the rent.
00:25:25.650 - 00:26:22.342, Speaker B: So this is kind of the cash flow and this is kind of the model. Like what will happen to the rent collected from the real estate effectively. Okay, so to begin with, the moment the SPV have the title, you will independently appoint independent property manager the likes of CBI Jr, Kushman. These are professional property managers who will be in charge of everything from sourcing leasing the tenant all the way down to facilities management of the underlying real estate. The tenant will transfer, pay the USD, or pay the rent into the Spbank account, which will be auto swapped into a crypto exchange, which the SPV account have. It will then be used to inject into a smart contract that will buy and burn the underlying vested token. So that's how it's kind of distributed back in a way.
00:26:22.476 - 00:26:53.730, Speaker A: Cool. This is a really interesting model. Like what do you do with some of these other complicating factors? Great question above. And then YZ has something that's. And this is one of my questions as know there's other tokenization projects that have run into some roadblocks. Know, being careful of is this a security token or not? How do you negotiate that? What are some of these things that you need to have been thinking about as you walk into this? For people who are curious about this project, understanding, how are you approaching regulatory sort of impositions?
00:26:54.230 - 00:27:53.570, Speaker B: So real estate is unique because it's not just the securities token aspect. You have your fragmented landlords all over the world, one country, even within one country, the different cities, the different states will have its own land laws and so on and so forth. So those will be some of the potential regulations projects will struggle with and we will typically run into and above and beyond that you will have your. That's kind of the reason why we only deal with completed commercial real estate for the moment. Because the moment you touch development assets, you will run into a different set of landloss or development loss and so on and so forth. And the moment you touch residential real estate, that's when things can get really complicated. So to ensure that we are scalable right off the beginning, we only focusing on commercial real estate.
00:27:54.710 - 00:28:23.398, Speaker A: There's a bunch of questions about some of the mechanics behind this. Jonathan, I see you here. Alejandro, fantastic questions. And we won't have time to get to all of them, but there is a telegram and discord link down in the description where you can join the Cedadow community and go be part of this community to figure this stuff out. I'm sure they would welcome you into their community. Before we leave off properly and everything, two things. One, we had a whole bunch of people join, so hi, I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs.
00:28:23.398 - 00:28:50.946, Speaker A: I'm talking to Joel from Cedadao. This will live on YouTube for a long time. So whenever we end, which is in the next couple of minutes, go back and rewatch from the beginning and learn how Cedar Dow is using Chainlink to pull real estate data on chain to then give value to real estate, which you can then use as collateral for d five protocols. Fascinating model from the comment section. People are clearly passionate about this and very interested. So Joel, I very much appreciate your time. Before you go though, give us a little bit of a roadmap peek.
00:28:50.946 - 00:28:55.240, Speaker A: What's your kind of coming weeks and months quarter? What are we looking at for 2022?
00:28:56.010 - 00:29:33.038, Speaker B: Sounds good. So this is kind of our roadmap. We are currently at a proof of concept launch. In fact, on the 7 January 2 next year, next month, literally coming to another year, we will be bringing 20 million real estate on chain. This real estate is very unique. It symbolizes two things. First, because our legal structure is formulated around english law, welcome and wealth law, this real estate will be based in the UK, in the capital of Wales, Cardiff.
00:29:33.038 - 00:30:11.902, Speaker B: And it's a very prime real estate located right on Queen street. And the second part of this, this real estate is actually listed currently to a global blue chip bank. First of all, obviously, the very good tenant profile. Secondly, I think it symbolized something bigger. It symbolized the transition from traditional finance to web3 defi. We thought that it's going to be very meaningful to pick this for our genesis IR project. That's kind of the big thing that we are moving towards right now.
00:30:11.902 - 00:31:12.370, Speaker B: The moment that is tokenized drop on chain, we will be integrating with a few projects we are speaking with currently, some of which I mentioned earlier, some of the land protocols which I mentioned earlier, the likes of Abra Capital Money, the likes of very capital, likes of cream finance, exploring opportunities to leverage on the chain link fee to start creating collateralized versus tokens on chain. And with that, obviously, we hope to bring this to scale this up. Subsequently, our second project is actually hacker house, right in the center of the city of London, will be located on Cover Garden. It's called Southern House. We are planning to make that into a space for the community together. And thereafter we will move towards scaling up the rest of our portfolio on chain during the better stage. Somewhere in Q 222.
00:31:12.370 - 00:31:53.040, Speaker B: In second half, 2022. That's when things are going to get exciting, because then we are going to allow the platform to be used by any landlord in the public space. So landlords can literally come to the platform, leave the real estate on chain for defi community to choose to ape into permissioners only permission is you have to have the legitimate title deed and the right to sell. And then thereafter, we hope to scale the platform up to a minimum of 4 billion in AuM TvL by third quarter 2020. So, yeah, these are the spaces that we'll be looking into.
00:31:53.650 - 00:32:21.610, Speaker A: I'm really excited to see this, Cardiff, the press around that. I think if you guys do that right, that would be really fun to see. That's a really unique one. Very thoughtful of you as well. There are so many more great questions in the chat that we have not had time to get to. So, Jonathan, I see yours about how do you handle equity for maintenance and who handles maintenance and all that. I think that was also addressed as part of the rents.
00:32:21.610 - 00:32:41.834, Speaker A: Citadel has thought of that. It is part of that. Oh, Alejandro, asks, how will it be taxed? Like, really interesting. That probably just aligns with other international property ownership, but still understanding that as well. And other people. Oh, is this an open source project? Find out about that. All in the communities down below in the YouTube description, there's discord.
00:32:41.834 - 00:32:44.238, Speaker A: I don't know if there's telegram. I don't remember what's down there.
00:32:44.404 - 00:32:46.362, Speaker B: We are discord.
00:32:46.426 - 00:33:07.080, Speaker A: Okay, there's discord. So go join the channels, follow their website, follow them on Twitter to get updates as well. Joel, thank you so much for coming on. I'm going to point people to this video when they have questions for me, which they always do. Real estate always comes up. And in a couple of months, I want to talk to you and see how the Cardiff house went and how things are going. Can we catch up?
00:33:07.770 - 00:33:28.238, Speaker B: That's great. Definitely looking forward to. And probably, hopefully if the lockup is lifted by them, we can probably do our next one at the crypto community space and convert garden London, I would love british museum into a crypto physical house, a hacker house we can use for ourselves within the crypto community.
00:33:28.404 - 00:33:36.578, Speaker A: All right. We'll work it out. We'll get a camera there. We'll figure something out and we'll do something fun. Again, Joel, thank you so much for hanging out. It's been nice to meet you and talk to you.
00:33:36.744 - 00:33:38.500, Speaker B: Thank you, Andy. Thank you, everyone.

I do talks like these with amazing projects like Cedar Dow about twice a week. Next week is off and this week this is the only one because of the US holidays. But the next one it looks like is January 3 for now, and that's at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time with a protocol. We do NFT projects.
