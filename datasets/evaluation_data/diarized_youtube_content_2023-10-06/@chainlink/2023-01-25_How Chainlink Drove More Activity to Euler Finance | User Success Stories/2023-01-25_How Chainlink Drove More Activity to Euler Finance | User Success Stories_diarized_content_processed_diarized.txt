00:00:10.330 - 00:00:36.454, Speaker A: I'm Seraphim from oiler finance. I'm head of risk. So, oiler finance and Chainlink are integrated when it comes to the pricing feed, which was done, I think, in August. So that's been integrated for most major assets on Euler. And, yeah, before that, Oida finance was completely dependent on uniswap TWaps. But there's a bit of research into this that possibly, after the merge, the security assumptions kind of break down. So chain Inc.
00:00:36.454 - 00:01:16.334, Speaker A: Was implemented as a way to tackle that, and since then, it's been working pretty well, and I'd say it's driven to more activity and more trust in the world of finance. Overall, I'd say it's just hedging the tail risk off, like TWap manipulation. That could occur. Hasn't occurred yet on uniswap TWaps, thankfully, but could occur. So I'd say just knowing that the tail risk is not there for really incorrect pricing has been good for the user overall. So there's two things. There's the Dex oiler swap, which an audit is lined up by, I think, January, February.
00:01:16.334 - 00:01:52.160, Speaker A: So looking forward to that. And then the second is called something called baby oiler. We haven't figured out a name yet for it, but it will allow people to kind of do whatever they want in a rari fuse fashion. So you can just walk oiler and just create, use anything as collateral, create whatever exposure you like. So, yeah, two quite exciting projects we're working on at the moment. So it would be great to see more products integrated with Chainlink. So, for instance, CBE was recently integrated with Chainlink, which allowed oilers to integrate it.
00:01:52.160 - 00:02:24.246, Speaker A: If that could be done with new OSDs like fraxe, I'm personally excited about if we have that. If other liquid staking solutions have chainlink pricing, that would be much easier to integrate with. So we'd be excited to see these products roll out and integrate chainlink. Feel free to go on app oil finance. You can simulate a bunch of trades before you do them, see what happens to your account, go on the forums, start to get involved in the governance process. You can go on discord. Ask me, Michael, anyone? Any question you like.
00:02:24.246 - 00:02:30.960, Speaker A: I'm on Twitter as well under seraphim, so feel free to just ping me and just ask whatever you feel like asking. Thank you.
