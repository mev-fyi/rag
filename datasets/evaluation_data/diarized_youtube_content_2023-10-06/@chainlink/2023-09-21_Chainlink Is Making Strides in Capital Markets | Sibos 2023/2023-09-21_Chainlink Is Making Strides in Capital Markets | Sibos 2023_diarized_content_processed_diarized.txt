00:00:44.332 - 00:00:48.994, Speaker A: Move their assets from web two to web3. The demand for CCIP is palpable.
00:00:49.122 - 00:01:00.140, Speaker B: These institutions are realizing for these ecosystems to work, you need CCIP to connect all of these different workflows to make capital markets work in a more efficient way.
