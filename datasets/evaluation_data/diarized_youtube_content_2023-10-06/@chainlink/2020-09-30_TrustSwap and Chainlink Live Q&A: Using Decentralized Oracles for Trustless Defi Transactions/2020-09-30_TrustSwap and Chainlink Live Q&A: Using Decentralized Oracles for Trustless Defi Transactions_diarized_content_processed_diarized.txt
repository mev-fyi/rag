00:00:00.330 - 00:00:29.794, Speaker A: Well, thanks, everyone for joining us today. Really excited to have Jeff Credekis from Trustwap joining. Really want to thank the trust swap and Chainlink communities for joining us on this live stream today. The goal of this Q and A is to allow the community to learn more about Trustwap, learn more about Chainlink, and learn more about the integration between the two. The agenda for today is be about 20 to 30 minutes long. We have some questions already ready to go. If you have some, feel free to drop them into the YouTube chat.
00:00:29.794 - 00:00:45.062, Speaker A: We'll try our best to get to them. If we don't, we'll definitely drop the links to join both of our communities and happy to answer those afterwards. So without further ado, yeah, Jeff would love if you maybe want to just introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about what you're working on.
00:00:45.196 - 00:01:02.942, Speaker B: For sure. Yeah. Thanks, Keenan. So, yeah, my name is Jeff Credekis, canadian guy, been in crypto for a decent amount of time. Kind of got started, actually. I just opened a Facebook group called Ethereum investing for me and some of my budies. Like right when Ethereum was kicking off, started with twelve of us, and then before we knew it, grew to 100 people, then 1000 people.
00:01:02.942 - 00:01:40.490, Speaker B: Now the network is around 300,000 people. And so it just kind of propelled me into this space of like, okay, yeah, this is something that I'm really passionate about and helping to lead a community, and that led me into create a social community of my own, which uptrend, which is one of the larger blockchain social media platforms out there right now. And uptrend actually kind of led me into creating trustswap in a weird way. So all these things have just really flowed together really effortlessly and nice. And so, yeah, I got into crypto for the whole ethos of being able to shift power from the middleman of the corporations back to the people. And that's what I'm still super excited to be doing today.
00:01:40.640 - 00:02:00.570, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Thanks for sharing. So I was reading a lot about Trustwap earlier, and it's interesting. So your background in uptrend. So this was a decentralized social network that you built and has tons of users, the biggest one in cryptocurrency. And so what led from there to wanting to start trustwap?
00:02:00.730 - 00:02:18.680, Speaker B: Yeah, uptrend. Well, essentially, when a project has tokens, we wanted to do an OTC deal. I'll just kind of cut to it. I won't give the long story. So we had some tokens. We wanted to sell some tokens to an investor, and the investor obviously wanted to buy a large amount, and he wanted to buy them at a discount. That's really standard for projects to be able to do.
00:02:18.680 - 00:02:56.482, Speaker B: But the thing is, we want to make sure that that investor is then going to take it, dump it on the market, and cause some price depreciation. We want to protect our community. So we said, hey, listen, what we want to do is make sure that it's vested over a period of time to ensure that there's not going to be a single event. So what do we do here? And they said, well, we can use a lawyer, and they're going to charge 5% to 10% in fees. And I said, well, that is absolutely insane. I'm like, your job? Because they're kind of like an OTC company. I'm like, your job is OTC? I'm like, what smart contracts do you use for this? And they said, well, we actually don't have any.
00:02:56.482 - 00:03:18.220, Speaker B: And so I said, that's insane. I'm like, I would assume that was the number one, easiest smart contract to build. So from that moment, I was just like, I got to build something. So that's where it all started. Trustswap started as just an escrow service to bridge the gap between venture capital and institutions to crypto companies, crypto projects, and the crypto market at large.
00:03:18.750 - 00:03:35.040, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, that's crazy to store. Those are the best entrepreneurial projects. It's coming from a problem that you actually need to use. So that's smart escrow. Right? Do you want to maybe kind of talk about your kind of product offerings and what you're focused on at the moment?
00:03:35.490 - 00:04:07.834, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. I mean, there's quite a list of them out right now that we're building and that we're working on. So the ones that we have on right now are the smart locks and the single and multi event payments. So just super quick to break those down. So, for example, if you have an investor that's investing into a project, you can make sure that, okay, you're not going to give them all the tokens up front, because if you're launching a project that creates the potential for them to sell immediately. So if you vest that over time, that spreads it out, has them long term in the project, that's a net positive for everybody.
00:04:07.834 - 00:04:23.626, Speaker B: Then you can also do team token locks. So the teams can lock up their tokens and have those vest over a period of time. Now. Disclaimer team token locks. Investor token locks don't audit code. They don't ensure that more tokens can't be minted. They're just one tool in the toolbox.
00:04:23.626 - 00:05:08.270, Speaker B: So it's not like an end all, be all scam prevention, but it's one thing that just helps projects get a little bit more validity and gives investors a little bit more confidence knowing that tokens are locked, invested over time. And then finally, the one that we have live right now is also the single event payment and the multi payment. So similarly to how you can do team locks or investor locks, you can do that for anybody. You don't have to be a team or an investor. You can allocate tokens as for example, like employee payroll. And then single event payment would just be, if you want to send a gift to somebody on their 18th birthday, you could set that and just forget about it. I'm a huge fan of the multi payment because it makes it way easier for my life as a CEO, the accountant's life.
00:05:08.270 - 00:05:16.210, Speaker B: Just set it, have it rolling, and you don't have to worry about it. So there's a lot of applications for these really couple really simple softwares.
00:05:16.630 - 00:05:33.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting. And the whole time based aspect and how there hasn't really been something like that ever created until now with this, how many people are using that escrow service and how much money is kind of going through that for sure.
00:05:33.052 - 00:05:54.734, Speaker B: Yeah. So the escrow service will be live within the week. We just got our audit back from hacking very recently, and so we're just putting the final touches on and then launching with escrow. So we have the locks and the multi payments going. And so we've been live for about ten days. So the volume isn't staggering at all. We're still establishing ourselves in the marketplace, getting some volume through there.
00:05:54.734 - 00:06:29.090, Speaker B: So it's nothing like millions of dollars on a daily basis. But with the implementation of these escrow services, we really do feel that we can get to that millions of dollars of daily volume actually fairly rapidly. We have integrations with exchanges to be their OTC desk, for example. So if you want to sell like $10 million worth of bitcoin or buy $10 million, putting a limit order or a market order is not always the best way to do it. You're going to have some crazy slippage. And so that's why these exchanges have OTC desks. But obviously you don't want to trust an exchange with that amount of money, so you'd rather trust the software.
00:06:29.090 - 00:07:18.630, Speaker B: So these exchanges can then white label our escrow solution so they can earn like two basis points on top of whatever fees are we have. And also we're going to be really pushing this to these OTC desks that I was talking about earlier that deal with vcs and institutions that are doing millions of dollars of deal flow because they're losing tons of money on those fees and they don't want, if they're used to paying, let's say, 1.5 or 2%, and now they can offer a service that charges 0.7% where they're actually earning 0.2. Well, they're going to do that all day. So we're implementing a lot of cool stuff for these people to be able to leverage our software to make money, like a ton of it. And so I think that's really going to help proliferate it into the ecosystem so that we just have an API that they can plug in and then off to the race as we go.
00:07:18.780 - 00:07:32.362, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a huge problem and saving a lot of people a lot of money. So you also have launchpad, which a lot of people are excited about. Do you want to maybe talk a little bit about that project that you guys are working on?
00:07:32.496 - 00:08:10.326, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. So the trust swap launchpad kind of came to be as we started realizing, hey, you have team token locks. Investor token locks. We're looking at something that we're building called DiCos, which is event based payments, meaning that the team only gets paid if they hit milestones. And we started to realize we're like all these things kind of come together to form what could be a fair style launch that has things that make it more safe, not 100% safe, but more safe for participants in these token sales. And so we're like, well, why don't we just do a launch pad where we can offer these projects using these services? And so that's what we have.
00:08:10.326 - 00:08:45.054, Speaker B: We have the trust swap launch pad. It's a competitor, I guess you could say, to the Binance launchpad, but it comes with a lot of other features that binance doesn't have. It's also decentralized, so it's not jurisdictional. And then the system that we have to get in that we're building is actually super cool. So I'm actually really excited about it. If you're staking swap tokens, let's say your average stake over the last 60 days is 5000 tokens, well, you're going to earn 5000 NFT lottery tickets. You can then put those lottery tickets into the draw and then if you get selected, boom, you got a winning ticket.
00:08:45.054 - 00:09:19.914, Speaker B: The cool thing is these 5000 tickets are transferable. You can buy more to increase your chance of being selected, sell them off if you don't want to use them. So that's very cool. And then even if you get like ten tickets selected, well, you got ten winning tickets so you can sell off those tickets. Or if you're like, oh, I didn't get selected, you could then go and buy a winning ticket to be able to participate in these launch pad projects because they're not doing big raises. We're making sure that the raises they do are fairly small so that it's very easy just to look historically like the last one sold out in 20 seconds. So we'd like to keep that trend alive.
00:09:19.914 - 00:09:31.682, Speaker B: So we're doing small raises so not many people can get in, like 400 people. So we're trying to create this ecosystem within the launch pad, leveraging nfts. And I think a lot of people, including myself, are really excited for it.
00:09:31.816 - 00:10:04.302, Speaker A: Yeah, that's one thing I noticed is that you guys have created this community around all these products. You got a lot of different offerings and they all kind of create this ecosystem within trustswap and fascinating. It's very cool, everything that you guys are working on and yeah, really excited for it. So I'd love to kind of dive into the technology around this a little bit. We've been working with your team and so what is the relationship with Chainlink and how are you using decentralized oracles within trustswap and these applications for sure?
00:10:04.356 - 00:10:29.186, Speaker B: Yeah, so essentially whenever a transaction comes in, if people want to lock tokens, if people want to use the escrow services, whatever the software is, there's going to be a fee associated with it. And one of the options to be able to pay is in Ethereum. So the price of Ethereum, we need to be able to fetch that off the blockchain. So we need to use an oracle. And so that is why we've integrated with chainlink because it just provides a really nice, easy Oracle solution.
00:10:29.378 - 00:10:40.470, Speaker A: Very cool. And so from your own personal opinion, how have you seen decentralized oracles kind of work with Defi and help grow Defi?
00:10:40.630 - 00:11:29.030, Speaker B: I think it's very interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing them expand even more because right now they're very much like in a lot of these, okay, against the price of the USD or this dollar or that dollar. And I'm looking forward to seeing Oracle's expanding into a lot more nuanced things, like how many shots did LeBron James make in the basketball game. Now you can start having these crazy bets based on all these real world events. So I see oracles as being, well, I mean, they're the link between the real world and the blockchain. And so it's absolutely necessary and mandatory for our blockchain ecosystem to be able to operate, to have oracles that are flexible and trusted. So I think that's why Chainlink and other Oracle solutions out there are so pivotal to the advancement of crypto in the everyday.
00:11:29.770 - 00:12:05.410, Speaker A: Yeah, there's. We just finished a hackathon, actually. It's funny that you say that, because there's actually a hackathon project that was built doing that with some. So, back to Trustwap, and what is your approach to decentralized finance, and where do you see this space kind of going with everything that's happening? You have this launch pad. There's obviously a lot of different stuff that's coming out. There's a lot of noise. How does trustswap kind of plan to kind of minimize that noise and use this ecosystem kind of filter?
00:12:07.270 - 00:12:50.046, Speaker B: There's always a funny question, because there's always, always going to be noise. There's always going to be crazy people, or let's just say polarizing opinions. That's maybe a more correct way to say it. But essentially what we just really want to do is build software, and we want people to use the software, like escrow services, crypto subscriptions. Like these are multibillion dollar industries, and we don't need a four chan shill army to make sure that we're doing millions upon billions of dollars of volume through these contracts. It'll just happen of itself because it's a value proposition. So I think a lot of people who might have seen the way that trustwap interacts, and we go pretty heavy on marketing.
00:12:50.046 - 00:13:33.440, Speaker B: I feel that it is important, but at the same time, it's not necessary because the ecosystem is going to really thrive regardless of the noise and what happens externally, because all the volume that goes through our contracts and that's in bullish or bearish times, we feel that we're positioned kind of like an exchange. It's like people are going to use escrow whether it's bullish or bearish. People use an exchange whether it's bullish or bearish. And so we take 80% of the fees when it's paid in swap, and we give that to the stakers, and then 10% goes to a dow and we burn 10%. So it's like the ecosystem always stays very attractive no matter what's happening, no matter what noise is happening. And our charts are all over the place right now. And it's like really fine and relaxing, actually, because I'm enjoying the process, let's just say.
00:13:34.210 - 00:13:50.006, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, we see a lot with Defi right now. And you've talked about nfTs. Where do you see NFTs again, kind of fitting into trustwap. And where do you kind of see this space kind of expanding over the next six months?
00:13:50.108 - 00:14:17.342, Speaker B: Twelve months? Sure. Yeah. I mean, nfts obviously for the launch pad. So we'll have those NFT tickets where you can buy and sell opportunities to win a launch pad participation space, or you can buy and sell the golden ticket, which likely will have more value there. That's essentially probably just where we're going to be sticking on nfTs. I don't think we're really going to expand out much more than that. I think we just really need to double down on what we're already doing.
00:14:17.342 - 00:14:59.994, Speaker B: We're too creative, I would say we need to just execute more. And then NFTs in general, it's certainly been interesting to see their development. I think how engine is doing it is very interesting where these NFTs have real world utility in games, for example, it's like, hey, this NFT is transferable and here's the value that it has within this game or within this ecosystem. Kind of like how trustswap is approaching it. Like there's a, you know, this may be a personal opinion, some people may disagree, but like NFT artwork, I'll take a screenshot. I get there's history behind it for. So I'm really excited for the NFT in form of utility where it actually has value rather than just a story.
00:14:59.994 - 00:15:06.990, Speaker B: I don't know, maybe that's an incorrect or narrow minded viewpoint, but I'm much more excited for the utility.
00:15:07.570 - 00:15:27.090, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's all about the story and definitely can try to duplicate things, but it's never the original. And that's what's kind of interesting about these nfts. And so with trustswap, you guys have gone, you mentioned the hacking audit, and so what's the progress kind of with the audit and everything that you guys are working on?
00:15:27.160 - 00:15:44.906, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. So we already have all the products and services that are live are fully audited. And so we've put the little screenshot of like, hey, audit successful. And Hacken has retweeted that. But then of course, there's people out there that are like, oh, we want to see the full audit. So we're going to be releasing that audit probably within 48 hours.
00:15:44.906 - 00:16:05.460, Speaker B: I'm just waiting to get it back from Adam, our CTO. So we'll push that out there. And then for the escrow services, that audit just came back. So once we patch that up and launch it live, we'll push the audit out, because I think that's important that people can see that this code is audited. Here's the audit. Here were potentially the bugs or vulnerabilities. And, okay, we fixed them.
00:16:05.460 - 00:16:21.240, Speaker B: I think it's important that projects in crypto do get audited and show those audits publicly, because otherwise, what are they hiding? Round one of audits of our software live. Round two completed fixing and launching soon.
00:16:21.610 - 00:16:45.998, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, I know a lot of people will be very excited about that. Kind of curious. What is your take with what you guys are building with Launchpad and this ecosystem within trustwap of this culture of anonymous development? And how is that affect people that use your platform? Because it's all open source, right. So anyone can be able to use it?
00:16:46.084 - 00:17:00.610, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So that's the balance. That's the balance there that we're really working on. So, for example, like our software, anybody can use our software. It's like launching an ERC 20 on Ethereum. Anybody can lock their tokens, anybody can vest investor funds, anybody can use the escrow.
00:17:00.610 - 00:17:24.170, Speaker B: But for the launch pad, that is not open to everybody. We've had over 30 projects apply. We've accepted two. So that's very vetted. And we don't allow anonymous projects just because of the potential risk that may come with that. And then for the, I'm sure a lot of people listening, we just came off this big hatch dow incident. I'm sure people are thinking about it, so I'll just talk about it.
00:17:24.170 - 00:18:02.150, Speaker B: So we're going to be actively working when anonymous projects, or even non anonymous projects are using our software. Going to be a lot more diligent in our pr strategy in not having to announce these things. A lot of feedback we got. When we said, hey, Ethereum allows anybody to mint an ERC, 20 people said, yeah, but they don't make announcements about these projects using the software. And so we said, you know what, that's a valid point. And so we've pivoted our pr and marketing, and we're just going to focus on the software, on the building, and we want to make sure that nobody's losing their shirt. So we're disclaimer rich right now and trying to be a lot more diligent.
00:18:02.650 - 00:18:33.474, Speaker A: Love it. Yeah, no, it's really exciting. And I definitely see a lot of confidence in everything that you guys are doing. And so kind of back to with Chainlink, within the smart swap, where do you see kind of the biggest value? Do you see possibly other people wanting to capture, maybe pay outside of Ethereum? And do you have maybe plans of other kind of tokens that someone could make that payment? Yeah.
00:18:33.512 - 00:19:03.626, Speaker B: Right now our two payment options are in ETH and swap. We may introduce a stable coin option, because for crypto subscriptions, I think that's very relevant. You want to pay in a stable coin and the receiver might want to receive in a stable coin. So that's one thing for sure. And then I think, well, time is one thing. I believe that we're also leveraging because you need an oracle for time. So those are the two main ones right now.
00:19:03.808 - 00:19:22.142, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah. I'm glad you brought up so smart subscriptions, because I think this is something that even probably on your social network, that someone could be wanting to use, like a subscription in the future. Netflix, different things. Do you want to maybe talk about this project that you're working on?
00:19:22.276 - 00:20:09.022, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. So this is one that very, very excited about because I think this is the one that's going to absolutely proliferate, trustswap into the awareness of not only the crypto community, but also the mainstream community as a whole. So crypto subscriptions, essentially, it'll be a little snippet of API that you can paste onto your WordPress website, paste onto your blog, hopefully integrate into Patreon, really anywhere. Like, put it in your newsletter, put it in your subscription, anywhere you can plug it in, and now you can accept crypto for the services you're providing. Because even in the crypto space, there's tons of people who don't accept crypto because they're like, listen, if I'm having a monthly thing, I'm going to have to ask these guys to pay every single month in the emails. And then I'm manually checking, did they pay? Didn't they? So essentially, let's automate that.
00:20:09.022 - 00:20:27.586, Speaker B: Have a full dashboard. Here's what subscriptions you have as a user and then as a service provider. Okay, here are all the people who subscribed. Here's how much time they have left. Here's when they're running out. And then being able to pull that data and integrate it with your own database to say, okay, yes, push the email to these people. Don't push the email to those people.
00:20:27.586 - 00:20:47.914, Speaker B: So that's what we're really working on and I think is really going to take off in a big way in terms of public perception. Is the smart subscriptions because it's a viral thing. Being able to pay in crypto, I think, is very cool and just. It hasn't been done at scale before, so I'm excited to roll that out.
00:20:48.032 - 00:21:13.860, Speaker A: Yeah, no, 100%. And especially, like, the first thing that comes to mind is, like, substack. I feel like I'm subscribed to ten different crypto related substacks. You have to pay with that and dollars using your credit card. So definitely something that's definitely going to become popular. If people want to follow your product roadmap and want to ask questions to your team, what's the best way to. I know you're very active on social media.
00:21:13.860 - 00:21:19.250, Speaker A: Where's the best place to kind of just have a conversation with you and get answers?
00:21:19.910 - 00:21:41.500, Speaker B: I mean, to have a conversation with me, I'd say hit me in telegram. I'm pretty open, so I'll share. It's at Jeff Cordeikis, first name, last name, and then, yes, it's to link in with Trustswap. I believe it's the exact same at Trustwap on Telegram. Our discord is a great place, our twitter is a great place, and all those links are found on trustswap.org. So, yeah, pretty simple. We're always open to.
00:21:46.450 - 00:21:56.858, Speaker A: What else is on your product roadmap. And I guess, is there anything else, maybe that we didn't talk about that you want to say to your audience and fans?
00:21:57.034 - 00:22:41.050, Speaker B: I mean, we have a lot on our product roadmap. So I don't want to make it seem like we're spreading ourselves too thin, but we're knocking one thing off one at a time. But also in the pipeline, we have wrapping as a service, which I'm quite excited about, because then that'll allow, essentially people to take a token on Neo or a token on stellar or whatever chain, wrap it onto Ethereum. And now, not only can they interact with the trustswap contract, use smart subscriptions, the escrow services, they can also interact with the entire Ethereum ecosystem, including metamask and Uniswap. So I think that's a huge value add to be able to really loop Ethereum in at scale and really propel that forward. And then also we're working on our proprietary decks with leverage trading. But again, that's a massive untaking.
00:22:41.050 - 00:22:45.150, Speaker B: So that one's going to take a little while, but it is underway.
00:22:46.610 - 00:22:52.640, Speaker A: Great. And then I guess. Anything else? Is there anything else that maybe we missed that you want to let people know?
00:22:53.250 - 00:22:56.934, Speaker B: I think that's good. I think there was. Is short and sweet, and I appreciate the time. Thank you.
00:22:56.972 - 00:23:02.102, Speaker A: Yeah, no, this is great, Jeff. I'm really excited for everything that you guys are building. And I can't wait to see the future.
00:23:02.236 - 00:23:04.262, Speaker B: Right on. I appreciate a lot, Keenan. Cool.
00:23:04.316 - 00:23:04.690, Speaker A: Thanks, Jeff.
