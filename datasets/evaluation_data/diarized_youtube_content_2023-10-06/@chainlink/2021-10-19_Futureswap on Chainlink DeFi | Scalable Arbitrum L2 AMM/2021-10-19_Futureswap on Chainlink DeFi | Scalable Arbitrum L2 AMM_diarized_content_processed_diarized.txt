00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.200, Speaker A: This community emerged around it, and I was like, oh, these are a tool for community building. That's amazing. And that's what I've seen more than anything, is like they're tools around community building, and then people are building stuff on top of them at this amazing rate.
00:00:13.570 - 00:01:01.440, Speaker B: Yeah, communities and nfts are such like a strong sort of value prop on Ethereum and wider crypto as a whole. And I think that is what's going to drive so many people into this space is because not everyone is interested in finance, but everyone has their favorite band or their favorite artists or whatever, and those artists are ultimately going to be interested in some of this stuff and they're going to bring their fans in. And I think nfts are sort of a medium for just attracting a wider audience. Whether or not you think they're really valuable or you think they're highly speculative, whatever, they're still like an amazing tool that I think we're just scratching the surface on using.
00:01:01.970 - 00:01:18.420, Speaker A: So I am a fan. Fan is the wrong word. But I have a favorite amm that I use, and I have a favorite blockchain that I use. But I'm weird. I've been in this industry for four years, and so I'm one of the weirdo crypto people who has that stuff. Most people aren't going to care. Right.
00:01:18.420 - 00:01:38.060, Speaker A: You use what is efficient. You use what makes the most sense. And so for future swap, for example, you guys want to create brand recognition, you want people to come back and use future swap. But it's a different kind of community than somebody who's just passionate about art or passionate about collectibles. Right? Passionate about using a particular product is a different sort of relationship.
00:01:39.070 - 00:02:13.846, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Our community is so different than a lot of them, but there's a lot of cross pollination going on. And it's really cool to see that, that people are like, we started doing these things called poops, and it just brought in way more attention into our space. And it's cool to see how interested people are in participating and being recognized to participate and then rewarding those individuals that do that. I think that's a super interesting concept that ultimately every defi project will also incorporate nfts to their defi project.
00:02:13.948 - 00:02:29.782, Speaker A: You call them poops. I don't think I've ever heard anybody say it out loud. I've always read it as popes because I like saying pope. I think it's funny and it's spelled like soap. It's P-O-A-P. That's proof of attendance protocol, right? I think protocol, yep. And then you get an NFT.
00:02:29.782 - 00:02:45.918, Speaker A: When you go somewhere somebody verifies, like you attended this event, you get an NFT in a wallet that you submit. So that's a way that you guys have built community is okay. We're having an event, people who show up, you're going to get a poop. That's a particular stamp that you were there. It's like early adopter cred, right?
00:02:46.084 - 00:02:47.140, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:02:48.150 - 00:03:12.534, Speaker A: Well, let's learn a little bit more now that we're all early adopters for being here, we're going to get started with this and learn all about future swap and arbitram and all that stuff. So here we go. It's Chainlink live. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Derek Aliyah from future Swap. Awesome to have you here, man.
00:03:12.534 - 00:03:22.734, Speaker A: We've been talking a little bit nfts, but I really want to dig into the meat of this and learn about future swap. So first, give us the high level. Tell us about futureswap. How does it work? What makes it kind of stand out?
00:03:22.932 - 00:04:16.826, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is our fourth version of future swap. We were the first to launch perpetuals on Ethereum a while back ago, like over a year ago. And so we've had a bunch of iterations. We've learned a lot. And this latest version is on arbitrum, and it leverages uniswap b three under the hood, which is really important. Essentially what future swap does is it allows for perpetuals on anything that's on uniswap v three. And this is a really interesting concept because that means that there's a ton of creative potential that people can just spin up something and work with chain link, and ultimately a price feed can come in and they can spin something up on future swap instantly.
00:04:16.826 - 00:04:30.910, Speaker B: And so we're moving towards this direction of we want to have leverage on any token pair that's on uniswap. That's our goal right now, and we're definitely moving in that direction.
00:04:31.070 - 00:04:49.258, Speaker A: All right, so let's back up a little bit. Tell me about perpetuals. Give us a definition for the audience so we know how they're different from buying a token. That's spot, right? You just buy a token, you hold it. If it goes up, you gain, it rises in value. If it goes down, reduces in value. What are perpetuals? How are they different?
00:04:49.344 - 00:05:30.802, Speaker B: Yeah. So on a high level, what perpetuals allow you to do is have leveraged exposure on an asset. And that's pretty critical, because, say, someone wanted exposure on ETH, but they only had $100. Well, they could use Uniswap or any other trade product to go through spot and buy $100 worth of ETh. Right? But with perpetuals. It essentially is similar to a future, which is I'm going to enter into a contract and it expires at some period of time. I can go long or short, and I have some amount of leverage.
00:05:30.802 - 00:06:22.290, Speaker B: And what that means is that leverage enables you to have more of that asset than you would in spot. So instead of buying $100 worth of ETH, I could buy with my $100, I could buy ten x, I could buy $1,000 worth of ETH or on future swap, it's 26 right now, and it can go much higher. So essentially it allows you to have more exposure. Now, the risk of that is with spot, you're just holding onto this thing, and if it goes down, it goes down. If ETh goes down, you're just like, okay, I'm in the red a little bit with these perpetuals. If it goes down to a certain point, which is called your liquidation point or price, essentially your position is closed for you. And so that puts you at greater risk, but also you have far greater rewards.
00:06:22.290 - 00:06:39.914, Speaker B: So it allows you to take on more leverage on positions or assets that you're interested in. And it also gives you directionality, which is if you think eth is going to go down, you can go short, so you can bet against it. And if you think eth is going to increase in price, you can sort of take on that position.
00:06:40.032 - 00:06:44.362, Speaker A: So if I'm just holding a token on spot, value goes down, I still hold the token.
00:06:44.426 - 00:06:45.402, Speaker B: You're still holding the token.
00:06:45.466 - 00:07:01.646, Speaker A: But for perpetuals, I'm putting the token up as collateral, basically against itself or other collateral in some cases. And then if the position goes down, the value goes down. I'm in danger of losing that collateral. That's the risk, essentially.
00:07:01.758 - 00:07:02.898, Speaker B: That's the risk, yeah.
00:07:02.984 - 00:07:22.634, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So that's just like a different, especially when we kind of look at amms, uniswap and sushiswap and all the different kind of amms that have kind of emerged in defi. That's a real differentiator with future swap that I see is you guys kind of allow these perpetuals on top of the amm, is that right?
00:07:22.752 - 00:07:23.740, Speaker B: That's right.
00:07:25.390 - 00:07:40.958, Speaker A: Cool. So you said you started on ethereum, now you've got it on arbitrum. There's got to be a massive scale and speed differential there. So how does arbitrum really change what you guys are doing and how it works?
00:07:41.124 - 00:08:19.114, Speaker B: Yeah, so arbitrum is, as you know, a scaling solution. And so it just allows us to do a lot more while keeping costs lower. So in this version of future swap, it's built on top of uniswap. So when you do a trade through futureswap, it's also using uniswap under the hood to trade on the spot market. And so to do those two calls would be pretty expensive on l one, not insane, but it would definitely like around double the gas price. And when gas is spiking, that's significant. Yeah.
00:08:19.232 - 00:08:24.974, Speaker A: Your first example is if you've got $100 in eth, and I'm like, dude, that's gas fees sometimes right there.
00:08:25.172 - 00:09:01.546, Speaker B: Yeah. Being able to use arbitrary, we just think you don't have this contract size limit, so you can actually add more features to your contract, to your protocol. And also it's cheaper. So you've got the speed element where it's also instantaneous. So when you do a transaction, instead of waiting however many seconds or sometimes minutes to get, hey, your transaction went through with arbitram, it's instant. You have these instant confirmations. So it's very nice for a trade experience to click a button and a second later it says you're in.
00:09:01.546 - 00:09:39.650, Speaker B: Right. And for it to be like over ten x less in terms of gas fees. So we think that if DFI is going to expand, it needs to expand on something that's cheaper and sort of less friction, especially for this trade experience. So that's why we decided to move over to this l two while keeping all the composability layers. Right. We want to make sure that we can plug into any protocol that wants to build on top of future swap. And that's really key, because being disconnected from the rest of DFI, I think, really limits your potential.
00:09:39.650 - 00:09:46.790, Speaker B: And so future swap v four is really set as a primitive, as an economic primitive.
00:09:47.210 - 00:10:38.994, Speaker A: So let me dig into this for a sec, because usually when I think of an amm, I think of a trading interface. An individual goes on to some trading interface and can use that interface, that front end, to access the smart contracts that Uniswap or sushi or whoever has. But that's not the only thing because it's composable. Another protocol, a yield aggregator, for example, or some other management, fund management sort of thing that's on chain, can go to future swap, essentially get leverage and use that leverage to do trading or yield farming or whatever it happens to be via uniswap v three. So future swap is like the leverage composable layer, right, that these other protocols can use now. That changes the game even more on arbitrage when we're talking about like a layer two solution. Because if I go to make a trade, that's one transaction.
00:10:38.994 - 00:11:03.110, Speaker A: If I go to do leverage and then make a trade, well, that's at least two transactions plus three to get your funds off, right? Because you've got to go back and forth. And now if you're a protocol doing that, you're doing dozens, hundreds, who knows? You're doing them all the time. And so that just really changes the game in terms of cost and efficiency and the ability to build a product that you can even use, let alone potential users.
00:11:03.290 - 00:11:37.734, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we've really lowered the bar in terms of ease of use to use these types of products. So if you go to futureswap.com, you can check out, we've got our live version on Arbitram, and we also have a testnet if you want to play around with it. It's pretty straightforward and the experience is pretty seamless. Obviously, we're working with a lot of teams to make it even better, and we've only been live for less than a week. But congratulations. We're super excited just to make it really seamless.
00:11:37.734 - 00:11:57.010, Speaker B: And then the next sort of part of this is to help developers integrate on top of this layer, like you were talking about. If we're a composable layer on top of Uniswap V three, we want to be sort of another layer so that protocols can develop on top of us. And we think this opens the gates to a lot of different sort of development.
00:11:58.230 - 00:12:15.298, Speaker A: At Chainlink Labs, we talk about the web three stack quite a bit, and chain link is, we see it as this integral part of trying to do this. You want to build things, you kind of need a really secure source of prices, price data, or any other kind of data that you may be using. How are you guys using Chainlink in future swap?
00:12:15.474 - 00:13:12.246, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're using Chainlink as our index price. So what that means is there's the uniswap market price, and then there's the chainlink index price. And we use this for liquidations because the problem that you will have using something like Uniswap is people can go in there and basically manipulate the pool. They can just dump tokens and the pool will change rapidly. And as I said before, with these perpetuals, you have what's called liquidation. And if your liquidation point gets hit, that's a sad event, like you will lose your money, and that's not good. And so to keep users from being able to do that, which is just like scam with users, we use Chainlink so that it's not affected by someone going into the Uniswap pool and moving it around a bunch.
00:13:12.246 - 00:13:24.234, Speaker B: Instead, it's sourcing from Chainlink, which sources from a bunch of reputable sources that pulls in that data, and we use that on chain data for liquidations.
00:13:24.362 - 00:13:51.446, Speaker A: Now, let's clarify. This isn't uniswap only like any single exchange. If you rely on any single exchange for your data, it's the same danger. So if you go to Coinbase and you just use Coinbase's API, same thing. If you go to sushiswap, same thing, right? All of these exchanges, they create a price. And arbitragers usually are like looking between those exchanges to kind of find prices, and that's how they generally stay level. But any single source exchange is vulnerable to that.
00:13:51.446 - 00:14:34.562, Speaker A: I mean, that's fundamentally what Chainlink does, is it applies this aggregation method of literally hundreds of exchanges into dozens of node operators that then work on an aggregate price. So regardless of somebody goes into uniswap or whatever it happens to be, and tanks the price of an asset using a flash loan or something like that, your collateral is reflecting the true market price or as close to we can get as the true market price on chain liquidations happen. Right. That's part of the risk. Like if you have no risk, you're going to get no reward. That's not part of the financial system. But you want to make sure that your liquidations are done using accurate data.
00:14:34.562 - 00:14:38.146, Speaker A: You don't want to get liquidated from a scam or from a manipulator or something like that.
00:14:38.248 - 00:15:42.566, Speaker B: Yeah. And you would use kind of how we see a lot of what Chainlink does is they are, for a lot of the very competitive markets that we're interested in, some of the largest volume markets, you need a very reliable price because those are the ones that are most sought after in terms of targets for manipulation, because there's so much money in there. And so we're super excited to be able to plug into that because Chainlink, we've been working with Chainlink for quite a bit. We were one of the first projects to launch using chain link. Back in April of 2020, we launched and it was on L one, and it was a couple of days of intense fun. And yeah, that was the first experience. But it was clear that, hey, we can sort of use this price to be brought on chain and then use that as this liquidation, and it's only sort of gotten better with these layer twos, and we see it as furthering the development.
00:15:42.566 - 00:15:46.394, Speaker B: It's only going to get better. So I think it's been an awesome experience for us.
00:15:46.512 - 00:15:59.550, Speaker A: Personal question, what's it like building a protocol that's responsible for an insane amount of money from an individual level, a really large amount of money that. Now do you sleep? Is it constant anxiety?
00:16:01.010 - 00:16:34.390, Speaker B: I think there have been versions where it was harder to sleep, but this version, we built it to be economically sound. That was a key factor because we realized a lot of our competitors have these things called insurance funds. Insurance funds have been around for a long time. They're great. But what that does is it centralizes the process of sort of who, hey, let's decide on should we bail out XYZ, right? This event happened. We need to decide to take this money and do this. This is a human in the loop process, essentially.
00:16:34.390 - 00:17:13.670, Speaker B: This is not completely decentralized. And if you're building a protocol that depends on sort of composability and you need, what if someone was like, you know what, we're actually going to stop your trade because something came up and we're not going. You would be furious at uniswap, right? You expect to always, for it to always happen. And so future swap was built to be economically secure, so it doesn't need this insurance fund. It will always work regardless. And so this was something that was created in mind when we started this thing. And so it's much easier to sleep at night knowing it's economically secure.
00:17:14.090 - 00:17:50.980, Speaker A: Yeah, decentralization, it's not just a philosophy for enlightenment, it's a security measure. That's why you use multiple sources. So there's not this centralization risk. And the industry is working hard. I see it across the industry, across chains, across protocols, at try to decentralize more where you can decentralize, whether it's protocol level stuff, blockchain, adding more nodes, or data using chain link feed that has all these multiple sources. Governance, or just throw centralized governance and decision making out. That's a really interesting process, but it's hard.
00:17:51.350 - 00:18:09.874, Speaker B: Decentralization is like 1020 x harder. And a lot of people come into the space wanting to take the tools that they know, the hammer they know because that's what they're used to and they want to apply it to this field, and oftentimes it's sort of the wrong approach.
00:18:09.922 - 00:18:10.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:10.172 - 00:18:37.794, Speaker B: That is not decentralization. Decentralization is really hard and it requires a different mindset. And I think a lot of people when they come into the space, they're just like, oh, I can just do all this stuff. And then they try to do it and they realize it breaks and there's cracks and it's gameable and all these things. And then they try to build it in a decentralized way and they realize, oh, man, you need all these different components. And even we tried building sort of oracles, and it's a really hard problem. We did it.
00:18:37.794 - 00:19:01.658, Speaker B: We realized after we did it, we were like, okay, we have this, or we could use chain link. And we went with Chainlink because it's what you guys focus on and it's what you do and you've done it consistently well. So I think it's pretty hard for new people coming in the space just to get up to speed. There's definitely an upgrade process.
00:19:01.824 - 00:19:36.420, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Synthetics came from synthetics talks about that is like they had oracles for a long time. They were like, why are we maintaining oracles? Why? We just focus on what we want to build and let this technology. Who focuses on that? Do you know, over the past year, two years now? Yeah, man, year and a half, really cooked. Uniswap set the bar really high with amms. They've got a new version that's out as well, this whole sushi swap, and then there's tons of others as well. Really interesting design space and product space.
00:19:36.420 - 00:19:57.820, Speaker A: Now you guys are kind of building a layer on top of that as well, tapping into composability. Is this a trend going forward? Is this like we see chatter about DFI 2.0? I'm not sure what that means yet, but do amms have more to go with? Sort of these composable layers, perpetuals, and is there other stuff as well that's coming? What's the industry looking like?
00:20:00.190 - 00:20:40.120, Speaker B: I think amms have evolved so much and there's been so much experimentation and also so much money in it. We've seen all the different amms pop up on all the different chains, sort of trying to be unique and different, and it's surprising how little time it's been. It's only been like a year ish and a half since they really got battle tested. And you see the innovation. I think Uniswap's concentrated liquidity is not a new idea. I think Kyber actually sort of had a version of this and then Uniswap really took it to the next level. And I suspect there will be more.
00:20:40.120 - 00:21:21.270, Speaker B: Know, Sushi's got its own stuff they're working on. There's some other amms working on them. But I think what will be interesting is even more integrations. I know that future swap sort of unlocks leverage on any amm on Uniswap. And with that I think you'll start to see a lot more product built on top of this. Because if you look at amms and what was enabled by them, which is a lot of yield farming, a lot of different urine like projects. So like treasury management or just like fund management, sort of amms were core to that and being able to swap things and give out yield.
00:21:21.270 - 00:21:54.206, Speaker B: And now I think what we're going to see is something like future swap is built and you're going to have all these different. The next generation of yield farms, the next generation of dows or nfts or whatever building on top of some of this stuff. And I think there's going to be a lot of innovation in terms of amms going forward. And they might start to look like order books in some ways, but in other ways, I think the goal is to be as composable as possible. So we'll see sort of where that.
00:21:54.228 - 00:22:41.214, Speaker A: Balance is as a tool, just fundamentally liquidity provision, LPG as a tool for whatever the rate is. If there's use on an amm, if there's trading fees of some kind, that's a revenue option for some organization or person or whatever it is to be a liquidity provider. And so that alone makes it a valuable proposition in like, that's one of these core things now in Defi. And now we got smart contracts and lending and good price feeds. Okay, well, now you can add that perpetuals or lending or whatever it happens to be. Those two things together you can mix and match in so many ways. Start adding value propositions or investments like regenerative funding or social good impact sorts of things, or only financial products or art.
00:22:41.214 - 00:23:07.662, Speaker A: Right? Bring nfts into this and all of a sudden the design space is just massive. So I'm with you. I'm looking forward to kind of seeing what people start building on top of each other. Oh, hackathons are coming up, man. I love hackathons watching those. What do you have coming up on the roadmap for the next few weeks? I know you guys just launched, so I'm sorry to ask you for a roadmap as soon as you launch, but weeks out, months out, kind of what are we looking at? Just give us a little overview.
00:23:07.826 - 00:23:49.318, Speaker B: Yeah. So for us, there's now a big focus on getting the trade experience just really dialed in and making sure that future swap is as easy as possible. We're working with some teams on doing their own front end for future swap. So very interested in that and supporting them in creating more versions of this. The next big push for us is just more pairs. So we're going to open up more of governance so people can vote on which pair they want to add in and sort of set up rewards around this. So there's liquidity in those pools that people can get started trading on the pairs they want.
00:23:49.318 - 00:24:08.646, Speaker B: And so expanding to more pairs is certainly key to this next phase of post launch. Hey, let's get as many pairs in here and let's see sort of more activity and see what people can build in terms of developing on top of future swap with all these pairs.
00:24:08.838 - 00:24:26.798, Speaker A: Cool. Well, if you're talking about more pairs, you're talking about more chain link price feeds. So maybe we'll talk again in the future. Dude, it's been awesome getting to know you. Get to know future swap talked a lot about arbitrum. If anybody wants to join your communities, they should be all linked down below in the description. So there's twitters, there's blogs.
