00:00:02.570 - 00:00:51.920, Speaker A: Hello everybody, I'm Ernesto Boado. I'm from BD Labs. BD Labs is a contributor to the Abbey protocol, like at the moment. But a group of Defi developers like blockchain in general. And well, today I was invited by our, our friends of Chainlink like to smart and as Chainlink is about connection and so on. So I decided to talk a bit, as is also related with our projects in BD and in the. I like to talk about the interconnection, like cross chain communication and some kind of funny analogy to start with.
00:00:51.920 - 00:02:05.530, Speaker A: As I think almost everybody knows, blockchain at the current moment is quite interconnected. Like, there is multiple types of networks, environments. Ones have some type of technology, some others have other type of technology. And there is kind of a mystery of this evolution. And to arrive to the current point, which is, well, initially, blockchains are designed to be a bit isolated and quite puristic, let's say pretty soon, applications that are leaving the blockchain start to require external data or more processed data that is not doable to have, like in the blockchain execution environment itself. So these new execution environments appear, which are in the shape of side chains, roll up the optimistic ck and way more that are appearing every day. And obviously, as soon as this happens, you start to require to connect these different environments.
00:02:05.530 - 00:02:49.460, Speaker A: This is kind of like general picture. It applies for blockchains, for protocols, for applications. Abe is no exception of it. For the presentation, I try to make a bit of an analogy. Like, I'm quite a big fan of science fiction, like astrophysics, the universe and so on. So I think that the blockchain world and the tech world actually can be a good comparison with that field, too. I start with what I call the universe of tech.
00:02:49.460 - 00:03:58.550, Speaker A: And from a bit of centric perspective of blockchain, we can see that there is this planetary system, or galaxy like, of web3, the blockchain world. And then you have also what we call the web two world, which is basically like the whole Tech, like a traditional. And then you have other movements, like it could be AI, it could be all these things that they are appearing every day in the innovation field. If we zoom in a bit, we just go to the web3, let's say planetary system. And here we have all the environments that I described before, which in my analogy are like the planets. So you have Ethereum, we have polygon, you have optimism, arbitrum, all the roll ups nowadays, countless of them. So we go back to Abenao.
00:03:58.550 - 00:05:03.242, Speaker A: And this applies to almost any protocol or application layer that is called and above ellipse, like multiple of these planets. It started with one, then it expanded. And nowadays, as you can see, it's just around now. There is one thing that for those of you who are familiar with astrophysics and so on, it's called the Kardashian scale. So this is like a measure of civilization in terms of the universe, to simplify. And then it's just some introduction, it divides, let's say galactic civilizations, like in three types, a bit more depends on where you look at, but mainly in three types. And this depends on how each civilization in their development stage gathers energy, right? So you have the type ones, which are those that live in a single planet and control the energy of that planet.
00:05:03.242 - 00:06:10.210, Speaker A: Type two, which is when this civilization expands, and type three, when it's like universal scale and super powerful, like civilizations. So how this is related, like, it seems a bit out of the blue, right? So I created this other concept that I call the blockchain scale of applications in parallel. And to explain how a protocol or application like Abbey actually follows a pretty similar pattern, like as galactic civilization in a different scale, of course. So how this works, we have like type one applications, type one defi protocols, or almost any type of protocol, which are those that living in a single planet, let's say, which is in this case a single network. So which are the characteristics of these applications? Or what is in the case of Ave. So Ave started on Ethereum, a DeFi liquidity protocol. I think everybody is familiar, where people can deposit funds, borrow against those tokens and so on.
00:06:10.210 - 00:07:07.030, Speaker A: There is a governance system too, which is quite big at the moment. There is a safety model, there is multiple sub technologies, but everything was in type one, lives in one planet. So usually it's Ethereum. Not anymore. Well, the reflection of this is like the Ethereum above two market, which was created like already I think two years ago. And yeah, at the beginning it was only there. Now there is another intermediate stage, which is the late type ones applications, which is when you are in a single network, but you start like expansion efforts, right? So this is what happens with Abbey, which after Ethereum decided to go to Polygon and to avalanche with the version two of the protocol.
00:07:07.030 - 00:07:47.938, Speaker A: Those networks are back in the days they were like in early stage. And it's more about, okay, how it works, the application there, does it have potential? How is the user base and so on? And this happened like almost one and a half years ago or something like that. Yeah, the reflection is like the Polygon b two market avalanche. B two market of Abe type two civilizations. If you remember what I mentioned before. Is the multiplanetary in the galactic scale. So this is when already the protocol or the application.
00:07:47.938 - 00:08:11.414, Speaker A: Like Abe. Already expanded to multiple places. Which are proven already. And this is more or less systematic. So characteristics is that Abe in this case has reached really important maturity. We are talking about the ABV three already version, which is the current version. And it lives in all these different planets.
00:08:11.414 - 00:08:33.934, Speaker A: Which means that it is deployed on these different blockchain networks. So another characteristic is. Well, this systematic expansion. Like procedures of expansion of colonization. Are quite well defined. Generally the expansion is just by replication. So basically, double protocol, the one that runs on Ethereum.
00:08:33.934 - 00:09:03.562, Speaker A: Gets deployed on the others in a pretty similar manner. And there is already, of course, communication between these networks. But this communication is slightly rudimentary, let's say. So mainly like unidirectional, for example, for the governance of Abe on Ethereum. To pass decisions to the other networks. And control the multiplanetary system. Well, the result is this.
00:09:03.562 - 00:09:19.520, Speaker A: Which is kind of current result. On where ABba lives. In multiple networks. Like Ethereum, polygon avalanche. Like a lot of them, they are completely different compared with each other. And the procedure, like it just scales. Right.
00:09:19.520 - 00:09:55.850, Speaker A: So, next phase, and this is the current state, actually not type two, which is the lay type two characteristics of this stage is that it's a bit more technical. So Abe is multichain by design. What that means is that it's not exactly expansion by replication. Is that the new systems that are created around Abe. Are designed with multi chain in. Like it's not anymore limited. Like a defi design.
00:09:55.850 - 00:10:25.254, Speaker A: Like to what Ethereum allows you to do. But you already think like, okay, on roll ups we can do something different on side chains. There is these other limitations and so on. At the same time, there is quite important internal evolution of the civilization, let's say. So it's not that you solve all the problems on the initial planet. But you come up with new things. So like go.
00:10:25.254 - 00:10:49.770, Speaker A: Stablecoin is a clear example. That was introduced just now. Another characteristic is that the communication starts to be bi directional. Because when you are at such high scale. You really need to communicate between all your different environments. And some that is quite important. But usually pretty hidden for the general public.
00:10:49.770 - 00:11:34.726, Speaker A: Is that the infrastructure of the protocol and application gets really mature. For example, from ped labs. That is one we had quite a lot of focus last year and a half on really put to this level. Like the infrastructure of dabi protocol like Dabidao, and so on and so forth. The examples of the current stage of this multichain approach by design. Is Dabi governance b three, that we develop from bed, which is like a governance system on where it's already like we have models. So validation happens on Ethereum, while voting happens on other environments.
00:11:34.726 - 00:12:13.794, Speaker A: And all these environments communicate between each other in a pretty seamless way. By using mechanisms like Chlin, CCIP. Other examples are like the steel internal evolution of the civilization of the application. Like the most clear example is the go stable coin by other companies. Which just expands the universal reach of a protocol like Ave now, which is the future. So type three civilization. If you remember, it was like the galactic empires.
00:12:13.794 - 00:12:37.294, Speaker A: Let's say that they can harness the energy of the universe. We are not there yet, or so I think. But I think that how it looks at the moment. Is that more multi chain interconnection is pretty clear. New and innovative systems. That means that the go stablecoin will not be the only. Most probably.
00:12:37.294 - 00:13:13.114, Speaker A: So Abe should expand to other realms, let's say. Then most probably there will be more and more customization, depending on the environment. If you remember what I mentioned before, like replication. And is a really important part of the strategy of Abe. But more and more I think that during the next one or two years, we will see more customization. Because the environments are completely different some cases. And one that is really important is that we will start probably looking outside of web3 world.
00:13:13.114 - 00:13:34.158, Speaker A: And focus in some other fields. Now, this doesn't come without challenges. Like the changing of scale. So while you try to span. You still have a lot of developments inside. This is challenging, because you need to keep the rhythm. Avid doesn't live alone on all these planets.
00:13:34.158 - 00:14:11.054, Speaker A: So you are competing with other protocols and with other ideas. And of course, whenever you change from one planet to another, or between galaxies. The languages are pretty different between those. So it can be technical languages, but it can be also like talking with institutions. Like when you enter into realms like the capital markets and so on. And well, as we are here, thanks to the amazing thing of Chainlink. All these things will not be so possible, or not so easy.
00:14:11.054 - 00:14:33.130, Speaker A: At least without all the effort we did together. And examples like Abe using price oracles, proof of reserve automation, CCIP. And so I think that it's just the beginning of the road for a protocol like Abe. And welcome to Abe Interconnect.
