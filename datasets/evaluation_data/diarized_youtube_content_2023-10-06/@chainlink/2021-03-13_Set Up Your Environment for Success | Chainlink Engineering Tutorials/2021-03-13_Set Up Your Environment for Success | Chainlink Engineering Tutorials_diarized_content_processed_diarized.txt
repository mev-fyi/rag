00:00:00.250 - 00:00:23.040, Speaker A: Welcome to the Chainlink Engineering tutorials. This is going to be a very short video to explain to you how to use these videos where you can go for resources and what to expect. These tutorials and walkthroughs will give you the tools to be some of the best smart contract engineers out there. They'll go over a little bit of solidity in blockchain, working with off chain data, and just overall empowering your smart contracts to go to the next level.
00:00:28.970 - 00:01:01.230, Speaker B: Due to this bleeding edge technology moving so fast. Always be sure that when you click on one of our technical videos, you scroll down to the description and check for any updates. That way you'll know you're always up to date. You'll want to download and install an Ethereum wallet. Currently one of the most popular is Metamask, and it'll just be an icon in your browser. To get started, we'll hit download install metamask for Brave or whatever browser that you're using. Add to brave, add extension, or again, if you're using Chrome, it'll say add to Chrome or Firefox.
00:01:03.170 - 00:01:03.778, Speaker A: And we're going.
00:01:03.784 - 00:01:33.318, Speaker B: To go ahead and get started. We want to create a new wallet. We'll give metamask feedback, create a password, and we'll need to backup our secret phrase, aka our private key. Your secret phrase is what gives you access to your wallet. Here, for our demos, we're only going to be working with testnet tokens, aka funny money or fake money. That's great for testing, but doesn't have any real value. If you ever want to send this wallet actual Ethereum or actual money, be sure to back this up in several places.
00:01:33.318 - 00:02:09.662, Speaker B: Use it in a password manager or keep your mnemonic and private keys someplace very safe. If you lose access to this private key or mnemonic, or somebody else gets access, your account is now compromised and you will not be able to get back in. Since we're only going to be testing, we'll hit remind me later, but if you actually want to use it, you need to back it up. We can see Metamask has popped up as a browser extension. We'll be working a lot with Testlink and test Ethereum to get different test links. We can go to the chainlink faucets. A unique address is located here and we can copy it to our clipboard and put it into one of our faucet addresses.
00:02:09.662 - 00:02:35.754, Speaker B: Coven is the name of one of the testnets that we'll be working with. You can see there are many different networks, ethereum, mainnet is the one where real money is. The rest of these are tests or fake. You can add more real networks and fake networks by using the custom Ropc. Let's go ahead and request some fake chainlink on the coven testnet. Send me 100 test link to see it in our wallet we have to add the token. Each network has a different address that we need to get the token.
00:02:35.754 - 00:03:19.334, Speaker B: To get the address on the different networks we can go to the chainlink documentation to work with Coven. We can grab the address here. So in metamask for coven to see our 100 testnet link that we just got, we'll hit add token, custom token, and add the contract here. Next add token and now we can see our 100 link. Different tutorials will use different testnets, so be sure to reference this page if they're working with a testnet or a network that you're not familiar with. It's useful, but not required to have working knowledge of JavaScript, Python, or some other object oriented programming language. Eventually you'll learn how to make the switch from remix to your own code editor.
00:03:19.334 - 00:03:24.446, Speaker B: We use visual studio code in a lot of our examples. There's a link in the description to download it, and if you ever get.
00:03:24.468 - 00:04:02.260, Speaker A: Lost or confused, you can always jump into the documentation. Check out some of our technical blogs, check out some of our technical videos, ask a question on stack overflow, or join the discord. The discord is where the majority of the smart contract engineers gather and is an incredibly welcoming place for technical thoughts, questions, brainstorming, and troubleshooting. So if you ever get lost, feel free to jump in and ask a question. The Chainlink Discord is also where you'll meet some of the brightest people in the smart contract space, building the next generation of tools, and is a great place to meet some friends in the space. So have your browser and code editor ready and be prepared to jump in and learn about smart contracts and getting data. Talk to you soon.
