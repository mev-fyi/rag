00:00:09.050 - 00:00:59.870, Speaker A: So running scripts is great, but what if I don't want to have to code an entire script to do some things? What if I want to just tinker around with the blockchain? Well, Hardhat comes packed with this thing called the console. The console is a Javascript environment for us to run Javascript commands to interact with any blockchain. We can jump into the console by running yarn hardhat console, and then whatever network flag if we want to work on Rinkby, Mainnet, Polygon, avalanche, et cetera, network localhost. And now we're dropped into a shell here. In this shell we can do everything that we do in a deploy script, and we don't even have to run these imports because everything with Hardhat is automatically imported into our console. So for example, let's say I wanted to get a simple storage contract factory. Well, I could run exactly this line here.
00:00:59.940 - 00:01:14.706, Speaker B: I could say const simple storage factory equals await ethers, get contract factory of simple storage. And now I can go ahead and.
00:01:14.728 - 00:01:16.194, Speaker A: Even deploy this so I can even.
00:01:16.232 - 00:01:19.606, Speaker B: Just copy this line, paste it, and.
00:01:19.628 - 00:01:25.942, Speaker A: If we flip back to our node, we'll see that we just deployed another simple storage. And now I can do things like.
00:01:25.996 - 00:01:32.986, Speaker B: Await simplestorage retrieve, and I get the.
00:01:33.008 - 00:01:39.418, Speaker A: Return value, which is going to be a big number with a value of zero. I can also make transactions so I.
00:01:39.424 - 00:01:45.760, Speaker B: Can do a weight simplestorage store. Let's do 55.
00:01:47.650 - 00:02:00.866, Speaker A: If I hit up twice, I can go back to the simplestorage retrieve, call that function, and I can see my big number has a value of 55. Now this is a great way to quickly interact with any blockchain that we want. Now you can exit the shell by.
00:02:00.888 - 00:02:03.826, Speaker B: Hitting ctrl c twice to get out.
00:02:03.928 - 00:02:33.070, Speaker A: Or you can also trash can your terminal if you get confused. This console works with any network. We can even do yarn hardhat console network hard hat, and we'll get dropped into a hardhat network. Now this is not going to be the same node that's running here. This is going to be one that only runs for the duration of this command. So whenever we cancel this command, this hard hat network gets canceled. We can close out of that too.
00:02:33.070 - 00:02:47.630, Speaker A: We can also do yarn hardhap console network Rink B, Rinkbee or Polygon or Testnet or Mainnet or whatever we want. And we can do things like ethers.
00:02:48.210 - 00:02:51.610, Speaker B: Provider, we can do things like await.
00:02:51.690 - 00:03:07.970, Speaker A: Ethers provider, get block the block number of Rinkbee. We can also deploy contracts, we can update contracts, we can do anything that we want. You can do anything in these consoles, and they're great ways to quickly test and tinker and interact with contracts.
