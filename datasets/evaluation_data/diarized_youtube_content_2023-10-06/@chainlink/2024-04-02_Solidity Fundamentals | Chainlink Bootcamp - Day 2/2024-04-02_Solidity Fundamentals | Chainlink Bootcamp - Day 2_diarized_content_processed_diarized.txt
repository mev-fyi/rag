00:00:01.720 - 00:00:04.914, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Hello, Para, how are you?
00:00:05.734 - 00:00:07.874, Speaker B: Hey, Solange. I'm doing great.
00:00:08.734 - 00:00:09.270, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:09.342 - 00:00:10.914, Speaker B: How are you doing? Thank you.
00:00:11.414 - 00:00:26.234, Speaker A: So good. So I think our students didn't know you yet, and you are with us all the ten days of the boot camp. So today it's a great day to you. Introduce yourself to our students.
00:00:26.994 - 00:00:43.090, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely silans. Thank you for that. Hey, guys, great to see everybody here. I think I'm seeing a lot of people joining us. I think we already have 250 people. Hello to everybody. Like, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everybody joining from different parts of the world.
00:00:43.090 - 00:01:09.364, Speaker B: Great to see all of you here. So I'm Bharat. I work at Chainlink Labs as a community manager for India. So I manage the indian community for Chainlink, where we help developers learn more about Chainlink and, you know, use it in the Dapps. So that's my role. And I also manage a lot of other community management related stuff. Helping out developers on discords, telegrams and everything that you see on the social media channels.
00:01:09.364 - 00:01:24.504, Speaker B: So if you have any problem facing any issues, you can join our discord and post your questions. Our community team. And also I'll be helping you out with all the queries that you might have. So, yeah, that's what I do at chaining labs lunch. And, yeah, I wanted to pass it on you.
00:01:24.804 - 00:01:45.840, Speaker A: Oh, amazing. So, bara, I know that maybe we have a problem now. I'm not sure if everyone is good with the video now because we have some problems with the comments in exactly this moment. It seems that we have the people over there. Yeah, yeah, I think.
00:01:45.952 - 00:01:56.336, Speaker B: I think everybody can hear us. Guys, if you can hear us, like, you just share thumbs up on in the chat so that we can understand, like, you can hear us here really well.
00:01:56.520 - 00:02:10.684, Speaker A: Okay, so it's good. Okay, let's see, related to the comments. So I will take you off the stage and then I'm starting my presentation. Okay, see you later. See you soon. Thank you. Bye.
00:02:10.684 - 00:02:41.044, Speaker A: So it is. Today is the session number two. And today is the day that you will create your first smart contract. And we are doing this together. So before that, I will talk a bit about the solidity fundamentals. And after that we can really do everything. So let's share my screen.
00:02:41.044 - 00:03:15.024, Speaker A: So here we are. Let's understand a bit of solidity, a bit of smart content. Solidity is the language that we use to program to create the smart content. So we are creating today the solidity part. You learn it directly inside the smart contents. Meanwhile, we are creating them. But let's understand first what is a smart contract.
00:03:15.024 - 00:03:37.056, Speaker A: And before that I'm here. Maybe some of you already know me because of past bootcamps and workshop. You can call me Sol. My name is Soleil Gairos. I am a developer advocate at chaining clubs. So I teach developers how to use auto training services. And I love to travel.
00:03:37.056 - 00:04:18.900, Speaker A: So I love to do in person workshops. I used to go to a conference around the world. And also I really love the beginners. Like this session today, I'm not seeing the shine in your eyes, but it's for me so amazing when I can really realize that you are creating our first smart content. These are my social networks. I used to post all the news and all the upcoming bootcamps and workshops on my twitter. And the past events that I did are on my website.
00:04:18.900 - 00:04:49.924, Speaker A: Okay. And let's go here a bit. Like you can see that we have events in English, Spanish, Portuguese and a lot of them. So be fun after that. So here we are. We know that yesterday the pad was terrible. Yes, this is a good problem because we must find a new way to interact with you.
00:04:49.924 - 00:05:14.684, Speaker A: And the pad doesn't support the amount of people that we have. This is not a problem. We will find another way to do this. Today we are doing some experiments with this. Okay, so let's go. I'd like to know what's happened just now. Let's go over that.
00:05:14.684 - 00:05:39.284, Speaker A: Yeah, we have some people here. Welcome. Sagar, Bangladesh. Wow. And Chaguan, let's add myself as well. I am from so Paulo. And you know that we must be a bit careful with the pad.
00:05:39.284 - 00:05:58.316, Speaker A: It's so easy to delete everything like I did. Now I just cut Hank in the middle. Sorry, Hank, you are dangerous down. I can put you here. And yes, we have a lot of people over there. And you starting. Someone is starting the middle.
00:05:58.316 - 00:06:26.780, Speaker A: I know that this is like not so easy now, but we have other ways to do this later. This is only to breaking the ice to have the people here. And doesn't matter if you have problems now. But Carlos, go down. Not here. In the beginning it's our introduction. And here.
00:06:26.780 - 00:07:07.860, Speaker A: Yeah, the people are around. No problem. We know that it will be a mess again. Yeah. And they translate to also this is crazy with us, but it's only to you to come here. Yes, one more minute. Hey.
00:07:07.860 - 00:07:30.634, Speaker A: Hey. Okay, let's go. Let's move forward. And yes, the people can add the comments in the chat. I think it's only us that I should just see your comment comments in other places. And I can't. So I will go to both places today.
00:07:30.634 - 00:08:00.994, Speaker A: Let's go. So here we are. Let's talk about smart contents. What is this? So I used to say that smart contracts, they are not smart. They are not contracts. Smart contracts are computer problems that are published and executed in a blockchain environment. Remember that yesterday you already understood that a blockchain environment is immutable.
00:08:00.994 - 00:08:43.632, Speaker A: We have transactions over there. After the transaction was confirmed in a block we didn't have. After that, you cannot change your transaction anymore because we have other blocks and we must have the consensus of everything. So it will be. And this is so we can say that after you publish your dismayed content inside the blockchain, it's immutable. You cannot change the code anymore. But imagine that inside your content, you create some function to change information and information that you have over there.
00:08:43.632 - 00:09:34.236, Speaker A: Yes, you can change information, you can update it information, but you can't update the code. Okay? Yeah. And we know that the pad maybe not work to everyone now. And this is only like choose to play a bit, but we know that we have other ways to work today. Wait to understand this better. So what about smart content? What module can be useful to you? The smart contacts, they are autonomously, but this is when they are triggered, when they are colored. It means that if you call a function inside this match contact, everything that is defined in the function will be executed.
00:09:34.236 - 00:10:13.822, Speaker A: You cannot stop in the middle, you cannot change nothing, but you must call the function. Because of this, we used to say that they must, they are not self executed, but they execute everything that is defined. Okay. And also, when you start something that smart contents, we have no intermediaries. No one can stop your smart contracts after it's in the blockchain. This can be good or this can be bad. Imagine that you have as much content with some error there.
00:10:13.822 - 00:10:59.890, Speaker A: You be over there. And in the past we have a lot of smart contracts and decentralized applications that was hacked because a host inside the smart contents. So be careful with this. We used to say that to have some auditing or smart contract is so important. And also I used to say that if I spend like one day to create as much content, I will spend five more days testing it. Because I must test every possibility that I can imaginate and the others that I can't imaginate. We must test everything to be sure that nothing is wrong.
00:10:59.890 - 00:11:59.774, Speaker A: Because after you publish the ismatic content, you cannot change it. So be careful about that. Okay. So is this. These are smart, concrete and I used to say that the smart contents will solve the problems that we have in the society related to trust. Because when we are trusting, like on paper guarantees, like brand like contracts, this is a bit hard, because first of all, we have some intermediary in the middle and you don't have transparency on that. The risk related to this counterparty can be high.
00:11:59.774 - 00:12:43.596, Speaker A: So if you have smart contracts, we are talking about cryptographic guarantees. So we are based on math. And in this way we can say that we are trusting in the cryptography. We have the cryptographic true. And is this related to smart contracts? Before go to the practical way, let's talk a bit more about yesterday. So I know that you really would like to get these slides. And this isn't the moment that you have the slides, so let's copy this for you.
00:12:43.596 - 00:13:48.242, Speaker A: But this is the presentation. Here we have the slides for you. And I will give you a minute to read this QR code. Yes, I think you are good. And remember that yesterday our instructors, Robert, Roberto and Hishat told you that we have tasks. So in order to receive a certificate at the end of the two weeks, the ten sessions, you must do some tasks, like 20 tasks, a lot of smart contracts that you will deploy in different chains. And all of these tasks will be inside a form.
00:13:48.242 - 00:14:19.676, Speaker A: So this is the way that we can check it out. And this is the form. Before that, let's see if I can share with you the presentation. I think you already got it. Are you adding the beginning of the bed as well? Let's see what's happened in the bed. It seems that survived a bit, not too much, but I think we are surviving. So these are the presentation.
00:14:19.676 - 00:14:47.144, Speaker A: And here we have from yesterday and from today. Okay, we have everything here, the agenda, everything that you learned yesterday. Okay. And now we have the task for me. So, the bootcamp you finish on April 12. But we know that some people are doing the sessions later. Maybe you need more time.
00:14:47.144 - 00:15:22.908, Speaker A: So we have until April 30 to finish out the tasks. Okay. And this is the task form. I will share here with you as well. Here we are not easy yet. Okay. And I will go to this form and I will start with you filling the fun to understand what you should have.
00:15:22.908 - 00:16:02.920, Speaker A: So I have the fun opened here. Okay. If I go to that, I open exactly the same. Here we are. Let's do this big and you can come back to this farm every day to fill the tasks that we have in that day. Like, if you go here, you can see that we have a lot of tasks that you didn't learn yet, but what do you learn to do? Like yesterday, you create your first smart your wallet and fund your wallet. Create a second account, digital transfer.
00:16:02.920 - 00:16:38.016, Speaker A: Today we are creating two smart contracts. One is called register. The other is called register access. Tomorrow you will do a token, let's create a token and a token shop. Then in the session four, we are doing CCIP. We are talking about interoperability and we are transferring USDC from one chain to another chain. After that.
00:16:38.016 - 00:17:38.814, Speaker A: Next week you are creating an NFT that will be a flower and also another NFT that you be cross chain as well using CCIP. Also we are creating a game called runners. And in the almost the last session of the bootcamp, in the session number nine, we are creating as much context to interact with the weather, to get information from the weather and use it inside our ismatic content. So this is everything that we have. Okay, doesn't matter. They used to be mail we are talking about. The only thing that is important to you is to use the same email every day that you fill in this for me.
00:17:38.814 - 00:18:00.014, Speaker A: Okay? For example, this is my email. I affiliate it here. This is the address that I'd like to receive the certificate. And maybe I have a mainnet access. Mainnet address that is not the address that I'm using with you. And I'd like to use that. So let's fill some address over there.
00:18:00.014 - 00:18:54.244, Speaker A: So this is the address that I'd like to receive. The certificate can be different from the address that I'm using now to do the bootcamp. And imagine that I have this order that I created yesterday with you when I installed my metamask. And here probably you fund your wallet in some way. How can I find the transaction that I funded my wallet? Let's see, can be here, I think can I prefer to do in the order I have deforming the incognito mode. This is not a problem. But yesterday we you learned about the iteriscal sepolia.
00:18:54.244 - 00:19:28.940, Speaker A: Here we are. So if you need this, we have this here as well. Data is if I search for my address here. Here is my address. And you can see for example that here I received it was not from yesterday. Okay. But I received some it on my account.
00:19:28.940 - 00:20:07.464, Speaker A: So this is the transaction hash that I should add over there. It's a transaction hash where you are receiving some it on Sepolia inside your account. Okay, let's add over there. This is my transaction hash. And these are the files. These are the blockchain, the sepolia block explorer. And this, remember that after this you create a second account and transfer from one account to another account.
00:20:07.464 - 00:20:43.274, Speaker A: And here you are adding the transaction hash as well. Okay, today we are doing this part. We are creating two way smart content. And every day you come back here and fill the new tasks using. Remember that you must use the same email. Okay, I think I'm ready to go forward with you. And I know that probably some of you have problems yesterday with the faucet.
00:20:43.274 - 00:21:11.710, Speaker A: And yes, it's a lot of people, this can happen. But how can we solve that? We have a workshop faucet. I don't have too much it over there yet, but I have here some it some link. Today we are not using the link yet. We are using soon. Tomorrow we are using link tomorrow session four. But today we are using it.
00:21:11.710 - 00:21:41.534, Speaker A: So my faucet allow, this is the workshop faucet. This allow you to get 0.5. If you already have it, don't get it now, please. If you don't have it, you can try to get less to have more people because this will be only for 160 people. So let's try to help our friends now. Okay, I'm sharing this information with you just now. This is the workshop faucet.
00:21:41.534 - 00:22:10.444, Speaker A: Let's refresh my pets. Yes, I'm not only remix yet. Exactly. So here we are. This is the workshop faucet. I feel this again because it's better to use the order that we have the small one. Okay, and this is the faucet.
00:22:10.444 - 00:22:42.924, Speaker A: You need a password to this faucet. So please don't add the password in the YouTube chat. Let's use the password only here. And I'm sharing this password with you probably after the bootcamp we are changing the password. Okay, this password will not be forever. And if you can't get tokens inside this workshop file set, try the official file set. Okay.
00:22:42.924 - 00:23:05.238, Speaker A: And this is. And I don't need the remix yet. This is the password. Now with this password you can go here. And now you can get a bit. Try to get less, try to get 0.1. It's enough to you, okay.
00:23:05.238 - 00:23:36.974, Speaker A: And you don't need link now, you only need this. So get 0.1 sepolia eight. Okay? Yes. The password is in the pad line, 27 is the password. Okay, it's here. The password is in the pad lining 27.
00:23:36.974 - 00:24:11.414, Speaker A: Get the password here. Let's wait a minute for you. Okay. Yes. And by the way. Oh, why? Did something wrong with the other screen? Wait a minute. Yes, I'm ready with you.
00:24:11.414 - 00:24:31.906, Speaker A: And by the way, I didn't. I forgot to do something inside my. My task farm. Remember that I started my farm. So if I came until the end, I can submit my farm. So let's submit my farm. Now is.
00:24:31.906 - 00:25:03.694, Speaker A: Then I can edit later. Now it's good. So would. And for example, I'd like to share something with you. I will not share the people itself, but I'd like to share with you that we already have some people that's here. Our students already started. Okay, we have more people.
00:25:03.694 - 00:25:26.828, Speaker A: Yes. We don't need to have the names now, but the people is starting. This is great. Congrats to everyone that is doing this with us. This is really amazing. Okay, perfect. Probably if it's showing nahor now, it's that it's.
00:25:26.828 - 00:25:45.952, Speaker A: No, it's not empty yet. Okay, we are still good. Try to get less, don't get link. Now only 0.1 is enough to you. This is an interesting question. Yes.
00:25:45.952 - 00:26:27.514, Speaker A: If you have Sepolia, you can find in the blockchain explorer some transaction that you receive this it and use that. Okay, Elena and. Okay, maybe some people need help from yesterday. How can I get Sepolia here? Remember that? Let's go forward. So I made the information here for you. Now we are going to remix. First of all, let's be sure that metamask is right.
00:26:27.514 - 00:26:54.494, Speaker A: So on Metamask you must be sure. If you came here in the left top corner that you have with the net. I am. I must go out to that. That you have the show test networks enable. So enable the show test networks. Then you can see Sepolia.
00:26:54.494 - 00:27:25.734, Speaker A: And here we are. I am in Sepolia now. Okay, let's see if you are good. Okay, great. Now to create our first smart content, we are using an online environment called remix. So remix is from Ethereum foundation. And let's go to remix.
00:27:25.734 - 00:27:55.750, Speaker A: Okay? Yes. This is the password. So let's go to remix now. This is remix. And don't over here I have a lot of contents that I did in the past. You are starting now. So probably you don't have this and doesn't matter.
00:27:55.750 - 00:28:18.424, Speaker A: You can create a new workspace. But let's try on this way. Okay, don't worry about this. So we are here now we are on remix. This is the moment you go to remix. We are here now. Remix.
00:28:18.424 - 00:29:03.642, Speaker A: But before create our first smart content, let's configure remix in a way that will be good for you. What I must do first, I go to the icon number four or button number three, stuff like that. Let's see what's the for me because we have some things like I used to count this being an icon. Okay, so 1234. This is therefore the solidity compiler. And over there you can see that I have the autocompile enable. So do the same.
00:29:03.642 - 00:29:44.464, Speaker A: Enable out compile. This is important. Icon number 41234 solid compiler and enable the autocompile. Okay, perfect. Let's go forward now we are going to the next icon and it will be the deploy and run transactions. Let's see. So icon number 512345 deploy and run transactions.
00:29:44.464 - 00:30:12.884, Speaker A: Icon number five, deploy and run transactions. Here I am and here in the. Wow. What is it? No, not that. On the environment. Environment I change the environment to connect with my wallet. So I'm connecting this environment to develop smart contracts with my metamask wallet.
00:30:12.884 - 00:30:51.622, Speaker A: How to do that? Clicking on injected provider. Injected provider metamask. When you do that on the first time, you must authorize that. So let's authorize that next and connect. You can see here exactly below the injected provider that I am in the sepolia network. This is the chain id. The id of Sepolia.
00:30:51.622 - 00:31:30.472, Speaker A: But I am on Sepolia network and this is okay it seems that is not connected yet because okay it was zero it but this is my balance. Now we are good. Let's see how is our faucet now. Okay, we have this in the faucet so we are good now if you need more each if you didn't get yet, we are red heavy G's in the faucet. Perfect. Thank you chaining team. We are working together all the time and here you are.
00:31:30.472 - 00:32:16.334, Speaker A: This is my environment. I'm ready to create my first smart content. How about you? Let's come back to the chat and see what's happened with you. Doesn't the compiler version doesn't matter now because I have without compile enable I will use the compiler version that it's inside my smart contents. Okay. And it's this one more so is low for you. So icon number four solid compiler enable out compiler next icon deploy and run transactions environment.
00:32:16.334 - 00:32:50.222, Speaker A: Choose injected provider. This will be metamask and then you must authorize inside your metamask. So are you ready to create your first smart contract? Yes Thiago. I have it only because I did some contact verification before. We are not using that, so don't worry about that. Okay. And let's go forward now.
00:32:50.222 - 00:33:20.594, Speaker A: It's like a challenger moment. Let's see how you do that. I used to like to copy and paste this matte content here, here in the pad. Sometimes we have problem doing that. Let's see if the pad will survive. If not, I'm adding side slides as well. Okay so now to create my first smart concept I must go to the icon number two.
00:33:20.594 - 00:34:00.468, Speaker A: So icon number two I will create this file register. So let's do that. You can do with me. So icon number two file explorer. Below the workspaces I have a button the blank paper here to create a new file let's click on that and the name is register. So here we are. Now you can see in the right side that I have a blank page, a blog page but it's empty.
00:34:00.468 - 00:34:34.680, Speaker A: And here I create my smart content. I already have that so I will share with you the code that I have here. But we are doing this together. Let's see if this is the same that I have over there. Yes this is what I'd like to use. So what I'm doing now with you here in the pad, let's see if the paddle survive. If it's not, it's not a problem.
00:34:34.680 - 00:35:09.234, Speaker A: I can add in the slides as well and I find another way to you to help you here. I will share the code here between the beginning and end and these two slashes for the right side are comments on solid. So this is a comment. This is another comment. And inside this I will copy and paste the smart content. Then you are doing the same inside your remix. So let's get mine copy to you.
00:35:09.234 - 00:35:25.974, Speaker A: Don't cut the code. Try to only copy it. So here is the code. Are you select it now? Oh someone already cut it. I can't believe. Okay let's try again. Be careful.
00:35:25.974 - 00:35:43.374, Speaker A: We are doing this every day. Here we are. Let's see. Yes it's, it's two over there. So here I am. I mean copying the code. Select it, copy the code.
00:35:43.374 - 00:36:37.872, Speaker A: Then I came into remix. Remember that I have that empty file over there and paste it. And you have this message, this card message because I may paste some code that I got in another place. So you should know what you're doing or at least you should trust in this code because we are learning, I'm teaching now you can trust all my code. Okay is this click on. Ok and here is the smart content. Let's see how are you now? Okay Tony if it is happen try to refresh, reload hemix.
00:36:37.872 - 00:36:55.244, Speaker A: Okay. This can happen if you don't have the wallet and have him ex open. This happens sometimes with me. It's not a problem. Okay. Let's see if it's the file over there. Yes, it's this shoe over there.
00:36:55.244 - 00:37:15.832, Speaker A: Congrats, guys. You are so amazing. I got copy of this only for, for now. Wait. Okay, the copy is done. Okay, let's go. Oh, and now someone deleted everything.
00:37:15.832 - 00:37:45.144, Speaker A: I can't believe, guys. Okay, thank you to bring it back. Okay, let's go back to remix now. And here we are. Let's understand our code. Like I said before, when I have these two slashes to the right side, this is a comment. It means that all that we have here is some comments.
00:37:45.144 - 00:38:25.346, Speaker A: Solidity and remix. Suggest to us to have in the first line of your code to have this identifier with the kind of license that you are using. So I'm using the MIT license. This is an open source license. After that we have here the command pragma. And this command is to define the version of your compiler. So I'm using the solidity language with the compiler.
00:38:25.346 - 00:38:51.594, Speaker A: Version zero 890 is this. Let's see, it's over there. Okay, we didn't. Let's go forward. And here I have another comment called content. And this comment, this comment is the definition of mysmatch content. Mysmatch content is called register.
00:38:51.594 - 00:39:16.650, Speaker A: And what I have between these two keys, I forgot the name of this. Someone could remember me, please. And what I have inside this, it's my smart content. Let's see what I have. First of all, I have a variable. A variable is a kind of box that you can add things. Inside my variable, it's a string.
00:39:16.650 - 00:39:40.016, Speaker A: It's the type string. Inside a string. I can store any kind of information. For example, if it's an integer, I can only store numbers. If it's a string, I can store numbers and letters and symbols. Everything okay? Oh, thank you, AJ. The curly braces.
00:39:40.016 - 00:40:05.734, Speaker A: Yes, this is the curly braces. Thank you. And here you can see that my variable is private. It means that I can only access this variable inside my smart content. And the name of the variable, it's info. Okay, this is the name. I'd like to see if the pet survive.
00:40:05.734 - 00:40:35.814, Speaker A: Yes, survived until now. Okay, we are good. Yes, congrats, guys, you are doing so well. And after my variable, the definition of my variable, I have a function. I used to say that a function, it's like a name. And when you call or run that name, you can run execute. A lot of comments here.
00:40:35.814 - 00:41:21.634, Speaker A: I have only one comment in each of my functions, but let's show another review. For example, any of this. Let's go here. Here I have a command, a function with four commands inside, and here I have order with more. So we can have more comments inside the name of the function, okay, the function is exactly to define some name and execute what is inside. And here we are, we have the function called get info. This is public, anyone can call this function.
00:41:21.634 - 00:42:10.834, Speaker A: It's a view because this function is not changing nothing inside the blockchain. Remember that yesterday you learned about the state machine and how we can change update states using the transactions inside the blocks. This is the blockchain. So when I have a view it means that I'm not changing, I state inside the blockchain. I'm only reading some information and this is, I'm reading the blockchain, okay. And this function called get info will return this kind of information. And you can see that this information is the same of my variable.
00:42:10.834 - 00:42:49.484, Speaker A: So I'm returning the content of my variable info. Okay, this is memory because it's not saved in any place, it's temporary. So it's memory. And I think you don't, don't worry about where you are creating, okay, I have some folders over there, but I created everything here in the main folder. Okay, it's fine if you're creating side content as well. It's up to you. Okay, let's come back to our code.
00:42:49.484 - 00:43:44.850, Speaker A: And now you can see here that I have another function called set info. And when I call this function I must pass a parameter. The parameter, it's a string is the same type of my variable. It's memory because it's temporary. I'm not only using this moment, it's not be saved in any place and my parameter is called info. This function is public as well. And inside the curly brace that I learned, I'm saving the information that I have in the parameter, the underscore info, I mean storing this information inside my variable info.
00:43:44.850 - 00:44:30.560, Speaker A: And this is, this is our first smart content. We can store some information inside the blockchain and you can read this in another moment. Let's see if I saw something extra that I need help. I think we are good now. Okay, we are good. Okay, let's go forward. Now that we have our smart contract done, we can see in the icon number four, the solid compiler that you have the green sign over there and it's saying compilation successful.
00:44:30.560 - 00:45:10.644, Speaker A: It means that my smart contract is done to be published. Okay, and let's help you with this, if you'd like to follow this part. We can see that we are here now and let's refresh this. Okay, so compilation successful. Now I'm going to the icon number five, deploy and run transactions. And let's click on deploy. Go forward, deploy.
00:45:10.644 - 00:46:03.724, Speaker A: Let's do that. Here we are deploying drone transactions. Icon number five, click on deploy. In this moment, what's happened? Remix. Create a transaction without the byte code of my smart contract. How the code that the solid compiler can understand then, because I am connected on my wallet. So Metamask opened a pop up window with this transaction and I must confirm this transaction in order to metamask send this transaction, we used to say like broadcast the transaction to the blockchain.
00:46:03.724 - 00:46:30.624, Speaker A: So let's confirm. And now I can follow this in this part as well. Okay. In the right part down, you can see what's happened. The creation of hash, still painting. And it's done. Now if I go to Metamask, I also can see that I have a the contract deployment done.
00:46:30.624 - 00:47:24.234, Speaker A: I can see that on the block explorer. So here you can see that this account create this smart contract and let's come back to remix. And now it's a moment that I like to have you sharing your smart contract with me. I used to do this in the pad, but probably will not work with all that, so no problem, use the for me to do that. So if I came here, I scroll down in the left side you can see the deployed unpinned contracts. And this is the name of my contract register. And in the right side I have a button to copy the address.
00:47:24.234 - 00:48:17.094, Speaker A: So every time you create Ismat contact, each is much content. You have your own address in the same way that your wallet has an address. And you used to say that wallets have external owned accounts, the EOA and here smart contacts have address as well. So copy this and let's go to our form. I'm editing the response now. And yes, I know that I'm editing and here I have the register is match contact address and I will paste this here for you. And let's update my form again.
00:48:17.094 - 00:48:52.434, Speaker A: And this is it saved to the bootcamp if you'd like to do this on this way. I used to do this, but sometimes didn't work. Let's see if it will work at the end. Let's take off all the translations part that we have here. Let's create and divider. I'm not sure if this is working. Let's see.
00:48:52.434 - 00:49:17.704, Speaker A: Go to the plight contents, copy their register address and let's do it here. Try to not delete everything please. I did my channel anyway. This is not so important. Like the farm. The farm, it's important. Hey, vivid.
00:49:17.704 - 00:50:38.758, Speaker A: Congrats. And we have Thiago that's coming. Emil, Michael, Mario, Hugo. Yes, congrats everyone that create your first match content now sol, I think you are muted. Yes, yes. Okay, let's talk again. No problem.
00:50:38.758 - 00:51:45.990, Speaker A: Thank you for helping me. And here we are. Let's come back what I did now I came to the left side where I have this arrow and expand my contact and I have here the buttons that I have with the function. So the blue button is the get info, the orange button is the set info and this is let's try to click on the get info button and I don't have any information here yet so let's come back and click in the set info. And what would like to save inside your contact? I'd like to save my name. So okay, set info, this is the parameter, this is the information that I'd like to save inside my contact and click on set info again. I mean sending a transaction to the blockchain.
00:51:45.990 - 00:52:29.498, Speaker A: If you realize when I did the get info, I didn't send a transaction, it's only a credit. Now I'm changing the state, I'm changing the blockchain and here we are. This is confirmed now. And if I come back to get info, I can see my information is over there. Okay, like who am. This is not the order that I have in my functions here. This is the order that remix show the functions to us.
00:52:29.498 - 00:53:31.864, Speaker A: And they used to show first the functions that change state and after that we can see the functions that are only views. Okay. And Chagui, you can write whatever you'd like to write over there. It's your context now, okay, I did that. This is my transaction, I'd like to see this transaction now. Like the settings at least if I come back to remix, I can click in the transaction and view on block Explorer and this is my transaction 1 minute ago. And if I click to show more so we scroll down, click to show more.
00:53:31.864 - 00:54:35.072, Speaker A: Scroll down. You can see that the function setinfo was called and if you click on this, the codeinput data and here you can see my information. Oh no, but my variable is private. How can I see the information here? Because here I missing the parameter underscore info and this will be saved inside the variable. So I used to say that this is private but not too much because if you are saving information over there, like I'm doing here, I can check this and this transaction, this is my contact can be followed. It's publicly, so the information is not so private. So be careful about that.
00:54:35.072 - 00:55:16.452, Speaker A: Okay, now what am I doing? Oh, I have a question for you. Do you think that I can update this information now? 1 minute. Do you think about it? Yes. Oh, we have the inside over that. Yes. Temple, good to see you here again. Parvin as well that answer first.
00:55:16.452 - 00:55:53.894, Speaker A: Yes, I can change my information. So now I'd like to have the chain link bootcamp over there. Is this you can save update your information to any information that you'd like to to do. Okay, set info. And here we are. Confirm. And I'm awaiting the confirmation of the transaction here.
00:55:53.894 - 00:56:32.324, Speaker A: Here it's confirmed. And now if I come back to get info, you can see the chainlink bootcamp 2024. So I could update my information because I have this function prepared to do that, the setinfo. But I can't change the source code. If I try to change something here, I must deploy a new content will not be the semi content. Okay. Oh, I love this question.
00:56:32.324 - 00:57:03.180, Speaker A: So can anybody else update the variable? Let's do that. So how am I doing that? Now I will get one of your contact. Let's choose a contact of another person and I will interact with your contact. Let's see. Okay, it seems that the paddies is still surviving. We are good. 300 people here.
00:57:03.180 - 00:57:38.976, Speaker A: Amazing guys, congrats to you. So luft, are you hearing the in the chat as well? I mean getting your comfort now. Okay, so what I did, I got the address of luft copied. Come back to remix. And this is the source code. We have the same search code. Oh, okay.
00:57:38.976 - 00:58:11.498, Speaker A: Luft is here. Okay. Okay. And what am I doing now? Instead of click on deploy, I'm using this code, this source code with the address of Luft contract. So I know that this address is related to this contract. So I can do that. Click on I address and if I scroll down again, you can see that I have two copies.
00:58:11.498 - 00:58:34.556, Speaker A: Now, the first copy is mine. The second copy is from Luft. And here we are. Let's see what he has in his contact. Oh, get info. Hello, AC from Zero X Bojang. Wow, amazing.
00:58:34.556 - 00:59:19.134, Speaker A: I change your concept now. Oh, so was here. Okay, let's update it. Confirm. So I'm changing the information in this much contact from other personnel. It's confirmed. Hey Luft, could you answer in the chat, in the YouTube chat if your concrete was changed for you as well.
00:59:19.134 - 00:59:55.164, Speaker A: And yes, first question is this and do I know where are you based? And look at this. Luft is in Jakarta, Indonesia. I am in Sao Paulo, Brazil. And I can interact with your content. And he just let us know that yes, his contact was changed. So this is amazing. So I'd like to see your contact now.
00:59:55.164 - 01:00:16.784, Speaker A: Let's not your name. Sorry, I need to get your content again. This. Let's see what's happened with your content. This is your content. And you can see that it's not only me that update your content. I think other people as well.
01:00:16.784 - 01:00:40.460, Speaker A: And look at that. You create your content 40 minutes ago and you have all the transactions over there. I can have the history of your concrete. I can do some audit with your content. Let's see the last transaction. I think this is not mine. And click to show more.
01:00:40.460 - 01:00:59.118, Speaker A: What they did over there. Vinicius was in our content as well. So is this. And this is a nice exercise. So choose another person over there. And I used to do this in a or in a good way. So I used to do in this way.
01:00:59.118 - 01:01:28.368, Speaker A: You try to change the order. So luft you change Jen that you change. AJ that you change love. Try to change the order. The next one 1 minute to you do that. Oh, related to this question, I will not do this here. This is a bootcamp starting from zero for beginners.
01:01:28.368 - 01:02:13.178, Speaker A: Okay. So this is not a topic to this bootcamp. Okay. And this is first you create your first smart content. After that you learned how to interact with as much content from another person here in the bootcamp. And let's go to the third part of our bootcamp. Now you just realize that anyone can interact with your content, can change your dismay content.
01:02:13.178 - 01:02:50.616, Speaker A: And by the way, yes. If you create your first smart content now, you can share on your social networks. I create my first match concept here in the Chainlinky bootcamp 2024. And let's come back here. Okay. Like if you don't take care of the permissions, the roles inside as much content, this can be a huge problem. So security problems can happen with this, hacks can happen.
01:02:50.616 - 01:03:27.324, Speaker A: Because of this, we must be careful related to who can do what inside my content. Next. Now we are creating a new ismatch content. And this new is match content. You have permissions. Let's create a new register where we are managing allow list and you can tell who can interact, who can update the information inside our smart content. Okay, let's do that.
01:03:27.324 - 01:03:55.732, Speaker A: I'd like to see if my content is done here. No, I don't have it. So I'm equating from zero with you. One thing is here. Okay, let's see if you can survive. Are you trying to do here at the end now? Okay, let's see if you can survive. Oh, this.
01:03:55.732 - 01:04:28.582, Speaker A: The translation is really annoying. I can see this. Okay, so what we did, now we interact with another contact. And now I'm creating this file called registeraccess. So, okay, let's do that. I think this is fair. I will do this again and remember that this is record.
01:04:28.582 - 01:04:53.174, Speaker A: You can watch the video later as well. But let's do one more time. Here we are. This is the I will do this with another person. So now I'd like to do with. Jen. Jen, are you here? Let's see if you are here.
01:04:53.174 - 01:05:33.864, Speaker A: This is the address of register from Gen. And how can I start? I came here to deploy and run transactions button. Close this and here, instead of clicking on deploy, I came into add address and I'm pasting the address of genconduct. So I will use the code that is open on my right side on this address. And now I have three copies. Let's expand the copy number three. The get info is high.
01:05:33.864 - 01:06:10.214, Speaker A: The setting is so around the world because I'm interacting with you around the world. And this is confirm. And Thiago, are you probably. I know what's happened with you. Let's finish mine first. So I'm waiting here. Yes, getting full.
01:06:10.214 - 01:06:37.674, Speaker A: Oh, another person changing with me. Come on. Let's see if my transaction is over there or no, maybe not. This is the transaction. I interact with this content. If you go to my transaction, yes, I did it, but another person did as well. And you can see that we have some interactions with concept as well.
01:06:37.674 - 01:07:20.564, Speaker A: Okay, so I'd like to help Thiago a bit. Thiago, I think I know what's happened with you. If you are not check it out. If you are here, if the environment is the injected provider, and if you have the metamask here, if you have the sepolia here. Because maybe you are doing this like in the remix. VM remix has a blockchain simulator in the memory of your browser. So if you are going inside your browser, you are not connected in the network.
01:07:20.564 - 01:08:00.692, Speaker A: And if you try the address of someone else, you not working because you are not in the in the network. Okay. And if the whole issue persists, probably you must refresh remix. Okay. And what more can I tell you before refresh remix? Be careful. Be sure that you have your content. Like you can pin your content and it will be saved inside your remix.
01:08:00.692 - 01:08:30.471, Speaker A: Like I did that now I pinned my content. It means that this is my register. And I will have this with me even if I close. Remix and open again. Okay, now let's create the next content. Here we are, probably before the translations. Oh yes, we are here again.
01:08:30.471 - 01:09:15.270, Speaker A: We must copy what you have between the beginning and the end. And for tomorrow I will have a new way to share the content with you. But today we are doing it this way. And by the way, I must get my contact in another place. Here. Remember, don't cut the code, only copy it here. And let's try to delete this transaction, this translation part again, this is our content I must create now register access is the name of my content.
01:09:15.270 - 01:09:57.174, Speaker A: Let's go back to remix and on the second icon, file explorer, exactly down the default workspace, create a new file and I am in a wrong place. I prefer to be in the main folder, so not do that. Okay, main folder, I am here now. And yes, now I'm creating the main folder, register access. So here we are. So let's copy and paste. Yes, the code is still here.
01:09:57.174 - 01:10:26.190, Speaker A: You don't need to copy the beginning and end, only what is inside. And let's take this off. And this is the code. And now we are understanding what we have here. Let's see, how are you? Oh great. Thiago. Yes, I love remix, but sometimes we have problems.
01:10:26.190 - 01:11:04.280, Speaker A: But it's only this. Okay, I was checking the comments. We are good. Now starting the same way. First line, the license that I'm using, it's an open source license, the kind is mat. After that is the same version of solidity. Remember that if I have this here and if I have doubt compile, enable automatically.
01:11:04.280 - 01:11:47.852, Speaker A: I have the right version over there. Okay, don't worry about that then the name of my contact now is registered access and I have a different kind of information. Wait a minute, I talked too much and here we are. You can see now that my variable info changes a bit. This is too private. But I have this bracket with the strings. It means that now I don't have only one information.
01:11:47.852 - 01:12:23.504, Speaker A: This bracket means that it is an array. It means that this is a list of information. And I have positions in that list and different information in each position. Like, and this index is starting on zero. So position number zero, I have some information. Position number one, I have another information. Okay, also we have here a new kind of variable called address.
01:12:23.504 - 01:13:01.060, Speaker A: And the variable address, this type, it's only true store address, like the address of your contact, the address of a wallet, something like that. This is public. The difference between private and public is like the public automatically create a function with the name of your variable and everyone can see. So you have a function called owner. And this is the address that I have over there. Okay, let's see if the content is here. No, the contents over there.
01:13:01.060 - 01:13:57.176, Speaker A: Okay, then I have another kind of variable called mapping. And this is the way that I'm teaching you solidity fundamentals. We are creating smart context and understanding how the concepts inside this, okay, understand the solid fundamentals, creating the contents. So the mapping, we used to say that this is a key value kind of variable. It means that for each key and the key, you be in the type address. I have one value and this is a boolean value. It means that true or false, so for each address I have a true or false value and the default is false.
01:13:57.176 - 01:14:30.682, Speaker A: It means that if you don't have the address you receive the false, the return is false. Okay, this is public as well. And the name of my variable is allow list. This is the way, this is a simple way to control access inside ismat content. Tomorrow we will learn this in most sophisticated way. Today is the simple way. Okay, now here it's a new concept for you.
01:14:30.682 - 01:15:19.046, Speaker A: I have the constructor. So the constructor is a special kind of function and it will be called only when you are deploying the smart content. We used to have this function to initialize variables and here we are. When I'm deploying this much content, I'd like to have inside the owner the address of the mess, the message point sender. This is the address of the person who is sending the transaction. When we send a transaction, we used to say that we send a message. So this is the message, dot send it.
01:15:19.046 - 01:15:46.302, Speaker A: This is the address of the person who is sent the transaction. Okay, I miss saving over there. This is the owner of the content. Okay, here also I have the allow list. Remember the mapping. So I have the allow list for this address. The owner, I miss saying that the owner can do something.
01:15:46.302 - 01:16:33.412, Speaker A: My contact, I mean adding the owner in the hello list. Okay, then this is another concept to you. The event events are like locks that they are. They are information that you be public, but it will not be exactly saved inside the blockchain. You can see that in the transaction, but you must like having the structure of the blockchain to get that information will not be saved inside the blockchain. Okay. And my event is called info change.
01:16:33.412 - 01:17:47.904, Speaker A: And I'm calling this event every time I'm updating the information I'd like to share with the world. What was the old information and what will be the new information is this. Now I have another kind of concept to you in solid colored modifier. Modifier. It's something like I have this name, the name of my modifier, and I can add the modifier in the function. So if I add the modifier in a function, my function, you have the same permissions or the same requirements of my modifier. Okay, so what I have inside this modifier, the modifier only owner is checking in query that the person who, who is sending this transaction, we don't know who transaction is that, but the address must be the same address of the owner.
01:17:47.904 - 01:18:34.284, Speaker A: And if it is not, you receive the only owner message. If everything is good, this underscore means that the code will be executing it continued to execute the code. Let's see where I'm using the only owner. So this is the modifier. If I scroll down, I have here two functions. One colored add member, other colored delete mainbear, the main bear, and I have the modifier here. It means that these functions are to add or remove addresses from your hello list.
01:18:34.284 - 01:19:27.566, Speaker A: What means add a member? When I call the function with the member, I pass the address of that member and then, I mean in the allow list with that address. I'm saying that is true. It means that now that address is in the allow list and in the moment that I, I don't like to have this address anymore, I will do the same with the member, the address, and now it's false. It means that this address is not on the yellow list anymore. Okay, who can do that? Anyone can call. Okay, but if you call this function and you are not the owner, you is paying some guests to receive an error. You not working.
01:19:27.566 - 01:20:00.744, Speaker A: Okay, you can call, but you not work. Is this. Let's go back a bit because you understand the modifier only owner. I have another modifier over there called only allow list. And the requirement in this moment is that the address who is sending the transaction is inside the hello list. It means that the result is true. If it's not, I will receive the only hello list.
01:20:00.744 - 01:20:40.824, Speaker A: If this is true, if we pass the requirement, you have it underscore, it means that we are continuing the code where we have the modifier. So where I have it, I have it here in the set info. And now set info is to update some information. And remember that I have now an array, a list. So I should say which position of my array. I mean updating the information. For example, I'd like to update the information.
01:20:40.824 - 01:21:10.754, Speaker A: The second item on my list, the index one. I update this information and only who is in the allow list can do that. And here you can see that I created the event before. Now I'm using the event. So here I'm emitting the event with the old information and the new information. After that, I'm updating the information. Okay.
01:21:10.754 - 01:21:53.964, Speaker A: In the same way I have the add info, this is the way that I can add new information on my list. The parameter underscore info is the information that I'd like to have. Again, only allow list can do that. And when I do that, I'm returning the position on my list. We used to add at the end. And because this is an array, I use this push, this is a command to add some information at the end of an array. So I added the information over there and I get the index and sent to you.
01:21:53.964 - 01:22:33.484, Speaker A: This is the size, the amount of index that I have on my list. So minus one is the index. Okay, now let's come back here. What's the get info? Now the get info is to get a specific position inside your list. So I'd like to know what's have, what we have in the position two or in the position one is this. I will tell the index and receive the information. And I have another function over there that's to list out the list, the list info.
01:22:33.484 - 01:23:09.834, Speaker A: So here I'm returning the array of information out the list. Be careful when you are using this function. In most complicated apps, this is simple. This is at the dark smart contract. But imagine that you are using this and you have thousands of info over there. Probably you can't use this anymore because the result will be so huge that you can't receive that information back. Okay, be careful about that.
01:23:09.834 - 01:23:36.286, Speaker A: Here, I have this only to bid that with you. Okay, let's see how we are is the pet survived and I think someone linked the pet needed a pet. Yes. So here we are. We are changing the color and everything. The code survived. Congrats everyone.
01:23:36.286 - 01:23:58.964, Speaker A: We are so good with this. We are doing great now. Oh, I didn't check yet. I didn't this kind of test, but this will happen in some moment. But we need to test it. You can test and let me know. So let's come back here.
01:23:58.964 - 01:24:50.974, Speaker A: Our smart contract is done here, so it's time to deploy. Remember that you must check in the icon number four. If the compilation is successful like mine, and then go to the icon number five, deploy Internet transactions and click on deploy. Confirm your transaction metamask. I'm waiting. Then it's confirmed. Now you can scroll down deployed contacts and the register access is over there.
01:24:50.974 - 01:25:09.714, Speaker A: So do this now. Deployed contents. Copy the register address. Let's see if you can survive. Try to put above this. Okay, I try mine. So copy.
01:25:09.714 - 01:25:43.074, Speaker A: Come here and paste. Also remember that it's important to you to update this in our task form. So remember that we have the task form here in at the beginning as well. Task farm is over there. Oh, someone did something. Task farm is lights. Okay.
01:25:43.074 - 01:26:13.234, Speaker A: Better now. And I'd like to update the contact inside my task form. Let's go. So here is my farm. I'm editing my response and what I'd like to have it now. We have the register access is my contact address. So let's paste it here and submit again.
01:26:13.234 - 01:26:38.810, Speaker A: This part is done. Okay. Okay, this is good. And let's try our registered access. Now you can see that I'd like to see who is the owner. This is my address. Finish on 96.
01:26:38.810 - 01:26:58.084, Speaker A: It's me. So list info, nothing. Now let's start to add information here. Chaining. You can do the information that you'd like to have. Okay, add info. Confirming.
01:26:58.084 - 01:27:31.300, Speaker A: Let's see, how are you? And I know that I have a question. What is the question? Who was putting some question here? I can try to help you. And congrats everyone. We have a lot of information here. Amazing to see this. I'm really proud of you. And like, I wish to be with you in person, only to see the eyes shining when you are creating our first seismic update.
01:27:31.300 - 01:28:02.044, Speaker A: But you can make me happy sharing the social networks. How else for you? And now we just deployed the register access contact and I added the chainlink. Let's see the list info chain link. If I go to the get info, I only have the index zero. If I try the index one. I have an ehr. If I try the index zero.
01:28:02.044 - 01:28:30.028, Speaker A: Yes, the information is over there. Oh, thank you, Dtech. Thank you, Anthony. Amazing. Thank you, AJ. And this is now I'd like to have the chaining bootcamp 2024. So I'm adding a new information bootcamp only bootcamp.
01:28:30.028 - 01:29:09.584, Speaker A: Okay, add inf. So I'm adding another information confine. Waiting a bit more. Okay, here we are. List info. Chaining bootcamp. Okay, let's update the chaining now.
01:29:09.584 - 01:29:32.920, Speaker A: So I'm going to the setting. It will be better if you expand the setting info. The chain link. It's in the index zero. So I'd like to update the index zero and add the chain link. 2024 bootcamp. Okay, I change.
01:29:32.920 - 01:30:16.664, Speaker A: I updated the chain link for chain link 2024 and confirming the transaction. It's my pleasure, Vasa. And yes, you are welcome. I hope to see you during this ten days finish out the boot camp. And good to know that you. That you are from Brasil. Julio, we have another session in portuguese today.
01:30:16.664 - 01:30:38.492, Speaker A: It will be 07:00 p.m. Here in Sao Paulo. Okay. And also we have the spanish session 04:00 p.m. Brazil and argentinian time. And is this. So it's updated.
01:30:38.492 - 01:30:54.964, Speaker A: Let's see. Listing food chaining 24. Bootcamp getting for now is only this. Try to get info in the index one. The second position bootcamp. I write the only one more. Then we are doing something different.
01:30:54.964 - 01:31:34.740, Speaker A: Now I'd like to have to set info. No, I'd like to add one more info. I'd like to have the buy. So here, add info. And soon are you asked to interact with some of your concrete. Okay. And here we are.
01:31:34.740 - 01:32:05.696, Speaker A: It's confirmed. So probably now I have a chain mink bootcamp by Seoul. And it's this. Now is the time that I'd like to interact with you. So let's see if I can can find you. So, Julio, I'd like to have you and another person. Could you add.
01:32:05.696 - 01:33:11.444, Speaker A: Are you adding my address over there? And could you add me inside your contract? So, let's get my address. Okay, this is my address. And what happens if this is interesting? What's happening if I try to interact with a contact from another person now? So, let's see. Thiago, is you here? Is it you here? Let's see. This is the address of Thiago. Contact. Let's go to remix.
01:33:11.444 - 01:33:33.144, Speaker A: This is mine. I close that I'm using that address with Thiago. Address, contact. And this is. It seems that is not a check summit. Let's see if this is right or no. What's happened? Owners.
01:33:33.144 - 01:33:57.244, Speaker A: It seems that you are the owner. List info. You have information over there. Chago, if you try to interact with the contract from another person, you not work. Exactly, because you are not allowed to do that. So, I mean, try to interact with Chago conflict. This will not work, but I'd like to show you what's happened.
01:33:57.244 - 01:34:30.058, Speaker A: Is this. Is this the message that you have it? Yes, you have this message. Because you are not authorized to interact with this content. Okay. In some moment in the past, remix used to show the mess the right message over there. If you send the transaction anyway, this transaction will fail and you will spend some gas for nothing. So I not do that.
01:34:30.058 - 01:34:47.688, Speaker A: Sorry. Is that so? Ennis told that I can use his contact. Let's see. And yes, exactly. This is the Innes. You are here. Okay.
01:34:47.688 - 01:35:11.334, Speaker A: This is the Ennis concrete. I got his address. Can we. If you authorize me, I can try to interact with you again. Okay, this is in his contract. And now let's see what information you have. You have your bicel.
01:35:11.334 - 01:35:30.290, Speaker A: So cute. I'd like to see if my address. It's enable here to be shared. So let's get my address here. Is my address copied. Go in the allow list and check it out. Yes, it's true.
01:35:30.290 - 01:35:49.914, Speaker A: It seems that I can have it. Let's come back to Thiago concrete. And probably this is false. You can see here that it's false. I can't interact with Thiago concrete because he didn't allow me. Yeah, okay, but Inez alo me. So let's do yours.
01:35:49.914 - 01:36:13.534, Speaker A: This is in his contact. And now I'd like to add more information. Campy boot camp by song. Let's do this. What I'd like to have it is now. Hello, world. Not so inspired today.
01:36:13.534 - 01:36:46.320, Speaker A: Add info. And yes, you can see that now I can interact with in this content. I don't have an air here because I am allowed over there. Let's wait a bit. Wait, the confirmation. Yes, it's confirmed. Let's go here.
01:36:46.320 - 01:37:08.564, Speaker A: List info chainlink 2024 bootcamp. Bootcamp by Saul. Hello, world. I did it. And I'd like to explore your content a bit more. Okay, we have two points to do is to. First of that, let's get my information on block Explorer.
01:37:08.564 - 01:37:31.122, Speaker A: But this is your content. Let's go to your content. And here you can see that we have a two add in Facetim. We have two admin bedroom, one worked another node. And this is me adding the information. Okay. And yes, Antony.
01:37:31.122 - 01:37:53.634, Speaker A: Yes. You type the metamask address, but not your address. You must use the address from the other person that would like to interact with you. Okay. And Antoni. No, Thiago told that I can do it now. So let's come back.
01:37:53.634 - 01:38:16.684, Speaker A: Remember that the second one is from Chago. Hello, list. It is too false. Chiago, you did it. Oh, no, no. I don't know if this is not you. Do you know if this is you? Thiago Chainlinki bootcamp.
01:38:16.684 - 01:38:42.152, Speaker A: Yeah, the yellow list is still false, Chagu. And in this, let us know that he changed the content. Yes. Amazing. So, Chago, this is you. It means that in your content you must add the address of my wallet. In the allow list.
01:38:42.152 - 01:39:02.296, Speaker A: You must do this here in the Add member part. So kme to add member to add me. Okay. I can use Yugo as well. Sepoya. Okay. Okay.
01:39:02.296 - 01:39:24.854, Speaker A: I will go a bit forward and then if you have time, you can come back. But I think we are. We are good. Okay. So another point that I'd like to teach you today. When we have a concept like this is the concept from. This was from Changono.
01:39:24.854 - 01:39:45.174, Speaker A: From Ennis. Yes. If you go here, you can see that this is. We can't understand this. This is a byte code. But we can verify and publish our concrete. So what we are doing now, we are doing this part.
01:39:45.174 - 01:40:17.634, Speaker A: How can I do that? Let's try this. Let's go to Sepolia, Italy. Search for your concrete. Your register access can be. Okay, let's do that. So. Oh, why I close it.
01:40:17.634 - 01:40:44.654, Speaker A: Let's get the last time I did something content deployment. Like here. Content deployment. So I think this is my contact. Let's be sure. This is my contact. Copy it, come back here and search it.
01:40:44.654 - 01:41:27.760, Speaker A: Yes. So go to insert scale on Sepolia. And over there go to the tabic contract here, tabby content. And then you can do the verify and publish part. What am I doing here? Click on verify and publish. And this is my content. The compiler type.
01:41:27.760 - 01:42:00.024, Speaker A: It's a single file. The compiler version, it was 19. Okay. And the kind of license was Matt. So you must feel this part. Now can I copy this? I think yes, probably didn't copy it so well. Let's see the result.
01:42:00.024 - 01:42:28.284, Speaker A: And again that. Yes, it's crazy. Okay, so how the license over there. That will not be good. But select the compiler version, the license type and this is. Okay. Compiler type and it was that.
01:42:28.284 - 01:43:02.274, Speaker A: Okay, is this. So let's come back over there. Click on continue. And now I must copy and paste this much content here. Okay, let's get from remix exactly this that I have here. Select all like a control wave. Select all, then copy it.
01:43:02.274 - 01:43:31.894, Speaker A: Go to the ese scum and paste it here. Only that. Scroll down. You are not a robot. Oh, this is so hard to me. Maybe I'm right. Now let's see.
01:43:31.894 - 01:44:17.386, Speaker A: Yes. And now I can click on verify and publish it. And we are waiting this to be verified. By the way, let's answer some questions. What's the use of that? You know that blockchain is public. So it's a good practice to publish your ismatch content. It's like a way that you can tell the world.
01:44:17.386 - 01:45:02.902, Speaker A: Let the word knows. How is your content and you trusting your content and choose someone interact with your content. They can check the content before something like that. Okay. So we used to publish contents in order to be transparent in order to make the other people be comfortable in check the code before interacting with your content. This can be used to the good and to the evil. Because if there are something wrong in your concept, the hackers, you discover that, but they will discover it anyway.
01:45:02.902 - 01:45:53.770, Speaker A: Even if you didn't publish it, it's possible to do the code and try that. Okay. And this is published. Now what's happened if I came here again to my content and you can see that now in the tabby contact, I have the green sign. This is the code that we did. Now you have now two extra buttons read content with the same functions that we can only read. Like let's check the list info chainlink 2024 bootcamp by so or the get info.
01:45:53.770 - 01:46:56.844, Speaker A: Remember that I must add an index one can see and the one is the bootcamp. Okay. And maybe if everyone is trying the same now we are broking the etherscan now, so try later because when we have it 300 400 people trying in the same time, we can create problems. Okay, and what more I'd like to show you. Go to the right context now, right contact. Here we are. And in the same way that I can interact with a contact inside remix.
01:46:56.844 - 01:47:26.324, Speaker A: I can do that here. If I connect my wallet. So let's connect to web three. So it means that I'm connecting this website, the etherscom, with my metamask wallet. And this is my account. Next connect. Okay, I am connected now.
01:47:26.324 - 01:48:13.572, Speaker A: So if I try to add a new info, for example, I add my counter. I am from Brazil. So Brazil right now, in the same way that I did that on remix, I can do on ether scan. Confirm Changu. Probably your error is related to having a lot of people trying the same time. Okay. Or another point is that we have now more than 100 people doing that.
01:48:13.572 - 01:48:45.588, Speaker A: And in some moment ece come, you realize that is the semi bytecode and it's trying to do that in automatic way for you. Okay. And yes, Joseph, you can see the source code of all solidity projects on intelliscope if they do that. Okay. And this is. We are talking. Thank you, Bara.
01:48:45.588 - 01:49:04.924, Speaker A: We are talking about transparency and trust. Amazing. Exactly that. And I did that here. If I come back to read and let's get the list info again. Close and open. It's.
01:49:04.924 - 01:49:39.744, Speaker A: It was not updated. Um, probably it's not so good, like remix because I don't have a button to update this. Maybe I can refresh. And now I have the counter over there and oh, I think this is mouth for you better. And if I came into remix, let's go to mine. Mine is the first listing. It's here as well.
01:49:39.744 - 01:50:07.956, Speaker A: And someone asked me related to that contract verification with Elisa. It was that like I have a plugin on remix that do that. This is not for beginners. You don't need to worry about this now. But if you'd like to have it, you can go to the plugin manager and search here. But you must have a key on it. And scan is not so simple.
01:50:07.956 - 01:50:38.256, Speaker A: Okay, including that I deactivated that now. And this is now we create two smart contents. We create one so basic and another that you can manage the permissions. Let's see what more I have here. And remember that I shared this with you. All the information from yesterday as well. You understand everything.
01:50:38.256 - 01:51:22.404, Speaker A: This was the blockchain, fundamentals, networks, web, three wallets. You did this yesterday and today it was not like so long slide session. Like today we starting here. But now. Now it's an important moment to you because I'm sharing with you in first range. What happened, what I'm sharing with you now, it will be something that I remove my screen a bit. What I'm sharing with you now, it's only to you.
01:51:22.404 - 01:51:45.658, Speaker A: Nobody else knows about that because it was not announced yet. And you are the first to know that. And yes, I'm so excited to do this with you. This is interesting, what I can tell to you. Okay, you are learning. Two points for you. First of all, you are learning.
01:51:45.658 - 01:52:38.394, Speaker A: And I used to say that if you know how to copy and paste, you can do how the boot camp. This is good. Maybe after the bootcamp it will not be so easy. You can have like now everything is working, but if you try later, maybe it's not working the same way. You try to change something not to work, but you are still learning. And one of the best way to learn after that, when you finish the bootcamp is trying to create your own project, create a new project, have your idea and create a project and better that is create a project in a hackathon. And I'm announcing to you in firsthand our next hackathon, the upcoming chain link hackathon, it will be called.
01:52:38.394 - 01:53:26.326, Speaker A: It is starting on April 29. It means that you have you finished the bootcamp. You have two weeks more to practice and then you can start your project in the hackto. And because we are here together. You already know that we have other people that we are interacting. So probably you are meeting new friends here and you can create a new team here in the bootcamp with have your other teammates from here to participate in the next hackathon. And the chainlink hackathon used to have amazing prizes and it's amazing recognition as well.
01:53:26.326 - 01:54:00.090, Speaker A: It's so interesting. I'm so proud to have this with you in first hand. Yes, so amazing. Only you know about that. And you can't share this in the social network yet. So this, it's only for you. It's only for the people that are are here inside the bootcamp.
01:54:00.090 - 01:54:22.814, Speaker A: We didn't do official announcement yet. It will be only maybe next week. It is not today, it's not on this week. So this is only choice. Okay. And okay, we have questions about that. Yes, this is a virtual hackathon.
01:54:22.814 - 01:54:59.202, Speaker A: Get your teammates here and what more clever. We used to have the fully functional projects because it existed different kinds of hackathon. Like if you do a hackathon in a weekend, it's hard to have everything done and a fully functional project. But you have more than one month. You can do that. So try to do a fully functional project. We are expecting that.
01:54:59.202 - 01:55:18.894, Speaker A: Yes. And the date is here. The date is. Oh, I'm trying to. Yes, I could add this or not this. Yes, it's MEVP. Yes, when I'm talking about the fully project, it's an MEVP.
01:55:18.894 - 01:55:53.404, Speaker A: It was starting on April 29. And yes, you are beginner, but we know that we have people that are doing other things as well. But we have beginners and you can do that. This is an amazing experience. And maybe exactly because you are beginner, you are thinking in like a simple solution to some problem and can be better. We don't know. Try that.
01:55:53.404 - 01:56:23.448, Speaker A: What Mari have here? The requirements struggle. It's only to have a new project. Or at least if you have like an old project and advanced project project. Something that you did before must be so clear. What is new, what it was done before. It's preferred to have a new project. Okay.
01:56:23.448 - 01:57:05.966, Speaker A: A new MVP and the ES Chago. With this bootcamp you be enough in the solidity part like to create a front end. We are not teaching front end here. So probably you can study a bit more about that part or have some teammate that do that. Even if he didn't the bootcamp, he can do the other part. And yes, Mike, I think here in our bootcamp, it's amazing place to looking for teammates. You can invite your friends as well that are not here.
01:57:05.966 - 01:58:02.912, Speaker A: You can try to make a group here. Also, we have some team formation sessions during the hackathon. And yes, Javier, this is amazing because like they boot campus for beginners. But after that we have more workshops during the hackathon. The two first weeks of the hackathon, we have more workshops for you. And that workshops will be from our partners, other sponsors, and they for sure you have a workshop teaching how to create the front end to you. And another point, remember that I know that it's so hard to be here and in the same.
01:58:02.912 - 01:58:22.992, Speaker A: If you only have one screen, you must see the YouTube videos, see the pets, see my presentation and start to see everything the same time. Don't worry about that. Get the record late. Try to watch again the YouTube video. Pause. Doing your own time. Okay.
01:58:22.992 - 01:58:57.464, Speaker A: I try to not be so fast, but I know that I must have some time that's not so fast and not so slow. And I will not cover everyone. So you can do this later. Okay? And congrats to everyone that are signing to the hackathon just now. And bara, I would like to come here again. Japanese stage.
01:58:58.724 - 01:59:22.674, Speaker B: Hi, sunshine. Oh, great. I think the session went really well. I think I also see, like, there are a lot of people like Ajay Thiago being pretty active here, helping other developers as well. I think that's something that we saw yesterday as well. The community is helping each other. That's something we really wanted to see going forward as well.
01:59:22.674 - 02:00:06.050, Speaker B: And I think pretty much like, you know, everybody learned how to deploy the smart contracts today for everybody. Like, I think if this is the first time that you are actually, like, you know, deploying your smart contract, I think you should definitely share it with the entire world so you can tweet or, like, you know, you can share your experience from today's session using the hashtag, which I'm going to show on the screen right now. So, yeah, I think you can tweet using Hashem in boot camp 2024. Use this hashtag, share your experience on Twitter or LinkedIn. We just wanted to see, like, what you learned and, you know, show the world what you're doing right now in the bootcamp.
02:00:06.122 - 02:00:20.314, Speaker A: Yeah. Amazing. And if you tag me, probably I repost you as well. So this is me. Oh, wait, this is me. Oh, and this is. You can have both.
02:00:20.314 - 02:00:56.826, Speaker A: And what more do you have here? I think we are good. And congrats, everyone. Congrats all the people that was with us today and all the volunteers that helped the developers, experts, the community advocates that was here with you. Try to help you. Try to be sure that we are together. Remember that also we have the Discord channel. And is this for today? Tomorrow we you will learn how to create your token.
02:00:56.826 - 02:01:12.874, Speaker A: Like in the spanish session. They was asking to create a mimicoin. It's up to you. Okay. And tomorrow you are creating our token and you learn how to interact with your token. So, bye. See you tomorrow.
02:01:14.374 - 02:01:16.134, Speaker B: See you guys. See you tomorrow. Bye.
